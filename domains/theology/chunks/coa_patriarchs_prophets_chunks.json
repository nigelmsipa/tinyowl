The great controversy\nbetween truth and error, between light and darkness, between the\npower of God and the attempted usurpations of the enemy of all\nrighteousness, is the one great spectacle which it is reasonable to\nsuppose must engage the attention of all worlds. That such a con-\ntroversy exists as the result of sin, that it is to pass through various\nstages of progress, and end at last in a manner to redound to the glory\nof God and the higher exaltation of His loyal servants, is as certain\nas that the Bible is a revelation from God to men. That word reveals\nthe great features of this controversy, a conflict which embraces the\nredemption of a world; and there are special epochs when these\nquestions assume unwonted interest, and it becomes a matter of the\nfirst importance to understand our relation thereto.\nSuch a time is the present, for all things indicate that we may now\nconfidently cherish the hope that this long controversy is drawing\nnear its close. Yet many now seem disposed to relegate to the realm\nof fable that portion of the record opening to our view the steps by\nwhich our world became involved in this great issue; and others,\nthough avoiding this extreme view, seem nevertheless inclined to\nregard it as obsolete and unimportant, and are thus led to treat it with\nneglect.\nBut who would not wish to look into the secret causes of so\nstrange a defection; to discern its spirit, to mark its consequences,\nand to learn how to avoid its results? With such themes this volume\ndeals. It tends to foster a living interest in those portions of God\u2019s [18]\nword most often neglected. It clothes with new meaning the promises\nand prophecies of the sacred record, vindicates the ways of God\nin dealing with rebellion, and shows forth the wonderful grace of\nGod in devising a way of salvation for sinful man. Thus we are\niii\ntaken down in the history of this work to a time when the plans and\npurposes of God had been clearly unfolded to the chosen people.\nThough dealing with themes so exalted, themes that stir the heart\nto its depths and awaken the liveliest emotions of the mind, the style\nof the book is lucid, and the language plain and direct. We commend\nthis volume to all who take pleasure in studying the divine plan of\nhuman redemption and who feel any interest in the relation of their\nown souls to Christ\u2019s atoning work; and to all others we commend\nit, that it may awaken in them an interest in these things.\nThat its perusal may be blessed to the good of those who read,\nand result in turning the feet of many into the way of life, is the\nearnest prayer of the\nPublishers.\nIntroduction [19]\nThis volume treats upon the themes of Bible history, themes\nnot in themselves new, yet here so presented as to give them a new\nsignificance, revealing springs of action, showing the important\nbearing of certain movements, and bringing into stronger light some\nfeatures that are but briefly mentioned in the Bible. Thus the scenes\nhave a vividness and importance that tend to make new and lasting\nimpressions. Such a light is shed upon the Scripture record as\nto reveal more fully the character and purposes of God; to make\nmanifest the wiles of Satan and the means by which his power will\nbe finally overthrown; to bring to view the weakness of the human\nheart, and show how the grace of God has enabled men to conquer in\nthe battle with evil. All this is in harmony with what God has shown\nto be His purpose in unfolding to men the truths of His word. The\nagency by which these revelations have been given is seen\u2014when\ntested by the Scriptures\u2014to be one of the methods God still employs\nto impart instruction to the children of men.\nWhile it is not now as it was in the beginning, when man in his\nholiness and innocence had personal instruction from his Maker,\nstill man is not left without a divine teacher which God has provided\nin His representative, the Holy Spirit. So we hear the apostle Paul\ndeclaring that a certain divine \u201cillumination\u201d is the privilege of the\nfollowers of Christ; and that they are \u201cenlightened\u201d by being made\n\u201cpartakers of the Holy Ghost.\u201d Hebrews 10:32; 6:4. John also says,\n\u201cYe have an unction from the Holy One.\u201d 1 John 2:20. And Christ\npromised the disciples, as He was about to leave them, that He would\nsend them the Holy Spirit as a comforter and guide to lead them into\nall truth. John 14:16, 26.\nTo show how this promise was to be fulfilled to the church, the [20]\napostle Paul, in two of his epistles, presents formal declaration that\ncertain gifts of the Spirit have been placed in the Church for its\nedification and instruction to the end of time. 1 Corinthians 12;\nEphesians 4:8-13; Matthew 28:20 Nor is this all: a number of clear\nv\nand explicit prophecies declare that in the last days there will be a\nspecial outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and that the church at the time\nof Christ\u2019s appearing will have had, during its closing experience,\n\u201cthe testimony of Jesus,\u201d which is the spirit of prophecy. Acts 2:17-\n20, 39; 1 Corinthians 1:7; Revelation 12:17; Revelation 19:10. In\nthese facts we see an evidence of God\u2019s care and love for His people;\nfor the presence of the Holy Spirit as a comforter, teacher, and\nguide, not only in its ordinary, but in its extraordinary, methods of\noperation, certainly is needed by the church as it enters the perils of\nthe last days, more than in any other part of its experience.\nThe Scriptures point out various channels through which the\nHoly Spirit would operate on the hearts and minds of men to en-\nlighten their understanding and guide their steps. Among these were\nvisions and dreams. In this way God would still communicate with\nthe children of men. Here is His promise on this point: \u201cHear now\nmy words: If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make\nMyself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a\ndream.\u201d Numbers 12:6. By this means supernatural knowledge was\ncommunicated to Balaam. Thus He says: \u201cBalaam the son of Beor\nhath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: he hath said,\nwhich heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the Most\nHigh, which saw the vision of the almighty, falling into a trance, but\nhaving his eyes open.\u201d Numbers 24:15, 16.\nIt thus becomes a matter of great interest to investigate the tes-\ntimony of the Scriptures concerning the extent to which the Lord\ndesigned that the Spirit should manifest itself in the church during\nthe period of human probation.\nAfter the plan of salvation had been devised, God, as we have[21]\nseen, could still, through the ministry of His Son and the holy angels,\ncommunicate with men across the gulf which sin had made. Some-\ntimes He spoke face to face with them, as in the case of Moses, but\nmore frequently by dreams and visions. Instances of such communi-\ncation are everywhere prominent upon the sacred record, covering\nall dispensations. Enoch the seventh from Adam looked forward in\nthe spirit of prophecy to the second advent of Christ in power and\nglory, and exclaimed, \u201cBehold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands\nof His saints.\u201d Jude 14. \u201cHoly men of God spake as they were moved\nby the Holy Ghost.\u201d 2 Peter 1:21. If the operation of the spirit of\nprophecy has at times seemed almost to disappear, as the spirituality\nof the people waned, it has nevertheless marked all the great crises\nin the experience of the church, and the epochs which witnessed\nthe change from one dispensation to another. When the era marked\nby the incarnation of Christ was reached, the father of John the\nBaptist was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied. Luke 1:67.\nTo Simeon it was revealed that he should not see death till he had\nseen the Lord; and when the parents of Jesus brought Him into\nthe temple that He might be dedicated, Simeon came by the Spirit\ninto the temple, took Him into his arms, and blessed Him while he\nprophesied concerning Him. And Anna, a prophetess, coming in the\nsame instant, spake of Him to all them that looked for redemption in\nJerusalem. Luke 2:26, 36.\nThe outpouring of the Holy Spirit which was to attend the preach-\ning of the gospel by the followers of Christ was announced by the\nprophet in these words: \u201cAnd it shall come to pass afterward, that\nI will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your\ndaughters shall prophesy, and your old men shall dream dreams,\nyour young men shall see visions: And also upon the servants and\nupon the handmaids in those days will I pour out My Spirit. And I\nwill show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire,\nand pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and [22]\nthe moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord\ncome.\u201d Joel 2:28-31.\nPeter, on the Day of Pentecost, quoted this prophecy in explana-\ntion of the wonderful scene which then occurred. Cloven tongues\nlike as of fire sat upon each of the disciples; they were filled with the\nholy spirit, and spake with other tongues. And when the mockers\ncharged that they were filled with new wine, Peter answered, \u201cThese\nare not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the\nday. But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel.\u201d Then he\nquotes the prophecy substantially as found in Joel (quoted above),\nonly he puts the words \u201cin the last days,\u201d in the place of \u201cAfterward,\u201d\nmaking it read, \u201cand it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God,\nI will pour out of My Spirit,\u201d etc.\nIt is evident that it was that part of the prophecy only which\nrelates to the outpouring of the Spirit, that began to be fulfilled on\nthat day; for there were no old men there dreaming dreams, nor\nyoung men and maidens seeing visions and prophesying; and no\nwonders of blood and fire and pillars of smoke then appeared; and\nthe sun was not darkened and the moon was not turned to blood at\nthat time; and yet what was there witnessed was in fulfillment of the\nprophecy of Joel. It is equally evident that this part of the prophecy\nconcerning the outpouring of the Spirit was not exhausted in that\none manifestation; for the prophecy covers all days from that time\non to the coming of the great day of the Lord.\nBut the Day of Pentecost was in fulfillment of other prophecies\nbesides that of Joel. It fulfilled the words of Christ Himself as well.\nIn His last discourse to His disciples before His crucifixion, He\nsaid to them: \u201cI will pray the Father, and He shall give you another\nComforter, ... Even the Spirit of truth.\u201d John 14:16, 17. \u201cBut the\nComforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in\nMy name, He shall teach you all things.\u201d Verse 26. \u201cHowbeit when\nHe, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.\u201d[23]\nChapter 16:13. And after Christ had risen from the dead, He said to\nthe disciples, \u201cBehold, I send the promise of my Father upon you:\nBut tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power\nfrom on high.\u201d Luke 24:49.\nOn the Day of Pentecost the disciples were thus endued with\npower from on high. But this promise of Christ\u2019s was not, any\nmore than the prophecy of Joel, confined to that occasion. For\nHe gave them the same promise in another form by assuring them\nthat He would be with them always, even to the end of the world.\nMatthew 28:20. Mark tells us in what sense and what manner the\nLord was to be with them. He says, \u201cAnd they went forth, and\npreached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming\nthe word with signs following.\u201d Mark 16:20. And Peter, on the Day\nof Pentecost, testified concerning the perpetuity of this operation of\nthe Spirit which they had witnessed. When the convicted Jews said\nunto the apostles, \u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d Peter answered, \u201cRepent,\nand be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the\nremission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\nFor the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are\nafar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.\u201d Acts 2:37-39.\nThis certainly provides for the operation of the Holy Spirit in the\nchurch, even in its special manifestations, to all coming time, as long\nas mercy shall invite men to accept the pardoning love of Christ.\nTwenty-eight years later in his letter to the Corinthians, Paul\nset before that church a formal argument on the question. He says\n(1 Corinthians 12:1), \u201cNow concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I\nwould not have you ignorant\u201d\u2014so important did he deem it that\nthis subject should be understood in the Christian church. After\nstating that though the Spirit is one it has diversities of operation,\nand explaining what those diversities are, he introduces the figure of\nthe human body, with its various members, to show how the church\nis constituted with its different offices and gifts. And as the body has\nits various members, each having its particular office to fill, and all [24]\nworking together in unity of purpose to constitute one harmonious\nwhole, so the Spirit was to operate through various channels in the\nchurch to constitute a perfect religious body. Paul then continues in\nthese words: \u201cAnd God hath set some in the church, first apostles,\nsecondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts\nof healing, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.\u201d\nThe declaration that God hath set some in the church, etc., im-\nplies something more than that the way was left open for the gifts\nto appear if circumstances should chance to favor. It rather signifies\nthat they were to be permanent parts of the true spiritual constitu-\ntion of the church, and that if these were not in active operation the\nchurch would be in the condition of a human body, some of whose\nmembers had, through accident or disease, become crippled and\nhelpless. Having once been set in the church, there these gifts must\nremain until they are formally removed. But there is no record that\nthey ever have been removed.\nFive years later the same apostle writes to the Ephesians relative\nto the same gifts, plainly stating their object, and thus showing\nindirectly that they must continue till that object is accomplished.\nHe says (Ephesians 4:8, 11-13): \u201cWherefore He saith, when He\nascended up on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto\nmen.... And He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,\nevangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of\nthe saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body\nof Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the\nknowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure\nof the stature of the fullness of Christ.\u201d\nThe church did not reach the state of unity here contemplated,\nin the apostolic age; and very soon after that age, the gloom of\nthe great spiritual apostasy began to overshadow the church; and\ncertainly during the state of declension, this fullness of Christ, and\nunity of faith, was not reached. Nor will it be reached till the last[25]\nmessage of mercy shall have gathered out of every kindred and\npeople, every class of society, and every organization of error, a\npeople complete in all gospel reforms, waiting for the coming of\nthe Son of man. And truly, if ever in her experience the church\nwould need the benefit of every agency ordained for her comfort\nand guidance, encouragement and protection, it would be amid the\nperils of the last days, when the powers of evil, well-nigh perfected\nby experience and training for their nefarious work, would, by their\nmasterpieces of imposture, deceive if it were possible even the elect.\nVery appropriately, therefore, come in the special prophecies of the\noutpouring of the Spirit for the benefit of the church in the last days.\nIt is, however, usually taught, in the current literature of the\nChristian world, that the gifts of the Spirit were only for the apostolic\nage; that they were given simply for the planting of the gospel; and\nthat the gospel being once established, the gifts were no longer\nneeded, and consequently were suffered soon to disappear from the\nchurch. But the apostle Paul warned the Christians of his day that\nthe \u201cmystery of iniquity\u201d was already at work, and that after his\ndeparture, grievous wolves would enter in among them, not sparing\nthe flock, and that also of their own selves men would arise, speaking\nperverse things to draw away disciples after them. Acts 20:29, 30.\nIt cannot therefore be that the gifts, placed in the church to guard\nagainst these very evils, were ready, when that time came, to pass\naway as having accomplished their object; for their presence and\nhelp would be needed under these conditions more than when the\napostles themselves were on the stage of action.\nWe find another statement in Paul\u2019s letter to the Corinthian\nchurch, which shows that the popular conception of the temporary\ncontinuance of the gifts cannot be correct. It is his contrast between\nthe present, imperfect state, and the glorious, immortal condition to\nwhich the Christian will finally arrive. 1 Corinthians 13. He says\n(Verses 9, 10). \u201cFor we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But [26]\nwhen that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall\nbe done away.\u201d He further illustrates this present state by comparing\nit to the period of childhood with its weakness and immaturity of\nthought and action; and the perfect state, to the condition of man-\nhood with its clearer vision, maturity, and strength. And he classes\nthe gifts among those things which are needed in this present, im-\nperfect condition, but which we shall have no occasion for when the\nperfect state is come. \u201cNow,\u201d he says (Verse 12), \u201cwe see through\na glass, darkly; but then face to face: Now I know in part; but then\nshall I know even as also I am known.\u201d Then he states what graces\nare adapted to the eternal state, and will there exist, namely, faith,\nhope, and charity, or love, \u201cthese three; but the greatest of these is\ncharity.\u201d\nThis explains the language of Verse 8: \u201cCharity never faileth;\u201d\nthat is, charity, the heavenly grace of love, will endure forever;\nit is the crowning glory of man\u2019s future, immortal condition; but\n\u201cwhether there be prophecies, they shall fail;\u201d that is, the time will\ncome when prophecies will be no longer needed, and the gift of\nprophecy, as one of the helps in the church, will no longer be exer-\ncised; \u201cwhether there be tongues, they shall cease;\u201d that is, the gift of\ntongues will no longer be of service; \u201cwhether there be knowledge,\nit shall vanish away;\u201d that is, knowledge, not in the abstract, but as\none of the special gifts of the Spirit, will be rendered unnecessary\nby the perfect knowledge with which we shall be endowed in the\neternal world.\nNow, if we take the position that the gifts ceased with the apos-\ntolic age, because no longer needed, we commit ourselves to the\nposition that the apostolic age was the weak and childish age of the\nchurch, when everything was seen through a glass, darkly; but the\nage that followed, when grievous wolves were to enter in, not spar-\ning the flock, and men were to arise, even in the church, speaking\nperverse things to draw away disciples after them, was an age of\nperfect light and knowledge, in which the imperfect and childish and [27]\ndarkened knowledge of apostolic times had passed away! For, be\nit remembered, the gifts cease only when a perfect state is reached,\nand because that state is reached, which renders them no longer\nnecessary. But no one, on sober thought, can for a moment seek to\nmaintain the position that the apostolic age was inferior in spiritual\nelevation to any age which has succeeded it. And if the gifts were\nneeded then, they certainly are needed now.\nAmong the agencies which the apostle in his letters to both the\nCorinthians and Ephesians enumerates as \u201cgifts\u201d set in the church,\nwe find \u201cpastors,\u201d \u201cteachers,\u201d \u201chelps,\u201d and \u201cgovernments;\u201d and all\nthese are acknowledged, on every hand, as still continuing in the\nchurch. Why not, then, the others also, including faith, healing,\nprophecy, etc.? Who is competent to draw the line, and say what gifts\nhave been \u201cset out\u201d of the church, when all were, in the beginning,\nequally \u201cset\u201d therein?\nRevelation 12:17 has been referred to as a prophecy that the\ngifts would be restored in the last days. An examination of its\ntestimony will confirm this view. The text speaks of the remnant of\nthe woman\u2019s seed. The woman being a symbol of the church, her\nseed would be the individual members composing the church at any\none time; and the \u201cremnant\u201d of her seed would be the last generation\nof Christians, or those living on the earth at the second coming of\nChrist. The text further declares that these \u201ckeep the commandments\nof God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ;\u201d and the \u201ctestimony\nof Jesus\u201d is explained in chapter 19:10 to be \u201cthe spirit of prophecy,\u201d\nwhich must be understood as that which among the gifts is called\n\u201cthe gift of prophecy.\u201d 1 Corinthians 12:9, 10.\nThe setting of the gifts in the church does not imply that every\nindividual was to have them in exercise. On this point the apostle (1\nCorinthians 12:29) says, \u201cAre all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all\nteachers?\u201d etc. the implied answer is no; not all are; but the gifts are\ndivided among the members as it pleases God. 1 Corinthians 12:7,[28]\n11. Yet these gifts are said to be \u201cset in the church,\u201d and if a gift\nis bestowed upon even one member of the church, it may be said\nthat that gift is \u201cin the church,\u201d or that the church \u201chas\u201d it. So the\nlast generation was to have, and it is believed does now have, the\ntestimony of Jesus, or the gift of prophecy.\nAnother portion of Scripture evidently written with reference to\nthe last days, brings the same fact plainly to view. 1 Thessalonians\n5. The apostle opens the chapter with these words: \u201cBut of the times\nand the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I write unto you.\nFor yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh\nas a thief in the night.\u201d In Verse 4 he adds, \u201cBut ye, brethren, are\nnot in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.\u201d Then\nhe gives them sundry admonitions in view of that event, among\nwhich are these (verses 19-21): \u201cQuench not the Spirit. Despise not\nprophesyings. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.\u201d And in\nverse 23 he prays that these very ones who were thus to have to do\nwith \u201cprophesyings\u201d may be preserved blameless unto the coming\nof the Lord.\nOn the strength of these considerations are we not justified in\nbelieving that the gift of prophecy will be manifested in the church\nin the last days, and that through it much light will be imparted, and\nmuch timely instruction given?\nAll things are to be treated according to the apostle\u2019s rule: \u201cProve\nall things; hold fast that which is good;\u201d and to be tested by the\nSaviour\u2019s standard: \u201cBy their fruits ye shall know them.\u201d Appealing\nto this standard in behalf of what claims to be a manifestation of the\ngift of prophecy, we commend this volume to the consideration of\nthose who believe that the Bible is the word of God, and that the\nchurch is the body of which Christ is head.\nU.

[29]\n\u201cGod is love.\u201d 1 John 4:16. His nature, His law, is love. It ever\nhas been; it ever will be. \u201cThe high and lofty One that inhabiteth\neternity,\u201d whose \u201cways are everlasting,\u201d changeth not. With Him \u201cis\nno variableness, neither shadow of turning.\u201d Isaiah 57:15; Habakkuk\n3:6; James 1:17.\nEvery manifestation of creative power is an expression of infinite\nlove. The sovereignty of God involves fullness of blessing to all\ncreated beings. The psalmist says:\n\u201cStrong is Thy hand, and high is Thy right hand.\nRighteousness and judgment are the foundation of Thy\nthrone:\nMercy and truth go before Thy face.\nBlessed is the people that know the joyful sound:\nThey walk, O Lord, in the light of Thy countenance.\nIn Thy name do they rejoice all the day:\nAnd in Thy righteousness are they exalted.\nFor Thou art the glory of their strength: ...\nFor our shield belongeth unto Jehovah,\nAnd our king to the Holy One.\u201d\nPsalm 89:13-18, R.V . [Note:\nIn this text and in some other\nBible quotations used in this\nbook the word \u201cJehovah\u201d is\nemployed instead of \u201cLord,\u201d\nas rendered in the American\nSupplement to the Revised\nVersion.]\nThe history of the great conflict between good and evil, from\nthe time it first began in heaven to the final overthrow of rebellion\nand the total eradication of sin, is also a demonstration of God\u2019s\nunchanging love.\n17\n18 Patriarchs and Prophets\nThe Sovereign of the universe was not alone in His work of[34]\nbeneficence. He had an associate\u2014a co-worker who could appre-\nciate His purposes, and could share His joy in giving happiness to\ncreated beings. \u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was\nwith God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning\nwith God.\u201d John 1:1, 2. Christ, the Word, the only begotten of God,\nwas one with the eternal Father\u2014one in nature, in character, in\npurpose\u2014the only being that could enter into all the counsels and\npurposes of God. \u201cHis name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor,\nThe mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.\u201d Isa-\niah 9:6. His \u201cgoings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.\u201d\nMicah 5:2. And the Son of God declares concerning Himself: \u201cThe\nLord possessed Me in the beginning of His way, before His works\nof old. I was set up from everlasting.... When He appointed the\nfoundations of the earth: then I was by Him, as one brought up with\nHim: and I was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him.\u201d\nProverbs 8:22-30.\nThe Father wrought by His Son in the creation of all heavenly\nbeings. \u201cBy Him were all things created, ... whether they be thrones,\nor dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created\nby Him, and for Him.\u201d Colossians 1:16. Angels are God\u2019s ministers,\nradiant with the light ever flowing from His presence and speeding\non rapid wing to execute His will. But the Son, the anointed of God,\nthe \u201cexpress image of His person,\u201d \u201cthe brightness of His glory,\u201d\n\u201cupholding all things by the word of His power,\u201d holds supremacy\nover them all. Hebrews 1:3. \u201cA glorious high throne from the\nbeginning,\u201d was the place of His sanctuary (Jeremiah 17:12); \u201ca\nscepter of righteousness,\u201d the scepter of His kingdom. Hebrews 1:8.\n\u201cHonor and majesty are before Him: strength and beauty are in His\nsanctuary.\u201d Psalm 96:6. Mercy and truth go before His face. Psalm\n89:14.\nThe law of love being the foundation of the government of God,\nthe happiness of all intelligent beings depends upon their perfect\naccord with its great principles of righteousness. God desires from\nall His creatures the service of love\u2014service that springs from an\nappreciation of His character. He takes no pleasure in a forced\nobedience; and to all He grants freedom of will, that they may\nrender Him voluntary service.\nWhy was Sin Permitted? 19\nSo long as all created beings acknowledged the allegiance of [35]\nlove, there was perfect harmony throughout the universe of God.\nIt was the joy of the heavenly host to fulfill the purpose of their\nCreator. They delighted in reflecting His glory and showing forth\nHis praise. And while love to God was supreme, love for one another\nwas confiding and unselfish. There was no note of discord to mar\nthe celestial harmonies. But a change came over this happy state.\nThere was one who perverted the freedom that God had granted to\nHis creatures. Sin originated with him who, next to Christ, had been\nmost honored of God and was highest in power and glory among\nthe inhabitants of heaven. Lucifer, \u201cson of the morning,\u201d was first of\nthe covering cherubs, holy and undefiled. He stood in the presence\nof the great Creator, and the ceaseless beams of glory enshrouding\nthe eternal God rested upon him. \u201cThus saith the Lord God; Thou\nsealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou\nhast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy\ncovering.... Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have\nset thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast\nwalked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast\nperfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity\nwas found in thee.\u201d Ezekiel 28:12-15.\nLittle by little Lucifer came to indulge the desire for self-exal-\ntation. The Scripture says, \u201cThine heart was lifted up because of\nthy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy bright-\nness.\u201d Ezekiel 28:17. \u201cThou hast said in thine heart, ...I will exalt\nmy throne above the stars of God.... I will be like the Most High.\u201d\nIsaiah 14:13, 14. Though all his glory was from God, this mighty\nangel came to regard it as pertaining to himself. Not content with his\nposition, though honored above the heavenly host, he ventured to\ncovet homage due alone to the Creator. Instead of seeking to make\nGod supreme in the affections and allegiance of all created beings, it\nwas his endeavor to secure their service and loyalty to himself. And\ncoveting the glory with which the infinite Father had invested His\nSon, this prince of angels aspired to power that was the prerogative\nof Christ alone.\nNow the perfect harmony of heaven was broken. Lucifer\u2019s dis-\nposition to serve himself instead of his Creator aroused a feeling of\napprehension when observed by those who considered that the glory [36]\n20 Patriarchs and Prophets\nof God should be supreme. In heavenly council the angels pleaded\nwith Lucifer. The Son of God presented before him the greatness,\nthe goodness, and the justice of the Creator, and the sacred, unchang-\ning nature of His law. God Himself had established the order of\nheaven; and in departing from it, Lucifer would dishonor his Maker\nand bring ruin upon himself. But the warning, given in infinite love\nand mercy, only aroused a spirit of resistance. Lucifer allowed his\njealousy of Christ to prevail, and became the more determined.\nTo dispute the supremacy of the Son of God, thus impeaching\nthe wisdom and love of the Creator, had become the purpose of this\nprince of angels. To this object he was about to bend the energies of\nthat master mind, which, next to Christ\u2019s, was first among the hosts\nof God. But He who would have the will of all His creatures free,\nleft none unguarded to the bewildering sophistry by which rebellion\nwould seek to justify itself. Before the great contest should open,\nall were to have a clear presentation of His will, whose wisdom and\ngoodness were the spring of all their joy.\nThe King of the universe summoned the heavenly hosts before\nHim, that in their presence He might set forth the true position of\nHis Son and show the relation He sustained to all created beings.\nThe Son of God shared the Father\u2019s throne, and the glory of the\neternal, self-existent One encircled both. About the throne gathered\nthe holy angels, a vast, unnumbered throng\u2014\u201cten thousand times ten\nthousand, and thousands of thousands\u201d (Revelation 5:11.), the most\nexalted angels, as ministers and subjects, rejoicing in the light that\nfell upon them from the presence of the Deity. Before the assembled\ninhabitants of heaven the King declared that none but Christ, the\nOnly Begotten of God, could fully enter into His purposes, and to\nHim it was committed to execute the mighty counsels of His will.\nThe Son of God had wrought the Father\u2019s will in the creation of all\nthe hosts of heaven; and to Him, as well as to God, their homage\nand allegiance were due. Christ was still to exercise divine power,\nin the creation of the earth and its inhabitants. But in all this He\nwould not seek power or exaltation for Himself contrary to God\u2019s\nplan, but would exalt the Father\u2019s glory and execute His purposes of\nbeneficence and love.\nThe angels joyfully acknowledged the supremacy of Christ, and\nprostrating themselves before Him, poured out their love and adora-\nWhy was Sin Permitted? 21\ntion. Lucifer bowed with them, but in his heart there was a strange, [37]\nfierce conflict. Truth, justice, and loyalty were struggling against\nenvy and jealousy. The influence of the holy angels seemed for a\ntime to carry him with them. As songs of praise ascended in melo-\ndious strains, swelled by thousands of glad voices, the spirit of evil\nseemed vanquished; unutterable love thrilled his entire being; his\nsoul went out, in harmony with the sinless worshippers, in love to\nthe Father and the Son. But again he was filled with pride in his own\nglory. His desire for supremacy returned, and envy of Christ was\nonce more indulged. The high honors conferred upon Lucifer were\nnot appreciated as God\u2019s special gift, and therefore, called forth no\ngratitude to his Creator. He gloried in his brightness and exaltation\nand aspired to be equal with God. He was beloved and reverenced\nby the heavenly host, angels delighted to execute his commands, and\nhe was clothed with wisdom and glory above them all. Yet the Son\nof God was exalted above him, as one in power and authority with\nthe Father. He shared the Father\u2019s counsels, while Lucifer did not\nthus enter into the purposes of God. \u201cWhy,\u201d questioned this mighty\nangel, \u201cshould Christ have the supremacy? Why is He honored\nabove Lucifer?\u201d\nLeaving his place in the immediate presence of the Father, Lu-\ncifer went forth to diffuse the spirit of discontent among the angels.\nHe worked with mysterious secrecy, and for a time concealed his\nreal purpose under an appearance of reverence for God. He began to\ninsinuate doubts concerning the laws that governed heavenly beings,\nintimating that though laws might be necessary for the inhabitants\nof the worlds, angels, being more exalted, needed no such restraint,\nfor their own wisdom was a sufficient guide. They were not beings\nthat could bring dishonor to God; all their thoughts were holy; it\nwas no more possible for them than for God Himself to err. The\nexaltation of the Son of God as equal with the Father was represented\nas an injustice to Lucifer, who, it was claimed, was also entitled to\nreverence and honor. If this prince of angels could but attain to his\ntrue, exalted position, great good would accrue to the entire host\nof heaven; for it was his object to secure freedom for all. But now\neven the liberty which they had hitherto enjoyed was at an end; for\nan absolute Ruler had been appointed them, and to His authority all\n22 Patriarchs and Prophets\nmust pay homage. Such were the subtle deceptions that through the\nwiles of Lucifer were fast obtaining in the heavenly courts.\nThere had been no change in the position or authority of Christ.[38]\nLucifer\u2019s envy and misrepresentation and his claims to equality with\nChrist had made necessary a statement of the true position of the\nSon of God; but this had been the same from the beginning. Many\nof the angels were, however, blinded by Lucifer\u2019s deceptions.\nTaking advantage of the loving, loyal trust reposed in him by\nthe holy beings under his command, he had so artfully instilled\ninto their minds his own distrust and discontent that his agency\nwas not discerned. Lucifer had presented the purposes of God in a\nfalse light\u2014misconstruing and distorting them to excite dissent and\ndissatisfaction. He cunningly drew his hearers on to give utterance\nto their feelings; then these expressions were repeated by him when\nit would serve his purpose, as evidence that the angels were not fully\nin harmony with the government of God. While claiming for himself\nperfect loyalty to God, he urged that changes in the order and laws\nof heaven were necessary for the stability of the divine government.\nThus while working to excite opposition to the law of God and to\ninstill his own discontent into the minds of the angels under him, he\nwas ostensibly seeking to remove dissatisfaction and to reconcile\ndisaffected angels to the order of heaven. While secretly fomenting\ndiscord and rebellion, he with consummate craft caused it to appear\nas his sole purpose to promote loyalty and to preserve harmony and\npeace.\nThe spirit of dissatisfaction thus kindled was doing its baleful\nwork. While there was no open outbreak, division of feeling imper-\nceptibly grew up among the angels. There were some who looked\nwith favor upon Lucifer\u2019s insinuations against the government of\nGod. Although they had heretofore been in perfect harmony with\nthe order which God had established, they were now discontented\nand unhappy because they could not penetrate His unsearchable\ncounsels; they were dissatisfied with His purpose in exalting Christ.\nThese stood ready to second Lucifer\u2019s demand for equal authority\nwith the Son of God. But angels who were loyal and true main-\ntained the wisdom and justice of the divine decree and endeavored\nto reconcile this disaffected being to the will of God. Christ was\nthe Son of God; He had been one with Him before the angels were\nWhy was Sin Permitted? 23\ncalled into existence. He had ever stood at the right hand of the\nFather; His supremacy, so full of blessing to all who came under its\nbenignant control, had not heretofore been questioned. The harmony [39]\nof heaven had never been interrupted; wherefore should there now\nbe discord? The loyal angels could see only terrible consequences\nfrom this dissension, and with earnest entreaty they counseled the\ndisaffected ones to renounce their purpose and prove themselves\nloyal to God by fidelity to His government.\nIn great mercy, according to His divine character, God bore\nlong with Lucifer. The spirit of discontent and disaffection had\nnever before been known in heaven. It was a new element, strange,\nmysterious, unaccountable. Lucifer himself had not at first been\nacquainted with the real nature of his feelings; for a time he had\nfeared to express the workings and imaginings of his mind; yet he\ndid not dismiss them. He did not see whither he was drifting. But\nsuch efforts as infinite love and wisdom only could devise, were\nmade to convince him of his error. His disaffection was proved to be\nwithout cause, and he was made to see what would be the result of\npersisting in revolt. Lucifer was convinced that he was in the wrong.\nHe saw that \u201cthe Lord is righteous in all His ways, and holy in all\nHis works\u201d (Psalm 145:17); that the divine statutes are just, and that\nhe ought to acknowledge them as such before all heaven. Had he\ndone this, he might have saved himself and many angels. He had not\nat that time fully cast off his allegiance to God. Though he had left\nhis position as covering cherub, yet if he had been willing to return\nto God, acknowledging the Creator\u2019s wisdom, and satisfied to fill\nthe place appointed him in God\u2019s great plan, he would have been\nreinstated in his office. The time had come for a final decision; he\nmust fully yield to the divine sovereignty or place himself in open\nrebellion. He nearly reached the decision to return, but pride forbade\nhim. It was too great a sacrifice for one who had been so highly\nhonored to confess that he had been in error, that his imaginings\nwere false, and to yield to the authority which he had been working\nto prove unjust.\nA compassionate Creator, in yearning pity for Lucifer and his\nfollowers, was seeking to draw them back from the abyss of ruin into\nwhich they were about to plunge. But His mercy was misinterpreted.\nLucifer pointed to the long-suffering of God as an evidence of his\n24 Patriarchs and Prophets\nown superiority, an indication that the King of the universe would\nyet accede to his terms. If the angels would stand firmly with him,\nhe declared, they could yet gain all that they desired. He persistently[40]\ndefended his own course, and fully committed himself to the great\ncontroversy against his Maker. Thus it was that Lucifer, \u201cthe light\nbearer,\u201d the sharer of God\u2019s glory, the attendant of His throne, by\ntransgression became Satan, \u201cthe adversary\u201d of God and holy beings\nand the destroyer of those whom Heaven had committed to his\nguidance and guardianship.\nRejecting with disdain the arguments and entreaties of the loyal\nangels, he denounced them as deluded slaves. The preference shown\nto Christ he declared an act of injustice both to himself and to all the\nheavenly host, and announced that he would no longer submit to this\ninvasion of his rights and theirs. He would never again acknowledge\nthe supremacy of Christ. He had determined to claim the honor\nwhich should have been given him, and take command of all who\nwould become his followers; and he promised those who would\nenter his ranks a new and better government, under which all would\nenjoy freedom. Great numbers of the angels signified their purpose\nto accept him as their leader. Flattered by the favor with which his\nadvances were received, he hoped to win all the angels to his side,\nto become equal with God Himself, and to be obeyed by the entire\nhost of heaven.\nStill the loyal angels urged him and his sympathizers to submit\nto God; and they set before them the inevitable result should they\nrefuse: He who had created them could overthrow their power and\nsignally punish their rebellious daring. No angel could successfully\noppose the law of God, which was as sacred as Himself. They\nwarned all to close their ears against Lucifer\u2019s deceptive reasoning,\nand urged him and his followers to seek the presence of God without\ndelay and confess the error of questioning His wisdom and authority.\nMany were disposed to heed this counsel, to repent of their\ndisaffection, and seek to be again received into favor with the Father\nand His Son. But Lucifer had another deception ready. The mighty\nrevolter now declared that the angels who had united with him had\ngone too far to return; that he was acquainted with the divine law,\nand knew that God would not forgive. He declared that all who\nshould submit to the authority of Heaven would be stripped of their\nWhy was Sin Permitted? 25\nhonor, degraded from their position. For himself, he was determined\nnever again to acknowledge the authority of Christ. The only course [41]\nremaining for him and his followers, he said, was to assert their\nliberty, and gain by force the rights which had not been willingly\naccorded them.\nSo far as Satan himself was concerned, it was true that he had\nnow gone too far to return. But not so with those who had been\nblinded by his deceptions. To them the counsel and entreaties of\nthe loyal angels opened a door of hope; and had they heeded the\nwarning, they might have broken away from the snare of Satan. But\npride, love for their leader, and the desire for unrestricted freedom\nwere permitted to bear sway, and the pleadings of divine love and\nmercy were finally rejected.\nGod permitted Satan to carry forward his work until the spirit\nof disaffection ripened into active revolt. It was necessary for his\nplans to be fully developed, that their true nature and tendency\nmight be seen by all. Lucifer, as the anointed cherub, had been\nhighly exalted; he was greatly loved by the heavenly beings, and\nhis influence over them was strong. God\u2019s government included\nnot only the inhabitants of heaven, but of all the worlds that He\nhad created; and Lucifer had concluded that if he could carry the\nangels of heaven with him in rebellion, he could carry also all the\nworlds. He had artfully presented his side of the question, employing\nsophistry and fraud to secure his objects. His power to deceive was\nvery great. By disguising himself in a cloak of falsehood, he had\ngained an advantage. All his acts were so clothed with mystery that\nit was difficult to disclose to the angels the true nature of his work.\nUntil fully developed, it could not be made to appear the evil thing\nit was; his disaffection would not be seen to be rebellion. Even the\nloyal angels could not fully discern his character or see to what his\nwork was leading.\nLucifer had at first so conducted his temptations that he himself\nstood uncommitted. The angels whom he could not bring fully to his\nside, he accused of indifference to the interests of heavenly beings.\nThe very work which he himself was doing, he charged upon the\nloyal angels. It was his policy to perplex with subtle arguments\nconcerning the purposes of God. Everything that was simple he\nshrouded in mystery, and by artful perversion cast doubt upon the\n26 Patriarchs and Prophets\nplainest statements of Jehovah. And his high position, so closely\nconnected with the divine government, gave greater force to his\nrepresentations.\nGod could employ only such means as were consistent with truth[42]\nand righteousness. Satan could use what God could not\u2014flattery\nand deceit. He had sought to falsify the word of God and had mis-\nrepresented His plan of government, claiming that God was not just\nin imposing laws upon the angels; that in requiring submission and\nobedience from His creatures, He was seeking merely the exaltation\nof Himself. It was therefore necessary to demonstrate before the\ninhabitants of heaven, and of all the worlds, that God\u2019s government\nis just, His law perfect. Satan had made it appear that he himself was\nseeking to promote the good of the universe. The true character of\nthe usurper and his real object must be understood by all. He must\nhave time to manifest himself by his wicked works.\nThe discord which his own course had caused in heaven, Satan\ncharged upon the government of God. All evil he declared to be\nthe result of the divine administration. He claimed that it was his\nown object to improve upon the statutes of Jehovah. Therefore God\npermitted him to demonstrate the nature of his claims, to show the\nworking out of his proposed changes in the divine law. His own work\nmust condemn him. Satan had claimed from the first that he was not\nin rebellion. The whole universe must see the deceiver unmasked.\nEven when he was cast out of heaven, Infinite Wisdom did not\ndestroy Satan. Since only the service of love can be acceptable to\nGod, the allegiance of His creatures must rest upon a conviction of\nHis justice and benevolence. The inhabitants of heaven and of the\nworlds, being unprepared to comprehend the nature or consequences\nof sin, could not then have seen the justice of God in the destruction\nof Satan. Had he been immediately blotted out of existence, some\nwould have served God from fear rather than from love. The influ-\nence of the deceiver would not have been fully destroyed, nor would\nthe spirit of rebellion have been utterly eradicated. For the good of\nthe entire universe through ceaseless ages, he must more fully de-\nvelop his principles, that his charges against the divine government\nmight be seen in their true light by all created beings, and that the\njustice and mercy of God and the immutability of His law might be\nforever placed beyond all question.\nWhy was Sin Permitted? 27\nSatan\u2019s rebellion was to be a lesson to the universe through all\ncoming ages\u2014a perpetual testimony to the nature of sin and its\nterrible results. The working out of Satan\u2019s rule, its effects upon [43]\nboth men and angels, would show what must be the fruit of setting\naside the divine authority. It would testify that with the existence of\nGod\u2019s government is bound up the well-being of all the creatures He\nhas made. Thus the history of this terrible experiment of rebellion\nwas to be a perpetual safeguard to all holy beings, to prevent them\nfrom being deceived as to the nature of transgression, to save them\nfrom committing sin, and suffering its penalty.\nHe that ruleth in the heavens is the one who sees the end from the\nbeginning\u2014the one before whom the mysteries of the past and the\nfuture are alike outspread, and who, beyond the woe and darkness\nand ruin that sin has wrought, beholds the accomplishment of His\nown purposes of love and blessing. Though \u201cclouds and darkness are\nround about Him: righteousness and judgment are the foundation\nof His throne.\u201d Psalm 97:2, R.V . And this the inhabitants of the\nuniverse, both loyal and disloyal, will one day understand. \u201cHis\nwork is perfect: for all His ways are judgment: a God of truth and\nwithout iniquity, just and right is He.\u201d Deuteronomy 32:4.\nChapter 2\u2014The Creation[44]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 1 and 2.\n\u201cBy the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the\nhost of them by the breath of His mouth.\u201d \u201cFor He spake, and it\nwas;\u201d \u201cHe commanded, and it stood fast.\u201d Psalm 33:6, 9. He \u201claid\nthe foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed forever.\u201d\nPsalm 104:5.\nAs the earth came forth from the hand of its Maker, it was\nexceedingly beautiful. Its surface was diversified with mountains,\nhills, and plains, interspersed with noble rivers and lovely lakes; but\nthe hills and mountains were not abrupt and rugged, abounding in\nterrific steeps and frightful chasms, as they now do; the sharp, ragged\nedges of earth\u2019s rocky framework were buried beneath the fruitful\nsoil, which everywhere produced a luxuriant growth of verdure.\nThere were no loathsome swamps or barren deserts. Graceful shrubs\nand delicate flowers greeted the eye at every turn. The heights were\ncrowned with trees more majestic than any that now exist. The\nair, untainted by foul miasma, was clear and healthful. The entire\nlandscape outvied in beauty the decorated grounds of the proudest\npalace. The angelic host viewed the scene with delight, and rejoiced\nat the wonderful works of God.\nAfter the earth with its teeming animal and vegetable life had\nbeen called into existence, man, the crowning work of the Creator,\nand the one for whom the beautiful earth had been fitted up, was\nbrought upon the stage of action. To him was given dominion over\nall that his eye could behold; for \u201cGod said, Let Us make man in\nOur image, after Our likeness: and let them have dominion over\n...all the earth.... So God created man in His own image; ...male\nand female created He them.\u201d Here is clearly set forth the origin\nof the human race; and the divine record is so plainly stated that\nthere is no occasion for erroneous conclusions. God created man[45]\nin His own image. Here is no mystery. There is no ground for the\n28\nCreation 29\nsupposition that man was evolved by slow degrees of development\nfrom the lower forms of animal or vegetable life. Such teaching\nlowers the great work of the Creator to the level of man\u2019s narrow,\nearthly conceptions. Men are so intent upon excluding God from the\nsovereignty of the universe that they degrade man and defraud him\nof the dignity of his origin. He who set the starry worlds on high and\ntinted with delicate skill the flowers of the field, who filled the earth\nand the heavens with the wonders of His power, when He came to\ncrown His glorious work, to place one in the midst to stand as ruler\nof the fair earth, did not fail to create a being worthy of the hand that\ngave him life. The genealogy of our race, as given by inspiration,\ntraces back its origin, not to a line of developing germs, mollusks,\nand quadrupeds, but to the great Creator. Though formed from the\ndust, Adam was \u201cthe son of God.\u201d\nHe was placed, as God\u2019s representative, over the lower orders of\nbeing. They cannot understand or acknowledge the sovereignty of\nGod, yet they were made capable of loving and serving man. The\npsalmist says, \u201cThou madest him to have dominion over the works\nof Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet: ... the beasts\nof the field; the fowl of the air, ... and whatsoever passeth through\nthe paths of the seas.\u201d Psalm 8:6-8.\nMan was to bear God\u2019s image, both in outward resemblance\nand in character. Christ alone is \u201cthe express image\u201d (Hebrews\n1:3) of the Father; but man was formed in the likeness of God. His\nnature was in harmony with the will of God. His mind was capable of\ncomprehending divine things. His affections were pure; his appetites\nand passions were under the control of reason. He was holy and\nhappy in bearing the image of God and in perfect obedience to His\nwill.\nAs man came forth from the hand of his Creator, he was of lofty\nstature and perfect symmetry. His countenance bore the ruddy tint of\nhealth and glowed with the light of life and joy. Adam\u2019s height was\nmuch greater than that of men who now inhabit the earth. Eve was\nsomewhat less in stature; yet her form was noble, and full of beauty.\nThe sinless pair wore no artificial garments; they were clothed with a\ncovering of light and glory, such as the angels wear. So long as they\nlived in obedience to God, this robe of light continued to enshroud\nthem.\n30 Patriarchs and Prophets\nAfter the creation of Adam every living creature was brought[46]\nbefore him to receive its name; he saw that to each had been given\na companion, but among them \u201cthere was not found an help meet\nfor him.\u201d Among all the creatures that God had made on the earth,\nthere was not one equal to man. And God said, \u201cIt is not good\nthat the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for\nhim.\u201d Man was not made to dwell in solitude; he was to be a social\nbeing. Without companionship the beautiful scenes and delightful\nemployments of Eden would have failed to yield perfect happiness.\nEven communion with angels could not have satisfied his desire for\nsympathy and companionship. There was none of the same nature\nto love and to be loved.\nGod Himself gave Adam a companion. He provided \u201can help\nmeet for him\u201d\u2014a helper corresponding to him\u2014one who was fitted\nto be his companion, and who could be one with him in love and\nsympathy. Eve was created from a rib taken from the side of Adam,\nsignifying that she was not to control him as the head, nor to be\ntrampled under his feet as an inferior, but to stand by his side as an\nequal, to be loved and protected by him. A part of man, bone of his\nbone, and flesh of his flesh, she was his second self, showing the\nclose union and the affectionate attachment that should exist in this\nrelation. \u201cFor no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth\nand cherisheth it.\u201d Ephesians 5:29. \u201cTherefore shall a man leave his\nfather and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall\nbe one.\u201d\nGod celebrated the first marriage. Thus the institution has for\nits originator the Creator of the universe. \u201cMarriage is honorable\u201d\n(Hebrews 13:4); it was one of the first gifts of God to man, and it is\none of the two institutions that, after the Fall, Adam brought with\nhim beyond the gates of Paradise. When the divine principles are\nrecognized and obeyed in this relation, marriage is a blessing; it\nguards the purity and happiness of the race, it provides for man\u2019s\nsocial needs, it elevates the physical, the intellectual, and the moral\nnature.\n\u201cAnd the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there\nHe put the man whom He had formed.\u201d Everything that God had\nmade was the perfection of beauty, and nothing seemed wanting that\ncould contribute to the happiness of the holy pair; yet the Creator[47]\nCreation 31\ngave them still another token of His love, by preparing a garden\nespecially for their home. In this garden were trees of every variety,\nmany of them laden with fragrant and delicious fruit. There were\nlovely vines, growing upright, yet presenting a most graceful appear-\nance, with their branches drooping under their load of tempting fruit\nof the richest and most varied hues. It was the work of Adam and\nEve to train the branches of the vine to form bowers, thus making\nfor themselves a dwelling from living trees covered with foliage and\nfruit. There were fragrant flowers of every hue in rich profusion. In\nthe midst of the garden stood the tree of life, surpassing in glory all\nother trees. Its fruit appeared like apples of gold and silver, and had\nthe power to perpetuate life.\nThe creation was now complete. \u201cThe heavens and the earth\nwere finished, and all the host of them.\u201d \u201cAnd God saw everything\nthat He had made, and, behold, it was very good.\u201d Eden bloomed on\nearth. Adam and Eve had free access to the tree of life. No taint of\nsin or shadow of death marred the fair creation. \u201cThe morning stars\nsang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.\u201d Job 38:7.\nThe great Jehovah had laid the foundations of the earth; He had\ndressed the whole world in the garb of beauty and had filled it with\nthings useful to man; He had created all the wonders of the land\nand of the sea. In six days the great work of creation had been\naccomplished. And God \u201crested on the seventh day from all His\nwork which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and\nsanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all His work\nwhich God created and made.\u201d God looked with satisfaction upon\nthe work of His hands. All was perfect, worthy of its divine Author,\nand He rested, not as one weary, but as well pleased with the fruits\nof His wisdom and goodness and the manifestations of His glory.\nAfter resting upon the seventh day, God sanctified it, or set it\napart, as a day of rest for man. Following the example of the Creator,\nman was to rest upon this sacred day, that as he should look upon\nthe heavens and the earth, he might reflect upon God\u2019s great work of\ncreation; and that as he should behold the evidences of God\u2019s wisdom\nand goodness, his heart might be filled with love and reverence for\nhis Maker.\nIn Eden, God set up the memorial of His work of creation, in [48]\nplacing His blessing upon the seventh day. The Sabbath was com-\n32 Patriarchs and Prophets\nmitted to Adam, the father and representative of the whole human\nfamily. Its observance was to be an act of grateful acknowledgment,\non the part of all who should dwell upon the earth, that God was\ntheir Creator and their rightful Sovereign; that they were the work\nof His hands and the subjects of His authority. Thus the institution\nwas wholly commemorative, and given to all mankind. There was\nnothing in it shadowy or of restricted application to any people.\nGod saw that a Sabbath was essential for man, even in Paradise.\nHe needed to lay aside his own interests and pursuits for one day of\nthe seven, that he might more fully contemplate the works of God\nand meditate upon His power and goodness. He needed a Sabbath\nto remind him more vividly of God and to awaken gratitude because\nall that he enjoyed and possessed came from the beneficent hand of\nthe Creator.\nGod designs that the Sabbath shall direct the minds of men to the\ncontemplation of His created works. Nature speaks to their senses,\ndeclaring that there is a living God, the Creator, the Supreme Ruler\nof all. \u201cThe heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament\nshoweth His handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night\nunto night showeth knowledge.\u201d Psalm 19:1, 2. The beauty that\nclothes the earth is a token of God\u2019s love. We may behold it in\nthe everlasting hills, in the lofty trees, in the opening buds and the\ndelicate flowers. All speak to us of God. The Sabbath, ever pointing\nto Him who made them all, bids men open the great book of nature\nand trace therein the wisdom, the power, and the love of the Creator.\nOur first parents, though created innocent and holy, were not\nplaced beyond the possibility of wrongdoing. God made them free\nmoral agents, capable of appreciating the wisdom and benevolence\nof His character and the justice of His requirements, and with full\nliberty to yield or to withhold obedience. They were to enjoy com-\nmunion with God and with holy angels; but before they could be\nrendered eternally secure, their loyalty must be tested. At the very\nbeginning of man\u2019s existence a check was placed upon the desire\nfor self-indulgence, the fatal passion that lay at the foundation of\nSatan\u2019s fall. The tree of knowledge, which stood near the tree of\nlife in the midst of the garden, was to be a test of the obedience,[49]\nfaith, and love of our parents. While permitted to eat freely of every\nother tree, they were forbidden to taste of this, on pain of death.\nCreation 33\nThey were also to be exposed to the temptations of Satan; but if they\nendured the trial, they would finally be placed beyond his power, to\nenjoy perpetual favor with God.\nGod placed man under law, as an indispensable condition of his\nvery existence. He was a subject of the divine government, and there\ncan be no government without law. God might have created man\nwithout the power to transgress His law; He might have withheld\nthe hand of Adam from touching the forbidden fruit; but in that case\nman would have been, not a free moral agent, but a mere automaton.\nWithout freedom of choice, his obedience would not have been\nvoluntary, but forced. There could have been no development of\ncharacter. Such a course would have been contrary to God\u2019s plan\nin dealing with the inhabitants of other worlds. It would have been\nunworthy of man as an intelligent being, and would have sustained\nSatan\u2019s charge of God\u2019s arbitrary rule.\nGod made man upright; He gave him noble traits of character,\nwith no bias toward evil. He endowed him with high intellectual\npowers, and presented before him the strongest possible inducements\nto be true to his allegiance. Obedience, perfect and perpetual, was\nthe condition of eternal happiness. On this condition he was to have\naccess to the tree of life.\nThe home of our first parents was to be a pattern for other homes\nas their children should go forth to occupy the earth. That home,\nbeautified by the hand of God Himself, was not a gorgeous palace.\nMen, in their pride, delight in magnificent and costly edifices and\nglory in the works of their own hands; but God placed Adam in a\ngarden. This was his dwelling. The blue heavens were its dome;\nthe earth, with its delicate flowers and carpet of living green, was\nits floor; and the leafy branches of the goodly trees were its canopy.\nIts walls were hung with the most magnificent adornings\u2014the hand-\niwork of the great Master Artist. In the surroundings of the holy\npair was a lesson for all time\u2014that true happiness is found, not in\nthe indulgence of pride and luxury, but in communion with God\nthrough His created works. If men would give less attention to the\nartificial, and would cultivate greater simplicity, they would come\nfar nearer to answering the purpose of God in their creation. Pride [50]\nand ambition are never satisfied, but those who are truly wise will\n34 Patriarchs and Prophets\nfind substantial and elevating pleasure in the sources of enjoyment\nthat God has placed within the reach of all.\nTo the dwellers in Eden was committed the care of the garden,\n\u201cto dress it and to keep it.\u201d Their occupation was not wearisome,\nbut pleasant and invigorating. God appointed labor as a blessing to\nman, to occupy his mind, to strengthen his body, and to develop his\nfaculties. In mental and physical activity Adam found one of the\nhighest pleasures of his holy existence. And when, as a result of his\ndisobedience, he was driven from his beautiful home, and forced to\nstruggle with a stubborn soil to gain his daily bread, that very labor,\nalthough widely different from his pleasant occupation in the garden,\nwas a safeguard against temptation and a source of happiness. Those\nwho regard work as a curse, attended though it be with weariness\nand pain, are cherishing an error. The rich often look down with\ncontempt upon the working classes, but this is wholly at variance\nwith God\u2019s purpose in creating man. What are the possessions of\neven the most wealthy in comparison with the heritage given to\nthe lordly Adam? Yet Adam was not to be idle. Our Creator, who\nunderstands what is for man\u2019s happiness, appointed Adam his work.\nThe true joy of life is found only by the working men and women.\nThe angels are diligent workers; they are the ministers of God to\nthe children of men. The Creator has prepared no place for the\nstagnating practice of indolence.\nWhile they remained true to God, Adam and his companion were\nto bear rule over the earth. Unlimited control was given them over\nevery living thing. The lion and the lamb sported peacefully around\nthem or lay down together at their feet. The happy birds flitted about\nthem without fear; and as their glad songs ascended to the praise of\ntheir Creator, Adam and Eve united with them in thanksgiving to\nthe Father and the Son.\nThe holy pair were not only children under the fatherly care\nof God but students receiving instruction from the all-wise Creator.\nThey were visited by angels, and were granted communion with their\nMaker, with no obscuring veil between. They were full of the vigor\nimparted by the tree of life, and their intellectual power was but little\nless than that of the angels. The mysteries of the visible universe\u2014\n\u201cthe wondrous works of Him which is perfect in knowledge\u201d (Job[51]\n37:16)\u2014afforded them an exhaustless source of instruction and\nCreation 35\ndelight. The laws and operations of nature, which have engaged\nmen\u2019s study for six thousand years, were opened to their minds by\nthe infinite Framer and Upholder of all. They held converse with leaf\nand flower and tree, gathering from each the secrets of its life. With\nevery living creature, from the mighty leviathan that playeth among\nthe waters to the insect mote that floats in the sunbeam, Adam was\nfamiliar. He had given to each its name, and he was acquainted\nwith the nature and habits of all. God\u2019s glory in the heavens, the\ninnumerable worlds in their orderly revolutions, \u201cthe balancings of\nthe clouds,\u201d the mysteries of light and sound, of day and night\u2014all\nwere open to the study of our first parents. On every leaf of the\nforest or stone of the mountains, in every shining star, in earth and\nair and sky, God\u2019s name was written. The order and harmony of\ncreation spoke to them of infinite wisdom and power. They were\never discovering some attraction that filled their hearts with deeper\nlove and called forth fresh expressions of gratitude.\nSo long as they remained loyal to the divine law, their capacity\nto know, to enjoy, and to love would continually increase. They\nwould be constantly gaining new treasures of knowledge, discover-\ning fresh springs of happiness, and obtaining clearer and yet clearer\nconceptions of the immeasurable, unfailing love of God.\nChapter 3\u2014The Temptation and Fall[52]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 3.\nNo longer free to stir up rebellion in heaven, Satan\u2019s enmity\nagainst God found a new field in plotting the ruin of the human\nrace. In the happiness and peace of the holy pair in Eden he beheld\na vision of the bliss that to him was forever lost. Moved by envy,\nhe determined to incite them to disobedience, and bring upon them\nthe guilt and penalty of sin. He would change their love to distrust\nand their songs of praise to reproaches against their Maker. Thus he\nwould not only plunge these innocent beings into the same misery\nwhich he was himself enduring, but would cast dishonor upon God,\nand cause grief in heaven.\nOur first parents were not left without a warning of the danger\nthat threatened them. Heavenly messengers opened to them the\nhistory of Satan\u2019s fall and his plots for their destruction, unfolding\nmore fully the nature of the divine government, which the prince\nof evil was trying to overthrow. It was by disobedience to the just\ncommands of God that Satan and his host had fallen. How important,\nthen, that Adam and Eve should honor that law by which alone it\nwas possible for order and equity to be maintained.\nThe law of God is as sacred as God Himself. It is a revelation of\nHis will, a transcript of His character, the expression of divine love\nand wisdom. The harmony of creation depends upon the perfect\nconformity of all beings, of everything, animate and inanimate, to\nthe law of the Creator. God has ordained laws for the government,\nnot only of living beings, but of all the operations of nature. Every-\nthing is under fixed laws, which cannot be disregarded. But while\neverything in nature is governed by natural laws, man alone, of\nall that inhabits the earth, is amenable to moral law. To man, the\ncrowning work of creation, God has given power to understand His\nrequirements, to comprehend the justice and beneficence of His law,\n36\nTemptation and Fall 37\nand its sacred claims upon him; and of man unswerving obedience\nis required.\nLike the angels, the dwellers in Eden had been placed upon [53]\nprobation; their happy estate could be retained only on condition of\nfidelity to the Creator\u2019s law. They could obey and live, or disobey\nand perish. God had made them the recipients of rich blessings; but\nshould they disregard His will, He who spared not the angels that\nsinned, could not spare them; transgression would forfeit His gifts\nand bring upon them misery and ruin.\nThe angels warned them to be on their guard against the devices\nof Satan, for his efforts to ensnare them would be unwearied. While\nthey were obedient to God the evil one could not harm them; for, if\nneed be, every angel in heaven would be sent to their help. If they\nsteadfastly repelled his first insinuations, they would be as secure as\nthe heavenly messengers. But should they once yield to temptation,\ntheir nature would become so depraved that in themselves they would\nhave no power and no disposition to resist Satan.\nThe tree of knowledge had been made a test of their obedience\nand their love to God. The Lord had seen fit to lay upon them but\none prohibition as to the use of all that was in the garden; but if\nthey should disregard His will in this particular, they would incur the\nguilt of transgression. Satan was not to follow them with continual\ntemptations; he could have access to them only at the forbidden\ntree. Should they attempt to investigate its nature, they would be\nexposed to his wiles. They were admonished to give careful heed\nto the warning which God had sent them and to be content with the\ninstruction which He had seen fit to impart.\nIn order to accomplish his work unperceived, Satan chose to\nemploy as his medium the serpent\u2014a disguise well adapted for\nhis purpose of deception. The serpent was then one of the wisest\nand most beautiful creatures on the earth. It had wings, and while\nflying through the air presented an appearance of dazzling brightness,\nhaving the color and brilliancy of burnished gold. Resting in the\nrich-laden branches of the forbidden tree and regaling itself with the\ndelicious fruit, it was an object to arrest the attention and delight the\neye of the beholder. Thus in the garden of peace lurked the destroyer,\nwatching for his prey.\n38 Patriarchs and Prophets\nThe angels had cautioned Eve to beware of separating herself\nfrom her husband while occupied in their daily labor in the garden;\nwith him she would be in less danger from temptation than if she\nwere alone. But absorbed in her pleasing task, she unconsciously[54]\nwandered from his side. On perceiving that she was alone, she felt\nan apprehension of danger, but dismissed her fears, deciding that she\nhad sufficient wisdom and strength to discern evil and to withstand\nit. Unmindful of the angels\u2019 caution, she soon found herself gazing\nwith mingled curiosity and admiration upon the forbidden tree. The\nfruit was very beautiful, and she questioned with herself why God\nhad withheld it from them. Now was the tempter\u2019s opportunity. As\nif he were able to discern the workings of her mind, he addressed\nher: \u201cYea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the gar-\nden?\u201d Eve was surprised and startled as she thus seemed to hear\nthe echo of her thoughts. But the serpent continued, in a musical\nvoice, with subtle praise of her surpassing loveliness; and his words\nwere not displeasing. Instead of fleeing from the spot she lingered\nwonderingly to hear a serpent speak. Had she been addressed by a\nbeing like the angels, her fears would have been excited; but she had\nno thought that the fascinating serpent could become the medium of\nthe fallen foe.\nTo the tempter\u2019s ensnaring question she replied: \u201cWe may eat of\nthe fruit of the trees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which\nis in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it,\nneither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the\nwoman, Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day\nye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as\ngods, knowing good and evil.\u201d\nBy partaking of this tree, he declared, they would attain to a more\nexalted sphere of existence and enter a broader field of knowledge.\nHe himself had eaten of the forbidden fruit, and as a result had\nacquired the power of speech. And he insinuated that the Lord\njealously desired to withhold it from them, lest they should be exalted\nto equality with Himself. It was because of its wonderful properties,\nimparting wisdom and power, that He had prohibited them from\ntasting or even touching it. The tempter intimated that the divine\nwarning was not to be actually fulfilled; it was designed merely to\nintimidate them. How could it be possible for them to die? Had they\nTemptation and Fall 39\nnot eaten of the tree of life? God had been seeking to prevent them\nfrom reaching a nobler development and finding greater happiness.\nSuch has been Satan\u2019s work from the days of Adam to the\npresent, and he has pursued it with great success. He tempts men\nto distrust God\u2019s love and to doubt His wisdom. He is constantly\nseeking to excite a spirit of irreverent curiosity, a restless, inquisi- [55]\ntive desire to penetrate the secrets of divine wisdom and power. In\ntheir efforts to search out what God has been pleased to withhold,\nmultitudes overlook the truths which He has revealed, and which are\nessential to salvation. Satan tempts men to disobedience by leading\nthem to believe they are entering a wonderful field of knowledge.\nBut this is all a deception. Elated with their ideas of progression,\nthey are, by trampling on God\u2019s requirements, setting their feet in\nthe path that leads to degradation and death.\nSatan represented to the holy pair that they would be gainers by\nbreaking the law of God. Do we not today hear similar reasoning?\nMany talk of the narrowness of those who obey God\u2019s command-\nments, while they themselves claim to have broader ideas and to\nenjoy greater liberty. What is this but an echo of the voice from\nEden, \u201cIn the day ye eat thereof\u201d\u2014transgress the divine require-\nment\u2014\u201cye shall be as gods\u201d? Satan claimed to have received great\ngood by eating of the forbidden fruit, but he did not let it appear that\nby transgression he had become an outcast from heaven. Though\nhe had found sin to result in infinite loss, he concealed his own\nmisery in order to draw others into the same position. So now the\ntransgressor seeks to disguise his true character; he may claim to be\nholy; but his exalted profession only makes him the more dangerous\nas a deceiver. He is on the side of Satan, trampling upon the law of\nGod, and leading others to do the same, to their eternal ruin.\nEve really believed the words of Satan, but her belief did not\nsave her from the penalty of sin. She disbelieved the words of God,\nand this was what led to her fall. In the judgment men will not be\ncondemned because they conscientiously believed a lie, but because\nthey did not believe the truth, because they neglected the opportunity\nof learning what is truth. Notwithstanding the sophistry of Satan\nto the contrary, it is always disastrous to disobey God. We must\nset our hearts to know what is truth. All the lessons which God has\ncaused to be placed on record in His word are for our warning and\n40 Patriarchs and Prophets\ninstruction. They are given to save us from deception. Their neglect\nwill result in ruin to ourselves. Whatever contradicts God\u2019s word,\nwe may be sure proceeds from Satan.\nThe serpent plucked the fruit of the forbidden tree and placed\nit in the hands of the half-reluctant Eve. Then he reminded her\nof her own words, that God had forbidden them to touch it, lest[56]\nthey die. She would receive no more harm from eating the fruit,\nhe declared, than from touching it. Perceiving no evil results from\nwhat she had done, Eve grew bolder. When she \u201csaw that the tree\nwas good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to\nbe desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did\neat.\u201d It was grateful to the taste, and as she ate, she seemed to feel a\nvivifying power, and imagined herself entering upon a higher state\nof existence. Without a fear she plucked and ate. And now, having\nherself transgressed, she became the agent of Satan in working the\nruin of her husband. In a state of strange, unnatural excitement, with\nher hands filled with the forbidden fruit, she sought his presence,\nand related all that had occurred.\nAn expression of sadness came over the face of Adam. He\nappeared astonished and alarmed. To the words of Eve he replied\nthat this must be the foe against whom they had been warned; and\nby the divine sentence she must die. In answer she urged him to eat,\nrepeating the words of the serpent, that they should not surely die.\nShe reasoned that this must be true, for she felt no evidence of God\u2019s\ndispleasure, but on the contrary realized a delicious, exhilarating\ninfluence, thrilling every faculty with new life, such, she imagined,\nas inspired the heavenly messengers.\nAdam understood that his companion had transgressed the com-\nmand of God, disregarded the only prohibition laid upon them as\na test of their fidelity and love. There was a terrible struggle in his\nmind. He mourned that he had permitted Eve to wander from his\nside. But now the deed was done; he must be separated from her\nwhose society had been his joy. How could he have it thus? Adam\nhad enjoyed the companionship of God and of holy angels. He had\nlooked upon the glory of the Creator. He understood the high destiny\nopened to the human race should they remain faithful to God. Yet\nall these blessings were lost sight of in the fear of losing that one\ngift which in his eyes outvalued every other. Love, gratitude, loyalty\nTemptation and Fall 41\nto the Creator\u2014all were overborne by love to Eve. She was a part\nof himself, and he could not endure the thought of separation. He\ndid not realize that the same Infinite Power who had from the dust\nof the earth created him, a living, beautiful form, and had in love\ngiven him a companion, could supply her place. He resolved to\nshare her fate; if she must die, he would die with her. After all,\nhe reasoned, might not the words of the wise serpent be true? Eve [57]\nwas before him, as beautiful and apparently as innocent as before\nthis act of disobedience. She expressed greater love for him than\nbefore. No sign of death appeared in her, and he decided to brave\nthe consequences. He seized the fruit and quickly ate.\nAfter his transgression Adam at first imagined himself entering\nupon a higher state of existence. But soon the thought of his sin\nfilled him with terror. The air, which had hitherto been of a mild and\nuniform temperature, seemed to chill the guilty pair. The love and\npeace which had been theirs was gone, and in its place they felt a\nsense of sin, a dread of the future, a nakedness of soul. The robe of\nlight which had enshrouded them, now disappeared, and to supply its\nplace they endeavored to fashion for themselves a covering; for they\ncould not, while unclothed, meet the eye of God and holy angels.\nThey now began to see the true character of their sin. Adam\nreproached his companion for her folly in leaving his side and per-\nmitting herself to be deceived by the serpent; but they both flattered\nthemselves that He who had given them so many evidences of His\nlove, would pardon this one transgression, or that they would not be\nsubjected to so dire a punishment as they had feared.\nSatan exulted in his success. He had tempted the woman to\ndistrust God\u2019s love, to doubt His wisdom, and to transgress His law,\nand through her he had caused the overthrow of Adam.\nBut the great Lawgiver was about to make known to Adam and\nEve the consequences of their transgression. The divine presence\nwas manifested in the garden. In their innocence and holiness they\nhad joyfully welcomed the approach of their Creator; but now they\nfled in terror, and sought to hide in the deepest recesses of the garden.\nBut \u201cthe Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where\nart thou? And he said, I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was\nafraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. And He said, Who\n42 Patriarchs and Prophets\ntold thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof\nI commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?\u201d\nAdam could neither deny nor excuse his sin; but instead of man-\nifesting penitence, he endeavored to cast the blame upon his wife,\nand thus upon God Himself: \u201cThe woman whom Thou gavest to\nbe with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.\u201d He who, from\nlove to Eve, had deliberately chosen to forfeit the approval of God,[58]\nhis home in Paradise, and an eternal life of joy, could now, after his\nfall, endeavor to make his companion, and even the Creator Himself,\nresponsible for the transgression. So terrible is the power of sin.\nWhen the woman was asked, \u201cWhat is this that thou hast done?\u201d\nshe answered, \u201cThe serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\u201d \u201cWhy\ndidst Thou create the serpent? Why didst Thou suffer him to enter\nEden?\u201d\u2014these were the questions implied in her excuse for her\nsin. Thus, like Adam, she charged God with the responsibility of\ntheir fall. The spirit of self-justification originated in the father of\nlies; it was indulged by our first parents as soon as they yielded\nto the influence of Satan, and has been exhibited by all the sons\nand daughters of Adam. Instead of humbly confessing their sins,\nthey try to shield themselves by casting the blame upon others,\nupon circumstances, or upon God\u2014making even His blessings an\noccasion of murmuring against Him.\nThe Lord then passed sentence upon the serpent: \u201cBecause thou\nhast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every\nbeast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou\neat all the days of thy life.\u201d Since it had been employed as Satan\u2019s\nmedium, the serpent was to share the visitation of divine judgment.\nFrom the most beautiful and admired of the creatures of the field, it\nwas to become the most groveling and detested of them all, feared\nand hated by both man and beast. The words next addressed to the\nserpent applied directly to Satan himself, pointing forward to his\nultimate defeat and destruction: \u201cI will put enmity between thee and\nthe woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy\nhead, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\u201d\nEve was told of the sorrow and pain that must henceforth be her\nportion. And the Lord said, \u201cThy desire shall be to thy husband, and\nhe shall rule over thee.\u201d In the creation God had made her the equal\nof Adam. Had they remained obedient to God\u2014in harmony with His\nTemptation and Fall 43\ngreat law of love\u2014they would ever have been in harmony with each\nother; but sin had brought discord, and now their union could be\nmaintained and harmony preserved only by submission on the part\nof the one or the other. Eve had been the first in transgression; and\nshe had fallen into temptation by separating from her companion,\ncontrary to the divine direction. It was by her solicitation that Adam\nsinned, and she was now placed in subjection to her husband. Had\nthe principles enjoined in the law of God been cherished by the fallen [59]\nrace, this sentence, though growing out of the results of sin, would\nhave proved a blessing to them; but man\u2019s abuse of the supremacy\nthus given him has too often rendered the lot of woman very bitter\nand made her life a burden.\nEve had been perfectly happy by her husband\u2019s side in her Eden\nhome; but, like restless modern Eves, she was flattered with the\nhope of entering a higher sphere than that which God had assigned\nher. In attempting to rise above her original position, she fell far\nbelow it. A similar result will be reached by all who are unwilling\nto take up cheerfully their life duties in accordance with God\u2019s plan.\nIn their efforts to reach positions for which He has not fitted them,\nmany are leaving vacant the place where they might be a blessing. In\ntheir desire for a higher sphere, many have sacrificed true womanly\ndignity and nobility of character, and have left undone the very work\nthat Heaven appointed them.\nTo Adam the Lord declared: \u201cBecause thou hast hearkened\nunto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I\ncommanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the\nground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of\nthy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou\nshalt eat the herb of the field; in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat\nbread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken:\nfor dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\u201d\nIt was not the will of God that the sinless pair should know aught\nof evil. He had freely given them the good, and had withheld the\nevil. But, contrary to His command, they had eaten of the forbidden\ntree, and now they would continue to eat of it\u2014they would have\nthe knowledge of evil\u2014all the days of their life. From that time the\nrace would be afflicted by Satan\u2019s temptations. Instead of the happy\nlabor heretofore appointed them, anxiety and toil were to be their\n44 Patriarchs and Prophets\nlot. They would be subject to disappointment, grief, and pain, and\nfinally to death.\nUnder the curse of sin all nature was to witness to man of the\ncharacter and results of rebellion against God. When God made man\nHe made him rule over the earth and all living creatures. So long as\nAdam remained loyal to Heaven, all nature was in subjection to him.\nBut when he rebelled against the divine law, the inferior creatures\nwere in rebellion against his rule. Thus the Lord, in His great mercy,[60]\nwould show men the sacredness of His law, and lead them, by their\nown experience, to see the danger of setting it aside, even in the\nslightest degree.\nAnd the life of toil and care which was henceforth to be man\u2019s\nlot was appointed in love. It was a discipline rendered needful by his\nsin, to place a check upon the indulgence of appetite and passion, to\ndevelop habits of self-control. It was a part of God\u2019s great plan of\nman\u2019s recovery from the ruin and degradation of sin.\nThe warning given to our first parents\u2014\u201cIn the day that thou\neatest thereof thou shalt surely die\u201d (Genesis 2:17)\u2014did not imply\nthat they were to die on the very day when they partook of the\nforbidden fruit. But on that day the irrevocable sentence would\nbe pronounced. Immortality was promised them on condition of\nobedience; by transgression they would forfeit eternal life. That very\nday they would be doomed to death.\nIn order to possess an endless existence, man must continue to\npartake of the tree of life. Deprived of this, his vitality would gradu-\nally diminish until life should become extinct. It was Satan\u2019s plan\nthat Adam and Eve should by disobedience incur God\u2019s displeasure;\nand then, if they failed to obtain forgiveness, he hoped that they\nwould eat of the tree of life, and thus perpetuate an existence of\nsin and misery. But after man\u2019s fall, holy angels were immediately\ncommissioned to guard the tree of life. Around these angels flashed\nbeams of light having the appearance of a glittering sword. None of\nthe family of Adam were permitted to pass the barrier to partake of\nthe life-giving fruit; hence there is not an immortal sinner.\nThe tide of woe that flowed from the transgression of our first\nparents is regarded by many as too awful a consequence for so\nsmall a sin, and they impeach the wisdom and justice of God in\nHis dealings with man. But if they would look more deeply into\nTemptation and Fall 45\nthis question, they might discern their error. God created man after\nHis own likeness, free from sin. The earth was to be peopled with\nbeings only a little lower than the angels; but their obedience must\nbe tested; for God would not permit the world to be filled with those\nwho would disregard His law. Yet, in His great mercy, He appointed\nAdam no severe test. And the very lightness of the prohibition made\nthe sin exceedingly great. If Adam could not bear the smallest of\ntests, he could not have endured a greater trial had he been entrusted [61]\nwith higher responsibilities.\nHad some great test been appointed Adam, then those whose\nhearts incline to evil would have excused themselves by saying,\n\u201cThis is a trivial matter, and God is not so particular about little\nthings.\u201d And there would be continual transgression in things looked\nupon as small, and which pass unrebuked among men. But the Lord\nhas made it evident that sin in any degree is offensive to Him.\nTo Eve it seemed a small thing to disobey God by tasting the fruit\nof the forbidden tree, and to tempt her husband also to transgress;\nbut their sin opened the floodgates of woe upon the world. Who can\nknow, in the moment of temptation, the terrible consequences that\nwill result from one wrong step?\nMany who teach that the law of God is not binding upon man,\nurge that it is impossible for him to obey its precepts. But if this\nwere true, why did Adam suffer the penalty of transgression? The\nsin of our first parents brought guilt and sorrow upon the world, and\nhad it not been for the goodness and mercy of God, would have\nplunged the race into hopeless despair. Let none deceive themselves.\n\u201cThe wages of sin is death.\u201d Romans 6:23. The law of God can no\nmore be transgressed with impunity now than when sentence was\npronounced upon the father of mankind.\nAfter their sin Adam and Eve were no longer to dwell in Eden.\nThey earnestly entreated that they might remain in the home of their\ninnocence and joy. They confessed that they had forfeited all right\nto that happy abode, but pledged themselves for the future to yield\nstrict obedience to God. But they were told that their nature had\nbecome depraved by sin; they had lessened their strength to resist\nevil and had opened the way for Satan to gain more ready access to\nthem. In their innocence they had yielded to temptation; and now, in\n46 Patriarchs and Prophets\na state of conscious guilt, they would have less power to maintain\ntheir integrity.\nIn humility and unutterable sadness they bade farewell to their\nbeautiful home and went forth to dwell upon the earth, where rested\nthe curse of sin. The atmosphere, once so mild and uniform in\ntemperature, was now subject to marked changes, and the Lord\nmercifully provided them with a garment of skins as a protection\nfrom the extremes of heat and cold.\nAs they witnessed in drooping flower and falling leaf the first[62]\nsigns of decay, Adam and his companion mourned more deeply than\nmen now mourn over their dead. The death of the frail, delicate\nflowers was indeed a cause of sorrow; but when the goodly trees\ncast off their leaves, the scene brought vividly to mind the stern fact\nthat death is the portion of every living thing.\nThe Garden of Eden remained upon the earth long after man\nhad become an outcast from its pleasant paths. The fallen race were\nlong permitted to gaze upon the home of innocence, their entrance\nbarred only by the watching angels. At the cherubim-guarded gate\nof Paradise the divine glory was revealed. Hither came Adam and\nhis sons to worship God. Here they renewed their vows of obedience\nto that law the transgression of which had banished them from Eden.\nWhen the tide of iniquity overspread the world, and the wickedness\nof men determined their destruction by a flood of waters, the hand\nthat had planted Eden withdrew it from the earth. But in the final\nrestitution, when there shall be \u201ca new heaven and a new earth\u201d\n(Revelation 21:1), it is to be restored more gloriously adorned than\nat the beginning.\nThen they that have kept God\u2019s commandments shall breathe\nin immortal vigor beneath the tree of life; and through unending\nages the inhabitants of sinless worlds shall behold, in that garden of\ndelight, a sample of the perfect work of God\u2019s creation, untouched\nby the curse of sin\u2014a sample of what the whole earth would have\nbecome, had man but fulfilled the Creator\u2019s glorious plan.\nChapter 4\u2014The Plan of Redemption [63]\nThe fall of man filled all heaven with sorrow. The world that\nGod had made was blighted with the curse of sin and inhabited by\nbeings doomed to misery and death. There appeared no escape for\nthose who had transgressed the law. Angels ceased their songs of\npraise. Throughout the heavenly courts there was mourning for the\nruin that sin had wrought.\nThe Son of God, heaven\u2019s glorious Commander, was touched\nwith pity for the fallen race. His heart was moved with infinite\ncompassion as the woes of the lost world rose up before Him. But\ndivine love had conceived a plan whereby man might be redeemed.\nThe broken law of God demanded the life of the sinner. In all the\nuniverse there was but one who could, in behalf of man, satisfy its\nclaims. Since the divine law is as sacred as God Himself, only one\nequal with God could make atonement for its transgression. None\nbut Christ could redeem fallen man from the curse of the law and\nbring him again into harmony with Heaven. Christ would take upon\nHimself the guilt and shame of sin\u2014sin so offensive to a holy God\nthat it must separate the Father and His Son. Christ would reach to\nthe depths of misery to rescue the ruined race.\nBefore the Father He pleaded in the sinner\u2019s behalf, while the\nhost of heaven awaited the result with an intensity of interest that\nwords cannot express. Long continued was that mysterious com-\nmuning\u2014\u201cthe counsel of peace\u201d (Zechariah 6:13) for the fallen sons\nof men. The plan of salvation had been laid before the creation of\nthe earth; for Christ is \u201cthe Lamb slain from the foundation of the\nworld\u201d (Revelation 13:8); yet it was a struggle, even with the King\nof the universe, to yield up His Son to die for the guilty race. But\n\u201cGod so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that\nwhosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting\nlife.\u201d John 3:16. Oh, the mystery of redemption! the love of God [64]\nfor a world that did not love Him! Who can know the depths of that\nlove which \u201cpasseth knowledge\u201d? Through endless ages immortal\n47\n48 Patriarchs and Prophets\nminds, seeking to comprehend the mystery of that incomprehensible\nlove, will wonder and adore.\nGod was to be manifest in Christ, \u201creconciling the world unto\nHimself.\u201d 2 Corinthians 5:19. Man had become so degraded by sin\nthat it was impossible for him, in himself, to come into harmony\nwith Him whose nature is purity and goodness. But Christ, after\nhaving redeemed man from the condemnation of the law, could\nimpart divine power to unite with human effort. Thus by repentance\ntoward God and faith in Christ the fallen children of Adam might\nonce more become \u201csons of God.\u201d 1 John 3:2.\nThe plan by which alone man\u2019s salvation could be secured, in-\nvolved all heaven in its infinite sacrifice. The angels could not rejoice\nas Christ opened before them the plan of redemption, for they saw\nthat man\u2019s salvation must cost their loved Commander unutterable\nwoe. In grief and wonder they listened to His words as He told them\nhow He must descend from heaven\u2019s purity and peace, its joy and\nglory and immortal life, and come in contact with the degradation\nof earth, to endure its sorrow, shame, and death. He was to stand\nbetween the sinner and the penalty of sin; yet few would receive\nHim as the Son of God. He would leave His high position as the\nMajesty of heaven, appear upon earth and humble Himself as a man,\nand by His own experience become acquainted with the sorrows and\ntemptations which man would have to endure. All this would be\nnecessary in order that He might be able to succor them that should\nbe tempted. Hebrews 2:18. When His mission as a teacher should\nbe ended, He must be delivered into the hands of wicked men and\nbe subjected to every insult and torture that Satan could inspire them\nto inflict. He must die the cruelest of deaths, lifted up between the\nheavens and the earth as a guilty sinner. He must pass long hours\nof agony so terrible that angels could not look upon it, but would\nveil their faces from the sight. He must endure anguish of soul, the\nhiding of His Father\u2019s face, while the guilt of transgression\u2014the\nweight of the sins of the whole world\u2014should be upon Him.\nThe angels prostrated themselves at the feet of their Commander\nand offered to become a sacrifice for man. But an angel\u2019s life could[65]\nnot pay the debt; only He who created man had power to redeem him.\nYet the angels were to have a part to act in the plan of redemption.\nChrist was to be made \u201ca little lower than the angels for the suffering\nPlan of Redemption 49\nof death.\u201d Hebrews 2:9. As He should take human nature upon Him,\nHis strength would not be equal to theirs, and they were to minister\nto Him, to strengthen and soothe Him under His sufferings. They\nwere also to be ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them\nwho should be heirs of salvation. Hebrews 1:14. They would guard\nthe subjects of grace from the power of evil angels and from the\ndarkness constantly thrown around them by Satan.\nWhen the angels should witness the agony and humiliation of\ntheir Lord, they would be filled with grief and indignation and would\nwish to deliver Him from His murderers; but they were not to inter-\npose in order to prevent anything which they should behold. It was a\npart of the plan of redemption that Christ should suffer the scorn and\nabuse of wicked men, and He consented to all this when He became\nthe Redeemer of man.\nChrist assured the angels that by His death He would ransom\nmany, and would destroy him who had the power of death. He would\nrecover the kingdom which man had lost by transgression, and the\nredeemed were to inherit it with Him, and dwell therein forever. Sin\nand sinners would be blotted out, nevermore to disturb the peace\nof heaven or earth. He bade the angelic host to be in accord with\nthe plan that His Father had accepted, and rejoice that, through His\ndeath, fallen man could be reconciled to God.\nThen joy, inexpressible joy, filled heaven. The glory and blessed-\nness of a world redeemed, outmeasured even the anguish and sac-\nrifice of the Prince of life. Through the celestial courts echoed the\nfirst strains of that song which was to ring out above the hills of\nBethlehem\u2014\u201cGlory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good\nwill toward men.\u201d Luke 2:14. With a deeper gladness now than in\nthe rapture of the new creation, \u201cthe morning stars sang together,\nand all the sons of God shouted for joy.\u201d Job 38:7.\nTo man the first intimation of redemption was communicated in\nthe sentence pronounced upon Satan in the garden. The Lord de-\nclared, \u201cI will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between\nthy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise\nhis heel.\u201d Genesis 3:15. This sentence, uttered in the hearing of our [66]\nfirst parents, was to them a promise. While it foretold war between\nman and Satan, it declared that the power of the great adversary\nwould finally be broken. Adam and Eve stood as criminals before\n50 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe righteous Judge, awaiting the sentence which transgression had\nincurred; but before they heard of the life of toil and sorrow which\nmust be their portion, or of the decree that they must return to dust,\nthey listened to words that could not fail to give them hope. Though\nthey must suffer from the power of their mighty foe, they could look\nforward to final victory.\nWhen Satan heard that enmity should exist between himself and\nthe woman, and between his seed and her seed, he knew that his\nwork of depraving human nature would be interrupted; that by some\nmeans man would be enabled to resist his power. Yet as the plan of\nsalvation was more fully unfolded, Satan rejoiced with his angels\nthat, having caused man\u2019s fall, he could bring down the Son of God\nfrom His exalted position. He declared that his plans had thus far\nbeen successful upon the earth, and that when Christ should take\nupon Himself human nature, He also might be overcome, and thus\nthe redemption of the fallen race might be prevented.\nHeavenly angels more fully opened to our first parents the plan\nthat had been devised for their salvation. Adam and his companion\nwere assured that notwithstanding their great sin, they were not to\nbe abandoned to the control of Satan. The Son of God had offered\nto atone, with His own life, for their transgression. A period of\nprobation would be granted them, and through repentance and faith\nin Christ they might again become the children of God.\nThe sacrifice demanded by their transgression revealed to Adam\nand Eve the sacred character of the law of God; and they saw, as\nthey had never seen before, the guilt of sin and its dire results. In\ntheir remorse and anguish they pleaded that the penalty might not\nfall upon Him whose love had been the source of all their joy; rather\nlet it descend upon them and their posterity.\nThey were told that since the law of Jehovah is the foundation\nof His government in heaven as well as upon the earth, even the life\nof an angel could not be accepted as a sacrifice for its transgression.\nNot one of its precepts could be abrogated or changed to meet man\nin his fallen condition; but the Son of God, who had created man,\ncould make an atonement for him. As Adam\u2019s transgression had[67]\nbrought wretchedness and death, so the sacrifice of Christ would\nbring life and immortality.\nPlan of Redemption 51\nNot only man but the earth had by sin come under the power of\nthe wicked one, and was to be restored by the plan of redemption.\nAt his creation Adam was placed in dominion over the earth. But by\nyielding to temptation, he was brought under the power of Satan. \u201cOf\nwhom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.\u201d 2\nPeter 2:19. When man became Satan\u2019s captive, the dominion which\nhe held, passed to his conqueror. Thus Satan became \u201cthe god of this\nworld.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:4. He had usurped that dominion over the\nearth which had been originally given to Adam. But Christ, by His\nsacrifice paying the penalty of sin, would not only redeem man, but\nrecover the dominion which he had forfeited. All that was lost by\nthe first Adam will be restored by the second. Says the prophet, \u201cO\ntower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee\nshall it come, even the first dominion.\u201d Micah 4:8. And the apostle\nPaul points forward to the \u201credemption of the purchased possession.\u201d\nEphesians 1:14. God created the earth to be the abode of holy, happy\nbeings. The Lord \u201cformed the earth and made it; He hath established\nit, He created it not in vain, He formed it to be inhabited.\u201d Isaiah\n45:18. That purpose will be fulfilled, when, renewed by the power\nof God, and freed from sin and sorrow, it shall become the eternal\nabode of the redeemed. \u201cThe righteous shall inherit the land, and\ndwell therein forever.\u201d \u201cAnd there shall be no more curse: but the\nthrone of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and His servants shall\nserve Him.\u201d Psalm 37:29; Revelation 22:3.\nAdam, in his innocence, had enjoyed open communion with his\nMaker; but sin brought separation between God and man, and the\natonement of Christ alone could span the abyss and make possible\nthe communication of blessing or salvation from heaven to earth.\nMan was still cut off from direct approach to his Creator, but God\nwould communicate with him through Christ and angels.\nThus were revealed to Adam important events in the history of\nmankind, from the time when the divine sentence was pronounced\nin Eden, to the Flood, and onward to the first advent of the Son\nof God. He was shown that while the sacrifice of Christ would be\nof sufficient value to save the whole world, many would choose a\nlife of sin rather than of repentance and obedience. Crime would [68]\nincrease through successive generations, and the curse of sin would\nrest more and more heavily upon the human race, upon the beasts,\n52 Patriarchs and Prophets\nand upon the earth. The days of man would be shortened by his own\ncourse of sin; he would deteriorate in physical stature and endurance\nand in moral and intellectual power, until the world would be filled\nwith misery of every type. Through the indulgence of appetite and\npassion men would become incapable of appreciating the great truths\nof the plan of redemption. Yet Christ, true to the purpose for which\nHe left heaven, would continue His interest in men, and still invite\nthem to hide their weakness and deficiencies in Him. He would\nsupply the needs of all who would come unto Him in faith. And\nthere would ever be a few who would preserve the knowledge of\nGod and would remain unsullied amid the prevailing iniquity.\nThe sacrificial offerings were ordained by God to be to man\na perpetual reminder and a penitential acknowledgment of his sin\nand a confession of his faith in the promised Redeemer. They were\nintended to impress upon the fallen race the solemn truth that it was\nsin that caused death. To Adam, the offering of the first sacrifice was\na most painful ceremony. His hand must be raised to take life, which\nonly God could give. It was the first time he had ever witnessed\ndeath, and he knew that had he been obedient to God, there would\nhave been no death of man or beast. As he slew the innocent victim,\nhe trembled at the thought that his sin must shed the blood of the\nspotless Lamb of God. This scene gave him a deeper and more\nvivid sense of the greatness of his transgression, which nothing but\nthe death of God\u2019s dear Son could expiate. And he marveled at the\ninfinite goodness that would give such a ransom to save the guilty.\nA star of hope illumined the dark and terrible future and relieved it\nof its utter desolation.\nBut the plan of redemption had a yet broader and deeper purpose\nthan the salvation of man. It was not for this alone that Christ came\nto the earth; it was not merely that the inhabitants of this little world\nmight regard the law of God as it should be regarded; but it was to\nvindicate the character of God before the universe. To this result\nof His great sacrifice\u2014its influence upon the intelligences of other\nworlds, as well as upon man\u2014the Saviour looked forward when\njust before His crucifixion He said: \u201cNow is the judgment of this\nworld: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I\nbe lifted up from the earth, will draw all unto Me.\u201d John 12:31, 32.[69]\nThe act of Christ in dying for the salvation of man would not only\nPlan of Redemption 53\nmake heaven accessible to men, but before all the universe it would\njustify God and His Son in their dealing with the rebellion of Satan.\nIt would establish the perpetuity of the law of God and would reveal\nthe nature and the results of sin.\nFrom the first the great controversy had been upon the law of\nGod. Satan had sought to prove that God was unjust, that His law was\nfaulty, and that the good of the universe required it to be changed. In\nattacking the law he aimed to overthrow the authority of its Author.\nIn the controversy it was to be shown whether the divine statutes\nwere defective and subject to change, or perfect and immutable.\nWhen Satan was thrust out of heaven, he determined to make the\nearth his kingdom. When he tempted and overcame Adam and Eve,\nhe thought that he had gained possession of this world; \u201cbecause,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cthey have chosen me as their ruler.\u201d He claimed that it\nwas impossible that forgiveness should be granted to the sinner, and\ntherefore the fallen race were his rightful subjects, and the world was\nhis. But God gave His own dear Son\u2014one equal with Himself\u2014to\nbear the penalty of transgression, and thus He provided a way by\nwhich they might be restored to His favor, and brought back to their\nEden home. Christ undertook to redeem man and to rescue the world\nfrom the grasp of Satan. The great controversy begun in heaven was\nto be decided in the very world, on the very same field, that Satan\nclaimed as his.\nIt was the marvel of all the universe that Christ should humble\nHimself to save fallen man. That He who had passed from star to\nstar, from world to world, superintending all, by His providence\nsupplying the needs of every order of being in His vast creation\u2014\nthat He should consent to leave His glory and take upon Himself\nhuman nature, was a mystery which the sinless intelligences of other\nworlds desired to understand. When Christ came to our world in the\nform of humanity, all were intensely interested in following Him as\nHe traversed, step by step, the bloodstained path from the manger to\nCalvary. Heaven marked the insult and mockery that He received,\nand knew that it was at Satan\u2019s instigation. They marked the work of\ncounteragencies going forward; Satan constantly pressing darkness,\nsorrow, and suffering upon the race, and Christ counteracting it.\nThey watched the battle between light and darkness as it waxed\nstronger. And as Christ in His expiring agony upon the cross cried [70]\n54 Patriarchs and Prophets\nout, \u201cIt is finished\u201d (John 19:30), a shout of triumph rang through\nevery world and through heaven itself. The great contest that had\nbeen so long in progress in this world was now decided, and Christ\nwas conqueror. His death had answered the question whether the\nFather and the Son had sufficient love for man to exercise self-denial\nand a spirit of sacrifice. Satan had revealed his true character as\na liar and a murderer. It was seen that the very same spirit with\nwhich he had ruled the children of men who were under his power,\nhe would have manifested if permitted to control the intelligences\nof heaven. With one voice the loyal universe united in extolling the\ndivine administration.\nIf the law could be changed, man might have been saved without\nthe sacrifice of Christ; but the fact that it was necessary for Christ to\ngive His life for the fallen race, proves that the law of God will not\nrelease the sinner from its claims upon him. It is demonstrated that\nthe wages of sin is death. When Christ died, the destruction of Satan\nwas made certain. But if the law was abolished at the cross, as many\nclaim, then the agony and death of God\u2019s dear Son were endured only\nto give to Satan just what he asked; then the prince of evil triumphed,\nhis charges against the divine government were sustained. The very\nfact that Christ bore the penalty of man\u2019s transgression is a mighty\nargument to all created intelligences that the law is changeless; that\nGod is righteous, merciful, and self-denying; and that infinite justice\nand mercy unite in the administration of His government.\nChapter 5\u2014Cain and Abel Tested [71]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 4:1-15.\nCain and Abel, the sons of Adam, differed widely in character.\nAbel had a spirit of loyalty to God; he saw justice and mercy in the\nCreator\u2019s dealings with the fallen race, and gratefully accepted the\nhope of redemption. But Cain cherished feelings of rebellion, and\nmurmured against God because of the curse pronounced upon the\nearth and upon the human race for Adam\u2019s sin. He permitted his\nmind to run in the same channel that led to Satan\u2019s fall\u2014indulging\nthe desire for self-exaltation and questioning the divine justice and\nauthority.\nThese brothers were tested, as Adam had been tested before\nthem, to prove whether they would believe and obey the word of\nGod. They were acquainted with the provision made for the salvation\nof man, and understood the system of offerings which God had\nordained. They knew that in these offerings they were to express\nfaith in the Saviour whom the offerings typified, and at the same\ntime to acknowledge their total dependence on Him for pardon;\nand they knew that by thus conforming to the divine plan for their\nredemption, they were giving proof of their obedience to the will of\nGod. Without the shedding of blood there could be no remission of\nsin; and they were to show their faith in the blood of Christ as the\npromised atonement by offering the firstlings of the flock in sacrifice.\nBesides this, the first fruits of the earth were to be presented before\nthe Lord as a thank offering.\nThe two brothers erected their altars alike, and each brought an\noffering. Abel presented a sacrifice from the flock, in accordance\nwith the Lord\u2019s directions. \u201cAnd the Lord had respect unto Abel and\nto his offering.\u201d Fire flashed from heaven and consumed the sacrifice.\nBut Cain, disregarding the Lord\u2019s direct and explicit command,\npresented only an offering of fruit. There was no token from heaven\nto show that it was accepted. Abel pleaded with his brother to [72]\n55\n56 Patriarchs and Prophets\napproach God in the divinely prescribed way, but his entreaties only\nmade Cain the more determined to follow his own will. As the\neldest, he felt above being admonished by his brother, and despised\nhis counsel.\nCain came before God with murmuring and infidelity in his heart\nin regard to the promised sacrifice and the necessity of the sacrificial\nofferings. His gift expressed no penitence for sin. He felt, as many\nnow feel, that it would be an acknowledgment of weakness to follow\nthe exact plan marked out by God, of trusting his salvation wholly\nto the atonement of the promised Saviour. He chose the course of\nself-dependence. He would come in his own merits. He would not\nbring the lamb, and mingle its blood with his offering, but would\npresent his fruits, the products of his labor. He presented his offering\nas a favor done to God, through which he expected to secure the\ndivine approval. Cain obeyed in building an altar, obeyed in bringing\na sacrifice; but he rendered only a partial obedience. The essential\npart, the recognition of the need of a Redeemer, was left out.\nSo far as birth and religious instruction were concerned, these\nbrothers were equal. Both were sinners, and both acknowledged the\nclaims of God to reverence and worship. To outward appearance\ntheir religion was the same up to a certain point, but beyond this the\ndifference between the two was great.\n\u201cBy faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than\nCain.\u201d Hebrews 11:4. Abel grasped the great principles of redemp-\ntion. He saw himself a sinner, and he saw sin and its penalty, death,\nstanding between his soul and communion with God. He brought\nthe slain victim, the sacrificed life, thus acknowledging the claims\nof the law that had been transgressed. Through the shed blood he\nlooked to the future sacrifice, Christ dying on the cross of Calvary;\nand trusting in the atonement that was there to be made, he had the\nwitness that he was righteous, and his offering accepted.\nCain had the same opportunity of learning and accepting these\ntruths as had Abel. He was not the victim of an arbitrary purpose.\nOne brother was not elected to be accepted of God, and the other\nto be rejected. Abel chose faith and obedience; Cain, unbelief and\nrebellion. Here the whole matter rested.\nCain and Abel represent two classes that will exist in the world\ntill the close of time. One class avail themselves of the appointed\nCain and Abel Tested 57\nsacrifice for sin; the other venture to depend upon their own merits; [73]\ntheirs is a sacrifice without the virtue of divine mediation, and thus\nit is not able to bring man into favor with God. It is only through\nthe merits of Jesus that our transgressions can be pardoned. Those\nwho feel no need of the blood of Christ, who feel that without divine\ngrace they can by their own works secure the approval of God, are\nmaking the same mistake as did Cain. If they do not accept the\ncleansing blood, they are under condemnation. There is no other\nprovision made whereby they can be released from the thralldom of\nsin.\nThe class of worshipers who follow the example of Cain includes\nby far the greater portion of the world; for nearly every false religion\nhas been based on the same principle\u2014that man can depend upon\nhis own efforts for salvation. It is claimed by some that the human\nrace is in need, not of redemption, but of development\u2014that it can\nrefine, elevate, and regenerate itself. As Cain thought to secure the\ndivine favor by an offering that lacked the blood of a sacrifice, so do\nthese expect to exalt humanity to the divine standard, independent of\nthe atonement. The history of Cain shows what must be the results.\nIt shows what man will become apart from Christ. Humanity has\nno power to regenerate itself. It does not tend upward, toward the\ndivine, but downward, toward the satanic. Christ is our only hope.\n\u201cThere is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby\nwe must be saved.\u201d \u201cNeither is there salvation in any other.\u201d Acts\n4:12.\nTrue faith, which relies wholly upon Christ, will be manifested\nby obedience to all the requirements of God. From Adam\u2019s day to the\npresent time the great controversy has been concerning obedience\nto God\u2019s law. In all ages there have been those who claimed a right\nto the favor of God even while they were disregarding some of His\ncommands. But the Scriptures declare that by works is \u201cfaith made\nperfect;\u201d and that, without the works of obedience, faith \u201cis dead.\u201d\nJames 2:22, 17. He that professes to know God, \u201cand keepeth not\nHis commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\u201d 1 John 2:4.\nWhen Cain saw that his offering was rejected, he was angry with\nthe Lord and with Abel; he was angry that God did not accept man\u2019s\nsubstitute in place of the sacrifice divinely ordained, and angry with\nhis brother for choosing to obey God instead of joining in rebellion [74]\n58 Patriarchs and Prophets\nagainst Him. Notwithstanding Cain\u2019s disregard of the divine com-\nmand, God did not leave him to himself; but He condescended to\nreason with the man who had shown himself so unreasonable. And\nthe Lord said unto Cain, \u201cWhy art thou wroth? and why is thy coun-\ntenance fallen?\u201d Through an angel messenger the divine warning\nwas conveyed: \u201cIf thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And\nif thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.\u201d The choice lay with Cain\nhimself. If he would trust to the merits of the promised Saviour,\nand would obey God\u2019s requirements, he would enjoy His favor. But\nshould he persist in unbelief and transgression, he would have no\nground for complaint because he was rejected by the Lord.\nBut instead of acknowledging his sin, Cain continued to com-\nplain of the injustice of God and to cherish jealousy and hatred of\nAbel. He angrily reproached his brother, and attempted to draw him\ninto controversy concerning God\u2019s dealings with them. In meekness,\nyet fearlessly and firmly, Abel defended the justice and goodness\nof God. He pointed out Cain\u2019s error, and tried to convince him that\nthe wrong was in himself. He pointed to the compassion of God in\nsparing the life of their parents when He might have punished them\nwith instant death, and urged that God loved them, or He would\nnot have given His Son, innocent and holy, to suffer the penalty\nwhich they had incurred. All this caused Cain\u2019s anger to burn the\nhotter. Reason and conscience told him that Abel was in the right;\nbut he was enraged that one who had been wont to heed his counsel\nshould now presume to disagree with him, and that he could gain\nno sympathy in his rebellion. In the fury of his passion he slew his\nbrother.\nCain hated and killed his brother, not for any wrong that Abel\nhad done, but \u201cbecause his own works were evil, and his brother\u2019s\nrighteous.\u201d 1 John 3:12. So in all ages the wicked have hated those\nwho were better than themselves. Abel\u2019s life of obedience and\nunswerving faith was to Cain a perpetual reproof. \u201cEveryone that\ndoeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds\nshould be reproved.\u201d John 3:20. The brighter the heavenly light that\nis reflected from the character of God\u2019s faithful servants, the more\nclearly the sins of the ungodly are revealed, and the more determined\nwill be their efforts to destroy those who disturb their peace.\nThe murder of Abel was the first example of the enmity that[75]\n[76]\n[77]\nCain and Abel Tested 59\nGod had declared would exist between the serpent and the seed\nof the woman\u2014between Satan and his subjects and Christ and His\nfollowers. Through man\u2019s sin, Satan had gained control of the human\nrace, but Christ would enable them to cast off his yoke. Whenever,\nthrough faith in the Lamb of God, a soul renounces the service\nof sin, Satan\u2019s wrath is kindled. The holy life of Abel testified\nagainst Satan\u2019s claim that it is impossible for man to keep God\u2019s\nlaw. When Cain, moved by the spirit of the wicked one, saw that\nhe could not control Abel, he was so enraged that he destroyed his\nlife. And wherever there are any who will stand in vindication of the\nrighteousness of the law of God, the same spirit will be manifested\nagainst them. It is the spirit that through all the ages has set up the\nstake and kindled the burning pile for the disciples of Christ. But\nthe cruelties heaped upon the follower of Jesus are instigated by\nSatan and his hosts because they cannot force him to submit to their\ncontrol. It is the rage of a vanquished foe. Every martyr of Jesus has\ndied a conqueror. Says the prophet, \u201cThey overcame him [\u201cthat old\nserpent, called the devil, and Satan\u201d] by the blood of the Lamb, and\nby the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto\nthe death.\u201d Revelation 12:11, 9.\nCain the murderer was soon called to answer for his crime. \u201cThe\nLord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I\nknow not: Am I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d Cain had gone so far in sin\nthat he had lost a sense of the continual presence of God and of His\ngreatness and omniscience. So he resorted to falsehood to conceal\nhis guilt.\nAgain the Lord said to Cain, \u201cWhat hast thou done? The voice\nof thy brother\u2019s blood crieth unto Me from the ground.\u201d God had\ngiven Cain an opportunity to confess his sin. He had had time to\nreflect. He knew the enormity of the deed he had done, and of the\nfalsehood he had uttered to conceal it; but he was rebellious still,\nand sentence was no longer deferred. The divine voice that had been\nheard in entreaty and admonition pronounced the terrible words:\n\u201cAnd now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her\nmouth to receive thy brother\u2019s blood from thy hand. When thou\ntillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength;\na fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.\u201d\nNotwithstanding that Cain had by his crimes merited the sentence [78]\n60 Patriarchs and Prophets\nof death, a merciful Creator still spared his life, and granted him\nopportunity for repentance. But Cain lived only to harden his heart,\nto encourage rebellion against the divine authority, and to become\nthe head of a line of bold, abandoned sinners. This one apostate,\nled on by Satan, became a tempter to others; and his example and\ninfluence exerted their demoralizing power, until the earth became\nso corrupt and filled with violence as to call for its destruction.\nIn sparing the life of the first murderer, God presented before\nthe whole universe a lesson bearing upon the great controversy.\nThe dark history of Cain and his descendants was an illustration\nof what would have been the result of permitting the sinner to live\non forever, to carry out his rebellion against God. The forbearance\nof God only rendered the wicked more bold and defiant in their\niniquity. Fifteen centuries after the sentence pronounced upon Cain,\nthe universe witnessed the fruition of his influence and example, in\nthe crime and pollution that flooded the earth. It was made manifest\nthat the sentence of death pronounced upon the fallen race for the\ntransgression of God\u2019s law was both just and merciful. The longer\nmen lived in sin, the more abandoned they became. The divine\nsentence cutting short a career of unbridled iniquity, and freeing\nthe world from the influence of those who had become hardened in\nrebellion, was a blessing rather than a curse.\nSatan is constantly at work, with intense energy and under a\nthousand disguises, to misrepresent the character and government of\nGod. With extensive, well-organized plans and marvelous power, he\nis working to hold the inhabitants of the world under his deceptions.\nGod, the One infinite and all-wise, sees the end from the beginning,\nand in dealing with evil His plans were far-reaching and comprehen-\nsive. It was His purpose, not merely to put down the rebellion, but\nto demonstrate to all the universe the nature of the rebellion. God\u2019s\nplan was unfolding, showing both His justice and His mercy, and\nfully vindicating His wisdom and righteousness in His dealings with\nevil.\nThe holy inhabitants of other worlds were watching with the\ndeepest interest the events taking place on the earth. In the condi-\ntion of the world that existed before the Flood they saw illustrated\nthe results of the administration which Lucifer had endeavored to[79]\nestablish in heaven, in rejecting the authority of Christ and casting\nCain and Abel Tested 61\naside the law of God. In those high-handed sinners of the antedilu-\nvian world they saw the subjects over whom Satan held sway. The\nthoughts of men\u2019s hearts were only evil continually. Genesis 6:5.\nEvery emotion, every impulse and imagination, was at war with the\ndivine principles of purity and peace and love. It was an example\nof the awful depravity resulting from Satan\u2019s policy to remove from\nGod\u2019s creatures the restraint of His holy law.\nBy the facts unfolded in the progress of the great controversy,\nGod will demonstrate the principles of His rules of government,\nwhich have been falsified by Satan and by all whom he has deceived.\nHis justice will finally be acknowledged by the whole world, though\nthe acknowledgment will be made too late to save the rebellious.\nGod carries with Him the sympathy and approval of the whole\nuniverse as step by step His great plan advances to its complete\nfulfillment. He will carry it with Him in the final eradication of\nrebellion. It will be seen that all who have forsaken the divine\nprecepts have placed themselves on the side of Satan, in warfare\nagainst Christ. When the prince of this world shall be judged, and all\nwho have united with him shall share his fate, the whole universe as\nwitnesses to the sentence will declare, \u201cJust and true are Thy ways,\nThou King of saints.\u201d Revelation 15:3.\nChapter 6\u2014Seth and Enoch[80]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 4:25 to 6:2.\nTo Adam was given another son, to be the inheritor of the divine\npromise, the heir of the spiritual birthright. The name Seth, given\nto this son, signified \u201cappointed,\u201d or \u201ccompensation;\u201d \u201cfor,\u201d said\nthe mother, \u201cGod hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel,\nwhom Cain slew.\u201d Seth was of more noble stature than Cain or Abel,\nand resembled Adam more closely than did his other sons. He was\na worthy character, following in the steps of Abel. Yet he inherited\nno more natural goodness than did Cain. Concerning the creation\nof Adam it is said, \u201cIn the likeness of God made He him;\u201d but man,\nafter the Fall, \u201cbegat a son in his own likeness, after his image.\u201d\nWhile Adam was created sinless, in the likeness of God, Seth, like\nCain, inherited the fallen nature of his parents. But he received also\nthe knowledge of the Redeemer and instruction in righteousness. By\ndivine grace he served and honored God; and he labored, as Abel\nwould have done, had he lived, to turn the minds of sinful men to\nrevere and obey their Creator.\n\u201cTo Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his\nname Enos: then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.\u201d\nThe faithful had worshiped God before; but as men increased, the\ndistinction between the two classes became more marked. There\nwas an open profession of loyalty to God on the part of one, as there\nwas of contempt and disobedience on the part of the other.\nBefore the Fall our first parents had kept the Sabbath, which\nwas instituted in Eden; and after their expulsion from Paradise they\ncontinued its observance. They had tasted the bitter fruits of disobe-\ndience, and had learned what every one that tramples upon God\u2019s\ncommandments will sooner or later learn\u2014that the divine precepts\nare sacred and immutable, and that the penalty of transgression will\nsurely be inflicted. The Sabbath was honored by all the children of[81]\nAdam that remained loyal to God. But Cain and his descendants\n62\nSeth and Enoch 63\ndid not respect the day upon which God had rested. They chose\ntheir own time for labor and for rest, regardless of Jehovah\u2019s express\ncommand.\nUpon receiving the curse of God, Cain had withdrawn from his\nfather\u2019s household. He had first chosen his occupation as a tiller\nof the soil, and he now founded a city, calling it after the name of\nhis eldest son. He had gone out from the presence of the Lord, cast\naway the promise of the restored Eden, to seek his possessions and\nenjoyment in the earth under the curse of sin, thus standing at the\nhead of that great class of men who worship the god of this world.\nIn that which pertains to mere earthly and material progress, his\ndescendants became distinguished. But they were regardless of God,\nand in opposition to His purposes for man. To the crime of murder,\nin which Cain had led the way, Lamech, the fifth in descent, added\npolygamy, and, boastfully defiant, he acknowledged God, only to\ndraw from the avenging of Cain an assurance of his own safety.\nAbel had led a pastoral life, dwelling in tents or booths, and the\ndescendants of Seth followed the same course, counting themselves\n\u201cstrangers and pilgrims on the earth,\u201d seeking \u201ca better country, that\nis, an heavenly.\u201d Hebrews 11:13, 16.\nFor some time the two classes remained separate. The race of\nCain, spreading from the place of their first settlement, dispersed\nover the plains and valleys where the children of Seth had dwelt;\nand the latter, in order to escape from their contaminating influence,\nwithdrew to the mountains, and there made their home. So long\nas this separation continued, they maintained the worship of God\nin its purity. But in the lapse of time they ventured, little by little,\nto mingle with the inhabitants of the valleys. This association was\nproductive of the worst results. \u201cThe sons of God saw the daughters\nof men that they were fair.\u201d The children of Seth, attracted by the\nbeauty of the daughters of Cain\u2019s descendants, displeased the Lord\nby intermarrying with them. Many of the worshipers of God were\nbeguiled into sin by the allurements that were now constantly before\nthem, and they lost their peculiar, holy character. Mingling with\nthe depraved, they became like them in spirit and in deeds; the\nrestrictions of the seventh commandment were disregarded, \u201cand\nthey took them wives of all which they chose.\u201d The children of Seth\nwent \u201cin the way of Cain\u201d (Jude 11); they fixed their minds upon [82]\n64 Patriarchs and Prophets\nworldly prosperity and enjoyment and neglected the commandments\nof the Lord. Men \u201cdid not like to retain God in their knowledge;\u201d\nthey \u201cbecame vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was\ndarkened.\u201d Romans 1:21. Therefore \u201cGod gave them over to a mind\nvoid of judgment.\u201d Verse 28, margin. Sin spread abroad in the earth\nlike a deadly leprosy.\nFor nearly a thousand years Adam lived among men, a witness\nto the results of sin. Faithfully he sought to stem the tide of evil.\nHe had been commanded to instruct his posterity in the way of the\nLord; and he carefully treasured what God had revealed to him, and\nrepeated it to succeeding generations. To his children and children\u2019s\nchildren, to the ninth generation, he described man\u2019s holy and happy\nestate in Paradise, and repeated the history of his fall, telling them\nof the sufferings by which God had taught him the necessity of strict\nadherence to His law, and explaining to them the merciful provisions\nfor their salvation. Yet there were but few who gave heed to his\nwords. Often he was met with bitter reproaches for the sin that had\nbrought such woe upon his posterity.\nAdam\u2019s life was one of sorrow, humility, and contrition. When\nhe left Eden, the thought that he must die thrilled him with horror.\nHe was first made acquainted with the reality of death in the human\nfamily when Cain, his first-born son, became the murderer of his\nbrother. Filled with the keenest remorse for his own sin, and doubly\nbereaved in the death of Abel and the rejection of Cain, Adam\nwas bowed down with anguish. He witnessed the wide-spreading\ncorruption that was finally to cause the destruction of the world by a\nflood; and though the sentence of death pronounced upon him by his\nMaker had at first appeared terrible, yet after beholding for nearly a\nthousand years the results of sin, he felt that it was merciful in God\nto bring to an end a life of suffering and sorrow.\nNotwithstanding the wickedness of the antediluvian world, that\nage was not, as has often been supposed, an era of ignorance and\nbarbarism. The people were granted the opportunity of reaching a\nhigh standard of moral and intellectual attainment. They possessed\ngreat physical and mental strength, and their advantages for acquir-\ning both religious and scientific knowledge were unrivaled. It is a\nmistake to suppose that because they lived to a great age their minds[83]\nmatured late; their mental powers were early developed, and those\nSeth and Enoch 65\nwho cherished the fear of God and lived in harmony with His will\ncontinued to increase in knowledge and wisdom throughout their\nlife. Could illustrious scholars of our time be placed in contrast with\nmen of the same age who lived before the Flood, they would appear\nas greatly inferior in mental as in physical strength. As the years of\nman have decreased, and his physical strength has diminished, so\nhis mental capacities have lessened. There are men who now apply\nthemselves to study during a period of from twenty to fifty years,\nand the world is filled with admiration of their attainments. But how\nlimited are these acquirements in comparison with those of men\nwhose mental and physical powers were developing for centuries!\nIt is true that the people of modern times have the benefit of\nthe attainments of their predecessors. The men of masterly minds,\nwho planned and studied and wrote, have left their work for those\nwho follow. But even in this respect, and so far as merely human\nknowledge is concerned, how much greater the advantages of the\nmen of that olden time! They had among them for hundreds of\nyears him who was formed in God\u2019s image, whom the Creator\nHimself pronounced \u201cgood\u201d\u2014the man whom God had instructed in\nall the wisdom pertaining to the material world. Adam had learned\nfrom the Creator the history of creation; he himself witnessed the\nevents of nine centuries; and he imparted his knowledge to his\ndescendants. The antediluvians were without books, they had no\nwritten records; but with their great physical and mental vigor, they\nhad strong memories, able to grasp and to retain that which was\ncommunicated to them, and in turn to transmit it unimpaired to their\nposterity. And for hundreds of years there were seven generations\nliving upon the earth contemporaneously, having the opportunity\nof consulting together and profiting each by the knowledge and\nexperience of all.\nThe advantages enjoyed by men of that age to gain a knowledge\nof God through His works have never been equaled since. And so\nfar from being an era of religious darkness, that was an age of great\nlight. All the world had opportunity to receive instruction from\nAdam, and those who feared the Lord had also Christ and angels\nfor their teachers. And they had a silent witness to the truth, in\nthe garden of God, which for so many centuries remained among\nmen. At the cherubim-guarded gate of Paradise the glory of God [84]\n66 Patriarchs and Prophets\nwas revealed, and hither came the first worshipers. Here their altars\nwere reared, and their offerings presented. It was here that Cain\nand Abel had brought their sacrifices, and God had condescended to\ncommunicate with them.\nSkepticism could not deny the existence of Eden while it stood\njust in sight, its entrance barred by watching angels. The order of\ncreation, the object of the garden, the history of its two trees so\nclosely connected with man\u2019s destiny, were undisputed facts. And\nthe existence and supreme authority of God, the obligation of His\nlaw, were truths which men were slow to question while Adam was\namong them.\nNotwithstanding the prevailing iniquity, there was a line of holy\nmen who, elevated and ennobled by communion with God, lived as\nin the companionship of heaven. They were men of massive intellect,\nof wonderful attainments. They had a great and holy mission\u2014to\ndevelop a character of righteousness, to teach a lesson of godliness,\nnot only to the men of their time, but for future generations. Only a\nfew of the most prominent are mentioned in the Scriptures; but all\nthrough the ages God had faithful witnesses, truehearted worshipers.\nOf Enoch it is written that he lived sixty-five years, and begat\na son. After that he walked with God three hundred years. During\nthese earlier years Enoch had loved and feared God and had kept\nHis commandments. He was one of the holy line, the preservers\nof the true faith, the progenitors of the promised seed. From the\nlips of Adam he had learned the dark story of the Fall, and the\ncheering one of God\u2019s grace as seen in the promise; and he relied\nupon the Redeemer to come. But after the birth of his first son,\nEnoch reached a higher experience; he was drawn into a closer\nrelationship with God. He realized more fully his own obligations\nand responsibility as a son of God. And as he saw the child\u2019s\nlove for its father, its simple trust in his protection; as he felt the\ndeep, yearning tenderness of his own heart for that first-born son, he\nlearned a precious lesson of the wonderful love of God to men in the\ngift of His Son, and the confidence which the children of God may\nrepose in their heavenly Father. The infinite, unfathomable love of\nGod through Christ became the subject of his meditations day and\nnight; and with all the fervor of his soul he sought to reveal that love\nto the people among whom he dwelt.\nSeth and Enoch 67\nEnoch\u2019s walk with God was not in a trance or vision, but in all the [85]\nduties of his daily life. He did not become a hermit, shutting himself\nentirely from the world; for he had a work to do for God in the\nworld. In the family and in his intercourse with men, as a husband\nand father, a friend, a citizen, he was the steadfast, unwavering\nservant of the Lord.\nHis heart was in harmony with God\u2019s will; for \u201ccan two walk\ntogether, except they be agreed?\u201d Amos 3:3. And this holy walk was\ncontinued for three hundred years. There are few Christians who\nwould not be far more earnest and devoted if they knew that they\nhad but a short time to live, or that the coming of Christ was about\nto take place. But Enoch\u2019s faith waxed the stronger, his love became\nmore ardent, with the lapse of centuries.\nEnoch was a man of strong and highly cultivated mind and ex-\ntensive knowledge; he was honored with special revelations from\nGod; yet being in constant communion with Heaven, with a sense\nof the divine greatness and perfection ever before him, he was one\nof the humblest of men. The closer the connection with God, the\ndeeper was the sense of his own weakness and imperfection.\nDistressed by the increasing wickedness of the ungodly, and\nfearing that their infidelity might lessen his reverence for God, Enoch\navoided constant association with them, and spent much time in\nsolitude, giving himself to meditation and prayer. Thus he waited\nbefore the Lord, seeking a clearer knowledge of His will, that he\nmight perform it. To him prayer was as the breath of the soul; he\nlived in the very atmosphere of heaven.\nThrough holy angels God revealed to Enoch His purpose to\ndestroy the world by a flood, and He also opened more fully to him\nthe plan of redemption. By the spirit of prophecy He carried him\ndown through the generations that should live after the Flood, and\nshowed him the great events connected with the second coming of\nChrist and the end of the world.\nEnoch had been troubled in regard to the dead. It had seemed to\nhim that the righteous and the wicked would go to the dust together,\nand that this would be their end. He could not see the life of the just\nbeyond the grave. In prophetic vision he was instructed concerning\nthe death of Christ, and was shown His coming in glory, attended by\nall the holy angels, to ransom His people from the grave. He also\n68 Patriarchs and Prophets\nsaw the corrupt state of the world when Christ should appear the[86]\nsecond time\u2014that there would be a boastful, presumptuous, self-\nwilled generation, denying the only God and the Lord Jesus Christ,\ntrampling upon the law, and despising the atonement. He saw the\nrighteous crowned with glory and honor, and the wicked banished\nfrom the presence of the Lord, and destroyed by fire.\nEnoch became a preacher of righteousness, making known to the\npeople what God had revealed to him. Those who feared the Lord\nsought out this holy man, to share his instruction and his prayers.\nHe labored publicly also, bearing God\u2019s messages to all who would\nhear the words of warning. His labors were not restricted to the\nSethites. In the land where Cain had sought to flee from the divine\nPresence, the prophet of God made known the wonderful scenes\nthat had passed before his vision. \u201cBehold,\u201d he declared, \u201cthe Lord\ncometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgment upon\nall, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their\nungodly deeds.\u201d Jude 14, 15.\nHe was a fearless reprover of sin. While he preached the love\nof God in Christ to the people of his time, and pleaded with them\nto forsake their evil ways, he rebuked the prevailing iniquity and\nwarned the men of his generation that judgment would surely be\nvisited upon the transgressor. It was the Spirit of Christ that spoke\nthrough Enoch; that Spirit is manifested, not alone in utterances of\nlove, compassion, and entreaty; it is not smooth things only that\nare spoken by holy men. God puts into the heart and lips of His\nmessengers truths to utter that are keen and cutting as a two-edged\nsword.\nThe power of God that wrought with His servant was felt by\nthose who heard. Some gave heed to the warning, and renounced\ntheir sins; but the multitudes mocked at the solemn message, and\nwent on more boldly in their evil ways. The servants of God are\nto bear a similar message to the world in the last days, and it will\nalso be received with unbelief and mockery. The antediluvian world\nrejected the warning words of him who walked with God. So will the\nlast generation make light of the warnings of the Lord\u2019s messengers.\nIn the midst of a life of active labor, Enoch steadfastly maintained\nhis communion with God. The greater and more pressing his labors,\nthe more constant and earnest were his prayers. He continued to[87]\nSeth and Enoch 69\nexclude himself, at certain periods, from all society. After remaining\nfor a time among the people, laboring to benefit them by instruction\nand example, he would withdraw, to spend a season in solitude,\nhungering and thirsting for that divine knowledge which God alone\ncan impart. Communing thus with God, Enoch came more and more\nto reflect the divine image. His face was radiant with a holy light,\neven the light that shineth in the face of Jesus. As he came forth\nfrom these divine communings, even the ungodly beheld with awe\nthe impress of heaven upon his countenance.\nThe wickedness of men had reached such a height that destruc-\ntion was pronounced against them. As year after year passed on,\ndeeper and deeper grew the tide of human guilt, darker and darker\ngathered the clouds of divine judgment. Yet Enoch, the witness of\nfaith, held on his way, warning, pleading, entreating, striving to turn\nback the tide of guilt and to stay the bolts of vengeance. Though\nhis warnings were disregarded by a sinful, pleasure-loving people,\nhe had the testimony that God approved, and he continued to battle\nfaithfully against the prevailing evil, until God removed him from a\nworld of sin to the pure joys of heaven.\nThe men of that generation had mocked the folly of him who\nsought not to gather gold or silver or to build up possessions here.\nBut Enoch\u2019s heart was upon eternal treasures. He had looked upon\nthe celestial city. He had seen the King in His glory in the midst of\nZion. His mind, his heart, his conversation, were in heaven. The\ngreater the existing iniquity, the more earnest was his longing for the\nhome of God. While still on earth, he dwelt, by faith, in the realms\nof light.\n\u201cBlessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\u201d Matthew\n5:8. For three hundred years Enoch had been seeking purity of soul,\nthat he might be in harmony with Heaven. For three centuries he\nhad walked with God. Day by day he had longed for a closer union;\nnearer and nearer had grown the communion, until God took him\nto Himself. He had stood at the threshold of the eternal world, only\na step between him and the land of the blest; and now the portals\nopened, the walk with God, so long pursued on earth, continued, and\nhe passed through the gates of the Holy City\u2014the first from among\nmen to enter there.\nHis loss was felt on earth. The voice that had been heard day after [88]\n70 Patriarchs and Prophets\nday in warning and instruction was missed. There were some, both\nof the righteous and the wicked, who had witnessed his departure;\nand hoping that he might have been conveyed to some one of his\nplaces of retirement, those who loved him made diligent search, as\nafterward the sons of the prophets searched for Elijah; but without\navail. They reported that he was not, for God had taken him.\nBy the translation of Enoch the Lord designed to teach an im-\nportant lesson. There was danger that men would yield to discour-\nagement, because of the fearful results of Adam\u2019s sin. Many were\nready to exclaim, \u201cWhat profit is it that we have feared the Lord\nand have kept His ordinances, since a heavy curse is resting upon\nthe race, and death is the portion of us all?\u201d But the instructions\nwhich God gave to Adam, and which were repeated by Seth, and\nexemplified by Enoch, swept away the gloom and darkness, and\ngave hope to man, that as through Adam came death, so through the\npromised Redeemer would come life and immortality. Satan was\nurging upon men the belief that there was no reward for the righteous\nor punishment for the wicked, and that it was impossible for men\nto obey the divine statutes. But in the case of Enoch, God declares\n\u201cthat He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek\nHim.\u201d Hebrews 11:6. He shows what He will do for those who keep\nHis commandments. Men were taught that it is possible to obey\nthe law of God; that even while living in the midst of the sinful and\ncorrupt, they were able, by the grace of God, to resist temptation,\nand become pure and holy. They saw in his example the blessedness\nof such a life; and his translation was an evidence of the truth of his\nprophecy concerning the hereafter, with its award of joy and glory\nand immortal life to the obedient, and of condemnation, woe, and\ndeath to the transgressor.\nBy faith Enoch \u201cwas translated that he should not see death;\n... for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased\nGod.\u201d Hebrews 11:5. In the midst of a world by its iniquity doomed\nto destruction, Enoch lived a life of such close communion with\nGod that he was not permitted to fall under the power of death. The\ngodly character of this prophet represents the state of holiness which\nmust be attained by those who shall be \u201credeemed from the earth\u201d[89]\n(Revelation 14:3) at the time of Christ\u2019s second advent. Then, as\nin the world before the Flood, iniquity will prevail. Following the\nSeth and Enoch 71\npromptings of their corrupt hearts and the teachings of a deceptive\nphilosophy, men will rebel against the authority of Heaven. But like\nEnoch, God\u2019s people will seek for purity of heart and conformity\nto His will, until they shall reflect the likeness of Christ. Like\nEnoch, they will warn the world of the Lord\u2019s second coming and\nof the judgments to be visited upon transgression, and by their holy\nconversation and example they will condemn the sins of the ungodly.\nAs Enoch was translated to heaven before the destruction of the\nworld by water, so the living righteous will be translated from the\nearth before its destruction by fire. Says the apostle: \u201cWe shall not\nall sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling\nof an eye, at the last trump.\u201d \u201cFor the Lord Himself shall descend\nfrom heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with\nthe trump of God;\u201d \u201cthe trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be\nraised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.\u201d \u201cThe dead in Christ\nshall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up\ntogether with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so\nshall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with\nthese words.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:51, 52; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18.\nChapter 7\u2014The Flood[90]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 6 and 7.\nIn the days of Noah a double curse was resting upon the earth in\nconsequence of Adam\u2019s transgression and of the murder committed\nby Cain. Yet this had not greatly changed the face of nature. There\nwere evident tokens of decay, but the earth was still rich and beautiful\nin the gifts of God\u2019s providence. The hills were crowned with\nmajestic trees supporting the fruit-laden branches of the vine. The\nvast, gardenlike plains were clothed with verdure, and sweet with\nthe fragrance of a thousand flowers. The fruits of the earth were in\ngreat variety, and almost without limit. The trees far surpassed in\nsize, beauty, and perfect proportion any now to be found; their wood\nwas of fine grain and hard substance, closely resembling stone, and\nhardly less enduring. Gold, silver, and precious stones existed in\nabundance.\nThe human race yet retained much of its early vigor. But a few\ngenerations had passed since Adam had access to the tree which\nwas to prolong life; and man\u2019s existence was still measured by\ncenturies. Had that long-lived people, with their rare powers to plan\nand execute, devoted themselves to the service of God, they would\nhave made their Creator\u2019s name a praise in the earth, and would\nhave answered the purpose for which He gave them life. But they\nfailed to do this. There were many giants, men of great stature and\nstrength, renowned for wisdom, skillful in devising the most cunning\nand wonderful works; but their guilt in giving loose rein to iniquity\nwas in proportion to their skill and mental ability.\nGod bestowed upon these antediluvians many and rich gifts;\nbut they used His bounties to glorify themselves, and turned them\ninto a curse by fixing their affections upon the gifts instead of the\nGiver. They employed the gold and silver, the precious stones and\nthe choice wood, in the construction of habitations for themselves,\nand endeavored to excel one another in beautifying their dwellings\n72\nFlood 73\nwith the most skillful workmanship. They sought only to gratify the [91]\ndesires of their own proud hearts, and reveled in scenes of pleasure\nand wickedness. Not desiring to retain God in their knowledge, they\nsoon came to deny His existence. They adored nature in place of the\nGod of nature. They glorified human genius, worshiped the works\nof their own hands, and taught their children to bow down to graven\nimages.\nIn the green fields and under the shadow of the goodly trees\nthey set up the altars of their idols. Extensive groves, that retained\ntheir foliage throughout the year, were dedicated to the worship of\nfalse gods. With these groves were connected beautiful gardens,\ntheir long, winding avenues overhung with fruit-bearing trees of all\ndescriptions, adorned with statuary, and furnished with all that could\ndelight the senses or minister to the voluptuous desires of the people,\nand thus allure them to participate in the idolatrous worship.\nMen put God out of their knowledge and worshiped the creatures\nof their own imagination; and as the result, they became more and\nmore debased. The psalmist describes the effect produced upon the\nworshiper by the adoration of idols. He says, \u201cThey that make them\nare like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.\u201d Psalm\n115:8. It is a law of the human mind that by beholding we become\nchanged. Man will rise no higher than his conceptions of truth,\npurity, and holiness. If the mind is never exalted above the level of\nhumanity, if it is not uplifted by faith to contemplate infinite wisdom\nand love, the man will be constantly sinking lower and lower. The\nworshipers of false gods clothed their deities with human attributes\nand passions, and thus their standard of character was degraded to\nthe likeness of sinful humanity. They were defiled in consequence.\n\u201cGod saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and\nthat every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil\ncontinually.... The earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth\nwas filled with violence.\u201d God had given men His commandments as\na rule of life, but His law was transgressed, and every conceivable sin\nwas the result. The wickedness of men was open and daring, justice\nwas trampled in the dust, and the cries of the oppressed reached unto\nheaven.\nPolygamy had been early introduced, contrary to the divine\narrangement at the beginning. The Lord gave to Adam one wife,\n74 Patriarchs and Prophets\nshowing His order in that respect. But after the Fall, men chose[92]\nto follow their own sinful desires; and as the result, crime and\nwretchedness rapidly increased. Neither the marriage relation nor\nthe rights of property were respected. Whoever coveted the wives\nor the possessions of his neighbor, took them by force, and men\nexulted in their deeds of violence. They delighted in destroying the\nlife of animals; and the use of flesh for food rendered them still more\ncruel and bloodthirsty, until they came to regard human life with\nastonishing indifference.\nThe world was in its infancy; yet iniquity had become so deep\nand widespread that God could no longer bear with it; and He said,\n\u201cI will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth.\u201d\nHe declared that His Spirit should not always strive with the guilty\nrace. If they did not cease to pollute with their sins the world and\nits rich treasures, He would blot them from His creation, and would\ndestroy the things with which He had delighted to bless them; He\nwould sweep away the beasts of the field, and the vegetation which\nfurnished such an abundant supply of food, and would transform the\nfair earth into one vast scene of desolation and ruin.\nAmid the prevailing corruption, Methuselah, Noah, and many\nothers labored to keep alive the knowledge of the true God and to\nstay the tide of moral evil. A hundred and twenty years before the\nFlood, the Lord by a holy angel declared to Noah His purpose, and\ndirected him to build an ark. While building the ark he was to preach\nthat God would bring a flood of water upon the earth to destroy the\nwicked. Those who would believe the message, and would prepare\nfor that event by repentance and reformation, should find pardon and\nbe saved. Enoch had repeated to his children what God had shown\nhim in regard to the Flood, and Methuselah and his sons, who lived\nto hear the preaching of Noah, assisted in building the ark.\nGod gave Noah the exact dimensions of the ark and explicit\ndirections in regard to its construction in every particular. Human\nwisdom could not have devised a structure of so great strength and\ndurability. God was the designer, and Noah the master builder. It\nwas constructed like the hull of a ship, that it might float upon the\nwater, but in some respects it more nearly resembled a house. It\nwas three stories high, with but one door, which was in the side.[93]\n[94]\n[95]\nThe light was admitted at the top, and the different apartments were\nFlood 75\nso arranged that all were lighted. The material employed in the\nconstruction of the ark was the cypress, or gopher wood, which\nwould be untouched by decay for hundreds of years. The building\nof this immense structure was a slow and laborious process. On\naccount of the great size of the trees and the nature of the wood,\nmuch more labor was required then than now to prepare timber, even\nwith the greater strength which men then possessed. All that man\ncould do was done to render the work perfect, yet the ark could not\nof itself have withstood the storm which was to come upon the earth.\nGod alone could preserve His servants upon the tempestuous waters.\n\u201cBy faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as\nyet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house;\nby the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the\nrighteousness which is by faith.\u201d Hebrews 11:7. While Noah was\ngiving his warning message to the world, his works testified of\nhis sincerity. It was thus that his faith was perfected and made\nevident. He gave the world an example of believing just what God\nsays. All that he possessed, he invested in the ark. As he began\nto construct that immense boat on dry ground, multitudes came\nfrom every direction to see the strange sight and to hear the earnest,\nfervent words of the singular preacher. Every blow struck upon the\nark was a witness to the people.\nMany at first appeared to receive the warning; yet they did not\nturn to God with true repentance. They were unwilling to renounce\ntheir sins. During the time that elapsed before the coming of the\nFlood, their faith was tested, and they failed to endure the trial.\nOvercome by the prevailing unbelief, they finally joined their former\nassociates in rejecting the solemn message. Some were deeply\nconvicted, and would have heeded the words of warning; but there\nwere so many to jest and ridicule, that they partook of the same\nspirit, resisted the invitations of mercy, and were soon among the\nboldest and most defiant scoffers; for none are so reckless and go to\nsuch lengths in sin as do those who have once had light, but have\nresisted the convicting Spirit of God.\nThe men of that generation were not all, in the fullest acceptation\nof the term, idolaters. Many professed to be worshipers of God. They [96]\nclaimed that their idols were representations of the Deity, and that\nthrough them the people could obtain a clearer conception of the\n76 Patriarchs and Prophets\ndivine Being. This class were foremost in rejecting the preaching\nof Noah. As they endeavored to represent God by material objects,\ntheir minds were blinded to His majesty and power; they ceased\nto realize the holiness of His character, or the sacred, unchanging\nnature of His requirements. As sin became general, it appeared less\nand less sinful, and they finally declared that the divine law was no\nlonger in force; that it was contrary to the character of God to punish\ntransgression; and they denied that His judgments were to be visited\nupon the earth. Had the men of that generation obeyed the divine\nlaw, they would have recognized the voice of God in the warning of\nHis servant; but their minds had become so blinded by rejection of\nlight that they really believed Noah\u2019s message to be a delusion.\nIt was not multitudes or majorities that were on the side of right.\nThe world was arrayed against God\u2019s justice and His laws, and Noah\nwas regarded as a fanatic. Satan, when tempting Eve to disobey\nGod, said to her, \u201cYe shall not surely die.\u201d Genesis 3:4. Great\nmen, worldly, honored, and wise men, repeated the same. \u201cThe\nthreatenings of God,\u201d they said, \u201care for the purpose of intimidating,\nand will never be verified. You need not be alarmed. Such an event\nas the destruction of the world by the God who made it, and the\npunishment of the beings He has created, will never take place. Be\nat peace; fear not. Noah is a wild fanatic.\u201d The world made merry\nat the folly of the deluded old man. Instead of humbling the heart\nbefore God, they continued their disobedience and wickedness, the\nsame as though God had not spoken to them through His servant.\nBut Noah stood like a rock amid the tempest. Surrounded by\npopular contempt and ridicule, he distinguished himself by his holy\nintegrity and unwavering faithfulness. A power attended his words,\nfor it was the voice of God to man through His servant. Connection\nwith God made him strong in the strength of infinite power, while\nfor one hundred and twenty years his solemn voice fell upon the\nears of that generation in regard to events, which, so far as human\nwisdom could judge, were impossible.\nThe world before the Flood reasoned that for centuries the laws\nof nature had been fixed. The recurring seasons had come in their\norder. Heretofore rain had never fallen; the earth had been watered[97]\nby a mist or dew. The rivers had never yet passed their boundaries,\nbut had borne their waters safely to the sea. Fixed decrees had kept\nFlood 77\nthe waters from overflowing their banks. But these reasoners did\nnot recognize the hand of Him who had stayed the waters, saying,\n\u201cHitherto shalt thou come, but no further.\u201d Job 38:11.\nAs time passed on, with no apparent change in nature, men\nwhose hearts had at times trembled with fear, began to be reassured.\nThey reasoned, as many reason now, that nature is above the God of\nnature, and that her laws are so firmly established that God Himself\ncould not change them. Reasoning that if the message of Noah were\ncorrect, nature would be turned out of her course, they made that\nmessage, in the minds of the world, a delusion\u2014a grand deception.\nThey manifested their contempt for the warning of God by doing just\nas they had done before the warning was given. They continued their\nfestivities and their gluttonous feasts; they ate and drank, planted\nand builded, laying their plans in reference to advantages they hoped\nto gain in the future; and they went to greater lengths in wickedness,\nand in defiant disregard of God\u2019s requirements, to testify that they\nhad no fear of the Infinite One. They asserted that if there were\nany truth in what Noah had said, the men of renown\u2014the wise, the\nprudent, the great men\u2014would understand the matter.\nHad the antediluvians believed the warning, and repented of\ntheir evil deeds, the Lord would have turned aside His wrath, as he\nafterward did from Nineveh. But by their obstinate resistance to\nthe reproofs of conscience and the warnings of God\u2019s prophet, that\ngeneration filled up the measure of their iniquity, and became ripe\nfor destruction.\nThe period of their probation was about to expire. Noah had\nfaithfully followed the instructions which he had received from God.\nThe ark was finished in every part as the Lord had directed, and\nwas stored with food for man and beast. And now the servant of\nGod made his last solemn appeal to the people. With an agony of\ndesire that words cannot express, he entreated them to seek a refuge\nwhile it might be found. Again they rejected his words, and raised\ntheir voices in jest and scoffing. Suddenly a silence fell upon the\nmocking throng. Beasts of every description, the fiercest as well as\nthe most gentle, were seen coming from mountain and forest and\nquietly making their way toward the ark. A noise as of a rushing\nwind was heard, and lo, birds were flocking from all directions, their [98]\nnumbers darkening the heavens, and in perfect order they passed\n78 Patriarchs and Prophets\nto the ark. Animals obeyed the command of God, while men were\ndisobedient. Guided by holy angels, they \u201cwent in two and two\nunto Noah into the ark,\u201d and the clean beasts by sevens. The world\nlooked on in wonder, some in fear. Philosophers were called upon\nto account for the singular occurrence, but in vain. It was a mystery\nwhich they could not fathom. But men had become so hardened by\ntheir persistent rejection of light that even this scene produced but a\nmomentary impression. As the doomed race beheld the sun shining\nin its glory, and the earth clad in almost Eden beauty, they banished\ntheir rising fears by boisterous merriment, and by their deeds of\nviolence they seemed to invite upon themselves the visitation of the\nalready awakened wrath of God.\nGod commanded Noah, \u201cCome thou and all thy house into the\nark; for thee have I seen righteous before Me in this generation.\u201d\nNoah\u2019s warnings had been rejected by the world, but his influence\nand example resulted in blessings to his family. As a reward for his\nfaithfulness and integrity, God saved all the members of his family\nwith him. What encouragement to parental fidelity!\nMercy had ceased its pleadings for the guilty race. The beasts\nof the field and the birds of the air had entered the place of refuge.\nNoah and his household were within the ark, \u201cand the Lord shut him\nin.\u201d A flash of dazzling light was seen, and a cloud of glory more\nvivid than the lightning descended from heaven and hovered before\nthe entrance of the ark. The massive door, which it was impossible\nfor those within to close, was slowly swung to its place by unseen\nhands. Noah was shut in, and the rejecters of God\u2019s mercy were shut\nout. The seal of Heaven was on that door; God had shut it, and God\nalone could open it. So when Christ shall cease His intercession for\nguilty men, before His coming in the clouds of heaven, the door of\nmercy will be shut. Then divine grace will no longer restrain the\nwicked, and Satan will have full control of those who have rejected\nmercy. They will endeavor to destroy God\u2019s people; but as Noah\nwas shut into the ark, so the righteous will be shielded by divine\npower.\nFor seven days after Noah and his family entered the ark, there\nappeared no sign of the coming storm. During this period their\nfaith was tested. It was a time of triumph to the world without. The\napparent delay confirmed them in the belief that Noah\u2019s message was[99]\nFlood 79\na delusion, and that the Flood would never come. Notwithstanding\nthe solemn scenes which they had witnessed\u2014the beasts and birds\nentering the ark, and the angel of God closing the door\u2014they still\ncontinued their sport and revelry, even making a jest of these signal\nmanifestations of God\u2019s power. They gathered in crowds about the\nark, deriding its inmates with a daring violence which they had never\nventured upon before.\nBut upon the eighth day dark clouds overspread the heavens.\nThere followed the muttering of thunder and the flash of lightning.\nSoon large drops of rain began to fall. The world had never witnessed\nanything like this, and the hearts of men were struck with fear. All\nwere secretly inquiring, \u201cCan it be that Noah was in the right, and\nthat the world is doomed to destruction?\u201d Darker and darker grew the\nheavens, and faster came the falling rain. The beasts were roaming\nabout in the wildest terror, and their discordant cries seemed to\nmoan out their own destiny and the fate of man. Then \u201cthe fountains\nof the great deep\u201d were \u201cbroken up, and the windows of heaven\nwere opened.\u201d Water appeared to come from the clouds in mighty\ncataracts. Rivers broke away from their boundaries, and overflowed\nthe valleys. Jets of water burst from the earth with indescribable\nforce, throwing massive rocks hundreds of feet into the air, and\nthese, in falling, buried themselves deep in the ground.\nThe people first beheld the destruction of the works of their\nown hands. Their splendid buildings, and the beautiful gardens\nand groves where they had placed their idols, were destroyed by\nlightning from heaven, and the ruins were scattered far and wide.\nThe altars on which human sacrifices had been offered were torn\ndown, and the worshipers were made to tremble at the power of the\nliving God, and to know that it was their corruption and idolatry\nwhich had called down their destruction.\nAs the violence of the storm increased, trees, buildings, rocks,\nand earth were hurled in every direction. The terror of man and\nbeast was beyond description. Above the roar of the tempest was\nheard the wailing of a people that had despised the authority of God.\nSatan himself, who was compelled to remain in the midst of the\nwarring elements, feared for his own existence. He had delighted\nto control so powerful a race, and desired them to live to practice\ntheir abominations and continue their rebellion against the Ruler\n80 Patriarchs and Prophets\nof heaven. He now uttered imprecations against God, charging[100]\nHim with injustice and cruelty. Many of the people, like Satan,\nblasphemed God, and had they been able, they would have torn Him\nfrom the throne of power. Others were frantic with fear, stretching\ntheir hands toward the ark and pleading for admittance. But their\nentreaties were in vain. Conscience was at last aroused to know\nthat there is a God who ruleth in the heavens. They called upon\nHim earnestly, but His ear was not open to their cry. In that terrible\nhour they saw that the transgression of God\u2019s law had caused their\nruin. Yet while, through fear of punishment, they acknowledged\ntheir sin, they felt no true contrition, no abhorrence of evil. They\nwould have returned to their defiance of Heaven, had the judgment\nbeen removed. So when God\u2019s judgments shall fall upon the earth\nbefore its deluge by fire, the impenitent will know just where and\nwhat their sin is\u2014the despising of His holy law. Yet they will have\nno more true repentance than did the old-world sinners.\nSome in their desperation endeavored to break into the ark, but\nthe firm-made structure withstood their efforts. Some clung to the\nark until they were borne away by the surging waters, or their hold\nwas broken by collision with rocks and trees. The massive ark\ntrembled in every fiber as it was beaten by the merciless winds and\nflung from billow to billow. The cries of the beasts within expressed\ntheir fear and pain. But amid the warring elements it continued to\nride safely. Angels that excel in strength were commissioned to\npreserve it.\nThe beasts, exposed to the tempest, rushed toward man, as\nthough expecting help from him. Some of the people bound their\nchildren and themselves upon powerful animals, knowing that these\nwere tenacious of life, and would climb to the highest points to\nescape the rising waters. Some fastened themselves to lofty trees\non the summit of hills or mountains; but the trees were uprooted,\nand with their burden of living beings were hurled into the seething\nbillows. One spot after another that promised safety was abandoned.\nAs the waters rose higher and higher, the people fled for refuge to\nthe loftiest mountains. Often man and beast would struggle together\nfor a foothold, until both were swept away.\nFrom the highest peaks men looked abroad upon a shoreless\nocean. The solemn warnings of God\u2019s servant no longer seemed a\nFlood 81\nsubject for ridicule and scorning. How those doomed sinners longed\nfor the opportunities which they had slighted! How they pleaded for [101]\none hour\u2019s probation, one more privilege of mercy, one call from the\nlips of Noah! But the sweet voice of mercy was no more to be heard\nby them. Love, no less than justice, demanded that God\u2019s judgments\nshould put a check on sin. The avenging waters swept over the last\nretreat, and the despisers of God perished in the black depths.\n\u201cBy the word of God ... the world that then was, being over-\nflowed with water, perished: but the heavens and the earth, which are\nnow, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against\nthe day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.\u201d 2 Peter 3:5-7.\nAnother storm is coming. The earth will again be swept by the\ndesolating wrath of God, and sin and sinners will be destroyed.\nThe sins that called for vengeance upon the antediluvian world\nexist today. The fear of God is banished from the hearts of men,\nand His law is treated with indifference and contempt. The intense\nworldliness of that generation is equaled by that of the generation\nnow living. Said Christ, \u201cAs in the days that were before the Flood\nthey were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage,\nuntil the day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not until the\nFlood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of\nthe Son of man be.\u201d Matthew 24:38, 39. God did not condemn the\nantediluvians for eating and drinking; He had given them the fruits\nof the earth in great abundance to supply their physical wants. Their\nsin consisted in taking these gifts without gratitude to the Giver, and\ndebasing themselves by indulging appetite without restraint. It was\nlawful for them to marry. Marriage was in God\u2019s order; it was one of\nthe first institutions which He established. He gave special directions\nconcerning this ordinance, clothing it with sanctity and beauty; but\nthese directions were forgotten, and marriage was perverted and\nmade to minister to passion.\nA similar condition of things exists now. That which is lawful\nin itself is carried to excess. Appetite is indulged without restraint.\nProfessed followers of Christ are today eating and drinking with\nthe drunken, while their names stand in honored church records.\nIntemperance benumbs the moral and spiritual powers and prepares\nthe way for indulgence of the lower passions. Multitudes feel under\nno moral obligation to curb their sensual desires, and they become\n82 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe slaves of lust. Men are living for the pleasures of sense; for[102]\nthis world and this life alone. Extravagance pervades all circles of\nsociety. Integrity is sacrificed for luxury and display. They that make\nhaste to be rich pervert justice and oppress the poor, and \u201cslaves and\nsouls of men\u201d are still bought and sold. Fraud and bribery and theft\nstalk unrebuked in high places and in low. The issues of the press\nteem with records of murder\u2014crimes so cold-blooded and causeless\nthat it seems as though every instinct of humanity were blotted out.\nAnd these atrocities have become of so common occurrence that they\nhardly elicit a comment or awaken surprise. The spirit of anarchy\nis permeating all nations, and the outbreaks that from time to time\nexcite the horror of the world are but indications of the pent-up fires\nof passion and lawlessness that, having once escaped control, will\nfill the earth with woe and desolation. The picture which Inspiration\nhas given of the antediluvian world represents too truly the condition\nto which modern society is fast hastening. Even now, in the present\ncentury, and in professedly Christian lands, there are crimes daily\nperpetrated as black and terrible as those for which the old-world\nsinners were destroyed.\nBefore the Flood God sent Noah to warn the world, that the\npeople might be led to repentance, and thus escape the threatened\ndestruction. As the time of Christ\u2019s second appearing draws near,\nthe Lord sends His servants with a warning to the world to prepare\nfor that great event. Multitudes have been living in transgression\nof God\u2019s law, and now He in mercy calls them to obey its sacred\nprecepts. All who will put away their sins by repentance toward\nGod and faith in Christ are offered pardon. But many feel that it\nrequires too great a sacrifice to put away sin. Because their life does\nnot harmonize with the pure principles of God\u2019s moral government,\nthey reject His warnings and deny the authority of His law.\nOf the vast population of the earth before the Flood, only eight\nsouls believed and obeyed God\u2019s word through Noah. For a hundred\nand twenty years the preacher of righteousness warned the world of\nthe coming destruction, but his message was rejected and despised.\nSo it will be now. Before the Lawgiver shall come to punish the\ndisobedient, transgressors are warned to repent, and return to their\nallegiance; but with the majority these warnings will be in vain.\nSays the apostle Peter, \u201cThere shall come in the last days scoffers,\nFlood 83\nwalking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of [103]\nHis coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue\nas they were from the beginning.\u201d 2 Peter 3:3, 4. Do we not hear\nthese very words repeated, not merely by the openly ungodly, but by\nmany who occupy the pulpits of our land? \u201cThere is no cause for\nalarm,\u201d they cry. \u201cBefore Christ shall come, all the world is to be\nconverted, and righteousness is to reign for a thousand years. Peace,\npeace! all things continue as they were from the beginning. Let none\nbe disturbed by the exciting message of these alarmists.\u201d But this\ndoctrine of the millennium does not harmonize with the teachings\nof Christ and His apostles. Jesus asked the significant question,\n\u201cWhen the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith on the earth?\u201d\nLuke 18:8. And, as we have seen, He declares that the state of the\nworld will be as in the days of Noah. Paul warns us that we may\nlook for wickedness to increase as the end draws near: \u201cThe Spirit\nspeaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from\nthe faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.\u201d 1\nTimothy 4:1. The apostle says that \u201cin the last days perilous times\nshall come.\u201d 2 Timothy 3:1. And he gives a startling list of sins that\nwill be found among those who have a form of godliness.\nAs the time of their probation was closing, the antediluvians\ngave themselves up to exciting amusements and festivities. Those\nwho possessed influence and power were bent on keeping the minds\nof the people engrossed with mirth and pleasure, lest any should\nbe impressed by the last solemn warning. Do we not see the same\nrepeated in our day? While God\u2019s servants are giving the message\nthat the end of all things is at hand, the world is absorbed in amuse-\nments and pleasure seeking. There is a constant round of excitement\nthat causes indifference to God and prevents the people from being\nimpressed by the truths which alone can save them from the coming\ndestruction.\nIn Noah\u2019s day philosophers declared that it was impossible for\nthe world to be destroyed by water; so now there are men of science\nwho endeavor to show that the world cannot be destroyed by fire\u2014\nthat this would be inconsistent with the laws of nature. But the God\nof nature, the Maker and Controller of her laws, can use the works\nof His hands to serve His own purpose.\n84 Patriarchs and Prophets\nWhen great and wise men had proved to their satisfaction that\nit was impossible for the world to be destroyed by water, when\nthe fears of the people were quieted, when all regarded Noah\u2019s[104]\nprophecy as a delusion, and looked upon him as a fanatic\u2014then it\nwas that God\u2019s time had come. \u201cThe fountains of the great deep\u201d\nwere \u201cbroken up, and the windows of heaven were opened,\u201d and\nthe scoffers were overwhelmed in the waters of the Flood. With\nall their boasted philosophy, men found too late that their wisdom\nwas foolishness, that the Lawgiver is greater than the laws of nature,\nand that Omnipotence is at no loss for means to accomplish His\npurposes. \u201cAs it was in the days of Noah,\u201d \u201ceven thus shall it be in\nthe days when the Son of man is revealed.\u201d Luke 17:26, 30. \u201cThe\nday of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the\nheavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall\nmelt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein\nshall be burned up.\u201d 2 Peter 3:10. When the reasoning of philosophy\nhas banished the fear of God\u2019s judgments; when religious teachers\nare pointing forward to long ages of peace and prosperity, and the\nworld are absorbed in their rounds of business and pleasure, planting\nand building, feasting and merrymaking, rejecting God\u2019s warnings\nand mocking His messengers\u2014then it is that sudden destruction\ncometh upon them, and they shall not escape. 1 Thessalonians 5:3.\nChapter 8\u2014After the Flood [105]\nThe waters rose fifteen cubits above the highest mountains. It\noften seemed to the family within the ark that they must perish, as\nfor five long months their boat was tossed about, apparently at the\nmercy of wind and wave. It was a trying ordeal; but Noah\u2019s faith did\nnot waver, for he had the assurance that the divine hand was upon\nthe helm.\nAs the waters began to subside, the Lord caused the ark to drift\ninto a spot protected by a group of mountains that had been preserved\nby His power. These mountains were but a little distance apart, and\nthe ark moved about in this quiet haven, and was no longer driven\nupon the boundless ocean. This gave great relief to the weary,\ntempest-tossed voyagers.\nNoah and his family anxiously waited for the decrease of the\nwaters, for they longed to go forth again upon the earth. Forty days\nafter the tops of the mountains became visible, they sent out a raven,\na bird of quick scent, to discover whether the earth had become\ndry. This bird, finding nothing but water, continued to fly to and\nfrom the ark. Seven days later a dove was sent forth, which, finding\nno footing, returned to the ark. Noah waited seven days longer,\nand again sent forth the dove. When she returned at evening with\nan olive leaf in her mouth, there was great rejoicing. Later \u201cNoah\nremoved the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face\nof the ground was dry.\u201d Still he waited patiently within the ark. As\nhe had entered at God\u2019s command, he waited for special directions\nto depart.\nAt last an angel descended from heaven, opened the massive\ndoor, and bade the patriarch and his household go forth upon the\nearth and take with them every living thing. In the joy of their\nrelease Noah did not forget Him by whose gracious care they had\nbeen preserved. His first act after leaving the ark was to build an [106]\naltar and offer from every kind of clean beast and fowl a sacrifice,\nthus manifesting his gratitude to God for deliverance and his faith in\n85\n86 Patriarchs and Prophets\nChrist, the great sacrifice. This offering was pleasing to the Lord;\nand a blessing resulted, not only to the patriarch and his family,\nbut to all who should live upon the earth. \u201cThe Lord smelled a\nsweet savor; and the Lord said in His heart, I will not again curse\nthe ground any more for man\u2019s sake.... While the earth remaineth,\nseedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and\nday and night shall not cease.\u201d Here was a lesson for all succeeding\ngenerations. Noah had come forth upon a desolate earth, but before\npreparing a house for himself he built an altar to God. His stock of\ncattle was small, and had been preserved at great expense; yet he\ncheerfully gave a part to the Lord as an acknowledgment that all was\nHis. In like manner it should be our first care to render our freewill\nofferings to God. Every manifestation of His mercy and love toward\nus should be gratefully acknowledged, both by acts of devotion and\nby gifts to His cause.\nLest the gathering clouds and falling rain should fill men with\nconstant terror, from fear of another flood, the Lord encouraged the\nfamily of Noah by a promise: \u201cI will establish My covenant with\nyou; ... neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth....\nI do set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant\nbetween Me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a\ncloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud.... And\nI will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant\nbetween God and every living creature.\u201d\nHow great the condescension of God and His compassion for\nHis erring creatures in thus placing the beautiful rainbow in the\nclouds as a token of His covenant with men! The Lord declares\nthat when He looks upon the bow, He will remember His covenant.\nThis does not imply that He would ever forget; but He speaks to us\nin our own language, that we may better understand Him. It was\nGod\u2019s purpose that as the children of after generations should ask the\nmeaning of the glorious arch which spans the heavens, their parents\nshould repeat the story of the Flood, and tell them that the Most\nHigh had bended the bow and placed it in the clouds as an assurance\nthat the waters should never again overflow the earth. Thus from\ngeneration to generation it would testify of divine love to man and[107]\nwould strengthen his confidence in God.\nAfter the Flood 87\nIn heaven the semblance of a rainbow encircles the throne and\noverarches the head of Christ. The prophet says, \u201cAs the appear-\nance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the\nappearance of the brightness round about [the throne]. This was\nthe appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah.\u201d Ezekiel\n1:28. The revelator declares, \u201cBehold, a throne was set in heaven,\nand one sat on the throne.... There was a rainbow round about the\nthrone, in sight like unto an emerald.\u201d Revelation 4:2, 3. When man\nby his great wickedness invites the divine judgments, the Saviour,\ninterceding with the Father in his behalf, points to the bow in the\nclouds, to the rainbow around the throne and above His own head,\nas a token of the mercy of God toward the repentant sinner.\nWith the assurance given to Noah concerning the Flood, God\nHimself has linked one of the most precious promises of His grace:\n\u201cAs I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the\nearth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke\nthee. For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but\nMy kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant\nof My peace be removed, saith Jehovah that hath mercy on thee.\u201d\nIsaiah 54:9, 10.\nAs Noah looked upon the powerful beasts of prey that came forth\nwith him from the ark, he feared that his family, numbering only\neight persons, would be destroyed by them. But the Lord sent an\nangel to His servant with the assuring message: \u201cThe fear of you\nand the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon\nevery fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon\nall the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. Every\nmoving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green\nherb have I given you all things.\u201d Before this time God had given\nman no permission to eat animal food; He intended that the race\nshould subsist wholly upon the productions of the earth; but now\nthat every green thing had been destroyed, He allowed them to eat\nthe flesh of the clean beasts that had been preserved in the ark.\nThe entire surface of the earth was changed at the Flood. A third\ndreadful curse rested upon it in consequence of sin. As the water\nbegan to subside, the hills and mountains were surrounded by a vast, [108]\nturbid sea, Everywhere were strewn the dead bodies of men and\nbeasts. The Lord would not permit these to remain to decompose\n88 Patriarchs and Prophets\nand pollute the air, therefore He made of the earth a vast burial\nground. A violent wind which was caused to blow for the purpose of\ndrying up the waters, moved them with great force, in some instances\neven carrying away the tops of the mountains and heaping up trees,\nrocks, and earth above the bodies of the dead. By the same means\nthe silver and gold, the choice wood and precious stones, which had\nenriched and adorned the world before the Flood, and which the\ninhabitants had idolized, were concealed from the sight and search\nof men, the violent action of the waters piling earth and rocks upon\nthese treasures, and in some cases even forming mountains above\nthem. God saw that the more He enriched and prospered sinful men,\nthe more they would corrupt their ways before Him. The treasures\nthat should have led them to glorify the bountiful Giver had been\nworshiped, while God had been dishonored and despised.\nThe earth presented an appearance of confusion and desolation\nimpossible to describe. The mountains, once so beautiful in their\nperfect symmetry, had become broken and irregular. Stones, ledges,\nand ragged rocks were now scattered upon the surface of the earth.\nIn many places hills and mountains had disappeared, leaving no\ntrace where they once stood; and plains had given place to mountain\nranges. These changes were more marked in some places than in\nothers. Where once had been earth\u2019s richest treasures of gold, silver,\nand precious stones, were seen the heaviest marks of the curse. And\nupon countries that were not inhabited, and those where there had\nbeen the least crime, the curse rested more lightly.\nAt this time immense forests were buried. These have since been\nchanged to coal, forming the extensive coal beds that now exist, and\nalso yielding large quantities of oil. The coal and oil frequently ignite\nand burn beneath the surface of the earth. Thus rocks are heated,\nlimestone is burned, and iron ore melted. The action of the water\nupon the lime adds fury to the intense heat, and causes earthquakes,\nvolcanoes, and fiery issues. As the fire and water come in contact\nwith ledges of rock and ore, there are heavy explosions underground,\nwhich sound like muffled thunder. The air is hot and suffocating.\nV olcanic eruptions follow; and these often failing to give sufficient\nvent to the heated elements, the earth itself is convulsed, the ground[109]\nheaves and swells like the waves of the sea, great fissures appear, and\nsometimes cities, villages, and burning mountains are swallowed up.\nAfter the Flood 89\nThese wonderful manifestations will be more and more frequent and\nterrible just before the second coming of Christ and the end of the\nworld, as signs of its speedy destruction.\nThe depths of the earth are the Lord\u2019s arsenal, whence were\ndrawn weapons to be employed in the destruction of the old world.\nWaters gushing from the earth united with the waters from heaven\nto accomplish the work of desolation. Since the Flood, fire as well\nas water has been God\u2019s agent to destroy very wicked cities. These\njudgments are sent that those who lightly regard God\u2019s law and\ntrample upon His authority may be led to tremble before His power\nand to confess His just sovereignty. As men have beheld burning\nmountains pouring forth fire and flames and torrents of melted ore,\ndrying up rivers, overwhelming populous cities, and everywhere\nspreading ruin and desolation, the stoutest heart has been filled\nwith terror and infidels and blasphemers have been constrained to\nacknowledge the infinite power of God.\nSaid the prophets of old, referring to scenes like these: \u201cOh that\nThou wouldest rend the heavens, that Thou wouldest come down,\nthat the mountains might flow down at Thy presence, as when the\nmelting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make Thy\nname known to Thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at\nThy presence! When Thou didst terrible things which we looked\nnot for, Thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at Thy\npresence.\u201d Isaiah 64:1-3. \u201cThe Lord hath His way in the whirlwind\nand in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of His feet. He rebuketh\nthe sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers.\u201d Nahum 1:3,\n4.\nMore terrible manifestations than the world has ever yet beheld,\nwill be witnessed at the second advent of Christ. \u201cThe mountains\nquake at Him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at His\npresence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein. Who can stand\nbefore His indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of His\nanger?\u201d Nahum 1:5, 6. \u201cBow Thy heavens, O Lord, and come down:\ntouch the mountains, and they shall smoke. Cast forth lightning,\nand scatter them: shoot out Thine arrows, and destroy them.\u201d Psalm\n144:5, 6.\n\u201cI will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth [110]\nbeneath; blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.\u201d Acts 2:19. \u201cAnd\n90 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthere were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a\ngreat earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so\nmighty an earthquake, and so great.\u201d \u201cAnd every island fled away,\nand the mountains were not found. And there fell upon men a\ngreat hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent.\u201d\nRevelation 16:18, 20, 21.\nAs lightnings from heaven unite with the fire in the earth, the\nmountains will burn like a furnace, and will pour forth terrific\nstreams of lava, overwhelming gardens and fields, villages and cities.\nSeething molten masses thrown into the rivers will cause the waters\nto boil, sending forth massive rocks with indescribable violence and\nscattering their broken fragments upon the land. Rivers will be dried\nup. The earth will be convulsed; everywhere there will be dreadful\nearthquakes and eruptions.\nThus God will destroy the wicked from off the earth. But the\nrighteous will be preserved in the midst of these commotions, as\nNoah was preserved in the ark. God will be their refuge, and un-\nder His wings shall they trust. Says the psalmist: \u201cBecause thou\nhast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy\nhabitation; there shall no evil befall thee.\u201d Psalm 91:9, 10. \u201cIn the\ntime of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion: in the secret of\nHis tabernacle shall He hide me.\u201d Psalm 27:5. God\u2019s promise is,\n\u201cBecause he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him:\nI will set him on high, because he hath known My name.\u201d Psalm\n91:14.\nChapter 9\u2014The Literal Week [111]\nLike the Sabbath, the week originated at creation, and it has\nbeen preserved and brought down to us through Bible history. God\nHimself measured off the first week as a sample for successive weeks\nto the close of time. Like every other, it consisted of seven literal\ndays. Six days were employed in the work of creation; upon the\nseventh, God rested, and He then blessed this day and set it apart as\na day of rest for man.\nIn the law given from Sinai, God recognized the week, and the\nfacts upon which it is based. After giving the command, \u201cRemember\nthe Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\u201d and specifying what shall be done\non the six days, and what shall not be done on the seventh, He states\nthe reason for thus observing the week, by pointing back to His own\nexample: \u201cFor in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea,\nand all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the\nLord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.\u201d Exodus 20:8-11.\nThis reason appears beautiful and forcible when we understand the\ndays of creation to be literal. The first six days of each week are\ngiven to man for labor, because God employed the same period of\nthe first week in the work of creation. On the seventh day man is to\nrefrain from labor, in commemoration of the Creator\u2019s rest.\nBut the assumption that the events of the first week required\nthousands upon thousands of years, strikes directly at the foundation\nof the fourth commandment. It represents the Creator as command-\ning men to observe the week of literal days in commemoration of\nvast, indefinite periods. This is unlike His method of dealing with\nHis creatures. It makes indefinite and obscure that which He has\nmade very plain. It is infidelity in its most insidious and hence most\ndangerous form; its real character is so disguised that it is held and\ntaught by many who profess to believe the Bible.\n\u201cBy the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the [112]\nhost of them by the breath of His mouth.\u201d \u201cFor He spake, and it was\ndone; He commanded, and it stood fast.\u201d Psalm 33:6, 9. The Bible\n91\n92 Patriarchs and Prophets\nrecognizes no long ages in which the earth was slowly evolved from\nchaos. Of each successive day of creation, the sacred record declares\nthat it consisted of the evening and the morning, like all other days\nthat have followed. At the close of each day is given the result of\nthe Creator\u2019s work. The statement is made at the close of the first\nweek\u2019s record, \u201cThese are the generations of the heavens and of\nthe earth when they were created.\u201d Genesis 2:4. But this does not\nconvey the idea that the days of creation were other than literal days.\nEach day was called a generation, because that in it God generated,\nor produced, some new portion of His work.\nGeologists claim to find evidence from the earth itself that it\nis very much older than the Mosaic record teaches. Bones of men\nand animals, as well as instruments of warfare, petrified trees, et\ncetera, much larger than any that now exist, or that have existed for\nthousands of years, have been discovered, and from this it is inferred\nthat the earth was populated long before the time brought to view\nin the record of creation, and by a race of beings vastly superior in\nsize to any men now living. Such reasoning has led many professed\nBible believers to adopt the position that the days of creation were\nvast, indefinite periods.\nBut apart from Bible history, geology can prove nothing. Those\nwho reason so confidently upon its discoveries have no adequate\nconception of the size of men, animals, and trees before the Flood,\nor of the great changes which then took place. Relics found in\nthe earth do give evidence of conditions differing in many respects\nfrom the present, but the time when these conditions existed can\nbe learned only from the Inspired Record. In the history of the\nFlood, inspiration has explained that which geology alone could\nnever fathom. In the days of Noah, men, animals, and trees, many\ntimes larger than now exist, were buried, and thus preserved as\nan evidence to later generations that the antediluvians perished by\na flood. God designed that the discovery of these things should\nestablish faith in inspired history; but men, with their vain reasoning,\nfall into the same error as did the people before the Flood\u2014the\nthings which God gave them as a benefit, they turn into a curse by\nmaking a wrong use of them.\nIt is one of Satan\u2019s devices to lead the people to accept the fables[113]\nof infidelity; for he can thus obscure the law of God, in itself very\nLiteral Week 93\nplain, and embolden men to rebel against the divine government.\nHis efforts are especially directed against the fourth commandment,\nbecause it so clearly points to the living God, the Maker of the\nheavens and the earth.\nThere is a constant effort made to explain the work of creation\nas the result of natural causes; and human reasoning is accepted\neven by professed Christians, in opposition to plain Scripture facts.\nThere are many who oppose the investigation of the prophecies,\nespecially those of Daniel and the Revelation, declaring them to be\nso obscure that we cannot understand them; yet these very persons\neagerly receive the suppositions of geologists, in contradiction of\nthe Mosaic record. But if that which God has revealed is so difficult\nto understand, how inconsistent it is to accept mere suppositions in\nregard to that which He has not revealed!\n\u201cThe secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those\nthings which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for-\never.\u201d Deuteronomy 29:29. Just how God accomplished the work\nof creation He has never revealed to men; human science cannot\nsearch out the secrets of the Most High. His creative power is as\nincomprehensible as His existence.\nGod has permitted a flood of light to be poured upon the world in\nboth science and art; but when professedly scientific men treat upon\nthese subjects from a merely human point of view, they will assuredly\ncome to wrong conclusions. It may be innocent to speculate beyond\nwhat God\u2019s word has revealed, if our theories do not contradict facts\nfound in the Scriptures; but those who leave the word of God, and\nseek to account for His created works upon scientific principles, are\ndrifting without chart or compass upon an unknown ocean. The\ngreatest minds, if not guided by the word of God in their research,\nbecome bewildered in their attempts to trace the relations of science\nand revelation. Because the Creator and His works are so far beyond\ntheir comprehension that they are unable to explain them by natural\nlaws, they regard Bible history as unreliable. Those who doubt the\nreliability of the records of the Old and New Testaments, will be\nled to go a step further, and doubt the existence of God; and then,\nhaving lost their anchor, they are left to beat about upon the rocks of\ninfidelity.\nThese persons have lost the simplicity of faith. There should be a [114]\n94 Patriarchs and Prophets\nsettled belief in the divine authority of God\u2019s Holy Word. The Bible\nis not to be tested by men\u2019s ideas of science. Human knowledge\nis an unreliable guide. Skeptics who read the Bible for the sake of\ncaviling, may, through an imperfect comprehension of either science\nor revelation, claim to find contradictions between them; but rightly\nunderstood, they are in perfect harmony. Moses wrote under the\nguidance of the Spirit of God, and a correct theory of geology will\nnever claim discoveries that cannot be reconciled with his statements.\nAll truth, whether in nature or in revelation, is consistent with itself\nin all its manifestations.\nIn the word of God many queries are raised that the most pro-\nfound scholars can never answer. Attention is called to these subjects\nto show us how much there is, even among the common things of\neveryday life, that finite minds, with all their boasted wisdom, can\nnever fully understand.\nYet men of science think that they can comprehend the wisdom\nof God, that which He has done or can do. The idea largely prevails\nthat He is restricted by His own laws. Men either deny or ignore\nHis existence, or think to explain everything, even the operation of\nHis Spirit upon the human heart; and they no longer reverence His\nname or fear His power. They do not believe in the supernatural,\nnot understanding God\u2019s laws or His infinite power to work His will\nthrough them. As commonly used, the term \u201claws of nature\u201d com-\nprises what men have been able to discover with regard to the laws\nthat govern the physical world; but how limited is their knowledge,\nand how vast the field in which the Creator can work in harmony\nwith His own laws and yet wholly beyond the comprehension of\nfinite beings!\nMany teach that matter possesses vital power\u2014that certain prop-\nerties are imparted to matter, and it is then left to act through its\nown inherent energy; and that the operations of nature are conducted\nin harmony with fixed laws, with which God Himself cannot in-\nterfere. This is false science, and is not sustained by the word of\nGod. Nature is the servant of her Creator. God does not annul His\nlaws or work contrary to them, but He is continually using them as\nHis instruments. Nature testifies of an intelligence, a presence, an\nactive energy, that works in and through her laws. There is in nature\nLiteral Week 95\nthe continual working of the Father and the Son. Christ says, \u201cMy\nFather worketh hitherto, and I work.\u201d John 5:17.\nThe Levites, in their hymn recorded by Nehemiah, sang, \u201cThou, [115]\neven Thou, art Lord alone; Thou hast made heaven, the heaven of\nheavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things therein, ... and\nThou preservest them all.\u201d Nehemiah 9:6. As regards this world,\nGod\u2019s work of creation is completed. For \u201cthe works were finished\nfrom the foundation of the world.\u201d Hebrews 4:3. But His energy is\nstill exerted in upholding the objects of His creation. It is not because\nthe mechanism that has once been set in motion continues to act\nby its own inherent energy that the pulse beats and breath follows\nbreath; but every breath, every pulsation of the heart, is an evidence\nof the all-pervading care of Him in whom \u201cwe live, and move, and\nhave our being.\u201d Acts 17:28. It is not because of inherent power\nthat year by year the earth produces her bounties and continues her\nmotion around the sun. The hand of God guides the planets and\nkeeps them in position in their orderly march through the heavens.\nHe \u201cbringeth out their host by number: He calleth them all by names\nby the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in power; not\none faileth.\u201d Isaiah 40:26. It is through His power that vegetation\nflourishes, that the leaves appear and the flowers bloom. He \u201cmaketh\ngrass to grow upon the mountains\u201d (Psalm 147:8), and by Him the\nvalleys are made fruitful. \u201cAll the beasts of the forest ... seek their\nmeat from God,\u201d and every living creature, from the smallest insect\nup to man, is daily dependent upon His providential care. In the\nbeautiful words of the psalmist, \u201cThese wait all upon Thee.... That\nThou givest them they gather: Thou openest Thine hand, they are\nfilled with good.\u201d Psalm 104:20, 21, 27, 28. His word controls the\nelements; He covers the heavens with clouds and prepares rain for\nthe earth. \u201cHe giveth snow like wool: He scattereth the hoarfrost\nlike ashes.\u201d Psalm 147:16. \u201cWhen He uttereth His voice, there is\na multitude of waters in the heavens, and He causeth the vapors to\nascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings with rain,\nand bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries.\u201d Jeremiah 10:13.\nGod is the foundation of everything. All true science is in har-\nmony with His works; all true education leads to obedience to His\ngovernment. Science opens new wonders to our view; she soars\nhigh, and explores new depths; but she brings nothing from her\n96 Patriarchs and Prophets\nresearch that conflicts with divine revelation. Ignorance may seek to\nsupport false views of God by appeals to science, but the book of\nnature and the written word shed light upon each other. We are thus[116]\nled to adore the Creator and to have an intelligent trust in His word.\nNo finite mind can fully comprehend the existence, the power,\nthe wisdom, or the works of the Infinite One. Says the sacred writer:\n\u201cCanst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the\nAlmighty unto perfection? It is as high as heaven; what canst thou\ndo? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? The measure thereof\nis longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.\u201d Job 11:7-9. The\nmightiest intellects of earth cannot comprehend God. Men may be\never searching, ever learning, and still there is an infinity beyond.\nYet the works of creation testify of God\u2019s power and greatness.\n\u201cThe heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth\nHis handiwork.\u201d Psalm 19:1. Those who take the written word as\ntheir counselor will find in science an aid to understand God. \u201cThe\ninvisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly\nseen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal\npower and Godhead.\u201d Romans 1:20.\nChapter 10\u2014The Tower of Babel [117]\nTo repeople the desolate earth, which the Flood had so lately\nswept from its moral corruption, God had preserved but one family,\nthe household of Noah, to whom He had declared, \u201cThee have I seen\nrighteous before Me in this generation.\u201d Genesis 7:1. Yet in the three\nsons of Noah was speedily developed the same great distinction seen\nin the world before the Flood. In Shem, Ham, and Japheth, who\nwere to be the founders of the human race, was foreshadowed the\ncharacter of their posterity.\nNoah, speaking by divine inspiration, foretold the history of the\nthree great races to spring from these fathers of mankind. Tracing\nthe descendants of Ham, through the son rather than the father,\nhe declared, \u201cCursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be\nunto his brethren.\u201d The unnatural crime of Ham declared that filial\nreverence had long before been cast from his soul, and it revealed\nthe impiety and vileness of his character. These evil characteristics\nwere perpetuated in Canaan and his posterity, whose continued guilt\ncalled upon them the judgments of God.\nOn the other hand, the reverence manifested by Shem and\nJapheth for their father, and thus for the divine statutes, promised a\nbrighter future for their descendants. Concerning these sons it was\ndeclared: \u201cBlessed be Jehovah, God of Shem; and Canaan shall be\nhis servant. God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents\nof Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\u201d The line of Shem was\nto be that of the chosen people, of God\u2019s covenant, of the promised\nRedeemer. Jehovah was the God of Shem. From him would descend\nAbraham, and the people of Israel, through whom Christ was to\ncome. \u201cHappy is that people, whose God is the Lord.\u201d Psalm 144:15.\nAnd Japheth \u201cshall dwell in the tents of Shem.\u201d In the blessings of [118]\nthe gospel the descendants of Japheth were especially to share.\nThe posterity of Canaan descended to the most degrading forms\nof heathenism. Though the prophetic curse had doomed them to\nslavery, the doom was withheld for centuries. God bore with their\n97\n98 Patriarchs and Prophets\nimpiety and corruption until they passed the limits of divine forbear-\nance. Then they were dispossessed, and became bondmen to the\ndescendants of Shem and Japheth.\nThe prophecy of Noah was no arbitrary denunciation of wrath\nor declaration of favor. It did not fix the character and destiny of his\nsons. But it showed what would be the result of the course of life they\nhad severally chosen and the character they had developed. It was\nan expression of God\u2019s purpose toward them and their posterity in\nview of their own character and conduct. As a rule, children inherit\nthe dispositions and tendencies of their parents, and imitate their\nexample; so that the sins of the parents are practiced by the children\nfrom generation to generation. Thus the vileness and irreverence\nof Ham were reproduced in his posterity, bringing a curse upon\nthem for many generations. \u201cOne sinner destroyeth much good.\u201d\nEcclesiastes 9:18.\nOn the other hand, how richly rewarded was Shem\u2019s respect for\nhis father; and what an illustrious line of holy men appears in his\nposterity! \u201cThe Lord knoweth the days of the upright,\u201d \u201cand his\nseed is blessed.\u201d Psalm 37:18, 26. \u201cKnow therefore that the Lord\nthy God He is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and\nmercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments to a\nthousand generations.\u201d Deuteronomy 7:9.\nFor a time the descendants of Noah continued to dwell among\nthe mountains where the ark had rested. As their numbers increased,\napostasy soon led to division. Those who desired to forget their Cre-\nator and to cast off the restraint of His law felt a constant annoyance\nfrom the teaching and example of their God-fearing associates, and\nafter a time they decided to separate from the worshipers of God.\nAccordingly they journeyed to the plain of Shinar, on the banks of\nthe river Euphrates. They were attracted by the beauty of the situa-\ntion and the fertility of the soil, and upon this plain they determined\nto make their home.\nHere they decided to build a city, and in it a tower of such\nstupendous height as should render it the wonder of the world. These[119]\nenterprises were designed to prevent the people from scattering\nabroad in colonies. God had directed men to disperse throughout the\nearth, to replenish and subdue it; but these Babel builders determined\nto keep their community united in one body, and to found a monarchy\nTower of Babel 99\nthat should eventually embrace the whole earth. Thus their city\nwould become the metropolis of a universal empire; its glory would\ncommand the admiration and homage of the world and render the\nfounders illustrious. The magnificent tower, reaching to the heavens,\nwas intended to stand as a monument of the power and wisdom of\nits builders, perpetuating their fame to the latest generations.\nThe dwellers on the plain of Shinar disbelieved God\u2019s covenant\nthat He would not again bring a flood upon the earth. Many of them\ndenied the existence of God and attributed the Flood to the operation\nof natural causes. Others believed in a Supreme Being, and that it\nwas He who had destroyed the antediluvian world; and their hearts,\nlike that of Cain, rose up in rebellion against Him. One object before\nthem in the erection of the tower was to secure their own safety in\ncase of another deluge. By carrying the structure to a much greater\nheight than was reached by the waters of the Flood, they thought\nto place themselves beyond all possibility of danger. And as they\nwould be able to ascend to the region of the clouds, they hoped\nto ascertain the cause of the Flood. The whole undertaking was\ndesigned to exalt still further the pride of its projectors and to turn\nthe minds of future generations away from God and lead them into\nidolatry.\nWhen the tower had been partially completed, a portion of it\nwas occupied as a dwelling place for the builders; other apartments,\nsplendidly furnished and adorned, were devoted to their idols. The\npeople rejoiced in their success, and praised the gods of silver and\ngold, and set themselves against the Ruler of heaven and earth.\nSuddenly the work that had been advancing so prosperously was\nchecked. Angels were sent to bring to naught the purpose of the\nbuilders. The tower had reached a lofty height, and it was impossible\nfor the workmen at the top to communicate directly with those at\nthe base; therefore men were stationed at different points, each to\nreceive and report to the one next below him the orders for needed\nmaterial or other directions concerning the work. As messages were\nthus passing from one to another the language was confounded, so\nthat material was called for which was not needed, and the directions [120]\ndelivered were often the reverse of those that had been given. Con-\nfusion and dismay followed. All work came to a standstill. There\ncould be no further harmony or co-operation. The builders were\n100 Patriarchs and Prophets\nwholly unable to account for the strange misunderstandings among\nthem, and in their rage and disappointment they reproached one an-\nother. Their confederacy ended in strife and bloodshed. Lightnings\nfrom heaven, as an evidence of God\u2019s displeasure, broke off the\nupper portion of the tower and cast it to the ground. Men were made\nto feel that there is a God who ruleth in the heavens.\nUp to this time all men had spoken the same language; now those\nthat could understand one another\u2019s speech united in companies;\nsome went one way, and some another. \u201cThe Lord scattered them\nabroad from thence upon the face of all the earth.\u201d This dispersion\nwas the means of peopling the earth, and thus the Lord\u2019s purpose\nwas accomplished through the very means that men had employed\nto prevent its fulfillment.\nBut at what a loss to those who had set themselves against God!\nIt was His purpose that as men should go forth to found nations in\ndifferent parts of the earth they should carry with them a knowledge\nof His will, that the light of truth might shine undimmed to suc-\nceeding generations. Noah, the faithful preacher of righteousness,\nlived for three hundred and fifty years after the Flood, Shem for\nfive hundred years, and thus their descendants had an opportunity\nto become acquainted with the requirements of God and the history\nof His dealings with their fathers. But they were unwilling to listen\nto these unpalatable truths; they had no desire to retain God in their\nknowledge; and by the confusion of tongues they were, in a great\nmeasure, shut out from intercourse with those who might have given\nthem light.\nThe Babel builders had indulged the spirit of murmuring against\nGod. Instead of gratefully remembering His mercy to Adam and His\ngracious covenant with Noah, they had complained of His severity\nin expelling the first pair from Eden and destroying the world by\na flood. But while they murmured against God as arbitrary and\nsevere, they were accepting the rule of the cruelest of tyrants. Satan\nwas seeking to bring contempt upon the sacrificial offerings that\nprefigured the death of Christ; and as the minds of the people were\ndarkened by idolatry, he led them to counterfeit these offerings and\nsacrifice their own children upon the altars of their gods. As men[121]\n[122]\n[123]\nturned away from God, the divine attributes\u2014justice, purity, and\nlove\u2014were supplanted by oppression, violence, and brutality.\nTower of Babel 101\nThe men of Babel had determined to establish a government\nthat should be independent of God. There were some among them,\nhowever, who feared the Lord, but who had been deceived by the\npretensions of the ungodly and drawn into their schemes. For the\nsake of these faithful ones the Lord delayed His judgments and\ngave the people time to reveal their true character. As this was\ndeveloped, the sons of God labored to turn them from their purpose;\nbut the people were fully united in their Heaven-daring undertaking.\nHad they gone on unchecked, they would have demoralized the\nworld in its infancy. Their confederacy was founded in rebellion;\na kingdom established for self-exaltation, but in which God was\nto have no rule or honor. Had this confederacy been permitted, a\nmighty power would have borne sway to banish righteousness\u2014and\nwith it peace, happiness, and security\u2014from the earth. For the divine\nstatutes, which are \u201choly and just and good\u201d (Romans 7:12), men\nwere endeavoring to substitute laws to suit the purpose of their own\nselfish and cruel hearts.\nThose that feared the Lord cried unto Him to interpose. \u201cAnd the\nLord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of\nmen builded.\u201d In mercy to the world He defeated the purpose of the\ntower builders and overthrew the memorial of their daring. In mercy\nHe confounded their speech, thus putting a check on their purposes\nof rebellion. God bears long with the perversity of men, giving them\nample opportunity for repentance; but He marks all their devices to\nresist the authority of His just and holy law. From time to time the\nunseen hand that holds the scepter of government is stretched out to\nrestrain iniquity. Unmistakable evidence is given that the Creator of\nthe universe, the One infinite in wisdom and love and truth, is the\nSupreme Ruler of heaven and earth, and that none can with impunity\ndefy His power.\nThe schemes of the Babel builders ended in shame and defeat.\nThe monument to their pride became the memorial of their folly.\nYet men are continually pursuing the same course\u2014depending upon\nself, and rejecting God\u2019s law. It is the principle that Satan tried to\ncarry out in heaven; the same that governed Cain in presenting his\noffering.\nThere are tower builders in our time. Infidels construct their\ntheories from the supposed deductions of sciences, and reject the [124]\n102 Patriarchs and Prophets\nrevealed word of God. They presume to pass sentence upon God\u2019s\nmoral government; they despise His law and boast of the sufficiency\nof human reason. Then, \u201cbecause sentence against an evil work is\nnot executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully\nset in them to do evil.\u201d Ecclesiastes 8:11.\nIn the professedly Christian world many turn away from the plain\nteachings of the Bible and build up a creed from human speculations\nand pleasing fables, and they point to their tower as a way to climb\nup to heaven. Men hang with admiration upon the lips of eloquence\nwhile it teaches that the transgressor shall not die, that salvation may\nbe secured without obedience to the law of God. If the professed\nfollowers of Christ would accept God\u2019s standard, it would bring\nthem into unity; but so long as human wisdom is exalted above His\nHoly Word, there will be divisions and dissension. The existing\nconfusion of conflicting creeds and sects is fitly represented by the\nterm \u201cBabylon,\u201d which prophecy (Revelation 14:8; 18:2) applies to\nthe world-loving churches of the last days.\nMany seek to make a heaven for themselves by obtaining riches\nand power. They \u201cspeak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak\nloftily\u201d (Psalm 73:8), trampling upon human rights and disregarding\ndivine authority. The proud may be for a time in great power, and\nmay see success in all that they undertake; but in the end they will\nfind only disappointment and wretchedness.\nThe time of God\u2019s investigation is at hand. The Most High will\ncome down to see that which the children of men have builded. His\nsovereign power will be revealed; the works of human pride will\nbe laid low. \u201cThe Lord looketh from heaven; He beholdeth all the\nsons of men. From the place of His habitation He looketh upon all\nthe inhabitants of the earth.\u201d \u201cThe Lord bringeth the counsel of the\nheathen to nought: He maketh the devices of the people of none\neffect. The counsel of the Lord standeth forever, the thoughts of His\nheart to all generations.\u201d Psalm 33:13, 14, 10, 11.\nChapter 11\u2014The Call of Abraham [125]\nAfter the dispersion from Babel idolatry again became well-\nnigh universal, and the Lord finally left the hardened transgressors to\nfollow their evil ways, while He chose Abraham, of the line of Shem,\nand made him the keeper of His law for future generations. Abraham\nhad grown up in the midst of superstition and heathenism. Even\nhis father\u2019s household, by whom the knowledge of God had been\npreserved, were yielding to the seductive influences surrounding\nthem, and they \u201cserved other gods\u201d than Jehovah. But the true\nfaith was not to become extinct. God has ever preserved a remnant\nto serve Him. Adam, Seth, Enoch, Methuselah, Noah, Shem, in\nunbroken line, had preserved from age to age the precious revealings\nof His will. The son of Terah became the inheritor of this holy\ntrust. Idolatry invited him on every side, but in vain. Faithful among\nthe faithless, uncorrupted by the prevailing apostasy, he steadfastly\nadhered to the worship of the one true God. \u201cThe Lord is nigh\nunto all them that call upon Him, to all that call upon Him in truth.\u201d\nPsalm 145:18. He communicated His will to Abraham, and gave\nhim a distinct knowledge of the requirements of His law and of the\nsalvation that would be accomplished through Christ.\nThere was given to Abraham the promise, especially dear to the\npeople of that age, of a numerous posterity and of national greatness:\n\u201cI will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make\nthy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing.\u201d And to this was added\nthe assurance, precious above every other to the inheritor of faith,\nthat of his line the Redeemer of the world should come: \u201cIn thee\nshall all families of the earth be blessed.\u201d Yet, as the first condition of\nfulfillment, there was to be a test of faith; a sacrifice was demanded.\nThe message of God came to Abraham, \u201cGet thee out of thy [126]\ncountry, and from thy kindred, and from thy father\u2019s house, unto a\nland that I will show thee.\u201d In order that God might qualify him for\nhis great work as the keeper of the sacred oracles, Abraham must be\nseparated from the associations of his early life. The influence of\n103\n104 Patriarchs and Prophets\nkindred and friends would interfere with the training which the Lord\npurposed to give His servant. Now that Abraham was, in a special\nsense, connected with heaven, he must dwell among strangers. His\ncharacter must be peculiar, differing from all the world. He could\nnot even explain his course of action so as to be understood by his\nfriends. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned, and his motives\nand actions were not comprehended by his idolatrous kindred.\n\u201cBy faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place\nwhich he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he\nwent out, not knowing whither he went.\u201d Hebrews 11:8. Abraham\u2019s\nunquestioning obedience is one of the most striking evidences of\nfaith to be found in all the Bible. To him, faith was \u201cthe substance of\nthings hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\u201d Verse 1. Relying\nupon the divine promise, without the least outward assurance of its\nfulfillment, he abandoned home and kindred and native land, and\nwent forth, he knew not whither, to follow where God should lead.\n\u201cBy faith he became a sojourner in the land of promise, as in a land\nnot his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with\nhim of the same promise.\u201d Hebrews 11:9, R.V .\nIt was no light test that was thus brought upon Abraham, no\nsmall sacrifice that was required of him. There were strong ties\nto bind him to his country, his kindred, and his home. But he did\nnot hesitate to obey the call. He had no question to ask concerning\nthe land of promise\u2014whether the soil was fertile and the climate\nhealthful; whether the country afforded agreeable surroundings and\nwould afford opportunities for amassing wealth. God has spoken,\nand His servant must obey; the happiest place on earth for him was\nthe place where God would have him to be.\nMany are still tested as was Abraham. They do not hear the\nvoice of God speaking directly from the heavens, but He calls them\nby the teachings of His word and the events of His providence. They\nmay be required to abandon a career that promises wealth and honor,\nto leave congenial and profitable associations and separate from[127]\nkindred, to enter upon what appears to be only a path of self-denial,\nhardship, and sacrifice. God has a work for them to do; but a life\nof ease and the influence of friends and kindred would hinder the\ndevelopment of the very traits essential for its accomplishment. He\ncalls them away from human influences and aid, and leads them to\nCall of Abraham 105\nfeel the need of His help, and to depend upon Him alone, that He\nmay reveal Himself to them. Who is ready at the call of Providence\nto renounce cherished plans and familiar associations? Who will\naccept new duties and enter untried fields, doing God\u2019s work with\nfirm and willing heart, for Christ\u2019s sake counting his losses gain? He\nwho will do this has the faith of Abraham, and will share with him\nthat \u201cfar more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,\u201d with which\n\u201cthe sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared.\u201d\n2 Corinthians 4:17; Romans 8:18.\nThe call from heaven first came to Abraham while he dwelt in\n\u201cUr of the Chaldees\u201d and in obedience to it he removed to Haran.\nThus far his father\u2019s family accompanied him, for with their idolatry\nthey united the worship of the true God. Here Abraham remained\ntill the death of Terah. But from his father\u2019s grave the divine V oice\nbade him go forward. His brother Nahor with his household clung\nto their home and their idols. Besides Sarah, the wife of Abraham,\nonly Lot, the son of Haran long since dead, chose to share the\npatriarch\u2019s, pilgrim life. Yet it was a large company that set out from\nMesopotamia. Abraham already possessed extensive flocks and\nherds, the riches of the East, and he was surrounded by a numerous\nbody of servants and retainers. He was departing from the land of his\nfathers, never to return, and he took with him all that he had, \u201ctheir\nsubstance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in\nHaran.\u201d Among these were many led by higher considerations than\nthose of service and self-interest. During their stay in Haran, both\nAbraham and Sarah had led others to the worship and service of the\ntrue God. These attached themselves to the patriarch\u2019s household,\nand accompanied him to the land of promise. \u201cAnd they went forth\nto go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they\ncame.\u201d\nThe place where they first tarried was Shechem. Under the\nshade of the oaks of Moreh, in a wide, grassy valley, with its olive\ngroves and gushing springs, between Mount Ebal on the one side [128]\nand Mount Gerizim on the other, Abraham made his encampment.\nIt was a fair and goodly country that the patriarch had entered\u2014\u201ca\nland of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of\nvalleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees,\nand pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey.\u201d Deuteronomy\n106 Patriarchs and Prophets\n8:7, 8. But to the worshiper of Jehovah, a heavy shadow rested\nupon wooded hill and fruitful plain. \u201cThe Canaanite was then in\nthe land.\u201d Abraham had reached the goal of his hopes to find a\ncountry occupied by an alien race and overspread with idolatry. In\nthe groves were set up the altars of false gods, and human sacrifices\nwere offered upon the neighboring heights. While he clung to the\ndivine promise, it was not without distressful forebodings that he\npitched his tent. Then \u201cthe Lord appeared unto Abram, and said,\nUnto thy seed will I give this land.\u201d His faith was strengthened by\nthis assurance that the divine presence was with him, that he was\nnot left to the mercy of the wicked. \u201cAnd there builded he an altar\nunto the Lord, who appeared unto him.\u201d Still a wayfarer, he soon\nremoved to a spot near Bethel, and again erected an altar, and called\nupon the name of the Lord.\nAbraham, \u201cthe friend of God,\u201d set us a worthy example. His was\na life of prayer. Wherever he pitched his tent, close beside it was set\nup his altar, calling all within his encampment to the morning and\nevening sacrifice. When his tent was removed, the altar remained. In\nfollowing years, there were those among the roving Canaanites who\nreceived instruction from Abraham; and whenever one of these came\nto that altar, he knew who had been there before him; and when he\nhad pitched his tent, he repaired the altar, and there worshiped the\nliving God.\nAbraham continued to journey southward, and again his faith\nwas tested. The heavens withheld their rain, the brooks ceased to\nflow in the valleys, and the grass withered on the plains. The flocks\nand herds found no pasture, and starvation threatened the whole\nencampment. Did not the patriarch now question the leadings of\nProvidence? Did he not look back with longing to the plenty of the\nChaldean plains? All were eagerly watching to see what Abraham\nwould do, as trouble after trouble came upon him. So long as his\nconfidence appeared unshaken, they felt that there was hope; they\nwere assured that God was his Friend, and that He was still guiding\nhim.\nAbraham could not explain the leadings of Providence; he had[129]\nnot realized his expectations; but he held fast the promise, \u201cI will\nbless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing.\u201d\nWith earnest prayer he considered how to preserve the life of his\nCall of Abraham 107\npeople and his flocks, but he would not allow circumstances to shake\nhis faith in God\u2019s word. To escape the famine he went down into\nEgypt. He did not forsake Canaan, or in his extremity turn back to\nthe Chaldean land from which he came, where there was no scarcity\nof bread; but he sought a temporary refuge as near as possible to the\nLand of Promise, intending shortly to return where God had placed\nhim.\nThe Lord in His providence had brought this trial upon Abraham\nto teach him lessons of submission, patience, and faith\u2014lessons\nthat were to be placed on record for the benefit of all who should\nafterward be called to endure affliction. God leads His children by a\nway that they know not, but He does not forget or cast off those who\nput their trust in Him. He permitted affliction to come upon Job, but\nHe did not forsake him. He allowed the beloved John to be exiled\nto lonely Patmos, but the Son of God met him there, and his vision\nwas filled with scenes of immortal glory. God permits trials to assail\nHis people, that by their constancy and obedience they themselves\nmay be spiritually enriched, and that their example may be a source\nof strength to others. \u201cI know the thoughts that I think toward you,\nsaith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil.\u201d Jeremiah 29:11.\nThe very trials that task our faith most severely and make it seem\nthat God has forsaken us, are to lead us closer to Christ, that we may\nlay all our burdens at His feet and experience the peace which He\nwill give us in exchange.\nGod has always tried His people in the furnace of affliction. It is\nin the heat of the furnace that the dross is separated from the true\ngold of the Christian character. Jesus watches the test; He knows\nwhat is needed to purify the precious metal, that it may reflect the\nradiance of His love. It is by close, testing trials that God disciplines\nHis servants. He sees that some have powers which may be used\nin the advancement of His work, and He puts these persons upon\ntrial; in His providence He brings them into positions that test their\ncharacter and reveal defects and weaknesses that have been hidden\nfrom their own knowledge. He gives them opportunity to correct [130]\nthese defects and to fit themselves for His service. He shows them\ntheir own weakness, and teaches them to lean upon Him; for He is\ntheir only help and safeguard. Thus His object is attained. They\nare educated, trained, and disciplined, prepared to fulfill the grand\n108 Patriarchs and Prophets\npurpose for which their powers were given them. When God calls\nthem to action, they are ready, and heavenly angels can unite with\nthem in the work to be accomplished on the earth.\nDuring his stay in Egypt, Abraham gave evidence that he was\nnot free from human weakness and imperfection. In concealing the\nfact that Sarah was his wife, he betrayed a distrust of the divine care,\na lack of that lofty faith and courage so often and nobly exemplified\nin his life. Sarah was fair to look upon, and he doubted not that\nthe dusky Egyptians would covet the beautiful stranger, and that in\norder to secure her, they would not scruple to slay her husband. He\nreasoned that he was not guilty of falsehood in representing Sarah\nas his sister, for she was the daughter of his father, though not of\nhis mother. But this concealment of the real relation between them\nwas deception. No deviation from strict integrity can meet God\u2019s\napproval. Through Abraham\u2019s lack of faith, Sarah was placed in\ngreat peril. The king of Egypt, being informed of her beauty, caused\nher to be taken to his palace, intending to make her his wife. But\nthe Lord, in His great mercy, protected Sarah by sending judgments\nupon the royal household. By this means the monarch learned the\ntruth in the matter, and, indignant at the deception practiced upon\nhim, he reproved Abraham and restored to him his wife, saying,\n\u201cWhat is this that thou hast done unto me? ... Why saidst thou, She\nis my sister? So I might have taken her to me to wife. Now therefore\nbehold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.\u201d\nAbraham had been greatly favored by the king; even now\nPharaoh would permit no harm to be done him or his company,\nbut ordered a guard to conduct them in safety out of his dominions.\nAt this time laws were made prohibiting the Egyptians from inter-\ncourse with foreign shepherds in any such familiarity as eating or\ndrinking with them. Pharaoh\u2019s dismissal of Abraham was kind and\ngenerous; but he bade him leave Egypt, for he dared not permit him\nto remain. He had ignorantly been about to do him a serious injury,\nbut God had interposed, and saved the monarch from committing[131]\nso great a sin. Pharaoh saw in this stranger a man whom the God of\nheaven honored, and he feared to have in his kingdom one who was\nso evidently under divine favor. Should Abraham remain in Egypt,\nhis increasing wealth and honor would be likely to excite the envy\nor covetousness of the Egyptians, and some injury might be done\nCall of Abraham 109\nhim, for which the monarch would be held responsible, and which\nmight again bring judgments upon the royal house.\nThe warning that had been given to Pharaoh proved a protection\nto Abraham in his after-intercourse with heathen peoples; for the\nmatter could not be kept secret, and it was seen that the God whom\nAbraham worshiped would protect His servant, and that any injury\ndone him would be avenged. It is a dangerous thing to wrong one\nof the children of the King of heaven. The psalmist refers to this\nchapter in Abraham\u2019s experience when he says, in speaking of the\nchosen people, that God \u201creproved kings for their sakes; saying,\nTouch not Mine anointed, and do My prophets no harm.\u201d Psalm\n105:14, 15.\nThere is an interesting similarity between Abraham\u2019s experi-\nence in Egypt and that of his posterity, centuries later. Both went\ndown into Egypt on account of a famine, and both sojourned there.\nThrough the manifestation of divine judgments in their behalf, the\nfear of them fell upon the Egyptians; and, enriched by the gifts of\nthe heathen, they went out with great substance.\nChapter 12\u2014Abraham in Canaan[132]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 13; to 15;; 17: 1-16; 18.\nAbraham returned to Canaan \u201cvery rich in cattle, in silver, and\nin gold.\u201d Lot was still with him, and again they came to Bethel, and\npitched their tents by the altar which they had before erected. They\nsoon found that increased possessions brought increased trouble. In\nthe midst of hardships and trials they had dwelt together in harmony,\nbut in their prosperity there was danger of strife between them. The\npasturage was not sufficient for the flocks and herds of both, and the\nfrequent disputes among the herdsmen were brought for settlement\nto their masters. It was evident that they must separate. Abraham\nwas Lot\u2019s senior in years, and his superior in relation, in wealth, and\nin position; yet he was the first to propose plans for preserving peace.\nAlthough the whole land had been given him by God Himself, he\ncourteously waived this right.\n\u201cLet there be no strife,\u201d he said, \u201cbetween me and thee, and\nbetween my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. Is not\nthe whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me:\nif thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou\ndepart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.\u201d\nHere the noble, unselfish spirit of Abraham was displayed. How\nmany under similar circumstances would, at all hazards, cling to their\nindividual rights and preferences! How many households have thus\nbeen rent asunder! How many churches have been divided, making\nthe cause of truth a byword and a reproach among the wicked! \u201cLet\nthere be no strife between me and thee,\u201d said Abraham, \u201cfor we be\nbrethren;\u201d not only by natural relationship, but as worshipers of the\ntrue God. The children of God the world over are one family, and the\nsame spirit of love and conciliation should govern them. \u201cBe kindly\naffectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring[133]\none another\u201d (Romans 12:10), is the teaching of our Saviour. The\ncultivation of a uniform courtesy, a willingness to do to others as we\n110\nAbraham in Canaan 111\nwould wish them to do to us, would annihilate half the ills of life.\nThe spirit of self-aggrandizement is the spirit of Satan; but the heart\nin which the love of Christ is cherished, will possess that charity\nwhich seeketh not her own. Such will heed the divine injunction,\n\u201cLook not every man on his own things, but every man also on the\nthings of others.\u201d Philippians 2:4.\nAlthough Lot owed his prosperity to his connection with Abra-\nham, he manifested no gratitude to his benefactor. Courtesy would\nhave dictated that he yield the choice to Abraham, but instead of this\nhe selfishly endeavored to grasp all its advantages. He \u201clifted up\nhis eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered\neverywhere, ... even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt,\nas thou comest unto Zoar.\u201d The most fertile region in all Palestine\nwas the Jordan Valley, reminding the beholders of the lost Paradise\nand equaling the beauty and productiveness of the Nile-enriched\nplains they had so lately left. There were cities also, wealthy and\nbeautiful, inviting to profitable traffic in their crowded marts. Daz-\nzled with visions of worldly gain, Lot overlooked the moral and\nspiritual evils that would be encountered there. The inhabitants of\nthe plain were \u201csinners before the Lord exceedingly;\u201d but of this he\nwas ignorant, or, knowing, gave it but little weight. He \u201cchose him\nall the plain of Jordan,\u201d and \u201cpitched his tent toward Sodom.\u201d How\nlittle did he foresee the terrible results of that selfish choice!\nAfter the separation from Lot, Abraham again received from the\nLord a promise of the whole country. Soon after this he removed\nto Hebron, pitching his tent under the oaks of Mamre and erecting\nbeside it an altar to the Lord. In the free air of those upland plains,\nwith their olive groves and vineyards, their fields of waving grain,\nand the wide pasture grounds of the encircling hills, he dwelt, well\ncontent with his simple, patriarchal life, and leaving to Lot the\nperilous luxury of the vale of Sodom.\nAbraham was honored by the surrounding nations as a mighty\nprince and a wise and able chief. He did not shut away his influence\nfrom his neighbors. His life and character, in their marked contrast\nwith those of the worshipers of idols, exerted a telling influence in [134]\nfavor of the true faith. His allegiance to God was unswerving, while\nhis affability and benevolence inspired confidence and friendship\nand his unaffected greatness commanded respect and honor.\n112 Patriarchs and Prophets\nHis religion was not held as a precious treasure to be jealously\nguarded and enjoyed solely by the possessor. True religion cannot\nbe thus held, for such a spirit is contrary to the principles of the\ngospel. While Christ is dwelling in the heart it is impossible to\nconceal the light of His presence, or for that light to grow dim. On\nthe contrary, it will grow brighter and brighter as day by day the\nmists of selfishness and sin that envelop the soul are dispelled by the\nbright beams of the Sun of Righteousness.\nThe people of God are His representatives upon the earth, and\nHe intends that they shall be lights in the moral darkness of this\nworld. Scattered all over the country, in the towns, cities, and vil-\nlages, they are God\u2019s witnesses, the channels through which He will\ncommunicate to an unbelieving world the knowledge of His will and\nthe wonders of His grace. It is His plan that all who are partakers\nof the great salvation shall be missionaries for Him. The piety of\nthe Christian constitutes the standard by which worldlings judge\nthe gospel. Trials patiently borne, blessings gratefully received,\nmeekness, kindness, mercy, and love, habitually exhibited, are the\nlights that shine forth in the character before the world, revealing\nthe contrast with the darkness that comes of the selfishness of the\nnatural heart.\nRich in faith, noble in generosity, unfaltering in obedience, and\nhumble in the simplicity of his pilgrim life, Abraham was also wise\nin diplomacy and brave and skillful in war. Notwithstanding he was\nknown as the teacher of a new religion, three royal brothers, rulers of\nthe Amorite plains in which he dwelt, manifested their friendship by\ninviting him to enter into an alliance with them for greater security;\nfor the country was filled with violence and oppression. An occasion\nsoon arose for him to avail himself of this alliance.\nChedorlaomer, king of Elam, had invaded Canaan fourteen years\nbefore, and made it tributary to him. Several of the princes now\nrevolted, and the Elamite king, with four allies, again marched into\nthe country to reduce them to submission. Five kings of Canaan\njoined their forces and met the invaders in the vale of Siddim, but\nonly to be completely overthrown. A large part of the army was cut[135]\nto pieces, and those who escaped fled for safety to the mountains.\nThe victors plundered the cities of the plain and departed with rich\nspoil and many captives, among whom were Lot and his family.\nAbraham in Canaan 113\nAbraham, dwelling in peace in the oak groves at Mamre, learned\nfrom one of the fugitives the story of the battle and the calamity that\nhad befallen his nephew. He had cherished no unkind memory of\nLot\u2019s ingratitude. All his affection for him was awakened, and he\ndetermined that he should be rescued. Seeking, first of all, divine\ncounsel, Abraham prepared for war. From his own encampment he\nsummoned three hundred and eighteen trained servants, men trained\nin the fear of God, in the service of their master, and in the practice\nof arms. His confederates, Mamre, Eschol, and Aner, joined him\nwith their bands, and together they started in pursuit of the invaders.\nThe Elamites and their allies had encamped at Dan, on the northern\nborder of Canaan. Flushed with victory, and having no fear of an\nassault from their vanquished foes, they had given themselves up\nto reveling. The patriarch divided his force so as to approach from\ndifferent directions, and came upon the encampment by night. His\nattack, so vigorous and unexpected, resulted in speedy victory. The\nking of Elam was slain and his panic-stricken forces were utterly\nrouted. Lot and his family, with all the prisoners and their goods,\nwere recovered, and a rich booty fell into the hands of the victors.\nTo Abraham, under God, the triumph was due. The worshiper of\nJehovah had not only rendered a great service to the country, but\nhad proved himself a man of valor. It was seen that righteousness is\nnot cowardice, and that Abraham\u2019s religion made him courageous\nin maintaining the right and defending the oppressed. His heroic\nact gave him a widespread influence among the surrounding tribes.\nOn his return, the king of Sodom came out with his retinue to\nhonor the conqueror. He bade him take the goods, begging only\nthat the prisoners should be restored. By the usage of war, the\nspoils belonged to the conquerors; but Abraham had undertaken this\nexpedition with no purpose of gain, and he refused to take advantage\nof the unfortunate, only stipulating that his confederates should\nreceive the portion to which they were entitled.\nFew, if subjected to such a test, would have shown themselves\nas noble as did Abraham. Few would have resisted the temptation\nto secure so rich a booty. His example is a rebuke to self-seeking, [136]\nmercenary spirits. Abraham regarded the claims of justice and\nhumanity. His conduct illustrates the inspired maxim, \u201cThou shalt\nlove thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d Leviticus 19:18. \u201cI have lifted up my\n114 Patriarchs and Prophets\nhand,\u201d he said, \u201cunto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor\nof heaven and earth, that I will not take from a thread even to a\nshoe latchet, and that I will not take anything that is thine, lest thou\nshouldest say, I have made Abram rich.\u201d He would give them no\noccasion to think that he had engaged in warfare for the sake of gain,\nor to attribute his prosperity to their gifts or favor. God had promised\nto bless Abraham, and to Him the glory should be ascribed.\nAnother who came out to welcome the victorious patriarch was\nMelchizedek, king of Salem, who brought forth bread and wine\nfor the refreshment of his army. As \u201cpriest of the most high God,\u201d\nhe pronounced a blessing upon Abraham, and gave thanks to the\nLord, who had wrought so great a deliverance by His servant. And\nAbraham \u201cgave him tithes of all.\u201d\nAbraham gladly returned to his tents and his flocks, but his mind\nwas disturbed by harassing thoughts. He had been a man of peace,\nso far as possible shunning enmity and strife; and with horror he\nrecalled the scene of carnage he had witnessed. But the nations\nwhose forces he had defeated would doubtless renew the invasion\nof Canaan, and make him the special object of their vengeance.\nBecoming thus involved in national quarrels, the peaceful quiet of\nhis life would be broken. Furthermore, he had not entered upon the\npossession of Canaan, nor could he now hope for an heir, to whom\nthe promise might be fulfilled.\nIn a vision of the night the divine V oice was again heard. \u201cFear\nnot, Abram,\u201d were the words of the Prince of princes; \u201cI am thy\nshield, and thy exceeding great reward.\u201d But his mind was so op-\npressed by forebodings that he could not now grasp the promise with\nunquestioning confidence as heretofore. He prayed for some tangi-\nble evidence that it would be fulfilled. And how was the covenant\npromise to be realized, while the gift of a son was withheld? \u201cWhat\nwilt Thou give me,\u201d he said, \u201cseeing I go childless?\u201d \u201cAnd, lo, one\nborn in my house is mine heir.\u201d He proposed to make his trusty ser-\nvant Eliezer his son by adoption, and the inheritor of his possessions.\nBut he was assured that a child of his own was to be his heir. Then[137]\nhe was led outside his tent, and told to look up to the unnumbered\nstars glittering in the heavens; and as he did so, the words were\nspoken, \u201cSo shall thy seed be.\u201d \u201cAbraham believed God, and it was\ncounted unto him for righteousness.\u201d Romans 4:3.\nAbraham in Canaan 115\nStill the patriarch begged for some visible token as a confirma-\ntion of his faith and as an evidence to after-generations that God\u2019s\ngracious purposes toward them would be accomplished. The Lord\ncondescended to enter into a covenant with His servant, employing\nsuch forms as were customary among men for the ratification of\na solemn engagement. By divine direction, Abraham sacrificed a\nheifer, a she-goat, and a ram, each three years old, dividing the\nbodies and laying the pieces a little distance apart. To these he added\na turtledove and a young pigeon, which, however, were not divided.\nThis being done, he reverently passed between the parts of the sacri-\nfice, making a solemn vow to God of perpetual obedience. Watchful\nand steadfast, he remained beside the carcasses till the going down\nof the sun, to guard them from being defiled or devoured by birds\nof prey. About sunset he sank into a deep sleep; and, \u201clo, a horror\nof great darkness fell upon him.\u201d And the voice of God was heard,\nbidding him not to expect immediate possession of the Promised\nLand, and pointing forward to the sufferings of his posterity before\ntheir establishment in Canaan. The plan of redemption was here\nopened to him, in the death of Christ, the great sacrifice, and His\ncoming in glory. Abraham saw also the earth restored to its Eden\nbeauty, to be given him for an everlasting possession, as the final\nand complete fulfillment of the promise.\nAs a pledge of this covenant of God with men, a smoking furnace\nand a burning lamp, symbols of the divine presence, passed between\nthe severed victims, totally consuming them. And again a voice was\nheard by Abraham, confirming the gift of the land of Canaan to his\ndescendants, \u201cfrom the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river\nEuphrates.\u201d\nWhen Abraham had been nearly twenty-five years in Canaan,\nthe Lord appeared unto him, and said, \u201cI am the Almighty God;\nwalk before Me, and be thou perfect.\u201d In awe, the patriarch fell upon\nhis face, and the message continued: \u201cBehold, My covenant is with\nthee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.\u201d In token of the [138]\nfulfillment of this covenant, his name, heretofore called Abram, was\nchanged to Abraham, which signifies, \u201cfather of a great multitude.\u201d\nSarai\u2019s name became Sarah\u2014\u201cprincess;\u201d for, said the divine V oice,\n\u201cshe shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.\u201d\n116 Patriarchs and Prophets\nAt this time the rite of circumcision was given to Abraham\nas \u201ca seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being\nuncircumcised.\u201d Romans 4:11. It was to be observed by the patriarch\nand his descendants as a token that they were devoted to the service\nof God and thus separated from idolaters, and that God accepted\nthem as His peculiar treasure. By this rite they were pledged to fulfill,\non their part, the conditions of the covenant made with Abraham.\nThey were not to contract marriages with the heathen; for by so\ndoing they would lose their reverence for God and His holy law;\nthey would be tempted to engage in the sinful practices of other\nnations, and would be seduced into idolatry.\nGod conferred great honor upon Abraham. Angels of heaven\nwalked and talked with him as friend with friend. When judgments\nwere about to be visited upon Sodom, the fact was not hidden from\nhim, and he became an intercessor with God for sinners. His inter-\nview with the angels presents also a beautiful example of hospitality.\nIn the hot summer noontide the patriarch was sitting in his tent\ndoor, looking out over the quiet landscape, when he saw in the\ndistance three travelers approaching. Before reaching his tent, the\nstrangers halted, as if consulting as to their course. Without waiting\nfor them to solicit favors, Abraham rose quickly, and as they were\napparently turning in another direction, he hastened after them, and\nwith the utmost courtesy urged them to honor him by tarrying for\nrefreshment. With his own hands he brought water that they might\nwash the dust of travel from their feet. He himself selected their food,\nand while they were at rest under the cooling shade, an entertainment\nwas made ready, and he stood respectfully beside them while they\npartook of his hospitality. This act of courtesy God regarded of\nsufficient importance to record in His word; and a thousand years\nlater it was referred to by an inspired apostle: \u201cBe not forgetful\nto entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels\nunawares.\u201d Hebrews 13:2.\nAbraham had seen in his guests only three tired wayfarers, little[139]\nthinking that among them was One whom he might worship without\nsin. But the true character of the heavenly messengers was now\nrevealed. Though they were on their way as ministers of wrath, yet\nto Abraham, the man of faith, they spoke first of blessings. Though\nGod is strict to mark iniquity and to punish transgression, He takes\nAbraham in Canaan 117\nno delight in vengeance. The work of destruction is a \u201cstrange work\u201d\nto Him who is infinite in love.\n\u201cThe secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him.\u201d Psalm 25:14.\nAbraham had honored God, and the Lord honored him, taking him\ninto His counsels, and revealing to him His purposes. \u201cShall I\nhide from Abraham that thing which I do?\u201d said the Lord. \u201cThe\ncry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very\ngrievous, I will go down now, and see whether they have done\naltogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if\nnot, I will know.\u201d God knew well the measure of Sodom\u2019s guilt; but\nHe expressed Himself after the manner of men, that the justice of\nHis dealings might be understood. Before bringing judgment upon\nthe transgressors He would go Himself, to institute an examination\nof their course; if they had not passed the limits of divine mercy, He\nwould still grant them space for repentance.\nTwo of the heavenly messengers departed, leaving Abraham\nalone with Him whom he now knew to be the Son of God. And\nthe man of faith pleaded for the inhabitants of Sodom. Once he had\nsaved them by his sword, now he endeavored to save them by prayer.\nLot and his household were still dwellers there; and the unselfish\nlove that prompted Abraham to their rescue from the Elamites, now\nsought to save them, if it were God\u2019s will, from the storm of divine\njudgment.\nWith deep reverence and humility he urged his plea: \u201cI have\ntaken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes.\u201d\nThere was no self-confidence, no boasting of his own righteousness.\nHe did not claim favor on the ground of his obedience, or of the sac-\nrifices he had made in doing God\u2019s will. Himself a sinner, he pleaded\nin the sinner\u2019s behalf. Such a spirit all who approach God should\npossess. Yet Abraham manifested the confidence of a child pleading\nwith a loved father. He came close to the heavenly Messenger, and\nfervently urged his petition. Though Lot had become a dweller in\nSodom, he did not partake in the iniquity of its inhabitants. Abraham\nthought that in that populous city there must be other worshipers\nof the true God. And in view of this he pleaded, \u201cThat be far from [140]\nThee, to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked:\n... that be far from Thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do\nright?\u201d Abraham asked not once merely, but many times. Waxing\n118 Patriarchs and Prophets\nbolder as his requests were granted, he continued until he gained the\nassurance that if even ten righteous persons could be found in it, the\ncity would be spared.\nLove for perishing souls inspired Abraham\u2019s prayer. While he\nloathed the sins of that corrupt city, he desired that the sinners might\nbe saved. His deep interest for Sodom shows the anxiety that we\nshould feel for the impenitent. We should cherish hatred of sin, but\npity and love for the sinner. All around us are souls going down\nto ruin as hopeless, as terrible, as that which befell Sodom. Every\nday the probation of some is closing. Every hour some are passing\nbeyond the reach of mercy. And where are the voices of warning\nand entreaty to bid the sinner flee from this fearful doom? Where\nare the hands stretched out to draw him back from death? Where\nare those who with humility and persevering faith are pleading with\nGod for him?\nThe spirit of Abraham was the spirit of Christ. The Son of\nGod is Himself the great Intercessor in the sinner\u2019s behalf. He\nwho has paid the price for its redemption knows the worth of the\nhuman soul. With an antagonism to evil such as can exist only in a\nnature spotlessly pure, Christ manifested toward the sinner a love\nwhich infinite goodness alone could conceive. In the agonies of the\ncrucifixion, Himself burdened with the awful weight of the sins of\nthe whole world, He prayed for His revilers and murderers, \u201cFather,\nforgive them; for they know not what they do.\u201d Luke 23:34.\nOf Abraham it is written that \u201che was called the friend of God,\u201d\n\u201cthe father of all them that believe.\u201d James 2:23; Romans 4:11. The\ntestimony of God concerning this faithful patriarch is, \u201cAbraham\nobeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My\nstatutes, and My laws.\u201d And again, \u201cI know him, that he will com-\nmand his children and his household after him, and they shall keep\nthe way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may\nbring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.\u201d It was a\nhigh honor to which Abraham was called, that of being the father\nof the people who for centuries were the guardians and preservers\nof the truth of God for the world\u2014of that people through whom[141]\nall the nations of the earth should be blessed in the advent of the\npromised Messiah. But He who called the patriarch judged him wor-\nthy. It is God that speaks. He who understands the thoughts afar off,\nAbraham in Canaan 119\nand places the right estimate upon men, says, \u201cI know him.\u201d There\nwould be on the part of Abraham no betraying of the truth for selfish\npurposes. He would keep the law and deal justly and righteously.\nAnd he would not only fear the Lord himself, but would cultivate\nreligion in his home. He would instruct his family in righteousness.\nThe law of God would be the rule in his household.\nAbraham\u2019s household comprised more than a thousand souls.\nThose who were led by his teachings to worship the one God, found\na home in his encampment; and here, as in a school, they received\nsuch instruction as would prepare them to be representatives of the\ntrue faith. Thus a great responsibility rested upon him. He was\ntraining heads of families, and his methods of government would be\ncarried out in the households over which they should preside.\nIn early times the father was the ruler and priest of his own family,\nand he exercised authority over his children, even after they had\nfamilies of their own. His descendants were taught to look up to him\nas their head, in both religious and secular matters. This patriarchal\nsystem of government Abraham endeavored to perpetuate, as it\ntended to preserve the knowledge of God. It was necessary to bind\nthe members of the household together, in order to build up a barrier\nagainst the idolatry that had become so widespread and so deep-\nseated. Abraham sought by every means in his power to guard the\ninmates of his encampment against mingling with the heathen and\nwitnessing their idolatrous practices, for he knew that familiarity\nwith evil would insensibly corrupt the principles. The greatest care\nwas exercised to shut out every form of false religion and to impress\nthe mind with the majesty and glory of the living God as the true\nobject of worship.\nIt was a wise arrangement, which God Himself had made, to\ncut off His people, so far as possible, from connection with the\nheathen, making them a people dwelling alone, and not reckoned\namong the nations. He had separated Abraham from his idolatrous\nkindred, that the patriarch might train and educate his family apart\nfrom the seductive influences which would have surrounded them in [142]\nMesopotamia, and that the true faith might be preserved in its purity\nby his descendants from generation to generation.\nAbraham\u2019s affection for his children and his household led him\nto guard their religious faith, to impart to them a knowledge of the\n120 Patriarchs and Prophets\ndivine statutes, as the most precious legacy he could transmit to\nthem, and through them to the world. All were taught that they were\nunder the rule of the God of heaven. There was to be no oppression\non the part of parents and no disobedience on the part of children.\nGod\u2019s law had appointed to each his duties, and only in obedience\nto it could any secure happiness or prosperity.\nHis own example, the silent influence of his daily life, was a\nconstant lesson. The unswerving integrity, the benevolence and\nunselfish courtesy, which had won the admiration of kings, were\ndisplayed in the home. There was a fragrance about the life, a\nnobility and loveliness of character, which revealed to all that he was\nconnected with Heaven. He did not neglect the soul of the humblest\nservant. In his household there was not one law for the master and\nanother for the servant; a royal way for the rich and another for the\npoor. All were treated with justice and compassion, as inheritors\nwith him of the grace of life.\n\u201cHe will command his ... household.\u201d There would be no sinful\nneglect to restrain the evil propensities of his children, no weak,\nunwise, indulgent favoritism; no yielding of his conviction of duty\nto the claims of mistaken affection. Abraham would not only give\nright instruction, but he would maintain the authority of just and\nrighteous laws.\nHow few there are in our day who follow this example! On the\npart of too many parents there is a blind and selfish sentimental-\nism, miscalled love, which is manifested in leaving children, with\ntheir unformed judgment and undisciplined passions, to the con-\ntrol of their own will. This is the veriest cruelty to the youth and\na great wrong to the world. Parental indulgence causes disorder\nin families and in society. It confirms in the young the desire to\nfollow inclination, instead of submitting to the divine requirements.\nThus they grow up with a heart averse to doing God\u2019s will, and they\ntransmit their irreligious, insubordinate spirit to their children and\nchildren\u2019s children. Like Abraham, parents should command their\nhouseholds after them. Let obedience to parental authority be taught[143]\nand enforced as the first step in obedience to the authority of God.\nThe light esteem in which the law of God is held, even by reli-\ngious leaders, has been productive of great evil. The teaching which\nhas become so widespread, that the divine statutes are no longer\nAbraham in Canaan 121\nbinding upon men, is the same as idolatry in its effect upon the\nmorals of the people. Those who seek to lessen the claims of God\u2019s\nholy law are striking directly at the foundation of the government\nof families and nations. Religious parents, failing to walk in His\nstatutes, do not command their household to keep the way of the\nLord. The law of God is not made the rule of life. The children,\nas they make homes of their own, feel under no obligation to teach\ntheir children what they themselves have never been taught. And\nthis is why there are so many godless families; this is why depravity\nis so deep and widespread.\nNot until parents themselves walk in the law of the Lord with\nperfect hearts will they be prepared to command their children after\nthem. A reformation in this respect is needed\u2014a reformation which\nshall be deep and broad. Parents need to reform; ministers need\nto reform; they need God in their households. If they would see a\ndifferent state of things, they must bring His word into their families\nand must make it their counselor. They must teach their children\nthat it is the voice of God addressed to them, and is to be implicitly\nobeyed. They should patiently instruct their children, kindly and\nuntiringly teach them how to live in order to please God. The\nchildren of such a household are prepared to meet the sophistries\nof infidelity. They have accepted the Bible as the basis of their\nfaith, and they have a foundation that cannot be swept away by the\nincoming tide of skepticism.\nIn too many households prayer is neglected. Parents feel that they\nhave no time for morning and evening worship. They cannot spare a\nfew moments to be spent in thanksgiving to God for His abundant\nmercies\u2014for the blessed sunshine and the showers of rain, which\ncause vegetation to flourish, and for the guardianship of holy angels.\nThey have no time to offer prayer for divine help and guidance and\nfor the abiding presence of Jesus in the household. They go forth\nto labor as the ox or the horse goes, without one thought of God or\nheaven. They have souls so precious that rather than permit them to\nbe hopelessly lost, the Son of God gave His life to ransom them; but\nthey have little more appreciation of His great goodness than have [144]\nthe beasts that perish.\nLike the patriarchs of old, those who profess to love God should\nerect an altar to the Lord wherever they pitch their tent. If ever\n122 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthere was a time when every house should be a house of prayer,\nit is now. Fathers and mothers should often lift up their hearts to\nGod in humble supplication for themselves and their children. Let\nthe father, as priest of the household, lay upon the altar of God the\nmorning and evening sacrifice, while the wife and children unite in\nprayer and praise. In such a household Jesus will love to tarry.\nFrom every Christian home a holy light should shine forth. Love\nshould be revealed in action. It should flow out in all home inter-\ncourse, showing itself in thoughtful kindness, in gentle, unselfish\ncourtesy. There are homes where this principle is carried out\u2014\nhomes where God is worshiped and truest love reigns. From these\nhomes morning and evening prayer ascends to God as sweet incense,\nand His mercies and blessings descend upon the suppliants like the\nmorning dew.\nA well-ordered Christian household is a powerful argument in\nfavor of the reality of the Christian religion\u2014an argument that the\ninfidel cannot gainsay. All can see that there is an influence at work\nin the family that affects the children, and that the God of Abraham is\nwith them. If the homes of professed Christians had a right religious\nmold, they would exert a mighty influence for good. They would\nindeed be the \u201clight of the world.\u201d The God of heaven speaks to\nevery faithful parent in the words addressed to Abraham: \u201cI know\nhim, that he will command his children and his household after him,\nand they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment;\nthat the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken\nof him.\u201d\nChapter 13\u2014The Test of Faith [145]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 16; 17:18-20; 21:1-14; 22:1-19.\nAbraham had accepted without question the promise of a son, but\nhe did not wait for God to fulfill His word in His own time and way.\nA delay was permitted, to test his faith in the power of God; but he\nfailed to endure the trial. Thinking it impossible that a child should\nbe given her in her old age, Sarah suggested, as a plan by which\nthe divine purpose might be fulfilled, that one of her handmaidens\nshould be taken by Abraham as a secondary wife. Polygamy had\nbecome so widespread that it had ceased to be regarded as a sin, but\nit was no less a violation of the law of God, and was fatal to the\nsacredness and peace of the family relation. Abraham\u2019s marriage\nwith Hagar resulted in evil, not only to his own household, but to\nfuture generations.\nFlattered with the honor of her new position as Abraham\u2019s wife,\nand hoping to be the mother of the great nation to descend from\nhim, Hagar became proud and boastful, and treated her mistress with\ncontempt. Mutual jealousies disturbed the peace of the once happy\nhome. Forced to listen to the complaints of both, Abraham vainly\nendeavored to restore harmony. Though it was at Sarah\u2019s earnest\nentreaty that he had married Hagar, she now reproached him as the\none at fault. She desired to banish her rival; but Abraham refused to\npermit this; for Hagar was to be the mother of his child, as he fondly\nhoped, the son of promise. She was Sarah\u2019s servant, however, and\nhe still left her to the control of her mistress. Hagar\u2019s haughty spirit\nwould not brook the harshness which her insolence had provoked.\n\u201cWhen Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.\u201d\nShe made her way to the desert, and as she rested beside a\nfountain, lonely and friendless, an angel of the Lord, in human form,\nappeared to her. Addressing her as \u201cHagar, Sarai\u2019s maid,\u201d to remind\nher of her position and her duty, he bade her, \u201cReturn to thy mistress, [146]\nand submit thyself under her hands.\u201d Yet with the reproof there were\n123\n124 Patriarchs and Prophets\nmingled words of comfort. \u201cThe Lord hath heard thy affliction.\u201d \u201cI\nwill multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered\nfor multitude.\u201d And as a perpetual reminder of His mercy, she was\nbidden to call her child Ishmael, \u201cGod shall hear.\u201d\nWhen Abraham was nearly one hundred years old, the promise\nof a son was repeated to him, with the assurance that the future heir\nshould be the child of Sarah. But Abraham did not yet understand the\npromise. His mind at once turned to Ishmael, clinging to the belief\nthat through him God\u2019s gracious purposes were to be accomplished.\nIn his affection for his son he exclaimed, \u201cO that Ishmael might live\nbefore Thee!\u201d Again the promise was given, in words that could\nnot be mistaken: \u201cSarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and\nthou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish My covenant with\nhim.\u201d Yet God was not unmindful of the father\u2019s prayer. \u201cAs for\nIshmael,\u201d He said, \u201cI have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him,\n... and I will make him a great nation.\u201d\nThe birth of Isaac, bringing, after a lifelong waiting, the fulfill-\nment of their dearest hopes, filled the tents of Abraham and Sarah\nwith gladness. But to Hagar this event was the overthrow of her\nfondly cherished ambitions. Ishmael, now a youth, had been re-\ngarded by all in the encampment as the heir of Abraham\u2019s wealth\nand the inheritor of the blessings promised to his descendants. Now\nhe was suddenly set aside; and in their disappointment, mother\nand son hated the child of Sarah. The general rejoicing increased\ntheir jealousy, until Ishmael dared openly to mock the heir of God\u2019s\npromise. Sarah saw in Ishmael\u2019s turbulent disposition a perpetual\nsource of discord, and she appealed to Abraham, urging that Hagar\nand Ishmael be sent away from the encampment. The patriarch was\nthrown into great distress. How could he banish Ishmael his son, still\ndearly beloved? In his perplexity he pleaded for divine guidance.\nThe Lord, through a holy angel, directed him to grant Sarah\u2019s desire;\nhis love for Ishmael or Hagar ought not to stand in the way, for only\nthus could he restore harmony and happiness to his family. And the\nangel gave him the consoling promise that though separated from\nhis father\u2019s home, Ishmael should not be forsaken by God; his life\nshould be preserved, and he should become the father of a great\nnation. Abraham obeyed the angel\u2019s word, but it was not without[147]\nTest of Faith 125\nkeen suffering. The father\u2019s heart was heavy with unspoken grief as\nhe sent away Hagar and his son.\nThe instruction given to Abraham touching the sacredness of\nthe marriage relation was to be a lesson for all ages. It declares that\nthe rights and happiness of this relation are to be carefully guarded,\neven at a great sacrifice. Sarah was the only true wife of Abraham.\nHer rights as a wife and mother no other person was entitled to\nshare. She reverenced her husband, and in this she is presented in\nthe New Testament as a worthy example. But she was unwilling\nthat Abraham\u2019s affections should be given to another, and the Lord\ndid not reprove her for requiring the banishment of her rival. Both\nAbraham and Sarah distrusted the power of God, and it was this\nerror that led to the marriage with Hagar.\nGod had called Abraham to be the father of the faithful, and his\nlife was to stand as an example of faith to succeeding generations.\nBut his faith had not been perfect. He had shown distrust of God\nin concealing the fact that Sarah was his wife, and again in his\nmarriage with Hagar. That he might reach the highest standard, God\nsubjected him to another test, the closest which man was ever called\nto endure. In a vision of the night he was directed to repair to the\nland of Moriah, and there offer up his son as a burnt offering upon a\nmountain that should be shown him.\nAt the time of receiving this command, Abraham had reached\nthe age of a hundred and twenty years. He was regarded as an old\nman, even in his generation. In his earlier years he had been strong\nto endure hardship and to brave danger, but now the ardor of his\nyouth had passed away. One in the vigor of manhood may with\ncourage meet difficulties and afflictions that would cause his heart\nto fail later in life, when his feet are faltering toward the grave. But\nGod had reserved His last, most trying test for Abraham until the\nburden of years was heavy upon him, and he longed for rest from\nanxiety and toil.\nThe patriarch was dwelling at Beersheba, surrounded by prosper-\nity and honor. He was very rich, and was honored as a mighty prince\nby the rulers of the land. Thousands of sheep and cattle covered the\nplains that spread out beyond his encampment. On every side were\nthe tents of his retainers, the home of hundreds of faithful servants.\nThe son of promise had grown up to manhood by his side. Heaven\n126 Patriarchs and Prophets\nseemed to have crowned with its blessing a life of sacrifice in patient[148]\nendurance of hope deferred.\nIn the obedience of faith, Abraham had forsaken his native coun-\ntry\u2014had turned away from the graves of his fathers and the home\nof his kindred. He had wandered as a stranger in the land of his\ninheritance. He had waited long for the birth of the promised heir.\nAt the command of God he had sent away his son Ishmael. And\nnow, when the child so long desired was entering upon manhood,\nand the patriarch seemed able to discern the fruition of his hopes, a\ntrial greater than all others was before him.\nThe command was expressed in words that must have wrung\nwith anguish that father\u2019s heart: \u201cTake now thy son, thine only son\nIsaac, whom thou lovest, ... and offer him there for a burnt offering.\u201d\nIsaac was the light of his home, the solace of his old age, above all\nelse the inheritor of the promised blessing. The loss of such a son\nby accident or disease would have been heart rending to the fond\nfather; it would have bowed down his whitened head with grief; but\nhe was commanded to shed the blood of that son with his own hand.\nIt seemed to him a fearful impossibility.\nSatan was at hand to suggest that he must be deceived, for the\ndivine law commands, \u201cThou shalt not kill,\u201d and God would not\nrequire what He had once forbidden. Going outside his tent, Abra-\nham looked up to the calm brightness of the unclouded heavens,\nand recalled the promise made nearly fifty years before, that his\nseed should be innumerable as the stars. If this promise was to be\nfulfilled through Isaac, how could he be put to death? Abraham\nwas tempted to believe that he might be under a delusion. In his\ndoubt and anguish he bowed upon the earth, and prayed, as he had\nnever prayed before, for some confirmation of the command if he\nmust perform this terrible duty. He remembered the angels sent to\nreveal to him God\u2019s purpose to destroy Sodom, and who bore to him\nthe promise of this same son Isaac, and he went to the place where\nhe had several times met the heavenly messengers, hoping to meet\nthem again, and receive some further direction; but none came to\nhis relief. Darkness seemed to shut him in; but the command of God\nwas sounding in his ears, \u201cTake now thy son, thine only son Isaac,\nwhom thou lovest.\u201d That command must be obeyed, and he dared\nnot delay. Day was approaching, and he must be on his journey.\nTest of Faith 127\nReturning to his tent, he went to the place where Isaac lay sleep-\ning the deep, untroubled sleep of youth and innocence. For a moment [149]\n[150]\n[151]\nthe father looked upon the dear face of his son, then turned trem-\nblingly away. He went to the side of Sarah, who was also sleeping.\nShould he awaken her, that she might once more embrace her child?\nShould he tell her of God\u2019s requirement? He longed to unburden his\nheart to her, and share with her this terrible responsibility; but he\nwas restrained by the fear that she might hinder him. Isaac was her\njoy and pride; her life was bound up in him, and the mother\u2019s love\nmight refuse the sacrifice.\nAbraham at last summoned his son, telling him of the command\nto offer sacrifice upon a distant mountain. Isaac had often gone with\nhis father to worship at some one of the various altars that marked his\nwanderings, and this summons excited no surprise. The preparations\nfor the journey were quickly completed. The wood was made ready\nand put upon the ass, and with two menservants they set forth.\nSide by side the father and the son journeyed in silence. The\npatriarch, pondering his heavy secret, had no heart for words. His\nthoughts were of the proud, fond mother, and the day when he should\nreturn to her alone. Well he knew that the knife would pierce her\nheart when it took the life of her son.\nThat day\u2014the longest that Abraham had ever experienced\u2014\ndragged slowly to its close. While his son and the young men\nwere sleeping, he spent the night in prayer, still hoping that some\nheavenly messenger might come to say that the trial was enough, that\nthe youth might return unharmed to his mother. But no relief came to\nhis tortured soul. Another long day, another night of humiliation and\nprayer, while ever the command that was to leave him childless was\nringing in his ears. Satan was near to whisper doubts and unbelief,\nbut Abraham resisted his suggestions. As they were about to begin\nthe journey of the third day, the patriarch, looking northward, saw\nthe promised sign, a cloud of glory hovering over Mount Moriah, and\nhe knew that the voice which had spoken to him was from heaven.\nEven now he did not murmur against God, but strengthened his\nsoul by dwelling upon the evidences of the Lord\u2019s goodness and\nfaithfulness. This son had been unexpectedly given; and had not He\nwho bestowed the precious gift a right to recall His own? Then faith\nrepeated the promise, \u201cIn Isaac shall thy seed be called\u201d\u2014a seed\n128 Patriarchs and Prophets\nnumberless as the grains of sand upon the shore. Isaac was the child\nof a miracle, and could not the power that gave him life restore it?[152]\nLooking beyond that which was seen, Abraham grasped the divine\nword, \u201caccounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the\ndead.\u201d Hebrews 11:19.\nYet none but God could understand how great was the father\u2019s\nsacrifice in yielding up his son to death; Abraham desired that none\nbut God should witness the parting scene. He bade his servants\nremain behind, saying, \u201cI and the lad will go yonder and worship,\nand come again to you.\u201d The wood was laid upon Isaac, the one\nto be offered, the father took the knife and the fire, and together\nthey ascended toward the mountain summit, the young man silently\nwondering whence, so far from folds and flocks, the offering was to\ncome. At last he spoke, \u201cMy father,\u201d \u201cbehold the fire and the wood:\nbut where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\u201d Oh, what a test was this!\nHow the endearing words, \u201cmy father,\u201d pierced Abraham\u2019s heart!\nNot yet\u2014he could not tell him now. \u201cMy son,\u201d he said, \u201cGod will\nprovide Himself a lamb for a burnt offering.\u201d\nAt the appointed place they built the altar and laid the wood upon\nit. Then, with trembling voice, Abraham unfolded to his son the\ndivine message. It was with terror and amazement that Isaac learned\nhis fate, but he offered no resistance. He could have escaped his\ndoom, had he chosen to do so; the grief-stricken old man, exhausted\nwith the struggle of those three terrible days, could not have opposed\nthe will of the vigorous youth. But Isaac had been trained from\nchildhood to ready, trusting obedience, and as the purpose of God\nwas opened before him, he yielded a willing submission. He was a\nsharer in Abraham\u2019s faith, and he felt that he was honored in being\ncalled to give his life as an offering to God. He tenderly seeks to\nlighten the father\u2019s grief, and encourages his nerveless hands to bind\nthe cords that confine him to the altar.\nAnd now the last words of love are spoken, the last tears are\nshed, the last embrace is given. The father lifts the knife to slay his\nson, when suddenly his arm is stayed. An angel of God calls to the\npatriarch out of heaven, \u201cAbraham, Abraham!\u201d He quickly answers,\n\u201cHere am I,\u201d And again the voice is heard, \u201cLay not thine hand upon\nthe lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that\nTest of Faith 129\nthou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only\nson, from Me.\u201d\nThen Abraham saw \u201ca ram caught in a thicket,\u201d and quickly [153]\nbringing the new victim, he offered it \u201cin the stead of his son.\u201d\nIn his joy and gratitude Abraham gave a new name to the sacred\nspot\u2014\u201cJehovah-jireh,\u201d \u201cthe Lord will provide.\u201d\nOn Mount Moriah, God again renewed His covenant, confirming\nwith a solemn oath the blessing to Abraham and to his seed through\nall coming generations: \u201cBy myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, for\nbecause thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,\nthine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying\nI will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand\nwhich is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his\nenemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;\nbecause thou hast obeyed My voice.\u201d\nAbraham\u2019s great act of faith stands like a pillar of light, illuminat-\ning the pathway of God\u2019s servants in all succeeding ages. Abraham\ndid not seek to excuse himself from doing the will of God. During\nthat three days\u2019 journey he had sufficient time to reason, and to\ndoubt God, if he was disposed to doubt. He might have reasoned\nthat the slaying of his son would cause him to be looked upon as\na murderer, a second Cain; that it would cause his teaching to be\nrejected and despised; and thus destroy his power to do good to his\nfellow men. He might have pleaded that age should excuse him\nfrom obedience. But the patriarch did not take refuge in any of these\nexcuses. Abraham was human; his passions and attachments were\nlike ours; but he did not stop to question how the promise could\nbe fulfilled if Isaac should be slain. He did not stay to reason with\nhis aching heart. He knew that God is just and righteous in all His\nrequirements, and he obeyed the command to the very letter.\n\u201cAbraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righ-\nteousness: and he was called the friend of God.\u201d James 2:23. And\nPaul says, \u201cThey which are of faith, the same are the children of\nAbraham.\u201d Galatians 3:7. But Abraham\u2019s faith was made manifest\nby his works. \u201cWas not Abraham our father justified by works, when\nhe had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith\nwrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?\u201d\nJames 2:21, 22. There are many who fail to understand the relation\n130 Patriarchs and Prophets\nof faith and works. They say, \u201cOnly believe in Christ, and you are\nsafe. You have nothing to do with keeping the law.\u201d But genuine[154]\nfaith will be manifest in obedience. Said Christ to the unbelieving\nJews, \u201cIf ye were Abraham\u2019s children, ye would do the works of\nAbraham.\u201d John 8:39. And concerning the father of the faithful the\nLord declares, \u201cAbraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge,\nMy commandments, My statutes, and My laws.\u201d Genesis 26:5. Says\nthe apostle James, \u201cFaith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.\u201d\nJames 2:17. And John, who dwells so fully upon love, tells us, \u201cThis\nis the love of God, that we keep His commandments.\u201d 1 John 5:3.\nThrough type and promise God \u201cpreached before the gospel\nunto Abraham.\u201d Galatians 3:8. And the patriarch\u2019s faith was fixed\nupon the Redeemer to come. Said Christ to the Jews. \u201cYour father\nAbraham rejoiced that he should see My day; and he saw it, and was\nglad.\u201d John 8:56, R.V ., margin. The ram offered in the place of Isaac\nrepresented the Son of God, who was to be sacrificed in our stead.\nWhen man was doomed to death by transgression of the law of God,\nthe Father, looking upon His Son, said to the sinner, \u201cLive: I have\nfound a ransom.\u201d\nIt was to impress Abraham\u2019s mind with the reality of the gospel,\nas well as to test his faith, that God commanded him to slay his son.\nThe agony which he endured during the dark days of that fearful trial\nwas permitted that he might understand from his own experience\nsomething of the greatness of the sacrifice made by the infinite God\nfor man\u2019s redemption. No other test could have caused Abraham\nsuch torture of soul as did the offering of his son. God gave His\nSon to a death of agony and shame. The angels who witnessed the\nhumiliation and soul anguish of the Son of God were not permitted\nto interpose, as in the case of Isaac. There was no voice to cry, \u201cIt is\nenough.\u201d To save the fallen race, the King of glory yielded up His\nlife. What stronger proof can be given of the infinite compassion\nand love of God? \u201cHe that spared not His own Son, but delivered\nHim up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all\nthings?\u201d Romans 8:32.\nThe sacrifice required of Abraham was not alone for his own\ngood, nor solely for the benefit of succeeding generations; but it was\nalso for the instruction of the sinless intelligences of heaven and\nof other worlds. The field of the controversy between Christ and\nTest of Faith 131\nSatan\u2014the field on which the plan of redemption is wrought out\u2014is\nthe lesson book of the universe. Because Abraham had shown a lack [155]\nof faith in God\u2019s promises, Satan had accused him before the angels\nand before God of having failed to comply with the conditions of the\ncovenant, and as unworthy of its blessings. God desired to prove the\nloyalty of His servant before all heaven, to demonstrate that nothing\nless than perfect obedience can be accepted, and to open more fully\nbefore them the plan of salvation.\nHeavenly beings were witnesses of the scene as the faith of Abra-\nham and the submission of Isaac were tested. The trial was far more\nsevere than that which had been brought upon Adam. Compliance\nwith the prohibition laid upon our first parents involved no suffer-\ning, but the command to Abraham demanded the most agonizing\nsacrifice. All heaven beheld with wonder and admiration Abraham\u2019s\nunfaltering obedience. All heaven applauded his fidelity. Satan\u2019s ac-\ncusations were shown to be false. God declared to His servant, \u201cNow\nI know that thou fearest God [notwithstanding Satan\u2019s charges], see-\ning thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from Me.\u201d God\u2019s\ncovenant, confirmed to Abraham by an oath before the intelligences\nof other worlds, testified that obedience will be rewarded.\nIt had been difficult even for the angels to grasp the mystery of\nredemption\u2014to comprehend that the Commander of heaven, the\nSon of God, must die for guilty man. When the command was given\nto Abraham to offer up his son, the interest of all heavenly beings\nwas enlisted. With intense earnestness they watched each step in the\nfulfillment of this command. When to Isaac\u2019s question, \u201cWhere is\nthe lamb for a burnt offering?\u201d Abraham made answer, \u201cGod will\nprovide Himself a lamb;\u201d and when the father\u2019s hand was stayed as\nhe was about to slay his son, and the ram which God had provided\nwas offered in the place of Isaac\u2014then light was shed upon the\nmystery of redemption, and even the angels understood more clearly\nthe wonderful provision that God had made for man\u2019s salvation. 1\nPeter 1:12.\nChapter 14\u2014Destruction of Sodom[156]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 19.\nFairest among the cities of the Jordan Valley was Sodom, set\nin a plain which was \u201cas the garden of the Lord\u201d in its fertility and\nbeauty. Here the luxuriant vegetation of the tropics flourished. Here\nwas the home of the palm tree, the olive, and the vine; and flowers\nshed their fragrance throughout the year. Rich harvests clothed the\nfields, and flocks and herds covered the encircling hills. Art and\ncommerce contributed to enrich the proud city of the plain. The\ntreasures of the East adorned her palaces, and the caravans of the\ndesert brought their stores of precious things to supply her marts\nof trade. With little thought or labor, every want of life could be\nsupplied, and the whole year seemed one round of festivity.\nThe profusion reigning everywhere gave birth to luxury and\npride. Idleness and riches make the heart hard that has never been\noppressed by want or burdened by sorrow. The love of pleasure was\nfostered by wealth and leisure, and the people gave themselves up to\nsensual indulgence. \u201cBehold,\u201d says the prophet, \u201cthis was the iniq-\nuity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of\nidleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen\nthe hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and com-\nmitted abomination before Me: therefore I took them away as I saw\ngood.\u201d Ezekiel 16:49, 50. There is nothing more desired among\nmen than riches and leisure, and yet these gave birth to the sins that\nbrought destruction upon the cities of the plain. Their useless, idle\nlife made them a prey to Satan\u2019s temptations, and they defaced the\nimage of God, and became satanic rather than divine. Idleness is\nthe greatest curse that can fall upon man, for vice and crime follow\nin its train. It enfeebles the mind, perverts the understanding, and\ndebases the soul. Satan lies in ambush, ready to destroy those who\nare unguarded, whose leisure gives him opportunity to insinuate[157]\n132\nDestruction of Sodom 133\nhimself under some attractive disguise. He is never more successful\nthan when he comes to men in their idle hours.\nIn Sodom there was mirth and revelry, feasting and drunken-\nness. The vilest and most brutal passions were unrestrained. The\npeople openly defied God and His law and delighted in deeds of vio-\nlence. Though they had before them the example of the antediluvian\nworld, and knew how the wrath of God had been manifested in their\ndestruction, yet they followed the same course of wickedness.\nAt the time of Lot\u2019s removal to Sodom, corruption had not be-\ncome universal, and God in His mercy permitted rays of light to\nshine amid the moral darkness. When Abraham rescued the cap-\ntives from the Elamites, the attention of the people was called to\nthe true faith. Abraham was not a stranger to the people of Sodom,\nand his worship of the unseen God had been a matter of ridicule\namong them; but his victory over greatly superior forces, and his\nmagnanimous disposition of the prisoners and spoil, excited wonder\nand admiration. While his skill and valor were extolled, none could\navoid the conviction that a divine power had made him conqueror.\nAnd his noble and unselfish spirit, so foreign to the self-seeking\ninhabitants of Sodom, was another evidence of the superiority of the\nreligion which he had honored by his courage and fidelity.\nMelchizedek, in bestowing the benediction upon Abraham, had\nacknowledged Jehovah as the source of his strength and the author\nof the victory: \u201cBlessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor\nof heaven and earth: and blessed be the most high God, which hath\ndelivered thine enemies into thy hand.\u201d Genesis 14:19, 20. God was\nspeaking to that people by His providence, but the last ray of light\nwas rejected as all before had been.\nAnd now the last night of Sodom was approaching. Already the\nclouds of vengeance cast their shadows over the devoted city. But\nmen perceived it not. While angels drew near on their mission of\ndestruction, men were dreaming of prosperity and pleasure. The last\nday was like every other that had come and gone. Evening fell upon\na scene of loveliness and security. A landscape of unrivaled beauty\nwas bathed in the rays of the declining sun. The coolness of eventide\nhad called forth the inhabitants of the city, and the pleasure-seeking [158]\nthrongs were passing to and fro, intent upon the enjoyment of the\nhour.\n134 Patriarchs and Prophets\nIn the twilight two strangers drew near to the city gate. They\nwere apparently travelers coming in to tarry for the night. None\ncould discern in those humble wayfarers the mighty heralds of divine\njudgment, and little dreamed the gay, careless multitude that in their\ntreatment of these heavenly messengers that very night they would\nreach the climax of the guilt which doomed their proud city. But\nthere was one man who manifested kindly attention toward the\nstrangers and invited them to his home. Lot did not know their true\ncharacter, but politeness and hospitality were habitual with him; they\nwere a part of his religion\u2014lessons that he had learned from the\nexample of Abraham. Had he not cultivated a spirit of courtesy,\nhe might have been left to perish with the rest of Sodom. Many a\nhousehold, in closing its doors against a stranger, has shut out God\u2019s\nmessenger, who would have brought blessing and hope and peace.\nEvery act of life, however small, has its bearing for good or for\nevil. Faithfulness or neglect in what are apparently the smallest\nduties may open the door for life\u2019s richest blessings or its greatest\ncalamities. It is little things that test the character. It is the unpre-\ntending acts of daily self-denial, performed with a cheerful, willing\nheart, that God smiles upon. We are not to live for self, but for others.\nAnd it is only by self-forgetfulness, by cherishing a loving, helpful\nspirit, that we can make our life a blessing. The little attentions,\nthe small, simple courtesies, go far to make up the sum of life\u2019s\nhappiness, and the neglect of these constitutes no small share of\nhuman wretchedness.\nSeeing the abuse to which strangers were exposed in Sodom, Lot\nmade it one of his duties to guard them at their entrance, by offering\nthem entertainment at his own house. He was sitting at the gate as\nthe travelers approached, and upon observing them, he rose from\nhis place to meet them, and bowing courteously, said, \u201cBehold now,\nmy lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant\u2019s house, and tarry all\nnight.\u201d They seemed to decline his hospitality, saying, \u201cNay; but we\nwill abide in the street.\u201d Their object in this answer was twofold\u2014to\ntest the sincerity of Lot and also to appear ignorant of the character\nof the men of Sodom, as if they supposed it safe to remain in the\nstreet at night. Their answer made Lot the more determined not to[159]\nleave them to the mercy of the rabble. He pressed his invitation until\nthey yielded, and accompanied him to his house.\nDestruction of Sodom 135\nHe had hoped to conceal his intention from the idlers at the gate\nby bringing the strangers to his home by a circuitous route; but their\nhesitation and delay, and his persistent urging, caused them to be\nobserved, and before they had retired for the night, a lawless crowd\ngathered about the house. It was an immense company, youth and\naged men alike inflamed by the vilest passions. The strangers had\nbeen making inquiry in regard to the character of the city, and Lot\nhad warned them not to venture out of his door that night, when the\nhooting and jeers of the mob were heard, demanding that the men\nbe brought out to them.\nKnowing that if provoked to violence they could easily break\ninto his house, Lot went out to try the effect of persuasion upon them.\n\u201cI pray you, brethren,\u201d he said, \u201cdo not so wickedly,\u201d using the term\n\u201cbrethren\u201d in the sense of neighbors, and hoping to conciliate them\nand make them ashamed of their vile purposes. But his words were\nlike oil upon the flames. Their rage became like the roaring of a\ntempest. They mocked Lot as making himself a judge over them, and\nthreatened to deal worse with him than they had purposed toward\nhis guests. They rushed upon him, and would have torn him in\npieces had he not been rescued by the angels of God. The heavenly\nmessengers \u201cput forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to\nthem, and shut to the door.\u201d The events that followed, revealed the\ncharacter of the guests he had entertained. \u201cThey smote the men that\nwere at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great:\nso that they wearied themselves to find the door.\u201d Had they not been\nvisited with double blindness, being given up to hardness of heart,\nthe stroke of God upon them would have caused them to fear, and to\ndesist from their evil work. That last night was marked by no greater\nsins than many others before it; but mercy, so long slighted, had at\nlast ceased its pleading. The inhabitants of Sodom had passed the\nlimits of divine forbearance\u2014\u201cthe hidden boundary between God\u2019s\npatience and His wrath.\u201d The fires of His vengeance were about to\nbe kindled in the vale of Siddim.\nThe angels revealed to Lot the object of their mission: \u201cWe will\ndestroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before\nthe face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.\u201d The [160]\nstrangers whom Lot had endeavored to protect, now promised to\nprotect him, and to save also all the members of his family who\n136 Patriarchs and Prophets\nwould flee with him from the wicked city. The mob had wearied\nthemselves out and departed, and Lot went out to warn his children.\nHe repeated the words of the angels, \u201cUp, get you out of this place;\nfor the Lord will destroy this city.\u201d But he seemed to them as one that\nmocked. They laughed at what they called his superstitious fears.\nHis daughters were influenced by their husbands. They were well\nenough off where they were. They could see no evidence of danger.\nEverything was just as it had been. They had great possessions, and\nthey could not believe it possible that beautiful Sodom would be\ndestroyed.\nLot returned sorrowfully to his home and told the story of his\nfailure. Then the angels bade him arise and take his wife and the\ntwo daughters who were yet in his house and leave the city. But Lot\ndelayed. Though daily distressed at beholding deeds of violence,\nhe had no true conception of the debasing and abominable iniquity\npracticed in that vile city. He did not realize the terrible necessity\nfor God\u2019s judgments to put a check on sin. Some of his children\nclung to Sodom, and his wife refused to depart without them. The\nthought of leaving those whom he held dearest on earth seemed\nmore than he could bear. It was hard to forsake his luxurious home\nand all the wealth acquired by the labors of his whole life, to go\nforth a destitute wanderer. Stupefied with sorrow, he lingered, loath\nto depart. But for the angels of God, they would all have perished in\nthe ruin of Sodom. The heavenly messengers took him and his wife\nand daughters by the hand and led them out of the city.\nHere the angels left them, and turned back to Sodom to accom-\nplish their work of destruction. Another\u2014He with whom Abraham\nhad pleaded\u2014drew near to Lot. In all the cities of the plain, even ten\nrighteous persons had not been found; but in answer to the patriarch\u2019s\nprayer, the one man who feared God was snatched from destruction.\nThe command was given with startling vehemence: \u201cEscape for thy\nlife; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape\nto the mountain, lest thou be consumed.\u201d Hesitancy or delay now\nwould be fatal. To cast one lingering look upon the devoted city,\nto tarry for one moment from regret to leave so beautiful a home,\nwould have cost their life. The storm of divine judgment was only[161]\nwaiting that these poor fugitives might make their escape.\nDestruction of Sodom 137\nBut Lot, confused and terrified, pleaded that he could not do as\nhe was required lest some evil should overtake him and he should\ndie. Living in that wicked city, in the midst of unbelief, his faith had\ngrown dim. The Prince of heaven was by his side, yet he pleaded for\nhis own life as though God, who had manifested such care and love\nfor him, would not still preserve him. He should have trusted himself\nwholly to the divine Messenger, giving his will and his life into the\nLord\u2019s hands without a doubt or a question. But like so many others,\nhe endeavored to plan for himself: \u201cBehold now, this city is near\nto flee unto, and it is a little one: O, let me escape thither, (is it not\na little one?) and my soul shall live.\u201d The city here mentioned was\nBela, afterward called Zoar. It was but a few miles from Sodom,\nand, like it, was corrupt and doomed to destruction. But Lot asked\nthat it might be spared, urging that this was but a small request; and\nhis desire was granted. The Lord assured him, \u201cI have accepted thee\nconcerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the\nwhich thou hast spoken.\u201d Oh, how great the mercy of God toward\nHis erring creatures!\nAgain the solemn command was given to hasten, for the fiery\nstorm would be delayed but little longer. But one of the fugitives\nventured to cast a look backward to the doomed city, and she became\na monument of God\u2019s judgment. If Lot himself had manifested no\nhesitancy to obey the angels\u2019 warning, but had earnestly fled toward\nthe mountains, without one word of pleading or remonstrance, his\nwife also would have made her escape. The influence of his example\nwould have saved her from the sin that sealed her doom. But his\nhesitancy and delay caused her to lightly regard the divine warning.\nWhile her body was upon the plain, her heart clung to Sodom, and\nshe perished with it. She rebelled against God because His judgments\ninvolved her possessions and her children in the ruin. Although so\ngreatly favored in being called out from the wicked city, she felt\nthat she was severely dealt with, because the wealth that it had taken\nyears to accumulate must be left to destruction. Instead of thankfully\naccepting deliverance, she presumptuously looked back to desire the\nlife of those who had rejected the divine warning. Her sin showed\nher to be unworthy of life, for the preservation of which she felt so [162]\nlittle gratitude.\n138 Patriarchs and Prophets\nWe should beware of treating lightly God\u2019s gracious provisions\nfor our salvation. There are Christians who say, \u201cI do not care to be\nsaved unless my companion and children are saved with me.\u201d They\nfeel that heaven would not be heaven to them without the presence\nof those who are so dear. But have those who cherish this feeling a\nright conception of their own relation to God, in view of His great\ngoodness and mercy toward them? Have they forgotten that they\nare bound by the strongest ties of love and honor and loyalty to the\nservice of their Creator and Redeemer? The invitations of mercy\nare addressed to all; and because our friends reject the Saviour\u2019s\npleading love, shall we also turn away? The redemption of the soul\nis precious. Christ has paid an infinite price for our salvation, and no\none who appreciates the value of this great sacrifice or the worth of\nthe soul will despise God\u2019s offered mercy because others choose to\ndo so. The very fact that others are ignoring His just claims should\narouse us to greater diligence, that we may honor God ourselves,\nand lead all whom we can influence, to accept His love.\n\u201cThe sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\u201d\nThe bright rays of the morning seemed to speak only prosperity and\npeace to the cities of the plain. The stir of active life began in the\nstreets; men were going their various ways, intent on the business or\nthe pleasures of the day. The sons-in-law of Lot were making merry\nat the fears and warnings of the weak-minded old man. Suddenly\nand unexpectedly as would be a thunder peal from an unclouded sky,\nthe tempest broke. The Lord rained brimstone and fire out of heaven\nupon the cities and the fruitful plain; its palaces and temples, costly\ndwellings, gardens and vineyards, and the gay, pleasure-seeking\nthrongs that only the night before had insulted the messengers of\nheaven\u2014all were consumed. The smoke of the conflagration went\nup like the smoke of a great furnace. And the fair vale of Siddim\nbecame a desolation, a place never to be built up or inhabited\u2014a\nwitness to all generations of the certainty of God\u2019s judgments upon\ntransgression.\nThe flames that consumed the cities of the plain shed their warn-\ning light down even to our time. We are taught the fearful and solemn\nlesson that while God\u2019s mercy bears long with the transgressor, there\nis a limit beyond which men may not go on in sin. When that limit is[163]\n[164]\n[165]\nDestruction of Sodom 139\nreached, then the offers of mercy are withdrawn, and the ministration\nof judgment begins.\nThe Redeemer of the world declares that there are greater sins\nthan that for which Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed. Those\nwho hear the gospel invitation calling sinners to repentance, and\nheed it not, are more guilty before God than were the dwellers in\nthe vale of Siddim. And still greater sin is theirs who profess to\nknow God and to keep His commandments, yet who deny Christ\nin their character and their daily life. In the light of the Saviour\u2019s\nwarning, the fate of Sodom is a solemn admonition, not merely to\nthose who are guilty of outbreaking sin, but to all who are trifling\nwith Heaven-sent light and privileges.\nSaid the True Witness to the church at Ephesus: \u201cI have some-\nwhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember\ntherefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first\nworks; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy\ncandlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\u201d Revelation 2:4, 5.\nThe Saviour watches for a response to His offers of love and forgive-\nness, with a more tender compassion than that which moves the heart\nof an earthly parent to forgive a wayward, suffering son. He cries\nafter the wanderer, \u201cReturn unto Me, and I will return unto you.\u201d\nMalachi 3:7. But if the erring one persistently refuses to heed the\nvoice that calls him with pitying, tender love, he will at last be left\nin darkness. The heart that has long slighted God\u2019s mercy, becomes\nhardened in sin, and is no longer susceptible to the influence of the\ngrace of God. Fearful will be the doom of that soul of whom the\npleading Saviour shall finally declare, he \u201cis joined to idols: let him\nalone.\u201d Hosea 4:17. It will be more tolerable in the day of judgment\nfor the cities of the plain than for those who have known the love of\nChrist, and yet have turned away to choose the pleasures of a world\nof sin.\nYou who are slighting the offers of mercy, think of the long\narray of figures accumulating against you in the books of heaven;\nfor there is a record kept of the impieties of nations, of families, of\nindividuals. God may bear long while the account goes on, and calls\nto repentance and offers of pardon may be given; yet a time will\ncome when the account will be full; when the soul\u2019s decision has\n140 Patriarchs and Prophets\nbeen made; when by his own choice man\u2019s destiny has been fixed.\nThen the signal will be given for judgment to be executed.\nThere is cause for alarm in the condition of the religious world[166]\ntoday. God\u2019s mercy has been trifled with. The multitudes make void\nthe law of Jehovah, \u201cteaching for doctrines the commandments of\nmen.\u201d Matthew 15:9. Infidelity prevails in many of the churches in\nour land; not infidelity in its broadest sense\u2014an open denial of the\nBible\u2014but an infidelity that is robed in the garb of Christianity, while\nit is undermining faith in the Bible as a revelation from God. Fervent\ndevotion and vital piety have given place to hollow formalism. As\nthe result, apostasy and sensualism prevail. Christ declared, \u201cAs\nit was in the days of Lot, ... even thus shall it be in the day when\nthe Son of man is revealed.\u201d Luke 17:28, 30. The daily record of\npassing events testifies to the fulfillment of His words. The world is\nfast becoming ripe for destruction. Soon the judgments of God are\nto be poured out, and sin and sinners are to be consumed.\nSaid our Saviour: \u201cTake heed to yourselves, lest at any time\nyour hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and\ncares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a\nsnare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole\nearth\u201d\u2014upon all whose interests are centered in this world. \u201cWatch\nye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to\nescape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before\nthe Son of man.\u201d Luke 21:34-36.\nBefore the destruction of Sodom, God sent a message to Lot,\n\u201cEscape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all\nthe plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.\u201d The same\nvoice of warning was heard by the disciples of Christ before the\ndestruction of Jerusalem: \u201cWhen ye shall see Jerusalem compassed\nwith armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then\nlet them which are in Judea flee to the mountains.\u201d Luke 21:20, 21.\nThey must not tarry to secure anything from their possessions, but\nmust make the most of the opportunity to escape.\nThere was a coming out, a decided separation from the wicked,\nan escape for life. So it was in the days of Noah; so with Lot; so\nwith the disciples prior to the destruction of Jerusalem; and so it will\nbe in the last days. Again the voice of God is heard in a message of\nDestruction of Sodom 141\nwarning, bidding His people separate themselves from the prevailing\niniquity.\nThe state of corruption and apostasy that in the last days would [167]\nexist in the religious world, was presented to the prophet John in\nthe vision of Babylon, \u201cthat great city, which reigneth over the\nkings of the earth.\u201d Revelation 17:18. Before its destruction the\ncall is to be given from heaven, \u201cCome out of her, My people,\nthat ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her\nplagues.\u201d Revelation 18:4. As in the days of Noah and Lot, there\nmust be a marked separation from sin and sinners. There can be no\ncompromise between God and the world, no turning back to secure\nearthly treasures. \u201cYe cannot serve God and mammon.\u201d Matthew\n6:24.\nLike the dwellers in the vale of Siddim, the people are dreaming\nof prosperity and peace. \u201cEscape for thy life,\u201d is the warning from\nthe angels of God; but other voices are heard saying, \u201cBe not excited;\nthere is no cause for alarm.\u201d The multitudes cry, \u201cPeace and safety,\u201d\nwhile Heaven declares that swift destruction is about to come upon\nthe transgressor. On the night prior to their destruction, the cities\nof the plain rioted in pleasure and derided the fears and warnings\nof the messenger of God; but those scoffers perished in the flames;\nthat very night the door of mercy was forever closed to the wicked,\ncareless inhabitants of Sodom. God will not always be mocked; He\nwill not long be trifled with. \u201cBehold, the day of the Lord cometh,\ncruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and\nHe shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.\u201d Isaiah 13:9. The great\nmass of the world will reject God\u2019s mercy, and will be overwhelmed\nin swift and irretrievable ruin. But those who heed the warning shall\ndwell \u201cin the secret place of the Most High,\u201d and \u201cabide under the\nshadow of the Almighty.\u201d His truth shall be their shield and buckler.\nFor them is the promise, \u201cWith long life will I satisfy him, and show\nhim My salvation.\u201d Psalm 91:1, 4, 16.\nLot dwelt but a short time in Zoar. Iniquity prevailed there as in\nSodom, and he feared to remain, lest the city should be destroyed.\nNot long after, Zoar was consumed, as God had purposed. Lot\nmade his way to the mountains, and abode in a cave, stripped of all\nfor which he had dared to subject his family to the influences of a\nwicked city. But the curse of Sodom followed him even here. The\n142 Patriarchs and Prophets\nsinful conduct of his daughters was the result of the evil associations\nof that vile place. Its moral corruption had become so interwoven[168]\nwith their character that they could not distinguish between good\nand evil. Lot\u2019s only posterity, the Moabites and Ammonites, were\nvile, idolatrous tribes, rebels against God and bitter enemies of His\npeople.\nIn how wide contrast to the life of Abraham was that of Lot!\nOnce they had been companions, worshiping at one altar, dwelling\nside by side in their pilgrim tents; but how widely separated now! Lot\nhad chosen Sodom for its pleasure and profit. Leaving Abraham\u2019s\naltar and its daily sacrifice to the living God, he had permitted his\nchildren to mingle with a corrupt and idolatrous people; yet he\nhad retained in his heart the fear of God, for he is declared in the\nScriptures to have been a \u201cjust\u201d man; his righteous soul was vexed\nwith the vile conversation that greeted his ears daily and the violence\nand crime he was powerless to prevent. He was saved at last as \u201ca\nbrand plucked out of the fire\u201d (Zechariah 3:2), yet stripped of his\npossessions, bereaved of his wife and children, dwelling in caves,\nlike the wild beasts, covered with infamy in his old age; and he gave\nto the world, not a race of righteous men, but two idolatrous nations,\nat enmity with God and warring upon His people, until, their cup of\niniquity being full, they were appointed to destruction. How terrible\nwere the results that followed one unwise step!\nSays the wise man, \u201cLabor not to be rich: cease from thine\nown wisdom.\u201d \u201cHe that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house;\nbut he that hateth gifts shall live.\u201d Proverbs 23:4; 15:27. And the\napostle Paul declares, \u201cThey that will be rich fall into temptation\nand a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown\nmen in destruction and perdition.\u201d 1 Timothy 6:9.\nWhen Lot entered Sodom he fully intended to keep himself free\nfrom iniquity and to command his household after him. But he\nsignally failed. The corrupting influences about him had an effect\nupon his own faith, and his children\u2019s connection with the inhabitants\nof Sodom bound up his interest in a measure with theirs. The result\nis before us.\nMany are still making a similar mistake. In selecting a home\nthey look more to the temporal advantages they may gain than to the\nmoral and social influences that will surround themselves and their\nDestruction of Sodom 143\nfamilies. They choose a beautiful and fertile country, or remove to\nsome flourishing city, in the hope of securing greater prosperity; but [169]\ntheir children are surrounded by temptation, and too often they form\nassociations that are unfavorable to the development of piety and\nthe formation of a right character. The atmosphere of lax morality,\nof unbelief, of indifference to religious things, has a tendency to\ncounteract the influence of the parents. Examples of rebellion against\nparental and divine authority are ever before the youth; many form\nattachments for infidels and unbelievers, and cast in their lot with\nthe enemies of God.\nIn choosing a home, God would have us consider, first of all,\nthe moral and religious influences that will surround us and our\nfamilies. We may be placed in trying positions, for many cannot\nhave their surroundings what they would; and whenever duty calls\nus, God will enable us to stand uncorrupted, if we watch and pray,\ntrusting in the grace of Christ. But we should not needlessly expose\nourselves to influences that are unfavorable to the formation of\nChristian character. When we voluntarily place ourselves in an\natmosphere of worldliness and unbelief, we displease God and drive\nholy angels from our homes.\nThose who secure for their children worldly wealth and honor at\nthe expense of their eternal interests, will find in the end that these\nadvantages are a terrible loss. Like Lot, many see their children\nruined, and barely save their own souls. Their lifework is lost; their\nlife is a sad failure. Had they exercised true wisdom, their children\nmight have had less of worldly prosperity, but they would have made\nsure of a title to the immortal inheritance.\nThe heritage that God has promised to His people is not in this\nworld. Abraham had no possession in the earth, \u201cno, not so much\nas to set his foot on.\u201d Acts 7:5. He possessed great substance, and\nhe used it to the glory of God and the good of his fellow men; but\nhe did not look upon this world as his home. The Lord had called\nhim to leave his idolatrous countrymen, with the promise of the land\nof Canaan as an everlasting possession; yet neither he nor his son\nnor his son\u2019s son received it. When Abraham desired a burial place\nfor his dead, he had to buy it of the Canaanites. His sole possession\nin the Land of Promise was that rock-hewn tomb in the cave of\nMachpelah.\n144 Patriarchs and Prophets\nBut the word of God had not failed; neither did it meet its final\naccomplishment in the occupation of Canaan by the Jewish people.\n\u201cTo Abraham and his seed were the promises made.\u201d Galatians 3:16.[170]\nAbraham himself was to share the inheritance. The fulfillment of\nGod\u2019s promise may seem to be long delayed\u2014for \u201cone day is with\nthe Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day\u201d (2\nPeter 3:8); it may appear to tarry; but at the appointed time \u201cit will\nsurely come, it will not tarry.\u201d Habakkuk 2:3. The gift to Abraham\nand his seed included not merely the land of Canaan, but the whole\nearth. So says the apostle, \u201cThe promise, that he should be the heir\nof the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law,\nbut through the righteousness of faith.\u201d Romans 4:13. And the Bible\nplainly teaches that the promises made to Abraham are to be fulfilled\nthrough Christ. All that are Christ\u2019s are \u201cAbraham\u2019s seed, and heirs\naccording to the promise\u201d\u2014heirs to \u201can inheritance incorruptible,\nand undefiled, and that fadeth not away\u201d\u2014the earth freed from the\ncurse of sin. Galatians 3:29; 1 Peter 1:4. For \u201cthe kingdom and\ndominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven,\nshall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High;\u201d and\n\u201cthe meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the\nabundance of peace.\u201d Daniel 7:27; Psalm 37:11.\nGod gave to Abraham a view of this immortal inheritance, and\nwith this hope he was content. \u201cBy faith he sojourned in the Land of\nPromise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac\nand Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: for he looked\nfor a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.\u201d\nHebrews 11:9, 10.\nOf the posterity of Abraham it is written, \u201cThese all died in faith,\nnot having received the promises, but having seen them afar off,\nand were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed\nthat they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.\u201d Verse 13. We\nmust dwell as pilgrims and strangers here if we would gain \u201ca better\ncountry, that is, an heavenly.\u201d Verse 16. Those who are children\nof Abraham will be seeking the city which he looked for, \u201cwhose\nbuilder and maker is God.\u201d\nChapter 15\u2014The Marriage of Isaac [171]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 24.\nAbraham had become an old man, and expected soon to die;\nyet one act remained for him to do in securing the fulfillment of\nthe promise to his posterity. Isaac was the one divinely appointed\nto succeed him as the keeper of the law of God and the father of\nthe chosen people, but he was yet unmarried. The inhabitants of\nCanaan were given to idolatry, and God had forbidden intermarriage\nbetween His people and them, knowing that such marriages would\nlead to apostasy. The patriarch feared the effect of the corrupting\ninfluences surrounding his son. Abraham\u2019s habitual faith in God\nand submission to His will were reflected in the character of Isaac;\nbut the young man\u2019s affections were strong, and he was gentle and\nyielding in disposition. If united with one who did not fear God, he\nwould be in danger of sacrificing principle for the sake of harmony.\nIn the mind of Abraham the choice of a wife for his son was a matter\nof grave importance; he was anxious to have him marry one who\nwould not lead him from God.\nIn ancient times marriage engagements were generally made by\nthe parents, and this was the custom among those who worshiped\nGod. None were required to marry those whom they could not\nlove; but in the bestowal of their affections the youth were guided\nby the judgment of their experienced, God-fearing parents. It was\nregarded as a dishonor to parents, and even a crime, to pursue a\ncourse contrary to this.\nIsaac, trusting to his father\u2019s wisdom and affection, was satisfied\nto commit the matter to him, believing also that God Himself would\ndirect in the choice made. The patriarch\u2019s thoughts turned to his\nfather\u2019s kindred in the land of Mesopotamia. Though not free from\nidolatry, they cherished the knowledge and the worship of the true\nGod. Isaac must not leave Canaan to go to them, but it might be\nthat among them could be found one who would leave her home and\n145\n146 Patriarchs and Prophets\nunite with him in maintaining the pure worship of the living God.[172]\nAbraham committed the important matter to \u201chis eldest servant,\u201d a\nman of piety, experience, and sound judgment, who had rendered\nhim long and faithful service. He required this servant to make a\nsolemn oath before the Lord, that he would not take a wife for Isaac\nof the Canaanites, but would choose a maiden from the family of\nNahor in Mesopotamia. He charged him not to take Isaac thither. If\na damsel could not be found who would leave her kindred, then the\nmessenger would be released from his oath. The patriarch encour-\naged him in his difficult and delicate undertaking with the assurance\nthat God would crown his mission with success. \u201cThe Lord God of\nheaven,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich took me from my father\u2019s house, and from\nthe land of my kindred, ... He shall send His angel before thee.\u201d\nThe messenger set out without delay. Taking with him ten camels\nfor the use of his own company and the bridal party that might return\nwith him, provided also with gifts for the intended wife and her\nfriends, he made the long journey beyond Damascus, and onward\nto the rich plains that border on the great river of the East. Arrived\nat Haran, \u201cthe city of Nahor,\u201d he halted outside the walls, near the\nwell to which the women of the place came at evening for water. It\nwas a time of anxious thought with him. Important results, not only\nto his master\u2019s household, but to future generations, might follow\nfrom the choice he made; and how was he to choose wisely among\nentire strangers? Remembering the words of Abraham, that God\nwould send His angel with him, he prayed earnestly for positive\nguidance. In the family of his master he was accustomed to the\nconstant exercise of kindness and hospitality, and he now asked that\nan act of courtesy might indicate the maiden whom God had chosen.\nHardly was the prayer uttered before the answer was given.\nAmong the women who were gathered at the well, the courteous\nmanners of one attracted his attention. As she came from the well,\nthe stranger went to meet her, asking for some water from the pitcher\nupon her shoulder. The request received a kindly answer, with an\noffer to draw water for the camels also, a service which it was\ncustomary even for the daughters of princes to perform for their\nfathers\u2019 flocks and herds. Thus the desired sign was given. The\nmaiden \u201cwas very fair to look upon,\u201d and her ready courtesy gave\nevidence of a kind heart and an active, energetic nature. Thus far the[173]\nMarriage of Isaac 147\ndivine hand had been with him. After acknowledging her kindness\nby rich gifts, the messengers asked her parentage, and on learning\nthat she was the daughter of Bethuel, Abraham\u2019s nephew, he \u201cbowed\ndown his head, and worshiped the Lord.\u201d\nThe man had asked for entertainment at her father\u2019s house, and\nin his expressions of thanksgiving had revealed the fact of his con-\nnection with Abraham. Returning home, the maiden told what had\nhappened, and Laban, her brother, at once hastened to bring the\nstranger and his attendants to share their hospitality.\nEliezer would not partake of food until he had told his errand,\nhis prayer at the well, with all the circumstances attending it. Then\nhe said, \u201cAnd now, if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master,\ntell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to\nthe left.\u201d The answer was, \u201cThe thing proceedeth from the Lord: we\ncannot speak unto thee bad or good. Behold, Rebekah is before thee;\ntake her, and go, and let her be thy master\u2019s son\u2019s wife, as the Lord\nhath spoken.\u201d\nAfter the consent of the family had been obtained, Rebekah\nherself was consulted as to whether she would go to so great a\ndistance from her father\u2019s house, to marry the son of Abraham. She\nbelieved, from what had taken place, that God had selected her to be\nIsaac\u2019s wife, and she said, \u201cI will go.\u201d\nThe servant, anticipating his master\u2019s joy at the success of his\nmission, was impatient to be gone; and with the morning they set out\non the homeward journey. Abraham dwelt at Beersheba, and Isaac,\nwho had been attending to the flocks in the adjoining country, had\nreturned to his father\u2019s tent to await the arrival of the messenger from\nHaran. \u201cAnd Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide:\nand he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were\ncoming. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac,\nshe lighted off the camel. For she had said unto the servant, What\nman is that that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had\nsaid, It is my master: therefore she took a veil, and covered herself.\nAnd the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. And Isaac\nbrought her into his mother Sarah\u2019s tent, and took Rebekah, and she\nbecame his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after\nhis mother\u2019s death.\u201d\n148 Patriarchs and Prophets\nAbraham had marked the result of the intermarriage of those who\nfeared God and those who feared Him not, from the days of Cain to[174]\nhis own time. The consequences of his own marriage with Hagar,\nand of the marriage connections of Ishmael and Lot, were before\nhim. The lack of faith on the part of Abraham and Sarah had resulted\nin the birth of Ishmael, the mingling of the righteous seed with the\nungodly. The father\u2019s influence upon his son was counteracted by\nthat of the mother\u2019s idolatrous kindred and by Ishmael\u2019s connection\nwith heathen wives. The jealousy of Hagar, and of the wives whom\nshe chose for Ishmael, surrounded his family with a barrier that\nAbraham endeavored in vain to overcome.\nAbraham\u2019s early teachings had not been without effect upon\nIshmael, but the influence of his wives resulted in establishing idola-\ntry in his family. Separated from his father, and embittered by the\nstrife and contention of a home destitute of the love and fear of God,\nIshmael was driven to choose the wild, marauding life of the desert\nchief, \u201chis hand\u201d \u201cagainst every man, and every man\u2019s hand against\nhim.\u201d Genesis 16:12. In his latter days he repented of his evil ways\nand returned to his father\u2019s God, but the stamp of character given to\nhis posterity remained. The powerful nation descended from him\nwere a turbulent, heathen people, who were ever an annoyance and\naffliction to the descendants of Isaac.\nThe wife of Lot was a selfish, irreligious woman, and her influ-\nence was exerted to separate her husband from Abraham. But for\nher, Lot would not have remained in Sodom, deprived of the counsel\nof the wise, God-fearing patriarch. The influence of his wife and the\nassociations of that wicked city would have led him to apostatize\nfrom God had it not been for the faithful instruction he had early\nreceived from Abraham. The marriage of Lot and his choice of\nSodom for a home were the first links in a chain of events fraught\nwith evil to the world for many generations.\nNo one who fears God can without danger connect himself with\none who fears Him not. \u201cCan two walk together, except they be\nagreed?\u201d Amos 3:3. The happiness and prosperity of the marriage\nrelation depends upon the unity of the parties; but between the\nbeliever and the unbeliever there is a radical difference of tastes,\ninclinations, and purposes. They are serving two masters, between\nwhom there can be no concord. However pure and correct one\u2019s\nMarriage of Isaac 149\nprinciples may be, the influence of an unbelieving companion will\nhave a tendency to lead away from God.\nHe who has entered the marriage relation while unconverted, is [175]\nby his conversion placed under stronger obligation to be faithful to\nhis companion, however widely they may differ in regard to religious\nfaith; yet the claims of God should be placed above every earthly\nrelationship, even though trials and persecution may be the result.\nWith the spirit of love and meekness, this fidelity may have an\ninfluence to win the unbelieving one. But the marriage of Christians\nwith the ungodly is forbidden in the Bible. The Lord\u2019s direction is,\n\u201cBe ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.\u201d 2 Corinthians\n6:14, 17, 18.\nIsaac was highly honored by God in being made inheritor of\nthe promises through which the world was to be blessed; yet when\nhe was forty years of age he submitted to his father\u2019s judgment in\nappointing his experienced, God-fearing servant to choose a wife\nfor him. And the result of that marriage, as presented in the Scrip-\ntures, is a tender and beautiful picture of domestic happiness: \u201cIsaac\nbrought her into his mother Sarah\u2019s tent, and took Rebekah, and she\nbecame his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after\nhis mother\u2019s death.\u201d\nWhat a contrast between the course of Isaac and that pursued\nby the youth of our time, even among professed Christians! Young\npeople too often feel that the bestowal of their affections is a matter\nin which self alone should be consulted\u2014a matter that neither God\nnor their parents should in any wise control. Long before they have\nreached manhood or womanhood they think themselves competent\nto make their own choice, without the aid of their parents. A few\nyears of married life are usually sufficient to show them their error,\nbut often too late to prevent its baleful results. For the same lack of\nwisdom and self-control that dictated the hasty choice is permitted\nto aggravate the evil, until the marriage relation becomes a galling\nyoke. Many have thus wrecked their happiness in this life and their\nhope of the life to come.\nIf there is any subject which should be carefully considered and\nin which the counsel of older and more experienced persons should\nbe sought, it is the subject of marriage; if ever the Bible was needed\n150 Patriarchs and Prophets\nas a counselor, if ever divine guidance should be sought in prayer, it\nis before taking a step that binds persons together for life.\nParents should never lose sight of their own responsibility for the\nfuture happiness of their children. Isaac\u2019s deference to his father\u2019s[176]\njudgment was the result of the training that had taught him to love a\nlife of obedience. While Abraham required his children to respect\nparental authority, his daily life testified that that authority was not a\nselfish or arbitrary control, but was founded in love, and had their\nwelfare and happiness in view.\nFathers and mothers should feel that a duty devolves upon them\nto guide the affections of the youth, that they may be placed upon\nthose who will be suitable companions. They should feel it a duty,\nby their own teaching and example, with the assisting grace of God,\nto so mold the character of the children from their earliest years that\nthey will be pure and noble and will be attracted to the good and true.\nLike attracts like; like appreciates like. Let the love for truth and\npurity and goodness be early implanted in the soul, and the youth\nwill seek the society of those who possess these characteristics.\nLet parents seek, in their own character and in their home life,\nto exemplify the love and beneficence of the heavenly Father. Let\nthe home be full of sunshine. This will be worth far more to your\nchildren than lands or money. Let the home love be kept alive in their\nhearts, that they may look back upon the home of their childhood as\na place of peace and happiness next to heaven. The members of the\nfamily do not all have the same stamp of character, and there will\nbe frequent occasion for the exercise of patience and forbearance;\nbut through love and self-discipline all may be bound together in the\nclosest union.\nTrue love is a high and holy principle, altogether different in\ncharacter from that love which is awakened by impulse and which\nsuddenly dies when severely tested. It is by faithfulness to duty\nin the parental home that the youth are to prepare themselves for\nhomes of their own. Let them here practice self-denial and manifest\nkindness, courtesy, and Christian sympathy. Thus love will be kept\nwarm in the heart, and he who goes out from such a household to\nstand at the head of a family of his own will know how to promote\nthe happiness of her whom he has chosen as a companion for life.\nMarriage, instead of being the end of love, will be only its beginning.\nChapter 16\u2014Jacob and Esau [177]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 25:19-24; 27.\nJacob and Esau, the twin sons of Isaac, present a striking contrast,\nboth in character and in life. This unlikeness was foretold by the\nangel of God before their birth. When in answer to Rebekah\u2019s\ntroubled prayer he declared that two sons would be given her, he\nopened to her their future history, that each would become the head\nof a mighty nation, but that one would be greater than the other, and\nthat the younger would have the pre-eminence.\nEsau grew up loving self-gratification and centering all his in-\nterest in the present. Impatient of restraint, he delighted in the wild\nfreedom of the chase, and early chose the life of a hunter. Yet he was\nthe father\u2019s favorite. The quiet, peace-loving shepherd was attracted\nby the daring and vigor of this elder son, who fearlessly ranged over\nmountain and desert, returning home with game for his father and\nwith exciting accounts of his adventurous life. Jacob, thoughtful,\ndiligent, and care-taking, ever thinking more of the future than the\npresent, was content to dwell at home, occupied in the care of the\nflocks and the tillage of the soil. His patient perseverance, thrift, and\nforesight were valued by the mother. His affections were deep and\nstrong, and his gentle, unremitting attentions added far more to her\nhappiness than did the boisterous and occasional kindnesses of Esau.\nTo Rebekah, Jacob was the dearer son.\nThe promises made to Abraham and confirmed to his son were\nheld by Isaac and Rebekah as the great object of their desires and\nhopes. With these promises Esau and Jacob were familiar. They\nwere taught to regard the birthright as a matter of great importance,\nfor it included not only an inheritance of worldly wealth but spiritual\npre-eminence. He who received it was to be the priest of his family,\nand in the line of his posterity the Redeemer of the world would\ncome. On the other hand, there were obligations resting upon the\npossessor of the birthright. He who should inherit its blessings [178]\n151\n152 Patriarchs and Prophets\nmust devote his life to the service of God. Like Abraham, he must\nbe obedient to the divine requirements. In marriage, in his family\nrelations, in public life, he must consult the will of God.\nIsaac made known to his sons these privileges and conditions,\nand plainly stated that Esau, as the eldest, was the one entitled to\nthe birthright. But Esau had no love for devotion, no inclination to\na religious life. The requirements that accompanied the spiritual\nbirthright were an unwelcome and even hateful restraint to him.\nThe law of God, which was the condition of the divine covenant\nwith Abraham, was regarded by Esau as a yoke of bondage. Bent\non self-indulgence, he desired nothing so much as liberty to do as\nhe pleased. To him power and riches, feasting and reveling, were\nhappiness. He gloried in the unrestrained freedom of his wild, roving\nlife. Rebekah remembered the words of the angel, and she read with\nclearer insight than did her husband the character of their sons. She\nwas convinced that the heritage of divine promise was intended for\nJacob. She repeated to Isaac the angel\u2019s words; but the father\u2019s\naffections were centered upon the elder son, and he was unshaken in\nhis purpose.\nJacob had learned from his mother of the divine intimation that\nthe birthright should fall to him, and he was filled with an unspeak-\nable desire for the privileges which it would confer. It was not\nthe possession of his father\u2019s wealth that he craved; the spiritual\nbirthright was the object of his longing. To commune with God as\ndid righteous Abraham, to offer the sacrifice of atonement for his\nfamily, to be the progenitor of the chosen people and of the promised\nMessiah, and to inherit the immortal possessions embraced in the\nblessings of the covenant\u2014here were the privileges and honors that\nkindled his most ardent desires. His mind was ever reaching forward\nto the future, and seeking to grasp its unseen blessings.\nWith secret longing he listened to all that his father told con-\ncerning the spiritual birthright; he carefully treasured what he had\nlearned from his mother. Day and night the subject occupied his\nthoughts, until it became the absorbing interest of his life. But while\nhe thus esteemed eternal above temporal blessings, Jacob had not\nan experimental knowledge of the God whom he revered. His heart\nhad not been renewed by divine grace. He believed that the promise\nconcerning himself could not be fulfilled so long as Esau retained[179]\nJacob and Esau 153\nthe rights of the first-born, and he constantly studied to devise some\nway whereby he might secure the blessing which his brother held so\nlightly, but which was so precious to himself.\nWhen Esau, coming home one day faint and weary from the\nchase, asked for the food that Jacob was preparing, the latter, with\nwhom one thought was ever uppermost, seized upon his advan-\ntage, and offered to satisfy his brother\u2019s hunger at the price of the\nbirthright. \u201cBehold, I am at the point to die,\u201d cried the reckless,\nself-indulgent hunter, \u201cand what profit shall this birthright do to\nme?\u201d And for a dish of red pottage he parted with his birthright, and\nconfirmed the transaction by an oath. A short time at most would\nhave secured him food in his father\u2019s tents, but to satisfy the desire\nof the moment he carelessly bartered the glorious heritage that God\nHimself had promised to his fathers. His whole interest was in the\npresent. He was ready to sacrifice the heavenly to the earthly, to\nexchange a future good for a momentary indulgence.\n\u201cThus Esau despised his birthright.\u201d In disposing of it he felt a\nsense of relief. Now his way was unobstructed; he could do as he\nliked. For this wild pleasure, miscalled freedom, how many are still\nselling their birthright to an inheritance pure and undefiled, eternal\nin the heavens!\nEver subject to mere outward and earthly attractions, Esau took\ntwo wives of the daughters of Heth. They were worshipers of false\ngods, and their idolatry was a bitter grief to Isaac and Rebekah. Esau\nhad violated one of the conditions of the covenant, which forbade\nintermarriage between the chosen people and the heathen; yet Isaac\nwas still unshaken in his determination to bestow upon him the\nbirthright. The reasoning of Rebekah, Jacob\u2019s strong desire for the\nblessing, and Esau\u2019s indifference to its obligations had no effect to\nchange the father\u2019s purpose.\nYears passed on, until Isaac, old and blind, and expecting soon to\ndie, determined no longer to delay the bestowal of the blessing upon\nhis elder son. But knowing the opposition of Rebekah and Jacob, he\ndecided to perform the solemn ceremony in secret. In accordance\nwith the custom of making a feast upon such occasions, the patriarch\nbade Esau, \u201cGo out to the field, and take me some venison; and\nmake me savory meat, ... that my soul may bless thee before I die.\u201d\nRebekah divined his purpose. She was confident that it was [180]\n154 Patriarchs and Prophets\ncontrary to what God had revealed as His will. Isaac was in danger\nof incurring the divine displeasure and of debarring his younger son\nfrom the position to which God had called him. She had in vain tried\nthe effect of reasoning with Isaac, and she determined to resort to\nstratagem.\nNo sooner had Esau departed on his errand than Rebekah set\nabout the accomplishment of her purpose. She told Jacob what had\ntaken place, urging the necessity of immediate action to prevent the\nbestowal of the blessing, finally and irrevocably, upon Esau. And\nshe assured her son that if he would follow her directions, he might\nobtain it as God had promised. Jacob did not readily consent to the\nplan that she proposed. The thought of deceiving his father caused\nhim great distress. He felt that such a sin would bring a curse rather\nthan a blessing. But his scruples were overborne, and he proceeded\nto carry out his mother\u2019s suggestions. It was not his intention to utter\na direct falsehood, but once in the presence of his father he seemed\nto have gone too far to retreat, and he obtained by fraud the coveted\nblessing.\nJacob and Rebekah succeeded in their purpose, but they gained\nonly trouble and sorrow by their deception. God had declared that\nJacob should receive the birthright, and His word would have been\nfulfilled in His own time had they waited in faith for Him to work\nfor them. But like many who now profess to be children of God,\nthey were unwilling to leave the matter in His hands. Rebekah\nbitterly repented the wrong counsel she had given her son; it was the\nmeans of separating him from her, and she never saw his face again.\nFrom the hour when he received the birthright, Jacob was weighed\ndown with self-condemnation. He had sinned against his father, his\nbrother, his own soul, and against God. In one short hour he had\nmade work for a lifelong repentance. This scene was vivid before\nhim in afteryears, when the wicked course of his sons oppressed his\nsoul.\nNo sooner had Jacob left his father\u2019s tent than Esau entered.\nThough he had sold his birthright, and confirmed the transfer by\na solemn oath, he was now determined to secure its blessings, re-\ngardless of his brother\u2019s claim. With the spiritual was connected\nthe temporal birthright, which would give him the headship of the\nfamily and possession of a double portion of his father\u2019s wealth.[181]\nJacob and Esau 155\nThese were blessings that he could value. \u201cLet my father arise,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cand eat of his son\u2019s venison, that thy soul may bless me.\u201d\nTrembling with astonishment and distress, the blind old father\nlearned the deception that had been practiced upon him. His long\nand fondly cherished hopes had been thwarted, and he keenly felt\nthe disappointment that must come upon his elder son. Yet the\nconviction flashed upon him that it was God\u2019s providence which\nhad defeated his purpose and brought about the very thing he had\ndetermined to prevent. He remembered the words of the angel to\nRebekah, and notwithstanding the sin of which Jacob was now guilty,\nhe saw in him the one best fitted to accomplish the purposes of God.\nWhile the words of blessing were upon his lips, he had felt the Spirit\nof inspiration upon him; and now, knowing all the circumstances, he\nratified the benediction unwittingly pronounced upon Jacob: \u201cI have\nblessed him; yea, and he shall be blessed.\u201d\nEsau had lightly valued the blessing while it seemed within his\nreach, but he desired to possess it now that it was gone from him\nforever. All the strength of his impulsive, passionate nature was\naroused, and his grief and rage were terrible. He cried with an\nexceeding bitter cry, \u201cBless me, even me also, O my father!\u201d \u201cHast\nthou not reserved a blessing for me?\u201d But the promise given was not\nto be recalled. The birthright which he had so carelessly bartered he\ncould not now regain. \u201cFor one morsel of meat,\u201d for a momentary\ngratification of appetite that had never been restrained, Esau sold\nhis inheritance; but when he saw his folly, it was too late to recover\nthe blessing. \u201cHe found no place of repentance, though he sought it\ncarefully with tears.\u201d Hebrews 12:16, 17. Esau was not shut out from\nthe privilege of seeking God\u2019s favor by repentance, but he could\nfind no means of recovering the birthright. His grief did not spring\nfrom conviction of sin; he did not desire to be reconciled to God. He\nsorrowed because of the results of his sin, but not for the sin itself.\nBecause of his indifference to the divine blessings and require-\nments, Esau is called in Scripture \u201ca profane person.\u201d Verse 16. He\nrepresents those who lightly value the redemption purchased for\nthem by Christ, and are ready to sacrifice their heirship to heaven\nfor the perishable things of earth. Multitudes live for the present,\nwith no thought or care for the future. Like Esau they cry, \u201cLet us [182]\neat and drink; for tomorrow we die.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:32. They\n156 Patriarchs and Prophets\nare controlled by inclination; and rather than practice self-denial,\nthey will forgo the most valuable considerations. If one must be\nrelinquished, the gratification of a depraved appetite or the heavenly\nblessings promised only to the self-denying and God-fearing, the\nclaims of appetite prevail, and God and heaven are virtually despised.\nHow many, even of professed Christians, cling to indulgences that\nare injurious to health and that benumb the sensibilities of the soul.\nWhen the duty is presented of cleansing themselves from all filthi-\nness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God,\nthey are offended. They see that they cannot retain these hurtful\ngratifications and yet secure heaven, and they conclude that since\nthe way to eternal life is so strait, they will no longer walk therein.\nMultitudes are selling their birthright for sensual indulgence.\nHealth is sacrificed, the mental faculties are enfeebled, and heaven\nis forfeited; and all for a mere temporary pleasure\u2014an indulgence at\nonce both weakening and debasing in its character. As Esau awoke\nto see the folly of his rash exchange when it was too late to recover\nhis loss, so it will be in the day of God with those who have bartered\ntheir heirship to heaven for selfish gratifications.\nChapter 17\u2014Jacob\u2019s Flight and Exile [183]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 28 to 31.\nThreatened with death by the wrath of Esau, Jacob went out from\nhis father\u2019s home a fugitive; but he carried with him the father\u2019s\nblessing; Isaac had renewed to him the covenant promise, and had\nbidden him, as its inheritor, to seek a wife of his mother\u2019s family in\nMesopotamia. Yet it was with a deeply troubled heart that Jacob set\nout on his lonely journey. With only his staff in his hand he must\ntravel hundreds of miles through a country inhabited by wild, roving\ntribes. In his remorse and timidity he sought to avoid men, lest he\nshould be traced by his angry brother. He feared that he had lost\nforever the blessing that God had purposed to give him; and Satan\nwas at hand to press temptations upon him.\nThe evening of the second day found him far away from his\nfather\u2019s tents. He felt that he was an outcast, and he knew that all\nthis trouble had been brought upon him by his own wrong course.\nThe darkness of despair pressed upon his soul, and he hardly dared to\npray. But he was so utterly lonely that he felt the need of protection\nfrom God as he had never felt it before. With weeping and deep\nhumiliation he confessed his sin, and entreated for some evidence\nthat he was not utterly forsaken. Still his burdened heart found no\nrelief. He had lost all confidence in himself, and he feared that the\nGod of his fathers had cast him off.\nBut God did not forsake Jacob. His mercy was still extended to\nHis erring, distrustful servant. The Lord compassionately revealed\njust what Jacob needed\u2014a Saviour. He had sinned, but his heart was\nfilled with gratitude as he saw revealed a way by which he could be\nrestored to the favor of God.\nWearied with his journey, the wanderer lay down upon the\nground, with a stone for his pillow. As he slept he beheld a ladder,\nbright and shining, whose base rested upon the earth, while the top\nreached to heaven. Upon this ladder angels were ascending and de-\n157\n158 Patriarchs and Prophets\nscending; above it was the Lord of glory, and from the heavens His[184]\nvoice was heard: \u201cI am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the\nGod of Isaac.\u201d The land whereon he lay as an exile and fugitive was\npromised to him and to his posterity, with the assurance, \u201cIn thee\nand in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\u201d This\npromise had been given to Abraham and to Isaac, and now it was\nrenewed to Jacob. Then in special regard to his present loneliness\nand distress, the words of comfort and encouragement were spoken:\n\u201cBehold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither\nthou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not\nleave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.\u201d\nThe Lord knew the evil influences that would surround Jacob,\nand the perils to which he would be exposed. In mercy He opened\nup the future before the repentant fugitive, that he might understand\nthe divine purpose with reference to himself, and be prepared to\nresist the temptations that would surely come to him when alone\namid idolaters and scheming men. There would be ever before him\nthe high standard at which he must aim; and the knowledge that\nthrough him the purpose of God was reaching its accomplishment,\nwould constantly prompt him to faithfulness.\nIn the vision the plan of redemption was presented to Jacob,\nnot fully, but in such parts as were essential to him at that time.\nThe mystic ladder revealed to him in his dream was the same to\nwhich Christ referred in His conversation with Nathanael. Said He,\n\u201cYe shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and\ndescending upon the Son of man.\u201d John 1:51. Up to the time of\nman\u2019s rebellion against the government of God, there had been free\ncommunion between God and man. But the sin of Adam and Eve\nseparated earth from heaven, so that man could not have communion\nwith his Maker. Yet the world was not left in solitary hopelessness.\nThe ladder represents Jesus, the appointed medium of communica-\ntion. Had He not with His own merits bridged the gulf that sin had\nmade, the ministering angels could have held no communion with\nfallen man. Christ connects man in his weakness and helplessness\nwith the source of infinite power.\nAll this was revealed to Jacob in his dream. Although his mind at\nonce grasped a part of the revelation, its great and mysterious truths\nJacob\u2019s Flight and Exile 159\nwere the study of his lifetime, and unfolded to his understanding\nmore and more.\nJacob awoke from his sleep in the deep stillness of night. The [185]\n[186]\n[187]\nshining forms of his vision had disappeared. Only the dim outline\nof the lonely hills, and above them the heavens bright with stars,\nnow met his gaze. But he had a solemn sense that God was with\nhim. An unseen presence filled the solitude. \u201cSurely the Lord is in\nthis place,\u201d he said, \u201cand I knew it not.... This is none other but the\nhouse of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that\nhe had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil\nupon the top of it.\u201d In accordance with the custom of commemorating\nimportant events, Jacob set up a memorial of God\u2019s mercy, that\nwhenever he should pass that way he might tarry at this sacred spot\nto worship the Lord. And he called the place Bethel, or the \u201chouse\nof God.\u201d With deep gratitude he repeated the promise that God\u2019s\npresence would be with him; and then he made the solemn vow, \u201cIf\nGod will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will\ngive me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to\nmy father\u2019s house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: and this\nstone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God\u2019s house: and of all\nthat Thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto Thee.\u201d\nJacob was not here seeking to make terms with God. The Lord\nhad already promised him prosperity, and this vow was the outflow\nof a heart filled with gratitude for the assurance of God\u2019s love and\nmercy. Jacob felt that God had claims upon him which he must\nacknowledge, and that the special tokens of divine favor granted\nhim demanded a return. So does every blessing bestowed upon us\ncall for a response to the Author of all our mercies. The Christian\nshould often review his past life and recall with gratitude the precious\ndeliverances that God has wrought for him, supporting him in trial,\nopening ways before him when all seemed dark and forbidding,\nrefreshing him when ready to faint. He should recognize all of\nthem as evidences of the watchcare of heavenly angels. In view of\nthese innumerable blessings he should often ask, with subdued and\ngrateful heart, \u201cWhat shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits\ntoward me?\u201d Psalm 116:12.\n160 Patriarchs and Prophets\nOur time, our talents, our property, should be sacredly devoted to\nHim who has given us these blessings in trust. Whenever a special\ndeliverance is wrought in our behalf, or new and unexpected favors[188]\nare granted us, we should acknowledge God\u2019s goodness, not only\nby expressing our gratitude in words, but, like Jacob, by gifts and\nofferings to His cause. As we are continually receiving the blessings\nof God, so we are to be continually giving.\n\u201cOf all that Thou shalt give me,\u201d said Jacob, \u201cI will surely give\nthe tenth unto Thee.\u201d Shall we who enjoy the full light and privileges\nof the gospel be content to give less to God than was given by those\nwho lived in the former, less favored dispensation? Nay, as the bless-\nings we enjoy are greater, are not our obligations correspondingly\nincreased? But how small the estimate; how vain the endeavor to\nmeasure with mathematical rules, time, money, and love, against a\nlove so immeasurable and a gift of such inconceivable worth. Tithes\nfor Christ! Oh, meager pittance, shameful recompense for that which\ncost so much! From the cross of Calvary, Christ calls for an unre-\nserved consecration. All that we have, all that we are, should be\ndevoted to God.\nWith a new and abiding faith in the divine promises, and assured\nof the presence and guardianship of heavenly angels, Jacob pursued\nhis journey to \u201cthe land of the children of the East.\u201d Genesis 29:1,\nmargin. But how different his arrival from that of Abraham\u2019s mes-\nsenger nearly a hundred years before! The servant had come with a\ntrain of attendants riding upon camels, and with rich gifts of gold\nand silver; the son was a lonely, footsore traveler, with no possession\nsave his staff. Like Abraham\u2019s servant, Jacob tarried beside a well,\nand it was here that he met Rachel, Laban\u2019s younger daughter. It\nwas Jacob now who rendered service, rolling the stone from the\nwell and watering the flocks. On making known his kinship, he was\nwelcomed to the home of Laban. Though he came portionless and\nunattended, a few weeks showed the worth of his diligence and skill,\nand he was urged to tarry. It was arranged that he should render\nLaban seven years\u2019 service for the hand of Rachel.\nIn early times custom required the bridegroom, before the rat-\nification of a marriage engagement, to pay a sum of money or its\nequivalent in other property, according to his circumstances, to the\nfather of his wife. This was regarded as a safeguard to the marriage\nJacob\u2019s Flight and Exile 161\nrelation. Fathers did not think it safe to trust the happiness of their\ndaughters to men who had not made provision for the support of a\nfamily. If they had not sufficient thrift and energy to manage busi-\nness and acquire cattle or lands, it was feared that their life would [189]\nprove worthless. But provision was made to test those who had\nnothing to pay for a wife. They were permitted to labor for the father\nwhose daughter they loved, the length of time being regulated by\nthe value of the dowry required. When the suitor was faithful in\nhis services, and proved in other respects worthy, he obtained the\ndaughter as his wife; and generally the dowry which the father had\nreceived was given her at her marriage. In the case of both Rachel\nand Leah, however, Laban selfishly retained the dowry that should\nhave been given them; they referred to this when they said, just\nbefore the removal from Mesopotamia, \u201cHe hath sold us, and hath\nquite devoured also our money.\u201d\nThe ancient custom, though sometimes abused, as by Laban,\nwas productive of good results. When the suitor was required to\nrender service to secure his bride, a hasty marriage was prevented,\nand there was opportunity to test the depth of his affections, as well\nas his ability to provide for a family. In our time many evils result\nfrom pursuing an opposite course. It is often the case that persons\nbefore marriage have little opportunity to become acquainted with\neach other\u2019s habits and disposition, and, so far as everyday life is\nconcerned, they are virtually strangers when they unite their interests\nat the altar. Many find, too late, that they are not adapted to each\nother, and lifelong wretchedness is the result of their union. Often\nthe wife and children suffer from the indolence and inefficiency\nor the vicious habits of the husband and father. If the character of\nthe suitor had been tested before marriage, according to the ancient\ncustom, great unhappiness might have been prevented.\nSeven years of faithful service Jacob gave for Rachel, and the\nyears that he served \u201cseemed unto him but a few days, for the love he\nhad to her.\u201d But the selfish and grasping Laban, desiring to retain so\nvaluable a helper, practiced a cruel deception in substituting Leah for\nRachel. The fact that Leah herself was a party to the cheat, caused\nJacob to feel that he could not love her. His indignant rebuke to\nLaban was met with the offer of Rachel for another seven years\u2019\nservice. But the father insisted that Leah should not be discarded,\n162 Patriarchs and Prophets\nsince this would bring disgrace upon the family. Jacob was thus\nplaced in a most painful and trying position; he finally decided to\nretain Leah and marry Rachel. Rachel was ever the one best loved;\nbut his preference for her excited envy and jealousy, and his life was[190]\nembittered by the rivalry between the sister-wives.\nFor twenty years Jacob remained in Mesopotamia, laboring in\nthe service of Laban, who, disregarding the ties of kinship, was\nbent upon securing to himself all the benefits of their connection.\nFourteen years of toil he demanded for his two daughters; and during\nthe remaining period, Jacob\u2019s wages were ten times changed. Yet\nJacob\u2019s service was diligent and faithful. His words to Laban in\ntheir last interview vividly describe the untiring vigilance which he\nhad given to the interests of his exacting master: \u201cThis twenty years\nhave I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their\nyoung, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. That which was\ntorn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my\nhand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.\nThus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by\nnight; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.\u201d\nIt was necessary for the shepherd to watch his flocks day and\nnight. They were in danger from robbers, and also from wild beasts,\nwhich were numerous and bold, often committing great havoc in\nflocks that were not faithfully guarded. Jacob had many assistants\nin caring for the extensive flocks of Laban, but he himself was held\nresponsible for them all. During some portions of the year it was\nnecessary for him to be constantly with the flocks in person, to guard\nthem in the dry season against perishing from thirst, and during the\ncoldest months from becoming chilled with the heavy night frosts.\nJacob was the chief shepherd; the servants in his employ were the\nundershepherds. If any of the sheep were missing, the chief shepherd\nsuffered the loss; and he called the servants to whom he entrusted the\ncare of the flock to a strict account if it was not found in a flourishing\ncondition.\nThe shepherd\u2019s life of diligence and care-taking, and his tender\ncompassion for the helpless creatures entrusted to his charge, have\nbeen employed by the inspired writers to illustrate some of the most\nprecious truths of the gospel. Christ, in His relation to His people, is\ncompared to a shepherd. After the Fall He saw His sheep doomed to\nJacob\u2019s Flight and Exile 163\nperish in the dark ways of sin. To save these wandering ones He left\nthe honors and glories of His Father\u2019s house. He says, \u201cI will seek [191]\nthat which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away,\nand will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that\nwhich was sick.\u201d I will \u201csave My flock, and they shall no more be\na prey.\u201d \u201cNeither shall the beast of the land devour them.\u201d Ezekiel\n34:16, 22, 28. His voice is heard calling them to His fold, \u201ca shadow\nin the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a\ncovert from storm and from rain.\u201d Isaiah 4:6. His care for the flock is\nunwearied. He strengthens the weak, relieves the suffering, gathers\nthe lambs in His arms, and carries them in His bosom. His sheep\nlove Him. \u201cAnd a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from\nhim; for they know not the voice of strangers.\u201d John 10:5.\nChrist says, \u201cThe good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.\nBut he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep\nare not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth;\nand the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The hireling\nfleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. I am\nthe Good Shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of Mine.\u201d\nVerses 11-14.\nChrist, the Chief Shepherd, has entrusted the care of His flock to\nHis ministers as undershepherds; and He bids them have the same\ninterest that He has manifested, and feel the sacred responsibility of\nthe charge He has entrusted to them. He has solemnly commanded\nthem to be faithful, to feed the flock, to strengthen the weak, to\nrevive the fainting, and to shield them from devouring wolves.\nTo save His sheep, Christ laid down His own life; and He points\nHis shepherds to the love thus manifested, as their example. But\n\u201che that is an hireling, ... whose own the sheep are not,\u201d has no real\ninterest in the flock. He is laboring merely for gain, and he cares\nonly for himself. He studies his own profit instead of the interest of\nhis charge; and in time of peril or danger he will flee, and leave the\nflock.\nThe apostle Peter admonishes the undershepherds: \u201cFeed the\nflock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not\nby constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;\nneither as being lords over God\u2019s heritage, but being ensamples\nto the flock.\u201d 1 Peter 5:2, 3. Paul says, \u201cTake heed therefore unto\n164 Patriarchs and Prophets\nyourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost[192]\nhath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which He\nhath purchased with His own blood. For I know this, that after my\ndeparting shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the\nflock.\u201d Acts 20:28, 29.\nAll who regard as an unwelcome task the care and burdens that\nfall to the lot of the faithful shepherd, are reproved by the apostle:\n\u201cNot by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready\nmind.\u201d 1 Peter 5:2. All such unfaithful servants the Chief Shepherd\nwould willingly release. The church of Christ has been purchased\nwith His blood, and every shepherd should realize that the sheep\nunder his care cost an infinite sacrifice. He should regard them\neach as of priceless worth, and should be unwearied in his efforts\nto keep them in a healthy, flourishing condition. The shepherd who\nis imbued with the spirit of Christ will imitate His self-denying\nexample, constantly laboring for the welfare of his charge; and the\nflock will prosper under his care.\nAll will be called to render a strict account of their ministry. The\nMaster will demand of every shepherd, \u201cWhere is the flock that was\ngiven thee, thy beautiful flock?\u201d Jeremiah 13:20. He that is found\nfaithful, will receive a rich reward. \u201cWhen the Chief Shepherd shall\nappear,\u201d says the apostle, \u201cye shall receive a crown of glory that\nfadeth not away.\u201d 1 Peter 5:4.\nWhen Jacob, growing weary of Laban\u2019s service, proposed to\nreturn to Canaan, he said to his father-in-law, \u201cSend me away, that\nI may go unto mine own place, and to my country. Give me my\nwives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go:\nfor thou knowest my service which I have done thee.\u201d But Laban\nurged him to remain, declaring, \u201cI have learned by experience that\nthe Lord hath blessed me for thy sake.\u201d He saw that his property was\nincreasing under the care of his son-in-law.\nSaid Jacob, \u201cIt was little which thou hadst before I came, and it\nis now increased unto a multitude.\u201d But as time passed on, Laban\nbecame envious of the greater prosperity of Jacob, who \u201cincreased\nexceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menser-\nvants, and camels, and asses.\u201d Laban\u2019s sons shared their father\u2019s\njealousy, and their malicious speeches came to Jacob\u2019s ears: He\n\u201chath taken away all that was our father\u2019s, and of that which was our\nJacob\u2019s Flight and Exile 165\nfather\u2019s hath he gotten all this glory. And Jacob beheld the counte- [193]\nnance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.\u201d\nJacob would have left his crafty kinsman long before but for the\nfear of encountering Esau. Now he felt that he was in danger from\nthe sons of Laban, who, looking upon his wealth as their own, might\nendeavor to secure it by violence. He was in great perplexity and\ndistress, not knowing which way to turn. But mindful of the gracious\nBethel promise, he carried his case to God, and sought direction\nfrom Him. In a dream his prayer was answered: \u201cReturn unto the\nland of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.\u201d\nLaban\u2019s absence afforded opportunity for departure. The flocks\nand herds were speedily gathered and sent forward, and with his\nwives, children, and servants, Jacob crossed the Euphrates, urging\nhis way toward Gilead, on the borders of Canaan. After three days\nLaban learned of their flight, and set forth in pursuit, overtaking the\ncompany on the seventh day of their journey. He was hot with anger,\nand bent on forcing them to return, which he doubted not he could\ndo, since his band was much the stronger. The fugitives were indeed\nin great peril.\nThat he did not carry out his hostile purpose was due to the fact\nthat God Himself had interposed for the protection of His servant. \u201cIt\nis in the power of my hand to do you hurt,\u201d said Laban, \u201cbut the God\nof your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed\nthat thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad;\u201d that is, he should\nnot force him to return, or urge him by flattering inducements.\nLaban had withheld the marriage dowry of his daughters and had\never treated Jacob with craft and harshness; but with characteristic\ndissimulation he now reproached him for his secret departure, which\nhad given the father no opportunity to make a parting feast or even\nto bid farewell to his daughters and their children.\nIn reply Jacob plainly set forth Laban\u2019s selfish and grasping\npolicy, and appealed to him as a witness to his own faithfulness and\nhonesty. \u201cExcept the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and\nthe fear of Isaac, had been with me,\u201d said Jacob, \u201csurely thou hadst\nsent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction, and the\nlabor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.\u201d\nLaban could not deny the facts brought forward, and he now\nproposed to enter into a covenant of peace. Jacob consented to the [194]\n166 Patriarchs and Prophets\nproposal, and a pile of stones was erected as a token of the compact.\nTo this pillar Laban gave the name Mizpah, \u201cwatchtower,\u201d saying,\n\u201cThe Lord watch between me and thee, when we are absent one\nfrom another.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this\npillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee; this heap be witness,\nand this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee,\nand that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for\nharm. The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their\nfather, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father\nIsaac.\u201d To confirm the treaty, the parties held a feast. The night\nwas spent in friendly communing; and at the dawn of day, Laban\nand his company departed. With this separation ceased all trace of\nconnection between the children of Abraham and the dwellers in\nMesopotamia.\nChapter 18\u2014The Night of Wrestling [195]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 32 and 33.\nThough Jacob had left Padan-aram in obedience to the divine\ndirection, it was not without many misgivings that he retraced the\nroad which he had trodden as a fugitive twenty years before. His\nsin in the deception of his father was ever before him. He knew that\nhis long exile was the direct result of that sin, and he pondered over\nthese things day and night, the reproaches of an accusing conscience\nmaking his journey very sad. As the hills of his native land appeared\nbefore him in the distance, the heart of the patriarch was deeply\nmoved. All the past rose vividly before him. With the memory of\nhis sin came also the thought of God\u2019s favor toward him, and the\npromises of divine help and guidance.\nAs he drew nearer his journey\u2019s end, the thought of Esau brought\nmany a troubled foreboding. After the flight of Jacob, Esau had\nregarded himself as the sole heir of their father\u2019s possessions. The\nnews of Jacob\u2019s return would excite the fear that he was coming to\nclaim the inheritance. Esau was now able to do his brother great\ninjury, if so disposed, and he might be moved to violence against him,\nnot only by the desire for revenge, but in order to secure undisturbed\npossession of the wealth which he had so long looked upon as his\nown.\nAgain the Lord granted Jacob a token of the divine care. As\nhe traveled southward from Mount Gilead, two hosts of heavenly\nangels seemed to encompass him behind and before, advancing with\nhis company, as if for their protection. Jacob remembered the vision\nat Bethel so long before, and his burdened heart grew lighter at this\nevidence that the divine messengers who had brought him hope and\ncourage at his flight from Canaan were to be the guardians of his\nreturn. And he said, \u201cThis is God\u2019s host: and he called the name of\nthat place Mahanaim\u201d\u2014\u201ctwo hosts, or, camps.\u201d\n167\n168 Patriarchs and Prophets\nYet Jacob felt that he had something to do to secure his own\nsafety. He therefore dispatched messengers with a conciliatory\ngreeting to his brother. He instructed them as to the exact words in[196]\nwhich they were to address Esau. It had been foretold before the\nbirth of the two brothers that the elder should serve the younger, and,\nlest the memory of this should be a cause of bitterness, Jacob told\nthe servants they were sent to \u201cmy lord Esau;\u201d when brought before\nhim, they were to refer to their master as \u201cthy servant Jacob;\u201d and to\nremove the fear that he was returning, a destitute wanderer, to claim\nthe paternal inheritance, Jacob was careful to state in his message, \u201cI\nhave oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants:\nand I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.\u201d\nBut the servants returned with the tidings that Esau was ap-\nproaching with four hundred men, and no response was sent to the\nfriendly message. It appeared certain that he was coming to seek\nrevenge. Terror pervaded the camp. \u201cJacob was greatly afraid and\ndistressed.\u201d He could not go back, and he feared to advance. His\ncompany, unarmed and defenseless, were wholly unprepared for a\nhostile encounter. He accordingly divided them into two bands, so\nthat if one should be attacked, the other might have an opportunity\nto escape. He sent from his vast flocks generous presents to Esau,\nwith a friendly message. He did all in his power to atone for the\nwrong to his brother and to avert the threatened danger, and then in\nhumiliation and repentance he pleaded for divine protection: Thou\n\u201csaidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and\nI will deal well with thee: I am not worthy of the least of all the\nmercies, and of all the truth, which Thou hast showed unto Thy\nservant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am\nbecome two bands. Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my\nbrother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and\nsmite me, and the mother with the children.\u201d\nThey had now reached the river Jabbok, and as night came on,\nJacob sent his family across the ford of the river, while he alone\nremained behind. He had decided to spend the night in prayer, and\nhe desired to be alone with God. God could soften the heart of Esau.\nIn Him was the patriarch\u2019s only hope.\nIt was in a lonely, mountainous region, the haunt of wild beasts\nand the lurking place of robbers and murderers. Solitary and unpro-\nNight of Wrestling 169\ntected, Jacob bowed in deep distress upon the earth. It was midnight.\nAll that made life dear to him were at a distance, exposed to danger [197]\nand death. Bitterest of all was the thought that it was his own sin\nwhich had brought this peril upon the innocent. With earnest cries\nand tears he made his prayer before God. Suddenly a strong hand\nwas laid upon him. He thought that an enemy was seeking his life,\nand he endeavored to wrest himself from the grasp of his assailant.\nIn the darkness the two struggled for the mastery. Not a word was\nspoken, but Jacob put forth all his strength, and did not relax his ef-\nforts for a moment. While he was thus battling for his life, the sense\nof his guilt pressed upon his soul; his sins rose up before him, to\nshut him out from God. But in his terrible extremity he remembered\nGod\u2019s promises, and his whole heart went out in entreaty for His\nmercy. The struggle continued until near the break of day, when the\nstranger placed his finger upon Jacob\u2019s thigh, and he was crippled in-\nstantly. The patriarch now discerned the character of his antagonist.\nHe knew that he had been in conflict with a heavenly messenger,\nand this was why his almost superhuman effort had not gained the\nvictory. It was Christ, \u201cthe Angel of the covenant,\u201d who had revealed\nHimself to Jacob. The patriarch was now disabled and suffering the\nkeenest pain, but he would not loosen his hold. All penitent and\nbroken, he clung to the Angel; \u201che wept, and made supplication\u201d\n(Hosea 12:4), pleading for a blessing. He must have the assurance\nthat his sin was pardoned. Physical pain was not sufficient to divert\nhis mind from this object. His determination grew stronger, his faith\nmore earnest and persevering, until the very last. The Angel tried\nto release Himself; He urged, \u201cLet Me go, for the day breaketh;\u201d\nbut Jacob answered, \u201cI will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.\u201d\nHad this been a boastful, presumptuous confidence, Jacob would\nhave been instantly destroyed; but his was the assurance of one\nwho confesses his own unworthiness, yet trusts the faithfulness of a\ncovenant-keeping God.\nJacob \u201chad power over the Angel, and prevailed.\u201d Hosea 12:4.\nThrough humiliation, repentance, and self-surrender, this sinful,\nerring mortal prevailed with the Majesty of heaven. He had fastened\nhis trembling grasp upon the promises of God, and the heart of\nInfinite Love could not turn away the sinner\u2019s plea.\n170 Patriarchs and Prophets\nThe error that had led to Jacob\u2019s sin in obtaining the birthright\nby fraud was now clearly set before him. He had not trusted God\u2019s\npromises, but had sought by his own efforts to bring about that[198]\nwhich God would have accomplished in His own time and way. As\nan evidence that he had been forgiven, his name was changed from\none that was a reminder of his sin, to one that commemorated his\nvictory. \u201cThy name,\u201d said the Angel, \u201cshall be called no more Jacob\n[the supplanter], but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God\nand with men, and hast prevailed.\u201d\nJacob had received the blessing for which his soul had longed.\nHis sin as a supplanter and deceiver had been pardoned. The crisis\nin his life was past. Doubt, perplexity, and remorse had embittered\nhis existence, but now all was changed; and sweet was the peace of\nreconciliation with God. Jacob no longer feared to meet his brother.\nGod, who had forgiven his sin, could move the heart of Esau also to\naccept his humiliation and repentance.\nWhile Jacob was wrestling with the Angel, another heavenly\nmessenger was sent to Esau. In a dream, Esau beheld his brother for\ntwenty years an exile from his father\u2019s house; he witnessed his grief\nat finding his mother dead; he saw him encompassed by the hosts\nof God. This dream was related by Esau to his soldiers, with the\ncharge not to harm Jacob, for the God of his father was with him.\nThe two companies at last approached each other, the desert\nchief leading his men of war, and Jacob with his wives and children,\nattended by shepherds and handmaidens, and followed by long lines\nof flocks and herds. Leaning upon his staff, the patriarch went\nforward to meet the band of soldiers. He was pale and disabled from\nhis recent conflict, and he walked slowly and painfully, halting at\nevery step; but his countenance was lighted up with joy and peace.\nAt sight of that crippled sufferer, \u201cEsau ran to meet him, and em-\nbraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.\u201d As\nthey looked upon the scene, even the hearts of Esau\u2019s rude soldiers\nwere touched. Notwithstanding he had told them of his dream, they\ncould not account for the change that had come over their captain.\nThough they beheld the patriarch\u2019s infirmity, they little thought that\nthis his weakness had been made his strength.\nIn his night of anguish beside the Jabbok, when destruction\nseemed just before him, Jacob had been taught how vain is the help[199]\n[200]\n[201]\nNight of Wrestling 171\nof man, how groundless is all trust in human power. He saw that his\nonly help must come from Him against whom he had so grievously\nsinned. Helpless and unworthy, he pleaded God\u2019s promise of mercy\nto the repentant sinner. That promise was his assurance that God\nwould pardon and accept him. Sooner might heaven and earth pass\nthan that word could fail; and it was this that sustained him through\nthat fearful conflict.\nJacob\u2019s experience during that night of wrestling and anguish\nrepresents the trial through which the people of God must pass just\nbefore Christ\u2019s second coming. The prophet Jeremiah, in holy vision\nlooking down to this time, said, \u201cWe have heard a voice of trembling,\nof fear, and not of peace.... All faces are turned into paleness. Alas!\nfor that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of\nJacob\u2019s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.\u201d Jeremiah 30:5-7.\nWhen Christ shall cease His work as mediator in man\u2019s behalf,\nthen this time of trouble will begin. Then the case of every soul will\nhave been decided, and there will be no atoning blood to cleanse\nfrom sin. When Jesus leaves His position as man\u2019s intercessor before\nGod, the solemn announcement is made, \u201cHe that is unjust, let him\nbe unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he\nthat is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him\nbe holy still.\u201d Revelation 22:11. Then the restraining Spirit of God is\nwithdrawn from the earth. As Jacob was threatened with death by his\nangry brother, so the people of God will be in peril from the wicked\nwho are seeking to destroy them. And as the patriarch wrestled all\nnight for deliverance from the hand of Esau, so the righteous will cry\nto God day and night for deliverance from the enemies that surround\nthem.\nSatan had accused Jacob before the angels of God, claiming the\nright to destroy him because of his sin; he had moved upon Esau to\nmarch against him; and during the patriarch\u2019s long night of wrestling,\nSatan endeavored to force upon him a sense of his guilt, in order to\ndiscourage him, and break his hold upon God. When in his distress\nJacob laid hold of the Angel, and made supplication with tears, the\nheavenly Messenger, in order to try his faith, also reminded him of\nhis sin, and endeavored to escape from him. But Jacob would not\nbe turned away. He had learned that God is merciful, and he cast\nhimself upon His mercy. He pointed back to his repentance for his [202]\n172 Patriarchs and Prophets\nsin, and pleaded for deliverance. As he reviewed his life, he was\ndriven almost to despair; but he held fast the Angel, and with earnest,\nagonizing cries urged his petition until he prevailed.\nSuch will be the experience of God\u2019s people in their final struggle\nwith the powers of evil. God will test their faith, their perseverance,\ntheir confidence in His power to deliver them. Satan will endeavor\nto terrify them with the thought that their cases are hopeless; that\ntheir sins have been too great to receive pardon. They will have a\ndeep sense of their shortcomings, and as they review their lives their\nhopes will sink. But remembering the greatness of God\u2019s mercy, and\ntheir own sincere repentance, they will plead His promises made\nthrough Christ to helpless, repenting sinners. Their faith will not fail\nbecause their prayers are not immediately answered. They will lay\nhold of the strength of God, as Jacob laid hold of the Angel, and the\nlanguage of their souls will be, \u201cI will not let Thee go, except Thou\nbless me.\u201d\nHad not Jacob previously repented of his sin in obtaining the\nbirthright by fraud, God could not have heard his prayer and mer-\ncifully preserved his life. So in the time of trouble, if the people of\nGod had unconfessed sins to appear before them while tortured with\nfear and anguish, they would be overwhelmed; despair would cut off\ntheir faith, and they could not have confidence to plead with God for\ndeliverance. But while they have a deep sense of their unworthiness,\nthey will have no concealed wrongs to reveal. Their sins will have\nbeen blotted out by the atoning blood of Christ, and they cannot\nbring them to remembrance.\nSatan leads many to believe that God will overlook their un-\nfaithfulness in the minor affairs of life; but the Lord shows in His\ndealing with Jacob that He can in no wise sanction or tolerate evil.\nAll who endeavor to excuse or conceal their sins, and permit them\nto remain upon the books of heaven, unconfessed and unforgiven,\nwill be overcome by Satan. The more exalted their profession, and\nthe more honorable the position which they hold, the more grievous\nis their course in the sight of God, and the more certain the triumph\nof the great adversary.\nYet Jacob\u2019s history is an assurance that God will not cast off\nthose who have been betrayed into sin, but who have returned unto[203]\nHim with true repentance. It was by self-surrender and confiding\nNight of Wrestling 173\nfaith that Jacob gained what he had failed to gain by conflict in his\nown strength. God thus taught His servant that divine power and\ngrace alone could give him the blessing he craved. Thus it will be\nwith those who live in the last days. As dangers surround them,\nand despair seizes upon the soul, they must depend solely upon the\nmerits of the atonement. We can do nothing of ourselves. In all our\nhelpless unworthiness we must trust in the merits of the crucified\nand risen Saviour. None will ever perish while they do this. The\nlong, black catalogue of our delinquencies is before the eye of the\nInfinite. The register is complete; none of our offenses are forgotten.\nBut He who listened to the cries of His servants of old, will hear the\nprayer of faith and pardon our transgressions. He has promised, and\nHe will fulfill His word.\nJacob prevailed because he was persevering and determined. His\nexperience testifies to the power of importunate prayer. It is now that\nwe are to learn this lesson of prevailing prayer, of unyielding faith.\nThe greatest victories to the church of Christ or to the individual\nChristian are not those that are gained by talent or education, by\nwealth or the favor of men. They are those victories that are gained\nin the audience chamber with God, when earnest, agonizing faith\nlays hold upon the mighty arm of power.\nThose who are unwilling to forsake every sin and to seek\nearnestly for God\u2019s blessing, will not obtain it. But all who will\nlay hold of God\u2019s promises as did Jacob, and be as earnest and per-\nsevering as he was, will succeed as he succeeded. \u201cShall not God\navenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him, though He\nbear long with them? I tell you that He will avenge them speedily.\u201d\nLuke 18:7, 8.\nChapter 19\u2014The Return to Canaan[204]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 34; 35; 37.\nCrossing the Jordan, \u201cJacob came in peace to the city of\nShechem, which is in the land of Canaan.\u201d Genesis 33:18, R.V .\nThus the patriarch\u2019s prayer at Bethel, that God would bring him\nagain in peace to his own land, had been granted. For a time he\ndwelt in the vale of Shechem. It was here that Abraham, more than\na hundred years before, had made his first encampment and erected\nhis first altar in the Land of Promise. Here Jacob \u201cbought the parcel\nof ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children\nof Hamor, Shechem\u2019s father, for a hundred pieces of money. And\nhe erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel\u201d (verses 19,\n20)\u2014\u201cGod, the God of Israel.\u201d Like Abraham, Jacob set up beside\nhis tent an altar unto the Lord, calling the members of his household\nto the morning and the evening sacrifice. It was here also that he\ndug the well to which, seventeen centuries later, came Jacob\u2019s Son\nand Saviour, and beside which, resting during the noontide heat, He\ntold His wondering hearers of that \u201cwell of water springing up into\neverlasting life.\u201d John 4:14.\nThe tarry of Jacob and his sons at Shechem ended in violence and\nbloodshed. The one daughter of the household had been brought to\nshame and sorrow, two brothers were involved in the guilt of murder,\na whole city had been given to ruin and slaughter, in retaliation for\nthe lawless deed of one rash youth. The beginning that led to results\nso terrible was the act of Jacob\u2019s daughter, who \u201cwent out to see\nthe daughters of the land,\u201d thus venturing into association with the\nungodly. He who seeks pleasure among those that fear not God is\nplacing himself on Satan\u2019s ground and inviting his temptations.\nThe treacherous cruelty of Simeon and Levi was not unprovoked;\nyet in their course toward the Shechemites they committed a grievous\nsin. They had carefully concealed from Jacob their intentions, and[205]\nthe tidings of their revenge filled him with horror. Heartsick at the\n174\nReturn to Canaan 175\ndeceit and violence of his sons, he only said, \u201cYe have troubled me\nto make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land: ... and I\nbeing few in number, they shall gather themselves together against\nme, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.\u201d But the\ngrief and abhorrence with which he regarded their bloody deed is\nshown by the words in which, nearly fifty years later, he referred\nto it, as he lay upon his deathbed in Egypt: \u201cSimeon and Levi are\nbrethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. O my soul,\ncome not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honor, be\nnot thou united.... Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their\nwrath, for it was cruel.\u201d Genesis 49:5-7.\nJacob felt that there was cause for deep humiliation. Cruelty and\nfalsehood were manifest in the character of his sons. There were\nfalse gods in the camp, and idolatry had to some extent gained a\nfoothold even in his household. Should the Lord deal with them\naccording to their deserts, would He not leave them to the vengeance\nof the surrounding nations?\nWhile Jacob was thus bowed down with trouble, the Lord di-\nrected him to journey southward to Bethel. The thought of this\nplace reminded the patriarch not only of his vision of the angels\nand of God\u2019s promises of mercy, but also of the vow which he had\nmade there, that the Lord should be his God. He determined that\nbefore going to this sacred spot his household should be freed from\nthe defilement of idolatry. He therefore gave direction to all in the\nencampment, \u201cPut away the strange gods that are among you, and\nbe clean, and change your garments: and let us arise, and go up to\nBethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me\nin the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.\u201d\nWith deep emotion Jacob repeated the story of his first visit to\nBethel, when he left his father\u2019s tent a lonely wanderer, fleeing for\nhis life, and how the Lord had appeared to him in the night vision.\nAs he reviewed the wonderful dealings of God with him, his own\nheart was softened, his children also were touched by a subduing\npower; he had taken the most effectual way to prepare them to join\nin the worship of God when they should arrive at Bethel. \u201cAnd they\ngave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and [206]\nall their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under\nthe oak which was by Shechem.\u201d\n176 Patriarchs and Prophets\nGod caused a fear to rest upon the inhabitants of the land, so\nthat they made no attempt to avenge the slaughter at Shechem. The\ntravelers reached Bethel unmolested. Here the Lord again appeared\nto Jacob and renewed to him the covenant promise. \u201cAnd Jacob set\nup a pillar in the place where He talked with him, even a pillar of\nstone.\u201d\nAt Bethel, Jacob was called to mourn the loss of one who\nhad long been an honored member of his father\u2019s family\u2014Re-\nbekah\u2019s nurse, Deborah, who had accompanied her mistress from\nMesopotamia to the land of Canaan. The presence of this aged\nwoman had been to Jacob a precious tie that bound him to his early\nlife, and especially to the mother whose love for him had been so\nstrong and tender. Deborah was buried with expressions of so great\nsorrow that the oak under which her grave was made, was called\n\u201cthe oak of weeping.\u201d It should not be passed unnoticed that the\nmemory of her life of faithful service and of the mourning over this\nhousehold friend has been accounted worthy to be preserved in the\nword of God.\nFrom Bethel it was only a two days\u2019 journey to Hebron, but it\nbrought to Jacob a heavy grief in the death of Rachel. Twice seven\nyears\u2019 service he had rendered for her sake, and his love had made\nthe toil but light. How deep and abiding that love had been, was\nshown when long afterward, as Jacob in Egypt lay near his death,\nJoseph came to visit his father, and the aged patriarch, glancing back\nupon his own life, said, \u201cAs for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel\ndied by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was\nbut a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the\nway of Ephrath.\u201d Genesis 48:7. In the family history of his long and\ntroubled life the loss of Rachel was alone recalled.\nBefore her death Rachel gave birth to a second son. With her\nparting breath she named the child Benoni, \u201cson of my sorrow.\u201d\nBut his father called him Benjamin, \u201cson of my right hand,\u201d or \u201cmy\nstrength.\u201d Rachel was buried where she died, and a pillar was raised\nupon the spot to perpetuate her memory.\nOn the way to Ephrath another dark crime stained the family of\nJacob, causing Reuben, the first-born son, to be denied the privileges\nand honors of the birthright.\nAt last Jacob came to his journey\u2019s end, \u201cunto Isaac his father[207]\nReturn to Canaan 177\nunto Mamre, ... which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac so-\njourned.\u201d Here he remained during the closing years of his father\u2019s\nlife. To Isaac, infirm and blind, the kind attentions of this long-absent\nson were a comfort during years of loneliness and bereavement.\nJacob and Esau met at the deathbed of their father. Once the\nelder brother had looked forward to this event as an opportunity for\nrevenge, but his feelings had since greatly changed. And Jacob,\nwell content with the spiritual blessings of the birthright, resigned\nto the elder brother the inheritance of their father\u2019s wealth\u2014the\nonly inheritance that Esau sought or valued. They were no longer\nestranged by jealousy or hatred, yet they parted, Esau removing\nto Mount Seir. God, who is rich in blessing, had granted to Jacob\nworldly wealth, in addition to the higher good that he had sought.\nThe possessions of the two brothers \u201cwere more than that they might\ndwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not\nbear them because of their cattle.\u201d This separation was in accordance\nwith the divine purpose concerning Jacob. Since the brothers differed\nso greatly in regard to religious faith, it was better for them to dwell\napart.\nEsau and Jacob had alike been instructed in the knowledge of\nGod, and both were free to walk in His commandments and to\nreceive His favor; but they had not both chosen to do this. The\ntwo brothers had walked in different ways, and their paths would\ncontinue to diverge more and more widely.\nThere was no arbitrary choice on the part of God by which Esau\nwas shut out from the blessings of salvation. The gifts of His grace\nthrough Christ are free to all. There is no election but one\u2019s own by\nwhich any may perish. God has set forth in His word the conditions\nupon which every soul will be elected to eternal life\u2014obedience\nto His commandments, through faith in Christ. God has elected a\ncharacter in harmony with His law, and anyone who shall reach the\nstandard of His requirement will have an entrance into the kingdom\nof glory. Christ Himself said, \u201cHe that believeth on the Son hath\neverlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life.\u201d\nJohn 3:36. \u201cNot everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall\nenter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My\nFather which is in heaven.\u201d Matthew 7:21. And in the Revelation\nHe declares, \u201cBlessed are they that do His commandments, that they [208]\n178 Patriarchs and Prophets\nmay have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates\ninto the city.\u201d Revelation 22:14. As regards man\u2019s final salvation,\nthis is the only election brought to view in the word of God.\nEvery soul is elected who will work out his own salvation with\nfear and trembling. He is elected who will put on the armor and fight\nthe good fight of faith. He is elected who will watch unto prayer, who\nwill search the Scriptures, and flee from temptation. He is elected\nwho will have faith continually, and who will be obedient to every\nword that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. The provisions of\nredemption are free to all; the results of redemption will be enjoyed\nby those who have complied with the conditions.\nEsau had despised the blessings of the covenant. He had valued\ntemporal above spiritual good, and he had received that which he\ndesired. It was by his own deliberate choice that he was separated\nfrom the people of God. Jacob had chosen the inheritance of faith.\nHe had endeavored to obtain it by craft, treachery, and falsehood;\nbut God had permitted his sin to work out its correction. Yet through\nall the bitter experience of his later years, Jacob had never swerved\nfrom his purpose or renounced his choice. He had learned that in\nresorting to human skill and craft to secure the blessing, he had\nbeen warring against God. From that night of wrestling beside the\nJabbok, Jacob had come forth a different man. Self-confidence had\nbeen uprooted. Henceforth the early cunning was no longer seen.\nIn place of craft and deception, his life was marked by simplicity\nand truth. He had learned the lesson of simple reliance upon the\nAlmighty Arm, and amid trial and affliction he bowed in humble\nsubmission to the will of God. The baser elements of character were\nconsumed in the furnace fire, the true gold was refined, until the\nfaith of Abraham and Isaac appeared undimmed in Jacob.\nThe sin of Jacob, and the train of events to which it led, had not\nfailed to exert an influence for evil\u2014an influence that revealed its\nbitter fruit in the character and life of his sons. As these sons arrived\nat manhood they developed serious faults. The results of polygamy\nwere manifest in the household. This terrible evil tends to dry up\nthe very springs of love, and its influence weakens the most sacred\nties. The jealousy of the several mothers had embittered the family[209]\nrelation, the children had grown up contentious and impatient of\ncontrol, and the father\u2019s life was darkened with anxiety and grief.\nReturn to Canaan 179\nThere was one, however, of a widely different character\u2014the\nelder son of Rachel, Joseph, whose rare personal beauty seemed\nbut to reflect an inward beauty of mind and heart. Pure, active, and\njoyous, the lad gave evidence also of moral earnestness and firmness.\nHe listened to his father\u2019s instructions, and loved to obey God. The\nqualities that afterward distinguished him in Egypt\u2014gentleness,\nfidelity, and truthfulness\u2014were already manifest in his daily life.\nHis mother being dead, his affections clung the more closely to the\nfather, and Jacob\u2019s heart was bound up in this child of his old age.\nHe \u201cloved Joseph more than all his children.\u201d\nBut even this affection was to become a cause of trouble and\nsorrow. Jacob unwisely manifested his preference for Joseph, and\nthis excited the jealousy of his other sons. As Joseph witnessed the\nevil conduct of his brothers, he was greatly troubled; he ventured\ngently to remonstrate with them, but only aroused still further their\nhatred and resentment. He could not endure to see them sinning\nagainst God, and he laid the matter before his father, hoping that his\nauthority might lead them to reform.\nJacob carefully avoided exciting their anger by harshness or\nseverity. With deep emotion he expressed his solicitude for his chil-\ndren, and implored them to have respect for his gray hairs, and not\nto bring reproach upon his name, and above all not to dishonor God\nby such disregard of His precepts. Ashamed that their wickedness\nwas known, the young men seemed to be repentant, but they only\nconcealed their real feelings, which were rendered more bitter by\nthis exposure.\nThe father\u2019s injudicious gift to Joseph of a costly coat, or tunic,\nsuch as was usually worn by persons of distinction, seemed to them\nanother evidence of his partiality, and excited a suspicion that he\nintended to pass by his elder children, to bestow the birthright upon\nthe son of Rachel. Their malice was still further increased as the boy\none day told them of a dream that he had had. \u201cBehold,\u201d he said,\n\u201cwe were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and\nalso stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and\nmade obeisance to my sheaf.\u201d\n\u201cShalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have [210]\ndominion over us?\u201d exclaimed his brothers in envious anger.\n180 Patriarchs and Prophets\nSoon he had another dream, of similar import, which he also\nrelated: \u201cBehold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made\nobeisance to me.\u201d This dream was interpreted as readily as the\nfirst. The father, who was present, spoke reprovingly\u2014\u201cWhat is\nthis dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy\nbrethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?\u201d\nNotwithstanding the apparent severity of his words, Jacob believed\nthat the Lord was revealing the future to Joseph.\nAs the lad stood before his brothers, his beautiful countenance\nlighted up with the Spirit of inspiration, they could not withhold\ntheir admiration; but they did not choose to renounce their evil ways,\nand they hated the purity that reproved their sins. The same spirit\nthat actuated Cain was kindling in their hearts.\nThe brothers were obliged to move from place to place to secure\npasturage for their flocks, and frequently they were absent from\nhome for months together. After the circumstances just related, they\nwent to the place which their father had bought at Shechem. Some\ntime passed, bringing no tidings from them, and the father began to\nfear for their safety, on account of their former cruelty toward the\nShechemites. He therefore sent Joseph to find them, and bring him\nwords as to their welfare. Had Jacob known the real feeling of his\nsons toward Joseph, he would not have trusted him alone with them;\nbut this they had carefully concealed.\nWith a joyful heart, Joseph parted from his father, neither the\naged man nor the youth dreaming of what would happen before\nthey should meet again. When, after his long and solitary journey,\nJoseph arrived at Shechem, his brothers and their flocks were not to\nbe found. Upon inquiring for them, he was directed to Dothan. He\nhad already traveled more than fifty miles, and now an additional\ndistance of fifteen lay before him, but he hastened on, forgetting his\nweariness in the thought of relieving the anxiety of his father, and\nmeeting the brothers, whom, despite their unkindness, he still loved.\nHis brothers saw him approaching; but no thought of the long\njourney he had made to meet them, of his weariness and hunger, of\nhis claims upon their hospitality and brotherly love, softened the[211]\nbitterness of their hatred. The sight of the coat, the token of their\nfather\u2019s love, filled them with frenzy. \u201cBehold, this dreamer cometh,\u201d\nthey cried in mockery. Envy and revenge, long secretly cherished,\nReturn to Canaan 181\nnow controlled them. \u201cLet us slay him,\u201d they said, \u201cand cast him\ninto some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him;\nand we shall see what will become of his dreams.\u201d\nThey would have executed their purpose but for Reuben. He\nshrank from participating in the murder of his brother, and proposed\nthat Joseph be cast alive into a pit, and left there to perish; secretly\nintending, however, to rescue him and return him to his father. Hav-\ning persuaded all to consent to this plan, Reuben left the company,\nfearing that he might fail to control his feelings, and that his real\nintentions would be discovered.\nJoseph came on, unsuspicious of danger, and glad that the object\nof his long search was accomplished; but instead of the expected\ngreeting, he was terrified by the angry and revengeful glances which\nhe met. He was seized and his coat stripped from him. Taunts and\nthreats revealed a deadly purpose. His entreaties were unheeded. He\nwas wholly in the power of those maddened men. Rudely dragging\nhim to a deep pit, they thrust him in, and having made sure that there\nwas no possibility of his escape, they left him there to perish from\nhunger, while they \u201csat down to eat bread.\u201d\nBut some of them were ill at ease; they did not feel the satisfac-\ntion they had anticipated from their revenge. Soon a company of\ntravelers was seen approaching. It was a caravan of Ishmaelites from\nbeyond Jordan, on their way to Egypt with spices and other mer-\nchandise. Judah now proposed to sell their brother to these heathen\ntraders instead of leaving him to die. While he would be effectually\nput out of their way, they would remain clear of his blood; \u201cfor,\u201d\nhe urged, \u201che is our brother and our flesh.\u201d To this proposition all\nagreed, and Joseph was quickly drawn out of the pit.\nAs he saw the merchants the dreadful truth flashed upon him. To\nbecome a slave was a fate more to be feared than death. In an agony\nof terror he appealed to one and another of his brothers, but in vain.\nSome were moved with pity, but fear of derision kept them silent;\nall felt that they had now gone too far to retreat. If Joseph were\nspared, he would doubtless report them to the father, who would [212]\nnot overlook their cruelty toward his favorite son. Steeling their\nhearts against his entreaties, they delivered him into the hands of the\nheathen traders. The caravan moved on, and was soon lost to view.\n182 Patriarchs and Prophets\nReuben returned to the pit, but Joseph was not there. In alarm\nand self-reproach he rent his garments, and sought his brothers,\nexclaiming, \u201cThe child is not; and I, whither shall I go?\u201d Upon\nlearning the fate of Joseph, and that it would now be impossible to\nrecover him, Reuben was induced to unite with the rest in the attempt\nto conceal their guilt. Having killed a kid, they dipped Joseph\u2019s coat\nin its blood, and took it to their father, telling him that they had found\nit in the fields, and that they feared it was their brother\u2019s. \u201cKnow\nnow,\u201d they said, \u201cwhether it be thy son\u2019s coat or no.\u201d They had\nlooked forward to this scene with dread, but they were not prepared\nfor the heart-rending anguish, the utter abandonment of grief, which\nthey were compelled to witness. \u201cIt is my son\u2019s coat,\u201d said Jacob;\n\u201can evil beast hath devoured him. Joseph is without doubt rent in\npieces.\u201d Vainly his sons and daughters attempted to comfort him.\nHe \u201crent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned\nfor his son many days.\u201d Time seemed to bring no alleviation of his\ngrief. \u201cI will go down into the grave unto my son mourning,\u201d was\nhis despairing cry. The young men, terrified at what they had done,\nyet dreading their father\u2019s reproaches, still hid in their own hearts\nthe knowledge of their guilt, which even to themselves seemed very\ngreat.\nChapter 20\u2014Joseph in Egypt [213]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 39 to 41.\nMeanwhile, Joseph with his captors was on the way to Egypt.\nAs the caravan journeyed southward toward the borders of Canaan,\nthe boy could discern in the distance the hills among which lay his\nfather\u2019s tents. Bitterly he wept at thought of that loving father in\nhis loneliness and affliction. Again the scene at Dothan came up\nbefore him. He saw his angry brothers and felt their fierce glances\nbent upon him. The stinging, insulting words that had met his\nagonized entreaties were ringing in his ears. With a trembling heart\nhe looked forward to the future. What a change in situation\u2014from\nthe tenderly cherished son to the despised and helpless slave! Alone\nand friendless, what would be his lot in the strange land to which he\nwas going? For a time Joseph gave himself up to uncontrolled grief\nand terror.\nBut, in the providence of God, even this experience was to be\na blessing to him. He had learned in a few hours that which years\nmight not otherwise have taught him. His father, strong and tender\nas his love had been, had done him wrong by his partiality and\nindulgence. This unwise preference had angered his brothers and\nprovoked them to the cruel deed that had separated him from his\nhome. Its effects were manifest also in his own character. Faults had\nbeen encouraged that were now to be corrected. He was becoming\nself-sufficient and exacting. Accustomed to the tenderness of his\nfather\u2019s care, he felt that he was unprepared to cope with the diffi-\nculties before him, in the bitter, uncared-for life of a stranger and a\nslave.\nThen his thoughts turned to his father\u2019s God. In his childhood he\nhad been taught to love and fear Him. Often in his father\u2019s tent he\nhad listened to the story of the vision that Jacob saw as he fled from\nhis home an exile and a fugitive. He had been told of the Lord\u2019s\npromises to Jacob, and how they had been fulfilled\u2014how, in the\n183\n184 Patriarchs and Prophets\nhour of need, the angels of God had come to instruct, comfort, and[214]\nprotect him. And he had learned of the love of God in providing\nfor men a Redeemer. Now all these precious lessons came vividly\nbefore him. Joseph believed that the God of his fathers would be\nhis God. He then and there gave himself fully to the Lord, and he\nprayed that the Keeper of Israel would be with him in the land of his\nexile.\nHis soul thrilled with the high resolve to prove himself true to\nGod\u2014under all circumstances to act as became a subject of the King\nof heaven. He would serve the Lord with undivided heart; he would\nmeet the trials of his lot with fortitude and perform every duty with\nfidelity. One day\u2019s experience had been the turning point in Joseph\u2019s\nlife. Its terrible calamity had transformed him from a petted child to\na man, thoughtful, courageous, and self-possessed.\nArriving in Egypt, Joseph was sold to Potiphar, captain of the\nking\u2019s guard, in whose service he remained for ten years. He was\nhere exposed to temptations of no ordinary character. He was in\nthe midst of idolatry. The worship of false gods was surrounded by\nall the pomp of royalty, supported by the wealth and culture of the\nmost highly civilized nation then in existence. Yet Joseph preserved\nhis simplicity and his fidelity to God. The sights and sounds of\nvice were all about him, but he was as one who saw and heard not.\nHis thoughts were not permitted to linger upon forbidden subjects.\nThe desire to gain the favor of the Egyptians could not cause him\nto conceal his principles. Had he attempted to do this, he would\nhave been overcome by temptation; but he was not ashamed of the\nreligion of his fathers, and he made no effort to hide the fact that he\nwas a worshiper of Jehovah.\n\u201cAnd the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man....\nAnd his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord\nmade all that he did to prosper in his hand.\u201d Potiphar\u2019s confidence\nin Joseph increased daily, and he finally promoted him to be his\nsteward, with full control over all his possessions. \u201cAnd he left all\nthat he had in Joseph\u2019s hand; and he knew not aught he had, save the\nbread which he did eat.\u201d\nThe marked prosperity which attended everything placed under\nJoseph\u2019s care was not the result of a direct miracle; but his industry,\ncare, and energy were crowned with the divine blessing. Joseph\nJoseph in Egypt 185\nattributed his success to the favor of God, and even his idolatrous\nmaster accepted this as the secret of his unparalleled prosperity. [215]\n[216]\n[217]\nWithout steadfast, well-directed effort, however, success could never\nhave been attained. God was glorified by the faithfulness of His\nservant. It was His purpose that in purity and uprightness the believer\nin God should appear in marked contrast to the worshipers of idols\u2014\nthat thus the light of heavenly grace might shine forth amid the\ndarkness of heathenism.\nJoseph\u2019s gentleness and fidelity won the heart of the chief captain,\nwho came to regard him as a son rather than a slave. The youth was\nbrought in contact with men of rank and learning, and he acquired a\nknowledge of science, of languages, and of affairs\u2014an education\nneedful to the future prime minister of Egypt.\nBut Joseph\u2019s faith and integrity were to be tested by fiery trials.\nHis master\u2019s wife endeavored to entice the young man to transgress\nthe law of God. Heretofore he had remained untainted by the corrup-\ntion teeming in that heathen land; but this temptation, so sudden, so\nstrong, so seductive\u2014how should it be met? Joseph knew well what\nwould be the consequence of resistance. On the one hand were con-\ncealment, favor, and rewards; on the other, disgrace, imprisonment,\nperhaps death. His whole future life depended upon the decision of\nthe moment. Would principle triumph? Would Joseph still be true to\nGod? With inexpressible anxiety, angels looked upon the scene.\nJoseph\u2019s answer reveals the power of religious principle. He\nwould not betray the confidence of his master on earth, and, whatever\nthe consequences, he would be true to his Master in heaven. Under\nthe inspecting eye of God and holy angels many take liberties of\nwhich they would not be guilty in the presence of their fellow men,\nbut Joseph\u2019s first thought was of God. \u201cHow ... can I do this great\nwickedness, and sin against God?\u201d he said.\nIf we were to cherish an habitual impression that God sees and\nhears all that we do and say and keeps a faithful record of our\nwords and actions, and that we must meet it all, we would fear\nto sin. Let the young ever remember that wherever they are, and\nwhatever they do, they are in the presence of God. No part of\nour conduct escapes observation. We cannot hide our ways from\nthe Most High. Human laws, though sometimes severe, are often\ntransgressed without detection, and hence with impunity. But not\n186 Patriarchs and Prophets\nso with the law of God. The deepest midnight is no cover for the\nguilty one. He may think himself alone, but to every deed there is[218]\nan unseen witness. The very motives of his heart are open to divine\ninspection. Every act, every word, every thought, is as distinctly\nmarked as though there were only one person in the whole world,\nand the attention of heaven were centered upon him.\nJoseph suffered for his integrity, for his tempter revenged herself\nby accusing him of a foul crime, and causing him to be thrust into\nprison. Had Potiphar believed his wife\u2019s charge against Joseph,\nthe young Hebrew would have lost his life; but the modesty and\nuprightness that had uniformly characterized his conduct were proof\nof his innocence; and yet, to save the reputation of his master\u2019s\nhouse, he was abandoned to disgrace and bondage.\nAt the first Joseph was treated with great severity by his jailers.\nThe psalmist says, \u201cHis feet they hurt with fetters; he was laid in\nchains of iron: until the time that his word came to pass; the word\nof the Lord tried him.\u201d Psalm 105:18, 19, R.V . But Joseph\u2019s real\ncharacter shines out, even in the darkness of the dungeon. He held\nfast his faith and patience; his years of faithful service had been most\ncruelly repaid, yet this did not render him morose or distrustful. He\nhad the peace that comes from conscious innocence, and he trusted\nhis case with God. He did not brood upon his own wrongs, but\nforgot his sorrow in trying to lighten the sorrows of others. He found\na work to do, even in the prison. God was preparing him in the\nschool of affliction for greater usefulness, and he did not refuse the\nneedful discipline. In the prison, witnessing the results of oppression\nand tyranny and the effects of crime, he learned lessons of justice,\nsympathy, and mercy, that prepared him to exercise power with\nwisdom and compassion.\nJoseph gradually gained the confidence of the keeper of the\nprison, and was finally entrusted with the charge of all the prisoners.\nIt was the part he acted in the prison\u2014the integrity of his daily life\nand his sympathy for those who were in trouble and distress\u2014that\nopened the way for his future prosperity and honor. Every ray of\nlight that we shed upon others is reflected upon ourselves. Every\nkind and sympathizing word spoken to the sorrowful, every act to\nrelieve the oppressed, and every gift to the needy, if prompted by a\nright motive, will result in blessings to the giver.\nJoseph in Egypt 187\nThe chief baker and chief butler of the king had been cast into [219]\nprison for some offense, and they came under Joseph\u2019s charge. One\nmorning, observing that they appeared very sad, he kindly inquired\nthe cause and was told that each had had a remarkable dream, of\nwhich they were anxious to learn the significance. \u201cDo not inter-\npretations belong to God?\u201d said Joseph, \u201ctell me them, I pray you.\u201d\nAs each related his dream, Joseph made known its import: In three\ndays the butler was to be reinstated in his position, and give the cup\ninto Pharaoh\u2019s hand as before, but the chief baker would be put to\ndeath by the king\u2019s command. In both cases the event occurred as\nforetold.\nThe king\u2019s cupbearer had professed the deepest gratitude to\nJoseph, both for the cheering interpretation of his dream and for\nmany acts of kind attention; and in return the latter, referring in a\nmost touching manner to his own unjust captivity, entreated that his\ncase be brought before the king. \u201cThink on me,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen it\nshall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and\nmake mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:\nfor indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here\nalso have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.\u201d\nThe chief butler saw the dream fulfilled in every particular; but when\nrestored to royal favor, he thought no more of his benefactor. For\ntwo years longer Joseph remained a prisoner. The hope that had\nbeen kindled in his heart gradually died out, and to all other trials\nwas added the bitter sting of ingratitude.\nBut a divine hand was about to open the prison gates. The king\nof Egypt had in one night two dreams, apparently pointing to the\nsame event and seeming to foreshadow some great calamity. He\ncould not determine their significance, yet they continued to trouble\nhis mind. The magicians and wise men of his realm could give no in-\nterpretation. The king\u2019s perplexity and distress increased, and terror\nspread throughout his palace. The general agitation recalled to the\nchief butler\u2019s mind the circumstances of his own dream; with it came\nthe memory of Joseph, and a pang of remorse for his forgetfulness\nand ingratitude. He at once informed the king how his own dream\nand that of the chief baker had been interpreted by a Hebrew captive,\nand how the predictions had been fulfilled.\nIt was humiliating to Pharaoh to turn away from the magicians [220]\n188 Patriarchs and Prophets\nand wise men of his kingdom to consult an alien and a slave, but he\nwas ready to accept the lowliest service if his troubled mind might\nfind relief. Joseph was immediately sent for; he put off his prison\nattire, and shaved himself, for his hair had grown long during the\nperiod of his disgrace and confinement. He was then conducted to\nthe presence of the king.\n\u201cAnd Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and\nthere is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that\nthou canst understand a dream to interpret it. And Joseph answered\nPharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of\npeace.\u201d Joseph\u2019s reply to the king reveals his humility and his faith\nin God. He modestly disclaims the honor of possessing in himself\nsuperior wisdom. \u201cIt is not in me.\u201d God alone can explain these\nmysteries.\nPharaoh then proceeded to relate his dreams: \u201cBehold, I stood\nupon the bank of the river: and, behold, there came up out of the\nriver seven kine, fat-fleshed and well-favored; and they fed in a\nmeadow: and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor\nand very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the\nland of Egypt for badness: and the lean and the ill-favored kine did\neat up the first seven fat kine: and when they had eaten them up,\nit could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still\nill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke. And I saw in my dream,\nand, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: and,\nbehold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind,\nsprung up after them: and the thin ears devoured the seven good\nears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that\ncould declare it to me.\u201d\n\u201cThe dream of Pharaoh is one,\u201d said Joseph. \u201cGod hath showed\nPharaoh what He is about to do.\u201d There were to be seven years of\ngreat plenty. Field and garden would yield more abundantly than\never before. And this period was to be followed by seven years of\nfamine. \u201cAnd the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of\nthat famine following; for it shall be very grievous.\u201d The repetition\nof the dream was evidence both of the certainty and nearness of the\nfulfillment. \u201cNow therefore,\u201d he continued, \u201clet Pharaoh look out\na man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. Let\nPharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take\nJoseph in Egypt 189\nup the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. [221]\nAnd let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and\nlay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the\ncities. And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven\nyears of famine.\u201d\nThe interpretation was so reasonable and consistent, and the\npolicy which it recommended was so sound and shrewd, that its\ncorrectness could not be doubted. But who was to be entrusted with\nthe execution of the plan? Upon the wisdom of this choice depended\nthe nation\u2019s preservation. The king was troubled. For some time\nthe matter of the appointment was under consideration. Through the\nchief butler the monarch had learned of the wisdom and prudence\ndisplayed by Joseph in the management of the prison; it was evident\nthat he possessed administrative ability in a pre-eminent degree.\nThe cupbearer, now filled with self-reproach, endeavored to atone\nfor his former ingratitude, by the warmest praise of his benefactor;\nand further inquiry by the king proved the correctness of his report.\nIn all the realm Joseph was the only man gifted with wisdom to\npoint out the danger that threatened the kingdom and the preparation\nnecessary to meet it; and the king was convinced that he was the\none best qualified to execute the plans which he had proposed. It\nwas evident that a divine power was with him, and that there were\nnone among the king\u2019s officers of state so well qualified to conduct\nthe affairs of the nation at this crisis. The fact that he was a Hebrew\nand a slave was of little moment when weighed against his evident\nwisdom and sound judgment. \u201cCan we find such a one as this is, a\nman in whom the Spirit of God is?\u201d said the king to his counselors.\nThe appointment was decided upon, and to Joseph the astonish-\ning announcement was made, \u201cForasmuch as God hath showed thee\nall this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: thou shalt\nbe over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people\nbe ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.\u201d The king\nproceeded to invest Joseph with the insignia of his high office. \u201cAnd\nPharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph\u2019s\nhand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain\nabout his neck; and he made him to ride in the second chariot which\nhe had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee.\u201d\n\u201cHe made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: [222]\n190 Patriarchs and Prophets\nto bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.\u201d\nPsalm 105:21, 22. From the dungeon Joseph was exalted to be ruler\nover all the land of Egypt. It was a position of high honor, yet it was\nbeset with difficulty and peril. One cannot stand upon a lofty height\nwithout danger. As the tempest leaves unharmed the lowly flower\nof the valley, while it uproots the stately tree upon the mountaintop,\nso those who have maintained their integrity in humble life may\nbe dragged down to the pit by the temptations that assail worldly\nsuccess and honor. But Joseph\u2019s character bore the test alike of\nadversity and prosperity. The same fidelity to God was manifest\nwhen he stood in the palace of the Pharaohs as when in a prisoner\u2019s\ncell. He was still a stranger in a heathen land, separated from his\nkindred, the worshipers of God; but he fully believed that the divine\nhand had directed his steps, and in constant reliance upon God he\nfaithfully discharged the duties of his position. Through Joseph the\nattention of the king and great men of Egypt was directed to the\ntrue God; and though they adhered to their idolatry, they learned\nto respect the principles revealed in the life and character of the\nworshiper of Jehovah.\nHow was Joseph enabled to make such a record of firmness\nof character, uprightness, and wisdom?\u2014In his early years he had\nconsulted duty rather than inclination; and the integrity, the simple\ntrust, the noble nature, of the youth bore fruit in the deeds of the man.\nA pure and simple life had favored the vigorous development of both\nphysical and intellectual powers. Communion with God through\nHis works and the contemplation of the grand truths entrusted to\nthe inheritors of faith had elevated and ennobled his spiritual nature,\nbroadening and strengthening the mind as no other study could do.\nFaithful attention to duty in every station, from the lowliest to the\nmost exalted, had been training every power for its highest service.\nHe who lives in accordance with the Creator\u2019s will is securing to\nhimself the truest and noblest development of character. \u201cThe fear of\nthe Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.\u201d\nJob 28:28.\nThere are few who realize the influence of the little things of life\nupon the development of character. Nothing with which we have to\ndo is really small. The varied circumstances that we meet day by[223]\nday are designed to test our faithfulness and to qualify us for greater\nJoseph in Egypt 191\ntrusts. By adherence to principle in the transactions of ordinary\nlife, the mind becomes accustomed to hold the claims of duty above\nthose of pleasure and inclination. Minds thus disciplined are not\nwavering between right and wrong, like the reed trembling in the\nwind; they are loyal to duty because they have trained themselves\nto habits of fidelity and truth. By faithfulness in that which is least\nthey acquire strength to be faithful in greater matters.\nAn upright character is of greater worth than the gold of Ophir.\nWithout it none can rise to an honorable eminence. But character is\nnot inherited. It cannot be bought. Moral excellence and fine mental\nqualities are not the result of accident. The most precious gifts are\nof no value unless they are improved. The formation of a noble\ncharacter is the work of a lifetime and must be the result of diligent\nand persevering effort. God gives opportunities; success depends\nupon the use made of them.\nChapter 21\u2014Joseph and His Brothers[224]\nThis chapter is based on Genesis 41:54-56; 42 to 50.\nAt the very opening of the fruitful years began the preparation\nfor the approaching famine. Under the direction of Joseph, immense\nstorehouses were erected in all the principal places throughout the\nland of Egypt, and ample arrangements were made for preserving\nthe surplus of the expected harvest. The same policy was continued\nduring the seven years of plenty, until the amount of grain laid in\nstore was beyond computation.\nAnd now the seven years of dearth began to come, according\nto Joseph\u2019s prediction. \u201cAnd the dearth was in all lands; but in all\nthe land of Egypt there was bread. And when all the land of Egypt\nwas famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh\nsaid unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you,\ndo. And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph\nopened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians.\u201d\nThe famine extended to the land of Canaan and was severely\nfelt in that part of the country where Jacob dwelt. Hearing of the\nabundant provision made by the king of Egypt, ten of Jacob\u2019s sons\njourneyed thither to purchase grain. On their arrival they were\ndirected to the king\u2019s deputy, and with other applicants they came to\npresent themselves before the ruler of the land. And they \u201cbowed\ndown themselves before him with their faces to the earth.\u201d \u201cJoseph\nknew his brethren, but they knew not him.\u201d His Hebrew name had\nbeen exchanged for the one bestowed upon him by the king, and\nthere was little resemblance between the prime minister of Egypt and\nthe stripling whom they had sold to the Ishmaelites. As Joseph saw\nhis brothers stooping and making obeisance, his dreams came to his\nmind, and the scenes of the past rose vividly before him. His keen\neye, surveying the group, discovered that Benjamin was not among\nthem. Had he also fallen a victim to the treacherous cruelty of those[225]\n192\nJoseph and His Brothers 193\nsavage men? He determined to learn the truth. \u201cYe are spies,\u201d he\nsaid sternly; \u201cto see the nakedness of the land ye are come.\u201d\nThey answered, \u201cNay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants\ncome. We are all one man\u2019s sons; we are true men; thy servants are\nno spies.\u201d He wished to learn if they possessed the same haughty\nspirit as when he was with them, and also to draw from them some\ninformation in regard to their home; yet he well knew how deceptive\ntheir statements might be. He repeated the charge, and they replied,\n\u201cThy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land\nof Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and\none is not.\u201d\nProfessing to doubt the truthfulness of their story, and to still\nlook upon them as spies, the governor declared that he would prove\nthem, by requiring them to remain in Egypt till one of their number\nshould go and bring their youngest brother down. If they would\nnot consent to this, they were to be treated as spies. But to such\nan arrangement the sons of Jacob could not agree, since the time\nrequired for carrying it out would cause their families to suffer for\nfood; and who among them would undertake the journey alone,\nleaving his brothers in prison? How could he meet his father under\nsuch circumstances? It appeared probable that they were to be put\nto death or to be made slaves; and if Benjamin were brought, it\nmight be only to share their fate. They decided to remain and suffer\ntogether, rather than bring additional sorrow upon their father by\nthe loss of his only remaining son. They were accordingly cast into\nprison, where they remained three days.\nDuring the years since Joseph had been separated from his broth-\ners, these sons of Jacob had changed in character. Envious, turbulent,\ndeceptive, cruel, and revengeful they had been; but now, when tested\nby adversity, they were shown to be unselfish, true to one another,\ndevoted to their father, and, themselves middle-aged men, subject to\nhis authority.\nThe three days in the Egyptian prison were days of bitter sorrow\nas the brothers reflected upon their past sins. Unless Benjamin could\nbe produced their conviction as spies appeared certain, and they had\nlittle hope of gaining their father\u2019s consent to Benjamin\u2019s absence.\nOn the third day Joseph caused the brothers to be brought before\nhim. He dared not detain them longer. Already his father and the [226]\n194 Patriarchs and Prophets\nfamilies with him might be suffering for food. \u201cThis do, and live,\u201d\nhe said; \u201cfor I fear God; if ye be true men, let one of your brethren\nbe bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the\nfamine of your houses: but bring your youngest brother unto me; so\nshall your words be verified, and ye shall not die.\u201d This proposition\nthey agreed to accept, though expressing little hope that their father\nwould let Benjamin return with them. Joseph had communicated\nwith them through an interpreter, and having no thought that the\ngovernor understood them, they conversed freely with one another in\nhis presence. They accused themselves in regard to their treatment\nof Joseph: \u201cWe are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we\nsaw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would\nnot hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.\u201d Reuben, who had\nformed the plan for delivering him at Dothan, added, \u201cSpake I not\nunto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not\nhear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.\u201d Joseph, listening,\ncould not control his emotions, and he went out and wept. On his\nreturn he commanded that Simeon be bound before them and again\ncommitted to prison. In the cruel treatment of their brother, Simeon\nhad been the instigator and chief actor, and it was for this reason that\nthe choice fell upon him.\nBefore permitting his brothers to depart, Joseph gave directions\nthat they should be supplied with grain, and also that each man\u2019s\nmoney should be secretly placed in the mouth of his sack. Provender\nfor the beasts on the homeward journey was also supplied. On the\nway one of the company, opening his sack, was surprised to find his\nbag of silver. On his making known the fact to the others, they were\nalarmed and perplexed, and said one to another, \u201cWhat is this that\nGod hath done unto us?\u201d\u2014should they regard it as a token of good\nfrom the Lord, or had He suffered it to occur to punish them for their\nsins and plunge them still deeper in affliction? They acknowledged\nthat God had seen their sins, and that He was now punishing them.\nJacob was anxiously awaiting the return of his sons, and on their\narrival the whole encampment gathered eagerly around them as they\nrelated to their father all that had occurred. Alarm and apprehension\nfilled every heart. The conduct of the Egyptian governor seemed to\nimply some evil design, and their fears were confirmed, when, as\nthey opened their sacks, the owner\u2019s money was found in each. In[227]\nJoseph and His Brothers 195\nhis distress the aged father exclaimed, \u201cMe have ye bereaved of my\nchildren: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin\naway: all these things are against me.\u201d Reuben answered, \u201cSlay my\ntwo sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I\nwill bring him to thee again.\u201d This rash speech did not relieve the\nmind of Jacob. His answer was, \u201cMy son shall not go down with\nyou; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall\nhim by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my\ngray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\u201d\nBut the drought continued, and in process of time the supply of\ngrain that had been brought from Egypt was nearly exhausted. The\nsons of Jacob well knew that it would be in vain to return to Egypt\nwithout Benjamin. They had little hope of changing their father\u2019s\nresolution, and they awaited the issue in silence. Deeper and deeper\ngrew the shadow of approaching famine; in the anxious faces of all\nin the encampment the old man read their need; at last he said, \u201cGo\nagain, buy us a little food.\u201d\nJudah answered, \u201cThe man did solemnly protest unto us, saying,\nYe shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. If thou\nwilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:\nbut if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said\nunto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.\u201d\nSeeing that his father\u2019s resolution began to waver, he added, \u201cSend\nthe lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not\ndie, both we, and thou, and also our little ones;\u201d and he offered to\nbe surety for his brother and to bear the blame forever if he failed to\nrestore Benjamin to his father.\nJacob could no longer withhold his consent, and he directed his\nsons to prepare for the journey. He bade them also take to the ruler\na present of such things as the famine-wasted country afforded\u2014\u201ca\nlittle balm, and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds,\u201d\nalso a double quantity of money. \u201cTake also your brother,\u201d he said,\n\u201cand arise, go again unto the man.\u201d As his sons were about to depart\non their doubtful journey the aged father arose, and raising his hands\nto heaven, uttered the prayer, \u201cGod Almighty give you mercy before\nthe man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin.\nIf I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.\u201d\nAgain they journeyed to Egypt and presented themselves before [228]\n196 Patriarchs and Prophets\nJoseph. As his eye fell upon Benjamin, his own mother\u2019s son, he was\ndeeply moved. He concealed his emotion, however, but ordered that\nthey be taken to his house, and that preparation be made for them to\ndine with him. Upon being conducted to the governor\u2019s palace, the\nbrothers were greatly alarmed, fearing that they were to be called\nto account for the money found in their sacks. They thought that\nit might have been intentionally placed there, to furnish occasion\nfor making them slaves. In their distress they consulted with the\nsteward of the house, relating to him the circumstances of their visit\nto Egypt; and in proof of their innocence informed him that they had\nbrought back the money found in their sacks, also other money to\nbuy food; and they added, \u201cWe cannot tell who put our money in\nour sacks.\u201d The man replied, \u201cPeace be to you, fear not: your God,\nand the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks:\nI had your money.\u201d Their anxiety was relieved, and when Simeon,\nwho had been released from prison, joined them, they felt that God\nwas indeed gracious unto them.\nWhen the governor again met them they presented their gifts\nand humbly \u201cbowed themselves to him to the earth.\u201d Again his\ndreams came to his mind, and after saluting his guests he hastened\nto ask, \u201cIs your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is\nhe yet alive?\u201d \u201cThy servant our father is in good health, he is yet\nalive,\u201d was the answer, as they again made obeisance. Then his eye\nrested upon Benjamin, and he said, \u201cIs this your younger brother,\nof whom ye spake unto me?\u201d \u201cGod be gracious unto thee, my son;\u201d\nbut, overpowered by feelings of tenderness, he could say no more.\n\u201cHe entered into his chamber, and wept there.\u201d\nHaving recovered his self-possession, he returned, and all pro-\nceeded to the feast. By the laws of caste the Egyptians were forbid-\nden to eat with people of any other nation. The sons of Jacob had\ntherefore a table by themselves, while the governor, on account of\nhis high rank, ate by himself, and the Egyptians also had separate\ntables. When all were seated the brothers were surprised to see that\nthey were arranged in exact order, according to their ages. Joseph\n\u201csent messes unto them from before him;\u201d but Benjamin\u2019s was five\ntimes as much as any of theirs. By this token of favor to Benjamin\nhe hoped to ascertain if the youngest brother was regarded with the\nenvy and hatred that had been manifested toward himself. Still sup-\nJoseph and His Brothers 197\nposing that Joseph did not understand their language, the brothers [229]\nfreely conversed with one another; thus he had a good opportunity\nto learn their real feelings. Still he desired to test them further, and\nbefore their departure he ordered that his own drinking cup of silver\nshould be concealed in the sack of the youngest.\nJoyfully they set out on their return. Simeon and Benjamin\nwere with them, their animals were laden with grain, and all felt\nthat they had safely escaped the perils that had seemed to surround\nthem. But they had only reached the outskirts of the city when they\nwere overtaken by the governor\u2019s steward, who uttered the scathing\ninquiry, \u201cWherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? Is not this it in\nwhich my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have\ndone evil in so doing.\u201d This cup was supposed to possess the power\nof detecting any poisonous substance placed therein. At that day\ncups of this kind were highly valued as a safeguard against murder\nby poisoning.\nTo the steward\u2019s accusation the travelers answered, \u201cWherefore\nsaith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do\naccording to this thing: behold, the money, which we found in our\nsacks\u2019 mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan:\nhow then should we steal out of thy lord\u2019s house silver or gold? With\nwhomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we\nalso will be my lord\u2019s bondmen.\u201d\n\u201cNow also let it be according unto your words,\u201d said the steward;\n\u201che with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be\nblameless.\u201d\nThe search began immediately. \u201cThey speedily took down every\nman his sack to the ground,\u201d and the steward examined each, begin-\nning with Reuben\u2019s, and taking them in order down to that of the\nyoungest. In Benjamin\u2019s sack the cup was found.\nThe brothers rent their garments in token of utter wretchedness,\nand slowly returned to the city. By their own promise Benjamin was\ndoomed to a life of slavery. They followed the steward to the palace,\nand finding the governor yet there, they prostrated themselves before\nhim. \u201cWhat deed is this that ye have done?\u201d he said. \u201cWot ye not\nthat such a man as I can certainly divine?\u201d Joseph designed to draw\nfrom them an acknowledgment of their sin. He had never claimed\n198 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe power of divination, but was willing to have them believe that\nhe could read the secrets of their lives.\nJudah answered, \u201cWhat shall we say unto my lord? what shall[230]\nwe speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the\niniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord\u2019s servants, both we,\nand he also with whom the cup is found.\u201d\n\u201cGod forbid that I should do so,\u201d was the reply; \u201cbut the man in\nwhose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you,\nget you up in peace unto your father.\u201d\nIn his deep distress Judah now drew near to the ruler and ex-\nclaimed, \u201cO my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my\nlord\u2019s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou\nart even as Pharaoh.\u201d In words of touching eloquence he described\nhis father\u2019s grief at the loss of Joseph and his reluctance to let Ben-\njamin come with them to Egypt, as he was the only son left of his\nmother, Rachel, whom Jacob so dearly loved. \u201cNow therefore,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cwhen I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with\nus; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad\u2019s life; it shall come to\npass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and\nthy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father\nwith sorrow to the grave. For thy servant became surety for the lad\nunto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear\nthe blame to my father forever. Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy\nservant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the\nlad go up with his brethren. For how shall I go up to my father, and\nthe lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall\ncome on my father.\u201d\nJoseph was satisfied. He had seen in his brothers the fruits of\ntrue repentance. Upon hearing Judah\u2019s noble offer he gave orders\nthat all but these men should withdraw; then, weeping aloud, he\ncried, \u201cI am Joseph; doth my father yet live?\u201d\nHis brothers stood motionless, dumb with fear and amazement.\nThe ruler of Egypt their brother Joseph, whom they had envied\nand would have murdered, and finally sold as a slave! All their ill\ntreatment of him passed before them. They remembered how they\nhad despised his dreams and had labored to prevent their fulfillment.\nYet they had acted their part in fulfilling these dreams; and now that\nJoseph and His Brothers 199\nthey were completely in his power he would, no doubt, avenge the\nwrong that he had suffered.\nSeeing their confusion, he said kindly, \u201cCome near to me, I\npray you;\u201d and as they came near, he continued, \u201cI am Joseph your\nbrother, whom ye sold into Egypt. Now therefore be not grieved, nor [231]\nangry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me\nbefore you to preserve life.\u201d Feeling that they had already suffered\nenough for their cruelty toward him, he nobly sought to banish their\nfears and lessen the bitterness of their self-reproach.\n\u201cFor these two years,\u201d he continued, \u201chath the famine been in\nthe land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither\nbe earing nor harvest. And God sent me before you to preserve you\na posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.\nSo now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and He hath\nmade me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler\nthroughout all the land of Egypt. Haste ye, and go up to my father,\nand say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord\nof all Egypt: come down unto me tarry not: and thou shalt dwell in\nthe land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy\nchildren, and thy children\u2019s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds,\nand all that thou hast: and there will I nourish thee; for yet there\nare five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that\nthou hast, come to poverty. And, behold, your eyes see, and the\neyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto\nyou.\u201d \u201cAnd he fell upon his brother Benjamin\u2019s neck, and wept; and\nBenjamin wept upon his neck. Moreover he kissed all his brethren,\nand wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.\u201d\nThey humbly confessed their sin and entreated his forgiveness. They\nhad long suffered anxiety and remorse, and now they rejoiced that\nhe was still alive.\nThe news of what had taken place was quickly carried to the\nking, who, eager to manifest his gratitude to Joseph, confirmed the\ngovernor\u2019s invitation to his family, saying, \u201cThe good of all the land\nof Egypt is yours.\u201d The brothers were sent away abundantly sup-\nplied with provision and carriages and everything necessary for the\nremoval of all their families and attendants to Egypt. On Benjamin,\nJoseph bestowed more valuable gifts than upon the others. Then,\nfearing that disputes would arise among them on the homeward\n200 Patriarchs and Prophets\njourney, he gave them, as they were about to leave him, the charge,\n\u201cSee that ye fall not out by the way.\u201d\nThe sons of Jacob returned to their father with the joyful tidings,\n\u201cJoseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt.\u201d At\nfirst the aged man was overwhelmed; he could not believe what he[232]\nheard; but when he saw the long train of wagons and loaded animals,\nand when Benjamin was with him once more, he was convinced,\nand in the fullness of his joy exclaimed, \u201cIt is enough; Joseph my\nson is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.\u201d\nAnother act of humiliation remained for the ten brothers. They\nnow confessed to their father the deceit and cruelty that for so many\nyears had embittered his life and theirs. Jacob had not suspected\nthem of so base a sin, but he saw that all had been overruled for\ngood, and he forgave and blessed his erring children.\nThe father and his sons, with their families, their flocks and herds,\nand numerous attendants, were soon on the way to Egypt. With\ngladness of heart they pursued their journey, and when they came\nto Beersheba the patriarch offered grateful sacrifices and entreated\nthe Lord to grant them an assurance that He would go with them. In\na vision of the night the divine word came to him: \u201cFear not to go\ndown into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation. I will\ngo down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up\nagain.\u201d\nThe assurance, \u201cFear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there\nmake of thee a great nation,\u201d was significant. The promise had\nbeen given to Abraham of a posterity numberless as the stars, but\nas yet the chosen people had increased but slowly. And the land of\nCanaan now offered no field for the development of such a nation\nas had been foretold. It was in the possession of powerful heathen\ntribes, that were not to be dispossessed until \u201cthe fourth genera-\ntion.\u201d If the descendants of Israel were here to become a numerous\npeople, they must either drive out the inhabitants of the land or dis-\nperse themselves among them. The former, according to the divine\narrangement, they could not do; and should they mingle with the\nCanaanites, they would be in danger of being seduced into idolatry.\nEgypt, however, offered the conditions necessary to the fulfillment\nof the divine purpose. A section of country well-watered and fertile\nwas open to them there, affording every advantage for their speedy\nJoseph and His Brothers 201\nincrease. And the antipathy they must encounter in Egypt on account\nof their occupation\u2014for every shepherd was \u201can abomination unto\nthe Egyptians\u201d\u2014would enable them to remain a distinct and sepa-\nrate people and would thus serve to shut them out from participation\nin the idolatry of Egypt.\nUpon reaching Egypt the company proceeded directly to the land [233]\nof Goshen. Thither came Joseph in his chariot of state, attended\nby a princely retinue. The splendor of his surroundings and the\ndignity of his position were alike forgotten; one thought alone filled\nhis mind, one longing thrilled his heart. As he beheld the travelers\napproaching, the love whose yearnings had for so many long years\nbeen repressed, would no longer be controlled. He sprang from his\nchariot and hastened forward to bid his father welcome. \u201cAnd he\nfell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. And Israel said\nunto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because\nthou art yet alive.\u201d\nJoseph took five of his brothers to present to Pharaoh and receive\nfrom him the grant of land for their future home. Gratitude to his\nprime minister would have led the monarch to honor them with\nappointments to offices of state; but Joseph, true to the worship of\nJehovah, sought to save his brothers from the temptations to which\nthey would be exposed at a heathen court; therefore he counseled\nthem, when questioned by the king, to tell him frankly their occu-\npation. The sons of Jacob followed this counsel, being careful also\nto state that they had come to sojourn in the land, not to become\npermanent dwellers there, thus reserving the right to depart if they\nchose. The king assigned them a home, as offered, in \u201cthe best of\nthe land,\u201d the country of Goshen.\nNot long after their arrival Joseph brought his father also to be\npresented to the king. The patriarch was a stranger in royal courts;\nbut amid the sublime scenes of nature he had communed with a\nmightier Monarch; and now, in conscious superiority, he raised his\nhands and blessed Pharaoh.\nIn his first greeting to Joseph, Jacob had spoken as if, with this\njoyful ending to his long anxiety and sorrow, he was ready to die. But\nseventeen years were yet to be granted him in the peaceful retirement\nof Goshen. These years were in happy contrast to those that had\npreceded them. He saw in his sons evidence of true repentance;\n202 Patriarchs and Prophets\nhe saw his family surrounded by all the conditions needful for the\ndevelopment of a great nation; and his faith grasped the sure promise\nof their future establishment in Canaan. He himself was surrounded\nwith every token of love and favor that the prime minister of Egypt\ncould bestow; and happy in the society of his long-lost son, he passed\ndown gently and peacefully to the grave.\nAs he felt death approaching, he sent for Joseph. Still holding[234]\nfast the promise of God respecting the possession of Canaan, he said,\n\u201cBury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: but I will lie with my fathers,\nand thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying\nplace.\u201d Joseph promised to do so, but Jacob was not satisfied; he\nexacted a solemn oath to lay him beside his fathers in the cave of\nMachpelah.\nAnother important matter demanded attention; the sons of Joseph\nwere to be formally instated among the children of Israel. Joseph,\ncoming for a last interview with his father, brought with him Ephraim\nand Manasseh. These youths were connected, through their mother,\nwith the highest order of the Egyptian priesthood; and the position\nof their father opened to them the avenues to wealth and distinction,\nshould they choose to connect themselves with the Egyptians. It\nwas Joseph\u2019s desire, however, that they should unite with their own\npeople. He manifested his faith in the covenant promise, in behalf\nof his sons renouncing all the honors that the court of Egypt offered,\nfor a place among the despised shepherd tribes, to whom had been\nentrusted the oracles of God.\nSaid Jacob, \u201cThy two sons, Ephraim, and Manasseh, which were\nborn unto thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee into\nEgypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.\u201d They\nwere to be adopted as his own, and to become the heads of separate\ntribes. Thus one of the birthright privileges, which Reuben had\nforfeited, was to fall to Joseph\u2014a double portion in Israel.\nJacob\u2019s eyes were dim with age, and he had not been aware of\nthe presence of the young men; but now, catching the outline of their\nforms, he said, \u201cWho are these?\u201d On being told, he added, \u201cBring\nthem, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.\u201d As they came\nnearer, the patriarch embraced and kissed them, solemnly laying his\nhands upon their heads in benediction. Then he uttered the prayer,\n\u201cGod, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the\nJoseph and His Brothers 203\nGod which fed me all my life long unto this day, the Angel which\nredeemed me from all evil, bless the lads.\u201d There was no spirit of\nself-dependence, no reliance upon human power or cunning now.\nGod had been his preserver and support. There was no complaint\nof the evil days in the past. Its trials and sorrows were no longer\nregarded as things that were \u201cagainst\u201d him. Memory recalled only [235]\nHis mercy and loving-kindness who had been with him throughout\nhis pilgrimage.\nThe blessing ended, Jacob gave his son the assurance\u2014leaving\nfor the generations to come, through long years of bondage and\nsorrow, this testimony to his faith\u2014\u201cBehold, I die; but God shall be\nwith you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.\u201d\nAt the last all the sons of Jacob were gathered about his dying\nbed. And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, \u201cGather yourselves\ntogether, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your\nfather,\u201d \u201cthat I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last\ndays.\u201d Often and anxiously he had thought of their future, and had\nendeavored to picture to himself the history of the different tribes.\nNow as his children waited to receive his last blessing the Spirit of\nInspiration rested upon him, and before him in prophetic vision the\nfuture of his descendants was unfolded. One after another the names\nof his sons were mentioned, the character of each was described,\nand the future history of the tribes was briefly foretold.\n\u201cReuben, thou art my first-born,\nMy might, and the beginning of my strength,\nThe excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power.\u201d\nThus the father pictured what should have been the position of\nReuben as the first-born son; but his grievous sin at Edar had made\nhim unworthy of the birthright blessing. Jacob continued\u2014\n\u201cUnstable as water,\nThou shalt not excel.\u201d\nThe priesthood was apportioned to Levi, the kingdom and the\nMessianic promise to Judah, and the double portion of the inheri-\ntance to Joseph. The tribe of Reuben never rose to any eminence in\n204 Patriarchs and Prophets\nIsrael; it was not so numerous as Judah, Joseph, or Dan, and was\namong the first that were carried into captivity.\nNext in age to Reuben were Simeon and Levi. They had been\nunited in their cruelty toward the Shechemites, and they had also\nbeen the most guilty in the selling of Joseph. Concerning them it\nwas declared\u2014\n\u201cI will divide them in Jacob,\nAnd scatter them in Israel.\u201d\nAt the numbering of Israel, just before their entrance to Canaan,[236]\nSimeon was the smallest tribe. Moses, in his last blessing, made no\nreference to Simeon. In the settlement of Canaan this tribe had only\na small portion of Judah\u2019s lot, and such families as afterward became\npowerful formed different colonies and settled in territory outside\nthe borders of the Holy Land. Levi also received no inheritance\nexcept forty-eight cities scattered in different parts of the land. In the\ncase of this tribe, however, their fidelity to Jehovah when the other\ntribes apostatized, secured their appointment to the sacred service of\nthe sanctuary, and thus the curse was changed into a blessing.\nThe crowning blessings of the birthright were transferred to\nJudah. The significance of the name\u2014which denotes praise,\u2014is\nunfolded in the prophetic history of this tribe:\n\u201cJudah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise:\nThy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies;\nThy father\u2019s children shall bow down before thee.\nJudah is a lion\u2019s whelp:\nFrom the prey, my son, thou art gone up:\nHe stooped down, he couched as a lion,\nAnd as an old lion: who shall rouse him up?\nThe scepter shall not depart from Judah,\nNor a lawgiver from between his feet,\nUntil Shiloh come;\nAnd unto Him shall the gathering of the people be.\u201d\nThe lion, king of the forest, is a fitting symbol of this tribe, from\nwhich came David, and the Son of David, Shiloh, the true \u201cLion\nJoseph and His Brothers 205\nof the tribe of Judah,\u201d to whom all powers shall finally bow and all\nnations render homage.\nFor most of his children Jacob foretold a prosperous future. At\nlast the name of Joseph was reached, and the father\u2019s heart over-\nflowed as he invoked blessings upon \u201cthe head of him that was\nseparate from his brethren\u201d:\n\u201cJoseph is a fruitful bough,\nEven a fruitful bough by a well;\nWhose branches run over the wall:\nThe archers have sorely grieved him,\nAnd shot at him, and hated him:\nBut his bow abode in strength,\nAnd the arms of his hands were made strong\nBy the hands of the mighty God of Jacob;\n(From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel;).\nEven by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; [237]\nAnd by the Almighty, who shall bless thee\nWith blessings of heaven above,\nBlessings of the deep that lieth under,\nBlessings of the breasts, and of the womb:\nThe blessings of thy father have prevailed\nAbove the blessings of my progenitors\nUnto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills:\nThey shall be on the head of Joseph,\nAnd on the crown of the head of him that was separate from\nhis brethren.\u201d\nJacob had ever been a man of deep and ardent affection; his love\nfor his sons was strong and tender, and his dying testimony to them\nwas not the utterance of partiality or resentment. He had forgiven\nthem all, and he loved them to the last. His paternal tenderness would\nhave found expression only in words of encouragement and hope;\nbut the power of God rested upon him, and under the influence of\nInspiration he was constrained to declare the truth, however painful.\nThe last blessings pronounced, Jacob repeated the charge con-\ncerning his burial place: \u201cI am to be gathered unto my people: bury\nme with my fathers ... in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah.\u201d\n206 Patriarchs and Prophets\n\u201cThere they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried\nIsaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.\u201d Thus the last\nact of his life was to manifest his faith in God\u2019s promise.\nJacob\u2019s last years brought an evening of tranquillity and repose\nafter a troubled and weary day. Clouds had gathered dark above his\npath, yet his sun set clear, and the radiance of heaven illumined his\nparting hours. Says the Scripture, \u201cAt evening time it shall be light.\u201d\nZechariah 14:7. \u201cMark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for\nthe end of that man is peace.\u201d Psalm 37:37.\nJacob had sinned, and had deeply suffered. Many years of toil,\ncare, and sorrow had been his since the day when his great sin caused\nhim to flee from his father\u2019s tents. A homeless fugitive, separated\nfrom his mother, whom he never saw again; laboring seven years\nfor her whom he loved, only to be basely cheated; toiling twenty\nyears in the service of a covetous and grasping kinsman; seeing\nhis wealth increasing, and sons rising around him, but finding little\njoy in the contentious and divided household; distressed by his\ndaughter\u2019s shame, by her brothers\u2019 revenge, by the death of Rachel,[238]\nby the unnatural crime of Reuben, by Judah\u2019s sin, by the cruel\ndeception and malice practiced toward Joseph\u2014how long and dark\nis the catalogue of evils spread out to view! Again and again he\nhad reaped the fruit of that first wrong deed. Over and over he saw\nrepeated among his sons the sins of which he himself had been guilty.\nBut bitter as had been the discipline, it had accomplished its work.\nThe chastening, though grievous, had yielded \u201cthe peaceable fruit of\nrighteousness.\u201d Hebrews 12:11.\nInspiration faithfully records the faults of good men, those who\nwere distinguished by the favor of God; indeed, their faults are more\nfully presented than their virtues. This has been a subject of wonder\nto many, and has given the infidel occasion to scoff at the Bible. But\nit is one of the strongest evidences of the truth of Scripture, that facts\nare not glossed over, nor the sins of its chief characters suppressed.\nThe minds of men are so subject to prejudice that it is not possible\nfor human histories to be absolutely impartial. Had the Bible been\nwritten by uninspired persons, it would no doubt have presented the\ncharacter of its honored men in a more flattering light. But as it is,\nwe have a correct record of their experiences.\nJoseph and His Brothers 207\nMen whom God favored, and to whom He entrusted great respon-\nsibilities, were sometimes overcome by temptation and committed\nsin, even as we at the present day strive, waver, and frequently fall\ninto error. Their lives, with all their faults and follies, are open\nbefore us, both for our encouragement and warning. If they had\nbeen represented as without fault, we, with our sinful nature, might\ndespair at our own mistakes and failures. But seeing where others\nstruggled through discouragements like our own, where they fell\nunder temptations as we have done, and yet took heart again and\nconquered through the grace of God, we are encouraged in our striv-\ning after righteousness. As they, though sometimes beaten back,\nrecovered their ground, and were blessed of God, so we too may be\novercomers in the strength of Jesus. On the other hand, the record\nof their lives may serve as a warning to us. It shows that God will\nby no means clear the guilty. He sees sin in His most favored ones,\nand He deals with it in them even more strictly than in those who\nhave less light and responsibility.\nAfter the burial of Jacob fear again filled the hearts of Joseph\u2019s [239]\nbrothers. Notwithstanding his kindness toward them, conscious\nguilt made them distrustful and suspicious. It might be that he had\nbut delayed his revenge, out of regard to their father, and that he\nwould now visit upon them the long-deferred punishment for their\ncrime. They dared not appear before him in person, but sent a\nmessage: \u201cThy father did command before he died, saying, So shall\nye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy\nbrethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray\nthee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father.\u201d\nThis message affected Joseph to tears, and, encouraged by this, his\nbrothers came and fell down before him, with the words, \u201cBehold,\nwe be thy servants.\u201d Joseph\u2019s love for his brothers was deep and\nunselfish, and he was pained at the thought that they could regard\nhim as cherishing a spirit of revenge toward them. \u201cFear not,\u201d he\nsaid; \u201cfor am I in the place of God? But as for you, ye thought evil\nagainst me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this\nday, to save much people alive. Now therefore fear ye not: I will\nnourish you, and your little ones.\u201d\nThe life of Joseph illustrates the life of Christ. It was envy that\nmoved the brothers of Joseph to sell him as a slave; they hoped to\n208 Patriarchs and Prophets\nprevent him from becoming greater than themselves. And when\nhe was carried to Egypt, they flattered themselves that they were\nto be no more troubled with his dreams, that they had removed all\npossibility of their fulfillment. But their own course was overruled\nby God to bring about the very event that they designed to hinder.\nSo the Jewish priests and elders were jealous of Christ, fearing that\nHe would attract the attention of the people from them. They put\nHim to death, to prevent Him from becoming king, but they were\nthus bringing about this very result.\nJoseph, through his bondage in Egypt, became a savior to his\nfather\u2019s family; yet this fact did not lessen the guilt of his brothers.\nSo the crucifixion of Christ by His enemies made Him the Redeemer\nof mankind, the Saviour of the fallen race, and Ruler over the whole\nworld; but the crime of His murderers was just as heinous as though\nGod\u2019s providential hand had not controlled events for His own glory\nand the good of man.\nAs Joseph was sold to the heathen by his own brothers, so Christ[240]\nwas sold to His bitterest enemies by one of His disciples. Joseph\nwas falsely accused and thrust into prison because of his virtue; so\nChrist was despised and rejected because His righteous, self-denying\nlife was a rebuke to sin; and though guilty of no wrong, He was\ncondemned upon the testimony of false witnesses. And Joseph\u2019s\npatience and meekness under injustice and oppression, his ready\nforgiveness and noble benevolence toward his unnatural brothers,\nrepresent the Saviour\u2019s uncomplaining endurance of the malice and\nabuse of wicked men, and His forgiveness, not only of His murderers,\nbut of all who have come to Him confessing their sins and seeking\npardon.\nJoseph outlived his father fifty-four years. He lived to see\n\u201cEphraim\u2019s children of the third generation: the children also of\nMachir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph\u2019s knees.\u201d\nHe witnessed the increase and prosperity of his people, and through\nall the years his faith in God\u2019s restoration of Israel to the Land of\nPromise was unshaken.\nWhen he saw that his end was near, he summoned his kinsmen\nabout him. Honored as he had been in the land of the Pharaohs,\nEgypt was to him but the place of his exile; his last act was to signify\nthat his lot was cast with Israel. His last words were, \u201cGod will\nJoseph and His Brothers 209\nsurely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which\nHe sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\u201d And he took a solemn\noath of the children of Israel that they would carry up his bones with\nthem to the land of Canaan. \u201cSo Joseph died, being an hundred and\nten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in\nEgypt.\u201d And through the centuries of toil which followed, the coffin,\na reminder of the dying words of Joseph, testified to Israel that they\nwere only sojourners in Egypt, and bade them keep their hopes fixed\nupon the Land of Promise, for the time of deliverance would surely\ncome.\nChapter 22\u2014Moses[241]\nThis chapter is based on Exodus 1 to Exodus 4.\nThe people of Egypt, in order to supply themselves with food\nduring the famine, had sold to the crown their cattle and lands, and\nhad finally bound themselves to perpetual serfdom. Joseph wisely\nprovided for their release; he permitted them to become royal tenants,\nholding their lands of the king, and paying an annual tribute of one\nfifth of the products of their labor.\nBut the children of Jacob were not under the necessity of making\nsuch conditions. On account of the service that Joseph had rendered\nthe Egyptian nation, they were not only granted a part of the country\nas a home, but were exempted from taxation, and liberally supplied\nwith food during the continuance of the famine. The king publicly\nacknowledged that it was through the merciful interposition of the\nGod of Joseph that Egypt enjoyed plenty while other nations were\nperishing from famine. He saw, too, that Joseph\u2019s management\nhad greatly enriched the kingdom, and his gratitude surrounded the\nfamily of Jacob with royal favor.\nBut as time rolled on, the great man to whom Egypt owed so\nmuch, and the generation blessed by his labors, passed to the grave.\nAnd \u201cthere arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.\u201d\nNot that he was ignorant of Joseph\u2019s services to the nation, but he\nwished to make no recognition of them, and, so far as possible, to\nbury them in oblivion. \u201cAnd he said unto his people, Behold, the\npeople of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we: come\non, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to\npass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our\nenemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.\u201d\nThe Israelites had already become very numerous; they \u201cwere\nfruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed\nexceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.\u201d Under[242]\nJoseph\u2019s fostering care, and the favor of the king who was then\n210\nMoses 211\nruling, they had spread rapidly over the land. But they had kept\nthemselves a distinct race, having nothing in common with the\nEgyptians in customs or religion; and their increasing numbers now\nexcited the fears of the king and his people, lest in case of war they\nshould join themselves with the enemies of Egypt. Yet policy for-\nbade their banishment from the country. Many of them were able\nand understanding workmen, and they added greatly to the wealth\nof the nation; the king needed such laborers for the erection of his\nmagnificent palaces and temples. Accordingly he ranked them with\nthe Egyptians who had sold themselves with their possessions to the\nkingdom. Soon taskmasters were set over them, and their slavery\nbecame complete. \u201cAnd the Egyptians made the children of Israel to\nserve with rigor: and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage,\nin mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all\ntheir service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigor.\u201d \u201cBut\nthe more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.\u201d\nThe king and his counselors had hoped to subdue the Israelites\nwith hard labor, and thus decrease their numbers and crush out their\nindependent spirit. Failing to accomplish their purpose, they pro-\nceeded to more cruel measures. Orders were issued to the women\nwhose employment gave them opportunity for executing the com-\nmand, to destroy the Hebrew male children at their birth. Satan was\nthe mover in this matter. He knew that a deliverer was to be raised\nup among the Israelites; and by leading the king to destroy their chil-\ndren he hoped to defeat the divine purpose. But the women feared\nGod, and dared not execute the cruel mandate. The Lord approved\ntheir course, and prospered them. The king, angry at the failure\nof his design, made the command more urgent and extensive. The\nwhole nation was called upon to hunt out and slaughter his helpless\nvictims. \u201cAnd Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son\nthat is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall\nsave alive.\u201d\nWhile this decree was in full force a son was born to Amram\nand Jochebed, devout Israelites of the tribe of Levi. The babe was\n\u201ca goodly child;\u201d and the parents, believing that the time of Israel\u2019s\nrelease was drawing near, and that God would raise up a deliverer for\nHis people, determined that their little one should not be sacrificed. [243]\n212 Patriarchs and Prophets\nFaith in God strengthened their hearts, \u201cand they were not afraid of\nthe king\u2019s commandment.\u201d Hebrews 11:23.\nThe mother succeeded in concealing the child for three months.\nThen, finding that she could no longer keep him safely, she prepared\na little ark of rushes, making it watertight by means of slime and\npitch; and laying the babe therein, she placed it among the flags at\nthe river\u2019s brink. She dared not remain to guard it, lest the child\u2019s life\nand her own should be forfeited; but his sister, Miriam, lingered near,\napparently indifferent, but anxiously watching to see what would\nbecome of her little brother. And there were other watchers. The\nmother\u2019s earnest prayers had committed her child to the care of God;\nand angels, unseen, hovered above his lowly resting place. Angels\ndirected Pharaoh\u2019s daughter thither. Her curiosity was excited by\nthe little basket, and as she looked upon the beautiful child within,\nshe read the story at a glance. The tears of the babe awakened her\ncompassion, and her sympathies went out to the unknown mother\nwho had resorted to this means to preserve the life of her precious\nlittle one. She determined that he should be saved; she would adopt\nhim as her own.\nMiriam had been secretly noting every movement; perceiving\nthat the child was tenderly regarded, she ventured nearer, and at last\nsaid, \u201cShall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that\nshe may nurse the child for thee?\u201d And permission was given.\nThe sister hastened to her mother with the happy news, and with-\nout delay returned with her to the presence of Pharaoh\u2019s daughter.\n\u201cTake this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy\nwages,\u201d said the princess.\nGod had heard the mother\u2019s prayers; her faith had been rewarded.\nIt was with deep gratitude that she entered upon her now safe and\nhappy task. She faithfully improved her opportunity to educate her\nchild for God. She felt confident that he had been preserved for some\ngreat work, and she knew that he must soon be given up to his royal\nmother, to be surrounded with influences that would tend to lead\nhim away from God. All this rendered her more diligent and careful\nin his instruction than in that of her other children. She endeavored\nto imbue his mind with the fear of God and the love of truth and\njustice, and earnestly prayed that he might be preserved from every[244]\ncorrupting influence. She showed him the folly and sin of idolatry,\nMoses 213\nand early taught him to bow down and pray to the living God, who\nalone could hear him and help him in every emergency.\nShe kept the boy as long as she could, but was obliged to give\nhim up when he was about twelve years old. From his humble\ncabin home he was taken to the royal palace, to the daughter of\nPharaoh, \u201cand he became her son.\u201d Yet even here he did not lose\nthe impressions received in childhood. The lessons learned at his\nmother\u2019s side could not be forgotten. They were a shield from the\npride, the infidelity, and the vice that flourished amid the splendor\nof the court.\nHow far-reaching in its results was the influence of that one\nHebrew woman, and she an exile and a slave! The whole future\nlife of Moses, the great mission which he fulfilled as the leader of\nIsrael, testifies to the importance of the work of the Christian mother.\nThere is no other work that can equal this. To a very great extent the\nmother holds in her own hands the destiny of her children. She is\ndealing with developing minds and characters, working not alone\nfor time, but for eternity. She is sowing seed that will spring up and\nbear fruit, either for good or for evil. She has not to paint a form\nof beauty upon canvas or to chisel it from marble, but to impress\nupon a human soul the image of the divine. Especially during their\nearly years the responsibility rests upon her of forming the character\nof her children. The impressions now made upon their developing\nminds will remain with them all through life. Parents should direct\nthe instruction and training of their children while very young, to the\nend that they may be Christians. They are placed in our care to be\ntrained, not as heirs to the throne of an earthly empire, but as kings\nunto God, to reign through unending ages.\nLet every mother feel that her moments are priceless; her work\nwill be tested in the solemn day of accounts. Then it will be found\nthat many of the failures and crimes of men and women have re-\nsulted from the ignorance and neglect of those whose duty it was to\nguide their childish feet in the right way. Then it will be found that\nmany who have blessed the world with the light of genius and truth\nand holiness, owe the principles that were the mainspring of their\ninfluence and success to a praying, Christian mother.\nAt the court of Pharaoh, Moses received the highest civil and [245]\nmilitary training. The monarch had determined to make his adopted\n214 Patriarchs and Prophets\ngrandson his successor on the throne, and the youth was educated\nfor his high station. \u201cAnd Moses was learned in all the wisdom\nof the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.\u201d Acts\n7:22. His ability as a military leader made him a favorite with the\narmies of Egypt, and he was generally regarded as a remarkable\ncharacter. Satan had been defeated in his purpose. The very decree\ncondemning the Hebrew children to death had been overruled by\nGod for the training and education of the future leader of His people.\nThe elders of Israel were taught by angels that the time for their\ndeliverance was near, and that Moses was the man whom God would\nemploy to accomplish this work. Angels instructed Moses also that\nJehovah had chosen him to break the bondage of His people. He,\nsupposing that they were to obtain their freedom by force of arms,\nexpected to lead the Hebrew host against the armies of Egypt, and\nhaving this in view, he guarded his affections, lest in his attachment\nto his foster mother or to Pharaoh he would not be free to do the will\nof God.\nBy the laws of Egypt all who occupied the throne of the Pharaohs\nmust become members of the priestly caste; and Moses, as the\nheir apparent, was to be initiated into the mysteries of the national\nreligion. This duty was committed to the priests. But while he was\nan ardent and untiring student, he could not be induced to participate\nin the worship of the gods. He was threatened with the loss of\nthe crown, and warned that he would be disowned by the princess\nshould he persist in his adherence to the Hebrew faith. But he was\nunshaken in his determination to render homage to none save the\none God, the Maker of heaven and earth. He reasoned with priests\nand worshipers, showing the folly of their superstitious veneration\nof senseless objects. None could refute his arguments or change his\npurpose, yet for the time his firmness was tolerated on account of\nhis high position and the favor with which he was regarded by both\nthe king and the people.\n\u201cBy faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be\ncalled the son of Pharaoh\u2019s daughter; choosing rather to suffer afflic-\ntion with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for\na season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the[246]\ntreasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompense of the\nreward.\u201d Hebrews 11:24-26. Moses was fitted to take pre-eminence\nMoses 215\namong the great of the earth, to shine in the courts of its most glori-\nous kingdom, and to sway the scepter of its power. His intellectual\ngreatness distinguishes him above the great men of all ages. As his-\ntorian, poet, philosopher, general of armies, and legislator, he stands\nwithout a peer. Yet with the world before him, he had the moral\nstrength to refuse the flattering prospects of wealth and greatness\nand fame, \u201cchoosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of\nGod, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.\u201d\nMoses had been instructed in regard to the final reward to be\ngiven to the humble and obedient servants of God, and worldly gain\nsank to its proper insignificance in comparison. The magnificent\npalace of Pharaoh and the monarch\u2019s throne were held out as an\ninducement to Moses; but he knew that the sinful pleasures that\nmake men forget God were in its lordly courts. He looked beyond\nthe gorgeous palace, beyond a monarch\u2019s crown, to the high honors\nthat will be bestowed on the saints of the Most High in a kingdom\nuntainted by sin. He saw by faith an imperishable crown that the\nKing of heaven would place on the brow of the overcomer. This\nfaith led him to turn away from the lordly ones of earth and join the\nhumble, poor, despised nation that had chosen to obey God rather\nthan to serve sin.\nMoses remained at court until he was forty years of age. His\nthoughts often turned upon the abject condition of his people, and\nhe visited his brethren in their servitude, and encouraged them with\nthe assurance that God would work for their deliverance. Often,\nstung to resentment by the sight of injustice and oppression, he\nburned to avenge their wrongs. One day, while thus abroad, seeing\nan Egyptian smiting an Israelite, he sprang forward and slew the\nEgyptian. Except the Israelite, there had been no witness to the deed,\nand Moses immediately buried the body in the sand. He had now\nshown himself ready to maintain the cause of his people, and he\nhoped to see them rise to recover their liberty. \u201cHe supposed his\nbrethren would have understood how that God by his hand would\ndeliver them; but they understood not.\u201d Acts 7:25. They were not\nyet prepared for freedom. On the following day Moses saw two\nHebrews striving together, one of them evidently at fault. Moses [247]\nreproved the offender, who at once retaliated upon the reprover,\ndenying his right to interfere, and basely accusing him of crime:\n216 Patriarchs and Prophets\n\u201cWho made thee a prince and a judge over us?\u201d he said. \u201cIntendest\nthou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian?\u201d\nThe whole matter was quickly made known to the Egyptians,\nand, greatly exaggerated, soon reached the ears of Pharaoh. It\nwas represented to the king that this act meant much; that Moses\ndesigned to lead his people against the Egyptians, to overthrow the\ngovernment, and to seat himself upon the throne; and that there\ncould be no security for the kingdom while he lived. It was at once\ndetermined by the monarch that he should die; but, becoming aware\nof his danger, he made his escape and fled toward Arabia.\nThe Lord directed his course, and he found a home with Jethro,\nthe priest and prince of Midian, who was also a worshiper of God.\nAfter a time Moses married one of the daughters of Jethro; and\nhere, in the service of his father-in-law, as keeper of his flocks, he\nremained forty years.\nIn slaying the Egyptian, Moses had fallen into the same error so\noften committed by his fathers, of taking into their own hands the\nwork that God had promised to do. It was not God\u2019s will to deliver\nHis people by warfare, as Moses thought, but by His own mighty\npower, that the glory might be ascribed to Him alone. Yet even this\nrash act was overruled by God to accomplish His purposes. Moses\nwas not prepared for his great work. He had yet to learn the same\nlesson of faith that Abraham and Jacob had been taught\u2014not to rely\nupon human strength or wisdom, but upon the power of God for the\nfulfillment of His promises. And there were other lessons that, amid\nthe solitude of the mountains, Moses was to receive. In the school\nof self-denial and hardship he was to learn patience, to temper his\npassions. Before he could govern wisely, he must be trained to obey.\nHis own heart must be fully in harmony with God before he could\nteach the knowledge of His will to Israel. By his own experience he\nmust be prepared to exercise a fatherly care over all who needed his\nhelp.\nMan would have dispensed with that long period of toil and\nobscurity, deeming it a great loss of time. But Infinite Wisdom called\nhim who was to become the leader of his people to spend forty years[248]\nin the humble work of a shepherd. The habits of caretaking, of\nself-forgetfulness and tender solicitude for his flock, thus developed,\nwould prepare him to become the compassionate, longsuffering\nMoses 217\nshepherd of Israel. No advantage that human training or culture\ncould bestow, could be a substitute for this experience.\nMoses had been learning much that he must unlearn. The in-\nfluences that had surrounded him in Egypt\u2014the love of his foster\nmother, his own high position as the king\u2019s grandson, the dissipa-\ntion on every hand, the refinement, the subtlety, and the mysticism\nof a false religion, the splendor of idolatrous worship, the solemn\ngrandeur of architecture and sculpture\u2014all had left deep impres-\nsions upon his developing mind and had molded, to some extent, his\nhabits and character. Time, change of surroundings, and communion\nwith God could remove these impressions. It would require on the\npart of Moses himself a struggle as for life to renounce error and\naccept truth, but God would be his helper when the conflict should\nbe too severe for human strength.\nIn all who have been chosen to accomplish a work for God the\nhuman element is seen. Yet they have not been men of stereotyped\nhabits and character, who were satisfied to remain in that condition.\nThey earnestly desired to obtain wisdom from God and to learn to\nwork for Him. Says the apostle, \u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him\nask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and\nit shall be given him.\u201d James 1:5. But God will not impart to men\ndivine light while they are content to remain in darkness. In order to\nreceive God\u2019s help, man must realize his weakness and deficiency;\nhe must apply his own mind to the great change to be wrought in\nhimself; he must be aroused to earnest and persevering prayer and\neffort. Wrong habits and customs must be shaken off; and it is only\nby determined endeavor to correct these errors and to conform to\nright principles that the victory can be gained. Many never attain to\nthe position that they might occupy, because they wait for God to do\nfor them that which He has given them power to do for themselves.\nAll who are fitted for usefulness must be trained by the severest\nmental and moral discipline, and God will assist them by uniting\ndivine power with human effort.\nShut in by the bulwarks of the mountains, Moses was alone with [249]\n[250]\n[251]\nGod. The magnificent temples of Egypt no longer impressed his\nmind with their superstition and falsehood. In the solemn grandeur\nof the everlasting hills he beheld the majesty of the Most High, and\nin contrast realized how powerless and insignificant were the gods of\n218 Patriarchs and Prophets\nEgypt. Everywhere the Creator\u2019s name was written. Moses seemed\nto stand in His presence and to be over-shadowed by His power.\nHere his pride and self-sufficiency were swept away. In the stern\nsimplicity of his wilderness life, the results of the ease and luxury\nof Egypt disappeared. Moses became patient, reverent, and humble,\n\u201cvery meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth\u201d\n(Numbers 12:3), yet strong in faith in the mighty God of Jacob.\nAs the years rolled on, and he wandered with his flocks in solitary\nplaces, pondering upon the oppressed condition of his people, he\nrecounted the dealings of God with his fathers and the promises that\nwere the heritage of the chosen nation, and his prayers for Israel\nascended by day and by night. Heavenly angels shed their light\naround him. Here, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he wrote\nthe book of Genesis. The long years spent amid the desert solitudes\nwere rich in blessing, not alone to Moses and his people, but to the\nworld in all succeeding ages.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt\ndied: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage,\nand they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the\nbondage. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered\nHis covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. And God\nlooked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.\u201d\nThe time for Israel\u2019s deliverance had come. But God\u2019s purpose was\nto be accomplished in a manner to pour contempt on human pride.\nThe deliverer was to go forth as a humble shepherd, with only a\nrod in his hand; but God would make that rod the symbol of His\npower. Leading his flocks one day near Horeb, \u201cthe mountain of\nGod,\u201d Moses saw a bush in flames, branches, foliage, and trunk, all\nburning, yet seeming not to be consumed. He drew near to view\nthe wonderful sight, when a voice from out of the flame called him\nby name. With trembling lips he answered, \u201cHere am I.\u201d He was\nwarned not to approach irreverently: \u201cPut off thy shoes from off thy\nfeet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.... I am the\nGod of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the[252]\nGod of Jacob.\u201d It was He who, as the Angel of the covenant, had\nrevealed Himself to the fathers in ages past. \u201cAnd Moses hid his\nface; for he was afraid to look upon God.\u201d\nMoses 219\nHumility and reverence should characterize the deportment of\nall who come into the presence of God. In the name of Jesus we\nmay come before Him with confidence, but we must not approach\nHim with the boldness of presumption, as though He were on a\nlevel with ourselves. There are those who address the great and\nall-powerful and holy God, who dwelleth in light unapproachable,\nas they would address an equal, or even an inferior. There are those\nwho conduct themselves in His house as they would not presume\nto do in the audience chamber of an earthly ruler. These should\nremember that they are in His sight whom seraphim adore, before\nwhom angels veil their faces. God is greatly to be reverenced; all\nwho truly realize His presence will bow in humility before Him,\nand, like Jacob beholding the vision of God, they will cry out, \u201cHow\ndreadful is this place! This is none other but the house of God, and\nthis is the gate of heaven.\u201d\nAs Moses waited in reverent awe before God the words contin-\nued: \u201cI have surely seen the affliction of My people which are in\nEgypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I\nknow their sorrows; and I am come down to deliver them out of the\nhand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a\ngood land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey....\nCome now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou\nmayest bring forth My people the children of Israel out of Egypt.\u201d\nAmazed and terrified at the command, Moses drew back, saying,\n\u201cWho am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring\nforth the children of Israel out of Egypt?\u201d The reply was, \u201cCertainly\nI will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have\nsent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye\nshall serve God upon this mountain.\u201d\nMoses thought of the difficulties to be encountered, of the blind-\nness, ignorance, and unbelief of his people, many of whom were\nalmost destitute of a knowledge of God. \u201cBehold,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen\nI come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The [253]\nGod of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me,\nWhat is His name? what shall I say unto them?\u201d The answer was\u2014\n\u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d \u201cThus shalt thou say unto the children of\nIsrael, I AM hath sent me unto you.\u201d\n220 Patriarchs and Prophets\nMoses was commanded first to assemble the elders of Israel,\nthe most noble and righteous among them, who had long grieved\nbecause of their bondage, and to declare to them a message from\nGod, with a promise of deliverance. Then he was to go with the\nelders before the king, and say to him\u2014\n\u201cThe Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us\ngo, we beseech thee, three days\u2019 journey into the wilderness, that\nwe may sacrifice to the Lord our God.\u201d\nMoses was forewarned that Pharaoh would resist the appeal to\nlet Israel go. Yet the courage of God\u2019s servant must not fail; for the\nLord would make this the occasion to manifest His power before the\nEgyptians and before His people. \u201cAnd I will stretch out My hand,\nand smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in the midst\nthereof: and after that he will let you go.\u201d\nDirection was also given concerning the provision they were to\nmake for the journey. The Lord declared, \u201cIt shall come to pass, that,\nwhen ye go, ye shall not go empty: but every woman shall borrow\nof her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of\nsilver, and jewels of gold, and raiment.\u201d The Egyptians had been\nenriched by the labor unjustly exacted from the Israelites, and as the\nlatter were to start on the journey to their new home, it was right for\nthem to claim the reward of their years of toil. They were to ask for\narticles of value, such as could be easily transported, and God would\ngive them favor in the sight of the Egyptians. The mighty miracles\nwrought for their deliverance would strike terror to the oppressors,\nso that the requests of the bondmen would be granted.\nMoses saw before him difficulties that seemed insurmountable.\nWhat proof could he give his people that God had indeed sent him?\n\u201cBehold,\u201d he said, \u201cthey will not believe me, nor hearken unto my\nvoice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.\u201d\nEvidence that appealed to his own senses was now given. He was\ntold to cast his rod upon the ground. As he did so, \u201cit became a\nserpent; and Moses fled from before it.\u201d He was commanded to seize\nit, and in his hand it became a rod. He was bidden to put his hand[254]\ninto his bosom. He obeyed, and \u201cwhen he took it out, behold, his\nhand was leprous as snow.\u201d Being told to put it again into his bosom,\nhe found on withdrawing it that it had become like the other. By\nthese signs the Lord assured Moses that His own people, as well as\nMoses 221\nPharaoh, should be convinced that One mightier than the king of\nEgypt was manifest among them.\nBut the servant of God was still overwhelmed by the thought of\nthe strange and wonderful work before him. In his distress and fear\nhe now pleaded as an excuse a lack of ready speech: \u201cO my Lord,\nI am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since Thou hast spoken\nunto Thy servant; but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.\u201d\nHe had been so long away from the Egyptians that he had not so\nclear knowledge and ready use of their language as when he was\namong them.\nThe Lord said unto him, \u201cWho hath made man\u2019s mouth? or who\nmaketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the\nLord?\u201d To this was added another assurance of divine aid: \u201cNow\ntherefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou\nshalt say.\u201d But Moses still entreated that a more competent person\nbe selected. These excuses at first proceeded from humility and\ndiffidence; but after the Lord had promised to remove all difficulties,\nand to give him final success, then any further shrinking back and\ncomplaining of his unfitness showed distrust of God. It implied a\nfear that God was unable to qualify him for the great work to which\nHe had called him, or that He had made a mistake in the selection of\nthe man.\nMoses was now directed to Aaron, his elder brother, who, having\nbeen in daily use of the language of the Egyptians, was able to speak\nit perfectly. He was told that Aaron was coming to meet him. The\nnext words from the Lord were an unqualified command:\n\u201cThou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I\nwill be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what\nye shall do. And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he\nshall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt\nbe to him instead of God. And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand,\nwherewith thou shalt do signs.\u201d He could make no further resistance,\nfor all ground for excuse was removed.\nThe divine command given to Moses found him self-distrustful, [255]\nslow of speech, and timid. He was overwhelmed with a sense of\nhis incapacity to be a mouthpiece for God to Israel. But having\nonce accepted the work, he entered upon it with his whole heart,\nputting all his trust in the Lord. The greatness of his mission called\n222 Patriarchs and Prophets\ninto exercise the best powers of his mind. God blessed his ready\nobedience, and he became eloquent, hopeful, self-possessed, and\nwell fitted for the greatest work ever given to man. This is an example\nof what God does to strengthen the character of those who trust Him\nfully and give themselves unreservedly to His commands.\nA man will gain power and efficiency as he accepts the responsi-\nbilities that God places upon him, and with his whole soul seeks to\nqualify himself to bear them aright. However humble his position or\nlimited his ability, that man will attain true greatness who, trusting to\ndivine strength, seeks to perform his work with fidelity. Had Moses\nrelied upon his own strength and wisdom, and eagerly accepted the\ngreat charge, he would have evinced his entire unfitness for such\na work. The fact that a man feels his weakness is at least some\nevidence that he realizes the magnitude of the work appointed him,\nand that he will make God his counselor and his strength.\nMoses returned to his father-in-law and expressed his desire to\nvisit his brethren in Egypt. Jethro\u2019s consent was given, with his\nblessing, \u201cGo in peace.\u201d With his wife and children, Moses set forth\non the journey. He had not dared to make known the object of his\nmission, lest they should not be allowed to accompany him. Before\nreaching Egypt, however, he himself thought it best for their own\nsafety to send them back to the home in Midian.\nA secret dread of Pharaoh and the Egyptians, whose anger had\nbeen kindled against him forty years before, had rendered Moses\nstill more reluctant to return to Egypt; but after he had set out to\nobey the divine command, the Lord revealed to him that his enemies\nwere dead.\nOn the way from Midian, Moses received a startling and terrible\nwarning of the Lord\u2019s displeasure. An angel appeared to him in a\nthreatening manner, as if he would immediately destroy him. No\nexplanation was given; but Moses remembered that he had disre-\ngarded one of God\u2019s requirements; yielding to the persuasion of his[256]\nwife, he had neglected to perform the rite of circumcision upon their\nyoungest son. He had failed to comply with the condition by which\nhis child could be entitled to the blessings of God\u2019s covenant with\nIsrael; and such a neglect on the part of their chosen leader could not\nbut lessen the force of the divine precepts upon the people. Zipporah,\nfearing that her husband would be slain, performed the rite herself,\nMoses 223\nand the angel then permitted Moses to pursue his journey. In his\nmission to Pharaoh, Moses was to be placed in a position of great\nperil; his life could be preserved only through the protection of holy\nangels. But while living in neglect of a known duty, he would not be\nsecure; for he could not be shielded by the angels of God.\nIn the time of trouble just before the coming of Christ, the righ-\nteous will be preserved through the ministration of heavenly angels;\nbut there will be no security for the transgressor of God\u2019s law. An-\ngels cannot then protect those who are disregarding one of the divine\nprecepts.\nChapter 23\u2014The Plagues of Egypt[257]\nThis chapter is based on Exodus 5-10.\nAaron, being instructed by angels, went forth to meet his brother,\nfrom whom he had been so long separated; and they met amid the\ndesert solitudes, near Horeb. Here they communed together, and\nMoses told Aaron \u201call the words of the Lord who had sent him, and\nall the signs which He had commanded him.\u201d Exodus 4:28. Together\nthey journeyed to Egypt; and having reached the land of Goshen,\nthey proceeded to assemble the elders of Israel. Aaron repeated to\nthem all the dealings of God with Moses, and then the signs which\nGod had given Moses were shown before the people. \u201cThe people\nbelieved: and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children\nof Israel, and that He had looked upon their affliction, then they\nbowed their heads and worshiped.\u201d Verse 31.\nMoses had been charged also with a message for the king. The\ntwo brothers entered the palace of the Pharaohs as ambassadors from\nthe King of kings, and they spoke in His name: \u201cThus saith Jehovah,\nGod of Israel, Let My people go, that they may hold a feast unto Me\nin the wilderness.\u201d\n\u201cWho is Jehovah, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go?\u201d\ndemanded the monarch; \u201cI know not Jehovah, neither will I let Israel\ngo.\u201d\nTheir answer was, \u201cThe God of the Hebrews hath met with us:\nlet us go, we pray thee, three days\u2019 journey into the desert, and\nsacrifice unto the Lord our God; lest He fall upon us with pestilence,\nor with the sword.\u201d\nTidings of them and of the interest they were exciting among\nthe people had already reached the king. His anger was kindled.\n\u201cWherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let [hinder] the people from\ntheir works?\u201d he said. \u201cGet you unto your burdens.\u201d Already the\nkingdom had suffered loss by the interference of these strangers. At\nthought of this he added, \u201cBehold, the people of the land now are[258]\n224\nPlagues of Egypt 225\nmany, and ye make them rest from their burdens.\u201d\nIn their bondage the Israelites had to some extent lost the knowl-\nedge of God\u2019s law, and they had departed from its precepts. The\nSabbath had been generally disregarded, and the exactions of their\ntaskmasters made its observance apparently impossible. But Moses\nhad shown his people that obedience to God was the first condition\nof deliverance; and the efforts made to restore the observance of the\nSabbath had come to the notice of their oppressors. [See Appendix,\nnote 1.]\nThe king, thoroughly roused, suspected the Israelites of a design\nto revolt from his service. Disaffection was the result of idleness;\nhe would see that no time was left them for dangerous scheming.\nAnd he at once adopted measures to tighten their bonds and crush\nout their independent spirit. The same day orders were issued that\nrendered their labor still more cruel and oppressive. The most com-\nmon building material of that country was sun-dried brick; the walls\nof the finest edifices were made of this, and then faced with stone;\nand the manufacture of brick employed great numbers of the bond-\nmen. Cut straw being intermixed with the clay, to hold it together,\nlarge quantities of straw were required for the work; the king now\ndirected that no more straw be furnished; the laborers must find it\nfor themselves, while the same amount of brick should be exacted.\nThis order produced great distress among the Israelites through-\nout the land. The Egyptian taskmasters had appointed Hebrew\nofficers to oversee the work of the people, and these officers were re-\nsponsible for the labor performed by those under their charge. When\nthe requirement of the king was put in force, the people scattered\nthemselves throughout the land, to gather stubble instead of straw;\nbut they found it impossible to accomplish the usual amount of labor.\nFor this failure the Hebrew officers were cruelly beaten.\nThese officers supposed that their oppression came from their\ntaskmasters, and not from the king himself; and they went to him\nwith their grievances. Their remonstrance was met by Pharaoh with\na taunt: \u201cYe are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do\nsacrifice to the Lord.\u201d They were ordered back to their work, with\nthe declaration that their burdens were in no case to be lightened.\nReturning, they met Moses and Aaron, and cried out to them, \u201cThe\nLord look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savor to\n226 Patriarchs and Prophets\nbe abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants,\nto put a sword in their hand to slay us.\u201d\nAs Moses listened to these reproaches he was greatly distressed.[259]\nThe sufferings of the people had been much increased. All over the\nland a cry of despair went up from old and young, and all united\nin charging upon him the disastrous change in their condition. In\nbitterness of soul he went before God, with the cry, \u201cLord, wherefore\nhast Thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that Thou hast\nsent me? For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he hath\ndone evil to this people; neither hast Thou delivered Thy people at\nall.\u201d The answer was, \u201cNow shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh:\nfor with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand\nshall he drive them out of his land.\u201d Again he was pointed back to\nthe covenant which God had made with the fathers, and was assured\nthat it would be fulfilled.\nDuring all the years of servitude in Egypt there had been among\nthe Israelites some who adhered to the worship of Jehovah. These\nwere sorely troubled as they saw their children daily witnessing the\nabominations of the heathen, and even bowing down to their false\ngods. In their distress they cried unto the Lord for deliverance from\nthe Egyptian yoke, that they might be freed from the corrupting\ninfluence of idolatry. They did not conceal their faith, but declared\nto the Egyptians that the object of their worship was the Maker of\nheaven and earth, the only true and living God. They rehearsed the\nevidences of His existence and power, from creation down to the\ndays of Jacob. The Egyptians thus had an opportunity to become\nacquainted with the religion of the Hebrews; but disdaining to be\ninstructed by their slaves, they tried to seduce the worshipers of God\nby promises of reward, and, this failing, by threats and cruelty.\nThe elders of Israel endeavored to sustain the sinking faith of\ntheir brethren by repeating the promises made to their fathers, and\nthe prophetic words of Joseph before his death, foretelling their\ndeliverance from Egypt. Some would listen and believe. Others,\nlooking at the circumstances that surrounded them, refused to hope.\nThe Egyptians, being informed of what was reported among their\nbondmen, derided their expectations and scornfully denied the power\nof their God. They pointed to their situation as a nation of slaves,\nand tauntingly said, \u201cIf your God is just and merciful, and possesses\nPlagues of Egypt 227\npower above that of the Egyptian gods, why does He not make you\na free people?\u201d They called attention to their own condition. They\nworshiped deities termed by the Israelites false gods, yet they were a [260]\nrich and powerful nation. They declared that their gods had blessed\nthem with prosperity, and had given them the Israelites as servants,\nand they gloried in their power to oppress and destroy the worshipers\nof Jehovah. Pharaoh himself boasted that the God of the Hebrews\ncould not deliver them from his hand.\nWords like these destroyed the hopes of many of the Israelites.\nThe case appeared to them very much as the Egyptians had repre-\nsented. It was true that they were slaves, and must endure whatever\ntheir cruel taskmasters might choose to inflict. Their children had\nbeen hunted and slain, and their own lives were a burden. Yet they\nwere worshiping the God of heaven. If Jehovah were indeed above\nall gods, surely He would not thus leave them in bondage to idolaters.\nBut those who were true to God understood that it was because of\nIsrael\u2019s departure from Him\u2014because of their disposition to marry\nwith heathen nations, thus being led into idolatry\u2014that the Lord had\npermitted them to become bondmen; and they confidently assured\ntheir brethren that He would soon break the yoke of the oppressor.\nThe Hebrews had expected to obtain their freedom without any\nspecial trial of their faith or any real suffering or hardship. But\nthey were not yet prepared for deliverance. They had little faith in\nGod, and were unwilling patiently to endure their afflictions until\nHe should see fit to work for them. Many were content to remain\nin bondage rather than meet the difficulties attending removal to a\nstrange land; and the habits of some had become so much like those\nof the Egyptians that they preferred to dwell in Egypt. Therefore the\nLord did not deliver them by the first manifestation of His power\nbefore Pharaoh. He overruled events more fully to develop the\ntyrannical spirit of the Egyptian king and also to reveal Himself to\nHis people. Beholding His justice, His power, and His love, they\nwould choose to leave Egypt and give themselves to His service.\nThe task of Moses would have been much less difficult had not many\nof the Israelites become so corrupted that they were unwilling to\nleave Egypt.\nThe Lord directed Moses to go again to the people and repeat\nthe promise of deliverance, with a fresh assurance of divine favor.\n228 Patriarchs and Prophets\nHe went as he was commanded; but they would not listen. Says the\nScripture, \u201cThey hearkened not ... for anguish of spirit, and for cruel\nbondage.\u201d Again the divine message came to Moses, \u201cGo in, speak [261]\n[262]\n[263]\nunto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out\nof his land.\u201d In discouragement he replied, \u201cBehold, the children\nof Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear\nme?\u201d He was told to take Aaron with him and go before Pharaoh,\nand again demand \u201cthat he send the children of Israel out of his\nland.\u201d\nHe was informed that the monarch would not yield until God\nshould visit judgments upon Egypt and bring out Israel by the signal\nmanifestation of His power. Before the infliction of each plague,\nMoses was to describe its nature and effects, that the king might\nsave himself from it if he chose. Every punishment rejected would\nbe followed by one more severe, until his proud heart would be\nhumbled, and he would acknowledge the Maker of heaven and earth\nas the true and living God. The Lord would give the Egyptians\nan opportunity to see how vain was the wisdom of their mighty\nmen, how feeble the power of their gods, when opposed to the\ncommands of Jehovah. He would punish the people of Egypt for\ntheir idolatry and silence their boasting of the blessings received\nfrom their senseless deities. God would glorify His own name, that\nother nations might hear of His power and tremble at His mighty\nacts, and that His people might be led to turn from their idolatry and\nrender Him pure worship.\nAgain Moses and Aaron entered the lordly halls of the king of\nEgypt. There, surrounded by lofty columns and glittering adorn-\nments, by the rich paintings and sculptured images of heathen gods,\nbefore the monarch of the most powerful kingdom then in exis-\ntence, stood the two representatives of the enslaved race, to repeat\nthe command from God for Israel\u2019s release. The king demanded a\nmiracle, in evidence of their divine commission. Moses and Aaron\nhad been directed how to act in case such a demand should be made,\nand Aaron now took the rod and cast it down before Pharaoh. It\nbecame a serpent. The monarch sent for his \u201cwise men and the\nsorcerers,\u201d who \u201ccast down every man his rod and they became\nserpents: but Aaron\u2019s rod swallowed up their rods.\u201d Then the king,\nmore determined than before, declared his magicians equal in power\nPlagues of Egypt 229\nwith Moses and Aaron; he denounced the servants of the Lord as\nimpostors, and felt himself secure in resisting their demands. Yet\nwhile he despised their message, he was restrained by divine power\nfrom doing them harm.\nIt was the hand of God, and no human influence or power pos- [264]\nsessed by Moses and Aaron, that wrought the miracles which they\nshowed before Pharaoh. Those signs and wonders were designed to\nconvince Pharaoh that the great \u201cI AM\u201d had sent Moses, and that it\nwas the duty of the king to let Israel go, that they might serve the\nliving God. The magicians also showed signs and wonders; for they\nwrought not by their own skill alone, but by the power of their god,\nSatan, who assisted them in counterfeiting the work of Jehovah.\nThe magicians did not really cause their rods to become serpents;\nbut by magic, aided by the great deceiver, they were able to produce\nthis appearance. It was beyond the power of Satan to change the\nrods to living serpents. The prince of evil, though possessing all the\nwisdom and might of an angel fallen, has not power to create, or to\ngive life; this is the prerogative of God alone. But all that was in\nSatan\u2019s power to do, he did; he produced a counterfeit. To human\nsight the rods were changed to serpents. Such they were believed to\nbe by Pharaoh and his court. There was nothing in their appearance\nto distinguish them from the serpent produced by Moses. Though\nthe Lord caused the real serpent to swallow up the spurious ones, yet\neven this was regarded by Pharaoh, not as a work of God\u2019s power,\nbut as the result of a kind of magic superior to that of his servants.\nPharaoh desired to justify his stubbornness in resisting the divine\ncommand, and hence he was seeking some pretext for disregarding\nthe miracles that God had wrought through Moses. Satan gave\nhim just what he wanted. By the work that he wrought through\nthe magicians he made it appear to the Egyptians that Moses and\nAaron were only magicians and sorcerers, and that the message they\nbrought could not claim respect as coming from a superior being.\nThus Satan\u2019s counterfeit accomplished its purpose of emboldening\nthe Egyptians in their rebellion and causing Pharaoh to harden his\nheart against conviction. Satan hoped also to shake the faith of Moses\nand Aaron in the divine origin of their mission, that his instruments\nmight prevail. He was unwilling that the children of Israel should be\nreleased from bondage to serve the living God.\n230 Patriarchs and Prophets\nBut the prince of evil had a still deeper object in manifesting\nhis wonders through the magicians. He well knew that Moses, in\nbreaking the yoke of bondage from off the children of Israel, pre-\nfigured Christ, who was to break the reign of sin over the human[265]\nfamily. He knew that when Christ should appear, mighty miracles\nwould be wrought as an evidence to the world that God had sent\nHim. Satan trembled for his power. By counterfeiting the work of\nGod through Moses, he hoped not only to prevent the deliverance of\nIsrael, but to exert an influence through future ages to destroy faith\nin the miracles of Christ. Satan is constantly seeking to counterfeit\nthe work of Christ and to establish his own power and claims. He\nleads men to account for the miracles of Christ by making them\nappear to be the result of human skill and power. In many minds he\nthus destroys faith in Christ as the Son of God, and leads them to\nreject the gracious offers of mercy through the plan of redemption.\nMoses and Aaron were directed to visit the riverside next morn-\ning, where the king was accustomed to repair. The overflowing of\nthe Nile being the source of food and wealth for all Egypt, the river\nwas worshiped as a god, and the monarch came thither daily to pay\nhis devotions. Here the two brothers again repeated the message to\nhim, and then they stretched out the rod and smote upon the water.\nThe sacred stream ran blood, the fish died, and the river became\noffensive to the smell. The water in the houses, the supply preserved\nin cisterns, was likewise changed to blood. But \u201cthe magicians of\nEgypt did so with their enchantments,\u201d and \u201cPharaoh turned and\nwent into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.\u201d For\nseven days the plague continued, but without effect.\nAgain the rod was stretched out over the waters, and frogs came\nup from the river and spread over the land. They overran the houses,\ntook possession of the bed chambers, and even the ovens and knead-\ning troughs. The frog was regarded as sacred by the Egyptians,\nand they would not destroy it; but the slimy pests had now become\nintolerable. They swarmed even in the palace of the Pharaohs, and\nthe king was impatient to have them removed. The magicians had\nappeared to produce frogs, but they could not remove them. Upon\nseeing this, Pharaoh was somewhat humbled. He sent for Moses and\nAaron, and said, \u201cEntreat the Lord, that He may take away the frogs\nfrom me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they\nPlagues of Egypt 231\nmay do sacrifice unto the Lord.\u201d After reminding the king of his for-\nmer boasting, they requested him to appoint a time when they should\npray for the removal of the plague. He set the next day, secretly\nhoping that in the interval the frogs might disappear of themselves,\nand thus save him from the bitter humiliation of submitting to the [266]\nGod of Israel. The plague, however, continued till the time specified,\nwhen throughout all Egypt the frogs died, but their putrid bodies,\nwhich remained, polluted the atmosphere.\nThe Lord could have caused them to return to dust in a moment;\nbut He did not do this lest after their removal the king and his people\nshould pronounce it the result of sorcery or enchantment, like the\nwork of the magicians. The frogs died, and were then gathered\ntogether in heaps. Here the king and all Egypt had evidence which\ntheir vain philosophy could not gainsay, that this work was not\naccomplished by magic, but was a judgment from the God of heaven.\n\u201cWhen Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his\nheart.\u201d At the command of God, Aaron stretched out his hand, and\nthe dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.\nPharaoh called upon the magicians to do the same, but they could\nnot. The work of God was thus shown to be superior to that of\nSatan. The magicians themselves acknowledged, \u201cThis is the finger\nof God.\u201d But the king was still unmoved.\nAppeal and warning were ineffectual, and another judgment was\ninflicted. The time of its occurrence was foretold, that it might not\nbe said to have come by chance. Flies filled the houses and swarmed\nupon the ground, so that \u201cthe land was corrupted by reason of the\nswarms of flies.\u201d These flies were large and venomous, and their bite\nwas extremely painful to man and beast. As had been foretold, this\nvisitation did not extend to the land of Goshen.\nPharaoh now offered the Israelites permission to sacrifice in\nEgypt, but they refused to accept such conditions. \u201cIt is not meet,\u201d\nsaid Moses; \u201clo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians\nbefore their eyes, and will they not stone us?\u201d The animals which the\nHebrews would be required to sacrifice were among those regarded\nas sacred by the Egyptians; and such was the reverence in which\nthese creatures were held, that to slay one, even accidentally, was a\ncrime punishable with death. It would be impossible for the Hebrews\nto worship in Egypt without giving offense to their masters. Moses\n232 Patriarchs and Prophets\nagain proposed to go three days\u2019 journey into the wilderness. The\nmonarch consented, and begged the servants of God to entreat that\nthe plague might be removed. They promised to do this, but warned\nhim against dealing deceitfully with them. The plague was stayed,[267]\nbut the king\u2019s heart had become hardened by persistent rebellion,\nand he still refused to yield.\nA more terrible stroke followed\u2014murrain upon all the Egyptian\ncattle that were in the field. Both the sacred animals and the beasts\nof burden\u2014kine and oxen and sheep, horses and camels and asses\u2014\nwere destroyed. It had been distinctly stated that the Hebrews were\nto be exempt; and Pharaoh, on sending messengers to the home of\nthe Israelites, proved the truth of this declaration of Moses. \u201cOf\nthe cattle of the children of Israel died not one.\u201d Still the king was\nobstinate.\nMoses was next directed to take ashes of the furnace, and \u201csprin-\nkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.\u201d This act was deeply\nsignificant. Four hundred years before, God had shown to Abraham\nthe future oppression of His people, under the figure of a smoking\nfurnace and a burning lamp. He had declared that He would visit\njudgments upon their oppressors, and would bring forth the captives\nwith great substance. In Egypt, Israel had long languished in the\nfurnace of affliction. This act of Moses was an assurance to them\nthat God was mindful of His covenant, and that the time for their\ndeliverance had come.\nAs the ashes were sprinkled toward heaven, the fine particles\nspread over all the land of Egypt, and wherever they settled, pro-\nduced boils \u201cbreaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.\u201d\nThe priests and magicians had hitherto encouraged Pharaoh in his\nstubbornness, but now a judgment had come that reached even them.\nSmitten with a loathsome and painful disease, their vaunted power\nonly making them contemptible, they were no longer able to contend\nagainst the God of Israel. The whole nation was made to see the\nfolly of trusting in the magicians, when they were not able to protect\neven their own persons.\nStill the heart of Pharaoh grew harder. And now the Lord sent a\nmessage to him, declaring, \u201cI will at this time send all My plagues\nupon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou\nmayest know that there is none like Me in all the earth.... And in\nPlagues of Egypt 233\nvery deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to show in thee My\npower.\u201d Not that God had given him an existence for this purpose, but\nHis providence had overruled events to place him upon the throne\nat the very time appointed for Israel\u2019s deliverance. Though this\nhaughty tyrant had by his crimes forfeited the mercy of God, yet his [268]\nlife had been preserved that through his stubbornness the Lord might\nmanifest His wonders in the land of Egypt. The disposing of events\nis of God\u2019s providence. He could have placed upon the throne a more\nmerciful king, who would not have dared to withstand the mighty\nmanifestations of divine power. But in that case the Lord\u2019s purposes\nwould not have been accomplished. His people were permitted to\nexperience the grinding cruelty of the Egyptians, that they might not\nbe deceived concerning the debasing influence of idolatry. In His\ndealing with Pharaoh, the Lord manifested His hatred of idolatry\nand His determination to punish cruelty and oppression.\nGod had declared concerning Pharaoh, \u201cI will harden his heart,\nthat he shall not let the people go.\u201d Exodus 4:21. There was no\nexercise of supernatural power to harden the heart of the king. God\ngave to Pharaoh the most striking evidence of divine power, but\nthe monarch stubbornly refused to heed the light. Every display of\ninfinite power rejected by him, rendered him the more determined in\nhis rebellion. The seeds of rebellion that he sowed when he rejected\nthe first miracle, produced their harvest. As he continued to venture\non in his own course, going from one degree of stubbornness to\nanother, his heart became more and more hardened, until he was\ncalled to look upon the cold, dead faces of the first-born.\nGod speaks to men through His servants, giving cautions and\nwarnings, and rebuking sin. He gives to each an opportunity to\ncorrect his errors before they become fixed in the character; but\nif one refuses to be corrected, divine power does not interpose to\ncounteract the tendency of his own action. He finds it more easy\nto repeat the same course. He is hardening the heart against the\ninfluence of the Holy Spirit. A further rejection of light places him\nwhere a far stronger influence will be ineffectual to make an abiding\nimpression.\nHe who has once yielded to temptation will yield more readily\nthe second time. Every repetition of the sin lessens his power of\nresistance, blinds his eyes, and stifles conviction. Every seed of\n234 Patriarchs and Prophets\nindulgence sown will bear fruit. God works no miracle to prevent\nthe harvest. \u201cWhatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\u201d\nGalatians 6:7. He who manifests an infidel hardihood, a stolid\nindifference to divine truth, is but reaping the harvest of that which [269]\nhe has himself sown. It is thus that multitudes come to listen with\nstoical indifference to the truths that once stirred their very souls.\nThey sowed neglect and resistance to the truth, and such is the\nharvest which they reap.\nThose who are quieting a guilty conscience with the thought\nthat they can change a course of evil when they choose, that they\ncan trifle with the invitations of mercy, and yet be again and again\nimpressed, take this course at their peril. They think that after\ncasting all their influence on the side of the great rebel, in a moment\nof utmost extremity, when danger compasses them about, they will\nchange leaders. But this is not so easily done. The experience,\nthe education, the discipline of a life of sinful indulgence, has so\nthoroughly molded the character that they cannot then receive the\nimage of Jesus. Had no light shone upon their pathway, the case\nwould have been different. Mercy might interpose, and give them\nan opportunity to accept her overtures; but after light has been long\nrejected and despised, it will be finally withdrawn.\nA plague of hail was next threatened upon Pharaoh, with the\nwarning, \u201cSend therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that\nthou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be\nfound in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come\ndown upon them, and they shall die.\u201d Rain or hail was unusual in\nEgypt, and such a storm as was foretold had never been witnessed.\nThe report spread rapidly, and all who believed the word of the Lord\ngathered in their cattle, while those who despised the warning left\nthem in the field. Thus in the midst of judgment the mercy of God\nwas displayed, the people were tested, and it was shown how many\nhad been led to fear God by the manifestation of His power.\nThe storm came as predicted\u2014thunder and hail, and fire mingled\nwith it, \u201cvery grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land\nof Egypt since it became a nation. And the hail smote throughout all\nthe land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and\nthe hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the\nfield.\u201d Ruin and desolation marked the path of the destroying angel.\nPlagues of Egypt 235\nThe land of Goshen alone was spared. It was demonstrated to the\nEgyptians that the earth is under the control of the living God, that\nthe elements obey His voice, and that the only safety is in obedience\nto Him.\nAll Egypt trembled before the awful outpouring of divine judg- [270]\nment. Pharaoh hastily sent for the two brothers, and cried out, \u201cI\nhave sinned this time: the Lord is righteous, and I and my people\nare wicked. Entreat the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more\nmighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay\nno longer.\u201d The answer was, \u201cAs soon as I am gone out of the city, I\nwill spread abroad my hands unto the Lord; and the thunder shall\ncease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know\nhow that the earth is the Lord\u2019s. But as for thee and thy servants, I\nknow that ye will not yet fear the Lord God.\u201d\nMoses knew that the contest was not ended. Pharaoh\u2019s con-\nfessions and promises were not the effect of any radical change in\nhis mind or heart, but were wrung from him by terror and anguish.\nMoses promised, however, to grant his request; for he would give\nhim no occasion for further stubbornness. The prophet went forth,\nunheeding the fury of the tempest, and Pharaoh and all his host\nwere witnesses to the power of Jehovah to preserve His messenger.\nHaving passed without the city, Moses \u201cspread abroad his hands\nunto the Lord: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was\nnot poured upon the earth.\u201d But no sooner had the king recovered\nfrom his fears than his heart returned to its perversity.\nThen the Lord said unto Moses, \u201cGo in unto Pharaoh: for I have\nhardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might show\nthese My signs before him; and that thou mayest tell in the ears of\nthy son, and of thy son\u2019s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt,\nand My signs which I have done among them; that ye may know\nhow that I am Jehovah.\u201d The Lord was manifesting His power, to\nconfirm the faith of Israel in Him as the only true and living God.\nHe would give unmistakable evidence of the difference He placed\nbetween them and the Egyptians, and would cause all nations to\nknow that the Hebrews, whom they had despised and oppressed,\nwere under the protection of the God of heaven.\nMoses warned the monarch that if he still remained obstinate, a\nplague of locusts would be sent, which would cover the face of the\n236 Patriarchs and Prophets\nearth and eat up every green thing that remained; they would fill the\nhouses, even the palace itself; such a scourge, he said, as \u201cneither\nthy fathers, nor thy fathers\u2019 fathers have seen, since the day that they\nwere upon the earth unto this day.\u201d\nThe counselors of Pharaoh stood aghast. The nation had sus-[271]\ntained great loss in the death of their cattle. Many of the people\nhad been killed by the hail. The forests were broken down and the\ncrops destroyed. They were fast losing all that had been gained\nby the labor of the Hebrews. The whole land was threatened with\nstarvation. Princes and courtiers pressed about the king and angrily\ndemanded, \u201cHow long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men\ngo, that they may serve the Lord their God: knowest thou not yet\nthat Egypt is destroyed?\u201d\nMoses and Aaron were again summoned, and the monarch said\nto them, \u201cGo, serve the Lord your God: but who are they that shall\ngo?\u201d\nThe answer was, \u201cWe will go with our young and with our old,\nwith our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our\nherds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the Lord.\u201d\nThe king was filled with rage. \u201cLet the Lord be so with you,\u201d he\ncried, \u201cas I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil\nis before you. Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the Lord;\nfor that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh\u2019s\npresence.\u201d Pharaoh had endeavored to destroy the Israelites by hard\nlabor, but he now pretended to have a deep interest in their welfare\nand a tender care for their little ones. His real object was to keep the\nwomen and children as surety for the return of the men.\nMoses now stretched forth his rod over the land, and an east\nwind blew, and brought locusts. \u201cVery grievous were they; before\nthem there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be\nsuch.\u201d They filled the sky till the land was darkened, and devoured\nevery green thing remaining. Pharaoh sent for the prophets in haste,\nand said, \u201cI have sinned against the Lord your God, and against\nyou. Now therefore, forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and\nentreat the Lord your God, that He may take away from me this\ndeath only.\u201d They did so, and a strong west wind carried away the\nlocusts toward the Red Sea. Still the king persisted in his stubborn\nresolution.\nPlagues of Egypt 237\nThe people of Egypt were ready to despair. The scourges that\nhad already fallen upon them seemed almost beyond endurance,\nand they were filled with fear for the future. The nation had wor-\nshiped Pharaoh as a representative of their god, but many were now [272]\nconvinced that he was opposing himself to One who made all the\npowers of nature the ministers of His will. The Hebrew slaves,\nso miraculously favored, were becoming confident of deliverance.\nTheir taskmasters dared not oppress them as heretofore. Through-\nout Egypt there was a secret fear that the enslaved race would rise\nand avenge their wrongs. Everywhere men were asking with bated\nbreath, What will come next?\nSuddenly a darkness settled upon the land, so thick and black\nthat it seemed a \u201cdarkness which may be felt.\u201d Not only were the\npeople deprived of light, but the atmosphere was very oppressive,\nso that breathing was difficult. \u201cThey saw not one another, neither\nrose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel\nhad light in their dwellings.\u201d The sun and moon were objects of\nworship to the Egyptians; in this mysterious darkness the people\nand their gods alike were smitten by the power that had undertaken\nthe cause of the bondmen. [See Appendix, note 2.] Yet fearful\nas it was, this judgment is an evidence of God\u2019s compassion and\nHis unwillingness to destroy. He would give the people time for\nreflection and repentance before bringing upon them the last and\nmost terrible of the plagues.\nFear at last wrung from Pharaoh a further concession. At the end\nof the third day of darkness he summoned Moses, and consented\nto the departure of the people, provided the flocks and herds were\npermitted to remain. \u201cThere shall not an hoof be left behind,\u201d replied\nthe resolute Hebrew. \u201cWe know not with what we must serve the\nLord, until we come thither.\u201d The king\u2019s anger burst forth beyond\ncontrol. \u201cGet thee from me,\u201d he cried, \u201ctake heed to thyself, see my\nface no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.\u201d\nThe answer was, \u201cThou hast spoken well, I will see thy face\nagain no more.\u201d\n\u201cThe man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight\nof Pharaoh\u2019s servants, and in the sight of the people.\u201d Moses was\nregarded with awe by the Egyptians. The king dared not harm him,\nfor the people looked upon him as alone possessing power to remove\n238 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe plagues. They desired that the Israelites might be permitted to\nleave Egypt. It was the king and the priests that opposed to the last\nthe demands of Moses.\nChapter 24\u2014The Passover [273]\nThis chapter is based on Exodus 11; 12:1-32.\nWhen the demand for Israel\u2019s release had been first presented to\nthe king of Egypt, the warning of the most terrible of the plagues\nhad been given. Moses was directed to say to Pharaoh, \u201cThus saith\nthe Lord, Israel is My son, even My first-born: and I say unto thee,\nLet My son go, that he may serve Me: and if thou refuse to let him\ngo, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy first-born.\u201d Exodus 4:22, 23.\nThough despised by the Egyptians, the Israelites had been honored\nby God, in that they were singled out to be the depositaries of His\nlaw. In the special blessings and privileges accorded them, they had\npre-eminence among the nations, as the first-born son had among\nbrothers.\nThe judgment of which Egypt had first been warned, was to be\nthe last visited. God is long-suffering and plenteous in mercy. He\nhas a tender care for the beings formed in His image. If the loss\nof their harvests and their flocks and herds had brought Egypt to\nrepentance, the children would not have been smitten; but the nation\nhad stubbornly resisted the divine command, and now the final blow\nwas about to fall.\nMoses had been forbidden, on pain of death, to appear again in\nPharaoh\u2019s presence; but a last message from God was to be delivered\nto the rebellious monarch, and again Moses came before him, with\nthe terrible announcement: \u201cThus saith the Lord, About midnight\nwill I go out into the midst of Egypt: and all the first-born in the\nland of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth\nupon his throne, even unto the first-born of the maidservant that is\nbehind the mill; and all the first-born of beasts. And there shall be a\ngreat cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none\nlike it, nor shall be like it any more. But against any of the children\nof Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that\nye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference between the [274]\n239\n240 Patriarchs and Prophets\nEgyptians and Israel. And all these thy servants shall come down\nunto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out,\nand all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out.\u201d\nBefore the execution of this sentence the Lord through Moses\ngave direction to the children of Israel concerning their departure\nfrom Egypt, and especially for their preservation from the coming\njudgment. Each family, alone or in connection with others, was to\nslay a lamb or a kid \u201cwithout blemish,\u201d and with a bunch of hyssop\nsprinkle its blood on \u201cthe two side posts and on the upper doorpost\u201d\nof the house, that the destroying angel, coming at midnight, might\nnot enter that dwelling. They were to eat the flesh roasted, with\nunleavened bread and bitter herbs, at night, as Moses said, \u201cwith\nyour loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your\nhand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the Lord\u2019s Passover.\u201d\nThe Lord declared: \u201cI will pass through the land of Egypt this\nnight, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both\nman and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute\njudgment.... And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the\nhouses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you,\nand the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite\nthe land of Egypt.\u201d\nIn commemoration of this great deliverance a feast was to be\nobserved yearly by the people of Israel in all future generations.\n\u201cThis day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a\nfeast to the Lord throughout your generations: ye shall keep it a feast\nby an ordinance forever.\u201d As they should keep the feast in future\nyears, they were to repeat to their children the story of this great\ndeliverance, as Moses bade them: \u201cYe shall say, It is the sacrifice\nof the Lord\u2019s Passover, who passed over the houses of the children\nof Israel in Egypt, when He smote the Egyptians, and delivered our\nhouses.\u201d\nFurthermore, the first-born of both man and beast were to be the\nLord\u2019s, to be bought back only by a ransom, in acknowledgment\nthat when the first-born in Egypt perished, that of Israel, though\ngraciously preserved, had been justly exposed to the same doom\nbut for the atoning sacrifice. \u201cAll the first-born are Mine,\u201d the Lord\ndeclared; \u201cfor on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land[275]\n[276]\n[277]\nof Egypt, I hallowed unto Me all the first-born in Israel, both man\nPassover 241\nand beast: Mine they shall be,\u201d Numbers 3:13. After the institution\nof the tabernacle service the Lord chose unto Himself the tribe of\nLevi for the work of the sanctuary, instead of the first-born of the\npeople. \u201cThey are wholly given unto Me from among the children\nof Israel,\u201d He said. \u201cInstead of the first-born of all the children of\nIsrael, have I taken them unto Me.\u201d Numbers 8:16. All the people\nwere, however, still required, in acknowledgment of God\u2019s mercy,\nto pay a redemption price for the first-born son. Numbers 18:15, 16.\nThe Passover was to be both commemorative and typical, not\nonly pointing back to the deliverance from Egypt, but forward to\nthe greater deliverance which Christ was to accomplish in freeing\nHis people from the bondage of sin. The sacrificial lamb represents\n\u201cthe Lamb of God,\u201d in whom is our only hope of salvation. Says the\napostle, \u201cChrist our Passover is sacrificed for us.\u201d 1 Corinthians 5:7.\nIt was not enough that the paschal lamb be slain; its blood must be\nsprinkled upon the doorposts; so the merits of Christ\u2019s blood must\nbe applied to the soul. We must believe, not only that He died for\nthe world, but that He died for us individually. We must appropriate\nto ourselves the virtue of the atoning sacrifice.\nThe hyssop used in sprinkling the blood was the symbol of\npurification, being thus employed in the cleansing of the leper and\nof those defiled by contact with the dead. In the psalmist\u2019s prayer\nalso its significance is seen: \u201cPurge me with hyssop, and I shall be\nclean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\u201d Psalm 51:7.\nThe lamb was to be prepared whole, not a bone of it being broken:\nso not a bone was to be broken of the Lamb of God, who was to die\nfor us. John 19:36. Thus was also represented the completeness of\nChrist\u2019s sacrifice.\nThe flesh was to be eaten. It is not enough even that we believe\non Christ for the forgiveness of sin; we must by faith be constantly\nreceiving spiritual strength and nourishment from Him through His\nword. Said Christ, \u201cExcept ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and\ndrink His blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth My flesh,\nand drinketh My blood, hath eternal life.\u201d John 6:53, 54. And to\nexplain His meaning He said, \u201cThe words that I speak unto you,\nthey are spirit, and they are life.\u201d Verse 63. Jesus accepted His [278]\nFather\u2019s law, wrought out its principles in His life, manifested its\nspirit, and showed its beneficent power in the heart. Says John, \u201cThe\n242 Patriarchs and Prophets\nWord was made flesh and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory,\nthe glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and\ntruth.\u201d John 1:14. The followers of Christ must be partakers of His\nexperience. They must receive and assimilate the word of God so\nthat it shall become the motive power of life and action. By the\npower of Christ they must be changed into His likeness, and reflect\nthe divine attributes. They must eat the flesh and drink the blood of\nthe Son of God, or there is no life in them. The spirit and work of\nChrist must become the spirit and work of His disciples.\nThe lamb was to be eaten with bitter herbs, as pointing back to\nthe bitterness of the bondage in Egypt. So when we feed upon Christ,\nit should be with contrition of heart, because of our sins. The use\nof unleavened bread also was significant. It was expressly enjoined\nin the law of the Passover, and as strictly observed by the Jews in\ntheir practice, that no leaven should be found in their houses during\nthe feast. In like manner the leaven of sin must be put away from all\nwho would receive life and nourishment from Christ. So Paul writes\nto the Corinthian church, \u201cPurge out therefore the old leaven, that\nye may be a new lump.... For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed\nfor us: therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither\nwith the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened\nbread of sincerity and truth.\u201d 1 Corinthians 5:7, 8.\nBefore obtaining freedom, the bondmen must show their faith in\nthe great deliverance about to be accomplished. The token of blood\nmust be placed upon their houses, and they must separate themselves\nand their families from the Egyptians, and gather within their own\ndwellings. Had the Israelites disregarded in any particular the di-\nrections given them, had they neglected to separate their children\nfrom the Egyptians, had they slain the lamb, but failed to strike the\ndoorpost with blood, or had any gone out of their houses, they would\nnot have been secure. They might have honestly believed that they\nhad done all that was necessary, but their sincerity would not have\nsaved them. All who failed to heed the Lord\u2019s directions would lose\ntheir first-born by the hand of the destroyer.\nBy obedience the people were to give evidence of their faith. So[279]\nall who hope to be saved by the merits of the blood of Christ should\nrealize that they themselves have something to do in securing their\nsalvation. While it is Christ only that can redeem us from the penalty\nPassover 243\nof transgression, we are to turn from sin to obedience. Man is to\nbe saved by faith, not by works; yet his faith must be shown by his\nworks. God has given His Son to die as a propitiation for sin, He has\nmanifested the light of truth, the way of life, He has given facilities,\nordinances, and privileges; and now man must co-operate with these\nsaving agencies; he must appreciate and use the helps that God has\nprovided\u2014believe and obey all the divine requirements.\nAs Moses rehearsed to Israel the provisions of God for their\ndeliverance, \u201cthe people bowed the head and worshiped.\u201d The glad\nhope of freedom, the awful knowledge of the impending judgment\nupon their oppressors, the cares and labors incident to their speedy\ndeparture\u2014all were for the time swallowed up in gratitude to their\ngracious Deliverer. Many of the Egyptians had been led to acknowl-\nedge the God of the Hebrews as the only true God, and these now\nbegged to be permitted to find shelter in the homes of Israel when\nthe destroying angel should pass through the land. They were gladly\nwelcomed, and they pledged themselves henceforth to serve the God\nof Jacob and to go forth from Egypt with His people.\nThe Israelites obeyed the directions that God had given. Swiftly\nand secretly they made their preparations for departure. Their fam-\nilies were gathered, the paschal lamb slain, the flesh roasted with\nfire, the unleavened bread and bitter herbs prepared. The father\nand priest of the household sprinkled the blood upon the doorpost,\nand joined his family within the dwelling. In haste and silence the\npaschal lamb was eaten. In awe the people prayed and watched, the\nheart of the eldest born, from the strong man down to the little child,\nthrobbing with indefinable dread. Fathers and mothers clasped in\ntheir arms their loved first-born as they thought of the fearful stroke\nthat was to fall that night. But no dwelling of Israel was visited by\nthe death-dealing angel. The sign of blood\u2014the sign of a Saviour\u2019s\nprotection\u2014was on their doors, and the destroyer entered not.\nAt midnight \u201cthere was a great cry in Egypt: for there was not [280]\na house where there was not one dead.\u201d All the first-born in the\nland, \u201cfrom the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto\nthe firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the\nfirstborn of cattle\u201d had been smitten by the destroyer. Throughout\nthe vast realm of Egypt the pride of every household had been laid\nlow. The shrieks and wails of the mourners filled the air. King and\n244 Patriarchs and Prophets\ncourtiers, with blanched faces and trembling limbs, stood aghast at\nthe overmastering horror. Pharaoh remembered how he had once\nexclaimed, \u201cWho is Jehovah, that I should obey His voice to let\nIsrael go? I know not Jehovah, neither will I let Israel go.\u201d Now, his\nheaven-daring pride humbled in the dust, he \u201ccalled for Moses and\nAaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my\npeople, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the Lord,\nas ye have said. Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have\nsaid.... And be gone; and bless me also.\u201d The royal counselors also\nand the people entreated the Israelites to depart \u201cout of the land in\nhaste; for they said, We be all dead men.\u201d\nChapter 25\u2014The Exodus [281]\nThis chapter is based on Exodus 12:34-51; 13-15.\nWith their loins girt, with sandaled feet, and staff in hand, the\npeople of Israel had stood, hushed, awed, yet expectant, awaiting\nthe royal mandate that should bid them go forth. Before the morning\nbroke, they were on their way. During the plagues, as the manifesta-\ntion of God\u2019s power had kindled faith in the hearts of the bondmen\nand had struck terror to their oppressors, the Israelites had gradually\nassembled themselves in Goshen; and notwithstanding the sudden-\nness of their flight, some provision had already been made for the\nnecessary organization and control of the moving multitudes, they\nbeing divided into companies, under appointed leaders.\nAnd they went out, \u201cabout six hundred thousand on foot that\nwere men, beside children. And a mixed multitude went up also with\nthem.\u201d In this multitude were not only those who were actuated by\nfaith in the God of Israel, but also a far greater number who desired\nonly to escape from the plagues, or who followed in the wake of the\nmoving multitudes merely from excitement and curiosity. This class\nwere ever a hindrance and a snare to Israel.\nThe people took also with them \u201cflocks, and herds, even very\nmuch cattle.\u201d These were the property of the Israelites, who had\nnever sold their possessions to the king, as had the Egyptians. Jacob\nand his sons had brought their flocks and herds with them to Egypt,\nwhere they had greatly increased. Before leaving Egypt, the people,\nby the direction of Moses, claimed a recompense for their unpaid\nlabor; and the Egyptians were too eager to be freed from their\npresence to refuse them. The bondmen went forth laden with the\nspoil of their oppressors.\nThat day completed the history revealed to Abraham in prophetic\nvision centuries before: \u201cThy seed shall be a stranger in a land that\nis not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four\nhundred years; and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will [282]\n245\n246 Patriarchs and Prophets\nI judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.\u201d\nGenesis 15:13, 14. [See Appendix, note 3.] The four hundred years\nhad been fulfilled. \u201cAnd it came to pass the selfsame day, that the\nLord did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their\narmies.\u201d In their departure from Egypt the Israelites bore with them\na precious legacy, in the bones of Joseph, which had so long awaited\nthe fulfillment of God\u2019s promise, and which, during the dark years\nof bondage, had been a reminder of Israel\u2019s deliverance.\nInstead of pursuing the direct route to Canaan, which lay through\nthe country of the Philistines, the Lord directed their course south-\nward, toward the shores of the Red Sea. \u201cFor God said, Lest per-\nadventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to\nEgypt.\u201d Had they attempted to pass through Philistia, their progress\nwould have been opposed; for the Philistines, regarding them as\nslaves escaping from their masters, would not have hesitated to\nmake war upon them. The Israelites were poorly prepared for an\nencounter with that powerful and warlike people. They had little\nknowledge of God and little faith in Him, and they would have\nbecome terrified and disheartened. They were unarmed and unaccus-\ntomed to war, their spirits were depressed by long bondage, and they\nwere encumbered with women and children, flocks and herds. In\nleading them by the way of the Red Sea, the Lord revealed Himself\nas a God of compassion as well as of judgment.\n\u201cAnd they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in\nEtham, in the edge of the wilderness. And the Lord went before\nthem by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night\nin a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night. He took\nnot away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night,\nfrom before the people.\u201d Says the psalmist, \u201cHe spread a cloud for\na covering; and fire to give light in the night.\u201d Psalm 105:39. See\nalso 1 Corinthians 10:1, 2. The standard of their invisible Leader\nwas ever with them. By day the cloud directed their journeyings or\nspread as a canopy above the host. It served as a protection from\nthe burning heat, and by its coolness and moisture afforded grateful\nrefreshment in the parched, thirsty desert. By night it became a pillar\nof fire, illuminating their encampment and constantly assuring them\nof the divine presence.\nIn one of the most beautiful and comforting passages of Isaiah\u2019s[283]\nExodus 247\nprophecy, reference is made to the pillar of cloud and of fire to\nrepresent God\u2019s care for His people in the great final struggle with\nthe powers of evil: \u201cThe Lord will create upon every dwelling place\nof Mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day,\nand the shining of a flaming fire by night: for above all the glory\nshall be a covering. And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in\nthe daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert\nfrom storm and from rain.\u201d Isaiah 4:5, 6, margin.\nAcross a dreary, desertlike expanse they journeyed. Already\nthey began to wonder whither their course would lead; they were\nbecoming weary with the toilsome way, and in some hearts began to\narise a fear of pursuit by the Egyptians. But the cloud went forward,\nand they followed. And now the Lord directed Moses to turn aside\ninto a rocky defile, and encamp beside the sea. It was revealed to\nhim that Pharaoh would pursue them, but that God would be honored\nin their deliverance.\nIn Egypt the report was spread that the children of Israel, instead\nof tarrying to worship in the desert, were pressing on toward the Red\nSea. Pharaoh\u2019s counselors declared to the king that their bondmen\nhad fled, never to return. The people deplored their folly in attribut-\ning the death of the first-born to the power of God. Their great men,\nrecovering from their fears, accounted for the plagues as the result\nof natural causes. \u201cWhy have we done this, that we have let Israel\ngo from serving us?\u201d was the bitter cry.\nPharaoh collected his forces, \u201csix hundred chosen chariots, and\nall the chariots of Egypt,\u201d horsemen, captains, and foot soldiers. The\nking himself, attended by the great men of his realm, headed the\nattacking army. To secure the favor of the gods, and thus ensure the\nsuccess of their undertaking, the priests also accompanied them. The\nking was resolved to intimidate the Israelites by a grand display of\nhis power. The Egyptians feared lest their forced submission to the\nGod of Israel should subject them to the derision of other nations;\nbut if they should now go forth with a great show of power and bring\nback the fugitives, they would redeem their glory, as well as recover\nthe services of their bondmen.\nThe Hebrews were encamped beside the sea, whose waters\npresented a seemingly impassable barrier before them, while on [284]\nthe south a rugged mountain obstructed their further progress. Sud-\n248 Patriarchs and Prophets\ndenly they beheld in the distance the flashing armor and moving\nchariots betokening the advance guard of a great army. As the force\ndrew nearer, the hosts of Egypt were seen in full pursuit. Terror filled\nthe hearts of Israel. Some cried unto the Lord, but far the greater\npart hastened to Moses with their complaints: \u201cBecause there were\nno graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness?\nwherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?\nIs not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us\nalone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for\nus to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.\u201d\nMoses was greatly troubled that his people should manifest so\nlittle faith in God, notwithstanding they had repeatedly witnessed the\nmanifestation of His power in their behalf. How could they charge\nupon him the dangers and difficulties of their situation, when he\nhad followed the express command of God? True, there was no\npossibility of deliverance unless God Himself should interpose for\ntheir release; but having been brought into this position in obedience\nto the divine direction, Moses felt no fear of the consequences. His\ncalm and assuring reply to the people was, \u201cFear ye not, stand still,\nand see the salvation of the Lord, which He will show to you today:\nfor the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again\nno more forever. The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your\npeace.\u201d\nIt was not an easy thing to hold the hosts of Israel in waiting\nbefore the Lord. Lacking discipline and self-control, they became\nviolent and unreasonable. They expected speedily to fall into the\nhands of their oppressors, and their wailings and lamentations were\nloud and deep. The wonderful pillar of cloud had been followed as\nthe signal of God to go forward; but now they questioned among\nthemselves if it might not foreshadow some great calamity; for had it\nnot led them on the wrong side of the mountain, into an impassable\nway? Thus the angel of God appeared to their deluded minds as the\nharbinger of disaster.\nBut now, as the Egyptian host approached them, expecting to\nmake them an easy prey, the cloudy column rose majestically into\nthe heavens, passed over the Israelites, and descended between them\nand the armies of Egypt. A wall of darkness interposed between[285]\n[286]\n[287]\nthe pursued and their pursuers. The Egyptians could no longer\nExodus 249\ndiscern the camp of the Hebrews, and were forced to halt. But as the\ndarkness of night deepened, the wall of cloud became a great light\nto the Hebrews, flooding the entire encampment with the radiance\nof day.\nThen hope returned to the hearts of Israel. And Moses lifted up\nhis voice unto the Lord. \u201cAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore\ncriest thou unto Me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go\nforward. But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the\nsea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground\nthrough the midst of the sea.\u201d\nThe psalmist, describing the passage of the sea by Israel, sang,\n\u201cThy way was in the sea, and Thy paths in the great waters, and\nThy footsteps were not known. Thou leddest Thy people like a\nflock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.\u201d Psalm 77:19, 20, R.V . As\nMoses stretched out his rod the waters parted, and Israel went into\nthe midst of the sea, upon dry ground, while the waters stood like a\nwall upon each side. The light from God\u2019s pillar of fire shone upon\nthe foam-capped billows, and lighted the road that was cut like a\nmighty furrow through the waters of the sea, and was lost in the\nobscurity of the farther shore.\n\u201cThe Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of\nthe sea, even all Pharaoh\u2019s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.\nAnd it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked\nunto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the\ncloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians.\u201d The mysterious cloud\nchanged to a pillar of fire before their astonished eyes. The thunders\npealed and the lightnings flashed. \u201cThe clouds poured out water; the\nskies sent out a sound: Thine arrows also went abroad. The voice of\nThy thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightning lightened the world:\nthe earth trembled and shook.\u201d Psalm 77:17, 18, R.V .\nThe Egyptians were seized with confusion and dismay. Amid\nthe wrath of the elements, in which they heard the voice of an angry\nGod, they endeavored to retrace their steps and flee to the shore\nthey had quitted. But Moses stretched out his rod, and the piled-up\nwaters, hissing, roaring, and eager for their prey, rushed together\nand swallowed the Egyptian army in their black depths.\nAs morning broke it revealed to the multitudes of Israel all that\nremained of their mighty foes\u2014the mail-clad bodies cast upon the [288]\n250 Patriarchs and Prophets\nshore. From the most terrible peril, one night had brought complete\ndeliverance. That vast, helpless throng\u2014bondmen unused to battle,\nwomen, children, and cattle, with the sea before them, and the\nmighty armies of Egypt pressing behind\u2014had seen their path opened\nthrough the waters and their enemies overwhelmed in the moment of\nexpected triumph. Jehovah alone had brought them deliverance, and\nto Him their hearts were turned in gratitude and faith. Their emotion\nfound utterance in songs of praise. The Spirit of God rested upon\nMoses, and he led the people in a triumphant anthem of thanksgiving,\nthe earliest and one of the most sublime that are known to man.\n\u201cI will sing unto Jehovah, for He hath triumphed gloriously;\nThe horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.\nThe Lord is my strength and my song,\nAnd He is become my salvation:\nThis is my God, and I will praise Him;\nMy father\u2019s God, and I will exalt Him.\nThe Lord is a man of war:\nJehovah is His name. Pharaoh\u2019s chariots and his host hath\nHe cast into the sea:\nAnd his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.\nThe deeps cover them:\nThey went down into the depths like a stone.\nThy right hand, O Lord, is glorious in power,\nThy right hand, O Lord, dasheth in pieces the enemy....\nWho is like unto Thee, O Lord, among the gods?\nWho is like Thee, glorious in holiness,\nFearful in praises, doing wonders? ...\nThou in Thy mercy hast led the people which Thou has redeemed:\nThou hast guided them in Thy strength to Thy holy habitation.\nThe peoples have heard, they tremble....\nTerror and dread falleth upon them;\nBy the greatness of Thine arm they are as still as a stone;\nTill Thy people pass over, O Lord,\nTill the people pass over which Thou hast purchased.\nThou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of\nExodus 251\nThine inheritance,\nThe place, O Lord, which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell\nin.\u201d\nExodus 15:1-16, R.V .\nLike the voice of the great deep, rose from the vast hosts of Israel\nthat sublime ascription. It was taken up by the women of Israel,\nMiriam, the sister of Moses, leading the way, as they went forth with [289]\ntimbrel and dance. Far over desert and sea rang the joyous refrain,\nand the mountains re-echoed the words of their praise\u2014\u201cSing ye to\nJehovah, for He hath triumphed gloriously.\u201d\nThis song and the great deliverance which it commemorates,\nmade an impression never to be effaced from the memory of the\nHebrew people. From age to age it was echoed by the prophets\nand singers of Israel, testifying that Jehovah is the strength and\ndeliverance of those who trust in Him. That song does not belong\nto the Jewish people alone. It points forward to the destruction of\nall the foes of righteousness and the final victory of the Israel of\nGod. The prophet of Patmos beholds the white-robed multitude that\nhave \u201cgotten the victory,\u201d standing on the \u201csea of glass mingled with\nfire,\u201d having \u201cthe harps of God. And they sing the song of Moses\nthe servant of God, and the song of the Lamb.\u201d Revelation 15:2, 3.\n\u201cNot unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Thy name give glory,\nfor Thy mercy, and for Thy truth\u2019s sake.\u201d Psalm 115:1. Such was\nthe spirit that pervaded Israel\u2019s song of deliverance, and it is the\nspirit that should dwell in the hearts of all who love and fear God. In\nfreeing our souls from the bondage of sin, God has wrought for us a\ndeliverance greater than that of the Hebrews at the Red Sea. Like\nthe Hebrew host, we should praise the Lord with heart and soul and\nvoice for His \u201cwonderful works to the children of men.\u201d Those who\ndwell upon God\u2019s great mercies, and are not unmindful of His lesser\ngifts, will put on the girdle of gladness and make melody in their\nhearts to the Lord. The daily blessings that we receive from the hand\nof God, and above all else the death of Jesus to bring happiness and\nheaven within our reach, should be a theme for constant gratitude.\nWhat compassion, what matchless love, has God shown to us, lost\nsinners, in connecting us with Himself, to be to Him a peculiar\ntreasure! What a sacrifice has been made by our Redeemer, that we\n252 Patriarchs and Prophets\nmay be called children of God! We should praise God for the blessed\nhope held out before us in the great plan of redemption, we should\npraise Him for the heavenly inheritance and for His rich promises;\npraise Him that Jesus lives to intercede for us.\n\u201cWhoso offereth praise,\u201d says the Creator, \u201cglorifieth Me.\u201d Psalm\n50:23. All the inhabitants of heaven unite in praising God. Let us\nlearn the song of the angels now, that we may sing it when we join\ntheir shining ranks. Let us say with the psalmist, \u201cWhile I live will I[290]\npraise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any\nbeing.\u201d \u201cLet the people praise Thee, O God; let all the people praise\nThee.\u201d Psalm 146:2; 67:5.\nGod in His providence brought the Hebrews into the mountain\nfastnesses before the sea, that He might manifest His power in their\ndeliverance and signally humble the pride of their oppressors. He\nmight have saved them in any other way, but He chose this method in\norder to test their faith and strengthen their trust in Him. The people\nwere weary and terrified, yet if they had held back when Moses bade\nthem advance, God would never have opened the path for them. It\nwas \u201cby faith\u201d that \u201cthey passed through the Red Sea as by dry land.\u201d\nHebrews 11:29. In marching down to the very water, they showed\nthat they believed the word of God as spoken by Moses. They did\nall that was in their power to do, and then the Mighty One of Israel\ndivided the sea to make a path for their feet.\nThe great lesson here taught is for all time. Often the Christian\nlife is beset by dangers, and duty seems hard to perform. The imagi-\nnation pictures impending ruin before and bondage or death behind.\nYet the voice of God speaks clearly, \u201cGo forward.\u201d We should obey\nthis command, even though our eyes cannot penetrate the darkness,\nand we feel the cold waves about our feet. The obstacles that hinder\nour progress will never disappear before a halting, doubting spirit.\nThose who defer obedience till every shadow of uncertainty dis-\nappears and there remains no risk of failure or defeat, will never\nobey at all. Unbelief whispers, \u201cLet us wait till the obstructions are\nremoved, and we can see our way clearly;\u201d but faith courageously\nurges an advance, hoping all things, believing all things.\nThe cloud that was a wall of darkness to the Egyptians was to\nthe Hebrews a great flood of light, illuminating the whole camp, and\nshedding brightness upon the path before them. So the dealings of\nExodus 253\nProvidence bring to the unbelieving, darkness and despair, while to\nthe trusting soul they are full of light and peace. The path where\nGod leads the way may lie through the desert or the sea, but it is a\nsafe path.\nChapter 26\u2014From the Red Sea to Sinai[291]\nThis chapter is based on Exodus 15:22-27; 16 to 18.\nFrom the Red Sea the hosts of Israel again set forth on their\njourney, under the guidance of the pillar of cloud. The scene around\nthem was most dreary\u2014bare, desolate-looking mountains, barren\nplains, and the sea stretching far away, its shores strewn with the\nbodies of their enemies; yet they were full of joy in the consciousness\nof freedom, and every thought of discontent was hushed.\nBut for three days, as they journeyed, they could find no water.\nThe supply which they had taken with them was exhausted. There\nwas nothing to quench their burning thirst as they dragged wearily\nover the sun-burnt plains. Moses, who was familiar with this region,\nknew what the others did not, that at Marah, the nearest station where\nsprings were to be found, the water was unfit for use. With intense\nanxiety he watched the guiding cloud. With a sinking heart he heard\nthe glad shout. \u201cWater! water!\u201d echoed along the line. Men, women,\nand children in joyous haste crowded to the fountain, when, lo, a cry\nof anguish burst forth from the host\u2014the water was bitter.\nIn their horror and despair they reproached Moses for having led\nthem in such a way, not remembering that the divine presence in that\nmysterious cloud had been leading him as well as them. In his grief\nat their distress Moses did what they had forgotten to do; he cried\nearnestly to God for help. \u201cAnd the Lord showed him a tree, which\nwhen he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet.\u201d\nHere the promise was given to Israel through Moses, \u201cIf thou wilt\ndiligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that\nwhich is right in His sight, and wilt give ear to His commandments,\nand keep all His statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee,\nwhich I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that[292]\nhealeth thee.\u201d\nFrom Marah the people journeyed to Elim, where they found\n\u201ctwelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees.\u201d Here\n254\nFrom the Red Sea to Sinai 255\nthey remained several days before entering the wilderness of Sin.\nWhen they had been a month absent from Egypt, they made their\nfirst encampment in the wilderness. Their store of provisions had\nnow begun to fail. There was scanty herbage in the wilderness,\nand their flocks were diminishing. How was food to be supplied\nfor these vast multitudes? Doubts filled their hearts, and again\nthey murmured. Even the rulers and elders of the people joined\nin complaining against the leaders of God\u2019s appointment: \u201cWould\nto God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt,\nwhen we sat by the fleshpots, and when we did eat bread to the full;\nfor ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole\nassembly with hunger.\u201d\nThey had not as yet suffered from hunger; their present wants\nwere supplied, but they feared for the future. They could not un-\nderstand how these vast multitudes were to subsist in their travels\nthrough the wilderness, and in imagination they saw their children\nfamishing. The Lord permitted difficulties to surround them, and\ntheir supply of food to be cut short, that their hearts might turn to\nHim who had hitherto been their Deliverer. If in their want they\nwould call upon Him, He would still grant them manifest tokens\nof His love and care. He had promised that if they would obey His\ncommandments, no disease should come upon them, and it was\nsinful unbelief on their part to anticipate that they or their children\nmight die of hunger.\nGod had promised to be their God, to take them to Himself as\na people, and to lead them to a large and good land; but they were\nready to faint at every obstacle encountered in the way to that land.\nIn a marvelous manner He had brought them out from their bondage\nin Egypt, that He might elevate and ennoble them and make them\na praise in the earth. But it was necessary for them to encounter\ndifficulties and to endure privations. God was bringing them from a\nstate of degradation and fitting them to occupy an honorable place\namong the nations and to receive important and sacred trusts. Had\nthey possessed faith in Him, in view of all that He had wrought for\nthem, they would cheerfully have borne inconvenience, privation, [293]\nand even real suffering; but they were unwilling to trust the Lord any\nfurther than they could witness the continual evidences of His power.\nThey forgot their bitter service in Egypt. They forgot the goodness\n256 Patriarchs and Prophets\nand power of God displayed in their behalf in their deliverance from\nbondage. They forgot how their children had been spared when the\ndestroying angel slew all the first-born of Egypt. They forgot the\ngrand exhibition of divine power at the Red Sea. They forgot that\nwhile they had crossed safely in the path that had been opened for\nthem, the armies of their enemies, attempting to follow them, had\nbeen overwhelmed by the waters of the sea. They saw and felt only\ntheir present inconveniences and trials; and instead of saying, \u201cGod\nhas done great things for us; whereas we were slaves, He is making\nof us a great nation,\u201d they talked of the hardness of the way, and\nwondered when their weary pilgrimage would end.\nThe history of the wilderness life of Israel was chronicled for the\nbenefit of the Israel of God to the close of time. The record of God\u2019s\ndealings with the wanderers of the desert in all their marchings to\nand fro, in their exposure to hunger, thirst, and weariness, and in\nthe striking manifestations of His power for their relief, is fraught\nwith warning and instruction for His people in all ages. The varied\nexperience of the Hebrews was a school of preparation for their\npromised home in Canaan. God would have His people in these days\nreview with a humble heart and teachable spirit the trials through\nwhich ancient Israel passed, that they may be instructed in their\npreparation for the heavenly Canaan.\nMany look back to the Israelites, and marvel at their unbelief\nand murmuring, feeling that they themselves would not have been\nso ungrateful; but when their faith is tested, even by little trials, they\nmanifest no more faith or patience than did ancient Israel. When\nbrought into strait places, they murmur at the process by which\nGod has chosen to purify them. Though their present needs are\nsupplied, many are unwilling to trust God for the future, and they\nare in constant anxiety lest poverty shall come upon them, and their\nchildren shall be left to suffer. Some are always anticipating evil\nor magnifying the difficulties that really exist, so that their eyes are\nblinded to the many blessings which demand their gratitude. The\nobstacles they encounter, instead of leading them to seek help from[294]\nGod, the only Source of strength, separate them from Him, because\nthey awaken unrest and repining.\nDo we well to be thus unbelieving? Why should we be ungrateful\nand distrustful? Jesus is our friend; all heaven is interested in our\nFrom the Red Sea to Sinai 257\nwelfare; and our anxiety and fear grieve the Holy Spirit of God. We\nshould not indulge in a solicitude that only frets and wears us, but\ndoes not help us to bear trials. No place should be given to that\ndistrust of God which leads us to make a preparation against future\nwant the chief pursuit of life, as though our happiness consisted in\nthese earthly things. It is not the will of God that His people should\nbe weighed down with care. But our Lord does not tell us that there\nare no dangers in our path. He does not propose to take His people\nout of the world of sin and evil, but He points us to a never-failing\nrefuge. He invites the weary and care-laden, \u201cCome unto Me, all ye\nthat labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d Lay off the\nyoke of anxiety and worldly care that you have placed on your own\nneck, and \u201ctake My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek\nand lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\u201d Matthew\n11:28, 29. We may find rest and peace in God, casting all our care\nupon Him; for He careth for us. See 1 Peter 5:7.\nSays the apostle Paul, \u201cTake heed, brethren, lest there be in any\nof you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.\u201d\nHebrews 3:12. In view of all that God has wrought for us, our faith\nshould be strong, active, and enduring. Instead of murmuring and\ncomplaining, the language of our hearts should be, \u201cBless the Lord,\nO my soul: and all that is within me, bless His holy name. Bless the\nLord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits.\u201d Psalm 103:1, 2.\nGod was not unmindful of the wants of Israel. He said to their\nleader, \u201cI will rain bread from heaven for you.\u201d And directions were\ngiven that the people gather a daily supply, with a double amount\non the sixth day, that the sacred observance of the Sabbath might be\nmaintained.\nMoses assured the congregation that their wants were to be\nsupplied: \u201cThe Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in\nthe morning bread to the full.\u201d And he added, \u201cWhat are we? your\nmurmurings are not against us, but against the Lord.\u201d He further bade [295]\nAaron say to them, \u201cCome near before the Lord: for He hath heard\nyour murmurings.\u201d While Aaron was speaking, \u201cthey looked toward\nthe wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the\ncloud.\u201d A splendor such as they had never witnessed symbolized the\ndivine Presence. Through manifestations addressed to their senses,\nthey were to obtain a knowledge of God. They must be taught that\n258 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe Most High, and not merely the man Moses, was their leader, that\nthey might fear His name and obey His voice.\nAt nightfall the camp was surrounded by vast flocks of quails,\nenough to supply the entire company. In the morning there lay\nupon the surface of the ground \u201ca small round thing, as small as the\nhoarfrost.\u201d \u201cIt was like coriander seed, white.\u201d The people called it\n\u201cmanna.\u201d Moses said, \u201cThis is the bread which the Lord hath given\nyou to eat.\u201d The people gathered the manna, and found that there\nwas an abundant supply for all. They \u201cground it in mills, or beat it in\na mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it.\u201d Numbers 11:8.\n\u201cAnd the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.\u201d They were\ndirected to gather daily an omer for every person; and they were not\nto leave of it until the morning. Some attempted to keep a supply\nuntil the next day, but it was then found to be unfit for food. The\nprovision for the day must be gathered in the morning; for all that\nremained upon the ground was melted by the sun.\nIn the gathering of the manna it was found that some obtained\nmore and some less than the stipulated amount; but \u201cwhen they did\nmete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and\nhe that gathered little had no lack.\u201d An explanation of this scripture,\nas well as a practical lesson from it, is given by the apostle Paul\nin his second epistle to the Corinthians. He says, \u201cI mean not that\nother men be eased, and ye burdened: but by an equality, that now at\nthis time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their\nabundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be\nequality: as it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing\nover; and he that had gathered little had no lack.\u201d 2 Corinthians\n8:13-15.\nOn the sixth day the people gathered two omers for every person.\nThe rulers hastened to acquaint Moses with what had been done.\nHis answer was, \u201cThis is that which the Lord hath said, Tomorrow is[296]\nthe rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord: bake that which ye will\nbake today, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth\nover lay up for you to be kept until the morning.\u201d They did so, and\nfound that it remained unchanged. \u201cAnd Moses said, Eat that today;\nfor today is a Sabbath unto the Lord: today ye shall not find it in the\nfield. Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the\nSabbath, in it there shall be none.\u201d\nFrom the Red Sea to Sinai 259\nGod requires that His holy day be as sacredly observed now as\nin the time of Israel. The command given to the Hebrews should be\nregarded by all Christians as an injunction from Jehovah to them.\nThe day before the Sabbath should be made a day of preparation, that\neverything may be in readiness for its sacred hours. In no case should\nour own business be allowed to encroach upon holy time. God has\ndirected that the sick and suffering be cared for; the labor required\nto make them comfortable is a work of mercy, and no violation of\nthe Sabbath; but all unnecessary work should be avoided. Many\ncarelessly put off till the beginning of the Sabbath little things that\nmight have been done on the day of preparation. This should not\nbe. Work that is neglected until the beginning of the Sabbath should\nremain undone until it is past. This course might help the memory\nof these thoughtless ones, and make them careful to do their own\nwork on the six working days.\nEvery week during their long sojourn in the wilderness the Is-\nraelites witnessed a threefold miracle, designed to impress their\nminds with the sacredness of the Sabbath: a double quantity of\nmanna fell on the sixth day, none on the seventh, and the portion\nneeded for the Sabbath was preserved sweet and pure, when if any\nwere kept over at any other time it became unfit for use.\nIn the circumstances connected with the giving of the manna,\nwe have conclusive evidence that the Sabbath was not instituted, as\nmany claim, when the law was given at Sinai. Before the Israelites\ncame to Sinai they understood the Sabbath to be obligatory upon\nthem. In being obliged to gather every Friday a double portion of\nmanna in preparation for the Sabbath, when none would fall, the\nsacred nature of the day of rest was continually impressed upon\nthem. And when some of the people went out on the Sabbath to [297]\ngather manna, the Lord asked, \u201cHow long refuse ye to keep My\ncommandments and My laws?\u201d\n\u201cThe children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they\ncame to a land inhabited: they did eat manna, until they came unto\nthe borders of the land of Canaan.\u201d For forty years they were daily\nreminded by this miraculous provision, of God\u2019s unfailing care and\ntender love. In the words of the psalmist, God gave them \u201cof the\ncorn of heaven. Man did eat angels\u2019 food\u201d (Psalm 78:24, 25)\u2014that\nis, food provided for them by the angels. Sustained by \u201cthe corn of\n260 Patriarchs and Prophets\nheaven,\u201d they were daily taught that, having God\u2019s promise, they\nwere as secure from want as if surrounded by fields of waving grain\non the fertile plains of Canaan.\nThe manna, falling from heaven for the sustenance of Israel, was\na type of Him who came from God to give life to the world. Said\nJesus, \u201cI am that Bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the\nwilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from\nheaven.... If any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and the\nbread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the\nworld.\u201d John 6:48-51. And among the promises of blessing to God\u2019s\npeople in the future life it is written, \u201cTo him that overcometh will I\ngive to eat of the hidden manna.\u201d Revelation 2:17.\nAfter leaving the wilderness of Sin, the Israelites encamped\nin Rephidim. Here there was no water, and again they distrusted\nthe providence of God. In their blindness and presumption the\npeople came to Moses with the demand, \u201cGive us water that we\nmay drink.\u201d But his patience failed not. \u201cWhy chide ye with me?\u201d\nhe said; \u201cwherefore do ye tempt the Lord?\u201d They cried in anger,\n\u201cWherefore is this, that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill\nus and our children and our cattle with thirst?\u201d When they had been\nso abundantly supplied with food, they remembered with shame\ntheir unbelief and murmurings, and promised to trust the Lord in\nthe future; but they soon forgot their promise, and failed at the\nfirst trial of their faith. The pillar of cloud that was leading them\nseemed to veil a fearful mystery. And Moses\u2014who was he? they\nquestioned, and what could be his object in bringing them from\nEgypt? Suspicion and distrust filled their hearts, and they boldly\naccused him of designing to kill them and their children by privations[298]\nand hardships that he might enrich himself with their possessions.\nIn the tumult of rage and indignation they were about to stone him.\nIn distress Moses cried to the Lord, \u201cWhat shall I do unto this\npeople?\u201d He was directed to take the elders of Israel and the rod\nwherewith he had wrought wonders in Egypt, and to go on before\nthe people. And the Lord said unto him, \u201cBehold, I will stand before\nthee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock,\nand there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink.\u201d He\nobeyed, and the waters burst forth in a living stream that abundantly\nsupplied the encampment. Instead of commanding Moses to lift\nFrom the Red Sea to Sinai 261\nup his rod and call down some terrible plague, like those on Egypt,\nupon the leaders in this wicked murmuring, the Lord in His great\nmercy made the rod His instrument to work their deliverance.\n\u201cHe clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as\nout of the great depths. He brought streams also out of the rock,\nand caused waters to run down like rivers.\u201d Psalm 78:15, 16. Moses\nsmote the rock, but it was the Son of God who, veiled in the cloudy\npillar, stood beside Moses, and caused the life-giving water to flow.\nNot only Moses and the elders, but all the congregation who stood\nat a distance, beheld the glory of the Lord; but had the cloud been\nremoved, they would have been slain by the terrible brightness of\nHim who abode therein.\nIn their thirst the people had tempted God, saying, \u201cIs the Lord\namong us, or not?\u201d\u2014\u201cIf God has brought us here, why does He not\ngive us water as well as bread?\u201d The unbelief thus manifested was\ncriminal, and Moses feared that the judgments of God would rest\nupon them. And he called the name of the place Massah, \u201ctempta-\ntion,\u201d and Meribah, \u201cchiding,\u201d as a memorial of their sin.\nA new danger now threatened them. Because of their murmuring\nagainst Him, the Lord suffered them to be attacked by their enemies.\nThe Amalekites, a fierce, warlike tribe inhabiting that region, came\nout against them and smote those who, faint and weary, had fallen\ninto the rear. Moses, knowing that the masses of the people were\nunprepared for battle, directed Joshua to choose from the different\ntribes a body of soldiers, and lead them on the morrow against\nthe enemy, while he himself would stand on an eminence near by [299]\nwith the rod of God in his hand. Accordingly the next day Joshua\nand his company attacked the foe, while Moses and Aaron and\nHur were stationed on a hill overlooking the battlefield. With arms\noutstretched toward heaven, and holding the rod of God in his right\nhand, Moses prayed for the success of the armies of Israel. As the\nbattle progressed, it was observed that so long as his hands were\nreaching upward, Israel prevailed, but when they were lowered, the\nenemy was victorious. As Moses became weary, Aaron and Hur\nstayed up his hands until the going down of the sun, when the enemy\nwas put to flight.\nAs Aaron and Hur supported the hands of Moses, they showed\nthe people their duty to sustain him in his arduous work while he\n262 Patriarchs and Prophets\nshould receive the word from God to speak to them. And the act of\nMoses also was significant, showing that God held their destiny in\nHis hands; while they made Him their trust, He would fight for them\nand subdue their enemies; but when they should let go their hold\nupon Him, and trust in their own power, they would be even weaker\nthan those who had not the knowledge of God, and their foes would\nprevail against them.\nAs the Hebrews triumphed when Moses was reaching his hands\ntoward heaven and interceding in their behalf, so the Israel of God\nprevail when they by faith take hold upon the strength of their mighty\nHelper. Yet divine strength is to be combined with human effort.\nMoses did not believe that God would overcome their foes while\nIsrael remained inactive. While the great leader was pleading with\nthe Lord, Joshua and his brave followers were putting forth their\nutmost efforts to repulse the enemies of Israel and of God.\nAfter the defeat of the Amalekites, God directed Moses, \u201cWrite\nthis for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua:\nfor I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under\nheaven.\u201d Just before his death the great leader delivered to his people\nthe solemn charge: \u201cRemember what Amalek did unto thee by the\nway, when ye were come forth out of Egypt; how he met thee by the\nway, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind\nthee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.... Thou\nshalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou[300]\nshalt not forget it.\u201d Deuteronomy 25:17-19. Concerning this wicked\npeople the Lord declared, \u201cThe hand of Amalek is against the throne\nof Jehovah.\u201d Exodus 17:16, margin.\nThe Amalekites were not ignorant of God\u2019s character or of His\nsovereignty, but instead of fearing before Him, they had set them-\nselves to defy His power. The wonders wrought by Moses before\nthe Egyptians were made a subject of mockery by the people of\nAmalek, and the fears of surrounding nations were ridiculed. They\nhad taken oath by their gods that they would destroy the Hebrews, so\nthat not one should escape, and they boasted that Israel\u2019s God would\nbe powerless to resist them. They had not been injured or threatened\nby the Israelites. Their assault was wholly unprovoked. It was to\nmanifest their hatred and defiance of God that they sought to destroy\nHis people. The Amalekites had long been high-handed sinners,\nFrom the Red Sea to Sinai 263\nand their crimes had cried to God for vengeance, yet His mercy had\nstill called them to repentance; but when the men of Amalek fell\nupon the wearied and defenseless ranks of Israel, they sealed their\nnation\u2019s doom. The care of God is over the weakest of His children.\nNo act of cruelty or oppression toward them is unmarked by Heaven.\nOver all who love and fear Him, His hand extends as a shield; let\nmen beware that they smite not that hand; for it wields the sword of\njustice.\nNot far distant from where the Israelites were now encamped\nwas the home of Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses. Jethro had\nheard of the deliverance of the Hebrews, and he now set out to visit\nthem, and restore to Moses his wife and two sons. The great leader\nwas informed by messengers of their approach, and he went out\nwith joy to meet them, and, the first greetings over, conducted them\nto his tent. He had sent back his family when on his way to the\nperils of leading Israel from Egypt, but now he could again enjoy\nthe relief and comfort of their society. To Jethro he recounted the\nwonderful dealings of God with Israel, and the patriarch rejoiced\nand blessed the Lord, and with Moses and the elders he united in\noffering sacrifice and holding a solemn feast in commemoration of\nGod\u2019s mercy.\nAs Jethro remained in the camp, he soon saw how heavy were the\nburdens that rested upon Moses. To maintain order and discipline\namong that vast, ignorant, and untrained multitude was indeed a\nstupendous task. Moses was their recognized leader and magistrate, [301]\nand not only the general interests and duties of the people, but the\ncontroversies that arose among them, were referred to him. He had\npermitted this, for it gave him an opportunity to instruct them; as he\nsaid, \u201cI do make them know the statutes of God, and His laws.\u201d But\nJethro remonstrated against this, saying, \u201cThis thing is too heavy for\nthee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.\u201d \u201cThou wilt surely\nwear away,\u201d and he counseled Moses to appoint proper persons as\nrulers of thousands, and others as rulers of hundreds, and others of\ntens. They should be \u201cable men, such as fear God, men of truth,\nhating covetousness.\u201d These were to judge in all matters of minor\nconsequence, while the most difficult and important cases should\nstill be brought before Moses, who was to be to the people, said\nJethro, \u201cto God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:\n264 Patriarchs and Prophets\nand thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them\nthe way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.\u201d\nThis counsel was accepted, and it not only brought relief to Moses,\nbut resulted in establishing more perfect order among the people.\nThe Lord had greatly honored Moses, and had wrought wonders\nby his hand; but the fact that he had been chosen to instruct others\ndid not lead him to conclude that he himself needed no instruction.\nThe chosen leader of Israel listened gladly to the suggestions of the\ngodly priest of Midian, and adopted his plan as a wise arrangement.\nFrom Rephidim the people continued their journey, following\nthe movement of the cloudy pillar. Their route had led across barren\nplains, over steep ascents, and through rocky defiles. Often as they\nhad traversed the sandy wastes, they had seen before them rugged\nmountains, like huge bulwarks, piled up directly across their course,\nand seeming to forbid all further progress. But as they approached,\nopenings here and there appeared in the mountain wall, and beyond,\nanother plain opened to view. Through one of the deep, gravelly\npasses they were now led. It was a grand and impressive scene.\nBetween the rocky cliffs rising hundreds of feet on either side, flowed\nin a living tide, far as the eye could reach, the hosts of Israel with\ntheir flocks and herds. And now before them in solemn majesty\nMount Sinai lifted its massive front. The cloudy pillar rested upon\nits summit, and the people spread their tents upon the plain beneath.\nHere was to be their home for nearly a year. At night the pillar of fire[302]\nassured them of the divine protection, and while they were locked in\nslumber, the bread of heaven fell gently upon the encampment.\nThe dawn gilded the dark ridges of the mountains, and the sun\u2019s\ngolden rays pierced the deep gorges, seeming to these weary trav-\nelers like beams of mercy from the throne of God. On every hand\nvast, rugged heights seemed in their solitary grandeur to speak of\neternal endurance and majesty. Here the mind was impressed with\nsolemnity and awe. Man was made to feel his ignorance and weak-\nness in the presence of Him who \u201cweighed the mountains in scales,\nand the hills in a balance.\u201d Isaiah 40:12. Here Israel was to receive\nthe most wonderful revelation ever made by God to men. Here the\nLord had gathered His people that He might impress upon them the\nsacredness of His requirements by declaring with His own voice His\nholy law. Great and radical changes were to be wrought in them; for\nFrom the Red Sea to Sinai 265\nthe degrading influences of servitude and a long-continued associa-\ntion with idolatry had left their mark upon habits and character. God\nwas working to lift them to a higher moral level by giving them a\nknowledge of Himself.\nChapter 27\u2014The Law Given to Israel[303]\nThis chapter is based on Exodus 19 to 24.\nSoon after the encampment at Sinai, Moses was called up into\nthe mountain to meet with God. Alone he climbed the steep and\nrugged path, and drew near to the cloud that marked the place of\nJehovah\u2019s presence. Israel was now to be taken into a close and\npeculiar relation to the Most High\u2014to be incorporated as a church\nand a nation under the government of God. The message to Moses\nfor the people was:\n\u201cYe have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you\non eagles\u2019 wings, and brought you unto Myself. Now therefore, if\nye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall\nbe a peculiar treasure unto Me above all people: for all the earth is\nMine: and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and an holy\nnation.\u201d\nMoses returned to the camp, and having summoned the elders of\nIsrael, he repeated to them the divine message. Their answer was,\n\u201cAll that the Lord hath spoken we will do.\u201d Thus they entered into a\nsolemn covenant with God, pledging themselves to accept Him as\ntheir ruler, by which they became, in a special sense, the subjects of\nHis authority.\nAgain their leader ascended the mountain, and the Lord said\nunto him, \u201cLo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people\nmay hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee forever.\u201d When\nthey met with difficulties in the way, they were disposed to murmur\nagainst Moses and Aaron, and accuse them of leading the hosts of\nIsrael from Egypt to destroy them. The Lord would honor Moses\nbefore them, that they might be led to confide in his instructions.\nGod purposed to make the occasion of speaking His law a scene\nof awful grandeur, in keeping with its exalted character. The people\nwere to be impressed that everything connected with the service of\nGod must be regarded with the greatest reverence. The Lord said to[304]\n266\nLaw Given to Israel 267\nMoses, \u201cGo unto the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow,\nand let them wash their clothes, and be ready against the third day:\nfor the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the\npeople upon Mount Sinai.\u201d During these intervening days all were\nto occupy the time in solemn preparation to appear before God.\nTheir person and their clothing must be freed from impurity. And as\nMoses should point out their sins, they were to devote themselves to\nhumiliation, fasting, and prayer, that their hearts might be cleansed\nfrom iniquity.\nThe preparations were made, according to the command; and in\nobedience to a further injunction, Moses directed that a barrier be\nplaced about the mount, that neither man nor beast might intrude\nupon the sacred precinct. If any ventured so much as to touch it, the\npenalty was instant death.\nOn the morning of the third day, as the eyes of all the people were\nturned toward the mount, its summit was covered with a thick cloud,\nwhich grew more black and dense, sweeping downward until the\nentire mountain was wrapped in darkness and awful mystery. Then\na sound as of a trumpet was heard, summoning the people to meet\nwith God; and Moses led them forth to the base of the mountain.\nFrom the thick darkness flashed vivid lightnings, while peals of\nthunder echoed and re-echoed among the surrounding heights. \u201cAnd\nMount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended\nupon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a\nfurnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.\u201d \u201cThe glory of the\nLord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount\u201d in the sight\nof the assembled multitude. And \u201cthe voice of the trumpet sounded\nlong, and waxed louder and louder.\u201d So terrible were the tokens\nof Jehovah\u2019s presence that the hosts of Israel shook with fear, and\nfell upon their faces before the Lord. Even Moses exclaimed, \u201cI\nexceedingly fear and quake.\u201d Hebrews 12:21.\nAnd now the thunders ceased; the trumpet was no longer heard;\nthe earth was still. There was a period of solemn silence, and then\nthe voice of God was heard. Speaking out of the thick darkness\nthat enshrouded Him, as He stood upon the mount, surrounded by a\nretinue of angels, the Lord made known His law. Moses, describing\nthe scene, says: \u201cThe Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir [305]\nunto them; He shined forth from Mount Paran, and He came with\n268 Patriarchs and Prophets\nten thousands of saints: from His right hand went a fiery law for\nthem. Yea, He loved the people; all His saints are in Thy hand: and\nthey sat down at Thy feet; every one shall receive of Thy words.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 33:2, 3.\nJehovah revealed Himself, not alone in the awful majesty of\nthe judge and lawgiver, but as the compassionate guardian of His\npeople: \u201cI am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of\nthe land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.\u201d He whom they\nhad already known as their Guide and Deliverer, who had brought\nthem forth from Egypt, making a way for them through the sea, and\noverthrowing Pharaoh and his hosts, who had thus shown Himself to\nbe above all the gods of Egypt\u2014He it was who now spoke His law.\nThe law was not spoken at this time exclusively for the benefit\nof the Hebrews. God honored them by making them the guardians\nand keepers of His law, but it was to be held as a sacred trust for\nthe whole world. The precepts of the Decalogue are adapted to all\nmankind, and they were given for the instruction and government\nof all. Ten precepts, brief, comprehensive, and authoritative, cover\nthe duty of man to God and to his fellow man; and all based upon\nthe great fundamental principle of love. \u201cThou shalt love the Lord\nthy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy\nstrength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d Luke\n10:27. See also Deuteronomy 6:4, 5; Leviticus 19:18. In the Ten\nCommandments these principles are carried out in detail, and made\napplicable to the condition and circumstances of man.\n\u201cThou shalt have no other gods before Me.\u201d\nJehovah, the eternal, self-existent, uncreated One, Himself the\nSource and Sustainer of all, is alone entitled to supreme reverence\nand worship. Man is forbidden to give to any other object the first\nplace in his affections or his service. Whatever we cherish that tends\nto lessen our love for God or to interfere with the service due Him,\nof that do we make a god.\n\u201cThou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness\nof anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or\nthat is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself\nto them, nor serve them.\u201d\nThe second commandment forbids the worship of the true God[306]\nby images or similitudes. Many heathen nations claimed that their\nLaw Given to Israel 269\nimages were mere figures or symbols by which the Deity was wor-\nshiped, but God has declared such worship to be sin. The attempt\nto represent the Eternal One by material objects would lower man\u2019s\nconception of God. The mind, turned away from the infinite per-\nfection of Jehovah, would be attracted to the creature rather than to\nthe Creator. And as his conceptions of God were lowered, so would\nman become degraded.\n\u201cI the Lord thy God am a jealous God.\u201d The close and sacred\nrelation of God to His people is represented under the figure of\nmarriage. Idolatry being spiritual adultery, the displeasure of God\nagainst it is fitly called jealousy.\n\u201cVisiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the\nthird and fourth generation of them that hate Me.\u201d It is inevitable\nthat children should suffer from the consequences of parental wrong-\ndoing, but they are not punished for the parents\u2019 guilt, except as they\nparticipate in their sins. It is usually the case, however, that children\nwalk in the steps of their parents. By inheritance and example the\nsons become partakers of the father\u2019s sin. Wrong tendencies, per-\nverted appetites, and debased morals, as well as physical disease\nand degeneracy, are transmitted as a legacy from father to son, to the\nthird and fourth generation. This fearful truth should have a solemn\npower to restrain men from following a course of sin.\n\u201cShowing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me, and keep\nMy commandments.\u201d In prohibiting the worship of false gods, the\nsecond commandment by implication enjoins the worship of the\ntrue God. And to those who are faithful in His service, mercy is\npromised, not merely to the third and fourth generation as is the\nwrath threatened against those who hate Him, but to thousands of\ngenerations.\n\u201cThou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for\nthe Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.\u201d\nThis commandment not only prohibits false oaths and common\nswearing, but it forbids us to use the name of God in a light or\ncareless manner, without regard to its awful significance. By the\nthoughtless mention of God in common conversation, by appeals to\nHim in trivial matters, and by the frequent and thoughtless repetition [307]\nof His name, we dishonor Him. \u201cHoly and reverend is His name.\u201d\nPsalm 111:9. All should meditate upon His majesty, His purity and\n270 Patriarchs and Prophets\nholiness, that the heart may be impressed with a sense of His exalted\ncharacter; and His holy name should be uttered with reverence and\nsolemnity.\n\u201cRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou\nlabor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of\nthe Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy\nson, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy\ncattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the\nLord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and\nrested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day,\nand hallowed it.\u201d\nThe Sabbath is not introduced as a new institution but as having\nbeen founded at creation. It is to be remembered and observed as\nthe memorial of the Creator\u2019s work. Pointing to God as the Maker\nof the heavens and the earth, it distinguishes the true God from all\nfalse gods. All who keep the seventh day signify by this act that\nthey are worshipers of Jehovah. Thus the Sabbath is the sign of\nman\u2019s allegiance to God as long as there are any upon the earth\nto serve Him. The fourth commandment is the only one of all the\nten in which are found both the name and the title of the Lawgiver.\nIt is the only one that shows by whose authority the law is given.\nThus it contains the seal of God, affixed to His law as evidence of\nits authenticity and binding force.\nGod has given men six days wherein to labor, and He requires\nthat their own work be done in the six working days. Acts of neces-\nsity and mercy are permitted on the Sabbath, the sick and suffering\nare at all times to be cared for; but unnecessary labor is to be strictly\navoided. \u201cTurn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy\npleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy\nof the Lord, honorable; and ... honor Him, not doing thine own\nways, nor finding thine own pleasure.\u201d Isaiah 58:13. Nor does the\nprohibition end here. \u201cNor speaking thine own words,\u201d says the\nprophet. Those who discuss business matters or lay plans on the\nSabbath are regarded by God as though engaged in the actual trans-\naction of business. To keep the Sabbath holy, we should not even\nallow our minds to dwell upon things of a worldly character. And\nthe commandment includes all within our gates. The inmates of the\nhouse are to lay aside their worldly business during the sacred hours.[308]\nLaw Given to Israel 271\nAll should unite to honor God by willing service upon His holy day.\n\u201cHonor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long\nupon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\u201d\nParents are entitled to a degree of love and respect which is due\nto no other person. God Himself, who has placed upon them a re-\nsponsibility for the souls committed to their charge, has ordained\nthat during the earlier years of life, parents shall stand in the place\nof God to their children. And he who rejects the rightful authority\nof his parents is rejecting the authority of God. The fifth command-\nment requires children not only to yield respect, submission, and\nobedience to their parents, but also to give them love and tenderness,\nto lighten their cares, to guard their reputation, and to succor and\ncomfort them in old age. It also enjoins respect for ministers and\nrulers and for all others to whom God has delegated authority.\nThis, says the apostle, \u201cis the first commandment with promise.\u201d\nEphesians 6:2. To Israel, expecting soon to enter Canaan, it was\na pledge to the obedient, of long life in that good land; but it has\na wider meaning, including all the Israel of God, and promising\neternal life upon the earth when it shall be freed from the curse of\nsin.\n\u201cThou shalt not kill.\u201d\nAll acts of injustice that tend to shorten life; the spirit of hatred\nand revenge, or the indulgence of any passion that leads to injuri-\nous acts toward others, or causes us even to wish them harm (for\n\u201cwhosoever hateth his brother is a murderer\u201d); a selfish neglect of\ncaring for the needy or suffering; all self-indulgence or unnecessary\ndeprivation or excessive labor that tends to injure health\u2014all these\nare, to a greater or less degree, violations of the sixth commandment.\n\u201cThou shalt not commit adultery.\u201d\nThis commandment forbids not only acts of impurity, but sensual\nthoughts and desires, or any practice that tends to excite them. Purity\nis demanded not only in the outward life but in the secret intents and\nemotions of the heart. Christ, who taught the far-reaching obligation\nof the law of God, declared the evil thought or look to be as truly\nsin as is the unlawful deed.\n\u201cThou shalt not steal.\u201d\nBoth public and private sins are included in this prohibition. The [309]\neighth commandment condemns manstealing and slave dealing, and\n272 Patriarchs and Prophets\nforbids wars of conquest. It condemns theft and robbery. It demands\nstrict integrity in the minutest details of the affairs of life. It forbids\noverreaching in trade, and requires the payment of just debts or\nwages. It declares that every attempt to advantage oneself by the\nignorance, weakness, or misfortune of another is registered as fraud\nin the books of heaven.\n\u201cThou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\u201d\nFalse speaking in any matter, every attempt or purpose to deceive\nour neighbor, is here included. An intention to deceive is what con-\nstitutes falsehood. By a glance of the eye, a motion of the hand, an\nexpression of the countenance, a falsehood may be told as effectually\nas by words. All intentional overstatement, every hint or insinuation\ncalculated to convey an erroneous or exaggerated impression, even\nthe statement of facts in such a manner as to mislead, is falsehood.\nThis precept forbids every effort to injure our neighbor\u2019s reputation\nby misrepresentation or evil surmising, by slander or tale bearing.\nEven the intentional suppression of truth, by which injury may result\nto others, is a violation of the ninth commandment.\n\u201cThou shalt not covet thy neighbor\u2019s house, thou shalt not covet\nthy neighbor\u2019s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor\nhis ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor\u2019s.\u201d\nThe tenth commandment strikes at the very root of all sins, pro-\nhibiting the selfish desire, from which springs the sinful act. He\nwho in obedience to God\u2019s law refrains from indulging even a sinful\ndesire for that which belongs to another will not be guilty of an act\nof wrong toward his fellow creatures.\nSuch were the sacred precepts of the Decalogue, spoken amid\nthunder and flame, and with a wonderful display of the power and\nmajesty of the great Lawgiver. God accompanied the proclamation\nof His law with exhibitions of His power and glory, that His people\nmight never forget the scene, and that they might be impressed\nwith profound veneration for the Author of the law, the Creator of\nheaven and earth. He would also show to all men the sacredness, the\nimportance, and the permanence of His law.\nThe people of Israel were overwhelmed with terror. The awful\npower of God\u2019s utterances seemed more than their trembling hearts\ncould bear. For as God\u2019s great rule of right was presented before[310]\nthem, they realized as never before the offensive character of sin, and\nLaw Given to Israel 273\ntheir own guilt in the sight of a holy God. They shrank away from\nthe mountain in fear and awe. The multitude cried out to Moses,\n\u201cSpeak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with\nus, lest we die.\u201d The leader answered, \u201cFear not: for God is come to\nprove you, and that His fear may be before your faces, that ye sin\nnot.\u201d The people, however, remained at a distance, gazing in terror\nupon the scene, while Moses \u201cdrew near unto the thick darkness\nwhere God was.\u201d\nThe minds of the people, blinded and debased by slavery and\nheathenism, were not prepared to appreciate fully the far-reach-\ning principles of God\u2019s ten precepts. That the obligations of the\nDecalogue might be more fully understood and enforced, additional\nprecepts were given, illustrating and applying the principles of the\nTen Commandments. These laws were called judgments, both be-\ncause they were framed in infinite wisdom and equity and because\nthe magistrates were to give judgment according to them. Unlike\nthe Ten Commandments, they were delivered privately to Moses,\nwho was to communicate them to the people.\nThe first of these laws related to servants. In ancient times\ncriminals were sometimes sold into slavery by the judges; in some\ncases, debtors were sold by their creditors; and poverty even led\npersons to sell themselves or their children. But a Hebrew could\nnot be sold as a slave for life. His term of service was limited to\nsix years; on the seventh he was to be set at liberty. Manstealing,\ndeliberate murder, and rebellion against parental authority were to\nbe punished with death. The holding of slaves not of Israelitish birth\nwas permitted, but their life and person were strictly guarded. The\nmurderer of a slave was to be punished; an injury inflicted upon one\nby his master, though no more than the loss of a tooth, entitled him\nto his freedom.\nThe Israelites had lately been servants themselves, and now that\nthey were to have servants under them, they were to beware of\nindulging the spirit of cruelty and exaction from which they had\nsuffered under their Egyptian taskmasters. The memory of their\nown bitter servitude should enable them to put themselves in the\nservant\u2019s place, leading them to be kind and compassionate, to deal\nwith others as they would wish to be dealt with.\n274 Patriarchs and Prophets\nThe rights of widows and orphans were especially guarded, and\na tender regard for their helpless condition was enjoined. \u201cIf thou[311]\nafflict them in any wise,\u201d the Lord declared, \u201cand they cry at all unto\nMe, I will surely hear their cry; and My wrath shall wax hot, and I\nwill kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and\nyour children fatherless.\u201d Aliens who united themselves with Israel\nwere to be protected from wrong or oppression. \u201cThou shalt not\noppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye\nwere strangers in the land of Egypt.\u201d\nThe taking of usury from the poor was forbidden. A poor man\u2019s\nraiment or blanket taken as a pledge, must be restored to him at\nnightfall. He who was guilty of theft was required to restore dou-\nble. Respect for magistrates and rulers was enjoined, and judges\nwere warned against perverting judgment, aiding a false cause, or\nreceiving bribes. Calumny and slander were prohibited, and acts of\nkindness enjoined, even toward personal enemies.\nAgain the people were reminded of the sacred obligation of\nthe Sabbath. Yearly feasts were appointed, at which all the men\nof the nation were to assemble before the Lord, bringing to Him\ntheir offerings of gratitude and the first fruits of His bounties. The\nobject of all these regulations was stated: they proceeded from no\nexercise of mere arbitrary sovereignty; all were given for the good\nof Israel. The Lord said, \u201cYe shall be holy men unto Me\u201d\u2014worthy\nto be acknowledged by a holy God.\nThese laws were to be recorded by Moses, and carefully trea-\nsured as the foundation of the national law, and, with the ten precepts\nwhich they were given to illustrate, the condition of the fulfillment\nof God\u2019s promises to Israel.\nThe message was now given them from Jehovah: \u201cBehold, I\nsend an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee\ninto the place which I have prepared. Beware of Him, and obey His\nvoice, provoke Him not; for He will not pardon your transgressions:\nfor My name is in Him. But if thou shalt indeed obey His voice,\nand do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies,\nand an adversary unto thine adversaries.\u201d During all the wanderings\nof Israel, Christ, in the pillar of cloud and of fire, was their Leader.\nWhile there were types pointing to a Saviour to come, there was also\nLaw Given to Israel 275\na present Saviour, who gave commands to Moses for the people, and\nwho was set forth before them as the only channel of blessing.\nUpon descending from the mountain, \u201cMoses came and told the\npeople all the words of the Lord, and all the judgments: and all the [312]\npeople answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the\nLord hath said will we do.\u201d This pledge, together with the words of\nthe Lord which it bound them to obey, was written by Moses in a\nbook.\nThen followed the ratification of the covenant. An altar was built\nat the foot of the mountain, and beside it twelve pillars were set\nup, \u201caccording to the twelve tribes of Israel,\u201d as a testimony to their\nacceptance of the covenant. Sacrifices were then presented by young\nmen chosen for the service.\nHaving sprinkled the altar with the blood of the offerings, Moses\n\u201ctook the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the\npeople.\u201d Thus the conditions of the covenant were solemnly repeated,\nand all were at liberty to choose whether or not they would comply\nwith them. They had at the first promised to obey the voice of God;\nbut they had since heard His law proclaimed; and its principles had\nbeen particularized, that they might know how much this covenant\ninvolved. Again the people answered with one accord, \u201cAll that\nthe Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient.\u201d \u201cWhen Moses had\nspoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took\nthe blood, ... and sprinkled both the book and all the people, saying,\nThis is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto\nyou.\u201d Hebrews 9:19, 20.\nArrangements were now to be made for the full establishment of\nthe chosen nation under Jehovah as their king. Moses had received\nthe command, \u201cCome up unto the Lord, thou, and Aaron, Nadab,\nand Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar\noff. And Moses alone shall come near the Lord.\u201d While the peo-\nple worshiped at its foot, these chosen men were called up into the\nmount. The seventy elders were to assist Moses in the government\nof Israel, and God put upon them His Spirit, and honored them with\na view of His power and greatness. \u201cAnd they saw the God of Israel:\nand there was under His feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire\nstone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.\u201d They did\nnot behold the Deity, but they saw the glory of His presence. Before\n276 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthis they could not have endured such a scene; but the exhibition\nof God\u2019s power had awed them to repentance; they had been con-\ntemplating His glory, purity, and mercy, until they could approach\nnearer to Him who was the subject of their meditations.\nMoses and \u201chis minister Joshua\u201d were now summoned to meet[313]\nwith God. And as they were to be some time absent, the leader\nappointed Aaron and Hur, assisted by the elders, to act in his stead.\n\u201cAnd Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.\nAnd the glory of the Lord abode upon Mount Sinai.\u201d For six days\nthe cloud covered the mountain as a token of God\u2019s special presence;\nyet there was no revelation of Himself or communication of His will.\nDuring this time Moses remained in waiting for a summons to the\npresence chamber of the Most High. He had been directed, \u201cCome\nup to Me into the mount, and be there,\u201d and though his patience and\nobedience were tested, he did not grow weary of watching, or forsake\nhis post. This period of waiting was to him a time of preparation,\nof close self-examination. Even this favored servant of God could\nnot at once approach into His presence and endure the exhibitions\nof His glory. Six days must be employed in devoting himself to God\nby searching of heart, meditation, and prayer before he could be\nprepared for direct communication with his Maker.\nUpon the seventh day, which was the Sabbath, Moses was called\nup into the cloud. The thick cloud opened in the sight of all Israel,\nand the glory of the Lord broke forth like devouring fire. \u201cAnd Moses\nwent into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount;\nand Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.\u201d The forty\ndays\u2019 tarry in the mount did not include the six days of preparation.\nDuring the six days Joshua was with Moses, and together they ate of\nthe manna and drank of \u201cthe brook that descended out of the mount.\u201d\nBut Joshua did not enter with Moses into the cloud. He remained\nwithout, and continued to eat and drink daily while awaiting the\nreturn of Moses, but Moses fasted during the entire forty days.\nDuring his stay in the mount, Moses received directions for\nthe building of a sanctuary in which the divine presence would be\nspecially manifested. \u201cLet them make Me a sanctuary; that I may\ndwell among them\u201d (Exodus 25:8), was the command of God. For\nthe third time the observance of the Sabbath was enjoined. \u201cIt is\na sign between Me and the children of Israel forever,\u201d the Lord\nLaw Given to Israel 277\ndeclared, \u201cthat ye may know that I am Jehovah that doth sanctify\nyou. Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you....\nWhosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from\namong his people.\u201d Exodus 31:17, 13, 14. Directions had just been [314]\ngiven for the immediate erection of the tabernacle for the service of\nGod; and now the people might conclude, because the object had\nin view was the glory of God, and also because of their great need\nof a place of worship, that they would be justified in working at\nthe building upon the Sabbath. To guard them from this error, the\nwarning was given. Even the sacredness and urgency of that special\nwork for God must not lead them to infringe upon His holy rest day.\nHenceforth the people were to be honored with the abiding\npresence of their King. \u201cI will dwell among the children of Israel,\nand will be their God,\u201d \u201cand the tabernacle shall be sanctified by My\nglory\u201d (Exodus 29:45, 43), was the assurance given to Moses. As\nthe symbol of God\u2019s authority and the embodiment of His will, there\nwas delivered to Moses a copy of the Decalogue engraved by the\nfinger of God Himself upon two tables of stone (Deuteronomy 9:10;\nExodus 32:15, 16), to be sacredly enshrined in the sanctuary, which,\nwhen made, was to be the visible center of the nation\u2019s worship.\nFrom a race of slaves the Israelites had been exalted above all\npeoples to be the peculiar treasure of the King of kings. God had\nseparated them from the world, that He might commit to them a\nsacred trust. He had made them the depositaries of His law, and\nHe purposed, through them, to preserve among men the knowledge\nof Himself. Thus the light of heaven was to shine out to a world\nenshrouded in darkness, and a voice was to be heard appealing to\nall peoples to turn from their idolatry to serve the living God. If the\nIsraelites would be true to their trust, they would become a power\nin the world. God would be their defense, and He would exalt them\nabove all other nations. His light and truth would be revealed through\nthem, and they would stand forth under His wise and holy rule as\nan example of the superiority of His worship over every form of\nidolatry.\nChapter 28\u2014Idolatry at Sinai[315]\nThis chapter is based on Exodus 32 to 34.\nWhile Moses was absent it was a time of waiting and suspense to\nIsrael. The people knew that he had ascended the mount with Joshua,\nand had entered the cloud of thick darkness which could be seen\nfrom the plain below, resting on the mountain peak, illuminated from\ntime to time with the lightnings of the divine Presence. They waited\neagerly for his return. Accustomed as they had been in Egypt to\nmaterial representations of deity, it had been hard for them to trust in\nan invisible being, and they had come to rely upon Moses to sustain\ntheir faith. Now he was taken from them. Day after day, week after\nweek passed, and still he did not return. Notwithstanding the cloud\nwas still in view, it seemed to many in the camp that their leader had\ndeserted them, or that he had been consumed by the devouring fire.\nDuring this period of waiting, there was time for them to meditate\nupon the law of God which they had heard, and to prepare their\nhearts to receive the further revelations that He might make to them.\nThey had none too much time for this work; and had they been\nthus seeking a clearer understanding of God\u2019s requirements, and\nhumbling their hearts before Him, they would have been shielded\nfrom temptation. But they did not do this, and they soon became\ncareless, inattentive, and lawless. Especially was this the case with\nthe mixed multitude. They were impatient to be on their way to the\nLand of Promise\u2014the land flowing with milk and honey. It was only\non condition of obedience that the goodly land was promised them,\nbut they had lost sight of this. There were some who suggested\na return to Egypt, but whether forward to Canaan or backward to\nEgypt, the masses of the people were determined to wait no longer\nfor Moses.\nFeeling their helplessness in the absence of their leader, they\nreturned to their old superstitions. The \u201cmixed multitude\u201d had been[316]\nthe first to indulge murmuring and impatience, and they were the\n278\nIdolatry at Sinai 279\nleaders in the apostasy that followed. Among the objects regarded\nby the Egyptians as symbols of deity was the ox or calf; and it was\nat the suggestion of those who had practiced this form of idolatry in\nEgypt that a calf was now made and worshiped. The people desired\nsome image to represent God, and to go before them in the place\nof Moses. God had given no manner of similitude of Himself, and\nHe had prohibited any material representation for such a purpose.\nThe mighty miracles in Egypt and at the Red Sea were designed to\nestablish faith in Him as the invisible, all-powerful Helper of Israel,\nthe only true God. And the desire for some visible manifestation of\nHis presence had been granted in the pillar of cloud and of fire that\nguided their hosts, and in the revealing of His glory upon Mount\nSinai. But with the cloud of the Presence still before them, they\nturned back in their hearts to the idolatry of Egypt, and represented\nthe glory of the invisible God by the similitude of an ox!\nIn the absence of Moses, the judicial authority had been dele-\ngated to Aaron, and a vast crowd gathered about his tent, with the\ndemand, \u201cMake us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this\nMoses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot\nnot what is become of him.\u201d [See Appendix, note 4.] The cloud, they\nsaid, that had heretofore led them, now rested permanently upon\nthe mount; it would no longer direct their travels. They must have\nan image in its place; and if, as had been suggested, they should\ndecide to return to Egypt, they would find favor with the Egyptians\nby bearing this image before them and acknowledging it as their\ngod.\nSuch a crisis demanded a man of firmness, decision, and un-\nflinching courage; one who held the honor of God above popular\nfavor, personal safety, or life itself. But the present leader of Israel\nwas not of this character. Aaron feebly remonstrated with the people,\nbut his wavering and timidity at the critical moment only rendered\nthem the more determined. The tumult increased. A blind, unreason-\ning frenzy seemed to take possession of the multitude. There were\nsome who remained true to their covenant with God, but the greater\npart of the people joined in the apostasy. A few who ventured to\ndenounce the proposed image making as idolatry, were set upon and [317]\nroughly treated, and in the confusion and excitement they finally\nlost their lives.\n280 Patriarchs and Prophets\nAaron feared for his own safety; and instead of nobly standing\nup for the honor of God, he yielded to the demands of the multitude.\nHis first act was to direct that the golden earrings be collected from\nall the people and brought to him, hoping that pride would lead\nthem to refuse such a sacrifice. But they willingly yielded up their\nornaments; and from these he made a molten calf, in imitation of\nthe gods of Egypt. The people proclaimed, \u201cThese be thy gods,\nO Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\u201d And\nAaron basely permitted this insult to Jehovah. He did more. Seeing\nwith what satisfaction the golden god was received, he built an\naltar before it, and made proclamation, \u201cTomorrow is a feast to\nthe Lord.\u201d The announcement was heralded by trumpeters from\ncompany to company throughout the camp. \u201cAnd they rose up\nearly on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace\nofferings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to\nplay.\u201d Under the pretense of holding \u201ca feast to the Lord,\u201d they gave\nthemselves up to gluttony and licentious reveling.\nHow often, in our own day, is the love of pleasure disguised by\na \u201cform of godliness\u201d! A religion that permits men, while observing\nthe rites of worship, to devote themselves to selfish or sensual grati-\nfication, is as pleasing to the multitudes now as in the days of Israel.\nAnd there are still pliant Aarons, who, while holding positions of\nauthority in the church, will yield to the desires of the unconsecrated,\nand thus encourage them in sin.\nOnly a few days had passed since the Hebrews had made a\nsolemn covenant with God to obey His voice. They had stood\ntrembling with terror before the mount, listening to the words of\nthe Lord, \u201cThou shalt have no other gods before Me.\u201d The glory of\nGod still hovered above Sinai in the sight of the congregation; but\nthey turned away, and asked for other gods. \u201cThey made a calf in\nHoreb, and worshiped the molten image. Thus they changed their\nglory into the similitude of an ox.\u201d Psalm 106:19, 20. How could\ngreater ingratitude have been shown, or more daring insult offered,\nto Him who had revealed Himself to them as a tender father and an\nall-powerful king!\nMoses in the mount was warned of the apostasy in the camp and[318]\nwas directed to return without delay. \u201cGo, get thee down,\u201d were the\nwords of God; \u201cthy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of\nIdolatry at Sinai 281\nEgypt, have corrupted themselves: they have turned aside quickly\nout of the way which I commanded them. They have made them a\nmolten calf, and have worshiped it.\u201d God might have checked the\nmovement at the outset; but He suffered it to come to this height\nthat He might teach all a lesson in His punishment of treason and\napostasy.\nGod\u2019s covenant with His people had been disannulled, and He\ndeclared to Moses, \u201cLet Me alone, that My wrath may wax hot\nagainst them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee\na great nation.\u201d The people of Israel, especially the mixed multitude,\nwould be constantly disposed to rebel against God. They would also\nmurmur against their leader, and would grieve him by their unbelief\nand stubbornness, and it would be a laborious and soul-trying work\nto lead them through to the Promised Land. Their sins had already\nforfeited the favor of God, and justice called for their destruction.\nThe Lord therefore proposed to destroy them, and make of Moses a\nmighty nation.\n\u201cLet Me alone, ... that I may consume them,\u201d were the words\nof God. If God had purposed to destroy Israel, who could plead for\nthem? How few but would have left the sinners to their fate! How\nfew but would have gladly exchanged a lot of toil and burden and\nsacrifice, repaid with ingratitude and murmuring, for a position of\nease and honor, when it was God Himself that offered the release.\nBut Moses discerned ground for hope where there appeared only\ndiscouragement and wrath. The words of God, \u201cLet Me alone,\u201d he\nunderstood not to forbid but to encourage intercession, implying\nthat nothing but the prayers of Moses could save Israel, but that if\nthus entreated, God would spare His people. He \u201cbesought the Lord\nhis God, and said, Lord, why doth Thy wrath wax hot against Thy\npeople, which Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with\ngreat power, and with a mighty hand?\u201d\nGod had signified that He disowned His people. He had spoken\nof them to Moses as \u201c thy people, which thou broughtest out of\nEgypt.\u201d But Moses humbly disclaimed the leadership of Israel. They\nwere not his, but God\u2019s\u2014\u201cThy people, which Thou has brought forth\n... with great power, and with a mighty hand. Wherefore,\u201d he urged, [319]\n\u201cshould the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did He bring\n282 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthem out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from\nthe face of the earth?\u201d\nDuring the few months since Israel left Egypt, the report of their\nwonderful deliverance had spread to all the surrounding nations. Fear\nand terrible foreboding rested upon the heathen. All were watching\nto see what the God of Israel would do for His people. Should they\nnow be destroyed, their enemies would triumph, and God would be\ndishonored. The Egyptians would claim that their accusations were\ntrue\u2014instead of leading His people into the wilderness to sacrifice,\nHe had caused them to be sacrificed. They would not consider\nthe sins of Israel; the destruction of the people whom He had so\nsignally honored, would bring reproach upon His name. How great\nthe responsibility resting upon those whom God has highly honored,\nto make His name a praise in the earth! With what care should they\nguard against committing sin, to call down His judgments and cause\nHis name to be reproached by the ungodly!\nAs Moses interceded for Israel, his timidity was lost in his deep\ninterest and love for those for whom he had, in the hands of God,\nbeen the means of doing so much. The Lord listened to his pleadings,\nand granted his unselfish prayer. God had proved His servant; He had\ntested his faithfulness and his love for that erring, ungrateful people,\nand nobly had Moses endured the trial. His interest in Israel sprang\nfrom no selfish motive. The prosperity of God\u2019s chosen people\nwas dearer to him than personal honor, dearer than the privilege\nof becoming the father of a mighty nation. God was pleased with\nhis faithfulness, his simplicity of heart, and his integrity, and He\ncommitted to him, as a faithful shepherd, the great charge of leading\nIsrael to the Promised Land.\nAs Moses and Joshua came down from the mount, the former\nbearing the \u201ctables of the testimony,\u201d they heard the shouts and\noutcries of the excited multitude, evidently in a state of wild uproar.\nTo Joshua the soldier, the first thought was of an attack from their\nenemies. \u201cThere is a noise of war in the camp,\u201d he said. But Moses\njudged more truly the nature of the commotion. The sound was\nnot that of combat, but of revelry. \u201cIt is not the voice of them that\nshout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being\novercome; but the noise of them that sing do I hear.\u201d\nAs they drew near the encampment, they beheld the people[320]\nIdolatry at Sinai 283\nshouting and dancing around their idol. It was a scene of heathen\nriot, an imitation of the idolatrous feasts of Egypt; but how unlike\nthe solemn and reverent worship of God! Moses was overwhelmed.\nHe had just come from the presence of God\u2019s glory, and though he\nhad been warned of what was taking place, he was unprepared for\nthat dreadful exhibition of the degradation of Israel. His anger was\nhot. To show his abhorrence of their crime, he threw down the tables\nof stone, and they were broken in the sight of all the people, thus\nsignifying that as they had broken their covenant with God, so God\nhad broken His covenant with them.\nEntering the camp, Moses passed through the crowds of revelers,\nand seizing upon the idol, cast it into the fire. He afterward ground\nit to powder, and having strewed it upon the stream that descended\nfrom the mount, he made the people drink of it. Thus was shown the\nutter worthlessness of the god which they had been worshiping.\nThe great leader summoned his guilty brother and sternly de-\nmanded, \u201cWhat did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought\nso great a sin upon them?\u201d Aaron endeavored to shield himself by\nrelating the clamors of the people; that if he had not complied with\ntheir wishes, he would have been put to death. \u201cLet not the anger of\nmy lord wax hot,\u201d he said; \u201cthou knowest the people, that they are\nset on mischief. For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall\ngo before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out\nof the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. And I said\nunto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they\ngave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.\u201d\nHe would lead Moses to believe that a miracle had been wrought\u2014\nthat the gold had been cast into the fire, and by supernatural power\nchanged to a calf. But his excuses and prevarications were of no\navail. He was justly dealt with as the chief offender.\nThe fact that Aaron had been blessed and honored so far above\nthe people was what made his sin so heinous. It was Aaron \u201cthe saint\nof the Lord\u201d (Psalm 106:16), that had made the idol and announced\nthe feast. It was he who had been appointed as spokesman for\nMoses, and concerning whom God Himself had testified, \u201cI know\nthat he can speak well\u201d (Exodus 4:14), that had failed to check the\nidolaters in their heaven-daring purpose. He by whom God had [321]\n[322]\n[323]\nwrought in bringing judgments both upon the Egyptians and upon\n284 Patriarchs and Prophets\ntheir gods, had heard unmoved the proclamation before the molten\nimage, \u201cThese be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out\nof the land of Egypt.\u201d It was he who had been with Moses on the\nmount, and had there beheld the glory of the Lord, who had seen\nthat in the manifestation of that glory there was nothing of which an\nimage could be made\u2014it was he who had changed that glory into the\nsimilitude of an ox. He to whom God had committed the government\nof the people in the absence of Moses, was found sanctioning their\nrebellion. \u201cThe Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed\nhim.\u201d Deuteronomy 9:20. But in answer to the earnest intercession\nof Moses, his life was spared; and in penitence and humiliation for\nhis great sin, he was restored to the favor of God.\nIf Aaron had had courage to stand for the right, irrespective of\nconsequences, he could have prevented that apostasy. If he had\nunswervingly maintained his own allegiance to God, if he had cited\nthe people to the perils of Sinai, and had reminded them of their\nsolemn covenant with God to obey His law, the evil would have been\nchecked. But his compliance with the desires of the people and the\ncalm assurance with which he proceeded to carry out their plans,\nemboldened them to go to greater lengths in sin than had before\nentered their minds.\nWhen Moses, on returning to the camp, confronted the rebels,\nhis severe rebukes and the indignation he displayed in breaking\nthe sacred tables of the law were contrasted by the people with his\nbrother\u2019s pleasant speech and dignified demeanor, and their sym-\npathies were with Aaron. To justify himself, Aaron endeavored to\nmake the people responsible for his weakness in yielding to their de-\nmand; but notwithstanding this, they were filled with admiration of\nhis gentleness and patience. But God seeth not as man sees. Aaron\u2019s\nyielding spirit and his desire to please had blinded his eyes to the\nenormity of the crime he was sanctioning. His course in giving his\ninfluence to sin in Israel cost the life of thousands. In what contrast\nwith this was the course of Moses, who, while faithfully executing\nGod\u2019s judgments, showed that the welfare of Israel was dearer to\nhim than prosperity or honor or life.\nOf all the sins that God will punish, none are more grievous in\nHis sight than those that encourage others to do evil. God would have[324]\nHis servants prove their loyalty by faithfully rebuking transgression,\nIdolatry at Sinai 285\nhowever painful the act may be. Those who are honored with a\ndivine commission are not to be weak, pliant time-servers. They are\nnot to aim at self-exaltation, or to shun disagreeable duties, but to\nperform God\u2019s work with unswerving fidelity.\nThough God had granted the prayer of Moses in sparing Israel\nfrom destruction, their apostasy was to be signally punished. The\nlawlessness and insubordination into which Aaron had permitted\nthem to fall, if not speedily crushed, would run riot in wickedness,\nand would involve the nation in irretrievable ruin. By terrible severity\nthe evil must be put away. Standing in the gate of the camp, Moses\ncalled to the people, \u201cWho is on the Lord\u2019s side? let him come unto\nme.\u201d Those who had not joined in the apostasy were to take their\nposition at the right of Moses; those who were guilty but repentant,\nat the left. The command was obeyed. It was found that the tribe\nof Levi had taken no part in the idolatrous worship. From among\nother tribes there were great numbers who, although they had sinned,\nnow signified their repentance. But a large company, mostly of the\nmixed multitude that instigated the making of the calf, stubbornly\npersisted in their rebellion. In the name of \u201cthe Lord God of Israel,\u201d\nMoses now commanded those upon his right hand, who had kept\nthemselves clear of idolatry, to gird on their swords and slay all\nwho persisted in rebellion. \u201cAnd there fell of the people that day\nabout three thousand men.\u201d Without regard to position, kindred, or\nfriendship, the ringleaders in wickedness were cut off; but all who\nrepented and humbled themselves were spared.\nThose who performed this terrible work of judgment were acting\nby divine authority, executing the sentence of the King of heaven.\nMen are to beware how they, in their human blindness, judge and\ncondemn their fellow men; but when God commands them to ex-\necute His sentence upon iniquity, He is to be obeyed. Those who\nperformed this painful act, thus manifested their abhorrence of re-\nbellion and idolatry, and consecrated themselves more fully to the\nservice of the true God. The Lord honored their faithfulness by\nbestowing special distinction upon the tribe of Levi.\nThe Israelites had been guilty of treason, and that against a King\nwho had loaded them with benefits and whose authority they had\nvoluntarily pledged themselves to obey. That the divine government [325]\nmight be maintained justice must be visited upon the traitors. Yet\n286 Patriarchs and Prophets\neven here God\u2019s mercy was displayed. While He maintained His\nlaw, He granted freedom of choice and opportunity for repentance\nto all. Only those were cut off who persisted in rebellion.\nIt was necessary that this sin should be punished, as a testimony\nto surrounding nations of God\u2019s displeasure against idolatry. By\nexecuting justice upon the guilty, Moses, as God\u2019s instrument, must\nleave on record a solemn and public protest against their crime. As\nthe Israelites should hereafter condemn the idolatry of the neighbor-\ning tribes, their enemies would throw back upon them the charge\nthat the people who claimed Jehovah as their God had made a calf\nand worshiped it in Horeb. Then though compelled to acknowledge\nthe disgraceful truth, Israel could point to the terrible fate of the\ntransgressors, as evidence that their sin had not been sanctioned or\nexcused.\nLove no less than justice demanded that for this sin judgment\nshould be inflicted. God is the guardian as well as the sovereign of\nHis people. He cuts off those who are determined upon rebellion,\nthat they may not lead others to ruin. In sparing the life of Cain,\nGod had demonstrated to the universe what would be the result of\npermitting sin to go unpunished. The influence exerted upon his\ndescendants by his life and teaching led to the state of corruption\nthat demanded the destruction of the whole world by a flood. The\nhistory of the antediluvians testifies that long life is not a blessing to\nthe sinner; God\u2019s great forbearance did not repress their wickedness.\nThe longer men lived, the more corrupt they became.\nSo with the apostasy at Sinai. Unless punishment had been\nspeedily visited upon transgression, the same results would again\nhave been seen. The earth would have become as corrupt as in the\ndays of Noah. Had these transgressors been spared, evils would\nhave followed, greater than resulted from sparing the life of Cain. It\nwas the mercy of God that thousands should suffer, to prevent the\nnecessity of visiting judgments upon millions. In order to save the\nmany, He must punish the few. Furthermore, as the people had cast\noff their allegiance to God, they had forfeited the divine protection,\nand, deprived of their defense, the whole nation was exposed to the\npower of their enemies. Had not the evil been promptly put away,\nthey would soon have fallen a prey to their numerous and powerful\nfoes. It was necessary for the good of Israel, and also as a lesson to[326]\nIdolatry at Sinai 287\nall succeeding generations, that crime should be promptly punished.\nAnd it was no less a mercy to the sinners themselves that they should\nbe cut short in their evil course. Had their life been spared, the same\nspirit that led them to rebel against God would have been manifested\nin hatred and strife among themselves, and they would eventually\nhave destroyed one another. It was in love to the world, in love to\nIsrael, and even to the transgressors, that crime was punished with\nswift and terrible severity.\nAs the people were roused to see the enormity of their guilt,\nterror pervaded the entire encampment. It was feared that every\noffender was to be cut off. Pitying their distress, Moses promised to\nplead once more with God for them.\n\u201cYe have sinned a great sin,\u201d he said, \u201cand now I will go up unto\nthe Lord; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.\u201d He\nwent, and in his confession before God he said, \u201cOh, this people\nhave sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. Yet now if\nThou wilt forgive their sin\u2014; and if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of\nThy book which Thou hast written.\u201d The answer was, \u201cWhosoever\nhath sinned against Me, him will I blot out of My book. Therefore\nnow go, lead the people into the place of which I have spoken unto\nthee: behold, Mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless, in the\nday when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.\u201d\nIn the prayer of Moses our minds are directed to the heavenly\nrecords in which the names of all men are inscribed, and their deeds,\nwhether good or evil, are faithfully registered. The book of life\ncontains the names of all who have ever entered the service of God.\nIf any of these depart from Him, and by stubborn persistence in sin\nbecome finally hardened against the influences of His Holy Spirit,\ntheir names will in the judgment be blotted from the book of life,\nand they themselves will be devoted to destruction. Moses realized\nhow dreadful would be the fate of the sinner; yet if the people of\nIsrael were to be rejected by the Lord, he desired his name to be\nblotted out with theirs; he could not endure to see the judgments\nof God fall upon those who had been so graciously delivered. The\nintercession of Moses in behalf of Israel illustrates the mediation of\nChrist for sinful men. But the Lord did not permit Moses to bear,\nas did Christ, the guilt of the transgressor. \u201cWhosoever hath sinned [327]\nagainst Me,\u201d He said, \u201chim will I blot out of My book.\u201d\n288 Patriarchs and Prophets\nIn deep sadness the people had buried their dead. Three thousand\nhad fallen by the sword; a plague had soon after broken out in the\nencampment; and now the message came to them that the divine\nPresence would no longer accompany them in their journeyings.\nJehovah had declared, \u201cI will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou\nart a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.\u201d And the\ncommand was given, \u201cPut off thy ornaments from thee, that I may\nknow what to do unto thee.\u201d Now there was mourning throughout the\nencampment. In penitence and humiliation \u201cthe children of Israel\nstripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.\u201d\nBy the divine direction the tent that had served as a temporary\nplace of worship was removed \u201cafar off from the camp.\u201d This was\nstill further evidence that God had withdrawn His presence from\nthem. He would reveal Himself to Moses, but not to such a people.\nThe rebuke was keenly felt, and to the conscience-smitten multi-\ntudes it seemed a foreboding of greater calamity. Had not the Lord\nseparated Moses from the camp that He might utterly destroy them?\nBut they were not left without hope. The tent was pitched without\nthe encampment, but Moses called it \u201cthe tabernacle of the congre-\ngation.\u201d All who were truly penitent, and desired to return to the\nLord, were directed to repair thither to confess their sins and seek\nHis mercy. When they returned to their tents Moses entered the\ntabernacle. With agonizing interest the people watched for some\ntoken that his intercessions in their behalf were accepted. If God\nshould condescend to meet with him, they might hope that they were\nnot to be utterly consumed. When the cloudy pillar descended, and\nstood at the entrance of the tabernacle, the people wept for joy, and\nthey \u201crose up and worshiped, every man in his tent door.\u201d\nMoses knew well the perversity and blindness of those who were\nplaced under his care; he knew the difficulties with which he must\ncontend. But he had learned that in order to prevail with the people,\nhe must have help from God. He pleaded for a clearer revelation of\nGod\u2019s will and for an assurance of His presence: \u201cSee, Thou sayest\nunto me, Bring up this people: and Thou hast not let me know whom\nThou wilt send with me. Yet Thou hast said, I know thee by name,[328]\nand thou hast also found grace in My sight. Now therefore, I pray\nThee, if I have found grace in Thy sight, show me now Thy way, that\nIdolatry at Sinai 289\nI may know Thee, that I may find grace in Thy sight: and consider\nthat this nation is Thy people.\u201d\nThe answer was, \u201cMy presence shall go with thee, and I will\ngive thee rest.\u201d But Moses was not yet satisfied. There pressed upon\nhis soul a sense of the terrible results should God leave Israel to\nhardness and impenitence. He could not endure that his interests\nshould be separated from those of his brethren, and he prayed that\nthe favor of God might be restored to His people, and that the token\nof His presence might continue to direct their journeyings: \u201cIf Thy\npresence go not with me, carry us not up hence. For wherein shall it\nbe known here that I and Thy people have found grace in Thy sight?\nis it not in that Thou goest with us? So shall we be separated, I and\nThy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.\u201d\nAnd the Lord said, \u201cI will do this thing also that thou hast spoken:\nfor thou hast found grace in My sight, and I know thee by name.\u201d\nStill the prophet did not cease pleading. Every prayer had been\nanswered, but he thirsted for greater tokens of God\u2019s favor. He\nnow made a request that no human being had ever made before: \u201cI\nbeseech Thee, show me Thy glory.\u201d\nGod did not rebuke his request as presumptuous; but the gracious\nwords were spoken, \u201cI will make all My goodness pass before thee.\u201d\nThe unveiled glory of God, no man in this mortal state can look upon\nand live; but Moses was assured that he should behold as much of\nthe divine glory as he could endure. Again he was summoned to the\nmountain summit; then the hand that made the world, that hand that\n\u201cremoveth the mountains, and they know not\u201d (Job 9:5), took this\ncreature of the dust, this mighty man of faith, and placed him in a\ncleft of the rock, while the glory of God and all His goodness passed\nbefore him.\nThis experience\u2014above all else the promise that the divine Pres-\nence would attend him\u2014was to Moses an assurance of success in\nthe work before him; and he counted it of infinitely greater worth\nthan all the learning of Egypt or all his attainments as a statesman or\na military leader. No earthly power or skill or learning can supply\nthe place of God\u2019s abiding presence.\nTo the transgressor it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of [329]\nthe living God; but Moses stood alone in the presence of the Eternal\nOne, and he was not afraid; for his soul was in harmony with the will\n290 Patriarchs and Prophets\nof his Maker. Says the psalmist, \u201cIf I regard iniquity in my heart,\nthe Lord will not hear me.\u201d Psalm 66:18. But \u201cthe secret of the Lord\nis with them that fear Him; and He will show them His covenant.\u201d\nPsalm 25:14.\nThe Deity proclaimed Himself, \u201cThe Lord, The Lord God, merci-\nful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,\nkeeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression\nand sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty.\u201d\n\u201cMoses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and\nworshiped.\u201d Again he entreated that God would pardon the iniquity\nof His people, and take them for His inheritance. His prayer was\ngranted. The Lord graciously promised to renew His favor to Israel,\nand in their behalf to do marvels such as had not been done \u201cin all\nthe earth, nor in any nation.\u201d\nForty days and nights Moses remained in the mount; and during\nall this time, as at the first, he was miraculously sustained. No man\nhad been permitted to go up with him, nor during the time of his\nabsence were any to approach the mount. At God\u2019s command he\nhad prepared two tables of stone, and had taken them with him to\nthe summit; and again the Lord \u201cwrote upon the tables the words of\nthe covenant, the Ten Commandments.\u201d [See Appendix, note 5.]\nDuring that long time spent in communion with God, the face of\nMoses had reflected the glory of the divine Presence; unknown to\nhimself his face shone with a dazzling light when he descended from\nthe mountain. Such a light illumined the countenance of Stephen\nwhen brought before his judges; \u201cand all that sat in the council,\nlooking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face\nof an angel.\u201d Acts 6:15. Aaron as well as the people shrank away\nfrom Moses, and \u201cthey were afraid to come nigh him.\u201d Seeing their\nconfusion and terror, but ignorant of the cause, he urged them to\ncome near. He held out to them the pledge of God\u2019s reconciliation,\nand assured them of His restored favor. They perceived in his voice\nnothing but love and entreaty, and at last one ventured to approach\nhim. Too awed to speak, he silently pointed to the countenance of\nMoses, and then toward heaven. The great leader understood his[330]\nmeaning. In their conscious guilt, feeling themselves still under the\ndivine displeasure, they could not endure the heavenly light, which,\nhad they been obedient to God, would have filled them with joy.\nIdolatry at Sinai 291\nThere is fear in guilt. The soul that is free from sin will not wish to\nhide from the light of heaven.\nMoses had much to communicate to them; and compassionat-\ning their fear, he put a veil upon his face, and continued to do so\nthereafter whenever he returned to the camp from communion with\nGod.\nBy this brightness God designed to impress upon Israel the\nsacred, exalted character of His law, and the glory of the gospel\nrevealed through Christ. While Moses was in the mount, God pre-\nsented to him, not only the tables of the law, but also the plan of\nsalvation. He saw that the sacrifice of Christ was pre-figured by all\nthe types and symbols of the Jewish age; and it was the heavenly\nlight streaming from Calvary, no less than the glory of the law of\nGod, that shed such a radiance upon the face of Moses. That di-\nvine illumination symbolized the glory of the dispensation of which\nMoses was the visible mediator, a representative of the one true\nIntercessor.\nThe glory reflected in the countenance of Moses illustrates the\nblessings to be received by God\u2019s commandment-keeping people\nthrough the mediation of Christ. It testifies that the closer our com-\nmunion with God, and the clearer our knowledge of His require-\nments, the more fully shall we be conformed to the divine image,\nand the more readily do we become partakers of the divine nature.\nMoses was a type of Christ. As Israel\u2019s intercessor veiled his\ncountenance, because the people could not endure to look upon\nits glory, so Christ, the divine Mediator, veiled His divinity with\nhumanity when He came to earth. Had He come clothed with the\nbrightness of heaven, He could not have found access to men in their\nsinful state. They could not have endured the glory of His presence.\nTherefore He humbled Himself, and was made \u201cin the likeness of\nsinful flesh\u201d (Romans 8:3), that He might reach the fallen race, and\nlift them up.\nChapter 29\u2014Satan\u2019s Enmity Against the Law[331]\nThe very first effort of Satan to overthrow God\u2019s law\u2014under-\ntaken among the sinless inhabitants of heaven\u2014seemed for a time to\nbe crowned with success. A vast number of the angels were seduced;\nbut Satan\u2019s apparent triumph resulted in defeat and loss, separation\nfrom God, and banishment from heaven.\nWhen the conflict was renewed upon the earth, Satan again won\na seeming advantage. By transgression, man became his captive, and\nman\u2019s kingdom also was betrayed into the hands of the archrebel.\nNow the way seemed open for Satan to establish an independent\nkingdom, and to defy the authority of God and His Son. But the\nplan of salvation made it possible for man again to be brought into\nharmony with God, and to render obedience to His law, and for both\nman and the earth to be finally redeemed from the power of the\nwicked one.\nAgain Satan was defeated, and again he resorted to deception, in\nthe hope of converting his defeat into a victory. To stir up rebellion in\nthe fallen race, he now represented God as unjust in having permitted\nman to transgress His law. \u201cWhy,\u201d said the artful tempter, \u201cwhen\nGod knew what would be the result, did He permit man to be placed\non trial, to sin, and bring in misery and death?\u201d And the children of\nAdam, forgetful of the long-suffering mercy that had granted man\nanother trial, regardless of the amazing, the awful sacrifice which\nhis rebellion had cost the King of heaven, gave ear to the tempter,\nand murmured against the only Being who could save them from\nthe destructive power of Satan.\nThere are thousands today echoing the same rebellious complaint\nagainst God. They do not see that to deprive man of the freedom of\nchoice would be to rob him of his prerogative as an intelligent being,\nand make him a mere automaton. It is not God\u2019s purpose to coerce\nthe will. Man was created a free moral agent. Like the inhabitants of[332]\nall other worlds, he must be subjected to the test of obedience; but\nhe is never brought into such a position that yielding to evil becomes\n292\nSatan\u2019s Enmity Against the Law 293\na matter of necessity. No temptation or trial is permitted to come to\nhim which he is unable to resist. God made such ample provision\nthat man need never have been defeated in the conflict with Satan.\nAs men increased upon the earth, almost the whole world joined\nthe ranks of rebellion. Once more Satan seemed to have gained\nthe victory. But omnipotent power again cut short the working of\niniquity, and the earth was cleansed by the Flood from its moral\npollution.\nSays the prophet, \u201cWhen Thy judgments are in the earth, the in-\nhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. Let favor be showed\nto the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness, ... and will not\nbehold the majesty of Jehovah.\u201d Isaiah 26:9, 10. Thus it was after\nthe Flood. Released from His judgments, the inhabitants of the\nearth again rebelled against the Lord. Twice God\u2019s covenant and\nHis statutes had been rejected by the world. Both the people before\nthe Flood and the descendants of Noah cast off the divine author-\nity. Then God entered into covenant with Abraham, and took to\nHimself a people to become the depositaries of His law. To seduce\nand destroy this people, Satan began at once to lay his snares. The\nchildren of Jacob were tempted to contract marriages with the hea-\nthen and to worship their idols. But Joseph was faithful to God,\nand his fidelity was a constant testimony to the true faith. It was to\nquench this light that Satan worked through the envy of Joseph\u2019s\nbrothers to cause him to be sold as a slave in a heathen land. God\noverruled events, however, so that the knowledge of Himself should\nbe given to the people of Egypt. Both in the house of Potiphar and\nin the prison Joseph received an education and training that, with\nthe fear of God, prepared him for his high position as prime minister\nof the nation. From the palace of the Pharaohs his influence was\nfelt throughout the land, and the knowledge of God spread far and\nwide. The Israelites in Egypt also became prosperous and wealthy,\nand such as were true to God exerted a widespread influence. The\nidolatrous priests were filled with alarm as they saw the new religion\nfinding favor. Inspired by Satan with his own enmity toward the God\nof heaven, they set themselves to quench the light. To the priests\nwas committed the education of the heir to the throne, and it was [333]\nthis spirit of determined opposition to God and zeal for idolatry that\n294 Patriarchs and Prophets\nmolded the character of the future monarch, and led to cruelty and\noppression toward the Hebrews.\nDuring the forty years after the flight of Moses from Egypt,\nidolatry seemed to have conquered. Year by year the hopes of the\nIsraelites grew fainter. Both king and people exulted in their power,\nand mocked the God of Israel. This grew until it culminated in the\nPharaoh who was confronted by Moses. When the Hebrew leader\ncame before the king with a message from \u201cJehovah, God of Israel,\u201d\nit was not ignorance of the true God, but defiance of His power, that\nprompted the answer, \u201cWho is Jehovah, that I should obey His voice?\n... I know not Jehovah.\u201d From first to last, Pharaoh\u2019s opposition to\nthe divine command was not the result of ignorance, but of hatred\nand defiance.\nThough the Egyptians had so long rejected the knowledge of\nGod, the Lord still gave them opportunity for repentance. In the\ndays of Joseph, Egypt had been an asylum for Israel; God had\nbeen honored in the kindness shown His people; and now the long-\nsuffering One, slow to anger, and full of compassion, gave each\njudgment time to do its work; the Egyptians, cursed through the very\nobjects they had worshiped, had evidence of the power of Jehovah,\nand all who would, might submit to God and escape His judgments.\nThe bigotry and stubbornness of the king resulted in spreading the\nknowledge of God, and bringing many of the Egyptians to give\nthemselves to His service.\nIt was because the Israelites were so disposed to connect them-\nselves with the heathen and imitate their idolatry that God had per-\nmitted them to go down into Egypt, where the influence of Joseph\nwas widely felt, and where circumstances were favorable for them\nto remain a distinct people. Here also the gross idolatry of the\nEgyptians and their cruelty and oppression during the latter part of\nthe Hebrew sojourn should have inspired in them an abhorrence of\nidolatry, and should have led them to flee for refuge to the God of\ntheir fathers. This very providence Satan made a means to serve his\npurpose, darkening the minds of the Israelites and leading them to\nimitate the practices of their heathen masters. On account of the su-\nperstitious veneration in which animals were held by the Egyptians,\nthe Hebrews were not permitted, during their bondage, to present[334]\nthe sacrificial offerings. Thus their minds were not directed by this\nSatan\u2019s Enmity Against the Law 295\nservice to the great Sacrifice, and their faith was weakened. When\nthe time came for Israel\u2019s deliverance, Satan set himself to resist the\npurposes of God. It was his determination that that great people,\nnumbering more than two million souls, should be held in ignorance\nand superstition. The people whom God had promised to bless and\nmultiply, to make a power in the earth, and through whom He was\nto reveal the knowledge of His will\u2014the people whom He was to\nmake the keepers of His law\u2014this very people Satan was seeking to\nkeep in obscurity and bondage, that he might obliterate from their\nminds the remembrance of God.\nWhen the miracles were wrought before the king, Satan was on\nthe ground to counteract their influence and prevent Pharaoh from\nacknowledging the supremacy of God and obeying His mandate.\nSatan wrought to the utmost of his power to counterfeit the work of\nGod and resist His will. The only result was to prepare the way for\ngreater exhibitions of the divine power and glory, and to make more\napparent, both to the Israelites and to all Egypt, the existence and\nsovereignty of the true and living God.\nGod delivered Israel with the mighty manifestations of His\npower, and with judgments upon all the gods of Egypt. \u201cHe brought\nforth His people with joy, and His chosen with gladness: ... that they\nmight observe His statutes, and keep His laws.\u201d Psalm 105:43-45.\nHe rescued them from their servile state, that He might bring them\nto a good land\u2014a land which in His providence had been prepared\nfor them as a refuge from their enemies, where they might dwell\nunder the shadow of His wings. He would bring them to Himself,\nand encircle them in His everlasting arms; and in return for all His\ngoodness and mercy to them they were required to have no other\ngods before Him, the living God, and to exalt His name and make it\nglorious in the earth.\nDuring the bondage in Egypt many of the Israelites had, to a\ngreat extent, lost the knowledge of God\u2019s law, and had mingled its\nprecepts with heathen customs and traditions. God brought them to\nSinai, and there with His own voice declared His law.\nSatan and evil angels were on the ground. Even while God was\nproclaiming His law to His people, Satan was plotting to tempt them\nto sin. This people whom God had chosen, he would wrench away,\nin the very face of Heaven. By leading them into idolatry, he would [335]\n296 Patriarchs and Prophets\ndestroy the efficacy of all worship; for how can man be elevated by\nadoring what is no higher than himself and may be symbolized by\nhis own handiwork? If men could become so blinded to the power,\nthe majesty, and the glory of the infinite God as to represent Him by\na graven image, or even by a beast or reptile; if they could so forget\ntheir own divine relationship, formed in the image of their Maker\nas to bow down to these revolting and senseless objects\u2014then the\nway was open for foul license; the evil passions of the heart would\nbe unrestrained, and Satan would have full sway.\nAt the very foot of Sinai, Satan began to execute his plans for\noverthrowing the law of God, thus carrying forward the same work\nhe had begun in heaven. During the forty days while Moses was in\nthe mount with God, Satan was busy exciting doubt, apostasy, and\nrebellion. While God was writing down His law, to be committed to\nHis covenant people, the Israelites, denying their loyalty to Jehovah,\nwere demanding gods of gold! When Moses came from the awful\npresence of the divine glory, with the precepts of the law which they\nhad pledged themselves to obey, he found them, in open defiance of\nits commands, bowing in adoration before a golden image.\nBy leading Israel to this daring insult and blasphemy to Jeho-\nvah, Satan had planned to cause their ruin. Since they had proved\nthemselves to be so utterly degraded, so lost to all sense of the priv-\nileges and blessings that God had offered them, and to their own\nsolemn and repeated pledges of loyalty, the Lord would, he believed,\ndivorce them from Himself and devote them to destruction. Thus\nwould be secured the extinction of the seed of Abraham, that seed\nof promise that was to preserve the knowledge of the living God,\nand through whom He was to come\u2014the true Seed, that was to\nconquer Satan. The great rebel had planned to destroy Israel, and\nthus thwart the purposes of God. But again he was defeated. Sinful\nas they were, the people of Israel were not destroyed. While those\nwho stubbornly ranged themselves on the side of Satan were cut off,\nthe people, humbled and repentant, were mercifully pardoned. The\nhistory of this sin was to stand as a perpetual testimony to the guilt\nand punishment of idolatry, and the justice and long-suffering mercy\nof God.\nThe whole universe had been witness to the scenes at Sinai. In\nthe working out of the two administrations was seen the contrast[336]\nSatan\u2019s Enmity Against the Law 297\nbetween the government of God and that of Satan. Again the sinless\ninhabitants of other worlds beheld the results of Satan\u2019s apostasy,\nand the kind of government he would have established in heaven\nhad he been permitted to bear sway.\nBy causing men to violate the second commandment, Satan\naimed to degrade their conceptions of the Divine Being. By setting\naside the fourth, he would cause them to forget God altogether.\nGod\u2019s claim to reverence and worship, above the gods of the heathen,\nis based upon the fact that He is the Creator, and that to Him all\nother beings owe their existence. Thus it is presented in the Bible.\nSays the prophet Jeremiah: \u201cThe Lord is the true God, He is the\nliving God, and an everlasting King.... The gods that have not made\nthe heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and\nfrom under these heavens. He hath made the earth by His power,\nHe hath established the world by His wisdom, and hath stretched\nout the heavens by His discretion.\u201d \u201cEvery man is brutish in his\nknowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for\nhis molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. They\nare vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they\nshall perish. The portion of Jacob is not like them: for He is the\nformer of all things.\u201d Jeremiah 10:10-12, 14-16. The Sabbath, as a\nmemorial of God\u2019s creative power, points to Him as the maker of the\nheavens and the earth. Hence it is a constant witness to His existence\nand a reminder of His greatness, His wisdom, and His love. Had\nthe Sabbath always been sacredly observed, there could never have\nbeen an atheist or an idolater.\nThe Sabbath institution, which originated in Eden, is as old\nas the world itself. It was observed by all the patriarchs, from\ncreation down. During the bondage in Egypt, the Israelites were\nforced by their taskmasters to violate the Sabbath, and to a great\nextent they lost the knowledge of its sacredness. When the law was\nproclaimed at Sinai the very first words of the fourth commandment\nwere, \u201cRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy\u201d\u2014showing that\nthe Sabbath was not then instituted; we are pointed back for its origin\nto creation. In order to obliterate God from the minds of men, Satan\naimed to tear down this great memorial. If men could be led to forget\ntheir Creator, they would make no effort to resist the power of evil,\nand Satan would be sure of his prey.\n298 Patriarchs and Prophets\nSatan\u2019s enmity against God\u2019s law had impelled him to war against[337]\nevery precept of the Decalogue. To the great principle of love and\nloyalty to God, the Father of all, the principle of filial love and\nobedience is closely related. Contempt for parental authority will\nsoon lead to contempt for the authority of God. Hence Satan\u2019s efforts\nto lessen the obligation of the fifth commandment. Among heathen\npeoples the principle enjoined in this precept was little heeded. In\nmany nations parents were abandoned or put to death as soon as\nage had rendered them incapable of providing for themselves. In\nthe family the mother was treated with little respect, and upon the\ndeath of her husband she was required to submit to the authority\nof her eldest son. Filial obedience was enjoined by Moses; but as\nthe Israelites departed from the Lord, the fifth commandment, with\nothers, came to be disregarded.\nSatan was \u201ca murderer from the beginning\u201d (John 8:44); and as\nsoon as he had obtained power over the human race, he not only\nprompted them to hate and slay one another, but, the more boldly\nto defy the authority of God, he made the violation of the sixth\ncommandment a part of their religion.\nBy perverted conceptions of divine attributes, heathen nations\nwere led to believe human sacrifices necessary to secure the favor of\ntheir deities; and the most horrible cruelties have been perpetrated\nunder the various forms of idolatry. Among these was the practice\nof causing their children to pass through the fire before their idols.\nWhen one of them came through this ordeal unharmed, the people\nbelieved that their offerings were accepted; the one thus delivered\nwas regarded as specially favored by the gods, was loaded with bene-\nfits, and ever afterward held in high esteem; and however aggravated\nhis crimes, he was never punished. But should one be burned in\npassing through the fire, his fate was sealed; it was believed that the\nanger of the gods could be appeased only by taking the life of the\nvictim, and he was accordingly offered as a sacrifice. In times of\ngreat apostasy these abominations prevailed, to some extent, among\nthe Israelites.\nThe violation of the seventh commandment also was early prac-\nticed in the name of religion. The most licentious and abominable\nrites were made a part of the heathen worship. The gods themselves[338]\nwere represented as impure, and their worshipers gave the rein to the\nSatan\u2019s Enmity Against the Law 299\nbaser passions. Unnatural vices prevailed and the religious festivals\nwere characterized by universal and open impurity.\nPolygamy was practiced at an early date. It was one of the sins\nthat brought the wrath of God upon the antediluvian world. Yet after\nthe Flood it again became widespread. It was Satan\u2019s studied effort\nto pervert the marriage institution, to weaken its obligations and\nlessen its sacredness; for in no surer way could he deface the image\nof God in man and open the door to misery and vice.\nFrom the opening of the great controversy it has been Satan\u2019s\npurpose to misrepresent God\u2019s character and to excite rebellion\nagainst His law, and this work appears to be crowned with success.\nThe multitudes give ear to Satan\u2019s deceptions and set themselves\nagainst God. But amid the working of evil, God\u2019s purposes move\nsteadily forward to their accomplishment; to all created intelligences\nHe is making manifest His justice and benevolence. Through Satan\u2019s\ntemptations the whole human race have become transgressors of\nGod\u2019s law, but by the sacrifice of His Son a way is opened whereby\nthey may return to God. Through the grace of Christ they may be\nenabled to render obedience to the Father\u2019s law. Thus in every age,\nfrom the midst of apostasy and rebellion, God gathers out a people\nthat are true to Him\u2014a people \u201cin whose heart is His law.\u201d Isaiah\n51:7.\nIt was by deception that Satan seduced angels; thus he has in all\nages carried forward his work among men, and he will continue this\npolicy to the last. Should he openly profess to be warring against\nGod and His law, men would beware; but he disguises himself, and\nmixes truth with error. The most dangerous falsehoods are those\nthat are mingled with truth. It is thus that errors are received that\ncaptivate and ruin the soul. By this means Satan carries the world\nwith him. But a day is coming when his triumph will be forever\nended.\nGod\u2019s dealings with rebellion will result in fully unmasking the\nwork that has so long been carried on under cover. The results of\nSatan\u2019s rule, the fruits of setting aside the divine statutes, will be\nlaid open to the view of all created intelligences. The law of God\nwill stand fully vindicated. It will be seen that all the dealings of [339]\nGod have been conducted with reference to the eternal good of His\npeople, and the good of all the worlds that He has created. Satan\n300 Patriarchs and Prophets\nhimself, in the presence of the witnessing universe, will confess the\njustice of God\u2019s government and the righteousness of His law.\nThe time is not far distant when God will arise to vindicate His\ninsulted authority. \u201cThe Lord cometh out of His place to punish\nthe inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.\u201d Isaiah 26:21. \u201cBut\nwho may abide the day of His coming? and who shall stand when\nHe appeareth?\u201d Malachi 3:2. The people of Israel, because of their\nsinfulness, were forbidden to approach the mount when God was\nabout to descend upon it to proclaim His law, lest they should be\nconsumed by the burning glory of His presence. If such manifes-\ntations of His power marked the place chosen for the proclamation\nof God\u2019s law, how terrible must be His tribunal when He comes for\nthe execution of these sacred statutes. How will those who have\ntrampled upon His authority endure His glory in the great day of\nfinal retribution? The terrors of Sinai were to represent to the people\nthe scenes of the judgment. The sound of a trumpet summoned Israel\nto meet with God. The voice of the Archangel and the trump of God\nshall summon, from the whole earth, both the living and the dead\nto the presence of their Judge. The Father and the Son, attended by\na multitude of angels, were present upon the mount. At the great\njudgment day Christ will come \u201cin the glory of His Father with His\nangels.\u201d Matthew 16:27. He shall then sit upon the throne of His\nglory, and before Him shall be gathered all nations.\nWhen the divine Presence was manifested upon Sinai, the glory\nof the Lord was like devouring fire in the sight of all Israel. But\nwhen Christ shall come in glory with His holy angels the whole\nearth shall be ablaze with the terrible light of His presence. \u201cOur\nGod shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before\nHim, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him. He shall\ncall to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that He may judge\nHis people.\u201d Psalm 50:3, 4. A fiery stream shall issue and come\nforth from before Him, which shall cause the elements to melt with\nfervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein shall be\nburned up. \u201cThe Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His\nmighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know [340]\nnot God, and that obey not the gospel.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 1:7, 8.\nNever since man was created had there been witnessed such a\nmanifestation of divine power as when the law was proclaimed from\nSatan\u2019s Enmity Against the Law 301\nSinai. \u201cThe earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence\nof God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the\nGod of Israel.\u201d Psalm 68:8. Amid the most terrific convulsions of\nnature the voice of God, like a trumpet, was heard from the cloud.\nThe mountain was shaken from base to summit, and the hosts of\nIsrael, pale and trembling with terror, lay upon their faces upon the\nearth. He whose voice then shook the earth has declared, \u201cYet once\nmore I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.\u201d Hebrews 12:26.\nSays the Scripture, \u201cThe Lord shall roar from on high, and utter\nHis voice from His holy habitation;\u201d \u201cand the heavens and the earth\nshall shake.\u201d Jeremiah 25:30; Joel 3:16. In that great coming day,\nthe heaven itself shall depart \u201cas a scroll when it is rolled together.\u201d\nRevelation 6:14. And every mountain and island shall be moved out\nof its place. \u201cThe earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and\nshall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall\nbe heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.\u201d Isaiah 24:20.\n\u201cTherefore shall all hands be faint,\u201d all faces shall be \u201cturned\ninto paleness,\u201d \u201cand every man\u2019s heart shall melt. And they shall\nbe afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them.\u201d \u201cAnd I will\npunish the world for their evil,\u201d saith the Lord, \u201cand I will cause the\narrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of\nthe terrible.\u201d Isaiah 13:7, 8, 11; Jeremiah 30:6.\nWhen Moses came from the divine Presence in the mount, where\nhe had received the tables of the testimony, guilty Israel could not\nendure the light that glorified his countenance. How much less can\ntransgressors look upon the Son of God when He shall appear in the\nglory of His Father, surrounded by all the heavenly host, to execute\njudgment upon the transgressors of His law and the rejecters of His\natonement. Those who have disregarded the law of God and trodden\nunder foot the blood of Christ, \u201cthe kings of the earth, and the great\nmen, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men,\u201d\nshall hide themselves \u201cin the dens and in the rocks of the mountains,\u201d\nand they shall say to the mountains and rocks, \u201cFall on us, and hide [341]\nus from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath\nof the Lamb: for the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall\nbe able to stand?\u201d Revelation 6:15-17. \u201cIn that day a man shall cast\nhis idols of silver, and his idols of gold, ... to the moles and to the\nbats; to go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged\n302 Patriarchs and Prophets\nrocks, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty, when\nHe ariseth to shake terribly the earth.\u201d Isaiah 2:20, 21.\nThen it will be seen that Satan\u2019s rebellion against God has re-\nsulted in ruin to himself and to all that chose to become his subjects.\nHe has represented that great good would result from transgression;\nbut it will be seen that \u201cthe wages of sin is death.\u201d \u201cFor, behold, the\nday cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and\nall that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall\nburn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither\nroot nor branch.\u201d Malachi 4:1. Satan, the root of every sin, and all\nevil workers, who are his branches, shall be utterly cut off. An end\nwill be made of sin, with all the woe and ruin that have resulted from\nit. Says the psalmist, \u201cThou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast\nput out their name forever and ever. O thou enemy, destructions are\ncome to a perpetual end.\u201d Psalm 9:5, 6.\nBut amid the tempest of divine judgment the children of God\nwill have no cause for fear. \u201cThe Lord will be the hope of His people,\nand the strength of the children of Israel.\u201d Joel 3:16. The day that\nbrings terror and destruction to the transgressors of God\u2019s law will\nbring to the obedient \u201cjoy unspeakable and full of glory\u201d \u201cGather\nMy saints together unto Me,\u201d saith the Lord, \u201cthose that have made\na covenant with Me by sacrifice. And the heavens shall declare His\nrighteousness: for God is Judge Himself.\u201d\n\u201cThen shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the\nwicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him\nnot.\u201d Malachi 3:18. \u201cHearken unto Me, ye that know righteousness,\nthe people in whose heart is My law .\u201d \u201cBehold, I have taken out\nof thine hand the cup of trembling, ... thou shalt no more drink it\nagain.\u201d \u201cI, even I, am He that comforteth you.\u201d Isaiah 51:7, 22, 12.\n\u201cFor the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but My\nkindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of My[342]\npeace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.\u201d Isaiah\n54:10.\nThe great plan of redemption results in fully bringing back the\nworld into God\u2019s favor. All that was lost by sin is restored. Not\nonly man but the earth is redeemed, to be the eternal abode of the\nobedient. For six thousand years Satan has struggled to maintain\npossession of the earth. Now God\u2019s original purpose in its creation is\nSatan\u2019s Enmity Against the Law 303\naccomplished. \u201cThe saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom,\nand possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.\u201d Daniel\n7:18.\n\u201cFrom the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same\nthe Lord\u2019s name is to be praised.\u201d Psalm 113:3. \u201cIn that day shall\nthere be one Lord, and His name one.\u201d \u201cAnd Jehovah shall be king\nover all the earth.\u201d Zechariah 14:9. Says the Scripture, \u201cForever, O\nLord, Thy word is settled in heaven.\u201d \u201cAll His commandments are\nsure. They stand fast forever and ever.\u201d Psalm 119:89; 111:7, 8. The\nsacred statutes which Satan has hated and sought to destroy, will be\nhonored throughout a sinless universe. And \u201cas the earth bringeth\nforth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it\nto spring forth; so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise\nto spring forth before all nations.\u201d Isaiah 61:11.\nChapter 30\u2014The Tabernacle and Its Services[343]\nThis chapter is based on Exodus 25 to 40; Leviticus 4 and 16.\nThe command was communicated to Moses while in the mount\nwith God, \u201cLet them make Me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among\nthem;\u201d and full directions were given for the construction of the\ntabernacle. By their apostasy the Israelites forfeited the blessing\nof the divine Presence, and for the time rendered impossible the\nerection of a sanctuary for God among them. But after they were\nagain taken into favor with Heaven, the great leader proceeded to\nexecute the divine command.\nChosen men were especially endowed by God with skill and\nwisdom for the construction of the sacred building. God Himself\ngave to Moses the plan of that structure, with particular directions as\nto its size and form, the materials to be employed, and every article of\nfurniture which it was to contain. The holy places made with hands\nwere to be \u201cfigures of the true,\u201d \u201cpatterns of things in the heavens\u201d\n(Hebrews 9:24, 23)\u2014a miniature representation of the heavenly\ntemple where Christ, our great High Priest, after offering His life\nas a sacrifice, was to minister in the sinner\u2019s behalf. God presented\nbefore Moses in the mount a view of the heavenly sanctuary, and\ncommanded him to make all things according to the pattern shown\nhim. All these directions were carefully recorded by Moses, who\ncommunicated them to the leaders of the people.\nFor the building of the sanctuary great and expensive prepara-\ntions were necessary; a large amount of the most precious and costly\nmaterial was required; yet the Lord accepted only freewill offerings.\n\u201cOf every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take\nMy offering\u201d was the divine command repeated by Moses to the\ncongregation. Devotion to God and a spirit of sacrifice were the first\nrequisites in preparing a dwelling place for the Most High.\nAll the people responded with one accord. \u201cThey came, every[344]\none whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made\n304\nTabernacle and Its Services 305\nwilling, and they brought the Lord\u2019s offering to the work of the\ntabernacle of the congregation, and for all His service, and for the\nholy garments. And they came, both men and women, as many as\nwere willinghearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings,\nand tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered, offered\nan offering of gold unto the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cAnd every man with whom was found blue, and purple, and\nscarlet, and fine linen, and goats\u2019 hair, and rams\u2019 skins dyed red, and\nsealskins, brought them. Everyone that did offer an offering of silver\nand brass brought the Lord\u2019s offering: and every man, with whom\nwas found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.\n\u201cAnd all the women that were wisehearted did spin with their\nhands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, and the\npurple, the scarlet, and the fine linen. And all the women whose\nheart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats\u2019 hair.\n\u201cAnd the rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be\nset, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; and the spice, and the oil;\nfor the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.\u201d\nExodus 35:23-28, R.V .\nWhile the building of the sanctuary was in progress the people,\nold and young\u2014men, women, and children\u2014continued to bring\ntheir offerings, until those in charge of the work found that they had\nenough, and even more than could be used. And Moses caused to be\nproclaimed throughout the camp, \u201cLet neither man nor woman make\nany more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were\nrestrained from bringing.\u201d The murmurings of the Israelites and the\nvisitations of God\u2019s judgments because of their sins are recorded\nas a warning to after-generations. And their devotion, their zeal\nand liberality, are an example worthy of imitation. All who love\nthe worship of God and prize the blessing of His sacred presence\nwill manifest the same spirit of sacrifice in preparing a house where\nHe may meet with them. They will desire to bring to the Lord an\noffering of the very best that they possess. A house built for God\nshould not be left in debt, for He is thereby dishonored. An amount\nsufficient to accomplish the work should be freely given, that the\nworkmen may be able to say, as did the builders of the tabernacle, [345]\n[346]\n[347]\n\u201cBring no more offerings.\u201d\n306 Patriarchs and Prophets\nThe tabernacle was so constructed that it could be taken apart\nand borne with the Israelites in all their journeyings. It was therefore\nsmall, being not more than fifty-five feet in length, and eighteen in\nbreadth and height. Yet it was a magnificent structure. The wood\nemployed for the building and its furniture was that of the acacia tree,\nwhich was less subject to decay than any other to be obtained at Sinai.\nThe walls consisted of upright boards, set in silver sockets, and held\nfirm by pillars and connecting bars; and all were overlaid with gold,\ngiving to the building the appearance of solid gold. The roof was\nformed of four sets of curtains, the innermost of \u201cfine twined linen,\nand blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work;\u201d\nthe other three respectively were of goats\u2019 hair, rams\u2019 skins dyed\nred, and sealskins, so arranged as to afford complete protection.\nThe building was divided into two apartments by a rich and\nbeautiful curtain, or veil, suspended from gold-plated pillars; and\na similar veil closed the entrance of the first apartment. These,\nlike the inner covering, which formed the ceiling, were of the most\ngorgeous colors, blue, purple, and scarlet, beautifully arranged,\nwhile inwrought with threads of gold and silver were cherubim to\nrepresent the angelic host who are connected with the work of the\nheavenly sanctuary and who are ministering spirits to the people of\nGod on earth.\nThe sacred tent was enclosed in an open space called the court,\nwhich was surrounded by hangings, or screens, of fine linen, sus-\npended from pillars of brass. The entrance to this enclosure was\nat the eastern end. It was closed by curtains of costly material and\nbeautiful workmanship, though inferior to those of the sanctuary.\nThe hangings of the court being only about half as high as the walls\nof the tabernacle, the building could be plainly seen by the people\nwithout. In the court, and nearest the entrance, stood the brazen altar\nof burnt offering. Upon this altar were consumed all the sacrifices\nmade by fire unto the Lord, and its horns were sprinkled with the\natoning blood. Between the altar and the door of the tabernacle was\nthe laver, which was also of brass, made from the mirrors that had\nbeen the freewill offering of the women of Israel. At the laver the\npriests were to wash their hands and their feet whenever they went[348]\ninto the sacred apartments, or approached the altar to offer a burnt\noffering unto the Lord.\nTabernacle and Its Services 307\nIn the first apartment, or holy place, were the table of showbread,\nthe candlestick, or lampstand, and the altar of incense. The table of\nshowbread stood on the north. With its ornamental crown, it was\noverlaid with pure gold. On this table the priests were each Sabbath\nto place twelve cakes, arranged in two piles, and sprinkled with\nfrankincense. The loaves that were removed, being accounted holy,\nwere to be eaten by the priests. On the south was the seven-branched\ncandlestick, with its seven lamps. Its branches were ornamented\nwith exquisitely wrought flowers, resembling lilies, and the whole\nwas made from one solid piece of gold. There being no windows in\nthe tabernacle, the lamps were never all extinguished at one time, but\nshed their light by day and by night. Just before the veil separating\nthe holy place from the most holy and the immediate presence of\nGod, stood the golden altar of incense. Upon this altar the priest\nwas to burn incense every morning and evening; its horns were\ntouched with the blood of the sin offering, and it was sprinkled with\nblood upon the great Day of Atonement. The fire upon this altar\nwas kindled by God Himself and was sacredly cherished. Day and\nnight the holy incense diffused its fragrance throughout the sacred\napartments, and without, far around the tabernacle.\nBeyond the inner veil was the holy of holies, where centered the\nsymbolic service of atonement and intercession, and which formed\nthe connecting link between heaven and earth. In this apartment\nwas the ark, a chest of acacia wood, overlaid within and without\nwith gold, and having a crown of gold about the top. It was made\nas a depository for the tables of stone, upon which God Himself\nhad inscribed the Ten Commandments. Hence it was called the\nark of God\u2019s testament, or the ark of the covenant, since the Ten\nCommandments were the basis of the covenant made between God\nand Israel.\nThe cover of the sacred chest was called the mercy seat. This\nwas wrought of one solid piece of gold, and was surmounted by\ngolden cherubim, one standing on each end. One wing of each angel\nwas stretched forth on high, while the other was folded over the\nbody (see Ezekiel 1:11) in token of reverence and humility. The\nposition of the cherubim, with their faces turned toward each other, [349]\nand looking reverently downward toward the ark, represented the\n308 Patriarchs and Prophets\nreverence with which the heavenly host regard the law of God and\ntheir interest in the plan of redemption.\nAbove the mercy seat was the Shekinah, the manifestation of\nthe divine Presence; and from between the cherubim, God made\nknown His will. Divine messages were sometimes communicated\nto the high priest by a voice from the cloud. Sometimes a light fell\nupon the angel at the right, to signify approval or acceptance, or a\nshadow or cloud rested upon the one at the left to reveal disapproval\nor rejection.\nThe law of God, enshrined within the ark, was the great rule\nof righteousness and judgment. That law pronounced death upon\nthe transgressor; but above the law was the mercy seat, upon which\nthe presence of God was revealed, and from which, by virtue of\nthe atonement, pardon was granted to the repentant sinner. Thus in\nthe work of Christ for our redemption, symbolized by the sanctuary\nservice, \u201cmercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace\nhave kissed each other.\u201d Psalm 85:10.\nNo language can describe the glory of the scene presented within\nthe sanctuary\u2014the gold-plated walls reflecting the light from the\ngolden candlestick, the brilliant hues of the richly embroidered\ncurtains with their shining angels, the table, and the altar of incense,\nglittering with gold; beyond the second veil the sacred ark, with\nits mystic cherubim, and above it the holy Shekinah, the visible\nmanifestation of Jehovah\u2019s presence; all but a dim reflection of the\nglories of the temple of God in heaven, the great center of the work\nfor man\u2019s redemption.\nA period of about half a year was occupied in the building of\nthe tabernacle. When it was completed, Moses examined all the\nwork of the builders, comparing it with the pattern shown him in\nthe mount and the directions he had received from God. \u201cAs the\nLord had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed\nthem.\u201d With eager interest the multitudes of Israel crowded around to\nlook upon the sacred structure. While they were contemplating the\nscene with reverent satisfaction, the pillar of cloud floated over the\nsanctuary and, descending, enveloped it. \u201cAnd the glory of the Lord\nfilled the tabernacle.\u201d There was a revealing of the divine majesty,\nand for a time even Moses could not enter. With deep emotion the[350]\npeople beheld the token that the work of their hands was accepted.\nTabernacle and Its Services 309\nThere were no loud demonstrations of rejoicing. A solemn awe\nrested upon all. But the gladness of their hearts welled up in tears\nof joy, and they murmured low, earnest words of gratitude that God\nhad condescended to abide with them.\nBy divine direction the tribe of Levi was set apart for the service\nof the sanctuary. In the earliest times every man was the priest of his\nown household. In the days of Abraham the priesthood was regarded\nas the birthright of the eldest son. Now, instead of the first-born\nof all Israel, the Lord accepted the tribe of Levi for the work of\nthe sanctuary. By this signal honor He manifested His approval\nof their fidelity, both in adhering to His service and in executing\nHis judgments when Israel apostatized in the worship of the golden\ncalf. The priesthood, however, was restricted to the family of Aaron.\nAaron and his sons alone were permitted to minister before the Lord;\nthe rest of the tribe were entrusted with the charge of the tabernacle\nand its furniture, and they were to attend upon the priests in their\nministration, but they were not to sacrifice, to burn incense, or to see\nthe holy things till they were covered.\nIn accordance with their office, a special dress was appointed for\nthe priests. \u201cThou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother,\nfor glory and for beauty,\u201d was the divine direction to Moses. The\nrobe of the common priest was of white linen, and woven in one\npiece. It extended nearly to the feet and was confined about the waist\nby a white linen girdle embroidered in blue, purple, and red. A linen\nturban, or miter, completed his outer costume. Moses at the burning\nbush was directed to put off his sandals, for the ground whereon\nhe stood was holy. So the priests were not to enter the sanctuary\nwith shoes upon their feet. Particles of dust cleaving to them would\ndesecrate the holy place. They were to leave their shoes in the court\nbefore entering the sanctuary, and also to wash both their hands and\ntheir feet before ministering in the tabernacle or at the altar of burnt\noffering. Thus was constantly taught the lesson that all defilement\nmust be put away from those who would approach into the presence\nof God.\nThe garments of the high priest were of costly material and\nbeautiful workmanship, befitting his exalted station. In addition to [351]\nthe linen dress of the common priest, he wore a robe of blue, also\nwoven in one piece. Around the skirt it was ornamented with golden\n310 Patriarchs and Prophets\nbells, and pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet. Outside of this\nwas the ephod, a shorter garment of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and\nwhite. It was confined by a girdle of the same colors, beautifully\nwrought. The ephod was sleeveless, and on its gold-embroidered\nshoulder pieces were set two onyx stones, bearing the names of the\ntwelve tribes of Israel.\nOver the ephod was the breastplate, the most sacred of the\npriestly vestments. This was of the same material as the ephod.\nIt was in the form of a square, measuring a span, and was suspended\nfrom the shoulders by a cord of blue from golden rings. The border\nwas formed of a variety of precious stones, the same that form the\ntwelve foundations of the City of God. Within the border were\ntwelve stones set in gold, arranged in rows of four, and, like those\nin the shoulder pieces, engraved with the names of the tribes. The\nLord\u2019s direction was, \u201cAaron shall bear the names of the children of\nIsrael in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth\nin unto the holy place, for a memorial before the Lord continually.\u201d\nExodus 28:29. So Christ, the great High Priest, pleading His blood\nbefore the Father in the sinner\u2019s behalf, bears upon His heart the\nname of every repentant, believing soul. Says the psalmist, \u201cI am\npoor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me.\u201d Psalm 40:17.\nAt the right and left of the breastplate were two large stones of\ngreat brilliancy. These were known as the Urim and Thummim.\nBy them the will of God was made known through the high priest.\nWhen questions were brought for decision before the Lord, a halo\nof light encircling the precious stone at the right was a token of the\ndivine consent or approval, while a cloud shadowing the stone at the\nleft was an evidence of denial or disapprobation.\nThe miter of the high priest consisted of the white linen turban,\nhaving attached to it by a lace of blue, a gold plate bearing the\ninscription, \u201cHoliness to Jehovah.\u201d Everything connected with the\napparel and deportment of the priests was to be such as to impress\nthe beholder with a sense of the holiness of God, the sacredness of\nHis worship, and the purity required of those who came into His\npresence.\nNot only the sanctuary itself, but the ministration of the priests,[352]\nwas to \u201cserve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things.\u201d\nHebrews 8:5. Thus it was of great importance; and the Lord, through\nTabernacle and Its Services 311\nMoses, gave the most definite and explicit instruction concerning\nevery point of this typical service. The ministration of the sanctuary\nconsisted of two divisions, a daily and a yearly service. The daily\nservice was performed at the altar of burnt offering in the court of\nthe tabernacle and in the holy place; while the yearly service was in\nthe most holy.\nNo mortal eye but that of the high priest was to look upon the\ninner apartment of the sanctuary. Only once a year could the priest\nenter there, and that after the most careful and solemn preparation.\nWith trembling he went in before God, and the people in reverent\nsilence awaited his return, their hearts uplifted in earnest prayer for\nthe divine blessing. Before the mercy seat the high priest made the\natonement for Israel; and in the cloud of glory, God met with him.\nHis stay here beyond the accustomed time filled them with fear, lest\nbecause of their sins or his own he had been slain by the glory of the\nLord.\nThe daily service consisted of the morning and evening burnt\noffering, the offering of sweet incense on the golden altar, and the\nspecial offerings for individual sins. And there were also offerings\nfor Sabbaths, new moons, and special feasts.\nEvery morning and evening a lamb of a year old was burned\nupon the altar, with its appropriate meat offering, thus symbolizing\nthe daily consecration of the nation to Jehovah, and their constant\ndependence upon the atoning blood of Christ. God expressly directed\nthat every offering presented for the service of the sanctuary should\nbe \u201cwithout blemish.\u201d Exodus 12:5. The priests were to examine\nall animals brought as a sacrifice, and were to reject every one in\nwhich a defect was discovered. Only an offering \u201cwithout blemish\u201d\ncould be a symbol of His perfect purity who was to offer Himself\nas \u201ca lamb without blemish and without spot.\u201d 1 Peter 1:19. The\napostle Paul points to these sacrifices as an illustration of what\nthe followers of Christ are to become. He says, \u201cI beseech you\ntherefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your\nbodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your\nreasonable service.\u201d Romans 12:1. We are to give ourselves to the\nservice of God, and we should seek to make the offering as nearly\nperfect as possible. God will not be pleased with anything less than [353]\nthe best we can offer. Those who love Him with all the heart, will\n312 Patriarchs and Prophets\ndesire to give Him the best service of the life, and they will be\nconstantly seeking to bring every power of their being into harmony\nwith the laws that will promote their ability to do His will.\nIn the offering of incense the priest was brought more directly\ninto the presence of God than in any other act of the daily minis-\ntration. As the inner veil of the sanctuary did not extend to the top\nof the building, the glory of God, which was manifested above the\nmercy seat, was partially visible from the first apartment. When the\npriest offered incense before the Lord, he looked toward the ark; and\nas the cloud of incense arose, the divine glory descended upon the\nmercy seat and filled the most holy place, and often so filled both\napartments that the priest was obliged to retire to the door of the\ntabernacle. As in that typical service the priest looked by faith to the\nmercy seat which he could not see, so the people of God are now to\ndirect their prayers to Christ, their great High Priest, who, unseen\nby human vision, is pleading in their behalf in the sanctuary above.\nThe incense, ascending with the prayers of Israel, represents the\nmerits and intercession of Christ, His perfect righteousness, which\nthrough faith is imputed to His people, and which can alone make\nthe worship of sinful beings acceptable to God. Before the veil of\nthe most holy place was an altar of perpetual intercession, before\nthe holy, an altar of continual atonement. By blood and by incense\nGod was to be approached\u2014symbols pointing to the great Mediator,\nthrough whom sinners may approach Jehovah, and through whom\nalone mercy and salvation can be granted to the repentant, believing\nsoul.\nAs the priests morning and evening entered the holy place at\nthe time of incense, the daily sacrifice was ready to be offered upon\nthe altar in the court without. This was a time of intense interest to\nthe worshipers who assembled at the tabernacle. Before entering\ninto the presence of God through the ministration of the priest, they\nwere to engage in earnest searching of heart and confession of sin.\nThey united in silent prayer, with their faces toward the holy place.\nThus their petitions ascended with the cloud of incense, while faith\nlaid hold upon the merits of the promised Saviour prefigured by\nthe atoning sacrifice. The hours appointed for the morning and\nthe evening sacrifice were regarded as sacred, and they came to be[354]\nobserved as the set time for worship throughout the Jewish nation.\nTabernacle and Its Services 313\nAnd when in later times the Jews were scattered as captives in\ndistant lands, they still at the appointed hour turned their faces toward\nJerusalem and offered up their petitions to the God of Israel. In this\ncustom Christians have an example for morning and evening prayer.\nWhile God condemns a mere round of ceremonies, without the spirit\nof worship, He looks with great pleasure upon those who love Him,\nbowing morning and evening to seek pardon for sins committed and\nto present their requests for needed blessings.\nThe showbread was kept ever before the Lord as a perpetual\noffering. Thus it was a part of the daily sacrifice. It was called\nshowbread, or \u201cbread of the presence,\u201d because it was ever before\nthe face of the Lord. It was an acknowledgment of man\u2019s dependence\nupon God for both temporal and spiritual food, and that it is received\nonly through the mediation of Christ. God had fed Israel in the\nwilderness with bread from heaven, and they were still dependent\nupon His bounty, both for temporal food and spiritual blessings.\nBoth the manna and the showbread pointed to Christ, the living\nBread, who is ever in the presence of God for us. He Himself said,\n\u201cI am the living Bread which came down from heaven.\u201d John 6:48-\n51. Frankincense was placed upon the loaves. When the bread\nwas removed every Sabbath, to be replaced by fresh loaves, the\nfrankincense was burned upon the altar as a memorial before God.\nThe most important part of the daily ministration was the service\nperformed in behalf of individuals. The repentant sinner brought\nhis offering to the door of the tabernacle, and, placing his hand\nupon the victim\u2019s head, confessed his sins, thus in figure transferring\nthem from himself to the innocent sacrifice. By his own hand the\nanimal was then slain, and the blood was carried by the priest into\nthe holy place and sprinkled before the veil, behind which was the\nark containing the law that the sinner had transgressed. By this\nceremony the sin was, through the blood, transferred in figure to\nthe sanctuary. In some cases the blood was not taken into the holy\nplace; [See Appendix, note 6.] but the flesh was then to be eaten\nby the priest, as Moses directed the sons of Aaron, saying, \u201cGod\nhath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation.\u201d Leviticus [355]\n10:17. Both ceremonies alike symbolized the transfer of the sin from\nthe penitent to the sanctuary.\n314 Patriarchs and Prophets\nSuch was the work that went on day by day throughout the year.\nThe sins of Israel being thus transferred to the sanctuary, the holy\nplaces were defiled, and a special work became necessary for the\nremoval of the sins. God commanded that an atonement be made\nfor each of the sacred apartments, as for the altar, to \u201ccleanse it, and\nhallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.\u201d Leviticus\n16:19.\nOnce a year, on the great Day of Atonement, the priest entered\nthe most holy place for the cleansing of the sanctuary. The work\nthere performed completed the yearly round of ministration.\nOn the Day of Atonement two kids of the goats were brought\nto the door of the tabernacle, and lots were cast upon them, \u201cone\nlot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat.\u201d The goat upon\nwhich the first lot fell was to be slain as a sin offering for the people.\nAnd the priest was to bring his blood within the veil, and sprinkle\nit upon the mercy seat. \u201cAnd he shall make an atonement for the\nholy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and\nbecause of their transgressions in all their sins; and so shall he do\nfor the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them\nin the midst of their uncleanness.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live\ngoat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel,\nand all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the\nhead of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit\nman into the wilderness: and the goat shall bear upon him all their\niniquities into a land not inhabited.\u201d Not until the goat had been thus\nsent away did the people regard themselves as freed from the burden\nof their sins. Every man was to afflict his soul while the work of\natonement was going forward. All business was laid aside, and the\nwhole congregation of Israel spent the day in solemn humiliation\nbefore God, with prayer, fasting, and deep searching of heart.\nImportant truths concerning the atonement were taught the peo-\nple by this yearly service. In the sin offerings presented during\nthe year, a substitute had been accepted in the sinner\u2019s stead; but\nthe blood of the victim had not made full atonement for the sin. It\nhad only provided a means by which the sin was transferred to the[356]\nsanctuary. By the offering of blood, the sinner acknowledged the\nauthority of the law, confessed the guilt of his transgression, and\nTabernacle and Its Services 315\nexpressed his faith in Him who was to take away the sin of the world;\nbut he was not entirely released from the condemnation of the law.\nOn the Day of Atonement the high priest, having taken an offering\nfor the congregation, went into the most holy place with the blood\nand sprinkled it upon the mercy seat, above the tables of the law.\nThus the claims of the law, which demanded the life of the sinner,\nwere satisfied. Then in his character of mediator the priest took the\nsins upon himself, and, leaving the sanctuary, he bore with him the\nburden of Israel\u2019s guilt. At the door of the tabernacle he laid his\nhands upon the head of the scapegoat and confessed over him \u201call the\niniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all\ntheir sins, putting them upon the head of the goat.\u201d And as the goat\nbearing these sins was sent away, they were, with him, regarded as\nforever separated from the people. Such was the service performed\n\u201cunto the example and shadow of heavenly things.\u201d Hebrews 8:5.\nAs has been stated, the earthly sanctuary was built by Moses\naccording to the pattern shown him in the mount. It was \u201ca figure\nfor the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacri-\nfices;\u201d its two holy places were \u201cpatterns of things in the heavens;\u201d\nChrist, our great High Priest, is \u201ca minister of the sanctuary, and of\nthe true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.\u201d Hebrews\n9:9, 23; 8:2. As in vision the apostle John was granted a view of\nthe temple of God in heaven, he beheld there \u201cseven lamps of fire\nburning before the throne.\u201d He saw an angel \u201chaving a golden censer;\nand there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it\nwith the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before\nthe throne.\u201d Revelation 4:5; 8:3. Here the prophet was permitted to\nbehold the first apartment of the sanctuary in heaven; and he saw\nthere the \u201cseven lamps of fire\u201d and the \u201cgolden altar\u201d represented by\nthe golden candlestick and the altar of incense in the sanctuary on\nearth. Again, \u201cthe temple of God was opened\u201d (Revelation 11:19),\nand he looked within the inner veil, upon the holy of holies. Here he\nbeheld \u201cthe ark of His testament\u201d (Revelation 11:19), represented\nby the sacred chest constructed by Moses to contain the law of God.\nMoses made the earthly sanctuary, \u201caccording to the fashion that [357]\nhe had seen.\u201d Paul declares that \u201cthe tabernacle, and all the vessels\nof the ministry,\u201d when completed, were \u201cthe patterns of things in the\nheavens.\u201d Acts 7:44; Hebrews 9:21, 23. And John says that he saw\n316 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe sanctuary in heaven. That sanctuary, in which Jesus ministers\nin our behalf, is the great original, of which the sanctuary built by\nMoses was a copy.\nThe heavenly temple, the abiding place of the King of kings,\nwhere \u201cthousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand\ntimes ten thousand stood before Him\u201d (Daniel 7:10), that temple\nfilled with the glory of the eternal throne, where seraphim, its shining\nguardians, veil their faces in adoration\u2014no earthly structure could\nrepresent its vastness and its glory. Yet important truths concerning\nthe heavenly sanctuary and the great work there carried forward for\nman\u2019s redemption were to be taught by the earthly sanctuary and its\nservices.\nAfter His ascension, our Saviour was to begin His work as our\nHigh Priest. Says Paul, \u201cChrist is not entered into the holy places\nmade with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven\nitself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.\u201d Hebrews 9:24.\nAs Christ\u2019s ministration was to consist of two great divisions, each\noccupying a period of time and having a distinctive place in the\nheavenly sanctuary, so the typical ministration consisted of two\ndivisions, the daily and the yearly service, and to each a department\nof the tabernacle was devoted.\nAs Christ at His ascension appeared in the presence of God to\nplead His blood in behalf of penitent believers, so the priest in the\ndaily ministration sprinkled the blood of the sacrifice in the holy\nplace in the sinner\u2019s behalf.\nThe blood of Christ, while it was to release the repentant sinner\nfrom the condemnation of the law, was not to cancel the sin; it would\nstand on record in the sanctuary until the final atonement; so in the\ntype the blood of the sin offering removed the sin from the penitent,\nbut it rested in the sanctuary until the Day of Atonement.\nIn the great day of final award, the dead are to be \u201cjudged out\nof those things which were written in the books, according to their\nworks.\u201d Revelation 20:12. Then by virtue of the atoning blood of\nChrist, the sins of all the truly penitent will be blotted from the\nbooks of heaven. Thus the sanctuary will be freed, or cleansed,[358]\nfrom the record of sin. In the type, this great work of atonement,\nor blotting out of sins, was represented by the services of the Day\nof Atonement\u2014the cleansing of the earthly sanctuary, which was\nTabernacle and Its Services 317\naccomplished by the removal, by virtue of the blood of the sin\noffering, of the sins by which it had been polluted.\nAs in the final atonement the sins of the truly penitent are to\nbe blotted from the records of heaven, no more to be remembered\nor come into mind, so in the type they were borne away into the\nwilderness, forever separated from the congregation.\nSince Satan is the originator of sin, the direct instigator of all\nthe sins that caused the death of the Son of God, justice demands\nthat Satan shall suffer the final punishment. Christ\u2019s work for the\nredemption of men and the purification of the universe from sin will\nbe closed by the removal of sin from the heavenly sanctuary and the\nplacing of these sins upon Satan, who will bear the final penalty. So\nin the typical service, the yearly round of ministration closed with\nthe purification of the sanctuary, and the confessing of the sins on\nthe head of the scapegoat.\nThus in the ministration of the tabernacle, and of the temple that\nafterward took its place, the people were taught each day the great\ntruths relative to Christ\u2019s death and ministration, and once each year\ntheir minds were carried forward to the closing events of the great\ncontroversy between Christ and Satan, the final purification of the\nuniverse from sin and sinners.\nChapter 31\u2014The Sin of Nadab and Abihu[359]\nThis chapter is based on Leviticus 10:1-11.\nAfter the dedication of the tabernacle, the priests were conse-\ncrated to their sacred office. These services occupied seven days,\neach marked by special ceremonies. On the eighth day they entered\nupon their ministration. Assisted by his sons, Aaron offered the\nsacrifices that God required, and he lifted up his hands and blessed\nthe people. All had been done as God commanded, and He accepted\nthe sacrifice, and revealed His glory in a remarkable manner; fire\ncame from the Lord and consumed the offering upon the altar. The\npeople looked upon this wonderful manifestation of divine power\nwith awe and intense interest. They saw in it a token of God\u2019s glory\nand favor, and they raised a universal shout of praise and adoration\nand fell on their faces as if in the immediate presence of Jehovah.\nBut soon afterward a sudden and terrible calamity fell upon the\nfamily of the high priest. At the hour of worship, as the prayers and\npraise of the people were ascending to God, two of the sons of Aaron\ntook each his censer and burned fragrant incense thereon, to rise as a\nsweet odor before the Lord. But they transgressed His command by\nthe use of \u201cstrange fire.\u201d For burning the incense they took common\ninstead of the sacred fire which God Himself had kindled, and which\nHe had commanded to be used for this purpose. For this sin a fire\nwent out from the Lord and devoured them in the sight of the people.\nNext to Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu had stood highest in\nIsrael. They had been especially honored by the Lord, having been\npermitted with the seventy elders to behold His glory in the mount.\nBut their transgression was not therefore to be excused or lightly\nregarded. All this rendered their sin more grievous. Because men\nhave received great light, because they have, like the princes of Israel,\nascended to the mount, and been privileged to have communion with\nGod, and to dwell in the light of His glory, let them not flatter[360]\nthemselves that they can afterward sin with impunity, that because\n318\nSin of Nadab and Abihu 319\nthey have been thus honored, God will not be strict to punish their\niniquity. This is a fatal deception. The great light and privileges\nbestowed require returns of virtue and holiness corresponding to\nthe light given. Anything short of this, God cannot accept. Great\nblessings or privileges should never lull to security or carelessness.\nThey should never give license to sin or cause the recipients to feel\nthat God will not be exact with them. All the advantages which\nGod has given are His means to throw ardor into the spirit, zeal into\neffort, and vigor into the carrying out of His holy will.\nNadab and Abihu had not in their youth been trained to habits of\nself-control. The father\u2019s yielding disposition, his lack of firmness\nfor right, had led him to neglect the discipline of his children. His\nsons had been permitted to follow inclination. Habits of self-indul-\ngence, long cherished, obtained a hold upon them which even the\nresponsibility of the most sacred office had not power to break. They\nhad not been taught to respect the authority of their father, and they\ndid not realize the necessity of exact obedience to the requirements\nof God. Aaron\u2019s mistaken indulgence of his sons prepared them to\nbecome the subjects of the divine judgments.\nGod designed to teach the people that they must approach Him\nwith reverence and awe, and in His own appointed manner. He\ncannot accept partial obedience. It was not enough that in this\nsolemn season of worship nearly everything was done as He had\ndirected. God has pronounced a curse upon those who depart from\nHis commandments, and put no difference between common and\nholy things. He declares by the prophet: \u201cWoe unto them that call\nevil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for\ndarkness! ... woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and\nprudent in their own sight! ... which justify the wicked for reward,\nand take away the righteousness of the righteous from him! ... They\nhave cast away the law of the Lord of hosts, and despised the word of\nthe Holy One of Israel.\u201d Isaiah 5:20-24. Let no one deceive himself\nwith the belief that a part of God\u2019s commandments are nonessential,\nor that He will accept a substitute for that which He has required.\nSaid the prophet Jeremiah, \u201cWho is he that saith, and it cometh\nto pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?\u201d Lamentations 3:37.\nGod has placed in His word no command which men may obey or [361]\ndisobey at will and not suffer the consequences. If men choose any\n320 Patriarchs and Prophets\nother path than that of strict obedience, they will find that \u201cthe end\nthereof are the ways of death.\u201d Proverbs 14:12.\n\u201cMoses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his\nsons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die,\n... for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you.\u201d The great leader\nreminded his brother of the words of God, \u201cI will be sanctified in\nthem that come nigh Me, and before all the people I will be glorified.\u201d\nAaron was silent. The death of his sons, cut down without warning,\nin so terrible a sin\u2014a sin which he now saw to be the result of his\nown neglect of duty\u2014wrung the father\u2019s heart with anguish, but he\ngave his feelings no expression. By no manifestation of grief must\nhe seem to sympathize with sin. The congregation must not be led\nto murmur against God.\nThe Lord would teach His people to acknowledge the justice\nof His corrections, that others may fear. There were those in Israel\nwhom the warning of this terrible judgment might save from pre-\nsuming upon God\u2019s forbearance until they, too, should seal their own\ndestiny. The divine rebuke is upon that false sympathy for the sinner\nwhich endeavors to excuse his sin. It is the effect of sin to deaden\nthe moral perceptions, so that the wrongdoer does not realize the\nenormity of transgression, and without the convicting power of the\nHoly Spirit he remains in partial blindness to his sin. It is the duty\nof Christ\u2019s servants to show these erring ones their peril. Those who\ndestroy the effect of the warning by blinding the eyes of sinners to\nthe real character and results of sin often flatter themselves that they\nthus give evidence of their charity; but they are working directly to\noppose and hinder the work of God\u2019s Holy Spirit; they are lulling the\nsinner to rest on the brink of destruction; they are making themselves\npartakers in his guilt and incurring a fearful responsibility for his\nimpenitence. Many, many, have gone down to ruin as the result of\nthis false and deceptive sympathy.\nNadab and Abihu would never have committed that fatal sin had\nthey not first become partially intoxicated by the free use of wine.\nThey understood that the most careful and solemn preparation was\nnecessary before presenting themselves in the sanctuary, where the\ndivine Presence was manifested; but by intemperance they were\ndisqualified for their holy office. Their minds became confused and[362]\ntheir moral perceptions dulled so that they could not discern the\nSin of Nadab and Abihu 321\ndifference between the sacred and the common. To Aaron and his\nsurviving sons was given the warning: \u201cDo not drink wine nor strong\ndrink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of\nthe congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute forever throughout\nyour generations: and that ye may put difference between holy\nand unholy, and between unclean and clean; and that ye may teach\nthe children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken.\u201d\nThe use of spirituous liquors has the effect to weaken the body,\nconfuse the mind, and debase the morals. It prevents men from\nrealizing the sacredness of holy things or the binding force of God\u2019s\nrequirements. All who occupied positions of sacred responsibility\nwere to be men of strict temperance, that their minds might be clear\nto discriminate between right and wrong, that they might possess\nfirmness of principle, and wisdom to administer justice and to show\nmercy.\nThe same obligation rests upon every follower of Christ. The\napostle Peter declares, \u201cYe are a chosen generation, a royal priest-\nhood, an holy nation, a peculiar people.\u201d 1 Peter 2:9. We are required\nby God to preserve every power in the best possible condition, that\nwe may render acceptable service to our Creator. When intoxicants\nare used, the same effects will follow as in the case of those priests\nof Israel. The conscience will lose its sensibility to sin, and a pro-\ncess of hardening to iniquity will most certainly take place, till the\ncommon and the sacred will lose all difference of significance. How\ncan we then meet the standard of the divine requirements?\u201d \u201cKnow\nye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in\nyou, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are\nbought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your\nspirit, which are God\u2019s.\u201d 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20. \u201cWhether therefore\nye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 10:31. To the church of Christ in all ages is addressed\nthe solemn and fearful warning, \u201cIf any man defile the temple of\nGod, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which\ntemple ye are.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:17.\nChapter 32\u2014The Law and the Covenants[363]\nAdam and Eve, at their creation, had a knowledge of the law of\nGod; they were acquainted with its claims upon them; its precepts\nwere written upon their hearts. When man fell by transgression the\nlaw was not changed, but a remedial system was established to bring\nhim back to obedience. The promise of a Saviour was given, and\nsacrificial offerings pointing forward to the death of Christ as the\ngreat sin offering were established. But had the law of God never\nbeen transgressed, there would have been no death, and no need of a\nSaviour; consequently there would have been no need of sacrifices.\nAdam taught his descendants the law of God, and it was handed\ndown from father to son through successive generations. But\nnotwithstanding the gracious provision for man\u2019s redemption, there\nwere few who accepted it and rendered obedience. By transgression\nthe world became so vile that it was necessary to cleanse it by the\nFlood from its corruption. The law was preserved by Noah and\nhis family, and Noah taught his descendants the Ten Command-\nments. As men again departed from God, the Lord chose Abraham,\nof whom He declared, \u201cAbraham obeyed My voice, and kept My\ncharge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.\u201d Genesis\n26:5. To him was given the rite of circumcision, which was a sign\nthat those who received it were devoted to the service of God\u2014a\npledge that they would remain separate from idolatry, and would\nobey the law of God. The failure of Abraham\u2019s descendants to keep\nthis pledge, as shown in their disposition to form alliances with the\nheathen and adopt their practices, was the cause of their sojourn and\nbondage in Egypt. But in their intercourse with idolaters, and their\nforced submission to the Egyptians, the divine precepts became still\nfurther corrupted with the vile and cruel teachings of heathenism.\nTherefore when the Lord brought them forth from Egypt, He came[364]\ndown upon Sinai, enshrouded in glory and surrounded by His angels,\nand in awful majesty spoke His law in the hearing of all the people.\n322\nLaw and the Covenants 323\nHe did not even then trust His precepts to the memory of a people\nwho were prone to forget His requirements, but wrote them upon\ntables of stone. He would remove from Israel all possibility of min-\ngling heathen traditions with His holy precepts, or of confounding\nHis requirements with human ordinances or customs. But He did\nnot stop with giving them the precepts of the Decalogue. The people\nhad shown themselves so easily led astray that He would leave no\ndoor of temptation unguarded. Moses was commanded to write, as\nGod should bid him, judgments and laws giving minute instruction\nas to what was required. These directions relating to the duty of\nthe people to God, to one another, and to the stranger were only\nthe principles of the Ten Commandments amplified and given in a\nspecific manner, that none need err. They were designed to guard\nthe sacredness of the ten precepts engraved on the tables of stone.\nIf man had kept the law of God, as given to Adam after his\nfall, preserved by Noah, and observed by Abraham, there would\nhave been no necessity for the ordinance of circumcision. And\nif the descendants of Abraham had kept the covenant, of which\ncircumcision was a sign, they would never have been seduced into\nidolatry, nor would it have been necessary for them to suffer a life\nof bondage in Egypt; they would have kept God\u2019s law in mind, and\nthere would have been no necessity for it to be proclaimed from\nSinai or engraved upon the tables of stone. And had the people\npracticed the principles of the Ten Commandments, there would\nhave been no need of the additional directions given to Moses.\nThe sacrificial system, committed to Adam, was also perverted\nby his descendants. Superstition, idolatry, cruelty, and licentiousness\ncorrupted the simple and significant service that God had appointed.\nThrough long intercourse with idolaters the people of Israel had\nmingled many heathen customs with their worship; therefore the\nLord gave them at Sinai definite instruction concerning the sacrificial\nservice. After the completion of the tabernacle He communicated\nwith Moses from the cloud of glory above the mercy seat, and gave\nhim full directions concerning the system of offerings and the forms\nof worship to be maintained in the sanctuary. The ceremonial law [365]\nwas thus given to Moses, and by him written in a book. But the law\nof Ten Commandments spoken from Sinai had been written by God\n324 Patriarchs and Prophets\nHimself on the tables of stone, and was sacredly preserved in the\nark.\nThere are many who try to blend these two systems, using the\ntexts that speak of the ceremonial law to prove that the moral law\nhas been abolished; but this is a perversion of the Scriptures. The\ndistinction between the two systems is broad and clear. The cere-\nmonial system was made up of symbols pointing to Christ, to His\nsacrifice and His priesthood. This ritual law, with its sacrifices and\nordinances, was to be performed by the Hebrews until type met\nantitype in the death of Christ, the Lamb of God that taketh away the\nsin of the world. Then all the sacrificial offerings were to cease. It is\nthis law that Christ \u201ctook ... out of the way, nailing it to His cross.\u201d\nColossians 2:14. But concerning the law of Ten Commandments the\npsalmist declares, \u201cForever, O Lord, Thy word is settled in heaven.\u201d\nPsalm 119:89. And Christ Himself says, \u201cThink not that I am come\nto destroy the law.... Verily I say unto you\u201d\u2014making the assertion\nas emphatic as possible\u2014\u201cTill heaven and earth pass, one jot or one\ntittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\u201d Matthew\n5:17, 18. Here He teaches, not merely what the claims of God\u2019s law\nhad been, and were then, but that these claims should hold as long as\nthe heavens and the earth remain. The law of God is as immutable\nas His throne. It will maintain its claims upon mankind in all ages.\nConcerning the law proclaimed from Sinai, Nehemiah says,\n\u201cThou camest down also upon Mount Sinai, and spakest with them\nfrom heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good\nstatutes and commandments.\u201d Nehemiah 9:13. And Paul, \u201cthe apos-\ntle to the Gentiles,\u201d declares, \u201cThe law is holy, and the command-\nment holy, and just, and good.\u201d Romans 7:12. This can be no other\nthan the Decalogue; for it is the law that says, \u201cThou shalt not covet.\u201d\nVerse 7.\nWhile the Saviour\u2019s death brought to an end the law of types\nand shadows, it did not in the least detract from the obligation of\nthe moral law. On the contrary, the very fact that it was necessary\nfor Christ to die in order to atone for the transgression of that law,\nproves it to be immutable.\nThose who claim that Christ came to abrogate the law of God and[366]\nto do away with the Old Testament, speak of the Jewish age as one\nof darkness, and represent the religion of the Hebrews as consisting\nLaw and the Covenants 325\nof mere forms and ceremonies. But this is an error. All through the\npages of sacred history, where the dealings of God with His chosen\npeople are recorded, there are burning traces of the great I AM.\nNever has He given to the sons of men more open manifestations\nof His power and glory than when He alone was acknowledged as\nIsrael\u2019s ruler, and gave the law to His people. Here was a scepter\nswayed by no human hand; and the stately goings forth of Israel\u2019s\ninvisible King were unspeakably grand and awful.\nIn all these revelations of the divine presence the glory of God\nwas manifested through Christ. Not alone at the Saviour\u2019s advent,\nbut through all the ages after the Fall and the promise of redemption,\n\u201cGod was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.\u201d 2 Corinthi-\nans 5:19. Christ was the foundation and center of the sacrificial\nsystem in both the patriarchal and the Jewish age. Since the sin of\nour first parents there has been no direct communication between\nGod and man. The Father has given the world into the hands of\nChrist, that through His mediatorial work He may redeem man and\nvindicate the authority and holiness of the law of God. All the com-\nmunion between heaven and the fallen race has been through Christ.\nIt was the Son of God that gave to our first parents the promise\nof redemption. It was He who revealed Himself to the patriarchs.\nAdam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses understood the\ngospel. They looked for salvation through man\u2019s Substitute and\nSurety. These holy men of old held communion with the Saviour\nwho was to come to our world in human flesh; and some of them\ntalked with Christ and heavenly angels face to face.\nChrist was not only the leader of the Hebrews in the wilderness\u2014\nthe Angel in whom was the name of Jehovah, and who, veiled in the\ncloudy pillar, went before the host\u2014but it was He who gave the law\nto Israel. [See Appendix, note 7.] Amid the awful glory of Sinai,\nChrist declared in the hearing of all the people the ten precepts of\nHis Father\u2019s law. It was He who gave to Moses the law engraved\nupon the tables of stone.\nIt was Christ that spoke to His people through the prophets. The\napostle Peter, writing to the Christian church, says that the prophets [367]\n\u201cprophesied of the grace that should come unto you: searching what,\nor what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did\nsignify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the\n326 Patriarchs and Prophets\nglory that should follow.\u201d 1 Peter 1:10, 11. It is the voice of Christ\nthat speaks to us through the Old Testament. \u201cThe testimony of\nJesus is the spirit of prophecy.\u201d Revelation 19:10.\nIn His teachings while personally among men Jesus directed the\nminds of the people to the Old Testament. He said to the Jews, \u201cYe\nsearch the Scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal\nlife; and these are they which bear witness of Me.\u201d John 5:39, R.V .\nAt this time the books of the Old Testament were the only part of\nthe Bible in existence. Again the Son of God declared, \u201cThey have\nMoses and the prophets; let them hear them.\u201d And He added, \u201cIf\nthey hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded,\nthough one rose from the dead.\u201d Luke 16:29, 31.\nThe ceremonial law was given by Christ. Even after it was no\nlonger to be observed, Paul presented it before the Jews in its true\nposition and value, showing its place in the plan of redemption and\nits relation to the work of Christ; and the great apostle pronounces\nthis law glorious, worthy of its divine Originator. The solemn service\nof the sanctuary typified the grand truths that were to be revealed\nthrough successive generations. The cloud of incense ascending\nwith the prayers of Israel represents His righteousness that alone can\nmake the sinner\u2019s prayer acceptable to God; the bleeding victim on\nthe altar of sacrifice testified of a Redeemer to come; and from the\nholy of holies the visible token of the divine Presence shone forth.\nThus through age after age of darkness and apostasy faith was kept\nalive in the hearts of men until the time came for the advent of the\npromised Messiah.\nJesus was the light of His people\u2014the Light of the world\u2014\nbefore He came to earth in the form of humanity. The first gleam\nof light that pierced the gloom in which sin had wrapped the world,\ncame from Christ. And from Him has come every ray of heaven\u2019s\nbrightness that has fallen upon the inhabitants of the earth. In the\nplan of redemption Christ is the Alpha and the Omega\u2014the First\nand the Last.\nSince the Saviour shed His blood for the remission of sins, and\nascended to heaven \u201cto appear in the presence of God for us\u201d (He-[368]\nbrews 9:24), light has been streaming from the cross of Calvary and\nfrom the holy places of the sanctuary above. But the clearer light\ngranted us should not cause us to despise that which in earlier times\nLaw and the Covenants 327\nwas received through the types pointing to the coming Saviour. The\ngospel of Christ sheds light upon the Jewish economy and gives sig-\nnificance to the ceremonial law. As new truths are revealed, and that\nwhich has been known from the beginning is brought into clearer\nlight, the character and purposes of God are made manifest in His\ndealings with His chosen people. Every additional ray of light that\nwe receive gives us a clearer understanding of the plan of redemp-\ntion, which is the working out of the divine will in the salvation of\nman. We see new beauty and force in the inspired word, and we\nstudy its pages with a deeper and more absorbing interest.\nThe opinion is held by many that God placed a separating wall\nbetween the Hebrews and the outside world; that His care and love,\nwithdrawn to a great extent from the rest of mankind, were centered\nupon Israel. But God did not design that His people should build up\na wall of partition between themselves and their fellow men. The\nheart of Infinite Love was reaching out toward all the inhabitants of\nthe earth. Though they had rejected Him, He was constantly seeking\nto reveal Himself to them and make them partakers of His love and\ngrace. His blessing was granted to the chosen people, that they\nmight bless others.\nGod called Abraham, and prospered and honored him; and the\npatriarch\u2019s fidelity was a light to the people in all the countries of\nhis sojourn. Abraham did not shut himself away from the people\naround him. He maintained friendly relations with the kings of the\nsurrounding nations, by some of whom he was treated with great re-\nspect; and his integrity and unselfishness, his valor and benevolence,\nwere representing the character of God. In Mesopotamia, in Canaan,\nin Egypt, and even to the inhabitants of Sodom, the God of heaven\nwas revealed through His representative.\nSo to the people of Egypt and of all the nations connected with\nthat powerful kingdom, God manifested Himself through Joseph.\nWhy did the Lord choose to exalt Joseph so highly among the Egyp-\ntians? He might have provided some other way for the accomplish-\nment of His purposes toward the children of Jacob; but He desired to\nmake Joseph a light, and He placed him in the palace of the king, that [369]\nthe heavenly illumination might extend far and near. By his wisdom\nand justice, by the purity and benevolence of his daily life, by his\ndevotion to the interests of the people\u2014and that people a nation of\n328 Patriarchs and Prophets\nidolaters\u2014Joseph was a representative of Christ. In their benefactor,\nto whom all Egypt turned with gratitude and praise, that heathen\npeople were to behold the love of their Creator and Redeemer. So\nin Moses also God placed a light beside the throne of the earth\u2019s\ngreatest kingdom, that all who would, might learn of the true and\nliving God. And all this light was given to the Egyptians before the\nhand of God was stretched out over them in judgments.\nIn the deliverance of Israel from Egypt a knowledge of the power\nof God spread far and wide. The warlike people of the stronghold\nof Jericho trembled. \u201cAs soon as we had heard these things,\u201d said\nRahab, \u201cour hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more\ncourage in any man, because of you: for Jehovah your God, He is\nGod in heaven above, and in earth beneath.\u201d Joshua 2:11. Centuries\nafter the exodus the priests of the Philistines reminded their people\nof the plagues of Egypt, and warned them against resisting the God\nof Israel.\nGod called Israel, and blessed and exalted them, not that by obe-\ndience to His law they alone might receive His favor and become\nthe exclusive recipients of His blessings, but in order to reveal Him-\nself through them to all the inhabitants of the earth. It was for the\naccomplishment of this very purpose that He commanded them to\nkeep themselves distinct from the idolatrous nations around them.\nIdolatry and all the sins that followed in its train were abhor-\nrent to God, and He commanded His people not to mingle with\nother nations, to \u201cdo after their works\u201c, and forget God. He forbade\ntheir marriage with idolaters, lest their hearts should be led away\nfrom Him. It was just as necessary then as it is now that God\u2019s\npeople should be pure, \u201cunspotted from the world.\u201d They must keep\nthemselves free from its spirit, because it is opposed to truth and\nrighteousness. But God did not intend that His people, in self-righ-\nteous exclusiveness, should shut themselves away from the world,\nso that they could have no influence upon it.\nLike their Master, the followers of Christ in every age were to\nbe the light of the world. The Saviour said, \u201cA city that is set on an[370]\nhill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a\nbushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in\nthe house\u201d\u2014that is, in the world. And He adds, \u201cLet your light so\nshine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify\nLaw and the Covenants 329\nyour Father which is in heaven.\u201d Matthew 5:14-16. This is just what\nEnoch, and Noah, Abraham, Joseph, and Moses did. It is just what\nGod designed that His people Israel should do.\nIt was their own evil heart of unbelief, controlled by Satan, that\nled them to hide their light, instead of shedding it upon surrounding\npeoples; it was that same bigoted spirit that caused them either to\nfollow the iniquitous practices of the heathen or to shut themselves\naway in proud exclusiveness, as if God\u2019s love and care were over\nthem alone.\nAs the Bible presents two laws, one changeless and eternal, the\nother provisional and temporary, so there are two covenants. The\ncovenant of grace was first made with man in Eden, when after the\nFall there was given a divine promise that the seed of the woman\nshould bruise the serpent\u2019s head. To all men this covenant offered\npardon and the assisting grace of God for future obedience through\nfaith in Christ. It also promised them eternal life on condition of\nfidelity to God\u2019s law. Thus the patriarchs received the hope of\nsalvation.\nThis same covenant was renewed to Abraham in the promise,\n\u201cIn thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.\u201d Genesis\n22:18. This promise pointed to Christ. So Abraham understood it\n(see Galatians 3:8, 16), and he trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of\nsins. It was this faith that was accounted unto him for righteousness.\nThe covenant with Abraham also maintained the authority of God\u2019s\nlaw. The Lord appeared unto Abraham, and said, \u201cI am the Almighty\nGod; walk before Me, and be thou perfect.\u201d Genesis 17:1. The\ntestimony of God concerning His faithful servant was, \u201cAbraham\nobeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My\nstatutes, and My laws.\u201d Genesis 26:5. And the Lord declared to him,\n\u201cI will establish My covenant between Me and thee and thy seed\nafter thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a\nGod unto thee and to thy seed after thee.\u201d Genesis 17:7.\nThough this covenant was made with Adam and renewed to\nAbraham, it could not be ratified until the death of Christ. It had [371]\nexisted by the promise of God since the first intimation of redemption\nhad been given; it had been accepted by faith; yet when ratified by\nChrist, it is called a new covenant. The law of God was the basis of\nthis covenant, which was simply an arrangement for bringing men\n330 Patriarchs and Prophets\nagain into harmony with the divine will, placing them where they\ncould obey God\u2019s law.\nAnother compact\u2014called in Scripture the \u201cold\u201d covenant\u2014was\nformed between God and Israel at Sinai, and was then ratified by the\nblood of a sacrifice. The Abrahamic covenant was ratified by the\nblood of Christ, and it is called the \u201csecond,\u201d or \u201cnew,\u201d covenant,\nbecause the blood by which it was sealed was shed after the blood\nof the first covenant. That the new covenant was valid in the days of\nAbraham is evident from the fact that it was then confirmed both by\nthe promise and by the oath of God\u2014the \u201ctwo immutable things, in\nwhich it was impossible for God to lie.\u201d Hebrews 6:18.\nBut if the Abrahamic covenant contained the promise of redemp-\ntion, why was another covenant formed at Sinai? In their bondage\nthe people had to a great extent lost the knowledge of God and of\nthe principles of the Abrahamic covenant. In delivering them from\nEgypt, God sought to reveal to them His power and His mercy, that\nthey might be led to love and trust Him. He brought them down\nto the Red Sea\u2014where, pursued by the Egyptians, escape seemed\nimpossible\u2014that they might realize their utter helplessness, their\nneed of divine aid; and then He wrought deliverance for them. Thus\nthey were filled with love and gratitude to God and with confidence\nin His power to help them. He had bound them to Himself as their\ndeliverer from temporal bondage.\nBut there was a still greater truth to be impressed upon their\nminds. Living in the midst of idolatry and corruption, they had no\ntrue conception of the holiness of God, of the exceeding sinfulness\nof their own hearts, their utter inability, in themselves, to render\nobedience to God\u2019s law, and their need of a Saviour. All this they\nmust be taught.\nGod brought them to Sinai; He manifested His glory; He gave\nthem His law, with the promise of great blessings on condition of\nobedience: \u201cIf ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant,\nthen ... ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.\u201d\nExodus 19:5, 6. The people did not realize the sinfulness of their[372]\nown hearts, and that without Christ it was impossible for them to\nkeep God\u2019s law; and they readily entered into covenant with God.\nFeeling that they were able to establish their own righteousness, they\ndeclared, \u201cAll that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient.\u201d\nLaw and the Covenants 331\nExodus 24:7. They had witnessed the proclamation of the law in\nawful majesty, and had trembled with terror before the mount; and\nyet only a few weeks passed before they broke their covenant with\nGod, and bowed down to worship a graven image. They could not\nhope for the favor of God through a covenant which they had broken;\nand now, seeing their sinfulness and their need of pardon, they were\nbrought to feel their need of the Saviour revealed in the Abrahamic\ncovenant and shadowed forth in the sacrificial offerings. Now by\nfaith and love they were bound to God as their deliverer from the\nbondage of sin. Now they were prepared to appreciate the blessings\nof the new covenant.\nThe terms of the \u201cold covenant\u201d were, Obey and live: \u201cIf a man\ndo, he shall even live in them\u201d (Ezekiel 20:11; Leviticus 18:5); but\n\u201ccursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do\nthem.\u201d Deuteronomy 27:26. The \u201cnew covenant\u201d was established\nupon \u201cbetter promises\u201d\u2014the promise of forgiveness of sins and of\nthe grace of God to renew the heart and bring it into harmony with\nthe principles of God\u2019s law. \u201cThis shall be the covenant that I will\nmake with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I\nwill put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts....\nI will forgive their iniquity, and will remember their sin no more.\u201d\nJeremiah 31:33, 34.\nThe same law that was engraved upon the tables of stone is writ-\nten by the Holy Spirit upon the tables of the heart. Instead of going\nabout to establish our own righteousness we accept the righteousness\nof Christ. His blood atones for our sins. His obedience is accepted\nfor us. Then the heart renewed by the Holy Spirit will bring forth\n\u201cthe fruits of the Spirit.\u201d Through the grace of Christ we shall live\nin obedience to the law of God written upon our hearts. Having\nthe Spirit of Christ, we shall walk even as He walked. Through the\nprophet He declared of Himself, \u201cI delight to do Thy will, O My\nGod: yea, Thy law is within My heart.\u201d Psalm 40:8. And when\namong men He said, \u201cThe Father hath not left Me alone; for I do\nalways those things that please Him.\u201d John 8:29.\nThe apostle Paul clearly presents the relation between faith and [373]\nthe law under the new covenant. He says: \u201cBeing justified by faith,\nwe have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d \u201cDo we\nthen make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish\n332 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe law.\u201d \u201cFor what the law could not do, in that it was weak through\nthe flesh\u201d\u2014it could not justify man, because in his sinful nature he\ncould not keep the law\u2014\u201cGod sending His own Son in the likeness\nof sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the\nrighteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after\nthe flesh, but after the Spirit.\u201d Romans 5:1; 3:31; 8:3, 4.\nGod\u2019s work is the same in all time, although there are different\ndegrees of development and different manifestations of His power,\nto meet the wants of men in the different ages. Beginning with\nthe first gospel promise, and coming down through the patriarchal\nand Jewish ages, and even to the present time, there has been a\ngradual unfolding of the purposes of God in the plan of redemption.\nThe Saviour typified in the rites and ceremonies of the Jewish law\nis the very same that is revealed in the gospel. The clouds that\nenveloped His divine form have rolled back; the mists and shades\nhave disappeared; and Jesus, the world\u2019s Redeemer, stands revealed.\nHe who proclaimed the law from Sinai, and delivered to Moses the\nprecepts of the ritual law, is the same that spoke the Sermon on the\nMount. The great principles of love to God, which He set forth as the\nfoundation of the law and the prophets, are only a reiteration of what\nHe had spoken through Moses to the Hebrew people: \u201cHear, O Israel:\nThe Lord our God is one Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord thy God\nwith all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 6:4, 5. \u201cThou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d\nLeviticus 19:18. The teacher is the same in both dispensations.\nGod\u2019s claims are the same. The principles of His government are\nthe same. For all proceed from Him \u201cwith whom is no variableness,\nneither shadow of turning.\u201d James 1:17.\nChapter 33\u2014From Sinai to Kadesh [374]\nThis chapter is based on Numbers 11 and 12.\nThe building of the tabernacle was not begun for some time\nafter Israel arrived at Sinai; and the sacred structure was first set\nup at the opening of the second year from the Exodus. This was\nfollowed by the consecration of the priests, the celebration of the\nPassover, the numbering of the people, and the completion of various\narrangements essential to their civil or religious system, so that\nnearly a year was spent in the encampment at Sinai. Here their\nworship had taken a more definite form, the laws had been given for\nthe government of the nation, and a more efficient organization had\nbeen effected preparatory to their entrance into the land of Canaan.\nThe government of Israel was characterized by the most thorough\norganization, wonderful alike for its completeness and its simplicity.\nThe order so strikingly displayed in the perfection and arrangement\nof all God\u2019s created works was manifest in the Hebrew economy.\nGod was the center of authority and government, the sovereign of\nIsrael. Moses stood as their visible leader, by God\u2019s appointment,\nto administer the laws in His name. From the elders of the tribes\na council of seventy was afterward chosen to assist Moses in the\ngeneral affairs of the nation. Next came the priests, who consulted\nthe Lord in the sanctuary. Chiefs, or princes, ruled over the tribes.\nUnder these were \u201ccaptains over thousands, and captains over hun-\ndreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens,\u201d and, lastly,\nofficers who might be employed for special duties. Deuteronomy\n1:15.\nThe Hebrew camp was arranged in exact order. It was separated\ninto three great divisions, each having its appointed position in the\nencampment. In the center was the tabernacle, the abiding place of\nthe invisible King. Around it were stationed the priests and Levites. [375]\nBeyond these were encamped all the other tribes.\n333\n334 Patriarchs and Prophets\nTo the Levites was committed the charge of the tabernacle and\nall that pertained thereto, both in the camp and on the journey. When\nthe camp set forward they were to strike the sacred tent; when a\nhalting place was reached they were to set it up. No person of another\ntribe was allowed to come near, on pain of death. The Levites were\nseparated into three divisions, the descendants of the three sons of\nLevi, and each was assigned its special position and work. In front\nof the tabernacle, and nearest to it, were the tents of Moses and\nAaron. On the south were the Kohathites, whose duty it was to care\nfor the ark and the other furniture; on the north Merarites, who were\nplaced in charge of the pillars, sockets, boards, etc.; in the rear the\nGershonites, to whom the care of the curtains and hangings was\ncommitted.\nThe position of each tribe also was specified. Each was to march\nand to encamp beside its own standard, as the Lord had commanded:\n\u201cEvery man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard,\nwith the ensign of their father\u2019s house: far off about the tabernacle of\nthe congregation shall they pitch.\u201d \u201cAs they encamp, so shall they set\nforward, every man in his place by their standards.\u201d Numbers 2:2,\n17. The mixed multitude that had accompanied Israel from Egypt\nwere not permitted to occupy the same quarters with the tribes, but\nwere to abide upon the outskirts of the camp; and their offspring\nwere to be excluded from the community until the third generation.\nDeuteronomy 23:7, 8.\nScrupulous cleanliness as well as strict order throughout the\nencampment and its environs was enjoined. Thorough sanitary\nregulations were enforced. Every person who was unclean from\nany cause was forbidden to enter the camp. These measures were\nindispensable to the preservation of health among so vast a multitude;\nand it was necessary also that perfect order and purity be maintained,\nthat Israel might enjoy the presence of a holy God. Thus He declared:\n\u201cThe Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee,\nand to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp\nbe holy.\u201d\nIn all the journeyings of Israel, \u201cthe ark of the covenant of the\nLord went before them, ... to search out a resting place for them.\u201d[376]\nNumbers 10:33. Borne by the sons of Kohath, the sacred chest\ncontaining God\u2019s holy law was to lead the van. Before it went Moses\nFrom Sinai to Kadesh 335\nand Aaron; and the priests, bearing silver trumpets, were stationed\nnear. These priests received directions from Moses, which they\ncommunicated to the people by the trumpets. It was the duty of the\nleaders of each company to give definite directions concerning all\nthe movements to be made, as indicated by the trumpets. Whoever\nneglected to comply with the directions given was punished with\ndeath.\nGod is a God of order. Everything connected with heaven is in\nperfect order; subjection and thorough discipline mark the move-\nments of the angelic host. Success can only attend order and harmo-\nnious action. God requires order and system in His work now no\nless than in the days of Israel. All who are working for Him are to\nlabor intelligently, not in a careless, haphazard manner. He would\nhave his work done with faith and exactness, that He may place the\nseal of His approval upon it.\nGod Himself directed the Israelites in all their travels. The place\nof their encampment was indicated by the descent of the pillar of\ncloud; and so long as they were to remain in camp, the cloud rested\nover the tabernacle. When they were to continue their journey it\nwas lifted high above the sacred tent. A solemn invocation marked\nboth the halt and the departure. \u201cIt came to pass, when the ark set\nforward, that Moses said, Rise up, Lord, and let Thine enemies be\nscattered; and let them that hate Thee flee before Thee. And when it\nrested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel.\u201d\nNumbers 10:35, 36.\nA distance of only eleven days\u2019 journey lay between Sinai and\nKadesh, on the borders of Canaan; and it was with the prospect of\nspeedily entering the goodly land that the hosts of Israel resumed\ntheir march when the cloud at last gave the signal for an onward\nmovement. Jehovah had wrought wonders in bringing them from\nEgypt, and what blessings might they not expect now that they had\nformally covenanted to accept Him as their Sovereign, and had been\nacknowledged as the chosen people of the Most High?\nYet it was almost with reluctance that many left the place where\nthey had so long encamped. They had come almost to regard it\nas their home. Within the shelter of those granite walls God had [377]\ngathered His people, apart from all other nations, to repeat to them\nHis holy law. They loved to look upon the sacred mount, on whose\n336 Patriarchs and Prophets\nhoary peaks and barren ridges the divine glory had so often been\ndisplayed. The scene was so closely associated with the presence of\nGod and holy angels that it seemed too sacred to be left thoughtlessly,\nor even gladly.\nAt the signal from the trumpeters, however, the entire camp set\nforward, the tabernacle borne in the midst, and each tribe in its\nappointed position, under its own standard. All eyes were turned\nanxiously to see in what direction the cloud would lead. As it moved\ntoward the east, where were only mountain masses huddled together,\nblack and desolate, a feeling of sadness and doubt arose in many\nhearts.\nAs they advanced, the way became more difficult. Their route\nlay through stony ravine and barren waste. All around them was the\ngreat wilderness\u2014\u201ca land of deserts and of pits,\u201d \u201ca land of drought,\nand of the shadow of death,\u201d \u201ca land that no man passed through,\nand where no man dwelt.\u201d Jeremiah 2:6. The rocky gorges, far and\nnear, were thronged with men, women, and children, with beasts\nand wagons, and long lines of flocks and herds. Their progress was\nnecessarily slow and toilsome; and the multitudes, after their long\nencampment, were not prepared to endure the perils and discomforts\nof the way.\nAfter three days\u2019 journey open complaints were heard. These\noriginated with the mixed multitude, many of whom were not fully\nunited with Israel, and were continually watching for some cause\nof censure. The complainers were not pleased with the direction\nof the march, and they were continually finding fault with the way\nin which Moses was leading them, though they well knew that he,\nas well as they, was following the guiding cloud. Dissatisfaction is\ncontagious, and it soon spread in the encampment.\nAgain they began to clamor for flesh to eat. Though abundantly\nsupplied with manna, they were not satisfied. The Israelites, during\ntheir bondage in Egypt, had been compelled to subsist on the plainest\nand simplest food; but then keen appetite induced by privation and\nhard labor had made it palatable. Many of the Egyptians, however,\nwho were now among them, had been accustomed to a luxurious\ndiet; and these were the first to complain. At the giving of the manna,[378]\njust before Israel reached Sinai, the Lord had granted them flesh in\nanswer to their clamors; but it was furnished them for only one day.\nFrom Sinai to Kadesh 337\nGod might as easily have provided them with flesh as with\nmanna, but a restriction was placed upon them for their good. It was\nHis purpose to supply them with food better suited to their wants\nthan the feverish diet to which many had become accustomed in\nEgypt. The perverted appetite was to be brought into a more healthy\nstate, that they might enjoy the food originally provided for man\u2014\nthe fruits of the earth, which God gave to Adam and Eve in Eden. It\nwas for this reason that the Israelites had been deprived, in a great\nmeasure, of animal food.\nSatan tempted them to regard this restriction as unjust and cruel.\nHe caused them to lust after forbidden things, because he saw that the\nunrestrained indulgence of appetite would tend to produce sensuality,\nand by this means the people could be more easily brought under\nhis control. The author of disease and misery will assail men where\nhe can have the greatest success. Through temptations addressed to\nthe appetite he has, to a large extent, led men into sin from the time\nwhen he induced Eve to eat of the forbidden fruit. It was by this\nsame means that he led Israel to murmur against God. Intemperance\nin eating and drinking, leading as it does to the indulgence of the\nlower passions, prepares the way for men to disregard all moral\nobligations. When assailed by temptation, they have little power of\nresistance.\nGod brought the Israelites from Egypt, that He might establish\nthem in the land of Canaan, a pure, holy, and happy people. In\nthe accomplishment of this object He subjected them to a course\nof discipline, both for their own good and for the good of their\nposterity. Had they been willing to deny appetite, in obedience to His\nwise restrictions, feebleness and disease would have been unknown\namong them. Their descendants would have possessed both physical\nand mental strength. They would have had clear perceptions of\ntruth and duty, keen discrimination, and sound judgment. But their\nunwillingness to submit to the restrictions and requirements of God,\nprevented them, to a great extent, from reaching the high standard\nwhich He desired them to attain, and from receiving the blessings\nwhich He was ready to bestow upon them.\nSays the psalmist: \u201cThey tempted God in their heart by asking [379]\nmeat for their lust. Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can\nGod furnish a table in the wilderness? Behold, He smote the rock,\n338 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthat the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can He give\nbread also? can He provide flesh for His people? Therefore the\nLord heard this, and was wroth.\u201d Psalm 78:18-21. Murmuring and\ntumults had been frequent during the journey from the Red Sea to\nSinai, but in pity for their ignorance and blindness God had not then\nvisited the sin with judgments. But since that time He had revealed\nHimself to them at Horeb. They had received great light, as they had\nbeen witnesses to the majesty, the power, and the mercy of God; and\ntheir unbelief and discontent incurred the greater guilt. Furthermore,\nthey had covenanted to accept Jehovah as their king and to obey His\nauthority. Their murmuring was now rebellion, and as such it must\nreceive prompt and signal punishment, if Israel was to be preserved\nfrom anarchy and ruin. \u201cThe fire of Jehovah burnt among them,\nand consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.\u201d\nThe most guilty of the complainers were slain by lightning from the\ncloud.\nThe people in terror besought Moses to entreat the Lord for them.\nHe did so, and the fire was quenched. In memory of this judgment\nhe called the name of the place Taberah, \u201ca burning.\u201d\nBut the evil was soon worse than before. Instead of leading\nthe survivors to humiliation and repentance, this fearful judgment\nseemed only to increase their murmurings. In all directions the peo-\nple were gathered at the door of their tents, weeping and lamenting.\n\u201cThe mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the\nchildren of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh\nto eat? We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely;\nthe cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and\nthe garlic: but now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all,\nbeside this manna, before our eyes.\u201d Thus they manifested their\ndiscontent with the food provided for them by their Creator. Yet\nthey had constant evidence that it was adapted to their wants; for\nnotwithstanding the hardships they endured, there was not a feeble\none in all their tribes.\nThe heart of Moses sank. He had pleaded that Israel should not\nbe destroyed, even though his own posterity might then become\na great nation. In his love for them he had prayed that his name[380]\nmight be blotted from the book of life rather than that they should\nbe left to perish. He had imperiled all for them, and this was their\nFrom Sinai to Kadesh 339\nresponse. All their hardships, even their imaginary sufferings, they\ncharged upon him; and their wicked murmurings made doubly heavy\nthe burden of care and responsibility under which he staggered. In\nhis distress he was tempted even to distrust God. His prayer was\nalmost a complaint. \u201cWherefore hast Thou afflicted Thy servant?\nand wherefore have I not found favor in Thy sight, that Thou layest\nthe burden of all this people upon me? ... whence should I have flesh\nto give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us\nflesh, that we may eat. I am not able to bear all this people alone,\nbecause it is too heavy for me.\u201d\nThe Lord hearkened to his prayer, and directed him to summon\nseventy men of the elders of Israel\u2014men not only advanced in years,\nbut possessing dignity, sound judgment, and experience. \u201cAnd bring\nthem unto the tabernacle of the congregation,\u201d He said, \u201cthat they\nmay stand there with thee. And I will come down and talk with thee\nthere: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it\nupon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee,\nthat thou bear it not thyself alone.\u201d\nThe Lord permitted Moses to choose for himself the most faithful\nand efficient men to share the responsibility with him. Their influ-\nence would assist in holding in check the violence of the people, and\nquelling insurrection; yet serious evils would eventually result from\ntheir promotion. They would never have been chosen had Moses\nmanifested faith corresponding to the evidences he had witnessed of\nGod\u2019s power and goodness. But he had magnified his own burdens\nand services, almost losing sight of the fact that he was only the\ninstrument by which God had wrought. He was not excusable in\nindulging, in the slightest degree, the spirit of murmuring that was\nthe curse of Israel. Had he relied fully upon God, the Lord would\nhave guided him continually and would have given him strength for\nevery emergency.\nMoses was directed to prepare the people for what God was\nabout to do for them. \u201cSanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and ye\nshall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the Lord, saying, Who\nshall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore\nthe Lord will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. Ye shall not eat one [381]\nday, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;\nbut even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be\n340 Patriarchs and Prophets\nloathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the Lord which\nis among you, and have wept before Him, saying, Why came we\nforth out of Egypt?\u201d\n\u201cThe people, among whom I am,\u201d exclaimed Moses, \u201care six\nhundred thousand footmen; and Thou has said, I will give them flesh,\nthat they may eat a whole month. Shall the flocks and the herds be\nslain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be\ngathered together for them?\u201d\nHe was reproved for his distrust: \u201cIs the Lord\u2019s hand waxed\nshort? thou shalt see now whether My word shall come to pass unto\nthee or not.\u201d\nMoses repeated to the congregation the words of the Lord, and\nannounced the appointment of the seventy elders. The great leader\u2019s\ncharge to these chosen men might well serve as a model of judicial\nintegrity for the judges and legislators of modern times: \u201cHear the\ncauses between your brethren, and judge righteously between every\nman and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. Ye shall not\nrespect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as\nthe great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment\nis God\u2019s.\u201d Deuteronomy 1:16, 17.\nMoses now summoned the seventy to the tabernacle. \u201cAnd the\nLord came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the\nspirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it\ncame to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied,\nand did not cease.\u201d Like the disciples on the Day of Pentecost, they\nwere endued with \u201cpower from on high.\u201d It pleased the Lord thus\nto prepare them for their work, and to honor them in the presence\nof the congregation, that confidence might be established in them\nas men divinely chosen to unite with Moses in the government of\nIsrael.\nAgain evidence was given of the lofty, unselfish spirit of the great\nleader. Two of the seventy, humbly counting themselves unworthy\nof so responsible a position, had not joined their brethren at the\ntabernacle; but the Spirit of God came upon them where they were,\nand they, too, exercised the prophetic gift. On being informed of this,\nJoshua desired to check such irregularity, fearing that it might tend\nto division. Jealous for the honor of his master, \u201cMy lord Moses,\u201d[382]\nhe said, \u201cforbid them.\u201d The answer was, \u201cEnviest thou for my sake?\nFrom Sinai to Kadesh 341\nwould God that all the Lord\u2019s people were prophets, and that the\nLord would put His Spirit upon them.\u201d\nA strong wind blowing from the sea now brought flocks of quails,\n\u201cabout a day\u2019s journey on this side, and a day\u2019s journey on the other\nside, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face\nof the earth.\u201d Numbers 11:31, R.V . All that day and night, and the\nfollowing day, the people labored in gathering the food miraculously\nprovided. Immense quantities were secured. \u201cHe that gathered least\ngathered ten homers.\u201d All that was not needed for present use was\npreserved by drying, so that the supply, as promised, was sufficient\nfor a whole month.\nGod gave the people that which was not for their highest good,\nbecause they persisted in desiring it; they would not be satisfied with\nthose things that would prove a benefit to them. Their rebellious\ndesires were gratified, but they were left to suffer the result. They\nfeasted without restraint, and their excesses were speedily punished.\n\u201cThe Lord smote the people with a very great plague.\u201d Large numbers\nwere cut down by burning fevers, while the most guilty among them\nwere smitten as soon as they tasted the food for which they had\nlusted.\nAt Hazeroth, the next encampment after leaving Taberah, a still\nmore bitter trial awaited Moses. Aaron and Miriam had occupied a\nposition of high honor and leadership in Israel. Both were endowed\nwith the prophetic gift, and both had been divinely associated with\nMoses in the deliverance of the Hebrews. \u201cI sent before thee Moses,\nAaron, and Miriam\u201d (Micah 6:4), are the words of the Lord by the\nprophet Micah. Miriam\u2019s force of character had been early displayed\nwhen as a child she watched beside the Nile the little basket in which\nwas hidden the infant Moses. Her self-control and tact God had\nmade instrumental in preserving the deliverer of His people. Richly\nendowed with the gifts of poetry and music, Miriam had led the\nwomen of Israel in song and dance on the shore of the Red Sea.\nIn the affections of the people and the honor of Heaven she stood\nsecond only to Moses and Aaron. But the same evil that first brought\ndiscord in heaven sprang up in the heart of this woman of Israel, and\nshe did not fail to find a sympathizer in her dissatisfaction.\nIn the appointment of the seventy elders Miriam and Aaron had [383]\nnot been consulted, and their jealousy was excited against Moses.\n342 Patriarchs and Prophets\nAt the time of Jethro\u2019s visit, while the Israelites were on the way to\nSinai, the ready acceptance by Moses of the counsel of his father-\nin-law had aroused in Aaron and Miriam a fear that his influence\nwith the great leader exceeded theirs. In the organization of the\ncouncil of elders they felt that their position and authority had been\nignored. Miriam and Aaron had never known the weight of care\nand responsibility which had rested upon Moses; yet because they\nhad been chosen to aid him they regarded themselves as sharing\nequally with him the burden of leadership, and they regarded the\nappointment of further assistants as uncalled for.\nMoses felt the importance of the great work committed to him\nas no other man had ever felt it. He realized his own weakness,\nand he made God his counselor. Aaron esteemed himself more\nhighly, and trusted less in God. He had failed when entrusted with\nresponsibility, giving evidence of the weakness of his character by\nhis base compliance in the matter of the idolatrous worship at Sinai.\nBut Miriam and Aaron, blinded by jealousy and ambition, lost sight\nof this. Aaron had been highly honored by God in the appointment\nof his family to the sacred office of the priesthood; yet even this\nnow added to the desire for self-exaltation. \u201cAnd they said, Hath\nthe Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? hath He not spoken also by\nus?\u201d Regarding themselves as equally favored by God, they felt that\nthey were entitled to the same position and authority.\nYielding to the spirit of dissatisfaction, Miriam found cause of\ncomplaint in events that God had especially overruled. The marriage\nof Moses had been displeasing to her. That he should choose a\nwoman of another nation, instead of taking a wife from among the\nHebrews, was an offense to her family and national pride. Zipporah\nwas treated with ill-disguised contempt.\nThough called a \u201cCushite woman\u201d (Numbers 12:1, R.V .), the\nwife of Moses was a Midianite, and thus a descendant of Abraham.\nIn personal appearance she differed from the Hebrews in being of\na somewhat darker complexion. Though not an Israelite, Zipporah\nwas a worshiper of the true God. She was of a timid, retiring dispo-\nsition, gentle and affectionate, and greatly distressed at the sight of\nsuffering; and it was for this reason that Moses, when on the way to\nEgypt, had consented to her return to Midian. He desired to spare[384]\nFrom Sinai to Kadesh 343\nher the pain of witnessing the judgments that were to fall on the\nEgyptians.\nWhen Zipporah rejoined her husband in the wilderness, she saw\nthat his burdens were wearing away his strength, and she made\nknown her fears to Jethro, who suggested measures for his relief.\nHere was the chief reason for Miriam\u2019s antipathy to Zipporah. Smart-\ning under the supposed neglect shown to herself and Aaron, she re-\ngarded the wife of Moses as the cause, concluding that her influence\nhad prevented him from taking them into his counsels as formerly.\nHad Aaron stood up firmly for the right, he might have checked the\nevil; but instead of showing Miriam the sinfulness of her conduct,\nhe sympathized with her, listened to her words of complaint, and\nthus came to share her jealousy.\nTheir accusations were borne by Moses in uncomplaining si-\nlence. It was the experience gained during the years of toil and\nwaiting in Midian\u2014the spirit of humility and long-suffering there\ndeveloped\u2014that prepared Moses to meet with patience the unbelief\nand murmuring of the people and the pride and envy of those who\nshould have been his unswerving helpers. Moses \u201cwas very meek,\nabove all the men which were upon the face of the earth,\u201d and this is\nwhy he was granted divine wisdom and guidance above all others.\nSays the Scripture, \u201cThe meek will He guide in judgment: and the\nmeek will He teach His way.\u201d Psalm 25:9. The meek are guided\nby the Lord, because they are teachable, willing to be instructed.\nThey have a sincere desire to know and to do the will of God. The\nSaviour\u2019s promise is, \u201cIf any man will do His will, he shall know\nof the doctrine.\u201d John 7:17. And He declares by the apostle James,\n\u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all\nmen liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\u201d James\n1:5. But His promise is only to those who are willing to follow the\nLord wholly. God does not force the will of any; hence He cannot\nlead those who are too proud to be taught, who are bent upon having\ntheir own way. Of the double-minded man\u2014he who seeks to follow\nhis own will, while professing to do the will of God\u2014it is written,\n\u201cLet not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.\u201d\nJames 1:7.\nGod had chosen Moses, and had put His Spirit upon him; and\nMiriam and Aaron, by their murmurings, were guilty of disloyalty, [385]\n344 Patriarchs and Prophets\nnot only to their appointed leader, but to God Himself. The seditious\nwhisperers were summoned to the tabernacle, and brought face to\nface with Moses. \u201cAnd Jehovah came down in the pillar of the\ncloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and\nMiriam.\u201d Their claim to the prophetic gift was not denied; God might\nhave spoken to them in visions and dreams. But to Moses, whom\nthe Lord Himself declared \u201cfaithful in all Mine house,\u201d a nearer\ncommunion had been granted. With him God spake mouth to mouth.\n\u201cWherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against My servant\nMoses? And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them; and\nHe departed.\u201d The cloud disappeared from the tabernacle in token of\nGod\u2019s displeasure, and Miriam was smitten. She \u201cbecame leprous,\nwhite as snow.\u201d Aaron was spared, but he was severely rebuked in\nMiriam\u2019s punishment. Now, their pride humbled in the dust, Aaron\nconfessed their sin, and entreated that his sister might not be left\nto perish by that loathsome and deadly scourge. In answer to the\nprayers of Moses the leprosy was cleansed. Miriam was, however,\nshut out of the camp for seven days. Not until she was banished from\nthe encampment did the symbol of God\u2019s favor again rest upon the\ntabernacle. In respect for her high position, and in grief at the blow\nthat had fallen upon her, the whole company abode in Hazeroth,\nawaiting her return.\nThis manifestation of the Lord\u2019s displeasure was designed to be\na warning to all Israel, to check the growing spirit of discontent and\ninsubordination. If Miriam\u2019s envy and dissatisfaction had not been\nsignally rebuked, it would have resulted in great evil. Envy is one\nof the most satanic traits that can exist in the human heart, and it is\none of the most baleful in its effects. Says the wise man, \u201cWrath is\ncruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?\u201d\nProverbs 27:4. It was envy that first caused discord in heaven, and\nits indulgence has wrought untold evil among men. \u201cWhere envying\nand strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.\u201d James 3:16.\nIt should not be regarded as a light thing to speak evil of others\nor to make ourselves judges of their motives or actions. \u201cHe that\nspeaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of\nthe law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a\ndoer of the law, but a judge.\u201d James 4:11. There is but one judge\u2014\nHe \u201cwho both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and[386]\nFrom Sinai to Kadesh 345\nwill make manifest the counsels of the hearts.\u201d 1 Corinthians 4:5.\nAnd whoever takes it upon himself to judge and condemn his fellow\nmen is usurping the prerogative of the Creator.\nThe Bible specially teaches us to beware of lightly bringing accu-\nsation against those whom God has called to act as His ambassadors.\nThe apostle Peter, describing a class who are abandoned sinners,\nsays, \u201cPresumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak\nevil of dignities. Whereas angels, which are greater in power and\nmight, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.\u201d 2\nPeter 2:10, 11. And Paul, in his instruction for those who are placed\nover the church, says, \u201cAgainst an elder receive not an accusation,\nbut before two or three witnesses.\u201d 1 Timothy 5:19. He who has\nplaced upon men the heavy responsibility of leaders and teachers\nof His people will hold the people accountable for the manner in\nwhich they treat His servants. We are to honor those whom God\nhas honored. The judgment visited upon Miriam should be a rebuke\nto all who yield to jealousy, and murmur against those upon whom\nGod lays the burden of His work.\nChapter 34\u2014The Twelve Spies[387]\nThis chapter is based on Numbers 13 and 14.\nEleven days after leaving Mount Horeb the Hebrew host en-\ncamped at Kadesh, in the wilderness of Paran, which was not far\nfrom the borders of the Promised Land. Here it was proposed by the\npeople that spies be sent up to survey the country. The matter was\npresented before the Lord by Moses, and permission was granted,\nwith the direction that one of the rulers of each tribe should be se-\nlected for this purpose. The men were chosen as had been directed,\nand Moses bade them go and see the country, what it was, its sit-\nuation and natural advantages; and the people that dwelt therein,\nwhether they were strong or weak, few or many; also to observe the\nnature of the soil and its productiveness and to bring of the fruit of\nthe land.\nThey went, and surveyed the whole land, entering at the southern\nborder and proceeding to the northern extremity. They returned after\nan absence of forty days. The people of Israel were cherishing\nhigh hopes and were waiting in eager expectancy. The news of the\nspies\u2019 return was carried from tribe to tribe and was hailed with\nrejoicing. The people rushed out to meet the messengers, who had\nsafely escaped the dangers of their perilous undertaking. The spies\nbrought specimens of the fruit, showing the fertility of the soil. It\nwas in the time of ripe grapes, and they brought a cluster of grapes\nso large that it was carried between two men. They also brought of\nthe figs and pomegranates which grew there in abundance.\nThe people rejoiced that they were to come into possession of so\ngoodly a land, and they listened intently as the report was brought\nto Moses, that not a word should escape them. \u201cWe came unto the\nland whither thou sentest us,\u201d the spies began, \u201cand surely it floweth\nwith milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.\u201d The people were\nenthusiastic; they would eagerly obey the voice of the Lord, and\ngo up at once to possess the land. But after describing the beauty[388]\n346\nTwelve Spies 347\nand fertility of the land, all but two of the spies enlarged upon the\ndifficulties and dangers that lay before the Israelites should they\nundertake the conquest of Canaan. They enumerated the powerful\nnations located in various parts of the country, and said that the cities\nwere walled and very great, and the people who dwelt therein were\nstrong, and it would be impossible to conquer them. They also stated\nthat they had seen giants, the sons of Anak, there, and it was useless\nto think of possessing the land.\nNow the scene changed. Hope and courage gave place to cow-\nardly despair, as the spies uttered the sentiments of their unbelieving\nhearts, which were filled with discouragement prompted by Satan.\nTheir unbelief cast a gloomy shadow over the congregation, and the\nmighty power of God, so often manifested in behalf of the chosen\nnation, was forgotten. The people did not wait to reflect; they did\nnot reason that He who had brought them thus far would certainly\ngive them the land; they did not call to mind how wonderfully God\nhad delivered them from their oppressors, cutting a path through the\nsea and destroying the pursuing hosts of Pharaoh. They left God out\nof the question, and acted as though they must depend solely on the\npower of arms.\nIn their unbelief they limited the power of God and distrusted\nthe hand that had hitherto safely guided them. And they repeated\ntheir former error of murmuring against Moses and Aaron. \u201cThis,\nthen, is the end of our high hopes,\u201d they said. \u201cThis is the land we\nhave traveled all the way from Egypt to possess.\u201d They accused their\nleaders of deceiving the people and bringing trouble upon Israel.\nThe people were desperate in their disappointment and despair.\nA wail of agony arose and mingled with the confused murmur of\nvoices. Caleb comprehended the situation, and, bold to stand in\ndefense of the word of God, he did all in his power to counteract the\nevil influence of his unfaithful associates. For an instant the people\nwere stilled to listen to his words of hope and courage respecting the\ngoodly land. He did not contradict what had already been said; the\nwalls were high and the Canaanites strong. But God had promised\nthe land to Israel. \u201cLet us go up at once and possess it,\u201d urged Caleb;\n\u201cfor we are well able to overcome it.\u201d\nBut the ten, interrupting him, pictured the obstacles in darker\ncolors than at first. \u201cWe be not able to go up against the people,\u201c\n348 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthey declared; \u201cfor they are stronger than we.... All the people that[389]\nwe saw in it are men of a great stature. And there we saw the giants,\nthe sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own\nsight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.\u201d\nThese men, having entered upon a wrong course, stubbornly set\nthemselves against Caleb and Joshua, against Moses, and against\nGod. Every advance step rendered them the more determined. They\nwere resolved to discourage all effort to gain possession of Canaan.\nThey distorted the truth in order to sustain their baleful influence. It\n\u201cis a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof,\u201d they said. This was\nnot only an evil report, but it was also a lying one. It was inconsistent\nwith itself. The spies had declared the country to be fruitful and\nprosperous, and the people of giant stature, all of which would be\nimpossible if the climate were so unhealthful that the land could be\nsaid to \u201ceat up the inhabitants.\u201d But when men yield their hearts to\nunbelief they place themselves under the control of Satan, and none\ncan tell to what lengths he will lead them.\n\u201cAnd all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the\npeople wept that night.\u201d Revolt and open mutiny quickly followed;\nfor Satan had full sway, and the people seemed bereft of reason.\nThey cursed Moses and Aaron, forgetting that God hearkened to\ntheir wicked speeches, and that, enshrouded in the cloudy pillar,\nthe Angel of His presence was witnessing their terrible outburst of\nwrath. In bitterness they cried out, \u201cWould God that we had died in\nthe land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!\u201d\nThen their feelings rose against God: \u201cWherefore hath the Lord\nbrought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and\nour children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into\nEgypt? And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let\nus return into Egypt.\u201d Thus they accused not only Moses, but God\nHimself, of deception, in promising them a land which they were\nnot able to possess. And they went so far as to appoint a captain\nto lead them back to the land of their suffering and bondage, from\nwhich they had been delivered by the strong arm of Omnipotence.\nIn humiliation and distress \u201cMoses and Aaron fell on their faces\nbefore all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel,\u201d\nnot knowing what to do to turn them from their rash and passionate\npurpose. Caleb and Joshua attempted to quiet the tumult. With[390]\nTwelve Spies 349\ntheir garments rent in token of grief and indignation, they rushed\nin among the people, and their ringing voices were heard above the\ntempest of lamentation and rebellious grief: \u201cThe land, which we\npassed through to search it, is an exceeding good land. If the Lord\ndelight in us, then He will bring us into this land, and give it us; a\nland which floweth with milk and honey. Only rebel not ye against\nthe Lord, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread\nfor us: their defense is departed from them, and the Lord is with us:\nfear them not.\u201d\nThe Canaanites had filled up the measure of their iniquity, and\nthe Lord would no longer bear with them. His protection being\nremoved, they would be an easy prey. By the covenant of God the\nland was ensured to Israel. But the false report of the unfaithful spies\nwas accepted, and through it the whole congregation were deluded.\nThe traitors had done their work. If only the two men had brought\nthe evil report, and all the ten had encouraged them to possess the\nland in the name of the Lord, they would still have taken the advice\nof the two in preference to the ten, because of their wicked unbelief.\nBut there were only two advocating the right, while ten were on the\nside of rebellion.\nThe unfaithful spies were loud in denunciation of Caleb and\nJoshua, and the cry was raised to stone them. The insane mob\nseized missiles with which to slay those faithful men. They rushed\nforward with yells of madness, when suddenly the stones dropped\nfrom their hands, a hush fell upon them, and they shook with fear.\nGod had interposed to check their murderous design. The glory of\nHis presence, like a flaming light, illuminated the tabernacle. All\nthe people beheld the signal of the Lord. A mightier one than they\nhad revealed Himself, and none dared continue their resistance. The\nspies who brought the evil report crouched terror-stricken, and with\nbated breath sought their tents.\nMoses now arose and entered the tabernacle. The Lord declared\nto him, \u201cI will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them,\nand will make of thee a greater nation.\u201d But again Moses pleaded\nfor his people. He could not consent to have them destroyed, and he\nhimself made a mightier nation. Appealing to the mercy of God, he\nsaid: \u201cI beseech Thee, let the power of my Lord be great according\nas Thou hast spoken, saying, The Lord is long-suffering, and of\n350 Patriarchs and Prophets\ngreat mercy.... Pardon, I beseech Thee, the iniquity of this people\naccording to the greatness of Thy mercy, and as Thou hast forgiven[391]\nthis people, from Egypt even until now.\u201d\nThe Lord promised to spare Israel from immediate destruction;\nbut because of their unbelief and cowardice He could not manifest\nHis power to subdue their enemies. Therefore in His mercy He bade\nthem, as the only safe course, to turn back toward the Red Sea.\nIn their rebellion the people had exclaimed, \u201cWould God we had\ndied in this wilderness!\u201d Now this prayer was to be granted. The\nLord declared: \u201cAs ye have spoken in Mine ears, so will I do to\nyou: your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness, and all that were\nnumbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty\nyears old and upward.... But your little ones, which ye said should\nbe a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye\nhave despised.\u201d And of Caleb He said, \u201cMy servant Caleb, because\nhe had another spirit with him, and hath followed Me fully, him will\nI bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess\nit.\u201d As the spies had spent forty days in their journey, so the hosts of\nIsrael were to wander in the wilderness forty years.\nWhen Moses made known to the people the divine decision, their\nrage was changed to mourning. They knew that their punishment\nwas just. The ten unfaithful spies, divinely smitten by the plague,\nperished before the eyes of all Israel; and in their fate the people\nread their own doom.\nNow they seemed sincerely to repent of their sinful conduct; but\nthey sorrowed because of the result of their evil course rather than\nfrom a sense of their ingratitude and disobedience. When they found\nthat the Lord did not relent in His decree, their self-will again arose,\nand they declared that they would not return into the wilderness.\nIn commanding them to retire from the land of their enemies, God\ntested their apparent submission and proved that it was not real. They\nknew that they had deeply sinned in allowing their rash feelings to\ncontrol them and in seeking to slay the spies who had urged them to\nobey God; but they were only terrified to find that they had made a\nfearful mistake, the consequences of which would prove disastrous\nto themselves. Their hearts were unchanged, and they only needed\nan excuse to occasion a similar outbreak. This presented itself when\nTwelve Spies 351\nMoses, by the authority of God, commanded them to go back into\nthe wilderness.\nThe decree that Israel was not to enter Canaan for forty years was [392]\na bitter disappointment to Moses and Aaron, Caleb and Joshua; yet\nwithout a murmur they accepted the divine decision. But those who\nhad been complaining of God\u2019s dealings with them, and declaring\nthat they would return to Egypt, wept and mourned greatly when the\nblessings which they had despised were taken from them. They had\ncomplained at nothing, and now God gave them cause to weep. Had\nthey mourned for their sin when it was faithfully laid before them,\nthis sentence would not have been pronounced; but they mourned\nfor the judgment; their sorrow was not repentance, and could not\nsecure a reversing of their sentence.\nThe night was spent in lamentation, but with the morning came\na hope. They resolved to redeem their cowardice. When God had\nbidden them go up and take the land, they had refused; and now\nwhen He directed them to retreat they were equally rebellious. They\ndetermined to seize upon the land and possess it; it might be that\nGod would accept their work and change His purpose toward them.\nGod had made it their privilege and their duty to enter the land\nat the time of His appointment, but through their willful neglect\nthat permission had been withdrawn. Satan had gained his object in\npreventing them from entering Canaan; and now he urged them on\nto do the very thing, in the face of the divine prohibition, which they\nhad refused to do when God required it. Thus the great deceiver\ngained the victory by leading them to rebellion the second time.\nThey had distrusted the power of God to work with their efforts in\ngaining possession of Canaan; yet now they presumed upon their\nown strength to accomplish the work independent of divine aid. \u201cWe\nhave sinned against the Lord,\u201d they cried; \u201cwe will go up and fight,\naccording to all that the Lord our God commanded us.\u201d Deuteronomy\n1:41. So terribly blinded had they become by transgression. The\nLord had never commanded them to \u201cgo up and fight.\u201d It was not\nHis purpose that they should gain the land by warfare, but by strict\nobedience to His commands.\nThough their hearts were unchanged, the people had been\nbrought to confess the sinfulness and folly of their rebellion at the\nreport of the spies. They now saw the value of the blessing which\n352 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthey had so rashly cast away. They confessed that it was their own\nunbelief which had shut them out from Canaan. \u201cWe have sinned,\u201d[393]\nthey said, acknowledging that the fault was in themselves, and not in\nGod, whom they had so wickedly charged with failing to fulfill His\npromises to them. Though their confession did not spring from true\nrepentance, it served to vindicate the justice of God in His dealings\nwith them.\nThe Lord still works in a similar manner to glorify His name by\nbringing men to acknowledge His justice. When those who profess\nto love Him complain of His providence, despise His promises, and,\nyielding to temptation, unite with evil angels to defeat the purposes\nof God, the Lord often so overrules circumstances as to bring these\npersons where, though they may have no real repentance, they will\nbe convinced of their sin and will be constrained to acknowledge the\nwickedness of their course and the justice and goodness of God in His\ndealings with them. It is thus that God sets counteragencies at work\nto make manifest the works of darkness. And though the spirit which\nprompted to the evil course is not radically changed, confessions\nare made that vindicate the honor of God and justify His faithful\nreprovers, who have been opposed and misrepresented. Thus it will\nbe when the wrath of God shall be finally poured out. When \u201cthe\nLord cometh with ten thousand of His saints, to execute judgment\nupon all,\u201d He will also \u201cconvince all that are ungodly among them of\nall their ungodly deeds.\u201d Jude 14, 15. Every sinner will be brought\nto see and acknowledge the justice of his condemnation.\nRegardless of the divine sentence, the Israelites prepared to un-\ndertake the conquest of Canaan. Equipped with armor and weapons\nof war, they were, in their own estimation, fully prepared for conflict;\nbut they were sadly deficient in the sight of God and His sorrowful\nservants. When, nearly forty years later, the Lord directed Israel\nto go up and take Jericho, He promised to go with them. The ark\ncontaining His law was borne before their armies. His appointed\nleaders were to direct their movements, under the divine supervision.\nWith such guidance, no harm could come to them. But now, contrary\nto the command of God and the solemn prohibition of their leaders,\nwithout the ark, and without Moses, they went out to meet the armies\nof the enemy.\nTwelve Spies 353\nThe trumpet sounded an alarm, and Moses hastened after them\nwith the warning, \u201cWherefore now do ye transgress the command-\nment of the Lord? but it shall not prosper. Go not up, for the Lord [394]\nis not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies. For\nthe Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall\nfall by the sword.\u201d\nThe Canaanites had heard of the mysterious power that seemed to\nbe guarding this people and of the wonders wrought in their behalf,\nand they now summoned a strong force to repel the invaders. The\nattacking army had no leader. No prayer was offered that God would\ngive them the victory. They set forth with the desperate purpose to\nreverse their fate or to die in battle. Though untrained in war, they\nwere a vast multitude of armed men, and they hoped by a sudden\nand fierce assault to bear down all opposition. They presumptuously\nchallenged the foe that had not dared to attack them.\nThe Canaanites had stationed themselves upon a rocky tableland\nreached only by difficult passes and a steep and dangerous ascent.\nThe immense numbers of the Hebrews could only render their defeat\nmore terrible. They slowly threaded the mountain paths, exposed\nto the deadly missiles of their enemies above. Massive rocks came\nthundering down, marking their path with the blood of the slain.\nThose who reached the summit, exhausted with their ascent, were\nfiercely repulsed, and driven back with great loss. The field of\ncarnage was strewn with the bodies of the dead. The army of Israel\nwas utterly defeated. Destruction and death was the result of that\nrebellious experiment.\nForced to submission at last, the survivors \u201creturned, and wept\nbefore the Lord;\u201d but \u201cthe Lord would not hearken\u201d to their voice.\nDeuteronomy 1:45. By their signal victory the enemies of Israel, who\nhad before awaited with trembling the approach of that mighty host,\nwere inspired with confidence to resist them. All the reports they had\nheard concerning the marvelous things that God had wrought for His\npeople, they now regarded as false, and they felt that there was no\ncause for fear. That first defeat of Israel, by inspiring the Canaanites\nwith courage and resolution, had greatly increased the difficulties of\nthe conquest. Nothing remained for Israel but to fall back from the\nface of their victorious foes, into the wilderness, knowing that here\nmust be the grave of a whole generation.\nChapter 35\u2014The Rebellion of Korah[395]\nThis chapter is based on Numbers 16 and 17.\nThe judgments visited upon the Israelites served for a time to\nrestrain their murmuring and insubordination, but the spirit of rebel-\nlion was still in the heart and eventually brought forth the bitterest\nfruits. The former rebellions had been mere popular tumults, arising\nfrom the sudden impulse of the excited multitude; but now a deep-\nlaid conspiracy was formed, the result of a determined purpose to\noverthrow the authority of the leaders appointed by God Himself.\nKorah, the leading spirit in this movement, was a Levite, of the\nfamily of Kohath, and a cousin of Moses; he was a man of ability and\ninfluence. Though appointed to the service of the tabernacle, he had\nbecome dissatisfied with his position and aspired to the dignity of the\npriesthood. The bestowal upon Aaron and his house of the priestly\noffice, which had formerly devolved upon the first-born son of every\nfamily, had given rise to jealousy and dissatisfaction, and for some\ntime Korah had been secretly opposing the authority of Moses and\nAaron, though he had not ventured upon any open act of rebellion.\nHe finally conceived the bold design of overthrowing both the civil\nand the religious authority. He did not fail to find sympathizers.\nClose to the tents of Korah and the Kohathites, on the south side\nof the tabernacle, was the encampment of the tribe of Reuben, the\ntents of Dathan and Abiram, two princes of this tribe, being near that\nof Korah. These princes readily joined in his ambitious schemes.\nBeing descendants from the eldest son of Jacob, they claimed that\nthe civil authority belonged to them, and they determined to divide\nwith Korah the honors of the priesthood.\nThe state of feeling among the people favored the designs of\nKorah. In the bitterness of their disappointment, their former doubts,\njealousy, and hatred had returned, and again their complaints were\ndirected against their patient leader. The Israelites were continually[396]\nlosing sight of the fact that they were under divine guidance. They\n354\nRebellion of Korah 355\nforgot that the Angel of the covenant was their invisible leader, that,\nveiled by the cloudy pillar, the presence of Christ went before them,\nand that from Him Moses received all his directions.\nThey were unwilling to submit to the terrible sentence that they\nmust all die in the wilderness, and hence they were ready to seize\nupon every pretext for believing that it was not God but Moses\nwho was leading them and who had pronounced their doom. The\nbest efforts of the meekest man upon the earth could not quell the\ninsubordination of this people; and although the marks of God\u2019s\ndispleasure at their former perverseness were still before them in\ntheir broken ranks and missing numbers, they did not take the lesson\nto heart. Again they were overcome by temptation.\nThe humble shepherd\u2019s life of Moses had been far more peaceful\nand happy than his present position as leader of that vast assembly\nof turbulent spirits. Yet Moses dared not choose. In place of a\nshepherd\u2019s crook a rod of power had been given him, which he could\nnot lay down until God should release him.\nHe who reads the secrets of all hearts had marked the purposes of\nKorah and his companions and had given His people such warning\nand instruction as might have enabled them to escape the deception\nof these designing men. They had seen the judgment of God fall\nupon Miriam because of her jealousy and complaints against Moses.\nThe Lord had declared that Moses was greater than a prophet. \u201cWith\nhim will I speak mouth to mouth.\u201d \u201cWherefore, then,\u201d He added,\n\u201cwere ye not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?\u201d Numbers\n12:8. These instructions were not intended for Aaron and Miriam\nalone, but for all Israel.\nKorah and his fellow conspirators were men who had been fa-\nvored with special manifestations of God\u2019s power and greatness.\nThey were of the number who went up with Moses into the mount\nand beheld the divine glory. But since that time a change had come.\nA temptation, slight at first, had been harbored, and had strengthened\nas it was encouraged, until their minds were controlled by Satan,\nand they ventured upon their work of disaffection. Professing great\ninterest in the prosperity of the people, they first whispered their\ndiscontent to one another and then to leading men of Israel. Their\ninsinuations were so readily received that they ventured still further, [397]\n356 Patriarchs and Prophets\nand at last they really believed themselves to be actuated by zeal for\nGod.\nThey were successful in alienating two hundred and fifty princes,\nmen of renown in the congregation. With these strong and influential\nsupporters they felt confident of making a radical change in the\ngovernment and greatly improving upon the administration of Moses\nand Aaron.\nJealousy had given rise to envy, and envy to rebellion. They had\ndiscussed the question of the right of Moses to so great authority\nand honor, until they had come to regard him as occupying a very\nenviable position, which any of them could fill as well as he. And\nthey deceived themselves and one another into thinking that Moses\nand Aaron had themselves assumed the positions they held. The dis-\ncontented ones said that these leaders had exalted themselves above\nthe congregation of the Lord, in taking upon them the priesthood\nand government, but their house was not entitled to distinction above\nothers in Israel; they were no more holy than the people, and it\nshould be enough for them to be on a level with their brethren, who\nwere equally favored with God\u2019s special presence and protection.\nThe next work of the conspirators was with the people. To those\nwho are in the wrong, and deserving of reproof, there is nothing\nmore pleasing than to receive sympathy and praise. And thus Korah\nand his associates gained the attention and enlisted the support of\nthe congregation. The charge that the murmurings of the people had\nbrought upon them the wrath of God was declared to be a mistake.\nThey said that the congregation were not at fault, since they desired\nnothing more than their rights; but that Moses was an overbearing\nruler; that he had reproved the people as sinners, when they were a\nholy people, and the Lord was among them.\nKorah reviewed the history of their travels through the wilder-\nness, where they had been brought into strait places, and many had\nperished because of their murmuring and disobedience. His hearers\nthought they saw clearly that their troubles might have been pre-\nvented if Moses had pursued a different course. They decided that\nall their disasters were chargeable to him, and that their exclusion\nfrom Canaan was in consequence of the mismanagement of Moses\nand Aaron; that if Korah would be their leader, and would encourage\nthem by dwelling upon their good deeds, instead of reproving their[398]\nRebellion of Korah 357\nsins, they would have a very peaceful, prosperous journey; instead of\nwandering to and fro in the wilderness, they would proceed directly\nto the Promised Land.\nIn this work of disaffection there was greater union and har-\nmony among the discordant elements of the congregation than had\never before existed. Korah\u2019s success with the people increased his\nconfidence and confirmed him in his belief that the usurpation of\nauthority by Moses, if unchecked, would be fatal to the liberties\nof Israel; he also claimed that God had opened the matter to him,\nand had authorized him to make a change in the government before\nit should be too late. But many were not ready to accept Korah\u2019s\naccusations against Moses. The memory of his patient, self-sacrific-\ning labors came up before them, and conscience was disturbed. It\nwas therefore necessary to assign some selfish motive for his deep\ninterest for Israel; and the old charge was reiterated, that he had led\nthem out to perish in the wilderness, that he might seize upon their\npossessions.\nFor a time this work was carried on secretly. As soon, however,\nas the movement had gained sufficient strength to warrant an open\nrupture, Korah appeared at the head of the faction, and publicly\naccused Moses and Aaron of usurping authority which Korah and\nhis associates were equally entitled to share. It was charged, further,\nthat the people had been deprived of their liberty and independence.\n\u201cYe take too much upon you,\u201d said the conspirators, \u201cseeing all the\ncongregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among\nthem: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation\nof the Lord?\u201d\nMoses had not suspected this deep-laid plot, and when its terrible\nsignificance burst upon him, he fell upon his face in silent appeal\nto God. He arose sorrowful indeed, but calm and strong. Divine\nguidance had been granted him. \u201cEven tomorrow,\u201d he said, \u201cthe\nLord will show who are His, and who is holy; and will cause him\nto come near unto Him: even him whom He hath chosen will He\ncause to come near unto Him.\u201d The test was to be deferred until the\nmorrow, that all might have time for reflection. Then those who\naspired to the priesthood were to come each with a censer, and offer\nincense at the tabernacle in the presence of the congregation. The\nlaw was very explicit that only those who had been ordained to the\n358 Patriarchs and Prophets\nsacred office should minister in the sanctuary. And even the priests,\nNadab and Abihu, had been destroyed for venturing to offer \u201cstrange[399]\nfire,\u201d in disregard of a divine command. Yet Moses challenged his\naccusers, if they dared enter upon so perilous an appeal, to refer the\nmatter to God.\nSingling out Korah and his fellow Levites, Moses said, \u201cSeemeth\nit but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated\nyou from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself to\ndo the service of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the\ncongregation to minister unto them? And He hath brought thee near\nto Him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye\nthe priesthood also? for which cause both thou and all thy company\nare gathered together against the Lord. And what is Aaron, that ye\nmurmur against him?\u201d\nDathan and Abiram had not taken so bold a stand as had Korah;\nand Moses, hoping that they might have been drawn into the conspir-\nacy without having become wholly corrupted, summoned them to\nappear before him, that he might hear their charges against him. But\nthey would not come, and they insolently refused to acknowledge\nhis authority. Their reply, uttered in the hearing of the congregation,\nwas, \u201cIs it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land\nthat floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except\nthou make thyself altogether a prince over us? Moreover thou hast\nnot brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given\nus inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of\nthese men? We will not come up.\u201d\nThus they applied to the scene of their bondage the very language\nin which the Lord had described the promised inheritance. They\naccused Moses of pretending to act under divine guidance, as a\nmeans of establishing his authority; and they declared that they\nwould no longer submit to be led about like blind men, now toward\nCanaan, and now toward the wilderness, as best suited his ambitious\ndesigns. Thus he who had been as a tender father, a patient shepherd,\nwas represented in the blackest character of a tyrant and usurper.\nThe exclusion from Canaan, in punishment of their own sins, was\ncharged upon him.\nIt was evident that the sympathies of the people were with the\ndisaffected party; but Moses made no effort at self-vindication. He\nRebellion of Korah 359\nsolemnly appealed to God, in the presence of the congregation, as\na witness to the purity of his motives and the uprightness of his\nconduct, and implored Him to be his judge.\nOn the morrow, the two hundred and fifty princes, with Korah [400]\nat their head, presented themselves, with their censers. They were\nbrought into the court of the tabernacle, while the people gathered\nwithout, to await the result. It was not Moses who assembled the\ncongregation to behold the defeat of Korah and his company, but\nthe rebels, in their blind presumption, had called them together to\nwitness their victory. A large part of the congregation openly sided\nwith Korah, whose hopes were high of carrying his point against\nAaron.\nAs they were thus assembled before God, \u201cthe glory of the\nLord appeared unto all the congregation.\u201d The divine warning was\ncommunicated to Moses and Aaron, \u201cSeparate yourselves from\namong this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.\u201d\nBut they fell upon their faces, with the prayer, \u201cO God, the God of\nthe spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt Thou be wroth\nwith all the congregation?\u201d\nKorah had withdrawn from the assembly to join Dathan and\nAbiram when Moses, accompanied by the seventy elders, went\ndown with a last warning to the men who had refused to come to\nhim. The multitudes followed, and before delivering his message,\nMoses, by divine direction, bade the people, \u201cDepart, I pray you,\nfrom the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs,\nlest ye be consumed in all their sins.\u201d The warning was obeyed, for\nan apprehension of impending judgment rested upon all. The chief\nrebels saw themselves abandoned by those whom they had deceived,\nbut their hardihood was unshaken. They stood with their families in\nthe door of their tents, as if in defiance of the divine warning.\nIn the name of the God of Israel, Moses now declared, in the\nhearing of the congregation: \u201cHereby ye shall know that the Lord\nhath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine\nown mind. If these men die the common death of all men, or if they\nbe visited after the visitation of all men, then the Lord hath not sent\nme. But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth,\nand swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they\n360 Patriarchs and Prophets\ngo down quick into the pit, then ye shall understand that these men\nhave provoked the Lord.\u201d\nThe eyes of all Israel were fixed upon Moses as they stood, in\nterror and expectation, awaiting the event. As he ceased speaking,\nthe solid earth parted, and the rebels went down alive into the pit,[401]\nwith all that pertained to them, and \u201cthey perished from among the\ncongregation.\u201d The people fled, self-condemned as partakers in the\nsin.\nBut the judgments were not ended. Fire flashing from the cloud\nconsumed the two hundred and fifty princes who had offered incense.\nThese men, not being the first in rebellion, were not destroyed with\nthe chief conspirators. They were permitted to see their end, and to\nhave an opportunity for repentance; but their sympathies were with\nthe rebels, and they shared their fate.\nWhen Moses was entreating Israel to flee from the coming de-\nstruction, the divine judgment might even then have been stayed, if\nKorah and his company had repented and sought forgiveness. But\ntheir stubborn persistence sealed their doom. The entire congre-\ngation were sharers in their guilt, for all had, to a greater or less\ndegree, sympathized with them. Yet God in His great mercy made\na distinction between the leaders in rebellion and those whom they\nhad led. The people who had permitted themselves to be deceived\nwere still granted space for repentance. Overwhelming evidence had\nbeen given that they were wrong, and that Moses was right. The\nsignal manifestation of God\u2019s power had removed all uncertainty.\nJesus, the Angel who went before the Hebrews, sought to save\nthem from destruction. Forgiveness was lingering for them. The\njudgment of God had come very near, and appealed to them to\nrepent. A special, irresistible interference from heaven had arrested\ntheir rebellion. Now, if they would respond to the interposition of\nGod\u2019s providence, they might be saved. But while they fled from the\njudgments, through fear of destruction, their rebellion was not cured.\nThey returned to their tents that night terrified, but not repentant.\nThey had been flattered by Korah and his company until they\nreally believed themselves to be very good people, and that they had\nbeen wronged and abused by Moses. Should they admit that Korah\nand his company were wrong, and Moses right, then they would\nbe compelled to receive as the word of God the sentence that they\nRebellion of Korah 361\nmust die in the wilderness. They were not willing to submit to this,\nand they tried to believe that Moses had deceived them. They had\nfondly cherished the hope that a new order of things was about to be\nestablished, in which praise would be substituted for reproof, and\nease for anxiety and conflict. The men who had perished had spoken [402]\nflattering words and had professed great interest and love for them,\nand the people concluded that Korah and his companions must have\nbeen good men, and that Moses had by some means been the cause\nof their destruction.\nIt is hardly possible for men to offer greater insult to God than\nto despise and reject the instrumentalities He would use for their\nsalvation. The Israelites had not only done this, but had purposed\nto put both Moses and Aaron to death. Yet they did not realize the\nnecessity of seeking pardon of God for their grievous sin. That night\nof probation was not passed in repentance and confession, but in\ndevising some way to resist the evidences which showed them to\nbe the greatest of sinners. They still cherished hatred of the men of\nGod\u2019s appointment, and braced themselves to resist their authority.\nSatan was at hand to pervert their judgment and lead them blindfold\nto destruction.\nAll Israel had fled in alarm at the cry of the doomed sinners who\nwent down into the pit, for they said, \u201cLest the earth swallow us up\nalso.\u201d \u201cBut on the morrow all the congregation of the children of\nIsrael murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, ye have\nkilled the people of the Lord.\u201d And they were about to proceed to\nviolence against their faithful, self-sacrificing leaders.\nA manifestation of the divine glory was seen in the cloud above\nthe tabernacle, and a voice from the cloud spoke to Moses and Aaron,\n\u201cGet you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them\nas in a moment.\u201d\nThe guilt of sin did not rest upon Moses, and hence he did not fear\nand did not hasten away and leave the congregation to perish. Moses\nlingered, in this fearful crisis manifesting the true shepherd\u2019s interest\nfor the flock of his care. He pleaded that the wrath of God might\nnot utterly destroy the people of His choice. By his intercession he\nstayed the arm of vengeance, that a full end might not be made of\ndisobedient, rebellious Israel.\n362 Patriarchs and Prophets\nBut the minister of wrath had gone forth; the plague was doing\nits work of death. By his brother\u2019s direction, Aaron took a censer and\nhastened into the midst of the congregation to \u201cmake an atonement\nfor them.\u201d \u201cAnd he stood between the dead and the living.\u201d As\nthe smoke of the incense ascended, the prayers of Moses in the\ntabernacle went up to God; and the plague was stayed; but not until[403]\nfourteen thousand of Israel lay dead, an evidence of the guilt of\nmurmuring and rebellion.\nBut further evidence was given that the priesthood had been\nestablished in the family of Aaron. By divine direction each tribe\nprepared a rod and wrote upon it the name of the tribe. The name of\nAaron was upon that of Levi. The rods were laid up in the tabernacle,\n\u201cbefore the testimony.\u201d The blossoming of any rod was to be a token\nthat the Lord had chosen that tribe for the priesthood. On the morrow,\n\u201cbehold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and\nbrought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.\u201d It\nwas shown to the people, and afterward laid up in the tabernacle as\na witness to succeeding generations. This miracle effectually settled\nthe question of the priesthood.\nIt was now fully established that Moses and Aaron had spoken\nby divine authority, and the people were compelled to believe the\nunwelcome truth that they were to die in the wilderness. \u201cBehold,\u201d\nthey exclaimed, \u201cwe die, we perish, we all perish.\u201d They confessed\nthat they had sinned in rebelling against their leaders, and that Korah\nand his company had suffered from the just judgment of God.\nIn the rebellion of Korah is seen the working out, upon a narrower\nstage, of the same spirit that led to the rebellion of Satan in heaven.\nIt was pride and ambition that prompted Lucifer to complain of the\ngovernment of God, and to seek the overthrow of the order which\nhad been established in heaven. Since his fall it has been his object\nto infuse the same spirit of envy and discontent, the same ambition\nfor position and honor, into the minds of men. He thus worked upon\nthe minds of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, to arouse the desire for\nself-exaltation and excite envy, distrust, and rebellion. Satan caused\nthem to reject God as their leader, by rejecting the men of God\u2019s\nappointment. Yet while in their murmuring against Moses and Aaron\nthey blasphemed God, they were so deluded as to think themselves\nRebellion of Korah 363\nrighteous, and to regard those who had faithfully reproved their sins\nas actuated by Satan.\nDo not the same evils still exist that lay at the foundation of\nKorah\u2019s ruin? Pride and ambition are widespread; and when these are\ncherished, they open the door to envy, and a striving for supremacy;\nthe soul is alienated from God, and unconsciously drawn into the [404]\nranks of Satan. Like Korah and his companions, many, even of the\nprofessed followers of Christ, are thinking, planning, and working\nso eagerly for self-exaltation that in order to gain the sympathy and\nsupport of the people they are ready to pervert the truth, falsifying\nand misrepresenting the Lord\u2019s servants, and even charging them\nwith the base and selfish motives that inspire their own hearts. By\npersistently reiterating falsehood, and that against all evidence, they\nat last come to believe it to be truth. While endeavoring to destroy\nthe confidence of the people in the men of God\u2019s appointment, they\nreally believe that they are engaged in a good work, verily doing\nGod service.\nThe Hebrews were not willing to submit to the directions and\nrestrictions of the Lord. They were restless under restraint, and\nunwilling to receive reproof. This was the secret of their murmuring\nagainst Moses. Had they been left free to do as they pleased, there\nwould have been fewer complaints against their leader. All through\nthe history of the church God\u2019s servants have had the same spirit to\nmeet.\nIt is by sinful indulgence that men give Satan access to their\nminds, and they go from one stage of wickedness to another. The\nrejection of light darkens the mind and hardens the heart, so that it is\neasier for them to take the next step in sin and to reject still clearer\nlight, until at last their habits of wrongdoing become fixed. Sin\nceases to appear sinful to them. He who faithfully preaches God\u2019s\nword, thereby condemning their sins, too often incurs their hatred.\nUnwilling to endure the pain and sacrifice necessary to reform, they\nturn upon the Lord\u2019s servant and denounce his reproofs as uncalled\nfor and severe. Like Korah, they declare that the people are not at\nfault; it is the reprover that causes all the trouble. And soothing their\nconsciences with this deception, the jealous and disaffected combine\nto sow discord in the church and weaken the hands of those who\nwould build it up.\n364 Patriarchs and Prophets\nEvery advance made by those whom God has called to lead in\nHis work has excited suspicion; every act has been misrepresented\nby the jealous and faultfinding. Thus it was in the time of Luther, of\nthe Wesleys and other reformers. Thus it is today.\nKorah would not have taken the course he did had he known that\nall the directions and reproofs communicated to Israel were from\nGod. But he might have known this. God had given overwhelming[405]\nevidence that He was leading Israel. But Korah and his companions\nrejected light until they became so blinded that the most striking\nmanifestations of His power were not sufficient to convince them;\nthey attributed them all to human or satanic agency. The same\nthing was done by the people, who the day after the destruction of\nKorah and his company came to Moses and Aaron, saying, \u201cYe have\nkilled the people of the Lord.\u201d Notwithstanding they had had the\nmost convincing evidence of God\u2019s displeasure at their course, in\nthe destruction of the men who had deceived them, they dared to\nattribute His judgments to Satan, declaring that through the power of\nthe evil one, Moses and Aaron had caused the death of good and holy\nmen. It was this act that sealed their doom. They had committed the\nsin against the Holy Spirit, a sin by which man\u2019s heart is effectually\nhardened against the influence of divine grace. \u201cWhosoever speaketh\na word against the Son of man,\u201d said Christ, \u201cit shall be forgiven\nhim: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be\nforgiven him.\u201d Matthew 12:32. These words were spoken by our\nSaviour when the gracious works which He had performed through\nthe power of God were attributed by the Jews to Beelzebub. It is\nthrough the agency of the Holy Spirit that God communicates with\nman; and those who deliberately reject this agency as satanic, have\ncut off the channel of communication between the soul and Heaven.\nGod works by the manifestation of His Spirit to reprove and\nconvict the sinner; and if the Spirit\u2019s work is finally rejected, there\nis no more that God can do for the soul. The last resource of di-\nvine mercy has been employed. The transgressor has cut himself\noff from God, and sin has no remedy to cure itself. There is no\nreserved power by which God can work to convict and convert the\nsinner. \u201cLet him alone\u201d (Hosea 4:17) is the divine command. Then\n\u201cthere remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful\nRebellion of Korah 365\nlooking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour\nthe adversaries.\u201d Hebrews 10:26, 27.\nChapter 36\u2014In the Wilderness[406]\nFor nearly forty years the children of Israel are lost to view in the\nobscurity of the desert. \u201cThe space,\u201d says Moses, \u201cin which we came\nfrom Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was\nthirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were\nwasted out from among the host, as the Lord sware unto them. For\nindeed the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from\namong the host, until they were consumed.\u201d Deuteronomy 2:14, 15.\nDuring these years the people were constantly reminded that\nthey were under the divine rebuke. In the rebellion at Kadesh they\nhad rejected God, and God had for the time rejected them. Since they\nhad proved unfaithful to His covenant, they were not to receive the\nsign of the covenant, the rite of circumcision. Their desire to return\nto the land of slavery had shown them to be unworthy of freedom,\nand the ordinance of the Passover, instituted to commemorate the\ndeliverance from bondage, was not to be observed.\nYet the continuance of the tabernacle service testified that God\nhad not utterly forsaken His people. And His providence still sup-\nplied their wants. \u201cThe Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the\nworks of thy hand,\u201d said Moses, in rehearsing the history of their\nwanderings. \u201cHe knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness;\nthese forty years the Lord thy God hath been with thee; thou hast\nlacked nothing.\u201d And the Levites\u2019 hymn, recorded by Nehemiah,\nvividly pictures God\u2019s care for Israel, even during these years of\nrejection and banishment: \u201cThou in Thy manifold mercies forsook-\nest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not\nfrom them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire\nby night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.\nThou gavest also Thy good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest[407]\nnot Thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their\nthirst. Yea, forty years didst Thou sustain them in the wilderness; ...\ntheir clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.\u201d Nehemiah\n9:19-21.\n366\nIn the Wilderness 367\nThe wilderness wandering was not only ordained as a judgment\nupon the rebels and murmurers, but it was to serve as a discipline for\nthe rising generation, preparatory to their entrance into the Promised\nLand. Moses declared to them, \u201cAs a man chasteneth his son, so the\nLord thy God chasteneth thee,\u201d \u201cto humble thee, and to prove thee,\nto know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep His\ncommandments, or no. And He ... suffered thee to hunger, and fed\nthee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers\nknow; that He might make thee know that man doth not live by bread\nonly, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord\ndoth man live.\u201d Deuteronomy 8:5, 2, 3.\n\u201cHe found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilder-\nness; He led him about, He instructed him, He kept him as the\napple of His eye.\u201d \u201cIn all their affliction He was afflicted, and the\nAngel of His presence saved them; in His love and in His pity He\nredeemed them; and He bare them, and carried them all the days of\nold.\u201d Deuteronomy 32:10; Isaiah 63:9.\nYet the only records of their wilderness life are instances of\nrebellion against the Lord. The revolt of Korah had resulted in the\ndestruction of fourteen thousand of Israel. And there were isolated\ncases that showed the same spirit of contempt for the divine authority.\nOn one occasion the son of an Israelitish woman and of an\nEgyptian, one of the mixed multitude that had come up with Israel\nfrom Egypt, left his own part of the camp, and entering that of the\nIsraelites, claimed the right to pitch his tent there. This the divine law\nforbade him to do, the descendants of an Egyptian being excluded\nfrom the congregation until the third generation. A dispute arose\nbetween him and an Israelite, and the matter being referred to the\njudges was decided against the offender.\nEnraged at this decision, he cursed the judge, and in the heat of\npassion blasphemed the name of God. He was immediately brought\nbefore Moses. The command had been given, \u201cHe that curseth his [408]\nfather, or his mother, shall surely be put to death\u201d (Exodus 21:17);\nbut no provision had been made to meet this case. So terrible was\nthe crime that there was felt to be a necessity for special direction\nfrom God. The man was placed in ward until the will of the Lord\ncould be ascertained. God Himself pronounced the sentence; by the\ndivine direction the blasphemer was conducted outside the camp\n368 Patriarchs and Prophets\nand stoned to death. Those who had been witness to the sin placed\ntheir hands upon his head, thus solemnly testifying to the truth of the\ncharge against him. Then they threw the first stones, and the people\nwho stood by afterward joined in executing the sentence.\nThis was followed by the announcement of a law to meet simi-\nlar offenses: \u201cThou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,\nWhosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. And he that blas-\nphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and\nall the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger,\nas he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the\nLord, shall be put to death.\u201d Leviticus 24:15, 16.\nThere are those who will question God\u2019s love and His justice in\nvisiting so severe punishment for words spoken in the heat of passion.\nBut both love and justice require it to be shown that utterances\nprompted by malice against God are a great sin. The retribution\nvisited upon the first offender would be a warning to others, that\nGod\u2019s name is to be held in reverence. But had this man\u2019s sin been\npermitted to pass unpunished, others would have been demoralized;\nand as the result many lives must eventually have been sacrificed.\nThe mixed multitude that came up with the Israelites from Egypt\nwere a source of continual temptation and trouble. They professed to\nhave renounced idolatry and to worship the true God; but their early\neducation and training had molded their habits and character, and\nthey were more or less corrupted with idolatry and with irreverence\nfor God. They were oftenest the ones to stir up strife and were the\nfirst to complain, and they leavened the camp with their idolatrous\npractices and their murmurings against God.\nSoon after the return into the wilderness, an instance of Sabbath\nviolation occurred, under circumstances that rendered it a case of\npeculiar guilt. The Lord\u2019s announcement that He would disinherit[409]\nIsrael had roused a spirit of rebellion. One of the people, angry at\nbeing excluded from Canaan, and determined to show his defiance of\nGod\u2019s law, ventured upon the open transgression of the fourth com-\nmandment by going out to gather sticks upon the Sabbath. During\nthe sojourn in the wilderness the kindling of fires upon the seventh\nday had been strictly prohibited. The prohibition was not to extend\nto the land of Canaan, where the severity of the climate would often\nrender fires a necessity; but in the wilderness, fire was not needed\nIn the Wilderness 369\nfor warmth. The act of this man was a willful and deliberate viola-\ntion of the fourth commandment\u2014a sin, not of thoughtlessness or\nignorance, but of presumption.\nHe was taken in the act and brought before Moses. It had already\nbeen declared that Sabbathbreaking should be punished with death,\nbut it had not yet been revealed how the penalty was to be inflicted.\nThe case was brought by Moses before the Lord, and the direction\nwas given, \u201cThe man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation\nshall stone him with stones without the camp.\u201d Numbers 15:35.\nThe sins of blasphemy and willful Sabbathbreaking received the\nsame punishment, being equally an expression of contempt for the\nauthority of God.\nIn our day there are many who reject the creation Sabbath as\na Jewish institution and urge that if it is to be kept, the penalty of\ndeath must be inflicted for its violation; but we see that blasphemy\nreceived the same punishment as did Sabbathbreaking. Shall we\ntherefore conclude that the third commandment also is to be set\naside as applicable only to the Jews? Yet the argument drawn from\nthe death penalty applies to the third, the fifth, and indeed to nearly\nall the ten precepts, equally with the fourth. Though God may not\nnow punish the transgression of His law with temporal penalties,\nyet His word declares that the wages of sin is death; and in the final\nexecution of the judgment it will be found that death is the portion\nof those who violate His sacred precepts.\nDuring the entire forty years in the wilderness, the people were\nevery week reminded of the sacred obligation of the Sabbath, by the\nmiracle of the manna. Yet even this did not lead them to obedience.\nThough they did not venture upon so open and bold transgression as\nhad received such signal punishment, yet there was great laxness in [410]\nthe observance of the fourth commandment. God declares through\nHis prophet, \u201cMy Sabbaths they greatly polluted.\u201d Ezekiel 20:13-24.\nAnd this is enumerated among the reasons for the exclusion of the\nfirst generation from the Promised Land. Yet their children did not\nlearn the lesson. Such was their neglect of the Sabbath during the\nforty years\u2019 wandering, that though God did not prevent them from\nentering Canaan, He declared that they should be scattered among\nthe heathen after the settlement in the Land of Promise.\n370 Patriarchs and Prophets\nFrom Kadesh the children of Israel had turned back into the\nwilderness; and the period of their desert sojourn being ended, they\ncame, \u201ceven the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the\nfirst month: and the people abode in Kadesh.\u201d Numbers 20:1.\nHere Miriam died and was buried. From that scene of rejoicing\non the shores of the Red Sea, when Israel went forth with song and\ndance to celebrate Jehovah\u2019s triumph, to the wilderness grave which\nended a lifelong wandering\u2014such had been the fate of millions who\nwith high hopes had come forth from Egypt. Sin had dashed from\ntheir lips the cup of blessing. Would the next generation learn the\nlesson?\n\u201cFor all this they sinned still, and believed not for His wondrous\nworks.... When He slew them, then they sought Him: and they\nreturned and inquired early after God. And they remembered that\nGod was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer.\u201d Psalm\n78:32-35. Yet they did not turn to God with a sincere purpose.\nThough when afflicted by their enemies they sought help from Him\nwho alone could deliver, yet \u201ctheir heart was not right with Him ,\nneither were they steadfast in His covenant. But He, being full of\ncompassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea,\nmany a time turned He His anger away.... For He remembered that\nthey were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.\u201d\nVerses 37-39.\nChapter 37\u2014The Smitten Rock [411]\nThis chapter is based on Numbers 20:1-13.\nFrom the smitten rock in Horeb first flowed the living stream that\nrefreshed Israel in the desert. During all their wanderings, wherever\nthe need existed, they were supplied with water by a miracle of\nGod\u2019s mercy. The water did not, however, continue to flow from\nHoreb. Wherever in their journeyings they wanted water, there from\nthe clefts of the rock it gushed out beside their encampment.\nIt was Christ, by the power of His word, that caused the refresh-\ning stream to flow for Israel. \u201cThey drank of that spiritual Rock that\nfollowed them: and that Rock was Christ.\u201d 1 Corinthians 10:4. He\nwas the source of all temporal as well as spiritual blessings. Christ,\nthe true Rock, was with them in all their wanderings. \u201cThey thirsted\nnot when He led them through the deserts: He caused the waters to\nflow out of the rock for them; He clave the rock also, and the waters\ngushed out.\u201d \u201cThey ran in the dry places like a river.\u201d Isaiah 48:21;\nPsalm 105:41.\nThe smitten rock was a figure of Christ, and through this symbol\nthe most precious spiritual truths are taught. As the life-giving\nwaters flowed from the smitten rock, so from Christ, \u201csmitten of\nGod,\u201d \u201cwounded for our transgressions,\u201d \u201cbruised for our iniquities\u201d\n(Isaiah 53:4, 5), the stream of salvation flows for a lost race. As\nthe rock had been once smitten, so Christ was to be \u201conce offered\nto bear the sins of many.\u201d Hebrews 9:28. Our Saviour was not to\nbe sacrificed a second time; and it is only necessary for those who\nseek the blessings of His grace to ask in the name of Jesus, pouring\nforth the heart\u2019s desire in penitential prayer. Such prayer will bring\nbefore the Lord of hosts the wounds of Jesus, and then will flow\nforth afresh the life-giving blood, symbolized by the flowing of the\nliving water for Israel.\nThe flowing of the water from the rock in the desert was cele- [412]\nbrated by the Israelites, after their establishment in Canaan, with\n371\n372 Patriarchs and Prophets\ndemonstrations of great rejoicing. In the time of Christ this cele-\nbration had become a most impressive ceremony. It took place on\nthe occasion of the Feast of Tabernacles, when the people from all\nthe land were assembled at Jerusalem. On each of the seven days\nof the feast the priests went out with music and the choir of Levites\nto draw water in a golden vessel from the spring of Siloam. They\nwere followed by multitudes of the worshipers, as many as could\nget near the stream drinking of it, while the jubilant strains arose,\n\u201cWith joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.\u201d Isaiah\n12:3. Then the water drawn by the priests was borne to the temple\namid the sounding of trumpets and the solemn chant, \u201cOur feet shall\nstand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.\u201d Psalm 122:2. The water was\npoured out upon the altar of burnt offering, while songs of praise\nrang out, the multitudes joining in triumphant chorus with musical\ninstruments and deep-toned trumpets.\nThe Saviour made use of this symbolic service to direct the\nminds of the people to the blessings that He had come to bring them.\n\u201cIn the last day, that great day of the feast,\u201d His voice was heard in\ntones that rang through the temple courts, \u201cIf any man thirst, let him\ncome unto Me, and drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture\nhath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\u201d \u201cThis,\u201d\nsaid John, \u201cspake He of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him\nshould receive.\u201d John 7:37-39. The refreshing water, welling up\nin a parched and barren land, causing the desert place to blossom,\nand flowing out to give life to the perishing, is an emblem of the\ndivine grace which Christ alone can bestow, and which is as the\nliving water, purifying, refreshing, and invigorating the soul. He in\nwhom Christ is abiding has within him a never-failing fountain of\ngrace and strength. Jesus cheers the life and brightens the path of all\nwho truly seek Him . His love, received into the heart, will spring\nup in good works unto eternal life. And not only does it bless the\nsoul in which it springs, but the living stream will flow out in words\nand deeds of righteousness, to refresh the thirsting around him.\nThe same figure Christ had employed in His conversation with\nthe woman of Samaria at Jacob\u2019s well: \u201cWhosoever drinketh of the\nwater that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall[413]\ngive him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting\nSmitten Rock 373\nlife.\u201d John 4:14. Christ combines the two types. He is the rock, He\nis the living water.\nThe same beautiful and expressive figures are carried throughout\nthe Bible. Centuries before the advent of Christ, Moses pointed\nto Him as the rock of Israel\u2019s salvation (Deuteronomy 32:15); the\npsalmist sang of Him as \u201cmy Redeemer,\u201d \u201cthe rock of my strength,\u201d\n\u201cthe rock that is higher than I,\u201d \u201ca rock of habitation,\u201d \u201crock of my\nheart,\u201d \u201crock of my refuge.\u201d In David\u2019s song His grace is pictured\nalso as the cool, \u201cstill waters,\u201d amid green pastures, beside which\nthe heavenly Shepherd leads His flock. Again, \u201cThou shalt make\nthem,\u201d he says, \u201cdrink of the river of Thy pleasures. For with Thee is\nthe fountain of life.\u201d Psalm 19:14; 62:7; Psalm 61:2; 71:3 (margin);\n73:26 (margin); 94:22; 23:2; 36:8, 9. And the wise man declares,\n\u201cThe wellspring of wisdom [is] as a flowing brook.\u201d Proverbs 18:4.\nTo Jeremiah, Christ is \u201cthe fountain of living waters;\u201d to Zechariah,\n\u201ca fountain opened ... for sin and for uncleanness.\u201d Jeremiah 2:13;\nZechariah 13:1.\nIsaiah describes Him as the \u201crock of ages,\u201d and \u201cthe shadow of\na great rock in a weary land.\u201d Isaiah 26:4 (margin); 32:2. And he\nrecords the precious promise, bringing vividly to mind the living\nstream that flowed for Israel: \u201cWhen the poor and needy seek water,\nand there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will\nhear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.\u201d \u201cI will pour\nwater upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground;\u201d \u201cin\nthe wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.\u201d\nThe invitation is given, \u201cHo, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the\nwaters.\u201d Isaiah 41:17; 44:3; Isaiah 35:6; 55:1. And in the closing\npages of the Sacred Word this invitation is echoed. The river of the\nwater of life, \u201cclear as crystal,\u201d proceeds from the throne of God and\nthe Lamb; and the gracious call is ringing down through the ages,\n\u201cWhosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.\u201d Revelation\n22:17.\nJust before the Hebrew host reached Kadesh, the living stream\nceased that for so many years had gushed out beside their encamp-\nment. It was the Lord\u2019s purpose again to test His people. He would\nprove whether they would trust His providence or imitate the unbe-\nlief of their fathers.\nThey were now in sight of the hills of Canaan. A few days\u2019 march [414]\n374 Patriarchs and Prophets\nwould bring them to the borders of the Promised Land. They were\nbut a little distance from Edom, which belonged to the descendants\nof Esau, and through which lay the appointed route to Canaan. The\ndirection had been given to Moses, \u201cTurn you northward. And\ncommand thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast\nof your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they\nshall be afraid of you.... Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that\nye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that\nye may drink.\u201d Deuteronomy 2:3-6. These directions should have\nbeen sufficient to explain why their supply of water had been cut\noff; they were about to pass through a well-watered, fertile country,\nin a direct course to the land of Canaan. God had promised them an\nunmolested passage through Edom, and an opportunity to purchase\nfood, and also water sufficient to supply the host. The cessation of\nthe miraculous flow of water should therefore have been a cause of\nrejoicing, a token that the wilderness wandering was ended. Had\nthey not been blinded by their unbelief, they would have understood\nthis. But that which should have been an evidence of the fulfillment\nof God\u2019s promise was made the occasion of doubt and murmuring.\nThe people seemed to have given up all hope that God would bring\nthem into possession of Canaan, and they clamored for the blessings\nof the wilderness.\nBefore God permitted them to enter Canaan, they must show\nthat they believed His promise. The water ceased before they had\nreached Edom. Here was an opportunity for them, for a little time,\nto walk by faith instead of sight. But the first trial developed the\nsame turbulent, unthankful spirit that had been manifested by their\nfathers. No sooner was the cry for water heard in the encampment\nthan they forgot the hand that had for so many years supplied their\nwants, and instead of turning to God for help, they murmured against\nHim , in their desperation exclaiming, \u201cWould God that we had died\nwhen our brethren died before the Lord!\u201d (Numbers 20:1-13); that\nis, they wished they had been of the number who were destroyed in\nthe rebellion of Korah.\nTheir cries were directed against Moses and Aaron: \u201cWhy have\nye brought up the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness, that\nwe and our cattle should die there? And wherefore have ye made us\nto come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no[415]\n[416]\n[417]\nSmitten Rock 375\nplace of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is\nthere any water to drink.\u201d\nThe leaders went to the door of the tabernacle and fell upon\ntheir faces. Again \u201cthe glory of the Lord appeared,\u201d and Moses was\ndirected, \u201cTake the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou\nand Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes;\nand it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them\nwater out of the rock.\u201d\nThe two brothers went on before the multitude, Moses with the\nrod of God in his hand. They were now aged men. Long had they\nborne with the rebellion and obstinacy of Israel; but now, at last,\neven the patience of Moses gave way. \u201cHear now, ye rebels,\u201d he\ncried; \u201cmust we fetch you water out of this rock?\u201d and instead of\nspeaking to the rock, as God had commanded him, he smote it twice\nwith the rod.\nThe water gushed forth in abundance to satisfy the host. But\na great wrong had been done. Moses had spoken from irritated\nfeeling; his words were an expression of human passion rather than\nof holy indignation because God had been dishonored. \u201cHear now,\nye rebels,\u201d he said. This accusation was true, but even truth is not to\nbe spoken in passion or impatience. When God had bidden Moses to\ncharge upon Israel their rebellion, the words had been painful to him,\nand hard for them to bear, yet God had sustained him in delivering\nthe message. But when he took it upon himself to accuse them, he\ngrieved the Spirit of God and wrought only harm to the people. His\nlack of patience and self-control was evident. Thus the people were\ngiven occasion to question whether his past course had been under\nthe direction of God, and to excuse their own sins. Moses, as well\nas they, had offended God. His course, they said, had from the first\nbeen open to criticism and censure. They had now found the pretext\nwhich they desired for rejecting all the reproofs that God had sent\nthem through His servant.\nMoses manifested distrust of God. \u201cShall we bring water?\u201d he\nquestioned, as if the Lord would not do what He promised. \u201cYe\nbelieved Me not,\u201d the Lord declared to the two brothers, \u201cto sanctify\nMe in the eyes of the children of Israel.\u201d At the time when the water\nfailed, their own faith in the fulfillment of God\u2019s promise had been\nshaken by the murmuring and rebellion of the people. The first gen-\n376 Patriarchs and Prophets\neration had been condemned to perish in the wilderness because of[418]\ntheir unbelief, yet the same spirit appeared in their children. Would\nthese also fail of receiving the promise? Wearied and disheartened,\nMoses and Aaron had made no effort to stem the current of popular\nfeeling. Had they themselves manifested unwavering faith in God,\nthey might have set the matter before the people in such a light as\nwould have enabled them to bear this test. By prompt, decisive exer-\ncise of the authority vested in them as magistrates, they might have\nquelled the murmuring. It was their duty to put forth every effort\nin their power to bring about a better state of things before asking\nGod to do the work for them. Had the murmuring at Kadesh been\npromptly checked, what a train of evil might have been prevented!\nBy his rash act Moses took away the force of the lesson that God\npurposed to teach. The rock, being a symbol of Christ, had been\nonce smitten, as Christ was to be once offered. The second time it\nwas needful only to speak to the rock, as we have only to ask for\nblessings in the name of Jesus. By the second smiting of the rock\nthe significance of this beautiful figure of Christ was destroyed.\nMore than this, Moses and Aaron had assumed power that be-\nlongs only to God. The necessity for divine interposition made the\noccasion one of great solemnity, and the leaders of Israel should\nhave improved it to impress the people with reverence for God and\nto strengthen their faith in His power and goodness. When they\nangrily cried, \u201cMust we fetch you water out of this rock?\u201d they put\nthemselves in God\u2019s place, as though the power lay with themselves,\nmen possessing human frailties and passions. Wearied with the con-\ntinual murmuring and rebellion of the people, Moses had lost sight\nof his Almighty Helper, and without the divine strength he had been\nleft to mar his record by an exhibition of human weakness. The man\nwho might have stood pure, firm, and unselfish to the close of his\nwork had been overcome at last. God had been dishonored before\nthe congregation of Israel, when He should have been magnified and\nexalted.\nGod did not on this occasion pronounce judgments upon those\nwhose wicked course had so provoked Moses and Aaron. All the\nreproof fell upon the leaders. Those who stood as God\u2019s representa-\ntives had not honored Him . Moses and Aaron had felt themselves\naggrieved, losing sight of the fact that the murmuring of the people\nSmitten Rock 377\nwas not against them but against God. It was by looking to them- [419]\nselves, appealing to their own sympathies, that they unconsciously\nfell into sin, and failed to set before the people their great guilt before\nGod.\nBitter and deeply humiliating was the judgment immediately\npronounced. \u201cThe Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye\nbelieved Me not, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel,\ntherefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I\nhave given them.\u201d With rebellious Israel they must die before the\ncrossing of the Jordan. Had Moses and Aaron been cherishing self-\nesteem or indulging a passionate spirit in the face of divine warning\nand reproof, their guilt would have been far greater. But they were\nnot chargeable with willful or deliberate sin; they had been overcome\nby a sudden temptation, and their contrition was immediate and\nheartfelt. The Lord accepted their repentance, though because of the\nharm their sin might do among the people, He could not remit its\npunishment.\nMoses did not conceal his sentence, but told the people that since\nhe had failed to ascribe glory to God, he could not lead them into the\nPromised Land. He bade them mark the severe punishment visited\nupon him, and then consider how God must regard their murmurings\nin charging upon a mere man the judgments which they had by their\nsins brought upon themselves. He told them how he had pleaded\nwith God for a remission of the sentence, and had been refused.\n\u201cThe Lord was wroth with me for your sakes,\u201d he said, \u201cand would\nnot hear me.\u201d Deuteronomy 3:26.\nOn every occasion of difficulty or trial the Israelites had been\nready to charge Moses with having led them from Egypt, as though\nGod had had no agency in the matter. Throughout their journeyings,\nas they had complained of the difficulties in the way, and murmured\nagainst their leaders, Moses had told them, \u201cYour murmurings are\nagainst God. It is not I, but God, who has wrought in your deliver-\nance.\u201d But his hasty words before the rock, \u201cshall we bring water?\u201d\nwere a virtual admission of their charge, and would thus confirm\nthem in their unbelief and justify their murmurings. The Lord would\nremove this impression forever from their minds, by forbidding\nMoses to enter the Promised Land. Here was unmistakable evidence\nthat their leader was not Moses, but the mighty Angel of whom the\n378 Patriarchs and Prophets\nLord had said, \u201cBehold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee\nin the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.\nBeware of Him , and obey His voice: ... for My name is in Him .\u201d\nExodus 23:20, 21.\n\u201cThe Lord was wroth with me for your sakes,\u201d said Moses. The[420]\neyes of all Israel were upon Moses, and his sin cast a reflection\nupon God, who had chosen him as the leader of His people. The\ntransgression was known to the whole congregation; and had it been\npassed by lightly, the impression would have been given that unbelief\nand impatience under great provocation might be excused in those\nin responsible positions. But when it was declared that because of\nthat one sin Moses and Aaron were not to enter Canaan, the people\nknew that God is no respecter of persons, and that He will surely\npunish the transgressor.\nThe history of Israel was to be placed on record for the instruction\nand warning of coming generations. Men of all future time must see\nthe God of heaven as an impartial ruler, in no case justifying sin. But\nfew realize the exceeding sinfulness of sin. Men flatter themselves\nthat God is too good to punish the transgressor. But in the light of\nBible history it is evident that God\u2019s goodness and His love engage\nHim to deal with sin as an evil fatal to the peace and happiness of\nthe universe.\nNot even the integrity and faithfulness of Moses could avert\nthe retribution of his fault. God had forgiven the people greater\ntransgressions, but He could not deal with sin in the leaders as in\nthose who were led. He had honored Moses above every other man\nupon the earth. He had revealed to him His glory, and through him\nHe had communicated His statutes to Israel. The fact that Moses had\nenjoyed so great light and knowledge made his sin more grievous.\nPast faithfulness will not atone for one wrong act. The greater the\nlight and privileges granted to man, the greater is his responsibility,\nthe more aggravated his failure, and the heavier his punishment.\nMoses was not guilty of a great crime, as men would view the\nmatter; his sin was one of common occurrence. The psalmist says\nthat \u201che spake unadvisedly with his lips.\u201d Psalm 106:33. To human\njudgment this may seem a light thing; but if God dealt so severely\nwith this sin in His most faithful and honored servant, He will not\nexcuse it in others. The spirit of self-exaltation, the disposition to\nSmitten Rock 379\ncensure our brethren, is displeasing to God. Those who indulge in\nthese evils cast doubt upon the work of God, and give the skeptical\nan excuse for their unbelief. The more important one\u2019s position, and\nthe greater his influence, the greater is the necessity that he should\ncultivate patience and humility.\nIf the children of God, especially those who stand in positions of [421]\nresponsibility, can be led to take to themselves the glory that is due\nto God, Satan exults. He has gained a victory. It was thus that he fell.\nThus he is most successful in tempting others to ruin. It is to place\nus on our guard against his devices that God has given in His word\nso many lessons teaching the danger of self-exaltation. There is not\nan impulse of our nature, not a faculty of the mind or an inclination\nof the heart, but needs to be, moment by moment, under the control\nof the Spirit of God. There is not a blessing which God bestows\nupon man, nor a trial which He permits to befall him, but Satan both\ncan and will seize upon it to tempt, to harass and destroy the soul,\nif we give him the least advantage. Therefore however great one\u2019s\nspiritual light, however much he may enjoy of the divine favor and\nblessing, he should ever walk humbly before the Lord, pleading in\nfaith that God will direct every thought and control every impulse.\nAll who profess godliness are under the most sacred obligation\nto guard the spirit, and to exercise self-control under the greatest\nprovocation. The burdens placed upon Moses were very great; few\nmen will ever be so severely tried as he was; yet this was not allowed\nto excuse his sin. God has made ample provision for His people; and\nif they rely upon His strength, they will never become the sport of\ncircumstances. The strongest temptation cannot excuse sin. However\ngreat the pressure brought to bear upon the soul, transgression is\nour own act. It is not in the power of earth or hell to compel anyone\nto do evil. Satan attacks us at our weak points, but we need not\nbe overcome. However severe or unexpected the assault, God has\nprovided help for us, and in His strength we may conquer.\nChapter 38\u2014The Journey Around Edom[422]\nThis chapter is based on Numbers 20:14-29; 21:1-9.\nThe encampment of Israel at Kadesh was but a short distance\nfrom the borders of Edom, and both Moses and the people greatly\ndesired to follow the route through this country to the Promised\nLand; accordingly they sent a message, as God had directed them,\nto the Edomite king\u2014\n\u201cThus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that\nhath befallen us: how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we\nhave dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our\nfathers: and when we cried unto the Lord, He heard our voice, and\nsent an Angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold,\nwe are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border. Let us pass,\nI pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields,\nor through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the\nwells: we will go by the king\u2019s highway, we will not turn to the right\nhand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.\u201d\nTo this courteous request a threatening refusal was returned:\n\u201cThou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the\nsword.\u201d\nSurprised at this repulse, the leaders of Israel sent a second\nappeal to the king, with the promise, \u201cWe will go by the highway:\nand if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will\nonly, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.\u201d\n\u201cThou shalt not go through,\u201d was the answer. Armed bands of\nEdomites were already posted at the difficult passes, so that any\npeaceful advance in that direction was impossible, and the Hebrews\nwere forbidden to resort to force. They must make the long journey\naround the land of Edom.\nHad the people, when brought into trial, trusted in God, the\nCaptain of the Lord\u2019s host would have led them through Edom, and[423]\nthe fear of them would have rested upon the inhabitants of the land,\n380\nJourney Around Edom 381\nso that, instead of manifesting hostility, they would have shown them\nfavor. But the Israelites did not act promptly upon God\u2019s word, and\nwhile they were complaining and murmuring, the golden opportunity\npassed. When they were at last ready to present their request to the\nking, it was refused. Ever since they left Egypt, Satan had been\nsteadily at work to throw hindrances and temptations in their way,\nthat they might not inherit Canaan. And by their own unbelief they\nhad repeatedly opened the door for him to resist the purpose of God.\nIt is important to believe God\u2019s word and act upon it promptly,\nwhile His angels are waiting to work for us. Evil angels are ready to\ncontest every step of advance. And when God\u2019s providence bids His\nchildren go forward, when He is ready to do great things for them,\nSatan tempts them to displease the Lord by hesitation and delay; he\nseeks to kindle a spirit of strife or to arouse murmuring or unbelief,\nand thus deprive them of the blessings that God desired to bestow.\nGod\u2019s servants should be minutemen, ever ready to move as fast as\nHis providence opens the way. And delay on their part gives time\nfor Satan to work to defeat them.\nIn the directions first given to Moses concerning their passage\nthrough Edom, after declaring that the Edomites should be afraid\nof Israel, the Lord had forbidden His people to make use of this\nadvantage against them. Because the power of God was engaged for\nIsrael, and the fears of the Edomites would make them an easy prey,\nthe Hebrews were not therefore to prey upon them. The command\ngiven them was, \u201cTake ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:\nmeddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not\nso much as a foot breadth; because I have given Mount Seir unto\nEsau for a possession.\u201d Deuteronomy 2:4, 5. The Edomites were\ndescendants of Abraham and Isaac, and for the sake of these His\nservants, God had shown favor to the children of Esau. He had given\nthem Mount Seir for a possession, and they were not to be disturbed\nunless by their sins they should place themselves beyond the reach\nof His mercy. The Hebrews were to dispossess and utterly destroy\nthe inhabitants of Canaan, who had filled up the measure of their\niniquity but the Edomites were still probationers, and as such were\nto be mercifully dealt with. God delights in mercy, and He manifests\nHis compassion before He inflicts His judgments. He teaches Israel [424]\n382 Patriarchs and Prophets\nto spare the people of Edom, before requiring them to destroy the\ninhabitants of Canaan.\nThe ancestors of Edom and Israel were brothers, and brotherly\nkindness and courtesy should exist between them. The Israelites\nwere forbidden, either then or at any future time, to revenge the\naffront given them in the refusal of passage through the land. They\nmust not expect to possess any part of the land of Edom. While the\nIsraelites were the chosen and favored people of God, they must\nheed the restrictions which He placed upon them. God had promised\nthem a goodly inheritance; but they were not to feel that they alone\nhad any rights in the earth, and seek to crowd out all others. They\nwere directed, in all their intercourse with the Edomites, to beware\nof doing them injustice. They were to trade with them, buying such\nsupplies as were needed, and promptly paying for all they received.\nAs an encouragement to Israel to trust in God and obey His word\nthey were reminded, \u201cThe Lord thy God hath blessed thee; ... thou\nhast lacked nothing.\u201d Deuteronomy 2:7. They were not dependent\nupon the Edomites, for they had a God rich in resources. They must\nnot by force or fraud seek to obtain anything pertaining to them; but\nin all their intercourse they should exemplify the principle of the\ndivine law, \u201cThou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d\nHad they in this manner passed through Edom, as God had\npurposed, the passage would have proved a blessing, not only to\nthemselves, but to the inhabitants of the land; for it would have\ngiven them an opportunity to become acquainted with God\u2019s people\nand His worship and to witness how the God of Jacob prospered\nthose who loved and feared Him . But all this the unbelief of Israel\nhad prevented. God had given the people water in answer to their\nclamors, but He permitted their unbelief to work out its punishment.\nAgain they must traverse the desert and quench their thirst from the\nmiraculous spring, which, had they but trusted in Him , they would\nno longer have needed.\nAccordingly the hosts of Israel again turned toward the south,\nand made their way over sterile wastes, that seemed even more\ndreary after a glimpse of the green spots among the hills and valleys\nof Edom. From the mountain range overlooking this gloomy desert,\nrises Mount Hor, whose summit was to be the place of Aaron\u2019s death\nJourney Around Edom 383\nand burial. When the Israelites came to this mountain, the divine\ncommand was addressed to Moses\u2014\n\u201cTake Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto Mount [425]\nHor: and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar\nhis son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die\nthere.\u201d\nTogether these two aged men and the younger one toiled up the\nmountain height. The heads of Moses and Aaron were white with\nthe snows of sixscore winters. Their long and eventful lives had\nbeen marked with the deepest trials and the greatest honors that had\never fallen to the lot of man. They were men of great natural ability,\nand all their powers had been developed, exalted, and dignified by\ncommunion with the Infinite One. Their life had been spent in\nunselfish labor for God and their fellow men; their countenances\ngave evidence of great intellectual power, firmness and nobility of\npurpose, and strong affections.\nMany years Moses and Aaron had stood side by side in their\ncares and labors. Together they had breasted unnumbered dangers,\nand had shared together the signal blessing of God; but the time\nwas at hand when they must be separated. They moved on very\nslowly, for every moment in each other\u2019s society was precious. The\nascent was steep and toilsome; and as they often paused to rest,\nthey communed together of the past and the future. Before them, as\nfar as the eye could reach, was spread out the scene of their desert\nwanderings. In the plain below were encamped the vast hosts of\nIsrael, for whom these chosen men had spent the best portion of their\nlives; for whose welfare they had felt so deep an interest, and made\nso great sacrifices. Somewhere beyond the mountains of Edom was\nthe path leading to the Promised Land\u2014that land whose blessings\nMoses and Aaron were not to enjoy. No rebellious feelings found\na place in their hearts, no expression of murmuring escaped their\nlips; yet a solemn sadness rested upon their countenances as they\nremembered what had debarred them from the inheritance of their\nfathers.\nAaron\u2019s work for Israel was done. Forty years before, at the\nage of eighty-three, God had called him to unite with Moses in his\ngreat and important mission. He had co-operated with his brother\nin leading the children of Israel from Egypt. He had held up the\n384 Patriarchs and Prophets\ngreat leader\u2019s hands when the Hebrew hosts gave battle to Amalek.\nHe had been permitted to ascend Mount Sinai, to approach into the\npresence of God, and to behold the divine glory. The Lord had\nconferred upon the family of Aaron the office of the priesthood, and[426]\nhad honored him with the sacred consecration of high priest. He\nhad sustained him in the holy office by the terrible manifestations of\ndivine judgment in the destruction of Korah and his company. It was\nthrough Aaron\u2019s intercession that the plague was stayed. When his\ntwo sons were slain for disregarding God\u2019s express command, he did\nnot rebel or even murmur. Yet the record of his noble life had been\nmarred. Aaron committed a grievous sin when he yielded to the\nclamors of the people and made the golden calf at Sinai; and again,\nwhen he united with Miriam in envy and murmuring against Moses.\nAnd he, with Moses, offended the Lord at Kadesh by disobeying the\ncommand to speak to the rock that it might give forth its water.\nGod intended that these great leaders of His people should be\nrepresentatives of Christ. Aaron bore the names of Israel upon his\nbreast. He communicated to the people the will of God. He entered\nthe most holy place on the Day of Atonement, \u201cnot without blood,\u201d\nas a mediator for all Israel. He came forth from that work to bless\nthe congregation, as Christ will come forth to bless His waiting\npeople when His work of atonement in their behalf shall be ended.\nIt was the exalted character of that sacred office as representative of\nour great High Priest that made Aaron\u2019s sin at Kadesh of so great\nmagnitude.\nWith deep sorrow Moses removed from Aaron the holy vest-\nments, and placed them upon Eleazar, who thus became his successor\nby divine appointment. For his sin at Kadesh, Aaron was denied\nthe privilege of officiating as God\u2019s high priest in Canaan\u2014of offer-\ning the first sacrifice in the goodly land, and thus consecrating the\ninheritance of Israel. Moses was to continue to bear his burden in\nleading the people to the very borders of Canaan. He was to come\nwithin sight of the Promised Land, but was not to enter it. Had these\nservants of God, when they stood before the rock at Kadesh, borne\nunmurmuringly the test there brought upon them, how different\nwould have been their future! A wrong act can never be undone. It\nmay be that the work of a lifetime will not recover what has been\nlost in a single moment of temptation or even thoughtlessness.\nJourney Around Edom 385\nThe absence from the camp of the two great leaders, and the\nfact that they had been accompanied by Eleazar, who, it was well\nknown, was to be Aaron\u2019s successor in holy office, awakened a\nfeeling of apprehension, and their return was anxiously awaited. As [427]\nthe people looked about them, upon their vast congregation, they\nsaw that nearly all the adults who left Egypt had perished in the\nwilderness. All felt a foreboding of evil as they remembered the\nsentence pronounced against Moses and Aaron. Some were aware\nof the object of that mysterious journey to the summit of Mount\nHor, and their solicitude for their leaders was heightened by bitter\nmemories and self-accusings.\nThe forms of Moses and Eleazar were at last discerned, slowly\ndescending the mountainside, but Aaron was not with them. Upon\nEleazar were the sacerdotal garments, showing that he had succeeded\nhis father in the sacred office. As the people with heavy hearts\ngathered about their leader, Moses told them that Aaron had died\nin his arms upon Mount Hor, and that they there buried him. The\ncongregation broke forth in mourning and lamentation, for they all\nloved Aaron, though they had so often caused him sorrow. \u201cThey\nmourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.\u201d\nConcerning the burial of Israel\u2019s high priest, the Scriptures give\nonly the simple record, \u201cThere Aaron died, and there he was buried.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 10:6. In what striking contrast to the customs of\nthe present day was this burial, conducted according to the express\ncommand of God. In modern times the funeral services of a man\nof high position are often made the occasion of ostentatious and\nextravagant display. When Aaron died, one of the most illustrious\nmen that ever lived, there were only two of his nearest friends to\nwitness his death and to attend his burial. And that lonely grave\nupon Mount Hor was forever hidden from the sight of Israel. God is\nnot honored in the great display so often made over the dead, and the\nextravagant expense incurred in returning their bodies to the dust.\nThe whole congregation sorrowed for Aaron, yet they could not\nfeel the loss so keenly as did Moses. The death of Aaron forcibly\nreminded Moses that his own end was near; but short as the time\nof his stay on earth must be, he deeply felt the loss of his constant\ncompanion\u2014the one who had shared his joys and sorrows, his hopes\nand fears, for so many long years. Moses must now continue the\n386 Patriarchs and Prophets\nwork alone; but he knew that God was his friend, and upon Him he\nleaned more heavily.\nSoon after leaving Mount Hor the Israelites suffered defeat in[428]\nan engagement with Arad, one of the Canaanite kings. But as they\nearnestly sought help from God, divine aid was granted them, and\ntheir enemies were routed. This victory, instead of inspiring gratitude\nand leading the people to feel their dependence upon God, made\nthem boastful and self-confident. Soon they fell into the old habit of\nmurmuring. They were now dissatisfied because the armies of Israel\nhad not been permitted to advance upon Canaan immediately after\ntheir rebellion at the report of the spies nearly forty years before.\nThey pronounced their long sojourn in the wilderness an unnecessary\ndelay, reasoning that they might have conquered their enemies as\neasily heretofore as now.\nAs they continued their journey toward the south, their route lay\nthrough a hot, sandy valley, destitute of shade or vegetation. The\nway seemed long and difficult, and they suffered from weariness and\nthirst. Again they failed to endure the test of their faith and patience.\nBy continually dwelling on the dark side of their experiences, they\nseparated themselves farther and farther from God. They lost sight\nof the fact that but for their murmuring when the water ceased at\nKadesh, they would have been spared the journey around Edom.\nGod had purposed better things for them. Their hearts should have\nbeen filled with gratitude to Him that He had punished their sin so\nlightly. But instead of this, they flattered themselves that if God and\nMoses had not interfered, they might now have been in possession of\nthe Promised Land. After bringing trouble upon themselves, making\ntheir lot altogether harder than God designed, they charged all their\nmisfortunes upon Him. Thus they cherished bitter thoughts concern-\ning His dealings with them, and finally they became discontented\nwith everything. Egypt looked brighter and more desirable than\nliberty and the land to which God was leading them.\nAs the Israelites indulged the spirit of discontent, they were\ndisposed to find fault even with their blessings. \u201cAnd the people\nspake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought\nus up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread,\nneither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.\u201d\nJourney Around Edom 387\nMoses faithfully set before the people their great sin. It was\nGod\u2019s power alone that had preserved them in \u201cthat great and terrible\nwilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, [429]\nwhere there was no water.\u201d Deuteronomy 8:15. Every day of their\ntravels they had been kept by a miracle of divine mercy. In all the\nway of God\u2019s leading they had found water to refresh the thirsty,\nbread from heaven to satisfy their hunger, and peace and safety under\nthe shadowy cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. Angels had\nministered to them as they climbed the rocky heights or threaded\nthe rugged paths of the wilderness. Notwithstanding the hardships\nthey had endured, there was not a feeble one in all their ranks. Their\nfeet had not swollen in their long journeys, neither had their clothes\ngrown old. God had subdued before them the fierce beasts of prey\nand the venomous reptiles of the forest and the desert. If with all\nthese tokens of His love the people still continued to complain, the\nLord would withdraw His protection until they should be led to\nappreciate His merciful care, and return to Him with repentance and\nhumiliation.\nBecause they had been shielded by divine power they had not\nrealized the countless dangers by which they were continually sur-\nrounded. In their ingratitude and unbelief they had anticipated death,\nand now the Lord permitted death to come upon them. The poi-\nsonous serpents that infested the wilderness were called fiery ser-\npents, on account of the terrible effects produced by their sting, it\ncausing violent inflammation and speedy death. As the protecting\nhand of God was removed from Israel, great numbers of the people\nwere attacked by these venomous creatures.\nNow there was terror and confusion throughout the encampment.\nIn almost every tent were the dying or the dead. None were secure.\nOften the silence of night was broken by piercing cries that told\nof fresh victims. All were busy in ministering to the sufferers, or\nwith agonizing care endeavoring to protect those who were not yet\nstricken. No murmuring now escaped their lips. When compared\nwith the present suffering, their former difficulties and trials seemed\nunworthy of a thought.\nThe people now humbled themselves before God. They came to\nMoses with their confessions and entreaties. \u201cWe have sinned,\u201d they\nsaid, \u201cfor we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee.\u201d Only\n388 Patriarchs and Prophets\na little before, they had accused him of being their worst enemy, the\ncause of all their distress and afflictions. But even when the words\nwere upon their lips, they knew that the charge was false; and as\nsoon as real trouble came they fled to him as the only one who could[430]\nintercede with God for them. \u201cPray unto the Lord,\u201d was their cry,\n\u201cthat He take away the serpents from us.\u201d\nMoses was divinely commanded to make a serpent of brass\nresembling the living ones, and to elevate it among the people. To\nthis, all who had been bitten were to look, and they would find\nrelief. He did so, and the joyful news was sounded throughout\nthe encampment that all who had been bitten might look upon the\nbrazen serpent and live. Many had already died, and when Moses\nraised the serpent upon the pole, some would not believe that merely\ngazing upon that metallic image would heal them; these perished in\ntheir unbelief. Yet there were many who had faith in the provision\nwhich God had made. Fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters were\nanxiously engaged in helping their suffering, dying friends to fix\ntheir languid eyes upon the serpent. If these, though faint and dying,\ncould only once look, they were perfectly restored.\nThe people well knew that there was no power in the serpent\nof brass to cause such a change in those who looked upon it. The\nhealing virtue was from God alone. In His wisdom He chose this\nway of displaying His power. By this simple means the people were\nmade to realize that this affliction had been brought upon them by\ntheir sins. They were also assured that while obeying God they had\nno reason to fear, for He would preserve them.\nThe lifting up of the brazen serpent was to teach Israel an impor-\ntant lesson. They could not save themselves from the fatal effect of\nthe poison in their wounds. God alone was able to heal them. Yet\nthey were required to show their faith in the provision which He had\nmade. They must look in order to live. It was their faith that was\nacceptable with God, and by looking upon the serpent their faith\nwas shown. They knew that there was no virtue in the serpent itself,\nbut it was a symbol of Christ; and the necessity of faith in His merits\nwas thus presented to their minds. Heretofore many had brought\ntheir offerings to God, and had felt that in so doing they made ample\natonement for their sins. They did not rely upon the Redeemer to\ncome, of whom these offerings were only a type. The Lord would\nJourney Around Edom 389\nnow teach them that their sacrifices, in themselves, had no more\npower or virtue than the serpent of brass, but were, like that, to lead\ntheir minds to Christ, the great sin offering.\n\u201cAs Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,\u201d even so was [431]\nthe Son of man \u201clifted up: that whosoever believeth in Him should\nnot perish, but have eternal life.\u201d John 3:14, 15. All who have ever\nlived upon the earth have felt the deadly sting of \u201cthat old serpent,\ncalled the devil, and Satan.\u201d Revelation 12:9. The fatal effects of\nsin can be removed only by the provision that God has made. The\nIsraelites saved their lives by looking upon the uplifted serpent. That\nlook implied faith. They lived because they believed God\u2019s word,\nand trusted in the means provided for their recovery. So the sinner\nmay look to Christ, and live. He receives pardon through faith in the\natoning sacrifice. Unlike the inert and lifeless symbol, Christ has\npower and virtue in Himself to heal the repenting sinner.\nWhile the sinner cannot save himself, he still has something to\ndo to secure salvation. \u201cHim that cometh to Me,\u201d says Christ, \u201cI will\nin no wise cast out.\u201d John 6:37. But we must come to Him ; and\nwhen we repent of our sins, we must believe that He accepts and\npardons us. Faith is the gift of God, but the power to exercise it is\nours. Faith is the hand by which the soul takes hold upon the divine\noffers of grace and mercy.\nNothing but the righteousness of Christ can entitle us to one of\nthe blessings of the covenant of grace. There are many who have\nlong desired and tried to obtain these blessings, but have not received\nthem, because they have cherished the idea that they could do some-\nthing to make themselves worthy of them. They have not looked\naway from self, believing that Jesus is an all-sufficient Saviour. We\nmust not think that our own merits will save us; Christ is our only\nhope of salvation. \u201cFor there is none other name under heaven given\namong men, whereby we must be saved.\u201d Acts 4:12.\nWhen we trust God fully, when we rely upon the merits of Jesus\nas a sin-pardoning Saviour, we shall receive all the help that we\ncan desire. Let none look to self, as though they had power to save\nthemselves. Jesus died for us because we were helpless to do this.\nIn Him is our hope, our justification, our righteousness. When we\nsee our sinfulness we should not despond and fear that we have no\nSaviour, or that He has no thoughts of mercy toward us. At this very\n390 Patriarchs and Prophets\ntime He is inviting us to come to Him in our helplessness and be\nsaved.\nMany of the Israelites saw no help in the remedy which Heaven[432]\nhad appointed. The dead and dying were all around them, and\nthey knew that, without divine aid, their own fate was certain; but\nthey continued to lament their wounds, their pains, their sure death,\nuntil their strength was gone, and their eyes were glazed, when they\nmight have had instant healing. If we are conscious of our needs,\nwe should not devote all our powers to mourning over them. While\nwe realize our helpless condition without Christ, we are not to yield\nto discouragement, but rely upon the merits of a crucified and risen\nSaviour. Look and live. Jesus has pledged His word; He will save\nall who come unto Him. Though millions who need to be healed\nwill reject His offered mercy, not one who trusts in His merits will\nbe left to perish.\nMany are unwilling to accept of Christ until the whole mystery\nof the plan of salvation shall be made plain to them. They refuse the\nlook of faith, although they see that thousands have looked, and have\nfelt the efficacy of looking, to the cross of Christ. Many wander in\nthe mazes of philosophy, in search of reasons and evidence which\nthey will never find, while they reject the evidence which God has\nbeen pleased to give. They refuse to walk in the light of the Sun of\nRighteousness, until the reason of its shining shall be explained. All\nwho persist in this course will fail to come to a knowledge of the\ntruth. God will never remove every occasion for doubt. He gives\nsufficient evidence on which to base faith, and if this is not accepted,\nthe mind is left in darkness. If those who were bitten by the serpents\nhad stopped to doubt and question before they would consent to\nlook, they would have perished. It is our duty, first, to look; and the\nlook of faith will give us life.\nChapter 39\u2014The Conquest of Bashan [433]\nThis chapter is based on Deuteronomy 2; 3:1-11.\nAfter passing to the south of Edom, the Israelites turned north-\nward, and again set their faces toward the Promised Land. Their\nroute now lay over a vast, elevated plain, swept by cool, fresh breezes\nfrom the hills. It was a welcome change from the parched valley\nthrough which they had been traveling, and they pressed forward,\nbuoyant and hopeful. Having crossed the brook Zered, they passed\nto the east of the land of Moab; for the command had been given,\n\u201cDistress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I\nwill not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given\nAr unto the children of Lot.\u201d And the same direction was repeated\nconcerning the Ammonites, who were also descendants of Lot.\nStill pushing northward, the hosts of Israel soon reached the\ncountry of the Amorites. This strong and warlike people originally\noccupied the southern part of the land of Canaan; but, increasing\nin numbers, they crossed the Jordan, made war upon the Moabites,\nand gained possession of a portion of their territory. Here they\nhad settled, holding undisputed sway over all the land from the\nArnon as far north as the Jabbok. The route to the Jordan which\nthe Israelites desired to pursue lay directly through this territory,\nand Moses sent a friendly message to Sihon, the Amorite king, at\nhis capital: \u201cLet me pass through thy land: I will go along by the\nhighway, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. Thou\nshalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for\nmoney, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet.\u201d The\nanswer was a decided refusal, and all the hosts of the Amorites were\nsummoned to oppose the progress of the invaders. This formidable\narmy struck terror to the Israelites, who were poorly prepared for\nan encounter with well-armed and well-disciplined forces. So far as\nskill in warfare was concerned, their enemies had the advantage. To [434]\nall human appearance, a speedy end would be made of Israel.\n391\n392 Patriarchs and Prophets\nBut Moses kept his gaze fixed upon the cloudy pillar, and encour-\naged the people with the thought that the token of God\u2019s presence\nwas still with them. At the same time he directed them to do all\nthat human power could do in preparing for war. Their enemies\nwere eager for battle, and confident that they would blot out the\nunprepared Israelites from the land. But from the Possessor of all\nlands the mandate had gone forth to the leader of Israel: \u201cRise ye\nup, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have\ngiven into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his\nland: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. This day\nwill I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the\nnations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of\nthee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.\u201d\nThese nations on the borders of Canaan would have been spared,\nhad they not stood, in defiance of God\u2019s word, to oppose the progress\nof Israel. The Lord had shown Himself to be long-suffering, of great\nkindness and tender pity, even to these heathen peoples. When\nAbraham was shown in vision that his seed, the children of Israel,\nshould be strangers in a strange land four hundred years, the Lord\ngave him the promise, \u201cIn the fourth generation they shall come\nhither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.\u201d Genesis\n15:16. Although the Amorites were idolaters, whose life was justly\nforfeited by their great wickedness, God spared them four hundred\nyears to give them unmistakable evidence that He was the only true\nGod, the Maker of heaven and earth. All His wonders in bringing\nIsrael from Egypt were known to them. Sufficient evidence was\ngiven; they might have known the truth, had they been willing to\nturn from their idolatry and licentiousness. But they rejected the\nlight and clung to their idols.\nWhen the Lord brought His people a second time to the bor-\nders of Canaan, additional evidence of His power was granted to\nthose heathen nations. They saw that God was with Israel in the\nvictory gained over King Arad and the Canaanites, and in the mira-\ncle wrought to save those who were perishing from the sting of the\nserpents. Although the Israelites had been refused a passage through\nthe land of Edom, thus being compelled to take the long and difficult[435]\nroute by the Red Sea, yet in all their journeyings and encampments,\npast the land of Edom, of Moab and Ammon, they had shown no\nConquest of Bashan 393\nhostility, and had done no injury to the people or their possessions.\nOn reaching the border of the Amorites, Israel had asked permission\nonly to travel directly through the country, promising to observe the\nsame rules that had governed their intercourse with other nations.\nWhen the Amorite king refused this courteous solicitation, and defi-\nantly gathered his hosts for battle, their cup of iniquity was full, and\nGod would now exercise His power for their overthrow.\nThe Israelites crossed the river Arnon and advanced upon the\nfoe. An engagement took place, in which the armies of Israel were\nvictorious; and, following up the advantage gained, they were soon\nin possession of the country of the Amorites. It was the Captain\nof the Lord\u2019s host who vanquished the enemies of His people; and\nHe would have done the same thirty-eight years before had Israel\ntrusted in Him .\nFilled with hope and courage, the army of Israel eagerly pressed\nforward, and, still journeying northward, they soon reached a country\nthat might well test their courage and their faith in God. Before\nthem lay the powerful and populous kingdom of Bashan, crowded\nwith great stone cities that to this day excite the wonder of the\nworld\u2014\u201cthreescore cities ... with high walls, gates, and bars; besides\nunwalled towns a great many.\u201d Deuteronomy 3:1-11. The houses\nwere constructed of huge black stones, of such stupendous size\nas to make the buildings absolutely impregnable to any force that\nin those times could have been brought against them. It was a\ncountry filled with wild caverns, lofty precipices, yawning gulfs,\nand rocky strongholds. The inhabitants of this land, descendants\nfrom a giant race, were themselves of marvelous size and strength,\nand so distinguished for violence and cruelty as to be the terror\nof all surrounding nations; while Og, the king of the country, was\nremarkable for size and prowess, even in a nation of giants.\nBut the cloudy pillar moved forward, and following its guidance\nthe Hebrew hosts advanced to Edrei, where the giant king, with his\nforces, awaited their approach. Og had skillfully chosen the place of\nbattle. The city of Edrei was situated upon the border of a tableland\nrising abruptly from the plain, and covered with jagged, volcanic\nrocks. It could be approached only by narrow pathways, steep and [436]\ndifficult of ascent. In case of defeat, his forces could find refuge in\n394 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthat wilderness of rocks, where it would be impossible for strangers\nto follow them.\nConfident of success, the king came forth with an immense army\nupon the open plain, while shouts of defiance were heard from the\ntableland above, where might be seen the spears of thousands, eager\nfor the fray. When the Hebrews looked upon the lofty form of that\ngiant of giants towering above the soldiers of his army; when they\nsaw the hosts that surrounded him, and beheld the seemingly im-\npregnable fortress, behind which unseen thousands were entrenched,\nthe hearts of many in Israel quaked with fear. But Moses was calm\nand firm; the Lord had said concerning the king of Bashan, \u201cFear\nhim not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into\nthy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king\nof the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.\u201d\nThe calm faith of their leader inspired the people with confidence\nin God. They trusted all to His omnipotent arm, and He did not\nfail them. Not mighty giants nor walled cities, armed hosts nor\nrocky fortresses, could stand before the Captain of the Lord\u2019s host.\nThe Lord led the army; the Lord discomfited the enemy; the Lord\nconquered in behalf of Israel. The giant king and his army were\ndestroyed, and the Israelites soon took possession of the whole\ncountry. Thus was blotted from the earth that strange people who\nhad given themselves up to iniquity and abominable idolatry.\nIn the conquest of Gilead and Bashan there were many who\nrecalled the events which nearly forty years before had, in Kadesh,\ndoomed Israel to the long desert wandering. They saw that the report\nof the spies concerning the Promised Land was in many respects\ncorrect. The cities were walled and very great, and were inhabited by\ngiants, in comparison with whom the Hebrews were mere pygmies.\nBut they could now see that the fatal mistake of their fathers had\nbeen in distrusting the power of God. This alone had prevented them\nfrom at once entering the goodly land.\nWhen they were at the first preparing to enter Canaan, the un-\ndertaking was attended with far less difficulty than now. God had\npromised His people that if they would obey His voice He would go\nbefore them and fight for them; and He would also send hornets to[437]\ndrive out the inhabitants of the land. The fears of the nations had\nnot been generally aroused, and little preparation had been made to\nConquest of Bashan 395\noppose their progress. But when the Lord now bade Israel go for-\nward, they must advance against alert and powerful foes, and must\ncontend with large and well-trained armies that had been preparing\nto resist their approach.\nIn their contest with Og and Sihon the people were brought to the\nsame test beneath which their fathers had so signally failed. But the\ntrial was now far more severe than when God had commanded Israel\nto go forward. The difficulties in their way had greatly increased\nsince they refused to advance when bidden to do so in the name of\nthe Lord. It is thus that God still tests His people. And if they fail\nto endure the trial, He brings them again to the same point, and the\nsecond time the trial will come closer, and be more severe than the\npreceding. This is continued until they bear the test, or, if they are\nstill rebellious, God withdraws His light from them and leaves them\nin darkness.\nThe Hebrews now remembered how once before, when their\nforces had gone to battle, they had been routed, and thousands slain.\nBut they had then gone in direct opposition to the command of God.\nThey had gone out without Moses, God\u2019s appointed leader, without\nthe cloudy pillar, the symbol of the divine presence, and without the\nark. But now Moses was with them, strengthening their hearts with\nwords of hope and faith; the Son of God, enshrined in the cloudy\npillar, led the way; and the sacred ark accompanied the host. This\nexperience has a lesson for us. The mighty God of Israel is our\nGod. In Him we may trust, and if we obey His requirements He\nwill work for us in as signal a manner as He did for His ancient\npeople. Everyone who seeks to follow the path of duty will at times\nbe assailed by doubt and unbelief. The way will sometimes be so\nbarred by obstacles, apparently insurmountable, as to dishearten\nthose who will yield to discouragement; but God is saying to such,\nGo forward. Do your duty at any cost. The difficulties that seem so\nformidable, that fill your soul with dread, will vanish as you move\nforward in the path of obedience, humbly trusting in God.\nChapter 40\u2014Balaam[438]\nThis chapter is based on Numbers 22 to 24.\nReturning to the Jordan from the conquest of Bashan, the Is-\nraelites, in preparation for the immediate invasion of Canaan, en-\ncamped beside the river, above its entrance into the Dead Sea, and\njust opposite the plain of Jericho. They were upon the very bor-\nders of Moab, and the Moabites were filled with terror at the close\nproximity of the invaders.\nThe people of Moab had not been molested by Israel, yet they\nhad watched with troubled forebodings all that had taken place in\nthe surrounding countries. The Amorites, before whom they had\nbeen forced to retreat, had been conquered by the Hebrews, and the\nterritory which the Amorites had wrested from Moab was now in\nthe possession of Israel. The hosts of Bashan had yielded before\nthe mysterious power enshrouded in the cloudy pillar, and the giant\nstrongholds were occupied by the Hebrews. The Moabites dared not\nrisk an attack upon them; an appeal to arms was hopeless in face\nof the supernatural agencies that wrought in their behalf. But they\ndetermined, as Pharaoh had done, to enlist the power of sorcery to\ncounteract the work of God. They would bring a curse upon Israel.\nThe people of Moab were closely connected with the Midianites,\nboth by the ties of nationality and religion. And Balak, the king of\nMoab, aroused the fears of the kindred people, and secured their\nco-operation in his designs against Israel by the message, \u201cNow shall\nthis company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up\nthe grass of the field.\u201d Balaam, an inhabitant of Mesopotamia, was\nreported to possess supernatural powers, and his fame had reached\nto the land of Moab. It was determined to call him to their aid.\nAccordingly, messengers of \u201cthe elders of Moab and the elders\nof Midian,\u201d were sent to secure his divinations and enchantments\nagainst Israel.\nThe ambassadors at once set out on their long journey over the[439]\n396\nBalaam 397\nmountains and across the deserts to Mesopotamia; and upon finding\nBalaam, they delivered to him the message of their king: \u201cBehold,\nthere is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face\nof the earth, and they abide over against me: come now therefore,\nI pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me:\nperadventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may\ndrive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is\nblessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.\u201d\nBalaam was once a good man and a prophet of God; but he had\napostatized, and had given himself up to covetousness; yet he still\nprofessed to be a servant of the Most High. He was not ignorant of\nGod\u2019s work in behalf of Israel; and when the messengers announced\ntheir errand, he well knew that it was his duty to refuse the rewards of\nBalak and to dismiss the ambassadors. But he ventured to dally with\ntemptation, and urged the messengers to tarry with him that night,\ndeclaring that he could give no decided answer till he had asked\ncounsel of the Lord. Balaam knew that his curse could not harm\nIsrael. God was on their side, and so long as they were true to Him\nno adverse power of earth or hell could prevail against them. But his\npride was flattered by the words of the ambassadors, \u201cHe whom thou\nblessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.\u201d The bribe of\ncostly gifts and prospective exaltation excited his covetousness. He\ngreedily accepted the offered treasures, and then, while professing\nstrict obedience to the will of God, he tried to comply with the\ndesires of Balak.\nIn the night season the angel of God came to Balaam with the\nmessage, \u201cThou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the\npeople: for they are blessed.\u201d\nIn the morning Balaam reluctantly dismissed the messengers,\nbut he did not tell them what the Lord had said. Angry that his\nvisions of gain and honor had been suddenly dispelled, he petulantly\nexclaimed, \u201cGet you into your land: for the Lord refuseth to give\nme leave to go with you.\u201d\nBalaam \u201cloved the wages of unrighteousness.\u201d 2 Peter 2:15. The\nsin of covetousness, which God declares to be idolatry, had made\nhim a timeserver, and through this one fault Satan gained entire [440]\ncontrol of him. It was this that caused his ruin. The tempter is ever\npresenting worldly gain and honor to entice men from the service\n398 Patriarchs and Prophets\nof God. He tells them it is their overconscientiousness that keeps\nthem from prosperity. Thus many are induced to venture out of the\npath of strict integrity. One wrong step makes the next easier, and\nthey become more and more presumptuous. They will do and dare\nmost terrible things when once they have given themselves to the\ncontrol of avarice and a desire for power. Many flatter themselves\nthat they can depart from strict integrity for a time, for the sake of\nsome worldly advantage, and that having gained their object, they\ncan change their course when they please. Such are entangling\nthemselves in the snare of Satan, and it is seldom that they escape.\nWhen the messengers reported to Balak the prophet\u2019s refusal to\naccompany them, they did not intimate that God had forbidden him.\nSupposing that Balaam\u2019s delay was merely to secure a richer reward,\nthe king sent princes more in number and more honorable than the\nfirst, with promises of higher honors, and with authority to concede\nto any terms that Balaam might demand. Balak\u2019s urgent message to\nthe prophet was, \u201cLet nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming\nunto me: for I will promote thee unto very great honor, and I will do\nwhatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse\nme this people.\u201d\nA second time Balaam was tested. In response to the solicita-\ntions of the ambassadors he professed great conscientiousness and\nintegrity, assuring them that no amount of gold and silver could in-\nduce him to go contrary to the will of God. But he longed to comply\nwith the king\u2019s request; and although the will of God had already\nbeen definitely made known to him, he urged the messengers to\ntarry, that he might further inquire of God; as though the Infinite\nOne were a man, to be persuaded.\nIn the night season the Lord appeared to Balaam and said, \u201cIf\nthe men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the\nword which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.\u201d Thus far the\nLord would permit Balaam to follow his own will, because he was\ndetermined upon it. He did not seek to do the will of God, but chose\nhis own course, and then endeavored to secure the sanction of the\nLord.\nThere are thousands at the present day who are pursuing a sim-\nilar course. They would have no difficulty in understanding their[441]\nduty if it were in harmony with their inclinations. It is plainly set\nBalaam 399\nbefore them in the Bible or is clearly indicated by circumstances and\nreason. But because these evidences are contrary to their desires and\ninclinations they frequently set them aside and presume to go to God\nto learn their duty. With great apparent conscientiousness they pray\nlong and earnestly for light. But God will not be trifled with. He\noften permits such persons to follow their own desires and to suffer\nthe result. \u201cMy people would not hearken to My voice.... So I gave\nthem up unto their own hearts\u2019 lust: and they walked in their own\ncounsels.\u201d Psalm 81:11, 12. When one clearly sees a duty, let him\nnot presume to go to God with the prayer that he may be excused\nfrom performing it. He should rather, with a humble, submissive\nspirit, ask for divine strength and wisdom to meet its claims.\nThe Moabites were a degraded, idolatrous people; yet according\nto the light which they had received their guilt was not so great in\nthe sight of heaven as was that of Balaam. As he professed to be\nGod\u2019s prophet, however, all he should say would be supposed to be\nuttered by divine authority. Hence he was not to be permitted to\nspeak as he chose, but must deliver the message which God should\ngive him. \u201cThe word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do,\u201d\nwas the divine command.\nBalaam had received permission to go with the messengers from\nMoab if they came in the morning to call him. But, annoyed at his\ndelay, and expecting another refusal, they set out on their homeward\njourney without further consultation with him. Every excuse for\ncomplying with the request of Balak had now been removed. But\nBalaam was determined to secure the reward; and, taking the beast\nupon which he was accustomed to ride, he set out on the journey.\nHe feared that even now the divine permission might be withdrawn,\nand he pressed eagerly forward, impatient lest he should by some\nmeans fail to gain the coveted reward.\nBut \u201cthe angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary\nagainst him.\u201d The animal saw the divine messenger, who was un-\nperceived by the man, and turned aside from the highway into a\nfield. With cruel blows Balaam brought the beast back into the path;\nbut again, in a narrow place shut in by walls, the angel appeared,\nand the animal, trying to avoid the menacing figure, crushed her\nmaster\u2019s foot against the wall. Balaam was blinded to the heavenly\ninterposition, and knew not that God was obstructing his path. The [442]\n400 Patriarchs and Prophets\nman became exasperated, and beating the ass unmercifully, forced it\nto proceed.\nAgain, \u201cin a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to\nthe right hand or to the left,\u201d the angel appeared, as before, in a\nthreatening attitude; and the poor beast, trembling with terror, made\na full stop, and fell to the earth under its rider. Balaam\u2019s rage was\nunbounded, and with his staff he smote the animal more cruelly than\nbefore. God now opened its mouth, and by \u201cthe dumb ass speaking\nwith man\u2019s voice,\u201d he \u201cforbade the madness of the prophet.\u201d 2 Peter\n2:16. \u201cWhat have I done unto thee,\u201d it said, \u201cthat thou hast smitten\nme these three times?\u201d\nFurious at being thus hindered in his journey, Balaam answered\nthe beast as he would have addressed an intelligent being\u2014\u201cBecause\nthou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for\nnow would I kill thee.\u201d Here was a professed magician, on his way\nto pronounce a curse upon a whole people with the intent to paralyze\ntheir strength, while he had not power even to slay the animal upon\nwhich he rode!\nThe eyes of Balaam were now opened, and he beheld the angel\nof God standing with drawn sword ready to slay him. In terror\n\u201che bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.\u201d The angel said\nto him, \u201cWherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times?\nBehold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse\nbefore me: and the ass saw me, and turned from me these three\ntimes: unless she had turned from me surely now also I had slain\nthee, and saved her alive.\u201d\nBalaam owed the preservation of his life to the poor animal that\nhe had treated so cruelly. The man who claimed to be a prophet\nof the Lord, who declared that his eyes were open, and he saw\nthe \u201cvision of the Almighty,\u201d was so blinded by covetousness and\nambition that he could not discern the angel of God visible to his\nbeast. \u201cThe god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which\nbelieve not.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:4. How many are thus blinded! They\nrush on in forbidden paths, transgressing the divine law, and cannot\ndiscern that God and His angels are against them. Like Balaam they\nare angry at those who would prevent their ruin.\nBalaam had given evidence of the spirit that controlled him, by\nhis treatment of his beast. \u201cA righteous man regardeth the life of\nBalaam 401\nhis beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.\u201d Proverbs [443]\n12:10. Few realize as they should the sinfulness of abusing animals\nor leaving them to suffer from neglect. He who created man made\nthe lower animals also, and \u201cHis tender mercies are over all His\nworks.\u201d Psalm 145:9. The animals were created to serve man, but he\nhas no right to cause them pain by harsh treatment or cruel exaction.\nIt is because of man\u2019s sin that \u201cthe whole creation groaneth and\ntravaileth in pain together.\u201d Romans 8:22. Suffering and death were\nthus entailed, not only upon the human race, but upon the animals.\nSurely, then, it becomes man to seek to lighten, instead of increasing,\nthe weight of suffering which his transgression has brought upon\nGod\u2019s creatures. He who will abuse animals because he has them in\nhis power is both a coward and a tyrant. A disposition to cause pain,\nwhether to our fellow men or to the brute creation, is satanic. Many\ndo not realize that their cruelty will ever be known, because the poor\ndumb animals cannot reveal it. But could the eyes of these men be\nopened, as were those of Balaam, they would see an angel of God\nstanding as a witness, to testify against them in the courts above. A\nrecord goes up to heaven, and a day is coming when judgment will\nbe pronounced against those who abuse God\u2019s creatures.\nWhen he beheld the messenger of God, Balaam exclaimed in\nterror, \u201cI have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way\nagainst me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back\nagain.\u201d The Lord suffered him to proceed on his journey, but gave\nhim to understand that his words should be controlled by divine\npower. God would give evidence to Moab that the Hebrews were\nunder the guardianship of Heaven, and this He did effectually when\nHe showed them how powerless Balaam was even to utter a curse\nagainst them without divine permission.\nThe king of Moab, being informed of the approach of Balaam,\nwent out with a large retinue to the borders of his kingdom, to receive\nhim. When he expressed his astonishment at Balaam\u2019s delay, in view\nof the rich rewards awaiting him, the prophet\u2019s answer was, \u201cLo, I\nam come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say anything?\nthe word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.\u201d Balaam\ngreatly regretted this restriction; he feared that his purpose could not\nbe carried out, because the Lord\u2019s controlling power was upon him.\n402 Patriarchs and Prophets\nWith great pomp the king, with the chief dignitaries of his\nkingdom, escorted Balaam to \u201cthe high places of Baal,\u201d from which[444]\nhe could survey the Hebrew host. Behold the prophet as he stands\nupon the lofty height, looking down over the encampment of God\u2019s\nchosen people. How little do the Israelites know of what is taking\nplace so near them! How little do they know of the care of God, ex-\ntended over them by day and by night! How dull are the perceptions\nof God\u2019s people! How slow are they, in every age, to comprehend\nHis great love and mercy! If they could discern the wonderful power\nof God constantly exerted in their behalf, would not their hearts be\nfilled with gratitude for His love, and with awe at the thought of His\nmajesty and power?\nBalaam had some knowledge of the sacrificial offerings of the\nHebrews, and he hoped that by surpassing them in costly gifts he\nmight secure the blessing of God and ensure the accomplishment of\nhis sinful projects. Thus the sentiments of the idolatrous Moabites\nwere gaining control of his mind. His wisdom had become foolish-\nness; his spiritual vision was beclouded; he had brought blindness\nupon himself by yielding to the power of Satan.\nBy Balaam\u2019s direction seven altars were erected, and he offered\na sacrifice upon each. He then withdrew to a \u201chigh place,\u201d to meet\nwith God, promising to make known to Balak whatever the Lord\nshould reveal.\nWith the nobles and princes of Moab the king stood beside the\nsacrifice, while around them gathered the eager multitude, watching\nfor the return of the prophet. He came at last, and the people waited\nfor the words that should paralyze forever that strange power exerted\nin behalf of the hated Israelites. Balaam said:\n\u201cThe king of Moab hath brought me from Aram,\nOut of the mountains of the east,\nSaying, Come, curse me Jacob,\nAnd come, defy Israel.\nHow shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?\nOr how shall I defy, whom the Lord hath not defied?\nFor from the top of the rocks I see him ,\nAnd from the hills I behold him :\nLo, the people shall dwell alone,\nBalaam 403\nAnd shall not be reckoned among the nations.\nWho can count the dust of Jacob,\nAnd the number of the fourth part of Israel?\nLet me die the death of the righteous,\nAnd let my last end be like his!\u201d\nBalaam confessed that he came with the purpose of cursing Is- [445]\n[446]\n[447]\nrael, but the words he uttered were directly contrary to the sentiments\nof his heart. He was constrained to pronounce blessings, while his\nsoul was filled with curses.\nAs Balaam looked upon the encampment of Israel he beheld\nwith astonishment the evidence of their prosperity. They had been\nrepresented to him as a rude, disorganized multitude, infesting the\ncountry in roving bands that were a pest and terror to the surrounding\nnations; but their appearance was the reverse of all this. He saw the\nvast extent and perfect arrangement of their camp, everything bearing\nthe marks of thorough discipline and order. He was shown the favor\nwith which God regarded Israel, and their distinctive character as\nHis chosen people. They were not to stand upon a level with other\nnations, but to be exalted above them all. \u201cThe people shall dwell\nalone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.\u201d At the time\nwhen these words were spoken the Israelites had no permanent\nsettlement, and their peculiar character, their manners and customs,\nwere not familiar to Balaam. But how strikingly was this prophecy\nfulfilled in the afterhistory of Israel! Through all the years of their\ncaptivity, through all the ages since they were dispersed among the\nnations, they have remained a distinct people. So the people of\nGod\u2014the true Israel\u2014though scattered throughout all nations, are\non earth but sojourners, whose citizenship is in heaven.\nNot only was Balaam shown the history of the Hebrew people\nas a nation, but he beheld the increase and prosperity of the true\nIsrael of God to the close of time. He saw the special favor of the\nMost High attending those who love and fear Him . He saw them\nsupported by His arm as they enter the dark valley of the shadow of\ndeath. And he beheld them coming forth from their graves, crowned\nwith glory, honor, and immortality. He saw the redeemed rejoicing\nin the unfading glories of the earth made new. Gazing upon the\nscene, he exclaimed, \u201cWho can count the dust of Jacob, and the\n404 Patriarchs and Prophets\nnumber of the fourth part of Israel?\u201d And as he saw the crown of\nglory on every brow, the joy beaming from every countenance, and\nlooked forward to that endless life of unalloyed happiness, he uttered\nthe solemn prayer, \u201cLet me die the death of the righteous, and let\nmy last end be like his!\u201d\nIf Balaam had had a disposition to accept the light that God[448]\nhad given, he would now have made true his words; he would at\nonce have severed all connection with Moab. He would no longer\nhave presumed upon the mercy of God, but would have returned\nto Him with deep repentance. But Balaam loved the wages of\nunrighteousness, and these he was determined to secure.\nBalak had confidently expected a curse that would fall like a\nwithering blight upon Israel; and at the words of the prophet he\npassionately exclaimed, \u201cWhat hast thou done unto me? I took\nthee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them\naltogether.\u201d Balaam, seeking to make a virtue of necessity, professed\nto have spoken from a conscientious regard for the will of God the\nwords that had been forced from his lips by divine power. His answer\nwas, \u201cMust I not take heed to speak that which the Lord hath put in\nmy mouth?\u201d\nBalak could not even now relinquish his purpose. He decided\nthat the imposing spectacle presented by the vast encampment of the\nHebrews had so intimidated Balaam that he dared not practice his\ndivinations against them. The king determined to take the prophet\nto some point where only a small part of the host might be seen.\nIf Balaam could be induced to curse them in detached parties, the\nwhole camp would soon be devoted to destruction. On the top of an\nelevation called Pisgah another trial was made. Again seven altars\nwere erected, whereon were placed the same offerings as at the first.\nThe king and his princes remained by the sacrifices, while Balaam\nretired to meet with God. Again the prophet was entrusted with a\ndivine message, which he was powerless to alter or withhold.\nWhen he appeared to the anxious, expectant company the ques-\ntion was put to him, \u201cWhat hath the Lord spoken?\u201d The answer, as\nbefore, struck terror to the heart of king and princes:\n\u201cGod is not a man, that He should lie;\nNeither the son of man, that He should repent:\nBalaam 405\nHath He said, and shall He not do it?\nOr hath He spoken, and shall He not make it good?\nBehold, I have received commandment to bless:\nAnd He hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.\nHe hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob,\nNeither hath He seen perverseness in Israel:\nThe Lord his God is with him,\nAnd the shout of a king is among them.\u201d\nAwed by these revelations, Balaam exclaimed, \u201cSurely there is [449]\nno enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against\nIsrael.\u201d The great magician had tried his power of enchantment, in\naccordance with the desire of the Moabites; but concerning this\nvery occasion it should be said of Israel, \u201cWhat hath God wrought!\u201d\nWhile they were under the divine protection, no people or nation,\nthough aided by all the power of Satan, should be able to prevail\nagainst them. All the world should wonder at the marvelous work\nof God in behalf of His people\u2014that a man determined to pursue\na sinful course should be so controlled by divine power as to utter,\ninstead of imprecations, the richest and most precious promises, in\nthe language of sublime and impassioned poetry. And the favor of\nGod at this time manifested toward Israel was to be an assurance\nof His protecting care for His obedient, faithful children in all ages.\nWhen Satan should inspire evil men to misrepresent, harass, and\ndestroy God\u2019s people, this very occurrence would be brought to their\nremembrance, and would strengthen their courage and their faith in\nGod.\nThe king of Moab, disheartened and distressed, exclaimed, \u201cNei-\nther curse them at all, nor bless them at all.\u201d Yet a faint hope still\nlingered in his heart, and he determined to make another trial. He\nnow conducted Balaam to Mount Peor, where was a temple devoted\nto the licentious worship of Baal, their god. Here the same number\nof altars were erected as before, and the same number of sacrifices\nwere offered; but Balaam went not alone, as at other times, to learn\nGod\u2019s will. He made no pretense of sorcery, but standing beside the\naltars, he looked abroad upon the tents of Israel. Again the Spirit of\nGod rested upon him, and the divine message came from his lips:\n406 Patriarchs and Prophets\n\u201cHow goodly are thy tents, O Jacob,\nAnd thy tabernacles, O Israel!\nAs the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river\u2019s\nside,\nAs the trees of lignaloes which the Lord hath planted, and as\ncedar\ntrees beside the waters.\nHe shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall\nbe in\nmany waters,\nAnd his King shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom\nshall be\nexalted....\nHe couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who\nshall\nstir him up?\nBlessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth\nthee.\u201d\nThe prosperity of God\u2019s people is here represented by some of[450]\nthe most beautiful figures to be found in nature. The prophet likens\nIsrael to fertile valleys covered with abundant harvests; to flourishing\ngardens watered by never-failing springs; to the fragrant sandal tree\nand the stately cedar. The figure last mentioned is one of the most\nstrikingly beautiful and appropriate to be found in the inspired word.\nThe cedar of Lebanon was honored by all the people of the East.\nThe class of trees to which it belongs is found wherever man has\ngone throughout the earth. From the arctic regions to the tropic zone\nthey flourish, rejoicing in the heat, yet braving the cold; springing in\nrich luxuriance by the riverside, yet towering aloft upon the parched\nand thirsty waste. They plant their roots deep among the rocks of\nthe mountains and boldly stand in defiance of the tempest. Their\nleaves are fresh and green when all else has perished at the breath of\nwinter. Above all other trees the cedar of Lebanon is distinguished\nfor its strength, its firmness, its undecaying vigor; and this is used as\na symbol of those whose life is \u201chid with Christ in God.\u201d Colossians\n3:3. Says the Scripture, \u201cThe righteous ... shall grow like a cedar.\u201d\nPsalm 92:12. The divine hand has exalted the cedar as king over\nBalaam 407\nthe forest. \u201cThe fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut\ntrees were not like his branches\u201d (Ezekiel 31:8); nor any tree in the\ngarden of God. The cedar is repeatedly employed as an emblem of\nroyalty, and its use in Scripture to represent the righteous shows how\nheaven regards those who do the will of God.\nBalaam prophesied that Israel\u2019s King would be greater and more\npowerful than Agag. This was the name given to the kings of the\nAmalekites, who were at this time a very powerful nation; but Israel,\nif true to God, would subdue all her enemies. The King of Israel\nwas the Son of God; and His throne was one day to be established in\nthe earth, and His power to be exalted above all earthly kingdoms.\nAs he listened to the prophet\u2019s words Balak was overwhelmed\nwith disappointed hope, with fear and rage. He was indignant that\nBalaam could have given him the least encouragement of a favorable\nresponse, when everything was determined against him. He regarded\nwith scorn the prophet\u2019s compromising, deceptive course. The king\nexclaimed fiercely, \u201cTherefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought\nto promote thee unto great honor; but, lo, the Lord hath kept thee\nback from honor.\u201d The answer was that the king had been forewarned [451]\nthat Balaam could speak only the message given him from God.\nBefore returning to his people, Balaam uttered a most beautiful\nand sublime prophecy of the world\u2019s Redeemer and the final destruc-\ntion of the enemies of God: \u201cI shall see Him , but not now: I shall\nbehold Him , but not nigh:\nThere shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out\nof\nIsrael,\nAnd shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children\nof\nSheth.\u201d\nAnd he closed by predicting the complete destruction of Moab\nand Edom, of Amalek and the Kenites, thus leaving to the Moabitish\nking no ray of hope.\nDisappointed in his hopes of wealth and promotion, in disfavor\nwith the king, and conscious that he had incurred the displeasure\nof God, Balaam returned from his self-chosen mission. After he\n408 Patriarchs and Prophets\nhad reached his home the controlling power of the Spirit of God left\nhim, and his covetousness, which had been merely held in check,\nprevailed. He was ready to resort to any means to gain the reward\npromised by Balak. Balaam knew that the prosperity of Israel de-\npended upon their obedience to God, and that there was no way to\ncause their overthrow but by seducing them into sin. He now decided\nto secure Balak\u2019s favor by advising the Moabites of the course to be\npursued to bring a curse upon Israel.\nHe immediately returned to the land of Moab and laid his plans\nbefore the king. The Moabites themselves were convinced that so\nlong as Israel remained true to God, He would be their shield. The\nplan proposed by Balaam was to separate them from God by enticing\nthem into idolatry. If they could be led to engage in the licentious\nworship of Baal and Ashtaroth, their omnipotent Protector would\nbecome their enemy, and they would soon fall a prey to the fierce,\nwarlike nations around them. This plan was readily accepted by\nthe king, and Balaam himself remained to assist in carrying it into\neffect.\nBalaam witnessed the success of his diabolical scheme. He saw\nthe curse of God visited upon His people, and thousands falling\nunder His judgments; but the divine justice that punished sin in\nIsrael did not permit the tempters to escape. In the war of Israel\nagainst the Midianites, Balaam was slain. He had felt a presentiment\nthat his own end was near when he exclaimed, \u201cLet me die the death[452]\nof the righteous, and let my last end be like his!\u201d But he had not\nchosen to live the life of the righteous, and his destiny was fixed\nwith the enemies of God.\nThe fate of Balaam was similar to that of Judas, and their char-\nacters bear a marked resemblance to each other. Both these men\ntried to unite the service of God and mammon, and met with signal\nfailure. Balaam acknowledged the true God, and professed to serve\nHim ; Judas believed in Jesus as the Messiah, and united with His\nfollowers. But Balaam hoped to make the service of Jehovah the\nsteppingstone to the acquirement of riches and worldly honor; and\nfailing in this he stumbled and fell and was broken. Judas expected\nby his connection with Christ to secure wealth and promotion in\nthat worldly kingdom which, as he believed, the Messiah was about\nto set up. The failure of his hopes drove him to apostasy and ruin.\nBalaam 409\nBoth Balaam and Judas had received great light and enjoyed special\nprivileges, but a single cherished sin poisoned the entire character\nand caused their destruction.\nIt is a perilous thing to allow an unchristian trait to live in the\nheart. One cherished sin will, little by little, debase the character,\nbringing all its nobler powers into subjection to the evil desire. The\nremoval of one safeguard from the conscience, the indulgence of\none evil habit, one neglect of the high claims of duty, breaks down\nthe defenses of the soul and opens the way for Satan to come in and\nlead us astray. The only safe course is to let our prayers go forth\ndaily from a sincere heart, as did David, \u201cHold up my goings in Thy\npaths, that my footsteps slip not.\u201d Psalm 17:5.\nChapter 41\u2014Apostasy at the Jordan[453]\nThis chapter is based on Numbers 25.\nWith joyful hearts and renewed faith in God, the victorious\narmies of Israel had returned from Bashan. They had already gained\npossession of a valuable territory, and they were confident of the\nimmediate conquest of Canaan. Only the river Jordan lay between\nthem and the Promised Land. Just across the river was a rich plain,\ncovered with verdure, watered with streams from copious fountains,\nand shaded by luxuriant palm trees. On the western border of the\nplain rose the towers and palaces of Jericho, so embosomed in its\npalm-tree groves that it was called \u201cthe city of palm trees.\u201d\nOn the eastern side of Jordan, between the river and the high\ntableland which they had been traversing, was also a plain, several\nmiles in width and extending some distance along the river. This\nsheltered valley had the climate of the tropics; here flourished the\nshittim, or acacia, tree, giving to the plain the name, \u201cVale of Shit-\ntim.\u201d It was here that the Israelites encamped, and in the acacia\ngroves by the riverside they found an agreeable retreat.\nBut amid these attractive surroundings they were to encounter\nan evil more deadly than mighty hosts of armed men or the wild\nbeasts of the wilderness. That country, so rich in natural advantages,\nhad been defiled by the inhabitants. In the public worship of Baal,\nthe leading deity, the most degrading and iniquitous scenes were\nconstantly enacted. On every side were places noted for idolatry and\nlicentiousness, the very names being suggestive of the vileness and\ncorruption of the people.\nThese surroundings exerted a polluting influence upon the Is-\nraelites. Their minds became familiar with the vile thoughts con-\nstantly suggested; their life of ease and inaction produced its demor-\nalizing effect; and almost unconsciously to themselves they were[454]\ndeparting from God and coming into a condition where they would\nfall an easy prey to temptation.\n410\nApostasy at the Jordan 411\nDuring the time of their encampment beside Jordan, Moses was\npreparing for the occupation of Canaan. In this work the great leader\nwas fully employed; but to the people this time of suspense and\nexpectation was most trying, and before many weeks had elapsed\ntheir history was marred by the most frightful departures from virtue\nand integrity.\nAt first there was little intercourse between the Israelites and their\nheathen neighbors, but after a time Midianitish women began to steal\ninto the camp. Their appearance excited no alarm, and so quietly\nwere their plans conducted that the attention of Moses was not called\nto the matter. It was the object of these women, in their association\nwith the Hebrews, to seduce them into transgression of the law of\nGod, to draw their attention to heathen rites and customs, and lead\nthem into idolatry. These motives were studiously concealed under\nthe garb of friendship, so that they were not suspected, even by the\nguardians of the people.\nAt Balaam\u2019s suggestion, a grand festival in honor of their gods\nwas appointed by the king of Moab, and it was secretly arranged\nthat Balaam should induce the Israelites to attend. He was regarded\nby them as a prophet of God, and hence had little difficulty in\naccomplishing his purpose. Great numbers of the people joined\nhim in witnessing the festivities. They ventured upon the forbidden\nground, and were entangled in the snare of Satan. Beguiled with\nmusic and dancing, and allured by the beauty of heathen vestals,\nthey cast off their fealty to Jehovah. As they united in mirth and\nfeasting, indulgence in wine beclouded their senses and broke down\nthe barriers of self-control. Passion had full sway; and having defiled\ntheir consciences by lewdness, they were persuaded to bow down to\nidols. They offered sacrifice upon heathen altars and participated in\nthe most degrading rites.\nIt was not long before the poison had spread, like a deadly\ninfection, through the camp of Israel. Those who would have con-\nquered their enemies in battle were overcome by the wiles of heathen\nwomen. The people seemed to be infatuated. The rulers and the\nleading men were among the first to transgress, and so many of the\npeople were guilty that the apostasy became national. \u201cIsrael joined\nhimself unto Baalpeor.\u201d When Moses was aroused to perceive the [455]\nevil, the plots of their enemies had been so successful that not only\n412 Patriarchs and Prophets\nwere the Israelites participating in the licentious worship at Mount\nPeor, but the heathen rites were coming to be observed in the camp\nof Israel. The aged leader was filled with indignation, and the wrath\nof God was kindled.\nTheir iniquitous practices did that for Israel which all the en-\nchantments of Balaam could not do\u2014they separated them from\nGod. By swift-coming judgments the people were awakened to the\nenormity of their sin. A terrible pestilence broke out in the camp,\nto which tens of thousands speedily fell a prey. God commanded\nthat the leaders in this apostasy be put to death by the magistrates.\nThis order was promptly obeyed. The offenders were slain, then\ntheir bodies were hung up in sight of all Israel that the congregation,\nseeing the leaders so severely dealt with, might have a deep sense\nof God\u2019s abhorrence of their sin and the terror of His wrath against\nthem.\nAll felt that the punishment was just, and the people hastened to\nthe tabernacle, and with tears and deep humiliation confessed their\nsin. While they were thus weeping before God, at the door of the\ntabernacle, while the plague was still doing its work of death, and\nthe magistrates were executing their terrible commission, Zimri, one\nof the nobles of Israel, came boldly into the camp, accompanied by\na Midianitish harlot, a princess \u201cof a chief house in Midian,\u201d whom\nhe escorted to his tent. Never was vice bolder or more stubborn.\nInflamed with wine, Zimri declared his \u201csin as Sodom,\u201d and gloried\nin his shame. The priests and leaders had prostrated themselves in\ngrief and humiliation, weeping \u201cbetween the porch and the altar,\u201d\nand entreating the Lord to spare His people, and give not His heritage\nto reproach, when this prince in Israel flaunted his sin in the sight of\nthe congregation, as if to defy the vengeance of God and mock the\njudges of the nation. Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the high priest,\nrose up from among the congregation, and seizing a javelin, \u201che\nwent after the man of Israel into the tent,\u201d and slew them both. Thus\nthe plague was stayed, while the priest who had executed the divine\njudgment was honored before all Israel, and the priesthood was\nconfirmed to him and to his house forever.\nPhinehas \u201chath turned My wrath away from the children of\nIsrael,\u201d was the divine message; \u201cwherefore say, Behold, I give unto\nhim My covenant of peace: and he shall have it, and his seed after[456]\nApostasy at the Jordan 413\nhim, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he\nwas zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of\nIsrael.\u201d\nThe judgments visited upon Israel for their sin at Shittim, de-\nstroyed the survivors of that vast company, who, nearly forty years\nbefore, had incurred the sentence, \u201cThey shall surely die in the\nwilderness.\u201d The numbering of the people by divine direction, dur-\ning their encampment on the plains of Jordan, showed that \u201cof them\nwhom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered\nthe children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai, ... there was not left\na man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son\nof Nun.\u201d Numbers 26:64, 65.\nGod had sent judgments upon Israel for yielding to the entice-\nments of the Midianites; but the tempters were not to escape the\nwrath of divine justice. The Amalekites, who had attacked Israel\nat Rephidim, falling upon those who were faint and weary behind\nthe host, were not punished till long after; but the Midianites who\nseduced them into sin were speedily made to feel God\u2019s judgments,\nas being the more dangerous enemies. \u201cAvenge the children of Israel\nof the Midianites\u201d (Numbers 31:2), was the command of God to\nMoses; \u201cafterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.\u201d This\nmandate was immediately obeyed. One thousand men were chosen\nfrom each of the tribes and sent out under the leadership of Phinehas.\n\u201cAnd they warred against the Midianites, as the Lord commanded\nMoses.... And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them\nthat were slain; ... five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor\nthey slew with the sword.\u201d Verses 7, 8. The women also, who had\nbeen made captives by the attacking army, were put to death at the\ncommand of Moses, as the most guilty and most dangerous of the\nfoes of Israel.\nSuch was the end of them that devised mischief against God\u2019s\npeople. Says the psalmist: \u201cThe heathen are sunk down in the pit\nthat they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.\u201d\nPsalm 9:15. \u201cFor the Lord will not cast off His people, neither\nwill He forsake His inheritance. But judgment shall return unto\nrighteousness.\u201d When men \u201cgather themselves together against the\nsoul of the righteous,\u201d the Lord \u201cshall bring upon them their own\n414 Patriarchs and Prophets\niniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness.\u201d Psalm\n94:14, 15, 21, 23.\nWhen Balaam was called to curse the Hebrews he could not, by[457]\nall his enchantments, bring evil upon them; for the Lord had not \u201cbe-\nheld iniquity in Jacob,\u201d neither had He \u201cseen perverseness in Israel.\u201d\nNumbers 23:21, 23. But when through yielding to temptation they\ntransgressed God\u2019s law, their defense departed from them. When\nthe people of God are faithful to His commandments, \u201cthere is no\nenchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against\nIsrael.\u201d Hence all the power and wily arts of Satan are exerted to\nseduce them into sin. If those who profess to be the depositaries\nof God\u2019s law become transgressors of its precepts, they separate\nthemselves from God, and they will be unable to stand before their\nenemies.\nThe Israelites, who could not be overcome by the arms or by the\nenchantments of Midian, fell a prey to her harlots. Such is the power\nthat woman, enlisted in the service of Satan, has exerted to entrap\nand destroy souls. \u201cShe hath cast down many wounded: yea, many\nstrong men have been slain by her.\u201d Proverbs 7:26. It was thus that\nthe children of Seth were seduced from their integrity, and the holy\nseed became corrupt. It was thus that Joseph was tempted. Thus\nSamson betrayed his strength, the defense of Israel, into the hands of\nthe Philistines. Here David stumbled. And Solomon, the wisest of\nkings, who had thrice been called the beloved of his God, became a\nslave of passion, and sacrificed his integrity to the same bewitching\npower.\n\u201cNow all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and\nthey are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the\nworld are come. Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take\nheed lest he fall.\u201d 1 Corinthians 10:11, 12. Satan well knows the\nmaterial with which he has to deal in the human heart. He knows\u2014\nfor he has studied with fiendish intensity for thousands of years\u2014the\npoints most easily assailed in every character; and through successive\ngenerations he has wrought to overthrow the strongest men, princes\nin Israel, by the same temptations that were so successful at Baalpeor.\nAll along through the ages there are strewn wrecks of character that\nhave been stranded upon the rocks of sensual indulgence. As we\napproach the close of time, as the people of God stand upon the\nApostasy at the Jordan 415\nborders of the heavenly Canaan, Satan will, as of old, redouble his\nefforts to prevent them from entering the goodly land. He lays his\nsnares for every soul. It is not the ignorant and uncultured merely [458]\nthat need to be guarded; he will prepare his temptations for those in\nthe highest positions, in the most holy office; if he can lead them\nto pollute their souls, he can through them destroy many. And he\nemploys the same agents now as he employed three thousand years\nago. By worldly friendships, by the charms of beauty, by pleasure\nseeking, mirth, feasting, or the wine cup, he tempts to the violation\nof the seventh commandment.\nSatan seduced Israel into licentiousness before leading them to\nidolatry. Those who will dishonor God\u2019s image and defile His tem-\nple in their own persons will not scruple at any dishonor to God that\nwill gratify the desire of their depraved hearts. Sensual indulgence\nweakens the mind and debases the soul. The moral and intellectual\npowers are benumbed and paralyzed by the gratification of the an-\nimal propensities; and it is impossible for the slave of passion to\nrealize the sacred obligation of the law of God, to appreciate the\natonement, or to place a right value upon the soul. Goodness, purity,\nand truth, reverence for God, and love for sacred things\u2014all those\nholy affections and noble desires that link men with the heavenly\nworld\u2014are consumed in the fires of lust. The soul becomes a black-\nened and desolate waste, the habitation of the evil spirits, and the\n\u201ccage of every unclean and hateful bird.\u201d Beings formed in the image\nof God are dragged down to a level with the brutes.\nIt was by associating with idolaters and joining in their festivities\nthat the Hebrews were led to transgress God\u2019s law and bring His\njudgments upon the nation. So now it is by leading the followers of\nChrist to associate with the ungodly and unite in their amusements\nthat Satan is most successful in alluring them into sin. \u201cCome out\nfrom among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch\nnot the unclean.\u201d 2 Corinthians 6:17. God requires of His people\nnow as great a distinction from the world, in customs, habits, and\nprinciples, as He required of Israel anciently. If they faithfully follow\nthe teachings of His word, this distinction will exist; it cannot be\notherwise. The warnings given to the Hebrews against assimilating\nwith the heathen were not more direct or explicit than are those\nforbidding Christians to conform to the spirit and customs of the\n416 Patriarchs and Prophets\nungodly. Christ speaks to us, \u201cLove not the world, neither the things\nthat are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the\nFather is not in him.\u201d 1 John 2:15. \u201cThe friendship of the world is[459]\nenmity with God; whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world\nis the enemy of God.\u201d James 4:4. The followers of Christ are to\nseparate themselves from sinners, choosing their society only when\nthere is opportunity to do them good. We cannot be too decided in\nshunning the company of those who exert an influence to draw us\naway from God. While we pray, \u201cLead us not into temptation,\u201d we\nare to shun temptation, so far as possible.\nIt was when the Israelites were in a condition of outward ease\nand security that they were led into sin. They failed to keep God\never before them, they neglected prayer and cherished a spirit of\nself-confidence. Ease and self-indulgence left the citadel of the soul\nunguarded, and debasing thoughts found entrance. It was the traitors\nwithin the walls that overthrew the strongholds of principle and\nbetrayed Israel into the power of Satan. It is thus that Satan still\nseeks to compass the ruin of the soul. A long preparatory process,\nunknown to the world, goes on in the heart before the Christian\ncommits open sin. The mind does not come down at once from\npurity and holiness to depravity, corruption, and crime. It takes time\nto degrade those formed in the image of God to the brutal or the\nsatanic. By beholding we become changed. By the indulgence of\nimpure thoughts man can so educate his mind that sin which he once\nloathed will become pleasant to him.\nSatan is using every means to make crime and debasing vice\npopular. We cannot walk the streets of our cities without encounter-\ning flaring notices of crime presented in some novel, or to be acted\nat some theater. The mind is educated to familiarity with sin. The\ncourse pursued by the base and vile is kept before the people in\nthe periodicals of the day, and everything that can excite passion is\nbrought before them in exciting stories. They hear and read so much\nof debasing crime that the once tender conscience, which would\nhave recoiled with horror from such scenes, becomes hardened, and\nthey dwell upon these things with greedy interest.\nMany of the amusements popular in the world today, even with\nthose who claim to be Christians, tend to the same end as did those\nof the heathen. There are indeed few among them that Satan does\nApostasy at the Jordan 417\nnot turn to account in destroying souls. Through the drama he has\nworked for ages to excite passion and glorify vice. The opera, with\nits fascinating display and bewildering music, the masquerade, the [460]\ndance, the card table, Satan employs to break down the barriers of\nprinciple and open the door to sensual indulgence. In every gathering\nfor pleasure where pride is fostered or appetite indulged, where one\nis led to forget God and lose sight of eternal interests, there Satan is\nbinding his chains about the soul.\n\u201cKeep thy heart with all diligence,\u201d is the counsel of the wise\nman; \u201cfor out of it are the issues of life.\u201d Proverbs 4:23. As man\n\u201cthinketh in his heart, so is he.\u201d Proverbs 23:7. The heart must be\nrenewed by divine grace, or it will be in vain to seek for purity of life.\nHe who attempts to build up a noble, virtuous character independent\nof the grace of Christ is building his house upon the shifting sand. In\nthe fierce storms of temptation it will surely be overthrown. David\u2019s\nprayer should be the petition of every soul: \u201cCreate in me a clean\nheart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.\u201d Psalm 51:10. And\nhaving become partakers of the heavenly gift, we are to go on unto\nperfection, being \u201ckept by the power of God through faith.\u201d 1 Peter\n1:5.\nYet we have a work to do to resist temptation. Those who would\nnot fall a prey to Satan\u2019s devices must guard well the avenues of\nthe soul; they must avoid reading, seeing, or hearing that which will\nsuggest impure thoughts. The mind should not be left to wander at\nrandom upon every subject that the adversary of souls may suggest.\n\u201cGirding up the loins of your mind,\u201d says the apostle Peter, \u201cBe\nsober, ... not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts\nin ... your ignorance: but like as He which called you is holy, be\nye yourselves also holy in all manner of living.\u201d 1 Peter 1:13-15,\nR.V . Says Paul, \u201cWhatsoever things are true, whatsoever things\nare honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,\nwhatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if\nthere be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.\u201d\nPhilippians 4:8. This will require earnest prayer and unceasing\nwatchfulness. We must be aided by the abiding influence of the Holy\nSpirit, which will attract the mind upward, and habituate it to dwell\non pure and holy things. And we must give diligent study to the\nword of God. \u201cWherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?\n418 Patriarchs and Prophets\nby taking heed thereto according to Thy word.\u201d \u201cThy word,\u201d says\nthe psalmist, \u201chave I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against\nThee.\u201d Psalm 119:9, 11.\nIsrael\u2019s sin at Beth-peor brought the judgments of God upon[461]\nthe nation, and though the same sins may not now be punished as\nspeedily, they will as surely meet retribution. \u201cIf any man defile\nthe temple of God, him shall God destroy.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:17. Na-\nture has affixed terrible penalties to these crimes\u2014penalties which,\nsooner or later, will be inflicted upon every transgressor. It is these\nsins more than any other that have caused the fearful degeneracy\nof our race, and the weight of disease and misery with which the\nworld is cursed. Men may succeed in concealing their transgression\nfrom their fellow men, but they will no less surely reap the result, in\nsuffering, disease, imbecility, or death. And beyond this life stands\nthe tribunal of the judgment, with its award of eternal penalties.\n\u201cThey which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God,\u201d\nbut with Satan and evil angels shall have their part in that \u201clake of\nfire\u201d which \u201cis the second death.\u201d Galatians 5:21; Revelation 20:14.\n\u201cThe lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her\nmouth is smoother than oil: but her end is bitter as wormwood,\nsharp as a two-edged sword.\u201d Proverbs 5:3, 4. \u201cRemove thy way\nfar from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: lest thou\ngive thine honor unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: lest\nstrangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labors be in the house\nof a stranger; and thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy\nbody are consumed.\u201d Verses 8-11. \u201cHer house inclineth unto death.\u201d\n\u201cNone that go unto her return again.\u201d Proverbs 2:18, 19. \u201cHer guests\nare in the depths of hell.\u201d Proverbs 9:18.\nChapter 42\u2014The Law Repeated [462]\nThis chapter is based on Deuteronomy 4 to 6; 28.\nThe Lord announced to Moses that the appointed time for the\npossession of Canaan was at hand; and as the aged prophet stood\nupon the heights overlooking the river Jordan and the Promised\nLand, he gazed with deep interest upon the inheritance of his people.\nWould it be possible that the sentence pronounced against him for his\nsin at Kadesh might be revoked? With deep earnestness he pleaded,\n\u201cO Lord God, Thou hast begun to show Thy servant Thy greatness,\nand Thy mighty hand; for what god is there in heaven or in earth,\nthat can do according to Thy works, and according to Thy might?\nI pray Thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond\nJordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.\u201d Deuteronomy 3:24-27.\nThe answer was, \u201cLet it suffice thee; speak no more unto Me of\nthis matter. Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes\nwestward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold\nit with thine eyes; for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.\u201d\nWithout a murmur Moses submitted to the decree of God. And\nnow his great anxiety was for Israel. Who would feel the interest for\ntheir welfare that he had felt? From a full heart he poured forth the\nprayer, \u201cLet the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man\nover the congregation, which may go out before them, and which\nmay go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which\nmay bring them in; that the congregation of the Lord be not as sheep\nwhich have no shepherd.\u201d Numbers 27:16, 17.\nThe Lord hearkened to the prayer of His servant; and the answer\ncame, \u201cTake thee Joshua, the son of Nun, a man in whom is the\nSpirit, and lay thine hand upon him; and set him before Eleazar the\npriest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in\ntheir sight. And thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him, that\nall the congregation of the people of Israel may be obedient.\u201d Verses\n18-20. Joshua had long attended Moses; and being a man of wisdom, [463]\n419\n420 Patriarchs and Prophets\nability, and faith, he was chosen to succeed him.\nThrough the laying on of hands by Moses, accompanied by a\nmost impressive charge, Joshua was solemnly set apart as the leader\nof Israel. He was also admitted to a present share in the government.\nThe words of the Lord concerning Joshua came through Moses to\nthe congregation, \u201cHe shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall\nask counsel for him, after the judgment of Urim before the Lord. At\nhis word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both\nhe, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.\u201d\nVerses 21-23.\nBefore relinquishing his position as the visible leader of Israel,\nMoses was directed to rehearse to them the history of their deliver-\nance from Egypt and their journeyings in the wilderness, and also\nto recapitulate the law spoken from Sinai. When the law was given,\nbut few of the present congregation were old enough to comprehend\nthe awful solemnity of the occasion. As they were soon to pass\nover Jordan and take possession of the Promised Land, God would\npresent before them the claims of His law and enjoin upon them\nobedience as the condition of prosperity.\nMoses stood before the people to repeat his last warnings and\nadmonitions. His face was illumined with a holy light. His hair was\nwhite with age; but his form was erect, his countenance expressed\nthe unabated vigor of health, and his eye was clear and undimmed.\nIt was an important occasion, and with deep feeling he portrayed the\nlove and mercy of their Almighty Protector:\n\u201cAsk now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since\nthe day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one\nside of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing\nas this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? Did ever people hear\nthe voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast\nheard, and live? or hath God assayed to go and take Him a nation\nfrom the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by\nwonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched-out\narm, and by great terrors, according to all that the Lord your God\ndid for you in Egypt before your eyes? Unto thee it was showed,\nthat thou mightest know that the Lord He is God; there is none else\nbeside Him.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lord did not set His love upon you, nor choose you, because[464]\nLaw Repeated 421\nye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of\nall people: but because the Lord loved you, and because He would\nkeep the oath which He had sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord\nbrought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the\nhouse of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Know\ntherefore that Jehovah thy God, He is God, the faithful God, which\nkeepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His\ncommandments to a thousand generations.\u201d Deuteronomy 7:7-9.\nThe people of Israel had been ready to ascribe their troubles to\nMoses; but now their suspicions that he was controlled by pride,\nambition, or selfishness, were removed, and they listened with confi-\ndence to his words. Moses faithfully set before them their errors and\nthe transgressions of their fathers. They had often felt impatient and\nrebellious because of their long wandering in the wilderness; but the\nLord had not been chargeable with this delay in possessing Canaan;\nHe was more grieved than they because He could not bring them\ninto immediate possession of the Promised Land, and thus display\nbefore all nations His mighty power in the deliverance of His people.\nWith their distrust of God, with their pride and unbelief, they had not\nbeen prepared to enter Canaan. They would in no way represent that\npeople whose God is the Lord; for they did not bear His character\nof purity, goodness, and benevolence. Had their fathers yielded in\nfaith to the direction of God, being governed by His judgments and\nwalking in His ordinances, they would long before have been settled\nin Canaan, a prosperous, holy, happy people. Their delay to enter\nthe goodly land dishonored God and detracted from His glory in the\nsight of surrounding nations.\nMoses, who understood the character and value of the law of\nGod, assured the people that no other nation had such wise, righteous,\nand merciful rules as had been given to the Hebrews. \u201cBehold,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cI have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord\nmy God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither\nye go to possess it. Keep therefore and do them; for this is your\nwisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which\nshall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a\nwise and understanding people.\u201d\nMoses called their attention to the \u201cday that thou stoodest before [465]\nthe Lord thy God in Horeb.\u201d And he challenged the Hebrew host:\n422 Patriarchs and Prophets\n\u201cWhat nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as\nthe Lord our God is in all things that we call upon Him for? And\nwhat nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so\nrighteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?\u201d Today the\nchallenge to Israel might be repeated. The laws which God gave His\nancient people were wiser, better, and more humane than those of\nthe most civilized nations of the earth. The laws of the nations bear\nmarks of the infirmities and passions of the unrenewed heart; but\nGod\u2019s law bears the stamp of the divine.\n\u201cThe Lord hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron\nfurnace,\u201d declared Moses, \u201cto be unto Him a people of inheritance.\u201d\nThe land which they were soon to enter, and which was to be theirs\non condition of obedience to the law of God, was thus described to\nthem\u2014and how must these words have moved the hearts of Israel,\nas they remembered that he who so glowingly pictured the blessings\nof the goodly land had been, through their sin, shut out from sharing\nthe inheritance of his people:\n\u201cThe Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land,\u201d \u201cnot as the\nland of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy\nseed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: but the\nland, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and\ndrinketh water of the rain of heaven;\u201d \u201ca land of brooks of water,\nof fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; a land\nof wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates;\na land of oil olive, and honey; a land wherein thou shalt eat bread\nwithout scarceness, thou shalt not lack anything in it; a land whose\nstones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass;\u201d \u201ca\nland which the Lord thy God careth for: the eyes of the Lord thy\nGod are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto\nthe end of the year.\u201d Deuteronomy 8:7-9; 11:10-12.\n\u201cAnd it shall be, when the Lord thy God shall have brought\nthee into the land which He sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham,\nto Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which\nthou buildedst not, and houses full of all good things, which thou\nfilledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards\nand olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten[466]\nand be full; then beware lest thou forget the Lord.\u201d \u201cTake heed unto\nyourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God.... For\nLaw Repeated 423\nthe Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.\u201d If they\nshould do evil in the sight of the Lord, then, said Moses, \u201cYe shall\nsoon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to\npossess it.\u201d\nAfter the public rehearsal of the law, Moses completed the work\nof writing all the laws, the statutes, and the judgments which God\nhad given him, and all the regulations concerning the sacrificial\nsystem. The book containing these was placed in charge of the\nproper officers, and was for safe keeping deposited in the side of\nthe ark. Still the great leader was filled with fear that the people\nwould depart from God. In a most sublime and thrilling address he\nset before them the blessings that would be theirs on condition of\nobedience, and the curses that would follow upon transgression:\n\u201cIf thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy\nGod, to observe and to do all His commandments which I command\nthee this day,\u201d \u201cblessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt\nthou be in the field,\u201d in \u201cthe fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy\nground, and the fruit of thy cattle.... Blessed shall be thy basket and\nthy store. Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed\nshalt thou be when thou goest out. The Lord shall cause thine\nenemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face.... The\nLord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, and\nin all that thou settest thine hand unto.\u201d\n\u201cBut it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice\nof the Lord thy God, to observe to do all His commandments and\nHis statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses\nshall come upon thee,\u201d \u201cand thou shalt become an astonishment, a\nproverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the Lord shall\nlead thee.\u201d \u201cAnd the Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from\nthe one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt\nserve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known,\neven wood and stone. And among these nations shalt thou find no\nease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the Lord shall\ngive thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of\nmind: and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt\nfear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: in the [467]\nmorning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou\nshalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart\n424 Patriarchs and Prophets\nwherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou\nshalt see.\u201d\nBy the Spirit of Inspiration, looking far down the ages, Moses\npictured the terrible scenes of Israel\u2019s final overthrow as a nation,\nand the destruction of Jerusalem by the armies of Rome: \u201cThe Lord\nshall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth,\nas swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not\nunderstand; a nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard\nthe person of the old, nor show favor to the young.\u201d\nThe utter wasting of the land and the horrible suffering of the\npeople during the siege of Jerusalem under Titus centuries later,\nwere vividly portrayed: \u201cHe shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the\nfruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed.... And he shall besiege\nthee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down,\nwherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land.... Thou shalt eat the\nfruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters,\nwhich the Lord thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the\nstraitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee.\u201d \u201cThe tender\nand delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set\nthe sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness,\nher eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, ... and toward\nher children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of\nall things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy\nshall distress thee in thy gates.\u201d\nMoses closed with these impressive words: \u201cI call heaven and\nearth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life\nand death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou\nand thy seed may live: that thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and\nthat thou mayest obey His voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto\nHim : for He is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest\ndwell in the land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham,\nto Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.\u201d Deuteronomy 30:19, 20.\nThe more deeply to impress these truths upon all minds, the\ngreat leader embodied them in sacred verse. This song was not only[468]\nhistorical, but prophetic. While it recounted the wonderful dealings\nof God with His people in the past, it also foreshadowed the great\nevents of the future, the final victory of the faithful when Christ\nshall come the second time in power and glory. The people were\nLaw Repeated 425\ndirected to commit to memory this poetic history, and to teach it to\ntheir children and children\u2019s children. It was to be chanted by the\ncongregation when they assembled for worship, and to be repeated\nby the people as they went about their daily labors. It was the duty\nof parents to so impress these words upon the susceptible minds of\ntheir children that they might never be forgotten.\nSince the Israelites were to be, in a special sense, the guardians\nand keepers of God\u2019s law, the significance of its precepts and the\nimportance of obedience were especially to be impressed upon them,\nand through them, upon their children and children\u2019s children. The\nLord commanded concerning His statutes: \u201cThou shalt teach them\ndiligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest\nin thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou\nliest down, and when thou risest up.... And thou shalt write them\nupon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.\u201d\nWhen their children should ask in time to come, \u201cWhat mean\nthe testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the Lord\nour God hath commanded you?\u201d then the parents were to repeat the\nhistory of God\u2019s gracious dealings with them\u2014how the Lord had\nwrought for their deliverance that they might obey His Law\u2014and to\ndeclare to them, \u201cThe Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to\nfear the Lord our God, for our good always, that He might preserve\nus alive, as it is at this day. And it shall be our righteousness, if we\nobserve to do all these commandments before the Lord our God as\nHe hath commanded us.\u201d\nChapter 43\u2014The Death of Moses[469]\nThis chapter is based on Deuteronomy 31 to 34.\nIn all the dealings of God with His people there is, mingled with\nHis love and mercy, the most striking evidence of His strict and\nimpartial justice. This is exemplified in the history of the Hebrew\npeople. God had bestowed great blessings upon Israel. His loving-\nkindness toward them is touchingly portrayed: \u201cAs an eagle stirreth\nup her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings,\ntaketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the Lord alone did lead\nhim.\u201d And yet what swift and severe retribution was visited upon\nthem for their transgressions!\nThe infinite love of God has been manifested in the gift of His\nonly-begotten Son to redeem a lost race. Christ came to the earth to\nreveal to men the character of His Father, and His life was filled with\ndeeds of divine tenderness and compassion. And yet Christ Himself\ndeclares, \u201cTill heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no\nwise pass from the law.\u201d Matthew 5:18. The same voice that with\npatient, loving entreaty invites the sinner to come to Him and find\npardon and peace, will in the judgment bid the rejecters of His mercy,\n\u201cDepart from Me, ye cursed.\u201d Matthew 25:41. In all the Bible, God\nis represented not only as a tender father but as a righteous judge.\nThough He delights in showing mercy, and \u201cforgiving iniquity and\ntransgression and sin,\u201d yet He \u201cwill by no means clear the guilty.\u201d\nExodus 34:7.\nThe great Ruler of nations had declared that Moses was not\nto lead the congregation of Israel into the goodly land, and the\nearnest pleading of God\u2019s servant could not secure a reversing of His\nsentence. He knew that he must die. Yet he had not for a moment\nfaltered in his care for Israel. He had faithfully sought to prepare the\ncongregation to enter upon the promised inheritance. At the divine\ncommand Moses and Joshua repaired to the tabernacle, while the[470]\npillar of cloud came and stood over the door. Here the people were\n426\nDeath of Moses 427\nsolemnly committed to the charge of Joshua. The work of Moses\nas leader of Israel was ended. Still he forgot himself in his interest\nfor his people. In the presence of the assembled multitude Moses,\nin the name of God, addressed to his successor these words of holy\ncheer: \u201cBe strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the\nchildren of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will\nbe with thee.\u201d He then turned to the elders and officers of the people,\ngiving them a solemn charge to obey faithfully the instructions he\nhad communicated to them from God.\nAs the people gazed upon the aged man, so soon to be taken\nfrom them, they recalled, with a new and deeper appreciation, his\nparental tenderness, his wise counsels, and his untiring labors. How\noften, when their sins had invited the just judgments of God, the\nprayers of Moses had prevailed with Him to spare them! Their grief\nwas heightened by remorse. They bitterly remembered that their\nown perversity had provoked Moses to the sin for which he must\ndie.\nThe removal of their beloved leader would be a far stronger\nrebuke to Israel than any which they could have received had his\nlife and mission been continued. God would lead them to feel that\nthey were not to make the life of their future leader as trying as they\nhad made that of Moses. God speaks to His people in blessings\nbestowed; and when these are not appreciated, He speaks to them in\nblessings removed, that they may be led to see their sins, and return\nto Him with all the heart.\nThat very day there came to Moses the command, \u201cGet thee\nup ... unto Mount Nebo, ... and behold the land of Canaan, which\nI give unto the children of Israel for a possession: and die in the\nmount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people.\u201d\nMoses had often left the camp, in obedience to the divine summons,\nto commune with God; but he was now to depart on a new and\nmysterious errand. He must go forth to resign his life into the hands\nof his Creator. Moses knew that he was to die alone; no earthly friend\nwould be permitted to minister to him in his last hours. There was a\nmystery and awfulness about the scene before him, from which his\nheart shrank. The severest trial was his separation from the people\nof his care and love\u2014the people with whom his interest and his life\nhad so long been united. But he had learned to trust in God, and [471]\n428 Patriarchs and Prophets\nwith unquestioning faith he committed himself and his people to His\nlove and mercy.\nFor the last time Moses stood in the assembly of his people.\nAgain the Spirit of God rested upon him, and in the most sublime\nand touching language he pronounced a blessing upon each of the\ntribes, closing with a benediction upon them all:\n\u201cThere is none like unto God, O Jeshurun,\nWho rideth upon the heaven for thy help,\nAnd in His excellency on the skies.\nThe eternal God is thy dwelling place,\nAnd underneath are the everlasting arms:\nAnd He thrust out the enemy from before thee,\nAnd said, Destroy.\nAnd Israel dwelleth in safety,\nThe fountain of Jacob alone,\nIn a land of corn and wine;\nYea, His heavens drop down dew.\nHappy art thou, O Israel:\nWho is like unto thee, a people saved by Jehovah,\nThe shield of thy help.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 33:26-29,",

      "text": "Moses turned from the congregation, and in silence and alone\nmade his way up the mountainside. He went to \u201cthe mountain of\nNebo, to the top of Pisgah.\u201d Upon that lonely height he stood, and\ngazed with undimmed eye upon the scene spread out before him.\nFar away to the west lay the blue waters of the Great Sea; in the\nnorth, Mount Hermon stood out against the sky; to the east was the\ntableland of Moab, and beyond lay Bashan, the scene of Israel\u2019s\ntriumph; and away to the south stretched the desert of their long\nwanderings.\nIn solitude Moses reviewed his life of vicissitudes and hardships\nsince he turned from courtly honors and from a prospective kingdom\nin Egypt, to cast in his lot with God\u2019s chosen people. He called to\nmind those long years in the desert with the flocks of Jethro, the\nappearance of the Angel in the burning bush, and his own call to\nDeath of Moses 429\ndeliver Israel. Again he beheld the mighty miracles of God\u2019s power\ndisplayed in behalf of the chosen people, and His long-suffering\nmercy during the years of their wandering and rebellion. Notwith-\nstanding all that God had wrought for them, notwithstanding his [472]\nown prayers and labors, only two of all the adults in the vast army\nthat left Egypt had been found so faithful that they could enter the\nPromised Land. As Moses reviewed the result of his labors, his life\nof trial and sacrifice seemed to have been almost in vain.\nYet he did not regret the burdens he had borne. He knew that\nhis mission and work were of God\u2019s own appointing. When first\ncalled to become the leader of Israel from bondage, he shrank from\nthe responsibility; but since he had taken up the work he had not\ncast aside the burden. Even when the Lord had proposed to release\nhim, and destroy rebellious Israel, Moses could not consent. Though\nhis trials had been great, he had enjoyed special tokens of God\u2019s\nfavor; he had obtained a rich experience during the sojourn in the\nwilderness, in witnessing the manifestations of God\u2019s power and\nglory, and in the communion of His love; he felt that he had made a\nwise decision in choosing to suffer affliction with the people of God,\nrather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.\nAs he looked back upon his experience as a leader of God\u2019s\npeople, one wrong act marred the record. If that transgression could\nbe blotted out, he felt that he would not shrink from death. He was\nassured that repentance, and faith in the promised Sacrifice, were all\nthat God required, and again Moses confessed his sin and implored\npardon in the name of Jesus.\nAnd now a panoramic view of the Land of Promise was presented\nto him. Every part of the country was spread out before him, not faint\nand uncertain in the dim distance, but standing out clear, distinct,\nand beautiful to his delighted vision. In this scene it was presented,\nnot as it then appeared, but as it would become, with God\u2019s blessing\nupon it, in the possession of Israel. He seemed to be looking upon a\nsecond Eden. There were mountains clothed with cedars of Lebanon,\nhills gray with olives and fragrant with the odor of the vine, wide\ngreen plains bright with flowers and rich in fruitfulness, here the\npalm trees of the tropics, there waving fields of wheat and barley,\nsunny valleys musical with the ripple of brooks and the song of birds,\ngoodly cities and fair gardens, lakes rich in \u201cthe abundance of the\n430 Patriarchs and Prophets\nseas,\u201d grazing flocks upon the hillsides, and even amid the rocks the\nwild bee\u2019s hoarded treasures. It was indeed such a land as Moses,\ninspired by the Spirit of God, had described to Israel: \u201cBlessed of[473]\n[474]\n[475]\nthe Lord ... for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for\nthe deep that coucheth beneath, and for the precious fruits brought\nforth by the sun, ... and for the chief things of the ancient mountains,\n... and for the precious things of the earth and fullness thereof.\u201d\nMoses saw the chosen people established in Canaan, each of\nthe tribes in its own possession. He had a view of their history\nafter the settlement of the Promised Land; the long, sad story of\ntheir apostasy and its punishment was spread out before him. He\nsaw them, because of their sins, dispersed among the heathen, the\nglory departed from Israel, her beautiful city in ruins, and her people\ncaptives in strange lands. He saw them restored to the land of their\nfathers, and at last brought under the dominion of Rome.\nHe was permitted to look down the stream of time and behold\nthe first advent of our Saviour. He saw Jesus as a babe in Bethlehem.\nHe heard the voices of the angelic host break forth in the glad song\nof praise to God and peace on earth. He beheld in the heavens the\nstar guiding the Wise Men of the East to Jesus, and a great light\nflooded his mind as he called those prophetic words, \u201cThere shall\ncome a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel.\u201d\nNumbers 24:17. He beheld Christ\u2019s humble life in Nazareth, His\nministry of love and sympathy and healing, His rejection by a proud,\nunbelieving nation. Amazed he listened to their boastful exaltation\nof the law of God, while they despised and rejected Him by whom\nthe law was given. He saw Jesus upon Olivet as with weeping He\nbade farewell to the city of His love. As Moses beheld the final\nrejection of that people so highly blessed of Heaven\u2014that people\nfor whom he had toiled and prayed and sacrificed, for whom he had\nbeen willing that his own name should be blotted from the book of\nlife; as he listened to those fearful words, \u201cBehold your house is\nleft unto you desolate\u201d (Matthew 23:38), his heart was wrung with\nanguish, and bitter tears fell from his eyes, in sympathy with the\nsorrow of the Son of God.\nHe followed the Saviour to Gethsemane, and beheld the agony in\nthe garden, the betrayal, the mockery and scourging\u2014the crucifix-\nion. Moses saw that as he had lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,\nDeath of Moses 431\nso the Son of God must be lifted up, that whosoever would believe\non Him \u201cshould not perish, but have eternal life.\u201d John 3:15. Grief, [476]\nindignation, and horror filled the heart of Moses as he viewed the\nhypocrisy and satanic hatred manifested by the Jewish nation against\ntheir Redeemer, the mighty Angel who had gone before their fathers.\nHe heard Christ\u2019s agonizing cry, \u201cMy God, My God, why hast Thou\nforsaken Me?\u201d Mark 15:34. He saw Him lying in Joseph\u2019s new tomb.\nThe darkness of hopeless despair seemed to enshroud the world. But\nhe looked again, and beheld Him coming forth a conqueror, and\nascending to heaven escorted by adoring angels and leading a mul-\ntitude of captives. He saw the shining gates open to receive Him,\nand the host of heaven with songs of triumph welcoming their Com-\nmander. And it was there revealed to him that he himself would be\none who should attend the Saviour, and open to Him the everlasting\ngates. As he looked upon the scene, his countenance shone with a\nholy radiance. How small appeared the trials and sacrifices of his\nlife when compared with those of the Son of God! how light in\ncontrast with the \u201cfar more exceeding and eternal weight of glory\u201d!\n2 Corinthians 4:17. He rejoiced that he had been permitted, even in\na small measure, to be a partaker in the sufferings of Christ.\nMoses beheld the disciples of Jesus as they went forth to carry\nHis gospel to the world. He saw that though the people of Israel\n\u201caccording to the flesh\u201d had failed of the high destiny to which God\nhad called them, in their unbelief had failed to become the light\nof the world, though they had despised God\u2019s mercy and forfeited\ntheir blessings as His chosen people\u2014yet God had not cast off the\nseed of Abraham; the glorious purposes which He had undertaken\nto accomplish through Israel were to be fulfilled. All who through\nChrist should become the children of faith were to be counted as\nAbraham\u2019s seed; they were inheritors of the covenant promises; like\nAbraham, they were called to guard and to make known to the world\nthe law of God and the gospel of His Son. Moses saw the light of\nthe gospel shining out through the disciples of Jesus to them \u201cwhich\nsat in darkness\u201d (Matthew 4:16), and thousands from the lands of\nthe Gentiles flocking to the brightness of its rising. And beholding,\nhe rejoiced in the increase and prosperity of Israel.\nAnd now another scene passed before him. He had been shown\nthe work of Satan in leading the Jews to reject Christ, while they\n432 Patriarchs and Prophets\nprofessed to honor His Father\u2019s law. He now saw the Christian world[477]\nunder a similar deception in professing to accept Christ while they\nrejected God\u2019s law. He had heard from the priests and elders the\nfrenzied cry, \u201cAway with Him!\u201d \u201cCrucify Him, crucify Him!\u201d and\nnow he heard from professedly Christian teachers the cry, \u201cAway\nwith the law!\u201d He saw the Sabbath trodden under foot, and a spurious\ninstitution established in its place. Again Moses was filled with\nastonishment and horror. How could those who believed in Christ\nreject the law spoken by His own voice upon the sacred mount? How\ncould any that feared God set aside the law which is the foundation\nof His government in heaven and earth? With joy Moses saw the law\nof God still honored and exalted by a faithful few. He saw the last\ngreat struggle of earthly powers to destroy those who keep God\u2019s\nlaw. He looked forward to the time when God shall arise to punish\nthe inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity, and those who have\nfeared His name shall be covered and hid in the day of His anger. He\nheard God\u2019s covenant of peace with those who have kept His law, as\nHe utters His voice from His holy habitation and the heavens and\nthe earth do shake. He saw the second coming of Christ in glory, the\nrighteous dead raised to immortal life, and the living saints translated\nwithout seeing death, and together ascending with songs of gladness\nto the City of God.\nStill another scene opens to his view\u2014the earth freed from the\ncurse, lovelier than the fair Land of Promise so lately spread out\nbefore him. There is no sin, and death cannot enter. There the nations\nof the saved find their eternal home. With joy unutterable Moses\nlooks upon the scene\u2014the fulfillment of a more glorious deliverance\nthan his brightest hopes have ever pictured. Their earthly wanderings\nforever past, the Israel of God have at last entered the goodly land.\nAgain the vision faded, and his eyes rested upon the land of\nCanaan as it spread out in the distance. Then, like a tired warrior,\nhe lay down to rest. \u201cSo Moses the servant of the Lord died there in\nthe land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And He buried\nhim in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor: but\nno man knoweth of his sepulcher.\u201d Many who had been unwilling\nto heed the counsels of Moses while he was with them would have\nbeen in danger of committing idolatry over his dead body had they[478]\nknown the place of his burial. For this reason it was concealed from\nDeath of Moses 433\nmen. But angels of God buried the body of His faithful servant and\nwatched over the lonely grave.\n\u201cThere arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom\nJehovah knew face to face, in all the signs and the wonders which\nJehovah sent him to do ... and in all that mighty hand, and in all the\ngreat terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel.\u201d\nHad not the life of Moses been marred with that one sin, in failing\nto give God the glory of bringing water from the rock at Kadesh,\nhe would have entered the Promised Land, and would have been\ntranslated to heaven without seeing death. But he was not long to\nremain in the tomb. Christ Himself, with the angels who had buried\nMoses, came down from heaven to call forth the sleeping saint.\nSatan had exulted at his success in causing Moses to sin against God,\nand thus come under the dominion of death. The great adversary\ndeclared that the divine sentence\u2014\u201cDust thou art, and unto dust\nshalt thou return\u201d (Genesis 3:19)\u2014gave him possession of the dead.\nThe power of the grave had never been broken, and all who were in\nthe tomb he claimed as his captives, never to be released from his\ndark prison house.\nFor the first time Christ was about to give life to the dead. As\nthe Prince of life and the shining ones approached the grave, Satan\nwas alarmed for his supremacy. With his evil angels he stood to\ndispute an invasion of the territory that he claimed as his own. He\nboasted that the servant of God had become his prisoner. He declared\nthat even Moses was not able to keep the law of God; that he had\ntaken to himself the glory due to Jehovah\u2014the very sin which had\ncaused Satan\u2019s banishment from heaven\u2014and by transgression had\ncome under the dominion of Satan. The archtraitor reiterated the\noriginal charges that he had made against the divine government,\nand repeated his complaints of God\u2019s injustice toward him.\nChrist did not stoop to enter into controversy with Satan. He\nmight have brought against him the cruel work which his deceptions\nhad wrought in heaven, causing the ruin of a vast number of its\ninhabitants. He might have pointed to the falsehoods told in Eden, [479]\nthat had led to Adam\u2019s sin and brought death upon the human race.\nHe might have reminded Satan that it was his own work in tempting\nIsrael to murmuring and rebellion, which had wearied the long-\nsuffering patience of their leader, and in an unguarded moment had\n434 Patriarchs and Prophets\nsurprised him into the sin for which he had fallen under the power\nof death. But Christ referred all to His Father, saying, \u201cThe Lord\nrebuke thee.\u201d Jude 9. The Saviour entered into no dispute with His\nadversary, but He then and there began His work of breaking the\npower of the fallen foe, and bringing the dead to life. Here was an\nevidence that Satan could not controvert, of the supremacy of the\nSon of God. The resurrection was forever made certain. Satan was\ndespoiled of his prey; the righteous dead would live again.\nIn consequence of sin Moses had come under the power of Satan.\nIn his own merits he was death\u2019s lawful captive; but he was raised to\nimmortal life, holding his title in the name of the Redeemer. Moses\ncame forth from the tomb glorified, and ascended with his Deliverer\nto the City of God.\nNever, till exemplified in the sacrifice of Christ, were the justice\nand the love of God more strikingly displayed than in His dealings\nwith Moses. God shut Moses out of Canaan, to teach a lesson which\nshould never be forgotten\u2014that He requires exact obedience, and\nthat men are to beware of taking to themselves the glory which is\ndue to their Maker. He could not grant the prayer of Moses that\nhe might share the inheritance of Israel, but He did not forget or\nforsake His servant. The God of heaven understood the suffering\nthat Moses had endured; He had noted every act of faithful service\nthrough those long years of conflict and trial. On the top of Pisgah,\nGod called Moses to an inheritance infinitely more glorious than the\nearthly Canaan.\nUpon the mount of transfiguration Moses was present with Elijah,\nwho had been translated. They were sent as bearers of light and\nglory from the Father to His Son. And thus the prayer of Moses,\nuttered so many centuries before, was at last fulfilled. He stood upon\nthe \u201cgoodly mountain,\u201d within the heritage of his people, bearing\nwitness to Him in whom all the promises to Israel centered. Such is\nthe last scene revealed to mortal vision in the history of that man so\nhighly honored of Heaven.\nMoses was a type of Christ. He himself had declared to Israel,[480]\n\u201cThe Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst\nof thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto Him ye shall hearken.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 18:15. God saw fit to discipline Moses in the school\nof affliction and poverty before he could be prepared to lead the\nDeath of Moses 435\nhosts of Israel to the earthly Canaan. The Israel of God, journeying\nto the heavenly Canaan, have a Captain who needed no human\nteaching to prepare Him for His mission as a divine leader; yet He\nwas made perfect through sufferings; and \u201cin that He Himself hath\nsuffered being tempted, He is able to succor them that are tempted.\u201d\nHebrews 2:10, 18. Our Redeemer manifested no human weakness\nor imperfection; yet He died to obtain for us an entrance into the\nPromised Land.\n\u201cAnd Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a\ntestimony of those things which were to be spoken after; but Christ\nas a son over His own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the\nconfidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.\u201d Hebrews\n3:5, 6.\nChapter 44\u2014Crossing the Jordan[481]\nThis chapter is based on Joshua 1 to 5:12.\nThe Israelites deeply mourned for their departed leader, and\nthirty days were devoted to special services in honor of his memory.\nNever till he was taken from them had they so fully realized the value\nof his wise counsels, his parental tenderness, and his unswerving\nfaith. With a new and deeper appreciation they recalled the precious\nlessons he had given while still with them.\nMoses was dead, but his influence did not die with him. It was to\nlive on, reproducing itself in the hearts of his people. The memory\nof that holy, unselfish life would long be cherished, with silent,\npersuasive power molding the lives even of those who had neglected\nhis living words. As the glow of the descending sun lights up the\nmountain peaks long after the sun itself has sunk behind the hills,\nso the works of the pure, the holy, and the good shed light upon\nthe world long after the actors themselves have passed away. Their\nworks, their words, their example, will forever live. \u201cThe righteous\nshall be in everlasting remembrance.\u201d Psalm 112:6.\nWhile they were filled with grief at their great loss, the people\nknew that they were not left alone. The pillar of cloud rested over\nthe tabernacle by day, and the pillar of fire by night, an assurance\nthat God would still be their guide and helper if they would walk in\nthe way of His commandments.\nJoshua was now the acknowledged leader of Israel. He had been\nknown chiefly as a warrior, and his gifts and virtues were especially\nvaluable at this stage in the history of his people. Courageous, res-\nolute, and persevering, prompt, incorruptible, unmindful of selfish\ninterests in his care for those committed to his charge, and, above\nall, inspired by a living faith in God\u2014such was the character of the\nman divinely chosen to conduct the armies of Israel in their entrance\nupon the Promised Land. During the sojourn in the wilderness he\nhad acted as prime minister to Moses, and by his quiet, unpretending[482]\n436\nCrossing the Jordan 437\nfidelity, his steadfastness when others wavered, his firmness to main-\ntain the truth in the midst of danger, he had given evidence of his\nfitness to succeed Moses, even before he was called to the position\nby the voice of God.\nIt was with great anxiety and self-distrust that Joshua had looked\nforward to the work before him; but his fears were removed by the\nassurance of God, \u201cAs I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I\nwill not fail thee, nor forsake thee.... Unto this people shalt thou\ndivide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to\ngive them.\u201d \u201cEvery place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon,\nthat have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.\u201d To the heights of\nLebanon in the far distance, to the shores of the Great Sea, and away\nto the banks of the Euphrates in the east\u2014all was to be theirs.\nTo this promise was added the injunction, \u201cOnly be thou strong\nand very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all\nthe law, which Moses My servant commanded.\u201d The Lord\u2019s direction\nwas, \u201cThis book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou\nshalt meditate therein day and night;\u201d \u201cturn not from it to the right\nhand or to the left;\u201d \u201cfor then thou shalt make thy way prosperous,\nand then thou shalt have good success.\u201d\nThe Israelites were still encamped on the east side of Jordan,\nwhich presented the first barrier to the occupation of Canaan. \u201cArise,\u201d\nhad been the first message of God to Joshua, \u201cgo over this Jordan,\nthou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them.\u201d No\ninstruction was given as to the way in which they were to make the\npassage. Joshua knew, however, that whatever God should command,\nHe would make a way for His people to perform, and in this faith\nthe intrepid leader at once began his arrangements for an advance.\nA few miles beyond the river, just opposite the place where the\nIsraelites were encamped, was the large and strongly fortified city of\nJericho. This city was virtually the key to the whole country, and it\nwould present a formidable obstacle to the success of Israel. Joshua\ntherefore sent two young men as spies to visit this city and ascertain\nsomething as to its population, its resources, and the strength of its\nfortifications. The inhabitants of the city, terrified and suspicious,\nwere constantly on the alert, and the messengers were in great danger. [483]\nThey were, however, preserved by Rahab, a woman of Jericho, at\n438 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe peril of her own life. In return for her kindness they gave her a\npromise of protection when the city should be taken.\nThe spies returned in safety with the tidings, \u201cTruly the Lord\nhath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants\nof the country do faint because of us.\u201d It had been declared to them\nin Jericho, \u201cWe have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the\nRed Sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto\nthe two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan,\nSihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. And as soon as we had\nheard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any\nmore courage in any man, because of you: for the Lord your God,\nHe is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.\u201d\nOrders were now issued to make ready for an advance. The\npeople were to prepare a three days\u2019 supply of food, and the army\nwas to be put in readiness for battle. All heartily acquiesced in the\nplans of their leader and assured him of their confidence and support:\n\u201cAll that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou\nsendest us, we will go. According as we hearkened unto Moses in\nall things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the Lord thy God be\nwith thee, as He was with Moses.\u201d\nLeaving their encampment in the acacia groves of Shittim, the\nhost descended to the border of the Jordan. All knew, however, that\nwithout divine aid they could not hope to make the passage. At\nthis time of the year\u2014in the spring season\u2014the melting snows of\nthe mountains had so raised the Jordan that the river overflowed\nits banks, making it impossible to cross at the usual fording places.\nGod willed that the passage of Israel over Jordan should be miracu-\nlous. Joshua, by divine direction, commanded the people to sanctify\nthemselves; they must put away their sins and free themselves from\nall outward impurity; \u201cfor tomorrow,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Lord will do\nwonders among you.\u201d The \u201cark of the covenant\u201d was to lead the\nway before the host. When they should see the token of Jehovah\u2019s\npresence, borne by the priests, remove from its place in the center\nof the camp, and advance toward the river, then they were to remove\nfrom their place, \u201cand go after it.\u201d The circumstances of the passage[484]\nwere minutely foretold; and said Joshua, \u201cHereby ye shall know that\nthe living God is among you, and that He will without fail drive out\nCrossing the Jordan 439\nfrom before you the Canaanites.... Behold, the ark of the covenant\nof the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.\u201d\nAt the appointed time began the onward movement, the ark,\nborne upon the shoulders of the priests, leading the van. The people\nhad been directed to fall back, so that there was a vacant space of\nmore than half a mile about the ark. All watched with deep interest\nas the priests advanced down the bank of the Jordan. They saw them\nwith the sacred ark move steadily forward toward the angry, surging\nstream, till the feet of the bearers were dipped into the waters. Then\nsuddenly the tide above was swept back, while the current below\nflowed on, and the bed of the river was laid bare.\nAt the divine command the priests advanced to the middle of\nthe channel and stood there while the entire host descended and\ncrossed to the farther side. Thus was impressed upon the minds of\nall Israel the fact that the power that stayed the waters of Jordan was\nthe same that had opened the Red Sea to their fathers forty years\nbefore. When the people had all passed over, the ark itself was borne\nto the western shore. No sooner had it reached a place of security,\nand \u201cthe soles of the priests\u2019 feet were lifted up unto the dry land,\u201d\nthan the imprisoned waters, being set free, rushed down, a resistless\nflood, in the natural channel of the stream.\nComing generations were not to be without a witness to this great\nmiracle. While the priests bearing the ark were still in the midst of\nJordan, twelve men previously chosen, one from each tribe, took\nup each a stone from the river bed where the priests were standing,\nand carried it over to the western side. These stones were to be\nset up as a monument in the first camping place beyond the river.\nThe people were bidden to repeat to their children and children\u2019s\nchildren the story of the deliverance that God had wrought for them,\nas Joshua said, \u201cThat all the people of the earth might know the hand\nof the Lord, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the Lord your God\nforever.\u201d\nThe influence of this miracle, both upon the Hebrews and upon\ntheir enemies, was of great importance. It was an assurance to Israel [485]\nof God\u2019s continued presence and protection\u2014an evidence that He\nwould work for them through Joshua as He had wrought through\nMoses. Such an assurance was needed to strengthen their hearts as\nthey entered upon the conquest of the land\u2014the stupendous task that\n440 Patriarchs and Prophets\nhad staggered the faith of their fathers forty years before. The Lord\nhad declared to Joshua before the crossing, \u201cThis day will I begin to\nmagnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I\nwas with Moses, so I will be with thee.\u201d And the result fulfilled the\npromise. \u201cOn that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all\nIsrael; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his\nlife.\u201d\nThis exercise of divine power in behalf of Israel was designed\nalso to increase the fear with which they were regarded by the sur-\nrounding nations, and thus prepare the way for their easier and\ncomplete triumph. When the tidings that God had stayed the waters\nof Jordan before the children of Israel, reached the kings of the\nAmorites and of the Canaanites, their hearts melted with fear. The\nHebrews had already slain the five kings of Midian, the powerful\nSihon, king of the Amorites, and Og of Bashan, and now the passage\nover the swollen and impetuous Jordan filled all the surrounding\nnations with terror. To the Canaanites, to all Israel, and to Joshua\nhimself, unmistakable evidence had been given that the living God,\nthe King of heaven and earth, was among His people, and that He\nwould not fail them nor forsake them.\nA short distance from Jordan the Hebrews made their first en-\ncampment in Canaan. Here Joshua \u201ccircumcised the children of\nIsrael;\u201d \u201cand the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept\nthe Passover.\u201d The suspension of the rite of circumcision since the\nrebellion at Kadesh had been a constant witness to Israel that their\ncovenant with God, of which it was the appointed symbol, had been\nbroken. And the discontinuance of the Passover, the memorial of\ntheir deliverance from Egypt, had been an evidence of the Lord\u2019s\ndispleasure at their desire to return to the land of bondage. Now,\nhowever, the years of rejection were ended. Once more God ac-\nknowledged Israel as His people, and the sign of the covenant was\nrestored. The rite of circumcision was performed upon all the people\nwho had been born in the wilderness. And the Lord declared to\nJoshua, \u201cThis day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from[486]\noff you,\u201d and in allusion to this the place of their encampment was\ncalled Gilgal, \u201ca rolling away,\u201d or \u201crolling off.\u201d\nHeathen nations had reproached the Lord and His people be-\ncause the Hebrews had failed to take possession of Canaan, as they\nCrossing the Jordan 441\nexpected, soon after leaving Egypt. Their enemies had triumphed\nbecause Israel had wandered so long in the wilderness, and they\nhad mockingly declared that the God of the Hebrews was not able\nto bring them into the Promised Land. The Lord had now signally\nmanifested His power and favor in opening the Jordan before His\npeople, and their enemies could no longer reproach them.\n\u201cOn the fourteenth day of the month at even,\u201d the Passover was\ncelebrated on the plains of Jericho. \u201cAnd they did eat of the old corn\nof the land on the morrow after the Passover, unleavened cakes, and\nparched corn in the selfsame day. And the manna ceased on the\nmorrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had\nthe children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of\nthe land of Canaan.\u201d The long years of their desert wanderings were\nended. The feet of Israel were at last treading the Promised Land.\nChapter 45\u2014The Fall of Jericho[487]\nThis chapter is based on Joshua 5:13-15; 6; 7.\nThe Hebrews had entered Canaan, but they had not subdued it;\nand to human appearance the struggle to gain possession of the land\nmust be long and difficult. It was inhabited by a powerful race, who\nstood ready to oppose the invasion of their territory. The various\ntribes were bound together by the fear of a common danger. Their\nhorses and iron battle chariots, their knowledge of the country, and\ntheir training in war, would give them great advantage. Furthermore,\nthe country was guarded by fortresses\u2014\u201ccities great and fenced up\nto heaven.\u201d Deuteronomy 9:1. Only in the assurance of a strength\nnot their own could the Israelites hope for success in the impending\nconflict.\nOne of the strongest fortresses in the land\u2014the large and wealthy\ncity of Jericho\u2014lay just before them, but a little distance from their\ncamp at Gilgal. On the border of a fertile plain abounding with the\nrich and varied productions of the tropics, its palaces and temples\nthe abode of luxury and vice, this proud city, behind its massive\nbattlements, offered defiance to the God of Israel. Jericho was one\nof the principal seats of idol worship, being especially devoted to\nAshtaroth, the goddess of the moon. Here centered all that was vilest\nand most degrading in the religion of the Canaanites. The people of\nIsrael, in whose minds were fresh the fearful results of their sin at\nBeth-peor, could look upon this heathen city only with disgust and\nhorror.\nTo reduce Jericho was seen by Joshua to be the first step in\nthe conquest of Canaan. But first of all he sought an assurance of\ndivine guidance, and it was granted him. Withdrawing from the\nencampment to meditate and to pray that the God of Israel would\ngo before His people, he beheld an armed warrior, of lofty stature\nand commanding presence, \u201cwith his sword drawn in his hand.\u201d To\nJoshua\u2019s challenge, \u201cArt thou for us, or for our adversaries?\u201d the[488]\n442\nFall of Jericho 443\nanswer was given, \u201cAs Captain of the host of the Lord am I now\ncome.\u201d The same command given to Moses in Horeb, \u201cLoose thy\nshoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy,\u201d\nrevealed the true character of the mysterious stranger. It was Christ,\nthe Exalted One, who stood before the leader of Israel. Awe-stricken,\nJoshua fell upon his face and worshiped, and heard the assurance,\n\u201cI have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the\nmighty men of valor,\u201d and he received instruction for the capture of\nthe city.\nIn obedience to the divine command Joshua marshaled the armies\nof Israel. No assault was to be made. They were simply to make\nthe circuit of the city, bearing the ark of God and blowing upon\ntrumpets. First came the warriors, a body of chosen men, not now\nto conquer by their own skill and prowess, but by obedience to\nthe directions given them from God. Seven priests with trumpets\nfollowed. Then the ark of God, surrounded by a halo of divine glory,\nwas borne by priests clad in the dress denoting their sacred office.\nThe army of Israel followed, each tribe under its standard. Such\nwas the procession that compassed the doomed city. No sound was\nheard but the tread of that mighty host and the solemn peal of the\ntrumpets, echoing among the hills and resounding through the streets\nof Jericho. The circuit completed, the army returned in silence to\ntheir tents, and the ark was restored to its place in the tabernacle.\nWith wonder and alarm the watchmen of the city marked every\nmove, and reported to those in authority. They knew not the meaning\nof all this display; but when they beheld that mighty host marching\naround their city once each day, with the sacred ark and the attendant\npriests, the mystery of the scene struck terror to the hearts of priest\nand people. Again they would inspect their strong defenses, feeling\ncertain they could successfully resist the most powerful attack. Many\nridiculed the thought that any harm could come to them through\nthese singular demonstrations. Others were awed as they beheld the\nprocession that each day wound about the city. They remembered\nthat the Red Sea had once parted before this people, and that a\npassage had just been opened for them through the river Jordan.\nThey knew not what further wonders God might work for them.\nFor six days the host of Israel made the circuit of the city. The\nseventh day came, and with the first dawn of light, Joshua marshaled\n444 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe armies of the Lord. Now they were directed to march seven times[489]\n[490]\n[491]\naround Jericho, and at a mighty peal from the trumpets to shout with\na loud voice, for God had given them the city.\nThe vast army marched solemnly around the devoted walls. All\nwas silent, save the measured tread of many feet, and the occasional\nsound of the trumpet, breaking the stillness of the early morning.\nThe massive walls of solid stone seemed to defy the siege of men.\nThe watchers on the walls looked on with rising fear, as, the first\ncircuit ended, there followed a second, then a third, a fourth, a fifth,\na sixth. What could be the object of these mysterious movements?\nWhat mighty event was impending? They had not long to wait. As\nthe seventh circuit was completed, the long procession paused, The\ntrumpets, which for an interval had been silent, now broke forth\nin a blast that shook the very earth. The walls of solid stone, with\ntheir massive towers and battlements, tottered and heaved from their\nfoundations, and with a crash fell in ruin to the earth. The inhabitants\nof Jericho were paralyzed with terror, and the hosts of Israel marched\nin and took possession of the city.\nThe Israelites had not gained the victory by their own power;\nthe conquest had been wholly the Lord\u2019s; and as the first fruits of\nthe land, the city, with all that it contained, was to be devoted as\na sacrifice to God. It was to be impressed upon Israel that in the\nconquest of Canaan they were not to fight for themselves, but simply\nas instruments to execute the will of God; not to seek for riches\nor self-exaltation, but the glory of Jehovah their King. Before the\ncapture the command had been given, \u201cThe city shall be accursed,\neven it, and all that are therein.\u201d \u201cKeep yourselves from the accursed\nthing, lest ye make yourselves accursed ... and make the camp of\nIsrael a curse, and trouble it.\u201d\nAll the inhabitants of the city, with every living thing that it\ncontained, \u201cboth man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep,\nand ass,\u201d were put to the sword. Only faithful Rahab, with her\nhousehold, was spared, in fulfillment of the promise of the spies.\nThe city itself was burned; its palaces and temples, its magnificent\ndwellings with all their luxurious appointments, the rich draperies\nand the costly garments, were given to the flames. That which could\nnot be destroyed by fire, \u201cthe silver, and the gold, and the vessels of\nbrass and of iron,\u201d was to be devoted to the service of the tabernacle.\nFall of Jericho 445\nThe very site of the city was accursed; Jericho was never to be rebuilt\nas a stronghold; judgments were threatened upon anyone who should [492]\npresume to restore the walls that divine power had cast down. The\nsolemn declaration was made in the presence of all Israel, \u201cCursed\nbe the man before the Lord, that riseth up and buildeth this city\nJericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his first-born, and in\nhis youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.\u201d\nThe utter destruction of the people of Jericho was but a fulfill-\nment of the commands previously given through Moses concerning\nthe inhabitants of Canaan: \u201cThou shalt smite them, and utterly de-\nstroy them.\u201d Deuteronomy 7:2. \u201cOf the cities of these people, ...\nthou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth.\u201d Deuteronomy 20:16.\nTo many these commands seem to be contrary to the spirit of love\nand mercy enjoined in other portions of the Bible, but they were in\ntruth the dictates of infinite wisdom and goodness. God was about\nto establish Israel in Canaan, to develop among them a nation and\ngovernment that should be a manifestation of His kingdom upon the\nearth. They were not only to be inheritors of the true religion, but to\ndisseminate its principles throughout the world. The Canaanites had\nabandoned themselves to the foulest and most debasing heathenism,\nand it was necessary that the land should be cleared of what would\nso surely prevent the fulfillment of God\u2019s gracious purposes.\nThe inhabitants of Canaan had been granted ample opportunity\nfor repentance. Forty years before, the opening of the Red Sea and\nthe judgments upon Egypt had testified to the supreme power of the\nGod of Israel. And now the overthrow of the kings of Midian, of\nGilead and Bashan, had further shown that Jehovah was above all\ngods. The holiness of His character and His abhorrence of impurity\nhad been evinced in the judgments visited upon Israel for their\nparticipation in the abominable rites of Baalpeor. All these events\nwere known to the inhabitants of Jericho, and there were many\nwho shared Rahab\u2019s conviction, though they refused to obey it, that\nJehovah, the God of Israel, \u201cis God in heaven above, and upon the\nearth beneath.\u201d Like the men before the Flood, the Canaanites lived\nonly to blaspheme Heaven and defile the earth. And both love and\njustice demanded the prompt execution of these rebels against God\nand foes to man.\n446 Patriarchs and Prophets\nHow easily the armies of heaven brought down the walls of\nJericho, that proud city whose bulwarks, forty years before, had[493]\nstruck terror to the unbelieving spies! The Mighty One of Israel\nhad said, \u201cI have given into thine hand Jericho.\u201d Against that word\nhuman strength was powerless.\n\u201cBy faith the walls of Jericho fell down.\u201d Hebrews 11:30. The\nCaptain of the Lord\u2019s host communicated only with Joshua; He did\nnot reveal Himself to all the congregation, and it rested with them to\nbelieve or doubt the words of Joshua, to obey the commands given\nby him in the name of the Lord, or to deny his authority. They could\nnot see the host of angels who attended them under the leadership\nof the Son of God. They might have reasoned: \u201cWhat unmeaning\nmovements are these, and how ridiculous the performance of march-\ning daily around the walls of the city, blowing trumpets of rams\u2019\nhorns. This can have no effect upon those towering fortifications.\u201d\nBut the very plan of continuing this ceremony through so long a\ntime prior to the final overthrow of the walls afforded opportunity\nfor the development of faith among the Israelites. It was to be im-\npressed upon their minds that their strength was not in the wisdom\nof man, nor in his might, but only in the God of their salvation. They\nwere thus to become accustomed to relying wholly upon their divine\nLeader.\nGod will do great things for those who trust in Him. The reason\nwhy His professed people have no greater strength is that they trust so\nmuch to their own wisdom, and do not give the Lord an opportunity\nto reveal His power in their behalf. He will help His believing\nchildren in every emergency if they will place their entire confidence\nin Him and faithfully obey Him.\nSoon after the fall of Jericho, Joshua determined to attack Ai,\na small town among the ravines a few miles to the west of the\nJordan Valley. Spies sent to this place brought back the report that\nthe inhabitants were but few, and that only a small force would be\nneeded to overthrow it.\nThe great victory that God had gained for them had made the\nIsraelites self-confident. Because He had promised them the land of\nCanaan they felt secure, and failed to realize that divine help alone\ncould give them success. Even Joshua laid his plans for the conquest\nof Ai without seeking counsel from God.\nFall of Jericho 447\nThe Israelites had begun to exalt their own strength and to look\nwith contempt upon their foes. An easy victory was expected, and\nthree thousand men were thought sufficient to take the place. These [494]\nrushed to the attack without the assurance that God would be with\nthem. They advanced nearly to the gate of the city, only to encounter\nthe most determined resistance. Panic-stricken at the numbers and\nthorough preparation of their enemies, they fled in confusion down\nthe steep descent. The Canaanites were in hot pursuit; \u201cthey chased\nthem from before the gate, ... and smote them in the going down.\u201d\nThough the loss was small as to numbers\u2014but thirty-six men being\nslain\u2014the defeat was disheartening to the whole congregation. \u201cThe\nhearts of the people melted, and became as water.\u201d This was the first\ntime they had met the Canaanites in actual battle, and if put to flight\nbefore the defenders of this little town, what would be the result\nin the greater conflicts before them? Joshua looked upon their ill\nsuccess as an expression of God\u2019s displeasure, and in distress and\napprehension he \u201crent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face\nbefore the ark of the Lord until the eventide, he and the elders of\nIsrael, and put dust upon their heads.\u201d\n\u201cAlas, O Lord God,\u201d he cried, \u201cwherefore hast Thou at all\nbrought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the\nAmorites, to destroy us? ... O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel\nturneth their backs before their enemies! For the Canaanites and\nall the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us\nround, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt Thou do\nunto Thy great name?\u201d\nThe answer from Jehovah was, \u201cGet thee up; wherefore liest\nthou thus upon thy face? Israel hath ... transgressed My covenant\nwhich I commanded them.\u201d It was a time for prompt and decided\naction, and not for despair and lamentation. There was secret sin\nin the camp, and it must be searched out and put away before the\npresence and blessing of the Lord could be with His people. \u201cNeither\nwill I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from\namong you.\u201d\nGod\u2019s command had been disregarded by one of those appointed\nto execute His judgments. And the nation was held accountable for\nthe guilt of the transgressor: \u201cThey have even taken of the accursed\nthing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also.\u201d Instruction was\n448 Patriarchs and Prophets\ngiven to Joshua for the discovery and punishment of the criminal.\nThe lot was to be employed for the detection of the guilty. The sinner\nwas not directly pointed out, the matter being left in doubt for a time,\nthat the people might feel their responsibility for the sins existing[495]\namong them, and thus be led to searching of heart and humiliation\nbefore God.\nEarly in the morning, Joshua gathered the people together by\ntheir tribes, and the solemn and impressive ceremony began. Step\nby step the investigation went on. Closer and still closer came the\nfearful test. First the tribe, then the family, then the household, then\nthe man was taken, and Achan the son of Carmi, of the tribe of\nJudah, was pointed out by the finger of God as the troubler of Israel.\nTo establish his guilt beyond all question, leaving no ground for\nthe charge that he had been unjustly condemned, Joshua solemnly\nadjured Achan to acknowledge the truth. The wretched man made\nfull confession of his crime: \u201cIndeed I have sinned against the Lord\nGod of Israel.... When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish\ngarment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold\nof fifty shekel\u2019s weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and,\nbehold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent.\u201d Messengers\nwere immediately dispatched to the tent, where they removed the\nearth at the place specified, and \u201cbehold, it was hid in his tent, and\nthe silver under it. And they took them out of the midst of the tent,\nand brought them unto Joshua, ... and laid them out before the Lord.\u201d\nSentence was pronounced and immediately executed. \u201cWhy\nhast thou troubled us?\u201d said Joshua, \u201cthe Lord shall trouble thee\nthis day.\u201d As the people had been held responsible for Achan\u2019s sin,\nand had suffered from its consequences, they were, through their\nrepresentatives, to take part in its punishment. \u201cAll Israel stoned him\nwith stones.\u201d\nThen there was raised over him a great pile of stones\u2014a witness\nto the sin and its punishment. \u201cWherefore the name of that place\nwas called, The valley of Achor,\u201d that is, \u201ctrouble.\u201d In the book of\nChronicles his memorial is written\u2014\u201cAchar, the troubler of Israel.\u201d\n1 Chronicles 2:7.\nAchan\u2019s sin was committed in defiance of the most direct and\nsolemn warnings and the most mighty manifestations of God\u2019s\npower. \u201cKeep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make\nFall of Jericho 449\nyourselves accursed,\u201d had been the proclamation to all Israel. The\ncommand was given immediately after the miraculous passage of the\nJordan, and the recognition of God\u2019s covenant by the circumcision\nof the people\u2014after the observance of the Passover, and the appear- [496]\nance of the Angel of the covenant, the Captain of the Lord\u2019s host.\nIt had been followed by the overthrow of Jericho, giving evidence\nof the destruction which will surely overtake all transgressors of\nGod\u2019s law. The fact that divine power alone had given the victory\nto Israel, that they had not come into possession of Jericho by their\nown strength, gave solemn weight to the command prohibiting them\nfrom partaking of the spoils. God, by the might of His own word,\nhad overthrown this stronghold; the conquest was His, and to Him\nalone the city with all that it contained was to be devoted.\nOf the millions of Israel there was but one man who, in that\nsolemn hour of triumph and of judgment, had dared to transgress the\ncommand of God. Achan\u2019s covetousness was excited by the sight\nof that costly robe of Shinar; even when it had brought him face to\nface with death he called it \u201ca goodly Babylonish garment.\u201d One sin\nhad led to another, and he appropriated the gold and silver devoted\nto the treasury of the Lord\u2014he robbed God of the first fruits of the\nland of Canaan.\nThe deadly sin that led to Achan\u2019s ruin had its root in cov-\netousness, of all sins one of the most common and the most lightly\nregarded. While other offenses meet with detection and punishment,\nhow rarely does the violation of the tenth commandment so much as\ncall forth censure. The enormity of this sin, and its terrible results,\nare the lessons of Achan\u2019s history.\nCovetousness is an evil of gradual development. Achan had\ncherished greed of gain until it became a habit, binding him in\nfetters well-nigh impossible to break. While fostering this evil, he\nwould have been filled with horror at the thought of bringing disaster\nupon Israel; but his perceptions were deadened by sin, and when\ntemptation came, he fell an easy prey.\nAre not similar sins still committed, in the face of warnings as\nsolemn and explicit? We are as directly forbidden to indulge cov-\netousness as was Achan to appropriate the spoils of Jericho. God has\ndeclared it to be idolatry. We are warned, \u201cYe cannot serve God and\nmammon.\u201d Matthew 6:24. \u201cTake heed, and beware of covetousness.\u201d\n450 Patriarchs and Prophets\nLuke 12:15. \u201cLet it not be once named among you.\u201d Ephesians 5:3.\nWe have before us the fearful doom of Achan, of Judas, of Ananias\nand Sapphira. Back of all these we have that of Lucifer, the \u201cson\nof the morning,\u201d who, coveting a higher state, forfeited forever the[497]\nbrightness and bliss of heaven. And yet, notwithstanding all these\nwarnings, covetousness abounds.\nEverywhere its slimy track is seen. It creates discontent and\ndissension in families; it excites envy and hatred in the poor against\nthe rich; it prompts the grinding oppression of the rich toward the\npoor. And this evil exists not in the world alone, but in the church.\nHow common even here to find selfishness, avarice, overreaching,\nneglect of charities, and robbery of God \u201cin tithes and offerings.\u201d\nAmong church members \u201cin good and regular standing\u201d there are,\nalas! many Achans. Many a man comes statedly to church, and\nsits at the table of the Lord, while among his possessions are hid-\nden unlawful gains, the things that God has cursed. For a goodly\nBabylonish garment, multitudes sacrifice the approval of conscience\nand their hope of heaven. Multitudes barter their integrity, and their\ncapabilities for usefulness, for a bag of silver shekels. The cries\nof the suffering poor are unheeded; the gospel light is hindered in\nits course; the scorn of worldlings is kindled by practices that give\nthe lie to the Christian profession; and yet the covetous professor\ncontinues to heap up treasures. \u201cWill a man rob God? Yet ye have\nrobbed Me\u201d (Malachi 3:8), saith the Lord.\nAchan\u2019s sin brought disaster upon the whole nation. For one\nman\u2019s sin the displeasure of God will rest upon His church till the\ntransgression is searched out and put away. The influence most to\nbe feared by the church is not that of open opposers, infidels, and\nblasphemers, but of inconsistent professors of Christ. These are\nthe ones that keep back the blessing of the God of Israel and bring\nweakness upon His people.\nWhen the church is in difficulty, when coldness and spiritual\ndeclension exist, giving occasion for the enemies of God to triumph,\nthen, instead of folding their hands and lamenting their unhappy\nstate, let its members inquire if there is not an Achan in the camp.\nWith humiliation and searching of heart, let each seek to discover\nthe hidden sins that shut out God\u2019s presence.\nFall of Jericho 451\nAchan acknowledged his guilt, but when it was too late for the\nconfession to benefit himself. He had seen the armies of Israel return\nfrom Ai defeated and disheartened; yet he did not come forward and\nconfess his sin. He had seen Joshua and the elders of Israel bowed to [498]\nthe earth in grief too great for words. Had he then made confession,\nhe would have given some proof of true penitence; but he still kept\nsilence. He had listened to the proclamation that a great crime had\nbeen committed, and had even heard its character definitely stated.\nBut his lips were sealed. Then came the solemn investigation. How\nhis soul thrilled with terror as he saw his tribe pointed out, then his\nfamily and his household! But still he uttered no confession, until\nthe finger of God was placed upon him. Then, when his sin could\nno longer be concealed, he admitted the truth. How often are similar\nconfessions made. There is a vast difference between admitting\nfacts after they have been proved and confessing sins known only\nto ourselves and to God. Achan would not have confessed had he\nnot hoped by so doing to avert the consequences of his crime. But\nhis confession only served to show that his punishment was just.\nThere was no genuine repentance for sin, no contrition, no change\nof purpose, no abhorrence of evil.\nSo confessions will be made by the guilty when they stand\nbefore the bar of God, after every case has been decided for life or\ndeath. The consequences to result to himself will draw from each\nan acknowledgment of his sin. It will be forced from the soul by an\nawful sense of condemnation and a fearful looking for of judgment.\nBut such confessions cannot save the sinner.\nSo long as they can conceal their transgressions from their fellow\nmen, many, like Achan, feel secure, and flatter themselves that God\nwill not be strict to mark iniquity. All too late their sins will find\nthem out in that day when they shall not be purged with sacrifice or\noffering forever. When the records of heaven shall be opened, the\nJudge will not in words declare to man his guilt, but will cast one\npenetrating, convicting glance, and every deed, every transaction of\nlife, will be vividly impressed upon the memory of the wrongdoer.\nThe person will not, as in Joshua\u2019s day, need to be hunted out from\ntribe to family, but his own lips will confess his shame. The sins\nhidden from the knowledge of men will then be proclaimed to the\nwhole world.\nChapter 46\u2014The Blessings and the Curses[499]\nThis chapter is based on Joshua 8.\nAfter the execution of the sentence upon Achan, Joshua was\ncommanded to marshal all the men of war and again advance against\nAi. The power of God was with His people, and they were soon in\npossession of the city.\nMilitary operations were now suspended, that all Israel might\nengage in a solemn religious service. The people were eager to\nobtain a settlement in Canaan; as yet they had not homes or lands\nfor their families, and in order to gain these they must drive out the\nCanaanites; but this important work must be deferred, for a higher\nduty demanded their first attention.\nBefore taking possession of their inheritance, they must renew\ntheir covenant of loyalty to God. In the last instructions of Moses,\ndirection had been twice given for a convocation of the tribes upon\nMounts Ebal and Gerizim, at Shechem, for the solemn recognition\nof the law of God. In obedience to these injunctions the whole\npeople, not only men, but \u201cthe women, and the little ones, and\nthe strangers that were conversant among them\u201d left their camp at\nGilgal, and marched through the country of their enemies, to the\nvale of Shechem, near the center of the land. Though surrounded\nby unconquered foes, they were safe under the protection of God\nas long as they were faithful to Him. Now, as in the days of Jacob,\n\u201cthe terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them\u201d\n(Genesis 35:5), and the Hebrews were unmolested.\nThe place appointed for this solemn service was one already\nsacred from its association with the history of their fathers. It was\nhere that Abraham raised his first altar to Jehovah in the land of\nCanaan. Here both Abraham and Jacob had pitched their tents. Here\nthe latter bought the field in which the tribes were to bury the body\nof Joseph. Here also was the well that Jacob had dug, and the oak[500]\nunder which he had buried the idolatrous images of his household.\n452\nBlessings and the Curses 453\nThe spot chosen was one of the most beautiful in all Palestine,\nand worthy to be the theater where this grand and impressive scene\nwas to be enacted. The lovely valley, its green fields dotted with olive\ngroves, watered with brooks from living fountains, and gemmed with\nwild flowers, spread out invitingly between the barren hills. Ebal\nand Gerizim, upon opposite sides of the valley, nearly approach\neach other, their lower spurs seeming to form a natural pulpit, every\nword spoken on one being distinctly audible on the other, while the\nmountainsides, receding, afford space for a vast assemblage.\nAccording to the directions given by Moses, a monument of great\nstones was erected upon Mount Ebal. Upon these stones, previously\nprepared by a covering of plaster, the law was inscribed\u2014not only\nthe ten precepts spoken from Sinai and engraved on the tables of\nstone, but the laws communicated to Moses, and by him written\nin a book. Beside this monument was built an altar of unhewn\nstone, upon which sacrifices were offered unto the Lord. The fact\nthat the altar was set up on Mount Ebal, the mountain upon which\nthe curse was put, was significant, denoting that because of their\ntransgressions of God\u2019s law, Israel had justly incurred His wrath,\nand that it would be at once visited, but for the atonement of Christ,\nrepresented by the altar of sacrifice.\nSix of the tribes\u2014all descended from Leah and Rachel\u2014were\nstationed upon Mount Gerizim; while those that descended from the\nhandmaids, together with Reuben and Zebulun, took their position\non Ebal, the priests with the ark occupying the valley between them.\nSilence was proclaimed by the sound of the signal trumpet; and\nthen in the deep stillness, and in the presence of this vast assembly,\nJoshua, standing beside the sacred ark, read the blessings that were to\nfollow obedience to God\u2019s law. All the tribes on Gerizim responded\nby an Amen. He then read the curses, and the tribes on Ebal in\nlike manner gave their assent, thousands upon thousands of voices\nuniting as the voice of one man in the solemn response. Following\nthis came the reading of the law of God, together with the statutes\nand judgments that had been delivered to them by Moses.\nIsrael had received the law directly from the mouth of God at\nSinai; and its sacred precepts, written by His own hand, were still [501]\n[502]\n[503]\npreserved in the ark. Now it had been again written where all could\nread it. All had the privilege of seeing for themselves the conditions\n454 Patriarchs and Prophets\nof the covenant under which they were to hold possession of Canaan.\nAll were to signify their acceptance of the terms of the covenant\nand give their assent to the blessings or curses for its observance or\nneglect. The law was not only written upon the memorial stones, but\nwas read by Joshua himself in the hearing of all Israel. It had not\nbeen many weeks since Moses gave the whole book of Deuteronomy\nin discourses to the people, yet now Joshua read the law again.\nNot alone the men of Israel, but \u201call the women and the little\nones\u201d listened to the reading of the law; for it was important that\nthey also should know and do their duty. God had commanded Israel\nconcerning His statutes: \u201cTherefore shall ye lay up these My words\nin your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your\nhand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall\nteach them your children, ... that your days may be multiplied, and\nthe days of your children, in the land which the Lord sware unto\nyour fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 11:18-21.\nEvery seventh year the whole law was to be read in the assembly\nof all Israel, as Moses commanded: \u201cAt the end of every seven years,\nin the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,\nwhen all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God in the\nplace which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel\nin their hearing. Gather the people together, men, and women, and\nchildren, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear,\nand that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and observe to\ndo all the words of this law: and that their children, which have not\nknown anything, may hear, and learn to fear the Lord your God, as\nlong as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 31:10-13.\nSatan is ever at work endeavoring to pervert what God has spo-\nken, to blind the mind and darken the understanding, and thus lead\nmen into sin. This is why the Lord is so explicit, making His require-\nments so very plain that none need err. God is constantly seeking to\ndraw men close under His protection, that Satan may not practice his\ncruel, deceptive power upon them. He has condescended to speak\nto them with His own voice, to write with His own hand the living[504]\noracles. And these blessed words, all instinct with life and luminous\nwith truth, are committed to men as a perfect guide. Because Satan\nBlessings and the Curses 455\nis so ready to catch away the mind and divert the affections from the\nLord\u2019s promises and requirements, the greater diligence is needed to\nfix them in the mind and impress them upon the heart.\nGreater attention should be given by religious teachers to in-\nstructing the people in the facts and lessons of Bible history and the\nwarnings and requirements of the Lord. These should be presented\nin simple language, adapted to the comprehension of children. It\nshould be a part of the work both of ministers and parents to see that\nthe young are instructed in the Scriptures.\nParents can and should interest their children in the varied knowl-\nedge found in the sacred pages. But if they would interest their sons\nand daughters in the word of God, they must be interested in it\nthemselves. They must be familiar with its teachings, and, as God\ncommanded Israel, speak of it, \u201cwhen thou sittest in thine house, and\nwhen thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou\nrisest up.\u201d Deuteronomy 11:19. Those who desire their children to\nlove and reverence God must talk of His goodness, His majesty, and\nHis power, as revealed in His word and in the works of creation.\nEvery chapter and every verse of the Bible is a communication\nfrom God to men. We should bind its precepts as signs upon our\nhands and as frontlets between our eyes. If studied and obeyed, it\nwould lead God\u2019s people, as the Israelites were led, by the pillar of\ncloud by day and the pillar of fire by night.\nChapter 47\u2014League With the Gibeonites[505]\nThis chapter is based on Joshua 9 and 10.\nFrom Shechem the Israelites returned to their encampment at\nGilgal. Here they were soon after visited by a strange deputation,\nwho desired to enter into treaty with them. The ambassadors repre-\nsented that they had come from a distant country, and this seemed\nto be confirmed by their appearance. Their clothing was old and\nworn, their sandals were patched, their provisions moldy, and the\nskins that served them for wine bottles were rent and bound up, as if\nhastily repaired on the journey.\nIn their far-off home\u2014professedly beyond the limits of Pales-\ntine\u2014their fellow countrymen, they said, had heard of the wonders\nwhich God had wrought for His people, and had sent them to make a\nleague with Israel. The Hebrews had been specially warned against\nentering into any league with the idolaters of Canaan, and a doubt\nas to the truth of the strangers\u2019 words arose in the minds of the\nleaders. \u201cPeradventure ye dwell among us,\u201d they said. To this the\nambassadors only replied, \u201cWe are thy servants.\u201d But when Joshua\ndirectly demanded of them, \u201cWho are ye? and from whence come\nye?\u201d they reiterated their former statement, and added, in proof of\ntheir sincerity, \u201cThis our bread we took hot for our provision out\nof our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now,\nbehold, it is dry, and it is moldy: and these bottles of wine, which we\nfilled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments\nand our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.\u201d\nThese representations prevailed. The Hebrews \u201casked not coun-\nsel at the mouth of the Lord. And Joshua made peace with them,\nand made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of\nthe congregation sware unto them.\u201d Thus the treaty was entered\ninto. Three days afterward the truth was discovered. \u201cThey heard\nthat they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.\u201d[506]\n456\nLeague With the Gibeonites 457\nKnowing that it was impossible to resist the Hebrews, the Gibeonites\nhad resorted to stratagem to preserve their lives.\nGreat was the indignation of the Israelites as they learned the\ndeception that had been practiced upon them. And this was height-\nened when, after three days\u2019 journey, they reached the cities of the\nGibeonites, near the center of the land. \u201cAll the congregation mur-\nmured against the princes;\u201d but the latter refused to break the treaty,\nthough secured by fraud, because they had \u201csworn unto them by the\nLord God of Israel.\u201d \u201cAnd the children of Israel smote them not.\u201d The\nGibeonites had pledged themselves to renounce idolatry, and accept\nthe worship of Jehovah; and the preservation of their lives was not a\nviolation of God\u2019s command to destroy the idolatrous Canaanites.\nHence the Hebrews had not by their oath pledged themselves to\ncommit sin. And though the oath had been secured by deception, it\nwas not to be disregarded. The obligation to which one\u2019s word is\npledged\u2014if it do not bind him to perform a wrong act\u2014should be\nheld sacred. No consideration of gain, of revenge, or of self-interest\ncan in any way affect the inviolability of an oath or pledge. \u201cLying\nlips are abomination to the Lord.\u201d Proverbs 12:22. He that \u201cshall\nascend into the hill of the Lord,\u201d and \u201cstand in His holy place,\u201d is\n\u201che that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.\u201d Psalm 24:3;\n15:4.\nThe Gibeonites were permitted to live, but were attached as\nbondmen to the sanctuary, to perform all menial services. \u201cJoshua\nmade them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the\ncongregation, and for the altar of the Lord.\u201d These conditions they\ngratefully accepted, conscious that they had been at fault, and glad\nto purchase life on any terms. \u201cBehold, we are in thine hand,\u201d they\nsaid to Joshua; \u201cas it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us,\ndo.\u201d For centuries their descendants were connected with the service\nof the sanctuary.\nThe territory of the Gibeonites comprised four cities. The people\nwere not under the rule of a king, but were governed by elders, or\nsenators. Gibeon, the most important of their towns, \u201cwas a great\ncity, as one of the royal cities,\u201d \u201cand all the men thereof were mighty.\u201d\nIt is a striking evidence of the terror with which the Israelites had\ninspired the inhabitants of Canaan, that the people of such a city\n458 Patriarchs and Prophets\nshould have resorted to so humiliating an expedient to save their\nlives.\nBut it would have fared better with the Gibeonites had they dealt[507]\nhonestly with Israel. While their submission to Jehovah secured\nthe preservation of their lives, their deception brought them only\ndisgrace and servitude. God had made provision that all who would\nrenounce heathenism, and connect themselves with Israel, should\nshare the blessings of the covenant. They were included under\nthe term, \u201cthe stranger that sojourneth among you,\u201d and with few\nexceptions this class were to enjoy equal favors and privileges with\nIsrael. The Lord\u2019s direction was\u2014\n\u201cIf a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex\nhim. But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as\none born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself.\u201d Leviticus\n19:33, 34. Concerning the Passover and the offering of sacrifices\nit was commanded, \u201cOne ordinance shall be both for you of the\ncongregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you: ...\nas ye are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord.\u201d Numbers 15:15.\nSuch was the footing on which the Gibeonites might have been\nreceived, but for the deception to which they had resorted. It was\nno light humiliation to those citizens of a \u201croyal city,\u201d \u201call the men\nwhereof were mighty,\u201d to be made hewers of wood and drawers of\nwater throughout their generations. But they had adopted the garb of\npoverty for the purpose of deception, and it was fastened upon them\nas a badge of perpetual servitude. Thus through all their generations\ntheir servile condition would testify to God\u2019s hatred of falsehood.\nThe submission of Gibeon to the Israelites filled the kings of\nCanaan with dismay. Steps were at once taken for revenge upon\nthose who had made peace with the invaders. Under the leadership of\nAdonizedek, king of Jerusalem, five of the Canaanite kings entered\ninto a confederacy against Gibeon. Their movements were rapid.\nThe Gibeonites were unprepared for defense, and they sent a message\nto Joshua at Gilgal: \u201cSlack not thy hand from thy servants; come\nup to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the\nAmorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against\nus.\u201d The danger threatened not the people of Gibeon alone, but also\nIsrael. This city commanded the passes to central and southern\nPalestine, and it must be held if the country was to be conquered.\nLeague With the Gibeonites 459\nJoshua prepared to go at once to the relief of Gibeon. The\ninhabitants of the besieged city had feared that he would reject their [508]\nappeal, because of the fraud which they had practiced; but since they\nhad submitted to the control of Israel, and had accepted the worship\nof God, he felt himself under obligation to protect them. He did not\nthis time move without divine counsel, and the Lord encouraged\nhim in the undertaking. \u201cFear them not,\u201d was the divine message;\n\u201cfor I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of\nthem stand before thee.\u201d \u201cSo Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and\nall the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.\u201d\nBy marching all night he brought his forces before Gibeon in the\nmorning. Scarcely had the confederate princes mustered their armies\nabout the city when Joshua was upon them. The attack resulted in\nthe utter discomfiture of the assailants. The immense host fled before\nJoshua up the mountain pass to Beth-horon; and having gained the\nheight, they rushed down the precipitous descent upon the other side.\nHere a fierce hailstorm burst upon them. \u201cThe Lord cast down great\nstones from heaven: ... they were more which died with hailstones\nthan they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.\u201d\nWhile the Amorites were continuing their headlong flight, intent\non finding refuge in the mountain strongholds, Joshua, looking\ndown from the ridge above, saw that the day would be too short for\nthe accomplishment of his work. If not fully routed, their enemies\nwould again rally, and renew the struggle. \u201cThen spake Joshua to the\nLord, ... and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon\nGibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. And the sun stood\nstill, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves\nupon their enemies.... The sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and\nhasted not to go down about a whole day.\u201d\nBefore the evening fell, God\u2019s promise to Joshua had been ful-\nfilled. The entire host of the enemy had been given into his hand.\nLong were the events of that day to remain in the memory of Is-\nrael. \u201cThere was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah\nhearkened unto the voice of a man: for the Lord fought for Israel.\u201d\n\u201cThe sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of\nThine arrows they went, and at the shining of Thy glittering spear.\nThou didst march through the land in indignation, Thou didst thresh\n460 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe heathen in anger. Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy\npeople.\u201d Habakkuk 3:11-13.\nThe Spirit of God inspired Joshua\u2019s prayer, that evidence might[509]\nagain be given of the power of Israel\u2019s God. Hence the request\ndid not show presumption on the part of the great leader. Joshua\nhad received the promise that God would surely overthrow these\nenemies of Israel, yet he put forth as earnest effort as though success\ndepended upon the armies of Israel alone. He did all that human\nenergy could do, and then he cried in faith for divine aid. The secret\nof success is the union of divine power with human effort. Those\nwho achieve the greatest results are those who rely most implicitly\nupon the Almighty Arm. The man who commanded, \u201cSun, stand\nthou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon,\u201d is\nthe man who for hours lay prostrate upon the earth in prayer in the\ncamp of Gilgal. The men of prayer are the men of power.\nThis mighty miracle testifies that the creation is under the control\nof the Creator. Satan seeks to conceal from men the divine agency\nin the physical world\u2014to keep out of sight the unwearied working\nof the first great cause. In this miracle all who exalt nature above the\nGod of nature stand rebuked.\nAt His own will God summons the forces of nature to overthrow\nthe might of His enemies\u2014\u201cfire, and hail; snow, and vapor; stormy\nwind fulfilling His word.\u201d Psalm 148:8. When the heathen Amorites\nhad set themselves to resist His purposes, God interposed, casting\ndown \u201cgreat stones from heaven\u201d upon the enemies of Israel. We are\ntold of a greater battle to take place in the closing scenes of earth\u2019s\nhistory, when \u201cJehovah hath opened His armory, and hath brought\nforth the weapons of His indignation.\u201d Jeremiah 50:25. \u201cHast thou,\u201d\nhe inquires, \u201centered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou\nseen the treasures of the hail, which I have reserved against the time\nof trouble, against the day of battle and war?\u201d Job 38:22, 23.\nThe revelator describes the destruction that is to take place when\nthe \u201cgreat voice out of the temple of heaven\u201d announces, \u201cIt is done.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cThere fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone\nabout the weight of a talent.\u201d Revelation 16:17, 21.\nChapter 48\u2014The Division of Canaan [510]\nThis chapter is based on Joshua 10:40-43; 11; 14-22.\nThe victory at Beth-horon was speedily followed by the conquest\nof southern Canaan. \u201cJoshua smote all the country of the hills, and\nof the south, and of the vale.... And all these kings and their land did\nJoshua take at one time, because the Lord God of Israel fought for\nIsrael. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp\nat Gilgal.\u201d\nThe tribes of northern Palestine, terrified at the success which\nhad attended the armies of Israel, now entered into a league against\nthem. At the head of this confederacy was Jabin, king of Hazor, a\nterritory to the west of Lake Merom. \u201cAnd they went out, they and\nall their hosts with them.\u201d This army was much larger than any that\nthe Israelites had before encountered in Canaan\u2014\u201cmuch people,\neven as the sand that is upon the seashore in multitude, with horses\nand chariots very many. And when all these kings were met together,\nthey came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight\nagainst Israel.\u201d Again a message of encouragement was given to\nJoshua: \u201cBe not afraid because of them: for tomorrow about this\ntime will I deliver them up all slain before Israel.\u201d\nNear Lake Merom he fell upon the camp of the allies and utterly\nrouted their forces. \u201cThe Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel,\nwho smote them, and chased them ... until they left them none\nremaining.\u201d The chariots and horses that had been the pride and\nboast of the Canaanites were not to be appropriated by Israel. At the\ncommand of God the chariots were burned, and the horses lamed,\nand thus rendered unfit for use in battle. The Israelites were not to\nput their trust in chariots or horses, but \u201cin the name of the Lord\ntheir God.\u201d\nOne by one the cities were taken, and Hazor, the stronghold of\nthe confederacy, was burned. The war was continued for several [511]\n461\n462 Patriarchs and Prophets\nyears, but its close found Joshua master of Canaan. \u201cAnd the land\nhad rest from war.\u201d\nBut though the power of the Canaanites had been broken, they\nhad not been fully dispossessed. On the west the Philistines still\nheld a fertile plain along the seacoast, while north of them was the\nterritory of the Sidonians. Lebanon also was in the possession of\nthe latter people; and to the south, toward Egypt, the land was still\noccupied by the enemies of Israel.\nJoshua was not, however, to continue the war. There was another\nwork for the great leader to perform before he should relinquish\nthe command of Israel. The whole land, both the parts already\nconquered and that which was yet unsubdued, was to be apportioned\namong the tribes. And it was the duty of each tribe to fully subdue\nits own inheritance. If the people should prove faithful to God, He\nwould drive out their enemies from before them; and He promised\nto give them still greater possessions if they would but be true to His\ncovenant.\nTo Joshua, with Eleazar the high priest, and the heads of the\ntribes, the distribution of the land was committed, the location of\neach tribe being determined by lot. Moses himself had fixed the\nbounds of the country as it was to be divided among the tribes when\nthey should come in possession of Canaan, and had appointed a\nprince from each tribe to attend to the distribution. The tribe of\nLevi, being devoted to the sanctuary service, was not counted in this\nallotment; but forty-eight cities in different parts of the country were\nassigned the Levites as their inheritance.\nBefore the distribution of the land had been entered upon, Caleb,\naccompanied by the heads of his tribe, came forward with a special\nclaim. Except Joshua, Caleb was now the oldest man in Israel.\nCaleb and Joshua were the only ones among the spies who had\nbrought a good report of the Land of Promise, encouraging the\npeople to go up and possess it in the name of the Lord. Caleb now\nreminded Joshua of the promise then made, as the reward of his\nfaithfulness: \u201cThe land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine\ninheritance, and thy children\u2019s forever, because thou hast wholly\nfollowed the Lord.\u201d He therefore presented a request that Hebron be\ngiven him for a possession. Here had been for many years the home\nof Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and here, in the cave of Machpelah,\nDivision of Canaan 463\nthey were buried. Hebron was the seat of the dreaded Anakim, [512]\nwhose formidable appearance had so terrified the spies, and through\nthem destroyed the courage of all Israel. This, above all others, was\nthe place which Caleb, trusting in the strength of God, chose for his\ninheritance.\n\u201cBehold, the Lord hath kept me alive,\u201d he said, \u201cthese forty and\nfive years, even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses: ... and\nnow, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old. As yet I am\nas strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my\nstrength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go\nout, and to come in. Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof\nthe Lord spake in that day: for thou heardest in that day how the\nAnakim were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if\nso be the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them\nout, as the Lord said.\u201d This request was supported by the chief men\nof Judah. Caleb himself being the one appointed from this tribe to\napportion the land, he had chosen to unite these men with him in\npresenting his claim, that there might be no appearance of having\nemployed his authority for selfish advantage.\nHis claim was immediately granted. To none could the conquest\nof this giant stronghold be more safely entrusted. \u201cJoshua blessed\nhim, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an\ninheritance,\u201d \u201cbecause that he wholly followed the Lord God of\nIsrael.\u201d Caleb\u2019s faith now was just what it was when his testimony\nhad contradicted the evil report of the spies. He had believed God\u2019s\npromise that He would put His people in possession of Canaan,\nand in this he had followed the Lord fully. He had endured with\nhis people the long wandering in the wilderness, thus sharing the\ndisappointments and burdens of the guilty; yet he made no complaint\nof this, but exalted the mercy of God that had preserved him in the\nwilderness when his brethren were cut off. Amid all the hardships,\nperils, and plagues of the desert wanderings, and during the years\nof warfare since entering Canaan, the Lord had preserved him; and\nnow at upwards of fourscore his vigor was unabated. He did not ask\nfor himself a land already conquered, but the place which above all\nothers the spies had thought it impossible to subdue. By the help\nof God he would wrest his stronghold from the very giants whose\npower had staggered the faith of Israel. It was no desire for honor\n464 Patriarchs and Prophets\nor aggrandizement that prompted Caleb\u2019s request. The brave old\nwarrior was desirous of giving to the people an example that would[513]\nhonor God, and encourage the tribes fully to subdue the land which\ntheir fathers had deemed unconquerable.\nCaleb obtained the inheritance upon which his heart had been\nset for forty years, and, trusting in God to be with him, he \u201cdrove\nthence the three sons of Anak.\u201d Having thus secured a possession\nfor himself and his house, his zeal did not abate; he did not settle\ndown to enjoy his inheritance, but pushed on to further conquests\nfor the benefit of the nation and the glory of God.\nThe cowards and rebels had perished in the wilderness, but the\nrighteous spies ate of the grapes of Eschol. To each was given ac-\ncording to his faith. The unbelieving had seen their fears fulfilled.\nNotwithstanding God\u2019s promise, they had declared that it was im-\npossible to inherit Canaan, and they did not possess it. But those\nwho trusted in God, looking not so much to the difficulties to be\nencountered as to the strength of their Almighty Helper, entered the\ngoodly land. It was through faith that the ancient worthies \u201csubdued\nkingdoms, ... escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were\nmade strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of\nthe aliens.\u201d Hebrews 11:33, 34. \u201cThis is the victory that overcometh\nthe world, even our faith.\u201d 1 John 5:4.\nAnother claim concerning the division of the land revealed a\nspirit widely different from that of Caleb. It was presented by the\nchildren of Joseph, the tribe of Ephraim with the half tribe of Man-\nasseh. In consideration of their superior numbers, these tribes de-\nmanded a double portion of territory. The lot designated for them\nwas the richest in the land, including the fertile plain of Sharon; but\nmany of the principal towns in the valley were still in possession\nof the Canaanites, and the tribes shrank from the toil and danger\nof conquering their possessions, and desired an additional portion\nin territory already subdued. The tribe of Ephraim was one of the\nlargest in Israel, as well as the one to which Joshua himself belonged,\nand its members naturally regarded themselves as entitled to special\nconsideration. \u201cWhy hast thou given me but one lot and one portion\nto inherit,\u201d they said, \u201cseeing I am a great people?\u201d But no departure\nfrom strict justice could be won from the inflexible leader.\nDivision of Canaan 465\nHis answer was, \u201cIf thou be a great people, then get thee up to\nthe wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the [514]\nPerizzites and of the giants, if Mount Ephraim be too narrow for\nthee.\u201d\nTheir reply showed the real cause of complaint. They lacked\nfaith and courage to drive out the Canaanites. \u201cThe hill is not enough\nfor us,\u201d they said; \u201cand all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of\nthe valley have chariots of iron.\u201d\nThe power of the God of Israel had been pledged to His people,\nand had the Ephraimites possessed the courage and faith of Caleb,\nno enemy could have stood before them. Their evident desire to\nshun hardship and danger was firmly met by Joshua. \u201cThou art a\ngreat people, and hast great power,\u201d he said; \u201cthou shalt drive out\nthe Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be\nstrong.\u201d Thus their own arguments were turned against them. Being\na great people, as they claimed, they were fully able to make their\nown way, as did their brethren. With the help of God they need not\nfear the chariots of iron.\nHeretofore Gilgal had been the headquarters of the nation and\nthe seat of the tabernacle. But now the tabernacle was to be removed\nto the place chosen for its permanent location. This was Shiloh,\na little town in the lot of Ephraim. It was near the center of the\nland, and was easy of access to all the tribes. Here a portion of\ncountry had been thoroughly subdued, so that the worshipers would\nnot be molested. \u201cAnd the whole congregation of the children of\nIsrael assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of\nthe congregation there.\u201d The tribes that were still encamped when\nthe tabernacle was removed from Gilgal followed it, and pitched\nnear Shiloh. Here these tribes remained until they dispersed to their\npossessions.\nThe ark remained at Shiloh for three hundred years, until, be-\ncause of the sins of Eli\u2019s house, it fell into the hands of the Philistines,\nand Shiloh was ruined. The ark was never returned to the tabernacle\nhere, the sanctuary service was finally transferred to the temple at\nJerusalem, and Shiloh fell into insignificance. There are only ruins\nto mark the spot where it once stood. Long afterward its fate was\nmade use of as a warning to Jerusalem. \u201cGo ye now unto My place\nwhich was in Shiloh,\u201d the Lord declared by the prophet Jeremiah,\n466 Patriarchs and Prophets\n\u201cwhere I set My name at the first, and see what I did to it for the\nwickedness of My people Israel.... Therefore will I do unto this\nhouse, which is called by My name, wherein ye trust, and unto the\nplace which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to[515]\nShiloh.\u201d Jeremiah 7:12-14.\n\u201cWhen they had made an end of dividing the land,\u201d and all the\ntribes had been allotted their inheritance. Joshua presented his claim.\nTo him, as to Caleb, a special promise of inheritance had been given;\nyet he asked for no extensive province, but only a single city. \u201cThey\ngave him the city which he asked, ... and he built the city, and\ndwelt therein.\u201d The name given to the city was Timnath-serah, \u201cthe\nportion that remains\u201d\u2014a standing testimony to the noble character\nand unselfish spirit of the conqueror, who, instead of being the first\nto appropriate the spoils of conquest, deferred his claim until the\nhumblest of his people had been served.\nSix of the cities assigned to the Levites\u2014three on each side the\nJordan\u2014were appointed as cities of refuge, to which the manslayer\nmight flee for safety. The appointment of these cities had been\ncommanded by Moses, \u201cthat the slayer may flee thither, which kil-\nleth any person at unawares. And they shall be unto you cities for\nrefuge,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the manslayer die not, until he stand before\nthe congregation in judgment.\u201d Numbers 35:11, 12. This merciful\nprovision was rendered necessary by the ancient custom of private\nvengeance, by which the punishment of the murderer devolved on\nthe nearest relative or the next heir of the deceased. In cases where\nguilt was clearly evident it was not necessary to wait for a trial by\nthe magistrates. The avenger might pursue the criminal anywhere\nand put him to death wherever he should be found. The Lord did not\nsee fit to abolish this custom at that time, but He made provision to\nensure the safety of those who should take life unintentionally.\nThe cities of refuge were so distributed as to be within a half\nday\u2019s journey of every part of the land. The roads leading to them\nwere always to be kept in good repair; all along the way signposts\nwere to be erected bearing the word \u201cRefuge\u201d in plain, bold charac-\nters, that the fleeing one might not be delayed for a moment. Any\nperson\u2014Hebrew, stranger, or sojourner\u2014might avail himself of this\nprovision. But while the guiltless were not to be rashly slain, neither\nwere the guilty to escape punishment. The case of the fugitive was\nDivision of Canaan 467\nto be fairly tried by the proper authorities, and only when found\ninnocent of intentional murder was he to be protected in the city of\nrefuge. The guilty were given up to the avenger. And those who were [516]\nentitled to protection could receive it only on condition of remaining\nwithin the appointed refuge. Should one wander away beyond the\nprescribed limits, and be found by the avenger of blood, his life\nwould pay the penalty of his disregard of the Lord\u2019s provision. At\nthe death of the high priest, however, all who had sought shelter in\nthe cities of refuge were at liberty to return to their possessions.\nIn a trial for murder the accused was not to be condemned on\nthe testimony of one witness, even though circumstantial evidence\nmight be strong against him. The Lord\u2019s direction was, \u201cWhoso\nkilleth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth\nof witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person\nto cause him to die.\u201d Numbers 35:30. It was Christ who gave to\nMoses these directions for Israel; and when personally with His\ndisciples on earth, as He taught them how to treat the erring, the\nGreat Teacher repeated the lesson that one man\u2019s testimony is not\nto acquit or condemn. One man\u2019s views and opinions are not to\nsettle disputed questions. In all these matters two or more are to be\nassociated, and together they are to bear the responsibility, \u201cthat in\nthe mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.\u201d\nMatthew 18:16.\nIf the one tried for murder were proved guilty, no atonement or\nransom could rescue him. \u201cWhoso sheddeth man\u2019s blood, by man\nshall his blood be shed.\u201d Genesis 9:6. \u201cYe shall take no satisfaction\nfor the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be\nsurely put to death.\u201d \u201cThou shalt take him from Mine altar, that he\nmay die,\u201d was the command of God; \u201cthe land cannot be cleansed\nof the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed\nit.\u201d Numbers 35:31, 33; Exodus 21:14. The safety and purity of\nthe nation demanded that the sin of murder be severely punished.\nHuman life, which God alone could give, must be sacredly guarded.\nThe cities of refuge appointed for God\u2019s ancient people were a\nsymbol of the refuge provided in Christ. The same merciful Saviour\nwho appointed those temporal cities of refuge has by the shedding\nof His own blood provided for the transgressors of God\u2019s law a sure\nretreat, into which they may flee for safety from the second death.\n468 Patriarchs and Prophets\nNo power can take out of His hands the souls that go to Him for\npardon. \u201cThere is therefore now no condemnation to them which[517]\nare in Christ Jesus.\u201d \u201cWho is he that condemneth? It is Christ that\ndied, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of\nGod, who also maketh intercession for us;\u201d that \u201cwe might have a\nstrong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the\nhope set before us.\u201d Romans 8:1, 34; Hebrews 6:18.\nHe who fled to the city of refuge could make no delay. Family\nand employment were left behind. There was no time to say farewell\nto loved ones. His life was at stake, and every other interest must be\nsacrificed to the one purpose\u2014to reach the place of safety. Weariness\nwas forgotten, difficulties were unheeded. The fugitive dared not for\none moment slacken his pace until he was within the wall of the city.\nThe sinner is exposed to eternal death, until he finds a hiding\nplace in Christ; and as loitering and carelessness might rob the\nfugitive of his only chance for life, so delays and indifference may\nprove the ruin of the soul. Satan, the great adversary, is on the track\nof every transgressor of God\u2019s holy law, and he who is not sensible of\nhis danger, and does not earnestly seek shelter in the eternal refuge,\nwill fall a prey to the destroyer.\nThe prisoner who at any time went outside the city of refuge was\nabandoned to the avenger of blood. Thus the people were taught\nto adhere to the methods which infinite wisdom appointed for their\nsecurity. Even so, it is not enough that the sinner believe in Christ\nfor the pardon of sin; he must, by faith and obedience, abide in Him.\n\u201cFor if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge\nof the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain\nfearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall\ndevour the adversaries.\u201d Hebrews 10:26, 27.\nTwo of the tribes of Israel, Gad and Reuben, with half the tribe of\nManasseh, had received their inheritance before crossing the Jordan.\nTo a pastoral people, the wide upland plains and rich forests of\nGilead and Bashan, offering extensive grazing land for their flocks\nand herds, had attractions which were not to be found in Canaan\nitself, and the two and a half tribes, desiring to settle here, had\npledged themselves to furnish their proportion of armed men to\naccompany their brethren across the Jordan and to share their battles\ntill they also should enter upon their inheritance. The obligation had\nDivision of Canaan 469\nbeen faithfully discharged. When the ten tribes entered Canaan forty [518]\nthousand of \u201cthe children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and\nhalf the tribe of Manasseh ... prepared for war passed over before\nthe Lord unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.\u201d Joshua 4:12, 13. For\nyears they had fought bravely by the side of their brethren. Now\nthe time had come for them to get unto the land of their possession.\nAs they had united with their brethren in the conflicts, so they had\nshared the spoils; and they returned \u201cwith much riches ... and with\nvery much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and\nwith iron, and with very much raiment,\u201d all of which they were to\nshare with those who had remained with the families and flocks.\nThey were now to dwell at a distance from the sanctuary of the\nLord, and it was with an anxious heart that Joshua witnessed their\ndeparture, knowing how strong would be the temptations, in their\nisolated and wandering life, to fall into the customs of the heathen\ntribes that dwelt upon their borders.\nWhile the minds of Joshua and other leaders were still oppressed\nwith anxious forebodings, strange tidings reached them. Beside the\nJordan, near the place of Israel\u2019s miraculous passage of the river, the\ntwo and a half tribes had erected a great altar, similar to the altar of\nburnt offering at Shiloh. The law of God prohibited, on pain of death,\nthe establishment of another worship than that at the sanctuary. If\nsuch was the object of this altar, it would, if permitted to remain,\nlead the people away from the true faith.\nThe representatives of the people assembled at Shiloh, and in the\nheat of their excitement and indignation proposed to make war at\nonce upon the offenders. Through the influence of the more cautious,\nhowever, it was decided to send first a delegation to obtain from the\ntwo and a half tribes an explanation of their conduct. Ten princes,\none from each tribe, were chosen. At their head was Phinehas, who\nhad distinguished himself by his zeal in the matter of Peor.\nThe two and a half tribes had been at fault in entering, without\nexplanation, upon an act open to such grave suspicions. The am-\nbassadors, taking it for granted that their brethren were guilty, met\nthem with sharp rebuke. They accused them of rebelling against\nthe Lord, and bade them remember how judgments had been visited\nupon Israel for joining themselves to Baalpeor. In behalf of all Israel,\nPhinehas stated to the children of Gad and Reuben that if they were [519]\n470 Patriarchs and Prophets\nunwilling to abide in that land without an altar for sacrifice, they\nwould be welcome to a share in the possessions and privileges of\ntheir brethren on the other side.\nIn reply the accused explained that their altar was not intended\nfor sacrifice, but simply as a witness that, although separated by the\nriver, they were of the same faith as their brethren in Canaan. They\nhad feared that in future years their children might be excluded from\nthe tabernacle, as having no part in Israel. Then this altar, erected\nafter the pattern of the altar of the Lord at Shiloh, would be a witness\nthat its builders were also worshipers of the living God.\nWith great joy the ambassadors accepted this explanation, and\nimmediately carried back the tidings to those who sent them. All\nthoughts of war were dismissed, and the people united in rejoicing,\nand praise to God.\nThe children of Gad and Reuben now placed upon their altar an\ninscription pointing out the purpose for which it was erected; and\nthey said, \u201cIt shall be a witness between us that Jehovah is God.\u201d\nThus they endeavored to prevent future misapprehension and to\nremove what might be a cause of temptation.\nHow often serious difficulties arise from a simple misunderstand-\ning, even among those who are actuated by the worthiest motives;\nand without the exercise of courtesy and forbearance, what serious\nand even fatal results may follow. The ten tribes remembered how,\nin Achan\u2019s case, God had rebuked the lack of vigilance to discover\nthe sins existing among them. Now they resolved to act promptly\nand earnestly; but in seeking to shun their first error, they had gone\nto the opposite extreme. Instead of making courteous inquiry to\nlearn the facts in the case, they had met their brethren with censure\nand condemnation. Had the men of Gad and Reuben retorted in\nthe same spirit, war would have been the result. While it is impor-\ntant on the one hand that laxness in dealing with sin be avoided,\nit is equally important on the other to shun harsh judgment and\ngroundless suspicion.\nWhile very sensitive to the least blame in regard to their own\ncourse, many are too severe in dealing with those whom they suppose\nto be in error. No one was ever reclaimed from a wrong position\nby censure and reproach; but many are thus driven further from the\nright path and led to harden their hearts against conviction. A spirit[520]\nDivision of Canaan 471\nof kindness, a courteous, forbearing deportment may save the erring\nand hide a multitude of sins.\nThe wisdom displayed by the Reubenites and their companions\nis worthy of imitation. While honestly seeking to promote the cause\nof true religion, they were misjudged and severely censured; yet they\nmanifested no resentment. They listened with courtesy and patience\nto the charges of their brethren before attempting to make their\ndefense, and then fully explained their motives and showed their\ninnocence. Thus the difficulty which had threatened such serious\nconsequences was amicably settled.\nEven under false accusation those who are in the right can afford\nto be calm and considerate. God is acquainted with all that is mis-\nunderstood and misinterpreted by men, and we can safely leave our\ncase in His hands. He will as surely vindicate the cause of those who\nput their trust in Him as He searched out the guilt of Achan. Those\nwho are actuated by the spirit of Christ will possess that charity\nwhich suffers long and is kind.\nIt is the will of God that union and brotherly love should exist\namong His people. The prayer of Christ just before His crucifixion\nwas that His disciples might be one as He is one with the Father, that\nthe world might believe that God had sent Him. This most touching\nand wonderful prayer reaches down the ages, even to our day; for His\nwords were, \u201cNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also which\nshall believe on Me through their word.\u201d John 17:20. While we are\nnot to sacrifice one principle of truth, it should be our constant aim\nto reach this state of unity. This is the evidence of our discipleship.\nSaid Jesus, \u201cBy this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye\nhave love one to another.\u201d John 13:35. The apostle Peter exhorts the\nchurch, \u201cBe ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another;\nlove as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: not rendering evil for evil,\nor railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are\nthereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.\u201d 1 Peter 3:8, 9.\nChapter 49\u2014The Last Words of Joshua[521]\nThis chapter is based on Joshua 23 and 24.\nThe wars and conquest ended, Joshua had withdrawn to the\npeaceful retirement of his home at Timnath-serah. \u201cAnd it came to\npass, a long time after that the Lord had given rest unto Israel from\nall their enemies round about, that Joshua ... called for all Israel,\nand for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for\ntheir officers.\u201d\nSome years had passed since the people had settled in their\npossessions, and already could be seen cropping out the same evils\nthat had heretofore brought judgments upon Israel. As Joshua felt\nthe infirmities of age stealing upon him, and realized that his work\nmust soon close, he was filled with anxiety for the future of his\npeople. It was with more than a father\u2019s interest that he addressed\nthem, as they gathered once more about their aged chief. \u201cYe have\nseen,\u201d he said, \u201call that the Lord your God hath done unto all these\nnations because of you; for the Lord your God is He that hath fought\nfor you.\u201d Although the Canaanites had been subdued, they still\npossessed a considerable portion of the land promised to Israel, and\nJoshua exhorted his people not to settle down at ease and forget the\nLord\u2019s command to utterly dispossess these idolatrous nations.\nThe people in general were slow to complete the work of driving\nout the heathen. The tribes had dispersed to their possessions, the\narmy had disbanded, and it was looked upon as a difficult and doubt-\nful undertaking to renew the war. But Joshua declared: \u201cThe Lord\nyour God, He shall expel them from before you, and drive them\nfrom out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the Lord\nyour God hath promised unto you. Be ye therefore very courageous\nto keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses,\nthat ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left.\u201d\nJoshua appealed to the people themselves as witnesses that, so[522]\nfar as they had complied with the conditions, God had faithfully\n472\nLast Words of Joshua 473\nfulfilled His promises to them. \u201cYe know in all your hearts and in\nall your souls,\u201d he said, \u201cthat not one thing hath failed of all the\ngood things which the Lord your God spake concerning you; all are\ncome to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.\u201d He\ndeclared to them that as the Lord had fulfilled His promises, so He\nwould fulfill His threatenings. \u201cIt shall come to pass, that as all good\nthings are come upon you, which the Lord your God promised you;\nso shall the Lord bring upon you all evil things.... When ye have\ntransgressed the covenant of the Lord, ... then shall the anger of the\nLord be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off\nthe good land which He hath given unto you.\u201d\nSatan deceives many with the plausible theory that God\u2019s love\nfor His people is so great that He will excuse sin in them; he rep-\nresents that while the threatenings of God\u2019s word are to serve a\ncertain purpose in His moral government, they are never to be lit-\nerally fulfilled. But in all His dealings with His creatures God has\nmaintained the principles of righteousness by revealing sin in its\ntrue character\u2014by demonstrating that its sure result is misery and\ndeath. The unconditional pardon of sin never has been, and never\nwill be. Such pardon would show the abandonment of the principles\nof righteousness, which are the very foundation of the government\nof God. It would fill the unfallen universe with consternation. God\nhas faithfully pointed out the results of sin, and if these warnings\nwere not true, how could we be sure that His promises would be\nfulfilled? That so-called benevolence which would set aside justice\nis not benevolence but weakness.\nGod is the life-giver. From the beginning all His laws were\nordained to life. But sin broke in upon the order that God had\nestablished, and discord followed. So long as sin exists, suffering\nand death are inevitable. It is only because the Redeemer has borne\nthe curse of sin in our behalf that man can hope to escape, in his\nown person, its dire results.\nBefore the death of Joshua the heads and representatives of the\ntribes, obedient to his summons, again assembled at Shechem. No\nspot in all the land possessed so many sacred associations, carrying\ntheir minds back to God\u2019s covenant with Abraham and Jacob, and re-\ncalling also their own solemn vows upon their entrance into Canaan. [523]\nHere were the mountains Ebal and Gerizim, the silent witnesses of\n474 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthose vows which now, in the presence of their dying leader, they\nhad assembled to renew. On every side were evidences of what God\nhad wrought for them; how He had given them a land for which\nthey did not labor, and cities which they built not, vineyards and\noliveyards which they planted not. Joshua reviewed once more the\nhistory of Israel, recounting the wonderful works of God, that all\nmight have a sense of His love and mercy and might serve Him \u201cin\nsincerity and in truth.\u201d\nBy Joshua\u2019s direction the ark had been brought from Shiloh.\nThe occasion was one of great solemnity, and this symbol of God\u2019s\npresence would deepen the impression he wished to make upon\nthe people. After presenting the goodness of God toward Israel, he\ncalled upon them, in the name of Jehovah, to choose whom they\nwould serve. The worship of idols was still to some extent secretly\npracticed, and Joshua endeavored now to bring them to a decision\nthat should banish this sin from Israel. \u201cIf it seem evil unto you to\nserve Jehovah,\u201d he said, \u201cchoose you this day whom ye will serve.\u201d\nJoshua desired to lead them to serve God, not by compulsion, but\nwillingly. Love to God is the very foundation of religion. To engage\nin His service merely from hope of reward or fear of punishment\nwould avail nothing. Open apostasy would not be more offensive to\nGod than hypocrisy and mere formal worship.\nThe aged leader urged the people to consider, in all its bearings,\nwhat he had set before them, and to decide if they really desired to\nlive as did the degraded idolatrous nations around them. If it seemed\nevil to them to serve Jehovah, the source of power, the fountain\nof blessing, let them that day choose whom they would serve\u2014\n\u201cthe gods which your fathers served,\u201d from whom Abraham was\ncalled out, \u201cor the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell.\u201d\nThese last words were a keen rebuke to Israel. The gods of the\nAmorites had not been able to protect their worshipers. Because of\ntheir abominable and debasing sins, that wicked nation had been\ndestroyed, and the good land which they once possessed had been\ngiven to God\u2019s people. What folly for Israel to choose the deities for\nwhose worship the Amorites had been destroyed! \u201cAs for me and\nmy house,\u201d said Joshua, \u201cwe will serve Jehovah.\u201d The same holy\nzeal that inspired the leader\u2019s heart was communicated to the people.\nHis appeals called forth the unhesitating response, \u201cGod forbid that[524]\nLast Words of Joshua 475\nwe should forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods.\u201d\n\u201cYe cannot serve the Lord,\u201d said Joshua: \u201cfor He is a holy God;\n... He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.\u201d Before\nthere could be any permanent reformation the people must be led to\nfeel their utter inability in themselves to render obedience to God.\nThey had broken His law, it condemned them as transgressors, and it\nprovided no way of escape. While they trusted in their own strength\nand righteousness, it was impossible for them to secure the pardon\nof their sins; they could not meet the claims of God\u2019s perfect law,\nand it was in vain that they pledged themselves to serve God. It\nwas only by faith in Christ that they could secure pardon of sin and\nreceive strength to obey God\u2019s law. They must cease to rely upon\ntheir own efforts for salvation, they must trust wholly in the merits\nof the promised Saviour, if they would be accepted of God.\nJoshua endeavored to lead his hearers to weigh well their words,\nand refrain from vows which they would be unprepared to fulfill.\nWith deep earnestness they repeated the declaration: \u201cNay; but we\nwill serve the Lord.\u201d Solemnly consenting to the witness against\nthemselves that they had chosen Jehovah, they once more reiterated\ntheir pledge of loyalty: \u201cThe Lord our God will we serve, and His\nvoice will we obey.\n\u201cSo Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set\nthem a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.\u201d Having written an\naccount of this solemn transaction, he placed it, with the book of\nthe law, in the side of the ark. And he set up a pillar as a memorial,\nsaying, \u201cBehold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath\nheard all the words of the Lord which He spake unto us; it shall be\ntherefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God. So Joshua let\nthe people depart, every man unto his inheritance.\u201d\nJoshua\u2019s work for Israel was done. He had \u201cwholly followed\nthe Lord;\u201d and in the book of God he is written, \u201cThe servant of\nJehovah.\u201d The noblest testimony to his character as a public leader\nis the history of the generation that had enjoyed his labors: \u201cIsrael\nserved the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders\nthat overlived Joshua.\u201d\nChapter 50\u2014Tithes and Offerings[525]\nIn the Hebrew economy one tenth of the income of the people\nwas set apart to support the public worship of God. Thus Moses\ndeclared to Israel: \u201cAll the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of\nthe land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord\u2019s: it is holy unto the\nLord.\u201d \u201cAnd concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, ... the\ntenth shall be holy unto the Lord.\u201d Leviticus 27:30, 32.\nBut the tithing system did not originate with the Hebrews. From\nthe earliest times the Lord claimed a tithe as His, and this claim was\nrecognized and honored. Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek, the\npriest of the most high God. Genesis 14:20. Jacob, when at Bethel,\nan exile and a wanderer, promised the Lord, \u201cOf all that Thou shalt\ngive me I will surely give the tenth unto Thee.\u201d Genesis 28:22. As\nthe Israelites were about to be established as a nation, the law of\ntithing was reaffirmed as one of the divinely ordained statutes upon\nobedience to which their prosperity depended.\nThe system of tithes and offerings was intended to impress the\nminds of men with a great truth\u2014that God is the source of every\nblessing to His creatures, and that to Him man\u2019s gratitude is due for\nthe good gifts of His providence.\n\u201cHe giveth to all life, and breath, and all things.\u201d Acts 17:25.\nThe Lord declares, \u201cEvery beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle\nupon a thousand hills.\u201d Psalm 50:10. \u201cThe silver is Mine, and the\ngold is Mine.\u201d Haggai 2:8. And it is God who gives men power\nto get wealth. Deuteronomy 8:18. As an acknowledgment that\nall things came from Him, the Lord directed that a portion of His\nbounty should be returned to Him in gifts and offerings to sustain\nHis worship.\n\u201cThe tithe ... is the Lord\u2019s.\u201d Here the same form of expression\nis employed as in the law of the Sabbath. \u201cThe seventh day is\nthe Sabbath of the Lord thy God.\u201d Exodus 20:10. God reserved to[526]\nHimself a specified portion of man\u2019s time and of his means, and no\nman could, without guilt, appropriate either for his own interests.\n476\nTithes and Offerings 477\nThe tithe was to be exclusively devoted to the use of the Levites,\nthe tribe that had been set apart for the service of the sanctuary. But\nthis was by no means the limit of the contributions for religious\npurposes. The tabernacle, as afterward the temple, was erected\nwholly by freewill offerings; and to provide for necessary repairs\nand other expenses, Moses directed that as often as the people were\nnumbered, each should contribute a half shekel for \u201cthe service of\nthe tabernacle.\u201d In the time of Nehemiah a contribution was made\nyearly for this purpose. See Exodus 30:12-16; 2 Kings 12:4, 5; 2\nChronicles 24:4-13; Nehemiah 10:32, 33. From time to time sin\nofferings and thank offerings were brought to God. These were\npresented in great numbers at the annual feasts. And the most liberal\nprovision was made for the poor.\nEven before the tithe could be reserved there had been an ac-\nknowledgment of the claims of God. The first that ripened of ev-\nery product of the land was consecrated to Him. The first of the\nwool when the sheep were shorn, of the grain when the wheat was\nthreshed, the first of the oil and the wine, was set apart for God.\nSo also were the first-born of all animals; and a redemption price\nwas paid for the first-born son. The first fruits were to be presented\nbefore the Lord at the sanctuary, and were then devoted to the use of\nthe priests.\nThus the people were constantly reminded that God was the\ntrue proprietor of their fields, their flocks, and their herds; that He\nsent them sunshine and rain for their seedtime and harvest, and that\neverything they possessed was of His creation, and He had made\nthem stewards of His goods.\nAs the men of Israel, laden with the first fruits of field and orchard\nand vineyard, gathered at the tabernacle, there was made a public\nacknowledgment of God\u2019s goodness. When the priest accepted the\ngift, the offerer, speaking as in the presence of Jehovah, said, \u201cA\nSyrian ready to perish was my father;\u201d and he described the sojourn\nin Egypt and the affliction from which God had delivered Israel\n\u201cwith an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with\nsigns, and with wonders.\u201d And he said, \u201cHe hath brought us into\nthis place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with [527]\nmilk and honey. And now, behold, I have brought the first fruits of\n478 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe land, which Thou, Jehovah, hast given me.\u201d Deuteronomy 26:5,\n8-11.\nThe contributions required of the Hebrews for religious and\ncharitable purposes amounted to fully one fourth of their income. So\nheavy a tax upon the resources of the people might be expected to\nreduce them to poverty; but, on the contrary, the faithful observance\nof these regulations was one of the conditions of their prosperity.\nOn condition of their obedience God made them this promise: \u201cI\nwill rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the\nfruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before\nthe time in the field.... And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye\nshall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d Malachi 3:11.\nA striking illustration of the results of selfishly withholding even\nfreewill offerings from the cause of God was given in the days of\nthe prophet Haggai. After their return from the captivity in Babylon,\nthe Jews undertook to rebuild the temple of the Lord; but meeting\ndetermined opposition from their enemies, they discontinued the\nwork; and a severe drought, by which they were reduced to actual\nwant, convinced them that it was impossible to complete the building\nof the temple. \u201cThe time is not come,\u201d they said, \u201cthe time that the\nLord\u2019s house should be built.\u201d But a message was sent them by the\nLord\u2019s prophet: \u201cIs it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled\nhouses, and this house lie waste? Now therefore thus saith the Lord\nof hosts; Consider your ways. Ye have sown much, and bring in\nlittle; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled\nwith drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth\nwages, earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.\u201d Haggai 1:2-6.\nAnd then the reason is given: \u201cYe looked for much, and, lo, it came\nto little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why?\nsaith the Lord of hosts. Because of Mine house that is waste, and\nye run every man unto his own house. Therefore the heaven over\nyou is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit. And\nI called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and\nupon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon\nthat which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle,\nand upon all the labor of the hands.\u201d Verses 9-11. \u201cWhen one came\nto a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to[528]\nthe pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were\nTithes and Offerings 479\nbut twenty. I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail\nin all the labors of your hands.\u201d Haggai 2:16, 17.\nRoused by these warnings, the people set themselves to build the\nhouse of God. Then the word of the Lord came to them: \u201cConsider\nnow from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of\nthe ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the Lord\u2019s\ntemple was laid, ... from this day will I bless you.\u201d Verses 18, 19.\nSays the wise man, \u201cThere is that scattereth, and yet increaseth;\nand there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to\npoverty.\u201d Proverbs 11:24. And the same lesson is taught in the New\nTestament by the apostle Paul: \u201cHe which soweth sparingly shall\nreap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also\nbountifully.\u201d \u201cGod is able to make all grace abound toward you; that\nye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every\ngood work.\u201d 2 Corinthians 9:6, 8.\nGod intended that His people Israel should be light bearers to\nall the inhabitants of the earth. In maintaining His public worship\nthey were bearing a testimony to the existence and sovereignty of\nthe living God. And this worship it was their privilege to sustain,\nas an expression of their loyalty and their love to Him. The Lord\nhas ordained that the diffusion of light and truth in the earth shall be\ndependent upon the efforts and offerings of those who are partakers\nof the heavenly gift. He might have made angels the ambassadors of\nHis truth; He might have made known His will, as He proclaimed\nthe law from Sinai, with His own voice; but in His infinite love\nand wisdom He called men to become colaborers with Himself, by\nchoosing them to do this work.\nIn the days of Israel the tithe and freewill offerings were needed\nto maintain the ordinances of divine service. Should the people\nof God give less in this age? The principle laid down by Christ is\nthat our offerings to God should be in proportion to the light and\nprivileges enjoyed. \u201cUnto whomsoever much is given, of him shall\nbe much required.\u201d Luke 12:48. Said the Saviour to His disciples as\nHe sent them forth, \u201cFreely ye have received, freely give.\u201d Matthew\n10:8. As our blessings and privileges are increased\u2014above all, as [529]\nwe have before us the unparalleled sacrifice of the glorious Son of\nGod\u2014should not our gratitude find expression in more abundant\ngifts to extend to others the message of salvation? The work of the\n480 Patriarchs and Prophets\ngospel, as it widens, requires greater provision to sustain it than was\ncalled for anciently; and this makes the law of tithes and offerings\nof even more urgent necessity now than under the Hebrew economy.\nIf His people were liberally to sustain His cause by their voluntary\ngifts, instead of resorting to unchristian and unhallowed methods to\nfill the treasury, God would be honored, and many more souls would\nbe won to Christ.\nThe plan of Moses to raise means for the building of the taber-\nnacle was highly successful. No urging was necessary. Nor did he\nemploy any of the devices to which churches in our day so often\nresort. He made no grand feast. He did not invite the people to\nscenes of gaiety, dancing, and general amusement; neither did he\ninstitute lotteries, nor anything of this profane order, to obtain means\nto erect the tabernacle for God. The Lord directed Moses to invite\nthe children of Israel to bring their offerings. He was to accept gifts\nfrom everyone that gave willingly, from his heart. And the offer-\nings came in so great abundance that Moses bade the people cease\nbringing, for they had supplied more than could be used.\nGod has made men His stewards. The property which He has\nplaced in their hands is the means that He has provided for the spread\nof the gospel. To those who prove themselves faithful stewards He\nwill commit greater trusts. Saith the Lord, \u201cThem that honor Me I\nwill honor.\u201d 1 Samuel 2:30. \u201cGod loveth a cheerful giver,\u201d and when\nHis people, with grateful hearts, bring their gifts and offerings to\nHim, \u201cnot grudgingly, or of necessity,\u201d His blessing will attend them,\nas He has promised. \u201cBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse,\nthat there may be meat in Mine house, and prove Me now herewith,\nsaith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven,\nand pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to\nreceive it.\u201d Malachi 3:10.\nChapter 51\u2014God\u2019s Care for the Poor [530]\nTo promote the assembling of the people for religious service,\nas well as to provide for the poor, a second tithe of all the increase\nwas required. Concerning the first tithe, the Lord had declared, \u201cI\nhave given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel.\u201d Numbers\n18:21. But in regard to the second He commanded, \u201cThou shalt\neat before the Lord thy God, in the place which He shall choose\nto place His name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of\nthine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou\nmayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always.\u201d Deuteronomy 14:23,\n29; 16:11-14. This tithe, or its equivalent in money, they were for\ntwo years to bring to the place where the sanctuary was established.\nAfter presenting a thank offering to God, and a specified portion\nto the priest, the offerers were to use the remainder for a religious\nfeast, in which the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow\nshould participate. Thus provision was made for the thank offerings\nand feasts at the yearly festivals, and the people were drawn to the\nsociety of the priests and Levites, that they might receive instruction\nand encouragement in the service of God.\nEvery third year, however, this second tithe was to be used at\nhome, in entertaining the Levite and the poor, as Moses said, \u201cThat\nthey may eat within thy gates, and be filled.\u201d Deuteronomy 26:12.\nThis tithe would provide a fund for the uses of charity and hospitality.\nAnd further provision was made for the poor. There is nothing,\nafter their recognition of the claims of God, that more distinguishes\nthe laws given by Moses than the liberal, tender, and hospitable spirit\nenjoined toward the poor. Although God had promised greatly to\nbless His people, it was not His design that poverty should be wholly\nunknown among them. He declared that the poor should never cease\nout of the land. There would ever be those among His people who\nwould call into exercise their sympathy, tenderness, and benevolence. [531]\nThen, as now, persons were subject to misfortune, sickness, and loss\nof property; yet so long as they followed the instruction given by\n481\n482 Patriarchs and Prophets\nGod, there were no beggars among them, neither any who suffered\nfor food.\nThe law of God gave the poor a right to a certain portion of the\nproduce of the soil. When hungry, a man was at liberty to go to his\nneighbor\u2019s field or orchard or vineyard, and eat of the grain or fruit\nto satisfy his hunger. It was in accordance with this permission that\nthe disciples of Jesus plucked and ate of the standing grain as they\npassed through a field upon the Sabbath day.\nAll the gleanings of harvest field, orchard, and vineyard, be-\nlonged to the poor. \u201cWhen thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy\nfield,\u201d said Moses, \u201cand hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt\nnot go again to fetch it.... When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou\nshalt not go over the boughs again.... When thou gatherest the\ngrapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it shall\nbe for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. And thou\nshalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 24:19-22; Leviticus 19:9, 10.\nEvery seventh year special provision was made for the poor. The\nsabbatical year, as it was called, began at the end of the harvest. At\nthe seedtime, which followed the ingathering, the people were not to\nsow; they should not dress the vineyard in the spring; and they must\nexpect neither harvest nor vintage. Of that which the land produced\nspontaneously they might eat while fresh, but they were not to lay\nup any portion of it in their storehouses. The yield of this year was\nto be free for the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and even\nfor the creatures of the field. Exodus 23:10, 11; Leviticus 25:5.\nBut if the land ordinarily produced only enough to supply the\nwants of the people, how were they to subsist during the year when\nno crops were gathered? For this the promise of God made ample\nprovision. \u201cI will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year,\u201d\nHe said, \u201cand it shall bring forth fruit for three years. And ye shall\nsow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until\nher fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.\u201d Leviticus 25:21, 22.\nThe observance of the sabbatical year was to be a benefit to both[532]\nthe land and the people. The soil, lying untilled for one season,\nwould afterward produce more plentifully. The people were released\nfrom the pressing labors of the field; and while there were various\nbranches of work that could be followed during this time, all enjoyed\nGod\u2019s Care for the Poor 483\ngreater leisure, which afforded opportunity for the restoration of their\nphysical powers for the exertions of the following years. They had\nmore time for meditation and prayer, for acquainting themselves with\nthe teachings and requirements of the Lord, and for the instruction\nof their households.\nIn the sabbatical year the Hebrew slaves were to be set at liberty,\nand they were not to be sent away portionless. The Lord\u2019s direction\nwas: \u201cWhen thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not\nlet him go away empty. Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of\nthy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that\nwherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto\nhim.\u201d Deuteronomy 15:13, 14.\nThe hire of a laborer was to be promptly paid: \u201cThou shalt not\noppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy\nbrethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land: ... at his day thou\nshalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he\nis poor, and setteth his heart upon it.\u201d Deuteronomy 24:14, 15.\nSpecial directions were also given concerning the treatment of\nfugitives from service: \u201cThou shalt not deliver unto his master the\nservant which is escaped from his master unto thee. He shall dwell\nwith thee, even among you, in that place which he shall choose in\none of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress\nhim.\u201d Deuteronomy 23:15, 16.\nTo the poor, the seventh year was a year of release from debt.\nThe Hebrews were enjoined at all times to assist their needy brethren\nby lending them money without interest. To take usury from a poor\nman was expressly forbidden: \u201cIf thy brother be waxen poor, and\nfallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though\nhe be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee. Take\nthou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother\nmay live with thee. Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury,\nnor lend him thy victuals for increase.\u201d Leviticus 25:35-37. If the\ndebt remained unpaid until the year of release, the principal itself [533]\ncould not be recovered. The people were expressly warned against\nwithholding from their brethren needed assistance on account of\nthis: \u201cIf there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren, ...\nthou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor\nbrother.... Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart,\n484 Patriarchs and Prophets\nsaying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine\neye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and\nhe cry unto the Lord against thee, and it be sin unto thee.\u201d \u201cThe poor\nshall never cease out of the land; therefore I command thee, saying,\nThou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and\nto thy needy, in thy land,\u201d \u201cand shalt surely lend him sufficient for\nhis need, in that which he wanteth.\u201d Deuteronomy 15:7-9, 11, 8.\nNone need fear that their liberality would bring them to want.\nObedience to God\u2019s commandments would surely result in prosper-\nity. \u201cThou shalt lend unto many nations,\u201d He said, \u201cbut thou shalt\nnot borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall\nnot reign over thee.\u201d Deuteronomy 15:6.\nAfter \u201cseven sabbaths of years,\u201d \u201cseven times seven years,\u201d came\nthat great year of release\u2014the jubilee. \u201cThen shalt thou cause the\ntrumpet of the jubilee to sound ... throughout all your land. And\nye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all\nthe land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto\nyou; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall\nreturn every man unto his family.\u201d Leviticus 25:9, 10.\n\u201cOn the tenth day of the seventh month, in the Day of Atone-\nment,\u201d the trumpet of the jubilee was sounded. Throughout the land,\nwherever the Jewish people dwelt, the sound was heard, calling upon\nall the children of Jacob to welcome the year of release. On the great\nDay of Atonement satisfaction was made for the sins of Israel, and\nwith gladness of heart the people would welcome the jubilee.\nAs in the sabbatical year, the land was not to be sown or reaped,\nand all that it produced was to be regarded as the rightful property of\nthe poor. Certain classes of Hebrew slaves\u2014all who did not receive\ntheir liberty in the sabbatical year\u2014were now set free. But that\nwhich especially distinguished the year of jubilee was the reversion\nof all landed property to the family of the original possessor. By the[534]\nspecial direction of God the land had been divided by lot. After the\ndivision was made no one was at liberty to trade his estate. Neither\nwas he to sell his land unless poverty compelled him to do so, and\nthen, whenever he or any of his kindred might desire to redeem it,\nthe purchaser must not refuse to sell it; and if unredeemed, it would\nrevert to its first possessor or his heirs in the year of jubilee.\nGod\u2019s Care for the Poor 485\nThe Lord declared to Israel: \u201cThe land shall not be sold forever:\nfor the land is Mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with Me.\u201d\nLeviticus 25:23. The people were to be impressed with the fact that\nit was God\u2019s land which they were permitted to possess for a time;\nthat He was the rightful owner, the original proprietor, and that He\nwould have special consideration made for the poor and unfortunate.\nIt was to be impressed upon the minds of all that the poor have as\nmuch right to a place in God\u2019s world as have the more wealthy.\nSuch were the provisions made by our merciful Creator, to lessen\nsuffering, to bring some ray of hope, to flash some gleam of sunshine,\ninto the life of the destitute and distressed.\nThe Lord would place a check upon the inordinate love of prop-\nerty and power. Great evils would result from the continued accu-\nmulation of wealth by one class, and the poverty and degradation\nof another. Without some restraint the power of the wealthy would\nbecome a monopoly, and the poor, though in every respect fully as\nworthy in God\u2019s sight, would be regarded and treated as inferior to\ntheir more prosperous brethren. The sense of this oppression would\narouse the passions of the poorer class. There would be a feeling\nof despair and desperation which would tend to demoralize society\nand open the door to crimes of every description. The regulations\nthat God established were designed to promote social equality. The\nprovisions of the sabbatical year and the jubilee would, in a great\nmeasure, set right that which during the interval had gone wrong in\nthe social and political economy of the nation.\nThese regulations were designed to bless the rich no less than\nthe poor. They would restrain avarice and a disposition for self-\nexaltation, and would cultivate a noble spirit of benevolence; and by\nfostering good will and confidence between all classes, they would\npromote social order, the stability of government. We are all woven\ntogether in the great web of humanity, and whatever we can do to [535]\nbenefit and uplift others will reflect in blessing upon ourselves. The\nlaw of mutual dependence runs through all classes of society. The\npoor are not more dependent upon the rich than are the rich upon\nthe poor. While the one class ask a share in the blessings which\nGod has bestowed upon their wealthier neighbors, the other need\nthe faithful service, the strength of brain and bone and muscle, that\nare the capital of the poor.\n486 Patriarchs and Prophets\nGreat blessings were promised to Israel on condition of obedi-\nence to the Lord\u2019s directions. \u201cI will give you rain in due season,\u201d\nHe declared, \u201cand the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of\nthe field shall yield their fruit. And your threshing shall reach unto\nthe vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye\nshall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. And\nI will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall\nmake you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither\nshall the sword go through your land.... I will walk among you, and\nwill be your God, and ye shall be My people.... But if ye will not\nhearken unto Me, and will not do all these commandments; and ...\nye break My covenant: ... ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your\nenemies shall eat it. And I will set My face against you, and ye shall\nbe slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over\nyou; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.\u201d Leviticus 26:4-17.\nThere are many who urge with great enthusiasm that all men\nshould have an equal share in the temporal blessings of God. But this\nwas not the purpose of the Creator. A diversity of condition is one\nof the means by which God designs to prove and develop character.\nYet He intends that those who have worldly possessions shall regard\nthemselves merely as stewards of His goods, as entrusted with means\nto be employed for the benefit of the suffering and the needy.\nChrist has said that we shall have the poor always with us, and\nHe unites His interest with that of His suffering people. The heart\nof our Redeemer sympathizes with the poorest and lowliest of His\nearthly children. He tells us that they are His representatives on\nearth. He has placed them among us to awaken in our hearts the\nlove that He feels toward the suffering and oppressed. Pity and\nbenevolence shown to them are accepted by Christ as if shown to[536]\nHimself. An act of cruelty or neglect toward them is regarded as\nthough done to Him.\nIf the law given by God for the benefit of the poor had continued\nto be carried out, how different would be the present condition of\nthe world, morally, spiritually, and temporally! Selfishness and\nself-importance would not be manifested as now, but each would\ncherish a kind regard for the happiness and welfare of others; and\nsuch widespread destitution as is now seen in many lands would not\nexist.\nGod\u2019s Care for the Poor 487\nThe principles which God has enjoined, would prevent the ter-\nrible evils that in all ages have resulted from the oppression of the\nrich toward the poor and the suspicion and hatred of the poor toward\nthe rich. While they might hinder the amassing of great wealth and\nthe indulgence of unbounded luxury, they would prevent the conse-\nquent ignorance and degradation of tens of thousands whose ill-paid\nservitude is required to build up these colossal fortunes. They would\nbring a peaceful solution of those problems that now threaten to fill\nthe world with anarchy and bloodshed.\nChapter 52\u2014The Annual Feasts[537]\nThis chapter is based on Leviticus 23.\nThere were three annual assemblies of all Israel for worship at\nthe sanctuary. Exodus 23:14-16. Shiloh was for a time the place of\nthese gatherings; but Jerusalem afterward became the center of the\nnation\u2019s worship, and here the tribes convened for the solemn feasts.\nThe people were surrounded by fierce, warlike tribes, that were\neager to seize upon their lands; yet three times every year all the\nable-bodied men and all the people who could make the journey were\ndirected to leave their homes and repair to the place of assembly,\nnear the center of the land. What was to hinder their enemies from\nsweeping down upon those unprotected households, to lay them\nwaste with fire and sword? What was to prevent an invasion of\nthe land, that would bring Israel into captivity to some foreign foe?\nGod had promised to be the protector of His people. \u201cThe angel of\nJehovah encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth\nthem.\u201d Psalm 34:7 [A.R.V .]. While the Israelites went up to worship,\ndivine power would place a restraint upon their enemies. God\u2019s\npromise was, \u201cI will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge\nthy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt\ngo up to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year.\u201d Exodus\n34:24.\nThe first of these festivals, the Passover, the feast of unleavened\nbread, occurred in Abib, the first month of the Jewish year, corre-\nsponding to the last of March and the beginning of April. The cold\nof winter was past, the latter rain had ended, and all nature rejoiced\nin the freshness and beauty of the springtime. The grass was green\non the hills and valleys, and wild flowers everywhere brightened\nthe fields. The moon, now approaching the full, made the evenings\ndelightful. It was the season so beautifully pictured by the sacred\nsinger:\n\u201cThe winter is past, [538]\n488\nAnnual Feasts 489\nThe rain is over and gone;\nThe flowers appear on the earth;\nThe time of the singing of birds is come,\nAnd the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;\nThe fig tree ripeneth her green figs,\nAnd the vines are in blossom,\nThey give forth their fragrance.\u201d Song of Solomon 2:11-13,",

The shepherds from their flocks, the herdsmen from\nthe mountains, fishers from the Sea of Galilee, the husbandmen from\ntheir fields, and sons of the prophets from the sacred schools\u2014all\nturned their steps toward the place where God\u2019s presence was re-\nvealed. They journeyed by short stages, for many went on foot. The\ncaravans were constantly receiving accessions, and often became\nvery large before reaching the Holy City.\nNature\u2019s gladness awakened joy in the hearts of Israel and grat-\nitude to the Giver of all good. The grand Hebrew psalms were\nchanted, exalting the glory and majesty of Jehovah. At the sound\nof the signal trumpet, with the music of cymbals, the chorus of\nthanksgiving arose, swelled by hundreds of voices:\n\u201cI was glad when they said unto me,\nLet us go unto the house of the Lord.\nOur feet are standing\nWithin thy gates, O Jerusalem....\nWhither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord, ...\nTo give thanks unto the name of Jehovah....\nPray for the peace of Jerusalem:\nThey shall prosper that love thee.\u201d Psalm 122:1-6, R.V .\nAs they saw around them the hills where the heathen had been\nwont to kindle their altar fires, the children of Israel sang:\n\u201cShall I lift up mine eyes to the hills?\nWhence should my help come?\nMy help cometh from Jehovah,\nWhich made heaven and earth.\u201d Psalm 121:1, 2 (margin).\n490 Patriarchs and Prophets\n\u201cThey that trust in the Lord\nAre as Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth\nforever.\nAs the mountains are round about Jerusalem,\nSo the Lord is round about His people,\nFrom this time forth and forevermore.\u201d Psalm 125:1, 2, R.V .\nSurmounting the hills in view of the Holy City, they looked with[539]\nreverent awe upon the throngs of worshipers wending their way to\nthe temple. They saw the smoke of the incense ascending, and as\nthey heard the trumpets of the Levites heralding the sacred service,\nthey caught the inspiration of the hour, and sang:\n\u201cGreat is the Lord, and greatly to be praised\nIn the city of our God, in the mountain of His holiness.\nBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth,\nIs Mount Zion, on the sides of the north,\nThe city of the great King.\u201d\nPsalm 48:1, 2.\n\u201cPeace be within thy walls,\nAnd prosperity within thy palaces.\u201d\n\u201cOpen to me the gates of righteousness:\nI will go into them, and I will praise the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cI will pay my vows unto the Lord\nNow in the presence of all His people,\nIn the courts of the Lord\u2019s house,\nIn the midst of thee, O Jerusalem,\nPraise ye the Lord.\u201d\nPsalm 122:7; 118:19; Psalm\n116:18, 19.\nAll the houses in Jerusalem were thrown open to the pilgrims,\nand rooms were furnished free; but this was not sufficient for the\nvast assembly, and tents were pitched in every available space in the\ncity and upon the surrounding hills.\nOn the fourteenth day of the month, at even, the Passover was\ncelebrated, its solemn, impressive ceremonies commemorating the\nAnnual Feasts 491\ndeliverance from bondage in Egypt, and pointing forward to the sac-\nrifice that should deliver from the bondage of sin. When the Saviour\nyielded up His life on Calvary, the significance of the Passover\nceased, and the ordinance of the Lord\u2019s Supper was instituted as a\nmemorial of the same event of which the Passover had been a type.\nThe Passover was followed by the seven day\u2019s feast of unleav-\nened bread. The first and the seventh day were days of holy convoca-\ntion, when no servile work was to be performed. On the second day\nof the feast, the first fruits of the year\u2019s harvest were presented before\nGod. Barley was the earliest grain in Palestine, and at the opening of\nthe feast it was beginning to ripen. A sheaf of this grain was waved\nby the priest before the altar of God, as an acknowledgment that\nall was His. Not until this ceremony had been performed was the\nharvest to be gathered.\nFifty days from the offering of first fruits, came the Pentecost, [540]\ncalled also the feast of harvest and the feast of weeks. As an expres-\nsion of gratitude for the grain prepared as food, two loaves baked\nwith leaven were presented before God. The Pentecost occupied but\none day, which was devoted to religious service.\nIn the seventh month came the Feast of Tabernacles, or of in-\ngathering. This feast acknowledged God\u2019s bounty in the products of\nthe orchard, the olive grove, and the vineyard. It was the crowning\nfestal gathering of the year. The land had yielded its increase, the\nharvests had been gathered into the granaries, the fruits, the oil, and\nthe wine had been stored, the first fruits had been reserved, and now\nthe people came with their tributes of thanksgiving to God, who had\nthus richly blessed them.\nThis feast was to be pre-eminently an occasion of rejoicing. It\noccurred just after the great Day of Atonement, when the assurance\nhad been given that their iniquity should be remembered no more.\nAt peace with God, they now came before Him to acknowledge His\ngoodness and to praise Him for His mercy. The labors of the harvest\nbeing ended, and the toils of the new year not yet begun, the people\nwere free from care, and could give themselves up to the sacred,\njoyous influences of the hour. Though only the fathers and sons were\ncommanded to appear at the feasts, yet, so far as possible, all the\nhousehold were to attend them, and to their hospitality the servants,\nthe Levites, the stranger, and the poor were made welcome.\n492 Patriarchs and Prophets\nLike the Passover, the Feast of Tabernacles was commemorative.\nIn memory of their pilgrim life in the wilderness the people were\nnow to leave their houses and dwell in booths, or arbors, formed\nfrom the green branches \u201cof goodly trees, branches of palm trees,\nand the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook.\u201d Leviticus\n23:40, 42, 43.\nThe first day was a holy convocation, and to the seven days of the\nfeast an eighth day was added, which was observed in like manner.\nAt these yearly assemblies the hearts of old and young would be\nencouraged in the service of God, while the association of the people\nfrom the different quarters of the land would strengthen the ties that\nbound them to God and to one another. Well would it be for the\npeople of God at the present time to have a Feast of Tabernacles\u2014a[541]\njoyous commemoration of the blessings of God to them. As the\nchildren of Israel celebrated the deliverance that God had wrought\nfor their fathers, and His miraculous preservation of them during\ntheir journeyings from Egypt, so should we gratefully call to mind\nthe various ways He has devised for bringing us out from the world,\nand from the darkness of error, into the precious light of His grace\nand truth.\nWith those who lived at a distance from the tabernacle, more\nthan a month of every year must have been occupied in attendance\nupon the annual feasts. This example of devotion to God should\nemphasize the importance of religious worship and the necessity of\nsubordinating our selfish, worldly interests to those that are spiritual\nand eternal. We sustain a loss when we neglect the privilege of\nassociating together to strengthen and encourage one another in the\nservice of God. The truths of His word lose their vividness and\nimportance in our minds. Our hearts cease to be enlightened and\naroused by the sanctifying influence, and we decline in spirituality.\nIn our intercourse as Christians we lose much by lack of sympathy\nwith one another. He who shuts himself up to himself is not filling\nthe position that God designed he should. We are all children of one\nFather, dependent upon one another for happiness. The claims of\nGod and of humanity are upon us. It is the proper cultivation of the\nsocial elements of our nature that brings us into sympathy with our\nbrethren and affords us happiness in our efforts to bless others.\nAnnual Feasts 493\nThe Feast of Tabernacles was not only commemorative but typi-\ncal. It not only pointed back to the wilderness sojourn, but, as the\nfeast of harvest, it celebrated the ingathering of the fruits of the earth,\nand pointed forward to the great day of final ingathering, when the\nLord of the harvest shall send forth His reapers to gather the tares\ntogether in bundles for the fire, and to gather the wheat into His\ngarner. At that time the wicked will all be destroyed. They will\nbecome \u201cas though they had not been.\u201d Obadiah 16. And every\nvoice in the whole universe will unite in joyful praise to God. Says\nthe revelator, \u201cEvery creature which is in heaven, and on the earth,\nand under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in\nthem, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be\nunto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever\nand ever.\u201d Revelation 5:13.\nThe people of Israel praised God at the Feast of Tabernacles, as [542]\nthey called to mind His mercy in their deliverance from the bondage\nof Egypt and His tender care for them during their pilgrim life in the\nwilderness. They rejoiced also in the consciousness of pardon and\nacceptance, through the service of the day of atonement, just ended.\nBut when the ransomed of the Lord shall have been safely gathered\ninto the heavenly Canaan, forever delivered from the bondage of the\ncurse, under which \u201cthe whole creation groaneth and travaileth in\npain together until now\u201d (Romans 8:22), they will rejoice with joy\nunspeakable and full of glory. Christ\u2019s great work of atonement for\nmen will then have been completed, and their sins will have been\nforever blotted out.\n\u201cThe wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them;\nAnd the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.\nIt shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and\nsinging:\nThe glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it,\nThe excellency of Carmel and Sharon;\nThey shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our\nGod.\n\u201cThen the eyes of the blind shall be opened,\nAnd the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.\n494 Patriarchs and Prophets\nThen shall the lame man leap as an hart,\nAnd the tongue of the dumb sing:\n\u201cFor in the wilderness shall waters break out,\nAnd streams in the desert.\nAnd the parched ground shall become a pool,\nAnd the thirsty land springs of water: ...\n\u201cAnd an highway shall be there, and a way,\nAnd it shall be called The way of holiness;\nThe unclean shall not pass over it;\nBut it shall be for those:\nThe wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.\n\u201cNo lion shall be there,\nNor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon,\nIt shall not be found there;\nBut the redeemed shall walk there:\n\u201cAnd the ransomed of the Lord shall return,\nAnd come to Zion with songs\nAnd everlasting joy upon their heads:\nThey shall obtain joy and gladness,\nAnd sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\u201d\nIsaiah 35:1, 2, 5-10.\nChapter 53\u2014The Earlier Judges [543]\nThis chapter is based on Judges 6 to 8; 10.\nAfter the settlement in Canaan the tribes made no vigorous effort\nto complete the conquest of the land. Satisfied with the territory\nalready gained, their zeal soon flagged, and the war was discontinued.\n\u201cWhen Israel was strong, ... they put the Canaanites to tribute, and\ndid not utterly drive them out.\u201d Judges 1:28.\nThe Lord had faithfully fulfilled, on His part, the promises made\nto Israel; Joshua had broken the power of the Canaanites, and had\ndistributed the land to the tribes. It only remained for them, trusting\nin the assurance of divine aid, to complete the work of dispossessing\nthe inhabitants of the land. But this they failed to do. By entering into\nleague with the Canaanites they directly transgressed the command\nof God, and thus failed to fulfill the condition on which He had\npromised to place them in possession of Canaan.\nFrom the very first communication of God with them at Sinai,\nthey had been warned against idolatry. Immediately after the procla-\nmation of the law the message was sent them by Moses concerning\nthe nations of Canaan: \u201cThou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor\nserve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow\nthem, and quite break down their images. And ye shall serve the\nLord your God, and He shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I\nwill take sickness away from the midst of thee.\u201d Exodus 23:24, 25.\nThe assurance was given that so long as they remained obedient,\nGod would subdue their enemies before them: \u201cI will send My fear\nbefore thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come;\nand I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. And I\nwill send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the\nCanaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. I will not drive them out\nfrom before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the\nbeast of the field multiply against thee. By little and little I will drive [544]\nthem out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the\n495\n496 Patriarchs and Prophets\nland.... I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and\nthou shalt drive them out before thee. Thou shalt make no covenant\nwith them, nor with their gods. They shall not dwell in thy land,\nlest they make thee sin against Me: for if thou serve their gods, it\nwill surely be a snare unto thee.\u201d Exodus 23:27-33. These directions\nwere reiterated in the most solemn manner by Moses before his\ndeath, and they were repeated by Joshua.\nGod had placed His people in Canaan as a mighty breastwork\nto stay the tide of moral evil, that it might not flood the world. If\nfaithful to Him, God intended that Israel should go on conquering\nand to conquer. He would give into their hands nations greater and\nmore powerful than the Canaanites. The promise was: \u201cIf ye shall\ndiligently keep all these commandments which I command you, ...\nthen will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and\nye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves. Every\nplace whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from\nthe wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even\nunto the uttermost sea shall your coast be. There shall no man be\nable to stand before you: for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of\nyou and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon,\nas He hath said unto you.\u201d Deuteronomy 11:22-25.\nBut regardless of their high destiny, they chose the course of ease\nand self-indulgence; they let slip their opportunities for completing\nthe conquest of the land; and for many generations they were afflicted\nby the remnant of these idolatrous peoples, that were, as the prophet\nhad foretold, as \u201cpricks\u201d in their eyes, and as \u201cthorns\u201d in their sides.\nNumbers 33:55.\nThe Israelites were \u201cmingled among the heathen, and learned\ntheir works.\u201d Psalm 106:35. They intermarried with the Canaanites,\nand idolatry spread like a plague throughout the land. \u201cThey served\ntheir idols: which were a snare unto them. Yea, they sacrificed their\nsons and their daughters unto devils: ... and the land was polluted\nwith blood.... Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against\nHis people, insomuch that He abhorred His own inheritance.\u201d Psalm\n106:36-40.\nUntil the generation that had received instruction from Joshua\nbecame extinct, idolatry made little headway; but the parents had[545]\nprepared the way for the apostasy of their children. The disregard of\nEarlier Judges 497\nthe Lord\u2019s restrictions on the part of those who came in possession\nof Canaan sowed seed of evil that continued to bring forth bitter\nfruit for many generations. The simple habits of the Hebrews had\nsecured them physical health; but association with the heathen led\nto the indulgence of appetite and passion, which gradually lessened\nphysical strength and enfeebled the mental and moral powers. By\ntheir sins the Israelites were separated from God; His strength was\nremoved from them, and they could no longer prevail against their\nenemies. Thus they were brought into subjection to the very nations\nthat through God they might have subdued.\n\u201cThey forsook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them\nout of the land of Egypt,\u201d \u201cand guided them in the wilderness like\na flock.\u201d \u201cThey provoked Him to anger with their high places, and\nmoved Him to jealousy with their graven images.\u201d Therefore the\nLord \u201cforsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He placed\namong them; and delivered His strength into captivity, and His\nglory into the enemy\u2019s hand.\u201d Judges 2:12; Psalm 78:52, 58, 60,\n61. Yet He did not utterly forsake His people. There was ever\na remnant who were true to Jehovah; and from time to time the\nLord raised up faithful and valiant men to put down idolatry and to\ndeliver the Israelites from their enemies. But when the deliverer was\ndead, and the people were released from his authority, they would\ngradually return to their idols. And thus the story of backsliding and\nchastisement, of confession and deliverance, was repeated again and\nagain.\nThe king of Mesopotamia, the king of Moab, and after them the\nPhilistines, and the Canaanites of Hazor, led by Sisera, in turn be-\ncame the oppressors of Israel. Othniel, Shamgar, and Ehud, Deborah\nand Barak, were raised up as deliverers of their people. But again\n\u201cthe children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord\ndelivered them into the hand of Midian.\u201d Heretofore the hand of the\noppressor had fallen but lightly on the tribes dwelling east of the\nJordan, but in the present calamities they were the first sufferers.\nThe Amalekites on the south of Canaan, as well as the Midi-\nanites on its eastern border, and in the deserts beyond, were still\nthe unrelenting enemies of Israel. The latter nation had been nearly\ndestroyed by the Israelites in the days of Moses, but they had since [546]\nincreased greatly, and had become numerous and powerful. They\n498 Patriarchs and Prophets\nhad thirsted for revenge; and now that the protecting hand of God\nwas withdrawn from Israel, the opportunity had come. Not alone\nthe tribes east of Jordan, but the whole land suffered from their\nravages. The wild, fierce inhabitants of the desert, \u201cas locusts for\nmultitude\u201d (Judges 6:5, R.V .), came swarming into the land, with\ntheir flocks and herds. Like a devouring plague they spread over the\ncountry, from the river Jordan to the Philistine plain. They came\nas soon as the harvests began to ripen, and remained until the last\nfruits of the earth had been gathered. They stripped the fields of\ntheir increase and robbed and maltreated the inhabitants and then\nreturned to the deserts. Thus the Israelites dwelling in the open\ncountry were forced to abandon their homes, and to congregate in\nwalled towns, to seek refuge in fortresses, or even to find shelter in\ncaves and rocky fastnesses among the mountains. For seven years\nthis oppression continued, and then, as the people in their distress\ngave heed to the Lord\u2019s reproof, and confessed their sins, God again\nraised up a helper for them.\nGideon was the son of Joash, of the tribe of Manasseh. The\ndivision to which this family belonged held no leading position, but\nthe household of Joash was distinguished for courage and integrity.\nOf his brave sons it is said, \u201cEach one resembled the children of a\nking.\u201d All but one had fallen in the struggles against the Midianites,\nand he had caused his name to be feared by the invaders. To Gideon\ncame the divine call to deliver his people. He was engaged at the time\nin threshing wheat. A small quantity of grain had been concealed,\nand not daring to beat it out on the ordinary threshing floor, he had\nresorted to a spot near the winepress; for the season of ripe grapes\nbeing still far off, little notice was now taken of the vineyards. As\nGideon labored in secrecy and silence, he sadly pondered upon the\ncondition of Israel and considered how the oppressor\u2019s yoke might\nbe broken from off his people.\nSuddenly the \u201cAngel of the Lord\u201d appeared and addressed him\nwith the words, \u201cJehovah is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.\u201d\n\u201cO my Lord,\u201d was his answer, \u201cif the Lord be with us, why then\nis all this befallen us? and where be all His miracles which our\nfathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?[547]\nbut now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands\nof the Midianites.\u201d\nEarlier Judges 499\nThe Messenger of heaven replied, \u201cGo in this thy might, and\nthou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I\nsent thee?\u201d\nGideon desired some token that the one now addressing him was\nthe Covenant Angel, who in time past had wrought for Israel. Angels\nof God, who communed with Abraham, had once tarried to share\nhis hospitality; and Gideon now entreated the divine Messenger to\nremain as his guest. Hastening to his tent, he prepared from his\nscanty store a kid and unleavened cakes, which he brought forth and\nset before Him. But the Angel bade him, \u201cTake the flesh and the\nunleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the\nbroth.\u201d Gideon did so, and then the sign which he had desired was\ngiven: with the staff in His hand, the Angel touched the flesh and\nthe unleavened cakes, and a flame bursting from the rock consumed\nthe sacrifice. Then the Angel vanished from his sight.\nGideon\u2019s father, Joash, who shared in the apostasy of his coun-\ntrymen, had erected at Ophrah, where he dwelt, a large altar to Baal,\nat which the people of the town worshiped. Gideon was commanded\nto destroy this altar and to erect an altar to Jehovah over the rock on\nwhich the offering had been consumed, and there to present a sacri-\nfice to the Lord. The offering of sacrifice to God had been committed\nto the priests, and had been restricted to the altar at Shiloh; but He\nwho had established the ritual service, and to whom all its offerings\npointed, had power to change its requirements. The deliverance of\nIsrael was to be preceded by a solemn protest against the worship\nof Baal. Gideon must declare war upon idolatry before going out to\nbattle with the enemies of his people.\nThe divine direction was faithfully carried out. Knowing that he\nwould be opposed if it were attempted openly, Gideon performed\nthe work in secret; with the aid of his servants, accomplishing the\nwhole in one night. Great was the rage of the men of Ophrah when\nthey came next morning to pay their devotions to Baal. They would\nhave taken Gideon\u2019s life had not Joash\u2014who had been told of the\nAngel\u2019s visit\u2014stood in defense of his son. \u201cWill ye plead for Baal?\u201d\nsaid Joash. \u201cWill ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him\nbe put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him [548]\nplead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.\u201d If Baal\n500 Patriarchs and Prophets\ncould not defend his own altar, how could he be trusted to protect\nhis worshipers?\nAll thoughts of violence toward Gideon were dismissed; and\nwhen he sounded the trumpet of war, the men of Ophrah were among\nthe first to gather to his standard. Heralds were dispatched to his\nown tribe of Manasseh, and also to Asher, Zebulum, and Naphtali,\nand all answered to the call.\nGideon dared not place himself at the head of the army without\nstill further evidence that God had called him to his work, and that\nHe would be with him. He prayed, \u201cIf Thou wilt save Israel by mine\nhand, as Thou hast said, behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the\nfloor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the\nearth besides, then shall I know that Thou wilt save Israel by mine\nhand, as Thou hast said.\u201d In the morning the fleece was wet, while\nthe ground was dry. But now a doubt arose, since wool naturally\nabsorbs moisture when there is any in the air; the test might not be\ndecisive. Hence he asked that the sign be reversed, pleading that\nhis extreme caution might not displease the Lord. His request was\ngranted.\nThus encouraged, Gideon led out his forces to give battle to the\ninvaders. \u201cAll the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children\nof the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in\nthe valley of Jezreel.\u201d The entire force under Gideon\u2019s command\nnumbered only thirty-two thousand men; but with the vast host of\nthe enemy spread out before him, the word of the Lord came to\nhim: \u201cThe people that are with thee are too many for Me to give\nthe Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against\nMe, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me. Now therefore go to,\nproclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and\nafraid, let him return and depart early from Mount Gilead.\u201d Those\nwho were unwilling to face danger and hardships, or whose worldly\ninterests would draw their hearts from the work of God, would add\nno strength to the armies of Israel. Their presence would prove only\na cause of weakness.\nIt had been made a law in Israel that before they went to battle the\nfollowing proclamation should be made throughout the army: \u201cWhat\nman is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it?\nlet him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and\nEarlier Judges 501\nanother man dedicate it. And what man is he that hath planted a [549]\nvineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto\nhis house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it. And\nwhat man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her?\nlet him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and\nanother man take her.\u201d And the officers were to speak further to the\npeople, saying, \u201cWhat man is there that is fearful and fainthearted?\nlet him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren\u2019s heart faint\nas well as his heart.\u201d Deuteronomy 20:5-8.\nBecause his numbers were so few compared with those of the\nenemy, Gideon had refrained from making the usual proclamation.\nHe was filled with astonishment at the declaration that his army was\ntoo large. But the Lord saw the pride and unbelief existing in the\nhearts of His people. Aroused by the stirring appeals of Gideon,\nthey had readily enlisted; but many were filled with fear when they\nsaw the multitudes of the Midianites. Yet, had Israel triumphed,\nthose very ones would have taken the glory to themselves instead of\nascribing the victory to God.\nGideon obeyed the Lord\u2019s direction, and with a heavy heart he\nsaw twenty-two thousand, or more than two thirds of his entire force,\ndepart for their homes. Again the word of the Lord came to him:\n\u201cThe people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and\nI will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto\nthee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of\nwhomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same\nshall not go.\u201d The people were led down to the waterside, expecting\nto make an immediate advance upon the enemy. A few hastily took\na little water in the hand and sucked it up as they went on; but nearly\nall bowed upon their knees, and leisurely drank from the surface of\nthe stream. Those who took of the water in their hands were but\nthree hundred out of ten thousand; yet these were selected; all the\nrest were permitted to return to their homes.\nBy the simplest means character is often tested. Those who in\ntime of peril were intent upon supplying their own wants were not\nthe men to be trusted in an emergency. The Lord has no place in\nHis work for the indolent and self-indulgent. The men of His choice\nwere the few who would not permit their own wants to delay them\nin the discharge of duty. The three hundred chosen men not only\n502 Patriarchs and Prophets\npossessed courage and self-control, but they were men of faith. They[550]\nhad not defiled themselves with idolatry. God could direct them, and\nthrough them He could work deliverance for Israel. Success does\nnot depend upon numbers. God can deliver by few as well as by\nmany. He is honored not so much by the great numbers as by the\ncharacter of those who serve Him.\nThe Israelites were stationed on the brow of a hill overlooking\nthe valley where the hosts of the invaders lay encamped. \u201cAnd\nthe Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east\nlay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels\nwere without number, as the sand which is upon the seashore for\nmultitude.\u201d Judges 7:12, R.V . Gideon trembled as he thought of the\nconflict of the morrow. But the Lord spoke to him in the night season\nand bade him, with Phurah his attendant, go down to the camp of the\nMidianites, intimating that he would there hear something for his\nencouragement. He went, and, waiting in the darkness and silence,\nhe heard a soldier relating a dream to his companion: \u201cLo, a cake of\nbarley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent,\nand smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.\u201d\nThe other answered in words that stirred the heart of that unseen\nlistener, \u201cThis is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of\nJoash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian,\nand all the host.\u201d Gideon recognized the voice of God speaking to\nhim through those Midianitish strangers. Returning to the few men\nunder his command, he said, \u201cArise; for the Lord hath delivered into\nyour hand the host of Midian.\u201d\nBy divine direction a plan of attack was suggested to him, which\nhe immediately set out to execute. The three hundred men were\ndivided into three companies. To every man were given a trumpet,\nand a torch concealed in an earthen pitcher. The men were stationed\nin such a manner as to approach the Midianite camp from different\ndirections. In the dead of night, at a signal from Gideon\u2019s war horn,\nthe three companies sounded their trumpets; then, breaking their\npitchers and displaying the blazing torches, they rushed upon the\nenemy with the terrible war cry, \u201cThe sword of the Lord, and of\nGideon!\u201d\nThe sleeping army was suddenly aroused. Upon every side was\nseen the light of the flaming torches. In every direction was heard\nEarlier Judges 503\nthe sound of trumpets, with the cry of the assailants. Believing [551]\n[552]\n[553]\nthemselves at the mercy of an overwhelming force, the Midianites\nwere panic-stricken. With wild cries of alarm they fled for life, and,\nmistaking their own companions for enemies, they slew one another.\nAs news of the victory spread, thousands of the men of Israel who\nhad been dismissed to their homes returned and joined in pursuit\nof their fleeing enemies. The Midianites were making their way\ntoward the Jordan, hoping to reach their own territory, beyond the\nriver. Gideon sent messengers to the tribe of Ephraim, rousing them\nto intercept the fugitives at the southern fords. Meanwhile, with his\nthree hundred, \u201cfaint, yet pursuing,\u201d Gideon crossed the stream hard\nafter those who had already gained the farther side. The two princes,\nZebah and Zalmunna, who had been over the entire host, and who\nhad escaped with an army of fifteen thousand men, were overtaken\nby Gideon, their force completely scattered, and the leaders captured\nand slain.\nIn this signal defeat not less than one hundred and twenty thou-\nsand of the invaders perished. The power of the Midianites was\nbroken, so that they were never again able to make war upon Is-\nrael. The tidings spread swiftly far and wide, that Israel\u2019s God had\nagain fought for His people. No words can describe the terror of\nthe surrounding nations when they learned what simple means had\nprevailed against the power of a bold, warlike people.\nThe leader whom God chose to overthrow the Midianites occu-\npied no prominent position in Israel. He was not a ruler, a priest, or\na Levite. He thought himself the least in his father\u2019s house. But God\nsaw in him a man of courage and integrity. He was distrustful of\nhimself and willing to follow the guidance of the Lord. God does\nnot always choose for His work men of the greatest talents, but He\nselects those whom He can best use. \u201cBefore honor is humility.\u201d\nProverbs 15:33. The Lord can work most effectually through those\nwho are most sensible of their own insufficiency, and who will rely\nupon Him as their leader and source of strength. He will make\nthem strong by uniting their weakness to His might, and wise by\nconnecting their ignorance with His wisdom.\nIf they would cherish true humility, the Lord could do much\nmore for His people; but there are few who can be trusted with\nany large measure of responsibility or success without becoming\n504 Patriarchs and Prophets\nself-confident and forgetful of their dependence upon God. This is[554]\nwhy, in choosing the instruments for His work, the Lord passes by\nthose whom the world honors as great, talented, and brilliant. They\nare too often proud and self-sufficient. They feel competent to act\nwithout counsel from God.\nThe simple act of blowing a blast upon the trumpet by the army\nof Joshua around Jericho, and by Gideon\u2019s little band about the\nhosts of Midian, was made effectual, through the power of God, to\noverthrow the might of His enemies. The most complete system\nthat men have ever devised, apart from the power and wisdom of\nGod, will prove a failure, while the most unpromising methods will\nsucceed when divinely appointed and entered upon with humility\nand faith. Trust in God and obedience to His will are as essential\nto the Christian in the spiritual warfare as to Gideon and Joshua in\ntheir battles with the Canaanites. By the repeated manifestations of\nHis power in behalf of Israel, God would lead them to have faith\nin Him\u2014with confidence to seek His help in every emergency. He\nis just as willing to work with the efforts of His people now and to\naccomplish great things through weak instrumentalities. All heaven\nawaits our demand upon its wisdom and strength. God is \u201cable to\ndo exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.\u201d Ephesians\n3:20.\nGideon returned from pursuing the enemies of the nation, to\nmeet censure and accusation from his own countrymen. When at\nhis call the men of Israel had rallied against the Midianites, the tribe\nof Ephraim had remained behind. They looked upon the effort as a\nperilous undertaking; and as Gideon sent them no special summons,\nthey availed themselves of this excuse not to join their brethren. But\nwhen the news of Israel\u2019s triumph reached them, the Ephraimites\nwere envious because they had not shared it. After the rout of\nthe Midianites, the men of Ephraim had, by Gideon\u2019s direction,\nseized the fords of the Jordan, thus preventing the escape of the\nfugitives. By this means a large number of the enemy were slain,\namong whom were two princes, Oreb and Zeeb. Thus the men of\nEphraim followed up the battle, and helped complete the victory.\nNevertheless, they were jealous and angry, as though Gideon had\nbeen led by his own will and judgment. They did not discern God\u2019s\nhand in the triumph of Israel, they did not appreciate His power and\nEarlier Judges 505\nmercy in their deliverance; and this very fact showed them unworthy [555]\nto be chosen as His special instruments.\nReturning with the trophies of victory, they angrily reproached\nGideon: \u201cWhy hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not,\nwhen thou wentest to fight with the Midianites?\u201d\n\u201cWhat have I done now, in comparison of you?\u201d said Gideon. \u201cIs\nnot the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of\nAbiezer? God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian,\nOreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you?\u201d\nThe spirit of jealousy might easily have been fanned into a quar-\nrel that would have caused strife and bloodshed; but Gideon\u2019s modest\nanswer soothed the anger of the men of Ephraim, and they returned\nin peace to their homes. Firm and uncompromising where princi-\nple was concerned, and in war a \u201cmighty man of valor,\u201d Gideon\ndisplayed also a spirit of courtesy that is rarely witnessed.\nThe people of Israel, in their gratitude at deliverance from the\nMidianites, proposed to Gideon that he should become their king,\nand that the throne should be confirmed to his descendants. This\nproposition was in direct violation of the principles of the theocracy.\nGod was the king of Israel, and for them to place a man upon the\nthrone would be a rejection of their Divine Sovereign. Gideon\nrecognized this fact; his answer shows how true and noble were his\nmotives. \u201cI will not rule over you,\u201d he declared; \u201cneither shall my\nson rule over you: the Lord shall rule over you.\u201d\nBut Gideon was betrayed into another error, which brought dis-\naster upon his house and upon all Israel. The season of inactivity that\nsucceeds a great struggle is often fraught with greater danger than is\nthe period of conflict. To this danger Gideon was now exposed. A\nspirit of unrest was upon him. Hitherto he had been content to fulfill\nthe directions given him from God; but now, instead of waiting for\ndivine guidance, he began to plan for himself. When the armies\nof the Lord have gained a signal victory, Satan will redouble his\nefforts to overthrow the work of God. Thus thoughts and plans were\nsuggested to the mind of Gideon, by which the people of Israel were\nled astray.\nBecause he had been commanded to offer sacrifice upon the rock\nwhere the Angel appeared to him, Gideon concluded that he had [556]\nbeen appointed to officiate as a priest. Without waiting for the divine\n506 Patriarchs and Prophets\nsanction, he determined to provide a suitable place, and to institute\na system of worship similar to that carried on at the tabernacle.\nWith the strong popular feeling in his favor he found no difficulty in\ncarrying out his plan. At his request all the earrings of gold taken\nfrom the Midianites were given him as his share of the spoil. The\npeople also collected many other costly materials, together with the\nrichly adorned garments of the princes of Midian. From the material\nthus furnished, Gideon constructed an ephod and a breastplate, in\nimitation of those worn by the high priest. His course proved a snare\nto himself and his family, as well as to Israel. The unauthorized\nworship led many of the people finally to forsake the Lord altogether,\nto serve idols. After Gideon\u2019s death great numbers, among whom\nwere his own family, joined in this apostasy. The people were led\naway from God by the very man who had once overthrown their\nidolatry.\nThere are few who realize how far-reaching is the influence\nof their words and acts. How often the errors of parents produce\nthe most disastrous effects upon their children and children\u2019s chil-\ndren, long after the actors themselves have been laid in the grave.\nEveryone is exerting an influence upon others, and will be held\naccountable for the result of that influence. Words and actions have\na telling power, and the long hereafter will show the effect of our\nlife here. The impression made by our words and deeds will surely\nreact upon ourselves in blessing or in cursing. This thought gives an\nawful solemnity to life, and should draw us to God in humble prayer\nthat He will guide us by His wisdom.\nThose who stand in the highest positions may lead astray. The\nwisest err; the strongest may falter and stumble. There is need that\nlight from above should be constantly shed upon our pathway. Our\nonly safety lies in trusting our way implicitly to Him who has said,\n\u201cFollow Me.\u201d\nAfter the death of Gideon \u201cthe children of Israel remembered\nnot the Lord their God, who had delivered them out of the hands\nof all their enemies on every side: neither showed they kindness\nto the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the\ngoodness which he had showed unto Israel.\u201d Forgetful of all that\nthey owed to Gideon, their judge and deliverer, the people of Israel\naccepted his baseborn son Abimelech as their king, who, to sustain[557]\nEarlier Judges 507\nhis power, murdered all but one of Gideon\u2019s lawful children. When\nmen cast off the fear of God they are not long in departing from\nhonor and integrity. An appreciation of the Lord\u2019s mercy will lead\nto an appreciation of those who, like Gideon, have been employed\nas instruments to bless His people. The cruel course of Israel toward\nthe house of Gideon was what might be expected from a people who\nmanifested so great ingratitude to God.\nAfter the death of Abimelech the rule of judges who feared the\nLord served for a time to put a check upon idolatry, but erelong the\npeople returned to the practices of the heathen communities around\nthem. Among the northern tribes the gods of Syria and Sidon had\nmany worshipers. On the southwest the idols of the Philistines, and\non the east those of Moab and Ammon, had turned the hearts of\nIsrael from the God of their fathers. But apostasy speedily brought\nits punishment. The Ammonites subdued the eastern tribes and,\ncrossing the Jordan, invaded the territory of Judah and Ephraim.\nOn the west the Philistines came up from their plain beside the\nsea, burning and pillaging far and near. Again Israel seemed to be\nabandoned to the power of relentless foes.\nAgain the people sought help from Him whom they had so\nforsaken and insulted. \u201cThe children of Israel cried unto the Lord,\nsaying, We have sinned against Thee, both because we have forsaken\nour God, and also served Baalim.\u201d But sorrow had not worked true\nrepentance. The people mourned because their sins had brought\nsuffering upon themselves, but not because they had dishonored\nGod by transgression of His holy law. True repentance is more than\nsorrow for sin. It is a resolute turning away from evil.\nThe Lord answered them through one of His prophets: \u201cDid I\nnot deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from\nthe children of Ammon, and from the Philistines? The Zidonians\nalso, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and\nye cried to Me, and I delivered you out of their hand. Yet ye have\nforsaken Me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you\nno more. Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them\ndeliver you in the time of your tribulation.\u201d\nThese solemn and fearful words carry the mind forward to an-\nother scene\u2014the great day of final judgment\u2014when the rejecters of [558]\nGod\u2019s mercy and the despisers of His grace shall be brought face to\n508 Patriarchs and Prophets\nface with His justice. At that tribunal must they render an account\nwho have devoted their God-given talents of time, of means, or of\nintellect, to serving the gods of this world. They have forsaken their\ntrue and loving Friend, to follow the path of convenience and worldly\npleasure. They intended at some time to return to God; but the world\nwith its follies and deceptions absorbed the attention. Frivolous\namusements, pride of dress, indulgence of appetite, hardened the\nheart and benumbed the conscience, so that the voice of truth was\nnot heard. Duty was despised. Things of infinite value were lightly\nesteemed, until the heart lost all desire to sacrifice for Him who has\ngiven so much for man. But in the reaping time they will gather that\nwhich they have sown.\nSaith the Lord: \u201cI have called, and ye refused; I have stretched\nout My hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all My\ncounsel, and would none of My reproof: ... when your fear cometh\nas desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when\ndistress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon\nMe, but I will not answer; they shall seek Me early, but they shall\nnot find Me: for that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the\nfear of the Lord: they would none of My counsel: they despised all\nMy reproof. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,\nand be filled with their own devices.\u201d \u201cBut whoso hearkeneth unto\nMe shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.\u201d Proverbs\n1:24-31, 33.\nThe Israelites now humbled themselves before the Lord. \u201cAnd\nthey put away the strange gods from among them, and served Je-\nhovah.\u201d And the Lord\u2019s heart of love was grieved\u2014\u201cwas grieved\nfor the misery of Israel.\u201d Oh, the long-suffering mercy of our God!\nWhen His people put away the sins that had shut out His presence,\nHe heard their prayers and at once began to work for them.\nA deliverer was raised up in the person of Jephthah, a Gileadite,\nwho made war upon the Ammonites and effectually destroyed their\npower. For eighteen years at this time Israel had suffered under the\noppression of her foes, yet again the lesson taught by suffering was\nforgotten.\nAs His people returned to their evil ways, the Lord permitted\nthem to be still oppressed by their powerful enemies, the Philistines.\nFor many years they were constantly harassed, and at times com-[559]\nEarlier Judges 509\npletely subjugated, by this cruel and warlike nation. They had\nmingled with these idolaters, uniting with them in pleasure and in\nworship, until they seemed to be one with them in spirit and interest.\nThen these professed friends of Israel became their bitterest enemies\nand sought by every means to accomplish their destruction.\nLike Israel, Christians too often yield to the influence of the\nworld and conform to its principles and customs, in order to secure\nthe friendship of the ungodly; but in the end it will be found that\nthese professed friends are the most dangerous of foes. The Bible\nplainly teaches that there can be no harmony between the people\nof God and the world. \u201cMarvel not, my brethren, if the world hate\nyou.\u201d 1 John 3:13. Our Saviour says, \u201cYe know that it hated Me\nbefore it hated you.\u201d John 15:18. Satan works through the ungodly,\nunder cover of a pretended friendship, to allure God\u2019s people into\nsin, that he may separate them from Him; and when their defense is\nremoved, then he will lead his agents to turn against them and seek\nto accomplish their destruction.\nChapter 54\u2014Samson[560]\nThis chapter is based on Judges 13 to 16.\nAmid the widespread apostasy the faithful worshipers of God\ncontinued to plead with Him for the deliverance of Israel. Though\nthere was apparently no response, though year after year the power\nof the oppressor continued to rest more heavily upon the land, God\u2019s\nprovidence was preparing help for them. Even in the early years\nof the Philistine oppression a child was born through whom God\ndesigned to humble the power of these mighty foes.\nOn the border of the hill country overlooking the Philistine plain\nwas the little town of Zorah. Here dwelt the family of Manoah, of\nthe tribe of Dan, one of the few households that amid the general\ndefection had remained true to Jehovah. To the childless wife of\nManoah \u201cthe Angel of Jehovah\u201d appeared with the message that\nshe should have a son, through whom God would begin to deliver\nIsrael. In view of this the Angel gave her instruction concerning her\nown habits, and also for the treatment of her child: \u201cNow therefore\nbeware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not\nany unclean thing.\u201d And the same prohibition was to be imposed,\nfrom the first, upon the child, with the addition that his hair should\nnot be cut; for he was to be consecrated to God as a Nazarite from\nhis birth.\nThe woman sought her husband, and, after describing the Angel,\nshe repeated His message. Then, fearful that they should make\nsome mistake in the important work committed to them, the husband\nprayed, \u201cLet the Man of God which Thou didst send come again\nunto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be\nborn.\u201d\nWhen the Angel again appeared, Manoah\u2019s anxious inquiry was,\n\u201cHow shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?\u201d\nThe previous instruction was repeated\u2014\u201cOf all that I said unto the[561]\nwoman let her beware. She may not eat of anything that cometh\n510\nSamson 511\nof the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any\nunclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.\u201d\nGod had an important work for the promised child of Manoah\nto do, and it was to secure for him the qualifications necessary for\nthis work that the habits of both the mother and the child were to\nbe carefully regulated. \u201cNeither let her drink wine or strong drink,\u201d\nwas the Angel\u2019s instruction for the wife of Manoah, \u201cnor eat any\nunclean thing. All that I commanded her let her observe.\u201d The child\nwill be affected for good or for evil by the habits of the mother. She\nmust herself be controlled by principle and must practice temperance\nand self-denial, if she would seek the welfare of her child. Unwise\nadvisers will urge upon the mother the necessity of gratifying every\nwish and impulse, but such teaching is false and mischievous. The\nmother is by the command of God Himself placed under the most\nsolemn obligation to exercise self-control.\nAnd fathers as well as mothers are involved in this responsibility.\nBoth parents transmit their own characteristics, mental and physical,\ntheir dispositions and appetites, to their children. As the result\nof parental intemperance children often lack physical strength and\nmental and moral power. Liquor drinkers and tobacco users may,\nand do, transmit their insatiable craving, their inflamed blood and\nirritable nerves, to their children. The licentious often bequeath their\nunholy desires, and even loathsome diseases, as a legacy to their\noffspring. And as the children have less power to resist temptation\nthan had the parents, the tendency is for each generation to fall lower\nand lower. To a great degree parents are responsible not only for the\nviolent passions and perverted appetites of their children but for the\ninfirmities of the thousands born deaf, blind, diseased, or idiotic.\nThe inquiry of every father and mother should be, \u201cWhat shall we\ndo unto the child that shall be born unto us?\u201d The effect of prenatal\ninfluences has been by many lightly regarded; but the instruction\nsent from heaven to those Hebrew parents, and twice repeated in the\nmost explicit and solemn manner, shows how this matter is looked\nupon by our Creator.\nAnd it was not enough that the promised child should receive\na good legacy from the parents. This must be followed by care-\nful training and the formation of right habits. God directed that [562]\nthe future judge and deliverer of Israel should be trained to strict\n512 Patriarchs and Prophets\ntemperance from infancy. He was to be a Nazarite from his birth,\nthus being placed under a perpetual prohibition against the use of\nwine or strong drink. The lessons of temperance, self-denial, and\nself-control are to be taught to children even from babyhood.\nThe angel\u2019s prohibition included \u201cevery unclean thing.\u201d The\ndistinction between articles of food as clean and unclean was not\na merely ceremonial and arbitrary regulation, but was based upon\nsanitary principles. To the observance of this distinction may be\ntraced, in a great degree, the marvelous vitality which for thousands\nof years has distinguished the Jewish people. The principles of\ntemperance must be carried further than the mere use of spirituous\nliquors. The use of stimulating and indigestible food is often equally\ninjurious to health, and in many cases sows the seeds of drunkenness.\nTrue temperance teaches us to dispense entirely with everything\nhurtful and to use judiciously that which is healthful. There are few\nwho realize as they should how much their habits of diet have to do\nwith their health, their character, their usefulness in this world, and\ntheir eternal destiny. The appetite should ever be in subjection to the\nmoral and intellectual powers. The body should be servant to the\nmind, and not the mind to the body.\nThe divine promise to Manoah was in due time fulfilled in the\nbirth of a son, to whom the name of Samson was given. As the boy\ngrew up it became evident that he possessed extraordinary physical\nstrength. This was not, however, as Samson and his parents well\nknew, dependent upon his well-knit sinews, but upon his condition\nas a Nazarite, of which his unshorn hair was a symbol. Had Samson\nobeyed the divine commands as faithfully as his parents had done,\nhis would have been a nobler and happier destiny. But association\nwith idolaters corrupted him. The town of Zorah being near the\ncountry of the Philistines, Samson came to mingle with them on\nfriendly terms. Thus in his youth intimacies sprang up, the influence\nof which darkened his whole life. A young woman dwelling in the\nPhilistine town of Timnath engaged Samson\u2019s affections, and he\ndetermined to make her his wife. To his God-fearing parents, who\nendeavored to dissuade him from his purpose, his only answer was,\n\u201cShe pleaseth me well.\u201d The parents at last yielded to his wishes,\nand the marriage took place.\nJust as he was entering upon manhood, the time when he must ex-[563]\nSamson 513\necute his divine mission\u2014the time above all others when he should\nhave been true to God\u2014Samson connected himself with the ene-\nmies of Israel. He did not ask whether he could better glorify God\nwhen united with the object of his choice, or whether he was placing\nhimself in a position where he could not fulfill the purpose to be\naccomplished by his life. To all who seek first to honor Him, God\nhas promised wisdom; but there is no promise to those who are bent\nupon self-pleasing.\nHow many are pursuing the same course as did Samson! How\noften marriages are formed between the godly and the ungodly,\nbecause inclination governs in the selection of husband or wife!\nThe parties do not ask counsel of God, nor have His glory in view.\nChristianity ought to have a controlling influence upon the marriage\nrelation, but it is too often the case that the motives which lead to\nthis union are not in keeping with Christian principles. Satan is\nconstantly seeking to strengthen his power over the people of God\nby inducing them to enter into alliance with his subjects; and in order\nto accomplish this he endeavors to arouse unsanctified passions in\nthe heart. But the Lord has in His word plainly instructed His people\nnot to unite themselves with those who have not His love abiding in\nthem. \u201cWhat concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he\nthat believeth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple\nof God with idols?\u201d 2 Corinthians 6:15, 16.\nAt his marriage feast Samson was brought into familiar associa-\ntion with those who hated the God of Israel. Whoever voluntarily\nenters into such relations will feel it necessary to conform, to some\ndegree, to the habits and customs of his companions. The time thus\nspent is worse than wasted. Thoughts are entertained and words are\nspoken that tend to break down the strongholds of principle and to\nweaken the citadel of the soul.\nThe wife, to obtain whom Samson had transgressed the com-\nmand of God, proved treacherous to her husband before the close\nof the marriage feast. Incensed at her perfidy, Samson forsook her\nfor the time, and went alone to his home at Zorah. When, afterward\nrelenting, he returned for his bride, he found her the wife of another.\nHis revenge, in the wasting of all the fields and vineyards of the\nPhilistines, provoked them to murder her, although their threats had\ndriven her to the deceit with which the trouble began. Samson had [564]\n514 Patriarchs and Prophets\nalready given evidence of his marvelous strength by slaying, single-\nhanded, a young lion, and by killing thirty of the men of Askelon.\nNow, moved to anger by the barbarous murder of his wife, he at-\ntacked the Philistines and smote them \u201cwith a great slaughter.\u201d Then,\nwishing a safe retreat from his enemies, he withdrew to \u201cthe rock\nEtam,\u201d in the tribe of Judah.\nTo this place he was pursued by a strong force, and the inhab-\nitants of Judah, in great alarm, basely agreed to deliver him to his\nenemies. Accordingly three thousand men of Judah went up to him.\nBut even at such odds they would not have dared approach him had\nthey not felt assured that he would not harm his own countrymen.\nSamson consented to be bound and delivered to the Philistines, but\nfirst exacted from the men of Judah a promise not to attack him\nthemselves, and thus compel him to destroy them. He permitted\nthem to bind him with two new ropes, and he was led into the camp\nof his enemies amid demonstrations of great joy. But while their\nshouts were waking the echoes of the hills, \u201cthe Spirit of Jehovah\ncame mightily upon him.\u201d He burst asunder the strong new cords as\nif they had been flax burned in the fire. Then seizing the first weapon\nat hand, which, though only the jawbone of an ass, was rendered\nmore effective than sword or spear, he smote the Philistines until\nthey fled in terror, leaving a thousand men dead upon the field.\nHad the Israelites been ready to unite with Samson and follow\nup the victory, they might at this time have freed themselves from\nthe power of their oppressors. But they had become dispirited and\ncowardly. They had neglected the work which God commanded\nthem to perform, in dispossessing the heathen, and had united with\nthem in their degrading practices, tolerating their cruelty, and, so\nlong as it was not directed against themselves, even countenancing\ntheir injustice. When themselves brought under the power of the\noppressor, they tamely submitted to the degradation which they\nmight have escaped, had they only obeyed God. Even when the\nLord raised up a deliverer for them, they would, not infrequently,\ndesert him and unite with their enemies.\nAfter his victory the Israelites made Samson judge, and he ruled\nIsrael for twenty years. But one wrong step prepares the way for[565]\nanother. Samson had transgressed the command of God by taking\na wife from the Philistines, and again he ventured among them\u2014\nSamson 515\nnow his deadly enemies\u2014in the indulgence of unlawful passion.\nTrusting to his great strength, which had inspired the Philistines with\nsuch terror, he went boldly to Gaza, to visit a harlot of that place.\nThe inhabitants of the city learned of his presence, and they were\neager for revenge. Their enemy was shut safely within the walls of\nthe most strongly fortified of all their cities; they felt sure of their\nprey, and only waited till the morning to complete their triumph. At\nmidnight Samson was aroused. The accusing voice of conscience\nfilled him with remorse, as he remembered that he had broken his\nvow as a Nazarite. But notwithstanding his sin, God\u2019s mercy had not\nforsaken him. His prodigious strength again served to deliver him.\nGoing to the city gate, he wrenched it from its place and carried it,\nwith its posts and bars, to the top of a hill on the way to Hebron.\nBut even this narrow escape did not stay his evil course. He did\nnot again venture among the Philistines, but he continued to seek\nthose sensuous pleasures that were luring him to ruin. \u201cHe loved\na woman in the valley of Sorek,\u201d not far from his own birthplace.\nHer name was Delilah, \u201cthe consumer.\u201d The vale of Sorek was cele-\nbrated for its vineyards; these also had a temptation for the wavering\nNazarite, who had already indulged in the use of wine, thus breaking\nanother tie that bound him to purity and to God. The Philistines kept\na vigilant watch over the movements of their enemy, and when he\ndegraded himself by this new attachment, they determined, through\nDelilah, to accomplish his ruin.\nA deputation consisting of one leading man from each of the\nPhilistine provinces was sent to the vale of Sorek. They dared not\nattempt to seize him while in possession of his great strength, but it\nwas their purpose to learn, if possible, the secret of his power. They\ntherefore bribed Delilah to discover and reveal it.\nAs the betrayer plied Samson with her questions, he deceived\nher by declaring that the weakness of other men would come upon\nhim if certain processes were tried. When she put the matter to the\ntest, the cheat was discovered. Then she accused him of falsehood,\nsaying, \u201cHow canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not\nwith me? Thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told [566]\nme wherein thy great strength lieth.\u201d Three times Samson had the\nclearest evidence that the Philistines had leagued with his charmer\n516 Patriarchs and Prophets\nto destroy him; but when her purpose failed, she treated the matter\nas a jest, and he blindly banished fear.\nDay by day Delilah urged him, until \u201chis soul was vexed unto\ndeath;\u201d yet a subtle power kept him by her side. Overcome at last,\nSamson made known the secret: \u201cThere hath not come a razor upon\nmine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother\u2019s\nwomb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I\nshall become weak, and be like any other man.\u201d A messenger was\nimmediately dispatched to the lords of the Philistines, urging them\nto come to her without delay. While the warrior slept, the heavy\nmasses of his hair were severed from his head. Then, as she had\ndone three times before, she called, \u201cThe Philistines be upon thee,\nSamson!\u201d Suddenly awaking, he thought to exert his strength as\nbefore and destroy them; but his powerless arms refused to do his\nbidding, and he knew that \u201cJehovah was departed from him.\u201d When\nhe had been shaven, Delilah began to annoy him and cause him\npain, thus making a trial of his strength; for the Philistines dared not\napproach him till fully convinced that his power was gone. Then\nthey seized him and, having put out both his eyes, they took him\nto Gaza. Here he was bound with fetters in their prison house and\nconfined to hard labor.\nWhat a change to him who had been the judge and champion of\nIsrael!\u2014now weak, blind, imprisoned, degraded to the most menial\nservice! Little by little he had violated the conditions of his sacred\ncalling. God had borne long with him; but when he had so yielded\nhimself to the power of sin as to betray his secret, the Lord departed\nfrom him. There was no virtue in his long hair merely, but it was\na token of his loyalty to God; and when the symbol was sacrificed\nin the indulgence of passion, the blessings of which it was a token\nwere also forfeited.\nIn suffering and humiliation, a sport for the Philistines, Samson\nlearned more of his own weakness than he had ever known before;\nand his afflictions led him to repentance. As his hair grew, his power\ngradually returned; but his enemies, regarding him as a fettered and\nhelpless prisoner, felt no apprehensions.\nThe Philistines ascribed their victory to their gods; and, exulting,[567]\nthey defied the God of Israel. A feast was appointed in honor of\nDagon, the fish god, \u201cthe protector of the sea.\u201d From town and\nSamson 517\ncountry throughout the Philistine plain the people and their lords\nassembled. Throngs of worshipers filled the vast temple and crowded\nthe galleries about the roof. It was a scene of festivity and rejoicing.\nThere was the pomp of the sacrificial service, followed by music\nand feasting. Then, as the crowning trophy of Dagon\u2019s power,\nSamson was brought in. Shouts of exultation greeted his appearance.\nPeople and rulers mocked his misery and adored the god who had\noverthrown \u201cthe destroyer of their country.\u201d After a time, as if weary,\nSamson asked permission to rest against the two central pillars\nwhich supported the temple roof. Then he silently uttered the prayer,\n\u201cO Lord God, remember me, I pray Thee, and strengthen me, I\npray Thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged\nof the Philistines.\u201d With these words he encircled the pillars with\nhis mighty arms; and crying, \u201cLet me die with the Philistines!\u201d he\nbowed himself, and the roof fell, destroying at one crash all that vast\nmultitude. \u201cSo the dead which he slew at his death were more than\nthey which he slew in his life.\u201d\nThe idol and its worshipers, priest and peasant, warrior and\nnoble, were buried together beneath the ruins of Dagon\u2019s temple.\nAnd among them was the giant form of him whom God had chosen\nto be the deliverer of His people. Tidings of the terrible overthrow\nwere carried to the land of Israel, and Samson\u2019s kinsmen came down\nfrom their hills, and, unopposed, rescued the body of the fallen\nhero. And they \u201cbrought him up, and buried him between Zorah and\nEshtaol, in the burying place of Manoah his father.\u201d\nGod\u2019s promise that through Samson He would \u201cbegin to deliver\nIsrael out of the hand of the Philistines\u201d was fulfilled; but how dark\nand terrible the record of that life which might have been a praise to\nGod and a glory to the nation! Had Samson been true to his divine\ncalling, the purpose of God could have been accomplished in his\nhonor and exaltation. But he yielded to temptation and proved untrue\nto his trust, and his mission was fulfilled in defeat, bondage, and\ndeath.\nPhysically, Samson was the strongest man upon the earth; but in\nself-control, integrity, and firmness, he was one of the weakest of\nmen. Many mistake strong passions for a strong character, but the [568]\ntruth is that he who is mastered by his passions is a weak man. The\n518 Patriarchs and Prophets\nreal greatness of the man is measured by the power of the feelings\nthat he controls, not by those that control him.\nGod\u2019s providential care had been over Samson, that he might be\nprepared to accomplish the work which he was called to do. At the\nvery outset of life he was surrounded with favorable conditions for\nphysical strength, intellectual vigor, and moral purity. But under the\ninfluence of wicked associates he let go that hold upon God which\nis man\u2019s only safeguard, and he was swept away by the tide of evil.\nThose who in the way of duty are brought into trial may be sure that\nGod will preserve them; but if men willfully place themselves under\nthe power of temptation, they will fall, sooner or later.\nThe very ones whom God purposes to use as His instruments\nfor a special work, Satan employs his utmost power to lead astray.\nHe attacks us at our weak points, working through defects in the\ncharacter to gain control of the whole man; and he knows that if these\ndefects are cherished, he will succeed. But none need be overcome.\nMan is not left alone to conquer the power of evil by his own feeble\nefforts. Help is at hand and will be given to every soul who really\ndesires it. Angels of God, that ascend and descend the ladder which\nJacob saw in vision, will help every soul who will, to climb even to\nthe highest heaven.\nChapter 55\u2014The Child Samuel [569]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Samuel 1; 2:1-11.\nElkanah, a Levite of Mount Ephraim, was a man of wealth and\ninfluence, and one who loved and feared the Lord. His wife, Hannah,\nwas a woman of fervent piety. Gentle and unassuming, her character\nwas marked with deep earnestness and a lofty faith.\nThe blessing so earnestly sought by every Hebrew was denied\nthis godly pair; their home was not gladdened by the voice of child-\nhood; and the desire to perpetuate his name led the husband\u2014as\nit had led many others\u2014to contract a second marriage. But this\nstep, prompted by a lack of faith in God, did not bring happiness.\nSons and daughters were added to the household; but the joy and\nbeauty of God\u2019s sacred institution had been marred and the peace\nof the family was broken. Peninnah, the new wife, was jealous and\nnarrow-minded, and she bore herself with pride and insolence. To\nHannah, hope seemed crushed and life a weary burden; yet she met\nthe trial with uncomplaining meekness.\nElkanah faithfully observed the ordinances of God. The worship\nat Shiloh was still maintained, but on account of irregularities in\nthe ministration his services were not required at the sanctuary, to\nwhich, being a Levite, he was to give attendance. Yet he went up\nwith his family to worship and sacrifice at the appointed gatherings.\nEven amid the sacred festivities connected with the service of\nGod the evil spirit that had cursed his home intruded. After present-\ning the thank offerings, all the family, according to the established\ncustom, united in a solemn yet joyous feast. Upon these occasions\nElkanah gave the mother of his children a portion for herself and\nfor each of her sons and daughters; and in token of regard for Han-\nnah, he gave her a double portion, signifying that his affection for\nher was the same as if she had had a son. Then the second wife,\nfired with jealousy, claimed the precedence as one highly favored [570]\nof God, and taunted Hannah with her childless state as evidence of\n519\n520 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe Lord\u2019s displeasure. This was repeated from year to year, until\nHannah could endure it no longer. Unable to hide her grief, she wept\nwithout restraint, and withdrew from the feast. Her husband vainly\nsought to comfort her. \u201cWhy weepest thou? and why eatest thou\nnot? and why is thy heart grieved?\u201d he said; \u201cam I not better to thee\nthan ten sons?\u201d\nHannah uttered no reproach. The burden which she could share\nwith no earthly friend she cast upon God. Earnestly she pleaded that\nHe would take away her reproach and grant her the precious gift of\na son to nurture and train for Him. And she made a solemn vow that\nif her request were granted, she would dedicate her child to God,\neven from its birth. Hannah had drawn near to the entrance of the\ntabernacle, and in the anguish of her spirit she \u201cprayed, ... and wept\nsore.\u201d Yet she communed with God in silence, uttering no sound.\nIn those evil times such scenes of worship were rarely witnessed.\nIrreverent feasting and even drunkenness were not uncommon, even\nat the religious festivals; and Eli the high priest, observing Hannah,\nsupposed that she was overcome with wine. Thinking to administer\na deserved rebuke, he said sternly, \u201cHow long wilt thou be drunken?\nput away thy wine from thee.\u201d\nPained and startled, Hannah answered gently, \u201cNo, my lord, I am\na woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong\ndrink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord. Count not thine\nhandmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my\ncomplaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.\u201d\nThe high priest was deeply moved, for he was a man of God;\nand in place of rebuke he uttered a blessing: \u201cGo in peace: and the\nGod of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of Him.\u201d\nHannah\u2019s prayer was granted; she received the gift for which\nshe had so earnestly entreated. As she looked upon the child, she\ncalled him Samuel\u2014\u201casked of God.\u201d As soon as the little one was\nold enough to be separated from his mother, she fulfilled her vow.\nShe loved her child with all the devotion of a mother\u2019s heart; day\nby day, as she watched his expanding powers and listened to his\nchildish prattle, her affections entwined about him more closely. He[571]\nwas her only son, the special gift of Heaven; but she had received\nhim as a treasure consecrated to God, and she would not withhold\nfrom the Giver His own.\nChild Samuel 521\nOnce more Hannah journeyed with her husband to Shiloh and\npresented to the priest, in the name of God, her precious gift, saying,\n\u201cFor this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition\nwhich I asked of Him: therefore also I have lent him to the Lord;\nas long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord.\u201d Eli was deeply\nimpressed by the faith and devotion of this woman of Israel. Himself\nan overindulgent father, he was awed and humbled as he beheld\nthis mother\u2019s great sacrifice in parting with her only child, that she\nmight devote him to the service of God. He felt reproved for his own\nselfish love, and in humiliation and reverence he bowed before the\nLord and worshiped.\nThe mother\u2019s heart was filled with joy and praise, and she longed\nto pour forth her gratitude to God. The Spirit of Inspiration came\nupon her; \u201cand Hannah prayed, and said:\n\u201cMy heart rejoiceth in the Lord;\nMine horn is exalted in the Lord;\nMy mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;\nBecause I rejoice in Thy salvation.\nThere is none holy as the Lord:\nFor there is none beside Thee:\nNeither is there any rock like our God.\nTalk no more so exceeding proudly;\nLet not arrogancy come out of your mouth;\nFor Jehovah is a God of knowledge,\nAnd by Him actions are weighed....\nThe Lord killeth, and maketh alive:\nHe bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.\nThe Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich:\nHe bringeth low, and lifteth up.\nHe raiseth up the poor out of the dust,\nAnd lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill,\nTo set them among princes,\nAnd to make them inherit the throne of glory:\nFor the pillars of the earth are the Lord\u2019s,\nAnd He hath set the world upon them.\nHe will keep the feet of His saints,\nAnd the wicked shall be silent in darkness;\n522 Patriarchs and Prophets\nFor by strength shall no man prevail.\nThe adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces;\nOut of heaven shall He thunder upon them: [572]\nThe Lord shall judge the ends of the earth;\nAnd He shall give strength unto His king,\nAnd exalt the horn of His anointed.\u201d\nHannah\u2019s words were prophetic, both of David, who should reign\nas king of Israel, and of the Messiah, the Lord\u2019s Anointed. Referring\nfirst to the boasting of an insolent and contentious woman, the song\npoints to the destruction of the enemies of God and the final triumph\nof His redeemed people.\nFrom Shiloh, Hannah quietly returned to her home at Ramah,\nleaving the child Samuel to be trained for service in the house of\nGod, under the instruction of the high priest. From the earliest dawn\nof intellect she had taught her son to love and reverence God and to\nregard himself as the Lord\u2019s. By every familiar object surrounding\nhim she had sought to lead his thoughts up to the Creator. When\nseparated from her child, the faithful mother\u2019s solicitude did not\ncease. Every day he was the subject of her prayers. Every year she\nmade, with her own hands, a robe of service for him; and as she\nwent up with her husband to worship at Shiloh, she gave the child\nthis reminder of her love. Every fiber of the little garment had been\nwoven with a prayer that he might be pure, noble, and true. She did\nnot ask for her son worldly greatness, but she earnestly pleaded that\nhe might attain that greatness which Heaven values\u2014that he might\nhonor God and bless his fellow men.\nWhat a reward was Hannah\u2019s! and what an encouragement to\nfaithfulness is her example! There are opportunities of inestimable\nworth, interests infinitely precious, committed to every mother. The\nhumble round of duties which women have come to regard as a\nwearisome task should be looked upon as a grand and noble work. It\nis the mother\u2019s privilege to bless the world by her influence, and in\ndoing this she will bring joy to her own heart. She may make straight\npaths for the feet of her children, through sunshine and shadow, to\nthe glorious heights above. But it is only when she seeks, in her own\nlife, to follow the teachings of Christ that the mother can hope to\nform the character of her children after the divine pattern. The world\nChild Samuel 523\nteems with corrupting influences. Fashion and custom exert a strong\npower over the young. If the mother fails in her duty to instruct,\nguide, and restrain, her children will naturally accept the evil, and\nturn from the good. Let every mother go often to her Saviour with [573]\nthe prayer, \u201cTeach us, how shall we order the child, and what shall\nwe do unto him?\u201d Let her heed the instruction which God has given\nin His word, and wisdom will be given her as she shall have need.\n\u201cThe child Samuel grew on, and was in favor both with the\nLord, and also with men.\u201d Though Samuel\u2019s youth was passed at\nthe tabernacle devoted to the worship of God, he was not free from\nevil influences or sinful example. The sons of Eli feared not God,\nnor honored their father; but Samuel did not seek their company nor\nfollow their evil ways. It was his constant endeavor to become what\nGod would have him. This is the privilege of every youth. God is\npleased when even little children give themselves to His service.\nSamuel had been placed under the care of Eli, and the loveliness\nof his character drew forth the warm affection of the aged priest.\nHe was kind, generous, obedient, and respectful. Eli, pained by the\nwaywardness of his own sons, found rest and comfort and blessing\nin the presence of his charge. Samuel was helpful and affectionate,\nand no father ever loved his child more tenderly than did Eli this\nyouth. It was a singular thing that between the chief magistrate of\nthe nation and the simple child so warm an affection should exist. As\nthe infirmities of age came upon Eli, and he was filled with anxiety\nand remorse by the profligate course of his own sons, he turned to\nSamuel for comfort.\nIt was not customary for the Levites to enter upon their peculiar\nservices until they were twenty-five years of age, but Samuel had\nbeen an exception to this rule. Every year saw more important trusts\ncommitted to him; and while he was yet a child, a linen ephod\nwas placed upon him as a token of his consecration to the work of\nthe sanctuary. Young as he was when brought to minister in the\ntabernacle, Samuel had even then duties to perform in the service\nof God, according to his capacity. These were at first very humble,\nand not always pleasant; but they were performed to the best of his\nability, and with a willing heart. His religion was carried into every\nduty of life. He regarded himself as God\u2019s servant, and his work as\nGod\u2019s work. His efforts were accepted, because they were prompted\n524 Patriarchs and Prophets\nby love to God and a sincere desire to do His will. It was thus that\nSamuel became a co-worker with the Lord of heaven and earth. And[574]\nGod fitted him to accomplish a great work for Israel.\nIf children were taught to regard the humble round of everyday\nduties as the course marked out for them by the Lord, as a school in\nwhich they were to be trained to render faithful and efficient service,\nhow much more pleasant and honorable would their work appear.\nTo perform every duty as unto the Lord, throws a charm around the\nhumblest employment and links the workers on earth with the holy\nbeings who do God\u2019s will in heaven.\nSuccess in this life, success in gaining the future life, depends\nupon a faithful, conscientious attention to the little things. Perfection\nis seen in the least, no less than in the greatest, of the works of God.\nThe hand that hung the worlds in space is the hand that wrought\nwith delicate skill the lilies of the field. And as God is perfect in His\nsphere, so we are to be perfect in ours. The symmetrical structure\nof a strong, beautiful character is built up by individual acts of duty.\nAnd faithfulness should characterize our life in the least as well as in\nthe greatest of its details. Integrity in little things, the performance\nof little acts of fidelity and little deeds of kindness, will gladden the\npath of life; and when our work on earth is ended, it will be found\nthat every one of the little duties faithfully performed has exerted an\ninfluence for good\u2014an influence that can never perish.\nThe youth of our time may become as precious in the sight\nof God as was Samuel. By faithfully maintaining their Christian\nintegrity, they may exert a strong influence in the work of reform.\nSuch men are needed at this time. God has a work for every one of\nthem. Never did men achieve greater results for God and humanity\nthan may be achieved in this our day by those who will be faithful\nto their God-given trust.\nChapter 56\u2014Eli and His Sons [575]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Samuel 2:12-36.\nEli was priest and judge in Israel. He held the highest and most\nresponsible positions among the people of God. As a man divinely\nchosen for the sacred duties of the priesthood, and set over the land as\nthe highest judicial authority, he was looked up to as an example, and\nhe wielded a great influence over the tribes of Israel. But although\nhe had been appointed to govern the people, he did not rule his own\nhousehold. Eli was an indulgent father. Loving peace and ease, he\ndid not exercise his authority to correct the evil habits and passions\nof his children. Rather than contend with them or punish them, he\nwould submit to their will and give them their own way. Instead of\nregarding the education of his sons as one of the most important of\nhis responsibilities, he treated the matter as of little consequence.\nThe priest and judge of Israel had not been left in darkness as to the\nduty of restraining and governing the children that God had given to\nhis care. But Eli shrank from this duty, because it involved crossing\nthe will of his sons, and would make it necessary to punish and deny\nthem. Without weighing the terrible consequences that would follow\nhis course, he indulged his children in whatever they desired and\nneglected the work of fitting them for the service of God and the\nduties of life.\nGod had said of Abraham, \u201cI know him, that he will command\nhis children and his household after him, and they shall keep the\nway of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.\u201d Genesis 18:19. But Eli\nallowed his children to control him. The father became subject to the\nchildren. The curse of transgression was apparent in the corruption\nand evil that marked the course of his sons. They had no proper\nappreciation of the character of God or of the sacredness of His law.\nHis service was to them a common thing. From childhood they\nhad been accustomed to the sanctuary and its service; but instead of\nbecoming more reverent, they had lost all sense of its holiness and [576]\n525\n526 Patriarchs and Prophets\nsignificance. The father had not corrected their want of reverence\nfor his authority, had not checked their disrespect for the solemn\nservices of the sanctuary; and when they reached manhood, they\nwere full of the deadly fruits of skepticism and rebellion.\nThough wholly unfit for the office, they were placed as priests in\nthe sanctuary to minister before God. The Lord had given the most\nspecific directions in regard to offering sacrifices; but these wicked\nmen carried their disregard of authority into the service of God, and\ndid not give attention to the law of the offerings, which were to be\nmade in the most solemn manner. The sacrifices, pointing forward\nto the death of Christ, were designed to preserve in the hearts of the\npeople faith in the Redeemer to come; hence it was of the greatest\nimportance that the Lord\u2019s directions concerning them should be\nstrictly heeded. The peace offerings were especially an expression\nof thanksgiving to God. In these offerings the fat alone was to be\nburned upon the altar; a certain specified portion was reserved for\nthe priests, but the greater part was returned to the offerer, to be\neaten by him and his friends in a sacrificial feast. Thus all hearts\nwere to be directed, in gratitude and faith, to the great Sacrifice that\nwas to take away the sin of the world.\nThe sons of Eli, instead of realizing the solemnity of this sym-\nbolic service, only thought how they could make it a means of\nself-indulgence. Not content with the part of the peace offerings\nallotted them, they demanded an additional portion; and the great\nnumber of these sacrifices presented at the annual feasts gave the\npriests an opportunity to enrich themselves at the expense of the\npeople. They not only demanded more than their right, but refused\nto wait even until the fat had been burned as an offering to God.\nThey persisted in claiming whatever portion pleased them, and, if\ndenied, threatened to take it by violence.\nThis irreverence on the part of the priests soon robbed the service\nof its holy and solemn significance, and the people \u201cabhorred the\noffering of the Lord.\u201d The great antitypical sacrifice to which they\nwere to look forward was no longer recognized. \u201cWherefore the sin\nof the young men was very great before the Lord.\u201d\nThese unfaithful priests also transgressed God\u2019s law and dishon-\nored their sacred office by their vile and degrading practices; yet[577]\nthey continued to pollute by their presence the tabernacle of God.\nEli and His Sons 527\nMany of the people, filled with indignation at the corrupt course of\nHophni and Phinehas, ceased to come up to the appointed place of\nworship. Thus the service which God had ordained was despised\nand neglected because associated with the sins of wicked men, while\nthose whose hearts were inclined to evil were emboldened in sin.\nUngodliness, profligacy, and even idolatry prevailed to a fearful\nextent.\nEli had greatly erred in permitting his sons to minister in holy\noffice. By excusing their course, on one pretext and another, he\nbecame blinded to their sins; but at last they reached a pass where\nhe could no longer hide his eyes from the crimes of his sons. The\npeople complained of their violent deeds, and the high priest was\ngrieved and distressed. He dared remain silent no longer. But his\nsons had been brought up to think of no one but themselves, and now\nthey cared for no one else. They saw the grief of their father, but\ntheir hard hearts were not touched. They heard his mild admonitions,\nbut they were not impressed, nor would they change their evil course\nthough warned of the consequences of their sins. Had Eli dealt\njustly with his wicked sons, they would have been rejected from\nthe priestly office and punished with death. Dreading thus to bring\npublic disgrace and condemnation upon them, he sustained them in\nthe most sacred positions of trust. He still permitted them to mingle\ntheir corruption with the holy service of God and to inflict upon the\ncause of truth an injury which years could not efface. But when the\njudge of Israel neglected his work, God took the matter in hand.\n\u201cThere came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus\nsaith the Lord, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father,\nwhen they were in Egypt in Pharaoh\u2019s house? And did I choose him\nout of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to offer upon Mine\naltar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? and did I give\nunto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the\nchildren of Israel? Wherefore kick ye at My sacrifice and at Mine\noffering, which I have commanded in My habitation; and honorest\nthy sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all\nthe offerings of Israel My people? Wherefore the Lord God of Israel\nsaith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should\nwalk before Me forever: but now the Lord saith, Be it far from Me;\nfor them that honor Me I will honor, and they that despise Me shall [578]\n528 Patriarchs and Prophets\nbe lightly esteemed.... And I will raise Me up a faithful priest, that\nshall do according to that which is in Mine heart and in My mind:\nand I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before Mine\nanointed forever.\u201d\nGod charged Eli with honoring his sons above the Lord. Eli had\npermitted the offering appointed by God as a blessing to Israel to\nbe made a thing of abhorrence, rather than bring his sons to shame\nfor their impious and abominable practices. Those who follow their\nown inclination, in blind affection for their children, indulging them\nin the gratification of their selfish desires, and do not bring to bear\nthe authority of God to rebuke sin and correct evil, make it manifest\nthat they are honoring their wicked children more than they honor\nGod. They are more anxious to shield their reputation than to glorify\nGod; more desirous to please their children than to please the Lord\nand to keep His service from every appearance of evil.\nGod held Eli, as a priest and judge of Israel, accountable for the\nmoral and religious standing of his people, and in a special sense\nfor the character of his sons. He should first have attempted to\nrestrain evil by mild measures; but if these did not avail, he should\nhave subdued the wrong by the severest means. He incurred the\nLord\u2019s displeasure by not reproving sin and executing justice upon\nthe sinner. He could not be depended upon to keep Israel pure.\nThose who have too little courage to reprove wrong, or who through\nindolence or lack of interest make no earnest effort to purify the\nfamily or the church of God, are held accountable for the evil that\nmay result from their neglect of duty. We are just as responsible for\nevils that we might have checked in others by exercise of parental or\npastoral authority as if the acts had been our own.\nEli did not manage his household according to God\u2019s rules for\nfamily government. He followed his own judgment. The fond\nfather overlooked the faults and sins of his sons in their childhood,\nflattering himself that after a time they would outgrow their evil\ntendencies. Many are now making a similar mistake. They think\nthey know a better way of training their children than that which\nGod has given in His word. They foster wrong tendencies in them,\nurging as an excuse, \u201cThey are too young to be punished. Wait till\nthey become older, and can be reasoned with.\u201d Thus wrong habits\nare left to strengthen until they become second nature. The children[579]\nEli and His Sons 529\ngrow up without restraint, with traits of character that are a lifelong\ncurse to them and are liable to be reproduced in others.\nThere is no greater curse upon households than to allow the\nyouth to have their own way. When parents regard every wish of\ntheir children and indulge them in what they know is not for their\ngood, the children soon lose all respect for their parents, all regard\nfor the authority of God or man, and are led captive at the will of\nSatan. The influence of an ill-regulated family is widespread and\ndisastrous to all society. It accumulates in a tide of evil that affects\nfamilies, communities, and governments.\nBecause of Eli\u2019s position, his influence was more extended than\nif he had been an ordinary man. His family life was imitated through-\nout Israel. The baleful results of his negligent, ease-loving ways\nwere seen in thousands of homes that were molded by his example.\nIf children are indulged in evil practices, while the parents make\na profession of religion, the truth of God is brought into reproach.\nThe best test of the Christianity of a home is the type of character\nbegotten by its influence. Actions speak louder than the most pos-\nitive profession of godliness. If professors of religion, instead of\nputting forth earnest, persistent, and painstaking effort to bring up a\nwell-ordered household as a witness to the benefits of faith in God,\nare lax in their government and indulgent to the evil desires of their\nchildren, they are doing as did Eli, and are bringing disgrace on the\ncause of Christ and ruin upon themselves and their households. But\ngreat as are the evils of parental unfaithfulness under any circum-\nstances, they are tenfold greater when they exist in the families of\nthose appointed as teachers of the people. When these fail to control\ntheir own households, they are, by their wrong example, misleading\nmany. Their guilt is as much greater than that of others as their\nposition is more responsible.\nThe promise had been made that the house of Aaron should walk\nbefore God forever; but this promise had been made on condition\nthat they should devote themselves to the work of the sanctuary with\nsingleness of heart and honor God in all their ways, not serving self\nnor following their own perverse inclinations. Eli and his sons had\nbeen tested, and the Lord had found them wholly unworthy of the\nexalted position of priests in His service. And God declared, \u201cBe it\nfar from Me.\u201d He could not accomplish the good that He had meant [580]\n530 Patriarchs and Prophets\nto do them, because they failed to do their part.\nThe example of those who minister in holy things should be\nsuch as to impress the people with reverence for God and with\nfear to offend Him. When men, standing \u201cin Christ\u2019s stead\u201d (2\nCorinthians 5:20) to speak to the people God\u2019s message of mercy\nand reconciliation, use their sacred calling as a cloak for selfish or\nsensual gratification, they make themselves the most effective agents\nof Satan. Like Hophni and Phinehas, they cause men to \u201cabhor the\noffering of the Lord.\u201d They may pursue their evil course in secret\nfor a time; but when at last their true character is exposed, the faith\nof the people receives a shock that often results in destroying their\nconfidence in religion. There is left upon the mind a distrust of all\nwho profess to teach the word of God. The message of the true\nservant of Christ is doubtfully received. The question constantly\narises, \u201cWill not this man prove to be like the one we thought so\nholy, and found so corrupt?\u201d Thus the word of God loses its power\nupon the souls of men.\nIn Eli\u2019s reproof to his sons are words of solemn and fearful\nimport\u2014words that all who minister in sacred things would do well\nto ponder: \u201cIf one man sin against another, the judge shall judge\nhim; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him?\u201d\nHad their crimes injured only their fellow men, the judge might\nhave made reconciliation by appointing a penalty and requiring\nrestitution; and thus the offenders might have been pardoned. Or had\nthey not been guilty of a presumptuous sin, a sin offering might have\nbeen presented for them. But their sins were so interwoven with\ntheir ministration as priests of the Most High, in offering sacrifice\nfor sin, the work of God was so profaned and dishonored before\nthe people, that no expiation could be accepted for them. Their\nown father, though himself high priest, dared not make intercession\nin their behalf; he could not shield them from the wrath of a holy\nGod. Of all sinners, those are most guilty who cast contempt upon\nthe means that Heaven has provided for man\u2019s redemption\u2014who\n\u201ccrucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put Him to an\nopen shame.\u201d Hebrews 6:6.\nChapter 57\u2014The Ark Taken by the Philistines [581]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Samuel 3 to 7.\nAnother warning was to be given to Eli\u2019s house. God could not\ncommunicate with the high priest and his sons; their sins, like a thick\ncloud, had shut out the presence of His Holy Spirit. But in the midst\nof evil the child Samuel remained true to Heaven, and the message\nof condemnation to the house of Eli was Samuel\u2019s commission as a\nprophet of the Most High.\n\u201cThe word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was\nno open vision. And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid\ndown in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not\nsee; and ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord,\nwhere the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; that\nthe Lord called Samuel.\u201d Supposing the voice to be that of Eli, the\nchild hastened to the bedside of the priest, saying, \u201cHere am I; for\nthou calledst me.\u201d The answer was, \u201cI called not, my son; lie down\nagain.\u201d Three times Samuel was called, and thrice he responded in\nlike manner. And then Eli was convinced that the mysterious call\nwas the voice of God. The Lord had passed by His chosen servant,\nthe man of hoary hairs, to commune with a child. This in itself was\na bitter yet deserved rebuke to Eli and his house.\nNo feeling of envy or jealousy was awakened in Eli\u2019s heart. He\ndirected Samuel to answer, if again called, \u201cSpeak, Lord; for Thy\nservant heareth.\u201d Once more the voice was heard, and the child\nanswered, \u201cSpeak; for Thy servant heareth.\u201d So awed was he at the\nthought that the great God should speak to him that he could not\nremember the exact words which Eli bade him say.\n\u201cAnd the Lord said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,\nat which both the ears of everyone that heareth it shall tingle. In\nthat day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken\nconcerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end. For [582]\nI have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity\n531\n532 Patriarchs and Prophets\nwhich he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he\nrestrained them not. And therefore I have sworn unto the house of\nEli, that the iniquity of Eli\u2019s house shall not be purged with sacrifice\nnor offering forever.\u201d\nBefore receiving this message from God, \u201cSamuel did not yet\nknow the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto\nhim;\u201d that is, he was not acquainted with such direct manifestations\nof God\u2019s presence as were granted to the prophets. It was the Lord\u2019s\npurpose to reveal Himself in an unexpected manner, that Eli might\nhear of it through the surprise and inquiry of the youth.\nSamuel was filled with fear and amazement at the thought of\nhaving so terrible a message committed to him. In the morning he\nwent about his duties as usual, but with a heavy burden upon his\nyoung heart. The Lord had not commanded him to reveal the fearful\ndenunciation, hence he remained silent, avoiding, as far as possible,\nthe presence of Eli. He trembled, lest some question should compel\nhim to declare the divine judgments against one whom he loved and\nreverenced. Eli was confident that the message foretold some great\ncalamity to him and his house. He called Samuel, and charged him\nto relate faithfully what the Lord had revealed. The youth obeyed,\nand the aged man bowed in humble submission to the appalling\nsentence. \u201cIt is the Lord,\u201d he said: \u201clet Him do what seemeth Him\ngood.\u201d\nYet Eli did not manifest the fruits of true repentance. He con-\nfessed his guilt, but failed to renounce the sin. Year after year the\nLord delayed His threatened judgments. Much might have been\ndone in those years to redeem the failures of the past, but the aged\npriest took no effective measures to correct the evils that were pollut-\ning the sanctuary of the Lord and leading thousands in Israel to ruin.\nThe forbearance of God caused Hophni and Phinehas to harden their\nhearts and to become still bolder in transgression. The messages\nof warning and reproof to his house were made known by Eli to\nthe whole nation. By this means he hoped to counteract, in some\nmeasure, the evil influence of his past neglect. But the warnings\nwere disregarded by the people, as they had been by the priests.\nThe people of surrounding nations also, who were not ignorant of\nthe iniquities openly practiced in Israel, became still bolder in their\nidolatry and crime. They felt no sense of guilt for their sins, as they\nArk Taken by the Philistines 533\nwould have felt had the Israelites preserved their integrity. But a day [583]\nof retribution was approaching. God\u2019s authority had been set aside,\nand His worship neglected and despised, and it became necessary for\nHim to interpose, that the honor of His name might be maintained.\n\u201cNow Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched\nbeside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.\u201d This ex-\npedition was undertaken by the Israelites without counsel from\nGod, without the concurrence of high priest or prophet. \u201cAnd the\nPhilistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they\njoined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew\nof the army in the field about four thousand men.\u201d As the shattered\nand disheartened force returned to their encampment, \u201cthe elders\nof Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us today before the\nPhilistines?\u201d The nation was ripe for the judgments of God, yet they\ndid not see that their own sins had been the cause of this terrible\ndisaster. And they said, \u201cLet us fetch the ark of the covenant of the\nLord out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may\nsave us out of the hand of our enemies.\u201d The Lord had given no\ncommand or permission that the ark should come into the army; yet\nthe Israelites felt confident that victory would be theirs, and uttered\na great shout when it was borne into the camp by the sons of Eli.\nThe Philistines looked upon the ark as the god of Israel. All\nthe mighty works that Jehovah had wrought for His people were\nattributed to its power. As they heard the shouts of joy at its approach,\nthey said, \u201cWhat meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp\nof the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the Lord was\ncome into the camp. And the Philistines were afraid; for they said,\nGod has come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for\nthere hath not been such a thing heretofore. Woe unto us! who shall\ndeliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? These are the Gods\nthat smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness. Be\nstrong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not\nservants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves\nlike men, and fight.\u201d\nThe Philistines made a fierce assault, which resulted in the defeat\nof Israel, with great slaughter. Thirty thousand men lay dead upon\nthe field, and the ark of God was taken, the two sons of Eli having\nfallen while fighting to defend it. Thus again was left upon the page [584]\n534 Patriarchs and Prophets\nof history a testimony for all future ages\u2014that the iniquity of God\u2019s\nprofessed people will not go unpunished. The greater the knowledge\nof God\u2019s will, the greater the sin of those who disregard it.\nThe most terrifying calamity that could occur had befallen Israel.\nThe ark of God had been captured, and was in the possession of the\nenemy. The glory had indeed departed from Israel when the symbol\nof the abiding presence and power of Jehovah was removed from\nthe midst of them. With this sacred chest were associated the most\nwonderful revelations of God\u2019s truth and power. In former days\nmiraculous victories had been achieved whenever it appeared. It was\nshadowed by the wings of the golden cherubim, and the unspeakable\nglory of the Shekinah, the visible symbol of the most high God,\nhad rested over it in the holy of holies. But now it had brought no\nvictory. It had not proved a defense on this occasion, and there was\nmourning throughout Israel.\nThey had not realized that their faith was only a nominal faith,\nand had lost its power to prevail with God. The law of God, contained\nin the ark, was also a symbol of His presence; but they had cast\ncontempt upon the commandments, had despised their requirements,\nand had grieved the Spirit of the Lord from among them. When the\npeople obeyed the holy precepts, the Lord was with them to work\nfor them by His infinite power; but when they looked upon the ark,\nand did not associate it with God, nor honor His revealed will by\nobedience to His law, it could avail them little more than a common\nbox. They looked to the ark as the idolatrous nations looked to their\ngods, as if it possessed in itself the elements of power and salvation.\nThey transgressed the law it contained; for their very worship of the\nark led to formalism, hypocrisy, and idolatry. Their sin had separated\nthem from God, and He could not give them the victory until they\nhad repented of and forsaken their iniquity.\nIt was not enough that the ark and the sanctuary were in the\nmidst of Israel. It was not enough that the priests offered sacrifices,\nand that the people were called the children of God. The Lord does\nnot regard the request of those who cherish iniquity in the heart; it is\nwritten that \u201che that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even\nhis prayer shall be abomination.\u201d Proverbs 28:9.\nWhen the army went out to battle, Eli, blind and old, had tarried[585]\nat Shiloh. It was with troubled forebodings that he awaited the result\nArk Taken by the Philistines 535\nof the conflict; \u201cfor his heart trembled for the ark of God.\u201d Taking\nhis position outside the gate of the tabernacle, he sat by the highway\nside day after day, anxiously expecting the arrival of a messenger\nfrom the battlefield.\nAt length a Benjamite from the army, \u201cwith his clothes rent, and\nwith earth upon his head,\u201d came hurrying up the ascent leading to\nthe city. Passing heedlessly the aged man beside the way, he rushed\non to the town, and repeated to eager throngs the tidings of defeat\nand loss.\nThe sound of wailing and lamentation reached the watcher beside\nthe tabernacle. The messenger was brought to him. And the man\nsaid unto Eli, \u201cIsrael is fled before the Philistines, and there hath\nbeen also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also,\nHophni and Phinehas, are dead.\u201d Eli could endure all this, terrible as\nit was, for he had expected it. But when the messenger added, \u201cAnd\nthe ark of God is taken,\u201d a look of unutterable anguish passed over\nhis countenance. The thought that his sin had thus dishonored God\nand caused Him to withdraw His presence from Israel was more\nthan he could bear; his strength was gone, he fell, \u201cand his neck\nbrake, and he died.\u201d\nThe wife of Phinehas, notwithstanding the impiety of her hus-\nband, was a woman who feared the Lord. The death of her father-in-\nlaw and her husband, and above all, the terrible tidings that the ark of\nGod was taken, caused her death. She felt that the last hope of Israel\nwas gone; and she named the child born in this hour of adversity,\nIchabod, or \u201cinglorious;\u201d with her dying breath mournfully repeating\nthe words, \u201cThe glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is\ntaken.\u201d\nBut the Lord had not wholly cast aside His people, nor would He\nlong suffer the exultation of the heathen. He had used the Philistines\nas the instrument to punish Israel, and He employed the ark to punish\nthe Philistines. In time past the divine Presence had attended it, to\nbe the strength and glory of His obedient people. That invisible\nPresence would still attend it, to bring terror and destruction to the\ntransgressors of His holy law. The Lord often employs His bitterest\nenemies to punish the unfaithfulness of His professed people. The\nwicked may triumph for a time as they see Israel suffering chastise-\nment, but the time will come when they, too, must meet the sentence [586]\n536 Patriarchs and Prophets\nof a holy, sin-hating God. Whenever iniquity is cherished, there,\nswift and unerring, the divine judgments will follow.\nThe Philistines removed the ark in triumph to Ashdod, one of\ntheir five principal cities, and placed it in the house of their god\nDagon. They imagined that the power which had hitherto attended\nthe ark would be theirs, and that this, united with the power of\nDagon, would render them invincible. But upon entering the temple\non the following day, they beheld a sight which filled them with\nconsternation. Dagon had fallen upon his face to the earth before the\nark of Jehovah. The priests reverently lifted the idol and restored it\nto its place. But the next morning they found it, strangely mutilated,\nagain lying upon the earth before the ark. The upper part of this idol\nwas like that of a man, and the lower part was in the likeness of a\nfish. Now every part that resembled the human form had been cut\noff, and only the body of the fish remained. Priests and people were\nhorror-struck; they looked upon this mysterious event as an evil\nomen, foreboding destruction to themselves and their idols before\nthe God of the Hebrews. They now removed the ark from their\ntemple and placed it in a building by itself.\nThe inhabitants of Ashdod were smitten with a distressing and\nfatal disease. Remembering the plagues that were inflicted upon\nEgypt by the God of Israel, the people attributed their afflictions to\nthe presence of the ark among them. It was decided to convey it to\nGath. But the plague followed close upon its removal, and the men\nof that city sent it to Ekron. Here the people received it with terror,\ncrying, \u201cThey have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us,\nto slay us and our people.\u201d They turned to their gods for protection,\nas the people of Gath and Ashdod had done; but the work of the\ndestroyer went on, until, in their distress, \u201cthe cry of the city went\nup to heaven.\u201d Fearing longer to retain the ark among the homes of\nmen, the people next placed it in the open field. There followed a\nplague of mice, which infested the land, destroying the products of\nthe soil, both in the storehouse and in the field. Utter destruction, by\ndisease or famine, now threatened the nation.\nFor seven months the ark remained in Philistia, and during all\nthis time the Israelites made no effort for its recovery. But the\nPhilistines were now as anxious to free themselves from its presence\nas they had been to obtain it. Instead of being a source of strength to[587]\nArk Taken by the Philistines 537\nthem, it was a great burden and a heavy curse. Yet they knew not\nwhat course to pursue; for wherever it went the judgments of God\nfollowed. The people called for the princes of the nation, with the\npriests and diviners, and eagerly inquired, \u201cWhat shall we do to the\nark of Jehovah? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place?\u201d They\nwere advised to return it with a costly trespass offering. \u201cThen,\u201d said\nthe priests, \u201cye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why\nHis hand is not removed from you.\u201d\nTo ward off or to remove a plague, it was anciently the custom\namong the heathen to make an image in gold, silver, or other material,\nof that which caused the destruction, or of the object or part of the\nbody specially affected. This was set up on a pillar or in some\nconspicuous place, and was supposed to be an effectual protection\nagainst the evils thus represented. A similar practice still exists\namong some heathen peoples. When a person suffering from disease\ngoes for cure to the temple of his idol, he carries with him a figure\nof the part affected, which he presents as an offering to his god.\nIt was in accordance with the prevailing superstition that the\nPhilistine lords directed the people to make representations of the\nplagues by which they had been afflicted\u2014\u201cfive golden emerods,\nand five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the\nPhilistines: for,\u201d said they, \u201cone plague was on you all, and on your\nlords.\u201d\nThese wise men acknowledged a mysterious power accompany-\ning the ark\u2014a power which they had no wisdom to meet. Yet they\ndid not counsel the people to turn from their idolatry to serve the\nLord. They still hated the God of Israel, though compelled by over-\nwhelming judgments to submit to His authority. Thus sinners may\nbe convinced by the judgments of God that it is in vain to contend\nagainst Him. They may be compelled to submit to His power, while\nat heart they rebel against His control. Such submission cannot save\nthe sinner. The heart must be yielded to God\u2014must be subdued by\ndivine grace\u2014before man\u2019s repentance can be accepted.\nHow great is the long-suffering of God toward the wicked! The\nidolatrous Philistines and backsliding Israel had alike enjoyed the\ngifts of His providence. Ten thousand unnoticed mercies were [588]\nsilently falling in the pathway of ungrateful, rebellious men. Every\nblessing spoke to them of the Giver, but they were indifferent to His\n538 Patriarchs and Prophets\nlove. The forbearance of God was very great toward the children of\nmen; but when they stubbornly persisted in their impenitence, He\nremoved from them His protecting hand. They refused to listen to\nthe voice of God in His created works, and in the warnings, counsels,\nand reproofs of His word, and thus He was forced to speak to them\nthrough judgments.\nThere were some among the Philistines who stood ready to op-\npose the return of the ark to its own land. Such an acknowledgment\nof the power of Israel\u2019s God would be humiliating to the pride of\nPhilistia. But \u201cthe priests and the diviners\u201d admonished the people\nnot to imitate the stubbornness of Pharaoh and the Egyptians, and\nthus bring upon themselves still greater afflictions. A plan which\nwon the consent of all was now proposed, and immediately put in\nexecution. The ark, with the golden trespass offering, was placed\nupon a new cart, thus precluding all danger of defilement; to this\ncart, or car, were attached two kine upon whose necks a yoke had\nnever been placed. Their calves were shut up at home, and the cows\nwere left free to go where they pleased. If the ark should thus be\nreturned to the Israelites by the way of Beth-shemesh, the nearest\ncity of the Levites, the Philistines would accept this as evidence that\nthe God of Israel had done unto them this great evil; \u201cbut if not,\u201d\nthey said, \u201cthen we shall know that it is not His hand that smote us;\nit was a chance that happened to us.\u201d\nOn being set free, the kine turned from their young and, lowing\nas they went, took the direct road to Beth-shemesh. Guided by no\nhuman hand, the patient animals kept on their way. The divine\nPresence accompanied the ark, and it passed on safely to the very\nplace designated.\nIt was now the time of wheat harvest, and the men of Beth-\nshemesh were reaping in the valley. \u201cAnd they lifted up their eyes,\nand saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it. And the cart came into the\nfield of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was\na great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the\nkine of burnt-offering unto the Lord.\u201d The lords of the Philistines,\nwho had followed the ark \u201cunto the border of Beth-shemesh,\u201d and\nhad witnessed its reception, now returned to Ekron. The plague had[589]\nceased, and they were convinced that their calamities had been a\njudgment from the God of Israel.\nArk Taken by the Philistines 539\nThe men of Beth-shemesh quickly spread the tidings that the\nark was in their possession, and the people from the surrounding\ncountry flocked to welcome its return. The ark had been placed\nupon the stone that first served for an altar, and before it additional\nsacrifices were offered unto the Lord. Had the worshipers repented\nof their sins, God\u2019s blessing would have attended them. But they\nwere not faithfully obeying His law; and while they rejoiced at the\nreturn of the ark as a harbinger of good, they had no true sense of its\nsacredness. Instead of preparing a suitable place for its reception,\nthey permitted it to remain in the harvest field. As they continued\nto gaze upon the sacred chest and to talk of the wonderful manner\nin which it had been restored, they began to conjecture wherein lay\nits peculiar power. At last, overcome by curiosity, they removed the\ncoverings and ventured to open it.\nAll Israel had been taught to regard the ark with awe and rever-\nence. When required to remove it from place to place the Levites\nwere not so much as to look upon it. Only once a year was the\nhigh priest permitted to behold the ark of God. Even the heathen\nPhilistines had not dared to remove its coverings. Angels of heaven,\nunseen, ever attended it in all its journeyings. The irreverent daring\nof the people at Beth-shemesh was speedily punished. Many were\nsmitten with sudden death.\nThe survivors were not led by this judgment to repent of their\nsin, but only to regard the ark with superstitious fear. Eager to be\nfree from its presence, yet not daring to remove it, the Beth-shemites\nsent a message to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, inviting them\nto take it away. With great joy the men of this place welcomed the\nsacred chest. They knew that it was the pledge of divine favor to\nthe obedient and faithful. With solemn gladness they brought it to\ntheir city and placed it in the house of Abinadab, a Levite. This man\nappointed his son Eleazar to take charge of it, and it remained there\nfor many years.\nDuring the years since the Lord first manifested Himself to the\nson of Hannah, Samuel\u2019s call to the prophetic office had come to\nbe acknowledged by the whole nation. By faithfully delivering the\ndivine warning to the house of Eli, painful and trying as the duty had [590]\nbeen, Samuel had given proof of his fidelity as Jehovah\u2019s messenger;\n\u201cand the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to\n540 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe ground. And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that\nSamuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord.\u201d\nThe Israelites as a nation still continued in a state of irreligion\nand idolatry, and as a punishment they remained in subjection to the\nPhilistines. During this time Samuel visited the cities and villages\nthroughout the land, seeking to turn the hearts of the people to the\nGod of their fathers; and his efforts were not without good results.\nAfter suffering the oppression of their enemies for twenty years,\nthe Israelites \u201cmourned after the Lord.\u201d Samuel counseled them,\n\u201cIf ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away\nthe strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your\nhearts unto the Lord, and serve Him only.\u201d Here we see that practical\npiety, heart religion, was taught in the days of Samuel as taught by\nChrist when He was upon the earth. Without the grace of Christ the\noutward forms of religion were valueless to ancient Israel. They are\nthe same to modern Israel.\nThere is need today of such a revival of true heart religion as was\nexperienced by ancient Israel. Repentance is the first step that must\nbe taken by all who would return to God. No one can do this work\nfor another. We must individually humble our souls before God and\nput away our idols. When we have done all that we can do, the Lord\nwill manifest to us His salvation.\nWith the co-operation of the heads of the tribes, a large assembly\nwas gathered at Mizpeh. Here a solemn fast was held. With deep\nhumiliation the people confessed their sins; and as an evidence of\ntheir determination to obey the instructions they had heard, they\ninvested Samuel with the authority of judge.\nThe Philistines interpreted this gathering to be a council of war,\nand with a strong force set out to disperse the Israelites before their\nplans could be matured. The tidings of their approach caused great\nterror in Israel. The people entreated Samuel, \u201cCease not to cry unto\nthe Lord our God for us, that He will save us out of the hand of the\nPhilistines.\u201d\nWhile Samuel was in the act of presenting a lamb as a burnt\noffering, the Philistines drew near for battle. Then the Mighty One[591]\nwho had descended upon Sinai amid fire and smoke and thunder,\nwho had parted the Red Sea and made a way through Jordan for\nthe children of Israel, again manifested His power. A terrible storm\nArk Taken by the Philistines 541\nburst upon the advancing host, and the earth was strewn with the\ndead bodies of mighty warriors.\nThe Israelites had stood in silent awe, trembling with hope and\nfear. When they beheld the slaughter of their enemies, they knew that\nGod had accepted their repentance. Though unprepared for battle,\nthey seized the weapons of the slaughtered Philistines and pursued\nthe fleeing host to Beth-car. This signal victory was gained upon\nthe very field where, twenty years before, Israel had been smitten\nbefore the Philistines, the priests slain, and the ark of God taken.\nFor nations as well as for individuals, the path of obedience to God\nis the path of safety and happiness, while that of transgression leads\nonly to disaster and defeat. The Philistines were now so completely\nsubdued that they surrendered the strongholds which had been taken\nfrom Israel and refrained from acts of hostility for many years. Other\nnations followed this example, and the Israelites enjoyed peace until\nthe close of Samuel\u2019s sole administration.\nThat the occasion might never be forgotten, Samuel set up, be-\ntween Mizpeh and Shen, a great stone as a memorial. He called\nthe name of it Ebenezer, \u201cthe stone of help,\u201d saying to the people,\n\u201chitherto hath Jehovah helped us.\u201d\nChapter 58\u2014The Schools of the Prophets[592]\nThe Lord Himself directed the education of Israel. His care was\nnot restricted to their religious interests; whatever affected their men-\ntal or physical well-being was also the subject of divine providence,\nand came within the sphere of divine law.\nGod had commanded the Hebrews to teach their children His\nrequirements and to make them acquainted with all His dealings with\ntheir fathers. This was one of the special duties of every parent\u2014one\nthat was not to be delegated to another. In the place of stranger lips\nthe loving hearts of the father and mother were to give instruction\nto their children. Thoughts of God were to be associated with all\nthe events of daily life. The mighty works of God in the deliverance\nof His people and the promises of the Redeemer to come were to\nbe often recounted in the homes of Israel; and the use of figures\nand symbols caused the lessons given to be more firmly fixed in\nthe memory. The great truths of God\u2019s providence and of the future\nlife were impressed on the young mind. It was trained to see God\nalike in the scenes of nature and the words of revelation. The stars\nof heaven, the trees and flowers of the field, the lofty mountains,\nthe rippling brooks\u2014all spoke of the Creator. The solemn service\nof sacrifice and worship at the sanctuary and the utterances of the\nprophets were a revelation of God.\nSuch was the training of Moses in the lowly cabin home in\nGoshen; of Samuel, by the faithful Hannah; of David, in the hill\ndwelling at Bethlehem; of Daniel, before the scenes of the captivity\nseparated him from the home of his fathers. Such, too, was the\nearly life of Christ at Nazareth; such the training by which the child\nTimothy learned from the lips of his grandmother Lois, and his\nmother Eunice (2 Timothy 1:5; 3:15), the truths of Holy Writ.\nFurther provision was made for the instruction of the young, by[593]\nthe establishment of the schools of the prophets. If a youth desired\nto search deeper into the truths of the word of God and to seek\nwisdom from above, that he might become a teacher in Israel, these\n542\nSchools of the Prophets 543\nschools were open to him. The schools of the prophets were founded\nby Samuel to serve as a barrier against the widespread corruption,\nto provide for the moral and spiritual welfare of the youth, and to\npromote the future prosperity of the nation by furnishing it with\nmen qualified to act in the fear of God as leaders and counselors. In\nthe accomplishment of this object Samuel gathered companies of\nyoung men who were pious, intelligent, and studious. These were\ncalled the sons of the prophets. As they communed with God and\nstudied His word and His works, wisdom from above was added\nto their natural endowments. The instructors were men not only\nwell versed in divine truth, but those who had themselves enjoyed\ncommunion with God and had received the special endowment of\nHis Spirit. They enjoyed the respect and confidence of the people,\nboth for learning and piety.\nIn Samuel\u2019s day there were two of these schools\u2014one at Ramah,\nthe home of the prophet, and the other at Kirjath-jearim, where the\nark then was. Others were established in later times.\nThe pupils of these schools sustained themselves by their own\nlabor in tilling the soil or in some mechanical employment. In Israel\nthis was not thought strange or degrading; indeed, it was regarded\na crime to allow children to grow up in ignorance of useful labor.\nBy the command of God every child was taught some trade, even\nthough he was to be educated for holy office. Many of the religious\nteachers supported themselves by manual labor. Even so late as the\ntime of the apostles, Paul and Aquila were no less honored because\nthey earned a livelihood by their trade of tentmaking.\nThe chief subjects of study in these schools were the law of\nGod, with the instructions given to Moses, sacred history, sacred\nmusic, and poetry. The manner of instruction was far different from\nthat in the theological schools of the present day, from which many\nstudents graduate with less real knowledge of God and religious\ntruth than when they entered. In those schools of the olden time\nit was the grand object of all study to learn the will of God and [594]\nman\u2019s duty toward Him. In the records of sacred history were traced\nthe footsteps of Jehovah. The great truths set forth by the types\nwere brought to view, and faith grasped the central object of all that\nsystem\u2014the Lamb of God that was to take away the sin of the world.\n544 Patriarchs and Prophets\nA spirit of devotion was cherished. Not only were students\ntaught the duty of prayer, but they were taught how to pray, how to\napproach their Creator, how to exercise faith in Him, and how to\nunderstand and obey the teachings of His Spirit. Sanctified intellects\nbrought forth from the treasure house of God things new and old,\nand the Spirit of God was manifested in prophecy and sacred song.\nMusic was made to serve a holy purpose, to lift the thoughts to\nthat which is pure, noble, and elevating, and to awaken in the soul\ndevotion and gratitude to God. What a contrast between the ancient\ncustom and the uses to which music is now too often devoted! How\nmany employ this gift to exalt self, instead of using it to Glorify\nGod! A love for music leads the unwary to unite with world lovers\nin pleasure gatherings where God has forbidden His children to go.\nThus that which is a great blessing when rightly used, becomes one\nof the most successful agencies by which Satan allures the mind\nfrom duty and from the contemplation of eternal things.\nMusic forms a part of God\u2019s worship in the courts above, and\nwe should endeavor, in our songs of praise, to approach as nearly as\npossible to the harmony of the heavenly choirs. The proper training\nof the voice is an important feature in education and should not be\nneglected. Singing, as a part of religious service, is as much an act\nof worship as is prayer. The heart must feel the spirit of the song to\ngive it right expression.\nHow wide the difference between those schools taught by the\nprophets of God and our modern institutions of learning! How few\nschools are to be found that are not governed by the maxims and cus-\ntoms of the world! There is a deplorable lack of proper restraint and\njudicious discipline. The existing ignorance of God\u2019s word among\na people professedly Christian is alarming. Superficial talk, mere\nsentimentalism, passes for instruction in morals and religion. The\njustice and mercy of God, the beauty of holiness and the sure reward\nof rightdoing, the heinous character of sin and the certainty of its\nterrible results, are not impressed upon the minds of the young. Evil[595]\nassociates are instructing the youth in the ways of crime, dissipation,\nand licentiousness.\nAre there not some lessons which the educators of our day might\nlearn with profit from the ancient schools of the Hebrews? He who\ncreated man has provided for his development in body and mind\nSchools of the Prophets 545\nand soul. Hence, real success in education depends upon the fidelity\nwith which men carry out the Creator\u2019s plan.\nThe true object of education is to restore the image of God in\nthe soul. In the beginning God created man in His own likeness.\nHe endowed him with noble qualities. His mind was well balanced,\nand all the powers of his being were harmonious. But the Fall and\nits effects have perverted these gifts. Sin has marred and well-nigh\nobliterated the image of God in man. It was to restore this that the\nplan of salvation was devised, and a life of probation was granted\nto man. To bring him back to the perfection in which he was first\ncreated is the great object of life\u2014the object that underlies every\nother. It is the work of parents and teachers, in the education of the\nyouth, to co-operate with the divine purpose; and in so doing they\nare \u201claborers together with God.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:9.\nAll the varied capabilities that men possess\u2014of mind and soul\nand body\u2014are given them by God, to be so employed as to reach the\nhighest possible degree of excellence. But this cannot be a selfish and\nexclusive culture; for the character of God, whose likeness we are to\nreceive, is benevolence and love. Every faculty, every attribute, with\nwhich the Creator has endowed us is to be employed for His glory\nand for the uplifting of our fellow men. And in this employment is\nfound its purest, noblest, and happiest exercise.\nWere this principle given the attention which its importance\ndemands, there would be a radical change in some of the current\nmethods of education. Instead of appealing to pride and selfish\nambition, kindling a spirit of emulation, teachers would endeavor to\nawaken the love for goodness and truth and beauty\u2014to arouse the\ndesire for excellence. The student would seek the development of\nGod\u2019s gifts in himself, not to excel others, but to fulfill the purpose\nof the Creator and to receive His likeness. Instead of being directed\nto mere earthly standards, or being actuated by the desire for self- [596]\nexaltation, which in itself dwarfs and belittles, the mind would be\ndirected to the Creator, to know Him and to become like Him.\n\u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: andthe knowl-\nedge of the Holy is understanding.\u201d Proverbs 9:10. The great work of\nlife is character building, and a knowledge of God is the foundation\nof all true education. To impart this knowledge and to mold the char-\nacter in harmony with it should be the object of the teacher\u2019s work.\n546 Patriarchs and Prophets\nThe law of God is a reflection of His character. Hence the psalmist\nsays, \u201cAll Thy commandments are righteousness;\u201d and \u201cthrough\nThy precepts I get understanding.\u201d Psalm 119:172, 104. God has\nrevealed Himself to us in His word and in the works of creation.\nThrough the volume of inspiration and the book of nature we are to\nobtain a knowledge of God.\nIt is a law of the mind that it gradually adapts itself to the subjects\nupon which it is trained to dwell. If occupied with commonplace\nmatters only, it will become dwarfed and enfeebled. If never required\nto grapple with difficult problems, it will after a time almost lose the\npower of growth. As an educating power the Bible is without a rival.\nIn the word of God the mind finds subject for the deepest thought,\nthe loftiest aspiration. The Bible is the most instructive history that\nmen possess. It came fresh from the fountain of eternal truth, and a\ndivine hand has preserved its purity through all the ages. It lights up\nthe far-distant past, where human research seeks vainly to penetrate.\nIn God\u2019s word we behold the power that laid the foundation of the\nearth and that stretched out the heavens. Here only can we find a\nhistory of our race unsullied by human prejudice or human pride.\nHere are recorded the struggles, the defeats, and the victories of the\ngreatest men this world has ever known. Here the great problems\nof duty and destiny are unfolded. The curtain that separates the\nvisible from the invisible world is lifted, and we behold the conflict\nof the opposing forces of good and evil, from the first entrance of\nsin to the final triumph of righteousness and truth; and all is but a\nrevelation of the character of God. In the reverent contemplation of\nthe truths presented in His word the mind of the student is brought\ninto communion with the infinite mind. Such a study will not only\nrefine and ennoble the character, but it cannot fail to expand and[597]\n[598]\n[599]\ninvigorate the mental powers.\nThe teaching of the Bible has a vital bearing upon man\u2019s pros-\nperity in all the relations of this life. It unfolds the principles that\nare the cornerstone of a nation\u2019s prosperity\u2014principles with which\nis bound up the well-being of society, and which are the safeguard\nof the family\u2014principles without which no man can attain useful-\nness, happiness, and honor in this life, or can hope to secure the\nfuture, immortal life. There is no position in life, no phase of human\nexperience, for which the teaching of the Bible is not an essential\nSchools of the Prophets 547\npreparation. Studied and obeyed, the word of God would give to the\nworld men of stronger and more active intellect than will the closest\napplication to all the subjects that human philosophy embraces. It\nwould give men of strength and solidity of character, of keen per-\nception and sound judgment\u2014men who would be an honor to God\nand a blessing to the world.\nIn the study of the sciences also we are to obtain a knowledge of\nthe Creator. All true science is but an interpretation of the handwrit-\ning of God in the material world. Science brings from her research\nonly fresh evidences of the wisdom and power of God. Rightly\nunderstood, both the book of nature and the written word make\nus acquainted with God by teaching us something of the wise and\nbeneficent laws through which He works.\nThe student should be led to see God in all the works of creation.\nTeachers should copy the example of the Great Teacher, who from\nthe familiar scenes of nature drew illustrations that simplified His\nteachings and impressed them more deeply upon the minds of His\nhearers. The birds caroling in the leafy branches, the flowers of\nthe valley, the lofty trees, the fruitful lands, the springing grain,\nthe barren soil, the setting sun gilding the heavens with its golden\nbeams\u2014all served as means of instruction. He connected the visible\nworks of the Creator with the words of life which He spoke, that\nwhenever these objects should be presented to the eyes of His hear-\ners, their thoughts might revert to the lessons of truth He had linked\nwith them.\nThe impress of Deity, manifest in the pages of revelation, is seen\nupon the lofty mountains, the fruitful valleys, the broad, deep ocean.\nThe things of nature speak to man of his Creator\u2019s love. He has [600]\nlinked us to Himself by unnumbered tokens in heaven and in earth.\nThis world is not all sorrow and misery. \u201cGod is love,\u201d is written\nupon every opening bud, upon the petals of every flower, and upon\nevery spire of grass. Though the curse of sin has caused the earth\nto bring forth thorns and thistles, there are flowers upon the thistles\nand the thorns are hidden by roses. All things in nature testify to\nthe tender, fatherly care of our God and to His desire to make His\nchildren happy. His prohibitions and injunctions are not intended\nmerely to display His authority, but in all that He does He has the\n548 Patriarchs and Prophets\nwell-being of His children in view. He does not require them to give\nup anything that it would be for their best interest to retain.\nThe opinion which prevails in some classes of society, that re-\nligion is not conducive to health or to happiness in this life, is one\nof the most mischievous of errors. The Scripture says: \u201cThe fear\nof the Lord tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied.\u201d\nProverbs 19:23. \u201cWhat man is he that desireth life, and loveth many\ndays, that he may see good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips\nfrom speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace,\nand pursue it.\u201d Psalm 34:12-14. The words of wisdom \u201care life unto\nthose that find them, and health to all their flesh.\u201d Proverbs 4:22.\nTrue religion brings man into harmony with the laws of God,\nphysical, mental, and moral. It teaches self-control, serenity, tem-\nperance. Religion ennobles the mind, refines the taste, and sanctifies\nthe judgment. It makes the soul a partaker of the purity of heaven.\nFaith in God\u2019s love and overruling providence lightens the burdens\nof anxiety and care. It fills the heart with joy and contentment in the\nhighest or the lowliest lot. Religion tends directly to promote health,\nto lengthen life, and to heighten our enjoyment of all its blessings. It\nopens to the soul a never-failing fountain of happiness. Would that\nall who have not chosen Christ might realize that He has something\nvastly better to offer them that they are seeking for themselves. Man\nis doing the greatest injury and injustice to his own soul when he\nthinks and acts contrary to the will of God. No real joy can be\nfound in the path forbidden by Him who knows what is best, and\nwho plans for the good of His creatures. The path of transgression\nleads to misery and destruction; but wisdom\u2019s \u201cways are ways of\npleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\u201d Proverbs 3:17.\nThe physical as well as the religious training practiced in the[601]\nschools of the Hebrews may be profitably studied. The worth of such\ntraining is not appreciated. There is an intimate relation between the\nmind and the body, and in order to reach a high standard of moral\nand intellectual attainment the laws that control our physical being\nmust be heeded. To secure a strong, well-balanced character, both\nthe mental and the physical powers must be exercised and developed.\nWhat study can be more important for the young than that which\ntreats of this wonderful organism that God has committed to us, and\nof the laws by which it may be preserved in health?\nSchools of the Prophets 549\nAnd now, as in the days of Israel, every youth should be in-\nstructed in the duties of practical life. Each should acquire a knowl-\nedge of some branch of manual labor by which, if need be, he may\nobtain a livelihood. This is essential, not only as a safeguard against\nthe vicissitudes of life, but from its bearing upon physical, mental,\nand moral development. Even if it were certain that one would never\nneed to resort to manual labor for his support, still he should be\ntaught to work. Without physical exercise, no one can have a sound\nconstitution and vigorous health; and the discipline of well-regulated\nlabor is no less essential to the securing of a strong and active mind\nand a noble character.\nEvery student should devote a portion of each day to active\nlabor. Thus habits of industry would be formed and a spirit of self-\nreliance encouraged, while the youth would be shielded from many\nevil and degrading practices that are so often the result of idleness.\nAnd this is all in keeping with the primary object of education, for\nin encouraging activity, diligence, and purity we are coming into\nharmony with the Creator.\nLet the youth be led to understand the object of their creation, to\nhonor God and bless their fellow men; let them see the tender love\nwhich the Father in heaven has manifested toward them, and the\nhigh destiny for which the discipline of this life is to prepare them,\nthe dignity and honor to which they are called, even to become the\nsons of God, and thousands would turn with contempt and loathing\nfrom the low and selfish aims and the frivolous pleasures that have\nhitherto engrossed them. They would learn to hate sin and to shun\nit, not merely from hope of reward or fear of punishment, but from a\nsense of its inherent baseness, because it would be a degrading of [602]\ntheir God-given powers, a stain upon their Godlike manhood.\nGod does not bid the youth to be less aspiring. The elements of\ncharacter that make a man successful and honored among men\u2014the\nirrepressible desire for some greater good, the indomitable will, the\nstrenuous exertion, the untiring perseverance\u2014are not to be crushed\nout. By the grace of God they are to be directed to objects as much\nhigher than mere selfish and temporal interests as the heavens are\nhigher than the earth. And the education begun in this life will be\ncontinued in the life to come. Day by day the wonderful works\nof God, the evidences of His wisdom and power in creating and\n550 Patriarchs and Prophets\nsustaining the universe, the infinite mystery of love and wisdom in\nthe plan of redemption, will open to the mind in new beauty. \u201cEye\nhath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of\nman, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.\u201d\n1 Corinthians 2:9. Even in this life we may catch glimpses of His\npresence and may taste the joy of communion with Heaven, but\nthe fullness of its joy and blessing will be reached in the hereafter.\nEternity alone can reveal the glorious destiny to which man, restored\nto God\u2019s image, may attain.\nChapter 59\u2014The First King of Israel [603]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Samuel 8 to 12.\nThe government of Israel was administered in the name and by\nthe authority of God. The work of Moses, of the seventy elders, of\nthe rulers and judges, was simply to enforce the laws that God had\ngiven; they had no authority to legislate for the nation. This was, and\ncontinued to be, the condition of Israel\u2019s existence as a nation. From\nage to age men inspired by God were sent to instruct the people and\nto direct in the enforcement of the laws.\nThe Lord foresaw that Israel would desire a king, but He did\nnot consent to a change in the principles upon which the state was\nfounded. The king was to be the vicegerent of the Most High. God\nwas to be recognized as the Head of the nation, and His law was to\nbe enforced as the supreme law of the land. [See Appendix, note 8.]\nWhen the Israelites first settled in Canaan they acknowledged\nthe principles of the theocracy, and the nation prospered under the\nrule of Joshua. But increase of population and intercourse with other\nnations brought a change. The people adopted many of the customs\nof their heathen neighbors and thus sacrificed to a great degree their\nown peculiar, holy character. Gradually they lost their reverence\nfor God and ceased to prize the honor of being His chosen people.\nAttracted by the pomp and display of heathen monarchs, they tired\nof their own simplicity. Jealousy and envy sprang up between the\ntribes. Internal dissensions made them weak; they were continually\nexposed to the invasion of their heathen foes, and the people were\ncoming to believe that in order to maintain their standing among the\nnations, the tribes must be united under a strong central government.\nAs they departed from obedience to God\u2019s law, they desired to be\nfreed from the rule of their divine Sovereign; and thus the demand\nfor a monarchy became widespread throughout Israel.\nSince the days of Joshua the government had never been\nconducted with so great wisdom and success as under Samuel\u2019s\n551\n552 Patriarchs and Prophets\nadministration. Divinely invested with the threefold office of judge,[604]\nprophet, and priest, he had labored with untiring and disinterested\nzeal for the welfare of his people, and the nation had prospered under\nhis wise control. Order had been restored, and godliness promoted,\nand the spirit of discontent was checked for the time. But with ad-\nvancing years the prophet was forced to share with others the cares\nof government, and he appointed his two sons to act as his assistants.\nWhile Samuel continued the duties of his office at Ramah, the young\nmen were stationed at Beersheba, to administer justice among the\npeople near the southern border of the land.\nIt was with the full assent of the nation that Samuel had appointed\nhis sons to office, but they did not prove themselves worthy of their\nfather\u2019s choice. The Lord had, through Moses, given special direc-\ntions to His people that the rulers of Israel should judge righteously,\ndeal justly with the widow and the fatherless, and receive no bribes.\nBut the sons of Samuel \u201cturned aside after lucre, and took bribes,\nand perverted judgment.\u201d The sons of the prophet had not heeded\nthe precepts which he had sought to impress upon their minds. They\nhad not copied the pure, unselfish life of their father. The warning\ngiven to Eli had not exerted the influence upon the mind of Samuel\nthat it should have done. He had been to some extent too indulgent\nwith his sons, and the result was apparent in their character and life.\nThe injustice of these judges caused much dissatisfaction, and\na pretext was thus furnished for urging the change that had long\nbeen secretly desired. \u201cAll the elders of Israel gathered themselves\ntogether, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, and said unto him, Be-\nhold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us\na king to judge us like all the nations.\u201d The cases of abuse among\nthe people had not been referred to Samuel. Had the evil course of\nhis sons been known to him, he would have removed them without\ndelay; but this was not what the petitioners desired. Samuel saw that\ntheir real motive was discontent and pride, and that their demand\nwas the result of a deliberate and determined purpose. No complaint\nhad been made against Samuel. All acknowledged the integrity and\nwisdom of his administration; but the aged prophet looked upon the[605]\nrequest as a censure upon himself, and a direct effort to set him aside.\nHe did not, however, reveal his feelings; he uttered no reproach, but\nFirst King of Israel 553\ncarried the matter to the Lord in prayer and sought counsel from\nHim alone.\nAnd the Lord said unto Samuel: \u201cHearken unto the voice of\nthe people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected\nthee, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them.\nAccording to all the works which they have done since the day that\nI brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they\nhave forsaken Me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.\u201d\nThe prophet was reproved for grieving at the conduct of the people\ntoward himself as an individual. They had not manifested disrespect\nfor him, but for the authority of God, who had appointed the rulers\nof His people. Those who despise and reject the faithful servant of\nGod show contempt, not merely for the man, but for the Master who\nsent him. It is God\u2019s words, His reproofs and counsel, that are set at\nnought; it is His authority that is rejected.\nThe days of Israel\u2019s greatest prosperity had been those in which\nthey acknowledged Jehovah as their King\u2014when the laws and the\ngovernment which He had established were regarded as superior to\nthose of all other nations. Moses had declared to Israel concerning\nthe commandments of the Lord: \u201cThis is your wisdom and your\nunderstanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these\nstatutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding\npeople.\u201d Deuteronomy 4:6. But by departing from God\u2019s law the\nHebrews had failed to become the people that God desired to make\nthem, and then all the evils which were the result of their own sin\nand folly they charged upon the government of God. So completely\nhad they become blinded by sin.\nThe Lord had, through His prophets, foretold that Israel would\nbe governed by a king; but it does not follow that this form of\ngovernment was best for them or according to His will. He permitted\nthe people to follow their own choice, because they refused to be\nguided by His counsel. Hosea declares that God gave them a king in\nHis anger. Hosea 13:11. When men choose to have their own way,\nwithout seeking counsel from God, or in opposition to His revealed\nwill, He often grants their desires, in order that, through the bitter\nexperience that follows, they may be led to realize their folly and to [606]\nrepent of their sin. Human pride and wisdom will prove a dangerous\n554 Patriarchs and Prophets\nguide. That which the heart desires contrary to the will of God will\nin the end be found a curse rather than a blessing.\nGod desired His people to look to Him alone as their Law-giver\nand their Source of strength. Feeling their dependence upon God,\nthey would be constantly drawn nearer to Him. They would become\nelevated and ennobled, fitted for the high destiny to which He had\ncalled them as His chosen people. But when a man was placed upon\nthe throne, it would tend to turn the minds of the people from God.\nThey would trust more to human strength, and less to divine power,\nand the errors of their king would lead them into sin and separate\nthe nation from God.\nSamuel was instructed to grant the request of the people, but to\nwarn them of the Lord\u2019s disapproval, and also make known what\nwould be the result of their course. \u201cAnd Samuel told all the words\nof the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king.\u201d He faithfully\nset before them the burdens that would be laid upon them, and\nshowed the contrast between such a state of oppression and their\npresent comparatively free and prosperous condition. Their king\nwould imitate the pomp and luxury of other monarchs, to support\nwhich, grievous exactions upon their persons and property would be\nnecessary. The goodliest of their young men he would require for his\nservice. They would be made charioteers and horsemen and runners\nbefore him. They must fill the ranks of his army, and they would be\nrequired to till his fields, to reap his harvests, and to manufacture\nimplements of war for his service. The daughters of Israel would be\nfor confectioners and bakers for the royal household. To support his\nkingly state he would seize upon the best of their lands, bestowed\nupon the people by Jehovah Himself. The most valuable of their\nservants also, and of their cattle, he would take, and \u201cput them to his\nwork.\u201d Besides all this, the king would require a tenth of all their\nincome, the profits of their labor, or the products of the soil. \u201cYe\nshall be his servants,\u201d concluded the prophet. \u201cAnd ye shall cry out\nin that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you;\nand the Lord will not hear you in that day.\u201d However burdensome its\nexactions should be found, when once a monarchy was established,\nthey could not set it aside at pleasure.\nBut the people returned the answer, \u201cNay; but we will have a[607]\nFirst King of Israel 555\nking over us; that we also may be like all the nations; and that our\nking may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.\u201d\n\u201cLike all the nations.\u201d The Israelites did not realize that to be in\nthis respect unlike other nations was a special privilege and bless-\ning. God had separated the Israelites from every other people, to\nmake them His own peculiar treasure. But they, disregarding this\nhigh honor, eagerly desired to imitate the example of the heathen!\nAnd still the longing to conform to worldly practices and customs\nexists among the professed people of God. As they depart from\nthe Lord they become ambitious for the gains and honors of the\nworld. Christians are constantly seeking to imitate the practices of\nthose who worship the god of this world. Many urge that by uniting\nwith worldlings and conforming to their customs they might exert a\nstronger influence over the ungodly. But all who pursue this course\nthereby separate from the Source of their strength. Becoming the\nfriends of the world, they are the enemies of God. For the sake of\nearthly distinction they sacrifice the unspeakable honor to which\nGod has called them, of showing forth the praises of Him who hath\ncalled us out of darkness into His marvelous light. 1 Peter 2:9.\nWith deep sadness Samuel listened to the words of the people;\nbut the Lord said unto him, \u201cHearken unto their voice, and make\nthem a king.\u201d The prophet had done his duty. He had faithfully\npresented the warning, and it had been rejected. With a heavy heart\nhe dismissed the people, and himself departed to prepare for the\ngreat change in the government.\nSamuel\u2019s life of purity and unselfish devotion was a perpetual\nrebuke both to self-serving priests and elders and to the proud,\nsensual congregation of Israel. Although he assumed no pomp\nand made no display, his labors bore the signet of Heaven. He was\nhonored by the world\u2019s Redeemer, under whose guidance he ruled\nthe Hebrew nation. But the people had become weary of his piety\nand devotion; they despised his humble authority and rejected him\nfor a man who should rule them as a king.\nIn the character of Samuel we see reflected the likeness of Christ.\nIt was the purity of our Saviour\u2019s life that provoked the wrath of\nSatan. That life was the light of the world, and revealed the hidden [608]\ndepravity in the hearts of men. It was the holiness of Christ that\nstirred up against Him the fiercest passions of falsehearted professors\n556 Patriarchs and Prophets\nof godliness. Christ came not with the wealth and honors of earth,\nyet the works which He wrought showed Him to possess power\ngreater than that of any human prince. The Jews looked for the\nMessiah to break the oppressor\u2019s yoke, yet they cherished the sins\nthat had bound it upon their necks. Had Christ cloaked their sins\nand applauded their piety, they would have accepted Him as their\nking; but they would not bear His fearless rebuke of their vices. The\nloveliness of a character in which benevolence, purity, and holiness\nreigned supreme, which entertained no hatred except for sin, they\ndespised. Thus it has been in every age of the world. The light\nfrom heaven brings condemnation on all who refuse to walk in it.\nWhen rebuked by the example of those who hate sin, hypocrites will\nbecome agents of Satan to harass and persecute the faithful. \u201cAll that\nwill live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.\u201d 2 Timothy\n3:12.\nThough a monarchical form of government for Israel had been\nforetold in prophecy, God had reserved to Himself the right to choose\ntheir king. The Hebrews so far respected the authority of God as to\nleave the selection entirely to Him. The choice fell upon Saul, a son\nof Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin.\nThe personal qualities of the future monarch were such as to\ngratify that pride of heart which prompted the desire for a king.\n\u201cThere was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than\nhe.\u201d 1 Samuel 9:2. Of noble and dignified bearing, in the prime of\nlife, comely and tall, he appeared like one born to command. Yet\nwith these external attractions, Saul was destitute of those higher\nqualities that constitute true wisdom. He had not in youth learned to\ncontrol his rash, impetuous passions; he had never felt the renewing\npower of divine grace.\nSaul was the son of a powerful and wealthy chief, yet in ac-\ncordance with the simplicity of the times he was engaged with his\nfather in the humble duties of a husbandman. Some of his father\u2019s\nanimals having strayed upon the mountains, Saul went with a servant\nto seek for them. For three days they searched in vain, when, as\nthey were not far from Ramah, [See Appendix, note 9.] the home of\nSamuel, the servant proposed that they should inquire of the prophet\nconcerning the missing property. \u201cI have here at hand the fourth part[609]\nof a shekel of silver,\u201d he said: \u201cthat will I give to the man of God,\nFirst King of Israel 557\nto tell us our way.\u201d This was in accordance with the custom of the\ntimes. A person approaching a superior in rank or office made him a\nsmall present, as an expression of respect.\nAs they drew near to the city they met some young maidens who\nhad come out to draw water, and inquired of them for the seer. In\nreply they were told that a religious service was about to take place,\nthat the prophet had already arrived, there was to be an offering upon\n\u201cthe high place,\u201d and after that a sacrificial feast. A great change\nhad taken place under Samuel\u2019s administration. When the call of\nGod first came to him the services of the sanctuary were held in\ncontempt. \u201cMen abhorred the offering of the Lord.\u201d 1 Samuel 2:17.\nBut the worship of God was now maintained throughout the land,\nand the people manifested an interest in religious services. There\nbeing no ministration in the tabernacle, sacrifices were for the time\noffered elsewhere; and the cities of the priests and Levites, where\nthe people resorted for instruction, were chosen for this purpose.\nThe highest points in these cities were usually selected as the place\nof sacrifice, and hence were called \u201cthe high places.\u201d\nAt the gate of the city Saul was met by the prophet himself. God\nhad revealed to Samuel that at that time the chosen king of Israel\nwould present himself before him. As they now stood face to face,\nthe Lord said to Samuel, \u201cBehold the man whom I spake to thee of!\nthis same shall reign over My people.\u201d\nTo the request of Saul, \u201cTell me, I pray thee, where the seer\u2019s\nhouse is,\u201d Samuel replied, \u201cI am the seer.\u201d Assuring him also that\nthe lost animals had been found, he urged him to tarry and attend the\nfeast, at the same time giving some intimation of the great destiny\nbefore him: \u201cOn whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on\nthee, and on all thy father\u2019s house?\u201d The listener\u2019s heart thrilled\nat the prophet\u2019s words. He could not but perceive something of\ntheir significance, for the demand for a king had become a matter\nof absorbing interest to the whole nation. Yet with modest self-\ndepreciation Saul replied, \u201cAm not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of\nthe tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the\ntribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?\u201d\nSamuel conducted the stranger to the place of assembly, where\nthe principal men of the town were gathered. Among them, at the [610]\nprophet\u2019s direction, the place of honor was given to Saul, and at the\n558 Patriarchs and Prophets\nfeast the choicest portion was set before him. The services over,\nSamuel took his guest to his own home, and there upon the housetop\nhe communed with him, setting forth the great principles on which\nthe government of Israel had been established, and thus seeking to\nprepare him, in some measure, for his high station.\nWhen Saul departed, early next morning, the prophet went forth\nwith him. Having passed through the town, he directed the servant\nto go forward. Then he bade Saul stand still to receive a message\nsent him from God. \u201cThen Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it\nupon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because Jehovah\nhath anointed thee to be captain over His inheritance?\u201d As evidence\nthat this was done by divine authority, he foretold the incidents that\nwould occur on the homeward journey and assured Saul that he\nwould be qualified by the Spirit of God for the station awaiting him.\n\u201cThe Spirit of Jehovah will come upon thee,\u201d said the prophet, and\nthou \u201cshalt be turned into another man. And let it be, when these\nsigns are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for\nGod is with thee.\u201d\nAs Saul went on his way, all came to pass as the prophet had\nsaid. Near the border of Benjamin he was informed that the lost\nanimals had been found. In the plain of Tabor he met three men who\nwere going to worship God at Bethel. One of them carried three kids\nfor sacrifice, another three loaves of bread, and the third a bottle of\nwine, for the sacrificial feast. They gave Saul the usual salutation\nand also presented him with two of the three loaves of bread. At\nGibeah, his own city, a band of prophets returning from \u201cthe high\nplace\u201d were singing the praise of God to the music of the pipe and\nthe harp, the psaltery and the tabret. As Saul approached them the\nSpirit of the Lord came upon him also, and he joined in their song\nof praise, and prophesied with them. He spoke with so great fluency\nand wisdom, and joined so earnestly in the service, that those who\nhad known him exclaimed in astonishment, \u201cWhat is this that is\ncome unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?\u201d\nAs Saul united with the prophets in their worship, a great change\nwas wrought in him by the Holy Spirit. The light of divine purity\nand holiness shone in upon the darkness of the natural heart. He saw\nhimself as he was before God. He saw the beauty of holiness. He[611]\nwas now called to begin the warfare against sin and Satan, and he\nFirst King of Israel 559\nwas made to feel that in this conflict his strength must come wholly\nfrom God. The plan of salvation, which had before seemed dim and\nuncertain, was opened to his understanding. The Lord endowed him\nwith courage and wisdom for his high station. He revealed to him\nthe Source of strength and grace, and enlightened his understanding\nas to the divine claims and his own duty.\nThe anointing of Saul as king had not been made known to the\nnation. The choice of God was to be publicly manifested by lot. For\nthis purpose Samuel convoked the people at Mizpeh. Prayer was\noffered for divine guidance; then followed the solemn ceremony\nof casting the lot. In silence the assembled multitude awaited the\nissue. The tribe, the family, and the household were successively\ndesignated, and then Saul, the son of Kish, was pointed out as the\nindividual chosen. But Saul was not in the assembly. Burdened with\na sense of the great responsibility about to fall upon him, he had\nsecretly withdrawn. He was brought back to the congregation, who\nobserved with pride and satisfaction that he was of kingly bearing\nand noble form, being \u201chigher than any of the people from his\nshoulders and upward.\u201d Even Samuel, when presenting him to the\nassembly, exclaimed, \u201cSee ye him whom the Lord hath chosen, that\nthere is none like him among all the people?\u201d And in response arose\nfrom the vast throng one long, loud shout of joy, \u201cGod save the\nking!\u201d\nSamuel then set before the people \u201cthe manner of the kingdom,\u201d\nstating the principles upon which the monarchial government was\nbased, and by which it should be controlled. The king was not to be\nan absolute monarch, but was to hold his power in subjection to the\nwill of the Most High. This address was recorded in a book, wherein\nwere set forth the prerogatives of the prince and the rights and\nprivileges of the people. Though the nation had despised Samuel\u2019s\nwarning, the faithful prophet, while forced to yield to their desires,\nstill endeavored, as far as possible, to guard their liberties.\nWhile the people in general were ready to acknowledge Saul as\ntheir king, there was a large party in opposition. For a monarch to\nbe chosen from Benjamin, the smallest of the tribes of Israel\u2014and\nthat to the neglect of both Judah and Ephraim, the largest and most\npowerful\u2014was a slight which they could not brook. They refused\nto profess allegiance to Saul or to bring him the customary presents. [612]\n560 Patriarchs and Prophets\nThose who had been most urgent in their demand for a king were\nthe very ones that refused to accept with gratitude the man of God\u2019s\nappointment. The members of each faction had their favorite, whom\nthey wished to see placed on the throne, and several among the\nleaders had desired the honor for themselves. Envy and jealousy\nburned in the hearts of many. The efforts of pride and ambition had\nresulted in disappointment and discontent.\nIn this condition of affairs Saul did not see fit to assume the\nroyal dignity. Leaving Samuel to administer the government as\nformerly, he returned to Gibeah. He was honorably escorted thither\nby a company, who, seeing the divine choice in his selection, were\ndetermined to sustain him. But he made no attempt to maintain\nby force his right to the throne. In his home among the uplands of\nBenjamin he quietly occupied himself in the duties of a husbandman,\nleaving the establishment of his authority entirely to God.\nSoon after Saul\u2019s appointment the Ammonites, under their king,\nNahash, invaded the territory of the tribes east of Jordan and threat-\nened the city of Jabesh-gilead. The inhabitants tried to secure terms\nof peace by offering to become tributary to the Ammonites. To this\nthe cruel king would not consent but on condition that he might put\nout the right eye of every one of them, thus making them abiding\nwitnesses to his power.\nThe people of the besieged city begged a respite of seven days.\nTo this the Ammonites consented, thinking thus to heighten the\nhonor of their expected triumph. Messengers were at once dispatched\nfrom Jabesh, to seek help from the tribes west of Jordan. They\ncarried the tidings to Gibeah, creating widespread terror. Saul,\nreturning at night from following the oxen in the field, heard the\nloud wail that told of some great calamity. He said, \u201cWhat aileth\nthe people that they weep?\u201d When the shameful story was repeated,\nall his dormant powers were roused. \u201cThe Spirit of God came upon\nSaul.... And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces,\nand sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of\nmessengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after\nSamuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen.\u201d\nThree hundred and thirty thousand men gathered on the plain of\nBezek, under the command of Saul. Messengers were immediately[613]\nsent to the besieged city with the assurance that they might expect\nFirst King of Israel 561\nhelp on the morrow, the very day on which they were to submit to\nthe Ammonites. By a rapid night march Saul and his army crossed\nthe Jordan and arrived before Jabesh in \u201cthe morning watch.\u201d Like\nGideon, dividing his force into three companies, he fell upon the\nAmmonite camp at that early hour, when, not suspecting danger,\nthey were least secure. In the panic that followed they were routed\nwith great slaughter. And \u201cthey which remained were scattered, so\nthat two of them were not left together.\u201d\nThe promptness and bravery of Saul, as well as the generalship\nshown in the successful conduct of so large a force, were qualities\nwhich the people of Israel had desired in a monarch, that they might\nbe able to cope with other nations. They now greeted him as their\nking, attributing the honor of the victory to human agencies and\nforgetting that without God\u2019s special blessing all their efforts would\nhave been in vain. In their enthusiasm some proposed to put to death\nthose who had at first refused to acknowledge the authority of Saul.\nBut the king interfered, saying, \u201cThere shall not a man be put to\ndeath this day: for today the Lord hath wrought salvation in Israel.\u201d\nHere Saul gave evidence of the change that had taken place in his\ncharacter. Instead of taking honor to himself, he gave the glory to\nGod. Instead of showing a desire for revenge, he manifested a spirit\nof compassion and forgiveness. This is unmistakable evidence that\nthe grace of God dwells in the heart.\nSamuel now proposed that a national assembly should be con-\nvoked at Gilgal, that the kingdom might there be publicly confirmed\nto Saul. It was done; \u201cand there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace\nofferings before the Lord; and there Saul and all the men of Israel\nrejoiced greatly.\u201d\nGilgal had been the place of Israel\u2019s first encampment in the\nPromised Land. It was here that Joshua, by divine direction, set up\nthe pillar of twelve stones to commemorate the miraculous passage\nof the Jordan. Here circumcision had been renewed. Here they\nhad kept the first Passover after the sin at Kadesh and the desert\nsojourn. Here the manna ceased. Here the Captain of the Lord\u2019s host\nhad revealed Himself as chief in command of the armies of Israel.\nFrom this place they marched to the overthrow of Jericho and the\nconquest of Ai. Here Achan met the penalty of his sin, and here [614]\nwas made that treaty with the Gibeonites which punished Israel\u2019s\n562 Patriarchs and Prophets\nneglect to ask counsel of God. Upon this plain, linked with so many\nthrilling associations, stood Samuel and Saul; and when the shouts\nof welcome to the king had died away, the aged prophet gave his\nparting words as ruler of the nation.\n\u201cBehold,\u201d he said, \u201cI have hearkened unto your voice in all that\nye said unto me, and have made a king over you. And now, behold,\nthe king walketh before you: and I am old and gray-headed; ...\nand I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.\nBehold, here I am: witness against me before the Lord, and before\nHis anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or\nwhom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand\nhave I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will\nrestore it you.\u201d\nWith one voice the people answered, \u201cThou hast not defrauded\nus, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man\u2019s\nhand.\u201d\nSamuel was not seeking merely to justify his own course. He\nhad previously set forth the principles that should govern both the\nking and the people, and he desired to add to his words the weight\nof his own example. From childhood he had been connected with\nthe work of God, and during his long life one object had been ever\nbefore him\u2014the glory of God and the highest good of Israel.\nBefore there could be any hope of prosperity for Israel they must\nbe led to repentance before God. In consequence of sin they had lost\ntheir faith in God and their discernment of His power and wisdom\nto rule the nation\u2014lost their confidence in His ability to vindicate\nHis cause. Before they could find true peace they must be led to see\nand confess the very sin of which they had been guilty. They had\ndeclared the object of the demand for a king to be, \u201cThat our king\nmay judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.\u201d Samuel\nrecounted the history of Israel, from the day when God brought them\nfrom Egypt. Jehovah, the King of kings, had gone out before them\nand had fought their battles. Often their sins had sold them into the\npower of their enemies, but no sooner did they turn from their evil\nways than God\u2019s mercy raised up a deliverer. The Lord sent Gideon\nand Barak, and \u201cJephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the[615]\nhand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelt safe.\u201d Yet when\nFirst King of Israel 563\nthreatened with danger they had declared, \u201cA king shall reign over\nus,\u201d when, said the prophet, \u201cJehovah your God was your King.\u201d\n\u201cNow therefore,\u201d continued Samuel, \u201cstand and see this great\nthing, which the Lord will do before your eyes. Is it not wheat\nharvest today? I will call unto the Lord, and He shall send thunder\nand rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great,\nwhich ye have done in the sight of the Lord, in asking you a king.\nSo Samuel called unto the Lord; and the Lord sent thunder and\nrain that day.\u201d At the time of wheat harvest, in May and June, no\nrain fell in the East. The sky was cloudless, and the air serene and\nmild. So violent a storm at this season filled all hearts with fear.\nIn humiliation the people now confessed their sin\u2014the very sin of\nwhich they had been guilty: \u201cPray for thy servants unto the Lord thy\nGod, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil,\nto ask us a king.\u201d\nSamuel did not leave the people in a state of discouragement, for\nthis would have prevented all effort for a better life. Satan would\nlead them to look upon God as severe and unforgiving, and they\nwould thus be exposed to manifold temptations. God is merciful\nand forgiving, ever desiring to show favor to His people when they\nwill obey His voice. \u201cFear not,\u201d was the message of God by His\nservant: \u201cye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from\nfollowing the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart; and turn\nye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot\nprofit nor deliver; for they are vain. For the Lord will not forsake\nHis people.\u201d\nSamuel said nothing of the slight which had been put upon him-\nself; he uttered no reproach for the ingratitude with which Israel had\nrepaid his lifelong devotion; but he assured them of his unceasing\ninterest for them: \u201cGod forbid that I should sin against the Lord in\nceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right\nway: only fear the Lord, and serve Him in truth with all your heart:\nfor consider how great things He hath done for you. But if ye shall\nstill do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.\u201d\nChapter 60\u2014The Presumption of Saul[616]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Samuel 13; 1 Samuel 14.\nAfter the assembly at Gilgal, Saul disbanded the army that had\nat his call arisen to overthrow the Ammonites, reserving only two\nthousand men to be stationed under his command at Michmash and\none thousand to attend his son Jonathan at Gibeah. Here was a\nserious error. His army was filled with hope and courage by the\nrecent victory; and had he proceeded at once against other enemies\nof Israel, a telling blow might have been struck for the liberties of\nthe nation.\nMeanwhile their warlike neighbors, the Philistines, were active.\nAfter the defeat at Ebenezer they had still retained possession of\nsome hill fortresses in the land of Israel, and now they established\nthemselves in the very heart of the country. In facilities, arms, and\nequipments the Philistines had great advantage over Israel. During\nthe long period of their oppressive rule they had endeavored to\nstrengthen their power by forbidding the Israelites to practice the\ntrade of smiths, lest they should make weapons of war. After the\nconclusion of peace the Hebrews had still resorted to the Philistine\ngarrisons for such work as needed to be done. Controlled by love\nof ease and the abject spirit induced by long oppression, the men of\nIsrael had, to a great extent, neglected to provide themselves with\nweapons of war. Bows and slings were used in warfare, and these\nthe Israelites could obtain; but there were none among them, except\nSaul and his son Jonathan, who possessed a spear or a sword.\nIt was not until the second year of Saul\u2019s reign that an attempt\nwas made to subdue the Philistines. The first blow was struck by\nJonathan, the king\u2019s son, who attacked and overcame their garrison\nat Geba. The Philistines, exasperated by this defeat, made ready for[617]\na speedy attack upon Israel. Saul now caused war to be proclaimed\nby the sound of the trumpet throughout the land, calling upon all the\n564\nPresumption of Saul 565\nmen of war, including the tribes across the Jordan, to assemble at\nGilgal. This summons was obeyed.\nThe Philistines had gathered an immense force at Michmash\u2014\n\u201cthirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as\nthe sand which is on the seashore in multitude.\u201d When the tidings\nreached Saul and his army at Gilgal, the people were appalled at\nthought of the mighty forces they would have to encounter in battle.\nThey were not prepared to meet the enemy, and many were so\nterrified that they dared not come to the test of an encounter. Some\ncrossed the Jordan, while others hid themselves in caves and pits\nand amid the rocks that abounded in that region. As the time for\nthe encounter drew near, the number of desertions rapidly increased,\nand those who did not withdraw from the ranks were filled with\nforeboding and terror.\nWhen Saul was first anointed king of Israel, he had received\nfrom Samuel explicit directions concerning the course to be pursued\nat this time. \u201cThou shalt go down before me to Gilgal,\u201d said the\nprophet; \u201cand, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt\nofferings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days\nshalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and show thee what thou shalt\ndo.\u201d 1 Samuel 10:8.\nDay after day Saul tarried, but without making decided efforts\ntoward encouraging the people and inspiring confidence in God.\nBefore the time appointed by the prophet had fully expired, he be-\ncame impatient at the delay and allowed himself to be discouraged\nby the trying circumstances that surrounded him. Instead of faith-\nfully seeking to prepare the people for the service that Samuel was\ncoming to perform, he indulged in unbelief and foreboding. The\nwork of seeking God by sacrifice was a most solemn and important\nwork; and God required that His people should search their hearts\nand repent of their sins, that the offering might be made with accep-\ntance before Him, and that His blessing might attend their efforts\nto conquer the enemy. But Saul had grown restless; and the people,\ninstead of trusting in God for help, were looking to the king whom\nthey had chosen, to lead and direct them.\nYet the Lord still cared for them and did not give them up to the [618]\ndisasters that would have come upon them if the frail arm of flesh\nhad become their only support. He brought them into close places,\n566 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthat they might be convicted of the folly of depending on man, and\nthat they might turn to Him as their only help. The time for the\nproving of Saul had come. He was now to show whether or not he\nwould depend on God and patiently wait according to His command,\nthus revealing himself as one whom God could trust in trying places\nas the ruler of His people, or whether he would be vacillating and\nunworthy of the sacred responsibility that had devolved upon him.\nWould the king whom Israel had chosen, listen to the Ruler of all\nkings? Would he turn the attention of his fainthearted soldiers to the\nOne in whom is everlasting strength and deliverance?\nWith growing impatience he awaited the arrival of Samuel and\nattributed the confusion and distress and desertion of his army to\nthe absence of the prophet. The appointed time came, but the man\nof God did not immediately appear. God\u2019s providence had detained\nHis servant. But Saul\u2019s restless, impulsive spirit would no longer be\nrestrained. Feeling that something must be done to calm the fears\nof the people, he determined to summon an assembly for religious\nservice, and by sacrifice entreat the divine aid. God had directed that\nonly those consecrated to the office should present sacrifices before\nHim. But Saul commanded, \u201cBring hither a burnt offering;\u201d and,\nequipped as he was with armor and weapons of war, he approached\nthe altar and offered sacrifice before God.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of\noffering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went\nout to meet him, that he might salute him.\u201d Samuel saw at once that\nSaul had gone contrary to the express directions that had been given\nhim. The Lord had spoken by His prophet that at this time He would\nreveal what Israel must do in this crisis. If Saul had fulfilled the\nconditions upon which divine help was promised, the Lord would\nhave wrought a marvelous deliverance for Israel, with the few who\nwere loyal to the king. But Saul was so well satisfied with himself\nand his work that he went out to meet the prophet as one who should\nbe commended rather than disapproved.\nSamuel\u2019s countenance was full of anxiety and trouble; but to[619]\n[620]\n[621]\nhis inquiry, \u201cWhat hast thou done?\u201d Saul offered excuses for his\npresumptuous act. He said: \u201cI saw that the people were scattered\nfrom me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that\nthe Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash; therefore\nPresumption of Saul 567\nsaid I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I\nhave not made supplication unto the Lord: I forced myself therefore,\nand offered a burnt offering.\n\u201cAnd Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast\nnot kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which He com-\nmanded thee: for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom\nupon Israel forever. But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the\nLord hath sought Him a man after His own heart, and the Lord hath\ncommanded him to be captain over His people.... And Samuel arose,\nand gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin.\u201d\nEither Israel must cease to be the people of God, or the principle\nupon which the monarchy was founded must be maintained, and\nthe nation must be governed by a divine power. If Israel would\nbe wholly the Lord\u2019s, if the will of the human and earthly were\nheld in subjection to the will of God, He would continue to be the\nRuler of Israel. So long as the king and the people would conduct\nthemselves as subordinate to God, so long He could be their defense.\nBut in Israel no monarchy could prosper that did not in all things\nacknowledge the supreme authority of God.\nIf Saul had shown a regard for the requirements of God in this\ntime of trial, God could have worked His will through him. His\nfailure now proved him unfit to be the vicegerent of God to His\npeople. He would mislead Israel. His will, rather than the will of\nGod, would be the controlling power. If Saul had been faithful,\nhis kingdom would have been established forever; but since he had\nfailed, the purpose of God must be accomplished by another. The\ngovernment of Israel must be committed to one who would rule the\npeople according to the will of Heaven.\nWe do not know what great interests may be at stake in the\nproving of God. There is no safety except in strict obedience to the\nword of God. All His promises are made upon condition of faith\nand obedience, and a failure to comply with His commands cuts [622]\noff the fulfillment to us of the rich provisions of the Scriptures. We\nshould not follow impulse, nor rely on the judgment of men; we\nshould look to the revealed will of God and walk according to His\ndefinite commandment, no matter what circumstances may surround\nus. God will take care of the results; by faithfulness to His word we\nmay in time of trial prove before men and angels that the Lord can\n568 Patriarchs and Prophets\ntrust us in difficult places to carry out His will, honor His name, and\nbless His people.\nSaul was in disfavor with God, and yet unwilling to humble his\nheart in penitence. What he lacked in real piety he would try to\nmake up by his zeal in the forms of religion. Saul was not ignorant\nof Israel\u2019s defeat when the ark of God was brought into the camp\nby Hophni and Phinehas; and yet, knowing all this, he determined\nto send for the sacred chest and its attendant priest. Could he by\nthis means inspire confidence in the people, he hoped to reassemble\nhis scattered army and give battle to the Philistines. He would now\ndispense with Samuel\u2019s presence and support, and thus free himself\nfrom the prophet\u2019s unwelcome criticisms and reproofs.\nThe Holy Spirit had been granted to Saul to enlighten his under-\nstanding and soften his heart. He had received faithful instruction\nand reproof from the prophet of God. And yet how great was his\nperversity! The history of Israel\u2019s first king presents a sad exam-\nple of the power of early wrong habits. In his youth Saul did not\nlove and fear God; and that impetuous spirit, not early trained to\nsubmission, was ever ready to rebel against divine authority. Those\nwho in their youth cherish a sacred regard for the will of God, and\nwho faithfully perform the duties of their position, will be prepared\nfor higher service in afterlife. But men cannot for years pervert the\npowers that God has given them, and then, when they choose to\nchange, find these powers fresh and free for an entirely opposite\ncourse.\nSaul\u2019s efforts to arouse the people proved unavailing. Finding\nhis force reduced to six hundred men, he left Gilgal and retired to the\nfortress at Geba, lately taken from the Philistines. This stronghold\nwas on the south side of a deep, rugged valley, or gorge, a few miles\nnorth of the site of Jerusalem. On the north side of the same valley,\nat Michmash, the Philistine force lay encamped while detachments\nof troops went out in different directions to ravage the country.\nGod had permitted matters to be thus brought to a crisis that He[623]\nmight rebuke the perversity of Saul and teach His people a lesson\nof humility and faith. Because of Saul\u2019s sin in his presumptuous\noffering, the Lord would not give him the honor of vanquishing the\nPhilistines. Jonathan, the king\u2019s son, a man who feared the Lord,\nwas chosen as the instrument to deliver Israel. Moved by a divine\nPresumption of Saul 569\nimpulse, he proposed to his armor-bearer that they should make a\nsecret attack upon the enemy\u2019s camp. \u201cIt may be,\u201d he urged, \u201cthat\nthe Lord will work for us: for there is no restraint to the Lord to save\nby many or by few.\u201d\nThe armor-bearer, who also was a man of faith and prayer, en-\ncouraged the design, and together they withdrew from the camp,\nsecretly, lest their purpose should be opposed. With earnest prayer\nto the Guide of their fathers, they agreed upon a sign by which they\nmight determine how to proceed. Then passing down into the gorge\nseparating the two armies, they silently threaded their way, under\nthe shadow of the cliff, and partially concealed by the mounds and\nridges of the valley. Approaching the Philistine fortress, they were\nrevealed to the view of their enemies, who said, tauntingly, \u201cBehold,\nthe Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid them-\nselves,\u201d then challenged them, \u201cCome up to us, and we will show\nyou a thing,\u201d meaning that they would punish the two Israelites for\ntheir daring. This challenge was the token that Jonathan and his com-\npanion had agreed to accept as evidence that the Lord would prosper\ntheir undertaking. Passing now from the sight of the Philistines, and\nchoosing a secret and difficult path, the warriors made their way to\nthe summit of a cliff that had been deemed inaccessible, and was not\nvery strongly guarded. Thus they penetrated the enemy\u2019s camp and\nslew the sentinels, who, overcome with surprise and fear, offered no\nresistance.\nAngels of heaven shielded Jonathan and his attendant, angels\nfought by their side, and the Philistines fell before them. The earth\ntrembled as though a great multitude with horsemen and chariots\nwere approaching. Jonathan recognized the tokens of divine aid, and\neven the Philistines knew that God was working for the deliverance\nof Israel. Great fear seized upon the host, both in the field and in the\ngarrison. In the confusion, mistaking their own soldiers for enemies,\nthe Philistines began to slay one another.\nSoon the noise of the battle was heard in the camp of Israel. [624]\nThe king\u2019s sentinels reported that there was great confusion among\nthe Philistines, and that their numbers were decreasing. Yet it was\nnot known that any part of the Hebrew army had left the camp.\nUpon inquiry it was found that none were absent except Jonathan\nand his armor-bearer. But seeing that the Philistines were meeting\n570 Patriarchs and Prophets\nwith a repulse, Saul led his army to join the assault. The Hebrews\nwho had deserted to the enemy now turned against them; great\nnumbers also came out of their hiding places, and as the Philistines\nfled, discomfited, Saul\u2019s army committed terrible havoc upon the\nfugitives.\nDetermined to make the most of his advantage, the king rashly\nforbade his soldiers to partake of food for the entire day, enforcing\nhis command by the solemn imprecation, \u201cCursed be the man that\neateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine ene-\nmies.\u201d The victory had already been gained, without Saul\u2019s knowl-\nedge or co-operation, but he hoped to distinguish himself by the utter\ndestruction of the vanquished army. The command to refrain from\nfood was prompted by selfish ambition, and it showed the king to\nbe indifferent to the needs of his people when these conflicted with\nhis desire for self-exaltation. To confirm his prohibition by a solemn\noath showed Saul to be both rash and profane. The very words of\nthe curse give evidence that Saul\u2019s zeal was for himself, and not for\nthe honor of God. He declared his object to be, not \u201cthat the Lord\nmay be avenged on His enemies,\u201d but \u201cthat I may be avenged on\nmine enemies.\u201d\nThe prohibition resulted in leading the people to transgress the\ncommand of God. They had been engaged in warfare all day, and\nwere faint for want of food; and as soon as the hours of restriction\nwere over, they fell upon the spoil and devoured the flesh with the\nblood, thus violating the law that forbade the eating of blood.\nDuring the day\u2019s battle Jonathan, who had not heard of the king\u2019s\ncommand, unwittingly offended by eating a little honey as he passed\nthrough a wood. Saul learned of this at evening. He had declared\nthat the violation of his edict should be punished with death; and\nthough Jonathan had not been guilty of a willful sin, though God\nhad miraculously preserved his life and had wrought deliverance\nthrough him, the king declared that the sentence must be executed.\nTo spare the life of his son would have been an acknowledgment on[625]\nthe part of Saul that he had sinned in making so rash a vow. This\nwould have been humiliating to his pride. \u201cGod do so, and more\nalso,\u201d was his terrible sentence: \u201cthou shalt surely die, Jonathan.\u201d\nSaul could not claim the honor of the victory, but he hoped to\nbe honored for his zeal in maintaining the sacredness of his oath.\nPresumption of Saul 571\nEven at the sacrifice of his son, he would impress upon his subjects\nthe fact that the royal authority must be maintained. At Gilgal,\nbut a short time before, Saul had presumed to officiate as priest,\ncontrary to the command of God. When reproved by Samuel, he\nhad stubbornly justified himself. Now, when his own command was\ndisobeyed\u2014though the command was unreasonable and had been\nviolated through ignorance\u2014the king and father sentenced his son\nto death.\nThe people refused to allow the sentence to be executed. Braving\nthe anger of the king, they declared, \u201cShall Jonathan die, who hath\nwrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the Lord liveth,\nthere shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath\nwrought with God this day.\u201d The proud monarch dared not disregard\nthis unanimous verdict, and the life of Jonathan was preserved.\nSaul could not but feel that his son was preferred before him,\nboth by the people and by the Lord. Jonathan\u2019s deliverance was a\nsevere reproof to the king\u2019s rashness. He felt a presentiment that his\ncurses would return upon his own head. He did not longer continue\nthe war with the Philistines, but returned to his home, moody and\ndissatisfied.\nThose who are most ready to excuse or justify themselves in sin\nare often most severe in judging and condemning others. Many, like\nSaul, bring upon themselves the displeasure of God, but they reject\ncounsel and despise reproof. Even when convinced that the Lord\nis not with them, they refuse to see in themselves the cause of their\ntrouble. They cherish a proud, boastful spirit, while they indulge in\ncruel judgment or severe rebuke of others who are better than they.\nWell would it be for such self-constituted judges to ponder those\nwords of Christ: \u201cWith what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged:\nand with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\u201d\nMatthew 7:2.\nOften those who are seeking to exalt themselves are brought\ninto positions where their true character is revealed. So it was\nin the case of Saul. His own course convinced the people that [626]\nkingly honor and authority were dearer to him than justice, mercy, or\nbenevolence. Thus the people were led to see their error in rejecting\nthe government that God had given them. They had exchanged the\n572 Patriarchs and Prophets\npious prophet, whose prayers had brought down blessings, for a king\nwho in his blind zeal had prayed for a curse upon them.\nHad not the men of Israel interposed to save the life of Jonathan,\ntheir deliverer would have perished by the king\u2019s decree. With\nwhat misgivings must that people afterward have followed Saul\u2019s\nguidance! How bitter the thought that he had been placed upon the\nthrone by their own act! The Lord bears long with the waywardness\nof men, and to all He grants opportunity to see and forsake their\nsins; but while He may seem to prosper those who disregard His will\nand despise His warnings, He will, in His own time, surely make\nmanifest their folly.\nChapter 61\u2014Saul Rejected [627]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Samuel 15.\nSaul had failed to bear the test of faith in the trying situation\nat Gilgal, and had brought dishonor upon the service of God; but\nhis errors were not yet irretrievable, and the Lord would grant him\nanother opportunity to learn the lesson of unquestioning faith in His\nword and obedience to His commands.\nWhen reproved by the prophet at Gilgal, Saul saw no great sin in\nthe course he had pursued. He felt that he had been treated unjustly,\nand endeavored to vindicate his actions and offered excuses for his\nerror. From that time he had little intercourse with the prophet.\nSamuel loved Saul as his own son, while Saul, bold and ardent in\ntemper, had held the prophet in high regard; but he resented Samuel\u2019s\nrebuke, and thenceforth avoided him so far as possible.\nBut the Lord sent His servant with another message to Saul. By\nobedience he might still prove his fidelity to God and his worthiness\nto walk before Israel. Samuel came to the king and delivered the\nword of the Lord. That the monarch might realize the importance of\nheeding the command, Samuel expressly declared that he spoke by\ndivine direction, by the same authority that had called Saul to the\nthrone. The prophet said, \u201cThus saith the Lord of hosts, I remember\nthat which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the\nway, when he came up from Egypt. Now go and smite Amalek, and\nutterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both\nman and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.\u201d\nThe Amalekites had been the first to make war upon Israel in the\nwilderness; and for this sin, together with their defiance of God and\ntheir debasing idolatry, the Lord, through Moses, had pronounced\nsentence upon them. By divine direction the history of their cruelty\ntoward Israel had been recorded, with the command, \u201cThou shalt blot [628]\nout the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not\nforget it.\u201d Deuteronomy 25:19. For four hundred years the execution\n573\n574 Patriarchs and Prophets\nof this sentence had been deferred; but the Amalekites had not turned\nfrom their sins. The Lord knew that this wicked people would, if it\nwere possible, blot out His people and His worship from the earth.\nNow the time had come for the sentence, so long delayed, to be\nexecuted.\nThe forbearance that God has exercised toward the wicked, em-\nboldens men in transgression; but their punishment will be none the\nless certain and terrible for being long delayed. \u201cThe Lord shall\nrise up as in Mount Perazim, He shall be wroth as in the valley of\nGibeon, that He may do His work, His strange work; and bring to\npass His act, His strange act.\u201d Isaiah 28:21. To our merciful God the\nact of punishment is a strange act. \u201cAs I live, saith the Lord God,\nI have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked\nturn from his way and live.\u201d Ezekiel 33:11. The Lord is \u201cmerciful\nand gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,\n... forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.\u201d Yet He will \u201cby no\nmeans clear the guilty.\u201d Exodus 34:6, 7. While He does not delight\nin vengeance, He will execute judgment upon the transgressors of\nHis law. He is forced to do this, to preserve the inhabitants of the\nearth from utter depravity and ruin. In order to save some He must\ncut off those who have become hardened in sin. \u201cThe Lord is slow\nto anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked.\u201d\nNahum 1:3. By terrible things in righteousness He will vindicate the\nauthority of His downtrodden law. And the very fact of His reluc-\ntance to execute justice testifies to the enormity of the sins that call\nforth His judgments and to the severity of the retribution awaiting\nthe transgressor.\nBut while inflicting judgment, God remembered mercy. The\nAmalekites were to be destroyed, but the Kenites, who dwelt among\nthem, were spared. This people, though not wholly free from idol-\natry, were worshipers of God and were friendly to Israel. Of this\ntribe was the brother-in-law of Moses, Hobab, who had accompa-\nnied the Israelites in their travels through the wilderness, and by his\nknowledge of the country had rendered them valuable assistance.\nSince the defeat of the Philistines at Michmash, Saul had made\nwar against Moab, Ammon, and Edom, and against the Amalekites[629]\nand the Philistines; and wherever he turned his arms, he gained fresh\nvictories. On receiving the commission against the Amalekites, he\nSaul Rejected 575\nat once proclaimed war. To his own authority was added that of\nthe prophet, and at the call to battle the men of Israel flocked to\nhis standard. The expedition was not to be entered upon for the\npurpose of self-aggrandizement; the Israelites were not to receive\neither the honor of the conquest or the spoils of their enemies. They\nwere to engage in the war solely as an act of obedience to God,\nfor the purpose of executing His judgment upon the Amalekites.\nGod intended that all nations should behold the doom of that people\nthat had defied His sovereignty, and should mark that they were\ndestroyed by the very people whom they had despised.\n\u201cSaul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to\nShur, that is over against Egypt. And he took Agag the king of the\nAmalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge\nof the sword. But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of\nthe sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all\nthat was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but everything\nthat was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.\u201d\nThis victory over the Amalekites was the most brilliant victory\nthat Saul had ever gained, and it served to rekindle the pride of heart\nthat was his greatest peril. The divine edict devoting the enemies\nof God to utter destruction was but partially fulfilled. Ambitious to\nheighten the honor of his triumphal return by the presence of a royal\ncaptive, Saul ventured to imitate the customs of the nations around\nhim and spared Agag, the fierce and warlike king of the Amalekites.\nThe people reserved for themselves the finest of the flocks, herds,\nand beasts of burden, excusing their sin on the ground that the cattle\nwere reserved to be offered as sacrifices to the Lord. It was their\npurpose, however, to use these merely as a substitute, to save their\nown cattle.\nSaul had now been subjected to the final test. His presumptuous\ndisregard of the will of God, showing his determination to rule as\nan independent monarch, proved that he could not be trusted with\nroyal power as the vicegerent of the Lord. While Saul and his army\nwere marching home in the flush of victory, there was deep anguish\nin the home of Samuel the prophet. He had received a message from\nthe Lord denouncing the course of the king: \u201cIt repenteth Me that [630]\nI have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following\nMe, and hath not performed My commandments.\u201d The prophet was\n576 Patriarchs and Prophets\ndeeply grieved over the course of the rebellious king, and he wept\nand prayed all night for a reversing of the terrible sentence.\nGod\u2019s repentance is not like man\u2019s repentance. \u201cThe Strength\nof Israel will not lie nor repent: for He is not a man, that He should\nrepent.\u201d Man\u2019s repentance implies a change of mind. God\u2019s repen-\ntance implies a change of circumstances and relations. Man may\nchange his relation to God by complying with the conditions upon\nwhich he may be brought into the divine favor, or he may, by his\nown action, place himself outside the favoring condition; but the\nLord is the same \u201cyesterday, and today, and forever.\u201d Hebrews 13:8.\nSaul\u2019s disobedience changed his relation to God; but the conditions\nof acceptance with God were unaltered\u2014God\u2019s requirements were\nstill the same, for with Him there \u201cis no variableness, neither shadow\nof turning.\u201d James 1:17.\nWith an aching heart the prophet set forth the next morning to\nmeet the erring king. Samuel cherished a hope that, upon reflection,\nSaul might become conscious of his sin, and by repentance and\nhumiliation be again restored to the divine favor. But when the first\nstep is taken in the path of transgression the way becomes easy.\nSaul, debased by his disobedience, came to meet Samuel with a lie\nupon his lips. He exclaimed, \u201cBlessed be thou of the Lord: I have\nperformed the commandment of the Lord.\u201d\nThe sounds that fell on the prophet\u2019s ears disproved the statement\nof the disobedient king. To the pointed question, \u201cWhat meaneth\nthen this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the\noxen which I hear?\u201d Saul made answer, \u201cThey have brought them\nfrom the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and\nof the oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God; and the rest we have\nutterly destroyed.\u201d The people had obeyed Saul\u2019s directions; but in\norder to shield himself, he was willing to charge upon them the sin\nof his disobedience.\nThe message of Saul\u2019s rejection brought unspeakable grief to\nthe heart of Samuel. It had to be delivered before the whole army\nof Israel, when they were filled with pride and triumphal rejoicing\nover a victory that was accredited to the valor and generalship of[631]\ntheir king, for Saul had not associated God with the success of\nIsrael in this conflict; but when the prophet saw the evidence of\nSaul\u2019s rebellion, he was stirred with indignation that he, who had\nSaul Rejected 577\nbeen so highly favored of God, should transgress the commandment\nof Heaven and lead Israel into sin. Samuel was not deceived by\nthe subterfuge of the king. With mingled grief and indignation he\ndeclared, \u201cStay, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me\nthis night.... When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not\nmade the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed thee\nking over Israel?\u201d He repeated the command of the Lord concerning\nAmalek, and demanded the reason of the king\u2019s disobedience.\nSaul persisted in self-justification: \u201cYea, I have obeyed the voice\nof the Lord, and have gone the way which the Lord sent me, and\nhave brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed\nthe Amalekites. But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen,\nthe chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to\nsacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal.\u201d\nIn stern and solemn words the prophet swept away the refuge\nof lies and pronounced the irrevocable sentence: \u201cHath the Lord as\ngreat delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice\nof the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken\nthan the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and\nstubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected\nthe word of the Lord, He hath also rejected thee from being king.\u201d\nAs the king heard this fearful sentence he cried out, \u201cI have\nsinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and\nthy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.\u201d\nTerrified by the denunciation of the prophet, Saul acknowledged his\nguilt, which he had before stubbornly denied; but he still persisted in\ncasting blame upon the people, declaring that he had sinned through\nfear of them.\nIt was not sorrow for sin, but fear of its penalty, that actuated\nthe king of Israel as he entreated Samuel, \u201cI pray thee, pardon my\nsin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord.\u201d If Saul\nhad had true repentance, he would have made public confession of\nhis sin; but it was his chief anxiety to maintain his authority and\nretain the allegiance of the people. He desired the honor of Samuel\u2019s\npresence in order to strengthen his own influence with the nation.\n\u201cI will not return with thee,\u201d was the answer of the prophet: \u201cfor [632]\nthou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected\nthee from being king over Israel.\u201d As Samuel turned to depart, the\n578 Patriarchs and Prophets\nking, in an agony of fear, laid hold of his mantle to hold him back,\nbut it rent in his hands. Upon this, the prophet declared, \u201cThe Lord\nhath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it\nto a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou.\u201d\nSaul was more disturbed by the alienation of Samuel than by the\ndispleasure of God. He knew that the people had greater confidence\nin the prophet than in himself. Should another by divine command be\nnow anointed king, Saul felt that it would be impossible to maintain\nhis own authority. He feared an immediate revolt should Samuel\nutterly forsake him. Saul entreated the prophet to honor him before\nthe elders and the people by publicly uniting with him in a religious\nservice. By divine direction Samuel yielded to the king\u2019s request,\nthat no occasion might be given for a revolt. But he remained only\nas a silent witness of the service.\nAn act of justice, stern and terrible, was yet to be performed.\nSamuel must publicly vindicate the honor of God and rebuke the\ncourse of Saul. He commanded that the king of the Amalekites be\nbrought before him. Above all who had fallen by the sword of Israel,\nAgag was the most guilty and merciless; one who had hated and\nsought to destroy the people of God, and whose influence had been\nstrongest to promote idolatry. He came at the prophet\u2019s command,\nflattering himself that the danger of death was past. Samuel declared:\n\u201cAs thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be\nchildless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord.\u201d This done, Samuel returned to his home at Ramah, Saul\nto his at Gibeah. Only once thereafter did the prophet and the king\never meet each other.\nWhen called to the throne, Saul had a humble opinion of his\nown capabilities, and was willing to be instructed. He was deficient\nin knowledge and experience and had serious defects of character.\nBut the Lord granted him the Holy Spirit as a guide and helper,\nand placed him in a position where he could develop the qualities\nrequisite for a ruler of Israel. Had he remained humble, seeking\nconstantly to be guided by divine wisdom, he would have been[633]\nenabled to discharge the duties of his high position with success and\nhonor. Under the influence of divine grace every good quality would\nhave been gaining strength, while evil tendencies would have lost\ntheir power. This is the work which the Lord proposes to do for\nSaul Rejected 579\nall who consecrate themselves to Him. There are many whom He\nhas called to positions in His work because they have a humble and\nteachable spirit. In His providence He places them where they may\nlearn of Him. He will reveal to them their defects of character, and\nto all who seek His aid He will give strength to correct their errors.\nBut Saul presumed upon his exaltation, and dishonored God by\nunbelief and disobedience. Though when first called to the throne\nhe was humble and self-distrustful, success made him self-confident.\nThe very first victory of his reign had kindled that pride of heart\nwhich was his greatest danger. The valor and military skill displayed\nin the deliverance of Jabesh-gilead had roused the enthusiasm of the\nwhole nation. The people honored their king, forgetting that he was\nbut the agent by whom God had wrought; and though at first Saul\nascribed the glory to God, he afterward took honor to himself. He\nlost sight of his dependence upon God, and in heart departed from\nthe Lord. Thus the way was prepared for his sin of presumption and\nsacrilege at Gilgal. The same blind self-confidence led him to reject\nSamuel\u2019s reproof. Saul acknowledged Samuel to be a prophet sent\nfrom God; hence he should have accepted the reproof, though he\ncould not himself see that he had sinned. Had he been willing to\nsee and confess his error, this bitter experience would have proved a\nsafeguard for the future.\nIf the Lord had then separated Himself entirely from Saul, He\nwould not have again spoken to him through His prophet, entrusting\nhim with a definite work to perform, that he might correct the errors\nof the past. When one who professes to be a child of God becomes\ncareless in doing His will, thereby influencing others to be irreverent\nand unmindful of the Lord\u2019s injunctions, it is still possible for his\nfailures to be turned into victories if he will but accept reproof with\ntrue contrition of soul and return to God in humility and faith. The\nhumiliation of defeat often proves a blessing by showing us our\ninability to do the will of God without His aid.\nWhen Saul turned away from the reproof sent him by God\u2019s Holy [634]\nSpirit, and persisted in his stubborn self-justification, he rejected the\nonly means by which God could work to save him from himself.\nHe had willfully separated himself from God. He could not receive\ndivine help or guidance until he should return to God by confession\nof his sin.\n580 Patriarchs and Prophets\nAt Gilgal, Saul had made an appearance of great conscientious-\nness, as he stood before the army of Israel offering up a sacrifice to\nGod. But his piety was not genuine. A religious service performed\nin direct opposition to the command of God only served to weaken\nSaul\u2019s hands, placing him beyond the help that God was so willing\nto grant him.\nIn his expedition against Amalek, Saul thought he had done all\nthat was essential of that which the Lord had commanded him; but\nthe Lord was not pleased with partial obedience, nor willing to pass\nover what had been neglected through so plausible a motive. God\nhas given men no liberty to depart from His requirements. The Lord\nhad declared to Israel, \u201cYe shall not do ... every man whatsoever\nis right in his own eyes;\u201d but ye shall \u201cobserve and hear all these\nwords which I command thee.\u201d Deuteronomy 12:8, 28. In deciding\nupon any course of action we are not to ask whether we can see that\nharm will result from it, but whether it is in keeping with the will of\nGod. \u201cThere is a way which seemeth right unto a man; but the end\nthereof are the ways of death.\u201d Proverbs 14:12.\n\u201cTo obey is better than sacrifice.\u201d The sacrificial offerings were\nin themselves of no value in the sight of God. They were designed\nto express on the part of the offerer penitence for sin and faith in\nChrist and to pledge future obedience to the law of God. But without\npenitence, faith, and an obedient heart, the offerings were worthless.\nWhen, in direct violation of God\u2019s command, Saul proposed to\npresent a sacrifice of that which God had devoted to destruction,\nopen contempt was shown for the divine authority. The service\nwould have been an insult to Heaven. Yet with the sin of Saul and\nits result before us, how many are pursuing a similar course. While\nthey refuse to believe and obey some requirement of the Lord, they\npersevere in offering up to God their formal services of religion.\nThere is no response of the Spirit of God to such service. No matter\nhow zealous men may be in their observance of religious ceremonies,\nthe Lord cannot accept them if they persist in willful violation of\none of His commands.\n\u201cRebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as[635]\niniquity and idolatry.\u201d Rebellion originated with Satan, and all re-\nbellion against God is directly due to satanic influence. Those who\nset themselves against the government of God have entered into an\nSaul Rejected 581\nalliance with the archapostate, and he will exercise his power and\ncunning to captivate the senses and mislead the understanding. He\nwill cause everything to appear in a false light. Like our first parents,\nthose who are under his bewitching spell see only the great benefits\nto be received by transgression.\nNo stronger evidence can be given of Satan\u2019s delusive power\nthan that many who are thus led by him deceive themselves with\nthe belief that they are in the service of God. When Korah, Dathan,\nand Abiram rebelled against the authority of Moses, they thought\nthey were opposing only a human leader, a man like themselves;\nand they came to believe that they were verily doing God service.\nBut in rejecting God\u2019s chosen instrument they rejected Christ; they\ninsulted the Spirit of God. So, in the days of Christ, the Jewish\nscribes and elders, who professed great zeal for the honor of God,\ncrucified His Son. The same spirit still exists in the hearts of those\nwho set themselves to follow their own will in opposition to the will\nof God.\nSaul had had the most ample proof that Samuel was divinely\ninspired. His venturing to disregard the command of God through\nthe prophet was against the dictates of reason and sound judgment.\nHis fatal presumption must be attributed to satanic sorcery. Saul had\nmanifested great zeal in suppressing idolatry and witchcraft; yet in\nhis disobedience to the divine command he had been actuated by the\nsame spirit of opposition to God and had been as really inspired by\nSatan as are those who practice sorcery; and when reproved, he had\nadded stubbornness to rebellion. He could have offered no greater\ninsult to the Spirit of God had he openly united with idolaters.\nIt is a perilous step to slight the reproofs and warnings of God\u2019s\nword or of His Spirit. Many, like Saul, yield to temptation until they\nbecome blind to the true character of sin. They flatter themselves\nthat they have had some good object in view, and have done no\nwrong in departing from the Lord\u2019s requirements. Thus they do\ndespite to the Spirit of grace, until its voice is no longer heard, and\nthey are left to the delusions which they have chosen.\nIn Saul, God had given to Israel a king after their own heart, as [636]\nSamuel said when the kingdom was confirmed to Saul at Gilgal,\n\u201cBehold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired.\u201d\n1 Samuel 12:13. Comely in person, of noble stature and princely\n582 Patriarchs and Prophets\nbearing, his appearance accorded with their conceptions of royal\ndignity; and his personal valor and his ability in the conduct of\narmies were the qualities which they regarded as best calculated\nto secure respect and honor from other nations. They felt little\nsolicitude that their king should possess those higher qualities which\nalone could fit him to rule with justice and equity. They did not ask\nfor one who had true nobility of character, who possessed the love\nand fear of God. They had not sought counsel from God as to the\nqualities a ruler should possess, in order to preserve their distinctive,\nholy character as His chosen people. They were not seeking God\u2019s\nway, but their own way. Therefore God gave them such a king as\nthey desired\u2014one whose character was a reflection of their own.\nTheir hearts were not in submission to God, and their king also was\nunsubdued by divine grace. Under the rule of this king they would\nobtain the experience necessary in order that they might see their\nerror, and return to their allegiance to God.\nYet the Lord, having placed on Saul the responsibility of the\nkingdom, did not leave him to himself. He caused the Holy Spirit to\nrest upon Saul to reveal to him his own weakness and his need of\ndivine grace; and had Saul relied upon God, God would have been\nwith him. So long as his will was controlled by the will of God, so\nlong as he yielded to the discipline of His Spirit, God could crown\nhis efforts with success. But when Saul chose to act independently\nof God, the Lord could no longer be his guide, and was forced to set\nhim aside. Then He called to the throne \u201ca man after His own heart\u201d\n(1 Samuel 13:14)\u2014not one who was faultless in character, but who,\ninstead of trusting to himself, would rely upon God, and be guided\nby His Spirit; who, when he sinned, would submit to reproof and\ncorrection.\nChapter 62\u2014The Anointing of David [637]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Samuel 16:1-13.\nA few miles south of Jerusalem, \u201cthe city of the great King,\u201d is\nBethlehem, where David, the son of Jesse, was born more than a\nthousand years before the infant Jesus was cradled in the manger\nand worshiped by the Wise Men from the East. Centuries before the\nadvent of the Saviour, David, in the freshness of boyhood, kept watch\nof his flocks as they grazed on the hills surrounding Bethlehem. The\nsimple shepherd boy sang the songs of his own composing, and the\nmusic of his harp made a sweet accompaniment to the melody of his\nfresh young voice. The Lord had chosen David, and was preparing\nhim, in his solitary life with his flocks, for the work He designed to\ncommit to his trust in after years.\nWhile David was thus living in the retirement of his humble\nshepherd\u2019s life, the Lord God was speaking about him to the prophet\nSamuel. \u201cAnd the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn\nfor Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill\nthine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite:\nfor I have provided Me a king among his sons.... Take an heifer with\nthee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the Lord. And call Jesse to\nthe sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt\nanoint unto Me him whom I name unto thee. And Samuel did that\nwhich the Lord spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of\nthe town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?\nAnd he said, Peaceably.\u201d The elders accepted an invitation to the\nsacrifice, and Samuel called also Jesse and his sons. The altar was\nbuilt and the sacrifice was ready. All the household of Jesse were\npresent, with the exception of David, the youngest son, who had\nbeen left to guard the sheep, for it was not safe to leave the flocks\nunprotected.\nWhen the sacrifice was ended, and before partaking of the offer- [638]\ning feast, Samuel began his prophetic inspection of the noble-appear-\n583\n584 Patriarchs and Prophets\ning sons of Jesse. Eliab was the eldest, and more nearly resembled\nSaul for stature and beauty than the others. His comely features\nand finely developed form attracted the attention of the prophet.\nAs Samuel looked upon his princely bearing, he thought, \u201cThis is\nindeed the man whom God has chosen as successor to Saul,\u201d and\nhe waited for the divine sanction that he might anoint him. But\nJehovah did not look upon the outward appearance. Eliab did not\nfear the Lord. Had he been called to the throne, he would have been\na proud, exacting ruler. The Lord\u2019s word to Samuel was, \u201cLook not\non his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have\nrefused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh\non the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.\u201d No\noutward beauty can recommend the soul to God. The wisdom and\nexcellence revealed in the character and deportment, express the\ntrue beauty of the man; and it is the inner worth, the excellency of\nthe heart, that determines our acceptance with the Lord of hosts.\nHow deeply should we feel this truth in the judgment of ourselves\nand others. We may learn from the mistake of Samuel how vain\nis the estimation that rests on beauty of face or nobility of stature.\nWe may see how incapable is man\u2019s wisdom of understanding the\nsecrets of the heart or of comprehending the counsels of God without\nspecial enlightenment from heaven. The thoughts and ways of God\nin relation to His creatures are above our finite minds; but we may\nbe assured that His children will be brought to fill the very place\nfor which they are qualified, and will be enabled to accomplish the\nvery work committed to their hands, if they will but submit their\nwill to God, that His beneficent plans may not be frustrated by the\nperversity of man.\nEliab passed from the inspection of Samuel, and the six brothers\nwho were in attendance at the service followed in succession to be\nobserved by the prophet; but the Lord did not signify His choice\nof any one of them. With painful suspense Samuel had looked\nupon the last of the young men; the prophet was perplexed and\nbewildered. He inquired of Jesse, \u201cAre here all thy children?\u201d The\nfather answered, \u201cThere remaineth yet the youngest, and behold, he\nkeepeth the sheep.\u201d Samuel directed that he should be summoned,\nsaying, \u201cWe will not sit down till he come hither.\u201d\nThe lonely shepherd was startled by the unexpected call of the[639]\n[640]\n[641]\nAnointing of David 585\nmessenger, who announced that the prophet had come to Bethlehem\nand had sent for him. With surprise he questioned why the prophet\nand judge of Israel should desire to see him; but without delay\nhe obeyed the call. \u201cNow he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful\ncountenance, and goodly to look to.\u201d As Samuel beheld with pleasure\nthe handsome, manly, modest shepherd boy, the voice of the Lord\nspoke to the prophet, saying, \u201cArise, anoint him: for this is he.\u201d\nDavid had proved himself brave and faithful in the humble office\nof a shepherd, and now God had chosen him to be captain of His\npeople. \u201cThen Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the\nmidst of [from among] his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came\nupon David from that day forward.\u201d The prophet had accomplished\nhis appointed work, and with a relieved heart he returned to Ramah.\nSamuel had not made known his errand, even to the family of\nJesse, and the ceremony of anointing David had been performed in\nsecret. It was an intimation to the youth of the high destiny awaiting\nhim, that amid all the varied experiences and perils of his coming\nyears, this knowledge might inspire him to be true to the purpose of\nGod to be accomplished by his life.\nThe great honor conferred upon David did not serve to elate\nhim. Notwithstanding the high position which he was to occupy, he\nquietly continued his employment, content to await the development\nof the Lord\u2019s plans in His own time and way. As humble and modest\nas before his anointing, the shepherd boy returned to the hills and\nwatched and guarded his flocks as tenderly as ever. But with new\ninspiration he composed his melodies and played upon his harp.\nBefore him spread a landscape of rich and varied beauty. The vines,\nwith their clustering fruit, brightened in the sunshine. The forest\ntrees, with their green foliage, swayed in the breeze. He beheld the\nsun flooding the heavens with light, coming forth as a bridegroom\nout of his chamber and rejoicing as a strong man to run a race.\nThere were the bold summits of the hills reaching toward the sky; in\nthe faraway distance rose the barren cliffs of the mountain wall of\nMoab; above all spread the tender blue of the overarching heavens.\nAnd beyond was God. He could not see Him, but His works were\nfull of His praise. The light of day, gilding forest and mountain,\nmeadow and stream, carried the mind up to behold the Father of\nlights, the Author of every good and perfect gift. Daily revelations [642]\n586 Patriarchs and Prophets\nof the character and majesty of his Creator filled the young poet\u2019s\nheart with adoration and rejoicing. In contemplation of God and His\nworks the faculties of David\u2019s mind and heart were developing and\nstrengthening for the work of his afterlife. He was daily coming into\na more intimate communion with God. His mind was constantly\npenetrating into new depths for fresh themes to inspire his song\nand to wake the music of his harp. The rich melody of his voice\npoured out upon the air, echoed from the hills as if responsive to the\nrejoicing of the angels\u2019 songs in heaven.\nWho can measure the results of those years of toil and wandering\namong the lonely hills? The communion with nature and with God,\nthe care of his flocks, the perils and deliverances, the griefs and joys,\nof his lowly lot, were not only to mold the character of David and\nto influence his future life, but through the psalms of Israel\u2019s sweet\nsinger they were in all coming ages to kindle love and faith in the\nhearts of God\u2019s people, bringing them nearer to the ever-loving heart\nof Him in whom all His creatures live.\nDavid, in the beauty and vigor of his young manhood, was\npreparing to take a high position with the noblest of the earth. His\ntalents, as precious gifts from God, were employed to extol the glory\nof the divine Giver. His opportunities of contemplation and medi-\ntation served to enrich him with that wisdom and piety that made\nhim beloved of God and angels. As he contemplated the perfections\nof his Creator, clearer conceptions of God opened before his soul.\nObscure themes were illuminated, difficulties were made plain, per-\nplexities were harmonized, and each ray of new light called forth\nfresh bursts of rapture, and sweeter anthems of devotion, to the glory\nof God and the Redeemer. The love that moved him, the sorrows\nthat beset him, the triumphs that attended him, were all themes for\nhis active thought; and as he beheld the love of God in all the prov-\nidences of his life, his heart throbbed with more fervent adoration\nand gratitude, his voice rang out in a richer melody, his harp was\nswept with more exultant joy; and the shepherd boy proceeded from\nstrength to strength, from knowledge to knowledge; for the Spirit of\nthe Lord was upon him.\nChapter 63\u2014David and Goliath [643]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Samuel 16:14-23; 17.\nWhen King Saul realized that he had been rejected by God, and\nwhen he felt the force of the words of denunciation that had been\naddressed to him by the prophet, he was filled with bitter rebellion\nand despair. It was not true repentance that had bowed the proud head\nof the king. He had no clear perception of the offensive character\nof his sin, and did not arouse to the work of reforming his life, but\nbrooded over what he thought was the injustice of God in depriving\nhim of the throne of Israel and in taking the succession away from\nhis posterity. He was ever occupied in anticipating the ruin that\nhad been brought upon his house. He felt that the valor which he\nhad displayed in encountering his enemies should offset his sin of\ndisobedience. He did not accept with meekness the chastisement\nof God; but his haughty spirit became desperate, until he was on\nthe verge of losing his reason. His counselors advised him to seek\nfor the services of a skillful musician, in the hope that the soothing\nnotes of a sweet instrument might calm his troubled spirit. In the\nprovidence of God, David, as a skillful performer upon the harp,\nwas brought before the king. His lofty and heaven-inspired strains\nhad the desired effect. The brooding melancholy that had settled\nlike a dark cloud over the mind of Saul was charmed away.\nWhen his services were not required at the court of Saul, David\nreturned to his flocks among the hills and continued to maintain his\nsimplicity of spirit and demeanor. Whenever it was necessary, he\nwas recalled to minister before the king, to soothe the mind of the\ntroubled monarch till the evil spirit should depart from him. But\nalthough Saul expressed delight in David and his music, the young\nshepherd went from the king\u2019s house to the fields and hills of his\npasture with a sense of relief and gladness.\nDavid was growing in favor with God and man. He had been\ninstructed in the way of the Lord, and he now set his heart more [644]\n587\n588 Patriarchs and Prophets\nfully to do the will of God than ever before. He had new themes for\nthought. He had been in the court of the king and had seen the re-\nsponsibilities of royalty. He had discovered some of the temptations\nthat beset the soul of Saul and had penetrated some of the mysteries\nin the character and dealings of Israel\u2019s first king. He had seen the\nglory of royalty shadowed with a dark cloud of sorrow, and he knew\nthat the household of Saul, in their private life, were far from happy.\nAll these things served to bring troubled thoughts to him who had\nbeen anointed to be king over Israel. But while he was absorbed\nin deep meditation, and harassed by thoughts of anxiety, he turned\nto his harp, and called forth strains that elevated his mind to the\nAuthor of every good, and the dark clouds that seemed to shadow\nthe horizon of the future were dispelled.\nGod was teaching David lessons of trust. As Moses was trained\nfor his work, so the Lord was fitting the son of Jesse to become the\nguide of His chosen people. In his watchcare for his flocks, he was\ngaining an appreciation of the care that the Great Shepherd has for\nthe sheep of His pasture.\nThe lonely hills and the wild ravines where David wandered with\nhis flocks were the lurking place of beasts of prey. Not infrequently\nthe lion from the thickets by the Jordan, or the bear from his lair\namong the hills, came, fierce with hunger, to attack the flocks. Ac-\ncording to the custom of his time, David was armed only with his\nsling and shepherd\u2019s staff; yet he early gave proof of his strength\nand courage in protecting his charge. Afterward describing these\nencounters, he said: \u201cWhen there came a lion, or a bear, and took\na lamb out of the flock, I went out after him, and smote him, and\ndelivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught\nhim by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.\u201d 1 Samuel 17:34,\n35, R.V . His experience in these matters proved the heart of David\nand developed in him courage and fortitude and faith.\nEven before he was summoned to the court of Saul, David had\ndistinguished himself by deeds of valor. The officer who brought\nhim to the notice of the king declared him to be \u201ca mighty valiant\nman, and a man of war, and prudent in matters,\u201d and he said, \u201cThe\nLord is with him.\u201d\nWhen war was declared by Israel against the Philistines, three of\nthe sons of Jesse joined the army under Saul; but David remained[645]\nDavid and Goliath 589\nat home. After a time, however, he went to visit the camp of Saul.\nBy his father\u2019s direction he was to carry a message and a gift to his\nelder brothers and to learn if they were still in safety and health. But,\nunknown to Jesse, the youthful shepherd had been entrusted with a\nhigher mission. The armies of Israel were in peril, and David had\nbeen directed by an angel to save his people.\nAs David drew near to the army, he heard the sound of com-\nmotion, as if an engagement was about to begin. And \u201cthe host\nwas going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.\u201d Israel and\nthe Philistines were drawn up in array, army against army. David\nran to the army, and came and saluted his brothers. While he was\ntalking with them, Goliath, the champion of the Philistines, came\nforth, and with insulting language defied Israel and challenged them\nto provide a man from their ranks who would meet him in single\ncombat. He repeated his challenge, and when David saw that all\nIsrael were filled with fear, and learned that the Philistine\u2019s defiance\nwas hurled at them day after day, without arousing a champion to\nsilence the boaster, his spirit was stirred within him. He was fired\nwith zeal to preserve the honor of the living God and the credit of\nHis people.\nThe armies of Israel were depressed. Their courage failed. They\nsaid one to another, \u201cHave ye seen this man that is come up? surely\nto defy Israel is he come up.\u201d In shame and indignation, David\nexclaimed, \u201cWho is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should\ndefy the armies of the living God?\u201d\nEliab, David\u2019s eldest brother, when he heard these words, knew\nwell the feelings that were stirring the young man\u2019s soul. Even as a\nshepherd, David had manifested daring, courage, and strength but\nrarely witnessed; and the mysterious visit of Samuel to their father\u2019s\nhouse, and his silent departure, had awakened in the minds of the\nbrothers suspicions of the real object of his visit. Their jealousy had\nbeen aroused as they saw David honored above them, and they did\nnot regard him with the respect and love due to his integrity and\nbrotherly tenderness. They looked upon him as merely a stripling\nshepherd, and now the question which he asked was regarded by\nEliab as a censure upon his own cowardice in making no attempt\nto silence the giant of the Philistines. The elder brother exclaimed\nangrily, \u201cWhy camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou [646]\n590 Patriarchs and Prophets\nleft those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the\nnaughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest\nsee the battle.\u201d David\u2019s answer was respectful but decided: \u201cWhat\nhave I now done? Is there not a cause?\u201d\nThe words of David were repeated to the king, who summoned\nthe youth before him. Saul listened with astonishment to the words\nof the shepherd, as he said, \u201cLet no man\u2019s heart fail because of him;\nthy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.\u201d Saul strove to turn\nDavid from his purpose, but the young man was not to be moved. He\nreplied in a simple, unassuming way, relating his experiences while\nguarding his father\u2019s flocks. And he said, \u201cThe Lord that delivered\nme out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, He\nwill deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto\nDavid, Go, and the Lord be with thee.\u201d\nFor forty days the host of Israel had trembled before the haughty\nchallenge of the Philistine giant. Their hearts failed within them as\nthey looked upon his massive form, in height measuring six cubits\nand a span. Upon his head was a helmet of brass, he was clothed\nwith a coat of mail that weighed five thousand shekels, and he had\ngreaves of brass upon his legs. The coat was made of plates of brass\nthat overlaid one another, like the scales of a fish, and they were\nso closely joined that no dart or arrow could possibly penetrate the\narmor. At his back the giant bore a huge javelin, or lance, also of\nbrass. \u201cThe staff of his spear was like a weaver\u2019s beam; and his\nspear\u2019s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and one bearing a\nshield went before him.\u201d\nMorning and evening Goliath had approached the camp of Israel,\nsaying with a loud voice, \u201cWhy are ye come out to set your battle\nin array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose\nyou a man for you, and let him come down to me. If he be able to\nfight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I\nprevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and\nserve us. And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;\ngive me a man, that we may fight together.\u201d\nThough Saul had given David permission to accept Goliath\u2019s\nchallenge, the king had small hope that David would be successful\nin his courageous undertaking. Command was given to clothe the[647]\nyouth in the king\u2019s own armor. The heavy helmet of brass was put\nDavid and Goliath 591\nupon his head, and the coat of mail was placed upon his body; the\nmonarch\u2019s sword was at his side. Thus equipped, he started upon his\nerrand, but erelong began to retrace his steps. The first thought in\nthe minds of the anxious spectators was that David had decided not\nto risk his life in meeting an antagonist in so unequal an encounter.\nBut this was far from the thought of the brave young man. When he\nreturned to Saul he begged permission to lay aside the heavy armor,\nsaying, \u201cI cannot go with these; for I have not proved them.\u201d He\nlaid off the king\u2019s armor, and in its stead took only his staff in his\nhand, with his shepherd\u2019s scrip and a simple sling. Choosing five\nsmooth stones out of the brook, he put them in his bag, and, with his\nsling in his hand, drew near to the Philistine. The giant strode boldly\nforward, expecting to meet the mightiest of the warriors of Israel.\nHis armor-bearer walked before him, and he looked as if nothing\ncould withstand him. As he came nearer to David he saw but a\nstripling, called a boy because of his youth. David\u2019s countenance\nwas ruddy with health, and his well-knit form, unprotected by armor,\nwas displayed to advantage; yet between its youthful outline and the\nmassive proportions of the Philistine, there was a marked contrast.\nGoliath was filled with amazement and anger. \u201cAm I a dog,\u201d he\nexclaimed, \u201cthat thou comest to me with staves?\u201d Then he poured\nupon David the most terrible curses by all the gods of his knowledge.\nHe cried in derision, \u201cCome to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the\nfowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.\u201d\nDavid did not weaken before the champion of the Philistines.\nStepping forward, he said to his antagonist: \u201cThou comest to me\nwith a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee\nin the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel,\nwhom thou hast defied. This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine\nhand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I\nwill give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the\nfowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth\nmay know that there is a God in Israel. And all this assembly shall\nknow that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is\nthe Lord\u2019s, and He will give you into our hands.\u201d\nThere was a ring of fearlessness in his tone, a look of triumph [648]\nand rejoicing upon his fair countenance. This speech, given in a\nclear, musical voice, rang out on the air, and was distinctly heard by\n592 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe listening thousands marshaled for war. The anger of Goliath was\nroused to the very highest heat. In his rage he pushed up the helmet\nthat protected his forehead and rushed forward to wreak vengeance\nupon his opponent. The son of Jesse was preparing for his foe. \u201cAnd\nit came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh\nto meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet\nthe Philistine. And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a\nstone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in the forehead, that the\nstone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.\u201d\nAmazement spread along the lines of the two armies. They had\nbeen confident that David would be slain; but when the stone went\nwhizzing through the air, straight to the mark, they saw the mighty\nwarrior tremble, and reach forth his hands, as if he were struck\nwith sudden blindness. The giant reeled, and staggered, and like a\nsmitten oak, fell to the ground. David did not wait an instant. He\nsprang upon the prostrate form of the Philistine, and with both hands\nlaid hold of Goliath\u2019s heavy sword. A moment before, the giant\nhad boasted that with it he would sever the youth\u2019s head from his\nshoulders and give his body to the fowls of the air. Now it was lifted\nin the air, and then the head of the boaster rolled from his trunk, and\na shout of exultation went up from the camp of Israel.\nThe Philistines were smitten with terror, and the confusion which\nensued resulted in a precipitate retreat. The shouts of the triumphant\nHebrews echoed along the summits of the mountains, as they rushed\nafter their fleeing enemies; and they \u201cpursued the Philistines, until\nthou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded\nof the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath,\nand unto Ekron. And the children of Israel returned from chasing\nafter the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents. And David took\nthe head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his\narmor in his tent.\u201d\nChapter 64\u2014David a Fugitive [649]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Samuel 18 to 22.\nAfter the slaying of Goliath, Saul kept David with him, and\nwould not permit him to return to his father\u2019s house. And it came\nto pass that \u201cthe soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David,\nand Jonathan loved him as his own soul.\u201d Jonathan and David made\na covenant to be united as brethren, and the king\u2019s son \u201cstripped\nhimself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his\ngarments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.\u201d David\nwas entrusted with important responsibilities, yet he preserved his\nmodesty, and won the affection of the people as well as the royal\nhousehold.\n\u201cDavid went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved him-\nself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war.\u201d David was\nprudent and faithful, and it was evident that the blessing of God was\nwith him. Saul at times realized his own unfitness for the government\nof Israel, and he felt that the kingdom would be more secure if there\ncould be connected with him one who received instruction from the\nLord. Saul hoped also that his connection with David would be a\nsafeguard to himself. Since David was favored and shielded by the\nLord, his presence might be a protection to Saul when he went out\nwith him to war.\nIt was the providence of God that had connected David with Saul.\nDavid\u2019s position at court would give him a knowledge of affairs, in\npreparation for his future greatness. It would enable him to gain\nthe confidence of the nation. The vicissitudes and hardships which\nbefell him, through the enmity of Saul, would lead him to feel his\ndependence upon God, and to put his whole trust in Him. And the\nfriendship of Jonathan for David was also of God\u2019s providence, to\npreserve the life of the future ruler of Israel. In all these things God\nwas working out His gracious purposes, both for David and for the\npeople of Israel.\n593\n594 Patriarchs and Prophets\nSaul, however, did not long remain friendly to David. When[650]\nSaul and David were returning from battle with the Philistines, \u201cthe\nwomen came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet\nKing Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.\u201d\nOne company sang, \u201cSaul hath slain his thousands,\u201d while another\ncompany took up the strain, and responded, \u201cAnd David his ten\nthousands.\u201d The demon of jealousy entered the heart of the king. He\nwas angry because David was exalted above himself in the song of\nthe women of Israel. In place of subduing these envious feelings, he\ndisplayed the weakness of his character, and exclaimed. \u201cThey have\nascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but\nthousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?\u201d\nOne great defect in the character of Saul was his love of appro-\nbation. This trait had had a controlling influence over his actions\nand thoughts; everything was marked by his desire for praise and\nself-exaltation. His standard of right and wrong was the low standard\nof popular applause. No man is safe who lives that he may please\nmen, and does not seek first for the approbation of God. It was the\nambition of Saul to be first in the estimation of men; and when this\nsong of praise was sung, a settled conviction entered the mind of the\nking that David would obtain the hearts of the people and reign in\nhis stead.\nSaul opened his heart to the spirit of jealousy by which his soul\nwas poisoned. Notwithstanding the lessons which he had received\nfrom the prophet Samuel, instructing him that God would accom-\nplish whatsoever He chose, and that no one could hinder it, the king\nmade it evident that he had no true knowledge of the plans or power\nof God. The monarch of Israel was opposing his will to the will of\nthe Infinite One. Saul had not learned, while ruling the kingdom of\nIsrael, that he should rule his own spirit. He allowed his impulses\nto control his judgment, until he was plunged into a fury of passion.\nHe had paroxysms of rage, when he was ready to take the life of\nany who dared oppose his will. From this frenzy he would pass into\na state of despondency and self-contempt, and remorse would take\npossession of his soul.\nHe loved to hear David play upon his harp, and the evil spirit\nseemed to be charmed away for the time; but one day when the\nyouth was ministering before him, and bringing sweet music from\nDavid a Fugitive 595\nhis instrument, accompanying his voice as he sang the praises of [651]\nGod, Saul suddenly threw his spear at the musician, for the purpose\nof putting an end to his life. David was preserved by the interposition\nof God, and without injury fled from the rage of the maddened king.\nAs Saul\u2019s hatred of David increased, he became more and more\nwatchful to find an opportunity to take his life; but none of his plans\nagainst the anointed of the Lord were successful. Saul gave himself\nup to the control of the wicked spirit that ruled over him; while\nDavid trusted in Him who is mighty in counsel, and strong to deliver.\n\u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom\u201d (Proverbs 9:10),\nand David\u2019s prayer was continually directed to God, that he might\nwalk before Him in a perfect way.\nDesiring to be freed from the presence of his rival, the king\n\u201cremoved him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand....\nBut all Israel and Judah loved David.\u201d The people were not slow to\nsee that David was a competent person, and that the affairs entrusted\nto his hands were managed with wisdom and skill. The counsels of\nthe young man were of a wise and discreet character, and proved to\nbe safe to follow; while the judgment of Saul was at times unreliable,\nand his decisions were not wise.\nThough Saul was ever on the alert for an opportunity to destroy\nDavid, he stood in fear of him, since it was evident that the Lord\nwas with him. David\u2019s blameless character aroused the wrath of\nthe king; he deemed that the very life and presence of David cast a\nreproach upon him, since by contrast it presented his own character\nto disadvantage. It was envy that made Saul miserable and put the\nhumble subject of his throne in jeopardy. What untold mischief has\nthis evil trait of character worked in our world! The same enmity\nexisted in the heart of Saul that stirred the heart of Cain against\nhis brother Abel, because Abel\u2019s works were righteous, and God\nhonored him, and his own works were evil, and the Lord could not\nbless him. Envy is the offspring of pride, and if it is entertained\nin the heart, it will lead to hatred, and eventually to revenge and\nmurder. Satan displayed his own character in exciting the fury of\nSaul against him who had never done him harm.\nThe king kept a strict watch upon David, hoping to find some\noccasion of indiscretion or rashness that might serve as an excuse to\nbring him into disgrace. He felt that he could not be satisfied until [652]\n596 Patriarchs and Prophets\nhe could take the young man\u2019s life and still be justified before the\nnation for his evil act. He laid a snare for the feet of David, urging\nhim to conduct the war against the Philistines with still greater vigor,\nand promising, as a reward of his valor, an alliance with the eldest\ndaughter of the royal house. To this proposal David\u2019s modest answer\nwas, \u201cWho am I? and what is my life, or my father\u2019s family in Israel,\nthat I should be son-in-law to the king?\u201d The monarch manifested\nhis insincerity by wedding the princess to another.\nAn attachment for David on the part of Michal, Saul\u2019s youngest\ndaughter, afforded the king another opportunity to plot against his\nrival. Michal\u2019s hand was offered the young man on condition that\nevidence should be given of the defeat and slaughter of a specified\nnumber of their national foes. \u201cSaul thought to make David fall by\nthe hand of the Philistines,\u201d but God shielded His servant. David\nreturned a victor from the battle, to become the king\u2019s son-in-law.\n\u201cMichal Saul\u2019s daughter loved him,\u201d and the monarch, enraged, saw\nthat his plots had resulted in the elevation of him whom he sought\nto destroy. He was still more assured that this was the man whom\nthe Lord had said was better than he, and who should reign on the\nthrone of Israel in his place. Throwing off all disguise, he issued a\ncommand to Jonathan and to the officers of the court to take the life\nof the one he hated.\nJonathan revealed the king\u2019s intention to David and bade him\nconceal himself while he would plead with his father to spare the life\nof the deliverer of Israel. He presented before the king what David\nhad done to preserve the honor and even the life of the nation, and\nwhat terrible guilt would rest upon the murderer of the one whom\nGod had used to scatter their enemies. The conscience of the king\nwas touched, and his heart was softened. \u201cAnd Saul sware, As the\nLord liveth, he shall not be slain.\u201d David was brought to Saul, and\nhe ministered in his presence, as he had done in the past.\nAgain war was declared between the Israelites and the Philistines,\nand David led the army against their enemies. A great victory was\ngained by the Hebrews, and the people of the realm praised his\nwisdom and heroism. This served to stir up the former bitterness of\nSaul against him. While the young man was playing before the king,\nfilling the palace with sweet harmony, Saul\u2019s passion overcame him,[653]\nand he hurled a javelin at David, thinking to pin the musician to\nDavid a Fugitive 597\nthe wall; but the angel of the Lord turned aside the deadly weapon.\nDavid escaped and fled to his own house. Saul sent spies that they\nmight take him as he should come out in the morning, and put an\nend to his life.\nMichal informed David of the purpose of her father. She urged\nhim to flee for his life, and let him down from the window, thus\nenabling him to make his escape. He fled to Samuel at Ramah,\nand the prophet, fearless of the king\u2019s displeasure, welcomed the\nfugitive. The home of Samuel was a peaceful place in contrast with\nthe royal palace. It was here, amid the hills, that the honored servant\nof the Lord continued his work. A company of seers was with him,\nand they studied closely the will of God and listened reverently to\nthe words of instruction that fell from the lips of Samuel. Precious\nwere the lessons that David learned from the teacher of Israel. David\nbelieved that the troops of Saul would not be ordered to invade this\nsacred place, but no place seemed to be sacred to the darkened mind\nof the desperate king. David\u2019s connection with Samuel aroused the\njealousy of the king, lest he who was revered as a prophet of God\nthroughout all Israel should lend his influence to the advancement\nof Saul\u2019s rival. When the king learned where David was, he sent\nofficers to bring him to Gibeah, where he intended to carry out his\nmurderous design.\nThe messengers went on their way, intent upon taking David\u2019s\nlife; but One greater than Saul controlled them. They were met by\nunseen angels, as was Balaam when he was on his way to curse\nIsrael. They began to utter prophetic sayings of what would occur in\nthe future, and proclaimed the glory and majesty of Jehovah. Thus\nGod overruled the wrath of man and manifested His power to restrain\nevil, while He walled in His servant by a guard of angels.\nThe tidings reached Saul as he eagerly waited to have David in\nhis power; but instead of feeling the rebuke of God, he was still more\nexasperated, and sent other messengers. These also were overpow-\nered by the Spirit of God, and united with the first in prophesying.\nThe third embassage was sent by the king; but when they came\ninto the company of the prophets, the divine influence fell upon\nthem also, and they prophesied. Saul then decided that he himself\nwould go, for his fierce enmity had become uncontrollable. He was [654]\ndetermined to wait for no further chance to kill David; as soon as he\n598 Patriarchs and Prophets\nshould come within reach of him, he intended with his own hand to\nslay him, whatever might be the consequences.\nBut an angel of God met him on the way and controlled him. The\nSpirit of God held him in Its power, and he went forward uttering\nprayers to God, interspersed with predictions and sacred melodies.\nHe prophesied of the coming Messiah as the world\u2019s Redeemer.\nWhen he came to the prophet\u2019s home in Ramah, he laid aside the\nouter garments that betokened his rank, and all day and all night he\nlay before Samuel and his pupils, under the influence of the divine\nSpirit. The people were drawn together to witness this strange scene,\nand the experience of the king was reported far and wide. Thus\nagain, near the close of his reign, it became a proverb in Israel that\nSaul also was among the prophets.\nAgain the persecutor was defeated in his purpose. He assured\nDavid that he was at peace with him, but David had little confidence\nin the king\u2019s repentance. He took this opportunity to escape, lest\nthe mood of the king should change, as formerly. His heart was\nwounded within him, and he longed to see his friend Jonathan once\nmore. Conscious of his innocence, he sought the king\u2019s son and\nmade a most touching appeal. \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d he asked, \u201cwhat\nis mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh\nmy life?\u201d Jonathan believed that his father had changed his purpose\nand no longer intended to take the life of David. And Jonathan said\nunto him, \u201cGod forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will\ndo nothing either great or small, but that he will show it me: and\nwhy should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so.\u201d After\nthe remarkable exhibition of the power of God, Jonathan could not\nbelieve that his father would still harm David, since this would be\nmanifest rebellion against God. But David was not convinced. With\nintense earnestness he declared to Jonathan, \u201cAs the Lord liveth, and\nas thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.\u201d\nAt the time of the new moon a sacred festival was celebrated in\nIsrael. This festival recurred upon the day following the interview\nbetween David and Jonathan. At this feast it was expected that both\nthe young men would appear at the king\u2019s table; but David feared to\nbe present, and it was arranged that he should visit his brothers in[655]\nBethlehem. On his return he was to hide himself in a field not far\nfrom the banqueting hall, for three days absenting himself from the\nDavid a Fugitive 599\npresence of the king; and Jonathan would note the effect upon Saul.\nIf inquiry should be made as to the whereabouts of the son of Jesse,\nJonathan was to say that he had gone home to attend the sacrifice\noffered by his father\u2019s household. If no angry demonstrations were\nmade by the king, but he should answer, \u201cIt is well,\u201d then it would\nbe safe for David to return to the court. But if he should become\nenraged at his absence, it would decide the matter of David\u2019s flight.\nOn the first day of the feast the king made no inquiry concerning\nthe absence of David; but when his place was vacant the second\nday, he questioned, \u201cWherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat,\nneither yesterday nor today? And Jonathan answered Saul, David\nearnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem: and he said, Let\nme go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and\nmy brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have\nfound favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my\nbrethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king\u2019s table.\u201d When Saul\nheard these words, his anger was ungovernable. He declared that as\nlong as David lived, Jonathan could not come to the throne of Israel,\nand he demanded that David should be sent for immediately, that\nhe might be put to death. Jonathan again made intercession for his\nfriend, pleading, \u201cWherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?\u201d\nThis appeal to the king only made him more satanic in his fury, and\nthe spear which he had intended for David he now hurled at his own\nson.\nThe prince was grieved and indignant, and leaving the royal\npresence, he was no more a guest at the feast. His soul was bowed\ndown with sorrow as he repaired at the appointed time to the spot\nwhere David was to learn the king\u2019s intentions toward him. Each\nfell upon the other\u2019s neck, and they wept bitterly. The dark passion\nof the king cast its shadow upon the life of the young men, and their\ngrief was too intense for expression. Jonathan\u2019s last words fell upon\nthe ear of David as they separated to pursue their different paths,\n\u201cGo in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name\nof the Lord, saying, The Lord be between me and thee, and between\nmy seed and thy seed forever.\u201d\nThe king\u2019s son returned to Gibeah, and David hastened to reach [656]\nNob, a city but a few miles distant, and also belonging to the tribe\nof Benjamin. The tabernacle had been taken to this place from\n600 Patriarchs and Prophets\nShiloh, and here Ahimelech the high priest ministered. David knew\nnot whither to flee for refuge, except to the servant of God. The\npriest looked upon him with astonishment, as he came in haste\nand apparently alone, with a countenance marked by anxiety and\nsorrow. He inquired what had brought him there. The young man\nwas in constant fear of discovery, and in his extremity he resorted to\ndeception. David told the priest that he had been sent by the king on\na secret errand, one which required the utmost expedition. Here he\nmanifested a want of faith in God, and his sin resulted in causing the\ndeath of the high priest. Had the facts been plainly stated, Ahimelech\nwould have known what course to pursue to preserve his life. God\nrequires that truthfulness shall mark His people, even in the greatest\nperil. David asked the priest for five loaves of bread. There was\nnothing but hallowed bread in the possession of the man of God, but\nDavid succeeded in removing his scruples, and obtained the bread\nto satisfy his hunger.\nA new danger now presented itself. Doeg, the chief of Saul\u2019s\nherdsmen, who had professed the faith of the Hebrews, was now\npaying his vows in the place of worship. At sight of this man David\ndetermined to make haste to secure another place of refuge, and to\nobtain some weapon with which to defend himself if defense should\nbecome necessary. He asked Ahimelech for a sword, and was told\nthat he had none except the sword of Goliath, which had been kept\nas a relic in the tabernacle. David replied, \u201cThere is none like that;\ngive it me.\u201d His courage revived as he grasped the sword that he had\nonce used in destroying the champion of the Philistines.\nDavid fled to Achish, the king of Gath; for he felt that there was\nmore safety in the midst of the enemies of his people than in the\ndominions of Saul. But it was reported to Achish that David was the\nman who had slain the Philistine champion years before; and now\nhe who had sought refuge with the foes of Israel found himself in\ngreat peril. But, feigning madness, he deceived his enemies and thus\nmade his escape.\nThe first error of David was his distrust of God at Nob, and\nhis second mistake was his deception before Achish. David had\ndisplayed noble traits of character, and his moral worth had won\nhim favor with the people; but as trial came upon him, his faith was[657]\nshaken, and human weakness appeared. He saw in every man a\nDavid a Fugitive 601\nspy and a betrayer. In a great emergency David had looked up to\nGod with a steady eye of faith, and had vanquished the Philistine\ngiant. He believed in God, he went in His name. But as he had been\nhunted and persecuted, perplexity and distress had nearly hidden his\nheavenly Father from his sight.\nYet this experience was serving to teach David wisdom; for it led\nhim to realize his weakness and the necessity of constant dependence\nupon God. Oh, how precious is the sweet influence of the Spirit\nof God as it comes to depressed or despairing souls, encouraging\nthe fainthearted, strengthening the feeble, and imparting courage\nand help to the tried servants of the Lord! Oh, what a God is ours,\nwho deals gently with the erring and manifests His patience and\ntenderness in adversity, and when we are overwhelmed with some\ngreat sorrow!\nEvery failure on the part of the children of God is due to their lack\nof faith. When shadows encompass the soul, when we want light\nand guidance, we must look up; there is light beyond the darkness.\nDavid ought not to have distrusted God for one moment. He had\ncause for trusting in Him: he was the Lord\u2019s anointed, and in the\nmidst of danger he had been protected by the angels of God; he\nhad been armed with courage to do wonderful things; and if he had\nbut removed his mind from the distressing situation in which he\nwas placed, and had thought of God\u2019s power and majesty, he would\nhave been at peace even in the midst of the shadows of death; he\ncould with confidence have repeated the promise of the Lord, \u201cThe\nmountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but My kindness\nshall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of My peace\nbe removed.\u201d Isaiah 54:10.\nAmong the mountains of Judah, David sought refuge from the\npursuit of Saul. He made good his escape to the cave of Adullam,\na place that, with a small force, could be held against a large army.\n\u201cAnd when his brethren and all his father\u2019s house heard it, they\nwent down thither to him.\u201d The family of David could not feel\nsecure, knowing that at any time the unreasonable suspicions of Saul\nmight be directed against them on account of their relation to David.\nThey had now learned\u2014what was coming to be generally known in\nIsrael\u2014that God had chosen David as the future ruler of His people; [658]\nand they believed that they would be safer with him, even though he\n602 Patriarchs and Prophets\nwas a fugitive in a lonely cave, than they could be while exposed to\nthe insane madness of a jealous king.\nIn the cave of Adullam the family were united in sympathy and\naffection. The son of Jesse could make melody with voice and harp\nas he sang, \u201cBehold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to\ndwell together in unity!\u201d Psalm 133:1. He had tasted the bitterness\nof distrust on the part of his own brothers; and the harmony that had\ntaken the place of discord brought joy to the exile\u2019s heart. It was\nhere that David composed the fifty-seventh psalm.\nIt was not long before David\u2019s company was joined by others\nwho desired to escape the exactions of the king. There were many\nwho had lost confidence in the ruler of Israel, for they could see that\nhe was no longer guided by the Spirit of the Lord. \u201cAnd everyone\nthat was in distress, and everyone that was in debt, and everyone\nthat was discontented,\u201d resorted to David, \u201cand he became a captain\nover them: and there were with him about four hundred men.\u201d Here\nDavid had a little kingdom of his own, and in it order and discipline\nprevailed. But even in his retreat in the mountains he was far from\nfeeling secure, for he received continual evidence that the king had\nnot relinquished his murderous purpose.\nHe found a refuge for his parents with the king of Moab, and\nthen, at a warning of danger from a prophet of the Lord, he fled from\nhis hiding place to the forest of Hareth. The experience through\nwhich David was passing was not unnecessary or fruitless. God was\ngiving him a course of discipline to fit him to become a wise general\nas well as a just and merciful king. With his band of fugitives he\nwas gaining a preparation to take up the work that Saul, because of\nhis murderous passion and blind indiscretion, was becoming wholly\nunfitted to do. Men cannot depart from the counsel of God and still\nretain that calmness and wisdom which will enable them to act with\njustice and discretion. There is no insanity so dreadful, so hopeless,\nas that of following human wisdom, unguided by the wisdom of\nGod.\nSaul had been preparing to ensnare and capture David in the\ncave of Adullam, and when it was discovered that David had left this\nplace of refuge, the king was greatly enraged. The flight of David[659]\nwas a mystery to Saul. He could account for it only by the belief\nDavid a Fugitive 603\nthat there had been traitors in his camp, who had informed the son\nof Jesse of his proximity and design.\nHe affirmed to his counselors that a conspiracy had been formed\nagainst him, and with the offer of rich gifts and positions of honor\nhe bribed them to reveal who among his people had befriended\nDavid. Doeg the Edomite turned informer. Moved by ambition\nand avarice, and by hatred of the priest, who had reproved his sins,\nDoeg reported David\u2019s visit to Ahimelech, representing the matter\nin such a light as to kindle Saul\u2019s anger against the man of God. The\nwords of that mischievous tongue, set on fire of hell, stirred up the\nworst passions in Saul\u2019s heart. Maddened with rage, he declared\nthat the whole family of the priest should perish. And the terrible\ndecree was executed. Not only Ahimelech, but the members of his\nfather\u2019s house\u2014\u201cfour-score and five persons that did wear a linen\nephod\u201d\u2014were slain at the king\u2019s command, by the murderous hand\nof Doeg.\n\u201cAnd Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the\nsword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and\nasses, and sheep.\u201d This is what Saul could do under the control of\nSatan. When God had said that the iniquity of the Amalekites was\nfull, and had commanded him to destroy them utterly, he thought\nhimself too compassionate to execute the divine sentence, and he\nspared that which was devoted to destruction; but now, without a\ncommand from God, under the guidance of Satan, he could slay the\npriests of the Lord and bring ruin upon the inhabitants of Nob. Such\nis the perversity of the human heart that has refused the guidance of\nGod.\nThis deed filled all Israel with horror. It was the king whom they\nhad chosen that had committed this outrage, and he had only done\nafter the manner of the kings of other nations that feared not God.\nThe ark was with them, but the priests of whom they had inquired\nwere slain with the sword. What would come next?\nChapter 65\u2014The Magnanimity of David[660]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Samuel 22:20- 23; 23-27.\nAfter Saul\u2019s atrocious slaughter of the priests of the Lord, \u201cone of\nthe sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped,\nand fled after David. And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain\nthe Lord\u2019s priests. And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day,\nwhen Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I\nhave occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father\u2019s house.\nAbide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy\nlife: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.\u201d\nStill hunted by the king, David found no place of rest or secu-\nrity. At Keilah his brave band saved the town from capture by the\nPhilistines, but they were not safe, even among the people whom\nthey had delivered. From Keilah they repaired to the wilderness of\nZiph.\nAt this time, when there were so few bright spots in the path of\nDavid, he was rejoiced to receive an unexpected visit from Jonathan,\nwho had learned the place of his refuge. Precious were the moments\nwhich these two friends passed in each other\u2019s society. They related\ntheir varied experiences, and Jonathan strengthened the heart of\nDavid, saying, \u201cFear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not\nfind thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next\nunto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.\u201d As they talked\nof the wonderful dealings of God with David, the hunted fugitive\nwas greatly encouraged. \u201cAnd they two made a covenant before\nthe Lord: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his\nhouse.\u201d\nAfter the visit of Jonathan, David encouraged his soul with songs\nof praise, accompanying his voice with his harp as he sang:\n\u201cIn the Lord put I my trust: [661]\nHow say ye to my soul,\n604\nMagnanimity of David 605\nFlee as a bird to your mountain?\nFor, lo, the wicked bend their bow,\nThey make ready their arrow upon the string,\nThat they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.\nIf the foundations be destroyed,\nWhat can the righteous do?\nThe Lord is in His holy temple,\nThe Lord\u2019s throne is in heaven:\nHis eyes behold, His eyelids try, the children of men.\nThe Lord trieth the righteous:\nBut the wicked and him that loveth violence His soul\nhateth.\u201d Psalm 11:1-5.\nThe Ziphites, into whose wild regions David went from Keilah,\nsent word to Saul in Gibeah that they knew where David was hid-\ning, and that they would guide the king to his retreat. But David,\nwarned of their intentions, changed his position, seeking refuge in\nthe mountains between Maon and the Dead Sea.\nAgain word was sent to Saul, \u201cBehold, David is in the wilderness\nof Engedi. Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all\nIsrael, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the\nwild goats.\u201d David had only six hundred men in his company, while\nSaul advanced against him with an army of three thousand. In a\nsecluded cave the son of Jesse and his men waited for the guidance\nof God as to what should be done. As Saul was pressing his way up\nthe mountains, he turned aside, and entered, alone, the very cavern in\nwhich David and his band were hidden. When David\u2019s men saw this\nthey urged their leader to kill Saul. The fact that the king was now\nin their power was interpreted by them as certain evidence that God\nHimself had delivered the enemy into their hand, that they might\ndestroy him. David was tempted to take this view of the matter;\nbut the voice of conscience spoke to him, saying, \u201cTouch not the\nanointed of the Lord.\u201d\nDavid\u2019s men were still unwilling to leave Saul in peace, and\nthey reminded their commander of the words of God, \u201cBehold, I\nwill deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him\nas it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the\n606 Patriarchs and Prophets\nskirt of Saul\u2019s robe privily.\u201d But his conscience smote him afterward,\nbecause he had even marred the garment of the king.\nSaul rose up and went out of the cave to continue his search,[662]\nwhen a voice fell upon his startled ears, saying, \u201cMy lord the king.\u201d\nHe turned to see who was addressing him, and lo! it was the son of\nJesse, the man whom he had so long desired to have in his power that\nhe might kill him. David bowed himself to the king, acknowledging\nhim as his master. Then he addressed Saul in these words: \u201cWhere-\nfore hearest thou men\u2019s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy\nhurt? Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the Lord hath\ndelivered thee today into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me\nkill thee; but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth\nmine hand against my lord; for he is the Lord\u2019s anointed. Moreover,\nmy father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I\ncut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see\nthat there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have\nnot sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.\u201d\nWhen Saul heard the words of David he was humbled, and could\nnot but admit their truthfulness. His feelings were deeply moved\nas he realized how completely he had been in the power of the\nman whose life he sought. David stood before him in conscious\ninnocence. With a softened spirit, Saul exclaimed, \u201cIs this thy voice,\nmy son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.\u201d Then he\ndeclared to David: \u201cThou art more righteous than I: for thou hast\nrewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.... For if a\nman find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the\nLord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day. And\nnow, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the\nkingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.\u201d And David\nmade a covenant with Saul that when this should take place he would\nfavorably regard the house of Saul, and not cut off his name.\nKnowing what he did of Saul\u2019s past course, David could put no\nconfidence in the assurances of the king, nor hope that his penitent\ncondition would long continue. So when Saul returned to his home\nDavid remained in the strongholds of the mountains.\nThe enmity that is cherished toward the servants of God by those\nwho have yielded to the power of Satan changes at times to a feeling\nof reconciliation and favor, but the change does not always prove\nMagnanimity of David 607\nto be lasting. After evil-minded men have engaged in doing and\nsaying wicked things against the Lord\u2019s servants, the conviction that [663]\nthey have been in the wrong sometimes takes deep hold upon their\nminds. The Spirit of the Lord strives with them, and they humble\ntheir hearts before God, and before those whose influence they have\nsought to destroy, and they may change their course toward them.\nBut as they again open the door to the suggestions of the evil one,\nthe old doubts are revived, the old enmity is awakened, and they\nreturn to engage in the same work which they repented of, and for a\ntime abandoned. Again they speak evil, accusing and condemning in\nthe bitterest manner the very ones to whom they made most humble\nconfession. Satan can use such souls with far greater power after\nsuch a course has been pursued than he could before, because they\nhave sinned against greater light.\n\u201cAnd Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together,\nand lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.\u201d The death\nof Samuel was regarded as an irreparable loss by the nation of Israel.\nA great and good prophet and an eminent judge had fallen in death,\nand the grief of the people was deep and heartfelt. From his youth\nup Samuel had walked before Israel in the integrity of his heart;\nalthough Saul had been the acknowledged king, Samuel had wielded\na more powerful influence than he, because his record was one of\nfaithfulness, obedience, and devotion. We read that he judged Israel\nall the days of his life.\nAs the people contrasted the course of Saul with that of Samuel,\nthey saw what a mistake they had made in desiring a king that they\nmight not be different from the nations around them. Many looked\nwith alarm at the condition of society, fast becoming leavened with\nirreligion and godlessness. The example of their ruler was exerting\na widespread influence, and well might Israel mourn that Samuel,\nthe prophet of the Lord, was dead.\nThe nation had lost the founder and president of its sacred\nschools, but that was not all. It had lost him to whom the people had\nbeen accustomed to go with their great troubles\u2014lost one who had\nconstantly interceded with God in behalf of the best interests of its\npeople. The intercession of Samuel had given a feeling of security;\nfor \u201cthe effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.\u201d\nJames 5:16. The people felt now that God was forsaking them. The\n608 Patriarchs and Prophets\nking seemed little less than a madman. Justice was perverted, and\norder was turned to confusion.\nIt was when the nation was racked with internal strife, when the[664]\ncalm, God-fearing counsel of Samuel seemed to be most needed,\nthat God gave His aged servant rest. Bitter were the reflections of the\npeople as they looked upon his quiet resting place, and remembered\ntheir folly in rejecting him as their ruler; for he had had so close\na connection with Heaven that he seemed to bind all Israel to the\nthrone of Jehovah. It was Samuel who had taught them to love and\nobey God; but now that he was dead, the people felt that they were\nleft to the mercies of a king who was joined to Satan, and who would\ndivorce the people from God and heaven.\nDavid could not be present at the burial of Samuel, but he\nmourned for him as deeply and tenderly as a faithful son could\nmourn for a devoted father. He knew that Samuel\u2019s death had broken\nanother bond of restraint from the actions of Saul, and he felt less\nsecure than when the prophet lived. While the attention of Saul\nwas engaged in mourning for the death of Samuel, David took the\nopportunity to seek a place of greater security; so he fled to the\nwilderness of Paran. It was here that he composed the one hundred\nand twentieth and twenty-first psalms. In these desolate wilds, re-\nalizing that the prophet was dead, and the king was his enemy, he\nsang:\n\u201cMy help cometh from the Lord,\nWhich made heaven and earth.\nHe will not suffer thy foot to be moved:\nHe that keepeth thee will not slumber.\nBehold, He that keepeth Israel\nShall neither slumber nor sleep....\nThe Lord shall preserve thee from all evil:\nHe shall preserve thy soul.\nThe Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy\ncoming in\nFrom this time forth, and even forevermore.\u201d\nPsalm 121:2-8.\nMagnanimity of David 609\nWhile David and his men were in the wilderness of Paran, they\nprotected from the depredations of marauders the flocks and herds\nof a wealthy man named Nabal, who had vast possessions in that\nregion. Nabal was a descendant of Caleb, but his character was\nchurlish and niggardly.\nIt was the time of sheepshearing, a season of hospitality. David\nand his men were in sore need of provisions; and in accordance\nwith the custom of the times, the son of Jesse sent ten young men [665]\nto Nabal, bidding them greet him in their master\u2019s name; and he\nadded: \u201cThus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace\nbe both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all\nthat thou hast. And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now\nthy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was\nthere aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.\n[Not Mount Carmel, but a place in the territory of Judah, near the\nhill town of Maon.] Ask thy young men, and they will show thee.\nWherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes; for we come\nin a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand\nunto thy servants, and to thy son David.\u201d\nDavid and his men had been like a wall of protection to the\nshepherds and flocks of Nabal; and now this rich man was asked to\nfurnish from his abundance some relief to the necessities of those\nwho had done him such valuable service. David and his men might\nhave helped themselves from the flocks and herds, but they did\nnot. They behaved themselves in an honest way. Their kindness,\nhowever, was lost upon Nabal. The answer he returned to David was\nindicative of his character: \u201cWho is David? and who is the son of\nJesse? There be many servants nowadays that break away every man\nfrom his master. Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my\nflesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom\nI know not whence they be?\u201d\nWhen the young men returned empty-handed and related the\naffair to David, he was filled with indignation. He commanded his\nmen to equip themselves for an encounter; for he had determined\nto punish the man who had denied him what was his right, and\nhad added insult to injury. This impulsive movement was more in\nharmony with the character of Saul than with that of David, but the\nson of Jesse had yet to learn of patience in the school of affliction.\n610 Patriarchs and Prophets\nOne of Nabal\u2019s servants hastened to Abigail, the wife of Nabal,\nafter he had dismissed David\u2019s young men, and told her what had\nhappened. \u201cBehold,\u201d he said, \u201cDavid sent messengers out of the\nwilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them. But the men\nwere very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we\nanything, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were\nin the fields. They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the[666]\nwhile we were with them keeping the sheep. Now therefore know\nand consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our\nmaster, and against all his household.\u201d\nWithout consulting her husband or telling him of her intention,\nAbigail made up an ample supply of provisions, which, laded upon\nasses, she sent forward in the charge of servants, and herself started\nout to meet the band of David. She met them in a covert of a\nhill. \u201cAnd when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the\nass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the\nground, and fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me\nlet this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in\nthine audience.\u201d Abigail addressed David with as much reverence\nas though speaking to a crowned monarch. Nabal had scornfully\nexclaimed, \u201cWho is David?\u201d but Abigail called him, \u201cmy lord.\u201d\nWith kind words she sought to soothe his irritated feelings, and\nshe pleaded with him in behalf of her husband. With nothing of\nostentation or pride, but full of the wisdom and love of God, Abigail\nrevealed the strength of her devotion to her household; and she made\nit plain to David that the unkind course of her husband was in no\nwise premeditated against him as a personal affront, but was simply\nthe outburst of an unhappy and selfish nature.\n\u201cNow therefore, my lord, as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul\nliveth, seeing the Lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed\nblood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine\nenemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.\u201d Abigail\ndid not take to herself the credit of this reasoning to turn David from\nhis hasty purpose, but gave to God the honor and the praise. She\nthen offered her rich provision as a peace offering to the men of\nDavid, and still pleaded as if she herself were the one who had so\nexcited the resentment of the chief.\nMagnanimity of David 611\n\u201cI pray thee,\u201d she said, \u201cforgive the trespass of thine handmaid:\nfor the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my\nlord fighteth the battles of the Lord, and evil hath not been found in\nthee all thy days.\u201d Abigail presented by implication the course that\nDavid ought to pursue. He should fight the battles of the Lord. He\nwas not to seek revenge for personal wrongs, even though persecuted\nas a traitor. She continued: \u201cThough man be risen up to pursue thee,\nand to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the [667]\nbundle of life with the Lord thy God.... And it shall come to pass,\nwhen the Lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good\nthat He hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee\nprince over Israel; that this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offense\nof heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or\nthat my lord hath avenged himself: and when the Lord shall have\ndealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.\u201d 1 Samuel",

      "text": "These words could have come only from the lips of one who\nhad partaken of the wisdom from above. The piety of Abigail, like\nthe fragrance of a flower, breathed out all unconsciously in face\nand word and action. The Spirit of the Son of God was abiding\nin her soul. Her speech, seasoned with grace, and full of kindness\nand peace, shed a heavenly influence. Better impulses came to\nDavid, and he trembled as he thought what might have been the\nconsequences of his rash purpose. \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers:\nfor they shall be called the children of God.\u201d Matthew 5:9. Would\nthat there were many more like this woman of Israel, who would\nsoothe the irritated feelings, prevent rash impulses, and quell great\nevils by words of calm and well-directed wisdom.\nA consecrated Christian life is ever shedding light and comfort\nand peace. It is characterized by purity, tact, simplicity, and use-\nfulness. It is controlled by that unselfish love that sanctifies the\ninfluence. It is full of Christ, and leaves a track of light wherever\nits possessor may go. Abigail was a wise reprover and counselor.\nDavid\u2019s passion died away under the power of her influence and\nreasoning. He was convinced that he had taken an unwise course\nand had lost control of his own spirit.\nWith a humble heart he received the rebuke, in harmony with\nhis own words, \u201cLet the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness:\n612 Patriarchs and Prophets\nand let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil.\u201d Psalm 141:5.\nHe gave thanks and blessings because she advised him righteously.\nThere are many who, when they are reproved, think it praiseworthy\nif they receive the rebuke without becoming impatient; but how few\ntake reproof with gratitude of heart and bless those who seek to save\nthem from pursuing an evil course.\nWhen Abigail returned home she found Nabal and his guests in\nthe enjoyment of a great feast, which they had converted into a scene[668]\nof drunken revelry. Not until the next morning did she relate to her\nhusband what had occurred in her interview with David. Nabal was a\ncoward at heart; and when he realized how near his folly had brought\nhim to a sudden death, he seemed smitten with paralysis. Fearful\nthat David would still pursue his purpose of revenge, he was filled\nwith horror, and sank down in a condition of helpless insensibility.\nAfter ten days he died. The life that God had given him had been\nonly a curse to the world. In the midst of his rejoicing and making\nmerry, God had said to him, as He said to the rich man of the parable,\n\u201cThis night thy soul shall be required of thee.\u201d Luke 12:20.\nDavid afterward married Abigail. He was already the husband\nof one wife, but the custom of the nations of his time had perverted\nhis judgment and influenced his actions. Even great and good men\nhave erred in following the practices of the world. The bitter result\nof marrying many wives was sorely felt throughout all the life of\nDavid.\nAfter the death of Samuel, David was left in peace for a few\nmonths. Again he repaired to the solitude of the Ziphites; but these\nenemies, hoping to secure the favor of the king, informed him of\nDavid\u2019s hiding place. This intelligence aroused the demon of passion\nthat had been slumbering in Saul\u2019s breast. Once more he summoned\nhis men of arms and led them out in pursuit of David. But friendly\nspies brought tidings to the son of Jesse that Saul was again pursuing\nhim; and with a few of his men, David started out to learn the location\nof his enemy. It was night when, cautiously advancing, they came\nupon the encampment, and saw before them the tents of the king\nand his attendants. They were unobserved, for the camp was quiet\nin slumber. David called upon his friends to go with him into the\nvery midst of the foe. In answer to his question, \u201cWho will go down\nMagnanimity of David 613\nwith me to Saul to the camp?\u201d Abishai promptly responded, \u201cI will\ngo down with thee.\u201d\nHidden by the deep shadows of the hills, David and his attendant\nentered the encampment of the enemy. As they sought to ascertain\nthe exact number of their foes, they came upon Saul sleeping, his\nspear stuck in the ground, and a cruse of water at his head. Beside\nhim lay Abner, his chief commander, and all around them were the\nsoldiers, locked in slumber. Abishai raised his spear, and said to\nDavid, \u201cGod hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day:\nnow therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even [669]\n[670]\n[671]\nto the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.\u201d He\nwaited for the word of permission; but there fell upon his ear the\nwhispered words: \u201cDestroy him not: for who can stretch forth his\nhand against the Lord\u2019s anointed, and be guiltless? ... As the Lord\nliveth, the Lord shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he\nshall descend into battle, and perish. The Lord forbid that I should\nstretch forth mine hand against the Lord\u2019s anointed: but, I pray thee,\ntake thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water,\nand let us go. So David took the spear and the cruse of water from\nSaul\u2019s bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor\nknew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep\nsleep from the Lord was fallen upon them.\u201d How easily the Lord can\nweaken the strongest, remove prudence from the wisest, and baffle\nthe skill of the most watchful!\nWhen David was at a safe distance from the camp he stood on\nthe top of a hill and cried with a loud voice to the people and to\nAbner, saying, \u201cArt not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in\nIsrael? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there\ncame one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord. This thing is\nnot good that thou hast done. As the Lord liveth, ye are worthy to\ndie, because ye have not kept your master the Lord\u2019s anointed. And\nnow see where the king\u2019s spear is, and the cruse of water that was at\nhis bolster. And Saul knew David\u2019s voice, and said, Is this thy voice,\nmy son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.\nAnd he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant?\nfor what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand? Now therefore, I\npray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant.\u201d Again\nthe acknowledgment fell from the lips of the king, \u201cI have sinned:\n614 Patriarchs and Prophets\nreturn, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my\nsoul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the\nfool, and have erred exceedingly. And David answered and said,\nBehold the king\u2019s spear! and let one of the young men come over\nand fetch it.\u201d Although Saul had made the promise, \u201cI will no more\ndo thee harm,\u201d David did not place himself in his power.\nThe second instance of David\u2019s respect for his sovereign\u2019s life\nmade a still deeper impression upon the mind of Saul and brought\nfrom him a more humble acknowledgment of his fault. He was[672]\nastonished and subdued at the manifestation of such kindness. In\nparting from David, Saul exclaimed, \u201cBlessed be thou, my son\nDavid: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail.\u201d\nBut the son of Jesse had no hope that the king would long continue\nin this frame of mind.\nDavid despaired of a reconciliation with Saul. It seemed in-\nevitable that he should at last fall a victim to the malice of the king,\nand he determined again to seek refuge in the land of the Philistines.\nWith the six hundred men under his command, he passed over to\nAchish, the king of Gath.\nDavid\u2019s conclusion that Saul would certainly accomplish his\nmurderous purpose was formed without the counsel of God. Even\nwhile Saul was plotting and seeking to accomplish his destruction,\nthe Lord was working to secure David the kingdom. God works out\nHis plans, though to human eyes they are veiled in mystery. Men\ncannot understand the ways of God; and, looking at appearances,\nthey interpret the trials and tests and provings that God permits to\ncome upon them as things that are against them, and that will only\nwork their ruin. Thus David looked on appearances, and not at the\npromises of God. He doubted that he would ever come to the throne.\nLong trials had wearied his faith and exhausted his patience.\nThe Lord did not send David for protection to the Philistines,\nthe most bitter foes of Israel. This very nation would be among his\nworst enemies to the last, and yet he had fled to them for help in his\ntime of need. Having lost all confidence in Saul and in those who\nserved him, he threw himself upon the mercies of the enemies of his\npeople. David was a brave general, and had proved himself a wise\nand successful warrior; but he was working directly against his own\ninterests when he went to the Philistines. God had appointed him\nMagnanimity of David 615\nto set up his standard in the land of Judah, and it was want of faith\nthat led him to forsake his post of duty without a command from the\nLord.\nGod was dishonored by David\u2019s unbelief. The Philistines had\nfeared David more than they had feared Saul and his armies; and by\nplacing himself under the protection of the Philistines, David discov-\nered to them the weakness of his own people. Thus he encouraged\nthese relentless foes to oppress Israel. David had been anointed to\nstand in defense of the people of God; and the Lord would not have\nHis servants give encouragement to the wicked by disclosing the [673]\nweakness of His people or by an appearance of indifference to their\nwelfare. Furthermore, the impression was received by his brethren\nthat he had gone to the heathen to serve their gods. By this act he\ngave occasion for misconstruing his motives, and many were led\nto hold prejudice against him. The very thing that Satan desired\nto have him do he was led to do; for, in seeking refuge among the\nPhilistines, David caused great exultation to the enemies of God and\nHis people. David did not renounce his worship of God nor cease\nhis devotion to His cause; but he sacrificed his trust in Him to his\npersonal safety, and thus tarnished the upright and faithful character\nthat God requires His servants to possess.\nDavid was cordially received by the king of the Philistines. The\nwarmth of this reception was partly due to the fact that the king\nadmired him and partly to the fact that it was flattering to his vanity\nto have a Hebrew seek his protection. David felt secure from betrayal\nin the dominions of Achish. He brought his family, his household,\nand his possessions, as did also his men; and to all appearance he\nhad come to settle permanently in the land of Philistia. All this was\ngratifying to Achish, who promised to protect the fugitive Israelites.\nAt David\u2019s request for a residence in the country, removed from\nthe royal city, the king graciously granted Ziklag as a possession.\nDavid realized that it would be dangerous for himself and his men\nto be under the influence of idolaters. In a town wholly separated\nfor their use they might worship God with more freedom than they\ncould if they remained in Gath, where the heathen rites could not\nbut prove a source of evil and annoyance.\nWhile dwelling in this isolated town David made war upon the\nGeshurites, the Gezrites, and the Amalekites, and he left none alive\n616 Patriarchs and Prophets\nto bring tidings to Gath. When he returned from battle he gave\nAchish to understand that he had been warring against those of his\nown nation, the men of Judah. By this dissembling he was the means\nof strengthening the hand of the Philistines; for the king said, \u201cHe\nhath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall\nbe my servant forever.\u201d David knew that it was the will of God that\nthose heathen tribes should be destroyed, and he knew that he was\nappointed to do this work; but he was not walking in the counsel of\nGod when he practiced deception.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered[674]\ntheir armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish\nsaid unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with\nme to battle, thou and thy men.\u201d David had no intention of lifting\nhis hand against his people; but he was not certain as to what course\nhe would pursue, until circumstances should indicate his duty. He\nanswered the king evasively, and said, \u201cSurely thou shalt know what\nthy servant can do.\u201d Achish understood these words as a promise of\nassistance in the approaching war, and pledged his word to bestow\nupon David great honor, and give him a high position at the Philistine\ncourt.\nBut although David\u2019s faith had staggered somewhat at the\npromises of God, he still remembered that Samuel had anointed\nhim king of Israel. He recalled the victories that God had given him\nover his enemies in the past. He reviewed the great mercy of God in\npreserving him from the hand of Saul, and determined not to betray\na sacred trust. Even though the king of Israel had sought his life, he\nwould not join his forces with the enemies of his people.\nChapter 66\u2014The Death of Saul [675]\nAgain war was declared between Israel and the Philistines. \u201cThe\nPhilistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in\nShunem,\u201d on the northern edge of the plain of Jezreel; while Saul and\nhis forces encamped but a few miles distant, at the foot of Mount\nGilboa, on the southern border of the plain. It was on this plain\nthat Gideon, with three hundred men, had put to flight the hosts of\nMidian. But the spirit that inspired Israel\u2019s deliverer was widely\ndifferent from that which now stirred the heart of the king. Gideon\nwent forth strong in faith in the mighty God of Jacob; but Saul felt\nhimself to be alone and defenseless, because God had forsaken him.\nAs he looked abroad upon the Philistine host, \u201che was afraid, and\nhis heart greatly trembled.\u201d\nSaul had learned that David and his force were with the\nPhilistines, and he expected that the son of Jesse would take this\nopportunity to revenge the wrongs he had suffered. The king was\nin sore distress. It was his own unreasoning passion, spurring him\non to destroy the chosen of God, that had involved the nation in\nso great peril. While he had been engrossed in pursuing David he\nhad neglected the defense of his kingdom. The Philistines, taking\nadvantage of its unguarded condition, had penetrated into the very\nheart of the country. Thus while Satan had been urging Saul to\nemploy every energy in hunting David, that he might destroy him,\nthe same malignant spirit had inspired the Philistines to seize their\nopportunity to work Saul\u2019s ruin and overthrow the people of God.\nHow often is the same policy still employed by the archenemy! He\nmoves upon some unconsecrated heart to kindle envy and strife in\nthe church, and then, taking advantage of the divided condition of\nGod\u2019s people, he stirs up his agents to work their ruin.\nOn the morrow Saul must engage the Philistines in battle. The\nshadows of impending doom gathered dark about him; he longed [676]\nfor help and guidance. But it was in vain that he sought counsel\nfrom God. \u201cThe Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor\n617\n618 Patriarchs and Prophets\nby Urim, nor by prophets.\u201d The Lord never turned away a soul that\ncame to Him in sincerity and humility. Why did he turn Saul away\nunanswered? The king had by his own act forfeited the benefits of\nall the methods of inquiring of God. He had rejected the counsel of\nSamuel the prophet; he had exiled David, the chosen of God; he had\nslain the priests of the Lord. Could he expect to be answered by God\nwhen he had cut off the channels of communication that Heaven had\nordained? He had sinned away the Spirit of grace, and could he be\nanswered by dreams and revelations from the Lord? Saul did not\nturn to God with humility and repentance. It was not pardon for sin\nand reconciliation with God, that he sought, but deliverance from\nhis foes. By his own stubbornness and rebellion he had cut himself\noff from God. There could be no return but by the way of penitence\nand contrition; but the proud monarch, in his anguish and despair,\ndetermined to seek help from another source.\n\u201cThen said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath\na familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her.\u201d Saul\nhad a full knowledge of the character of necromancy. It had been\nexpressly forbidden by the Lord, and the sentence of death was\npronounced against all who practiced its unholy arts. During the life\nof Samuel, Saul had commanded that all wizards and those that had\nfamiliar spirits should be put to death; but now, in the rashness of\ndesperation, he had recourse to that oracle which he had condemned\nas an abomination.\nIt was told the king that a woman who had a familiar spirit\nwas living in concealment at Endor. This woman had entered into\ncovenant with Satan to yield herself to his control, to fulfill his\npurposes; and in return, the prince of evil wrought wonders for her\nand revealed secret things to her.\nDisguising himself, Saul went forth by night with but two atten-\ndants, to seek the retreat of the sorceress. Oh, pitiable sight! the\nking of Israel led captive by Satan at his will! What path so dark\nfor human feet to tread as that chosen by one who has persisted in\nhaving his own way, resisting the holy influences of the Spirit of\nGod! What bondage so terrible as that of him who is given over to\nthe control of the worst of tyrants\u2014himself! Trust in God and obe- [677]\n[678]\n[679]\ndience to His will were the only conditions upon which Saul could\nbe king of Israel. Had he complied with these conditions throughout\nDeath of Saul 619\nhis reign, his kingdom would have been secure; God would have\nbeen his guide, the Omnipotent his shield. God had borne long\nwith Saul; and although his rebellion and obstinacy had well-nigh\nsilenced the divine voice in the soul, there was still opportunity for\nrepentance. But when in his peril he turned from God to obtain light\nfrom a confederate of Satan, he had cut the last tie that bound him\nto his Maker; he had placed himself fully under the control of that\ndemoniac power which for years had been exercised upon him, and\nwhich had brought him to the verge of destruction.\nUnder the cover of darkness Saul and his attendants made their\nway across the plain, and, safely passing the Philistine host, they\ncrossed the mountain ridge, to the lonely home of the sorceress of\nEndor. Here the woman with a familiar spirit had hidden herself\naway that she might secretly continue her profane incantations. Dis-\nguised as he was, Saul\u2019s lofty stature and kingly port declared that he\nwas no common soldier. The woman suspected that her visitor was\nSaul, and his rich gifts strengthened her suspicions. To his request,\n\u201cI pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him\nup, whom I shall name unto thee,\u201d the woman answered, \u201cBehold,\nthou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that\nhave familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore\nthen layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?\u201d Then \u201cSaul\nsware to her by the Lord, saying, As the Lord liveth, there shall\nno punishment happen to thee for this thing.\u201d And when she said,\n\u201cWhom shall I bring up unto thee?\u201d he answered, \u201cSamuel.\u201d\nAfter practicing her incantations, she said, \u201cI saw gods ascending\nout of the earth.... An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a\nmantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with\nhis face to the ground, and bowed himself.\u201d\nIt was not God\u2019s holy prophet that came forth at the spell of a\nsorcerer\u2019s incantation. Samuel was not present in that haunt of evil\nspirits. That supernatural appearance was produced solely by the\npower of Satan. He could as easily assume the form of Samuel as\nhe could assume that of an angel of light, when he tempted Christ in\nthe wilderness.\nThe woman\u2019s first words under the spell of her incantation had [680]\nbeen addressed to the king, \u201cWhy hast thou deceived me? for thou\nart Saul.\u201d Thus the first act of the evil spirit which personated the\n620 Patriarchs and Prophets\nprophet was to communicate secretly with this wicked woman, to\nwarn her of the deception that had been practiced upon her. The\nmessage to Saul from the pretended prophet was, \u201cWhy hast thou\ndisquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore\ndistressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is\ndeparted from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets,\nnor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make\nknown unto me what I shall do.\u201d\nWhen Samuel was living, Saul had despised his counsel and\nhad resented his reproofs. But now, in the hour of his distress and\ncalamity, he felt that the prophet\u2019s guidance was his only hope, and\nin order to communicate with Heaven\u2019s ambassador he vainly had\nrecourse to the messenger of hell! Saul had placed himself fully in\nthe power of Satan; and now he whose only delight is in causing\nmisery and destruction, made the most of his advantage, to work\nthe ruin of the unhappy king. In answer to Saul\u2019s agonized entreaty\ncame the terrible message, professedly from the lips of Samuel:\n\u201cWherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the Lord is departed\nfrom thee, and is become thine enemy? And the Lord hath done\nto him, as he spake by me: for the Lord hath rent the kingdom out\nof thine hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David: because\nthou obeyedst not the voice of the Lord, nor executedst His fierce\nwrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the Lord done this thing unto\nthee this day. Moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with thee\ninto the hand of the Philistines.\u201d\nAll through his course of rebellion Saul had been flattered and\ndeceived by Satan. It is the tempter\u2019s work to belittle sin, to make\nthe path of transgression easy and inviting, to blind the mind to the\nwarnings and threatenings of the Lord. Satan, by his bewitching\npower, had led Saul to justify himself in defiance of Samuel\u2019s re-\nproofs and warning. But now, in his extremity, he turned upon him,\npresenting the enormity of his sin and the hopelessness of pardon,\nthat he might goad him to desperation. Nothing could have been\nbetter chosen to destroy his courage and confuse his judgment, or to[681]\ndrive him to despair and self-destruction.\nSaul was faint with weariness and fasting; he was terrified and\nconscience-stricken. As the fearful prediction fell upon his ear, his\nDeath of Saul 621\nform swayed like an oak before the tempest, and he fell prostrate to\nthe earth.\nThe sorceress was filled with alarm. The king of Israel lay before\nher like one dead. Should he perish in her retreat, what would be\nthe consequences to herself? She besought him to arise and partake\nof food, urging that since she had imperiled her life in granting\nhis desire, he should yield to her request for the preservation of\nhis own. His servants joining their entreaties, Saul yielded at last,\nand the woman set before him the fatted calf and unleavened bread\nhastily prepared. What a scene!\u2014In the wild cave of the sorceress,\nwhich but a little before had echoed with the words of doom\u2014in\nthe presence of Satan\u2019s messenger\u2014he who had been anointed of\nGod as king over Israel sat down to eat, in preparation for the day\u2019s\ndeadly strife.\nBefore the break of day he returned with his attendants to the\ncamp of Israel to make ready for the conflict. By consulting that\nspirit of darkness Saul had destroyed himself. Oppressed by the\nhorror of despair, it would be impossible for him to inspire his army\nwith courage. Separated from the Source of strength, he could not\nlead the minds of Israel to look to God as their helper. Thus the\nprediction of evil would work its own accomplishment.\nOn the plain of Shunem and the slopes of Mount Gilboa the\narmies of Israel and the hosts of the Philistines closed in mortal\ncombat. Though the fearful scene in the cave of Endor had driven all\nhope from his heart, Saul fought with desperate valor for his throne\nand his kingdom. But it was in vain. \u201cThe men of Israel fled from\nbefore the Philistines, and fell down slain in Mount Gilboa.\u201d Three\nbrave sons of the king died at his side. The archers pressed upon\nSaul. He had seen his soldiers falling around him and his princely\nsons cut down by the sword. Himself wounded, he could neither\nfight nor fly. Escape was impossible, and determined not to be taken\nalive by the Philistines, he bade his armor-bearer, \u201cDraw thy sword,\nand thrust me through therewith.\u201d When the man refused to lift his\nhand against the Lord\u2019s anointed, Saul took his own life by falling [682]\nupon his sword.\nThus the first king of Israel perished, with the guilt of self-\nmurder upon his soul. His life had been a failure, and he went down\n622 Patriarchs and Prophets\nin dishonor and despair, because he had set up his own perverse will\nagainst the will of God.\nThe tidings of defeat spread far and wide, carrying terror to all\nIsrael. The people fled from the cities, and the Philistines took\nundisturbed possession. Saul\u2019s reign, independent of God, had well-\nnigh proved the ruin of his people.\nOn the day following the engagement, the Philistines, searching\nthe battlefield to rob the slain, discovered the bodies of Saul and\nhis three sons. To complete their triumph, they cut off the head of\nSaul and stripped him of his armor; then the head and the armor,\nreeking with blood, were sent to the country of the Philistines as a\ntrophy of victory, \u201cto publish it in the house of their idols, and among\nthe people.\u201d The armor was finally put in \u201cthe house of Ashtaroth,\u201d\nwhile the head was fastened in the temple of Dagon. Thus the glory\nof the victory was ascribed to the power of these false gods, and the\nname of Jehovah was dishonored.\nThe dead bodies of Saul and his sons were dragged to Beth-shan,\na city not far from Gilboa, and near the river Jordan. Here they\nwere hung up in chains, to be devoured by birds of prey. But the\nbrave men of Jabesh-gilead, remembering Saul\u2019s deliverance of their\ncity in his earlier and happier years, now manifested their gratitude\nby rescuing the bodies of the king and princes, and giving them\nhonorable burial. Crossing the Jordan by night, they \u201ctook the body\nof Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and\ncame to Jabesh, and burnt them there, and they took their bones, and\nburied them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.\u201d Thus the\nnoble deed performed forty years before, secured for Saul and his\nsons burial by tender and pitying hands in that dark hour of defeat\nand dishonor.\nChapter 67\u2014Ancient and Modern Sorcery [683]\nThe Scripture account of Saul\u2019s visit to the woman of Endor has\nbeen a source of perplexity to many students of the Bible. There\nare some who take the position that Samuel was actually present\nat the interview with Saul, but the Bible itself furnishes sufficient\nground for a contrary conclusion. If, as claimed by some, Samuel\nwas in heaven, he must have been summoned thence, either by the\npower of God or by that of Satan. None can believe for a moment\nthat Satan had power to call the holy prophet of God from heaven\nto honor the incantations of an abandoned woman. Nor can we\nconclude that God summoned him to the witch\u2019s cave; for the Lord\nhad already refused to communicate with Saul, by dreams, by Urim,\nor by prophets. 1 Samuel 28:6. These were God\u2019s own appointed\nmediums of communication, and He did not pass them by to deliver\nthe message through the agent of Satan.\nThe message itself is sufficient evidence of its origin. Its object\nwas not to lead Saul to repentance, but to urge him on to ruin; and\nthis is not the work of God, but of Satan. Furthermore, the act of\nSaul in consulting a sorceress is cited in Scripture as one reason why\nhe was rejected by God and abandoned to destruction: \u201cSaul died for\nhis transgression which he committed against the Lord, even against\nthe word of the Lord, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel\nof one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire of it; and inquired not\nof the Lord: therefore He slew him, and turned the kingdom unto\nDavid the son of Jesse.\u201d 1 Chronicles 10:13, 14. Here it is distinctly\nstated that Saul inquired of the familiar spirit, not of the Lord. He\ndid not communicate with Samuel, the prophet of God; but through\nthe sorceress he held intercourse with Satan. Satan could not present\nthe real Samuel, but he did present a counterfeit, that served his\npurpose of deception.\nNearly all forms of ancient sorcery and witchcraft were founded [684]\nupon a belief in communion with the dead. Those who practiced\nthe arts of necromancy claimed to have intercourse with departed\n623\n624 Patriarchs and Prophets\nspirits, and to obtain through them a knowledge of future events.\nThis custom of consulting the dead is referred to in the prophecy of\nIsaiah: \u201cWhen they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have\nfamiliar spirits, and unto wizards that peep and that mutter: should\nnot a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?\u201d Isaiah\n8:19.\nThis same belief in communion with the dead formed the cor-\nnerstone of heathen idolatry. The gods of the heathen were believed\nto be the deified spirits of departed heroes. Thus the religion of\nthe heathen was a worship of the dead. This is evident from the\nScriptures. In the account of the sin of Israel at Bethpeor, it is stated:\n\u201cIsrael abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom\nwith the daughters of Moab. And they called the people unto the\nsacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to\ntheir gods. And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor.\u201d Numbers 25:1-\n3. The psalmist tells us to what kind of gods these sacrifices were\noffered. Speaking of the same apostasy of the Israelites, he says,\n\u201cThey joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices\nof the dead\u201d (Psalm 106:28); that is, sacrifices that had been offered\nto the dead.\nThe deification of the dead has held a prominent place in nearly\nevery system of heathenism, as has also the supposed communion\nwith the dead. The gods were believed to communicate their will\nto men, and also, when consulted, to give them counsel. Of this\ncharacter were the famous oracles of Greece and Rome.\nThe belief in communion with the dead is still held, even in\nprofessedly Christian lands. Under the name of spiritualism the\npractice of communicating with beings claiming to be the spirits of\nthe departed has become widespread. It is calculated to take hold of\nthe sympathies of those who have laid their loved ones in the grave.\nSpiritual beings sometimes appear to persons in the form of their\ndeceased friends, and relate incidents connected with their lives and\nperform acts which they performed while living. In this way they\nlead men to believe that their dead friends are angels, hovering over\nthem and communicating with them. Those who thus assume to be[685]\nthe spirits of the departed are regarded with a certain idolatry, and\nwith many their word has greater weight than the word of God.\nAncient and Modern Sorcery 625\nThere are many, however, who regard spiritualism as a mere\nimposture. The manifestations by which it supports its claims to\na supernatural character are attributed to fraud on the part of the\nmedium. But while it is true that the results of trickery have often\nbeen palmed off as genuine manifestations, there have also been\nmarked evidences of supernatural power. And many who reject spiri-\ntualism as the result of human skill or cunning will, when confronted\nwith manifestations which they cannot account for upon this ground,\nbe led to acknowledge its claims.\nModern spiritualism and the forms of ancient witchcraft and\nidol worship\u2014all having communion with the dead as their vital\nprinciple\u2014are founded upon that first lie by which Satan beguiled\nEve in Eden: \u201cYe shall not surely die: for God doth know that in\nthe day ye eat thereof, ... ye shall be as gods.\u201d Genesis 3:4, 5. Alike\nbased upon falsehood and perpetuating the same, they are alike from\nthe father of lies.\nThe Hebrews were expressly forbidden to engage in any man-\nner in pretended communion with the dead. God closed this door\neffectually when He said: \u201cThe dead know not anything.... Neither\nhave they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under\nthe sun.\u201d Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6. \u201cHis breath goeth forth, he returneth to\nhis earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.\u201d Psalm 146:4. And\nthe Lord declared to Israel: \u201cThe soul that turneth after such as have\nfamiliar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will\neven set My face against that soul, and will cut him off from among\nhis people.\u201d Leviticus 20:6.\nThe \u201cfamiliar spirits\u201d were not the spirits of the dead, but evil\nangels, the messengers of Satan. Ancient idolatry, which, as we have\nseen, comprises both worship of the dead and pretended communion\nwith them, is declared by the Bible to have been demon worship.\nThe apostle Paul, in warning his brethren against participating, in\nany manner, in the idolatry of their heathen neighbors, says, \u201cThe\nthings which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not\nto God, and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.\u201d [686]\n1 Corinthians 10:20. The psalmist, speaking of Israel, says that\n\u201cthey sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,\u201d and in\nthe next verse he explains that they sacrificed them \u201cunto the idols\n626 Patriarchs and Prophets\nof Canaan.\u201d Psalm 106:37, 38. In their supposed worship of dead\nmen they were in reality worshiping demons.\nModern spiritualism, resting upon the same foundation, is but a\nrevival in a new form of the witchcraft and demon worship that God\ncondemned and prohibited of old. It is foretold in the Scriptures,\nwhich declare that \u201cin the latter times some shall depart from the\nfaith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.\u201d 1\nTimothy 4:1. Paul, in his second letter to the Thessalonians, points\nto the special working of Satan in spiritualism as an event to take\nplace immediately before the second advent of Christ. Speaking of\nChrist\u2019s second coming, he declares that it is \u201cafter the working of\nSatan with all power and signs and lying wonders.\u201d 2 Thessalonians\n2:9. And Peter, describing the dangers to which the church was to\nbe exposed in the last days, says that as there were false prophets\nwho led Israel into sin, so there will be false teachers, \u201cwho privily\nshall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought\nthem.... And many shall follow their pernicious ways.\u201d 2 Peter 2:1,\n2. Here the apostle has pointed out one of the marked characteristics\nof spiritualist teachers. They refuse to acknowledge Christ as the\nSon of God. Concerning such teachers the beloved John declares:\n\u201cWho is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is\nantichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. Whosoever denieth\nthe Son, the same hath not the Father.\u201d 1 John 2:22, 23. Spiritualism,\nby denying Christ, denies both the Father and the Son, and the Bible\npronounces it the manifestation of antichrist.\nBy the prediction of Saul\u2019s doom, given through the woman of\nEndor, Satan planned to ensnare the people of Israel. He hoped\nthat they would be inspired with confidence in the sorceress, and\nwould be led to consult her. Thus they would turn from God as\ntheir counselor and would place themselves under the guidance of\nSatan. The lure by which spiritualism attracts the multitudes is its\npretended power to draw aside the veil from the future and reveal\nto men what God has hidden. God has in His word opened before[687]\nus the great events of the future\u2014all that it is essential for us to\nknow\u2014and He has given us a safe guide for our feet amid all its\nperils; but it is Satan\u2019s purpose to destroy men\u2019s confidence in God,\nto make them dissatisfied with their condition in life, and to lead\nAncient and Modern Sorcery 627\nthem to seek a knowledge of what God has wisely veiled from them,\nand to despise what He has revealed in His Holy Word.\nThere are many who become restless when they cannot know\nthe definite outcome of affairs. They cannot endure uncertainty, and\nin their impatience they refuse to wait to see the salvation of God.\nApprehended evils drive them nearly distracted. They give way to\ntheir rebellious feelings, and run hither and thither in passionate grief,\nseeking intelligence concerning that which has not been revealed. If\nthey would but trust in God, and watch unto prayer, they would find\ndivine consolation. Their spirit would be calmed by communion\nwith God. The weary and the heavy-laden would find rest unto\ntheir souls if they would only go to Jesus; but when they neglect the\nmeans that God has ordained for their comfort, and resort to other\nsources, hoping to learn what God has withheld, they commit the\nerror of Saul, and thereby gain only a knowledge of evil.\nGod is not pleased with this course, and has expressed it in the\nmost explicit terms. This impatient haste to tear away the veil from\nthe future reveals a lack of faith in God and leaves the soul open to\nthe suggestions of the master deceiver. Satan leads men to consult\nthose that have familiar spirits; and by revealing hidden things of\nthe past, he inspires confidence in his power to foretell things to\ncome. By experience gained through the long ages he can reason\nfrom cause to effect and often forecast, with a degree of accuracy,\nsome of the future events of man\u2019s life. Thus he is enabled to deceive\npoor, misguided souls and bring them under his power and lead them\ncaptive at his will.\nGod has given us the warning by His prophet: \u201cWhen they shall\nsay unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto\nwizards that peep and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their\nGod? for the living to the dead? To the law and to the testimony: if\nthey speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light\nin them.\u201d Isaiah 8:19, 20.\nShall those who have a holy God, infinite in wisdom and power, [688]\ngo unto wizards, whose knowledge comes from intimacy with the\nenemy of our Lord? God Himself is the light of His people; He bids\nthem fix their eyes by faith upon the glories that are veiled from\nhuman sight. The Sun of Righteousness sends its bright beams into\ntheir hearts; they have light from the throne of heaven, and they have\n628 Patriarchs and Prophets\nno desire to turn away from the source of light to the messengers of\nSatan.\nThe demon\u2019s message to Saul, although it was a denunciation\nof sin and a prophecy of retribution, was not meant to reform him,\nbut to goad him to despair and ruin. Oftener, however, it serves\nthe tempter\u2019s purpose best to lure men to destruction by flattery.\nThe teaching of the demon gods in ancient times fostered the vilest\nlicense. The divine precepts condemning sin and enforcing righ-\nteousness were set aside; truth was lightly regarded, and impurity\nwas not only permitted but enjoined. Spiritualism declares that there\nis no death, no sin, no judgment, no retribution; that \u201cmen are un-\nfallen demigods;\u201d that desire is the highest law; and that man is\naccountable only to himself. The barriers that God has erected to\nguard truth, purity, and reverence are broken down, and many are\nthus emboldened in sin. Does not such teaching suggest an origin\nsimilar to that of demon worship?\nThe Lord presented before Israel the results of holding commu-\nnion with evil spirits, in the abominations of the Canaanites: they\nwere without natural affection, idolaters, adulterers, murderers, and\nabominable by every corrupt thought and revolting practice. Men do\nnot know their own hearts; for \u201cthe heart is deceitful above all things,\nand desperately wicked.\u201d Jeremiah 17:9. But God understands the\ntendencies of the depraved nature of man. Then, as now, Satan was\nwatching to bring about conditions favorable to rebellion, that the\npeople of Israel might make themselves as abhorrent to God as were\nthe Canaanites. The adversary of souls is ever on the alert to open\nchannels for the unrestrained flow of evil in us; for he desires that\nwe may be ruined, and be condemned before God.\nSatan was determined to keep his hold on the land of Canaan,\nand when it was made the habitation of the children of Israel, and\nthe law of God was made the law of the land, he hated Israel with a\ncruel and malignant hatred and plotted their destruction. Through[689]\nthe agency of evil spirits strange gods were introduced; and because\nof transgression, the chosen people were finally scattered from the\nLand of Promise. This history Satan is striving to repeat in our day.\nGod is leading His people out from the abominations of the world,\nthat they may keep His law; and because of this, the rage of \u201cthe\naccuser of our brethren\u201d knows no bounds. \u201cThe devil is come down\nAncient and Modern Sorcery 629\nunto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a\nshort time.\u201d Revelation 12:10, 12. The antitypical land of promise is\njust before us, and Satan is determined to destroy the people of God\nand cut them off from their inheritance. The admonition, \u201cWatch\nye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation\u201d (Mark 14:38), was never\nmore needed than now.\nThe word of the Lord to ancient Israel is addressed also to His\npeople in this age: \u201cRegard not them that have familiar spirits,\nneither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them;\u201d \u201cfor all that do\nthese things are an abomination unto the Lord.\u201d Leviticus 19:31;\nDeuteronomy 18:12.\nChapter 68\u2014David at Ziklag[690]\nThis chapter is based on 1 Samuel 29; 30; 2 Samuel 1.\nDavid and his men had not taken part in the battle between Saul\nand the Philistines, though they had marched with the Philistines to\nthe field of conflict. As the two armies prepared to join battle the\nson of Jesse found himself in a situation of great perplexity. It was\nexpected that he would fight for the Philistines. Should he in the\nengagement quit the post assigned him and retire from the field, he\nwould not only brand himself with cowardice, but with ingratitude\nand treachery to Achish, who had protected him and confided in\nhim. Such an act would cover his name with infamy, and would\nexpose him to the wrath of enemies more to be feared than Saul. Yet\nhe could not for a moment consent to fight against Israel. Should\nhe do this, he would become a traitor to his country\u2014the enemy of\nGod and of His people. It would forever bar his way to the throne of\nIsrael; and should Saul be slain in the engagement, his death would\nbe charged upon David.\nDavid was caused to feel that he had missed his path. Far better\nwould it have been for him to find refuge in God\u2019s strong fortresses\nof the mountains than with the avowed enemies of Jehovah and His\npeople. But the Lord in His great mercy did not punish this error of\nHis servant by leaving him to himself in his distress and perplexity;\nfor though David, losing his grasp on divine power, had faltered\nand turned aside from the path of strict integrity, it was still the\npurpose of his heart to be true to God. While Satan and his host were\nbusy helping the adversaries of God and of Israel to plan against a\nking who had forsaken God, the angels of the Lord were working\nto deliver David from the peril into which he had fallen. Heavenly\nmessengers moved upon the Philistine princes to protest against the\npresence of David and his force with the army in the approaching\nconflict.\n\u201cWhat do these Hebrews here?\u201d cried the Philistine lords, press-[691]\n630\nDavid at Ziklag 631\ning about Achish. The latter, unwilling to part with so important\nan ally, answered, \u201cIs not this David, the servant of Saul the king\nof Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I\nhave found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?\u201d\nBut the princes angrily persisted in their demand: \u201cMake this\nfellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast\nappointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the\nbattle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile\nhimself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these\nmen? Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances,\nsaying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?\u201d The\nslaughter of their famed champion and the triumph of Israel upon\nthat occasion were still fresh in the memory of the Philistine lords.\nThey did not believe that David would fight against his own people;\nand should he, in the heat of battle, take sides with them, he could\ninflict greater harm on the Philistines than would the whole of Saul\u2019s\narmy.\nThus Achish was forced to yield, and calling David, said unto\nhim, \u201cSurely as Jehovah liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going\nout and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for\nI have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me\nunto this day. Nevertheless the lords favor thee not. Wherefore\nnow return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the\nPhilistines.\u201d\nDavid, fearing to betray his real feelings, answered, \u201cBut what\nhave I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I\nhave been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the\nenemies of my lord the king?\u201d\nThe reply of Achish must have sent a thrill of shame and remorse\nthrough David\u2019s heart, as he thought how unworthy of a servant\nof Jehovah were the deceptions to which he had stooped. \u201cI know\nthat thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God,\u201d said the king:\n\u201cnotwithstanding, the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall\nnot go up with us to the battle. Wherefore now rise up early in the\nmorning with thy master\u2019s servants that are come with thee: and as\nsoon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.\u201d Thus\nthe snare in which David had become entangled was broken, and he\nwas set free.\n632 Patriarchs and Prophets\nAfter three days\u2019 travel David and his band of six hundred men[692]\nreached Ziklag, their Philistine home. But a scene of desolation met\ntheir view. The Amalekites, taking advantage of David\u2019s absence,\nwith his force, had avenged themselves for his incursions into their\nterritory. They had surprised the city while it was left unguarded,\nand having sacked and burned it, had departed, taking all the women\nand children as captives, with much spoil.\nDumb with horror and amazement, David and his men for a\nlittle time gazed in silence upon the blackened and smoldering ruins.\nThen as a sense of their terrible desolation burst upon them, those\nbattle-scarred warriors \u201clifted up their voice and wept, until they had\nno more power to weep.\u201d\nHere again David was chastened for the lack of faith that had\nled him to place himself among the Philistines. He had opportunity\nto see how much safety could be found among the foes of God and\nHis people. David\u2019s followers turned upon him as the cause of their\ncalamities. He had provoked the vengeance of the Amalekites by\nhis attack upon them; yet, too confident of security in the midst of\nhis enemies, he had left the city unguarded. Maddened with grief\nand rage, his soldiers were now ready for any desperate measures,\nand they threatened even to stone their leader.\nDavid seemed to be cut off from every human support. All that\nhe held dear on earth had been swept from him. Saul had driven him\nfrom his country; the Philistines had driven him from the camp; the\nAmalekites had plundered his city; his wives and children had been\nmade prisoners; and his own familiar friends had banded against him,\nand threatened him even with death. In this hour of utmost extremity\nDavid, instead of permitting his mind to dwell upon these painful\ncircumstances, looked earnestly to God for help. He \u201cencouraged\nhimself in the Lord.\u201d He reviewed his past eventful life. Wherein\nhad the Lord ever forsaken him? His soul was refreshed in recalling\nthe many evidences of God\u2019s favor. The followers of David, by their\ndiscontent and impatience, made their affliction doubly grievous; but\nthe man of God, having even greater cause for grief, bore himself\nwith fortitude. \u201cWhat time I am afraid, I will trust in Thee\u201d (Psalm\n56:3), was the language of his heart. Though he himself could not[693]\ndiscern a way out of the difficulty, God could see it, and would teach\nhim what to do.\nDavid at Ziklag 633\nSending for Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, \u201cDavid\ninquired of the Lord, saying, If I pursue after this troop, shall I\novertake them?\u201d The answer was, \u201cPursue: for thou shalt surely\novertake them, and shalt without fail recover all.\u201d 1 Samuel 30:8,",

      "text": "At these words the tumult of grief and passion ceased. David\nand his soldiers at once set out in pursuit of their fleeing foe. So\nrapid was their march, that upon reaching the brook Besor, which\nempties near Gaza into the Mediterranean Sea, two hundred of the\nband were compelled by exhaustion to remain behind. But David\nwith the remaining four hundred pressed forward, nothing daunted.\nAdvancing, they came upon an Egyptian slave apparently about\nto perish from weariness and hunger. Upon receiving food and drink,\nhowever, he revived, and they learned that he had been left to die\nby his cruel master, an Amalekite belonging to the invading force.\nHe told the story of the raid and pillage; and then, having exacted\na promise that he should not be slain or delivered to his master, he\nconsented to lead David\u2019s company to the camp of their enemies.\nAs they came in sight of the encampment a scene of revelry met\ntheir gaze. The victorious host were holding high festival. \u201cThey\nwere spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and\ndancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the\nland of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.\u201d An immediate\nattack was ordered, and the pursuers rushed fiercely upon their prey.\nThe Amalekites were surprised and thrown into confusion. The\nbattle was continued all that night and the following day, until nearly\nthe entire host was slain. Only a band of four hundred men, mounted\nupon camels, succeeded in making their escape. The word of the\nLord was fulfilled. \u201cDavid recovered all that the Amalekites had\ncarried away: and David rescued his two wives. And there was\nnothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor\ndaughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them:\nDavid recovered all.\u201d\nWhen David had invaded the territory of the Amalekites, he had\nput to the sword all the inhabitants that fell into his hands. But for the [694]\nrestraining power of God the Amalekites would have retaliated by\ndestroying the people of Ziklag. They decided to spare the captives,\ndesiring to heighten the honor of the triumph by leading home a\n634 Patriarchs and Prophets\nlarge number of prisoners, and intending afterward to sell them as\nslaves. Thus, unwittingly, they fulfilled God\u2019s purpose, keeping the\nprisoners unharmed, to be restored to their husbands and fathers.\nAll earthly powers are under the control of the Infinite One. To\nthe mightiest ruler, to the most cruel oppressor, He says, \u201cHitherto\nshalt thou come, but no further.\u201d Job 38:11. God\u2019s power is con-\nstantly exercised to counteract the agencies of evil; He is ever at\nwork among men, not for their destruction, but for their correction\nand preservation.\nWith great rejoicing the victors took up their homeward march.\nUpon reaching their companions who had remained behind, the more\nselfish and unruly of the four hundred urged that those who had had\nno part in the battle should not share the spoils; that it was enough\nfor them to recover each his wife and children. But David would\npermit no such arrangement. \u201cYe shall not do so, my brethren,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cwith that which the Lord hath given us.... As his part is that\ngoeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff;\nthey shall part alike.\u201d Thus the matter was settled, and it afterward\nbecame a statute in Israel that all who were honorably connected\nwith a military campaign should share the spoils equally with those\nwho engaged in actual combat.\nBesides recovering all the spoil that had been taken from Zik-\nlag, David and his band had captured extensive flocks and herds\nbelonging to the Amalekites. These were called \u201cDavid\u2019s spoil;\u201d\nand upon returning to Ziklag, he sent from this spoil presents to\nthe elders of his own tribe of Judah. In this distribution all those\nwere remembered who had befriended him and his followers in the\nmountain fastnesses, when he had been forced to flee from place to\nplace for his life. Their kindness and sympathy, so precious to the\nhunted fugitive, were thus gratefully acknowledged.\nIt was the third day since David and his warriors returned to\nZiklag. As they labored to restore their ruined homes, they watched\nwith anxious hearts for tidings of the battle which they knew must[695]\nhave been fought between Israel and the Philistines. Suddenly a\nmessenger entered the town, \u201cwith his clothes rent, and earth upon\nhis head.\u201d He was at once brought to David, before whom he bowed\nwith reverence, expressing recognition of him as a powerful prince,\nwhose favor he desired. David eagerly inquired how the battle had\nDavid at Ziklag 635\ngone. The fugitive reported Saul\u2019s defeat and death, and the death of\nJonathan. But he went beyond a simple statement of facts. Evidently\nsupposing that David must cherish enmity toward his relentless\npersecutor, the stranger hoped to secure honor to himself as the\nslayer of the king. With an air of boasting the man went on to relate\nthat during the battle he found the monarch of Israel wounded, and\nsore pressed by his foes, and that at his own request the messenger\nhad slain him. The crown from his head and the golden bracelets\nfrom his arm he had brought to David. He confidently expected that\nthese tidings would be hailed with joy, and that a rich reward would\nbe his for the part that he had acted.\nBut \u201cDavid took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise\nall the men that were with him: and they mourned, and wept, and\nfasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the\npeople of the Lord, and for the house of Israel; because they were\nfallen by the sword.\u201d\nThe first shock of the fearful tidings past, David\u2019s thoughts re-\nturned to the stranger herald, and the crime of which, according\nto his own statement, he was guilty. The chief demanded of the\nyoung man, \u201cWhence art thou?\u201d And he answered, \u201cI am the son of\na stranger, an Amalekite. And David said unto him, How wast thou\nnot afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the Lord\u2019s anointed?\u201d\nTwice David had had Saul in his power; but when urged to slay him,\nhe had refused to lift his hand against him who had been consecrated\nby the command of God to rule over Israel. Yet the Amalekite feared\nnot to boast that he had slain the king of Israel. He had accused\nhimself of a crime worthy of death, and the penalty was inflicted at\nonce. David said, \u201cThy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath\ntestified against thee, saying, I have slain the Lord\u2019s anointed.\u201d\nDavid\u2019s grief at the death of Saul was sincere and deep, evincing\nthe generosity of a noble nature. He did not exult in the fall of his\nenemy. The obstacle that had barred his access to the throne of Israel [696]\nwas removed, but at this he did not rejoice. Death had obliterated\nthe remembrance of Saul\u2019s distrust and cruelty, and now nothing in\nhis history was thought of but that which was noble and kingly. The\nname of Saul was linked with that of Jonathan, whose friendship\nhad been so true and so unselfish.\n636 Patriarchs and Prophets\nThe song in which David gave utterance to the feelings of his\nheart became a treasure to his nation, and to the people of God in all\nsubsequent ages:\n\u201cThy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places!\nHow are the mighty fallen!\nTell it not in Gath,\nPublish it not in the streets of Ashkelon;\nLest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,\nLest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.\nYe mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain upon you,\nneither fields of\nofferings:\nFor there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,\nThe shield of Saul as of one not anointed with oil....\nSaul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives,\nAnd in their death they were not divided;\nThey were swifter than eagles,\nThey were stronger than lions.\nYe daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,\nWho clothed you in scarlet delicately,\nWho put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.\nHow are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!\nJonathan is slain upon thy high places.\nI am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan:\nVery pleasant hast thou been unto me:\nThy love to me was wonderful,\nPassing the love of women.\nHow are the mighty fallen,\nAnd the weapons of war perished!\u201d\n2 Samuel 1:19-27, R.V .\nChapter 69\u2014David Called to the Throne [697]\nThis chapter is based on 2 Samuel 2 to 5:5.\nThe death of Saul removed the dangers that had made David an\nexile. The way was now open for him to return to his own land.\nWhen the days of mourning for Saul and Jonathan were ended,\n\u201cDavid inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up into any of the\ncities of Judah? And the Lord said unto him, Go up. And David\nsaid, Whither shall I go up? And He said, Unto Hebron.\u201d\nHebron was twenty miles north from Beersheba, and about mid-\nway between that city and the future site of Jerusalem. It was origi-\nnally called Kirjath-arba, the city of Arba, the father of Anak. Later\nit was called Mamre, and here was the burial place of the patriarchs,\n\u201cthe cave of Machpelah.\u201d Hebron had been the possession of Caleb\nand was now the chief city of Judah. It lies in a valley surrounded by\nfertile hill country and fruitful lands. The most beautiful vineyards\nof Palestine were on its borders, together with numerous plantations\nof olive and other fruit trees.\nDavid and his followers immediately prepared to obey the in-\nstruction which they had received from God. The six hundred armed\nmen, with their wives and children, their flocks and herds, were soon\non the way to Hebron. As the caravan entered the city the men of\nJudah were waiting to welcome David as the future king of Israel.\nArrangements were at once made for his coronation. \u201cAnd there\nthey anointed David king over the house of Judah.\u201d But no effort\nwas made to establish his authority by force over the other tribes.\nOne of the first acts of the new-crowned monarch was to express\nhis tender regard for the memory of Saul and Jonathan. Upon learn-\ning of the brave deed of the men of Jabesh-gilead in rescuing the\nbodies of the fallen leaders and giving them honorable burial, David\nsent an embassy to Jabesh with the message, \u201cBlessed be ye of the [698]\nLord, that ye have showed this kindness unto your lord, even unto\nSaul, and have buried him. And now the Lord show kindness and\n637\n638 Patriarchs and Prophets\ntruth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness.\u201d And he\nannounced his own accession to the throne of Judah and invited the\nallegiance of those who had proved themselves so truehearted.\nThe Philistines did not oppose the action of Judah in making\nDavid king. They had befriended him in his exile, in order to harass\nand weaken the kingdom of Saul, and now they hoped that because\nof their former kindness to David the extension of his power would,\nin the end, work to their advantage. But David\u2019s reign was not to\nbe free from trouble. With his coronation began the dark record of\nconspiracy and rebellion. David did not sit upon a traitor\u2019s throne;\nGod had chosen him to be king of Israel, and there had been no\noccasion for distrust or opposition. Yet hardly had his authority been\nacknowledged by the men of Judah, when through the influence of\nAbner, Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, was proclaimed king, and set\nupon a rival throne in Israel.\nIshbosheth was but a weak and incompetent representative of\nthe house of Saul, while David was pre-eminently qualified to bear\nthe responsibilities of the kingdom. Abner, the chief agent in raising\nIshbosheth to kingly power, had been commander-in-chief of Saul\u2019s\narmy, and was the most distinguished man in Israel. Abner knew\nthat David had been appointed by the Lord to the throne of Israel,\nbut having so long hunted and pursued him, he was not now willing\nthat the son of Jesse should succeed to the kingdom over which Saul\nhad reigned.\nThe circumstances under which Abner was placed served to\ndevelop his real character and showed him to be ambitious and\nunprincipled. He had been intimately associated with Saul and had\nbeen influenced by the spirit of the king to despise the man whom\nGod had chosen to reign over Israel. His hatred had been increased\nby the cutting rebuke that David had given him at the time when the\ncruse of water and the spear of the king had been taken from the\nside of Saul as he slept in the camp. He remembered how David had\ncried in the hearing of the king and the people of Israel, \u201cArt not thou\na valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast\nthou not kept thy lord the king? ... This thing is not good that thou\nhast done. As the Lord liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have[699]\nnot kept your master, the Lord\u2019s anointed.\u201d This reproof had rankled\nin his breast, and he determined to carry out his revengeful purpose\nDavid Called to the Throne 639\nand create division in Israel, whereby he himself might be exalted.\nHe employed the representative of departed royalty to advance his\nown selfish ambitions and purposes. He knew that the people loved\nJonathan. His memory was cherished, and Saul\u2019s first successful\ncampaigns had not been forgotten by the army. With determination\nworthy a better cause, this rebellious leader went forward to carry\nout his plans.\nMahanaim, on the farther side of Jordan, was chosen as the\nroyal residence, since it offered the greatest security against attack,\neither from David or from the Philistines. Here the coronation of\nIshbosheth took place. His reign was first accepted by the tribes\neast of Jordan, and was finally extended over all Israel except Judah.\nFor two years the son of Saul enjoyed his honors in his secluded\ncapital. But Abner, intent upon extending his power over all Israel,\nprepared for aggressive warfare. And \u201cthere was long war between\nthe house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger\nand stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.\u201d\nAt last treachery overthrew the throne that malice and ambition\nhad established. Abner, becoming incensed against the weak and\nincompetent Ishbosheth, deserted to David, with the offer to bring\nover to him all the tribes of Israel. His proposals were accepted by\nthe king, and he was dismissed with honor to accomplish his purpose.\nBut the favorable reception of so valiant and famed a warrior excited\nthe jealousy of Joab, the commander-in-chief of David\u2019s army. There\nwas a blood feud between Abner and Joab, the former having slain\nAsahel, Joab\u2019s brother, during the war between Israel and Judah.\nNow Joab, seeing an opportunity to avenge his brother\u2019s death and\nrid himself of a prospective rival, basely took occasion to waylay\nand murder Abner.\nDavid, upon hearing of this treacherous assault, exclaimed, \u201cI\nand my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord forever from the blood\nof Abner the son of Ner. Let it rest on the head of Joab; and on all his\nfather\u2019s house.\u201d In view of the unsettled state of the kingdom, and\nthe power and position of the murderers\u2014for Joab\u2019s brother Abishai\nhad been united with him\u2014David could not visit the crime with\njust retribution, yet he publicly manifested his abhorrence of the [700]\nbloody deed. The burial of Abner was attended with public honors.\nThe army, with Joab at their head, were required to take part in the\n640 Patriarchs and Prophets\nservices of mourning, with rent garments and clothed in sackcloth.\nThe king manifested his grief by keeping a fast upon the day of\nburial; he followed the bier as chief mourner; and at the grave he\npronounced an elegy which was a cutting rebuke of the murderers.\n\u201cThe king lamented over Abner, and said:\n\u201cDied Abner as a fool dieth?\nThy hands were not bound,\nNor thy feet put into fetters:\nAs a man falleth before wicked men,\nSo fellest thou.\u201d\nDavid\u2019s magnanimous recognition of one who had been his bitter\nenemy won the confidence and admiration of all Israel. \u201cAll the\npeople took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the\nking did pleased all the people. For all the people and all Israel\nunderstood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son\nof Ner.\u201d In the private circle of his trusted counselors and attendants\nthe king spoke of the crime, and recognizing his own inability to\npunish the murderers as he desired, he left them to the justice of\nGod: \u201cKnow ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this\nday in Israel? And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and\nthese men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the Lord shall\nreward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.\u201d\nAbner had been sincere in his offers and representations to David,\nyet his motives were base and selfish. He had persistently opposed\nthe king of God\u2019s appointment, in the expectation of securing honor\nto himself. It was resentment, wounded pride, and passion that led\nhim to forsake the cause he had so long served; and in deserting\nto David he hoped to receive the highest position of honor in his\nservice. Had he succeeded in his purpose, his talents and ambition,\nhis great influence and want of godliness, would have endangered\nthe throne of David and the peace and prosperity of the nation.\n\u201cWhen Saul\u2019s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his\nhands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.\u201d It was\nevident that the kingdom could not long be maintained. Soon an-[701]\nother act of treachery completed the downfall of the waning power.\nIshbosheth was foully murdered by two of his captains, who, cutting\nDavid Called to the Throne 641\noff his head, hastened with it to the king of Judah, hoping thus to\ningratiate themselves in his favor.\nThey appeared before David with the gory witness to their crime,\nsaying, \u201cBehold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy,\nwhich sought thy life; and the Lord hath avenged my lord the king\nthis day of Saul, and of his seed.\u201d But David, whose throne God\nHimself had established, and whom God had delivered from his\nadversaries, did not desire the aid of treachery to establish his power.\nHe told these murderers of the doom visited upon him who boasted\nof slaying Saul. \u201cHow much more,\u201d he added, \u201cwhen wicked men\nhave slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I\nnot therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away\nfrom the earth? And David commanded his young men, and they\nslew them.... But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in\nthe sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.\u201d\nAfter the death of Ishbosheth there was a general desire among\nthe leading men of Israel that David should become king of all the\ntribes. \u201cThen came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron,\nand spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.\u201d They\ndeclared, \u201cThou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel:\nand the Lord said to thee, Thou shalt feed My people Israel, and\nthou shalt be a captain over Israel. So all the elders of Israel came\nto the king to Hebron; and King David made a league with them\nin Hebron before the Lord.\u201d Thus through the providence of God\nthe way had been opened for him to come to the throne. He had\nno personal ambition to gratify, for he had not sought the honor to\nwhich he had been brought.\nMore than eight thousand of the descendants of Aaron and of\nthe Levites waited upon David. The change in the sentiments of\nthe people was marked and decisive. The revolution was quiet and\ndignified, befitting the great work they were doing. Nearly half a\nmillion souls, the former subjects of Saul, thronged Hebron and its\nenvirons. The very hills and valleys were alive with the multitudes.\nThe hour for the coronation was appointed; the man who had been\nexpelled from the court of Saul, who had fled to the mountains and [702]\nhills and to the caves of the earth to preserve his life, was about to\nreceive the highest honor that can be conferred upon man by his\nfellow man. Priests and elders, clothed in the garments of their\n642 Patriarchs and Prophets\nsacred office, officers and soldiers with glittering spear and helmet,\nand strangers from long distances, stood to witness the coronation of\nthe chosen king. David was arrayed in the royal robe. The sacred oil\nwas put upon his brow by the high priest, for the anointing by Samuel\nhad been prophetic of what would take place at the inauguration\nof the king. The time had come, and David, by solemn rite, was\nconsecrated to his office as God\u2019s vicegerent. The scepter was placed\nin his hands. The covenant of his righteous sovereignty was written,\nand the people gave their pledges of loyalty. The diadem was placed\nupon his brow, and the coronation ceremony was over. Israel had\na king by divine appointment. He who had waited patiently for the\nLord, beheld the promise of God fulfilled. \u201cAnd David went on,\nand grew great, and the Lord God of hosts was with him.\u201d 2 Samuel\n5:10.\nChapter 70\u2014The Reign of David [703]\nThis chapter is based on 2 Samuel 5:6-25; 6; 7; 9; 10.\nAs soon as David was established on the throne of Israel he\nbegan to seek a more appropriate location for the capital of his\nrealm. Twenty miles from Hebron a place was selected as the\nfuture metropolis of the kingdom. Before Joshua had led the armies\nof Israel over Jordan it had been called Salem. Near this place\nAbraham had proved his loyalty to God. Eight hundred years before\nthe coronation of David it had been the home of Melchizedek, the\npriest of the most high God. It held a central and elevated position in\nthe country and was protected by an environment of hills. Being on\nthe border between Benjamin and Judah, it was in close proximity\nto Ephraim and was easy of access to the other tribes.\nIn order to secure this location the Hebrews must dispossess\na remnant of the Canaanites, who held a fortified position on the\nmountains of Zion and Moriah. This stronghold was called Jebus,\nand its inhabitants were known as Jebusites. For centuries Jebus had\nbeen looked upon as impregnable; but it was besieged and taken by\nthe Hebrews under the command of Joab, who, as the reward of his\nvalor, was made commander-in-chief of the armies of Israel. Jebus\nnow became the national capital, and its heathen name was changed\nto Jerusalem.\nHiram, king of the wealthy city of Tyre, on the Mediterranean\nSea, now sought an alliance with the king of Israel, and lent his aid\nto David in the work of erecting a palace at Jerusalem. Ambassadors\nwere sent from Tyre, accompanied by architects and workmen and\nlong trains laden with costly wood, cedar trees, and other valuable\nmaterial.\nThe increasing strength of Israel in its union under David, the\nacquisition of the stronghold of Jebus, and the alliance with Hiram,\nking of Tyre, excited the hostility of the Philistines, and they again\ninvaded the country with a strong force, taking up their position in [704]\n643\n644 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe valley of Rephaim, but a short distance from Jerusalem. David\nwith his men of war retired to the stronghold of Zion, to await divine\ndirection. \u201cAnd David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up to\nthe Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the Lord\nsaid unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines\ninto thine hand.\u201d\nDavid advanced upon the enemy at once, defeated and destroyed\nthem, and took from them the gods which they had brought with\nthem to ensure their victory. Exasperated by the humiliation of their\ndefeat, the Philistines gathered a still larger force, and returned to\nthe conflict. And again they \u201cspread themselves in the valley of\nRephaim.\u201d Again David sought the Lord and the great I AM took\nthe direction of the armies of Israel.\nGod instructed David, saying, \u201cThou shalt not go up; but fetch a\ncompass behind them, and come upon them over against the mul-\nberry trees. And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going\nin the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself:\nfor then shall the Lord go out before thee, to smite the host of the\nPhilistines.\u201d If David, like Saul, had chosen his own way, success\nwould not have attended him. But he did as the Lord had com-\nmanded, and he \u201csmote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even\nto Gazer. And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the\nLord brought the fear of him upon all nations.\u201d 1 Chronicles 14:16,\n17.\nNow that David was firmly established upon the throne and free\nfrom the invasions of foreign foes, he turned to the accomplishment\nof a cherished purpose\u2014to bring up the ark of God to Jerusalem.\nFor many years the ark had remained at Kirjath-jearim, nine miles\ndistant; but it was fitting that the capital of the nation should be\nhonored with the token of the divine Presence.\nDavid summoned thirty thousand of the leading men of Israel,\nfor it was his purpose to make the occasion a scene of great rejoicing\nand imposing display. The people responded gladly to the call. The\nhigh priest, with his brethren in sacred office and the princes and\nleading men of the tribes, assembled at Kirjath-jearim. David was\naglow with holy zeal. The ark was brought out from the house of\nAbinadab and placed upon a new cart drawn by oxen, while two of\nthe sons of Abinadab attended it.\nReign of David 645\nThe men of Israel followed with exultant shouts and songs of\nrejoicing, a multitude of voices joining in melody with the sound [705]\nof musical instruments; \u201cDavid and all the house of Israel played\nbefore the Lord ... on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels,\nand on cornets, and on cymbals.\u201d It had been long since Israel had\nwitnessed such a scene of triumph. With solemn gladness the vast\nprocession wound its way along the hills and valleys toward the\nHoly City.\nBut \u201cwhen they came to Nachon\u2019s threshing floor, Uzzah put\nforth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen\nshook it. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and\nGod smote him there for his rashness; [marginal reading] and there\nhe died by the ark of God.\u201d A sudden terror fell upon the rejoicing\nthrong. David was astonished and greatly alarmed, and in his heart\nhe questioned the justice of God. He had been seeking to honor the\nark as the symbol of the divine presence. Why, then, had that fearful\njudgment been sent to turn the season of gladness into an occasion\nof grief and mourning? Feeling that it would be unsafe to have the\nark near him, David determined to let it remain where it was. A\nplace was found for it nearby, at the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.\nThe fate of Uzzah was a divine judgment upon the violation of a\nmost explicit command. Through Moses the Lord had given special\ninstruction concerning the transportation of the ark. None but the\npriests, the descendants of Aaron, were to touch it, or even to look\nupon it uncovered. The divine direction was, \u201cThe sons of Kohath\nshall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they\ndie.\u201d Numbers 4:15. The priests were to cover the ark, and then the\nKohathites must lift it by the staves, which were placed in rings upon\neach side of the ark and were never removed. To the Gershonites\nand Merarites, who had in charge the curtains and boards and pillars\nof the tabernacle, Moses gave carts and oxen for the transportation\nof that which was committed to them. \u201cBut unto the sons of Kohath\nhe gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto\nthem was that they should bear upon their shoulders.\u201d Numbers 7:9.\nThus in the bringing of the ark from Kirjath-jearim there had been a\ndirect and inexcusable disregard of the Lord\u2019s directions.\nDavid and his people had assembled to perform a sacred work,\nand they had engaged in it with glad and willing hearts; but the [706]\n646 Patriarchs and Prophets\nLord could not accept the service, because it was not performed\nin accordance with His directions. The Philistines, who had not\na knowledge of God\u2019s law, had placed the ark upon a cart when\nthey returned it to Israel, and the Lord accepted the effort which\nthey made. But the Israelites had in their hands a plain statement\nof the will of God in all these matters, and their neglect of these\ninstructions was dishonoring to God. Upon Uzzah rested the greater\nguilt of presumption. Transgression of God\u2019s law had lessened his\nsense of its sacredness, and with unconfessed sins upon him he had,\nin face of the divine prohibition, presumed to touch the symbol of\nGod\u2019s presence. God can accept no partial obedience, no lax way\nof treating His commandments. By the judgment upon Uzzah He\ndesigned to impress upon all Israel the importance of giving strict\nheed to His requirements. Thus the death of that one man, by leading\nthe people to repentance, might prevent the necessity of inflicting\njudgments upon thousands.\nFeeling that his own heart was not wholly right with God, David,\nseeing the stroke upon Uzzah, had feared the ark, lest some sin on his\npart should bring judgments upon him. But Obed-edom, though he\nrejoiced with trembling, welcomed the sacred symbol as the pledge\nof God\u2019s favor to the obedient. The attention of all Israel was now\ndirected to the Gittite and his household; all watched to see how it\nwould fare with them. \u201cAnd the Lord blessed Obed-edom, and all\nhis household.\u201d\nUpon David the divine rebuke accomplished its work. He was\nled to realize as he had never realized before the sacredness of the\nlaw of God and the necessity of strict obedience. The favor shown to\nthe house of Obed-edom led David again to hope that the ark might\nbring a blessing to him and to his people.\nAt the end of three months he resolved to make another attempt\nto remove the ark, and he now gave earnest heed to carry out in\nevery particular the directions of the Lord. Again the chief men of\nthe nation were summoned, and a vast assemblage gathered about\nthe dwelling place of the Gittite. With reverent care the ark was\nnow placed upon the shoulders of men of divine appointment, the\nmultitude fell into line, and with trembling hearts the vast procession\nagain set forth. After advancing six paces the trumpet sounded a\nhalt. By David\u2019s direction sacrifices of \u201coxen and fatlings\u201d were to\nReign of David 647\nbe offered. Rejoicing now took the place of trembling and terror.\nThe king had laid aside his royal robes and had attired himself in [707]\na plain linen ephod, such as was worn by the priests. He did not\nby this act signify that he assumed priestly functions, for the ephod\nwas sometimes worn by others besides the priests. But in this holy\nservice he would take his place as, before God, on an equality with\nhis subjects. Upon that day Jehovah was to be adored. He was to be\nthe sole object of reverence.\nAgain the long train was in motion, and the music of harp and\ncornet, trumpet and cymbal, floated heavenward, blended with the\nmelody of many voices. \u201cAnd David danced before the Lord,\u201d in his\ngladness keeping time to the measure of the song.\nDavid\u2019s dancing in reverent joy before God has been cited by\npleasure lovers in justification of the fashionable modern dance,\nbut there is no ground for such an argument. In our day dancing is\nassociated with folly and midnight reveling. Health and morals are\nsacrificed to pleasure. By the frequenters of the ballroom God is\nnot an object of thought and reverence; prayer or the song of praise\nwould be felt to be out of place in their assemblies. This test should\nbe decisive. Amusements that have a tendency to weaken the love\nfor sacred things and lessen our joy in the service of God are not to\nbe sought by Christians. The music and dancing in joyful praise to\nGod at the removal of the ark had not the faintest resemblance to the\ndissipation of modern dancing. The one tended to the remembrance\nof God and exalted His holy name. The other is a device of Satan to\ncause men to forget God and to dishonor Him.\nThe triumphal procession approached the capital, following the\nsacred symbol of their invisible King. Then a burst of song de-\nmanded of the watchers upon the walls that the gates of the Holy\nCity should be thrown open:\n\u201cLift up your heads, O ye gates;\nAnd be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors;\nAnd the King of glory shall come in.\u201d\nA band of singers and players answered:\n\u201cWho is this King of glory?\u201d\n648 Patriarchs and Prophets\nFrom another company came the response:\n\u201cThe Lord strong and mighty,\nThe Lord mighty in battle.\u201d\nThen hundreds of voices, uniting, swelled the triumphal chorus:[708]\n\u201cLift up your heads, O ye gates;\nEven lift them up, ye everlasting doors;\nAnd the King of glory shall come in.\u201d\nAgain the joyful interrogation was heard, \u201cWho is this King of\nglory?\u201d And the voice of the great multitude, like \u201cthe sound of\nmany waters,\u201d was heard in the rapturous reply:\n\u201cThe Lord of hosts,\nHe is the King of glory.\u201d Psalm 24:7-10.\nThen the gates were opened wide, the procession entered, and\nwith reverent awe the ark was deposited in the tent that had been\nprepared for its reception. Before the sacred enclosure altars for\nsacrifice were erected; the smoke of peace offerings and burnt offer-\nings, and the clouds of incense, with the praises and supplications of\nIsrael, ascended to heaven. The service ended, the king himself pro-\nnounced a benediction upon his people. Then with regal bounty he\ncaused gifts of food and wine to be distributed for their refreshment.\nAll the tribes had been represented in this service, the celebration\nof the most sacred event that had yet marked the reign of David. The\nSpirit of divine inspiration had rested upon the king, and now as the\nlast beams of the setting sun bathed the tabernacle in a hallowed\nlight, his heart was uplifted in gratitude to God that the blessed\nsymbol of His presence was now so near the throne of Israel.\nThus musing, David turned toward his palace, \u201cto bless his\nhousehold.\u201d But there was one who had witnessed the scene of\nrejoicing with a spirit widely different from that which moved the\nheart of David. \u201cAs the ark of the Lord came into the city of David,\nMichal Saul\u2019s daughter looked through a window, and saw King\nDavid leaping and dancing before the Lord; and she despised him\nin her heart.\u201d In the bitterness of her passion she could not await\nReign of David 649\nDavid\u2019s return to the palace, but went out to meet him, and to his\nkindly greeting poured forth a torrent of bitter words. Keen and\ncutting was the irony of her speech:\n\u201cHow glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered\nhimself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of\nthe vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!\u201d\nDavid felt that it was the service of God which Michal had de- [709]\n[710]\n[711]\nspised and dishonored, and he sternly answered: \u201cIt was before the\nLord, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to\nappoint me ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel: therefore\nwill I play before the Lord. And I will yet be more vile than thus, and\nwill be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou\nhast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honor.\u201d To David\u2019s rebuke\nwas added that of the Lord: because of her pride and arrogance,\nMichal \u201chad no child unto the day of her death.\u201d\nThe solemn ceremonies attending the removal of the ark had\nmade a lasting impression upon the people of Israel, arousing a\ndeeper interest in the sanctuary service and kindling anew their zeal\nfor Jehovah. David endeavored by every means in his power to\ndeepen these impressions. The service of song was made a regular\npart of religious worship, and David composed psalms, not only for\nthe use of the priests in the sanctuary service, but also to be sung\nby the people in their journeys to the national altar at the annual\nfeasts. The influence thus exerted was far-reaching, and it resulted in\nfreeing the nation from idolatry. Many of the surrounding peoples,\nbeholding the prosperity of Israel, were led to think favorably of\nIsrael\u2019s God, who had done such great things for His people.\nThe tabernacle built by Moses, with all that appertained to the\nsanctuary service, except the ark, was still at Gibeah. It was David\u2019s\npurpose to make Jerusalem the religious center of the nation. He\nhad erected a palace for himself, and he felt that it was not fitting for\nthe ark of God to rest within a tent. He determined to build for it a\ntemple of such magnificence as should express Israel\u2019s appreciation\nof the honor granted the nation in the abiding presence of Jehovah\ntheir King. Communicating his purpose to the prophet Nathan, he\nreceived the encouraging response, \u201cDo all that is in thine heart; for\nthe Lord is with thee.\u201d\n650 Patriarchs and Prophets\nBut that same night the word of the Lord came to Nathan, giving\nhim a message for the king. David was to be deprived of the privilege\nof building a house for God, but he was granted an assurance of the\ndivine favor to him, to his posterity, and to the kingdom of Israel:\n\u201cThus saith Jehovah of hosts; I took thee from the sheepcote, from[712]\nfollowing the sheep, to be ruler over My people, over Israel; and I\nwas with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine\nenemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto\nthe name of the great men that are in the earth. Moreover I will\nappoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they\nmay dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall\nthe children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime.\u201d\nAs David had desired to build a house for God, the promise was\ngiven. \u201cThe Lord telleth thee that He will make thee a house.... I\nwill set up thy seed after thee.... He shall build a house for My name,\nand I will stablish the throne of his kingdom forever.\u201d\nThe reason why David was not to build the temple was declared:\n\u201cThou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou\nshalt not build a house unto My name.... Behold, a son shall be born\nto thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all\nhis enemies: ... his name shall be Solomon [peaceable], and I will\ngive peace and quietness unto Israel in his days. He shall build a\nhouse for My name.\u201d 1 Chronicles 22:8-10.\nThough the cherished purpose of his heart had been denied,\nDavid received the message with gratitude. \u201cWho am I, O Lord\nGod?\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cand what is my house, that Thou hast brought\nme hitherto? And this was yet a small thing in Thy sight, O Lord\nGod; but Thou hast spoken also of Thy servant\u2019s house for a great\nwhile to come;\u201d and he then renewed his covenant with God.\nDavid knew that it would be an honor to his name and would\nbring glory to his government to perform the work that he had\npurposed in his heart to do, but he was ready to submit his will to the\nwill of God. The grateful resignation thus manifested is rarely seen,\neven among Christians. How often do those who have passed the\nstrength of manhood cling to the hope of accomplishing some great\nwork upon which their hearts are set, but which they are unfitted to\nperform! God\u2019s providence may speak to them, as did His prophet\nto David, declaring that the work which they so much desire is not\nReign of David 651\ncommitted to them. It is theirs to prepare the way for another to\naccomplish it. But instead of gratefully submitting to the divine\ndirection, many fall back as if slighted and rejected, feeling that if [713]\nthey cannot do the one thing which they desire to do, they will do\nnothing. Many cling with desperate energy to responsibilities which\nthey are incapable of bearing, and vainly endeavor to accomplish a\nwork for which they are insufficient, while that which they might\ndo, lies neglected. And because of this lack of co-operation on their\npart the greater work is hindered or frustrated.\nDavid, in his covenant with Jonathan, had promised that when\nhe should have rest from his enemies he would show kindness to the\nhouse of Saul. In his prosperity, mindful of this covenant, the king\nmade inquiry, \u201cIs there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I\nmay show him kindness for Jonathan\u2019s sake?\u201d He was told of a son\nof Jonathan, Mephibosheth, who had been lame from childhood. At\nthe time of Saul\u2019s defeat by the Philistines at Jezreel, the nurse of\nthis child, attempting to flee with him, had let him fall, thus making\nhim a lifelong cripple. David now summoned the young man to\ncourt and received him with great kindness. The private possessions\nof Saul were restored to him for the support of his household; but\nthe son of Jonathan was himself to be the constant guest of the king,\nsitting daily at the royal table. Through reports from the enemies\nof David, Mephibosheth had been led to cherish a strong prejudice\nagainst him as a usurper; but the monarch\u2019s generous and courteous\nreception of him and his continued kindness won the heart of the\nyoung man; he became strongly attached to David, and, like his\nfather Jonathan, he felt that his interest was one with that of the king\nwhom God had chosen.\nAfter David\u2019s establishment upon the throne of Israel the nation\nenjoyed a long interval of peace. The surrounding peoples, seeing the\nstrength and unity of the kingdom, soon thought it prudent to desist\nfrom open hostilities; and David, occupied with the organization and\nupbuilding of his kingdom, refrained from aggressive war. At last,\nhowever, he made war upon Israel\u2019s old enemies, the Philistines, and\nupon the Moabites, and succeeded in overcoming both and making\nthem tributary.\nThen there was formed against the kingdom of David a vast\ncoalition of the surrounding nations, out of which grew the greatest\n652 Patriarchs and Prophets\nwars and victories of his reign and the most extensive accessions to\nhis power. This hostile alliance, which really sprang from jealousy\nof David\u2019s increasing power, had been wholly unprovoked by him.[714]\nThe circumstances that led to its rise were these:\nTidings were received at Jerusalem announcing the death of Na-\nhash, king of the Ammonites\u2014a monarch who had shown kindness\nto David when he was a fugitive from the rage of Saul. Now, desiring\nto express his grateful appreciation of the favor shown him in his\ndistress, David sent ambassadors with a message of sympathy to\nHanun, the son and successor of the Ammonite king. \u201cSaid David,\nI will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father\nshowed kindness unto me.\u201d\nBut his courteous act was misinterpreted. The Ammonites hated\nthe true God and were the bitter enemies of Israel. The apparent\nkindness of Nahash to David had been prompted wholly by hostility\nto Saul as king of Israel. The message of David was misconstrued\nby Hanun\u2019s counselors. They \u201csaid unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest\nthou that David doth honor thy father, that he hath sent comforters\nunto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to\nsearch the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?\u201d It was by\nthe advice of his counselors that Nahash, half a century before,\nhad been led to make the cruel condition required of the people of\nJabesh-gilead, when, besieged by the Ammonites, they sued for a\ncovenant of peace. Nahash had demanded the privilege of thrusting\nout all their right eyes. The Ammonites still vividly remembered\nhow the king of Israel had foiled their cruel design, and had rescued\nthe people whom they would have humbled and mutilated. The same\nhatred of Israel still prompted them. They could have no conception\nof the generous spirit that had inspired David\u2019s message. When\nSatan controls the minds of men he will excite envy and suspicion\nwhich will misconstrue the very best intentions. Listening to his\ncounselors, Hanun regarded David\u2019s messengers as spies, and loaded\nthem with scorn and insult.\nThe Ammonites had been permitted to carry out the evil purposes\nof their hearts without restraint, that their real character might be\nrevealed to David. It was not God\u2019s will that Israel should enter into\na league with this treacherous heathen people.\nReign of David 653\nIn ancient times, as now, the office of ambassador was held sa-\ncred. By the universal law of nations it ensured protection from\npersonal violence or insult. The ambassador standing as a repre-\nsentative of his sovereign, any indignity offered to him demanded\nprompt retaliation. The Ammonites, knowing that the insult offered [715]\nto Israel would surely be avenged, made preparation for war. \u201cWhen\nthe children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious\nto David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents\nof silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia,\nand out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah. So they hired thirty\nand two thousand chariots.... And the children of Ammon gath-\nered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.\u201d 1\nChronicles 19:6, 7.\nIt was indeed a formidable alliance. The inhabitants of the region\nlying between the river Euphrates and the Mediterranean Sea had\nleagued with the Ammonites. The north and east of Canaan was\nencircled with armed foes, banded together to crush the kingdom of\nIsrael.\nThe Hebrews did not wait for the invasion of their country. Their\nforces, under Joab, crossed the Jordan and advanced toward the\nAmmonite capital. As the Hebrew captain led his army to the field\nhe sought to inspire them for the conflict, saying, \u201cBe of good\ncourage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and\nfor the cities of our God: and let the Lord do that which is good in\nHis sight.\u201d 1 Chronicles 19:13. The united forces of the allies were\novercome in the first engagement. But they were not yet willing to\ngive over the contest, and the next year renewed the war. The king of\nSyria gathered his forces, threatening Israel with an immense army.\nDavid, realizing how much dependent upon the result of this contest,\ntook the field in person, and by the blessing of God inflicted upon\nthe allies a defeat so disastrous that the Syrians, from Lebanon to the\nEuphrates, not only gave up the war, but became tributary to Israel.\nAgainst the Ammonites David pushed the war with vigor, until their\nstrongholds fell and the whole region came under the dominion of\nIsrael.\nThe dangers which had threatened the nation with utter destruc-\ntion proved, through the providence of God, to be the very means\n654 Patriarchs and Prophets\nby which it rose to unprecedented greatness. In commemorating his\nremarkable deliverances, David sings:\n\u201cThe Lord liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the\nGod of my salvation:\nEven the God that executeth vengeance for me, and subdueth\npeoples under me.\nHe rescueth me from mine enemies: [716]\nYea, Thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me:\nThou deliverest me from the violent man.\nTherefore I will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, among the\nnations,\nAnd will sing praises unto Thy name.\nGreat deliverance giveth He to His king;\nAnd sheweth loving-kindness to His anointed,\nTo David and to his seed, forevermore.\u201d\nPsalm 18:46-50, R.V .\nAnd throughout the songs of David the thought was impressed\non his people that Jehovah was their strength and deliverer:\n\u201cThere is no king saved by the multitude of a host:\nA mighty man is not delivered by much strength.\nA horse is a vain thing for safety:\nNeither shall he deliver any by his great strength.\u201d\nPsalm 33:16, 17.\n\u201cThou art my King, O God:\nCommand deliverances for Jacob.\nThrough Thee will we push down our enemies:\nThrough Thy name will we tread them under that rise up\nagainst us.\nFor I will not trust in my bow,\nNeither shall my sword save me.\nBut Thou hast saved us from our enemies,\nAnd hast put them to shame that hated us.\u201d Psalm 44:4-7.\nReign of David 655\n\u201cSome trust in chariots, and some in horses:\nBut we will remember the name of Jehovah our God.\u201d\nPsalm 20:7.\nThe kingdom of Israel had now reached in extent the fulfillment\nof the promise given to Abraham, and afterward repeated to Moses:\n\u201cUnto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the\ngreat river, the river Euphrates.\u201d Genesis 15:18. Israel had become a\nmighty nation, respected and feared by surrounding peoples. In his\nown realm David\u2019s power had become very great. He commanded, as\nfew sovereigns in any age have been able to command, the affections\nand allegiance of his people. He had honored God, and God was\nnow honoring him.\nBut in the midst of prosperity lurked danger. In the time of his\ngreatest outward triumph David was in the greatest peril, and met\nhis most humiliating defeat.\nChapter 71\u2014David\u2019s Sin and Repentance[717]\nThis chapter is based on 2 Samuel 11; 12.\nThe Bible has little to say in praise of men. Little space is given\nto recounting the virtues of even the best men who have ever lived.\nThis silence is not without purpose; it is not without a lesson. All\nthe good qualities that men possess are the gift of God; their good\ndeeds are performed by the grace of God through Christ. Since they\nowe all to God the glory of whatever they are or do belongs to Him\nalone; they are but instruments in His hands. More than this\u2014as all\nthe lessons of Bible history teach\u2014it is a perilous thing to praise or\nexalt men; for if one comes to lose sight of his entire dependence\non God, and to trust to his own strength, he is sure to fall. Man is\ncontending with foes who are stronger than he. \u201cWe wrestle not\nagainst flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,\nagainst the rulers of the darkness of this world, against wicked spirits\nin high places.\u201d Ephesians 6:12, margin. It is impossible for us in our\nown strength to maintain the conflict; and whatever diverts the mind\nfrom God, whatever leads to self-exaltation or to self-dependence, is\nsurely preparing the way for our overthrow. The tenor of the Bible is\nto inculcate distrust of human power and to encourage trust in divine\npower.\nIt was the spirit of self-confidence and self-exaltation that pre-\npared the way for David\u2019s fall. Flattery and the subtle allurements of\npower and luxury were not without effect upon him. Intercourse with\nsurrounding nations also exerted an influence for evil. According\nto the customs prevailing among Eastern rulers, crimes not to be\ntolerated in subjects were uncondemned in the king; the monarch\nwas not under obligation to exercise the same self-restraint as the\nsubject. All this tended to lessen David\u2019s sense of the exceeding\nsinfulness of sin. And instead of relying in humility upon the power\nof Jehovah, he began to trust to his own wisdom and might. As soon\nas Satan can separate the soul from God, the only Source of strength,[718]\n656\nDavid\u2019s Sin and Repentance 657\nhe will seek to arouse the unholy desires of man\u2019s carnal nature. The\nwork of the enemy is not abrupt; it is not, at the outset, sudden and\nstartling; it is a secret undermining of the strongholds of principle.\nIt begins in apparently small things\u2014the neglect to be true to God\nand to rely upon Him wholly, the disposition to follow the customs\nand practices of the world.\nBefore the conclusion of the war with the Ammonites, David,\nleaving the conduct of the army to Joab, returned to Jerusalem. The\nSyrians had already submitted to Israel, and the complete overthrow\nof the Ammonites appeared certain. David was surrounded by the\nfruits of victory and the honors of his wise and able rule. It was\nnow, while he was at ease and unguarded, that the tempter seized\nthe opportunity to occupy his mind. The fact that God had taken\nDavid into so close connection with Himself and had manifested\nso great favor toward him, should have been to him the strongest\nof incentives to preserve his character unblemished. But when in\nease and self-security he let go his hold upon God, David yielded to\nSatan and brought upon his soul the stain of guilt. He, the Heaven-\nappointed leader of the nation, chosen by God to execute His law,\nhimself trampled upon its precepts. He who should have been a\nterror to evildoers, by his own act strengthened their hands.\nAmid the perils of his earlier life David in conscious integrity\ncould trust his case with God. The Lord\u2019s hand had guided him\nsafely past the unnumbered snares that had been laid for his feet.\nBut now, guilty and unrepentant, he did not ask help and guidance\nfrom Heaven, but sought to extricate himself from the dangers in\nwhich sin had involved him. Bathsheba, whose fatal beauty had\nproved a snare to the king, was the wife of Uriah the Hittite, one of\nDavid\u2019s bravest and most faithful officers. None could foresee what\nwould be the result should the crime become known. The law of\nGod pronounced the adulterer guilty of death, and the proud-spirited\nsoldier, so shamefully wronged, might avenge himself by taking the\nlife of the king or by exciting the nation to revolt.\nEvery effort which David made to conceal his guilt proved un-\navailing. He had betrayed himself into the power of Satan; danger\nsurrounded him, dishonor more bitter than death was before him. [719]\nThere appeared but one way of escape, and in his desperation he was\nhurried on to add murder to adultery. He who had compassed the\n658 Patriarchs and Prophets\ndestruction of Saul was seeking to lead David also to ruin. Though\nthe temptations were different, they were alike in leading to trans-\ngression of God\u2019s law. David reasoned that if Uriah were slain by the\nhand of enemies in battle, the guilt of his death could not be traced\nhome to the king, Bathsheba would be free to become David\u2019s wife,\nsuspicion could be averted, and the royal honor would be maintained.\nUriah was made the bearer of his own death warrant. A letter\nsent by his hand to Joab from the king commanded, \u201cSet ye Uriah\nin the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he\nmay be smitten, and die.\u201d Joab, already stained with the guilt of one\nwanton murder, did not hesitate to obey the king\u2019s instructions, and\nUriah fell by the sword of the children of Ammon.\nHeretofore David\u2019s record as a ruler had been such as few monar-\nchs have ever equaled. It is written of him that he \u201cexecuted judg-\nment and justice unto all his people.\u201d 2 Samuel 8:15. His integrity\nhad won the confidence and fealty of the nation. But as he departed\nfrom God and yielded himself to the wicked one, he became for the\ntime the agent of Satan; yet he still held the position and authority\nthat God had given him, and because of this, claimed obedience\nthat would imperil the soul of him who should yield it. And Joab,\nwhose allegiance had been given to the king rather than to God,\ntransgressed God\u2019s law because the king commanded it.\nDavid\u2019s power had been given him by God, but to be exercised\nonly in harmony with the divine law. When he commanded that\nwhich was contrary to God\u2019s law, it became sin to obey. \u201cThe\npowers that be are ordained of God\u201d (Romans 13:1), but we are\nnot to obey them contrary to God\u2019s law. The apostle Paul, writing\nto the Corinthians, sets forth the principle by which we should be\ngoverned. He says, \u201cBe ye followers of me, even as I also am of\nChrist.\u201d 1 Corinthians 11:1.\nAn account of the execution of his order was sent to David, but\nso carefully worded as not to implicate either Joab or the king. Joab\n\u201ccharged the messenger saying, When thou hast made an end of\ntelling the matters of the war unto the king, and if so be that the[720]\nking\u2019s wrath arise, ... then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is\ndead also. So the messenger went, and came and showed David all\nthat Joab had sent him for.\u201d\nDavid\u2019s Sin and Repentance 659\nThe king\u2019s answer was, \u201cThus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not\nthis thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as\nanother: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow\nit: and encourage thou him.\u201d\nBathsheba observed the customary days of mourning for her\nhusband; and at their close \u201cDavid sent and fetched her to his house,\nand she became his wife.\u201d He whose tender conscience and high\nsense of honor would not permit him, even when in peril of his life,\nto put forth his hand against the Lord\u2019s anointed, had so fallen that\nhe could wrong and murder one of his most faithful and most valiant\nsoldiers, and hope to enjoy undisturbed the reward of his sin. Alas!\nhow had the fine gold become dim! how had the most fine gold\nchanged!\nFrom the beginning Satan has portrayed to men the gains to be\nwon by transgression. Thus he seduced angels. Thus he tempted\nAdam and Eve to sin. And thus he is still leading multitudes away\nfrom obedience to God. The path of transgression is made to appear\ndesirable; \u201cbut the end thereof are the ways of death.\u201d Proverbs\n14:12. Happy they who, having ventured in this way, learn how\nbitter are the fruits of sin, and turn from it betimes. God in His\nmercy did not leave David to be lured to utter ruin by the deceitful\nrewards of sin.\nFor the sake of Israel also there was a necessity for God to\ninterpose. As time passed on, David\u2019s sin toward Bathsheba became\nknown, and suspicion was excited that he had planned the death\nof Uriah. The Lord was dishonored. He had favored and exalted\nDavid, and David\u2019s sin misrepresented the character of God and\ncast reproach upon His name. It tended to lower the standard of\ngodliness in Israel, to lessen in many minds the abhorrence of sin;\nwhile those who did not love and fear God were by it emboldened\nin transgression.\nNathan the prophet was bidden to bear a message of reproof to\nDavid. It was a message terrible in its severity. To few sovereigns\ncould such a reproof be given but at the price of certain death to the\nreprover. Nathan delivered the divine sentence unflinchingly, yet\nwith such heaven-born wisdom as to engage the sympathies of the [721]\nking, to arouse his conscience, and to call from his lips the sentence\nof death upon himself. Appealing to David as the divinely appointed\n660 Patriarchs and Prophets\nguardian of his people\u2019s rights, the prophet repeated a story of wrong\nand oppression that demanded redress.\n\u201cThere were two men in one city,\u201d he said, \u201cthe one rich, and\nthe other poor. The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:\nbut the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he\nhad bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and\nwith his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own\ncup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. And\nthere came a traveler unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his\nown flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that\nwas come unto him; but took the poor man\u2019s lamb, and dressed it\nfor the man that was come to him.\u201d\nThe anger of the king was roused, and he exclaimed, \u201cAs the\nLord liveth, the man that hath done this thing is worthy to die. And\nhe shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and\nbecause he had no pity.\u201d 2 Samuel 12:5, 6, margin.\nNathan fixed his eyes upon the king; then, lifting his right hand\nto heaven, he solemnly declared, \u201cThou art the man.\u201d \u201cWherefore,\u201d\nhe continued, \u201chast thou despised the commandment of the Lord, to\ndo evil in His sight?\u201d The guilty may attempt, as David had done,\nto conceal their crime from men; they may seek to bury the evil\ndeed forever from human sight or knowledge; but \u201call things are\nnaked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.\u201d\nHebrews 4:13. \u201cThere is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed;\nand hid, that shall not be known.\u201d Matthew 10:26.\nNathan declared: \u201cThus saith the Lord God of Israel, I anointed\nthee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul....\nWherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord, to do\nevil in His sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword,\nand hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the\nsword of the children of Ammon. Now therefore the sword shall\nnever depart from thine house.... Behold, I will raise up evil against\nthee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine\neyes, and give them unto thy neighbor.... For thou didst it secretly;\nbut I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.\u201d\nThe prophet\u2019s rebuke touched the heart of David; conscience was[722]\naroused; his guilt appeared in all its enormity. His soul was bowed\nin penitence before God. With trembling lips he said, \u201cI have sinned\nDavid\u2019s Sin and Repentance 661\nagainst the Lord.\u201d All wrong done to others reaches back from the\ninjured one to God. David had committed a grievous sin, toward\nboth Uriah and Bathsheba, and he keenly felt this. But infinitely\ngreater was his sin against God.\nThough there would be found none in Israel to execute the sen-\ntence of death upon the anointed of the Lord, David trembled, lest,\nguilty and unforgiven, he should be cut down by the swift judgment\nof God. But the message was sent him by the prophet, \u201cThe Lord\nalso hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.\u201d Yet justice must be\nmaintained. The sentence of death was transferred from David to\nthe child of his sin. Thus the king was given opportunity for repen-\ntance; while to him the suffering and death of the child, as a part of\nhis punishment, was far more bitter than his own death could have\nbeen. The prophet said, \u201cBecause by this deed thou hast given great\noccasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also that\nis born unto thee shall surely die.\u201d\nWhen his child was stricken, David, with fasting and deep hu-\nmiliation, pleaded for its life. He put off his royal robes, he laid\naside his crown, and night after night he lay upon the earth, in heart-\nbroken grief interceding for the innocent one suffering for his guilt.\n\u201cThe elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up\nfrom the earth: but he would not.\u201d Often when judgments had been\npronounced upon persons or cities, humiliation and repentance had\nturned aside the blow, and the Ever-Merciful, swift to pardon, had\nsent messengers of peace. Encouraged by this thought, David per-\nsevered in his supplication so long as the child was spared. Upon\nlearning that it was dead, he quietly submitted to the decree of God.\nThe first stroke had fallen of that retribution which he himself had\ndeclared just; but David, trusting in God\u2019s mercy, was not without\ncomfort.\nVery many, reading the history of David\u2019s fall, have inquired,\n\u201cWhy has this record been made public? Why did God see fit to\nthrow open to the world this dark passage in the life of one so highly\nhonored of Heaven?\u201d The prophet, in his reproof to David, had\ndeclared concerning his sin, \u201cBy this deed thou hast given great\noccasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme.\u201d Through suc-\ncessive generations infidels have pointed to the character of David, [723]\nbearing this dark stain, and have exclaimed in triumph and derision,\n662 Patriarchs and Prophets\n\u201cThis is the man after God\u2019s own heart!\u201d Thus a reproach has been\nbrought upon religion, God and His word have been blasphemed,\nsouls have been hardened in unbelief, and many, under a cloak of\npiety, have become bold in sin.\nBut the history of David furnishes no countenance to sin. It was\nwhen he was walking in the counsel of God that he was called a man\nafter God\u2019s own heart. When he sinned, this ceased to be true of him\nuntil by repentance he had returned to the Lord. The word of God\nplainly declares, \u201cThe thing that David had done was evil in the eyes\nof the Lord.\u201d 2 Samuel 11:27, margin. And the Lord said to David\nby the prophet, \u201cWherefore hast thou despised the commandment\nof the Lord, to do evil in His sight? ... Now therefore the sword\nshall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised Me.\u201d\nThough David repented of his sin and was forgiven and accepted by\nthe Lord, he reaped the baleful harvest of the seed he himself had\nsown. The judgments upon him and upon his house testify to God\u2019s\nabhorrence of the sin.\nHeretofore God\u2019s providence had preserved David against all the\nplottings of his enemies, and had been directly exercised to restrain\nSaul. But David\u2019s transgression had changed his relation to God.\nThe Lord could not in any wise sanction iniquity. He could not\nexercise His power to protect David from the results of his sin as He\nhad protected him from the enmity of Saul.\nThere was a great change in David himself. He was broken in\nspirit by the consciousness of his sin and its far-reaching results. He\nfelt humbled in the eyes of his subjects. His influence was weak-\nened. Hitherto his prosperity had been attributed to his conscientious\nobedience to the commandments of the Lord. But now his subjects,\nhaving a knowledge of his sin, would be led to sin more freely. His\nauthority in his own household, his claim to respect and obedience\nfrom his sons, was weakened. A sense of his guilt kept him silent\nwhen he should have condemned sin; it made his arm feeble to\nexecute justice in his house. His evil example exerted its influence\nupon his sons, and God would not interpose to prevent the result.\nHe would permit things to take their natural course, and thus David\nwas severely chastised.\nFor a whole year after his fall David lived in apparent security;\nthere was no outward evidence of God\u2019s displeasure. But the divine[724]\nDavid\u2019s Sin and Repentance 663\nsentence was hanging over him. Swiftly and surely a day of judgment\nand retribution was approaching, which no repentance could avert,\nagony and shame that would darken his whole earthly life. Those\nwho, by pointing to the example of David, try to lessen the guilt of\ntheir own sins, should learn from the Bible record that the way of\ntransgression is hard. Though like David they should turn from their\nevil course, the results of sin, even in this life, will be found bitter\nand hard to bear.\nGod intended the history of David\u2019s fall to serve as a warning\nthat even those whom He has greatly blessed and favored are not\nto feel secure and neglect watchfulness and prayer. And thus it has\nproved to those who in humility have sought to learn the lesson that\nGod designed to teach. From generation to generation thousands\nhave thus been led to realize their own danger from the tempter\u2019s\npower. The fall of David, one so greatly honored by the Lord, has\nawakened in them distrust of self. They have felt that God alone\ncould keep them by His power through faith. Knowing that in Him\nwas their strength and safety, they have feared to take the first step\non Satan\u2019s ground.\nEven before the divine sentence was pronounced against David\nhe had begun to reap the fruit of transgression. His conscience was\nnot at rest. The agony of spirit which he then endured is brought to\nview in the thirty-second psalm. He says:\n\u201cBlessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is\ncovered.\nBlessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity,\nAnd in whose spirit there is no guile.\nWhen I kept silence, my bones waxed old\nThrough my roaring all the day long.\nFor day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me:\nMy moisture was changed as with the drought of summer.\u201d\nPsalm 32:1-4, R.V .\nAnd the fifty-first psalm is an expression of David\u2019s repentance,\nwhen the message of reproof came to him from God:\n\u201cHave mercy upon me, O God, according to Thy loving-kind-\nness:\n664 Patriarchs and Prophets\nAccording unto the multitude of Thy tender mercies blot out\nmy transgressions.\nWash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from[725]\nmy sin.\nFor I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever\nbefore\nme....\nPurge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I\nshall be whiter than snow.\nMake me to hear joy and gladness;\nThat the bones which Thou hast broken may rejoice.\nHide Thy face from my sins,\nAnd blot out all mine iniquities.\nCreate in me a clean heart, O God;\nAnd renew a right spirit within me.\nCast me not away from Thy presence;\nAnd take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.\nRestore unto me the joy of Thy salvation;\nAnd uphold me with Thy free Spirit.\nThen will I teach transgressors Thy ways;\nAnd sinners shall be converted unto Thee.\nDeliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou God of my\nsalvation:\nAnd my tongue shall sing aloud of Thy righteousness.\u201d\nPsalm 51:1-14.\nThus in a sacred song to be sung in the public assemblies of his\npeople, in the presence of the court\u2014priests and judges, princes and\nmen of war\u2014and which would preserve to the latest generation the\nknowledge of his fall, the king of Israel recounted his sin, his repen-\ntance, and his hope of pardon through the mercy of God. Instead\nof endeavoring to conceal his guilt he desired that others might be\ninstructed by the sad history of his fall.\nDavid\u2019s repentance was sincere and deep. There was no effort\nto palliate his crime. No desire to escape the judgments threatened,\ninspired his prayer. But he saw the enormity of his transgression\nagainst God; he saw the defilement of his soul; he loathed his sin. It\nwas not for pardon only that he prayed, but for purity of heart. David\nDavid\u2019s Sin and Repentance 665\ndid not in despair give over the struggle. In the promises of God to\nrepentant sinners he saw the evidence of his pardon and acceptance.\n\u201cFor Thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it:\nThou delightest not in burnt offering.\nThe sacrifices of God are a broken spirit:\nA broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.\u201d\nPsalm 51:16, 17.\nThough David had fallen, the Lord lifted him up. He was now [726]\nmore fully in harmony with God and in sympathy with his fellow\nmen than before he fell. In the joy of his release he sang:\n\u201cI acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I\nnot hid.\nI said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord;\nAnd Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin....\nThou art my hiding place; Thou shalt preserve me from\ntrouble;\nThou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.\u201d\nPsalm 32:5-7.\nMany have murmured at what they called God\u2019s injustice in\nsparing David, whose guilt was so great, after having rejected Saul\nfor what appear to them to be far less flagrant sins. But David\nhumbled himself and confessed his sin, while Saul despised reproof\nand hardened his heart in impenitence.\nThis passage in David\u2019s history is full of significance to the\nrepenting sinner. It is one of the most forcible illustrations given\nus of the struggles and temptations of humanity, and of genuine\nrepentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. Through\nall the ages it has proved a source of encouragement to souls that,\nhaving fallen into sin, were struggling under the burden of their\nguilt. Thousands of the children of God, who have been betrayed\ninto sin, when ready to give up to despair have remembered how\nDavid\u2019s sincere repentance and confession were accepted by God,\nnotwithstanding he suffered for his transgression; and they also have\n666 Patriarchs and Prophets\ntaken courage to repent and try again to walk in the way of God\u2019s\ncommandments.\nWhoever under the reproof of God will humble the soul with\nconfession and repentance, as did David, may be sure that there is\nhope for him. Whoever will in faith accept God\u2019s promises, will find\npardon. The Lord will never cast away one truly repentant soul. He\nhas given this promise: \u201cLet him take hold of My strength, that he\nmay make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.\u201d Isaiah\n27:5. \u201cLet the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his\nthoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy\nupon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.\u201d Isaiah\n55:7.\nChapter 72\u2014The Rebellion of Absalom [727]\nThis chapter is based on 2 Samuel 13-19.\n\u201cHe shall restore fourfold,\u201d had been David\u2019s unwitting sentence\nupon himself, on listening to the prophet Nathan\u2019s parable; and\naccording to his own sentence he was to be judged. Four of his sons\nmust fall, and the loss of each would be a result of the father\u2019s sin.\nThe shameful crime of Amnon, the first-born, was permitted by\nDavid to pass unpunished and unrebuked. The law pronounced death\nupon the adulterer, and the unnatural crime of Amnon made him\ndoubly guilty. But David, self-condemned for his own sin, failed to\nbring the offender to justice. For two full years Absalom, the natural\nprotector of the sister so foully wronged, concealed his purpose of\nrevenge, but only to strike more surely at the last. At a feast of\nthe king\u2019s sons the drunken, incestuous Amnon was slain by his\nbrother\u2019s command.\nTwofold judgment had been meted out to David. The terrible\nmessage was carried to him, \u201cAbsalom hath slain all the king\u2019s sons,\nand there is not one of them left. Then the king arose, and tare his\ngarments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with\ntheir clothes rent.\u201d The king\u2019s sons, returning in alarm to Jerusalem,\nrevealed to their father the truth; Amnon alone had been slain; and\nthey \u201clifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his\nservants wept very sore.\u201d But Absalom fled to Talmai, the king of\nGeshur, his mother\u2019s father.\nLike other sons of David, Amnon had been left to selfish indul-\ngence. He had sought to gratify every thought of his heart, regardless\nof the requirements of God. Notwithstanding his great sin, God had\nborne long with him. For two years he had been granted opportu-\nnity for repentance; but he continued in sin, and with his guilt upon\nhim, he was cut down by death, to await the awful tribunal of the\njudgment.\nDavid had neglected the duty of punishing the crime of Amnon, [728]\n667\n668 Patriarchs and Prophets\nand because of the unfaithfulness of the king and father and the\nimpenitence of the son, the Lord permitted events to take their\nnatural course, and did not restrain Absalom. When parents or rulers\nneglect the duty of punishing iniquity, God Himself will take the\ncase in hand. His restraining power will be in a measure removed\nfrom the agencies of evil, so that a train of circumstances will arise\nwhich will punish sin with sin.\nThe evil results of David\u2019s unjust indulgence toward Amnon\nwere not ended, for it was here that Absalom\u2019s alienation from his\nfather began. After he fled to Geshur, David, feeling that the crime\nof his son demanded some punishment, refused him permission to\nreturn. And this had a tendency to increase rather than to lessen\nthe inextricable evils in which the king had come to be involved.\nAbsalom, energetic, ambitious, and unprincipled, shut out by his\nexile from participation in the affairs of the kingdom, soon gave\nhimself up to dangerous scheming.\nAt the close of two years Joab determined to effect a reconcili-\nation between the father and his son. And with this object in view\nhe secured the services of a woman of Tekoah, reputed for wisdom.\nInstructed by Joab, the woman represented herself to David as a\nwidow whose two sons had been her only comfort and support. In\na quarrel one of these had slain the other, and now all the relatives\nof the family demanded that the survivor should be given up to the\navenger of blood. \u201cAnd so,\u201d said the mother, \u201cthey shall quench my\ncoal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name\nnor remainder upon the earth.\u201d The king\u2019s feelings were touched by\nthis appeal, and he assured the woman of the royal protection for\nher son.\nAfter drawing from him repeated promises for the young man\u2019s\nsafety, she entreated the king\u2019s forbearance, declaring that he had\nspoken as one at fault, in that he did not fetch home again his\nbanished. \u201cFor,\u201d she said, \u201cwe must needs die, and are as water spilt\non the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God\nrespect any person; yet doth He devise means, that His banished be\nnot expelled from Him.\u201d This tender and touching portrayal of the\nlove of God toward the sinner\u2014coming as it did from Joab, the rude\nsoldier\u2014is a striking evidence of the familiarity of the Israelites\nwith the great truths of redemption. The king, feeling his own need\nRebellion of Absalom 669\nof God\u2019s mercy, could not resist this appeal. To Joab the command [729]\nwas given, \u201cGo therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.\u201d\nAbsalom was permitted to return to Jerusalem, but not to appear\nat court or to meet his father. David had begun to see the evil effects\nof his indulgence toward his children; and tenderly as he loved\nthis beautiful and gifted son, he felt it necessary, as a lesson both\nto Absalom and to the people, that abhorrence for such a crime\nshould be manifested. Absalom lived two years in his own house,\nbut banished from the court. His sister dwelt with him, and her\npresence kept alive the memory of the irreparable wrong she had\nsuffered. In the popular estimation the prince was a hero rather than\nan offender. And having this advantage, he set himself to gain the\nhearts of the people. His personal appearance was such as to win\nthe admiration of all beholders. \u201cIn all Israel there was none to be\nso much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his\nfoot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.\u201d It\nwas not wise for the king to leave a man of Absalom\u2019s character\u2014\nambitious, impulsive, and passionate\u2014to brood for two years over\nsupposed grievances. And David\u2019s action in permitting him to return\nto Jerusalem, and yet refusing to admit him to his presence, enlisted\nin his behalf the sympathies of the people.\nWith the memory ever before him of his own transgression of\nthe law of God, David seemed morally paralyzed; he was weak and\nirresolute, when before his sin he had been courageous and decided.\nHis influence with the people had been weakened. And all this\nfavored the designs of his unnatural son.\nThrough the influence of Joab, Absalom was again admitted to\nhis father\u2019s presence; but though there was an outward reconciliation,\nhe continued his ambitious scheming. He now assumed an almost\nroyal state, having chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before\nhim. And while the king was more and more inclined to desire\nretirement and solitude, Absalom sedulously courted the popular\nfavor.\nThe influence of David\u2019s listlessness and irresolution extended to\nhis subordinates; negligence and delay characterized the administra-\ntion of justice. Absalom artfully turned every cause of dissatisfaction\nto his own advantage. Day by day this man of noble mien might be\nseen at the gate of the city, where a crowd of suppliants waited to\n670 Patriarchs and Prophets\npresent their wrongs for redress. Absalom mingled with them and[730]\nlistened to their grievances, expressing sympathy with their suffer-\nings and regret at the inefficiency of the government. Having thus\nlistened to the story of a man of Israel, the prince would reply, \u201cThy\nmatters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king\nto hear thee;\u201d adding, \u201cO that I were made judge in the land, that\nevery man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I\nwould do him justice! And it was so, that when any man came nigh\nto him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and\nkissed him.\u201d\nFomented by the artful insinuations of the prince, discontent\nwith the government was fast spreading. The praise of Absalom was\non the lips of all. He was generally regarded as heir to the kingdom;\nthe people looked upon him with pride as worthy of this high station,\nand a desire was kindled that he might occupy the throne. \u201cSo\nAbsalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.\u201d Yet the king, blinded\nby affection for his son, suspected nothing. The princely state which\nAbsalom had assumed, was regarded by David as intended to do\nhonor to his court\u2014as an expression of joy at the reconciliation.\nThe minds of the people being prepared for what was to follow,\nAbsalom secretly sent picked men throughout the tribes, to concert\nmeasures for a revolt. And now the cloak of religious devotion was\nassumed to conceal his traitorous designs. A vow made long before\nwhile he was in exile must be paid in Hebron. Absalom said to the\nking, \u201cI pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed\nunto the Lord, in Hebron. For thy servant vowed a vow while I\nabode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the Lord shall bring me again\nindeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the Lord.\u201d The fond father,\ncomforted with this evidence of piety in his son, dismissed him with\nhis blessing. The conspiracy was now fully matured. Absalom\u2019s\ncrowning act of hypocrisy was designed not only to blind the king\nbut to establish the confidence of the people, and thus to lead them\non to rebellion against the king whom God had chosen.\nAbsalom set forth for Hebron, and there went with him \u201ctwo\nhundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in\ntheir simplicity, and they knew not anything.\u201d These men went with\nAbsalom, little thinking that their love for the son was leading them\ninto rebellion against the father. Upon arriving at Hebron, Absalom\nRebellion of Absalom 671\nimmediately summoned Ahithophel, one of the chief counselors of [731]\nDavid, a man in high repute for wisdom, whose opinion was thought\nto be as safe and wise as that of an oracle. Ahithophel joined the\nconspirators, and his support made the cause of Absalom appear\ncertain of success, attracting to his standard many influential men\nfrom all parts of the land. As the trumpet of revolt was sounded,\nthe prince\u2019s spies throughout the country spread the tidings that\nAbsalom was king, and many of the people gathered to him.\nMeanwhile the alarm was carried to Jerusalem, to the king.\nDavid was suddenly aroused, to see rebellion breaking out close\nbeside his throne. His own son\u2014the son whom he had loved and\ntrusted\u2014had been planning to seize his crown and doubtless to take\nhis life. In his great peril David shook off the depression that had\nso long rested upon him, and with the spirit of his earlier years he\nprepared to meet this terrible emergency. Absalom was mustering\nhis forces at Hebron, only twenty miles away. The rebels would\nsoon be at the gates of Jerusalem.\nFrom his palace David looked out upon his capital\u2014\u201cbeautiful\nfor situation, the joy of the whole earth, ... the city of the great\nKing.\u201d Psalm 48:2. He shuddered at the thought of exposing it to\ncarnage and devastation. Should he call to his help the subjects still\nloyal to his throne, and make a stand to hold his capital? Should he\npermit Jerusalem to be deluged with blood? His decision was taken.\nThe horrors of war should not fall upon the chosen city. He would\nleave Jerusalem, and then test the fidelity of his people, giving them\nan opportunity to rally to his support. In this great crisis it was his\nduty to God and to his people to maintain the authority with which\nHeaven had invested him. The issue of the conflict he would trust\nwith God.\nIn humility and sorrow David passed out of the gate of\nJerusalem\u2014driven from his throne, from his palace, from the ark of\nGod, by the insurrection of his cherished son. The people followed\nin long, sad procession, like a funeral train. David\u2019s bodyguard of\nCherethites, Pelethites, and six hundred Gittites from Gath, under\nthe command of Ittai, accompanied the king. But David, with char-\nacteristic unselfishness, could not consent that these strangers who\nhad sought his protection should be involved in his calamity. He\nexpressed surprise that they should be ready to make this sacrifice\n672 Patriarchs and Prophets\nfor him. Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, \u201cWherefore goest\nthou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king:[732]\nfor thou art a stranger, and also an exile. Whereas thou camest but\nyesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us?\nseeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren:\nmercy and truth be with thee.\u201d\nIttai answered, \u201cAs the Lord liveth, and as my lord the king\nliveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in\ndeath or life, even there also will thy servant be.\u201d These men had\nbeen converted from paganism to the worship of Jehovah, and nobly\nthey now proved their fidelity to their God and their king. David,\nwith grateful heart, accepted their devotion to his apparently sinking\ncause, and all passed over the brook Kidron on the way toward the\nwilderness.\nAgain the procession halted. A company clad in holy vestments\nwas approaching. \u201cAnd lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were\nwith him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God.\u201d The followers\nof David looked upon this as a happy omen. The presence of that\nsacred symbol was to them a pledge of their deliverance and ultimate\nvictory. It would inspire the people with courage to rally to the king.\nIts absence from Jerusalem would bring terror to the adherents of\nAbsalom.\nAt sight of the ark joy and hope for a brief moment thrilled\nthe heart of David. But soon other thoughts came to him. As the\nappointed ruler of God\u2019s heritage he was under solemn responsibility.\nNot personal interests, but the glory of God and the good of his\npeople, were to be uppermost in the mind of Israel\u2019s king. God, who\ndwelt between the cherubim, had said of Jerusalem, \u201cThis is My\nrest\u201d (Psalm 132:14); and without divine authority neither priest nor\nking had a right to remove therefrom the symbol of His presence.\nAnd David knew that his heart and life must be in harmony with the\ndivine precepts, else the ark would be the means of disaster rather\nthan of success. His great sin was ever before him. He recognized in\nthis conspiracy the just judgment of God. The sword that was not to\ndepart from his house had been unsheathed. He knew not what the\nresult of the struggle might be. It was not for him to remove from\nthe capital of the nation the sacred statutes which embodied the will\nRebellion of Absalom 673\nof their divine Sovereign, which were the constitution of the realm\nand the foundation of its prosperity.\nHe commanded Zadok, \u201cCarry back the ark of God into the city: [733]\n[734]\n[735]\nif I shall find favor in the eyes of the Lord, He will bring me again,\nand show me both it and His habitation: but if He thus say, I have\nno delight in thee; behold, here am I, let Him do to me as seemeth\ngood unto Him.\u201d\nDavid added, \u201cArt not thou a seer?\u201d\u2014a man appointed of God\nto instruct the people. \u201cReturn into the city in peace, and your two\nsons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.\nSee, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word\nfrom you to certify me.\u201d In the city the priests might do him good\nservice by learning the movements and purposes of the rebels, and\nsecretly communicating them to the king by their sons, Ahimaaz\nand Jonathan.\nAs the priests turned back toward Jerusalem a deeper shadow\nfell upon the departing throng. Their king a fugitive, themselves\noutcasts, forsaken even by the ark of God\u2014the future was dark with\nterror and foreboding. \u201cAnd David went up by the ascent of Mount\nOlivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he\nwent barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every\nman his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. And\none told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with\nAbsalom.\u201d Again David was forced to recognize in his calamities\nthe results of his own sin. The defection of Ahithophel, the ablest\nand most wily of political leaders, was prompted by revenge for the\nfamily disgrace involved in the wrong to Bathsheba, who was his\ngranddaughter.\n\u201cAnd David said, O Lord, I pray Thee, turn the counsel of\nAhithophel into foolishness.\u201d Upon reaching the top of the mount,\nthe king bowed in prayer, casting upon God the burden of his soul\nand humbly supplicating divine mercy. His prayer seemed to be at\nonce answered. Hushai the Archite, a wise and able counselor, who\nhad proved himself a faithful friend to David, now came to him with\nhis robes rent and with earth upon his head, to cast in his fortunes\nwith the dethroned and fugitive king. David saw, as by a divine\nenlightenment, that this man, faithful and truehearted, was the one\nneeded to serve the interests of the king in the councils at the capital.\n674 Patriarchs and Prophets\nAt David\u2019s request Hushai returned to Jerusalem to offer his services\nto Absalom and defeat the crafty counsel of Ahithophel.\nWith this gleam of light in the darkness, the king and his fol-[736]\nlowers pursued their way down the eastern slope of Olivet, through\na rocky and desolate waste, through wild ravines, and along stony\nand precipitous paths, toward the Jordan. \u201cAnd when King David\ncame to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of\nthe house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he\ncame forth, and cursed still as he came. And he cast stones at David,\nand at all the servants of King David: and all the people and all the\nmighty men were on his right hand and on his left. And thus said\nShimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and\nthou man of Belial. The Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood\nof the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the Lord\nhath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and,\nbehold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody\nman.\u201d\nIn David\u2019s prosperity Shimei had not shown by word or act that\nhe was not a loyal subject. But in the affliction of the king this\nBenjamite revealed his true character. He had honored David upon\nhis throne, but he cursed him in his humiliation. Base and selfish, he\nlooked upon others as of the same character as himself, and, inspired\nby Satan, he wreaked his hatred upon him whom God had chastened.\nThe spirit that leads man to triumph over, to revile or distress, one\nwho is in affliction is the spirit of Satan.\nShimei\u2019s accusations against David were utterly false\u2014a base-\nless and malignant slander. David had not been guilty of wrong\ntoward Saul or his house. When Saul was wholly in his power, and\nhe could have slain him, he merely cut the skirt of his robe, and he\nreproached himself for showing even this disrespect for the Lord\u2019s\nanointed.\nOf David\u2019s sacred regard for human life, striking evidence had\nbeen given, even while he himself was hunted like a beast of prey.\nOne day while he was hidden in the cave of Adullam, his thoughts\nturning back to the untroubled freedom of his boyhood life, the\nfugitive exclaimed, \u201cOh that one would give me drink of the water\nof the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!\u201d 2 Samuel 23:13-17.\nBethlehem was at that time in the hands of the Philistines; but three\nRebellion of Absalom 675\nmighty men of David\u2019s band broke through the guard, and brought\nof the water of Bethlehem to their master. David could not drink it.\n\u201cBe it far from me,\u201d he cried; \u201cis not this the blood of the men that [737]\nwent in jeopardy of their lives?\u201d And he reverently poured out the\nwater as an offering to God. David had been a man of war, much\nof his life had been spent amid scenes of violence; but of all who\nhave passed through such an ordeal, few indeed have been so little\naffected by its hardening, demoralizing influence as was David.\nDavid\u2019s nephew, Abishai, one of the bravest of his captains,\ncould not listen patiently to Shimei\u2019s insulting words. \u201cWhy,\u201d he\nexclaimed, \u201cshould this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go\nover, I pray thee, and take off his head.\u201d But the king forbade him.\n\u201cBehold,\u201d he said, \u201cmy son ... seeketh my life: how much more now\nmay this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the\nLord hath bidden him. It may be that the Lord will look on mine\naffliction, and that the Lord will requite me good for his cursing this\nday.\u201d\nConscience was uttering bitter and humiliating truths to David.\nWhile his faithful subjects wondered at his sudden reverse of fortune,\nit was no mystery to the king. He had often had forebodings of an\nhour like this. He had wondered that God had so long borne with\nhis sins, and had delayed the merited retribution. And now in his\nhurried and sorrowful flight, his feet bare, his royal robes changed\nfor sackcloth, the lamentations of his followers awaking the echoes\nof the hills, he thought of his loved capital\u2014of the place which had\nbeen the scene of his sin\u2014and as he remembered the goodness and\nlong-suffering of God, he was not altogether without hope. He felt\nthat the Lord would still deal with him in mercy.\nMany a wrongdoer has excused his own sin by pointing to\nDavid\u2019s fall, but how few there are who manifest David\u2019s penitence\nand humility. How few would bear reproof and retribution with the\npatience and fortitude that he manifested. He had confessed his sin,\nand for years had sought to do his duty as a faithful servant of God;\nhe had labored for the upbuilding of his kingdom, and under his rule\nit had attained to strength and prosperity never reached before. He\nhad gathered rich stores of material for the building of the house\nof God, and now was all the labor of his life to be swept away?\nMust the results of years of consecrated toil, the work of genius and\n676 Patriarchs and Prophets\ndevotion and statesmanship, pass into the hands of his reckless and\ntraitorous son, who regarded not the honor of God nor the prosperity\nof Israel? How natural it would have seemed for David to murmur[738]\nagainst God in this great affliction!\nBut he saw in his own sin the cause of his trouble. The words\nof the prophet Micah breathe the spirit that inspired David\u2019s heart.\n\u201cWhen I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me. I will\nbear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against Him,\nuntil He plead my cause, and execute judgment for me.\u201d Micah\n7:8, 9. And the Lord did not forsake David. This chapter in his\nexperience, when, under cruelest wrong and insult, he shows himself\nto be humble, unselfish, generous, and submissive, is one of the\nnoblest in his whole experience. Never was the ruler of Israel more\ntruly great in the sight of heaven than at this hour of his deepest\noutward humiliation.\nHad God permitted David to go on unrebuked in sin, and while\ntransgressing the divine precepts, to remain in peace and prosperity\nupon his throne, the skeptic and infidel might have had some excuse\nfor citing the history of David as a reproach to the religion of the\nBible. But in the experience through which He caused David to\npass, the Lord shows that He cannot tolerate or excuse sin. And\nDavid\u2019s history enables us to see also the great ends which God has\nin view in His dealings with sin; it enables us to trace, even through\ndarkest judgments, the working out of His purposes of mercy and\nbeneficence. He caused David to pass under the rod, but He did not\ndestroy him; the furnace is to purify, but not to consume. The Lord\nsays, \u201cIf they break My statutes, and keep not My commandments;\nthen will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity\nwith stripes. Nevertheless My loving-kindness will I not utterly take\nfrom him, nor suffer My faithfulness to fail.\u201d Psalm 89:31-33.\nSoon after David left Jerusalem, Absalom and his army entered,\nand without a struggle took possession of the stronghold of Israel.\nHushai was among the first to greet the new-crowned monarch, and\nthe prince was surprised and gratified at the accession of his father\u2019s\nold friend and counselor. Absalom was confident of success. Thus\nfar his schemes had prospered, and eager to strengthen his throne\nand secure the confidence of the nation, he welcomed Hushai to his\ncourt.\nRebellion of Absalom 677\nAbsalom was now surrounded by a large force, but it was mostly\ncomposed of men untrained for war. As yet they had not been [739]\nbrought into conflict. Ahithophel well knew that David\u2019s situation\nwas far from hopeless. A large part of the nation were still true\nto him; he was surrounded by tried warriors, who were faithful to\ntheir king, and his army was commanded by able and experienced\ngenerals. Ahithophel knew that after the first burst of enthusiasm\nin favor of the new king, a reaction would come. Should the re-\nbellion fail, Absalom might be able to secure a reconciliation with\nhis father; then Ahithophel, as his chief counselor, would be held\nmost guilty for the rebellion; upon him the heaviest punishment\nwould fall. To prevent Absalom from retracing his steps, Ahithophel\ncounseled him to an act that in the eyes of the whole nation would\nmake reconciliation impossible. With hellish cunning this wily and\nunprincipled statesman urged Absalom to add the crime of incest to\nthat of rebellion. In the sight of all Israel he was to take to himself\nhis father\u2019s concubines, according to the custom of oriental nations,\nthus declaring that he succeeded to his father\u2019s throne. And Absalom\ncarried out the vile suggestion. Thus was fulfilled the word of God\nto David by the prophet, \u201cBehold, I will raise up evil against thee out\nof thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and\ngive them unto thy neighbor.... For thou didst it secretly: but I will\ndo this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.\u201d 2 Samuel 12:11,\n12. Not that God prompted these acts of wickedness, but because of\nDavid\u2019s sin He did not exercise His power to prevent them.\nAhithophel had been held in high esteem for his wisdom, but he\nwas destitute of the enlightenment which comes from God. \u201cThe\nfear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom\u201d (Proverbs 9:10); and\nthis, Ahithophel did not possess, or he could hardly have based the\nsuccess of treason upon the crime of incest. Men of corrupt hearts\nplot wickedness, as if there were no overruling Providence to cross\ntheir designs; but \u201cHe that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the\nLord shall have them in derision.\u201d Psalm 2:4. The Lord declares:\n\u201cThey would none of My counsel: they despised all My reproof.\nTherefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled\nwith their own devices. For the turning away of the simple shall\nslay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.\u201d Proverbs\n1:30-32.\n678 Patriarchs and Prophets\nHaving succeeded in the plot for securing his own safety,\nAhithophel urged upon Absalom the necessity of immediate ac-[740]\ntion against David. \u201cLet me now choose out twelve thousand men,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cand I will arise and pursue after David this night: and I\nwill come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will\nmake him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee;\nand I will smite the king only: and I will bring back all the people\nunto thee.\u201d This plan was approved by the king\u2019s counselors. Had it\nbeen followed, David would surely have been slain, unless the Lord\nhad directly interposed to save him. But a wisdom higher than that\nof the renowned Ahithophel was directing events. \u201cThe Lord had\nappointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent\nthat the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom.\u201d\nHushai had not been called to the council, and he would not\nintrude himself unasked, lest suspicion should be drawn upon him\nas a spy; but after the assembly had dispersed, Absalom, who had a\nhigh regard for the judgment of his father\u2019s counselor, submitted to\nhim the plan of Ahithophel. Hushai saw that if the proposed plan\nwere followed, David would be lost. And he said, \u201cThe counsel that\nAhithophel hath given is not good at this time. For, said Hushai,\nthou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and\nthey be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the\nfield: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the\npeople. Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place;\u201d\nhe argued that, if Absalom\u2019s forces should pursue David, they would\nnot capture the king; and should they suffer a reverse, it would tend\nto dishearten them and work great harm to Absalom\u2019s cause. \u201cFor,\u201d\nhe said, \u201call Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and\nthey which be with him are valiant men.\u201d And he suggested a plan\nattractive to a vain and selfish nature, fond of the show of power:\n\u201cI counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan\neven to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and\nthat thou go to battle in thine own person. So shall we come upon\nhim in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon\nhim as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men\nthat are with him there shall not be left so much as one. Moreover,\nif he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city,\nRebellion of Absalom 679\nand we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone\nfound there.\n\u201cAnd Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of [741]\nHushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.\u201d But\nthere was one who was not deceived\u2014one who clearly foresaw\nthe result of this fatal mistake of Absalom\u2019s. Ahithophel knew\nthat the cause of the rebels was lost. And he knew that whatever\nmight be the fate of the prince, there was no hope for the counselor\nwho had instigated his greatest crimes. Ahithophel had encouraged\nAbsalom in rebellion; he had counseled him to the most abominable\nwickedness, to the dishonor of his father; he had advised the slaying\nof David and had planned its accomplishment; he had cut off the last\npossibility of his own reconciliation with the king; and now another\nwas preferred before him, even by Absalom. Jealous, angry, and\ndesperate, Ahithophel \u201cgat him home to his house, to his city, and\nput his household in order, and hanged himself, and died.\u201d Such was\nthe result of the wisdom of one, who, with all his high endowments,\ndid not make God his counselor. Satan allures men with flattering\npromises, but in the end it will be found by every soul, that the\n\u201cwages of sin is death.\u201d Romans 6:23.\nHushai, not certain that his counsel would be followed by the\nfickle king, lost no time in warning David to escape beyond Jordan\nwithout delay. To the priests, who were to forward it by their sons,\nHushai sent the message: \u201cThus and thus did Ahithophel counsel\nAbsalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled.\nNow therefore ... lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness,\nbut speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the\npeople that are with him.\u201d\nThe young men were suspected and pursued, yet they succeeded\nin performing their perilous mission. David, spent with toil and grief\nafter that first day of flight, received the message that he must cross\nthe Jordan that night, for his son was seeking his life.\nWhat were the feelings of the father and king, so cruelly wronged,\nin this terrible peril? \u201cA mighty valiant man,\u201d a man of war, a king,\nwhose word was law, betrayed by his son whom he had loved and\nindulged and unwisely trusted, wronged and deserted by subjects\nbound to him by the strongest ties of honor and fealty\u2014in what\n680 Patriarchs and Prophets\nwords did David pour out the feelings of his soul? In the hour of his\ndarkest trial David\u2019s heart was stayed upon God, and he sang:\n\u201cLord, how are they increased that trouble me! [742]\nMany are they that rise up against me.\nMany there be which say of my soul,\nThere is no help for him in God.\nBut Thou, O Lord, art a shield for me;\nMy glory, and the lifter up of mine head.\nI cried unto the Lord with my voice,\nAnd He heard me out of His holy hill.\nI laid me down and slept;\nI awaked; for the Lord sustained me.\nI will not be afraid of ten thousands of people,\nThat have set themselves against me round about....\nSalvation belongeth unto the Lord:\nThy blessing is upon Thy people.\u201d Psalm 3:1-8.\nDavid and all his company\u2014warriors and statesmen, old men\nand youth, the women and the little children\u2014in the darkness of\nnight crossed the deep and swift-flowing river. \u201cBy the morning\nlight there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.\u201d\nDavid and his forces fell back to Mahanaim, which had been\nthe royal seat of Ishbosheth. This was a strongly fortified city,\nsurrounded by a mountainous district favorable for retreat in case\nof war. The country was well-provisioned, and the people were\nfriendly to the cause of David. Here many adherents joined him,\nwhile wealthy tribesmen brought abundant gifts of provision, and\nother needed supplies.\nHushai\u2019s counsel had achieved its object, gaining for David\nopportunity for escape; but the rash and impetuous prince could\nnot be long restrained, and he soon set out in pursuit of his father.\n\u201cAnd Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel\nwith him.\u201d Absalom made Amasa, the son of David\u2019s sister Abigail,\ncommander-in-chief of his forces. His army was large, but it was\nundisciplined and poorly prepared to cope with the tried soldiers of\nhis father.\nRebellion of Absalom 681\nDavid divided his forces into three battalions under the command\nof Joab, Abishai, and Ittai the Gittite. It had been his purpose himself\nto lead his army in the field; but against this the officers of the army,\nthe counselors, and the people vehemently protested. \u201cThou shalt\nnot go forth,\u201d they said: \u201cfor if we flee away, they will not care for\nus; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but thou art worth\nten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou be ready [743]\nto succour us out of the city. And the king said unto them, What\nseemeth you best I will do.\u201d 2 Samuel 18:3, 4, R.V .\nFrom the walls of the city the long lines of the rebel army were\nin full view. The usurper was accompanied by a vast host, in com-\nparison with which David\u2019s force seemed but a handful. But as the\nking looked upon the opposing forces, the thought uppermost in his\nmind was not of the crown and the kingdom, nor of his own life,\nthat depended upon the wage of battle. The father\u2019s heart was filled\nwith love and pity for his rebellious son. As the army filed out from\nthe city gates David encouraged his faithful soldiers, bidding them\ngo forth trusting that the God of Israel would give them the victory.\nBut even here he could not repress his love for Absalom. As Joab,\nleading the first column, passed his king, the conqueror of a hundred\nbattlefields stooped his proud head to hear the monarch\u2019s last mes-\nsage, as with trembling voice he said, \u201cDeal gently for my sake with\nthe young man, even with Absalom.\u201d And Abishai and Ittai received\nthe same charge\u2014\u201cDeal gently for my sake with the young man,\neven with Absalom.\u201d But the king\u2019s solicitude, seeming to declare\nthat Absalom was dearer to him than his kingdom, dearer even than\nthe subjects faithful to his throne, only increased the indignation of\nthe soldiers against the unnatural son.\nThe place of battle was a wood near the Jordan, in which the\ngreat numbers of Absalom\u2019s army were only a disadvantage to him.\nAmong the thickets and marshes of the forest these undisciplined\ntroops became confused and unmanageable. And \u201cthe people of\nIsrael were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a\ngreat slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.\u201d Absalom, seeing\nthat the day was lost, had turned to flee, when his head was caught\nbetween the branches of a widespreading tree, and his mule going\nout from under him, he was left helplessly suspended, a prey to his\nenemies. In this condition he was found by a soldier, who, for fear\n682 Patriarchs and Prophets\nof displeasing the king, spared Absalom, but reported to Joab what\nhe had seen. Joab was restrained by no scruples. He had befriended\nAbsalom, having twice secured his reconciliation with David, and\nthe trust had been shamelessly betrayed. But for the advantages\ngained by Absalom through Joab\u2019s intercession, this rebellion, with\nall its horrors, could never have occurred. Now it was in Joab\u2019s\npower at one blow to destroy the instigator of all this evil. \u201cAnd he[744]\ntook three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of\nAbsalom.... And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in\nthe wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him.\u201d\nThus perished the instigators of rebellion in Israel. Ahithophel\nhad died by his own hand. The princely Absalom, whose glorious\nbeauty had been the pride of Israel, had been cut down in the vigor\nof his youth, his dead body thrust into a pit, and covered with a\nheap of stones, in token of everlasting reproach. During his lifetime\nAbsalom had reared for himself a costly monument in the king\u2019s\ndale, but the only memorial which marked his grave was that heap\nof stones in the wilderness.\nThe leader of the rebellion being slain, Joab by the sound of the\ntrumpet recalled his army from the pursuit of the fleeing host, and\nmessengers were at once dispatched to bear the tidings to the king.\nThe watchman upon the city wall, looking out toward the battle-\nfield, discovered a man running alone. Soon a second came in sight.\nAs the first drew nearer, the watchman said to the king, who was\nwaiting beside the gate, \u201cMe thinketh the running of the foremost is\nlike the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said,\nHe is a good man, and cometh with good tidings. And Ahimaaz\ncalled, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the\nearth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the Lord\nthy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand\nagainst my lord the king.\u201d To the king\u2019s eager inquiry, \u201cIs the young\nman Absalom safe?\u201d Ahimaaz returned an evasive answer.\nThe second messenger came, crying, \u201cTidings, my lord the king:\nfor the Lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up\nagainst thee.\u201d Again from the father\u2019s lips came the absorbing ques-\ntion, \u201cIs the young man Absalom safe?\u201d Unable to conceal the heavy\ntidings, the herald answered, \u201cThe enemies of my lord the king, and\nall that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.\u201d It\nRebellion of Absalom 683\nwas enough. David questioned no further, but with bowed head he\n\u201cwent up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went,\nthus he said, O my son Absalom! my son, my son Absalom! would\nGod I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\u201d\nThe victorious army, returning from the field, approached the [745]\ncity, their shouts of triumph awaking the echoes of the hills. But as\nthey entered the city gate the shout died away, their banners drooped\nin their hands, and with downcast gaze they advanced more like\nthose who had suffered defeat than like conquerors. For the king\nwas not waiting to bid them welcome, but from the chamber above\nthe gate his wailing cry was heard, \u201cO my son Absalom! my son,\nmy son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my\nson, my son!\u201d\n\u201cThe victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the\npeople; for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved\nfor his son. And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city,\nas people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.\u201d\nJoab was filled with indignation. God had given them reason\nfor triumph and gladness; the greatest rebellion that had ever been\nknown in Israel had been crushed; and yet this great victory was\nturned to mourning for him whose crime had cost the blood of\nthousands of brave men. The rude, blunt captain pushed his way\ninto the presence of the king, and boldly said, \u201cThou hast shamed\nthis day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy\nlife, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters; ... in that thou\nlovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared\nthis day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this\nday I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this\nday, then it had pleased thee well. Now therefore arise, go forth,\nand speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the Lord, if\nthou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and\nthat will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy\nyouth until now.\u201d\nHarsh and even cruel as was the reproof to the heart-stricken\nking, David did not resent it. Seeing that his general was right, he\nwent down to the gate, and with words of courage and commendation\ngreeted his brave soldiers as they marched past him.\nChapter 73\u2014The Last Years of David[746]\nThis chapter is based on 2 Samuel 24; 1 Kings 1; 1 Chronicles 21;\n28; 29.\nThe overthrow of Absalom did not at once bring peace to the\nkingdom. So large a part of the nation had joined in revolt that David\nwould not return to his capital and resume his authority without an\ninvitation from the tribes. In the confusion that followed Absalom\u2019s\ndefeat there was no prompt and decided action to recall the king,\nand when at last Judah undertook to bring back David, the jealousy\nof the other tribes was roused, and a counter-revolution followed.\nThis, however, was speedily quelled, and peace returned to Israel.\nThe history of David affords one of the most impressive testi-\nmonies ever given to the dangers that threaten the soul from power\nand riches and worldly honor\u2014those things that are most eagerly\ndesired among men. Few have ever passed through an experience\nbetter adapted to prepare them for enduring such a test. David\u2019s\nearly life as a shepherd, with its lessons of humility, of patient toil,\nand of tender care for his flocks; the communion with nature in the\nsolitude of the hills, developing his genius for music and poetry,\nand directing his thoughts to the Creator; the long discipline of his\nwilderness life, calling into exercise courage, fortitude, patience, and\nfaith in God, had been appointed by the Lord as a preparation for the\nthrone of Israel. David had enjoyed precious experiences of the love\nof God, and had been richly endowed with His Spirit; in the history\nof Saul he had seen the utter worthlessness of mere human wisdom.\nAnd yet worldly success and honor so weakened the character of\nDavid that he was repeatedly overcome by the tempter.\nIntercourse with heathen peoples led to a desire to follow their\nnational customs and kindled ambition for worldly greatness. As\nthe people of Jehovah, Israel was to be honored; but as pride and\nself-confidence increased, the Israelites were not content with this[747]\npre-eminence. They cared rather for their standing among other\n684\nLast Years of David 685\nnations. This spirit could not fail to invite temptation. With a view to\nextending his conquests among foreign nations, David determined\nto increase his army by requiring military service from all who were\nof proper age. To effect this, it became necessary to take a census of\nthe population. It was pride and ambition that prompted this action\nof the king. The numbering of the people would show the contrast\nbetween the weakness of the kingdom when David ascended the\nthrone and its strength and prosperity under his rule. This would tend\nstill further to foster the already too great self-confidence of both\nking and people. The Scripture says, \u201cSatan stood up against Israel,\nand provoked David to number Israel.\u201d The prosperity of Israel under\nDavid had been due to the blessing of God rather than to the ability\nof her king or the strength of her armies. But the increasing of the\nmilitary resources of the kingdom would give the impression to\nsurrounding nations that Israel\u2019s trust was in her armies, and not in\nthe power of Jehovah.\nThough the people of Israel were proud of their national great-\nness, they did not look with favor upon David\u2019s plan for so greatly\nextending the military service. The proposed enrollment caused\nmuch dissatisfaction; consequently it was thought necessary to em-\nploy the military officers in place of the priests and magistrates,\nwho had formerly taken the census. The object of the undertaking\nwas directly contrary to the principles of a theocracy. Even Joab\nremonstrated, unscrupulous as he had heretofore shown himself. He\nsaid, \u201cThe Lord make His people a hundred times so many more as\nthey be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord\u2019s servants?\nwhy then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause\nof trespass to Israel? Nevertheless the king\u2019s word prevailed against\nJoab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and\ncame to Jerusalem.\u201d The numbering was not finished when David\nwas convicted of his sin. Self-condemned, he \u201csaid unto God, I have\nsinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech\nThee, do away the iniquity of Thy servant; for I have done very\nfoolishly.\u201d The next morning a message was brought to David by the\nprophet Gad: \u201cThus saith the Lord, Choose thee either three years\u2019\nfamine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that [748]\nthe sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the\nsword of the Lord, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of\n686 Patriarchs and Prophets\nthe Lord destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now there-\nfore,\u201d said the prophet, \u201cadvise thyself what word I shall bring again\nto Him that sent me.\u201d\nThe king\u2019s answer was, \u201cI am in a great strait: let us fall now\ninto the hand of the Lord; for His mercies are great: and let me not\nfall into the hand of man.\u201d\nThe land was smitten with pestilence, which destroyed seventy\nthousand in Israel. The scourge had not yet entered the capital,\nwhen \u201cDavid lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord stand\nbetween the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand\nstretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel,\nwho were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.\u201d The king\npleaded with God in behalf of Israel: \u201cIs it not I that commanded\nthe people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done\nevil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let Thine\nhand, I pray Thee, O Lord my God, be on me, and on my father\u2019s\nhouse; but not on Thy people, that they should be plagued.\u201d\nThe taking of the census had caused disaffection among the peo-\nple; yet they had themselves cherished the same sins that prompted\nDavid\u2019s action. As the Lord through Absalom\u2019s sin visited judgment\nupon David, so through David\u2019s error he punished the sins of Israel.\nThe destroying angel had stayed his course outside Jerusalem.\nHe stood upon Mount Moriah, \u201cin the threshing floor of Ornan the\nJebusite.\u201d Directed by the prophet, David went to the mountain, and\nthere built an altar to the Lord, \u201cand offered burnt offerings and\npeace offerings, and called upon the Lord; and He answered him\nfrom heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.\u201d \u201cSo the Lord\nwas entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.\u201d\nThe spot upon which the altar was erected, henceforth ever to\nbe regarded as holy ground, was tendered to the king by Ornan as\na gift. But the king declined thus to receive it. \u201cI will verily buy it\nfor the full price,\u201d he said; \u201cfor I will not take that which is thine for\nthe Lord, nor offer burnt offerings without cost. So David gave to\nOrnan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.\u201d This[749]\nspot, memorable as the place where Abraham had built the altar to\noffer up his son, and now hallowed by this great deliverance, was\nafterward chosen as the site of the temple erected by Solomon.\nLast Years of David 687\nStill another shadow was to gather over the last years of David.\nHe had reached the age of threescore and ten. The hardships and\nexposures of his early wanderings, his many wars, the cares and\nafflictions of his later years, had sapped the fountain of life. Though\nhis mind retained its clearness and strength, feebleness and age, with\ntheir desire for seclusion, prevented a quick apprehension of what\nwas passing in the kingdom, and again rebellion sprang up in the very\nshadow of the throne. Again the fruit of David\u2019s parental indulgence\nwas manifest. The one who now aspired to the throne was Adonijah,\n\u201ca very goodly man\u201d in person and bearing, but unprincipled and\nreckless. In his youth he had been subjected to but little restraint; for\n\u201chis father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast\nthou done so?\u201d He now rebelled against the authority of God, who\nhad appointed Solomon to the throne. Both by natural endowments\nand religious character Solomon was better qualified than his elder\nbrother to become ruler of Israel; yet although the choice of God had\nbeen clearly indicated, Adonijah did not fail to find sympathizers.\nJoab, though guilty of many crimes, had heretofore been loyal to the\nthrone; but he now joined the conspiracy against Solomon, as did\nalso Abiathar the priest.\nThe rebellion was ripe; the conspirators had assembled at a great\nfeast just without the city to proclaim Adonijah king, when their\nplans were thwarted by the prompt action of a few faithful persons,\nchief among whom were Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet,\nand Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. They represented the state\nof affairs to the king, reminding him of the divine direction that\nSolomon should succeed to the throne. David at once abdicated in\nfavor of Solomon, who was immediately anointed and proclaimed\nking. The conspiracy was crushed. Its chief actors had incurred the\npenalty of death. Abiathar\u2019s life was spared, out of respect to his\noffice and his former fidelity to David; but he was degraded from\nthe office of high priest, which passed to the line of Zadok. Joab and\nAdonijah were spared for the time, but after the death of David they\nsuffered the penalty of their crime. The execution of the sentence [750]\nupon the son of David completed the fourfold judgment that testified\nto God\u2019s abhorrence of the father\u2019s sin.\nFrom the very opening of David\u2019s reign one of his most cherished\nplans had been that of erecting a temple to the Lord. Though he had\n688 Patriarchs and Prophets\nnot been permitted to execute this design, he had manifested no less\nzeal and earnestness in its behalf. He had provided an abundance\nof the most costly material\u2014gold, silver, onyx stones, and stones\nof divers colors; marble, and the most precious woods. And now\nthese valuable treasures that he had collected must be committed to\nothers; for other hands must build the house for the ark, the symbol\nof God\u2019s presence.\nSeeing that his end was near, the king summoned the princes\nof Israel, with representative men from all parts of the kingdom,\nto receive this legacy in trust. He desired to commit to them his\ndying charge and secure their concurrence and support in the great\nwork to be accomplished. Because of his physical weakness, it had\nnot been expected that he would attend to this transfer in person;\nbut the inspiration of God came upon him, and with more than his\nwonted fervor and power, he was able, for the last time, to address\nhis people. He told them of his own desire to build the temple, and of\nthe Lord\u2019s command that the work should be committed to Solomon\nhis son. The divine assurance was, \u201cSolomon thy son, he shall build\nMy house and My courts; for I have chosen him to be My son, and\nI will be his Father. Moreover I will establish his kingdom forever,\nif he be constant to do My commandments and My judgments, as\nat this day.\u201d \u201cNow therefore,\u201d David said, \u201cin the sight of all Israel\nthe congregation of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, keep\nand seek for all the commandments of the Lord your God: that ye\nmay possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your\nchildren after you forever.\u201d\nDavid had learned by his own experience how hard is the path\nof him who departs from God. He had felt the condemnation of the\nbroken law, and had reaped the fruits of transgression; and his whole\nsoul was moved with solicitude that the leaders of Israel should be\ntrue to God, and that Solomon should obey God\u2019s law, shunning the\nsins that had weakened his father\u2019s authority, embittered his life, and\ndishonored God. David knew that it would require humility of heart,[751]\na constant trust in God, and unceasing watchfulness to withstand the\ntemptations that would surely beset Solomon in his exalted station;\nfor such prominent characters are a special mark for the shafts of\nSatan. Turning to his son, already acknowledged as his successor\non the throne, David said: \u201cAnd thou, Solomon my son, know thou\nLast Years of David 689\nthe God of thy father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a\nwilling mind: for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth\nall the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek Him, He will be\nfound of thee; but if thou forsake Him, He will cast thee off forever.\nTake heed now; for the Lord hath chosen thee to build a house for\nthe sanctuary: be strong, and do it.\u201d\nDavid gave Solomon minute directions for building the temple,\nwith patterns of every part, and of all its instruments of service,\nas had been revealed to him by divine inspiration. Solomon was\nstill young, and shrank from the weighty responsibilities that would\ndevolve upon him in the erection of the temple and in the government\nof God\u2019s people. David said to his son, \u201cBe strong and of good\ncourage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed, for the Lord God, even\nmy God, will be with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.\u201d\nAgain David appealed to the congregation: \u201cSolomon my son,\nwhom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work\nis great: for the palace is not for man, but for the Lord God.\u201d He said,\n\u201cI have prepared with all my might for the house of my God,\u201d and\nhe went on to enumerate the materials he had gathered. More than\nthis, he said, \u201cI have set my affection to the house of my God, I have\nof mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to\nthe house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for\nthe holy house, even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of\nOphir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the\nwalls of the houses withal.\u201d \u201cWho then,\u201d he asked of the assembled\nmultitude that had brought their liberal gifts\u2014\u201cwho then is willing\nto consecrate his service this day unto the Lord?\u201d\nThere was a ready response from the assembly. \u201cThe chief\nof the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains\nof thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king\u2019s work,\noffered willingly, and gave, for the service of the house of God, of\ngold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten [752]\nthousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one\nhundred thousand talents of iron. And they with whom precious\nstones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the\nLord.... Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,\nbecause with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord: and\nDavid the king also rejoiced with great joy.\n690 Patriarchs and Prophets\n\u201cWherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation:\nand David said, Blessed be Thou, Lord God of Israel our father,\nforever and ever. Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power,\nand the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the\nheaven and in the earth is Thine; Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and\nThou art exalted as head above all. Both riches and honor come of\nThee, and Thou reignest over all; and in Thine hand is power and\nmight; and in Thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength\nunto all. Now therefore, our God, we thank Thee, and praise Thy\nglorious name. But who am I, and what is my people, that we should\nbe able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of\nThee, and of Thine own have we given Thee. For we are strangers\nbefore Thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the\nearth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding. O Lord our God,\nall this store that we have prepared to build Thee an house for Thine\nholy name cometh of Thine hand, and is all Thine own. I know also,\nmy God, that Thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness.\n\u201cAs for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly\noffered all these things: and now have I seen with joy Thy people,\nwhich are present here, to offer willingly unto Thee. O Lord God\nof Abraham, Isaac and of Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the\nimagination of the thoughts of the heart of Thy people, and prepare\ntheir heart unto Thee: and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart,\nto keep Thy commandments, Thy testimonies, and Thy statutes, and\nto do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have\nmade provision. And David said to all the congregation, Now bless\nthe Lord your God. And all the congregation blessed the Lord God\nof their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshiped the\nLord.\u201d\nWith deepest interest the king had gathered the rich material for[753]\nbuilding and beautifying the temple. He had composed the glorious\nanthems that in afteryears should echo through its courts. Now his\nheart was made glad in God, as the chief of the fathers and the princes\nof Israel so nobly responded to his appeal, and offered themselves\nto the important work before them. And as they gave their service,\nthey were disposed to do more. They swelled the offerings, giving\nof their own possessions into the treasury. David had felt deeply his\nown unworthiness in gathering the material for the house of God,\nLast Years of David 691\nand the expression of loyalty in the ready response of the nobles of\nhis kingdom, as with willing hearts they dedicated their treasures\nto Jehovah and devoted themselves to His service, filled him with\njoy. But it was God alone who had imparted this disposition to His\npeople. He, not man, must be glorified. It was He who had provided\nthe people with the riches of earth, and His Spirit had made them\nwilling to bring their precious things for the temple. It was all of\nthe Lord; if His love had not moved upon the hearts of the people,\nthe king\u2019s efforts would have been vain, and the temple would never\nhave been erected.\nAll that man receives of God\u2019s bounty still belongs to God.\nWhatever God has bestowed in the valuable and beautiful things of\nearth is placed in the hands of men to test them\u2014to sound the depths\nof their love for Him and their appreciation of His favors. Whether\nit be the treasures of wealth or of intellect, they are to be laid, a\nwilling offering, at the feet of Jesus; the giver saying, meanwhile,\nwith David, \u201cAll things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we\ngiven Thee.\u201d\nWhen he felt that death was approaching, the burden of David\u2019s\nheart was still for Solomon and for the kingdom of Israel, whose\nprosperity must so largely depend upon the fidelity of her king. \u201cAnd\nhe charged Solomon his son, saying, I go the way of all the earth: be\nthou strong therefore, and show thyself a man; and keep the charge\nof the Lord thy God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, and\nHis commandments, and His judgments, and His testimonies, ...\nthat thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever\nthou turnest thyself: that the Lord may continue His word which He\nspake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way,\nto walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul,\nthere shall not fail thee (said He) a man on the throne of Israel.\u201d 1\nKings 2:1-4.\nDavid\u2019s \u201clast words,\u201d as recorded, are a song\u2014a song of trust, [754]\nof loftiest principle, and undying faith:\n\u201cDavid the son of Jesse saith,\nAnd the man who was raised on high saith,\nThe anointed of the God of Jacob,\nAnd the sweet psalmist of Israel:\n692 Patriarchs and Prophets\nThe Spirit of Jehovah spake by me: ...\nOne that ruleth over men righteously,\nThat ruleth in the fear of God,\nHe shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,\nA morning without clouds;\nWhen the tender grass springeth out of the earth,\nThrough clear shining after rain.\nVerily my house is not so with God;\nYet He hath made me an everlasting covenant,\nOrdered in all things, and sure:\nFor it is all my salvation, and all my desire.\u201d\n2 Samuel 23:1-5, R.V .\nGreat had been David\u2019s fall, but deep was his repentance, ardent\nwas his love, and strong his faith. He had been forgiven much, and\ntherefore he loved much. Luke 7:47.\nThe psalms of David pass through the whole range of experience,\nfrom the depths of conscious guilt and self-condemnation to the\nloftiest faith and the most exalted communing with God. His life\nrecord declares that sin can bring only shame and woe, but that\nGod\u2019s love and mercy can reach to the deepest depths, that faith will\nlift up the repenting soul to share the adoption of the sons of God. Of\nall the assurances which His word contains, it is one of the strongest\ntestimonies to the faithfulness, the justice, and the covenant mercy\nof God.\nMan \u201cfleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not,\u201d \u201cbut the\nword of our God shall stand forever.\u201d \u201cThe mercy of Jehovah is\nfrom everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him, and His\nrighteousness unto children\u2019s children; to such as keep His covenant,\nand to those that remember His commandments to do them.\u201d Job\n14:2; Isaiah 40:8; Psalm 103:17, 18.\n\u201cWhatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever.\u201d Ecclesiastes 3:14.\nGlorious are the promises made to David and his house, promises\nthat look forward to the eternal ages, and find their complete fulfill-\nment in Christ. The Lord declared:\n\u201cI have sworn unto David My servant ... with whom My hand[755]\nshall be established: Mine arm also shall strengthen him.... My\nfaithfulness and My mercy shall be with him: and in My name shall\nLast Years of David 693\nhis horn be exalted. I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right\nhand in the rivers. He shall cry unto Me, Thou art my Father, my\nGod, and the Rock of my salvation. Also I will make him My first-\nborn, higher than the kings of the earth. My mercy will I keep for\nhim forevermore, and My covenant shall stand fast with him.\u201d Psalm\n89:3-28.\n\u201cHis seed also will I make to endure forever,\nAnd his throne as the days of heaven.\u201d Psalm 89:29.\n\u201cHe shall judge the poor of the people,\nHe shall save the children of the needy,\nAnd shall break in pieces the oppressor.\nThey shall fear thee while the sun endureth,\nAnd so long as the moon, throughout all generations....\nIn his days shall the righteous flourish;\nAnd abundance of peace, till the moon be no more.\nHe shall have dominion also from sea to sea,\nAnd from the river unto the ends of the earth.\u201d\n\u201cHis name shall endure forever:\nHis name shall be continued as long as the sun:\nAnd men shall be blessed in him:\nAll nations shall call him blessed.\u201d\nPsalm 72:4-8, R.V ., 17.\n\u201cFor unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given: and the\ngovernment shall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called\nWonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The\nPrince of Peace.\u201d \u201cHe shall be great, and shall be called the Son of\nthe Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His\nfather David: and He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever;\nand of His kingdom there shall be no end.\u201d Isaiah 9:6; Luke 1:32,\n33(757) .\nAppendix[756]\n[757]\nNote 1. Page 258. In the command for Israel\u2019s release, the Lord\nsaid to Pharaoh, \u201cIsrael is my son, even my first-born.... Let my son\ngo, that he may serve Me.\u201d Exodus 4:22, 23. The psalmist tells us\nwhy God delivered Israel from Egypt: \u201cHe brought forth His people\nwith joy, and His chosen with gladness: And gave them the lands\nof the heathen: And they inherited the labor of the people; that they\nmight observe His statutes, and keep His laws.\u201d Psalm 105:43-45.\nHere we learn that the Hebrews could not serve God in Egypt.\nIn Deuteronomy 5:14, 15 we find special emphasis given to that\nportion of the fourth commandment which requires the manservant\nand the maidservant to rest, and the Israelite was told to remember\nthat he had been a servant in the land of Egypt. The Lord said, \u201cthe\nseventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: In it thou shalt not\ndo any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant,\nnor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle,\nnor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy\nmaidservant may rest as well as thou. And remember that thou wast\na servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought\nthee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched-out arm:\nTherefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath\nday.\u201d In Exodus 5:5 we learn that Moses and Aaron made the people\n\u201crest from their burdens.\u201d\nFrom these facts we may conclude that the Sabbath was one of\nthe things in which they could not serve the Lord in Egypt; and when\nMoses and Aaron came with the message of God (Exodus 4:29-31),\nthey attempted a reform, which only increased the oppression. The\nIsraelites were delivered that they might observe the statutes of the\nLord, including the fourth commandment, and this placed upon them\nan additional obligation to keep the Sabbath strictly, as well as to\nkeep all the commandments. Thus in Deuteronomy 24:17, 18 the\nfact of their deliverance from Egypt is cited as placing them under\nspecial obligation to show kindness to the widow and the fatherless:\n694\nAppendix 695\n\u201cThou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the\nfatherless; nor take a widow\u2019s raiment to pledge: But thou shalt\nremember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the Lord thy God\nredeemed thee thence: Therefore I command thee to do this thing.\u201d\nNote 2. Page 272. That the plagues were designed to destroy [758]\nthe confidence of the Egyptians in the power and protection of their\nidols, and even made their gods to appear as cruel tormentors of\ntheir worshipers, can be seen from a study of the Egyptian religion.\nA few examples may serve to illustrate this fact.\nThe first plague, turning the water of the river Nile and of all\ncanals into blood (Exodus 7:19), was directed against the source of\nEgypt\u2019s very existence. The river Nile was regarded with religious\nreverence, and at several places sacrifices were offered to the Nile\nas to a god.\nThe second plague brought frogs over Egypt. Exodus 8:6. Frogs\nwere held sacred by the Egyptians, and one of their deities, Heqa,\nwas a frog-headed goddess thought to possess creative power. When\nthe frogs, as the result of Moses\u2019 command, multiplied to the extent\nthat they filled the land from one end to the other, the Egyptians may\nhave wondered why Heqa was tormenting her ardent worshipers\ninstead of protecting them. In this way the Egyptians were not only\npunished by the second plague, but witnessed also contempt heaped\nupon them, as they supposed, by one of their gods (Exodus 9:3), of\nwhich many represented powerful gods in the Egyptians pantheon.\nTo mention only a few, we find that the Apis bull was dedicated to\nPtah, the father of all the gods, the cow was sacred to Hathor, one of\nthe most widely worshiped of all female deities of the Nile country,\nwhile the ram represented several gods like Khnemu, and the ram-\nheaded Amen, who was Egypt\u2019s chief god in the New Empire period.\nHence, the disease which slew the animals dedicated to their deities\nrevealed to the Egyptians the impotence of their gods in the presence\nof the God of the despised Hebrews.\nThe ninth plague (Exodus 10:21) dealt a heavy blow to one of\nthe greatest gods of Egypt, the sun god Ra, who had been contin-\nuously worshiped from the earliest times of that country\u2019s known\nhistory. In a land which hardly ever saw clouds in the sky, the sun\nwas recognized as a never-failing power which provided warmth,\nlight, life, and growth to the whole world. Every Egyptian king con-\n696 Patriarchs and Prophets\nsidered himself as a \u201cson of Ra,\u201d and carried this expression in his\ntitulary. When Amen of Thebes became chief god of Egypt during\nthe eighteenth dynasty, the power of the sun god Ra was recognized\nas so great that a compromise was made by combining Amen and Ra\nto make one god\u2014Amen-Ra. A few years after the Exodus, when\nIkhnaton introduced a short-lived monotheism, the only god retained\nwas Aton, the sun disk. Seeing how entrenched sun worship was\nin the religious life of the Egyptians, and how highly the sun god\nRa, Amen-Ra, or Aton was revered, we can understand why the\nplague directed against the god was brought upon Egypt toward the\nculmination of the fight between the God of the Hebrews and His\nEgyptian adversaries.\nAlso the tenth plague, the slaughtering of the first-born (Exodus[759]\n12:29), was striking at least one god, and that was the king, who\nwas considered to be Horus, the son of Osiris. As the ruler of the\nNile country, he was addressed by his subjects as \u201cthe good god.\u201d\nHence, the last plague crowned the actions wrought by the miracle-\nworking power of the Hebrew God. So far gods controlling the\nforces of nature or animals had been disgraced, but now a god living\nin a visible form among the Egyptians was also humiliated by the\ndespised God of the Hebrew slaves, of whom the proud Pharaoh\nonce had said, \u201cWho is the Lord, that I should obey His voice to let\nIsrael go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.\u201d Exodus\n5:2.\nNote 3. Page 282. In Genesis 15:13 we read that the Lord said\nto Abraham, \u201cKnow of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a\nland that is not theirs, and shall serve them: And they shall afflict\nthem four hundred years.\u201d This text raises the questions whether\nthe 400 years refer to the time of affliction or sojourning, or both,\nand what the relation of the 400 years is to the 430 years of Exodus\n12:40, 41, and Galatians 3:16, 17.\nThe statement in Exodus 12:40, that \u201cthe sojourning of the chil-\ndren of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty\nyears,\u201d gives the impression that the Israelites, from Jacob\u2019s entry\ninto Egypt to the Exodus, actually spent 430 years in the country\nof the Nile. That this impression cannot be correct is obvious from\nPaul\u2019s inspired interpretation presented in Galatians 3:16, 17, where\nthe 430 years are said to cover the period beginning when God made\nAppendix 697\nHis covenant with Abraham until the law was promulgated at Sinai.\nPaul seems to refer to the first promise made by God to Abraham\nwhen he was called to leave Haran. Genesis 12:1-3. At that time\nthe 430 years began, when Abraham was seventy-five years old\n(chapter 12:4), while the 400 years of the prophecy of Genesis 15:13\nbegan thirty years later, when Abraham was 105 and his son Isaac\nfive years old (Chapter 21:5). At that time Ishmael, who \u201cwas born\nafter the flesh persecuted him [Isaac] that was born after the Spirit\u201d\n(Galatians 4:29; Genesis 21:9-11), beginning a time of affliction of\nAbraham\u2019s seed which intermittently would be continued until the\ntime of the Exodus. Isaac had not only troubles with his half brother\nIshmael, but also with the Philistines (Genesis 26:15, 20, 21); Jacob\nfled for his life from Esau (Genesis 27:41-43), and later from Laban\n(Genesis 31:21), and then was again in jeopardy from Esau (Genesis\n32:8); Joseph was sold into slavery by his brethren (Genesis 37:28),\nand the children of Israel were oppressed by the Egyptians for many\ndecades (Exodus 1:14).\nThe time from Abraham\u2019s call to Jacob\u2019s entry into Egypt was\n215 years, being the total of (1) twenty-five years lying between\nAbraham\u2019s call and the birth of Isaac (Genesis 12:4; Genesis 21:5),\n(2) sixty years lying between Isaac\u2019s birth and Jacob\u2019s birth (Genesis [760]\n25:26), and (3) the age of Jacob at the time of his migration into\nEgypt (Genesis 47:9). This leaves the remaining 215 years of the 430\nas the actual time the Hebrews spent in Egypt. Hence the 430 years\nof Exodus 12:40 includes the sojourn of the patriarchs in Canaan\nas well as their stay in Egypt. Since in the time of Moses, Palestine\nwas part of the Egyptian empire, it is not strange to find an author of\nthat period including Canaan in the term \u201cEgypt.\u201d The translators\nof the Septuagint, knowing that the 430 years included the sojourn\nof the patriarchs in Canaan, made this point clear in their rendering\nof this passage: \u201cAnd the sojourning of the children of Israel, while\nthey sojourned in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan, was\nfour hundred and thirty years.\u201d An additional corroboration of the\ninterpretation of the 430 years given above is found in the prophecy\nthat the fourth generation of those who had entered Egypt would\nleave it (Genesis 15:16), and its recorded fulfillment in Exodus\n6:16-20.\n698 Patriarchs and Prophets\nNote 4. Page 316. The Israelites, in their adoration of the\ngolden calf, professed to be worshiping God. Thus Aaron, when\ninaugurating the worship of the idol, proclaimed, \u201cTomorrow is a\nfeast unto Jehovah.\u201d They proposed to worship God, as the Egyptians\nworshiped Osiris, under the semblance of the image. But God could\nnot accept the service. Though offered in His name, the sun god,\nand not Jehovah, was the real object of their adoration.\nThe worship of Apis was accompanied with the grossest licen-\ntiousness, and the Scripture record indicates that the calf worship\nby the Israelites was attended with all the license usual in heathen\nworship. We read: \u201cThey rose up early on the morrow, and of-\nfered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people\nsat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.\u201d Exodus 32:6.\nThe Hebrew word rendered \u201cto play\u201d signifies playing with leaping,\nsinging, and dancing. This dancing, especially among the Egyptians,\nwas sensual and indecent. The word rendered \u201ccorrupted\u201d in the\nnext verse, where it is said, \u201cthy people, which thou broughtest out\nof the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves,\u201d is the same that is\nused in Genesis 6:11, 12, where we read that the earth was corrupt,\n\u201cfor all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.\u201d This explains\nthe terrible anger of the Lord, and why He desired to consume the\npeople at once.\nNote 5. Page 329. The Ten Commandments were the \u201ccovenant\u201d\nto which the Lord referred when, in proposing a covenant with\nIsrael, He said, \u201cIf ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My\ncovenant,\u201d etc. Exodus 19:5. The ten commandments were termed\nGod\u2019s \u201ccovenant\u201d before the covenant was made with Israel. They\nwere not an agreement made, but something which Godcommanded\nthem to perform. Thus the Ten Commandments\u2014God\u2019s covenant\u2014[761]\nbecame the basis of the covenant made between Him and Israel.\nThe Ten Commandments in all their details are \u201call these words,\u201d\nconcerning which the covenant was made. See Exodus 24:8.\nNote 6. Page 354. When a sin offering was presented for a priest\nor for the whole congregation, the blood was carried into the holy\nplace and sprinkled before the veil and placed upon the horns of the\nGolden Altar. The fat was consumed upon the altar of burnt offering\nin the court, but the body of the victim was burned without the camp.\nSee Leviticus 4:1-21.\nAppendix 699\nWhen, however, the offering was for a ruler or for one of the\npeople, the blood was not taken into the holy place, but the flesh was\nto be eaten by the priest, as the Lord directed Moses: \u201cThe priest\nthat offereth it for sin shall eat it: In a holy place shall it be eaten,\nin the court of the tent of meeting.\u201d Leviticus 6:26, R.V . See also\nLeviticus 4:22-35.\nNote 7. Page 366. That the One who spoke the law, who called\nMoses into the mount and talked with him, was our Lord Jesus\nChrist, is evident from the following considerations:\nChrist is the One through whom God has at all times revealed\nHimself to man. \u201cBut to us there is but one God, the Father, of\nwhom are all things, and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ,\nby whom are all things, and we by Him.\u201d 1 Corinthians 8:6. \u201cThis\nis he [Moses], that was in the church in the wilderness with the\nAngel which spake to him in the Mount Sinai, and with our fathers:\nwho received the lively oracles to give unto us.\u201d Acts 7:38. This\nAngel was the Angel of God\u2019s presence (Isaiah 63:9), the Angel in\nwhom was the name of the great Jehovah (Exodus 23:20-23). The\nexpression can refer to no other than the Son of God.\nAgain: Christ is called the Word of God. John 1:1-3. He is so\ncalled because God gave His revelations to man in all ages through\nChrist. It was His Spirit that inspired the prophets. 1 Peter 1:10, 11.\nHe was revealed to them as the Angel of Jehovah, the Captain of the\nLord\u2019s host, Michael the Archangel.\nNote 8. Page 603. The question has been raised, and is now\nmuch agitated, if a theocracy was good in the time of Israel, why\nwould not a theocratical form of government be equally good for\nthis time? The answer is easy:\nA theocracy is a government which derives its power immedi-\nately from God. The government of Israel was a true theocracy.\nThat was really a government of God. At the burning bush, God\ncommissioned Moses to lead His people out of Egypt. By signs\nand wonders and mighty miracles multiplied, God delivered Israel\nfrom Egypt and led them through the wilderness and finally into the [762]\nPromised Land. There He ruled them by judges \u201cuntil Samuel the\nprophet,\u201d to whom, when he was a child, God spoke, and by whom\nHe made known His will. In the days of Samuel the people asked\nthat they might have a king. This was allowed, and God chose Saul,\n700 Patriarchs and Prophets\nand Samuel anointed him king of Israel. Saul failed to do the will\nof God; and as he rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord rejected\nhim from being king and sent Samuel to anoint David king of Israel;\nand David\u2019s throne God established forevermore. When Solomon\nsucceeded to the kingdom in the place of David his father, the record\nis: \u201cThen Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead\nof David his father.\u201d 1 Chronicles 29:23. David\u2019s throne was the\nthrone of the Lord, and Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as\nking over the earthly kingdom of God. The succession to the throne\ndescended in David\u2019s line to Zedekiah, who was made subject to the\nking of Babylon, and who entered into a solemn covenant before\nGod that he would loyally render allegiance to the king of Babylon.\nBut Zedekiah broke his covenant, and then God said to him:\n\u201cThou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come,\nwhen iniquity shall have an end, thus saith the Lord God; remove the\ndiadem, and take off the crown: This shall not be the same: Exalt\nhim that is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn,\noverturn, it: And it shall be no more, until He come whose right it is;\nand I will give it him.\u201d Ezekiel 21:25-27. See also chapter 17:1-21.\nThe kingdom was then subject to Babylon. When Babylon fell,\nand Medo-Persia succeeded, it was overturned the first time. When\nMedo-Persia fell and was succeeded by Greece, it was overturned\nthe second time. When the Greek empire gave way to Rome, it was\noverturned the third time. And then says the word, \u201cIt shall be no\nmore, until He come whose right it is; and I will give it Him.\u201d Who\nis He whose right it is? \u201cThou ... Shalt call His name Jesus. He\nshall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the\nLord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David: And\nHe shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of His kingdom\nthere shall be no end.\u201d Luke 1:31-33. And while He was here as\n\u201cthat Prophet,\u201d a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief, the\nnight in which He was betrayed He Himself declared, \u201cMy kingdom\nis not of this world.\u201d Thus the throne of the Lord has been removed\nfrom this world and will \u201cbe no more, until He come whose right it\nis,\u201d and then it will be given Him. And that time is the end of this\nworld, and the beginning of \u201cthe world to come.\u201d\nTo the twelve apostles the Saviour said, \u201cI appoint unto you a\nkingdom, as My Father hath appointed unto Me; that ye may eat and\nAppendix 701\ndrink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the\ntwelve tribes of Israel.\u201d Luke 22:29, 30. From Matthew\u2019s account\nof Christ\u2019s promise to the twelve we learn when it will be fulfilled; [763]\n\u201cin the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of\nHis glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve\ntribes of Israel.\u201d Matthew 19:28. In the parable of the talents, Christ\nrepresents Himself under the figure of a nobleman who \u201cwent into a\nfar country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.\u201d Luke\n19:12. And He Himself has told us when He will sit upon the throne\nof His glory: \u201cWhen the Son of man shall come in His glory, and\nall the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of\nHis glory: And before Him shall be gathered all nations.\u201d Matthew\n25:31, 32.\nTo this time the revelator looks forward when he says, \u201cThe\nkingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and\nof His Christ; and He shall reign forever and ever.\u201d Revelation 11:15.\nThe context clearly shows when this will take place: \u201cThe nations\nwere angry, and Thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that\nthey should be judged, and that Thou shouldest give reward unto\nThy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear Thy\nname, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the\nearth.\u201d Verse 18. It is at the time of the final judgment, the reward of\nthe righteous, and the punishment of the wicked that the kingdom\nof Christ will be set up. When all who oppose the sovereignty of\nChrist have been destroyed, the kingdoms of this world become the\nkingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ.\nThen Christ will reign, \u201cKing of kings, and Lord of lords.\u201d Reve-\nlation 19:16. \u201cAnd the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of\nthe kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of\nthe saints of the Most High.\u201d And \u201cthe saints of the Most High shall\ntake the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever\nand ever.\u201d Daniel 7:27, 18.\nUntil that time the kingdom of Christ cannot be established on\nthe earth. His kingdom is not of this world. His followers are\nto account themselves \u201cstrangers and pilgrims on the earth.\u201d Paul\nsays, \u201cOur citizenship is in heaven; from whence also we wait for a\nSaviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d Hebrews 11:13; Philippians 3:20,",

      "text": "702 Patriarchs and Prophets\nSince the kingdom of Israel passed away, God has never dele-\ngated authority to any man or body of men to execute His laws as\nsuch. \u201cVengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.\u201d Romans\n12:19. Civil governments have to do with the relations of man with\nman; but they have nothing whatever to do with the duties that grow\nout of man\u2019s relation to God.\nExcept the kingdom of Israel, no government has ever existed\non the earth in which God by inspired men directed the affairs of\nstate. Whenever men have endeavored to form such a government\nas that of Israel, they have, of necessity, taken it upon themselves to\ninterpret and enforce the law of God. They have assumed the right\nto control the conscience, and thus have usurped the prerogative of[764]\nGod.\nIn the former dispensation, while sins against God were vis-\nited with temporal penalties, the judgments executed were not only\nby divine sanction, but under His direct control, and by His com-\nmand. Sorcerers were to be put to death. Idolaters were to be slain.\nProfanity and sacrilege were punished with death. Whole nations\nof idolaters were to be exterminated. But the infliction of these\npenalties was directed by Him who reads the hearts of men, who\nknows the measure of their guilt, and who deals with His creatures\nin wisdom and mercy. When men, with human frailties and passions,\nundertake to do this work, it needs no argument to show that the door\nis opened to unrestrained injustice and cruelty. The most inhuman\ncrimes will be perpetrated, and all in the sacred name of Christ.\nFrom the laws of Israel, which punished offenses against God,\narguments have been drawn to prove the duty of punishing similar\nsins in this age. All persecutors have employed them to justify their\ndeeds. The principle that God has delegated to human authority the\nright to control the conscience is the very foundation of religious\ntyranny and persecution. But all who reason thus lose sight of\nthe fact that we are now living in a different dispensation, under\nconditions wholly different from those of Israel; that the kingdom\nof Israel was a type of the kingdom of Christ, which will not be set\nup until His second coming; and that the duties which pertain to\nman\u2019s relation to God are not to be regulated or enforced by human\nauthority.\nAppendix 703\nNote 9. Page 608. Concerning the identity of the Ramah of\nSamuel with the Ramah of Benjamin, Dr. Edersheim says: \u201cThese\ntwo points seem established: Saul\u2019s residence was at Gibeah, and he\nfirst met Samuel in Ramah. But if so, it seems impossible, in view\nof 1 Samuel 10:2, to identify the Ramah of Samuel with the Ramah\nof Benjamin, or to regard it as the modern Neby Samuel, four miles\nnorthwest of Jerusalem.\u201d",
