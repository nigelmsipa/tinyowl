This longing is implanted in the very constitution of man\nby a merciful God, that man may not be satisfied with his present\nconditions or attainments, whether bad, or good, or better. God\ndesires that the human shall seek the best, and find it to the eternal\nblessing of his soul.\nSatan, by wily scheme and craft, has perverted these longings\nof the human heart. He makes men believe that this desire may\nbe satisfied by pleasure, by wealth, by ease, by fame, by power;\nbut those who have been thus deceived by him (and they number\nmyriads) find all these things pall upon the sense, leaving the soul\nas barren and unsatisfied as before.\nIt is God\u2019s design that this longing of the human heart should\nlead to the one who alone is able to satisfy it. The desire is of\nHim that it may lead to Him, the fullness and fulfillment of that\ndesire. That fullness is found in Jesus the Christ, the Son of the\nEternal God. \u201cFor it was the good pleasure of the Father that in Him\nshould all the fullness dwell;\u201d \u201cFor in Him dwelleth all the fullness\nof the Godhead bodily.\u201d And it is also true that \u201cIn Him ye are made\nfull\u201d with respect to every desire divinely implanted and normally\nfollowed.\nHaggai calls him \u201cThe Desire of all nations,\u201d and we may well\ncall him \u201cThe Desire of all ages,\u201d even as He is \u201cThe King of ages.\u201d\nIt is the purpose of this book to set forth Jesus Christ as the one\nin whom every longing may be satisfied. There is many a \u201cLife of\nChrist\u201d written, excellent books, large funds of information, elabo-\nrate essays on chronology and contemporaneous history, customs,\nand events, with much of the teaching and many glimpses of the\nmany-sided life of Jesus of Nazareth. Yet it may be truly said, \u201cthe\nhalf has never been told.\u201d\niii\nIt is not, however, the purpose of this work to set forth a harmony\nof the gospels, or even to give in strictly chronological order the im-\nportant events and wonderful lessons of the life of Christ; its purpose\nis to present the love of God as revealed in his Son, the divine beauty\nof the life of Christ, of which all may partake, and not to satisfy the\ndesires of the merely curious nor the questionings of critics. But\neven as by the attraction of His own goodness of character Jesus\ndrew His disciples unto Himself, and by His personal presence, by\nHis sympathetic touch and feeling in all their infirmities and needs,\nand by His constant association, transformed their characters from\nthe earthly to the heavenly, from the selfish to the sacrificing, from\nsmallhearted ignorance and prejudice to largehearted knowledge and\nprofound love for souls of all nations and races, even so it is the\npurpose of this book so to present the blessed Redeemer as to help\nthe reader to come to Him face to face, heart to heart, and find in\nHim, even as did the disciples of old, Jesus the Mighty One, who\nsaves \u201cto the uttermost,\u201d and transforms to His own divine image\nall those who come unto God by Him. Yet how impossible it is to\nreveal His life! It is like attempting to put upon canvas the living\nrainbow; into characters of black and white the sweetest music.\nIn the following pages the author, a woman of large and deep\nand long experience in the things of God, has set forth new beauties\nfrom the life of Jesus. She has brought many new gems from the\nprecious casket. She opens before the reader undreamed-of riches\nfrom this infinite treasure house. New and glorious light flashes\nforth from many a familiar passage, the depth of which the reader\nsupposed he had long before fathomed. To state it in brief, Jesus\nChrist is revealed as the Fullness of the Godhead, the infinitely\nmerciful Saviour of sinners, the Sun of Righteousness, the merciful\nHigh Priest, the Healer of all human maladies and diseases, the\ntender, compassionate Friend, the constant, ever-present and helpful\nCompanion, the Prince of the House of David, the Shield of His\npeople, the Prince of Peace, the Coming King, the Everlasting Father,\nthe culmination and fruition of the desires and hopes of all the ages.\nUnder the blessing of God this book is given to the world with\nthe prayer that the Lord by His Spirit will make the words of this\nbook words of life to many souls whose longings and desires are yet\nunsatisfied; that they \u201cmay know Him, and the power of His resur-\nrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings,\u201d and finally, throughout\na blessed eternity, at His right hand, share in \u201cthat fullness of joy,\u201d\nand \u201cpleasures forevermore,\u201d which will be the ripened fruitage of\nall those who find in Him the all in all, \u201cthe Chiefest among ten\nthousand,\u201d and \u201cthe One altogether lovely.\u201d\nPublishers.\nContents\nInformation about this Book . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i\nPreface . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iii\nChapter 1\u2014\u201cGod With Us\u201d . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\nChapter 2\u2014The Chosen People . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\nChapter 3\u2014\u201cThe Fullness of the Time\u201d . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\nChapter 4\u2014Unto You a Saviour . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27\nChapter 5\u2014The Dedication . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32\nChapter 6\u2014\u201cWe Have Seen His Star\u201d . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39\nChapter 7\u2014As a Child . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 46\nChapter 8\u2014The Passover Visit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 53\nChapter 9\u2014Days of Conflict . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 61\nChapter 10\u2014The V oice in the Wilderness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 69\nChapter 11\u2014The Baptism . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 81\nChapter 12\u2014The Temptation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 86\nChapter 13\u2014The Victory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 96\nChapter 14\u2014\u201cWe Have Found the Messias\u201d . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 102\nChapter 15\u2014At the Marriage Feast. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 113\nChapter 16\u2014In His Temple . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 122\nChapter 17\u2014Nicodemus . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 133\nChapter 18\u2014\u201cHe Must Increase\u201d . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 142\nChapter 19\u2014At Jacob\u2019s Well . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 146\nChapter 20\u2014\u201cExcept Ye See Signs and Wonders\u201d . . . . . . . . . 157\nChapter 21\u2014Bethesda and the Sanhedrin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 161\nChapter 22\u2014Imprisonment and Death of John . . . . . . . . . . . . 175\nChapter 23\u2014\u201cThe Kingdom of God Is at Hand\u201d . . . . . . . . . . . 187\nChapter 24\u2014\u201cIs Not This the Carpenter\u2019s Son?\u201d . . . . . . . . . . 192\nChapter 25\u2014The Call by the Sea . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 200\nChapter 26\u2014At Capernaum . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 206\nChapter 27\u2014\u201cThou Canst Make Me Clean\u201d . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 216\nChapter 28\u2014Levi-Matthew . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 226\nChapter 29\u2014The Sabbath . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 235\nChapter 30\u2014\u201cHe Ordained Twelve\u201d . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 243\nChapter 31\u2014The Sermon on the Mount . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 251\nChapter 32\u2014The Centurion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 267\nvi\nContents vii\nChapter 33\u2014Who Are My Brethren?

God with us.\u201d \u201cThe light\nof the knowledge of the glory of God\u201d is seen \u201cin the face of Jesus\nChrist.\u201d From the days of eternity the Lord Jesus Christ was one with\nthe Father; He was \u201cthe image of God,\u201d the image of His greatness\nand majesty, \u201cthe outshining of His glory.\u201d It was to manifest this\nglory that He came to our world. To this sin-darkened earth He came\nto reveal the light of God\u2019s love,\u2014to be \u201cGod with us.\u201d Therefore it\nwas prophesied of Him, \u201cHis name shall be called Immanuel.\u201d\nBy coming to dwell with us, Jesus was to reveal God both to\nmen and to angels. He was the Word of God,\u2014God\u2019s thought made\naudible. In His prayer for His disciples He says, \u201cI have declared\nunto them Thy name,\u201d\u2014\u201cmerciful and gracious, long-suffering, and\nabundant in goodness and truth,\u201d\u2014\u201cthat the love wherewith Thou\nhast loved Me may be in them, and I in them.\u201d But not alone for His\nearthborn children was this revelation given. Our little world is the\nlesson book of the universe. God\u2019s wonderful purpose of grace, the\nmystery of redeeming love, is the theme into which \u201cangels desire\nto look,\u201d and it will be their study throughout endless ages. Both\nthe redeemed and the unfallen beings will find in the cross of Christ [20]\ntheir science and their song. It will be seen that the glory shining\nin the face of Jesus is the glory of self-sacrificing love. In the light\nfrom Calvary it will be seen that the law of self-renouncing love is\nthe law of life for earth and heaven; that the love which \u201cseeketh not\nher own\u201d has its source in the heart of God; and that in the meek and\nlowly One is manifested the character of Him who dwelleth in the\nlight which no man can approach unto.\nIn the beginning, God was revealed in all the works of creation.\nIt was Christ that spread the heavens, and laid the foundations of the\nearth. It was His hand that hung the worlds in space, and fashioned\nthe flowers of the field. \u201cHis strength setteth fast the mountains.\u201d\n\u201cThe sea is His, and He made it.\u201d Psalm 65:6; 95:5. It was He\nthat filled the earth with beauty, and the air with song. And upon\n9\n10 The Desire of Ages\nall things in earth, and air, and sky, He wrote the message of the\nFather\u2019s love.\nNow sin has marred God\u2019s perfect work, yet that handwriting\nremains. Even now all created things declare the glory of His ex-\ncellence. There is nothing, save the selfish heart of man, that lives\nunto itself. No bird that cleaves the air, no animal that moves upon\nthe ground, but ministers to some other life. There is no leaf of the\nforest, or lowly blade of grass, but has its ministry. Every tree and\nshrub and leaf pours forth that element of life without which neither\nman nor animal could live; and man and animal, in turn, minister to\nthe life of tree and shrub and leaf. The flowers breathe fragrance and\nunfold their beauty in blessing to the world. The sun sheds its light [21]\nto gladden a thousand worlds. The ocean, itself the source of all\nour springs and fountains, receives the streams from every land, but\ntakes to give. The mists ascending from its bosom fall in showers to\nwater the earth, that it may bring forth and bud.\nThe angels of glory find their joy in giving,\u2014giving love and\ntireless watchcare to souls that are fallen and unholy. Heavenly\nbeings woo the hearts of men; they bring to this dark world light\nfrom the courts above; by gentle and patient ministry they move\nupon the human spirit, to bring the lost into a fellowship with Christ\nwhich is even closer than they themselves can know.\nBut turning from all lesser representations, we behold God in\nJesus. Looking unto Jesus we see that it is the glory of our God\nto give. \u201cI do nothing of Myself,\u201d said Christ; \u201cthe living Father\nhath sent Me, and I live by the Father.\u201d \u201cI seek not Mine own glory,\u201d\nbut the glory of Him that sent Me. John 8:28; 6:57; 8:50; 7:18. In\nthese words is set forth the great principle which is the law of life\nfor the universe. All things Christ received from God, but He took\nto give. So in the heavenly courts, in His ministry for all created\nbeings: through the beloved Son, the Father\u2019s life flows out to all;\nthrough the Son it returns, in praise and joyous service, a tide of\nlove, to the great Source of all. And thus through Christ the circuit\nof beneficence is complete, representing the character of the great\nGiver, the law of life.\nIn heaven itself this law was broken. Sin originated in self-\nseeking. Lucifer, the covering cherub, desired to be first in heaven.\nHe sought to gain control of heavenly beings, to draw them away\n\u201cGod With Us\u201d 11\nfrom their Creator, and to win their homage to himself. Therefore he\nmisrepresented God, attributing to Him the desire for self-exaltation. [22]\nWith his own evil characteristics he sought to invest the loving\nCreator. Thus he deceived angels. Thus he deceived men. He\nled them to doubt the word of God, and to distrust His goodness.\nBecause God is a God of justice and terrible majesty, Satan caused\nthem to look upon Him as severe and unforgiving. Thus he drew\nmen to join him in rebellion against God, and the night of woe settled\ndown upon the world.\nThe earth was dark through misapprehension of God. That\nthe gloomy shadows might be lightened, that the world might be\nbrought back to God, Satan\u2019s deceptive power was to be broken.\nThis could not be done by force. The exercise of force is contrary to\nthe principles of God\u2019s government; He desires only the service of\nlove; and love cannot be commanded; it cannot be won by force or\nauthority. Only by love is love awakened. To know God is to love\nHim; His character must be manifested in contrast to the character of\nSatan. This work only one Being in all the universe could do. Only\nHe who knew the height and depth of the love of God could make it\nknown. Upon the world\u2019s dark night the Sun of Righteousness must\nrise, \u201cwith healing in His wings.\u201d Malachi 4:2.\nThe plan for our redemption was not an afterthought, a plan\nformulated after the fall of Adam. It was a revelation of \u201cthe mystery\nwhich hath been kept in silence through times eternal.\u201d Romans\n16:25, R. V . It was an unfolding of the principles that from eternal\nages have been the foundation of God\u2019s throne. From the beginning,\nGod and Christ knew of the apostasy of Satan, and of the fall of man\nthrough the deceptive power of the apostate. God did not ordain that\nsin should exist, but He foresaw its existence, and made provision to\nmeet the terrible emergency. So great was His love for the world,\nthat He covenanted to give His only-begotten Son, \u201cthat whosoever\nbelieveth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John\n3:16.\nLucifer had said, \u201cI will exalt my throne above the stars of God;\n... I will be like the Most High.\u201d Isaiah 14:13, 14. But Christ, \u201cbeing\nin the form of God, counted it not a thing to be grasped to be on\nan equality with God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a\n12 The Desire of Ages\nservant, being made in the likeness of men.\u201d Philippians 2:6, 7, R.\nV ., margin.\nThis was a voluntary sacrifice. Jesus might have remained at the\nFather\u2019s side. He might have retained the glory of heaven, and the\nhomage of the angels. But He chose to give back the scepter into the[23]\nFather\u2019s hands, and to step down from the throne of the universe,\nthat He might bring light to the benighted, and life to the perishing.\nNearly two thousand years ago, a voice of mysterious import was\nheard in heaven, from the throne of God, \u201cLo, I come.\u201d \u201cSacrifice\nand offering Thou wouldest not, but a body hast Thou prepared\nMe.... Lo, I come (in the volume of the Book it is written of Me,) to\ndo Thy will, O God.\u201d Hebrews 10:5-7. In these words is announced\nthe fulfillment of the purpose that had been hidden from eternal ages.\nChrist was about to visit our world, and to become incarnate. He\nsays, \u201cA body hast Thou prepared Me.\u201d Had He appeared with the\nglory that was His with the Father before the world was, we could\nnot have endured the light of His presence. That we might behold it\nand not be destroyed, the manifestation of His glory was shrouded.\nHis divinity was veiled with humanity,\u2014the invisible glory in the\nvisible human form.\nThis great purpose had been shadowed forth in types and sym-\nbols. The burning bush, in which Christ appeared to Moses, revealed\nGod. The symbol chosen for the representation of the Deity was a\nlowly shrub, that seemingly had no attractions. This enshrined the\nInfinite. The all-merciful God shrouded His glory in a most humble\ntype, that Moses could look upon it and live. So in the pillar of cloud\nby day and the pillar of fire by night, God communicated with Israel,\nrevealing to men His will, and imparting to them His grace. God\u2019s\nglory was subdued, and His majesty veiled, that the weak vision of\nfinite men might behold it. So Christ was to come in \u201cthe body of\nour humiliation\u201d (Philippians 3:21, R. V .), \u201cin the likeness of men.\u201d\nIn the eyes of the world He possessed no beauty that they should\ndesire Him; yet He was the incarnate God, the light of heaven and\nearth. His glory was veiled, His greatness and majesty were hidden,\nthat He might draw near to sorrowful, tempted men.\nGod commanded Moses for Israel, \u201cLet them make Me a sanc-\ntuary; that I may dwell among them\u201d (Exodus 25:8), and He abode\nin the sanctuary, in the midst of His people. Through all their weary\n\u201cGod With Us\u201d 13\nwandering in the desert, the symbol of His presence was with them.\nSo Christ set up His tabernacle in the midst of our human encamp-\nment. He pitched His tent by the side of the tents of men, that He\nmight dwell among us, and make us familiar with His divine char-\nacter and life. \u201cThe Word became flesh, and tabernacled among us\n(and we beheld His glory, glory as of the Only Begotten from the [24]\nFather), full of grace and truth.\u201d John 1:14, R. V ., margin.\nSince Jesus came to dwell with us, we know that God is ac-\nquainted with our trials, and sympathizes with our griefs. Every son\nand daughter of Adam may understand that our Creator is the friend\nof sinners. For in every doctrine of grace, every promise of joy,\nevery deed of love, every divine attraction presented in the Saviour\u2019s\nlife on earth, we see \u201cGod with us.\u201d\nSatan represents God\u2019s law of love as a law of selfishness. He\ndeclares that it is impossible for us to obey its precepts. The fall\nof our first parents, with all the woe that has resulted, he charges\nupon the Creator, leading men to look upon God as the author of\nsin, and suffering, and death. Jesus was to unveil this deception.\nAs one of us He was to give an example of obedience. For this He\ntook upon Himself our nature, and passed through our experiences.\n\u201cIn all things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren.\u201d\nHebrews 2:17. If we had to bear anything which Jesus did not\nendure, then upon this point Satan would represent the power of God\nas insufficient for us. Therefore Jesus was \u201cin all points tempted like\nas we are.\u201d Hebrews 4:15. He endured every trial to which we are\nsubject. And He exercised in His own behalf no power that is not\nfreely offered to us. As man, He met temptation, and overcame in\nthe strength given Him from God. He says, \u201cI delight to do Thy will,\nO My God: yea, Thy law is within My heart.\u201d Psalm 40:8. As He\nwent about doing good, and healing all who were afflicted by Satan,\nHe made plain to men the character of God\u2019s law and the nature of\nHis service. His life testifies that it is possible for us also to obey the\nlaw of God.\nBy His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He\nlays hold upon the throne of God. As the Son of man, He gave us an\nexample of obedience; as the Son of God, He gives us power to obey.\nIt was Christ who from the bush on Mount Horeb spoke to Moses\nsaying, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.... Thus shalt thou say unto the children\n14 The Desire of Ages\nof Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.\u201d Exodus 3:14. This was the\npledge of Israel\u2019s deliverance. So when He came \u201cin the likeness of\nmen,\u201d He declared Himself the I AM. The Child of Bethlehem, the\nmeek and lowly Saviour, is God \u201cmanifest in the flesh.\u201d 1 Timothy\n3:16. And to us He says: \u201cI AM the Good Shepherd.\u201d \u201cI AM the\nliving Bread.\u201d \u201cI AM the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\u201d \u201cAll power\nis given unto Me in heaven and in earth.\u201d John 10:11; 6:51; 14:6;[25]\nMatthew 28:18. I AM the assurance of every promise. I AM; be not\nafraid. \u201cGod with us\u201d is the surety of our deliverance from sin, the\nassurance of our power to obey the law of heaven.\nIn stooping to take upon Himself humanity, Christ revealed a\ncharacter the opposite of the character of Satan. But He stepped\nstill lower in the path of humiliation. \u201cBeing found in fashion as a\nman, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even\nthe death of the cross.\u201d Philippians 2:8. As the high priest laid aside\nhis gorgeous pontifical robes, and officiated in the white linen dress\nof the common priest, so Christ took the form of a servant, and\noffered sacrifice, Himself the priest, Himself the victim. \u201cHe was\nwounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities:\nthe chastisement of our peace was upon Him.\u201d Isaiah 53:5.\nChrist was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as He\ndeserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which He had no share,\nthat we might be justified by His righteousness, in which we had no\nshare. He suffered the death which was ours, that we might receive\nthe life which was His. \u201cWith His stripes we are healed.\u201d\nBy His life and His death, Christ has achieved even more than\nrecovery from the ruin wrought through sin. It was Satan\u2019s purpose\nto bring about an eternal separation between God and man; but\nin Christ we become more closely united to God than if we had\nnever fallen. In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself\nto humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal\nages He is linked with us. \u201cGod so loved the world, that He gave\nHis only-begotten Son.\u201d John 3:16. He gave Him not only to bear\nour sins, and to die as our sacrifice; He gave Him to the fallen race.\nTo assure us of His immutable counsel of peace, God gave His\nonly-begotten Son to become one of the human family, forever to\nretain His human nature. This is the pledge that God will fulfill\nHis word. \u201cUnto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the\n\u201cGod With Us\u201d 15\ngovernment shall be upon His shoulder.\u201d God has adopted human\nnature in the person of His Son, and has carried the same into the\nhighest heaven. It is the \u201cSon of man\u201d who shares the throne of\nthe universe. It is the \u201cSon of man\u201d whose name shall be called,\n\u201cWonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father,\nThe Prince of Peace.\u201d Isaiah 9:6. The I AM is the Daysman between\nGod and humanity, laying His hand upon both. He who is \u201choly,\nharmless, undefiled, separate from sinners,\u201d is not ashamed to call us\nbrethren. Hebrews 7:26; 2:11. In Christ the family of earth and the\nfamily of heaven are bound together. Christ glorified is our brother. [26]\nHeaven is enshrined in humanity, and humanity is enfolded in the\nbosom of Infinite Love.\nOf His people God says, \u201cThey shall be as the stones of a crown,\nlifted up as an ensign upon His land. For how great is His goodness,\nand how great is His beauty!\u201d Zechariah 9:16, 17. The exaltation\nof the redeemed will be an eternal testimony to God\u2019s mercy. \u201cIn\nthe ages to come,\u201d He will \u201cshow the exceeding riches of His grace\nin His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.\u201d \u201cTo the intent that\n... unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places\nmight be made known ... the manifold wisdom of God, according\nto the eternal purpose which He purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d\nEphesians 2:7; 3:10, 11, R. V .\nThrough Christ\u2019s redeeming work the government of God stands\njustified. The Omnipotent One is made known as the God of love.\nSatan\u2019s charges are refuted, and his character unveiled. Rebellion can\nnever again arise. Sin can never again enter the universe. Through\neternal ages all are secure from apostasy. By love\u2019s self-sacrifice, the\ninhabitants of earth and heaven are bound to their Creator in bonds\nof indissoluble union.\nThe work of redemption will be complete. In the place where\nsin abounded, God\u2019s grace much more abounds. The earth itself, the\nvery field that Satan claims as his, is to be not only ransomed but\nexalted. Our little world, under the curse of sin the one dark blot\nin His glorious creation, will be honored above all other worlds in\nthe universe of God. Here, where the Son of God tabernacled in\nhumanity; where the King of glory lived and suffered and died,\u2014\nhere, when He shall make all things new, the tabernacle of God shall\nbe with men, \u201cand He will dwell with them, and they shall be His\n16 The Desire of Ages\npeople, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their God.\u201d And\nthrough endless ages as the redeemed walk in the light of the Lord,\nthey will praise Him for His unspeakable Gift,\u2014\nImmanuel, \u201cGod with us\u201c.\nChapter 2\u2014The Chosen People [27]\nFor more than a thousand years the Jewish people had awaited\nthe Saviour\u2019s coming. Upon this event they had rested their brightest\nhopes. In song and prophecy, in temple rite and household prayer,\nthey had enshrined His name. And yet at His coming they knew\nHim not. The Beloved of heaven was to them \u201cas a root out of a dry\nground;\u201d He had \u201cno form nor comeliness;\u201d and they saw in Him no\nbeauty that they should desire Him. \u201cHe came unto His own, and\nHis own received Him not.\u201d Isaiah 53:2; John 1:11.\nYet God had chosen Israel. He had called them to preserve\namong men the knowledge of His law, and of the symbols and\nprophecies that pointed to the Saviour. He desired them to be as\nwells of salvation to the world. What Abraham was in the land of\nhis sojourn, what Joseph was in Egypt, and Daniel in the courts of\nBabylon, the Hebrew people were to be among the nations. They\nwere to reveal God to men.\nIn the call of Abraham the Lord had said, \u201cI will bless thee; ...\nand thou shalt be a blessing: ... and in thee shall all families of the\nearth be blessed.\u201d Genesis 12:2, 3. The same teaching was repeated\nthrough the prophets. Even after Israel had been wasted by war and\ncaptivity, the promise was theirs, \u201cThe remnant of Jacob shall be in\nthe midst of many people as a dew from the Lord, as the showers\nupon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons\nof men.\u201d Micah 5:7. Concerning the temple at Jerusalem, the Lord\ndeclared through Isaiah, \u201cMine house shall be called an house of\nprayer for all peoples.\u201d Isaiah 56:7, R. V .\nBut the Israelites fixed their hopes upon worldly greatness. From [28]\nthe time of their entrance to the land of Canaan, they departed from\nthe commandments of God, and followed the ways of the heathen. It\nwas in vain that God sent them warning by His prophets. In vain they\nsuffered the chastisement of heathen oppression. Every reformation\nwas followed by deeper apostasy.\n17\n18 The Desire of Ages\nHad Israel been true to God, He could have accomplished His\npurpose through their honor and exaltation. If they had walked in\nthe ways of obedience, He would have made them \u201chigh above all\nnations which He hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor.\u201d\n\u201cAll people of the earth,\u201d said Moses, \u201cshall see that thou art called by\nthe name of the Lord; and they shall be afraid of thee.\u201d \u201cThe nations\nwhich shall hear all these statutes\u201d shall say, \u201cSurely this great\nnation is a wise and understanding people.\u201d Deuteronomy 26:19;\n28:10; Deuteronomy 4:6. But because of their unfaithfulness, God\u2019s\npurpose could be wrought out only through continued adversity and\nhumiliation.\nThey were brought into subjection to Babylon, and scattered\nthrough the lands of the heathen. In affliction many renewed their\nfaithfulness to His covenant. While they hung their harps upon the\nwillows, and mourned for the holy temple that was laid waste, the\nlight of truth shone out through them, and a knowledge of God was\nspread among the nations. The heathen systems of sacrifice were a\nperversion of the system that God had appointed; and many a sincere\nobserver of heathen rites learned from the Hebrews the meaning of\nthe service divinely ordained, and in faith grasped the promise of a\nRedeemer.\nMany of the exiles suffered persecution. Not a few lost their\nlives because of their refusal to disregard the Sabbath and to observe\nthe heathen festivals. As idolaters were roused to crush out the truth,\nthe Lord brought His servants face to face with kings and rulers, that\nthey and their people might receive the light. Time after time the\ngreatest monarchs were led to proclaim the supremacy of the God\nwhom their Hebrew captives worshiped.\nBy the Babylonish captivity the Israelites were effectually cured\nof the worship of graven images. During the centuries that fol-\nlowed, they suffered from the oppression of heathen foes, until the\nconviction became fixed that their prosperity depended upon their\nobedience to the law of God. But with too many of the people obe-\ndience was not prompted by love. The motive was selfish. They\nrendered outward service to God as the means of attaining to na-[29]\ntional greatness. They did not become the light of the world, but\nshut themselves away from the world in order to escape temptation\nto idolatry. In the instruction given through Moses, God had placed\nChosen People 19\nrestrictions upon their association with idolaters; but this teaching\nhad been misinterpreted. It was intended to prevent them from con-\nforming to the practices of the heathen. But it was used to build\nup a wall of separation between Israel and all other nations. The\nJews looked upon Jerusalem as their heaven, and they were actually\njealous lest the Lord should show mercy to the Gentiles.\nAfter the return from Babylon, much attention was given to re-\nligious instruction. All over the country, synagogues were erected,\nwhere the law was expounded by the priests and scribes. And schools\nwere established, which, together with the arts and sciences, pro-\nfessed to teach the principles of righteousness. But these agencies\nbecame corrupted. During the captivity, many of the people had re-\nceived heathen ideas and customs, and these were brought into their\nreligious service. In many things they conformed to the practices of\nidolaters.\nAs they departed from God, the Jews in a great degree lost sight\nof the teaching of the ritual service. That service had been instituted\nby Christ Himself. In every part it was a symbol of Him; and it\nhad been full of vitality and spiritual beauty. But the Jews lost the\nspiritual life from their ceremonies, and clung to the dead forms.\nThey trusted to the sacrifices and ordinances themselves, instead\nof resting upon Him to whom they pointed. In order to supply the\nplace of that which they had lost, the priests and rabbis multiplied\nrequirements of their own; and the more rigid they grew, the less of\nthe love of God was manifested. They measured their holiness by\nthe multitude of their ceremonies, while their hearts were filled with\npride and hypocrisy.\nWith all their minute and burdensome injunctions, it was an\nimpossibility to keep the law. Those who desired to serve God, and\nwho tried to observe the rabbinical precepts, toiled under a heavy\nburden. They could find no rest from the accusings of a troubled\nconscience. Thus Satan worked to discourage the people, to lower\ntheir conception of the character of God, and to bring the faith of\nIsrael into contempt. He hoped to establish the claim put forth when\nhe rebelled in heaven,\u2014that the requirements of God were unjust,\nand could not be obeyed. Even Israel, he declared, did not keep the\nlaw.\n20 The Desire of Ages\nWhile the Jews desired the advent of the Messiah, they had no\ntrue conception of His mission. They did not seek redemption from[30]\nsin, but deliverance from the Romans. They looked for the Messiah\nto come as a conqueror, to break the oppressor\u2019s power, and exalt\nIsrael to universal dominion. Thus the way was prepared for them\nto reject the Saviour.\nAt the time of the birth of Christ the nation was chafing under\nthe rule of her foreign masters, and racked with internal strife. The\nJews had been permitted to maintain the form of a separate gov-\nernment; but nothing could disguise the fact that they were under\nthe Roman yoke, or reconcile them to the restriction of their power.\nThe Romans claimed the right of appointing and removing the high\npriest, and the office was often secured by fraud, bribery, and even\nmurder. Thus the priesthood became more and more corrupt. Yet the\npriests still possessed great power, and they employed it for selfish\nand mercenary ends. The people were subjected to their merciless\ndemands, and were also heavily taxed by the Romans. This state\nof affairs caused widespread discontent. Popular outbreaks were\nfrequent. Greed and violence, distrust and spiritual apathy, were\neating out the very heart of the nation.\nHatred of the Romans, and national and spiritual pride, led the\nJews still to adhere rigorously to their forms of worship. The priests\ntried to maintain a reputation for sanctity by scrupulous attention\nto the ceremonies of religion. The people, in their darkness and\noppression, and the rulers, thirsting for power, longed for the coming\nof One who would vanquish their enemies and restore the kingdom\nto Israel. They had studied the prophecies, but without spiritual\ninsight. Thus they overlooked those scriptures that point to the\nhumiliation of Christ\u2019s first advent, and misapplied those that speak\nof the glory of His second coming. Pride obscured their vision. They\ninterpreted prophecy in accordance with their selfish desires.\nChapter 3\u2014\u201cThe Fullness of the Time\u201d [31]\n\u201cWhen the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His\nSon, ... to redeem them that were under the law, that we might\nreceive the adoption of sons.\u201d Galatians 4:4, 5.\nThe Saviour\u2019s coming was foretold in Eden. When Adam and\nEve first heard the promise, they looked for its speedy fulfillment.\nThey joyfully welcomed their first-born son, hoping that he might be\nthe Deliverer. But the fulfillment of the promise tarried. Those who\nfirst received it died without the sight. From the days of Enoch the\npromise was repeated through patriarchs and prophets, keeping alive\nthe hope of His appearing, and yet He came not. The prophecy of\nDaniel revealed the time of His advent, but not all rightly interpreted\nthe message. Century after century passed away; the voices of the\nprophets ceased. The hand of the oppressor was heavy upon Israel,\nand many were ready to exclaim, \u201cThe days are prolonged, and\nevery vision faileth.\u201d Ezekiel 12:22.\nBut like the stars in the vast circuit of their appointed path, God\u2019s [32]\npurposes know no haste and no delay. Through the symbols of\nthe great darkness and the smoking furnace, God had revealed to\nAbraham the bondage of Israel in Egypt, and had declared that the\ntime of their sojourning should be four hundred years. \u201cAfterward,\u201d\nHe said, \u201cshall they come out with great substance.\u201d Genesis 15:14.\nAgainst that word, all the power of Pharaoh\u2019s proud empire battled\nin vain. On \u201cthe self-same day\u201d appointed in the divine promise, \u201cit\ncame to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land\nof Egypt.\u201d Exodus 12:41. So in heaven\u2019s council the hour for the\ncoming of Christ had been determined. When the great clock of\ntime pointed to that hour, Jesus was born in Bethlehem.\n\u201cWhen the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His\nSon.\u201d Providence had directed the movements of nations, and the\ntide of human impulse and influence, until the world was ripe for\nthe coming of the Deliverer. The nations were united under one\ngovernment. One language was widely spoken, and was everywhere\n21\n22 The Desire of Ages\nrecognized as the language of literature. From all lands the Jews of\nthe dispersion gathered to Jerusalem to the annual feasts. As these\nreturned to the places of their sojourn, they could spread throughout\nthe world the tidings of the Messiah\u2019s coming.\nAt this time the systems of heathenism were losing their hold\nupon the people. Men were weary of pageant and fable. They\nlonged for a religion that could satisfy the heart. While the light of\ntruth seemed to have departed from among men, there were souls\nwho were looking for light, and who were filled with perplexity and\nsorrow. They were thirsting for a knowledge of the living God, for\nsome assurance of a life beyond the grave.\nAs the Jews had departed from God, faith had grown dim, and\nhope had well-nigh ceased to illuminate the future. The words of the\nprophets were uncomprehended. To the masses of the people, death\nwas a dread mystery; beyond was uncertainty and gloom. It was\nnot alone the wailing of the mothers of Bethlehem, but the cry from\nthe great heart of humanity, that was borne to the prophet across the\ncenturies,\u2014the voice heard in Ramah, \u201clamentation, and weeping,\nand great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not\nbe comforted, because they are not.\u201d Matthew 2:18. In \u201cthe region\nand shadow of death,\u201d men sat unsolaced. With longing eyes they\nlooked for the coming of the Deliverer, when the darkness should[33]\nbe dispelled, and the mystery of the future should be made plain.\nOutside of the Jewish nation there were men who foretold the\nappearance of a divine instructor. These men were seeking for truth,\nand to them the Spirit of Inspiration was imparted. One after another,\nlike stars in the darkened heavens, such teachers had arisen. Their\nwords of prophecy had kindled hope in the hearts of thousands of\nthe Gentile world.\nFor hundreds of years the Scriptures had been translated into\nthe Greek language, then widely spoken throughout the Roman\nEmpire. The Jews were scattered everywhere, and their expectation\nof the Messiah\u2019s coming was to some extent shared by the Gentiles.\nAmong those whom the Jews styled heathen were men who had\na better understanding of the Scripture prophecies concerning the\nMessiah than had the teachers in Israel. There were some who hoped\nfor His coming as a deliverer from sin. Philosophers endeavored\nto study into the mystery of the Hebrew economy. But the bigotry\n\u201cThe Fullness of the Time\u201d 23\nof the Jews hindered the spread of the light. Intent on maintaining\nthe separation between themselves and other nations, they were\nunwilling to impart the knowledge they still possessed concerning\nthe symbolic service. The true Interpreter must come. The One [34]\nwhom all these types prefigured must explain their significance.\nThrough nature, through types and symbols, through patriarchs\nand prophets, God had spoken to the world. Lessons must be given\nto humanity in the language of humanity. The Messenger of the\ncovenant must speak. His voice must be heard in His own temple.\nChrist must come to utter words which should be clearly and defi-\nnitely understood. He, the author of truth, must separate truth from\nthe chaff of man\u2019s utterance, which had made it of no effect. The\nprinciples of God\u2019s government and the plan of redemption must be\nclearly defined. The lessons of the Old Testament must be fully set\nbefore men.\nAmong the Jews there were yet steadfast souls, descendants of\nthat holy line through whom a knowledge of God had been preserved.\nThese still looked for the hope of the promise made unto the fathers.\nThey strengthened their faith by dwelling upon the assurance given\nthrough Moses, \u201cA Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto\nyou of your brethren, like unto me; Him shall ye hear in all things\nwhatsoever He shall say unto you.\u201d Acts 3:22. Again, they read how\nthe Lord would anoint One \u201cto preach good tidings unto the meek,\u201d\n\u201cto bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,\u201d\nand to declare the \u201cacceptable year of the Lord.\u201d Isaiah 61:1, 2. They\nread how He would \u201cset judgment in the earth,\u201d how the isles should\n\u201cwait for His law,\u201d how the Gentiles should come to His light, and\nkings to the brightness of His rising. Isaiah 42:4; 60:3.\nThe dying words of Jacob filled them with hope: \u201cThe scepter\nshall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet,\nuntil Shiloh come.\u201d Genesis 49:10. The waning power of Israel\ntestified that the Messiah\u2019s coming was at hand. The prophecy of\nDaniel pictured the glory of His reign over an empire which should\nsucceed all earthly kingdoms; and, said the prophet, \u201cIt shall stand\nforever.\u201d Daniel 2:44. While few understood the nature of Christ\u2019s\nmission, there was a widespread expectation of a mighty prince who\nshould establish his kingdom in Israel, and who should come as a\ndeliverer to the nations.\n24 The Desire of Ages\nThe fullness of the time had come. Humanity, becoming more\ndegraded through ages of transgression, called for the coming of\nthe Redeemer. Satan had been working to make the gulf deep\nand impassable between earth and heaven. By his falsehoods he\nhad emboldened men in sin. It was his purpose to wear out the[35]\nforbearance of God, and to extinguish His love for man, so that He\nwould abandon the world to satanic jurisdiction.\nSatan was seeking to shut out from men a knowledge of God, to\nturn their attention from the temple of God, and to establish his own\nkingdom. His strife for supremacy had seemed to be almost wholly\nsuccessful. It is true that in every generation God had His agencies.\nEven among the heathen there were men through whom Christ was\nworking to uplift the people from their sin and degradation. But\nthese men were despised and hated. Many of them suffered a violent\ndeath. The dark shadow that Satan had cast over the world grew\ndeeper and deeper.\nThrough heathenism, Satan had for ages turned men away from\nGod; but he won his great triumph in perverting the faith of Israel. By\ncontemplating and worshiping their own conceptions, the heathen\nhad lost a knowledge of God, and had become more and more\ncorrupt. So it was with Israel. The principle that man can save\nhimself by his own works lay at the foundation of every heathen\nreligion; it had now become the principle of the Jewish religion.[36]\nSatan had implanted this principle. Wherever it is held, men have\nno barrier against sin.\nThe message of salvation is communicated to men through hu-\nman agencies. But the Jews had sought to make a monopoly of the\ntruth which is eternal life. They had hoarded the living manna, and it\nhad turned to corruption. The religion which they tried to shut up to\nthemselves became an offense. They robbed God of His glory, and\ndefrauded the world by a counterfeit of the gospel. They had refused\nto surrender themselves to God for the salvation of the world, and\nthey became agents of Satan for its destruction.\nThe people whom God had called to be the pillar and ground\nof the truth had become representatives of Satan. They were doing\nthe work that he desired them to do, taking a course to misrepresent\nthe character of God, and cause the world to look upon Him as a\ntyrant. The very priests who ministered in the temple had lost sight\n\u201cThe Fullness of the Time\u201d 25\nof the significance of the service they performed. They had ceased\nto look beyond the symbol to the thing signified. In presenting the\nsacrificial offerings they were as actors in a play. The ordinances\nwhich God Himself had appointed were made the means of blinding\nthe mind and hardening the heart. God could do no more for man\nthrough these channels. The whole system must be swept away.\nThe deception of sin had reached its height. All the agencies for\ndepraving the souls of men had been put in operation. The Son of\nGod, looking upon the world, beheld suffering and misery. With pity\nHe saw how men had become victims of satanic cruelty. He looked\nwith compassion upon those who were being corrupted, murdered,\nand lost. They had chosen a ruler who chained them to his car as\ncaptives. Bewildered and deceived, they were moving on in gloomy\nprocession toward eternal ruin,\u2014to death in which is no hope of life,\ntoward night to which comes no morning. Satanic agencies were\nincorporated with men. The bodies of human beings, made for the\ndwelling place of God, had become the habitation of demons. The\nsenses, the nerves, the passions, the organs of men, were worked\nby supernatural agencies in the indulgence of the vilest lust. The\nvery stamp of demons was impressed upon the countenances of men.\nHuman faces reflected the expression of the legions of evil with\nwhich they were possessed. Such was the prospect upon which the\nworld\u2019s Redeemer looked. What a spectacle for Infinite Purity to\nbehold!\nSin had become a science, and vice was consecrated as a part [37]\nof religion. Rebellion had struck its roots deep into the heart, and\nthe hostility of man was most violent against heaven. It was demon-\nstrated before the universe that, apart from God, humanity could not\nbe uplifted. A new element of life and power must be imparted by\nHim who made the world.\nWith intense interest the unfallen worlds had watched to see\nJehovah arise, and sweep away the inhabitants of the earth. And if\nGod should do this, Satan was ready to carry out his plan for securing\nto himself the allegiance of heavenly beings. He had declared that the\nprinciples of God\u2019s government make forgiveness impossible. Had\nthe world been destroyed, he would have claimed that his accusations\nwere proved true. He was ready to cast blame upon God, and to\nspread his rebellion to the worlds above. But instead of destroying\n26 The Desire of Ages\nthe world, God sent His Son to save it. Though corruption and\ndefiance might be seen in every part of the alien province, a way for\nits recovery was provided. At the very crisis, when Satan seemed\nabout to triumph, the Son of God came with the embassage of divine\ngrace. Through every age, through every hour, the love of God had\nbeen exercised toward the fallen race. Notwithstanding the perversity\nof men, the signals of mercy had been continually exhibited. And\nwhen the fullness of the time had come, the Deity was glorified by\npouring upon the world a flood of healing grace that was never to be\nobstructed or withdrawn till the plan of salvation should be fulfilled.\nSatan was exulting that he had succeeded in debasing the image\nof God in humanity. Then Jesus came to restore in man the image of\nhis Maker. None but Christ can fashion anew the character that has[38]\nbeen ruined by sin. He came to expel the demons that had controlled\nthe will. He came to lift us up from the dust, to reshape the marred\ncharacter after the pattern of His divine character, and to make it\nbeautiful with His own glory.\nChapter 4\u2014Unto You a Saviour [39]\n[40]\n[41]\n[42]\n[43]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 2:1-20.\nThe King of glory stooped low to take humanity. Rude and\nforbidding were His earthly surroundings. His glory was veiled,\nthat the majesty of His outward form might not become an object\nof attraction. He shunned all outward display. Riches, worldly\nhonor, and human greatness can never save a soul from death; Jesus\npurposed that no attraction of an earthly nature should call men to\nHis side. Only the beauty of heavenly truth must draw those who\nwould follow Him. The character of the Messiah had long been\nforetold in prophecy, and He desired men to accept Him upon the\ntestimony of the word of God.\nThe angels had wondered at the glorious plan of redemption.\nThey watched to see how the people of God would receive His Son,\nclothed in the garb of humanity. Angels came to the land of the\nchosen people. Other nations were dealing in fables and worshiping\nfalse gods. To the land where the glory of God had been revealed, and\nthe light of prophecy had shone, the angels came. They came unseen\nto Jerusalem, to the appointed expositors of the Sacred Oracles, and\nthe ministers of God\u2019s house. Already to Zacharias the priest, as he [44]\nministered before the altar, the nearness of Christ\u2019s coming had been\nannounced. Already the forerunner was born, his mission attested\nby miracle and prophecy. The tidings of his birth and the wonderful\nsignificance of his mission had been spread abroad. Yet Jerusalem\nwas not preparing to welcome her Redeemer.\nWith amazement the heavenly messengers beheld the indiffer-\nence of that people whom God had called to communicate to the\nworld the light of sacred truth. The Jewish nation had been preserved\nas a witness that Christ was to be born of the seed of Abraham and of\nDavid\u2019s line; yet they knew not that His coming was now at hand. In\nthe temple the morning and the evening sacrifice daily pointed to the\nLamb of God; yet even here was no preparation to receive Him. The\n27\n28 The Desire of Ages\npriests and teachers of the nation knew not that the greatest event of\nthe ages was about to take place. They rehearsed their meaningless\nprayers, and performed the rites of worship to be seen by men, but in\ntheir strife for riches and worldly honor they were not prepared for\nthe revelation of the Messiah. The same indifference pervaded the\nland of Israel. Hearts selfish and world-engrossed were untouched\nby the joy that thrilled all heaven. Only a few were longing to behold\nthe Unseen. To these heaven\u2019s embassy was sent.\nAngels attend Joseph and Mary as they journey from their home\nin Nazareth to the city of David. The decree of imperial Rome for\nthe enrollment of the peoples of her vast dominion has extended\nto the dwellers among the hills of Galilee. As in old time Cyrus\nwas called to the throne of the world\u2019s empire that he might set free\nthe captives of the Lord, so Caesar Augustus is made the agent for\nthe fulfillment of God\u2019s purpose in bringing the mother of Jesus to\nBethlehem. She is of the lineage of David, and the Son of David\nmust be born in David\u2019s city. Out of Bethlehem, said the prophet,\n\u201cshall He come forth ... that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings\nforth have been from of old, from the days of eternity.\u201d Micah 5:2,\nmargin. But in the city of their royal line, Joseph and Mary are\nunrecognized and unhonored. Weary and homeless, they traverse\nthe entire length of the narrow street, from the gate of the city to\nthe eastern extremity of the town, vainly seeking a resting place for\nthe night. There is no room for them at the crowded inn. In a rude\nbuilding where the beasts are sheltered, they at last find refuge, and\nhere the Redeemer of the world is born.\nMen know it not, but the tidings fill heaven with rejoicing. With[45]\n[46]\n[47]\na deeper and more tender interest the holy beings from the world\nof light are drawn to the earth. The whole world is brighter for His\npresence. Above the hills of Bethlehem are gathered an innumerable\nthrong of angels. They wait the signal to declare the glad news to the\nworld. Had the leaders in Israel been true to their trust, they might\nhave shared the joy of heralding the birth of Jesus. But now they are\npassed by.\nGod declares, \u201cI will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and\nfloods upon the dry ground.\u201d \u201cUnto the upright there ariseth light in\nthe darkness.\u201d Isaiah 44:3; Psalm 112:4. To those who are seeking\nUnto You a Saviour 29\nfor light, and who accept it with gladness, the bright rays from the\nthrone of God will shine.\nIn the fields where the boy David had led his flock, shepherds\nwere still keeping watch by night. Through the silent hours they\ntalked together of the promised Saviour, and prayed for the coming\nof the King to David\u2019s throne. \u201cAnd, lo, the angel of the Lord came\nupon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and\nthey were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for,\nbehold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all\npeople. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,\nwhich is Christ the Lord.\u201d\nAt these words, visions of glory fill the minds of the listening\nshepherds. The Deliverer has come to Israel! Power, exaltation,\ntriumph, are associated with His coming. But the angel must prepare\nthem to recognize their Saviour in poverty and humiliation. \u201cThis\nshall be a sign unto you,\u201d he says; \u201cYe shall find the babe wrapped\nin swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.\u201d\nThe heavenly messenger had quieted their fears. He had told\nthem how to find Jesus. With tender regard for their human weakness,\nhe had given them time to become accustomed to the divine radiance. [48]\nThen the joy and glory could no longer be hidden. The whole plain\nwas lighted up with the bright shining of the hosts of God. Earth\nwas hushed, and heaven stooped to listen to the song,\u2014\n\u201cGlory to God in the highest,\nAnd on earth peace, good will toward men.\u201d\nOh that today the human family could recognize that song! The\ndeclaration then made, the note then struck, will swell to the close\nof time, and resound to the ends of the earth. When the Sun of\nRighteousness shall arise, with healing in His wings, that song will\nbe re-echoed by the voice of a great multitude, as the voice of many\nwaters, saying, \u201cAlleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.\u201d\nRevelation 19:6.\nAs the angels disappeared, the light faded away, and the shadows\nof night once more fell on the hills of Bethlehem. But the brightest\npicture ever beheld by human eyes remained in the memory of the\nshepherds. \u201cAnd it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from\n30 The Desire of Ages\nthem into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now\ngo even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass,\nwhich the Lord hath made known unto us. And they came with\nhaste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.\u201d\nDeparting with great joy, they made known the things they had\nseen and heard. \u201cAnd all they that heard it wondered at those things\nwhich were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these\nthings, and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds returned,\nglorifying and praising God.\u201d\nHeaven and earth are no wider apart today than when shepherds\nlistened to the angels\u2019 song. Humanity is still as much the object of\nheaven\u2019s solicitude as when common men of common occupations\nmet angels at noonday, and talked with the heavenly messengers\nin the vineyards and the fields. To us in the common walks of life,\nheaven may be very near. Angels from the courts above will attend\nthe steps of those who come and go at God\u2019s command.\nThe story of Bethlehem is an exhaustless theme. In it is hidden\n\u201cthe depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God.\u201d\nRomans 11:33. We marvel at the Saviour\u2019s sacrifice in exchanging\nthe throne of heaven for the manger, and the companionship of\nadoring angels for the beasts of the stall. Human pride and self-[49]\nsufficiency stand rebuked in His presence. Yet this was but the\nbeginning of His wonderful condescension. It would have been an\nalmost infinite humiliation for the Son of God to take man\u2019s nature,\neven when Adam stood in his innocence in Eden. But Jesus accepted\nhumanity when the race had been weakened by four thousand years\nof sin. Like every child of Adam He accepted the results of the\nworking of the great law of heredity. What these results were is\nshown in the history of His earthly ancestors. He came with such\na heredity to share our sorrows and temptations, and to give us the\nexample of a sinless life.\nSatan in heaven had hated Christ for His position in the courts of\nGod. He hated Him the more when he himself was dethroned. He\nhated Him who pledged Himself to redeem a race of sinners. Yet\ninto the world where Satan claimed dominion God permitted His\nSon to come, a helpless babe, subject to the weakness of humanity.\nHe permitted Him to meet life\u2019s peril in common with every human\nUnto You a Saviour 31\nsoul, to fight the battle as every child of humanity must fight it, at\nthe risk of failure and eternal loss.\nThe heart of the human father yearns over his son. He looks into\nthe face of his little child, and trembles at the thought of life\u2019s peril.\nHe longs to shield his dear one from Satan\u2019s power, to hold him back\nfrom temptation and conflict. To meet a bitterer conflict and a more\nfearful risk, God gave His only-begotten Son, that the path of life\nmight be made sure for our little ones. \u201cHerein is love.\u201d Wonder, O\nheavens! and be astonished, O earth!\nChapter 5\u2014The Dedication[50]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 2:21-38.\nAbout forty days after the birth of Christ, Joseph and Mary took\nHim to Jerusalem, to present Him to the Lord, and to offer sacrifice.\nThis was according to the Jewish law, and as man\u2019s substitute Christ\nmust conform to the law in every particular. He had already been\nsubjected to the rite of circumcision, as a pledge of His obedience\nto the law.\nAs an offering for the mother, the law required a lamb of the first\nyear for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a\nsin offering. But the law provided that if the parents were too poor\nto bring a lamb, a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for\na burnt offering, the other for a sin offering, might be accepted.\nThe offerings presented to the Lord were to be without blemish.\nThese offerings represented Christ, and from this it is evident that\nJesus Himself was free from physical deformity. He was the \u201clamb\nwithout blemish and without spot.\u201d 1 Peter 1:19. His physical struc-\nture was not marred by any defect; His body was strong and healthy.\nAnd throughout His lifetime He lived in conformity to nature\u2019s laws.\nPhysically as well as spiritually, He was an example of what God[51]\ndesigned all humanity to be through obedience to His laws.\nThe dedication of the first-born had its origin in the earliest\ntimes. God had promised to give the First-born of heaven to save\nthe sinner. This gift was to be acknowledged in every household by\nthe consecration of the first-born son. He was to be devoted to the\npriesthood, as a representative of Christ among men.\nIn the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, the dedication of the first-\nborn was again commanded. While the children of Israel were in\nbondage to the Egyptians, the Lord directed Moses to go to Pharaoh,\nking of Egypt, and say, \u201cThus saith the Lord, Israel is My son, even\nMy first-born: and I say unto thee, Let My son go, that he may serve\n32\nDedication 33\nMe: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even\nthy first-born.\u201d Exodus 4:22, 23.\nMoses delivered his message; but the proud king\u2019s answer was,\n\u201cWho is the Lord, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I\nknow not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.\u201d Exodus 5:2. The\nLord worked for His people by signs and wonders, sending terrible\njudgments upon Pharaoh. At length the destroying angel was bidden\nto slay the first-born of man and beast among the Egyptians. That\nthe Israelites might be spared, they were directed to place upon their\ndoorposts the blood of a slain lamb. Every house was to be marked,\nthat when the angel came on his mission of death, he might pass\nover the homes of the Israelites.\nAfter sending this judgment upon Egypt, the Lord said to Moses,\n\u201cSanctify unto Me all the first-born, ... both of man and of beast: it\nis Mine;\u201d \u201cfor on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of\nEgypt I hallowed unto Me all the first-born in Israel, both man and\nbeast: Mine shall they be: I am the Lord.\u201d Exodus 13:2; Numbers\n3:13. After the tabernacle service was established, the Lord chose\nthe tribe of Levi in the place of the first-born of all Israel to minister\nin the sanctuary. But the first-born were still to be regarded as the\nLord\u2019s, and were to be bought back by a ransom.\nThus the law for the presentation of the first-born was made\nparticularly significant. While it was a memorial of the Lord\u2019s\nwonderful deliverance of the children of Israel, it prefigured a greater\ndeliverance, to be wrought out by the only-begotten Son of God.\nAs the blood sprinkled on the doorposts had saved the first-born of\nIsrael, so the blood of Christ has power to save the world.\nWhat meaning then was attached to Christ\u2019s presentation! But [52]\nthe priest did not see through the veil; he did not read the mystery\nbeyond. The presentation of infants was a common scene. Day after\nday the priest received the redemption money as the babes were\npresented to the Lord. Day after day he went through the routine\nof his work, giving little heed to the parents or children, unless\nhe saw some indication of the wealth or high rank of the parents.\nJoseph and Mary were poor; and when they came with their child,\nthe priests saw only a man and woman dressed as Galileans, and in\nthe humblest garments. There was nothing in their appearance to\n34 The Desire of Ages\nattract attention, and they presented only the offering made by the\npoorer classes.\nThe priest went through the ceremony of his official work. He\ntook the child in his arms, and held it up before the altar. After\nhanding it back to its mother, he inscribed the name \u201cJesus\u201d on the\nroll of the first-born. Little did he think, as the babe lay in his arms,\nthat it was the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory. The priest did\nnot think that this babe was the One of whom Moses had written, \u201cA\nProphet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren,\nlike unto me; Him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever He shall\nsay unto you.\u201d Acts 3:22. He did not think that this babe was He\nwhose glory Moses had asked to see. But One greater than Moses\nlay in the priest\u2019s arms; and when he enrolled the child\u2019s name,\nhe was enrolling the name of One who was the foundation of the\nwhole Jewish economy. That name was to be its death warrant; for\nthe system of sacrifices and offerings was waxing old; the type had\nalmost reached its antitype, the shadow its substance.\nThe Shekinah had departed from the sanctuary, but in the Child\nof Bethlehem was veiled the glory before which angels bow. This\nunconscious babe was the promised seed, to whom the first altar at\nthe gate of Eden pointed. This was Shiloh, the peace giver. It was\nHe who declared Himself to Moses as the I AM. It was He who in\nthe pillar of cloud and of fire had been the guide of Israel. This was\nHe whom seers had long foretold. He was the Desire of all nations,\nthe Root and the Offspring of David, and the Bright and Morning\nStar. The name of that helpless little babe, inscribed in the roll of\nIsrael, declaring Him our brother, was the hope of fallen humanity.\nThe child for whom the redemption money had been paid was He\nwho was to pay the ransom for the sins of the whole world. He\nwas the true \u201chigh priest over the house of God,\u201d the head of \u201can\nunchangeable priesthood,\u201d the intercessor at \u201cthe right hand of the[53]\n[54]\n[55]\nMajesty on high.\u201d Hebrews 10:21; 7:24; 1:3.\nSpiritual things are spiritually discerned. In the temple the Son\nof God was dedicated to the work He had come to do. The priest\nlooked upon Him as he would upon any other child. But though he\nneither saw nor felt anything unusual, God\u2019s act in giving His Son\nto the world was acknowledged. This occasion did not pass without\nsome recognition of Christ. \u201cThere was a man in Jerusalem, whose\nDedication 35\nname was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting\nfor the Consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.\nAnd it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not\nsee death, before he had seen the Lord\u2019s Christ.\u201d\nAs Simeon enters the temple, he sees a family presenting their\nfirst-born son before the priest. Their appearance bespeaks poverty;\nbut Simeon understands the warnings of the Spirit, and he is deeply\nimpressed that the infant being presented to the Lord is the Consola-\ntion of Israel, the One he has longed to see. To the astonished priest,\nSimeon appears like a man enraptured. The child has been returned\nto Mary, and he takes it in his arms and presents it to God, while\na joy that he has never before felt enters his soul. As he lifts the\ninfant Saviour toward heaven, he says, \u201cLord, now lettest Thou Thy\nservant depart in peace, according to Thy word: for mine eyes have\nseen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all\npeople; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people\nIsrael.\u201d\nThe spirit of prophecy was upon this man of God, and while\nJoseph and Mary stood by, wondering at his words, he blessed\nthem, and said unto Mary, \u201cBehold, this child is set for the fall and\nrising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken\nagainst; (yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that\nthe thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.\u201d\nAnna also, a prophetess, came in and confirmed Simeon\u2019s testi-\nmony concerning Christ. As Simeon spoke, her face lighted up with\nthe glory of God, and she poured out her heartfelt thanks that she\nhad been permitted to behold Christ the Lord.\nThese humble worshipers had not studied the prophecies in vain.\nBut those who held positions as rulers and priests in Israel, though\nthey too had before them the precious utterances of prophecy, were\nnot walking in the way of the Lord, and their eyes were not open to\nbehold the Light of life.\nSo it is still. Events upon which the attention of all heaven [56]\nis centered are undiscerned, their very occurrence is unnoticed,\nby religious leaders, and worshipers in the house of God. Men\nacknowledge Christ in history, while they turn away from the living\nChrist. Christ in His word calling to self-sacrifice, in the poor and\nsuffering who plead for relief, in the righteous cause that involves\n36 The Desire of Ages\npoverty and toil and reproach, is no more readily received today than\nHe was eighteen hundred years ago.\nMary pondered the broad and far-reaching prophecy of Simeon.\nAs she looked upon the child in her arms, and recalled the words\nspoken by the shepherds of Bethlehem, she was full of grateful joy\nand bright hope. Simeon\u2019s words called to her mind the prophetic\nutterances of Isaiah: \u201cThere shall come forth a rod out of the stem of\nJesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: and the Spirit of the\nLord shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding,\nthe spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the\nfear of the Lord.... And righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins,\nand faithfulness the girdle of His reins.\u201d \u201cThe people that walked\nin darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of\nthe shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.... For unto\nus a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall\nbe upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called Wonderful,\nCounselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of\nPeace.\u201d Isaiah 11:1-5; 9:2-6.\nYet Mary did not understand Christ\u2019s mission. Simeon had\nprophesied of Him as a light to lighten the Gentiles, as well as a\nglory to Israel. Thus the angels had announced the Saviour\u2019s birth as\ntidings of joy to all peoples. God was seeking to correct the narrow,\nJewish conception of the Messiah\u2019s work. He desired men to behold\nHim, not merely as the deliverer of Israel, but as the Redeemer of the\nworld. But many years must pass before even the mother of Jesus\nwould understand His mission.\nMary looked forward to the Messiah\u2019s reign on David\u2019s throne,\nbut she saw not the baptism of suffering by which it must be won.\nThrough Simeon it is revealed that the Messiah is to have no unob-\nstructed passage through the world. In the words to Mary, \u201cA sword\nshall pierce through thy own soul also,\u201d God in His tender mercy\ngives to the mother of Jesus an intimation of the anguish that already\nfor His sake she had begun to bear.\n\u201cBehold,\u201d Simeon had said, \u201cthis child is set for the fall and\nrising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken\nagainst.\u201d They must fall who would rise again. We must fall upon the[57]\nRock and be broken before we can be uplifted in Christ. Self must\nbe dethroned, pride must be humbled, if we would know the glory\nDedication 37\nof the spiritual kingdom. The Jews would not accept the honor that\nis reached through humiliation. Therefore they would not receive\ntheir Redeemer. He was a sign that was spoken against.\n\u201cThat the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.\u201d In the light\nof the Saviour\u2019s life, the hearts of all, even from the Creator to the\nprince of darkness, are revealed. Satan has represented God as selfish\nand oppressive, as claiming all, and giving nothing, as requiring the\nservice of His creatures for His own glory, and making no sacrifice\nfor their good. But the gift of Christ reveals the Father\u2019s heart. It\ntestifies that the thoughts of God toward us are \u201cthoughts of peace,\nand not of evil.\u201d Jeremiah 29:11. It declares that while God\u2019s hatred\nof sin is as strong as death, His love for the sinner is stronger than\ndeath. Having undertaken our redemption, He will spare nothing,\nhowever dear, which is necessary to the completion of His work.\nNo truth essential to our salvation is withheld, no miracle of mercy\nis neglected, no divine agency is left unemployed. Favor is heaped\nupon favor, gift upon gift. The whole treasury of heaven is open to\nthose He seeks to save. Having collected the riches of the universe,\nand laid open the resources of infinite power, He gives them all into\nthe hands of Christ, and says, All these are for man. Use these gifts\nto convince him that there is no love greater than Mine in earth or\nheaven. His greatest happiness will be found in loving Me.\nAt the cross of Calvary, love and selfishness stood face to face.\nHere was their crowning manifestation. Christ had lived only to\ncomfort and bless, and in putting Him to death, Satan manifested\nthe malignity of his hatred against God. He made it evident that the\nreal purpose of his rebellion was to dethrone God, and to destroy\nHim through whom the love of God was shown.\nBy the life and the death of Christ, the thoughts of men also are\nbrought to view. From the manger to the cross, the life of Jesus was\na call to self-surrender, and to fellowship in suffering. It unveiled\nthe purposes of men. Jesus came with the truth of heaven, and all\nwho were listening to the voice of the Holy Spirit were drawn to\nHim. The worshipers of self belonged to Satan\u2019s kingdom. In their\nattitude toward Christ, all would show on which side they stood.\nAnd thus everyone passes judgment on himself.\nIn the day of final judgment, every lost soul will understand the [58]\nnature of his own rejection of truth. The cross will be presented, and\n38 The Desire of Ages\nits real bearing will be seen by every mind that has been blinded\nby transgression. Before the vision of Calvary with its mysterious\nVictim, sinners will stand condemned. Every lying excuse will be\nswept away. Human apostasy will appear in its heinous character.\nMen will see what their choice has been. Every question of truth\nand error in the long-standing controversy will then have been made\nplain. In the judgment of the universe, God will stand clear of blame\nfor the existence or continuance of evil. It will be demonstrated that\nthe divine decrees are not accessory to sin. There was no defect in\nGod\u2019s government, no cause for disaffection. When the thoughts\nof all hearts shall be revealed, both the loyal and the rebellious will\nunite in declaring, \u201cJust and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints.\nWho shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? ... for Thy\njudgments are made manifest.\u201d Revelation 15:3, 4.\nChapter 6\u2014\u201cWe Have Seen His Star\u201d [59]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 2.\n\u201cNow when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days\nof Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the East to\nJerusalem, saying, Where is He that is born King of the Jews? for\nwe have seen His star in the East, and are come to worship Him.\u201d\nThe wise men from the East were philosophers. They belonged\nto a large and influential class that included men of noble birth, and\ncomprised much of the wealth and learning of their nation. Among\nthese were many who imposed on the credulity of the people. Others\nwere upright men who studied the indications of Providence in\nnature, and who were honored for their integrity and wisdom. Of\nthis character were the wise men who came to Jesus.\nThe light of God is ever shining amid the darkness of heathenism.\nAs these magi studied the starry heavens, and sought to fathom the\nmystery hidden in their bright paths, they beheld the glory of the\nCreator. Seeking clearer knowledge, they turned to the Hebrew\nScriptures. In their own land were treasured prophetic writings that\npredicted the coming of a divine teacher. Balaam belonged to the\nmagicians, though at one time a prophet of God; by the Holy Spirit\nhe had foretold the prosperity of Israel and the appearing of the\nMessiah; and his prophecies had been handed down by tradition [60]\nfrom century to century. But in the Old Testament the Saviour\u2019s\nadvent was more clearly revealed. The magi learned with joy that\nHis coming was near, and that the whole world was to be filled with\na knowledge of the glory of the Lord.\nThe wise men had seen a mysterious light in the heavens upon\nthat night when the glory of God flooded the hills of Bethlehem. As\nthe light faded, a luminous star appeared, and lingered in the sky. It\nwas not a fixed star nor a planet, and the phenomenon excited the\nkeenest interest. That star was a distant company of shining angels,\nbut of this the wise men were ignorant. Yet they were impressed\n39\n40 The Desire of Ages\nthat the star was of special import to them. They consulted priests\nand philosophers, and searched the scrolls of the ancient records.\nThe prophecy of Balaam had declared, \u201cThere shall come a Star\nout of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel.\u201d Numbers 24:17.\nCould this strange star have been sent as a harbinger of the Promised\nOne? The magi had welcomed the light of heaven-sent truth; now\nit was shed upon them in brighter rays. Through dreams they were\ninstructed to go in search of the newborn Prince.\nAs by faith Abraham went forth at the call of God, \u201cnot knowing\nwhither he went\u201d (Hebrews 11:8); as by faith Israel followed the\npillar of cloud to the Promised Land, so did these Gentiles go forth\nto find the promised Saviour. The Eastern country abounded in\nprecious things, and the magi did not set out empty-handed. It was\nthe custom to offer presents as an act of homage to princes or other\npersonages of rank, and the richest gifts the land afforded were borne\nas an offering to Him in whom all the families of the earth were to\nbe blessed. It was necessary to journey by night in order to keep\nthe star in view; but the travelers beguiled the hours by repeating\ntraditional sayings and prophetic utterances concerning the One they\nsought. At every pause for rest they searched the prophecies; and the\nconviction deepened that they were divinely guided. While they had\nthe star before them as an outward sign, they had also the inward\nevidence of the Holy Spirit, which was impressing their hearts, and\ninspiring them with hope. The journey, though long, was a happy\none to them.\nThey have reached the land of Israel, and are descending the\nMount of Olives, with Jerusalem in sight, when, lo, the star that has\nguided them all the weary way rests above the temple, and after a\nseason fades from their view. With eager steps they press onward,\nconfidently expecting the Messiah\u2019s birth to be the joyful burden of\nevery tongue. But their inquiries are in vain. Entering the holy city,[61]\nthey repair to the temple. To their amazement they find none who\nseem to have a knowledge of the newborn king. Their questions\ncall forth no expressions of joy, but rather of surprise and fear, not\nunmingled with contempt.\nThe priests are rehearsing traditions. They extol their religion\nand their own piety, while they denounce the Greeks and Romans as\nheathen, and sinners above others. The wise men are not idolaters,\n\u201cWe Have Seen His Star\u201d 41\nand in the sight of God they stand far higher than do these, His\nprofessed worshipers; yet they are looked upon by the Jews as\nheathen. Even among the appointed guardians of the Holy Oracles\ntheir eager questionings touch no chord of sympathy.\nThe arrival of the magi was quickly noised throughout Jerusalem.\nTheir strange errand created an excitement among the people, which\npenetrated to the palace of King Herod. The wily Edomite was\naroused at the intimation of a possible rival. Countless murders had\nstained his pathway to the throne. Being of alien blood, he was hated\nby the people over whom he ruled. His only security was the favor\nof Rome. But this new Prince had a higher claim. He was born to\nthe kingdom.\nHerod suspected the priests of plotting with the strangers to ex-\ncite a popular tumult and unseat him from the throne. He concealed\nhis mistrust, however, determined to thwart their schemes by su-\nperior cunning. Summoning the chief priests and the scribes, he\nquestioned them as to the teaching of their sacred books in regard to [62]\nthe place of the Messiah\u2019s birth.\nThis inquiry from the usurper of the throne, and made at the\nrequest of strangers, stung the pride of the Jewish teachers. The\nindifference with which they turned to the rolls of prophecy enraged\nthe jealous tyrant. He thought them trying to conceal their knowl-\nedge of the matter. With an authority they dared not disregard, he\ncommanded them to make close search, and to declare the birthplace\nof their expected King. \u201cAnd they said unto him, In Bethlehem of\nJudea: for thus it is written by the prophet,\n\u201cAnd thou Bethlehem, land of Judah,\nArt in nowise least among the princes of Judah:\nFor out of thee shall come forth a governor,\nWhich shall be shepherd of My people Israel.\u201d",

      "text": "Herod now invited the magi to a private interview. A tempest\nof wrath and fear was raging in his heart, but he preserved a calm\nexterior, and received the strangers courteously. He inquired at\nwhat time the star had appeared, and professed to hail with joy\nthe intimation of the birth of Christ. He bade his visitors, \u201cSearch\n42 The Desire of Ages\ndiligently for the young child; and when ye have found Him, bring\nme word again, that I may come and worship Him also.\u201d So saying,\nhe dismissed them to go on their way to Bethlehem.\nThe priests and elders of Jerusalem were not as ignorant concern-\ning the birth of Christ as they pretended. The report of the angels\u2019\nvisit to the shepherds had been brought to Jerusalem, but the rabbis\nhad treated it as unworthy of their notice. They themselves might\nhave found Jesus, and might have been ready to lead the magi to\nHis birthplace; but instead of this, the wise men came to call their\nattention to the birth of the Messiah. \u201cWhere is He that is born King\nof the Jews?\u201d they said; \u201cfor we have seen His star in the East, and\nare come to worship Him.\u201d\nNow pride and envy closed the door against the light. If the\nreports brought by the shepherds and the wise men were credited,\nthey would place the priests and rabbis in a most unenviable position,\ndisproving their claim to be the exponents of the truth of God. These\nlearned teachers would not stoop to be instructed by those whom\nthey termed heathen. It could not be, they said, that God had passed\nthem by, to communicate with ignorant shepherds or uncircumcised[63]\nGentiles. They determined to show their contempt for the reports\nthat were exciting King Herod and all Jerusalem. They would not\neven go to Bethlehem to see whether these things were so. And they\nled the people to regard the interest in Jesus as a fanatical excitement.\nHere began the rejection of Christ by the priests and rabbis. From\nthis point their pride and stubbornness grew into a settled hatred of\nthe Saviour. While God was opening the door to the Gentiles, the\nJewish leaders were closing the door to themselves.\nThe wise men departed alone from Jerusalem. The shadows\nof night were falling as they left the gates, but to their great joy\nthey again saw the star, and were directed to Bethlehem. They had\nreceived no such intimation of the lowly estate of Jesus as was given\nto the shepherds. After the long journey they had been disappointed\nby the indifference of the Jewish leaders, and had left Jerusalem less\nconfident than when they entered the city. At Bethlehem they found\nno royal guard stationed to protect the newborn King. None of the\nworld\u2019s honored men were in attendance. Jesus was cradled in a\nmanger. His parents, uneducated peasants, were His only guardians.\nCould this be He of whom it was written, that He should \u201craise up\n\u201cWe Have Seen His Star\u201d 43\nthe tribes of Jacob,\u201d and \u201crestore the preserved of Israel;\u201d that He\nshould be \u201ca light to the Gentiles,\u201d and for \u201csalvation unto the end\nof the earth\u201d? Isaiah 49:6.\n\u201cWhen they were come into the house, they saw the young child\nwith Mary His mother, and fell down, and worshiped Him.\u201d Beneath\nthe lowly guise of Jesus, they recognized the presence of Divinity.\nThey gave their hearts to Him as their Saviour, and then poured out\ntheir gifts,\u2014\u201cgold, and frankincense, and myrrh.\u201d What a faith was\ntheirs! It might have been said of the wise men from the East, as [64]\nafterward of the Roman centurion, \u201cI have not found so great faith,\nno, not in Israel.\u201d Matthew 8:10.\nThe wise men had not penetrated Herod\u2019s design toward Jesus.\nWhen the object of their journey was accomplished, they prepared\nto return to Jerusalem, intending to acquaint him with their success.\nBut in a dream they received a divine message to hold no further\ncommunication with him. Avoiding Jerusalem, they set out for their\nown country by another route.\nIn like manner Joseph received warning to flee into Egypt with\nMary and the child. And the angel said, \u201cBe thou there until I bring\nthee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy Him.\u201d\nJoseph obeyed without delay, setting out on the journey by night for\ngreater security.\nThrough the wise men, God had called the attention of the Jewish\nnation to the birth of His Son. Their inquiries in Jerusalem, the\npopular interest excited, and even the jealousy of Herod, which\ncompelled the attention of the priests and rabbis, directed minds to\nthe prophecies concerning the Messiah, and to the great event that\nhad just taken place.\nSatan was bent on shutting out the divine light from the world, [65]\nand he used his utmost cunning to destroy the Saviour. But He who\nnever slumbers nor sleeps was watching over His beloved Son. He\nwho had rained manna from heaven for Israel and had fed Elijah in\nthe time of famine provided in a heathen land a refuge for Mary and\nthe child Jesus. And through the gifts of the magi from a heathen\ncountry, the Lord supplied the means for the journey into Egypt and\nthe sojourn in a land of strangers.\nThe magi had been among the first to welcome the Redeemer.\nTheir gift was the first that was laid at His feet. And through that\n44 The Desire of Ages\ngift, what privilege of ministry was theirs! The offering from the\nheart that loves, God delights to honor, giving it highest efficiency\nin service for Him. If we have given our hearts to Jesus, we also\nshall bring our gifts to Him. Our gold and silver, our most precious\nearthly possessions, our highest mental and spiritual endowments,\nwill be freely devoted to Him who loved us, and gave Himself for\nus.\nHerod in Jerusalem impatiently awaited the return of the wise\nmen. As time passed, and they did not appear, his suspicions were\nroused. The unwillingness of the rabbis to point out the Messiah\u2019s\nbirthplace seemed to indicate that they had penetrated his design,\nand that the magi had purposely avoided him. He was maddened\nat the thought. Craft had failed, but there was left the resort to\nforce. He would make an example of this child-king. Those haughty\nJews should see what they might expect in their attempts to place a\nmonarch on the throne.\nSoldiers were at once sent to Bethlehem, with orders to put to\ndeath all the children of two years and under. The quiet homes of\nthe city of David witnessed those scenes of horror that, six hundred\nyears before, had been opened to the prophet. \u201cIn Ramah was there a\nvoice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel\nweeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they\nare not.\u201d\nThis calamity the Jews had brought upon themselves. If they had\nbeen walking in faithfulness and humility before God, He would\nin a signal manner have made the wrath of the king harmless to\nthem. But they had separated themselves from God by their sins,\nand had rejected the Holy Spirit, which was their only shield. They\nhad not studied the Scriptures with a desire to conform to the will of\nGod. They had searched for prophecies which could be interpreted\nto exalt themselves, and to show how God despised all other nations.\nIt was their proud boast that the Messiah was to come as a king,[66]\nconquering His enemies, and treading down the heathen in His\nwrath. Thus they had excited the hatred of their rulers. Through\ntheir misrepresentation of Christ\u2019s mission, Satan had purposed to\ncompass the destruction of the Saviour; but instead of this, it returned\nupon their own heads.\n\u201cWe Have Seen His Star\u201d 45\nThis act of cruelty was one of the last that darkened the reign\nof Herod. Soon after the slaughter of the innocents, he was himself\ncompelled to yield to that doom which none can turn aside. He died\na fearful death.\nJoseph, who was still in Egypt, was now bidden by an angel of\nGod to return to the land of Israel. Regarding Jesus as the heir of\nDavid\u2019s throne, Joseph desired to make his home in Bethlehem; but\nlearning that Archelaus reigned in Judea in his father\u2019s stead, he\nfeared that the father\u2019s designs against Christ might be carried out\nby the son. Of all the sons of Herod, Archelaus most resembled him\nin character. Already his succession to the government had been\nmarked by a tumult in Jerusalem, and the slaughter of thousands of\nJews by the Roman guards.\nAgain Joseph was directed to a place of safety. He returned to\nNazareth, his former home, and here for nearly thirty years Jesus\ndwelt, \u201cthat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets,\nHe shall be called a Nazarene.\u201d Galilee was under the control of a son\nof Herod, but it had a much larger admixture of foreign inhabitants\nthan Judea. Thus there was less interest in matters relating especially [67]\nto the Jews, and the claims of Jesus would be less likely to excite\nthe jealousy of those in power.\nSuch was the Saviour\u2019s reception when He came to the earth.\nThere seemed to be no place of rest or safety for the infant Redeemer.\nGod could not trust His beloved Son with men, even while carrying\nforward His work for their salvation. He commissioned angels to\nattend Jesus and protect Him till He should accomplish His mission\non earth, and die by the hands of those whom He came to save.\nChapter 7\u2014As a Child[68]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 2:39, 40.\nThe childhood and youth of Jesus were spent in a little mountain\nvillage. There was no place on earth that would not have been\nhonored by His presence. The palaces of kings would have been\nprivileged in receiving Him as a guest. But He passed by the homes\nof wealth, the courts of royalty, and the renowned seats of learning,\nto make His home in obscure and despised Nazareth.\nWonderful in its significance is the brief record of His early life:\n\u201cThe child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and\nthe grace of God was upon Him.\u201d In the sunlight of His Father\u2019s\ncountenance, Jesus \u201cincreased in wisdom and stature, and in favor\nwith God and man.\u201d Luke 2:52. His mind was active and penetrat-\ning, with a thoughtfulness and wisdom beyond His years. Yet His\ncharacter was beautiful in its symmetry. The powers of mind and\nbody developed gradually, in keeping with the laws of childhood.\nAs a child, Jesus manifested a peculiar loveliness of disposition.\nHis willing hands were ever ready to serve others. He manifested\na patience that nothing could disturb, and a truthfulness that would[69]\nnever sacrifice integrity. In principle firm as a rock, His life revealed\nthe grace of unselfish courtesy.\nWith deep earnestness the mother of Jesus watched the unfolding\nof His powers, and beheld the impress of perfection upon His char-\nacter. With delight she sought to encourage that bright, receptive\nmind. Through the Holy Spirit she received wisdom to co-operate\nwith the heavenly agencies in the development of this child, who\ncould claim only God as His Father.\nFrom the earliest times the faithful in Israel had given much care\nto the education of the youth. The Lord had directed that even from\nbabyhood the children should be taught of His goodness and His\ngreatness, especially as revealed in His law, and shown in the history\nof Israel. Song and prayer and lessons from the Scriptures were to be\n46\nAs a Child 47\nadapted to the opening mind. Fathers and mothers were to instruct\ntheir children that the law of God is an expression of His character,\nand that as they received the principles of the law into the heart, the\nimage of God was traced on mind and soul. Much of the teaching\nwas oral; but the youth also learned to read the Hebrew writings;\nand the parchment rolls of the Old Testament Scriptures were open\nto their study.\nIn the days of Christ the town or city that did not provide for the\nreligious instruction of the young was regarded as under the curse\nof God. Yet the teaching had become formal. Tradition had in a\ngreat degree supplanted the Scriptures. True education would lead\nthe youth to \u201cseek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him, and\nfind Him.\u201d Acts 17:27. But the Jewish teachers gave their attention\nto matters of ceremony. The mind was crowded with material that\nwas worthless to the learner, and that would not be recognized in the\nhigher school of the courts above. The experience which is obtained\nthrough a personal acceptance of God\u2019s word had no place in the\neducational system. Absorbed in the round of externals, the students\nfound no quiet hours to spend with God. They did not hear His\nvoice speaking to the heart. In their search after knowledge, they\nturned away from the Source of wisdom. The great essentials of\nthe service of God were neglected. The principles of the law were\nobscured. That which was regarded as superior education was the\ngreatest hindrance to real development. Under the training of the\nrabbis the powers of the youth were repressed. Their minds became\ncramped and narrow.\nThe child Jesus did not receive instruction in the synagogue [70]\nschools. His mother was His first human teacher. From her lips\nand from the scrolls of the prophets, He learned of heavenly things.\nThe very words which He Himself had spoken to Moses for Israel\nHe was now taught at His mother\u2019s knee. As He advanced from\nchildhood to youth, He did not seek the schools of the rabbis. He\nneeded not the education to be obtained from such sources; for God\nwas His instructor.\nThe question asked during the Saviour\u2019s ministry, \u201cHow knoweth\nthis man letters, having never learned?\u201d does not indicate that Jesus\nwas unable to read, but merely that He had not received a rabbinical\neducation. John 7:15. Since He gained knowledge as we may do,\n48 The Desire of Ages\nHis intimate acquaintance with the Scriptures shows how diligently\nHis early years were given to the study of God\u2019s word. And spread\nout before Him was the great library of God\u2019s created works. He\nwho had made all things studied the lessons which His own hand had\nwritten in earth and sea and sky. Apart from the unholy ways of the\nworld, He gathered stores of scientific knowledge from nature. He\nstudied the life of plants and animals, and the life of man. From His\nearliest years He was possessed of one purpose; He lived to bless\nothers. For this He found resources in nature; new ideas of ways and\nmeans flashed into His mind as He studied plant life and animal life.\nContinually He was seeking to draw from things seen illustrations by\nwhich to present the living oracles of God. The parables by which,\nduring His ministry, He loved to teach His lessons of truth show\nhow open His spirit was to the influences of nature, and how He had\ngathered the spiritual teaching from the surroundings of His daily\nlife.\nThus to Jesus the significance of the word and the works of\nGod was unfolded, as He was trying to understand the reason of\nthings. Heavenly beings were His attendants, and the culture of\nholy thoughts and communings was His. From the first dawning\nof intelligence He was constantly growing in spiritual grace and\nknowledge of truth.\nEvery child may gain knowledge as Jesus did. As we try to\nbecome acquainted with our heavenly Father through His word,\nangels will draw near, our minds will be strengthened, our characters\nwill be elevated and refined. We shall become more like our Saviour.\nAnd as we behold the beautiful and grand in nature, our affections\ngo out after God. While the spirit is awed, the soul is invigorated by\ncoming in contact with the Infinite through His works. Communion\nwith God through prayer develops the mental and moral faculties,[71]\nand the spiritual powers strengthen as we cultivate thoughts upon\nspiritual things.\nThe life of Jesus was a life in harmony with God. While He\nwas a child, He thought and spoke as a child; but no trace of sin\nmarred the image of God within Him. Yet He was not exempt\nfrom temptation. The inhabitants of Nazareth were proverbial for\ntheir wickedness. The low estimate in which they were generally\nheld is shown by Nathanael\u2019s question, \u201cCan there any good thing\nAs a Child 49\ncome out of Nazareth?\u201d John 1:46. Jesus was placed where His\ncharacter would be tested. It was necessary for Him to be constantly\non guard in order to preserve His purity. He was subject to all the\nconflicts which we have to meet, that He might be an example to us\nin childhood, youth, and manhood.\nSatan was unwearied in his efforts to overcome the Child of\nNazareth. From His earliest years Jesus was guarded by heavenly\nangels, yet His life was one long struggle against the powers of\ndarkness. That there should be upon the earth one life free from\nthe defilement of evil was an offense and a perplexity to the prince\nof darkness. He left no means untried to ensnare Jesus. No child\nof humanity will ever be called to live a holy life amid so fierce a\nconflict with temptation as was our Saviour.\nThe parents of Jesus were poor, and dependent upon their daily [72]\ntoil. He was familiar with poverty, self-denial, and privation. This\nexperience was a safeguard to Him. In His industrious life there\nwere no idle moments to invite temptation. No aimless hours opened\nthe way for corrupting associations. So far as possible, He closed the\ndoor to the tempter. Neither gain nor pleasure, applause nor censure,\ncould induce Him to consent to a wrong act. He was wise to discern\nevil, and strong to resist it.\nChrist was the only sinless one who ever dwelt on earth; yet\nfor nearly thirty years He lived among the wicked inhabitants of\nNazareth. This fact is a rebuke to those who think themselves depen-\ndent upon place, fortune, or prosperity, in order to live a blameless\nlife. Temptation, poverty, adversity, is the very discipline needed to\ndevelop purity and firmness.\nJesus lived in a peasant\u2019s home, and faithfully and cheerfully\nacted His part in bearing the burdens of the household. He had been\nthe Commander of heaven, and angels had delighted to fulfill His\nword; now He was a willing servant, a loving, obedient son. He\nlearned a trade, and with His own hands worked in the carpenter\u2019s\nshop with Joseph. In the simple garb of a common laborer He walked\nthe streets of the little town, going to and returning from His humble\nwork. He did not employ His divine power to lessen His burdens or\nto lighten His toil.\nAs Jesus worked in childhood and youth, mind and body were\ndeveloped. He did not use His physical powers recklessly, but in\n50 The Desire of Ages\nsuch a way as to keep them in health, that He might do the best\nwork in every line. He was not willing to be defective, even in the\nhandling of tools. He was perfect as a workman, as He was perfect\nin character. By His own example He taught that it is our duty to\nbe industrious, that our work should be performed with exactness\nand thoroughness, and that such labor is honorable. The exercise\nthat teaches the hands to be useful and trains the young to bear their\nshare of life\u2019s burdens gives physical strength, and develops every\nfaculty. All should find something to do that will be beneficial to\nthemselves and helpful to others. God appointed work as a blessing,\nand only the diligent worker finds the true glory and joy of life. The\napproval of God rests with loving assurance upon children and youth\nwho cheerfully take their part in the duties of the household, sharing\nthe burdens of father and mother. Such children will go out from the\nhome to be useful members of society.\nThroughout His life on earth, Jesus was an earnest and constant[73]\nworker. He expected much; therefore He attempted much. After\nHe had entered on His ministry, He said, \u201cI must work the works of\nHim that sent Me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man\ncan work.\u201d John 9:4. Jesus did not shirk care and responsibility, as\ndo many who profess to be His followers. It is because they seek to\nevade this discipline that so many are weak and inefficient. They may\npossess precious and amiable traits, but they are nerveless and almost\nuseless when difficulties are to be met or obstacles surmounted.\nThe positiveness and energy, the solidity and strength of character,\nmanifested in Christ are to be developed in us, through the same\ndiscipline that He endured. And the grace that He received is for us.\nSo long as He lived among men, our Saviour shared the lot of\nthe poor. He knew by experience their cares and hardships, and He\ncould comfort and encourage all humble workers. Those who have\na true conception of the teaching of His life will never feel that a\ndistinction must be made between classes, that the rich are to be\nhonored above the worthy poor.\nJesus carried into His labor cheerfulness and tact. It requires\nmuch patience and spirituality to bring Bible religion into the home\nlife and into the workshop, to bear the strain of worldly business, and\nyet keep the eye single to the glory of God. This is where Christ was\na helper. He was never so full of worldly care as to have no time or\nAs a Child 51\nthought for heavenly things. Often He expressed the gladness of His\nheart by singing psalms and heavenly songs. Often the dwellers in\nNazareth heard His voice raised in praise and thanksgiving to God.\nHe held communion with heaven in song; and as His companions\ncomplained of weariness from labor, they were cheered by the sweet\nmelody from His lips. His praise seemed to banish the evil angels,\nand, like incense, fill the place with fragrance. The minds of His\nhearers were carried away from their earthly exile, to the heavenly\nhome.\nJesus was the fountain of healing mercy for the world; and [74]\nthrough all those secluded years at Nazareth, His life flowed out\nin currents of sympathy and tenderness. The aged, the sorrowing,\nand the sin-burdened, the children at play in their innocent joy, the\nlittle creatures of the groves, the patient beasts of burden,\u2014all were\nhappier for His presence. He whose word of power upheld the worlds\nwould stoop to relieve a wounded bird. There was nothing beneath\nHis notice, nothing to which He disdained to minister.\nThus as He grew in wisdom and stature, Jesus increased in favor\nwith God and man. He drew the sympathy of all hearts by showing\nHimself capable of sympathizing with all. The atmosphere of hope\nand courage that surrounded Him made Him a blessing in every\nhome. And often in the synagogue on the Sabbath day He was called\nupon to read the lesson from the prophets, and the hearts of the\nhearers thrilled as a new light shone out from the familiar words of\nthe sacred text.\nYet Jesus shunned display. During all the years of His stay in\nNazareth, He made no exhibition of His miraculous power. He\nsought no high position and assumed no titles. His quiet and simple\nlife, and even the silence of the Scriptures concerning His early\nyears, teach an important lesson. The more quiet and simple the life\nof the child,\u2014the more free from artificial excitement, and the more\nin harmony with nature,\u2014the more favorable is it to physical and\nmental vigor and to spiritual strength.\nJesus is our example. There are many who dwell with interest\nupon the period of His public ministry, while they pass unnoticed\nthe teaching of His early years. But it is in His home life that He is\nthe pattern for all children and youth. The Saviour condescended to\npoverty, that He might teach how closely we in a humble lot may\n52 The Desire of Ages\nwalk with God. He lived to please, honor, and glorify His Father\nin the common things of life. His work began in consecrating the\nlowly trade of the craftsmen who toil for their daily bread. He was\ndoing God\u2019s service just as much when laboring at the carpenter\u2019s\nbench as when working miracles for the multitude. And every youth\nwho follows Christ\u2019s example of faithfulness and obedience in His\nlowly home may claim those words spoken of Him by the Father\nthrough the Holy Spirit, \u201cBehold My Servant, whom I uphold; Mine\nElect, in whom My soul delighteth.\u201d Isaiah 42:1.\nChapter 8\u2014The Passover Visit [75]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 2:41-51.\nAmong the Jews the twelfth year was the dividing line between\nchildhood and youth. On completing this year a Hebrew boy was\ncalled a son of the law, and also a son of God. He was given\nspecial opportunities for religious instruction, and was expected to\nparticipate in the sacred feasts and observances. It was in accordance\nwith this custom that Jesus in His boyhood made the Passover visit\nto Jerusalem. Like all devout Israelites, Joseph and Mary went up\nevery year to attend the Passover; and when Jesus had reached the\nrequired age, they took Him with them.\nThere were three annual feasts, the Passover, the Pentecost,\nand the Feast of Tabernacles, at which all the men of Israel were\ncommanded to appear before the Lord at Jerusalem. Of these feasts\nthe Passover was the most largely attended. Many were present\nfrom all countries where the Jews were scattered. From every part\nof Palestine the worshipers came in great numbers. The journey\nfrom Galilee occupied several days, and the travelers united in large\ncompanies for companionship and protection. The women and aged\nmen rode upon oxen or asses over the steep and rocky roads. The [76]\nstronger men and the youth journeyed on foot. The time of the\nPassover corresponded to the close of March or the beginning of\nApril, and the whole land was bright with flowers, and glad with\nthe song of birds. All along the way were spots memorable in the\nhistory of Israel, and fathers and mothers recounted to their children\nthe wonders that God had wrought for His people in ages past.\nThey beguiled their journey with song and music, and when at last\nthe towers of Jerusalem came into view, every voice joined in the\ntriumphant strain,\u2014\n\u201cOur feet shall stand\nWithin thy gates, O Jerusalem....\n53\n54 The Desire of Ages\nPeace be within thy walls,\nAnd prosperity within thy palaces.\u201d\nPsalm 122:2-7.\nThe observance of the Passover began with the birth of the He-\nbrew nation. On the last night of their bondage in Egypt, when\nthere appeared no token of deliverance, God commanded them to[77]\nprepare for an immediate release. He had warned Pharaoh of the\nfinal judgment on the Egyptians, and He directed the Hebrews to\ngather their families within their own dwellings. Having sprinkled\nthe doorposts with the blood of the slain lamb, they were to eat the\nlamb, roasted, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. \u201cAnd thus\nshall ye eat it,\u201d He said, \u201cwith your loins girded, your shoes on your\nfeet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the\nLord\u2019s passover.\u201d Exodus 12:11. At midnight all the first-born of\nthe Egyptians were slain. Then the king sent to Israel the message,\n\u201cRise up, and get you forth from among my people; ... and go,\nserve the Lord, as ye have said.\u201d Exodus 12:31. The Hebrews went\nout from Egypt an independent nation. The Lord had commanded\nthat the Passover should be yearly kept. \u201cIt shall come to pass,\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cwhen your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this\nservice? that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord\u2019s passover,\nwho passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when\nHe smote the Egyptians.\u201d Thus from generation to generation the\nstory of this wonderful deliverance was to be repeated.\nThe Passover was followed by the seven days\u2019 feast of unleav-\nened bread. On the second day of the feast, the first fruits of the\nyear\u2019s harvest, a sheaf of barley, was presented before the Lord. All\nthe ceremonies of the feast were types of the work of Christ. The\ndeliverance of Israel from Egypt was an object lesson of redemption,\nwhich the Passover was intended to keep in memory. The slain\nlamb, the unleavened bread, the sheaf of first fruits, represented the\nSaviour.\nWith most of the people in the days of Christ, the observance\nof this feast had degenerated into formalism. But what was its\nsignificance to the Son of God!\nFor the first time the child Jesus looked upon the temple. He saw[78]\nthe white-robed priests performing their solemn ministry. He beheld\nPassover Visit 55\nthe bleeding victim upon the altar of sacrifice. With the worshipers\nHe bowed in prayer, while the cloud of incense ascended before\nGod. He witnessed the impressive rites of the paschal service. Day\nby day He saw their meaning more clearly. Every act seemed to be\nbound up with His own life. New impulses were awakening within\nHim. Silent and absorbed, He seemed to be studying out a great\nproblem. The mystery of His mission was opening to the Saviour.\nRapt in the contemplation of these scenes, He did not remain\nbeside His parents. He sought to be alone. When the paschal services\nwere ended, He still lingered in the temple courts; and when the\nworshipers departed from Jerusalem, He was left behind.\nIn this visit to Jerusalem, the parents of Jesus wished to bring\nHim in connection with the great teachers in Israel. While He was\nobedient in every particular to the word of God, He did not conform\nto the rabbinical rites and usages. Joseph and Mary hoped that He\nmight be led to reverence the learned rabbis, and give more diligent\nheed to their requirements. But Jesus in the temple had been taught\nby God. That which He had received, He began at once to impart.\nAt that day an apartment connected with the temple was devoted\nto a sacred school, after the manner of the schools of the prophets.\nHere leading rabbis with their pupils assembled, and hither the child\nJesus came. Seating Himself at the feet of these grave, learned men,\nHe listened to their instruction. As one seeking for wisdom, He\nquestioned these teachers in regard to the prophecies, and to events\nthen taking place that pointed to the advent of the Messiah.\nJesus presented Himself as one thirsting for a knowledge of God.\nHis questions were suggestive of deep truths which had long been\nobscured, yet which were vital to the salvation of souls. While\nshowing how narrow and superficial was the wisdom of the wise\nmen, every question put before them a divine lesson, and placed\ntruth in a new aspect. The rabbis spoke of the wonderful elevation\nwhich the Messiah\u2019s coming would bring to the Jewish nation; but\nJesus presented the prophecy of Isaiah, and asked them the meaning\nof those scriptures that point to the suffering and death of the Lamb\nof God.\nThe doctors turned upon Him with questions, and they were\namazed at His answers. With the humility of a child He repeated the\nwords of Scripture, giving them a depth of meaning that the wise [79]\n56 The Desire of Ages\nmen had not conceived of. If followed, the lines of truth He pointed\nout would have worked a reformation in the religion of the day. A\ndeep interest in spiritual things would have been awakened; and\nwhen Jesus began His ministry, many would have been prepared to\nreceive Him.\nThe rabbis knew that Jesus had not been instructed in their[80]\nschools; yet His understanding of the prophecies far exceeded theirs.\nIn this thoughtful Galilean boy they discerned great promise. They\ndesired to gain Him as a student, that He might become a teacher in\nIsrael. They wanted to have charge of His education, feeling that a\nmind so original must be brought under their molding.\nThe words of Jesus had moved their hearts as they had never\nbefore been moved by words from human lips. God was seeking\nto give light to those leaders in Israel, and He used the only means\nby which they could be reached. In their pride they would have\nscorned to admit that they could receive instruction from anyone.\nIf Jesus had appeared to be trying to teach them, they would have\ndisdained to listen. But they flattered themselves that they were\nteaching Him, or at least testing His knowledge of the Scriptures.\nThe youthful modesty and grace of Jesus disarmed their prejudices.\nUnconsciously their minds were opened to the word of God, and the\nHoly Spirit spoke to their hearts.\nThey could not but see that their expectation in regard to the Mes-\nsiah was not sustained by prophecy; but they would not renounce the\ntheories that had flattered their ambition. They would not admit that\nthey had misapprehended the Scriptures they claimed to teach. From\none to another passed the inquiry, How hath this youth knowledge,\nhaving never learned? The light was shining in darkness; but \u201cthe\ndarkness apprehended it not.\u201d John 1:5, R. V .\nMeanwhile Joseph and Mary were in great perplexity and dis-\ntress. In the departure from Jerusalem they had lost sight of Jesus,\nand they knew not that He had tarried behind. The country was\nthen densely populated, and the caravans from Galilee were very\nlarge. There was much confusion as they left the city. On the way\nthe pleasure of traveling with friends and acquaintances absorbed\ntheir attention, and they did not notice His absence till night came\non. Then as they halted for rest, they missed the helpful hand of\ntheir child. Supposing Him to be with their company, they had\nPassover Visit 57\nfelt no anxiety. Young as He was, they had trusted Him implicitly,\nexpecting that when needed, He would be ready to assist them, an-\nticipating their wants as He had always done. But now their fears\nwere roused. They searched for Him throughout their company,\nbut in vain. Shuddering they remembered how Herod had tried to\ndestroy Him in His infancy. Dark forebodings filled their hearts.\nThey bitterly reproached themselves.\nReturning to Jerusalem, they pursued their search. The next day, [81]\nas they mingled with the worshipers in the temple, a familiar voice\narrested their attention. They could not mistake it; no other voice\nwas like His, so serious and earnest, yet so full of melody.\nIn the school of the rabbis they found Jesus. Rejoiced as they\nwere, they could not forget their grief and anxiety. When He was\nwith them again, the mother said, in words that implied reproof,\n\u201cSon, why hast Thou thus dealt with us? Behold, Thy father and I\nhave sought Thee sorrowing.\u201d\n\u201cHow is it that ye sought Me?\u201d answered Jesus. \u201cWist ye not\nthat I must be about My Father\u2019s business?\u201d And as they seemed\nnot to understand His words, He pointed upward. On His face\nwas a light at which they wondered. Divinity was flashing through\nhumanity. On finding Him in the temple, they had listened to what\nwas passing between Him and the rabbis, and they were astonished\nat His questions and answers. His words started a train of thought\nthat would never be forgotten.\nAnd His question to them had a lesson. \u201cWist ye not,\u201d He said,\n\u201cthat I must be about My Father\u2019s business?\u201d Jesus was engaged\nin the work that He had come into the world to do; but Joseph and\nMary had neglected theirs. God had shown them high honor in\ncommitting to them His Son. Holy angels had directed the course\nof Joseph in order to preserve the life of Jesus. But for an entire\nday they had lost sight of Him whom they should not have forgotten\nfor a moment. And when their anxiety was relieved, they had not\ncensured themselves, but had cast the blame upon Him.\nIt was natural for the parents of Jesus to look upon Him as their\nown child. He was daily with them, His life in many respects was\nlike that of other children, and it was difficult for them to realize\nthat He was the Son of God. They were in danger of failing to\nappreciate the blessing granted them in the presence of the world\u2019s\n58 The Desire of Ages\nRedeemer. The grief of their separation from Him, and the gentle\nreproof which His words conveyed, were designed to impress them\nwith the sacredness of their trust.\nIn the answer to His mother, Jesus showed for the first time that\nHe understood His relation to God. Before His birth the angel had\nsaid to Mary, \u201cHe shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the\nHighest: and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His\nfather David: and He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever.\u201d[82]\nLuke 1:32, 33. These words Mary had pondered in her heart; yet\nwhile she believed that her child was to be Israel\u2019s Messiah, she\ndid not comprehend His mission. Now she did not understand His\nwords; but she knew that He had disclaimed kinship to Joseph, and\nhad declared His Sonship to God.\nJesus did not ignore His relation to His earthly parents. From\nJerusalem He returned home with them, and aided them in their life\nof toil. He hid in His own heart the mystery of His mission, waiting\nsubmissively for the appointed time for Him to enter upon His work.\nFor eighteen years after He had recognized that He was the Son\nof God, He acknowledged the tie that bound Him to the home at\nNazareth, and performed the duties of a son, a brother, a friend, and\na citizen.\nAs His mission had opened to Jesus in the temple, He shrank\nfrom contact with the multitude. He wished to return from Jerusalem\nin quietness, with those who knew the secret of His life. By the\npaschal service, God was seeking to call His people away from\ntheir worldly cares, and to remind them of His wonderful work in\ntheir deliverance from Egypt. In this work He desired them to see\na promise of deliverance from sin. As the blood of the slain lamb\nsheltered the homes of Israel, so the blood of Christ was to save their\nsouls; but they could be saved through Christ only as by faith they\nshould make His life their own. There was virtue in the symbolic\nservice only as it directed the worshipers to Christ as their personal\nSaviour. God desired that they should be led to prayerful study and\nmeditation in regard to Christ\u2019s mission. But as the multitudes left\nJerusalem, the excitement of travel and social intercourse too often\nabsorbed their attention, and the service they had witnessed was\nforgotten. The Saviour was not attracted to their company.\nPassover Visit 59\nAs Joseph and Mary should return from Jerusalem alone with\nJesus, He hoped to direct their minds to the prophecies of the suffer-\ning Saviour. Upon Calvary He sought to lighten His mother\u2019s grief.\nHe was thinking of her now. Mary was to witness His last agony,\nand Jesus desired her to understand His mission, that she might be\nstrengthened to endure, when the sword should pierce through her\nsoul. As Jesus had been separated from her, and she had sought Him\nsorrowing three days, so when He should be offered up for the sins\nof the world, He would again be lost to her for three days. And as\nHe should come forth from the tomb, her sorrow would again be\nturned to joy. But how much better she could have borne the anguish [83]\nof His death if she had understood the Scriptures to which He was\nnow trying to turn her thoughts!\nIf Joseph and Mary had stayed their minds upon God by medi-\ntation and prayer, they would have realized the sacredness of their\ntrust, and would not have lost sight of Jesus. By one day\u2019s neglect\nthey lost the Saviour; but it cost them three days of anxious search to\nfind Him. So with us; by idle talk, evilspeaking, or neglect of prayer,\nwe may in one day lose the Saviour\u2019s presence, and it may take many\ndays of sorrowful search to find Him, and regain the peace that we\nhave lost.\nIn our association with one another, we should take heed lest we\nforget Jesus, and pass along unmindful that He is not with us. When\nwe become absorbed in worldly things so that we have no thought\nfor Him in whom our hope of eternal life is centered, we separate\nourselves from Jesus and from the heavenly angels. These holy\nbeings cannot remain where the Saviour\u2019s presence is not desired,\nand His absence is not marked. This is why discouragement so often\nexists among the professed followers of Christ.\nMany attend religious services, and are refreshed and comforted\nby the word of God; but through neglect of meditation, watchfulness,\nand prayer, they lose the blessing, and find themselves more destitute\nthan before they received it. Often they feel that God has dealt hardly\nwith them. They do not see that the fault is their own. By separating\nthemselves from Jesus, they have shut away the light of His presence.\nIt would be well for us to spend a thoughtful hour each day in\ncontemplation of the life of Christ. We should take it point by point,\nand let the imagination grasp each scene, especially the closing ones.\n60 The Desire of Ages\nAs we thus dwell upon His great sacrifice for us, our confidence in\nHim will be more constant, our love will be quickened, and we shall\nbe more deeply imbued with His spirit. If we would be saved at last,\nwe must learn the lesson of penitence and humiliation at the foot of\nthe cross.\nAs we associate together, we may be a blessing to one another.\nIf we are Christ\u2019s, our sweetest thoughts will be of Him. We shall\nlove to talk of Him; and as we speak to one another of His love, our\nhearts will be softened by divine influences. Beholding the beauty\nof His character, we shall be \u201cchanged into the same image from\nglory to glory.\u201d 2 Corinthians 3:18.\nChapter 9\u2014Days of Conflict [84]\nFrom its earliest years the Jewish child was surrounded with the\nrequirements of the rabbis. Rigid rules were prescribed for every act,\ndown to the smallest details of life. Under the synagogue teachers the\nyouth were instructed in the countless regulations which as orthodox\nIsraelites they were expected to observe. But Jesus did not interest\nHimself in these matters. From childhood He acted independently\nof the rabbinical laws. The Scriptures of the Old Testament were\nHis constant study, and the words, \u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d were ever\nupon His lips.\nAs the condition of the people began to open to His mind, He saw\nthat the requirements of society and the requirements of God were\nin constant collision. Men were departing from the word of God,\nand exalting theories of their own invention. They were observing\ntraditional rites that possessed no virtue. Their service was a mere\nround of ceremonies; the sacred truths it was designed to teach were\nhidden from the worshipers. He saw that in their faithless services\nthey found no peace. They did not know the freedom of spirit that\nwould come to them by serving God in truth. Jesus had come to\nteach the meaning of the worship of God, and He could not sanction\nthe mingling of human requirements with the divine precepts. He\ndid not attack the precepts or practices of the learned teachers; but [85]\nwhen reproved for His own simple habits, He presented the word of\nGod in justification of His conduct.\nIn every gentle and submissive way, Jesus tried to please those\nwith whom He came in contact. Because He was so gentle and\nunobtrusive, the scribes and elders supposed that He would be easily\ninfluenced by their teaching. They urged Him to receive the maxims\nand traditions that had been handed down from the ancient rabbis,\nbut He asked for their authority in Holy Writ. He would hear every\nword that proceeds from the mouth of God; but He could not obey\nthe inventions of men. Jesus seemed to know the Scriptures from\nbeginning to end, and He presented them in their true import. The\n61\n62 The Desire of Ages\nrabbis were ashamed to be instructed by a child. They claimed that\nit was their office to explain the Scriptures, and that it was His place\nto accept their interpretation. They were indignant that He should\nstand in opposition to their word.\nThey knew that no authority could be found in Scripture for their\ntraditions. They realized that in spiritual understanding Jesus was\nfar in advance of them. Yet they were angry because He did not\nobey their dictates. Failing to convince Him, they sought Joseph and[86]\nMary, and set before them His course of noncompliance. Thus He\nsuffered rebuke and censure.\nAt a very early age, Jesus had begun to act for Himself in the\nformation of His character, and not even respect and love for His\nparents could turn Him from obedience to God\u2019s word. \u201cIt is written\u201d\nwas His reason for every act that varied from the family customs.\nBut the influence of the rabbis made His life a bitter one. Even in\nHis youth He had to learn the hard lesson of silence and patient\nendurance.\nHis brothers, as the sons of Joseph were called, sided with the\nrabbis. They insisted that the traditions must be heeded, as if they\nwere the requirements of God. They even regarded the precepts\nof men more highly than the word of God, and they were greatly\nannoyed at the clear penetration of Jesus in distinguishing between\nthe false and the true. His strict obedience to the law of God they\ncondemned as stubbornness. They were surprised at the knowledge\nand wisdom He showed in answering the rabbis. They knew that\nHe had not received instruction from the wise men, yet they could\nnot but see that He was an instructor to them. They recognized that\nHis education was of a higher type than their own. But they did not\ndiscern that He had access to the tree of life, a source of knowledge\nof which they were ignorant.\nChrist was not exclusive, and He had given special offense to\nthe Pharisees by departing in this respect from their rigid rules. He\nfound the domain of religion fenced in by high walls of seclusion,\nas too sacred a matter for everyday life. These walls of partition\nHe overthrew. In His contact with men He did not ask, What is\nyour creed? To what church do you belong? He exercised His\nhelping power in behalf of all who needed help. Instead of secluding\nHimself in a hermit\u2019s cell in order to show His heavenly character,\nDays of Conflict 63\nHe labored earnestly for humanity. He inculcated the principle that\nBible religion does not consist in the mortification of the body.\nHe taught that pure and undefiled religion is not meant only for\nset times and special occasions. At all times and in all places He\nmanifested a loving interest in men, and shed about Him the light of\na cheerful piety. All this was a rebuke to the Pharisees. It showed\nthat religion does not consist in selfishness, and that their morbid\ndevotion to personal interest was far from being true godliness. This\nhad roused their enmity against Jesus, so that they tried to enforce\nHis conformity to their regulations.\nJesus worked to relieve every case of suffering that He saw. He [87]\nhad little money to give, but He often denied Himself of food in order\nto relieve those who appeared more needy than He. His brothers\nfelt that His influence went far to counteract theirs. He possessed a\ntact which none of them had, or desired to have. When they spoke\nharshly to poor, degraded beings, Jesus sought out these very ones,\nand spoke to them words of encouragement. To those who were in\nneed He would give a cup of cold water, and would quietly place\nHis own meal in their hands. As He relieved their sufferings, the\ntruths He taught were associated with His acts of mercy, and were\nthus riveted in the memory.\nAll this displeased His brothers. Being older than Jesus, they\nfelt that He should be under their dictation. They charged Him with\nthinking Himself superior to them, and reproved Him for setting\nHimself above their teachers and the priests and rulers of the people.\nOften they threatened and tried to intimidate Him; but He passed on,\nmaking the Scriptures His guide.\nJesus loved His brothers, and treated them with unfailing kind-\nness; but they were jealous of Him, and manifested the most decided\nunbelief and contempt. They could not understand His conduct.\nGreat contradictions presented themselves in Jesus. He was the\ndivine Son of God, and yet a helpless child. The Creator of the [88]\nworlds, the earth was His possession, and yet poverty marked His\nlife experience at every step. He possessed a dignity and individ-\nuality wholly distinct from earthly pride and assumption; He did\nnot strive for worldly greatness, and in even the lowliest position\nHe was content. This angered His brothers. They could not account\nfor His constant serenity under trial and deprivation. They did not\n64 The Desire of Ages\nknow that for our sake He had become poor, that we \u201cthrough His\npoverty might be rich.\u201d 2 Corinthians 8:9. They could understand\nthe mystery of His mission no more than the friends of Job could\nunderstand his humiliation and suffering.\nJesus was misunderstood by His brothers because He was not\nlike them. His standard was not their standard. In looking to men\nthey had turned away from God, and they had not His power in\ntheir lives. The forms of religion which they observed could not\ntransform the character. They paid \u201ctithe of mint and anise and\ncummin,\u201d but omitted \u201cthe weightier matters of the law, judgment,\nmercy, and faith.\u201d Matthew 23:23. The example of Jesus was to\nthem a continual irritation. He hated but one thing in the world,\nand that was sin. He could not witness a wrong act without pain\nwhich it was impossible to disguise. Between the formalists, whose\nsanctity of appearance concealed the love of sin, and a character in\nwhich zeal for God\u2019s glory was always paramount, the contrast was\nunmistakable. Because the life of Jesus condemned evil, He was\nopposed, both at home and abroad. His unselfishness and integrity\nwere commented on with a sneer. His forbearance and kindness\nwere termed cowardice.\nOf the bitterness that falls to the lot of humanity, there was no\npart which Christ did not taste. There were those who tried to cast\ncontempt upon Him because of His birth, and even in His childhood\nHe had to meet their scornful looks and evil whisperings. If He had\nresponded by an impatient word or look, if He had conceded to His\nbrothers by even one wrong act, He would have failed of being a\nperfect example. Thus He would have failed of carrying out the plan\nfor our redemption. Had He even admitted that there could be an\nexcuse for sin, Satan would have triumphed, and the world would\nhave been lost. This is why the tempter worked to make His life as\ntrying as possible, that He might be led to sin.\nBut to every temptation He had one answer, \u201cIt is written.\u201d He\nrarely rebuked any wrongdoing of His brothers, but He had a word\nfrom God to speak to them. Often He was accused of cowardice for[89]\nrefusing to unite with them in some forbidden act; but His answer\nwas, It is written, \u201cThe fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart\nfrom evil is understanding.\u201d Job 28:28.\nDays of Conflict 65\nThere were some who sought His society, feeling at peace in His\npresence; but many avoided Him, because they were rebuked by His\nstainless life. Young companions urged Him to do as they did. He\nwas bright and cheerful; they enjoyed His presence, and welcomed\nHis ready suggestions; but they were impatient at His scruples,\nand pronounced Him narrow and strait-laced. Jesus answered, It is\nwritten, \u201cWherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking\nheed thereto according to Thy word.\u201d \u201cThy word have I hid in mine\nheart, that I might not sin against Thee.\u201d Psalm 119:9, 11.\nOften He was asked, Why are you bent on being so singular,\nso different from us all? It is written, He said, \u201cBlessed are the\nundefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord. Blessed are\nthey that keep His testimonies, and that seek Him with the whole\nheart. They also do no iniquity; they walk in His ways.\u201d Psalm\n119:1-3.\nWhen questioned why He did not join in the frolics of the youth\nof Nazareth, He said, It is written, \u201cI have rejoiced in the way of\nThy testimonies, as much as in all riches. I will meditate in Thy\nprecepts, and have respect unto Thy ways. I will delight myself in\nThy statutes; I will not forget Thy word.\u201d Psalm 119:14-16.\nJesus did not contend for His rights. Often His work was made\nunnecessarily severe because He was willing and uncomplaining.\nYet He did not fail nor become discouraged. He lived above these\ndifficulties, as if in the light of God\u2019s countenance. He did not\nretaliate when roughly used, but bore insult patiently.\nAgain and again He was asked, Why do You submit to such de-\nspiteful usage, even from Your brothers? It is written, He said, \u201cMy\nson, forget not My law; but let thine heart keep My commandments:\nfor length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.\nLet not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck;\nwrite them upon the table of thine heart: so shalt thou find favor and\ngood understanding in the sight of God and man.\u201d Proverbs 3:1-4.\nFrom the time when the parents of Jesus found Him in the temple,\nHis course of action was a mystery to them. He would not enter into\ncontroversy, yet His example was a constant lesson. He seemed as\none who was set apart. His hours of happiness were found when [90]\nalone with nature and with God. Whenever it was His privilege,\nHe turned aside from the scene of His labor, to go into the fields,\n66 The Desire of Ages\nto meditate in the green valleys, to hold communion with God on\nthe mountainside or amid the trees of the forest. The early morning\noften found Him in some secluded place, meditating, searching the\nScriptures, or in prayer. From these quiet hours He would return\nto His home to take up His duties again, and to give an example of\npatient toil.\nThe life of Christ was marked with respect and love for His\nmother. Mary believed in her heart that the holy child born of her\nwas the long-promised Messiah, yet she dared not express her faith.\nThroughout His life on earth she was a partaker in His sufferings.\nShe witnessed with sorrow the trials brought upon Him in His child-\nhood and youth. By her vindication of what she knew to be right\nin His conduct, she herself was brought into trying positions. She\nlooked upon the associations of the home, and the mother\u2019s tender\nwatchcare over her children, as of vital importance in the formation\nof character. The sons and daughters of Joseph knew this, and by\nappealing to her anxiety, they tried to correct the practices of Jesus\naccording to their standard.\nMary often remonstrated with Jesus, and urged Him to conform\nto the usages of the rabbis. But He could not be persuaded to change\nHis habits of contemplating the works of God and seeking to alleviate\nthe suffering of men or even of dumb animals. When the priests and\nteachers required Mary\u2019s aid in controlling Jesus, she was greatly\ntroubled; but peace came to her heart as He presented the statements\nof Scripture upholding His practices.\nAt times she wavered between Jesus and His brothers, who did\nnot believe that He was the Sent of God; but evidence was abundant\nthat His was a divine character. She saw Him sacrificing Himself for\nthe good of others. His presence brought a purer atmosphere into the\nhome, and His life was as leaven working amid the elements of soci-\nety. Harmless and undefiled, He walked among the thoughtless, the\nrude, the uncourteous; amid the unjust publicans, the reckless prodi-\ngals, the unrighteous Samaritans, the heathen soldiers, the rough\npeasants, and the mixed multitude. He spoke a word of sympathy\nhere and a word there, as He saw men weary, yet compelled to bear\nheavy burdens. He shared their burdens, and repeated to them the\nlessons He had learned from nature, of the love, the kindness, the\ngoodness of God.\nDays of Conflict 67\nHe taught all to look upon themselves as endowed with precious [91]\ntalents, which if rightly employed would secure for them eternal\nriches. He weeded all vanity from life, and by His own example\ntaught that every moment of time is fraught with eternal results;\nthat it is to be cherished as a treasure, and to be employed for holy\npurposes. He passed by no human being as worthless, but sought\nto apply the saving remedy to every soul. In whatever company He\nfound Himself, He presented a lesson that was appropriate to the\ntime and the circumstances. He sought to inspire with hope the most\nrough and unpromising, setting before them the assurance that they\nmight become blameless and harmless, attaining such a character as\nwould make them manifest as the children of God. Often He met\nthose who had drifted under Satan\u2019s control, and who had no power\nto break from his snare. To such a one, discouraged, sick, tempted,\nand fallen, Jesus would speak words of tenderest pity, words that\nwere needed and could be understood. Others He met who were [92]\nfighting a hand-to-hand battle with the adversary of souls. These\nHe encouraged to persevere, assuring them that they would win; for\nangels of God were on their side, and would give them the victory.\nThose whom He thus helped were convinced that here was One in\nwhom they could trust with perfect confidence. He would not betray\nthe secrets they poured into His sympathizing ear.\nJesus was the healer of the body as well as of the soul. He was\ninterested in every phase of suffering that came under His notice, and\nto every sufferer He brought relief, His kind words having a soothing\nbalm. None could say that He had worked a miracle; but virtue\u2014the\nhealing power of love\u2014went out from Him to the sick and distressed.\nThus in an unobtrusive way He worked for the people from His very\nchildhood. And this was why, after His public ministry began, so\nmany heard Him gladly.\nYet through childhood, youth, and manhood, Jesus walked alone.\nIn His purity and His faithfulness, He trod the wine press alone,\nand of the people there was none with Him. He carried the awful\nweight of responsibility for the salvation of men. He knew that\nunless there was a decided change in the principles and purposes of\nthe human race, all would be lost. This was the burden of His soul,\nand none could appreciate the weight that rested upon Him. Filled\n68 The Desire of Ages\nwith intense purpose, He carried out the design of His life that He\nHimself should be the light of men.\nChapter 10\u2014The Voice in the Wilderness [93]\n[94]\n[95]\n[96]\n[97]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 1:5-23, 57-80; Luke 3:1-18; Luke\n3:1-12; Mark 1:1-8.\nFrom among the faithful in Israel, who had long waited for the\ncoming of the Messiah, the forerunner of Christ arose. The aged\npriest Zacharias and his wife Elisabeth were \u201cboth righteous before\nGod;\u201d and in their quiet and holy lives the light of faith shone out\nlike a star amid the darkness of those evil days. To this godly pair\nwas given the promise of a son, who should \u201cgo before the face of\nthe Lord to prepare His ways.\u201d\nZacharias dwelt in \u201cthe hill country of Judea,\u201d but he had gone\nup to Jerusalem to minister for one week in the temple, a service\nrequired twice a year from the priests of each course. \u201cAnd it came\nto pass, that while he executed the priest\u2019s office before God in the\norder of his course, according to the custom of the priest\u2019s office, his\nlot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.\u201d\nHe was standing before the golden altar in the holy place of\nthe sanctuary. The cloud of incense with the prayers of Israel was\nascending before God. Suddenly he became conscious of a divine\npresence. An angel of the Lord was \u201cstanding on the right side of\nthe altar.\u201d The position of the angel was an indication of favor, but\nZacharias took no note of this. For many years he had prayed for [98]\nthe coming of the Redeemer; now heaven had sent its messenger\nto announce that these prayers were about to be answered; but the\nmercy of God seemed too great for him to credit. He was filled with\nfear and self-condemnation.\nBut he was greeted with the joyful assurance: \u201cFear not,\nZacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall\nbear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. And thou shalt\nhave joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. For he\nshall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine\nnor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost.... And\n69\n70 The Desire of Ages\nmany of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.\nAnd he shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn\nthe hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the\nwisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\nAnd Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I\nam an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.\u201d\nZacharias well knew how to Abraham in his old age a child was\ngiven because he believed Him faithful who had promised. But\nfor a moment the aged priest turns his thought to the weakness\nof humanity. He forgets that what God has promised, He is able\nto perform. What a contrast between this unbelief and the sweet,\nchildlike faith of Mary, the maiden of Nazareth, whose answer to\nthe angel\u2019s wonderful announcement was, \u201cBehold the handmaid of\nthe Lord; be it unto me according to thy word\u201d! Luke 1:38.\nThe birth of a son to Zacharias, like the birth of the child of\nAbraham, and that of Mary, was to teach a great spiritual truth, a\ntruth that we are slow to learn and ready to forget. In ourselves we\nare incapable of doing any good thing; but that which we cannot\ndo will be wrought by the power of God in every submissive and\nbelieving soul. It was through faith that the child of promise was\ngiven. It is through faith that spiritual life is begotten, and we are\nenabled to do the works of righteousness.\nTo the question of Zacharias, the angel said, \u201cI am Gabriel, that\nstand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to\nshow thee these glad tidings.\u201d Five hundred years before, Gabriel\nhad made known to Daniel the prophetic period which was to extend\nto the coming of Christ. The knowledge that the end of this period\nwas near had moved Zacharias to pray for the Messiah\u2019s advent.\nNow the very messenger through whom the prophecy was given had\ncome to announce its fulfillment.\nThe words of the angel, \u201cI am Gabriel, that stand in the presence[99]\nof God,\u201d show that he holds a position of high honor in the heavenly\ncourts. When he came with a message to Daniel, he said, \u201cThere\nis none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael [Christ]\nyour Prince.\u201d Daniel 10:21. Of Gabriel the Saviour speaks in the\nRevelation, saying that \u201cHe sent and signified it by His angel unto\nHis servant John.\u201d Revelation 1:1. And to John the angel declared,\n\u201cI am a fellow servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets.\u201d\nVoice in the Wilderness 71\nRevelation 22:9, R. V . Wonderful thought\u2014that the angel who\nstands next in honor to the Son of God is the one chosen to open the\npurposes of God to sinful men.\nZacharias had expressed doubt of the angel\u2019s words. He was not\nto speak again until they were fulfilled. \u201cBehold,\u201d said the angel,\n\u201cthou shalt be dumb, ... until the day that these things shall be\nperformed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be\nfulfilled in their season.\u201d It was the duty of the priest in this service\nto pray for the pardon of public and national sins, and for the coming\nof the Messiah; but when Zacharias attempted to do this, he could\nnot utter a word.\nComing forth to bless the people, \u201che beckoned unto them, and\nremained speechless.\u201d They had waited long, and had begun to fear,\nlest he had been cut down by the judgment of God. But as he came\nforth from the holy place, his face was shining with the glory of\nGod, \u201cand they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple.\u201d\nZacharias communicated to them what he had seen and heard; and\n\u201cas soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he\ndeparted to his own house.\u201d\nSoon after the birth of the promised child, the father\u2019s tongue\nwas loosed, \u201cand he spake, and praised God. And fear came on\nall that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised\nabroad throughout all the hill country of Judea. And all they that\nheard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of [100]\nchild shall this be!\u201d All this tended to call attention to the Messiah\u2019s\ncoming, for which John was to prepare the way.\nThe Holy Spirit rested upon Zacharias, and in these beautiful\nwords he prophesied of the mission of his son:\n\u201cThou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest;\nFor thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare His\nways;\nTo give knowledge of salvation unto His people\nBy the remission of their sins,\nThrough the tender mercy of our God,\nWhereby the Dayspring from on high hath visited us,\nTo give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of\ndeath,\n72 The Desire of Ages\nTo guide our feet into the way of peace.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the\ndeserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.\u201d Before the birth of\nJohn, the angel had said, \u201cHe shall be great in the sight of the Lord,\nand shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled\nwith the Holy Ghost.\u201d God had called the son of Zacharias to a great\nwork, the greatest ever committed to men. In order to accomplish\nthis work, he must have the Lord to work with him. And the Spirit\nof God would be with him if he heeded the instruction of the angel.\nJohn was to go forth as Jehovah\u2019s messenger, to bring to men\nthe light of God. He must give a new direction to their thoughts.\nHe must impress them with the holiness of God\u2019s requirements, and\ntheir need of His perfect righteousness. Such a messenger must be\nholy. He must be a temple for the indwelling Spirit of God. In order\nto fulfill his mission, he must have a sound physical constitution,\nand mental and spiritual strength. Therefore it would be necessary\nfor him to control the appetites and passions. He must be able so to\ncontrol all his powers that he could stand among men as unmoved\nby surrounding circumstances as the rocks and mountains of the\nwilderness.\nIn the time of John the Baptist, greed for riches, and the love\nof luxury and display had become widespread. Sensuous pleasures,\nfeasting and drinking, were causing physical disease and degeneracy,\nbenumbing the spiritual perceptions, and lessening the sensibility\nto sin. John was to stand as a reformer. By his abstemious life and\nplain dress he was to rebuke the excesses of his time. Hence the[101]\ndirections given to the parents of John,\u2014a lesson of temperance by\nan angel from the throne of heaven.\nIn childhood and youth the character is most impressible. The\npower of self-control should then be acquired. By the fireside and at\nthe family board influences are exerted whose results are as enduring\nas eternity. More than any natural endowment, the habits established\nin early years decide whether a man will be victorious or vanquished\nin the battle of life. Youth is the sowing time. It determines the\ncharacter of the harvest, for this life and for the life to come.\nAs a prophet, John was \u201cto turn the hearts of the fathers to the\nchildren, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make\nVoice in the Wilderness 73\nready a people prepared for the Lord.\u201d In preparing the way for\nChrist\u2019s first advent, he was a representative of those who are to\nprepare a people for our Lord\u2019s second coming. The world is given\nto self-indulgence. Errors and fables abound. Satan\u2019s snares for\ndestroying souls are multiplied. All who would perfect holiness in\nthe fear of God must learn the lessons of temperance and self-control.\nThe appetites and passions must be held in subjection to the higher\npowers of the mind. This self-discipline is essential to that mental\nstrength and spiritual insight which will enable us to understand\nand to practice the sacred truths of God\u2019s word. For this reason\ntemperance finds its place in the work of preparation for Christ\u2019s\nsecond coming.\nIn the natural order of things, the son of Zacharias would have\nbeen educated for the priesthood. But the training of the rabbinical\nschools would have unfitted him for his work. God did not send him\nto the teachers of theology to learn how to interpret the Scriptures.\nHe called him to the desert, that he might learn of nature and nature\u2019s\nGod.\nIt was a lonely region where he found his home, in the midst of\nbarren hills, wild ravines, and rocky caves. But it was his choice\nto forgo the enjoyments and luxuries of life for the stern discipline\nof the wilderness. Here his surroundings were favorable to habits\nof simplicity and self-denial. Uninterrupted by the clamor of the\nworld, he could here study the lessons of nature, of revelation, and\nof Providence. The words of the angel to Zacharias had been often\nrepeated to John by his God-fearing parents. From childhood his\nmission had been kept before him, and he had accepted the holy trust.\nTo him the solitude of the desert was a welcome escape from society\nin which suspicion, unbelief, and impurity had become well-nigh\nall-pervading. He distrusted his own power to withstand temptation, [102]\nand shrank from constant contact with sin, lest he should lose the\nsense of its exceeding sinfulness.\nDedicated to God as a Nazarite from his birth, he made the vow\nhis own in a life-long consecration. His dress was that of the ancient\nprophets, a garment of camel\u2019s hair, confined by a leather girdle. He\nate the \u201clocusts and wild honey\u201d found in the wilderness, and drank\nthe pure water from the hills.\n74 The Desire of Ages\nBut the life of John was not spent in idleness, in ascetic gloom, or\nin selfish isolation. From time to time he went forth to mingle with\nmen; and he was ever an interested observer of what was passing in\nthe world. From his quiet retreat he watched the unfolding of events.\nWith vision illuminated by the divine Spirit he studied the characters\nof men, that he might understand how to reach their hearts with the\nmessage of heaven. The burden of his mission was upon him. In\nsolitude, by meditation and prayer, he sought to gird up his soul for\nthe lifework before him.\nAlthough in the wilderness, he was not exempt from temptation.\nSo far as possible, he closed every avenue by which Satan could\nenter, yet he was still assailed by the tempter. But his spiritual\nperceptions were clear; he had developed strength and decision of\ncharacter, and through the aid of the Holy Spirit he was able to detect\nSatan\u2019s approaches, and to resist his power.\nJohn found in the wilderness his school and his sanctuary. Like\nMoses amid the mountains of Midian, he was shut in by God\u2019s\npresence, and surrounded by the evidences of His power. It was not\nhis lot to dwell, as did Israel\u2019s great leader, amid the solemn majesty\nof the mountain solitudes; but before him were the heights of Moab,\nbeyond Jordan, speaking of Him who had set fast the mountains, and\ngirded them with strength. The gloomy and terrible aspect of nature\nin his wilderness home vividly pictured the condition of Israel. The\nfruitful vineyard of the Lord had become a desolate waste. But\nabove the desert the heavens bent bright and beautiful. The clouds\nthat gathered, dark with tempest, were arched by the rainbow of\npromise. So above Israel\u2019s degradation shone the promised glory\nof the Messiah\u2019s reign. The clouds of wrath were spanned by the\nrainbow of His covenant-mercy.\nAlone in the silent night he read God\u2019s promise to Abraham\nof a seed numberless as the stars. The light of dawn, gilding the\nmountains of Moab, told of Him who should be as \u201cthe light of the\nmorning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds.\u201d 2[103]\nSamuel 23:4. And in the brightness of noontide he saw the splendor\nof His manifestation, when \u201cthe glory of the Lord shall be revealed,\nand all flesh shall see it together.\u201d Isaiah 40:5.\nWith awed yet exultant spirit he searched in the prophetic scrolls\nthe revelations of the Messiah\u2019s coming,\u2014the promised seed that\nVoice in the Wilderness 75\nshould bruise the serpent\u2019s head; Shiloh, \u201cthe peace giver,\u201d who was\nto appear before a king should cease to reign on David\u2019s throne.\nNow the time had come. A Roman ruler sat in the palace upon\nMount Zion. By the sure word of the Lord, already the Christ was\nborn.\nIsaiah\u2019s rapt portrayals of the Messiah\u2019s glory were his study\nby day and by night,\u2014the Branch from the root of Jesse; a King\nto reign in righteousness, judging \u201cwith equity for the meek of the\nearth;\u201d \u201ca covert from the tempest; ... the shadow of a great rock in a\nweary land;\u201d Israel no longer to be termed \u201cForsaken,\u201d nor her land\n\u201cDesolate,\u201d but to be called of the Lord, \u201cMy Delight,\u201d and her land\n\u201cBeulah.\u201d Isaiah 11:4; 32:2; 62:4, margin. The heart of the lonely\nexile was filled with the glorious vision.\nHe looked upon the King in His beauty, and self was forgotten.\nHe beheld the majesty of holiness, and felt himself to be inefficient\nand unworthy. He was ready to go forth as Heaven\u2019s messenger,\nunawed by the human, because he had looked upon the Divine. He\ncould stand erect and fearless in the presence of earthly monarchs,\nbecause he had bowed low before the King of kings.\nJohn did not fully understand the nature of the Messiah\u2019s king-\ndom. He looked for Israel to be delivered from her national foes;\nbut the coming of a King in righteousness, and the establishment of\nIsrael as a holy nation, was the great object of his hope. Thus he\nbelieved would be accomplished the prophecy given at his birth,\u2014\n\u201cTo remember His holy covenant; ...\nThat we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies\nMight serve Him without fear,\nIn holiness and righteousness before Him, all the days of our\nlife.\u201d\nHe saw his people deceived, self-satisfied, and asleep in their\nsins. He longed to rouse them to a holier life. The message that\nGod had given him to bear was designed to startle them from their\nlethargy, and cause them to tremble because of their great wicked- [104]\nness. Before the seed of the gospel could find lodgment, the soil of\nthe heart must be broken up. Before they would seek healing from\n76 The Desire of Ages\nJesus, they must be awakened to their danger from the wounds of\nsin.\nGod does not send messengers to flatter the sinner. He delivers no\nmessage of peace to lull the unsanctified into fatal security. He lays\nheavy burdens upon the conscience of the wrongdoer, and pierces\nthe soul with arrows of conviction. The ministering angels present\nto him the fearful judgments of God to deepen the sense of need,\nand prompt the cry, \u201cWhat must I do to be saved?\u201d Then the hand\nthat has humbled in the dust, lifts up the penitent. The voice that\nhas rebuked sin, and put to shame pride and ambition, inquires with\ntenderest sympathy, \u201cWhat wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?\u201d\nWhen the ministry of John began, the nation was in a state of\nexcitement and discontent verging on revolution. At the removal\nof Archelaus, Judea had been brought directly under the control of\nRome. The tyranny and extortion of the Roman governors, and their\ndetermined efforts to introduce the heathen symbols and customs,\nkindled revolt, which had been quenched in the blood of thousands\nof the bravest of Israel. All this intensified the national hatred against\nRome, and increased the longing to be freed from her power.\nAmid discord and strife, a voice was heard from the wilderness,\na voice startling and stern, yet full of hope: \u201cRepent ye; for the\nkingdom of heaven is at hand.\u201d With a new, strange power it moved\nthe people. Prophets had foretold the coming of Christ as an event\nfar in the future; but here was an announcement that it was at hand.\nJohn\u2019s singular appearance carried the minds of his hearers back\nto the ancient seers. In his manner and dress he resembled the\nprophet Elijah. With the spirit and power of Elijah he denounced\nthe national corruption, and rebuked the prevailing sins. His words\nwere plain, pointed, and convincing. Many believed him to be one\nof the prophets risen from the dead. The whole nation was stirred.\nMultitudes flocked to the wilderness.\nJohn proclaimed the coming of the Messiah, and called the peo-\nple to repentance. As a symbol of cleansing from sin, he baptized\nthem in the waters of the Jordan. Thus by a significant object lesson\nhe declared that those who claimed to be the chosen people of God\nwere defiled by sin, and that without purification of heart and life\nthey could have no part in the Messiah\u2019s kingdom.\nPrinces and rabbis, soldiers, publicans, and peasants came to[105]\nVoice in the Wilderness 77\nhear the prophet. For a time the solemn warning from God alarmed\nthem. Many were brought to repentance, and received baptism.\nPersons of all ranks submitted to the requirement of the Baptist, in\norder to participate in the kingdom he announced.\nMany of the scribes and Pharisees came confessing their sins,\nand asking for baptism. They had exalted themselves as better than\nother men, and had led the people to entertain a high opinion of their\npiety; now the guilty secrets of their lives were unveiled. But John\nwas impressed by the Holy Spirit that many of these men had no real\nconviction of sin. They were timeservers. As friends of the prophet,\nthey hoped to find favor with the coming Prince. And by receiving\nbaptism at the hands of this popular young teacher, they thought to\nstrengthen their influence with the people.\nJohn met them with the scathing inquiry, \u201cO generation of vipers,\nwho hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth\ntherefore fruits meet for repentance; and think not to say within\nyourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that [106]\nGod is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.\u201d\nThe Jews had misinterpreted God\u2019s promise of eternal favor to\nIsrael: \u201cThus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by day,\nand the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night,\nwhich divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The Lord of\nhosts is His name: If those ordinances depart from before Me, saith\nthe Lord, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation\nbefore Me forever. Thus saith the Lord; If heaven above can be\nmeasured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I\nwill also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done,\nsaith the Lord.\u201d Jeremiah 31:35-37. The Jews regarded their natural\ndescent from Abraham as giving them a claim to this promise. But\nthey overlooked the conditions which God had specified. Before\ngiving the promise, He had said, \u201cI will put My law in their inward\nparts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they\nshall be My people.... For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will\nremember their sin no more.\u201d Jeremiah 31:33, 34.\nTo a people in whose hearts His law is written, the favor of God\nis assured. They are one with Him. But the Jews had separated\nthemselves from God. Because of their sins they were suffering\nunder His judgments. This was the cause of their bondage to a\n78 The Desire of Ages\nheathen nation. Their minds were darkened by transgression, and\nbecause in times past the Lord had shown them so great favor, they\nexcused their sins. They flattered themselves that they were better\nthan other men, and entitled to His blessings.\nThese things \u201care written for our admonition, upon whom the\nends of the world are come.\u201d 1 Corinthians 10:11. How often we\nmisinterpret God\u2019s blessings, and flatter ourselves that we are favored\non account of some goodness in us! God cannot do for us that which\nHe longs to do. His gifts are used to increase our self-satisfaction,\nand to harden our hearts in unbelief and sin.\nJohn declared to the teachers of Israel that their pride, selfishness,\nand cruelty showed them to be a generation of vipers, a deadly curse\nto the people, rather than the children of just and obedient Abraham.\nIn view of the light they had received from God, they were even\nworse than the heathen, to whom they felt so much superior. They\nhad forgotten the rock whence they were hewn, and the hole of the\npit from which they had been digged. God was not dependent upon\nthem for the fulfilling of His purpose. As He had called Abraham[107]\nout from a heathen people, so He could call others to His service.\nTheir hearts might now appear as lifeless as the stones of the desert,\nbut His Spirit could quicken them to do His will, and receive the\nfulfillment of His promise.\n\u201cAnd now also,\u201d said the prophet, \u201cthe ax is laid unto the root of\nthe trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is\nhewn down, and cast into the fire.\u201d Not by its name, but by its fruit,\nis the value of a tree determined. If the fruit is worthless, the name\ncannot save the tree from destruction. John declared to the Jews that\ntheir standing before God was to be decided by their character and\nlife. Profession was worthless. If their life and character were not in\nharmony with God\u2019s law, they were not His people.\nUnder his heart-searching words, his hearers were convicted.\nThey came to him with the inquiry, \u201cWhat shall we do then?\u201d He\nanswered, \u201cHe that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath\nnone; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.\u201d And he warned\nthe publicans against injustice, and the soldiers against violence.\nAll who became the subjects of Christ\u2019s kingdom, he said, would\ngive evidence of faith and repentance. Kindness, honesty, and fidelity\nwould be seen in their lives. They would minister to the needy, and\nVoice in the Wilderness 79\nbring their offerings to God. They would shield the defenseless,\nand give an example of virtue and compassion. So the followers\nof Christ will give evidence of the transforming power of the Holy\nSpirit. In the daily life, justice, mercy, and the love of God will be\nseen. Otherwise they are like the chaff that is given to the fire.\n\u201cI indeed baptize you in water unto repentance,\u201d said John; \u201cbut\nHe that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not\nworthy to bear: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with\nfire.\u201d Matthew 3:11, R. V ., margin. The prophet Isaiah had declared\nthat the Lord would cleanse His people from their iniquities \u201cby the\nspirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.\u201d The word of the\nLord to Israel was, \u201cI will turn My hand upon thee, and purely purge\naway thy dross, and take away all thy tin.\u201d Isaiah 4:4; 1:25. To sin,\nwherever found, \u201cour God is a consuming fire.\u201d Hebrews 12:29. In\nall who submit to His power the Spirit of God will consume sin.\nBut if men cling to sin, they become identified with it. Then the\nglory of God, which destroys sin, must destroy them. Jacob, after\nhis night of wrestling with the Angel, exclaimed, \u201cI have seen God\nface to face, and my life is preserved.\u201d Genesis 32:30. Jacob had [108]\nbeen guilty of a great sin in his conduct toward Esau; but he had\nrepented. His transgression had been forgiven, and his sin purged;\ntherefore he could endure the revelation of God\u2019s presence. But\nwherever men came before God while willfully cherishing evil, they\nwere destroyed. At the second advent of Christ the wicked shall\nbe consumed \u201cwith the Spirit of His mouth,\u201d and destroyed \u201cwith\nthe brightness of His coming.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 2:8. The light of\nthe glory of God, which imparts life to the righteous, will slay the\nwicked.\nIn the time of John the Baptist, Christ was about to appear as\nthe revealer of the character of God. His very presence would make\nmanifest to men their sin. Only as they were willing to be purged\nfrom sin could they enter into fellowship with Him. Only the pure\nin heart could abide in His presence.\nThus the Baptist declared God\u2019s message to Israel. Many gave\nheed to his instruction. Many sacrificed all in order to obey. Multi-\ntudes followed this new teacher from place to place, and not a few\ncherished the hope that he might be the Messiah. But as John saw\n80 The Desire of Ages\nthe people turning to him, he sought every opportunity of directing\ntheir faith to Him who was to come.\nChapter 11\u2014The Baptism [109]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 3:13-17; Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21,\n22.\nTidings of the wilderness prophet and his wonderful announce-\nment, spread throughout Galilee. The message reached the peasants\nin the remotest hill towns, and the fisher folk by the sea, and in\nthese simple, earnest hearts found its truest response. In Nazareth\nit was told in the carpenter shop that had been Joseph\u2019s, and One\nrecognized the call. His time had come. Turning from His daily toil,\nHe bade farewell to His mother, and followed in the steps of His\ncountrymen who were flocking to the Jordan.\nJesus and John the Baptist were cousins, and closely related by\nthe circumstances of their birth; yet they had had no direct acquain-\ntance with each other. The life of Jesus had been spent at Nazareth\nin Galilee; that of John, in the wilderness of Judea. Amid widely\ndifferent surroundings they had lived in seclusion, and had had no\ncommunication with each other. Providence had ordered this. No\noccasion was to be given for the charge that they had conspired\ntogether to support each other\u2019s claims.\nJohn was acquainted with the events that had marked the birth\nof Jesus. He had heard of the visit to Jerusalem in His boyhood,\nand of what had passed in the school of the rabbis. He knew of His\nsinless life, and believed Him to be the Messiah; but of this he had\nno positive assurance. The fact that Jesus had for so many years\nremained in obscurity, giving no special evidence of His mission,\ngave occasion for doubt as to whether He could be the Promised [110]\nOne. The Baptist, however, waited in faith, believing that in God\u2019s\nown time all would be made plain. It had been revealed to him that\nthe Messiah would seek baptism at his hands, and that a sign of His\ndivine character should then be given. Thus he would be enabled to\npresent Him to the people.\n81\n82 The Desire of Ages\nWhen Jesus came to be baptized, John recognized in Him a\npurity of character that he had never before perceived in any man.\nThe very atmosphere of His presence was holy and awe-inspiring.\nAmong the multitudes that had gathered about him at the Jordan,\nJohn had heard dark tales of crime, and had met souls bowed down\nwith the burden of myriad sins; but never had he come in contact with\na human being from whom there breathed an influence so divine. All\nthis was in harmony with what had been revealed to John regarding\nthe Messiah. Yet he shrank from granting the request of Jesus. How\ncould he, a sinner, baptize the Sinless One? And why should He\nwho needed no repentance submit to a rite that was a confession of\nguilt to be washed away?\nAs Jesus asked for baptism, John drew back, exclaiming, \u201cI have[111]\nneed to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?\u201d With firm\nyet gentle authority, Jesus answered, \u201cSuffer it to be so now: for\nthus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.\u201d And John, yielding,\nled the Saviour down into the Jordan, and buried Him beneath the\nwater. \u201cAnd straightway coming up out of the water,\u201d Jesus \u201csaw the\nheavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him.\u201d\nJesus did not receive baptism as a confession of guilt on His own\naccount. He identified Himself with sinners, taking the steps that we\nare to take, and doing the work that we must do. His life of suffering\nand patient endurance after His baptism was also an example to us.\nUpon coming up out of the water, Jesus bowed in prayer on the\nriver bank. A new and important era was opening before Him. He\nwas now, upon a wider stage, entering on the conflict of His life.\nThough He was the Prince of Peace, His coming must be as the\nunsheathing of a sword. The kingdom He had come to establish\nwas the opposite of that which the Jews desired. He who was the\nfoundation of the ritual and economy of Israel would be looked upon\nas its enemy and destroyer. He who had proclaimed the law upon\nSinai would be condemned as a transgressor. He who had come to\nbreak the power of Satan would be denounced as Beelzebub. No one\nupon earth had understood Him, and during His ministry He must\nstill walk alone. Throughout His life His mother and His brothers did\nnot comprehend His mission. Even His disciples did not understand\nHim. He had dwelt in eternal light, as one with God, but His life on\nearth must be spent in solitude.\nBaptism 83\nAs one with us, He must bear the burden of our guilt and woe.\nThe Sinless One must feel the shame of sin. The peace lover must\ndwell with strife, the truth must abide with falsehood, purity with\nvileness. Every sin, every discord, every defiling lust that transgres-\nsion had brought, was torture to His spirit.\nAlone He must tread the path; alone He must bear the burden.\nUpon Him who had laid off His glory and accepted the weakness of\nhumanity the redemption of the world must rest. He saw and felt it\nall, but His purpose remained steadfast. Upon His arm depended the\nsalvation of the fallen race, and He reached out His hand to grasp\nthe hand of Omnipotent Love.\nThe Saviour\u2019s glance seems to penetrate heaven as He pours out\nHis soul in prayer. Well He knows how sin has hardened the hearts\nof men, and how difficult it will be for them to discern His mission, [112]\nand accept the gift of salvation. He pleads with the Father for power\nto overcome their unbelief, to break the fetters with which Satan has\nenthralled them, and in their behalf to conquer the destroyer. He\nasks for the witness that God accepts humanity in the person of His\nSon.\nNever before have the angels listened to such a prayer. They\nare eager to bear to their loved Commander a message of assurance\nand comfort. But no; the Father Himself will answer the petition\nof His Son. Direct from the throne issue the beams of His glory.\nThe heavens are opened, and upon the Saviour\u2019s head descends a\ndovelike form of purest light,\u2014fit emblem of Him, the meek and\nlowly One.\nOf the vast throng at the Jordan, few except John discerned the\nheavenly vision. Yet the solemnity of the divine Presence rested\nupon the assembly. The people stood silently gazing upon Christ.\nHis form was bathed in the light that ever surrounds the throne of\nGod. His upturned face was glorified as they had never before seen\nthe face of man. From the open heavens a voice was heard saying,\n\u201cThis is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\u201d\nThese words of confirmation were given to inspire faith in those\nwho witnessed the scene, and to strengthen the Saviour for His\nmission. Notwithstanding that the sins of a guilty world were laid\nupon Christ, notwithstanding the humiliation of taking upon Himself\n84 The Desire of Ages\nour fallen nature, the voice from heaven declared Him to be the Son\nof the Eternal.\nJohn had been deeply moved as he saw Jesus bowed as a suppli-\nant, pleading with tears for the approval of the Father. As the glory\nof God encircled Him, and the voice from heaven was heard, John\nrecognized the token which God had promised. He knew that it was\nthe world\u2019s Redeemer whom he had baptized. The Holy Spirit rested\nupon him, and with outstretched hand pointing to Jesus, he cried,\n\u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d\nNone among the hearers, and not even the speaker himself, dis-\ncerned the import of these words, \u201cthe Lamb of God.\u201d Upon Mount\nMoriah, Abraham had heard the question of his son, \u201cMy father, ...\nwhere is the lamb for a burnt offering?\u201d The father answered, \u201cMy\nson, God will provide Himself a lamb for a burnt offering.\u201d Genesis\n22:7, 8. And in the ram divinely provided in the place of Isaac,\nAbraham saw a symbol of Him who was to die for the sins of men.\nThe Holy Spirit through Isaiah, taking up the illustration, prophesied\nof the Saviour, \u201cHe is brought as a lamb to the slaughter,\u201d \u201cand the[113]\nLord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all\u201d (Isaiah 53:7, 6); but\nthe people of Israel had not understood the lesson. Many of them\nregarded the sacrificial offerings much as the heathen looked upon\ntheir sacrifices,\u2014as gifts by which they themselves might propitiate\nthe Deity. God desired to teach them that from His own love comes\nthe gift which reconciles them to Himself.\nAnd the word that was spoken to Jesus at the Jordan, \u201cThis is\nMy beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,\u201d embraces humanity.\nGod spoke to Jesus as our representative. With all our sins and\nweaknesses, we are not cast aside as worthless. \u201cHe hath made us\naccepted in the Beloved.\u201d Ephesians 1:6. The glory that rested upon\nChrist is a pledge of the love of God for us. It tells us of the power\nof prayer,\u2014how the human voice may reach the ear of God, and\nour petitions find acceptance in the courts of heaven. By sin, earth\nwas cut off from heaven, and alienated from its communion; but\nJesus has connected it again with the sphere of glory. His love has\nencircled man, and reached the highest heaven. The light which fell\nfrom the open portals upon the head of our Saviour will fall upon\nus as we pray for help to resist temptation. The voice which spoke\nBaptism 85\nto Jesus says to every believing soul, This is My beloved child, in\nwhom I am well pleased.\n\u201cBeloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear\nwhat we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we\nshall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.\u201d 1 John 3:2. Our\nRedeemer has opened the way so that the most sinful, the most\nneedy, the most oppressed and despised, may find access to the\nFather. All may have a home in the mansions which Jesus has gone\nto prepare. \u201cThese things saith He that is holy, He that is true, He\nthat hath the key of David, He that openeth, and no man shutteth;\nand shutteth, and no man openeth; ... behold, I have set before thee\nan open door, and no man can shut it.\u201d Revelation 3:7, 8.\nChapter 12\u2014The Temptation[114]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12, 13; Luke\n4:1-13.\n\u201cAnd Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan,\nand was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.\u201d The words of Mark\nare still more significant. He says, \u201cImmediately the Spirit driveth\nHim into the wilderness. And He was there in the wilderness forty\ndays, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts.\u201d \u201cAnd in those\ndays He did eat nothing.\u201d\nWhen Jesus was led into the wilderness to be tempted, He was\nled by the Spirit of God. He did not invite temptation. He went to\nthe wilderness to be alone, to contemplate His mission and work.\nBy fasting and prayer He was to brace Himself for the bloodstained\npath He must travel. But Satan knew that the Saviour had gone into\nthe wilderness, and he thought this the best time to approach Him.\nMighty issues for the world were at stake in the conflict between\nthe Prince of light and the leader of the kingdom of darkness. After\ntempting man to sin, Satan claimed the earth as his, and styled\nhimself the prince of this world. Having conformed to his own\nnature the father and mother of our race, he thought to establish here\nhis empire. He declared that men had chosen him as their sovereign.\nThrough his control of men, he held dominion over the world. Christ[115]\nhad come to disprove Satan\u2019s claim. As the Son of man, Christ\nwould stand loyal to God. Thus it would be shown that Satan had\nnot gained complete control of the human race, and that his claim\nto the world was false. All who desired deliverance from his power\nwould be set free. The dominion that Adam had lost through sin\nwould be recovered.\nSince the announcement to the serpent in Eden, \u201cI will put enmity\nbetween thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed\u201d\n(Genesis 3:15), Satan had known that he did not hold absolute sway\nover the world. There was seen in men the working of a power\n86\nTemptation 87\nthat withstood his dominion. With intense interest he watched the\nsacrifices offered by Adam and his sons. In these ceremonies he\ndiscerned a symbol of communion between earth and heaven. He set\nhimself to intercept this communion. He misrepresented God, and\nmisinterpreted the rites that pointed to the Saviour. Men were led to\nfear God as one who delighted in their destruction. The sacrifices\nthat should have revealed His love were offered only to appease His\nwrath. Satan excited the evil passions of men, in order to fasten\nhis rule upon them. When God\u2019s written word was given, Satan\nstudied the prophecies of the Saviour\u2019s advent. From generation to\ngeneration he worked to blind the people to these prophecies, that\nthey might reject Christ at His coming.\nAt the birth of Jesus, Satan knew that One had come with a\ndivine commission to dispute his dominion. He trembled at the\nangel\u2019s message attesting the authority of the newborn King. Satan\nwell knew the position that Christ had held in heaven as the Beloved\nof the Father. That the Son of God should come to this earth as a\nman filled him with amazement and with apprehension. He could\nnot fathom the mystery of this great sacrifice. His selfish soul could\nnot understand such love for the deceived race. The glory and peace\nof heaven, and the joy of communion with God, were but dimly\ncomprehended by men; but they were well known to Lucifer, the [116]\ncovering cherub. Since he had lost heaven, he was determined to\nfind revenge by causing others to share his fall. This he would do\nby causing them to undervalue heavenly things, and to set the heart\nupon things of earth.\nNot without hindrance was the Commander of heaven to win the\nsouls of men to His kingdom. From the time when He was a babe in\nBethlehem, He was continually assailed by the evil one. The image\nof God was manifest in Christ, and in the councils of Satan it was\ndetermined that He should be overcome. No human being had come\ninto the world and escaped the power of the deceiver. The forces of\nthe confederacy of evil were set upon His track to engage in warfare\nagainst Him, and if possible to prevail over Him.\nAt the Saviour\u2019s baptism, Satan was among the witnesses. He\nsaw the Father\u2019s glory overshadowing His Son. He heard the voice\nof Jehovah testifying to the divinity of Jesus. Ever since Adam\u2019s sin,\nthe human race had been cut off from direct communion with God;\n88 The Desire of Ages\nthe intercourse between heaven and earth had been through Christ;\nbut now that Jesus had come \u201cin the likeness of sinful flesh\u201d (Romans\n8:3), the Father Himself spoke. He had before communicated with\nhumanity through Christ; now He communicated with humanity\nin Christ. Satan had hoped that God\u2019s abhorrence of evil would\nbring an eternal separation between heaven and earth. But now it\nwas manifest that the connection between God and man had been\nrestored.\nSatan saw that he must either conquer or be conquered. The\nissues of the conflict involved too much to be entrusted to his con-\nfederate angels. He must personally conduct the warfare. All the\nenergies of apostasy were rallied against the Son of God. Christ was\nmade the mark of every weapon of hell.\nMany look on this conflict between Christ and Satan as having\nno special bearing on their own life; and for them it has little inter-\nest. But within the domain of every human heart this controversy is\nrepeated. Never does one leave the ranks of evil for the service of\nGod without encountering the assaults of Satan. The enticements\nwhich Christ resisted were those that we find it so difficult to with-\nstand. They were urged upon Him in as much greater degree as His\ncharacter is superior to ours. With the terrible weight of the sins of\nthe world upon Him, Christ withstood the test upon appetite, upon\nthe love of the world, and upon that love of display which leads to\npresumption. These were the temptations that overcame Adam and[117]\nEve, and that so readily overcome us.\nSatan had pointed to Adam\u2019s sin as proof that God\u2019s law was\nunjust, and could not be obeyed. In our humanity, Christ was to\nredeem Adam\u2019s failure. But when Adam was assailed by the tempter,\nnone of the effects of sin were upon him. He stood in the strength of\nperfect manhood, possessing the full vigor of mind and body. He was\nsurrounded with the glories of Eden, and was in daily communion\nwith heavenly beings. It was not thus with Jesus when He entered\nthe wilderness to cope with Satan. For four thousand years the race\nhad been decreasing in physical strength, in mental power, and in\nmoral worth; and Christ took upon Him the infirmities of degenerate\nhumanity. Only thus could He rescue man from the lowest depths of\nhis degradation.\nTemptation 89\nMany claim that it was impossible for Christ to be overcome by\ntemptation. Then He could not have been placed in Adam\u2019s position;\nHe could not have gained the victory that Adam failed to gain. If we\nhave in any sense a more trying conflict than had Christ, then He\nwould not be able to succor us. But our Saviour took humanity, with\nall its liabilities. He took the nature of man, with the possibility of\nyielding to temptation. We have nothing to bear which He has not\nendured.\nWith Christ, as with the holy pair in Eden, appetite was the\nground of the first great temptation. Just where the ruin began, the\nwork of our redemption must begin. As by the indulgence of appetite\nAdam fell, so by the denial of appetite Christ must overcome. \u201cAnd\nwhen He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He was afterward\nan hungred. And when the tempter came to Him, he said, If Thou be\nthe Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But He\nanswered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone,\nbut by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\u201d\nFrom the time of Adam to that of Christ, self-indulgence had\nincreased the power of the appetites and passions, until they had\nalmost unlimited control. Thus men had become debased and dis-\neased, and of themselves it was impossible for them to overcome.\nIn man\u2019s behalf, Christ conquered by enduring the severest test. For\nour sake He exercised a self-control stronger than hunger or death.\nAnd in this first victory were involved other issues that enter into all\nour conflicts with the powers of darkness.\nWhen Jesus entered the wilderness, He was shut in by the Fa- [118]\nther\u2019s glory. Absorbed in communion with God, He was lifted above\nhuman weakness. But the glory departed, and He was left to battle\nwith temptation. It was pressing upon Him every moment. His\nhuman nature shrank from the conflict that awaited Him. For forty\ndays He fasted and prayed. Weak and emaciated from hunger, worn\nand haggard with mental agony, \u201cHis visage was so marred more\nthan any man, and His form more than the sons of men.\u201d Isaiah\n52:14. Now was Satan\u2019s opportunity. Now he supposed that he\ncould overcome Christ.\nThere came to the Saviour, as if in answer to His prayers, one in\nthe guise of an angel from heaven. He claimed to have a commission\nfrom God to declare that Christ\u2019s fast was at an end. As God had\n90 The Desire of Ages\nsent an angel to stay the hand of Abraham from offering Isaac, so,\nsatisfied with Christ\u2019s willingness to enter the bloodstained path, the\nFather had sent an angel to deliver Him; this was the message brought\nto Jesus. The Saviour was faint from hunger, He was craving for\nfood, when Satan came suddenly upon Him. Pointing to the stones\nwhich strewed the desert, and which had the appearance of loaves,\nthe tempter said, \u201cIf Thou be the Son of God, command that these\nstones be made bread.\u201d\nThough he appears as an angel of light, these first words betray\nhis character. \u201cIf Thou be the Son of God.\u201d Here is the insinuation\nof distrust. Should Jesus do what Satan suggests, it would be an\nacceptance of the doubt. The tempter plans to overthrow Christ by\nthe same means that were so successful with the human race in the\nbeginning. How artfully had Satan approached Eve in Eden! \u201cYea,\nhath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?\u201d Genesis\n3:1. Thus far the tempter\u2019s words were truth; but in his manner of\nspeaking them there was a disguised contempt for the words of God.\nThere was a covert negative, a doubt of the divine truthfulness. Satan\nsought to instill into the mind of Eve the thought that God would not\ndo as He had said; that the withholding of such beautiful fruit was\na contradiction of His love and compassion for man. So now the\ntempter seeks to inspire Christ with his own sentiments. \u201cIf Thou be\nthe Son of God.\u201d The words rankle with bitterness in his mind. In\nthe tones of his voice is an expression of utter incredulity. Would\nGod treat His own Son thus? Would He leave Him in the desert with\nwild beasts, without food, without companions, without comfort?\nHe insinuates that God never meant His Son to be in such a state\nas this. \u201cIf Thou be the Son of God,\u201d show Thy power by relieving[119]\nThyself of this pressing hunger. Command that this stone be made\nbread.\nThe words from heaven, \u201cThis is My beloved Son, in whom I\nam well pleased\u201d (Matthew 3:17), were still sounding in the ears\nof Satan. But he was determined to make Christ disbelieve this\ntestimony. The word of God was Christ\u2019s assurance of His divine\nmission. He had come to live as a man among men, and it was\nthe word that declared His connection with heaven. It was Satan\u2019s\npurpose to cause Him to doubt that word. If Christ\u2019s confidence\nin God could be shaken, Satan knew that the victory in the whole\nTemptation 91\ncontroversy would be his. He could overcome Jesus. He hoped that\nunder the force of despondency and extreme hunger, Christ would\nlose faith in His Father, and work a miracle in His own behalf. Had\nHe done this, the plan of salvation would have been broken.\nWhen Satan and the Son of God first met in conflict, Christ\nwas the commander of the heavenly hosts; and Satan, the leader of\nrevolt in heaven, was cast out. Now their condition is apparently\nreversed, and Satan makes the most of his supposed advantage. One\nof the most powerful of the angels, he says, has been banished from\nheaven. The appearance of Jesus indicates that He is that fallen\nangel, forsaken by God, and deserted by man. A divine being would\nbe able to sustain his claim by working a miracle; \u201cif Thou be the\nSon of God, command this stone that it be made bread.\u201d Such an act\nof creative power, urges the tempter, would be conclusive evidence\nof divinity. It would bring the controversy to an end.\nNot without a struggle could Jesus listen in silence to the arch-\ndeceiver. But the Son of God was not to prove His divinity to Satan,\nor to explain the reason of His humiliation. By conceding to the\ndemands of the rebel, nothing for the good of man or the glory of\nGod would be gained. Had Christ complied with the suggestion\nof the enemy, Satan would still have said, Show me a sign that I\nmay believe you to be the Son of God. Evidence would have been\nworthless to break the power of rebellion in his heart. And Christ\nwas not to exercise divine power for His own benefit. He had come\nto bear trial as we must do, leaving us an example of faith and\nsubmission. Neither here nor at any subsequent time in His earthly\nlife did He work a miracle in His own behalf. His wonderful works\nwere all for the good of others. Though Jesus recognized Satan from\nthe beginning, He was not provoked to enter into controversy with\nhim. Strengthened with the memory of the voice from heaven, He [120]\nrested in His Father\u2019s love. He would not parley with temptation.\nJesus met Satan with the words of Scripture. \u201cIt is written,\u201d He\nsaid. In every temptation the weapon of His warfare was the word of\nGod. Satan demanded of Christ a miracle as a sign of His divinity.\nBut that which is greater than all miracles, a firm reliance upon a\n\u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d was a sign that could not be controverted.\nSo long as Christ held to this position, the tempter could gain no\nadvantage.\n92 The Desire of Ages\nIt was in the time of greatest weakness that Christ was assailed\nby the fiercest temptations. Thus Satan thought to prevail. By this\npolicy he had gained the victory over men. When strength failed,\nand the will power weakened, and faith ceased to repose in God, then\nthose who had stood long and valiantly for the right were overcome.\nMoses was wearied with the forty years\u2019 wandering of Israel, when\nfor the moment his faith let go its hold upon infinite power. He failed\njust upon the borders of the Promised Land. So with Elijah, who had\nstood undaunted before King Ahab, who had faced the whole nation\nof Israel, with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal at their\nhead. After that terrible day upon Carmel, when the false prophets\nhad been slain, and the people had declared their allegiance to God,\nElijah fled for his life before the threats of the idolatrous Jezebel.\nThus Satan has taken advantage of the weakness of humanity. And\nhe will still work in the same way. Whenever one is encompassed\nwith clouds, perplexed by circumstances, or afflicted by poverty or\ndistress, Satan is at hand to tempt and annoy. He attacks our weak\npoints of character. He seeks to shake our confidence in God, who\nsuffers such a condition of things to exist. We are tempted to distrust\nGod, to question His love. Often the tempter comes to us as he\ncame to Christ, arraying before us our weakness and infirmities. He[121]\nhopes to discourage the soul, and to break our hold on God. Then\nhe is sure of his prey. If we would meet him as Jesus did, we should\nescape many a defeat. By parleying with the enemy, we give him an\nadvantage.\nWhen Christ said to the tempter, \u201cMan shall not live by bread\nalone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,\u201d\nHe repeated the words that, more than fourteen hundred years before,\nHe had spoken to Israel: \u201cThe Lord thy God led thee these forty\nyears in the wilderness.... And He humbled thee, and suffered thee\nto hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither\ndid thy fathers know; that He might make thee know that man doth\nnot live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of\nthe mouth of the Lord doth man live.\u201d Deuteronomy 8:2, 3. In\nthe wilderness, when all means of sustenance failed, God sent His\npeople manna from heaven; and a sufficient and constant supply\nwas given. This provision was to teach them that while they trusted\nin God and walked in His ways He would not forsake them. The\nTemptation 93\nSaviour now practiced the lesson He had taught to Israel. By the\nword of God succor had been given to the Hebrew host, and by the\nsame word it would be given to Jesus. He awaited God\u2019s time to\nbring relief. He was in the wilderness in obedience to God, and He\nwould not obtain food by following the suggestions of Satan. In\nthe presence of the witnessing universe, He testified that it is a less\ncalamity to suffer whatever may befall than to depart in any manner\nfrom the will of God.\n\u201cMan shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.\u201d\nOften the follower of Christ is brought where he cannot serve God\nand carry forward his worldly enterprises. Perhaps it appears that\nobedience to some plain requirement of God will cut off his means\nof support. Satan would make him believe that he must sacrifice\nhis conscientious convictions. But the only thing in our world upon\nwhich we can rely is the word of God. \u201cSeek ye first the kingdom of\nGod, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto\nyou.\u201d Matthew 6:33. Even in this life it is not for our good to depart\nfrom the will of our Father in heaven. When we learn the power of\nHis word, we shall not follow the suggestions of Satan in order to\nobtain food or to save our lives. Our only questions will be, What is\nGod\u2019s command? and what His promise? Knowing these, we shall\nobey the one, and trust the other.\nIn the last great conflict of the controversy with Satan those who\nare loyal to God will see every earthly support cut off. Because they\nrefuse to break His law in obedience to earthly powers, they will be [122]\nforbidden to buy or sell. It will finally be decreed that they shall be\nput to death. See Revelation 13:11-17. But to the obedient is given\nthe promise, \u201cHe shall dwell on high: his place of defense shall be\nthe munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be\nsure.\u201d Isaiah 33:16. By this promise the children of God will live.\nWhen the earth shall be wasted with famine, they shall be fed. \u201cThey\nshall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they\nshall be satisfied.\u201d Psalm 37:19. To that time of distress the prophet\nHabakkuk looked forward, and his words express the faith of the\nchurch: \u201cAlthough the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit\nbe in the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall\nyield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall\n94 The Desire of Ages\nbe no herd in the stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in\nthe God of my salvation.\u201d Habakkuk 3:17, 18.\nOf all the lessons to be learned from our Lord\u2019s first great temp-\ntation none is more important than that bearing upon the control of\nthe appetites and passions. In all ages, temptations appealing to the\nphysical nature have been most effectual in corrupting and degrading\nmankind. Through intemperance, Satan works to destroy the mental\nand moral powers that God gave to man as a priceless endowment.\nThus it becomes impossible for men to appreciate things of eternal\nworth. Through sensual indulgence, Satan seeks to blot from the\nsoul every trace of likeness to God.\nThe uncontrolled indulgence and consequent disease and degra-\ndation that existed at Christ\u2019s first advent will again exist, with\nintensity of evil, before His second coming. Christ declares that\nthe condition of the world will be as in the days before the Flood,\nand as in Sodom and Gomorrah. Every imagination of the thoughts\nof the heart will be evil continually. Upon the very verge of that\nfearful time we are now living, and to us should come home the\nlesson of the Saviour\u2019s fast. Only by the inexpressible anguish which\nChrist endured can we estimate the evil of unrestrained indulgence.\nHis example declares that our only hope of eternal life is through\nbringing the appetites and passions into subjection to the will of\nGod.\nIn our own strength it is impossible for us to deny the clamors of\nour fallen nature. Through this channel Satan will bring temptation\nupon us. Christ knew that the enemy would come to every human\nbeing, to take advantage of hereditary weakness, and by his false\ninsinuations to ensnare all whose trust is not in God. And by passing\nover the ground which man must travel, our Lord has prepared the[123]\nway for us to overcome. It is not His will that we should be placed\nat a disadvantage in the conflict with Satan. He would not have us\nintimidated and discouraged by the assaults of the serpent. \u201cBe of\ngood cheer,\u201d He says; \u201cI have overcome the world.\u201d John 16:33.\nLet him who is struggling against the power of appetite look to\nthe Saviour in the wilderness of temptation. See Him in His agony\nupon the cross, as He exclaimed, \u201cI thirst.\u201d He has endured all that\nit is possible for us to bear. His victory is ours.\nTemptation 95\nJesus rested upon the wisdom and strength of His heavenly Fa-\nther. He declares, \u201cThe Lord God will help Me; therefore shall I not\nbe confounded: ... and I know that I shall not be ashamed.... Behold,\nthe Lord God will help Me.\u201d Pointing to His own example, He says\nto us, \u201cWho is among you that feareth the Lord, ... that walketh in\ndarkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord,\nand stay upon his God.\u201d Isaiah 50:7-10.\n\u201cThe prince of this world cometh,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cand hath nothing\nin Me.\u201d John 14:30. There was in Him nothing that responded\nto Satan\u2019s sophistry. He did not consent to sin. Not even by a\nthought did He yield to temptation. So it may be with us. Christ\u2019s\nhumanity was united with divinity; He was fitted for the conflict by\nthe indwelling of the Holy Spirit. And He came to make us partakers\nof the divine nature. So long as we are united to Him by faith, sin\nhas no more dominion over us. God reaches for the hand of faith\nin us to direct it to lay fast hold upon the divinity of Christ, that we\nmay attain to perfection of character.\nAnd how this is accomplished, Christ has shown us. By what\nmeans did He overcome in the conflict with Satan? By the word of\nGod. Only by the word could He resist temptation. \u201cIt is written,\u201d He\nsaid. And unto us are given \u201cexceeding great and precious promises:\nthat by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having\nescaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.\u201d 2 Peter\n1:4. Every promise in God\u2019s word is ours. \u201cBy every word that\nproceedeth out of the mouth of God\u201d are we to live. When assailed\nby temptation, look not to circumstances or to the weakness of self,\nbut to the power of the word. All its strength is yours. \u201cThy word,\u201d\nsays the psalmist, \u201chave I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin\nagainst Thee.\u201d \u201cBy the word of Thy lips I have kept me from the\npaths of the destroyer.\u201d Psalm 119:11; 17:4.\nChapter 13\u2014The Victory[124]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 4:5-11; Mark 1:12, 13; Luke\n4:5-13.\n\u201cThen the devil taketh Him up into the holy city, and setteth Him\non a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto Him, If Thou be the Son\nof God, cast Thyself down: for it is written,\u2014\n\u201cHe shall give His angels charge concerning Thee:\nAnd in their hands they shall bear Thee up,\nLest at any time Thou dash Thy foot against a stone.\u201d\nSatan now supposes that he has met Jesus on His own ground.\nThe wily foe himself presents words that proceeded from the mouth\nof God. He still appears as an angel of light, and he makes it evident\nthat he is acquainted with the Scriptures, and understands the import\nof what is written. As Jesus before used the word of God to sustain\nHis faith, the tempter now uses it to countenance his deception. He\nclaims that he has been only testing the fidelity of Jesus, and he now\ncommends His steadfastness. As the Saviour has manifested trust in\nGod, Satan urges Him to give still another evidence of His faith.\nBut again the temptation is prefaced with the insinuation of\ndistrust, \u201cIf Thou be the Son of God.\u201d Christ was tempted to answer\nthe \u201cif;\u201d but He refrained from the slightest acceptance of the doubt.\nHe would not imperil His life in order to give evidence to Satan.\nThe tempter thought to take advantage of Christ\u2019s humanity, and[125]\nurge Him to presumption. But while Satan can solicit, he cannot\ncompel to sin. He said to Jesus, \u201cCast Thyself down,\u201d knowing that\nhe could not cast Him down; for God would interpose to deliver\nHim. Nor could Satan force Jesus to cast Himself down. Unless\nChrist should consent to temptation, He could not be overcome. Not\nall the power of earth or hell could force Him in the slightest degree\nto depart from the will of His Father.\n96\nVictory 97\nThe tempter can never compel us to do evil. He cannot control\nminds unless they are yielded to his control. The will must consent,\nfaith must let go its hold upon Christ, before Satan can exercise his\npower upon us. But every sinful desire we cherish affords him a\nfoothold. Every point in which we fail of meeting the divine standard\nis an open door by which he can enter to tempt and destroy us. And\nevery failure or defeat on our part gives occasion for him to reproach\nChrist.\nWhen Satan quoted the promise, \u201cHe shall give His angels charge\nover Thee,\u201d he omitted the words, \u201cto keep Thee in all Thy ways;\u201d\nthat is, in all the ways of God\u2019s choosing. Jesus refused to go outside\nthe path of obedience. While manifesting perfect trust in His Father,\nHe would not place Himself, unbidden, in a position that would\nnecessitate the interposition of His Father to save Him from death.\nHe would not force Providence to come to His rescue, and thus fail\nof giving man an example of trust and submission.\nJesus declared to Satan, \u201cIt is written again, Thou shalt not\ntempt the Lord thy God.\u201d These words were spoken by Moses to the\nchildren of Israel when they thirsted in the desert, and demanded\nthat Moses should give them water, exclaiming, \u201cIs the Lord among\nus, or not?\u201d Exodus 17:7. God had wrought marvelously for them; [126]\nyet in trouble they doubted Him, and demanded evidence that He\nwas with them. In their unbelief they sought to put Him to the test.\nAnd Satan was urging Christ to do the same thing. God had already\ntestified that Jesus was His Son; and now to ask for proof that He was\nthe Son of God would be putting God\u2019s word to the test,\u2014tempting\nHim. And the same would be true of asking for that which God had\nnot promised. It would manifest distrust, and be really proving, or\ntempting, Him. We should not present our petitions to God to prove\nwhether He will fulfill His word, but because He will fulfill it; not\nto prove that He loves us, but because He loves us. \u201cWithout faith it\nis impossible to please Him: for he that cometh to God must believe\nthat He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek\nHim.\u201d Hebrews 11:6.\nBut faith is in no sense allied to presumption. Only he who has\ntrue faith is secure against presumption. For presumption is Satan\u2019s\ncounterfeit of faith. Faith claims God\u2019s promises, and brings forth\nfruit in obedience. Presumption also claims the promises, but uses\n98 The Desire of Ages\nthem as Satan did, to excuse transgression. Faith would have led\nour first parents to trust the love of God, and to obey His commands.\nPresumption led them to transgress His law, believing that His great\nlove would save them from the consequence of their sin. It is not\nfaith that claims the favor of Heaven without complying with the\nconditions on which mercy is to be granted. Genuine faith has its\nfoundation in the promises and provisions of the Scriptures.\nOften when Satan has failed of exciting distrust, he succeeds\nin leading us to presumption. If he can cause us to place ourselves\nunnecessarily in the way of temptation, he knows that the victory is\nhis. God will preserve all who walk in the path of obedience; but to\ndepart from it is to venture on Satan\u2019s ground. There we are sure to\nfall. The Saviour has bidden us, \u201cWatch ye and pray, lest ye enter\ninto temptation.\u201d Mark 14:38. Meditation and prayer would keep us\nfrom rushing unbidden into the way of danger, and thus we should\nbe saved from many a defeat.\nYet we should not lose courage when assailed by temptation.\nOften when placed in a trying situation we doubt that the Spirit of\nGod has been leading us. But it was the Spirit\u2019s leading that brought\nJesus into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan. When God brings\nus into trial, He has a purpose to accomplish for our good. Jesus did\nnot presume on God\u2019s promises by going unbidden into temptation,\nneither did He give up to despondency when temptation came upon[127]\n[128]\n[129]\nHim. Nor should we. \u201cGod is faithful, who will not suffer you to\nbe tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also\nmake a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.\u201d He says, \u201cOffer\nunto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the Most High: and\ncall upon Me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt\nglorify Me.\u201d 1 Corinthians 10:13; Psalm 50:14, 15.\nJesus was victor in the second temptation, and now Satan man-\nifests himself in his true character. But he does not appear as a\nhideous monster, with cloven feet and bat\u2019s wings. He is a mighty\nangel, though fallen. He avows himself the leader of rebellion and\nthe god of this world.\nPlacing Jesus upon a high mountain, Satan caused the kingdoms\nof the world, in all their glory, to pass in panoramic view before Him.\nThe sunlight lay on templed cities, marble palaces, fertile fields, and\nfruit-laden vineyards. The traces of evil were hidden. The eyes of\nVictory 99\nJesus, so lately greeted by gloom and desolation, now gazed upon a\nscene of unsurpassed loveliness and prosperity. Then the tempter\u2019s\nvoice was heard: \u201cAll this power will I give Thee, and the glory of\nthem: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give\nit. If Thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be Thine.\u201d\nChrist\u2019s mission could be fulfilled only through suffering. Before\nHim was a life of sorrow, hardship, and conflict, and an ignominious\ndeath. He must bear the sins of the whole world. He must endure\nseparation from His Father\u2019s love. Now the tempter offered to yield\nup the power he had usurped. Christ might deliver Himself from\nthe dreadful future by acknowledging the supremacy of Satan. But\nto do this was to yield the victory in the great controversy. It was\nin seeking to exalt himself above the Son of God that Satan had\nsinned in heaven. Should he prevail now, it would be the triumph of\nrebellion.\nWhen Satan declared to Christ, The kingdom and glory of the\nworld are delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give it, he\nstated what was true only in part, and he declared it to serve his\nown purpose of deception. Satan\u2019s dominion was that wrested from\nAdam, but Adam was the vicegerent of the Creator. His was not\nan independent rule. The earth is God\u2019s, and He has committed all\nthings to His Son. Adam was to reign subject to Christ. When Adam\nbetrayed his sovereignty into Satan\u2019s hands, Christ still remained\nthe rightful King. Thus the Lord had said to King Nebuchadnezzar,\n\u201cThe Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to [130]\nwhomsoever He will.\u201d Daniel 4:17. Satan can exercise his usurped\nauthority only as God permits.\nWhen the tempter offered to Christ the kingdom and glory of\nthe world, he was proposing that Christ should yield up the real\nkingship of the world, and hold dominion subject to Satan. This was\nthe same dominion upon which the hopes of the Jews were set. They\ndesired the kingdom of this world. If Christ had consented to offer\nthem such a kingdom, they would gladly have received Him. But\nthe curse of sin, with all its woe, rested upon it. Christ declared to\nthe tempter, \u201cGet thee behind Me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt\nworship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.\u201d\nBy the one who had revolted in heaven the kingdoms of this\nworld were offered Christ, to buy His homage to the principles\n100 The Desire of Ages\nof evil; but He would not be bought; He had come to establish a\nkingdom of righteousness, and He would not abandon His purpose.\nWith the same temptation Satan approaches men, and here he has\nbetter success than with Christ. To men he offers the kingdom of this\nworld on condition that they will acknowledge his supremacy. He\nrequires that they sacrifice integrity, disregard conscience, indulge\nselfishness. Christ bids them seek first the kingdom of God, and\nHis righteousness; but Satan walks by their side and says: Whatever\nmay be true in regard to life eternal, in order to make a success in\nthis world you must serve me. I hold your welfare in my hands. I\ncan give you riches, pleasures, honor, and happiness. Hearken to my\ncounsel. Do not allow yourselves to be carried away with whimsical\nnotions of honesty or self-sacrifice. I will prepare the way before\nyou. Thus multitudes are deceived. They consent to live for the\nservice of self, and Satan is satisfied. While he allures them with\nthe hope of worldly dominion, he gains dominion over the soul. But\nhe offers that which is not his to bestow, and which is soon to be\nwrested from him. In return he beguiles them of their title to the\ninheritance of the sons of God.\nSatan had questioned whether Jesus was the Son of God. In his\nsummary dismissal he had proof that he could not gainsay. Divinity\nflashed through suffering humanity. Satan had no power to resist\nthe command. Writhing with humiliation and rage, he was forced\nto withdraw from the presence of the world\u2019s Redeemer. Christ\u2019s\nvictory was as complete as had been the failure of Adam.\nSo we may resist temptation, and force Satan to depart from us.\nJesus gained the victory through submission and faith in God, and\nby the apostle He says to us, \u201cSubmit yourselves therefore to God.[131]\nResist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and\nHe will draw nigh to you.\u201d James 4:7, 8. We cannot save ourselves\nfrom the tempter\u2019s power; he has conquered humanity, and when\nwe try to stand in our own strength, we shall become a prey to his\ndevices; but \u201cthe name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous\nrunneth into it, and is safe.\u201d Proverbs 18:10. Satan trembles and\nflees before the weakest soul who finds refuge in that mighty name.\nAfter the foe had departed, Jesus fell exhausted to the earth, with\nthe pallor of death upon His face. The angels of heaven had watched\nthe conflict, beholding their loved Commander as He passed through\nVictory 101\ninexpressible suffering to make a way of escape for us. He had\nendured the test, greater than we shall ever be called to endure. The\nangels now ministered to the Son of God as He lay like one dying.\nHe was strengthened with food, comforted with the message of His\nFather\u2019s love and the assurance that all heaven triumphed in His\nvictory. Warming to life again, His great heart goes out in sympathy\nfor man, and He goes forth to complete the work He has begun; to\nrest not until the foe is vanquished, and our fallen race redeemed.\nNever can the cost of our redemption be realized until the re-\ndeemed shall stand with the Redeemer before the throne of God.\nThen as the glories of the eternal home burst upon our enraptured\nsenses we shall remember that Jesus left all this for us, that He not\nonly became an exile from the heavenly courts, but for us took the\nrisk of failure and eternal loss. Then we shall cast our crowns at\nHis feet, and raise the song, \u201cWorthy is the Lamb that was slain to\nreceive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and\nglory, and blessing.\u201d Revelation 5:12.\nChapter 14\u2014\u201cWe Have Found the Messias\u201d[132]\nThis chapter is based on John 1:19-51.\nJohn the Baptist was now preaching and baptizing at Bethabara,\nbeyond Jordan. It was not far from this spot that God had stayed the\nriver in its flow until Israel had passed over. A little distance from\nhere the stronghold of Jericho had been overthrown by the armies of\nheaven. The memory of these events was at this time revived, and\ngave a thrilling interest to the Baptist\u2019s message. Would not He who\nhad wrought so wonderfully in ages past again manifest His power\nfor Israel\u2019s deliverance? Such was the thought stirring the hearts of\nthe people who daily thronged the banks of the Jordan.\nThe preaching of John had taken so deep a hold on the nation as\nto demand the attention of the religious authorities. The danger of\ninsurrection caused every popular gathering to be looked upon with\nsuspicion by the Romans, and whatever pointed toward an uprising\nof the people excited the fears of the Jewish rulers. John had not\nrecognized the authority of the Sanhedrin by seeking their sanction\nfor his work; and he had reproved rulers and people, Pharisees and[133]\nSadducees alike. Yet the people followed him eagerly. The interest\nin his work seemed to be continually increasing. Though he had not\ndeferred to them, the Sanhedrin accounted that, as a public teacher,\nhe was under their jurisdiction.\nThis body was made up of members chosen from the priesthood,\nand from the chief rulers and teachers of the nation. The high priest\nwas usually the president. All its members were to be men advanced\nin years, though not aged; men of learning, not only versed in Jewish\nreligion and history, but in general knowledge. They were to be\nwithout physical blemish, and must be married men, and fathers,\nas being more likely than others to be humane and considerate.\nTheir place of meeting was an apartment connected with the temple\nat Jerusalem. In the days of Jewish independence the Sanhedrin\nwas the supreme court of the nation, possessing secular as well as\n102\n\u201cWe Have Found the Messias\u201d 103\necclesiastical authority. Though now subordinated by the Roman\ngovernors, it still exercised a strong influence in civil as well as\nreligious matters.\nThe Sanhedrin could not well defer an investigation of John\u2019s\nwork. There were some who recalled the revelation made to\nZacharias in the temple, and the father\u2019s prophecy, that had pointed\nto his child as the Messiah\u2019s herald. In the tumults and changes of\nthirty years, these things had in a great measure been lost sight of.\nThey were now called to mind by the excitement concerning the\nministry of John.\nIt was long since Israel had had a prophet, long since such a\nreformation as was now in progress had been witnessed. The demand\nfor confession of sin seemed new and startling. Many among the\nleaders would not go to hear John\u2019s appeals and denunciations, lest\nthey should be led to disclose the secrets of their own lives. Yet his\npreaching was a direct announcement of the Messiah. It was well\nknown that the seventy weeks of Daniel\u2019s prophecy, covering the\nMessiah\u2019s advent, were nearly ended; and all were eager to share\nin that era of national glory which was then expected. Such was\nthe popular enthusiasm that the Sanhedrin would soon be forced\neither to sanction or to reject John\u2019s work. Already their power over\nthe people was waning. It was becoming a serious question how to\nmaintain their position. In the hope of arriving at some conclusion,\nthey dispatched to the Jordan a deputation of priests and Levites to\nconfer with the new teacher.\nA multitude were gathered, listening to his words, when the\ndelegates approached. With an air of authority designed to impress\nthe people and to command the deference of the prophet the haughty [134]\nrabbis came. With a movement of respect, almost of fear, the crowd\nopened to let them pass. The great men, in their rich robes, in the\npride of rank and power, stood before the prophet of the wilderness.\n\u201cWho art thou?\u201d they demanded.\nKnowing what was in their thoughts, John answered, \u201cI am not\nthe Christ.\u201d\n\u201cWhat then? Art thou Elias?\u201d\n\u201cI am not.\u201d\n\u201cArt thou that prophet?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n104 The Desire of Ages\n\u201cWho art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us.\nWhat sayest thou of thyself?\u201d\n\u201cI am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight\nthe way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.\u201d\nThe scripture to which John referred is that beautiful prophecy of\nIsaiah: \u201cComfort ye, comfort ye My people, saith your God. Speak\nye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her appointed[135]\ntime is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned.... The voice of\nhim that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord,\nmake straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley\nshall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low:\nand the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:\nand the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it\ntogether.\u201d Isaiah 40:1-5, margin.\nAnciently, when a king journeyed through the less frequented\nparts of his dominion, a company of men was sent ahead of the\nroyal chariot to level the steep places and to fill up the hollows, that\nthe king might travel in safety and without hindrance. This custom\nis employed by the prophet to illustrate the work of the gospel.\n\u201cEvery valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be\nmade low.\u201d When the Spirit of God, with its marvelous awakening\npower, touches the soul, it abases human pride. Worldly pleasure\nand position and power are seen to be worthless. \u201cImaginations,\nand every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of\nGod\u201d are cast down; every thought is brought into captivity \u201cto the\nobedience of Christ.\u201d 2 Corinthians 10:5. Then humility and self-\nsacrificing love, so little valued among men, are exalted as alone of\nworth. This is the work of the gospel, of which John\u2019s message was\na part.\nThe rabbis continued their questioning: \u201cWhy baptizest thou\nthen, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?\u201d The\nwords \u201cthat prophet\u201d had reference to Moses. The Jews had been\ninclined to the belief that Moses would be raised from the dead, and\ntaken to heaven. They did not know that he had already been raised.\nWhen the Baptist began his ministry, many thought that he might\nbe the prophet Moses risen from the dead, for he seemed to have a\nthorough knowledge of the prophecies and of the history of Israel.\n\u201cWe Have Found the Messias\u201d 105\nIt was believed also that before the Messiah\u2019s advent, Elijah\nwould personally appear. This expectation John met in his denial;\nbut his words had a deeper meaning. Jesus afterward said, referring\nto John, \u201cIf ye are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, which is to\ncome.\u201d Matthew 11:14, R. V . John came in the spirit and power\nof Elijah, to do such a work as Elijah did. If the Jews had received\nhim, it would have been accomplished for them. But they did not\nreceive his message. To them he was not Elijah. He could not fulfill\nfor them the mission he came to accomplish.\nMany of those gathered at the Jordan had been present at the [136]\nbaptism of Jesus; but the sign then given had been manifest to but\nfew among them. During the preceding months of the Baptist\u2019s\nministry, many had refused to heed the call to repentance. Thus they\nhad hardened their hearts and darkened their understanding. When\nHeaven bore testimony to Jesus at His baptism, they perceived it\nnot. Eyes that had never been turned in faith to Him that is invisible\nbeheld not the revelation of the glory of God; ears that had never\nlistened to His voice heard not the words of witness. So it is now.\nOften the presence of Christ and the ministering angels is manifest\nin the assemblies of the people, and yet there are many who know\nit not. They discern nothing unusual. But to some the Saviour\u2019s\npresence is revealed. Peace and joy animate their hearts. They are\ncomforted, encouraged, and blessed.\nThe deputies from Jerusalem had demanded of John, \u201cWhy\nbaptizest thou?\u201d and they were awaiting his answer. Suddenly, as\nhis glance swept over the throng, his eye kindled, his face was\nlighted up, his whole being was stirred with deep emotion. With\noutstretched hands he cried, \u201cI baptize in water: in the midst of you\nstandeth One whom ye know not, even He that cometh after me, the\nlatchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.\u201d John 1:26, 27, R.\nV ., margin.\nThe message was distinct and unequivocal, to be carried back to\nthe Sanhedrin. The words of John could apply to no other than the\nlong-promised One. The Messiah was among them! In amazement\npriests and rulers gazed about them, hoping to discover Him of\nwhom John had spoken. But He was not distinguishable among the\nthrong.\n106 The Desire of Ages\nWhen at the baptism of Jesus, John pointed to Him as the\nLamb of God, a new light was shed upon the Messiah\u2019s work. The\nprophet\u2019s mind was directed to the words of Isaiah, \u201cHe is brought as\na lamb to the slaughter.\u201d Isaiah 53:7. During the weeks that followed,\nJohn with new interest studied the prophecies and the teaching of the\nsacrificial service. He did not distinguish clearly the two phases of\nChrist\u2019s work,\u2014as a suffering sacrifice and a conquering king,\u2014but\nhe saw that His coming had a deeper significance than priests or[137]\npeople had discerned. When he beheld Jesus among the throng on\nHis return from the desert, he confidently looked for Him to give\nthe people some sign of His true character. Almost impatiently he\nwaited to hear the Saviour declare His mission; but no word was\nspoken, no sign given. Jesus did not respond to the Baptist\u2019s an-\nnouncement of Him, but mingled with the disciples of John, giving\nno outward evidence of His special work, and taking no measures to\nbring Himself to notice.\nThe next day John sees Jesus coming. With the light of the\nglory of God resting upon him, the prophet stretches out his hands,\ndeclaring, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of\nthe world! This is He of whom I said, After me cometh a man which\nis become before me.... And I knew Him not; but that He should be\nmade manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water....\nI have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and\nit abode upon Him. And I knew Him not: but He that sent me to\nbaptize in water, He said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see\nthe Spirit descending, and abiding upon Him, the same is He that\nbaptizeth with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen, and have borne\nwitness that this is the Son of God.\u201d John 1:29-34, R. V ., margin.\nWas this the Christ? With awe and wonder the people looked\nupon the One just declared to be the Son of God. They had been\ndeeply moved by the words of John. He had spoken to them in the\nname of God. They had listened to him day after day as he reproved\ntheir sins, and daily the conviction that he was sent of Heaven had\nstrengthened. But who was this One greater than John the Baptist?\nIn His dress and bearing there was nothing that betokened rank.\nHe was apparently a simple personage, clad like themselves in the\nhumble garments of the poor.\n\u201cWe Have Found the Messias\u201d 107\nThere were in the throng some who at Christ\u2019s baptism had\nbeheld the divine glory, and had heard the voice of God. But since\nthat time the Saviour\u2019s appearance had greatly changed. At His\nbaptism they had seen His countenance transfigured in the light of\nheaven; now, pale, worn, and emaciated, He had been recognized\nonly by the prophet John.\nBut as the people looked upon Him, they saw a face where divine\ncompassion was blended with conscious power. Every glance of the\neye, every feature of the countenance, was marked with humility,\nand expressive of unutterable love. He seemed to be surrounded\nby an atmosphere of spiritual influence. While His manners were [138]\ngentle and unassuming, He impressed men with a sense of power\nthat was hidden, yet could not be wholly concealed. Was this the\nOne for whom Israel had so long waited?\nJesus came in poverty and humiliation, that He might be our\nexample as well as our Redeemer. If He had appeared with kingly\npomp, how could He have taught humility? how could He have\npresented such cutting truths as in the Sermon on the Mount? Where\nwould have been the hope of the lowly in life had Jesus come to\ndwell as a king among men?\nTo the multitude, however, it seemed impossible that the One\ndesignated by John should be associated with their lofty anticipa-\ntions. Thus many were disappointed, and greatly perplexed.\nThe words which the priests and rabbis so much desired to hear,\nthat Jesus would now restore the kingdom to Israel, had not been\nspoken. For such a king they had been waiting and watching; such a\nking they were ready to receive. But one who sought to establish in\ntheir hearts a kingdom of righteousness and peace, they would not\naccept.\nOn the following day, while two disciples were standing near,\nJohn again saw Jesus among the people. Again the face of the\nprophet was lighted up with glory from the Unseen, as he cried,\n\u201cBehold the Lamb of God!\u201d The words thrilled the hearts of the\ndisciples. They did not fully understand them. What meant the name\nthat John had given Him,\u2014\u201cthe Lamb of God\u201d? John himself had\nnot explained it.\nLeaving John, they went to seek Jesus. One of the two was\nAndrew, the brother of Simon; the other was John the evangelist.\n108 The Desire of Ages\nThese were Christ\u2019s first disciples. Moved by an irresistible impulse,\nthey followed Jesus,\u2014anxious to speak with Him, yet awed and\nsilent, lost in the overwhelming significance of the thought, \u201cIs this\nthe Messiah?\u201d\nJesus knew that the disciples were following Him. They were\nthe first fruits of His ministry, and there was joy in the heart of the\ndivine Teacher as these souls responded to His grace. Yet turning,\nHe asked only, \u201cWhat seek ye?\u201d He would leave them free to turn\nback or to speak of their desire.\nOf one purpose only were they conscious. One presence filled\ntheir thought. They exclaimed, \u201cRabbi, ... where dwellest Thou?\u201d\nIn a brief interview by the wayside they could not receive that for\nwhich they longed. They desired to be alone with Jesus, to sit at His\nfeet, and hear His words.\n\u201cHe saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where [139]\nHe dwelt, and abode with Him that day.\u201d\nIf John and Andrew had possessed the unbelieving spirit of the\npriests and rulers, they would not have been found as learners at the\nfeet of Jesus. They would have come to Him as critics, to judge His\nwords. Many thus close the door to the most precious opportunities.\nBut not so did these first disciples. They had responded to the Holy\nSpirit\u2019s call in the preaching of John the Baptist. Now they recog-\nnized the voice of the heavenly Teacher. To them the words of Jesus\nwere full of freshness and truth and beauty. A divine illumination\nwas shed upon the teaching of the Old Testament Scriptures. The\nmany-sided themes of truth stood out in new light.\nIt is contrition and faith and love that enable the soul to receive\nwisdom from heaven. Faith working by love is the key of knowledge,\nand everyone that loveth \u201cknoweth God.\u201d 1 John 4:7.\nThe disciple John was a man of earnest and deep affection,\nardent, yet contemplative. He had begun to discern the glory of\nChrist,\u2014not the worldly pomp and power for which he had been\ntaught to hope, but \u201cthe glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father,\nfull of grace and truth.\u201d John 1:14. He was absorbed in contemplation\nof the wondrous theme.\nAndrew sought to impart the joy that filled his heart. Going in\nsearch of his brother Simon, he cried, \u201cWe have found the Messias.\u201d\nSimon waited for no second bidding. He also had heard the preach-\n\u201cWe Have Found the Messias\u201d 109\ning of John the Baptist, and he hastened to the Saviour. The eye of\nChrist rested upon him, reading his character and his life history.\nHis impulsive nature, his loving, sympathetic heart, his ambition\nand self-confidence, the history of his fall, his repentance, his labors,\nand his martyr death,\u2014the Saviour read it all, and He said, \u201cThou\nart Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by\ninterpretation, A stone.\u201d\n\u201cThe day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth\nPhilip, and saith unto him, Follow Me.\u201d Philip obeyed the command,\nand straightway he also became a worker for Christ.\nPhilip called Nathanael. The latter had been among the throng\nwhen the Baptist pointed to Jesus as the Lamb of God. As Nathanael\nlooked upon Jesus, he was disappointed. Could this man, who bore\nthe marks of toil and poverty, be the Messiah? Yet Nathanael could\nnot decide to reject Jesus, for the message of John had brought\nconviction to his heart.\nAt the time when Philip called him, Nathanael had withdrawn [140]\nto a quiet grove to meditate upon the announcement of John and\nthe prophecies concerning the Messiah. He prayed that if the one\nannounced by John was the deliverer, it might be made known to\nhim, and the Holy Spirit rested upon him with assurance that God\nhad visited His people and raised up a horn of salvation for them.\nPhilip knew that his friend was searching the prophecies, and while\nNathanael was praying under a fig tree, Philip discovered his retreat.\nThey had often prayed together in this secluded spot hidden by the\nfoliage.\nThe message, \u201cWe have found Him, of whom Moses in the law,\nand the prophets, did write,\u201d seemed to Nathanael a direct answer to\nhis prayer. But Philip had yet a trembling faith. He added doubtfully,\n\u201cJesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\u201d Again prejudice arose in\nNathanael\u2019s heart. He exclaimed, \u201cCan there any good thing come\nout of Nazareth?\u201d\nPhilip entered into no controversy. He said, \u201cCome and see.\nJesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and saith of him, Behold\nan Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!\u201d In surprise Nathanael\nexclaimed, \u201cWhence knowest Thou me? Jesus answered and said\nunto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the\nfig tree, I saw thee.\u201d\n110 The Desire of Ages\nIt was enough. The divine Spirit that had borne witness to\nNathanael in his solitary prayer under the fig tree now spoke to\nhim in the words of Jesus. Though in doubt, and yielding somewhat\nto prejudice, Nathanael had come to Christ with an honest desire for\ntruth, and now his desire was met. His faith went beyond that of the\none who had brought him to Jesus. He answered and said, \u201cRabbi,\nThou art the Son of God; Thou art the King of Israel.\u201d\nIf Nathanael had trusted to the rabbis for guidance, he would\nnever have found Jesus. It was by seeing and judging for himself\nthat he became a disciple. So in the case of many today whom[141]\nprejudice withholds from good. How different would be the result if\nthey would \u201ccome and see\u201d!\nWhile they trust to the guidance of human authority, none will\ncome to a saving knowledge of the truth. Like Nathanael, we need\nto study God\u2019s word for ourselves, and pray for the enlightenment\nof the Holy Spirit. He who saw Nathanael under the fig tree will see\nus in the secret place of prayer. Angels from the world of light are\nnear to those who in humility seek for divine guidance.\nWith the calling of John and Andrew and Simon, of Philip and\nNathanael, began the foundation of the Christian church. John\ndirected two of his disciples to Christ. Then one of these, Andrew,\nfound his brother, and called him to the Saviour. Philip was then\ncalled, and he went in search of Nathanael. These examples should\nteach us the importance of personal effort, of making direct appeals\nto our kindred, friends, and neighbors. There are those who for a\nlifetime have professed to be acquainted with Christ, yet who have\nnever made a personal effort to bring even one soul to the Saviour.\nThey leave all the work for the minister. He may be well qualified\nfor his calling, but he cannot do that which God has left for the\nmembers of the church.\nThere are many who need the ministration of loving Christian\nhearts. Many have gone down to ruin who might have been saved if\ntheir neighbors, common men and women, had put forth personal\neffort for them. Many are waiting to be personally addressed. In\nthe very family, the neighborhood, the town, where we live, there\nis work for us to do as missionaries for Christ. If we are Christians,\nthis work will be our delight. No sooner is one converted than there\nis born within him a desire to make known to others what a precious\n\u201cWe Have Found the Messias\u201d 111\nfriend he has found in Jesus. The saving and sanctifying truth cannot\nbe shut up in his heart.\nAll who are consecrated to God will be channels of light. God\nmakes them His agents to communicate to others the riches of His\ngrace. His promise is, \u201cI will make them and the places round about\nMy hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his\nseason; there shall be showers of blessing.\u201d Ezekiel 34:26.\nPhilip said to Nathanael, \u201cCome and see.\u201d He did not ask him to\naccept another\u2019s testimony, but to behold Christ for himself. Now\nthat Jesus has ascended to heaven, His disciples are His represen-\ntatives among men, and one of the most effective ways of winning\nsouls to Him is in exemplifying His character in our daily life. Our [142]\ninfluence upon others depends not so much upon what we say as\nupon what we are. Men may combat and defy our logic, they may\nresist our appeals; but a life of disinterested love is an argument they\ncannot gainsay. A consistent life, characterized by the meekness of\nChrist, is a power in the world.\nThe teaching of Christ was the expression of an inwrought con-\nviction and experience, and those who learn of Him become teachers\nafter the divine order. The word of God, spoken by one who is\nhimself sanctified through it, has a life-giving power that makes it\nattractive to the hearers, and convicts them that it is a living reality.\nWhen one has received the truth in the love of it, he will make this\nmanifest in the persuasion of his manner and the tones of his voice.\nHe makes known that which he himself has heard, seen, and handled\nof the word of life, that others may have fellowship with him through\nthe knowledge of Christ. His testimony, from lips touched with a\nlive coal from off the altar, is truth to the receptive heart, and works\nsanctification upon the character.\nAnd he who seeks to give light to others will himself be blessed.\n\u201cThere shall be showers of blessing.\u201d \u201cHe that watereth shall be\nwatered also himself.\u201d Proverbs 11:25. God could have reached\nHis object in saving sinners without our aid; but in order for us to\ndevelop a character like Christ\u2019s, we must share in His work. In\norder to enter into His joy,\u2014the joy of seeing souls redeemed by His\nsacrifice,\u2014we must participate in His labors for their redemption.\nNathanael\u2019s first expression of his faith, so full and earnest and\nsincere, fell like music on the ears of Jesus. And He \u201canswered\n112 The Desire of Ages\nand said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the\nfig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.\u201d\nThe Saviour looked forward with joy to His work in preaching good\ntidings to the meek, binding up the brokenhearted, and proclaiming\nliberty to the captives of Satan. At thought of the precious blessings\nHe had brought to men, Jesus added, \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you,\nHereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending\nand descending upon the Son of man.\u201d\nHere Christ virtually says, On the bank of the Jordan the heavens\nwere opened, and the Spirit descended like a dove upon Me. That\nscene was but a token that I am the Son of God. If you believe on\nMe as such, your faith shall be quickened. You shall see that the\nheavens are opened, and are never to be closed. I have opened them\nto you. The angels of God are ascending, bearing the prayers of the[143]\nneedy and distressed to the Father above, and descending, bringing\nblessing and hope, courage, help, and life, to the children of men.\nThe angels of God are ever passing from earth to heaven, and\nfrom heaven to earth. The miracles of Christ for the afflicted and\nsuffering were wrought by the power of God through the ministration\nof the angels. And it is through Christ, by the ministration of His\nheavenly messengers, that every blessing comes from God to us. In\ntaking upon Himself humanity, our Saviour unites His interests with\nthose of the fallen sons and daughters of Adam, while through His\ndivinity He grasps the throne of God. And thus Christ is the medium\nof communication of men with God, and of God with men.\nChapter 15\u2014At the Marriage Feast [144]\nThis chapter is based on John 2:1-11.\nJesus did not begin His ministry by some great work before the\nSanhedrin at Jerusalem. At a household gathering in a little Galilean\nvillage His power was put forth to add to the joy of a wedding feast.\nThus He showed His sympathy with men, and His desire to minister\nto their happiness. In the wilderness of temptation He Himself had\ndrunk the cup of woe. He came forth to give to men the cup of\nblessing, by His benediction to hallow the relations of human life.\nFrom the Jordan, Jesus had returned to Galilee. There was to be\na marriage at Cana, a little town not far from Nazareth; the parties\nwere relatives of Joseph and Mary; and Jesus, knowing of this family\ngathering, went to Cana, and with His disciples was invited to the\nfeast.\nAgain He met His mother, from whom He had for some time\nbeen separated. Mary had heard of the manifestation at the Jordan,\nat His baptism. The tidings had been carried to Nazareth, and had\nbrought to her mind afresh the scenes that for so many years had been\nhidden in her heart. In common with all Israel, Mary was deeply\nstirred by the mission of John the Baptist. Well she remembered the\nprophecy given at his birth. Now his connection with Jesus kindled\nher hopes anew. But tidings had reached her also of the mysterious [145]\ndeparture of Jesus to the wilderness, and she was oppressed with\ntroubled forebodings.\nFrom the day when she heard the angel\u2019s announcement in the\nhome at Nazareth Mary had treasured every evidence that Jesus was\nthe Messiah. His sweet, unselfish life assured her that He could be\nno other than the Sent of God. Yet there came to her also doubts and\ndisappointments, and she had longed for the time when His glory\nshould be revealed. Death had separated her from Joseph, who had\nshared her knowledge of the mystery of the birth of Jesus. Now\nthere was no one to whom she could confide her hopes and fears.\n113\n114 The Desire of Ages\nThe past two months had been very sorrowful. She had been parted\nfrom Jesus, in whose sympathy she found comfort; she pondered\nupon the words of Simeon, \u201cA sword shall pierce through thy own\nsoul also\u201d (Luke 2:35); she recalled the three days of agony when\nshe thought Jesus lost to her forever; and with an anxious heart she\nawaited His return.\nAt the marriage feast she meets Him, the same tender, dutiful\nson. Yet He is not the same. His countenance is changed. It bears\nthe traces of His conflict in the wilderness, and a new expression of\ndignity and power gives evidence of His heavenly mission. With Him\nis a group of young men, whose eyes follow Him with reverence, and\nwho call Him Master. These companions recount to Mary what they\nhave seen and heard at the baptism and elsewhere. They conclude\nby declaring, \u201cWe have found Him, of whom Moses in the law, and\nthe prophets, did write.\u201d John 1:45.\nAs the guests assemble, many seem to be preoccupied with some\ntopic of absorbing interest. A suppressed excitement pervades the\ncompany. Little groups converse together in eager but quiet tones,\nand wondering glances are turned upon the Son of Mary. As Mary\nhad heard the disciples\u2019 testimony in regard to Jesus, she had been\ngladdened with the assurance that her long-cherished hopes were\nnot in vain. Yet she would have been more than human if there had\nnot mingled with this holy joy a trace of the fond mother\u2019s natural\npride. As she saw the many glances bent upon Jesus, she longed\nto have Him prove to the company that He was really the Honored\nof God. She hoped there might be opportunity for Him to work a\nmiracle before them.\nIt was the custom of the times for marriage festivities to continue\nseveral days. On this occasion, before the feast ended it was found\nthat the supply of wine had failed. This discovery caused much\nperplexity and regret. It was unusual to dispense with wine on\nfestive occasions, and its absence would seem to indicate a want[146]\nof hospitality. As a relative of the parties, Mary had assisted in\nthe arrangements for the feast, and she now spoke to Jesus, saying,\n\u201cThey have no wine.\u201d These words were a suggestion that He might\nsupply their need. But Jesus answered, \u201cWoman, what have I to do\nwith thee? Mine hour is not yet come.\u201d\nAt the Marriage Feast 115\nThis answer, abrupt as it seems to us, expressed no coldness or\ndiscourtesy. The Saviour\u2019s form of address to His mother was in\naccordance with Oriental custom. It was used toward persons to\nwhom it was desired to show respect. Every act of Christ\u2019s earthly\nlife was in harmony with the precept He Himself had given, \u201cHonor\nthy father and thy mother.\u201d Exodus 20:12. On the cross, in His last\nact of tenderness toward His mother, Jesus again addressed her in\nthe same way, as He committed her to the care of His best-loved\ndisciple. Both at the marriage feast and upon the cross, the love\nexpressed in tone and look and manner interpreted His words.\nAt His visit to the temple in His boyhood, as the mystery of His\nlifework opened before Him, Christ had said to Mary, \u201cWist ye not\nthat I must be about My Father\u2019s business?\u201d Luke 2:49. These words\nstruck the keynote of His whole life and ministry. Everything was [147]\nheld in abeyance to His work, the great work of redemption which\nHe had come into the world to accomplish. Now He repeated the\nlesson. There was danger that Mary would regard her relationship to\nJesus as giving her a special claim upon Him, and the right, in some\ndegree, to direct Him in His mission. For thirty years He had been\nto her a loving and obedient son, and His love was unchanged; but\nHe must now go about His Father\u2019s work. As Son of the Most High,\nand Saviour of the world, no earthly ties must hold Him from His\nmission, or influence His conduct. He must stand free to do the will\nof God. This lesson is also for us. The claims of God are paramount\neven to the ties of human relationship. No earthly attraction should\nturn our feet from the path in which He bids us walk.\nThe only hope of redemption for our fallen race is in Christ;\nMary could find salvation only through the Lamb of God. In herself\nshe possessed no merit. Her connection with Jesus placed her in\nno different spiritual relation to Him from that of any other human\nsoul. This is indicated in the Saviour\u2019s words. He makes clear the\ndistinction between His relation to her as the Son of man and as the\nSon of God. The tie of kinship between them in no way placed her\non an equality with Him.\nThe words, \u201cMine hour is not yet come,\u201d point to the fact that\nevery act of Christ\u2019s life on earth was in fulfillment of the plan that\nhad existed from the days of eternity. Before He came to earth,\nthe plan lay out before Him, perfect in all its details. But as He\n116 The Desire of Ages\nwalked among men, He was guided, step by step, by the Father\u2019s\nwill. He did not hesitate to act at the appointed time. With the same\nsubmission He waited until the time had come.\nIn saying to Mary that His hour had not yet come, Jesus was\nreplying to her unspoken thought,\u2014to the expectation she cherished\nin common with her people. She hoped that He would reveal Himself\nas the Messiah, and take the throne of Israel. But the time had not\ncome. Not as a King, but as \u201ca Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with\ngrief,\u201d had Jesus accepted the lot of humanity.\nBut though Mary had not a right conception of Christ\u2019s mission,\nshe trusted Him implicitly. To this faith Jesus responded. It was to\nhonor Mary\u2019s trust, and to strengthen the faith of His disciples, that\nthe first miracle was performed. The disciples were to encounter\nmany and great temptations to unbelief. To them the prophecies had\nmade it clear beyond all controversy that Jesus was the Messiah.[148]\nThey looked for the religious leaders to receive Him with confidence\neven greater than their own. They declared among the people the\nwonderful works of Christ and their own confidence in His mission,\nbut they were amazed and bitterly disappointed by the unbelief, the\ndeep-seated prejudice, and the enmity to Jesus, displayed by the\npriests and rabbis. The Saviour\u2019s early miracles strengthened the\ndisciples to stand against this opposition.\nIn nowise disconcerted by the words of Jesus, Mary said to those\nserving at table, \u201cWhatsoever He saith unto you, do it.\u201d Thus she\ndid what she could to prepare the way for the work of Christ.\nBeside the doorway stood six large stone water jars, and Jesus\nbade the servants fill these with water. It was done. Then as the wine\nwas wanted for immediate use, He said, \u201cDraw out now, and bear\nunto the governor of the feast.\u201d Instead of the water with which the\nvessels had been filled, there flowed forth wine. Neither the ruler\nof the feast nor the guests generally were aware that the supply of\nwine had failed. Upon tasting that which the servants brought, the\nruler found it superior to any he had ever before drunk, and very\ndifferent from that served at the beginning of the feast. Turning to\nthe bridegroom, he said, \u201cEvery man at the beginning doth set forth\ngood wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse:\nbut thou hast kept the good wine until now.\u201d\nAt the Marriage Feast 117\nAs men set forth the best wine first, then afterward that which\nis worse, so does the world with its gifts. That which it offers\nmay please the eye and fascinate the senses, but it proves to be\nunsatisfying. The wine turns to bitterness, the gaiety to gloom.\nThat which was begun with songs and mirth ends in weariness and\ndisgust. But the gifts of Jesus are ever fresh and new. The feast\nthat He provides for the soul never fails to give satisfaction and joy.\nEach new gift increases the capacity of the receiver to appreciate and\nenjoy the blessings of the Lord. He gives grace for grace. There can\nbe no failure of supply. If you abide in Him, the fact that you receive\na rich gift today insures the reception of a richer gift tomorrow.\nThe words of Jesus to Nathanael express the law of God\u2019s dealing\nwith the children of faith. With every fresh revelation of His love,\nHe declares to the receptive heart, \u201cBelievest thou? thou shalt see\ngreater things than these.\u201d John 1:50.\nThe gift of Christ to the marriage feast was a symbol. The water\nrepresented baptism into His death; the wine, the shedding of His\nblood for the sins of the world. The water to fill the jars was brought [149]\nby human hands, but the word of Christ alone could impart to it\nlife-giving virtue. So with the rites which point to the Saviour\u2019s\ndeath. It is only by the power of Christ, working through faith, that\nthey have efficacy to nourish the soul.\nThe word of Christ supplied ample provision for the feast. So\nabundant is the provision of His grace to blot out the iniquities of\nmen, and to renew and sustain the soul.\nAt the first feast He attended with His disciples, Jesus gave them\nthe cup that symbolized His work for their salvation. At the last\nsupper He gave it again, in the institution of that sacred rite by\nwhich His death was to be shown forth \u201ctill He come.\u201d 1 Corinthians\n11:26. And the sorrow of the disciples at parting from their Lord\nwas comforted with the promise of reunion, as He said, \u201cI will not\ndrink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink\nit new with you in My Father\u2019s kingdom.\u201d Matthew 26:29.\nThe wine which Christ provided for the feast, and that which He\ngave to the disciples as a symbol of His own blood, was the pure\njuice of the grape. To this the prophet Isaiah refers when he speaks\nof the new wine \u201cin the cluster,\u201d and says, \u201cDestroy it not; for a\nblessing is in it.\u201d Isaiah 65:8.\n118 The Desire of Ages\nIt was Christ who in the Old Testament gave the warning to\nIsrael, \u201cWine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever\nis deceived thereby is not wise.\u201d Proverbs 20:1. And He Himself\nprovided no such beverage. Satan tempts men to indulgence that\nwill becloud reason and benumb the spiritual perceptions, but Christ\nteaches us to bring the lower nature into subjection. His whole\nlife was an example of self-denial. In order to break the power of\nappetite, He suffered in our behalf the severest test that humanity\ncould endure. It was Christ who directed that John the Baptist should\ndrink neither wine nor strong drink. It was He who enjoined similar\nabstinence upon the wife of Manoah. And He pronounced a curse\nupon the man who should put the bottle to his neighbor\u2019s lips. Christ\ndid not contradict His own teaching. The unfermented wine which\nHe provided for the wedding guests was a wholesome and refreshing\ndrink. Its effect was to bring the taste into harmony with a healthful\nappetite.\nAs the guests at the feast remarked upon the quality of the wine,\ninquiries were made that drew from the servants an account of the\nmiracle. The company were for a time too much amazed to think of[150]\nHim who had performed the wonderful work. When at length they\nlooked for Him, it was found that He had withdrawn so quietly as to\nbe unnoticed even by His disciples.\nThe attention of the company was now turned to the disciples.\nFor the first time they had the opportunity of acknowledging their\nfaith in Jesus. They told what they had seen and heard at the Jordan,\nand there was kindled in many hearts the hope that God had raised up\na deliverer for His people. The news of the miracle spread through\nall that region, and was carried to Jerusalem. With new interest\nthe priests and elders searched the prophecies pointing to Christ\u2019s\ncoming. There was eager desire to learn the mission of this new\nteacher, who appeared among the people in so unassuming a manner.\nThe ministry of Christ was in marked contrast to that of the\nJewish elders. Their regard for tradition and formalism had destroyed\nall real freedom of thought or action. They lived in continual dread of\ndefilement. To avoid contact with the \u201cunclean,\u201d they kept aloof, not\nonly from the Gentiles, but from the majority of their own people,\nseeking neither to benefit them nor to win their friendship. By\ndwelling constantly on these matters, they had dwarfed their minds\nAt the Marriage Feast 119\nand narrowed the orbit of their lives. Their example encouraged\negotism and intolerance among all classes of the people.\nJesus began the work of reformation by coming into close sym-\npathy with humanity. While He showed the greatest reverence for the\nlaw of God, He rebuked the pretentious piety of the Pharisees, and\ntried to free the people from the senseless rules that bound them. He\nwas seeking to break down the barriers which separated the different\nclasses of society, that He might bring men together as children of\none family. His attendance at the marriage feast was designed to be\na step toward effecting this.\nGod had directed John the Baptist to dwell in the wilderness, that\nhe might be shielded from the influence of the priests and rabbis,\nand be prepared for a special mission. But the austerity and isolation\nof his life were not an example for the people. John himself had not\ndirected his hearers to forsake their former duties. He bade them\ngive evidence of their repentance by faithfulness to God in the place\nwhere He had called them.\nJesus reproved self-indulgence in all its forms, yet He was social\nin His nature. He accepted the hospitality of all classes, visiting the\nhomes of the rich and the poor, the learned and the ignorant, and [151]\nseeking to elevate their thoughts from questions of commonplace\nlife to those things that are spiritual and eternal. He gave no license\nto dissipation, and no shadow of worldly levity marred His conduct;\nyet He found pleasure in scenes of innocent happiness, and by His\npresence sanctioned the social gathering. A Jewish marriage was\nan impressive occasion, and its joy was not displeasing to the Son\nof man. By attending this feast, Jesus honored marriage as a divine\ninstitution.\nIn both the Old and the New Testament, the marriage relation\nis employed to represent the tender and sacred union that exists\nbetween Christ and His people. To the mind of Jesus the gladness of\nthe wedding festivities pointed forward to the rejoicing of that day\nwhen He shall bring home His bride to the Father\u2019s house, and the\nredeemed with the Redeemer shall sit down to the marriage supper\nof the Lamb. He says, \u201cAs the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride,\nso shall thy God rejoice over thee.\u201d \u201cThou shalt no more be termed\nForsaken; ... but thou shalt be called My Delight; ... for the Lord\ndelighteth in thee.\u201d \u201cHe will rejoice over thee with joy; He will\n120 The Desire of Ages\nrest in His love, He will joy over thee with singing.\u201d Isaiah 62:5, 4,\nmargin; Zephaniah 3:17. When the vision of heavenly things was\ngranted to John the apostle, he wrote: \u201cI heard as it were the voice\nof a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the\nvoice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God\nomnipotent reigneth. Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to\nHim: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made\nherself ready.\u201d \u201cBlessed are they which are called unto the marriage\nsupper of the Lamb.\u201d Revelation 19:6, 7, 9.\nJesus saw in every soul one to whom must be given the call to\nHis kingdom. He reached the hearts of the people by going among\nthem as one who desired their good. He sought them in the public\nstreets, in private houses, on the boats, in the synagogue, by the\nshores of the lake, and at the marriage feast. He met them at their\ndaily vocations, and manifested an interest in their secular affairs.\nHe carried His instruction into the household, bringing families in\ntheir own homes under the influence of His divine presence. His\nstrong personal sympathy helped to win hearts. He often repaired to\nthe mountains for solitary prayer, but this was a preparation for His\nlabor among men in active life. From these seasons He came forth\nto relieve the sick, to instruct the ignorant, and to break the chains\nfrom the captives of Satan.\nIt was by personal contact and association that Jesus trained His[152]\ndisciples. Sometimes He taught them, sitting among them on the\nmountainside; sometimes beside the sea, or walking with them by\nthe way, He revealed the mysteries of the kingdom of God. He\ndid not sermonize as men do today. Wherever hearts were open to\nreceive the divine message, He unfolded the truths of the way of\nsalvation. He did not command His disciples to do this or that, but\nsaid, \u201cFollow Me.\u201d On His journeys through country and cities He\ntook them with Him, that they might see how He taught the people.\nHe linked their interest with His, and they united with Him in the\nwork.\nThe example of Christ in linking Himself with the interests of\nhumanity should be followed by all who preach His word, and by all\nwho have received the gospel of His grace. We are not to renounce\nsocial communion. We should not seclude ourselves from others. In\norder to reach all classes, we must meet them where they are. They\nAt the Marriage Feast 121\nwill seldom seek us of their own accord. Not alone from the pulpit\nare the hearts of men touched by divine truth. There is another field\nof labor, humbler, it may be, but fully as promising. It is found in the\nhome of the lowly, and in the mansion of the great; at the hospitable\nboard, and in gatherings for innocent social enjoyment.\nAs disciples of Christ we shall not mingle with the world from a\nmere love of pleasure, to unite with them in folly. Such associations\ncan result only in harm. We should never give sanction to sin by\nour words or our deeds, our silence or our presence. Wherever\nwe go, we are to carry Jesus with us, and to reveal to others the\npreciousness of our Saviour. But those who try to preserve their\nreligion by hiding it within stone walls lose precious opportunities\nof doing good. Through the social relations, Christianity comes\nin contact with the world. Everyone who has received the divine\nillumination is to brighten the pathway of those who know not the\nLight of life.\nWe should all become witnesses for Jesus. Social power, sancti-\nfied by the grace of Christ, must be improved in winning souls to\nthe Saviour. Let the world see that we are not selfishly absorbed in\nour own interests, but that we desire others to share our blessings\nand privileges. Let them see that our religion does not make us\nunsympathetic or exacting. Let all who profess to have found Christ,\nminister as He did for the benefit of men.\nWe should never give to the world the false impression that\nChristians are a gloomy, unhappy people. If our eyes are fixed on\nJesus, we shall see a compassionate Redeemer, and shall catch light [153]\nfrom His countenance. Wherever His Spirit reigns, there peace\nabides. And there will be joy also, for there is a calm, holy trust in\nGod.\nChrist is pleased with His followers when they show that, though\nhuman, they are partakers of the divine nature. They are not statues,\nbut living men and women. Their hearts, refreshed by the dews of\ndivine grace, open and expand to the Sun of Righteousness. The\nlight that shines upon them they reflect upon others in works that\nare luminous with the love of Christ.\nChapter 16\u2014In His Temple[154]\nThis chapter is based on John 2:12-22.\n\u201cAfter this He went down to Capernaum, He, and His mother,\nand His brethren, and His disciples: and they continued there not\nmany days. And the Jews\u2019 Passover was at hand, and Jesus went up\nto Jerusalem.\u201d\nIn this journey, Jesus joined one of the large companies that\nwere making their way to the capital. He had not yet publicly\nannounced His mission, and He mingled unnoticed with the throng.\nUpon these occasions, the coming of the Messiah, to which such\nprominence had been given by the ministry of John, was often the\ntheme of conversation. The hope of national greatness was dwelt\nupon with kindling enthusiasm. Jesus knew that this hope was to\nbe disappointed, for it was founded on a misinterpretation of the\nScriptures. With deep earnestness He explained the prophecies, and\ntried to arouse the people to a closer study of God\u2019s word.\nThe Jewish leaders had instructed the people that at Jerusalem\nthey were to be taught to worship God. Here during the Passover\nweek large numbers assembled, coming from all parts of Palestine,\nand even from distant lands. The temple courts were filled with a\npromiscuous throng. Many were unable to bring with them the sac-\nrifices that were to be offered up as typifying the one great Sacrifice.[155]\nFor the convenience of these, animals were bought and sold in the\nouter court of the temple. Here all classes of people assembled to\npurchase their offerings. Here all foreign money was exchanged for\nthe coin of the sanctuary.\nEvery Jew was required to pay yearly a half shekel as \u201ca ransom\nfor his soul;\u201d and the money thus collected was used for the support\nof the temple. Exodus 30:12-16. Besides this, large sums were\nbrought as freewill offerings, to be deposited in the temple treasury.\nAnd it was required that all foreign coin should be changed for a\ncoin called the temple shekel, which was accepted for the service of\n122\nIn His Temple 123\nthe sanctuary. The money changing gave opportunity for fraud and\nextortion, and it had grown into a disgraceful traffic, which was a\nsource of revenue to the priests.\nThe dealers demanded exorbitant prices for the animals sold,\nand they shared their profits with the priests and rulers, who thus\nenriched themselves at the expense of the people. The worshipers\nhad been taught to believe that if they did not offer sacrifice, the\nblessing of God would not rest on their children or their lands. Thus\na high price for the animals could be secured; for after coming so\nfar, the people would not return to their homes without performing\nthe act of devotion for which they had come.\nA great number of sacrifices were offered at the time of the\nPassover, and the sales at the temple were very large. The consequent\nconfusion indicated a noisy cattle market rather than the sacred\ntemple of God. There could be heard sharp bargaining, the lowing of\ncattle, the bleating of sheep, the cooing of doves, mingled with the\nchinking of coin and angry disputation. So great was the confusion\nthat the worshipers were disturbed, and the words addressed to the\nMost High were drowned in the uproar that invaded the temple. The\nJews were exceedingly proud of their piety. They rejoiced over their\ntemple, and regarded a word spoken in its disfavor as blasphemy;\nthey were very rigorous in the performance of ceremonies connected\nwith it; but the love of money had overruled their scruples. They\nwere scarcely aware how far they had wandered from the original\npurpose of the service instituted by God Himself.\nWhen the Lord descended upon Mount Sinai, the place was\nconsecrated by His presence. Moses was commanded to put bounds\naround the mount and sanctify it, and the word of the Lord was\nheard in warning: \u201cTake heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into [156]\nthe mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount\nshall be surely put to death: there shall not an hand touch it, but\nhe shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or\nman, it shall not live.\u201d Exodus 19:12, 13. Thus was taught the lesson\nthat wherever God manifests His presence, the place is holy. The\nprecincts of God\u2019s temple should have been regarded as sacred. But\nin the strife for gain, all this was lost sight of.\nThe priests and rulers were called to be the representatives of\nGod to the nation; they should have corrected the abuses of the\n124 The Desire of Ages\ntemple court. They should have given to the people an example of[157]\nintegrity and compassion. Instead of studying their own profit, they\nshould have considered the situation and needs of the worshipers,\nand should have been ready to assist those who were not able to\nbuy the required sacrifices. But this they did not do. Avarice had\nhardened their hearts.\nThere came to this feast those who were suffering, those who\nwere in want and distress. The blind, the lame, the deaf, were there.\nSome were brought on beds. Many came who were too poor to\npurchase the humblest offering for the Lord, too poor even to buy\nfood with which to satisfy their own hunger. These were greatly\ndistressed by the statements of the priests. The priests boasted of\ntheir piety; they claimed to be the guardians of the people; but they\nwere without sympathy or compassion. The poor, the sick, the dying,\nmade their vain plea for favor. Their suffering awakened no pity in\nthe hearts of the priests.\nAs Jesus came into the temple, He took in the whole scene. He\nsaw the unfair transactions. He saw the distress of the poor, who\nthought that without shedding of blood there would be no forgiveness\nfor their sins. He saw the outer court of His temple converted into a\nplace of unholy traffic. The sacred enclosure had become one vast\nexchange.\nChrist saw that something must be done. Numerous ceremonies\nwere enjoined upon the people without the proper instruction as to\ntheir import. The worshipers offered their sacrifices without under-\nstanding that they were typical of the only perfect Sacrifice. And\namong them, unrecognized and unhonored, stood the One symbol-\nized by all their service. He had given directions in regard to the\nofferings. He understood their symbolical value, and He saw that\nthey were now perverted and misunderstood. Spiritual worship was\nfast disappearing. No link bound the priests and rulers to their God.\nChrist\u2019s work was to establish an altogether different worship.\nWith searching glance, Christ takes in the scene before Him as\nHe stands upon the steps of the temple court. With prophetic eye He\nlooks into futurity, and sees not only years, but centuries and ages.\nHe sees how priests and rulers will turn the needy from their right,\nand forbid that the gospel shall be preached to the poor. He sees how\nthe love of God will be concealed from sinners, and men will make\nIn His Temple 125\nmerchandise of His grace. As He beholds the scene, indignation,\nauthority, and power are expressed in His countenance. The attention\nof the people is attracted to Him. The eyes of those engaged in their\nunholy traffic are riveted upon His face. They cannot withdraw [158]\ntheir gaze. They feel that this Man reads their inmost thoughts, and\ndiscovers their hidden motives. Some attempt to conceal their faces,\nas if their evil deeds were written upon their countenances, to be\nscanned by those searching eyes.\nThe confusion is hushed. The sound of traffic and bargaining has\nceased. The silence becomes painful. A sense of awe overpowers the\nassembly. It is as if they were arraigned before the tribunal of God\nto answer for their deeds. Looking upon Christ, they behold divinity\nflash through the garb of humanity. The Majesty of heaven stands\nas the Judge will stand at the last day,\u2014not now encircled with the\nglory that will then attend Him, but with the same power to read the\nsoul. His eye sweeps over the multitude, taking in every individual.\nHis form seems to rise above them in commanding dignity, and a\ndivine light illuminates His countenance. He speaks, and His clear,\nringing voice\u2014the same that upon Mount Sinai proclaimed the law\nthat priests and rulers are transgressing\u2014is heard echoing through\nthe arches of the temple: \u201cTake these things hence; make not My\nFather\u2019s house an house of merchandise.\u201d\nSlowly descending the steps, and raising the scourge of cords\ngathered up on entering the enclosure, He bids the bargaining com-\npany depart from the precincts of the temple. With a zeal and severity\nHe has never before manifested, He overthrows the tables of the\nmoney-changers. The coin falls, ringing sharply upon the marble\npavement. None presume to question His authority. None dare stop\nto gather up their ill-gotten gain. Jesus does not smite them with the\nwhip of cords, but in His hand that simple scourge seems terrible as\na flaming sword. Officers of the temple, speculating priests, brokers\nand cattle traders, with their sheep and oxen, rush from the place,\nwith the one thought of escaping from the condemnation of His\npresence.\nA panic sweeps over the multitude, who feel the overshadowing\nof His divinity. Cries of terror escape from hundreds of blanched\nlips. Even the disciples tremble. They are awestruck by the words\nand manner of Jesus, so unlike His usual demeanor. They remember\n126 The Desire of Ages\nthat it is written of Him, \u201cThe zeal of Thine house hath eaten Me up.\u201d\nPsalm 69:9. Soon the tumultuous throng with their merchandise are\nfar removed from the temple of the Lord. The courts are free from\nunholy traffic, and a deep silence and solemnity settles upon the\nscene of confusion. The presence of the Lord, that of old sanctified[159]\n[160]\n[161]\nthe mount, has now made sacred the temple reared in His honor.\nIn the cleansing of the temple, Jesus was announcing His mission\nas the Messiah, and entering upon His work. That temple, erected\nfor the abode of the divine Presence, was designed to be an object\nlesson for Israel and for the world. From eternal ages it was God\u2019s\npurpose that every created being, from the bright and holy seraph to\nman, should be a temple for the indwelling of the Creator. Because\nof sin, humanity ceased to be a temple for God. Darkened and\ndefiled by evil, the heart of man no longer revealed the glory of the\nDivine One. But by the incarnation of the Son of God, the purpose\nof Heaven is fulfilled. God dwells in humanity, and through saving\ngrace the heart of man becomes again His temple. God designed\nthat the temple at Jerusalem should be a continual witness to the\nhigh destiny open to every soul. But the Jews had not understood the\nsignificance of the building they regarded with so much pride. They\ndid not yield themselves as holy temples for the Divine Spirit. The\ncourts of the temple at Jerusalem, filled with the tumult of unholy\ntraffic, represented all too truly the temple of the heart, defiled by\nthe presence of sensual passion and unholy thoughts. In cleansing\nthe temple from the world\u2019s buyers and sellers, Jesus announced\nHis mission to cleanse the heart from the defilement of sin,\u2014from\nthe earthly desires, the selfish lusts, the evil habits, that corrupt the\nsoul. \u201cThe Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to His temple,\neven the Messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold,\nHe shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. But who may abide the day\nof His coming? and who shall stand when He appeareth? for He\nis like a refiner\u2019s fire, and like fullers\u2019 soap: and He shall sit as a\nrefiner and purifier of silver: and He shall purify the sons of Levi,\nand purge them as gold and silver.\u201d Malachi 3:1-3.\n\u201cKnow ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of\nGod dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall\nGod destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 3:16, 17. No man can of himself cast out the evil throng\nIn His Temple 127\nthat have taken possession of the heart. Only Christ can cleanse the\nsoul temple. But He will not force an entrance. He comes not into\nthe heart as to the temple of old; but He says, \u201cBehold, I stand at\nthe door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door,\nI will come in to him.\u201d Revelation 3:20. He will come, not for one\nday merely; for He says, \u201cI will dwell in them, and walk in them; ...\nand they shall be My people.\u201d \u201cHe will subdue our iniquities; and [162]\nThou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.\u201d 2 Corinthians\n6:16; Micah 7:19. His presence will cleanse and sanctify the soul,\nso that it may be a holy temple unto the Lord, and \u201can habitation of\nGod through the Spirit.\u201d Ephesians 2:21, 22.\nOverpowered with terror, the priests and rulers had fled from the\ntemple court, and from the searching glance that read their hearts.\nIn their flight they met others on their way to the temple, and bade\nthem turn back, telling them what they had seen and heard. Christ\nlooked upon the fleeing men with yearning pity for their fear, and\ntheir ignorance of what constituted true worship. In this scene He\nsaw symbolized the dispersion of the whole Jewish nation for their\nwickedness and impenitence.\nAnd why did the priests flee from the temple? Why did they\nnot stand their ground? He who commanded them to go was a\ncarpenter\u2019s son, a poor Galilean, without earthly rank or power. Why\ndid they not resist Him? Why did they leave the gain so ill acquired,\nand flee at the command of One whose outward appearance was so\nhumble?\nChrist spoke with the authority of a king, and in His appearance,\nand in the tones of His voice, there was that which they had no power\nto resist. At the word of command they realized, as they had never\nrealized before, their true position as hypocrites and robbers. When\ndivinity flashed through humanity, not only did they see indignation\non Christ\u2019s countenance; they realized the import of His words.\nThey felt as if before the throne of the eternal Judge, with their\nsentence passed on them for time and for eternity. For a time they\nwere convinced that Christ was a prophet; and many believed Him\nto be the Messiah. The Holy Spirit flashed into their minds the\nutterances of the prophets concerning Christ. Would they yield to\nthis conviction?\n128 The Desire of Ages\nRepent they would not. They knew that Christ\u2019s sympathy for\nthe poor had been aroused. They knew that they had been guilty of\nextortion in their dealings with the people. Because Christ discerned\ntheir thoughts they hated Him. His public rebuke was humiliating\nto their pride, and they were jealous of His growing influence with\nthe people. They determined to challenge Him as to the power by\nwhich He had driven them forth, and who gave Him this power.\nSlowly and thoughtfully, but with hate in their hearts, they re-\nturned to the temple. But what a change had taken place during their\nabsence! When they fled, the poor remained behind; and these were[163]\nnow looking to Jesus, whose countenance expressed His love and\nsympathy. With tears in His eyes, He said to the trembling ones\naround Him: Fear not; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.\nFor this cause came I into the world.\nThe people pressed into Christ\u2019s presence with urgent, pitiful\nappeals: Master, bless me. His ear heard every cry. With pity\nexceeding that of a tender mother He bent over the suffering little\nones. All received attention. Everyone was healed of whatever\ndisease he had. The dumb opened their lips in praise; the blind\nbeheld the face of their Restorer. The hearts of the sufferers were\nmade glad.\nAs the priests and temple officials witnessed this great work,\nwhat a revelation to them were the sounds that fell on their ears!\nThe people were relating the story of the pain they had suffered, of\ntheir disappointed hopes, of painful days and sleepless nights. When\nthe last spark of hope seemed to be dead, Christ had healed them.\nThe burden was so heavy, one said; but I have found a helper. He is\nthe Christ of God, and I will devote my life to His service. Parents\nsaid to their children, He has saved your life; lift up your voice and\npraise Him. The voices of children and youth, fathers and mothers,\nfriends and spectators, blended in thanksgiving and praise. Hope\nand gladness filled their hearts. Peace came to their minds. They\nwere restored soul and body, and they returned home, proclaiming\neverywhere the matchless love of Jesus.\nAt the crucifixion of Christ, those who had thus been healed\ndid not join with the rabble throng in crying, \u201cCrucify Him, crucify\nHim.\u201d Their sympathies were with Jesus; for they had felt His great\nsympathy and wonderful power. They knew Him to be their Saviour;\nIn His Temple 129\nfor He had given them health of body and soul. They listened to\nthe preaching of the apostles, and the entrance of God\u2019s word into\ntheir hearts gave them understanding. They became agents of God\u2019s\nmercy, and instruments of His salvation.\nThe crowd that had fled from the temple court after a time slowly\ndrifted back. They had partially recovered from the panic that had\nseized them, but their faces expressed irresolution and timidity. They\nlooked with amazement on the works of Jesus, and were convicted\nthat in Him the prophecies concerning the Messiah were fulfilled.\nThe sin of the desecration of the temple rested, in a great degree,\nupon the priests. It was by their arrangement that the court had [164]\nbeen turned into a market place. The people were comparatively\ninnocent. They were impressed by the divine authority of Jesus;\nbut with them the influence of the priests and rulers was paramount.\nThey regarded Christ\u2019s mission as an innovation, and questioned His\nright to interfere with what was permitted by the authorities of the\ntemple. They were offended because the traffic had been interrupted,\nand they stifled the convictions of the Holy Spirit.\nAbove all others the priests and rulers should have seen in Jesus\nthe anointed of the Lord; for in their hands were the sacred scrolls\nthat described His mission, and they knew that the cleansing of the\ntemple was a manifestation of more than human power. Much as\nthey hated Jesus, they could not free themselves from the thought\nthat He might be a prophet sent by God to restore the sanctity of\nthe temple. With a deference born of this fear, they went to Him\nwith the inquiry, \u201cWhat sign showest Thou unto us, seeing that Thou\ndoest these things?\u201d\nJesus had shown them a sign. In flashing light into their hearts,\nand in doing before them the works which the Messiah was to do,\nHe had given convincing evidence of His character. Now when\nthey asked for a sign, He answered them by a parable, showing that\nHe read their malice, and saw to what lengths it would lead them.\n\u201cDestroy this temple,\u201d He said, \u201cand in three days I will raise it up.\u201d\nIn these words His meaning was twofold. He referred not only\nto the destruction of the Jewish temple and worship, but to His\nown death,\u2014the destruction of the temple of His body. This the\nJews were already plotting. As the priests and rulers returned to the\ntemple, they had proposed to kill Jesus, and thus rid themselves of\n130 The Desire of Ages\nthe troubler. Yet when He set before them their purpose, they did\nnot understand Him. They took His words as applying only to the\ntemple at Jerusalem, and with indignation exclaimed, \u201cForty and six\nyears was this temple in building, and wilt Thou rear it up in three\ndays?\u201d Now they felt that Jesus had justified their unbelief, and they\nwere confirmed in their rejection of Him.\nChrist did not design that His words should be understood by\nthe unbelieving Jews, nor even by His disciples at this time. He\nknew that they would be misconstrued by His enemies, and would\nbe turned against Him. At His trial they would be brought as an\naccusation, and on Calvary they would be flung at Him as a taunt.\nBut to explain them now would give His disciples a knowledge of\nHis sufferings, and bring upon them sorrow which as yet they were[165]\nnot able to bear. And an explanation would prematurely disclose\nto the Jews the result of their prejudice and unbelief. Already they\nhad entered upon a path which they would steadily pursue until He\nshould be led as a lamb to the slaughter.\nIt was for the sake of those who should believe on Him that\nthese words of Christ were spoken. He knew that they would be\nrepeated. Being spoken at the Passover, they would come to the ears\nof thousands, and be carried to all parts of the world. After He had\nrisen from the dead, their meaning would be made plain. To many\nthey would be conclusive evidence of His divinity.\nBecause of their spiritual darkness, even the disciples of Jesus of-\nten failed of comprehending His lessons. But many of these lessons\nwere made plain to them by subsequent events. When He walked no\nmore with them, His words were a stay to their hearts.\nAs referring to the temple at Jerusalem, the Saviour\u2019s words,\n\u201cDestroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up,\u201d had a deeper\nmeaning than the hearers perceived. Christ was the foundation and\nlife of the temple. Its services were typical of the sacrifice of the Son\nof God. The priesthood was established to represent the mediatorial\ncharacter and work of Christ. The entire plan of sacrificial worship\nwas a foreshadowing of the Saviour\u2019s death to redeem the world.\nThere would be no efficacy in these offerings when the great event\ntoward which they had pointed for ages was consummated.\nSince the whole ritual economy was symbolical of Christ, it had\nno value apart from Him. When the Jews sealed their rejection of\nIn His Temple 131\nChrist by delivering Him to death, they rejected all that gave signif-\nicance to the temple and its services. Its sacredness had departed.\nIt was doomed to destruction. From that day sacrificial offerings\nand the service connected with them were meaningless. Like the\noffering of Cain, they did not express faith in the Saviour. In putting\nChrist to death, the Jews virtually destroyed their temple. When\nChrist was crucified, the inner veil of the temple was rent in twain\nfrom top to bottom, signifying that the great final sacrifice had been\nmade, and that the system of sacrificial offerings was forever at an\nend.\n\u201cIn three days I will raise it up.\u201d In the Saviour\u2019s death the\npowers of darkness seemed to prevail, and they exulted in their\nvictory. But from the rent sepulcher of Joseph, Jesus came forth a\nconqueror. \u201cHaving spoiled principalities and powers, He made a\nshow of them openly, triumphing over them.\u201d Colossians 2:15. By\nvirtue of His death and resurrection He became the minister of the [166]\n\u201ctrue tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.\u201d Hebrews\n8:2. Men reared the Jewish tabernacle; men builded the Jewish\ntemple; but the sanctuary above, of which the earthly was a type,\nwas built by no human architect. \u201cBehold the Man whose name is\nThe Branch; ... He shall build the temple of the Lord; and He shall\nbear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon His throne; and He shall\nbe a priest upon His throne.\u201d Zechariah 6:12, 13.\nThe sacrificial service that had pointed to Christ passed away;\nbut the eyes of men were turned to the true sacrifice for the sins of\nthe world. The earthly priesthood ceased; but we look to Jesus, the\nminister of the new covenant, and \u201cto the blood of sprinkling, that\nspeaketh better things than that of Abel.\u201d \u201cThe way into the holiest\nof all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was\nyet standing: ... but Christ being come an high priest of good things\nto come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with\nhands, ... by His own blood He entered in once into the holy place,\nhaving obtained eternal redemption for us.\u201d Hebrews 12:24; 9:8-12.\n\u201cWherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost that\ncome unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession\nfor them.\u201d Hebrews 7:25. Though the ministration was to be removed\nfrom the earthly to the heavenly temple; though the sanctuary and\nour great high priest would be invisible to human sight, yet the\n132 The Desire of Ages\ndisciples were to suffer no loss thereby. They would realize no break\nin their communion, and no diminution of power because of the\nSaviour\u2019s absence. While Jesus ministers in the sanctuary above,\nHe is still by His Spirit the minister of the church on earth. He is\nwithdrawn from the eye of sense, but His parting promise is fulfilled,\n\u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d Matthew\n28:20. While He delegates His power to inferior ministers, His\nenergizing presence is still with His church.\n\u201cSeeing then that we have a great high priest, ... Jesus, the Son\nof God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an high\npriest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities;\nbut was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us\ntherefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain\nmercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\u201d Hebrews 4:14-16.\nChapter 17\u2014Nicodemus [167]\nThis chapter is based on John 3:1-17.\nNicodemus held a high position of trust in the Jewish nation. He\nwas highly educated, and possessed talents of no ordinary charac-\nter, and he was an honored member of the national council. With\nothers, he had been stirred by the teaching of Jesus. Though rich,\nlearned, and honored, he had been strangely attracted by the hum-\nble Nazarene. The lessons that had fallen from the Saviour\u2019s lips\nhad greatly impressed him, and he desired to learn more of these\nwonderful truths.\nChrist\u2019s exercise of authority in the cleansing of the temple had\nroused the determined hatred of the priests and rulers. They feared\nthe power of this stranger. Such boldness on the part of an obscure\nGalilean was not to be tolerated. They were bent on putting an end\nto His work. But not all were agreed in this purpose. There were\nsome that feared to oppose One who was so evidently moved upon\nby the Spirit of God. They remembered how prophets had been\nslain for rebuking the sins of the leaders in Israel. They knew that\nthe bondage of the Jews to a heathen nation was the result of their\nstubbornness in rejecting reproofs from God. They feared that in\nplotting against Jesus the priests and rulers were following in the\nsteps of their fathers, and would bring fresh calamities upon the\nnation. Nicodemus shared these feelings. In a council of the San- [168]\nhedrin, when the course to be pursued toward Jesus was considered,\nNicodemus advised caution and moderation. He urged that if Jesus\nwas really invested with authority from God, it would be perilous\nto reject His warnings. The priests dared not disregard this counsel,\nand for the time they took no open measures against the Saviour.\nSince hearing Jesus, Nicodemus had anxiously studied the\nprophecies relating to the Messiah; and the more he searched, the\nstronger was his conviction that this was the One who was to come.\nWith many others in Israel he had been greatly distressed by the\n133\n134 The Desire of Ages\nprofanation of the temple. He was a witness of the scene when\nJesus drove out the buyers and the sellers; he beheld the wonderful\nmanifestation of divine power; he saw the Saviour receiving the poor\nand healing the sick; he saw their looks of joy, and heard their words\nof praise; and he could not doubt that Jesus of Nazareth was the Sent\nof God.\nHe greatly desired an interview with Jesus, but shrank from\nseeking Him openly. It would be too humiliating for a ruler of the\nJews to acknowledge himself in sympathy with a teacher as yet so\nlittle known. And should his visit come to the knowledge of the\nSanhedrin, it would draw upon him their scorn and denunciation. He\nresolved upon a secret interview, excusing this on the ground that\nif he were to go openly, others might follow his example. Learning\nby special inquiry the Saviour\u2019s place of retirement in the Mount\nof Olives, he waited until the city was hushed in slumber, and then\nsought Him.\nIn the presence of Christ, Nicodemus felt a strange timidity,\nwhich he endeavored to conceal under an air of composure and\ndignity. \u201cRabbi,\u201d he said, \u201cwe know that Thou art a teacher come\nfrom God: for no man can do these miracles that Thou doest, except\nGod be with him.\u201d By speaking of Christ\u2019s rare gifts as a teacher,\nand also of His wonderful power to perform miracles, he hoped to\npave the way for his interview. His words were designed to express\nand to invite confidence; but they really expressed unbelief. He did\nnot acknowledge Jesus to be the Messiah, but only a teacher sent\nfrom God.\nInstead of recognizing this salutation, Jesus bent His eyes upon\nthe speaker, as if reading his very soul. In His infinite wisdom He\nsaw before Him a seeker after truth. He knew the object of this visit,\nand with a desire to deepen the conviction already resting upon His\nlistener\u2019s mind, He came directly to the point, saying solemnly, yet\nkindly, \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born from\nabove, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\u201d John 3:3, margin.\nNicodemus had come to the Lord thinking to enter into a discus-[169]\n[170]\n[171]\nsion with Him, but Jesus laid bare the foundation principles of truth.\nHe said to Nicodemus, It is not theoretical knowledge you need so\nmuch as spiritual regeneration. You need not to have your curiosity\nsatisfied, but to have a new heart. You must receive a new life from\nNicodemus 135\nabove before you can appreciate heavenly things. Until this change\ntakes place, making all things new, it will result in no saving good\nfor you to discuss with Me My authority or My mission.\nNicodemus had heard the preaching of John the Baptist con-\ncerning repentance and baptism, and pointing the people to One\nwho should baptize with the Holy Spirit. He himself had felt that\nthere was a lack of spirituality among the Jews, that, to a great de-\ngree, they were controlled by bigotry and worldly ambition. He had\nhoped for a better state of things at the Messiah\u2019s coming. Yet the\nheart-searching message of the Baptist had failed to work in him\nconviction of sin. He was a strict Pharisee, and prided himself on\nhis good works. He was widely esteemed for his benevolence and\nhis liberality in sustaining the temple service, and he felt secure of\nthe favor of God. He was startled at the thought of a kingdom too\npure for him to see in his present state.\nThe figure of the new birth, which Jesus had used, was not wholly\nunfamiliar to Nicodemus. Converts from heathenism to the faith of\nIsrael were often compared to children just born. Therefore he must\nhave perceived that the words of Christ were not to be taken in a\nliteral sense. But by virtue of his birth as an Israelite he regarded\nhimself as sure of a place in the kingdom of God. He felt that he\nneeded no change. Hence his surprise at the Saviour\u2019s words. He\nwas irritated by their close application to himself. The pride of the\nPharisee was struggling against the honest desire of the seeker after\ntruth. He wondered that Christ should speak to him as He did, not\nrespecting his position as ruler in Israel.\nSurprised out of his self-possession, he answered Christ in words\nfull of irony, \u201cHow can a man be born when he is old?\u201d Like many\nothers when cutting truth is brought home to the conscience, he\nrevealed the fact that the natural man receiveth not the things of the\nSpirit of God. There is in him nothing that responds to spiritual\nthings; for spiritual things are spiritually discerned.\nBut the Saviour did not meet argument with argument. Raising\nHis hand with solemn, quiet dignity, He pressed the truth home with\ngreater assurance, \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be [172]\nborn of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of\nGod.\u201d Nicodemus knew that Christ here referred to water baptism\nand the renewing of the heart by the Spirit of God. He was convinced\n136 The Desire of Ages\nthat he was in the presence of the One whom John the Baptist had\nforetold.\nJesus continued: \u201cThat which is born of the flesh is flesh; and\nthat which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\u201d By nature the heart is evil,\nand \u201cwho can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.\u201d Job\n14:4. No human invention can find a remedy for the sinning soul.\n\u201cThe carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to\nthe law of God, neither indeed can be.\u201d \u201cOut of the heart proceed\nevil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness,\nblasphemies.\u201d Romans 8:7; Matthew 15:19. The fountain of the\nheart must be purified before the streams can become pure. He who\nis trying to reach heaven by his own works in keeping the law is\nattempting an impossibility. There is no safety for one who has\nmerely a legal religion, a form of godliness. The Christian\u2019s life is\nnot a modification or improvement of the old, but a transformation\nof nature. There is a death to self and sin, and a new life altogether.\nThis change can be brought about only by the effectual working of\nthe Holy Spirit.\nNicodemus was still perplexed, and Jesus used the wind to il-\nlustrate His meaning: \u201cThe wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou\nhearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and\nwhither it goeth: so is everyone that is born of the Spirit.\u201d\nThe wind is heard among the branches of the trees, rustling the\nleaves and flowers; yet it is invisible, and no man knows whence it\ncomes or whither it goes. So with the work of the Holy Spirit upon\nthe heart. It can no more be explained than can the movements of\nthe wind. A person may not be able to tell the exact time or place,\nor to trace all the circumstances in the process of conversion; but\nthis does not prove him to be unconverted. By an agency as unseen\nas the wind, Christ is constantly working upon the heart. Little by\nlittle, perhaps unconsciously to the receiver, impressions are made\nthat tend to draw the soul to Christ. These may be received through\nmeditating upon Him, through reading the Scriptures, or through\nhearing the word from the living preacher. Suddenly, as the Spirit\ncomes with more direct appeal, the soul gladly surrenders itself to\nJesus. By many this is called sudden conversion; but it is the result\nof long wooing by the Spirit of God,\u2014a patient, protracted process.\nWhile the wind is itself invisible, it produces effects that are seen[173]\nNicodemus 137\nand felt. So the work of the Spirit upon the soul will reveal itself\nin every act of him who has felt its saving power. When the Spirit\nof God takes possession of the heart, it transforms the life. Sinful\nthoughts are put away, evil deeds are renounced; love, humility, and\npeace take the place of anger, envy, and strife. Joy takes the place\nof sadness, and the countenance reflects the light of heaven. No\none sees the hand that lifts the burden, or beholds the light descend\nfrom the courts above. The blessing comes when by faith the soul\nsurrenders itself to God. Then that power which no human eye can\nsee creates a new being in the image of God.\nIt is impossible for finite minds to comprehend the work of\nredemption. Its mystery exceeds human knowledge; yet he who\npasses from death to life realizes that it is a divine reality. The\nbeginning of redemption we may know here through a personal\nexperience. Its results reach through the eternal ages.\nWhile Jesus was speaking, some gleams of truth penetrated the\nruler\u2019s mind. The softening, subduing influence of the Holy Spirit\nimpressed his heart. Yet he did not fully understand the Saviour\u2019s\nwords. He was not so much impressed by the necessity of the new\nbirth as by the manner of its accomplishment. He said wonderingly,\n\u201cHow can these things be?\u201d\n\u201cArt thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?\u201d\nJesus asked. Surely one entrusted with the religious instruction of\nthe people should not be ignorant of truths so important. His words\nconveyed the lesson that instead of feeling irritated over the plain\nwords of truth, Nicodemus should have had a very humble opinion\nof himself, because of his spiritual ignorance. Yet Christ spoke with\nsuch solemn dignity, and both look and tone expressed such earnest\nlove, that Nicodemus was not offended as he realized his humiliating\ncondition.\nBut as Jesus explained that His mission on earth was to establish\na spiritual instead of a temporal kingdom, His hearer was troubled.\nSeeing this, Jesus added, \u201cIf I have told you earthly things, and ye\nbelieve not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?\u201d If\nNicodemus could not receive Christ\u2019s teaching, illustrating the work\nof grace upon the heart, how could he comprehend the nature of His\nglorious heavenly kingdom? Not discerning the nature of Christ\u2019s\nwork on earth, he could not understand His work in heaven.\n138 The Desire of Ages\nThe Jews whom Jesus had driven from the temple claimed to\nbe children of Abraham, but they fled from the Saviour\u2019s presence\nbecause they could not endure the glory of God which was mani-[174]\nfested in Him. Thus they gave evidence that they were not fitted by\nthe grace of God to participate in the sacred services of the temple.\nThey were zealous to maintain an appearance of holiness, but they\nneglected holiness of heart. While they were sticklers for the letter\nof the law, they were constantly violating its spirit. Their great need\nwas that very change which Christ had been explaining to Nicode-\nmus,\u2014a new moral birth, a cleansing from sin, and a renewing of\nknowledge and holiness.\nThere was no excuse for the blindness of Israel in regard to\nthe work of regeneration. Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit,\nIsaiah had written, \u201cWe are all as an unclean thing, and all our\nrighteousnesses are as filthy rags.\u201d David had prayed, \u201cCreate in\nme a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.\u201d And\nthrough Ezekiel the promise had been given, \u201cA new heart also will\nI give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take\naway the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart\nof flesh. And I will put My Spirit within you, and cause you to walk\nin My statutes.\u201d Isaiah 64:6; Psalm 51:10; Ezekiel 36:26, 27.\nNicodemus had read these scriptures with a clouded mind; but he\nnow began to comprehend their meaning. He saw that the most rigid\nobedience to the mere letter of the law as applied to the outward\nlife could entitle no man to enter the kingdom of heaven. In the\nestimation of men, his life had been just and honorable; but in the\npresence of Christ he felt that his heart was unclean, and his life\nunholy.\nNicodemus was being drawn to Christ. As the Saviour explained\nto him concerning the new birth, he longed to have this change\nwrought in himself. By what means could it be accomplished? Jesus\nanswered the unspoken question: \u201cAs Moses lifted up the serpent\nin the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that\nwhosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.\u201d\nHere was ground with which Nicodemus was familiar. The\nsymbol of the uplifted serpent made plain to him the Saviour\u2019s\nmission. When the people of Israel were dying from the sting of\nthe fiery serpents, God directed Moses to make a serpent of brass,\nNicodemus 139\nand place it on high in the midst of the congregation. Then the word\nwas sounded throughout the encampment that all who would look\nupon the serpent should live. The people well knew that in itself\nthe serpent had no power to help them. It was a symbol of Christ.\nAs the image made in the likeness of the destroying serpents was [175]\nlifted up for their healing, so One made \u201cin the likeness of sinful\nflesh\u201d was to be their Redeemer. Romans 8:3. Many of the Israelites\nregarded the sacrificial service as having in itself virtue to set them\nfree from sin. God desired to teach them that it had no more value\nthan that serpent of brass. It was to lead their minds to the Saviour.\nWhether for the healing of their wounds or the pardon of their sins,\nthey could do nothing for themselves but show their faith in the Gift\nof God. They were to look and live.\nThose who had been bitten by the serpents might have delayed to\nlook. They might have questioned how there could be efficacy in that\nbrazen symbol. They might have demanded a scientific explanation.\nBut no explanation was given. They must accept the word of God to\nthem through Moses. To refuse to look was to perish.\nNot through controversy and discussion is the soul enlightened.\nWe must look and live. Nicodemus received the lesson, and carried\nit with him. He searched the Scriptures in a new way, not for the\ndiscussion of a theory, but in order to receive life for the soul. He\nbegan to see the kingdom of heaven as he submitted himself to the\nleading of the Holy Spirit.\nThere are thousands today who need to learn the same truth that\nwas taught to Nicodemus by the uplifted serpent. They depend on\ntheir obedience to the law of God to commend them to His favor.\nWhen they are bidden to look to Jesus, and believe that He saves\nthem solely through His grace, they exclaim, \u201cHow can these things\nbe?\u201d\nLike Nicodemus, we must be willing to enter into life in the\nsame way as the chief of sinners. Than Christ, \u201cthere is none other\nname under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\u201d\nActs 4:12. Through faith we receive the grace of God; but faith is\nnot our Saviour. It earns nothing. It is the hand by which we lay\nhold upon Christ, and appropriate His merits, the remedy for sin.\nAnd we cannot even repent without the aid of the Spirit of God. The\nScripture says of Christ, \u201cHim hath God exalted with His right hand\n140 The Desire of Ages\nto be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and\nforgiveness of sins.\u201d Acts 5:31. Repentance comes from Christ as\ntruly as does pardon.\nHow, then, are we to be saved? \u201cAs Moses lifted up the serpent in\nthe wilderness,\u201d so the Son of man has been lifted up, and everyone\nwho has been deceived and bitten by the serpent may look and live.\n\u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d[176]\nJohn 1:29. The light shining from the cross reveals the love of God.\nHis love is drawing us to Himself. If we do not resist this drawing,\nwe shall be led to the foot of the cross in repentance for the sins\nthat have crucified the Saviour. Then the Spirit of God through faith\nproduces a new life in the soul. The thoughts and desires are brought\ninto obedience to the will of Christ. The heart, the mind, are created\nanew in the image of Him who works in us to subdue all things to\nHimself. Then the law of God is written in the mind and heart, and\nwe can say with Christ, \u201cI delight to do Thy will, O my God.\u201d Psalm\n40:8.\nIn the interview with Nicodemus, Jesus unfolded the plan of\nsalvation, and His mission to the world. In none of His subsequent\ndiscourses did He explain so fully, step by step, the work necessary\nto be done in the hearts of all who would inherit the kingdom of\nheaven. At the very beginning of His ministry He opened the truth\nto a member of the Sanhedrin, to the mind that was most receptive,\nand to an appointed teacher of the people. But the leaders of Israel\ndid not welcome the light. Nicodemus hid the truth in his heart, and\nfor three years there was little apparent fruit.\nBut Jesus was acquainted with the soil into which He cast the\nseed. The words spoken at night to one listener in the lonely moun-\ntain were not lost. For a time Nicodemus did not publicly acknowl-\nedge Christ, but he watched His life, and pondered His teachings.\nIn the Sanhedrin council he repeatedly thwarted the schemes of the\npriests to destroy Him. When at last Jesus was lifted up on the cross,\nNicodemus remembered the teaching upon Olivet: \u201cAs Moses lifted\nup the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be\nlifted up: that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but[177]\nhave eternal life.\u201d The light from that secret interview illumined\nthe cross upon Calvary, and Nicodemus saw in Jesus the world\u2019s\nRedeemer.\nNicodemus 141\nAfter the Lord\u2019s ascension, when the disciples were scattered by\npersecution, Nicodemus came boldly to the front. He employed his\nwealth in sustaining the infant church that the Jews had expected to\nbe blotted out at the death of Christ. In the time of peril he who had\nbeen so cautious and questioning was firm as a rock, encouraging\nthe faith of the disciples, and furnishing means to carry forward\nthe work of the gospel. He was scorned and persecuted by those\nwho had paid him reverence in other days. He became poor in this\nworld\u2019s goods; yet he faltered not in the faith which had its beginning\nin that night conference with Jesus.\nNicodemus related to John the story of that interview, and by his\npen it was recorded for the instruction of millions. The truths there\ntaught are as important today as they were on that solemn night in\nthe shadowy mountain, when the Jewish ruler came to learn the way\nof life from the lowly Teacher of Galilee.\nChapter 18\u2014\u201cHe Must Increase\u201d[178]\nThis chapter is based on John 3:22-36.\nFor a time the Baptist\u2019s influence over the nation had been greater\nthan that of its rulers, priests, or princes. If he had announced himself\nas the Messiah, and raised a revolt against Rome, priests and people\nwould have flocked to his standard. Every consideration that appeals\nto the ambition of the world\u2019s conquerors Satan had stood ready to\nurge upon John the Baptist. But with the evidence before him of his\npower, he had steadfastly refused the splendid bribe. The attention\nwhich was fixed upon him he had directed to Another.\nNow he saw the tide of popularity turning away from himself\nto the Saviour. Day by day the crowds about him lessened. When\nJesus came from Jerusalem to the region about Jordan, the people\nflocked to hear Him. The number of His disciples increased daily.\nMany came for baptism, and while Christ Himself did not baptize,\nHe sanctioned the administration of the ordinance by His disciples.\nThus He set His seal upon the mission of His forerunner. But the\ndisciples of John looked with jealousy upon the growing popularity\nof Jesus. They stood ready to criticize His work, and it was not long\nbefore they found occasion. A question arose between them and the\nJews as to whether baptism availed to cleanse the soul from sin; they\nmaintained that the baptism of Jesus differed essentially from that\nof John. Soon they were in dispute with Christ\u2019s disciples in regard\nto the form of words proper to use at baptism, and finally as to the\nright of the latter to baptize at all.\nThe disciples of John came to him with their grievances, saying,[179]\n\u201cRabbi, He that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou bearest\nwitness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to Him.\u201d\nThrough these words, Satan brought temptation upon John. Though\nJohn\u2019s mission seemed about to close, it was still possible for him to\nhinder the work of Christ. If he had sympathized with himself, and\nexpressed grief or disappointment at being superseded, he would\n142\n\u201cHe Must Increase\u201d 143\nhave sown the seeds of dissension, would have encouraged envy\nand jealousy, and would seriously have impeded the progress of the\ngospel.\nJohn had by nature the faults and weaknesses common to hu-\nmanity, but the touch of divine love had transformed him. He dwelt\nin an atmosphere uncontaminated with selfishness and ambition,\nand far above the miasma of jealousy. He manifested no sympathy\nwith the dissatisfaction of his disciples, but showed how clearly he\nunderstood his relation to the Messiah, and how gladly he welcomed\nthe One for whom he had prepared the way.\nHe said, \u201cA man can receive nothing, except it be given him\nfrom heaven. Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the\nChrist, but that I am sent before Him. He that hath the bride is the\nbridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and\nheareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom\u2019s voice.\u201d\nJohn represented himself as the friend who acted as a messenger\nbetween the betrothed parties, preparing the way for the marriage.\nWhen the bridegroom had received his bride, the mission of the\nfriend was fulfilled. He rejoiced in the happiness of those whose\nunion he had promoted. So John had been called to direct the people\nto Jesus, and it was his joy to witness the success of the Saviour\u2019s\nwork. He said, \u201cThis my joy therefore is fulfilled. He must increase,\nbut I must decrease.\u201d\nLooking in faith to the Redeemer, John had risen to the height\nof self-abnegation. He sought not to attract men to himself, but to\nlift their thoughts higher and still higher, until they should rest upon\nthe Lamb of God. He himself had been only a voice, a cry in the\nwilderness. Now with joy he accepted silence and obscurity, that the\neyes of all might be turned to the Light of life.\nThose who are true to their calling as messengers for God will\nnot seek honor for themselves. Love for self will be swallowed up in\nlove for Christ. No rivalry will mar the precious cause of the gospel.\nThey will recognize that it is their work to proclaim, as did John the\nBaptist, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the [180]\nworld.\u201d John 1:29. They will lift up Jesus, and with Him humanity\nwill be lifted up. \u201cThus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth\neternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place,\nwith him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the\n144 The Desire of Ages\nspirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.\u201d\nIsaiah 57:15.\nThe soul of the prophet, emptied of self, was filled with the light\nof the divine. As he witnessed to the Saviour\u2019s glory, his words were\nalmost a counterpart of those that Christ Himself had spoken in His\ninterview with Nicodemus. John said, \u201cHe that cometh from above\nis above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the\nearth: He that cometh from heaven is above all.... For He whom God\nhath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit\nby measure unto Him.\u201d Christ could say, \u201cI seek not Mine own will,\nbut the will of the Father which hath sent Me.\u201d John 5:30. To Him\nit is declared, \u201cThou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;\ntherefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of\ngladness above Thy fellows.\u201d Hebrews 1:9. The Father \u201cgiveth not\nthe Spirit by measure unto Him.\u201d\nSo with the followers of Christ. We can receive of heaven\u2019s light[181]\nonly as we are willing to be emptied of self. We cannot discern\nthe character of God, or accept Christ by faith, unless we consent\nto the bringing into captivity of every thought to the obedience of\nChrist. To all who do this the Holy Spirit is given without measure.\nIn Christ \u201cdwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and in\nHim ye are made full.\u201d Colossians 2:9, 10, R. V .\nThe disciples of John had declared that all men were coming\nto Christ; but with clearer insight, John said, \u201cNo man receiveth\nHis witness;\u201d so few were ready to accept Him as the Saviour from\nsin. But \u201che that hath received His witness hath set his seal to this,\nthat God is true.\u201d John 3:33, R. V . \u201cHe that believeth on the Son\nhath everlasting life.\u201d No need of disputation as to whether Christ\u2019s\nbaptism or John\u2019s purified from sin. It is the grace of Christ that\ngives life to the soul. Apart from Christ, baptism, like any other\nservice, is a worthless form. \u201cHe that believeth not the Son shall not\nsee life.\u201d\nThe success of Christ\u2019s work, which the Baptist had received\nwith such joy, was reported also to the authorities at Jerusalem. The\npriests and rabbis had been jealous of John\u2019s influence as they saw\nthe people leaving the synagogues and flocking to the wilderness; but\nhere was One who had still greater power to attract the multitudes.\nThose leaders in Israel were not willing to say with John, \u201cHe must\n\u201cHe Must Increase\u201d 145\nincrease, but I must decrease.\u201d They arose with a new determination\nto put an end to the work that was drawing the people away from\nthem.\nJesus knew that they would spare no effort to create a division\nbetween His own disciples and those of John. He knew that the\nstorm was gathering which would sweep away one of the greatest\nprophets ever given to the world. Wishing to avoid all occasion for\nmisunderstanding or dissension, He quietly ceased His labors, and\nwithdrew to Galilee. We also, while loyal to truth, should try to avoid\nall that may lead to discord and misapprehension. For whenever\nthese arise, they result in the loss of souls. Whenever circumstances\noccur that threaten to cause division, we should follow the example\nof Jesus and of John the Baptist.\nJohn had been called to lead out as a reformer. Because of\nthis, his disciples were in danger of fixing their attention upon him,\nfeeling that the success of the work depended upon his labors, and\nlosing sight of the fact that he was only an instrument through which\nGod had wrought. But the work of John was not sufficient to lay\nthe foundation of the Christian church. When he had fulfilled his [182]\nmission, another work was to be done, which his testimony could not\naccomplish. His disciples did not understand this. When they saw\nChrist coming in to take the work, they were jealous and dissatisfied.\nThe same dangers still exist. God calls a man to do a certain\nwork; and when he has carried it as far as he is qualified to take it,\nthe Lord brings in others, to carry it still farther. But, like John\u2019s\ndisciples, many feel that the success of the work depends on the first\nlaborer. Attention is fixed upon the human instead of the divine,\njealousy comes in, and the work of God is marred. The one thus\nunduly honored is tempted to cherish self-confidence. He does not\nrealize his dependence on God. The people are taught to rely on\nman for guidance, and thus they fall into error, and are led away\nfrom God.\nThe work of God is not to bear the image and superscription of\nman. From time to time the Lord will bring in different agencies,\nthrough whom His purpose can best be accomplished. Happy are\nthey who are willing for self to be humbled, saying with John the\nBaptist, \u201cHe must increase, but I must decrease.\u201d\nChapter 19\u2014At Jacob\u2019s Well[183]\nThis chapter is based on John 4:1-42.\nOn the way to Galilee Jesus passed through Samaria. It was noon\nwhen He reached the beautiful Vale of Shechem. At the opening of\nthis valley was Jacob\u2019s well. Wearied with His journey, He sat down\nhere to rest while His disciples went to buy food.\nThe Jews and the Samaritans were bitter enemies, and as far\nas possible avoided all dealing with each other. To trade with the\nSamaritans in case of necessity was indeed counted lawful by the\nrabbis; but all social intercourse with them was condemned. A Jew\nwould not borrow from a Samaritan, nor receive a kindness, not even\na morsel of bread or a cup of water. The disciples, in buying food,\nwere acting in harmony with the custom of their nation. But beyond\nthis they did not go. To ask a favor of the Samaritans, or in any way\nseek to benefit them, did not enter into the thought of even Christ\u2019s\ndisciples.\nAs Jesus sat by the well side, He was faint from hunger and\nthirst. The journey since morning had been long, and now the sun\nof noontide beat upon Him. His thirst was increased by the thought\nof the cool, refreshing water so near, yet inaccessible to Him; for\nHe had no rope nor water jar, and the well was deep. The lot of\nhumanity was His, and He waited for someone to come to draw.\nA woman of Samaria approached, and seeming unconscious of\nHis presence, filled her pitcher with water. As she turned to go away,\nJesus asked her for a drink. Such a favor no Oriental would withhold.\nIn the East, water was called \u201cthe gift of God.\u201d To offer a drink to the\nthirsty traveler was held to be a duty so sacred that the Arabs of the[184]\ndesert would go out of their way in order to perform it. The hatred\nbetween Jews and Samaritans prevented the woman from offering a\nkindness to Jesus; but the Saviour was seeking to find the key to this\nheart, and with the tact born of divine love, He asked, not offered,\na favor. The offer of a kindness might have been rejected; but trust\n146\nAt Jacob\u2019s Well 147\nawakens trust. The King of heaven came to this outcast soul, asking\na service at her hands. He who made the ocean, who controls the\nwaters of the great deep, who opened the springs and channels of the\nearth, rested from His weariness at Jacob\u2019s well, and was dependent\nupon a stranger\u2019s kindness for even the gift of a drink of water.\nThe woman saw that Jesus was a Jew. In her surprise she forgot\nto grant His request, but tried to learn the reason for it. \u201cHow is it,\u201d\nshe said, \u201cthat Thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a\nwoman of Samaria?\u201d\nJesus answered, \u201cIf thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is\nthat saith to thee, Give Me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of\nHim, and He would have given thee living water.\u201d You wonder that I\nshould ask of you even so small a favor as a draught of water from\nthe well at our feet. Had you asked of Me, I would have given you\nto drink of the water of everlasting life.\nThe woman had not comprehended the words of Christ, but\nshe felt their solemn import. Her light, bantering manner began to\nchange. Supposing that Jesus spoke of the well before them, she\nsaid, \u201cSir, Thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from\nwhence then hast Thou that living water? Art Thou greater than our\nfather Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself?\u201d\nShe saw before her only a thirsty traveler, wayworn and dusty. In\nher mind she compared Him with the honored patriarch Jacob. She\ncherished the feeling, which is so natural, that no other well could\nbe equal to that provided by the fathers. She was looking backward\nto the fathers, forward to the Messiah\u2019s coming, while the Hope of\nthe fathers, the Messiah Himself, was beside her, and she knew Him\nnot. How many thirsting souls are today close by the living fountain,\nyet looking far away for the wellsprings of life! \u201cSay not in thine\nheart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down\nfrom above:) or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring\nup Christ again from the dead).... The word is nigh thee, even in thy\nmouth, and in thy heart: ... if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the\nLord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him\nfrom the dead, thou shalt be saved.\u201d Romans 10:6-9.\nJesus did not immediately answer the question in regard to Him- [185]\n[186]\n[187]\nself, but with solemn earnestness He said, \u201cWhosoever drinketh of\nthis water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that\n148 The Desire of Ages\nI shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him\nshall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\u201d\nHe who seeks to quench his thirst at the fountains of this world\nwill drink only to thirst again. Everywhere men are unsatisfied. They\nlong for something to supply the need of the soul. Only One can\nmeet that want. The need of the world, \u201cThe Desire of all nations,\u201d\nis Christ. The divine grace which He alone can impart, is as living\nwater, purifying, refreshing, and invigorating the soul.\nJesus did not convey the idea that merely one draft of the water\nof life would suffice the receiver. He who tastes of the love of Christ\nwill continually long for more; but he seeks for nothing else. The\nriches, honors, and pleasures of the world do not attract him. The\nconstant cry of his heart is, More of Thee. And He who reveals\nto the soul its necessity is waiting to satisfy its hunger and thirst.\nEvery human resource and dependence will fail. The cisterns will be\nemptied, the pools become dry; but our Redeemer is an inexhaustible\nfountain. We may drink, and drink again, and ever find a fresh\nsupply. He in whom Christ dwells has within himself the fountain\nof blessing,\u2014\u201ca well of water springing up into everlasting life.\u201d\nFrom this source he may draw strength and grace sufficient for all\nhis needs.\nAs Jesus spoke of the living water, the woman looked upon\nHim with wondering attention. He had aroused her interest, and\nawakened a desire for the gift of which He spoke. She perceived that\nit was not the water of Jacob\u2019s well to which He referred; for of this\nshe used continually, drinking, and thirsting again. \u201cSir,\u201d she said,\n\u201cgive me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.\u201d\nJesus now abruptly turned the conversation. Before this soul\ncould receive the gift He longed to bestow, she must be brought\nto recognize her sin and her Saviour. He \u201csaith unto her, Go, call\nthy husband, and come hither.\u201d She answered, \u201cI have no husband.\u201d\nThus she hoped to prevent all questioning in that direction. But the\nSaviour continued, \u201cThou hast well said, I have no husband: for\nthou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy\nhusband: in that saidst thou truly.\u201d\nThe listener trembled. A mysterious hand was turning the pages\nof her life history, bringing to view that which she had hoped to keep\nforever hidden. Who was He that could read the secrets of her life?[188]\nAt Jacob\u2019s Well 149\nThere came to her thoughts of eternity, of the future Judgment, when\nall that is now hidden shall be revealed. In its light, conscience was\nawakened.\nShe could deny nothing; but she tried to evade all mention of a\nsubject so unwelcome. With deep reverence, she said, \u201cSir, I perceive\nthat Thou art a prophet.\u201d Then, hoping to silence conviction, she\nturned to points of religious controversy. If this was a prophet, surely\nHe could give her instruction concerning these matters that had been\nso long disputed.\nPatiently Jesus permitted her to lead the conversation whither\nshe would. Meanwhile He watched for the opportunity of again\nbringing the truth home to her heart. \u201cOur fathers worshiped in\nthis mountain,\u201d she said, \u201cand ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place\nwhere men ought to worship.\u201d Just in sight was Mount Gerizim.\nIts temple was demolished, and only the altar remained. The place\nof worship had been a subject of contention between the Jews and\nthe Samaritans. Some of the ancestors of the latter people had\nonce belonged to Israel; but because of their sins, the Lord suffered\nthem to be overcome by an idolatrous nation. For many generations\nthey were intermingled with idolaters, whose religion gradually\ncontaminated their own. It is true they held that their idols were\nonly to remind them of the living God, the Ruler of the universe;\nnevertheless the people were led to reverence their graven images.\nWhen the temple at Jerusalem was rebuilt in the days of Ezra,\nthe Samaritans wished to join the Jews in its erection. This privilege\nwas refused them, and a bitter animosity sprang up between the two\npeoples. The Samaritans built a rival temple on Mount Gerizim.\nHere they worshiped in accordance with the Mosaic ritual, though\nthey did not wholly renounce idolatry. But disasters attended them,\ntheir temple was destroyed by their enemies, and they seemed to be\nunder a curse; yet they still clung to their traditions and their forms\nof worship. They would not acknowledge the temple at Jerusalem\nas the house of God, nor admit that the religion of the Jews was\nsuperior to their own.\nIn answer to the woman, Jesus said, \u201cBelieve Me, the hour\ncometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem,\nworship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what\nwe worship: for salvation is of the Jews.\u201d Jesus had shown that He\n150 The Desire of Ages\nwas free from Jewish prejudice against the Samaritans. Now He\nsought to break down the prejudice of this Samaritan against the[189]\nJews. While referring to the fact that the faith of the Samaritans\nwas corrupted with idolatry, He declared that the great truths of\nredemption had been committed to the Jews, and that from among\nthem the Messiah was to appear. In the Sacred Writings they had a\nclear presentation of the character of God and the principles of His\ngovernment. Jesus classed Himself with the Jews as those to whom\nGod had given a knowledge of Himself.\nHe desired to lift the thoughts of His hearer above matters of form\nand ceremony, and questions of controversy. \u201cThe hour cometh,\u201d\nHe said, \u201cand now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the\nFather in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship\nHim. God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him\nin spirit and in truth.\u201d\nHere is declared the same truth that Jesus had revealed to Nicode-\nmus when He said, \u201cExcept a man be born from above, he cannot\nsee the kingdom of God.\u201d John 3:3, margin. Not by seeking a holy\nmountain or a sacred temple are men brought into communion with\nheaven. Religion is not to be confined to external forms and cer-\nemonies. The religion that comes from God is the only religion\nthat will lead to God. In order to serve Him aright, we must be\nborn of the divine Spirit. This will purify the heart and renew the\nmind, giving us a new capacity for knowing and loving God. It will\ngive us a willing obedience to all His requirements. This is true\nworship. It is the fruit of the working of the Holy Spirit. By the\nSpirit every sincere prayer is indited, and such prayer is acceptable\nto God. Wherever a soul reaches out after God, there the Spirit\u2019s\nworking is manifest, and God will reveal Himself to that soul. For\nsuch worshipers He is seeking. He waits to receive them, and to\nmake them His sons and daughters.\nAs the woman talked with Jesus, she was impressed with His\nwords. Never had she heard such sentiments from the priests of her\nown people or from the Jews. As the past of her life had been spread\nout before her, she had been made sensible of her great want. She\nrealized her soul thirst, which the waters of the well of Sychar could\nnever satisfy. Nothing that had hitherto come in contact with her had\nso awakened her to a higher need. Jesus had convinced her that He\nAt Jacob\u2019s Well 151\nread the secrets of her life; yet she felt that He was her friend, pitying\nand loving her. While the very purity of His presence condemned\nher sin, He had spoken no word of denunciation, but had told her\nof His grace, that could renew the soul. She began to have some [190]\nconviction of His character. The question arose in her mind, Might\nnot this be the long-looked-for Messiah? She said to Him, \u201cI know\nthat Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when He is come, He\nwill tell us all things.\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cI that speak unto thee am\nHe.\u201d\nAs the woman heard these words, faith sprang up in her heart.\nShe accepted the wonderful announcement from the lips of the divine\nTeacher.\nThis woman was in an appreciative state of mind. She was\nready to receive the noblest revelation; for she was interested in\nthe Scriptures, and the Holy Spirit had been preparing her mind to\nreceive more light. She had studied the Old Testament promise,\n\u201cThe Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst\nof thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto Him ye shall hearken.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 18:15. She longed to understand this prophecy. Light\nwas already flashing into her mind. The water of life, the spiritual\nlife which Christ gives to every thirsty soul, had begun to spring up\nin her heart. The Spirit of the Lord was working with her.\nThe plain statement made by Christ to this woman could not\nhave been made to the self-righteous Jews. Christ was far more\nreserved when He spoke to them. That which had been withheld\nfrom the Jews, and which the disciples were afterward enjoined to\nkeep secret, was revealed to her. Jesus saw that she would make use\nof her knowledge in bringing others to share His grace.\nWhen the disciples returned from their errand, they were sur-\nprised to find their Master speaking with the woman. He had not\ntaken the refreshing draught that He desired, and He did not stop to\neat the food His disciples had brought. When the woman had gone,\nthe disciples entreated Him to eat. They saw Him silent, absorbed,\nas in rapt meditation. His face was beaming with light, and they\nfeared to interrupt His communion with heaven. But they knew that\nHe was faint and weary, and thought it their duty to remind Him of\nHis physical necessities. Jesus recognized their loving interest, and\nHe said, \u201cI have meat to eat that ye know not of.\u201d\n152 The Desire of Ages\nThe disciples wondered who could have brought Him food; but\nHe explained, \u201cMy meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me, and to\naccomplish His work.\u201d John 4:34, R. V . As His words to the woman\nhad aroused her conscience, Jesus rejoiced. He saw her drinking of\nthe water of life, and His own hunger and thirst were satisfied. The [191]\naccomplishment of the mission which He had left heaven to perform\nstrengthened the Saviour for His labor, and lifted Him above the\nnecessities of humanity. To minister to a soul hungering and thirsting\nfor the truth was more grateful to Him than eating or drinking. It\nwas a comfort, a refreshment, to Him. Benevolence was the life of\nHis soul.\nOur Redeemer thirsts for recognition. He hungers for the sympa-\nthy and love of those whom He has purchased with His own blood.\nHe longs with inexpressible desire that they should come to Him\nand have life. As the mother watches for the smile of recognition\nfrom her little child, which tells of the dawning of intelligence, so\ndoes Christ watch for the expression of grateful love, which shows\nthat spiritual life is begun in the soul.\nThe woman had been filled with joy as she listened to Christ\u2019s\nwords. The wonderful revelation was almost overpowering. Leav-\ning her waterpot, she returned to the city, to carry the message to\nothers. Jesus knew why she had gone. Leaving her waterpot spoke\nunmistakably as to the effect of His words. It was the earnest desire\nof her soul to obtain the living water; and she forgot her errand to\nthe well, she forgot the Saviour\u2019s thirst, which she had purposed to\nsupply. With heart overflowing with gladness, she hastened on her\nway, to impart to others the precious light she had received.\n\u201cCome, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did,\u201d\nshe said to the men of the city. \u201cIs not this the Christ?\u201d Her words\ntouched their hearts. There was a new expression on her face, a\nchange in her whole appearance. They were interested to see Jesus.\n\u201cThen they went out of the city, and came unto Him.\u201d\nAs Jesus still sat at the well side, He looked over the fields of\ngrain that were spread out before Him, their tender green touched\nby the golden sunlight. Pointing His disciples to the scene, He\nemployed it as a symbol: \u201cSay not ye, There are yet four months,\nand then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes,\nand look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.\u201d And as\nAt Jacob\u2019s Well 153\nHe spoke, He looked on the groups that were coming to the well. It\nwas four months to the time for harvesting the grain, but here was a\nharvest ready for the reaper.\n\u201cHe that reapeth,\u201d He said, \u201creceiveth wages, and gathereth fruit\nunto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may\nrejoice together. And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and [192]\nanother reapeth.\u201d Here Christ points out the sacred service owed\nto God by those who receive the gospel. They are to be His living\nagencies. He requires their individual service. And whether we sow\nor reap, we are working for God. One scatters the seed; another\ngathers in the harvest; and both the sower and the reaper receive\nwages. They rejoice together in the reward of their labor.\nJesus said to the disciples, \u201cI sent you to reap that whereon\nye bestowed no labor: other men labored, and ye are entered into\ntheir labors.\u201d The Saviour was here looking forward to the great\ningathering on the day of Pentecost. The disciples were not to\nregard this as the result of their own efforts. They were entering\ninto other men\u2019s labors. Ever since the fall of Adam Christ had been\ncommitting the seed of the word to His chosen servants, to be sown\nin human hearts. And an unseen agency, even an omnipotent power,\nhad worked silently but effectually to produce the harvest. The dew\nand rain and sunshine of God\u2019s grace had been given, to refresh and\nnourish the seed of truth. Christ was about to water the seed with\nHis own blood. His disciples were privileged to be laborers together\nwith God. They were coworkers with Christ and with the holy men\nof old. By the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, thousands\nwere to be converted in a day. This was the result of Christ\u2019s sowing,\nthe harvest of His work.\nIn the words spoken to the woman at the well, good seed had been\nsown, and how quickly the harvest was received. The Samaritans\ncame and heard Jesus, and believed on Him. Crowding about Him\nat the well, they plied Him with questions, and eagerly received\nHis explanations of many things that had been obscure to them. As\nthey listened, their perplexity began to clear away. They were like a\npeople in great darkness tracing up a sudden ray of light till they had\nfound the day. But they were not satisfied with this short conference.\nThey were anxious to hear more, and to have their friends also listen\nto this wonderful teacher. They invited Him to their city, and begged\n154 The Desire of Ages\nHim to remain with them. For two days He tarried in Samaria, and\nmany more believed on Him.\nThe Pharisees despised the simplicity of Jesus. They ignored\nHis miracles, and demanded a sign that He was the Son of God.\nBut the Samaritans asked no sign, and Jesus performed no miracles\namong them, save in revealing the secrets of her life to the woman\nat the well. Yet many received Him. In their new joy they said to the\nwoman, \u201cNow we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have[193]\nheard Him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the\nSaviour of the world.\u201d\nThe Samaritans believed that the Messiah was to come as the\nRedeemer, not only of the Jews, but of the world. The Holy\nSpirit through Moses had foretold Him as a prophet sent from God.\nThrough Jacob it had been declared that unto Him should the gath-\nering of the people be; and through Abraham, that in Him all the\nnations of the earth should be blessed. On these scriptures the people\nof Samaria based their faith in the Messiah. The fact that the Jews\nhad misinterpreted the later prophets, attributing to the first advent\nthe glory of Christ\u2019s second coming, had led the Samaritans to dis-\ncard all the sacred writings except those given through Moses. But\nas the Saviour swept away these false interpretations, many accepted\nthe later prophecies and the words of Christ Himself in regard to the\nkingdom of God.\nJesus had begun to break down the partition wall between Jew\nand Gentile, and to preach salvation to the world. Though He was\na Jew, He mingled freely with the Samaritans, setting at nought\nthe Pharisaic customs of His nation. In face of their prejudices He\naccepted the hospitality of this despised people. He slept under their\nroofs, ate with them at their tables,\u2014partaking of the food prepared\nand served by their hands,\u2014taught in their streets, and treated them\nwith the utmost kindness and courtesy.\nIn the temple at Jerusalem a low wall separated the outer court\nfrom all other portions of the sacred building. Upon this wall were\ninscriptions in different languages, stating that none but Jews were\nallowed to pass this boundary. Had a Gentile presumed to enter the\ninner enclosure, he would have desecrated the temple, and would\nhave paid the penalty with his life. But Jesus, the originator of the\ntemple and its service, drew the Gentiles to Him by the tie of human\nAt Jacob\u2019s Well 155\nsympathy, while His divine grace brought to them the salvation\nwhich the Jews rejected.\nThe stay of Jesus in Samaria was designed to be a blessing to\nHis disciples, who were still under the influence of Jewish bigotry.\nThey felt that loyalty to their own nation required them to cherish\nenmity toward the Samaritans. They wondered at the conduct of\nJesus. They could not refuse to follow His example, and during\nthe two days in Samaria, fidelity to Him kept their prejudices under\ncontrol; yet in heart they were unreconciled. They were slow to learn\nthat their contempt and hatred must give place to pity and sympathy. [194]\nBut after the Lord\u2019s ascension, His lessons came back to them with a\nnew meaning. After the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, they recalled\nthe Saviour\u2019s look, His words, the respect and tenderness of His\nbearing toward these despised strangers. When Peter went to preach\nin Samaria, he brought the same spirit into his own work. When John\nwas called to Ephesus and Smyrna, he remembered the experience\nat Shechem, and was filled with gratitude to the divine Teacher, who,\nforeseeing the difficulties they must meet, had given them help in\nHis own example.\nThe Saviour is still carrying forward the same work as when He\nproffered the water of life to the woman of Samaria. Those who call\nthemselves His followers may despise and shun the outcast ones; but\nno circumstance of birth or nationality, no condition of life, can turn\naway His love from the children of men. To every soul, however\nsinful, Jesus says, If thou hadst asked of Me, I would have given\nthee living water.\nThe gospel invitation is not to be narrowed down, and presented\nonly to a select few, who, we suppose, will do us honor if they accept\nit. The message is to be given to all. Wherever hearts are open to\nreceive the truth, Christ is ready to instruct them. He reveals to them\nthe Father, and the worship acceptable to Him who reads the heart.\nFor such He uses no parables. To them, as to the woman at the well,\nHe says, \u201cI that speak unto thee am He.\u201d\nWhen Jesus sat down to rest at Jacob\u2019s well, He had come from\nJudea, where His ministry had produced little fruit. He had been\nrejected by the priests and rabbis, and even the people who professed\nto be His disciples had failed of perceiving His divine character. He\nwas faint and weary; yet He did not neglect the opportunity of\n156 The Desire of Ages\nspeaking to one woman, though she was a stranger, an alien from\nIsrael, and living in open sin.\nThe Saviour did not wait for congregations to assemble. Often\nHe began His lessons with only a few gathered about Him, but one\nby one the passers-by paused to listen, until a multitude heard with\nwonder and awe the words of God through the heaven-sent Teacher.\nThe worker for Christ should not feel that he cannot speak with the\nsame earnestness to a few hearers as to a larger company. There may\nbe only one to hear the message; but who can tell how far-reaching\nwill be its influence? It seemed a small matter, even to His disciples,\nfor the Saviour to spend His time upon a woman of Samaria. But He[195]\nreasoned more earnestly and eloquently with her than with kings,\ncouncilors, or high priests. The lessons He gave to that woman have\nbeen repeated to the earth\u2019s remotest bounds.\nAs soon as she had found the Saviour the Samaritan woman\nbrought others to Him. She proved herself a more effective mission-\nary than His own disciples. The disciples saw nothing in Samaria\nto indicate that it was an encouraging field. Their thoughts were\nfixed upon a great work to be done in the future. They did not see\nthat right around them was a harvest to be gathered. But through the\nwoman whom they despised, a whole cityful were brought to hear\nthe Saviour. She carried the light at once to her countrymen.\nThis woman represents the working of a practical faith in Christ.\nEvery true disciple is born into the kingdom of God as a missionary.\nHe who drinks of the living water becomes a fountain of life. The\nreceiver becomes a giver. The grace of Christ in the soul is like a\nspring in the desert, welling up to refresh all, and making those who\nare ready to perish eager to drink of the water of life.\nChapter 20\u2014\u201cExcept Ye See Signs and Wonders\u201d [196]\nThis chapter is based on John 4:43-54.\nThe Galileans who returned from the Passover brought back the\nreport of the wonderful works of Jesus. The judgment passed upon\nHis acts by the dignitaries at Jerusalem opened His way in Galilee.\nMany of the people lamented the abuse of the temple and the greed\nand arrogance of the priests. They hoped that this Man, who had put\nthe rulers to flight, might be the looked-for Deliverer. Now tidings\nhad come that seemed to confirm their brightest anticipations. It was\nreported that the prophet had declared Himself to be the Messiah.\nBut the people of Nazareth did not believe on Him. For this\nreason, Jesus did not visit Nazareth on His way to Cana. The Saviour\ndeclared to His disciples that a prophet has no honor in his own\ncountry. Men estimate character by that which they themselves are\ncapable of appreciating. The narrow and worldly-minded judged\nof Christ by His humble birth, His lowly garb, and daily toil. They\ncould not appreciate the purity of that spirit upon which was no stain\nof sin.\nThe news of Christ\u2019s return to Cana soon spread throughout\nGalilee, bringing hope to the suffering and distressed. In Capernaum\nthe tidings attracted the attention of a Jewish nobleman who was an\nofficer in the king\u2019s service. A son of the officer was suffering from [197]\nwhat seemed to be an incurable disease. Physicians had given him\nup to die; but when the father heard of Jesus, he determined to seek\nhelp from Him. The child was very low, and, it was feared, might\nnot live till his return; yet the nobleman felt that he must present the\ncase in person. He hoped that a father\u2019s prayers might awaken the\nsympathy of the Great Physician.\nOn reaching Cana he found a throng surrounding Jesus. With\nan anxious heart he pressed through to the Saviour\u2019s presence. His\nfaith faltered when he saw only a plainly dressed man, dusty and\nworn with travel. He doubted that this Person could do what he had\n157\n158 The Desire of Ages\ncome to ask of Him; yet he secured an interview with Jesus, told his\nerrand, and besought the Saviour to accompany him to his home.\nBut already his sorrow was known to Jesus. Before the officer had[198]\nleft his home, the Saviour had beheld his affliction.\nBut He knew also that the father had, in his own mind, made\nconditions concerning his belief in Jesus. Unless his petition should\nbe granted, he would not receive Him as the Messiah. While the\nofficer waited in an agony of suspense, Jesus said, \u201cExcept ye see\nsigns and wonders, ye will not believe.\u201d\nNotwithstanding all the evidence that Jesus was the Christ, the\npetitioner had determined to make his belief in Him conditional\non the granting of his own request. The Saviour contrasted this\nquestioning unbelief with the simple faith of the Samaritans, who\nasked for no miracle or sign. His word, the ever-present evidence\nof His divinity, had a convincing power that reached their hearts.\nChrist was pained that His own people, to whom the Sacred Oracles\nhad been committed, should fail to hear the voice of God speaking\nto them in His Son.\nYet the nobleman had a degree of faith; for he had come to ask\nwhat seemed to him the most precious of all blessings. Jesus had\na greater gift to bestow. He desired, not only to heal the child, but\nto make the officer and his household sharers in the blessings of\nsalvation, and to kindle a light in Capernaum, which was so soon\nto be the field of His own labors. But the nobleman must realize\nhis need before he would desire the grace of Christ. This courtier\nrepresented many of his nation. They were interested in Jesus from\nselfish motives. They hoped to receive some special benefit through\nHis power, and they staked their faith on the granting of this temporal\nfavor; but they were ignorant as to their spiritual disease, and saw\nnot their need of divine grace.\nLike a flash of light, the Saviour\u2019s words to the nobleman laid\nbare his heart. He saw that his motives in seeking Jesus were selfish.\nHis vacillating faith appeared to him in its true character. In deep\ndistress he realized that his doubt might cost the life of his son.\nHe knew that he was in the presence of One who could read the\nthoughts, and to whom all things were possible. In an agony of\nsupplication he cried, \u201cSir, come down ere my child die.\u201d His faith\ntook hold upon Christ as did Jacob, when, wrestling with the Angel,\n\u201cExcept Ye See Signs and Wonders\u201d 159\nhe cried, \u201cI will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.\u201d Genesis\n32:26.\nLike Jacob he prevailed. The Saviour cannot withdraw from the\nsoul that clings to Him, pleading its great need. \u201cGo thy way,\u201d He\nsaid; \u201cthy son liveth.\u201d The nobleman left the Saviour\u2019s presence with\na peace and joy he had never known before. Not only did he believe [199]\nthat his son would be restored, but with strong confidence he trusted\nin Christ as the Redeemer.\nAt the same hour the watchers beside the dying child in the home\nat Capernaum beheld a sudden and mysterious change. The shadow\nof death was lifted from the sufferer\u2019s face. The flush of fever gave\nplace to the soft glow of returning health. The dim eyes brightened\nwith intelligence, and strength returned to the feeble, emaciated\nframe. No signs of his malady lingered about the child. His burning\nflesh had become soft and moist, and he sank into a quiet sleep.\nThe fever had left him in the very heat of the day. The family were\namazed, and great was the rejoicing.\nCana was not so far from Capernaum but that the officer might\nhave reached his home on the evening after his interview with Jesus;\nbut he did not hasten on the homeward journey. It was not until the\nnext morning that he reached Capernaum. What a homecoming was\nthat! When he went to find Jesus, his heart was heavy with sorrow.\nThe sunshine seemed cruel to him, the songs of the birds a mockery.\nHow different his feelings now! All nature wears a new aspect. He\nsees with new eyes. As he journeys in the quiet of the early morning,\nall nature seems to be praising God with him. While he is still some\ndistance from his own dwelling, servants come out to meet him,\nanxious to relieve the suspense they are sure he must feel. He shows\nno surprise at the news they bring, but with a depth of interest they\ncannot know he asks at what hour the child began to mend. They\nanswer, \u201cYesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.\u201d At the\nvery moment when the father\u2019s faith grasped the assurance, \u201cThy\nson liveth,\u201d divine love touched the dying child.\nThe father hurries on to greet his son. He clasps him to his heart [200]\nas one restored from the dead, and thanks God again and again for\nthis wonderful restoration.\nThe nobleman longed to know more of Christ. As he afterward\nheard His teaching, he and all his household became disciples. Their\n160 The Desire of Ages\naffliction was sanctified to the conversion of the entire family. Tid-\nings of the miracle spread; and in Capernaum, where so many of His\nmighty works were performed, the way was prepared for Christ\u2019s\npersonal ministry.\nHe who blessed the nobleman at Capernaum is just as desirous\nof blessing us. But like the afflicted father, we are often led to seek\nJesus by the desire for some earthly good; and upon the granting of\nour request we rest our confidence in His love. The Saviour longs to\ngive us a greater blessing than we ask; and He delays the answer to\nour request that He may show us the evil of our own hearts, and our\ndeep need of His grace. He desires us to renounce the selfishness\nthat leads us to seek Him. Confessing our helplessness and bitter\nneed, we are to trust ourselves wholly to His love.\nThe nobleman wanted to see the fulfillment of his prayer before\nhe should believe; but he had to accept the word of Jesus that his\nrequest was heard and the blessing granted. This lesson we also\nhave to learn. Not because we see or feel that God hears us are we\nto believe. We are to trust in His promises. When we come to Him\nin faith, every petition enters the heart of God. When we have asked\nfor His blessing, we should believe that we receive it, and thank Him\nthat we have received it. Then we are to go about our duties, assured\nthat the blessing will be realized when we need it most. When we\nhave learned to do this, we shall know that our prayers are answered.\nGod will do for us \u201cexceeding abundantly,\u201d \u201caccording to the riches\nof His glory,\u201d and \u201cthe working of His mighty power.\u201d Ephesians\n3:20, 16; 1:19.\nChapter 21\u2014Bethesda and the Sanhedrin [201]\nThis chapter is based on John 5.\n\u201cNow there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which\nis called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In\nthese lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered,\nwaiting for the moving of the water.\u201d\nAt certain seasons the waters of this pool were agitated, and\nit was commonly believed that this was the result of supernatural\npower, and that whoever first after the troubling of the pool stepped\ninto the waters, would be healed of whatever disease he had. Hun-\ndreds of sufferers visited the place; but so great was the crowd when\nthe water was troubled that they rushed forward, trampling underfoot\nmen, women, and children, weaker than themselves. Many could\nnot get near the pool. Many who had succeeded in reaching it died\nupon its brink. Shelters had been erected about the place, that the\nsick might be protected from the heat by day and the chilliness of\nthe night. There were some who spent the night in these porches,\ncreeping to the edge of the pool day after day, in the vain hope of\nrelief.\nJesus was again at Jerusalem. Walking alone, in apparent medita-\ntion and prayer, He came to the pool. He saw the wretched sufferers\nwatching for that which they supposed to be their only chance of\ncure. He longed to exercise His healing power, and make every\nsufferer whole. But it was the Sabbath day. Multitudes were going\nto the temple for worship, and He knew that such an act of healing [202]\nwould so excite the prejudice of the Jews as to cut short His work.\nBut the Saviour saw one case of supreme wretchedness. It was\nthat of a man who had been a helpless cripple for thirty-eight years.\nHis disease was in a great degree the result of his own sin, and was\nlooked upon as a judgment from God. Alone and friendless, feeling\nthat he was shut out from God\u2019s mercy, the sufferer had passed long\nyears of misery. At the time when it was expected that the waters\n161\n162 The Desire of Ages\nwould be troubled, those who pitied his helplessness would bear him\nto the porches. But at the favored moment he had no one to help\nhim in. He had seen the rippling of the water, but had never been\nable to get farther than the edge of the pool. Others stronger than\nhe would plunge in before him. He could not contend successfully\nwith the selfish, scrambling crowd. His persistent efforts toward the\none object, and his anxiety and continual disappointment, were fast\nwearing away the remnant of his strength.\nThe sick man was lying on his mat, and occasionally lifting\nhis head to gaze at the pool, when a tender, compassionate face\nbent over him, and the words, \u201cWilt thou be made whole?\u201d arrested\nhis attention. Hope came to his heart. He felt that in some way\nhe was to have help. But the glow of encouragement soon faded.\nHe remembered how often he had tried to reach the pool, and now\nhe had little prospect of living till it should again be troubled. He\nturned away wearily, saying, \u201cSir, I have no man, when the water is\ntroubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another\nsteppeth down before me.\u201d\nJesus does not ask this sufferer to exercise faith in Him. He\nsimply says, \u201cRise, take up thy bed, and walk.\u201d But the man\u2019s faith\ntakes hold upon that word. Every nerve and muscle thrills with[203]\nnew life, and healthful action comes to his crippled limbs. Without\nquestion he sets his will to obey the command of Christ, and all his\nmuscles respond to his will. Springing to his feet, he finds himself\nan active man.\nJesus had given him no assurance of divine help. The man might\nhave stopped to doubt, and lost his one chance of healing. But he\nbelieved Christ\u2019s word, and in acting upon it he received strength.\nThrough the same faith we may receive spiritual healing. By sin\nwe have been severed from the life of God. Our souls are palsied.\nOf ourselves we are no more capable of living a holy life than was\nthe impotent man capable of walking. There are many who realize\ntheir helplessness, and who long for that spiritual life which will\nbring them into harmony with God; they are vainly striving to obtain\nit. In despair they cry, \u201cO wretched man that I am! who shall deliver\nme from this body of death?\u201d Romans 7:24, margin. Let these\ndesponding, struggling ones look up. The Saviour is bending over\nthe purchase of His blood, saying with inexpressible tenderness and\nBethesda and the Sanhedrin 163\npity, \u201cWilt thou be made whole?\u201d He bids you arise in health and\npeace. Do not wait to feel that you are made whole. Believe His\nword, and it will be fulfilled. Put your will on the side of Christ. Will\nto serve Him, and in acting upon His word you will receive strength.\nWhatever may be the evil practice, the master passion which through\nlong indulgence binds both soul and body, Christ is able and longs\nto deliver. He will impart life to the soul that is \u201cdead in trespasses.\u201d\nEphesians 2:1. He will set free the captive that is held by weakness\nand misfortune and the chains of sin.\nThe restored paralytic stooped to take up his bed, which was\nonly a rug and a blanket, and as he straightened himself again with\na sense of delight, he looked around for his Deliverer; but Jesus was\nlost in the crowd. The man feared that he would not know Him if\nhe should see Him again. As he hurried on his way with firm, free\nstep, praising God and rejoicing in his new-found strength, he met\nseveral of the Pharisees, and immediately told them of his cure. He\nwas surprised at the coldness with which they listened to his story.\nWith lowering brows they interrupted him, asking why he was\ncarrying his bed on the Sabbath day. They sternly reminded him\nthat it was not lawful to bear burdens on the Lord\u2019s day. In his\njoy the man had forgotten that it was the Sabbath; yet he felt no\ncondemnation for obeying the command of One who had such power\nfrom God. He answered boldly, \u201cHe that made me whole, the same [204]\nsaid unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.\u201d They asked who it was\nthat had done this, but he could not tell. These rulers knew well that\nonly One had shown Himself able to perform this miracle; but they\nwished for direct proof that it was Jesus, that they might condemn\nHim as a Sabbath-breaker. In their judgment He had not only broken\nthe law in healing the sick man on the Sabbath, but had committed\nsacrilege in bidding him bear away his bed.\nThe Jews had so perverted the law that they made it a yoke of\nbondage. Their meaningless requirements had become a byword\namong other nations. Especially was the Sabbath hedged in by all\nmanner of senseless restrictions. It was not to them a delight, the\nholy of the Lord, and honorable. The scribes and Pharisees had\nmade its observance an intolerable burden. A Jew was not allowed\nto kindle a fire nor even to light a candle on the Sabbath. As a\nconsequence the people were dependent upon the Gentiles for many\n164 The Desire of Ages\nservices which their rules forbade them to do for themselves. They\ndid not reflect that if these acts were sinful, those who employed\nothers to perform them were as guilty as if they had done the work\nthemselves. They thought that salvation was restricted to the Jews,\nand that the condition of all others, being already hopeless, could\nbe made no worse. But God has given no commandments which\ncannot be obeyed by all. His laws sanction no unreasonable or selfish\nrestrictions.\nIn the temple Jesus met the man who had been healed. He had\ncome to bring a sin offering and also a thank offering for the great\nmercy he had received. Finding him among the worshipers, Jesus\nmade Himself known, with the warning words, \u201cBehold, thou art\nmade whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.\u201d\nThe healed man was overjoyed at meeting his Deliverer. Ignorant\nof the enmity toward Jesus, he told the Pharisees who had questioned\nhim, that this was He who had performed the cure. \u201cTherefore did\nthe Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay Him, because He had\ndone these things on the Sabbath day.\u201d\nJesus was brought before the Sanhedrin to answer the charge of\nSabbathbreaking. Had the Jews at this time been an independent\nnation, such a charge would have served their purpose for putting\nHim to death. This their subjection to the Romans prevented. The\nJews had not the power to inflict capital punishment, and the accu-\nsations brought against Christ would have no weight in a Roman[205]\ncourt. There were other objects, however, which they hoped to se-\ncure. Notwithstanding their efforts to counteract His work, Christ\nwas gaining, even in Jerusalem, an influence over the people greater\nthan their own. Multitudes who were not interested in the harangues\nof the rabbis were attracted by His teaching. They could understand\nHis words, and their hearts were warmed and comforted. He spoke\nof God, not as an avenging judge, but as a tender father, and He\nrevealed the image of God as mirrored in Himself. His words were\nlike balm to the wounded spirit. Both by His words and by His\nworks of mercy He was breaking the oppressive power of the old\ntraditions and man-made commandments, and presenting the love\nof God in its exhaustless fullness.\nIn one of the earliest prophecies of Christ it is written, \u201cThe\nscepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between\nBethesda and the Sanhedrin 165\nhis feet, until Shiloh come; and unto Him shall the gathering of the\npeople be.\u201d Genesis 49:10. The people were gathering to Christ.\nThe sympathetic hearts of the multitude accepted lessons of love\nand benevolence in preference to the rigid ceremonies required by\nthe priests. If the priests and rabbis had not interposed, His teaching\nwould have wrought such a reformation as this world has never\nwitnessed. But in order to maintain their own power, these leaders\ndetermined to break down the influence of Jesus. His arraignment\nbefore the Sanhedrin, and an open condemnation of His teachings,\nwould aid in effecting this; for the people still had great reverence\nfor their religious leaders. Whoever dared to condemn the rabbinical\nrequirements, or attempt to lighten the burdens they had brought\nupon the people, was regarded as guilty, not only of blasphemy, but\nof treason. On this ground the rabbis hoped to excite suspicion of\nChrist. They represented Him as trying to overthrow the established\ncustoms, thus causing division among the people, and preparing the\nway for complete subjugation by the Romans.\nBut the plans which these rabbis were working so zealously to\nfulfill originated in another council than that of the Sanhedrin. After\nSatan had failed to overcome Christ in the wilderness, he combined\nhis forces to oppose Him in His ministry, and if possible to thwart His\nwork. What he could not accomplish by direct, personal effort, he\ndetermined to effect by strategy. No sooner had he withdrawn from\nthe conflict in the wilderness than in council with his confederate\nangels he matured his plans for still further blinding the minds of\nthe Jewish people, that they might not recognize their Redeemer. He [206]\nplanned to work through his human agencies in the religious world,\nby imbuing them with his own enmity against the champion of truth.\nHe would lead them to reject Christ and to make His life as bitter as\npossible, hoping to discourage Him in His mission. And the leaders\nin Israel became instruments of Satan in warring against the Saviour.\nJesus had come to \u201cmagnify the law, and make it honorable.\u201d\nHe was not to lessen its dignity, but to exalt it. The scripture says,\n\u201cHe shall not fail nor be discouraged, till He have set judgment in\nthe earth.\u201d Isaiah 42:21, 4. He had come to free the Sabbath from\nthose burdensome requirements that had made it a curse instead of a\nblessing.\n166 The Desire of Ages\nFor this reason He had chosen the Sabbath upon which to per-\nform the act of healing at Bethesda. He could have healed the sick\nman as well on any other day of the week; or He might simply have\ncured him, without bidding him bear away his bed. But this would\nnot have given Him the opportunity He desired. A wise purpose\nunderlay every act of Christ\u2019s life on earth. Everything He did was\nimportant in itself and in its teaching. Among the afflicted ones at the\npool He selected the worst case upon whom to exercise His healing\npower, and bade the man carry his bed through the city in order to\npublish the great work that had been wrought upon him. This would\nraise the question of what it was lawful to do on the Sabbath, and\nwould open the way for Him to denounce the restrictions of the Jews\nin regard to the Lord\u2019s day, and to declare their traditions void.\nJesus stated to them that the work of relieving the afflicted was\nin harmony with the Sabbath law. It was in harmony with the work\nof God\u2019s angels, who are ever descending and ascending between\nheaven and earth to minister to suffering humanity. Jesus declared,\n\u201cMy Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\u201d All days are God\u2019s, in\nwhich to carry out His plans for the human race. If the Jews\u2019 inter-\npretation of the law was correct, then Jehovah was at fault, whose\nwork has quickened and upheld every living thing since first He laid\nthe foundations of the earth; then He who pronounced His work\ngood, and instituted the Sabbath to commemorate its completion,\nmust put a period to His labor, and stop the never-ending routine of\nthe universe.\nShould God forbid the sun to perform its office upon the Sab-\nbath, cut off its genial rays from warming the earth and nourishing\nvegetation? Must the system of worlds stand still through that holy\nday? Should He command the brooks to stay from watering the[207]\nfields and forests, and bid the waves of the sea still their ceaseless\nebbing and flowing? Must the wheat and corn stop growing, and the\nripening cluster defer its purple bloom? Must the trees and flowers\nput forth no bud nor blossom on the Sabbath?\nIn such a case, men would miss the fruits of the earth, and\nthe blessings that make life desirable. Nature must continue her\nunvarying course. God could not for a moment stay His hand, or\nman would faint and die. And man also has a work to perform on\nthis day. The necessities of life must be attended to, the sick must\nBethesda and the Sanhedrin 167\nbe cared for, the wants of the needy must be supplied. He will not\nbe held guiltless who neglects to relieve suffering on the Sabbath.\nGod\u2019s holy rest day was made for man, and acts of mercy are in\nperfect harmony with its intent. God does not desire His creatures to\nsuffer an hour\u2019s pain that may be relieved upon the Sabbath or any\nother day.\nThe demands upon God are even greater upon the Sabbath than\nupon other days. His people then leave their usual employment, and\nspend the time in meditation and worship. They ask more favors of\nHim on the Sabbath than upon other days. They demand His special\nattention. They crave His choicest blessings. God does not wait\nfor the Sabbath to pass before He grants these requests. Heaven\u2019s\nwork never ceases, and men should never rest from doing good.\nThe Sabbath is not intended to be a period of useless inactivity.\nThe law forbids secular labor on the rest day of the Lord; the toil\nthat gains a livelihood must cease; no labor for worldly pleasure\nor profit is lawful upon that day; but as God ceased His labor of\ncreating, and rested upon the Sabbath and blessed it, so man is to\nleave the occupations of his daily life, and devote those sacred hours\nto healthful rest, to worship, and to holy deeds. The work of Christ\nin healing the sick was in perfect accord with the law. It honored the\nSabbath.\nJesus claimed equal rights with God in doing a work equally\nsacred, and of the same character with that which engaged the Father\nin heaven. But the Pharisees were still more incensed. He had not\nonly broken the law, according to their understanding, but in calling\nGod \u201cHis own Father\u201d had declared Himself equal with God.

      "text": "The whole nation of the Jews called God their Father, therefore\nthey would not have been so enraged if Christ had represented Him-\nself as standing in the same relation to God. But they accused Him\nof blasphemy, showing that they understood Him as making this [208]\nclaim in the highest sense.\nThese adversaries of Christ had no arguments with which to meet\nthe truths He brought home to their consciences. They could only\ncite their customs and traditions, and these seemed weak and vapid\nwhen compared with the arguments Jesus had drawn from the word\nof God and the unceasing round of nature. Had the rabbis felt any\n168 The Desire of Ages\ndesire to receive light, they would have been convinced that Jesus\nspoke the truth. But they evaded the points He made concerning the\nSabbath, and sought to stir up anger against Him because He claimed\nto be equal with God. The fury of the rulers knew no bounds. Had\nthey not feared the people, the priests and rabbis would have slain\nJesus on the spot. But the popular sentiment in His favor was strong.\nMany recognized in Jesus the friend who had healed their diseases\nand comforted their sorrows, and they justified His healing of the\nsufferer at Bethesda. So for the time the leaders were obliged to\nrestrain their hatred.\nJesus repelled the charge of blasphemy. My authority, He said,\nfor doing the work of which you accuse Me, is that I am the Son\nof God, one with Him in nature, in will, and in purpose. In all His\nworks of creation and providence, I co-operate with God. \u201cThe\nSon can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do.\u201d\nThe priests and rabbis were taking the Son of God to task for the\nvery work He had been sent into the world to do. By their sins\nthey had separated themselves from God, and in their pride were\nmoving independently of Him. They felt sufficient in themselves for\nall things, and realized no need of a higher wisdom to direct their\nacts. But the Son of God was surrendered to the Father\u2019s will, and\ndependent upon His power. So utterly was Christ emptied of self\nthat He made no plans for Himself. He accepted God\u2019s plans for\nHim, and day by day the Father unfolded His plans. So should we\ndepend upon God, that our lives may be the simple outworking of\nHis will.\nWhen Moses was about to build the sanctuary as a dwelling\nplace for God, he was directed to make all things according to the\npattern shown him in the mount. Moses was full of zeal to do God\u2019s\nwork; the most talented, skillful men were at hand to carry out his\nsuggestions. Yet he was not to make a bell, a pomegranate, a tassel,\na fringe, a curtain, or any vessel of the sanctuary, except according\nto the pattern shown him. God called him into the mount, and\nrevealed to him the heavenly things. The Lord covered him with\nHis own glory, that he might see the pattern, and according to it[209]\nall things were made. So to Israel, whom He desired to make His\ndwelling place, He had revealed His glorious ideal of character. The\npattern was shown them in the mount when the law was given from\nBethesda and the Sanhedrin 169\nSinai, and when the Lord passed by before Moses and proclaimed,\n\u201cThe Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering,\nand abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands,\nforgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.\u201d Exodus 34:6, 7.\nIsrael had chosen their own ways. They had not builded accord-\ning to the pattern; but Christ, the true temple for God\u2019s indwelling,\nmolded every detail of His earthly life in harmony with God\u2019s ideal.\nHe said, \u201cI delight to do Thy will, O My God: yea, Thy law is within\nMy heart.\u201d Psalm 40:8. So our characters are to be builded \u201cfor\nan habitation of God through the Spirit.\u201d Ephesians 2:22. And we\nare to \u201cmake all things according to the pattern,\u201d even Him who\n\u201csuffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow His\nsteps.\u201d Hebrews 8:5; 1 Peter 2:21.\nThe words of Christ teach that we should regard ourselves as\ninseparably bound to our Father in heaven. Whatever our position,\nwe are dependent upon God, who holds all destinies in His hands.\nHe has appointed us our work, and has endowed us with faculties\nand means for that work. So long as we surrender the will to God,\nand trust in His strength and wisdom, we shall be guided in safe\npaths, to fulfill our appointed part in His great plan. But the one\nwho depends upon his own wisdom and power is separating himself\nfrom God. Instead of working in unison with Christ, he is fulfilling\nthe purpose of the enemy of God and man.\nThe Saviour continued: \u201cWhat things soever He [the Father]\ndoeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.... As the Father raiseth up\nthe dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom\nHe will.\u201d The Sadducees held that there would be no resurrection of\nthe body; but Jesus tells them that one of the greatest works of His\nFather is raising the dead, and that He Himself has power to do the\nsame work. \u201cThe hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall\nhear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.\u201d The\nPharisees believed in the resurrection of the dead. Christ declares\nthat even now the power which gives life to the dead is among them,\nand they are to behold its manifestation. This same resurrection\npower is that which gives life to the soul \u201cdead in trespasses and\nsins.\u201d Ephesians 2:1. That spirit of life in Christ Jesus, \u201cthe power\nof His resurrection,\u201d sets men \u201cfree from the law of sin and death.\u201d [210]\nPhilippians 3:10; Romans 8:2. The dominion of evil is broken, and\n170 The Desire of Ages\nthrough faith the soul is kept from sin. He who opens his heart to\nthe Spirit of Christ becomes a partaker of that mighty power which\nshall bring forth his body from the grave.\nThe humble Nazarene asserts His real nobility. He rises above\nhumanity, throws off the guise of sin and shame, and stands revealed,\nthe Honored of the angels, the Son of God, One with the Creator\nof the universe. His hearers are spellbound. No man has ever\nspoken words like His, or borne himself with such a kingly majesty.\nHis utterances are clear and plain, fully declaring His mission, and\nthe duty of the world. \u201cFor the Father judgeth no man, but hath\ncommitted all judgment unto the Son: that all men should honor the\nSon, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son\nhonoreth not the Father which hath sent Him.... For as the Father\nhath life in Himself; so hath He given to the Son to have life in\nHimself; and hath given Him authority to execute judgment also,\nbecause He is the Son of man.\u201d\nThe priests and rulers had set themselves up as judges to con-\ndemn Christ\u2019s work, but He declared Himself their judge, and the\njudge of all the earth. The world has been committed to Christ, and\nthrough Him has come every blessing from God to the fallen race.\nHe was the Redeemer before as after His incarnation. As soon as\nthere was sin, there was a Saviour. He has given light and life to all,\nand according to the measure of light given, each is to be judged.\nAnd He who has given the light, He who has followed the soul with\ntenderest entreaty, seeking to win it from sin to holiness, is in one\nits advocate and judge. From the opening of the great controversy\nin heaven, Satan has maintained his cause through deception; and\nChrist has been working to unveil his schemes and to break his\npower. It is He who has encountered the deceiver, and who through\nall the ages has been seeking to wrest the captives from his grasp,\nwho will pass judgment upon every soul.\nAnd God \u201chath given Him authority to execute judgment also,\nbecause He is the Son of man.\u201d Because He has tasted the very dregs\nof human affliction and temptation, and understands the frailties and\nsins of men; because in our behalf He has victoriously withstood the\ntemptations of Satan, and will deal justly and tenderly with the souls\nthat His own blood has been poured out to save,\u2014because of this,\nthe Son of man is appointed to execute the judgment.\nBethesda and the Sanhedrin 171\nBut Christ\u2019s mission was not for judgment, but for salvation.\n\u201cGod sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world; but that\nthe world through Him might be saved.\u201d John 3:17. And before the [211]\nSanhedrin Jesus declared, \u201cHe that heareth My word, and believeth\nHim that sent Me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment,\nbut hath passed out of death into life.\u201d John 5:24, R. V .\nBidding His hearers marvel not, Christ opened before them, in\nstill wider view, the mystery of the future. \u201cThe hour cometh,\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cin which all that are in the tombs shall hear His voice, and\nshall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of\nlife; and they that have done ill, unto the resurrection of judgment.\u201d\nJohn 5:28, 29, R. V .\nThis assurance of the future life was that for which Israel had so\nlong waited, and which they had hoped to receive at the Messiah\u2019s\nadvent. The only light that can lighten the gloom of the grave was\nshining upon them. But self-will is blind. Jesus had violated the\ntraditions of the rabbis, and disregarded their authority, and they\nwould not believe.\nThe time, the place, the occasion, the intensity of feeling that\npervaded the assembly, all combined to make the words of Jesus\nbefore the Sanhedrin the more impressive. The highest religious\nauthorities of the nation were seeking the life of Him who declared\nHimself the restorer of Israel. The Lord of the Sabbath was arraigned\nbefore an earthly tribunal to answer the charge of breaking the\nSabbath law. When He so fearlessly declared His mission, His\njudges looked upon Him with astonishment and rage; but His words\nwere unanswerable. They could not condemn Him. He denied the\nright of the priests and rabbis to question Him, or to interfere with\nHis work. They were invested with no such authority. Their claims\nwere based upon their own pride and arrogance. He refused to plead\nguilty of their charges, or to be catechized by them.\nInstead of apologizing for the act of which they complained, or\nexplaining His purpose in doing it, Jesus turned upon the rulers, and\nthe accused became the accuser. He rebuked them for the hardness\nof their hearts, and their ignorance of the Scriptures. He declared that\nthey had rejected the word of God, inasmuch as they had rejected\nHim whom God had sent. \u201cYe search the Scriptures, because ye\n172 The Desire of Ages\nthink that in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear\nwitness of Me.\u201d John 5:39, R. V .\nIn every page, whether history, or precept, or prophecy, the Old\nTestament Scriptures are irradiated with the glory of the Son of God.\nSo far as it was of divine institution, the entire system of Judaism\nwas a compacted prophecy of the gospel. To Christ \u201cgive all the\nprophets witness.\u201d Acts 10:43. From the promise given to Adam,\ndown through the patriarchal line and the legal economy, heaven\u2019s[212]\nglorious light made plain the footsteps of the Redeemer. Seers beheld\nthe Star of Bethlehem, the Shiloh to come, as future things swept\nbefore them in mysterious procession. In every sacrifice Christ\u2019s\ndeath was shown. In every cloud of incense His righteousness\nascended. By every jubilee trumpet His name was sounded. In the\nawful mystery of the holy of holies His glory dwelt.\nThe Jews had the Scriptures in their possession, and supposed\nthat in their mere outward knowledge of the word they had eternal\nlife. But Jesus said, \u201cYe have not His word abiding in you.\u201d Having\nrejected Christ in His word, they rejected Him in person. \u201cYe will\nnot come to Me,\u201d He said, \u201cthat ye might have life.\u201d\nThe Jewish leaders had studied the teachings of the prophets\nconcerning the kingdom of the Messiah; but they had done this,\nnot with a sincere desire to know the truth, but with the purpose\nof finding evidence to sustain their ambitious hopes. When Christ\ncame in a manner contrary to their expectations, they would not\nreceive Him; and in order to justify themselves, they tried to prove\nHim a deceiver. When once they had set their feet in this path, it\nwas easy for Satan to strengthen their opposition to Christ. The very\nwords that should have been received as evidence of His divinity\nwere interpreted against Him. Thus they turned the truth of God into\na lie, and the more directly the Saviour spoke to them in His works\nof mercy, the more determined they were in resisting the light.\nJesus said, \u201cI receive not honor from men.\u201d It was not the influ-\nence of the Sanhedrin, it was not their sanction He desired. He could\nreceive no honor from their approbation. He was invested with the\nhonor and authority of Heaven. Had He desired it, angels would\nhave come to do Him homage; the Father would again have testified\nto His divinity. But for their own sake, for the sake of the nation\nBethesda and the Sanhedrin 173\nwhose leaders they were, He desired the Jewish rulers to discern His\ncharacter, and receive the blessings He came to bring them.\n\u201cI am come in My Father\u2019s name, and ye receive Me not: if\nanother shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.\u201d Jesus\ncame by the authority of God, bearing His image, fulfilling His\nword, and seeking His glory; yet He was not accepted by the leaders\nin Israel; but when others should come, assuming the character of\nChrist, but actuated by their own will and seeking their own glory,\nthey would be received. And why? Because he who is seeking\nhis own glory appeals to the desire for self-exaltation in others.\nTo such appeals the Jews could respond. They would receive the [213]\nfalse teacher because he flattered their pride by sanctioning their\ncherished opinions and traditions. But the teaching of Christ did\nnot coincide with their ideas. It was spiritual, and demanded the\nsacrifice of self; therefore they would not receive it. They were not\nacquainted with God, and to them His voice through Christ was the\nvoice of a stranger.\nIs not the same thing repeated in our day? Are there not many,\neven religious leaders, who are hardening their hearts against the\nHoly Spirit, making it impossible for them to recognize the voice of\nGod? Are they not rejecting the word of God, that they may keep\ntheir own traditions?\n\u201cHad ye believed Moses,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cye would have believed\nMe: for he wrote of Me. But if ye believe not his writings, how\nshall ye believe My words?\u201d It was Christ who had spoken to Israel\nthrough Moses. If they had listened to the divine voice that spoke\nthrough their great leader, they would have recognized it in the\nteachings of Christ. Had they believed Moses, they would have\nbelieved Him of whom Moses wrote.\nJesus knew that the priests and rabbis were determined to take\nHis life; yet He clearly explained to them His unity with the Fa-\nther, and His relation to the world. They saw that their opposition\nto Him was without excuse, yet their murderous hatred was not\nquenched. Fear seized them as they witnessed the convincing power\nthat attended His ministry; but they resisted His appeals, and locked\nthemselves in darkness.\nThey had signally failed to subvert the authority of Jesus or to\nalienate the respect and attention of the people, many of whom\n174 The Desire of Ages\nwere convicted by His words. The rulers themselves had felt deep\ncondemnation as He had pressed their guilt home upon their con-\nsciences; yet this only made them the more bitter against Him. They\nwere determined to take His life. They sent messengers all over the\ncountry to warn the people against Jesus as an impostor. Spies were\nsent to watch Him, and report what He said and did. The precious\nSaviour was now most surely standing under the shadow of the cross.\nChapter 22\u2014Imprisonment and Death of John [214]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 11:1-11; Matthew 14:1-11; Mark\n6:17-28; Luke 7:19-28.\nJohn the Baptist had been first in heralding Christ\u2019s kingdom,\nand he was first also in suffering. From the free air of the wilderness\nand the vast throngs that had hung upon his words, he was now shut\nin by the walls of a dungeon cell. He had become a prisoner in the\nfortress of Herod Antipas. In the territory east of Jordan, which was\nunder the dominion of Antipas, much of John\u2019s ministry had been\nspent. Herod himself had listened to the preaching of the Baptist.\nThe dissolute king had trembled under the call to repentance. \u201cHerod\nfeared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy; ... and\nwhen he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.\u201d John\ndealt with him faithfully, denouncing his iniquitous alliance with\nHerodias, his brother\u2019s wife. For a time Herod feebly sought to\nbreak the chain of lust that bound him; but Herodias fastened him\nthe more firmly in her toils, and found revenge upon the Baptist by\ninducing Herod to cast him into prison.\nThe life of John had been one of active labor, and the gloom and\ninaction of his prison life weighed heavily upon him. As week after\nweek passed, bringing no change, despondency and doubt crept over\nhim. His disciples did not forsake him. They were allowed access to\nthe prison, and they brought him tidings of the works of Jesus, and\ntold how the people were flocking to Him. But they questioned why,\nif this new teacher was the Messiah, He did nothing to effect John\u2019s [215]\nrelease. How could He permit His faithful herald to be deprived of\nliberty and perhaps of life?\nThese questions were not without effect. Doubts which otherwise\nwould never have arisen were suggested to John. Satan rejoiced to\nhear the words of these disciples, and to see how they bruised the soul\nof the Lord\u2019s messenger. Oh, how often those who think themselves\nthe friends of a good man, and who are eager to show their fidelity\n175\n176 The Desire of Ages\nto him, prove to be his most dangerous enemies! How often, instead\nof strengthening his faith, their words depress and dishearten!\nLike the Saviour\u2019s disciples, John the Baptist did not understand\nthe nature of Christ\u2019s kingdom. He expected Jesus to take the throne\nof David; and as time passed, and the Saviour made no claim to\nkingly authority, John became perplexed and troubled. He had\ndeclared to the people that in order for the way to be prepared before\nthe Lord, the prophecy of Isaiah must be fulfilled; the mountains\nand hills must be brought low, the crooked made straight, and the\nrough places plain. He had looked for the high places of human\npride and power to be cast down. He had pointed to the Messiah\nas the One whose fan was in His hand, and who would thoroughly\npurge His floor, who would gather the wheat into His garner, and\nburn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. Like the prophet Elijah,\nin whose spirit and power he had come to Israel, he looked for the\nLord to reveal Himself as a God that answereth by fire.\nIn his mission the Baptist had stood as a fearless reprover of\niniquity, both in high places and in low. He had dared to face King\nHerod with the plain rebuke of sin. He had not counted his life dear\nunto himself, that he might fulfill his appointed work. And now from\nhis dungeon he watched for the Lion of the tribe of Judah to cast\ndown the pride of the oppressor, and to deliver the poor and him that\ncried. But Jesus seemed to content Himself with gathering disciples\nabout Him, and healing and teaching the people. He was eating at\nthe tables of the publicans, while every day the Roman yoke rested\nmore heavily upon Israel, while King Herod and his vile paramour\nworked their will, and the cries of the poor and suffering went up to\nheaven.\nTo the desert prophet all this seemed a mystery beyond his fath-[216]\noming. There were hours when the whisperings of demons tortured\nhis spirit, and the shadow of a terrible fear crept over him. Could\nit be that the long-hoped-for Deliverer had not yet appeared? Then\nwhat meant the message that he himself had been impelled to bear?\nJohn had been bitterly disappointed in the result of his mission. He\nhad expected that the message from God would have the same effect\nas when the law was read in the days of Josiah and of Ezra (2 Chron-\nicles 34; Nehemiah 8, 9); that there would follow a deep-seated work\nImprisonment and Death of John 177\nof repentance and returning unto the Lord. For the success of this\nmission his whole life had been sacrificed. Had it been in vain?\nJohn was troubled to see that through love for him, his own\ndisciples were cherishing unbelief in regard to Jesus. Had his work\nfor them been fruitless? Had he been unfaithful in his mission,\nthat he was now cut off from labor? If the promised Deliverer had\nappeared, and John had been found true to his calling, would not\nJesus now overthrow the oppressor\u2019s power, and set free His herald?\nBut the Baptist did not surrender his faith in Christ. The memory\nof the voice from heaven and the descending dove, the spotless\npurity of Jesus, the power of the Holy Spirit that had rested upon\nJohn as he came into the Saviour\u2019s presence, and the testimony of\nthe prophetic scriptures,\u2014all witnessed that Jesus of Nazareth was\nthe Promised One.\nJohn would not discuss his doubts and anxieties with his com-\npanions. He determined to send a message of inquiry to Jesus. This\nhe entrusted to two of his disciples, hoping that an interview with\nthe Saviour would confirm their faith, and bring assurance to their\nbrethren. And he longed for some word from Christ spoken directly\nfor himself.\nThe disciples came to Jesus with their message, \u201cArt Thou He\nthat should come, or do we look for another?\u201d\nHow short the time since the Baptist had pointed to Jesus, and\nproclaimed, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin\nof the world.\u201d \u201cHe it is, who coming after me is preferred before\nme.\u201d John 1:29, 27. And now the question, \u201cArt Thou He that should\ncome?\u201d It was keenly bitter and disappointing to human nature. If\nJohn, the faithful forerunner, failed to discern Christ\u2019s mission, what\ncould be expected from the self-seeking multitude?\nThe Saviour did not at once answer the disciples\u2019 question. As\nthey stood wondering at His silence, the sick and afflicted were\ncoming to Him to be healed. The blind were groping their way\nthrough the crowd; diseased ones of all classes, some urging their [217]\nown way, some borne by their friends, were eagerly pressing into\nthe presence of Jesus. The voice of the mighty Healer penetrated\nthe deaf ear. A word, a touch of His hand, opened the blind eyes to\nbehold the light of day, the scenes of nature, the faces of friends, and\nthe face of the Deliverer. Jesus rebuked disease and banished fever.\n178 The Desire of Ages\nHis voice reached the ears of the dying, and they arose in health\nand vigor. Paralyzed demoniacs obeyed His word, their madness\nleft them, and they worshiped Him. While He healed their diseases,\nHe taught the people. The poor peasants and laborers, who were\nshunned by the rabbis as unclean, gathered close about Him, and He\nspoke to them the words of eternal life.\nThus the day wore away, the disciples of John seeing and hearing\nall. At last Jesus called them to Him, and bade them go and tell\nJohn what they had witnessed, adding, \u201cBlessed is he, whosoever\nshall find none occasion of stumbling in Me.\u201d Luke 7:23, R. V . The\nevidence of His divinity was seen in its adaptation to the needs of\nsuffering humanity. His glory was shown in His condescension to\nour low estate.\nThe disciples bore the message, and it was enough. John recalled\nthe prophecy concerning the Messiah, \u201cThe Lord hath anointed Me\nto preach good tidings unto the meek; He hath sent Me to bind up the\nbrokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening\nof the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year\nof the Lord.\u201d Isaiah 61:1, 2. The works of Christ not only declared\nHim to be the Messiah, but showed in what manner His kingdom\nwas to be established. To John was opened the same truth that had\ncome to Elijah in the desert, when \u201ca great and strong wind rent the\nmountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the\nLord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the\nLord was not in the earthquake: and after the earthquake a fire; but\nthe Lord was not in the fire:\u201d and after the fire, God spoke to the\nprophet by \u201ca still small voice.\u201d 1 Kings 19:11, 12. So Jesus was\nto do His work, not with the clash of arms and the overturning of\nthrones and kingdoms, but through speaking to the hearts of men by\na life of mercy and self-sacrifice.\nThe principle of the Baptist\u2019s own life of self-abnegation was the[218]\nprinciple of the Messiah\u2019s kingdom. John well knew how foreign\nall this was to the principles and hopes of the leaders in Israel. That\nwhich was to him convincing evidence of Christ\u2019s divinity would\nbe no evidence to them. They were looking for a Messiah who had\nnot been promised. John saw that the Saviour\u2019s mission could win\nfrom them only hatred and condemnation. He, the forerunner, was\nbut drinking of the cup which Christ Himself must drain to its dregs.\nImprisonment and Death of John 179\nThe Saviour\u2019s words, \u201cBlessed is he, whosoever shall find none\noccasion of stumbling in Me,\u201d were a gentle reproof to John. It was\nnot lost upon him. Understanding more clearly now the nature of\nChrist\u2019s mission, he yielded himself to God for life or for death, as\nshould best serve the interests of the cause he loved.\nAfter the messengers had departed, Jesus spoke to the people\nconcerning John. The Saviour\u2019s heart went out in sympathy to the\nfaithful witness now buried in Herod\u2019s dungeon. He would not leave\nthe people to conclude that God had forsaken John, or that his faith\nhad failed in the day of trial. \u201cWhat went ye out into the wilderness\nto see?\u201d He said. \u201cA reed shaken with the wind?\u201d\nThe tall reeds that grew beside the Jordan, bending before every\nbreeze, were fitting representatives of the rabbis who had stood\nas critics and judges of the Baptist\u2019s mission. They were swayed\nthis way and that by the winds of popular opinion. They would\nnot humble themselves to receive the heart-searching message of\nthe Baptist, yet for fear of the people they dared not openly oppose\nhis work. But God\u2019s messenger was of no such craven spirit. The\nmultitudes who were gathered about Christ had been witnesses to\nthe work of John. They had heard his fearless rebuke of sin. To the\nself-righteous Pharisees, the priestly Sadducees, King Herod and\nhis court, princes and soldiers, publicans and peasants, John had\nspoken with equal plainness. He was no trembling reed, swayed by\nthe winds of human praise or prejudice. In the prison he was the\nsame in his loyalty to God and his zeal for righteousness as when\nhe preached God\u2019s message in the wilderness. In his faithfulness to\nprinciple he was as firm as a rock.\nJesus continued, \u201cBut what went ye out for to see? A man clothed\nin soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously appareled, and\nlive delicately, are in kings\u2019 courts.\u201d John had been called to reprove\nthe sins and excesses of his time, and his plain dress and self-denying\nlife were in harmony with the character of his mission. Rich apparel [219]\nand the luxuries of this life are not the portion of God\u2019s servants,\nbut of those who live \u201cin kings\u2019 courts,\u201d the rulers of this world,\nto whom pertain its power and its riches. Jesus wished to direct\nattention to the contrast between the clothing of John, and that worn\nby the priests and rulers. These officials arrayed themselves in rich\nrobes and costly ornaments. They loved display, and hoped to dazzle\n180 The Desire of Ages\nthe people, and thus command greater consideration. They were\nmore anxious to gain the admiration of men than to obtain the purity\nof heart which would win the approval of God. Thus they revealed\nthat their allegiance was not given to God, but to the kingdom of this\nworld.\n\u201cBut what,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cwent ye out for to see? A prophet? yea,\nI say unto you, and more than a prophet. For this is he, of whom it\nis written,\u2014\n\u201cBehold, I send My messenger before Thy face,\nWhich shall prepare Thy way before Thee.\n\u201cVerily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there\nhath not risen a greater than John the Baptist.\u201d In the announcement\nto Zacharias before the birth of John, the angel had declared, \u201cHe\nshall be great in the sight of the Lord.\u201d Luke 1:15. In the estimation\nof Heaven, what is it that constitutes greatness? Not that which the\nworld accounts greatness; not wealth, or rank, or noble descent, or\nintellectual gifts, in themselves considered. If intellectual greatness,\napart from any higher consideration, is worthy of honor, then our\nhomage is due to Satan, whose intellectual power no man has ever\nequaled. But when perverted to self-serving, the greater the gift, the\ngreater curse it becomes. It is moral worth that God values. Love\nand purity are the attributes He prizes most. John was great in the\nsight of the Lord, when, before the messengers from the Sanhedrin,\nbefore the people, and before his own disciples, he refrained from\nseeking honor for himself, but pointed all to Jesus as the Promised\nOne. His unselfish joy in the ministry of Christ presents the highest\ntype of nobility ever revealed in man.\nThe witness borne of him after his death, by those who had heard\nhis testimony to Jesus, was, \u201cJohn did no miracle: but all things that\nJohn spake of this Man were true.\u201d John 10:41. It was not given to\nJohn to call down fire from heaven, or to raise the dead, as Elijah\ndid, nor to wield Moses\u2019 rod of power in the name of God. He was[220]\nsent to herald the Saviour\u2019s advent, and to call upon the people to\nprepare for His coming. So faithfully did he fulfill his mission, that\nas the people recalled what he had taught them of Jesus, they could\nImprisonment and Death of John 181\nsay, \u201cAll things that John spake of this Man were true.\u201d Such witness\nto Christ every disciple of the Master is called upon to bear.\nAs the Messiah\u2019s herald, John was \u201cmuch more than a prophet.\u201d\nFor while prophets had seen from afar Christ\u2019s advent, to John it\nwas given to behold Him, to hear the testimony from heaven to His\nMessiahship, and to present Him to Israel as the Sent of God. Yet\nJesus said, \u201cHe that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than\nhe.\u201d\nThe prophet John was the connecting link between the two dis-\npensations. As God\u2019s representative he stood forth to show the\nrelation of the law and the prophets to the Christian dispensation.\nHe was the lesser light, which was to be followed by a greater. The\nmind of John was illuminated by the Holy Spirit, that he might shed\nlight upon his people; but no other light ever has shone or ever will\nshine so clearly upon fallen man as that which emanated from the\nteaching and example of Jesus. Christ and His mission had been but\ndimly understood as typified in the shadowy sacrifices. Even John\nhad not fully comprehended the future, immortal life through the\nSaviour.\nAside from the joy that John found in his mission, his life had\nbeen one of sorrow. His voice had been seldom heard except in\nthe wilderness. His was a lonely lot. And he was not permitted to\nsee the result of his own labors. It was not his privilege to be with\nChrist and witness the manifestation of divine power attending the\ngreater light. It was not for him to see the blind restored to sight, the\nsick healed, and the dead raised to life. He did not behold the light\nthat shone through every word of Christ, shedding glory upon the\npromises of prophecy. The least disciple who saw Christ\u2019s mighty\nworks and heard His words was in this sense more highly privileged\nthan John the Baptist, and therefore is said to have been greater than\nhe.\nThrough the vast throngs that had listened to John\u2019s preaching,\nhis fame had spread throughout the land. A deep interest was felt\nas to the result of his imprisonment. Yet his blameless life, and the\nstrong public sentiment in his favor, led to the belief that no violent\nmeasures would be taken against him.\nHerod believed John to be a prophet of God, and he fully in-\ntended to set him at liberty. But he delayed his purpose from fear of [221]\n182 The Desire of Ages\nHerodias.\nHerodias knew that by direct measures she could never win\nHerod\u2019s consent to the death of John, and she resolved to accomplish\nher purpose by stratagem. On the king\u2019s birthday an entertainment\nwas to be given to the officers of state and the nobles of the court.\nThere would be feasting and drunkenness. Herod would thus be\nthrown off his guard, and might then be influenced according to her\nwill.\nWhen the great day arrived, and the king with his lords was\nfeasting and drinking, Herodias sent her daughter into the banqueting\nhall to dance for the entertainment of the guests. Salome was in the\nfirst flush of womanhood, and her voluptuous beauty captivated the\nsenses of the lordly revelers. It was not customary for the ladies of\nthe court to appear at these festivities, and a flattering compliment\nwas paid to Herod when this daughter of Israel\u2019s priests and princes\ndanced for the amusement of his guests.\nThe king was dazed with wine. Passion held sway, and reason\nwas dethroned. He saw only the hall of pleasure, with its reveling\nguests, the banquet table, the sparkling wine and the flashing lights,\nand the young girl dancing before him. In the recklessness of the\nmoment, he desired to make some display that would exalt him\nbefore the great men of his realm. With an oath he promised to give\nthe daughter of Herodias whatever she might ask, even to the half of\nhis kingdom.\nSalome hastened to her mother, to know what she should ask.\nThe answer was ready,\u2014the head of John the Baptist. Salome knew\nnot of the thirst for revenge in her mother\u2019s heart, and she shrank\nfrom presenting the request; but the determination of Herodias pre-\nvailed. The girl returned with the terrible petition, \u201cI will that thou\nforthwith give me in a charger the head of John the Baptist.\u201d Mark",

      "text": "Herod was astonished and confounded. The riotous mirth ceased,\nand an ominous silence settled down upon the scene of revelry. The\nking was horror-stricken at the thought of taking the life of John.\nYet his word was pledged, and he was unwilling to appear fickle or\nrash. The oath had been made in honor of his guests, and if one of\nthem had offered a word against the fulfillment of his promise, he\nwould gladly have spared the prophet. He gave them opportunity to\nImprisonment and Death of John 183\nspeak in the prisoner\u2019s behalf. They had traveled long distances in\norder to hear the preaching of John, and they knew him to be a man\nwithout crime, and a servant of God. But though shocked at the girl\u2019s\ndemand, they were too besotted to interpose a remonstrance. No [222]\nvoice was raised to save the life of Heaven\u2019s messenger. These men\noccupied high positions of trust in the nation, and upon them rested\ngrave responsibilities; yet they had given themselves up to feasting\nand drunkenness until the senses were benumbed. Their heads were\nturned with the giddy scene of music and dancing, and conscience\nlay dormant. By their silence they pronounced the sentence of death\nupon the prophet of God to satisfy the revenge of an abandoned\nwoman.\nHerod waited in vain to be released from his oath; then he reluc-\ntantly commanded the execution of the prophet. Soon the head of\nJohn was brought in before the king and his guests. Forever sealed\nwere those lips that had faithfully warned Herod to turn from his\nlife of sin. Never more would that voice be heard calling men to\nrepentance. The revels of one night had cost the life of one of the\ngreatest of the prophets.\nOh, how often has the life of the innocent been sacrificed through\nthe intemperance of those who should have been guardians of jus-\ntice! He who puts the intoxicating cup to his lips makes himself\nresponsible for all the injustice he may commit under its besotting\npower. By benumbing his senses he makes it impossible for him\nto judge calmly or to have a clear perception of right and wrong.\nHe opens the way for Satan to work through him in oppressing\nand destroying the innocent. \u201cWine is a mocker, strong drink is\nraging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.\u201d Proverbs\n20:1. Thus it is that \u201cjudgment is turned away backward, ... and\nhe that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey.\u201d Isaiah 59:14,\n15. Those who have jurisdiction over the lives of their fellow men\nshould be held guilty of a crime when they yield to intemperance.\nAll who execute the laws should be lawkeepers. They should be men\nof self-control. They need to have full command of their physical,\nmental, and moral powers, that they may possess vigor of intellect,\nand a high sense of justice.\nThe head of John the Baptist was carried to Herodias, who re-\nceived it with fiendish satisfaction. She exulted in her revenge, and\n184 The Desire of Ages\nflattered herself that Herod\u2019s conscience would no longer be trou-\nbled. But no happiness resulted to her from her sin. Her name\nbecame notorious and abhorred, while Herod was more tormented\nby remorse than he had been by the warnings of the prophet. The\ninfluence of John\u2019s teachings was not silenced; it was to extend to\nevery generation till the close of time.\nHerod\u2019s sin was ever before him. He was constantly seeking to[223]\nfind relief from the accusings of a guilty conscience. His confidence\nin John was unshaken. As he recalled his life of self-denial, his\nsolemn, earnest appeals, his sound judgment in counsel, and then\nremembered how he had come to his death, Herod could find no\nrest. Engaged in the affairs of the state, receiving honors from men,\nhe bore a smiling face and dignified mien, while he concealed an\nanxious heart, ever oppressed with the fear that a curse was upon\nhim.\nHerod had been deeply impressed by the words of John, that\nnothing can be hidden from God. He was convinced that God was\npresent in every place, that He had witnessed the revelry of the\nbanqueting room, that He had heard the command to behead John,\nand had seen the exultation of Herodias, and the insult she offered to\nthe severed head of her reprover. And many things that Herod had\nheard from the lips of the prophet now spoke to his conscience more\ndistinctly than had the preaching in the wilderness.\nWhen Herod heard of the works of Christ, he was exceedingly\ntroubled. He thought that God had raised John from the dead, and\nsent him forth with still greater power to condemn sin. He was in\nconstant fear that John would avenge his death by passing condem-\nnation upon him and his house. Herod was reaping that which God\nhad declared to be the result of a course of sin,\u2014\u201ca trembling heart,\nand failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind: and thy life shall hang in\ndoubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have\nnone assurance of thy life: in the morning thou shalt say, Would God\nit were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning!\nfor the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight\nof thine eyes which thou shalt see.\u201d Deuteronomy 28:65-67. The\nsinner\u2019s own thoughts are his accusers; and there can be no torture\nkeener than the stings of a guilty conscience, which give him no rest\nday nor night.\nImprisonment and Death of John 185\nTo many minds a deep mystery surrounds the fate of John the\nBaptist. They question why he should have been left to languish and\ndie in prison. The mystery of this dark providence our human vision\ncannot penetrate; but it can never shake our confidence in God when\nwe remember that John was but a sharer in the sufferings of Christ.\nAll who follow Christ will wear the crown of sacrifice. They will\nsurely be misunderstood by selfish men, and will be made a mark\nfor the fierce assaults of Satan. It is this principle of self-sacrifice\nthat his kingdom is established to destroy, and he will war against it\nwherever manifested.\nThe childhood, youth, and manhood of John had been charac- [224]\nterized by firmness and moral power. When his voice was heard\nin the wilderness saying, \u201cPrepare ye the way of the Lord, make\nHis paths straight\u201d (Matthew 3:3), Satan feared for the safety of his\nkingdom. The sinfulness of sin was revealed in such a manner that\nmen trembled. Satan\u2019s power over many who had been under his\ncontrol was broken. He had been unwearied in his efforts to draw\naway the Baptist from a life of unreserved surrender to God; but he\nhad failed. And he had failed to overcome Jesus. In the temptation\nin the wilderness, Satan had been defeated, and his rage was great.\nNow he determined to bring sorrow upon Christ by striking John.\nThe One whom he could not entice to sin he would cause to suffer.\nJesus did not interpose to deliver His servant. He knew that John\nwould bear the test. Gladly would the Saviour have come to John,\nto brighten the dungeon gloom with His own presence. But He was\nnot to place Himself in the hands of enemies and imperil His own\nmission. Gladly would He have delivered His faithful servant. But\nfor the sake of thousands who in after years must pass from prison\nto death, John was to drink the cup of martyrdom. As the followers\nof Jesus should languish in lonely cells, or perish by the sword, the\nrack, or the fagot, apparently forsaken by God and man, what a stay\nto their hearts would be the thought that John the Baptist, to whose\nfaithfulness Christ Himself had borne witness, had passed through a\nsimilar experience!\nSatan was permitted to cut short the earthly life of God\u2019s mes-\nsenger; but that life which \u201cis hid with Christ in God,\u201d the destroyer\ncould not reach. Colossians 3:3. He exulted that he had brought\nsorrow upon Christ, but he had failed of conquering John. Death\n186 The Desire of Ages\nitself only placed him forever beyond the power of temptation. In\nthis warfare, Satan was revealing his own character. Before the\nwitnessing universe he made manifest his enmity toward God and\nman.\nThough no miraculous deliverance was granted John, he was not\nforsaken. He had always the companionship of heavenly angels, who\nopened to him the prophecies concerning Christ, and the precious\npromises of Scripture. These were his stay, as they were to be the\nstay of God\u2019s people through the coming ages. To John the Baptist,\nas to those that came after him, was given the assurance, \u201cLo, I am\nwith you all the days, even unto the end.\u201d Matthew 28:20, R. V .,\nmargin.\nGod never leads His children otherwise than they would choose\nto be led, if they could see the end from the beginning, and discern\nthe glory of the purpose which they are fulfilling as co-workers with[225]\nHim. Not Enoch, who was translated to heaven, not Elijah, who\nascended in a chariot of fire, was greater or more honored than John\nthe Baptist, who perished alone in the dungeon. \u201cUnto you it is given\nin the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer\nfor His sake.\u201d Philippians 1:29. And of all the gifts that Heaven can\nbestow upon men, fellowship with Christ in His sufferings is the\nmost weighty trust and the highest honor.\nChapter 23\u2014\u201cThe Kingdom of God Is at Hand\u201d [226]\n[227]\n[228]\n[229]\n[230]\n[231]\n\u201cJesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom\nof God, and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is\nat hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.\u201d Mark 1:14, 15.\nThe Messiah\u2019s coming had been first announced in Judea. In the\ntemple at Jerusalem the birth of the forerunner had been foretold to\nZacharias as he ministered before the altar. On the hills of Bethlehem\nthe angels had proclaimed the birth of Jesus. To Jerusalem the magi\nhad come in search of Him. In the temple Simeon and Anna had\ntestified to His divinity. \u201cJerusalem, and all Judea\u201d had listened\nto the preaching of John the Baptist; and the deputation from the\nSanhedrin, with the multitude, had heard his testimony concerning\nJesus. In Judea, Christ had received His first disciples. Here much\nof His early ministry had been spent. The flashing forth of His\ndivinity in the cleansing of the temple, His miracles of healing, and\nthe lessons of divine truth that fell from His lips, all proclaimed\nthat which after the healing at Bethesda He had declared before the\nSanhedrin,\u2014His Sonship to the Eternal.\nIf the leaders in Israel had received Christ, He would have hon-\nored them as His messengers to carry the gospel to the world. To\nthem first was given the opportunity to become heralds of the king-\ndom and grace of God. But Israel knew not the time of her visitation. [232]\nThe jealousy and distrust of the Jewish leaders had ripened into open\nhatred, and the hearts of the people were turned away from Jesus.\nThe Sanhedrin had rejected Christ\u2019s message and was bent upon\nHis death; therefore Jesus departed from Jerusalem, from the priests,\nthe temple, the religious leaders, the people who had been instructed\nin the law, and turned to another class to proclaim His message, and\nto gather out those who should carry the gospel to all nations.\nAs the light and life of men was rejected by the ecclesiastical\nauthorities in the days of Christ, so it has been rejected in every\nsucceeding generation. Again and again the history of Christ\u2019s with-\ndrawal from Judea has been repeated. When the Reformers preached\n187\n188 The Desire of Ages\nthe word of God, they had no thought of separating themselves from\nthe established church; but the religious leaders would not tolerate\nthe light, and those that bore it were forced to seek another class,\nwho were longing for the truth. In our day few of the professed\nfollowers of the Reformers are actuated by their spirit. Few are\nlistening for the voice of God, and ready to accept truth in whatever\nguise it may be presented. Often those who follow in the steps\nof the Reformers are forced to turn away from the churches they\nlove, in order to declare the plain teaching of the word of God. And\nmany times those who are seeking for light are by the same teaching\nobliged to leave the church of their fathers, that they may render\nobedience.\nThe people of Galilee were despised by the rabbis of Jerusalem\nas rude and unlearned, yet they presented a more favorable field for\nthe Saviour\u2019s work. They were more earnest and sincere; less under\nthe control of bigotry; their minds were more open for the reception\nof truth. In going to Galilee, Jesus was not seeking seclusion or\nisolation. The province was at this time the home of a crowded\npopulation, with a much larger admixture of people of other nations\nthan was found in Judea.\nAs Jesus traveled through Galilee, teaching and healing, multi-\ntudes flocked to Him from the cities and villages. Many came even\nfrom Judea and the adjoining provinces. Often He was obliged to\nhide Himself from the people. The enthusiasm ran so high that it was\nnecessary to take precautions lest the Roman authorities should be\naroused to fear an insurrection. Never before had there been such a\nperiod as this for the world. Heaven was brought down to men. Hun-\ngering and thirsting souls that had waited long for the redemption of\nIsrael now feasted upon the grace of a merciful Saviour.\nThe burden of Christ\u2019s preaching was, \u201cThe time is fulfilled,[233]\nand the kingdom of God is at hand; repent ye, and believe the\ngospel.\u201d Thus the gospel message, as given by the Saviour Himself,\nwas based on the prophecies. The \u201ctime\u201d which He declared to\nbe fulfilled was the period made known by the angel Gabriel to\nDaniel. \u201cSeventy weeks,\u201d said the angel, \u201care determined upon\nthy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and\nto make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity,\nand to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision\n\u201cThe Kingdom of God Is at Hand\u201d 189\nand prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.\u201d Daniel 9:24. A day\nin prophecy stands for a year. See Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6.\nThe seventy weeks, or four hundred and ninety days, represent four\nhundred and ninety years. A starting point for this period is given:\n\u201cKnow therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the\ncommandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the\nPrince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks,\u201d sixty-\nnine weeks, or four hundred and eighty-three years. Daniel 9:25.\nThe commandment to restore and build Jerusalem, as completed by\nthe decree of Artaxerxes Longimanus (see Ezra 6:14; 7:1, 9, margin),\nwent into effect in the autumn of B. C. 457. From this time four\nhundred and eighty-three years extend to the autumn of A. D. 27.\nAccording to the prophecy, this period was to reach to the Messiah,\nthe Anointed One. In A. D. 27, Jesus at His baptism received the\nanointing of the Holy Spirit, and soon afterward began His ministry.\nThen the message was proclaimed. \u201cThe time is fulfilled.\u201d\nThen, said the angel, \u201cHe shall confirm the covenant with many\nfor one week [seven years].\u201d For seven years after the Saviour entered\non His ministry, the gospel was to be preached especially to the Jews;\nfor three and a half years by Christ Himself; and afterward by the\napostles. \u201cIn the midst of the week He shall cause the sacrifice and\nthe oblation to cease.\u201d Daniel 9:27. In the spring of A. D. 31, Christ\nthe true sacrifice was offered on Calvary. Then the veil of the temple\nwas rent in twain, showing that the sacredness and significance of the\nsacrificial service had departed. The time had come for the earthly\nsacrifice and oblation to cease.\nThe one week\u2014seven years\u2014ended in A. D. 34. Then by\nthe stoning of Stephen the Jews finally sealed their rejection of\nthe gospel; the disciples who were scattered abroad by persecution\n\u201cwent everywhere preaching the word\u201d (Acts 8:4); and shortly after,\nSaul the persecutor was converted, and became Paul, the apostle to\nthe Gentiles.\nThe time of Christ\u2019s coming, His anointing by the Holy Spirit, [234]\nHis death, and the giving of the gospel to the Gentiles, were def-\ninitely pointed out. It was the privilege of the Jewish people to\nunderstand these prophecies, and to recognize their fulfillment in\nthe mission of Jesus. Christ urged upon His disciples the importance\nof prophetic study. Referring to the prophecy given to Daniel in\n190 The Desire of Ages\nregard to their time, He said, \u201cWhoso readeth, let him understand.\u201d\nMatthew 24:15. After His resurrection He explained to the disciples\nin \u201call the prophets\u201d \u201cthe things concerning Himself.\u201d Luke 24:27.\nThe Saviour had spoken through all the prophets. \u201cThe Spirit of\nChrist which was in them\u201d \u201ctestified beforehand the sufferings of\nChrist, and the glory that should follow.\u201d 1 Peter 1:11.\nIt was Gabriel, the angel next in rank to the Son of God, who\ncame with the divine message to Daniel. It was Gabriel, \u201cHis angel,\u201d\nwhom Christ sent to open the future to the beloved John; and a\nblessing is pronounced on those who read and hear the words of the\nprophecy, and keep the things written therein. Revelation 1:3.\n\u201cThe Lord God will do nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto\nHis servants and prophets.\u201d While \u201cthe secret things belong unto the\nLord our God,\u201d \u201cthose things which are revealed belong unto us and\nto our children forever.\u201d Amos 3:7; Deuteronomy 29:29. God has\ngiven these things to us, and His blessing will attend the reverent,\nprayerful study of the prophetic scriptures.\nAs the message of Christ\u2019s first advent announced the kingdom\nof His grace, so the message of His second advent announces the\nkingdom of His glory. And the second message, like the first, is\nbased on the prophecies. The words of the angel to Daniel relating\nto the last days were to be understood in the time of the end. At that\ntime, \u201cmany shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.\u201d\n\u201cThe wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall under-\nstand; but the wise shall understand.\u201d Daniel 12:4, 10. The Saviour\nHimself has given signs of His coming, and He says, \u201cWhen ye see\nthese things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh\nat hand.\u201d \u201cAnd take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts\nbe overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this\nlife, and so that day come upon you unawares.\u201d \u201cWatch ye therefore,\nand pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all\nthese things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of\nman.\u201d Luke 21:31, 34, 36.\nWe have reached the period foretold in these scriptures. The[235]\ntime of the end is come, the visions of the prophets are unsealed,\nand their solemn warnings point us to our Lord\u2019s coming in glory as\nnear at hand.\n\u201cThe Kingdom of God Is at Hand\u201d 191\nThe Jews misinterpreted and misapplied the word of God, and\nthey knew not the time of their visitation. The years of the ministry\nof Christ and His apostles,\u2014the precious last years of grace to the\nchosen people,\u2014they spent in plotting the destruction of the Lord\u2019s\nmessengers. Earthly ambitions absorbed them, and the offer of the\nspiritual kingdom came to them in vain. So today the kingdom of this\nworld absorbs men\u2019s thoughts, and they take no note of the rapidly\nfulfilling prophecies and the tokens of the swift-coming kingdom of\nGod.\n\u201cBut ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should over-\ntake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children\nof the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.\u201d While we are\nnot to know the hour of our Lord\u2019s return, we may know when it is\nnear. \u201cTherefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and\nbe sober.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 5:4-6.\nChapter 24\u2014\u201cIs Not This the Carpenter\u2019s Son?\u201d[236]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 4:16-30.\nAcross the bright days of Christ\u2019s ministry in Galilee, one\nshadow lay. The people of Nazareth rejected Him. \u201cIs not this\nthe carpenter\u2019s son?\u201d they said.\nDuring His childhood and youth, Jesus had worshiped among\nHis brethren in the synagogue at Nazareth. Since the opening of\nHis ministry He had been absent from them, but they had not been\nignorant of what had befallen Him. As He again appeared among\nthem, their interest and expectation were excited to the highest pitch.\nHere were the familiar forms and faces of those whom He had known\nfrom infancy. Here were His mother, His brothers and sisters, and\nall eyes were turned upon Him as He entered the synagogue upon\nthe Sabbath day, and took His place among the worshipers.\nIn the regular service for the day, the elder read from the prophets,\nand exhorted the people still to hope for the Coming One, who would\nbring in a glorious reign, and banish all oppression. He sought to\nencourage his hearers by rehearsing the evidence that the Messiah\u2019s\ncoming was near. He described the glory of His advent, keeping\nprominent the thought that He would appear at the head of armies to\ndeliver Israel.\nWhen a rabbi was present at the synagogue, he was expected to\ndeliver the sermon, and any Israelite might give the reading from\nthe prophets. Upon this Sabbath Jesus was requested to take part\nin the service. He \u201cstood up to read. And there was delivered unto\nHim a roll of the prophet Isaiah.\u201d Luke 4:16, 17, R. V ., margin. The\nscripture which He read was one that was understood as referring to\nthe Messiah:\n\u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, [237]\nBecause He hath anointed Me to preach the gospel to the\npoor;\n192\n\u201cIs Not This the Carpenter\u2019s Son?\u201d 193\nHe hath sent Me to heal the brokenhearted,\nTo preach deliverance to the captives,\nAnd recovering of sight to the blind,\nTo set at liberty them that are bruised,\nTo preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cAnd He closed the roll, and gave it back to the attendant: ...\nand the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on Him.... And\nall bare Him witness, and wondered at the words of grace which\nproceeded out of His mouth.\u201d Luke 4:20-22, R. V ., margin.\nJesus stood before the people as a living expositor of the prophe-\ncies concerning Himself. Explaining the words He had read, He\nspoke of the Messiah as a reliever of the oppressed, a liberator of\ncaptives, a healer of the afflicted, restoring sight to the blind, and\nrevealing to the world the light of truth. His impressive manner and\nthe wonderful import of His words thrilled the hearers with a power\nthey had never felt before. The tide of divine influence broke every\nbarrier down; like Moses, they beheld the Invisible. As their hearts\nwere moved upon by the Holy Spirit, they responded with fervent\namens and praises to the Lord.\nBut when Jesus announced, \u201cThis day is this scripture fulfilled in\nyour ears,\u201d they were suddenly recalled to think of themselves, and\nof the claims of Him who had been addressing them. They, Israelites,\nchildren of Abraham, had been represented as in bondage. They had\nbeen addressed as prisoners to be delivered from the power of evil; as\nin darkness, and needing the light of truth. Their pride was offended,\nand their fears were roused. The words of Jesus indicated that His\nwork for them was to be altogether different from what they desired.\nTheir deeds might be investigated too closely. Notwithstanding their\nexactness in outward ceremonies, they shrank from inspection by\nthose clear, searching eyes.\nWho is this Jesus? they questioned. He who had claimed for\nHimself the glory of the Messiah was the son of a carpenter, and\nhad worked at His trade with His father Joseph. They had seen\nHim toiling up and down the hills, they were acquainted with His\nbrothers and sisters, and knew His life and labors. They had seen\nHim develop from childhood to youth, and from youth to manhood.\n194 The Desire of Ages\nAlthough His life had been spotless, they would not believe that He\nwas the Promised One.\nWhat a contrast between His teaching in regard to the new king-[238]\ndom and that which they had heard from their elder! Jesus had said\nnothing of delivering them from the Romans. They had heard of His\nmiracles, and had hoped that His power would be exercised for their\nadvantage, but they had seen no indication of such purpose.\nAs they opened the door to doubt, their hearts became so much\nthe harder for having been momentarily softened. Satan was de-\ntermined that blind eyes should not that day be opened, nor souls\nbound in slavery be set at liberty. With intense energy he worked to\nfasten them in unbelief. They made no account of the sign already\ngiven, when they had been stirred by the conviction that it was their\nRedeemer who addressed them.\nBut Jesus now gave them an evidence of His divinity by revealing\ntheir secret thoughts. \u201cHe said unto them, Doubtless ye will say\nunto Me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have\nheard done at Capernaum, do also here in Thine own country. And\nHe said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is acceptable in his own\ncountry. But of a truth I say unto you, There were many widows in\nIsrael in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years\nand six months, when there came a great famine over all the land;\nand unto none of them was Elijah sent, but only to Zarephath, in\nthe land of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. And there were\nmany lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of\nthem was cleansed, but only Naaman, the Syrian.\u201d Luke 4:23-27, R.",

      "text": "By this relation of events in the lives of the prophets, Jesus met\nthe questionings of His hearers. The servants whom God had chosen\nfor a special work were not allowed to labor for a hardhearted and\nunbelieving people. But those who had hearts to feel and faith to\nbelieve were especially favored with evidences of His power through\nthe prophets. In the days of Elijah, Israel had departed from God.\nThey clung to their sins, and rejected the warnings of the Spirit\nthrough the Lord\u2019s messengers. Thus they cut themselves off from\nthe channel by which God\u2019s blessing could come to them. The Lord\npassed by the homes of Israel, and found a refuge for His servant\nin a heathen land, with a woman who did not belong to the chosen\n\u201cIs Not This the Carpenter\u2019s Son?\u201d 195\npeople. But this woman was favored because she had followed the\nlight she had received, and her heart was open to the greater light\nthat God sent her through His prophet.\nIt was for the same reason that in Elisha\u2019s time the lepers of [239]\nIsrael were passed by. But Naaman, a heathen nobleman, had been\nfaithful to his convictions of right, and had felt his great need of help.\nHe was in a condition to receive the gifts of God\u2019s grace. He was\nnot only cleansed from his leprosy, but blessed with a knowledge of\nthe true God.\nOur standing before God depends, not upon the amount of light\nwe have received, but upon the use we make of what we have. Thus\neven the heathen who choose the right as far as they can distinguish\nit are in a more favorable condition than are those who have had\ngreat light, and profess to serve God, but who disregard the light,\nand by their daily life contradict their profession.\nThe words of Jesus to His hearers in the synagogue struck at the\nroot of their self-righteousness, pressing home upon them the bitter\ntruth that they had departed from God and forfeited their claim to be\nHis people. Every word cut like a knife as their real condition was\nset before them. They now scorned the faith with which Jesus had at\nfirst inspired them. They would not admit that He who had sprung\nfrom poverty and lowliness was other than a common man.\nTheir unbelief bred malice. Satan controlled them, and in wrath\nthey cried out against the Saviour. They had turned from Him whose\nmission it was to heal and restore; now they manifested the attributes [240]\nof the destroyer.\nWhen Jesus referred to the blessings given to the Gentiles, the\nfierce national pride of His hearers was aroused, and His words were\ndrowned in a tumult of voices. These people had prided themselves\non keeping the law; but now that their prejudices were offended, they\nwere ready to commit murder. The assembly broke up, and laying\nhands upon Jesus, they thrust Him from the synagogue, and out of\nthe city. All seemed eager for His destruction. They hurried Him\nto the brow of a precipice, intending to cast Him down headlong.\nShouts and maledictions filled the air. Some were casting stones\nat Him, when suddenly He disappeared from among them. The\nheavenly messengers who had been by His side in the synagogue\n196 The Desire of Ages\nwere with Him in the midst of that maddened throng. They shut\nHim in from His enemies, and conducted Him to a place of safety.\nSo angels protected Lot, and led him out safely from the midst\nof Sodom. So they protected Elisha in the little mountain city. When\nthe encircling hills were filled with the horses and chariots of the\nking of Syria, and the great host of his armed men, Elisha beheld\nthe nearer hill slopes covered with the armies of God,\u2014horses and\nchariots of fire round about the servant of the Lord.\nSo, in all ages, angels have been near to Christ\u2019s faithful follow-\ners. The vast confederacy of evil is arrayed against all who would\novercome; but Christ would have us look to the things which are not\nseen, to the armies of heaven encamped about all who love God, to\ndeliver them. From what dangers, seen and unseen, we have been\npreserved through the interposition of the angels, we shall never\nknow, until in the light of eternity we see the providences of God.\nThen we shall know that the whole family of heaven was interested\nin the family here below, and that messengers from the throne of\nGod attended our steps from day to day.\nWhen Jesus in the synagogue read from the prophecy, He stopped\nshort of the final specification concerning the Messiah\u2019s work. Hav-\ning read the words, \u201cTo proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,\u201d\nHe omitted the phrase, \u201cand the day of vengeance of our God.\u201d Isaiah\n61:2. This was just as much truth as was the first of the prophecy,\nand by His silence Jesus did not deny the truth. But this last expres-\nsion was that upon which His hearers delighted to dwell, and which\nthey were desirous of fulfilling. They denounced judgments against\nthe heathen, not discerning that their own guilt was even greater[241]\nthan that of others. They themselves were in deepest need of the\nmercy they were so ready to deny to the heathen. That day in the\nsynagogue, when Jesus stood among them, was their opportunity\nto accept the call of Heaven. He who \u201cdelighteth in mercy\u201d (Micah\n7:18) would fain have saved them from the ruin which their sins\nwere inviting.\nNot without one more call to repentance could He give them\nup. Toward the close of His ministry in Galilee, He again visited\nthe home of His childhood. Since His rejection there, the fame of\nHis preaching and His miracles had filled the land. None now could\ndeny that He possessed more than human power. The people of\n\u201cIs Not This the Carpenter\u2019s Son?\u201d 197\nNazareth knew that He went about doing good, and healing all that\nwere oppressed by Satan. About them were whole villages where\nthere was not a moan of sickness in any house; for He had passed\nthrough them, and healed all their sick. The mercy revealed in every\nact of His life testified to His divine anointing.\nAgain as they listened to His words the Nazarenes were moved\nby the Divine Spirit. But even now they would not admit that this\nMan, who had been brought up among them, was other or greater\nthan themselves. Still there rankled the bitter memory that while\nHe had claimed for Himself to be the Promised One, He had really\ndenied them a place with Israel; for He had shown them to be less\nworthy of God\u2019s favor than a heathen man and woman. Hence\nthough they questioned, \u201cWhence hath this Man this wisdom, and\nthese mighty works?\u201d they would not receive Him as the Christ of\nGod. Because of their unbelief, the Saviour could not work many\nmiracles among them. Only a few hearts were open to His blessing,\nand reluctantly He departed, never to return.\nUnbelief, having once been cherished, continued to control the\nmen of Nazareth. So it controlled the Sanhedrin and the nation. With\npriests and people, the first rejection of the demonstration of the\nHoly Spirit\u2019s power was the beginning of the end. In order to prove\nthat their first resistance was right, they continued ever after to cavil\nat the words of Christ. Their rejection of the Spirit culminated in the\ncross of Calvary, in the destruction of their city, in the scattering of\nthe nation to the winds of heaven.\nOh, how Christ longed to open to Israel the precious treasures of\nthe truth! But such was their spiritual blindness that it was impossible\nto reveal to them the truths relating to His kingdom. They clung to [242]\ntheir creed and their useless ceremonies when the truth of Heaven\nawaited their acceptance. They spent their money for chaff and husks,\nwhen the bread of life was within their reach. Why did they not go\nto the word of God, and search diligently to know whether they were\nin error? The Old Testament Scriptures stated plainly every detail of\nChrist\u2019s ministry, and again and again He quoted from the prophets,\nand declared, \u201cThis day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.\u201d If they\nhad honestly searched the Scriptures, bringing their theories to the\ntest of God\u2019s word, Jesus need not have wept over their impenitence.\nHe need not have declared, \u201cBehold, your house is left unto you\n198 The Desire of Ages\ndesolate.\u201d Luke 13:35. They might have been acquainted with the\nevidence of His Messiahship, and the calamity that laid their proud\ncity in ruins might have been averted. But the minds of the Jews\nhad become narrowed by their unreasoning bigotry. The lessons\nof Christ revealed their deficiencies of character, and demanded\nrepentance. If they accepted His teachings, their practices must be\nchanged, and their cherished hopes relinquished. In order to be\nhonored by Heaven, they must sacrifice the honor of men. If they\nobeyed the words of this new rabbi, they must go contrary to the\nopinions of the great thinkers and teachers of the time.\nTruth was unpopular in Christ\u2019s day. It is unpopular in our day.\nIt has been unpopular ever since Satan first gave man a disrelish\nfor it by presenting fables that lead to self-exaltation. Do we not\ntoday meet theories and doctrines that have no foundation in the\nword of God? Men cling as tenaciously to them as did the Jews to\ntheir traditions.\nThe Jewish leaders were filled with spiritual pride. Their desire\nfor the glorification of self manifested itself even in the service of\nthe sanctuary. They loved the highest seats in the synagogue. They\nloved greetings in the market places, and were gratified with the\nsound of their titles on the lips of men. As real piety declined, they\nbecame more jealous for their traditions and ceremonies.\nBecause their understanding was darkened by selfish prejudice,\nthey could not harmonize the power of Christ\u2019s convicting words\nwith the humility of His life. They did not appreciate the fact that\nreal greatness can dispense with outward show. This Man\u2019s poverty\nseemed wholly inconsistent with His claim to be the Messiah. They\nquestioned, If He was what He claimed to be, why was He so unpre-\ntending? If He was satisfied to be without the force of arms, what\nwould become of their nation? How could the power and glory so[243]\nlong anticipated bring the nations as subjects to the city of the Jews?\nHad not the priests taught that Israel was to bear rule over all the\nearth? and could it be possible that the great religious teachers were\nin error?\nBut it was not simply the absence of outward glory in His life\nthat led the Jews to reject Jesus. He was the embodiment of purity,\nand they were impure. He dwelt among men an example of spotless\nintegrity. His blameless life flashed light upon their hearts. His\n\u201cIs Not This the Carpenter\u2019s Son?\u201d 199\nsincerity revealed their insincerity. It made manifest the hollowness\nof their pretentious piety, and discovered iniquity to them in its\nodious character. Such a light was unwelcome.\nIf Christ had called attention to the Pharisees, and had extolled\ntheir learning and piety, they would have hailed Him with joy. But\nwhen He spoke of the kingdom of heaven as a dispensation of mercy\nfor all mankind, He was presenting a phase of religion they would\nnot tolerate. Their own example and teaching had never been such\nas to make the service of God seem desirable. When they saw Jesus\ngiving attention to the very ones they hated and repulsed, it stirred\nup the worst passions of their proud hearts. Notwithstanding their\nboast that under the \u201cLion of the tribe of Judah\u201d (Revelation 5:5),\nIsrael should be exalted to pre-eminence over all nations, they could\nhave borne the disappointment of their ambitious hopes better than\nthey could bear Christ\u2019s reproof of their sins, and the reproach they\nfelt even from the presence of His purity.\nChapter 25\u2014The Call by the Sea[244]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 4:18-22; Mark 1:16-20; Luke\n5:1-11.\nDay was breaking over the Sea of Galilee. The disciples, weary\nwith a night of fruitless toil, were still in their fishing boats on the\nlake. Jesus had come to spend a quiet hour by the waterside. In the\nearly morning He hoped for a little season of rest from the multitude\nthat followed Him day after day. But soon the people began to gather\nabout Him. Their numbers rapidly increased, so that He was pressed\nupon all sides. Meanwhile the disciples had come to land. In order\nto escape the pressure of the multitude, Jesus stepped into Peter\u2019s\nboat, and bade him pull out a little from the shore. Here Jesus could\nbe better seen and heard by all, and from the boat He taught the\nmultitude on the beach.\nWhat a scene was this for angels to contemplate; their glorious\nCommander, sitting in a fisherman\u2019s boat, swayed to and fro by the\nrestless waves, and proclaiming the good news of salvation to the\nlistening throng that were pressing down to the water\u2019s edge! He\nwho was the Honored of heaven was declaring the great things of His\nkingdom in the open air, to the common people. Yet He could have\nhad no more fitting scene for His labors. The lake, the mountains,\nthe spreading fields, the sunlight flooding the earth, all furnished[245]\nobjects to illustrate His lessons and impress them upon the mind.\nAnd no lesson of Christ\u2019s fell fruitless. Every message from His lips\ncame to some soul as the word of eternal life.\nEvery moment added to the multitude upon the shore. Aged men\nleaning upon their staffs, hardy peasants from the hills, fishermen\nfrom their toil on the lake, merchants and rabbis, the rich and learned,\nold and young, bringing their sick and suffering ones, pressed to\nhear the words of the divine Teacher. To such scenes as this the\nprophets had looked forward, and they wrote:\n\u201cThe land of Zebulon and the land of Naphtali,\n200\nCall by the Sea 201\nToward the sea, beyond Jordan,\nGalilee of the Gentiles,\nThe people which sat in darkness\nSaw a great light,\nAnd to them which sat in the region and shadow of death,\nTo them did light spring up.\u201d R. V .\nBeside the throng on the shores of Gennesaret, Jesus in His\nsermon by the sea had other audiences before His mind. Looking\ndown the ages, He saw His faithful ones in prison and judgment hall,\nin temptation and loneliness and affliction. Every scene of joy and\nconflict and perplexity was open before Him. In the words spoken to\nthose gathered about Him, He was speaking also to these other souls\nthe very words that would come to them as a message of hope in\ntrial, of comfort in sorrow, and heavenly light in darkness. Through\nthe Holy Spirit, that voice which was speaking from the fisherman\u2019s\nboat on the Sea of Galilee, would be heard speaking peace to human\nhearts to the close of time.\nThe discourse ended, Jesus turned to Peter, and bade him launch\nout into the sea, and let down his net for a draught. But Peter\nwas disheartened. All night he had taken nothing. During the\nlonely hours he had thought of the fate of John the Baptist, who was\nlanguishing alone in his dungeon. He had thought of the prospect\nbefore Jesus and His followers, of the ill success of the mission\nto Judea, and the malice of the priests and rabbis. Even his own\noccupation had failed him; and as he watched by the empty nets,\nthe future had seemed dark with discouragement. \u201cMaster,\u201d he said,\n\u201cwe have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless\nat Thy word I will let down the net.\u201d\nNight was the only favorable time for fishing with nets in the [246]\nclear waters of the lake. After toiling all night without success, it\nseemed hopeless to cast the net by day; but Jesus had given the\ncommand, and love for their Master moved the disciples to obey.\nSimon and his brother together let down the net. As they attempted\nto draw it in, so great was the quantity of fish enclosed that it began\nto break. They were obliged to summon James and John to their aid.\nWhen the catch was secured, both the boats were so heavily laden\nthat they were in danger of sinking.\n202 The Desire of Ages\nBut Peter was unmindful now of boats or lading. This miracle,\nabove any other he had ever witnessed, was to him a manifestation\nof divine power. In Jesus he saw One who held all nature under\nHis control. The presence of divinity revealed his own unholiness.\nLove for his Master, shame for his own unbelief, gratitude for the\ncondescension of Christ, above all, the sense of his uncleanness\nin the presence of infinite purity, overwhelmed him. While his\ncompanions were securing the contents of the net, Peter fell at the\nSaviour\u2019s feet, exclaiming, \u201cDepart from me; for I am a sinful man,\nO Lord.\u201d\nIt was the same presence of divine holiness that had caused the\nprophet Daniel to fall as one dead before the angel of God. He said,\n\u201cMy comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no\nstrength.\u201d So when Isaiah beheld the glory of the Lord, he exclaimed,\n\u201cWoe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips,\nand I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes\nhave seen the King, the Lord of hosts.\u201d Daniel 10:8; Isaiah 6:5.\nHumanity, with its weakness and sin, was brought in contrast with\nthe perfection of divinity, and he felt altogether deficient and unholy.\nThus it has been with all who have been granted a view of God\u2019s\ngreatness and majesty.\nPeter exclaimed, \u201cDepart from me; for I am a sinful man;\u201d yet\nhe clung to the feet of Jesus, feeling that he could not be parted from\nHim. The Saviour answered, \u201cFear not; from henceforth thou shalt\ncatch men.\u201d It was after Isaiah had beheld the holiness of God and\nhis own unworthiness that he was entrusted with the divine message.\nIt was after Peter had been led to self-renunciation and dependence\nupon divine power that he received the call to his work for Christ.\nUntil this time none of the disciples had fully united as colaborers\nwith Jesus. They had witnessed many of His miracles, and had\nlistened to His teaching; but they had not entirely forsaken their\nformer employment. The imprisonment of John the Baptist had[247]\n[248]\n[249]\nbeen to them all a bitter disappointment. If such were to be the\noutcome of John\u2019s mission, they could have little hope for their\nMaster, with all the religious leaders combined against Him. Under\nthe circumstances it was a relief to them to return for a short time to\ntheir fishing. But now Jesus called them to forsake their former life,\nand unite their interests with His. Peter had accepted the call. Upon\nCall by the Sea 203\nreaching the shore, Jesus bade the three other disciples, \u201cFollow Me,\nand I will make you fishers of men.\u201d Immediately they left all, and\nfollowed Him.\nBefore asking them to leave their nets and fishing boats, Jesus\nhad given them the assurance that God would supply their needs.\nThe use of Peter\u2019s boat for the work of the gospel had been richly\nrepaid. He who is \u201crich unto all that call upon Him,\u201d has said, \u201cGive,\nand it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and\nshaken together, and running over.\u201d Romans 10:12; Luke 6:38. In\nthis measure He had rewarded the disciple\u2019s service. And every\nsacrifice that is made in His ministry will be recompensed according\nto \u201cthe exceeding riches of His grace.\u201d Ephesians 3:20; 2:7.\nDuring that sad night on the lake, when they were separated\nfrom Christ, the disciples were pressed hard by unbelief, and weary\nwith fruitless toil. But His presence kindled their faith, and brought\nthem joy and success. So it is with us; apart from Christ, our work\nis fruitless, and it is easy to distrust and murmur. But when He is\nnear, and we labor under His direction, we rejoice in the evidence of\nHis power. It is Satan\u2019s work to discourage the soul; it is Christ\u2019s\nwork to inspire with faith and hope.\nThe deeper lesson which the miracle conveyed for the disciples\nis a lesson for us also,\u2014that He whose word could gather the fishes\nfrom the sea could also impress human hearts, and draw them by\nthe cords of His love, so that His servants might become \u201cfishers of\nmen.\u201d\nThey were humble and unlearned men, those fishers of Galilee;\nbut Christ, the light of the world, was abundantly able to qualify\nthem for the position for which He had chosen them. The Saviour\ndid not despise education; for when controlled by the love of God,\nand devoted to His service, intellectual culture is a blessing. But\nHe passed by the wise men of His time, because they were so self-\nconfident that they could not sympathize with suffering humanity,\nand become colaborers with the Man of Nazareth. In their bigotry\nthey scorned to be taught by Christ. The Lord Jesus seeks the\nco-operation of those who will become unobstructed channels for [250]\nthe communication of His grace. The first thing to be learned by\nall who would become workers together with God is the lesson of\nself-distrust; then they are prepared to have imparted to them the\n204 The Desire of Ages\ncharacter of Christ. This is not to be gained through education in\nthe most scientific schools. It is the fruit of wisdom that is obtained\nfrom the divine Teacher alone.\nJesus chose unlearned fishermen because they had not been\nschooled in the traditions and erroneous customs of their time. They\nwere men of native ability, and they were humble and teachable,\u2014\nmen whom He could educate for His work. In the common walks\nof life there is many a man patiently treading the round of daily\ntoil, unconscious that he possesses powers which, if called into\naction, would raise him to an equality with the world\u2019s most honored\nmen. The touch of a skillful hand is needed to arouse those dormant\nfaculties. It was such men that Jesus called to be His colaborers;\nand He gave them the advantage of association with Himself. Never\nhad the world\u2019s great men such a teacher. When the disciples came\nforth from the Saviour\u2019s training, they were no longer ignorant and\nuncultured. They had become like Him in mind and character, and\nmen took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus.\nIt is not the highest work of education to communicate knowl-\nedge merely, but to impart that vitalizing energy which is received\nthrough the contact of mind with mind, and soul with soul. It is only\nlife that can beget life. What privilege, then, was theirs who for\nthree years were in daily contact with that divine life from which has\nflowed every life-giving impulse that has blessed the world! Above\nall his companions, John the beloved disciple yielded himself to the\npower of that wondrous life. He says, \u201cThe life was manifested, and\nwe have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal\nlife, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.\u201d \u201cOf\nHis fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.\u201d 1 John 1:2;\nJohn 1:16.\nIn the apostles of our Lord there was nothing to bring glory to\nthemselves. It was evident that the success of their labors was due\nonly to God. The lives of these men, the characters they developed,\nand the mighty work that God wrought through them, are a testimony\nto what He will do for all who are teachable and obedient.\nHe who loves Christ the most will do the greatest amount of\ngood. There is no limit to the usefulness of one who, by putting self\naside, makes room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his heart,[251]\nand lives a life wholly consecrated to God. If men will endure the\nCall by the Sea 205\nnecessary discipline, without complaining or fainting by the way,\nGod will teach them hour by hour, and day by day. He longs to\nreveal His grace. If His people will remove the obstructions, He will\npour forth the waters of salvation in abundant streams through the\nhuman channels. If men in humble life were encouraged to do all\nthe good they could do, if restraining hands were not laid upon them\nto repress their zeal, there would be a hundred workers for Christ\nwhere now there is one.\nGod takes men as they are, and educates them for His service,\nif they will yield themselves to Him. The Spirit of God, received\ninto the soul, will quicken all its faculties. Under the guidance of the\nHoly Spirit, the mind that is devoted unreservedly to God develops\nharmoniously, and is strengthened to comprehend and fulfill the\nrequirements of God. The weak, vacillating character becomes\nchanged to one of strength and steadfastness. Continual devotion\nestablishes so close a relation between Jesus and His disciple that\nthe Christian becomes like Him in mind and character. Through a\nconnection with Christ he will have clearer and broader views. His\ndiscernment will be more penetrative, his judgment better balanced.\nHe who longs to be of service to Christ is so quickened by the life-\ngiving power of the Sun of Righteousness that he is enabled to bear\nmuch fruit to the glory of God.\nMen of the highest education in the arts and sciences have\nlearned precious lessons from Christians in humble life who were\ndesignated by the world as unlearned. But these obscure disciples\nhad obtained an education in the highest of all schools. They had sat\nat the feet of Him who spoke as \u201cnever man spake.\u201d\nChapter 26\u2014At Capernaum[252]\nAt Capernaum Jesus dwelt in the intervals of His journeys to and\nfro, and it came to be known as \u201cHis own city.\u201d It was on the shores\nof the Sea of Galilee, and near the borders of the beautiful plain of\nGennesaret, if not actually upon it.\nThe deep depression of the lake gives to the plain that skirts its\nshores the genial climate of the south. Here in the days of Christ\nflourished the palm tree and the olive, here were orchards and vine-\nyards, green fields, and brightly blooming flowers in rich luxuriance,\nall watered by living streams bursting from the cliffs. The shores of\nthe lake, and the hills that at a little distance encircle it, were dotted\nwith towns and villages. The lake was covered with fishing boats.\nEverywhere was the stir of busy, active life.\nCapernaum itself was well adapted to be the center of the\nSaviour\u2019s work. Being on the highway from Damascus to Jerusalem\nand Egypt, and to the Mediterranean Sea, it was a great thoroughfare\nof travel. People from many lands passed through the city, or tarried\nfor rest in their journeyings to and fro. Here Jesus could meet all\nnations and all ranks, the rich and great as well as the poor and lowly,\nand His lessons would be carried to other countries and into many\nhouseholds. Investigation of the prophecies would thus be excited,[253]\nattention would be directed to the Saviour, and His mission would\nbe brought before the world.\nNotwithstanding the action of the Sanhedrin against Jesus, the\npeople eagerly awaited the development of His mission. All heaven\nwas astir with interest. Angels were preparing the way for His min-\nistry, moving upon men\u2019s hearts, and drawing them to the Saviour.\nIn Capernaum the nobleman\u2019s son whom Christ had healed was\na witness to His power. And the court official and his household\njoyfully testified of their faith. When it was known that the Teacher\nHimself was among them, the whole city was aroused. Multitudes\nflocked to His presence. On the Sabbath the people crowded the\n206\nAt Capernaum 207\nsynagogue until great numbers had to turn away, unable to find\nentrance.\nAll who heard the Saviour \u201cwere astonished at His doctrine: for\nHis word was with power.\u201d \u201cHe taught them as one having authority,\nand not as the scribes.\u201d Luke 4:32; Matthew 7:29. The teaching of\nthe scribes and elders was cold and formal, like a lesson learned\nby rote. To them the word of God possessed no vital power. Their\nown ideas and traditions were substituted for its teaching. In the\naccustomed round of service they professed to explain the law, but\nno inspiration from God stirred their own hearts or the hearts of their\nhearers.\nJesus had nothing to do with the various subjects of dissension\namong the Jews. It was His work to present the truth. His words\nshed a flood of light upon the teachings of patriarchs and prophets,\nand the Scriptures came to men as a new revelation. Never before\nhad His hearers perceived such a depth of meaning in the word of\nGod.\nJesus met the people on their own ground, as one who was\nacquainted with their perplexities. He made truth beautiful by pre-\nsenting it in the most direct and simple way. His language was pure,\nrefined, and clear as a running stream. His voice was as music to\nthose who had listened to the monotonous tones of the rabbis. But\nwhile His teaching was simple, He spoke as one having authority.\nThis characteristic set His teaching in contrast with that of all others.\nThe rabbis spoke with doubt and hesitancy, as if the Scriptures might\nbe interpreted to mean one thing or exactly the opposite. The hear-\ners were daily involved in greater uncertainty. But Jesus taught the\nScriptures as of unquestionable authority. Whatever His subject, it\nwas presented with power, as if His words could not be controverted.\nYet He was earnest, rather than vehement. He spoke as one who [254]\nhad a definite purpose to fulfill. He was bringing to view the realities\nof the eternal world. In every theme God was revealed. Jesus\nsought to break the spell of infatuation which keeps men absorbed in\nearthly things. He placed the things of this life in their true relation,\nas subordinate to those of eternal interest; but He did not ignore their\nimportance. He taught that heaven and earth are linked together,\nand that a knowledge of divine truth prepares men better to perform\nthe duties of everyday life. He spoke as one familiar with heaven,\n208 The Desire of Ages\nconscious of His relationship to God, yet recognizing His unity with\nevery member of the human family.\nHis messages of mercy were varied to suit His audience. He\nknew \u201chow to speak a word in season to him that is weary\u201d (Isaiah\n50:4); for grace was poured upon His lips, that He might convey to\nmen in the most attractive way the treasures of truth. He had tact\nto meet the prejudiced minds, and surprise them with illustrations\nthat won their attention. Through the imagination He reached the\nheart. His illustrations were taken from the things of daily life, and\nalthough they were simple, they had in them a wonderful depth\nof meaning. The birds of the air, the lilies of the field, the seed,\nthe shepherd and the sheep,\u2014with these objects Christ illustrated\nimmortal truth; and ever afterward, when His hearers chanced to see\nthese things of nature, they recalled His words. Christ\u2019s illustrations\nconstantly repeated His lessons.\nChrist never flattered men. He never spoke that which would\nexalt their fancies and imaginations, nor did He praise them for\ntheir clever inventions; but deep, unprejudiced thinkers received His\nteaching, and found that it tested their wisdom. They marveled at the\nspiritual truth expressed in the simplest language. The most highly\neducated were charmed with His words, and the uneducated were\nalways profited. He had a message for the illiterate; and He made\neven the heathen to understand that He had a message for them.\nHis tender compassion fell with a touch of healing upon weary\nand troubled hearts. Even amid the turbulence of angry enemies\nHe was surrounded with an atmosphere of peace. The beauty of\nHis countenance, the loveliness of His character, above all, the love\nexpressed in look and tone, drew to Him all who were not hardened\nin unbelief. Had it not been for the sweet, sympathetic spirit that\nshone out in every look and word, He would not have attracted the\nlarge congregations that He did. The afflicted ones who came to\nHim felt that He linked His interest with theirs as a faithful and[255]\ntender friend, and they desired to know more of the truths He taught.\nHeaven was brought near. They longed to abide in His presence,\nthat the comfort of His love might be with them continually.\nJesus watched with deep earnestness the changing countenances\nof His hearers. The faces that expressed interest and pleasure gave\nHim great satisfaction. As the arrows of truth pierced to the soul,\nAt Capernaum 209\nbreaking through the barriers of selfishness, and working contrition,\nand finally gratitude, the Saviour was made glad. When His eye\nswept over the throng of listeners, and He recognized among them\nthe faces He had before seen, His countenance lighted up with joy.\nHe saw in them hopeful subjects for His kingdom. When the truth,\nplainly spoken, touched some cherished idol, He marked the change\nof countenance, the cold, forbidding look, which told that the light\nwas unwelcome. When He saw men refuse the message of peace,\nHis heart was pierced to the very depths.\nJesus in the synagogue spoke of the kingdom He had come to\nestablish, and of His mission to set free the captives of Satan. He\nwas interrupted by a shriek of terror. A madman rushed forward\nfrom among the people, crying out, \u201cLet us alone; what have we to\ndo with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth? art Thou come to destroy\nus? I know Thee who Thou art; the Holy One of God.\u201d\nAll was now confusion and alarm. The attention of the people\nwas diverted from Christ, and His words were unheeded. This was\nSatan\u2019s purpose in leading his victim to the synagogue. But Jesus\nrebuked the demon, saying, \u201cHold thy peace, and come out of him.\nAnd when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of\nhim, and hurt him not.\u201d\nThe mind of this wretched sufferer had been darkened by Satan,\nbut in the Saviour\u2019s presence a ray of light had pierced the gloom.\nHe was roused to long for freedom from Satan\u2019s control; but the\ndemon resisted the power of Christ. When the man tried to appeal\nto Jesus for help, the evil spirit put words into his mouth, and he\ncried out in an agony of fear. The demoniac partially comprehended\nthat he was in the presence of One who could set him free; but when\nhe tried to come within reach of that mighty hand, another\u2019s will\nheld him, another\u2019s words found utterance through him. The conflict\nbetween the power of Satan and his own desire for freedom was\nterrible.\nHe who had conquered Satan in the wilderness of temptation [256]\nwas again brought face to face with His enemy. The demon exerted\nall his power to retain control of his victim. To lose ground here\nwould be to give Jesus a victory. It seemed that the tortured man\nmust lose his life in the struggle with the foe that had been the ruin\nof his manhood. But the Saviour spoke with authority, and set the\n210 The Desire of Ages\ncaptive free. The man who had been possessed stood before the\nwondering people happy in the freedom of self-possession. Even\nthe demon had testified to the divine power of the Saviour.\nThe man praised God for his deliverance. The eye that had so\nlately glared with the fire of insanity, now beamed with intelligence,\nand overflowed with grateful tears. The people were dumb with\namazement. As soon as they recovered speech they exclaimed,\none to another, \u201cWhat is this? a new teaching! with authority He\ncommandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.\u201d Mark",

      "text": "The secret cause of the affliction that had made this man a fearful\nspectacle to his friends and a burden to himself was in his own life.\nHe had been fascinated by the pleasures of sin, and had thought to\nmake life a grand carnival. He did not dream of becoming a terror to\nthe world and the reproach of his family. He thought his time could\nbe spent in innocent folly. But once in the downward path, his feet\nrapidly descended. Intemperance and frivolity perverted the noble\nattributes of his nature, and Satan took absolute control of him.\nRemorse came too late. When he would have sacrificed wealth\nand pleasure to regain his lost manhood, he had become helpless\nin the grasp of the evil one. He had placed himself on the enemy\u2019s\nground, and Satan had taken possession of all his faculties. The\ntempter had allured him with many charming presentations; but\nwhen once the wretched man was in his power, the fiend became\nrelentless in his cruelty, and terrible in his angry visitations. So it\nwill be with all who yield to evil; the fascinating pleasure of their\nearly career ends in the darkness of despair or the madness of a\nruined soul.\nThe same evil spirit that tempted Christ in the wilderness, and\nthat possessed the maniac of Capernaum, controlled the unbelieving\nJews. But with them he assumed an air of piety, seeking to deceive\nthem as to their motives in rejecting the Saviour. Their condition\nwas more hopeless than that of the demoniac, for they felt no need\nof Christ and were therefore held fast under the power of Satan.\nThe period of Christ\u2019s personal ministry among men was the time[257]\nof greatest activity for the forces of the kingdom of darkness. For\nages Satan with his evil angels had been seeking to control the bodies\nand the souls of men, to bring upon them sin and suffering; then he\nAt Capernaum 211\nhad charged all this misery upon God. Jesus was revealing to men\nthe character of God. He was breaking Satan\u2019s power, and setting\nhis captives free. New life and love and power from heaven were\nmoving upon the hearts of men, and the prince of evil was aroused\nto contend for the supremacy of his kingdom. Satan summoned all\nhis forces, and at every step contested the work of Christ.\nSo it will be in the great final conflict of the controversy between\nrighteousness and sin. While new life and light and power are\ndescending from on high upon the disciples of Christ, a new life is\nspringing up from beneath, and energizing the agencies of Satan.\nIntensity is taking possession of every earthly element. With a\nsubtlety gained through centuries of conflict, the prince of evil works\nunder a disguise. He appears clothed as an angel of light, and\nmultitudes are \u201cgiving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of\ndevils.\u201d 1 Timothy 4:1.\nIn the days of Christ the leaders and teachers of Israel were\npowerless to resist the work of Satan. They were neglecting the\nonly means by which they could have withstood evil spirits. It was\nby the word of God that Christ overcame the wicked one. The\nleaders of Israel professed to be the expositors of God\u2019s word, but\nthey had studied it only to sustain their traditions, and enforce their\nman-made observances. By their interpretation they made it express\nsentiments that God had never given. Their mystical construction\nmade indistinct that which He had made plain. They disputed over\ninsignificant technicalities, and practically denied the most essential\ntruths. Thus infidelity was sown broadcast. God\u2019s word was robbed\nof its power, and evil spirits worked their will.\nHistory is repeating. With the open Bible before them, and [258]\nprofessing to reverence its teachings, many of the religious leaders\nof our time are destroying faith in it as the word of God. They busy\nthemselves with dissecting the word, and set their own opinions\nabove its plainest statements. In their hands God\u2019s word loses its\nregenerating power. This is why infidelity runs riot, and iniquity is\nrife.\nWhen Satan has undermined faith in the Bible, he directs men to\nother sources for light and power. Thus he insinuates himself. Those\nwho turn from the plain teaching of Scripture and the convicting\npower of God\u2019s Holy Spirit are inviting the control of demons. Criti-\n212 The Desire of Ages\ncism and speculation concerning the Scriptures have opened the way\nfor spiritism and theosophy\u2014those modernized forms of ancient\nheathenism\u2014to gain a foothold even in the professed churches of\nour Lord Jesus Christ.\nSide by side with the preaching of the gospel, agencies are at\nwork which are but the medium of lying spirits. Many a man tampers\nwith these merely from curiosity, but seeing evidence of the working\nof a more than human power, he is lured on and on, until he is\ncontrolled by a will stronger than his own. He cannot escape from\nits mysterious power.\nThe defenses of the soul are broken down. He has no barrier\nagainst sin. When once the restraints of God\u2019s word and His Spirit\nare rejected, no man knows to what depths of degradation he may\nsink. Secret sin or master passion may hold him a captive as help-\nless as was the demoniac of Capernaum. Yet his condition is not\nhopeless.\nThe means by which we can overcome the wicked one is that\nby which Christ overcame,\u2014the power of the word. God does not\ncontrol our minds without our consent; but if we desire to know and\nto do His will, His promises are ours: \u201cYe shall know the truth, and\nthe truth shall make you free.\u201d \u201cIf any man willeth to do His will, he\nshall know of the teaching.\u201d John 8:32; 7:17, R. V . Through faith\nin these promises, every man may be delivered from the snares of\nerror and the control of sin.\nEvery man is free to choose what power he will have to rule\nover him. None have fallen so low, none are so vile, but that they\ncan find deliverance in Christ. The demoniac, in place of prayer,\ncould utter only the words of Satan; yet the heart\u2019s unspoken appeal\nwas heard. No cry from a soul in need, though it fail of utterance\nin words, will be unheeded. Those who will consent to enter into\ncovenant relation with the God of heaven are not left to the power\nof Satan or to the infirmity of their own nature. They are invited by[259]\nthe Saviour, \u201cLet him take hold of My strength, that he may make\npeace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.\u201d Isaiah 27:5. The\nspirits of darkness will battle for the soul once under their dominion,\nbut angels of God will contend for that soul with prevailing power.\nThe Lord says, \u201cShall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the\nlawful captive delivered? ... Thus saith the Lord, Even the captives\nAt Capernaum 213\nof the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall\nbe delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee,\nand I will save thy children.\u201d Isaiah 49:24, 25.\nWhile the congregation in the synagogue were still spellbound\nwith awe, Jesus withdrew to the home of Peter for a little rest. But\nhere also a shadow had fallen. The mother of Peter\u2019s wife lay sick,\nstricken with a \u201cgreat fever.\u201d Jesus rebuked the disease, and the\nsufferer arose, and ministered to the wants of the Master and His\ndisciples.\nTidings of the work of Christ spread rapidly throughout Caper-\nnaum. For fear of the rabbis, the people dared not come for healing\nupon the Sabbath; but no sooner had the sun disappeared below\nthe horizon than there was a great commotion. From the homes,\nthe shops, the market places, the inhabitants of the city pressed\ntoward the humble dwelling that sheltered Jesus. The sick were\nbrought upon couches, they came leaning upon staffs, or, supported\nby friends, they tottered feebly into the Saviour\u2019s presence.\nHour after hour they came and went; for none could know\nwhether tomorrow would find the Healer still among them. Never\nbefore had Capernaum witnessed a day like this. The air was filled\nwith the voice of triumph and shouts of deliverance. The Saviour\nwas joyful in the joy He had awakened. As He witnessed the suf-\nferings of those who had come to Him, His heart was stirred with\nsympathy, and He rejoiced in His power to restore them to health\nand happiness.\nNot until the last sufferer had been relieved did Jesus cease His\nwork. It was far into the night when the multitude departed, and\nsilence settled down upon the home of Simon. The long, exciting\nday was past, and Jesus sought rest. But while the city was still\nwrapped in slumber, the Saviour, \u201crising up a great while before day,\n... went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.\u201d\nThus were spent the days in the earthly life of Jesus. He often\ndismissed His disciples to visit their homes and rest; but He gently\nresisted their efforts to draw Him away from His labors. All day\nHe toiled, teaching the ignorant, healing the sick, giving sight to [260]\nthe blind, feeding the multitude; and at the eventide or in the early\nmorning, He went away to the sanctuary of the mountains for com-\n214 The Desire of Ages\nmunion with His Father. Often He passed the entire night in prayer\nand meditation, returning at daybreak to His work among the people.\nEarly in the morning, Peter and his companions came to Jesus,\nsaying that already the people of Capernaum were seeking Him.\nThe disciples had been bitterly disappointed at the reception which\nChrist had met hitherto. The authorities at Jerusalem were seeking\nto murder Him; even His own townsmen had tried to take His life;\nbut at Capernaum He was welcomed with joyful enthusiasm, and\nthe hopes of the disciples kindled anew. It might be that among\nthe liberty-loving Galileans were to be found the supporters of the\nnew kingdom. But with surprise they heard Christ\u2019s words, \u201cI must\npreach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I\nsent.\u201d\nIn the excitement which then pervaded Capernaum, there was\ndanger that the object of His mission would be lost sight of. Jesus\nwas not satisfied to attract attention to Himself merely as a wonder\nworker or a healer of physical diseases. He was seeking to draw men\nto Him as their Saviour. While the people were eager to believe that\nHe had come as a king, to establish an earthly reign, He desired to\nturn their minds away from the earthly to the spiritual. Mere worldly\nsuccess would interfere with His work.\nAnd the wonder of the careless crowd jarred upon His spirit. In\nHis life no self-assertion mingled. The homage which the world\ngives to position, or wealth, or talent, was foreign to the Son of\nman. None of the means that men employ to win allegiance or\ncommand homage did Jesus use. Centuries before His birth, it had\nbeen prophesied of Him, \u201cHe shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause His[261]\nvoice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall He not break,\nand the dimly burning flax shall He not quench: He shall bring forth\njudgment unto truth. He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till He\nhave set judgment in the earth.\u201d Isaiah 42:2-4, margin.\nThe Pharisees sought distinction by their scrupulous ceremonial-\nism, and the ostentation of their worship and charities. They proved\ntheir zeal for religion by making it the theme of discussion. Disputes\nbetween opposing sects were loud and long, and it was not unusual\nto hear on the streets the voice of angry controversy from learned\ndoctors of the law.\nAt Capernaum 215\nIn marked contrast to all this was the life of Jesus. In that life no\nnoisy disputation, no ostentatious worship, no act to gain applause,\nwas ever witnessed. Christ was hid in God, and God was revealed in\nthe character of His Son. To this revelation Jesus desired the minds\nof the people to be directed, and their homage to be given.\nThe Sun of Righteousness did not burst upon the world in splen-\ndor, to dazzle the senses with His glory. It is written of Christ, \u201cHis\ngoing forth is prepared as the morning.\u201d Hosea 6:3. Quietly and\ngently the daylight breaks upon the earth, dispelling the shadow of\ndarkness, and waking the world to life. So did the Sun of Righteous-\nness arise, \u201cwith healing in His wings.\u201d Malachi 4:2.\nChapter 27\u2014\u201cThou Canst Make Me Clean\u201d[262]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 8:2-4; Matthew 9:1-8; Matthew\n9:32-34; Mark 1:40-45; Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:12-28.\nOf all diseases known in the East the leprosy was most dreaded.\nIts incurable and contagious character, and its horrible effect upon its\nvictims, filled the bravest with fear. Among the Jews it was regarded\nas a judgment on account of sin, and hence was called \u201cthe stroke,\u201d\n\u201cthe finger of God.\u201d Deep-rooted, ineradicable, deadly, it was looked\nupon as a symbol of sin. By the ritual law, the leper was pronounced\nunclean. Like one already dead, he was shut out from the habitations\nof men. Whatever he touched was unclean. The air was polluted\nby his breath. One who was suspected of having the disease must\npresent himself to the priests, who were to examine and decide his\ncase. If pronounced a leper, he was isolated from his family, cut off\nfrom the congregation of Israel, and was doomed to associate with\nthose only who were similarly afflicted. The law was inflexible in\nits requirement. Even kings and rulers were not exempt. A monarch\nwho was attacked by this terrible disease must yield up the scepter,\nand flee from society.\nAway from his friends and his kindred, the leper must bear the\ncurse of his malady. He was obliged to publish his own calamity, to\nrend his garments, and sound the alarm, warning all to flee from his\ncontaminating presence. The cry, \u201cUnclean! unclean!\u201d coming in\nmournful tones from the lonely exile, was a signal heard with fear\nand abhorrence.\nIn the region of Christ\u2019s ministry, there were many of these\nsufferers, and the news of His work reached them, kindling a gleam\nof hope. But since the days of Elisha the prophet, such a thing had\nnever been known as the cleansing of one upon whom this disease[263]\nhad fastened. They dared not expect Jesus to do for them what He\nhad never done for any man. There was one, however, in whose heart\nfaith began to spring up. Yet the man knew not how to reach Jesus.\n216\n\u201cThou Canst Make Me Clean\u201d 217\nDebarred as he was from contact with his fellow men, how could he\npresent himself to the Healer? And he questioned if Christ would\nheal him. Would He stoop to notice one believed to be suffering\nunder the judgment of God? Would He not, like the Pharisees, and\neven the physicians, pronounce a curse upon him, and warn him to\nflee from the haunts of men? He thought of all that had been told\nhim of Jesus. Not one who had sought His help had been turned\naway. The wretched man determined to find the Saviour. Though\nshut out from the cities, it might be that he could cross His path\nin some byway along the mountain roads, or find Him as He was\nteaching outside the towns. The difficulties were great, but this was\nhis only hope.\nThe leper is guided to the Saviour. Jesus is teaching beside the\nlake, and the people are gathered about Him. Standing afar off, the\nleper catches a few words from the Saviour\u2019s lips. He sees Him\nlaying His hands upon the sick. He sees the lame, the blind, the\nparalytic, and those dying of various maladies rise up in health,\npraising God for their deliverance. Faith strengthens in his heart. He\ndraws nearer and yet nearer to the gathered throng. The restrictions\nlaid upon him, the safety of the people, and the fear with which all\nmen regard him are forgotten. He thinks only of the blessed hope of\nhealing.\nHe is a loathsome spectacle. The disease has made frightful\ninroads, and his decaying body is horrible to look upon. At sight of\nhim the people fall back in terror. They crowd upon one another in\ntheir eagerness to escape from contact with him. Some try to prevent\nhim from approaching Jesus, but in vain. He neither sees nor hears\nthem. Their expressions of loathing are lost upon him. He sees only\nthe Son of God. He hears only the voice that speaks life to the dying.\nPressing to Jesus, he casts himself at His feet with the cry, \u201cLord, if\nThou wilt, Thou canst make me clean.\u201d\nJesus replied, \u201cI will; be thou made clean,\u201d and laid His hand\nupon him. Matthew 8:3, R. V .\nImmediately a change passed over the leper. His flesh became\nhealthy, the nerves sensitive, the muscles firm. The rough, scaly\nsurface peculiar to leprosy disappeared, and a soft glow, like that\nupon the skin of a healthy child, took its place.\nJesus charged the man not to make known the work that had been [264]\n218 The Desire of Ages\nwrought, but straightway to present himself with an offering at the\ntemple. Such an offering could not be accepted until the priests had\nmade examination and pronounced the man wholly free from the\ndisease. However unwilling they might be to perform this service,\nthey could not evade an examination and decision of the case.\nThe words of Scripture show with what urgency Christ enjoined\nupon the man the necessity of silence and prompt action. \u201cHe\nstraitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; and saith unto\nhim, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, show thyself\nto the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses\ncommanded, for a testimony unto them.\u201d Had the priests known the\nfacts concerning the healing of the leper, their hatred of Christ might\nhave led them to render a dishonest sentence. Jesus desired the\nman to present himself at the temple before any rumors concerning\nthe miracle had reached them. Thus an impartial decision could be\nsecured, and the restored leper would be permitted to unite once\nmore with his family and friends.\nThere were other objects which Christ had in view in enjoining\nsilence on the man. The Saviour knew that His enemies were ever\nseeking to limit His work, and to turn the people from Him. He knew\nthat if the healing of the leper were noised abroad, other sufferers\nfrom this terrible disease would crowd about Him, and the cry would\nbe raised that the people would be contaminated by contact with\nthem. Many of the lepers would not so use the gift of health as to\nmake it a blessing to themselves or to others. And by drawing the\nlepers about Him, He would give occasion for the charge that He\nwas breaking down the restrictions of the ritual law. Thus His work\nin preaching the gospel would be hindered.\nThe event justified Christ\u2019s warning. A multitude of people had\nwitnessed the healing of the leper, and they were eager to learn of\nthe priests\u2019 decision. When the man returned to his friends, there\nwas great excitement. Notwithstanding the caution of Jesus, the[265]\nman made no further effort to conceal the fact of his cure. It would\nindeed have been impossible to conceal it, but the leper published\nthe matter abroad. Conceiving that it was only the modesty of Jesus\nwhich laid this restriction upon him, he went about proclaiming\nthe power of this Great Healer. He did not understand that every\nsuch manifestation made the priests and elders more determined to\n\u201cThou Canst Make Me Clean\u201d 219\ndestroy Jesus. The restored man felt that the boon of health was very\nprecious. He rejoiced in the vigor of manhood, and in his restoration\nto his family and society, and felt it impossible to refrain from giving\nglory to the Physician who had made him whole. But his act in\nblazing abroad the matter resulted in hindering the Saviour\u2019s work.\nIt caused the people to flock to Him in such multitudes that He was\nforced for a time to cease His labors.\nEvery act of Christ\u2019s ministry was far-reaching in its purpose. It\ncomprehended more than appeared in the act itself. So in the case\nof the leper. While Jesus ministered to all who came unto Him, He\nyearned to bless those who came not. While He drew the publicans,\nthe heathen, and the Samaritans, He longed to reach the priests and\nteachers who were shut in by prejudice and tradition. He left untried\nno means by which they might be reached. In sending the healed\nleper to the priests, He gave them a testimony calculated to disarm\ntheir prejudices.\nThe Pharisees had asserted that Christ\u2019s teaching was opposed to\nthe law which God had given through Moses; but His direction to the\ncleansed leper to present an offering according to the law disproved\nthis charge. It was sufficient testimony for all who were willing to\nbe convinced.\nThe leaders at Jerusalem had sent out spies to find some pretext\nfor putting Christ to death. He responded by giving them an evidence\nof His love for humanity, His respect for the law, and His power to\ndeliver from sin and death. Thus He bore witness of them: \u201cThey\nhave rewarded Me evil for good, and hatred for My love.\u201d Psalm\n109:5. He who on the mount gave the precept, \u201cLove your enemies,\u201d\nHimself exemplified the principle, not rendering \u201cevil for evil, or\nrailing for railing: but contrariwise blessing.\u201d Matthew 5:44; 1 Peter\n3:9.\nThe same priests who condemned the leper to banishment cer-\ntified his cure. This sentence, publicly pronounced and registered,\nwas a standing testimony for Christ. And as the healed man was rein-\nstated in the congregation of Israel, upon the priests\u2019 own assurance\nthat there was not a taint of the disease upon him, he himself was a [266]\nliving witness for his Benefactor. Joyfully he presented his offering,\nand magnified the name of Jesus. The priests were convinced of\nthe divine power of the Saviour. Opportunity was granted them to\n220 The Desire of Ages\nknow the truth and to be profited by the light. Rejected, it would\npass away, never to return. By many the light was rejected; yet it\nwas not given in vain. Many hearts were moved that for a time made\nno sign. During the Saviour\u2019s life, His mission seemed to call forth\nlittle response of love from the priests and teachers; but after His\nascension \u201ca great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.\u201d\nActs 6:7.\nThe work of Christ in cleansing the leper from his terrible dis-\nease is an illustration of His work in cleansing the soul from sin. The\nman who came to Jesus was \u201cfull of leprosy.\u201d Its deadly poison per-\nmeated his whole body. The disciples sought to prevent their Master\nfrom touching him; for he who touched a leper became himself\nunclean. But in laying His hand upon the leper, Jesus received no\ndefilement. His touch imparted life-giving power. The leprosy was\ncleansed. Thus it is with the leprosy of sin,\u2014deep-rooted, deadly,\nand impossible to be cleansed by human power. \u201cThe whole head\nis sick, and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot even\nunto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises,\nand putrefying sores.\u201d Isaiah 1:5, 6. But Jesus, coming to dwell in\nhumanity, receives no pollution. His presence has healing virtue\nfor the sinner. Whoever will fall at His feet, saying in faith, \u201cLord,\nif Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean,\u201d shall hear the answer, \u201cI\nwill; be thou made clean.\u201d Matthew 8:2, 3, R. V .\nIn some instances of healing, Jesus did not at once grant the\nblessing sought. But in the case of leprosy, no sooner was the appeal\nmade than it was granted. When we pray for earthly blessings, the\nanswer to our prayer may be delayed, or God may give us something\nother than we ask, but not so when we ask for deliverance from\nsin. It is His will to cleanse us from sin, to make us His children,\nand to enable us to live a holy life. Christ \u201cgave Himself for our\nsins, that He might deliver us from this present evil world, according\nto the will of God and our Father.\u201d Galatians 1:4. And \u201cthis is the\nconfidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask anything according to\nHis will, He heareth us: and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever\nwe ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.\u201d\n1 John 5:14, 15. \u201cIf we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to\nforgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\u201d 1\nJohn 1:9.\n\u201cThou Canst Make Me Clean\u201d 221\nIn the healing of the paralytic at Capernaum, Christ again taught [267]\nthe same truth. It was to manifest His power to forgive sins that\nthe miracle was performed. And the healing of the paralytic also\nillustrates other precious truths. It is full of hope and encouragement,\nand from its connection with the caviling Pharisees it has a lesson\nof warning as well.\nLike the leper, this paralytic had lost all hope of recovery. His\ndisease was the result of a life of sin, and his sufferings were embit-\ntered by remorse. He had long before appealed to the Pharisees and\ndoctors, hoping for relief from mental suffering and physical pain.\nBut they coldly pronounced him incurable, and abandoned him to\nthe wrath of God. The Pharisees regarded affliction as an evidence\nof divine displeasure, and they held themselves aloof from the sick\nand the needy. Yet often these very ones who exalted themselves as\nholy were more guilty than the sufferers they condemned.\nThe palsied man was entirely helpless, and, seeing no prospect\nof aid from any quarter, he had sunk into despair. Then he heard of\nthe wonderful works of Jesus. He was told that others as sinful and\nhelpless as he had been healed; even lepers had been cleansed. And\nthe friends who reported these things encouraged him to believe that\nhe too might be cured if he could be carried to Jesus. But his hope\nfell when he remembered how the disease had been brought upon\nhim. He feared that the pure Physician would not tolerate him in His\npresence.\nYet it was not physical restoration he desired so much as relief\nfrom the burden of sin. If he could see Jesus, and receive the assur-\nance of forgiveness and peace with Heaven, he would be content to\nlive or die, according to God\u2019s will. The cry of the dying man was,\nOh that I might come into His presence! There was no time to lose;\nalready his wasted flesh was showing signs of decay. He besought\nhis friends to carry him on his bed to Jesus, and this they gladly\nundertook to do. But so dense was the crowd that had assembled in\nand about the house where the Saviour was, that it was impossible\nfor the sick man and his friends to reach Him, or even to come within\nhearing of His voice.\nJesus was teaching in the house of Peter. According to their\ncustom, His disciples sat close about Him, and \u201cthere were Pharisees\nand doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every\n222 The Desire of Ages\ntown of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem.\u201d These had come as\nspies, seeking an accusation against Jesus. Outside of these officials\nthronged the promiscuous multitude, the eager, the reverent, the\ncurious, and the unbelieving. Different nationalities and all grades[268]\nof society were represented. \u201cAnd the power of the Lord was present\nto heal.\u201d The Spirit of life brooded over the assembly, but Pharisees\nand doctors did not discern its presence. They felt no sense of need,\nand the healing was not for them. \u201cHe hath filled the hungry with\ngood things; and the rich He hath sent empty away.\u201d Luke 1:53.\nAgain and again the bearers of the paralytic tried to push their\nway through the crowd, but in vain. The sick man looked about\nhim in unutterable anguish. When the longed-for help was so near,\nhow could he relinquish hope? At his suggestion his friends bore\nhim to the top of the house and, breaking up the roof, let him down\nat the feet of Jesus. The discourse was interrupted. The Saviour\nlooked upon the mournful countenance, and saw the pleading eyes\nfixed upon Him. He understood the case; He had drawn to Himself\nthat perplexed and doubting spirit. While the paralytic was yet at\nhome, the Saviour had brought conviction to his conscience. When\nhe repented of his sins, and believed in the power of Jesus to make\nhim whole, the life-giving mercies of the Saviour had first blessed\nhis longing heart. Jesus had watched the first glimmer of faith grow\ninto a belief that He was the sinner\u2019s only helper, and had seen it\ngrow stronger with every effort to come into His presence.\nNow, in words that fell like music on the sufferer\u2019s ear, the\nSaviour said, \u201cSon, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.\u201d\nThe burden of despair rolls from the sick man\u2019s soul; the peace\nof forgiveness rests upon his spirit, and shines out upon his counte-\nnance. His physical pain is gone, and his whole being is transformed.\nThe helpless paralytic is healed! the guilty sinner is pardoned!\nIn simple faith he accepted the words of Jesus as the boon of\nnew life. He urged no further request, but lay in blissful silence, too\nhappy for words. The light of heaven irradiated his countenance,\nand the people looked with awe upon the scene.\nThe rabbis had waited anxiously to see what disposition Christ\nwould make of this case. They recollected how the man had appealed\nto them for help, and they had refused him hope or sympathy. Not\nsatisfied with this, they had declared that he was suffering the curse\n\u201cThou Canst Make Me Clean\u201d 223\nof God for his sins. These things came fresh to their minds when\nthey saw the sick man before them. They marked the interest with\nwhich all were watching the scene, and they felt a terrible fear of\nlosing their own influence over the people.\nThese dignitaries did not exchange words together, but looking [269]\ninto one another\u2019s faces they read the same thought in each, that\nsomething must be done to arrest the tide of feeling. Jesus had\ndeclared that the sins of the paralytic were forgiven. The Pharisees\ncaught at these words as blasphemy, and conceived that they could\npresent this as a sin worthy of death. They said in their hearts, \u201cHe\nblasphemeth: who can forgive sins but One, even God?\u201d Mark 2:7,",

      "text": "Fixing His glance upon them, beneath which they cowered, and\ndrew back, Jesus said, \u201cWherefore think ye evil in your hearts? For\nwhether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise,\nand walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on\nearth to forgive sins,\u201d He said, turning to the paralytic, \u201cArise, take\nup thy bed, and go unto thine house.\u201d\nThen he who had been borne on a litter to Jesus rises to his\nfeet with the elasticity and strength of youth. The life-giving blood\nbounds through his veins. Every organ of his body springs into sud-\nden activity. The glow of health succeeds the pallor of approaching\ndeath. \u201cAnd immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth\nbefore them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified\nGod, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.\u201d\nOh, wondrous love of Christ, stooping to heal the guilty and the\nafflicted! Divinity sorrowing over and soothing the ills of suffering\nhumanity! Oh, marvelous power thus displayed to the children of\nmen! Who can doubt the message of salvation? Who can slight the\nmercies of a compassionate Redeemer?\nIt required nothing less than creative power to restore health to\nthat decaying body. The same voice that spoke life to man created\nfrom the dust of the earth had spoken life to the dying paralytic. [270]\nAnd the same power that gave life to the body had renewed the\nheart. He who at the creation \u201cspake, and it was,\u201d who \u201ccommanded,\nand it stood fast,\u201d (Psalm 33:9), had spoken life to the soul dead in\ntrespasses and sins. The healing of the body was an evidence of the\npower that had renewed the heart. Christ bade the paralytic arise and\n224 The Desire of Ages\nwalk, \u201cthat ye may know,\u201d He said, \u201cthat the Son of man hath power\non earth to forgive sins.\u201d\nThe paralytic found in Christ healing for both the soul and the\nbody. The spiritual healing was followed by physical restoration.\nThis lesson should not be overlooked. There are today thousands\nsuffering from physical disease, who, like the paralytic, are longing\nfor the message, \u201cThy sins are forgiven.\u201d The burden of sin, with its\nunrest and unsatisfied desires, is the foundation of their maladies.\nThey can find no relief until they come to the Healer of the soul. The\npeace which He alone can give, would impart vigor to the mind, and\nhealth to the body.\nJesus came to \u201cdestroy the works of the devil.\u201d \u201cIn Him was\nlife,\u201d and He says, \u201cI am come that they might have life, and that\nthey might have it more abundantly.\u201d He is \u201ca quickening spirit.\u201d 1\nJohn 3:8; John 1:4; 10:10; 1 Corinthians 15:45. And He still has\nthe same life-giving power as when on earth He healed the sick, and\nspoke forgiveness to the sinner. He \u201cforgiveth all thine iniquities,\u201d\nHe \u201chealeth all thy diseases.\u201d Psalm 103:3.\nThe effect produced upon the people by the healing of the par-\nalytic was as if heaven had opened, and revealed the glories of the\nbetter world. As the man who had been cured passed through the\nmultitude, blessing God at every step, and bearing his burden as if it\nwere a feather\u2019s weight, the people fell back to give him room, and\nwith awe-stricken faces gazed upon him, whispering softly among\nthemselves, \u201cWe have seen strange things today.\u201d\nThe Pharisees were dumb with amazement and overwhelmed\nwith defeat. They saw that here was no opportunity for their jealousy\nto inflame the multitude. The wonderful work wrought upon the man\nwhom they had given over to the wrath of God had so impressed the\npeople that the rabbis were for the time forgotten. They saw that\nChrist possessed a power which they had ascribed to God alone; yet\nthe gentle dignity of His manner was in marked contrast to their own\nhaughty bearing. They were disconcerted and abashed, recognizing,\nbut not confessing, the presence of a superior being. The stronger\nthe evidence that Jesus had power on earth to forgive sins, the more\nfirmly they entrenched themselves in unbelief. From the home of[271]\nPeter, where they had seen the paralytic restored by His word, they\nwent away to invent new schemes for silencing the Son of God.\n\u201cThou Canst Make Me Clean\u201d 225\nPhysical disease, however malignant and deep-seated, was\nhealed by the power of Christ; but the disease of the soul took\na firmer hold upon those who closed their eyes against the light.\nLeprosy and palsy were not so terrible as bigotry and unbelief.\nIn the home of the healed paralytic there was great rejoicing\nwhen he returned to his family, carrying with ease the couch upon\nwhich he had been slowly borne from their presence but a short\ntime before. They gathered round with tears of joy, scarcely daring\nto believe their eyes. He stood before them in the full vigor of\nmanhood. Those arms that they had seen lifeless were quick to obey\nhis will. The flesh that had been shrunken and leaden-hued was\nnow fresh and ruddy. He walked with a firm, free step. Joy and\nhope were written in every lineament of his countenance; and an\nexpression of purity and peace had taken the place of the marks of\nsin and suffering. Glad thanksgiving went up from that home, and\nGod was glorified through His Son, who had restored hope to the\nhopeless, and strength to the stricken one. This man and his family\nwere ready to lay down their lives for Jesus. No doubt dimmed their\nfaith, no unbelief marred their fealty to Him who had brought light\ninto their darkened home.\nChapter 28\u2014Levi-Matthew[272]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 9:9-17; Mark 2:14-22; Luke\n5:27-39.\nOf the Roman officials in Palestine, none were more hated than\nthe publicans. The fact that the taxes were imposed by a foreign\npower was a continual irritation to the Jews, being a reminder that\ntheir independence had departed. And the taxgatherers were not\nmerely the instruments of Roman oppression; they were extortioners\non their own account, enriching themselves at the expense of the\npeople. A Jew who accepted this office at the hands of the Romans\nwas looked upon as betraying the honor of his nation. He was\ndespised as an apostate, and was classed with the vilest of society.\nTo this class belonged Levi-Matthew, who, after the four dis-\nciples at Gennesaret, was the next to be called to Christ\u2019s service.\nThe Pharisees had judged Matthew according to his employment,\nbut Jesus saw in this man a heart open for the reception of truth.\nMatthew had listened to the Saviour\u2019s teaching. As the convicting\nSpirit of God revealed his sinfulness, he longed to seek help from\nChrist; but he was accustomed to the exclusiveness of the rabbis,\nand had no thought that this Great Teacher would notice him.\nSitting at his toll booth one day, the publican saw Jesus ap-[273]\nproaching. Great was his astonishment to hear the words addressed\nto himself, \u201cFollow Me.\u201d\nMatthew \u201cleft all, rose up, and followed Him.\u201d There was no\nhesitation, no questioning, no thought of the lucrative business to be\nexchanged for poverty and hardship. It was enough for him that he\nwas to be with Jesus, that he might listen to His words, and unite\nwith Him in His work.\nSo it was with the disciples previously called. When Jesus bade\nPeter and his companions follow Him, immediately they left their\nboats and nets. Some of these disciples had friends dependent on\nthem for support; but when they received the Saviour\u2019s invitation,\n226\nLevi-Matthew 227\nthey did not hesitate, and inquire, How shall I live, and sustain my\nfamily? They were obedient to the call; and when afterward Jesus\nasked them, \u201cWhen I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes,\nlacked ye anything?\u201d they could answer, \u201cNothing.\u201d Luke 22:35.\nTo Matthew in his wealth, and to Andrew and Peter in their\npoverty, the same test was brought; the same consecration was made\nby each. At the moment of success, when the nets were filled with\nfish, and the impulses of the old life were strongest, Jesus asked\nthe disciples at the sea to leave all for the work of the gospel. So\nevery soul is tested as to whether the desire for temporal good or for\nfellowship with Christ is strongest.\nPrinciple is always exacting. No man can succeed in the service\nof God unless his whole heart is in the work and he counts all things\nbut loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. No man\nwho makes any reserve can be the disciple of Christ, much less can\nhe be His colaborer. When men appreciate the great salvation, the\nself-sacrifice seen in Christ\u2019s life will be seen in theirs. Wherever\nHe leads the way, they will rejoice to follow.\nThe calling of Matthew to be one of Christ\u2019s disciples excited\ngreat indignation. For a religious teacher to choose a publican as\none of his immediate attendants was an offense against the religious,\nsocial, and national customs. By appealing to the prejudices of the\npeople the Pharisees hoped to turn the current of popular feeling\nagainst Jesus.\nAmong the publicans a widespread interest was created. Their\nhearts were drawn toward the divine Teacher. In the joy of his new\ndiscipleship, Matthew longed to bring his former associates to Jesus.\nAccordingly he made a feast at his own house, and called together [274]\nhis relatives and friends. Not only were publicans included, but\nmany others who were of doubtful reputation, and were proscribed\nby their more scrupulous neighbors.\nThe entertainment was given in honor of Jesus, and He did not\nhesitate to accept the courtesy. He well knew that this would give\noffense to the Pharisaic party, and would also compromise Him in\nthe eyes of the people. But no question of policy could influence His\nmovements. With Him external distinctions weighed nothing. That\nwhich appealed to His heart was a soul thirsting for the water of life.\n228 The Desire of Ages\nJesus sat as an honored guest at the table of the publicans, by\nHis sympathy and social kindliness showing that He recognized\nthe dignity of humanity; and men longed to become worthy of His\nconfidence. Upon their thirsty hearts His words fell with blessed,\nlife-giving power. New impulses were awakened, and the possibility\nof a new life opened to these outcasts of society.\nAt such gatherings as this, not a few were impressed by the\nSaviour\u2019s teaching who did not acknowledge Him until after His\nascension. When the Holy Spirit was poured out, and three thousand[275]\nwere converted in a day, there were among them many who first\nheard the truth at the table of the publicans, and some of these\nbecame messengers of the gospel. To Matthew himself the example\nof Jesus at the feast was a constant lesson. The despised publican\nbecame one of the most devoted evangelists, in his own ministry\nfollowing closely in his Master\u2019s steps.\nWhen the rabbis learned of the presence of Jesus at Matthew\u2019s\nfeast, they seized the opportunity of accusing Him. But they chose\nto work through the disciples. By arousing their prejudices they\nhoped to alienate them from their Master. It was their policy to\naccuse Christ to the disciples, and the disciples to Christ, aiming\ntheir arrows where they would be most likely to wound. This is the\nway in which Satan has worked ever since the disaffection in heaven;\nand all who try to cause discord and alienation are actuated by his\nspirit.\n\u201cWhy eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?\u201d ques-\ntioned the envious rabbis.\nJesus did not wait for His disciples to answer the charge, but\nHimself replied: \u201cThey that be whole need not a physician, but they\nthat are sick. But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have\nmercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous,\nbut sinners to repentance.\u201d The Pharisees claimed to be spiritually\nwhole, and therefore in no need of a physician, while they regarded\nthe publicans and Gentiles as perishing from diseases of the soul.\nThen was it not His work, as a physician, to go to the very class that\nneeded His help?\nBut although the Pharisees thought so highly of themselves, they\nwere really in a worse condition than the ones they despised. The\npublicans were less bigoted and self-sufficient, and thus were more\nLevi-Matthew 229\nopen to the influence of truth. Jesus said to the rabbis, \u201cGo ye and\nlearn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.\u201d Thus\nHe showed that while they claimed to expound the word of God,\nthey were wholly ignorant of its spirit.\nThe Pharisees were silenced for the time, but only became more\ndetermined in their enmity. They next sought out the disciples of\nJohn the Baptist, and tried to set them against the Saviour. These\nPharisees had not accepted the mission of the Baptist. They had\npointed in scorn to his abstemious life, his simple habits, his coarse\ngarments, and had declared him a fanatic. Because he denounced\ntheir hypocrisy, they had resisted his words, and had tried to stir up\nthe people against him. The Spirit of God had moved upon the hearts [276]\nof these scorners, convicting them of sin; but they had rejected the\ncounsel of God, and had declared that John was possessed of a devil.\nNow when Jesus came mingling with the people, eating and\ndrinking at their tables, they accused Him of being a glutton and a\nwinebibber. The very ones who made this charge were themselves\nguilty. As God is misrepresented, and clothed by Satan with his own\nattributes, so the Lord\u2019s messengers were falsified by these wicked\nmen.\nThe Pharisees would not consider that Jesus was eating with\npublicans and sinners in order to bring the light of heaven to those\nwho sat in darkness. They would not see that every word dropped\nby the divine Teacher was a living seed that would germinate and\nbear fruit to the glory of God. They had determined not to accept the\nlight; and although they had opposed the mission of the Baptist, they\nwere now ready to court the friendship of his disciples, hoping to\nsecure their co-operation against Jesus. They represented that Jesus\nwas setting at nought the ancient traditions; and they contrasted the\naustere piety of the Baptist with the course of Jesus in feasting with\npublicans and sinners.\nThe disciples of John were at this time in great sorrow. It was\nbefore their visit to Jesus with John\u2019s message. Their beloved teacher\nwas in prison, and they passed their days in mourning. And Jesus\nwas making no effort to release John, and even appeared to cast\ndiscredit on his teaching. If John had been sent by God, why did\nJesus and His disciples pursue a course so widely different?\n230 The Desire of Ages\nThe disciples of John had not a clear understanding of Christ\u2019s\nwork; they thought there might be some foundation for the charges\nof the Pharisees. They observed many of the rules prescribed by\nthe rabbis, and even hoped to be justified by the works of the law.\nFasting was practiced by the Jews as an act of merit, and the most\nrigid among them fasted two days in every week. The Pharisees and\nJohn\u2019s disciples were fasting when the latter came to Jesus with the\ninquiry, \u201cWhy do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but Thy disciples\nfast not?\u201d\nVery tenderly Jesus answered them. He did not try to correct\ntheir erroneous conception of fasting, but only to set them right in\nregard to His own mission. And He did this by employing the same\nfigure that the Baptist himself had used in his testimony to Jesus.\nJohn had said, \u201cHe that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the\nfriend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth\ngreatly because of the bridegroom\u2019s voice: this my joy therefore is[277]\nfulfilled.\u201d John 3:29. The disciples of John could not fail to recall\nthese words of their teacher, as, taking up the illustration, Jesus\nsaid, \u201cCan ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the\nbridegroom is with them?\u201d\nThe Prince of heaven was among His people. The greatest gift\nof God had been given to the world. Joy to the poor; for Christ had\ncome to make them heirs of His kingdom. Joy to the rich; for He\nwould teach them how to secure eternal riches. Joy to the ignorant;\nHe would make them wise unto salvation. Joy to the learned; He\nwould open to them deeper mysteries than they had ever fathomed;\ntruths that had been hidden from the foundation of the world would\nbe opened to men by the Saviour\u2019s mission.\nJohn the Baptist had rejoiced to behold the Saviour. What occa-\nsion for rejoicing had the disciples who were privileged to walk and\ntalk with the Majesty of heaven! This was not a time for them to\nmourn and fast. They must open their hearts to receive the light of\nHis glory, that they might shed light upon those who sat in darkness\nand in the shadow of death.\nIt was a bright picture which the words of Christ had called up,\nbut across it lay a heavy shadow, which His eye alone discerned.\n\u201cThe days will come,\u201d He said, \u201cwhen the bridegroom shall be taken\naway from them, and then shall they fast in those days.\u201d When they\nLevi-Matthew 231\nshould see their Lord betrayed and crucified, the disciples would\nmourn and fast. In His last words to them in the upper chamber,\nHe said, \u201cA little while, and ye shall not see Me: and again, a little\nwhile, and ye shall see Me. Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye\nshall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be\nsorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.\u201d John 16:19, 20.\nWhen He should come forth from the tomb, their sorrow would\nbe turned to joy. After His ascension He was to be absent in person;\nbut through the Comforter He would still be with them, and they\nwere not to spend their time in mourning. This was what Satan\nwanted. He desired them to give the world the impression that they\nhad been deceived and disappointed; but by faith they were to look\nto the sanctuary above, where Jesus was ministering for them; they\nwere to open their hearts to the Holy Spirit, His representative, and\nto rejoice in the light of His presence. Yet days of temptation and\ntrial would come, when they would be brought into conflict with\nthe rulers of this world, and the leaders of the kingdom of darkness;\nwhen Christ was not personally with them, and they failed to discern [278]\nthe Comforter, then it would be more fitting for them to fast.\nThe Pharisees sought to exalt themselves by their rigorous ob-\nservance of forms, while their hearts were filled with envy and strife.\n\u201cBehold,\u201d says the Scripture, \u201cye fast for strife and debate, and to\nsmite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day,\nto make your voice to be heard on high. Is it such a fast that I have\nchosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his\nhead as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt\nthou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?\u201d Isaiah 58:4,\n5.\nThe true fast is no mere formal service. The Scripture describes\nthe fast that God has chosen,\u2014\u201cto loose the bands of wickedness, to\nundo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye\nbreak every yoke;\u201d to \u201cdraw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy\nthe afflicted soul.\u201d Isaiah 58:6, 10. Here is set forth the very spirit\nand character of the work of Christ. His whole life was a sacrifice\nof Himself for the saving of the world. Whether fasting in the\nwilderness of temptation or eating with the publicans at Matthew\u2019s\nfeast, He was giving His life for the redemption of the lost. Not\nin idle mourning, in mere bodily humiliation and multitudinous\n232 The Desire of Ages\nsacrifices, is the true spirit of devotion manifested, but it is shown in\nthe surrender of self in willing service to God and man.\nContinuing His answer to the disciples of John, Jesus spoke a\nparable, saying, \u201cNo man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an\nold; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that\nwas taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.\u201d The message\nof John the Baptist was not to be interwoven with tradition and\nsuperstition. An attempt to blend the pretense of the Pharisees with\nthe devotion of John would only make more evident the breach\nbetween them.\nNor could the principles of Christ\u2019s teaching be united with the\nforms of Pharisaism. Christ was not to close up the breach that\nhad been made by the teachings of John. He would make more\ndistinct the separation between the old and the new. Jesus further\nillustrated this fact, saying, \u201cNo man putteth new wine into old\nbottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled,\nand the bottles shall perish.\u201d The skin bottles which were used\nas vessels to contain the new wine, after a time became dry and\nbrittle, and were then worthless to serve the same purpose again.\nIn this familiar illustration Jesus presented the condition of the\nJewish leaders. Priests and scribes and rulers were fixed in a rut of[279]\nceremonies and traditions. Their hearts had become contracted, like\nthe dried-up wine skins to which He had compared them. While\nthey remained satisfied with a legal religion, it was impossible for\nthem to become the depositaries of the living truth of heaven. They\nthought their own righteousness all-sufficient, and did not desire that\na new element should be brought into their religion. The good will of\nGod to men they did not accept as something apart from themselves.\nThey connected it with their own merit because of their good works.\nThe faith that works by love and purifies the soul could find no place\nfor union with the religion of the Pharisees, made up of ceremonies\nand the injunctions of men. The effort to unite the teachings of Jesus\nwith the established religion would be vain. The vital truth of God,\nlike fermenting wine, would burst the old, decaying bottles of the\nPharisaical tradition.\nThe Pharisees thought themselves too wise to need instruction,\ntoo righteous to need salvation, too highly honored to need the honor\nthat comes from Christ. The Saviour turned away from them to find\nLevi-Matthew 233\nothers who would receive the message of heaven. In the untutored\nfishermen, in the publican at the market place, in the woman of\nSamaria, in the common people who heard Him gladly, He found\nHis new bottles for the new wine. The instrumentalities to be used\nin the gospel work are those souls who gladly receive the light\nwhich God sends them. These are His agencies for imparting the\nknowledge of truth to the world. If through the grace of Christ His\npeople will become new bottles, He will fill them with new wine.\nThe teaching of Christ, though it was represented by the new\nwine, was not a new doctrine, but the revelation of that which had\nbeen taught from the beginning. But to the Pharisees the truth of\nGod had lost its original significance and beauty. To them Christ\u2019s\nteaching was new in almost every respect, and it was unrecognized\nand unacknowledged.\nJesus pointed out the power of false teaching to destroy the\nappreciation and desire for truth. \u201cNo man,\u201d He said, \u201chaving drunk\nold wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.\u201d\nAll the truth that has been given to the world through patriarchs and\nprophets shone out in new beauty in the words of Christ. But the\nscribes and Pharisees had no desire for the precious new wine. Until\nemptied of the old traditions, customs, and practices, they had no\nplace in mind or heart for the teachings of Christ. They clung to the\ndead forms, and turned away from the living truth and the power of\nGod.\nIt was this that proved the ruin of the Jews, and it will prove the [280]\nruin of many souls in our own day. Thousands are making the same\nmistake as did the Pharisees whom Christ reproved at Matthew\u2019s\nfeast. Rather than give up some cherished idea, or discard some idol\nof opinion, many refuse the truth which comes down from the Father\nof light. They trust in self, and depend upon their own wisdom, and\ndo not realize their spiritual poverty. They insist on being saved in\nsome way by which they may perform some important work. When\nthey see that there is no way of weaving self into the work, they\nreject the salvation provided.\nA legal religion can never lead souls to Christ; for it is a loveless,\nChristless religion. Fasting or prayer that is actuated by a self-\njustifying spirit is an abomination in the sight of God. The solemn\nassembly for worship, the round of religious ceremonies, the external\n234 The Desire of Ages\nhumiliation, the imposing sacrifice, proclaim that the doer of these\nthings regards himself as righteous, and as entitled to heaven; but it\nis all a deception. Our own works can never purchase salvation.\nAs it was in the days of Christ, so it is now; the Pharisees do\nnot know their spiritual destitution. To them comes the message,\n\u201cBecause thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and\nhave need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and\nmiserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy\nof Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white\nraiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy\nnakedness do not appear.\u201d Revelation 3:17, 18. Faith and love are\nthe gold tried in the fire. But with many the gold has become dim,\nand the rich treasure has been lost. The righteousness of Christ\nis to them as a robe unworn, a fountain untouched. To them it is\nsaid, \u201cI have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first\nlove. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent,\nand do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and\nwill remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\u201d\nRevelation 2:4, 5.\n\u201cThe sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite\nheart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.\u201d Psalm 51:17. Man must be\nemptied of self before he can be, in the fullest sense, a believer\nin Jesus. When self is renounced, then the Lord can make man a\nnew creature. New bottles can contain the new wine. The love of\nChrist will animate the believer with new life. In him who looks\nunto the Author and Finisher of our faith the character of Christ will\nbe manifest.\nChapter 29\u2014The Sabbath [281]\nThe Sabbath was hallowed at the creation. As ordained for man,\nit had its origin when \u201cthe morning stars sang together, and all the\nsons of God shouted for joy.\u201d Job 38:7. Peace brooded over the\nworld; for earth was in harmony with heaven. \u201cGod saw everything\nthat He had made, and, behold, it was very good;\u201d and He rested in\nthe joy of His completed work. Genesis 1:31.\nBecause He had rested upon the Sabbath, \u201cGod blessed the\nseventh day, and sanctified it,\u201d\u2014set it apart to a holy use. He gave it\nto Adam as a day of rest. It was a memorial of the work of creation,\nand thus a sign of God\u2019s power and His love. The Scripture says, \u201cHe\nhath made His wonderful works to be remembered.\u201d \u201cThe things that\nare made,\u201d declare \u201cthe invisible things of Him since the creation of\nthe world,\u201d \u201ceven His everlasting power and divinity.\u201d Genesis 2:3;\nPsalm 111:4; Romans 1:20, R. V .\nAll things were created by the Son of God. \u201cIn the beginning\nwas the Word, and the Word was with God.... All things were made\nby Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made.\u201d\nJohn 1:1-3. And since the Sabbath is a memorial of the work of\ncreation, it is a token of the love and power of Christ.\nThe Sabbath calls our thoughts to nature, and brings us into\ncommunion with the Creator. In the song of the bird, the sighing of\nthe trees, and the music of the sea, we still may hear His voice who\ntalked with Adam in Eden in the cool of the day. And as we behold [282]\nHis power in nature we find comfort, for the word that created all\nthings is that which speaks life to the soul. He \u201cwho commanded\nthe light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give\nthe light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus\nChrist.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:6.\nIt was this thought that awoke the song,\u2014\n\u201cThou, Lord, hast made me glad through Thy work;\nI will triumph in the works of Thy hands.\n235\n236 The Desire of Ages\nO Lord, how great are Thy works!\nAnd Thy thoughts are very deep.\u201d\nPsalm 92:4, 5.\nAnd the Holy Spirit through the prophet Isaiah declares: \u201cTo\nwhom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare\nunto Him? ... Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not\nbeen told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the\nfoundations of the earth? It is He that sitteth upon the circle of the\nearth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth\nout the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to\ndwell in.... To whom then will ye liken Me, or shall I be equal?\nsaith the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who\nhath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: He\ncalleth them all by names by the greatness of His might, for that He\nis strong in power; not one faileth. Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and\nspeakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment\nis passed over from my God? Hast thou not known? hast thou not\nheard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of\nthe earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? ... He giveth power to the\nfaint; and to them that have no might He increaseth strength.\u201d \u201cFear[283]\nthou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I\nwill strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee\nwith the right hand of My righteousness.\u201d \u201cLook unto Me, and be\nye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none\nelse.\u201d This is the message written in nature, which the Sabbath is\nappointed to keep in memory. When the Lord bade Israel hallow His\nSabbaths, He said, \u201cThey shall be a sign between Me and you, that\nye may know that I am Jehovah your God.\u201d Isaiah 40:18-29; 41:10;\n45:22; Ezekiel 20:20, R. V .\nThe Sabbath was embodied in the law given from Sinai; but it\nwas not then first made known as a day of rest. The people of Israel\nhad a knowledge of it before they came to Sinai. On the way thither\nthe Sabbath was kept. When some profaned it, the Lord reproved\nthem, saying, \u201cHow long refuse ye to keep My commandments and\nMy laws?\u201d Exodus 16:28.\nThe Sabbath was not for Israel merely, but for the world. It had\nbeen made known to man in Eden, and, like the other precepts of\nSabbath 237\nthe Decalogue, it is of imperishable obligation. Of that law of which\nthe fourth commandment forms a part, Christ declares, \u201cTill heaven\nand earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in nowise pass from the\nlaw.\u201d So long as the heavens and the earth endure, the Sabbath will\ncontinue as a sign of the Creator\u2019s power. And when Eden shall\nbloom on earth again, God\u2019s holy rest day will be honored by all\nbeneath the sun. \u201cFrom one Sabbath to another\u201d the inhabitants of\nthe glorified new earth shall go up \u201cto worship before Me, saith the\nLord.\u201d Matthew 5:18; Isaiah 66:23.\nNo other institution which was committed to the Jews tended\nso fully to distinguish them from surrounding nations as did the\nSabbath. God designed that its observance should designate them\nas His worshipers. It was to be a token of their separation from\nidolatry, and their connection with the true God. But in order to\nkeep the Sabbath holy, men must themselves be holy. Through faith\nthey must become partakers of the righteousness of Christ. When\nthe command was given to Israel, \u201cRemember the Sabbath day, to\nkeep it holy,\u201d the Lord said also to them, \u201cYe shall be holy men unto\nMe.\u201d Exodus 20:8; 22:31. Only thus could the Sabbath distinguish\nIsrael as the worshipers of God.\nAs the Jews departed from God, and failed to make the righteous-\nness of Christ their own by faith, the Sabbath lost its significance to\nthem. Satan was seeking to exalt himself and to draw men away from\nChrist, and he worked to pervert the Sabbath, because it is the sign\nof the power of Christ. The Jewish leaders accomplished the will of [284]\nSatan by surrounding God\u2019s rest day with burdensome requirements.\nIn the days of Christ the Sabbath had become so perverted that its\nobservance reflected the character of selfish and arbitrary men rather\nthan the character of the loving heavenly Father. The rabbis virtually\nrepresented God as giving laws which it was impossible for men to\nobey. They led the people to look upon God as a tyrant, and to think\nthat the observance of the Sabbath, as He required it, made men\nhard-hearted and cruel. It was the work of Christ to clear away these\nmisconceptions. Although the rabbis followed Him with merciless\nhostility, He did not even appear to conform to their requirements,\nbut went straight forward, keeping the Sabbath according to the law\nof God.\n238 The Desire of Ages\nUpon one Sabbath day, as the Saviour and His disciples returned\nfrom the place of worship, they passed through a field of ripening\ngrain. Jesus had continued His work to a late hour, and while passing\nthrough the fields, the disciples began to gather the heads of grain,\nand to eat the kernels after rubbing them in their hands. On any\nother day this act would have excited no comment, for one passing\nthrough a field of grain, an orchard, or a vineyard, was at liberty to\ngather what he desired to eat. See Deuteronomy 23:24, 25. But to\ndo this on the Sabbath was held to be an act of desecration. Not only\nwas the gathering of the grain a kind of reaping, but the rubbing of\nit in the hands was a kind of threshing. Thus, in the opinion of the\nrabbis, there was a double offense.\nThe spies at once complained to Jesus, saying, \u201cBehold, Thy\ndisciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day.\u201d\nWhen accused of Sabbathbreaking at Bethesda, Jesus defended\nHimself by affirming His Sonship to God, and declaring that He\nworked in harmony with the Father. Now that the disciples are\nattacked, He cites His accusers to examples from the Old Testament,[285]\nacts performed on the Sabbath by those who were in the service of\nGod.\nThe Jewish teachers prided themselves on their knowledge of\nthe Scriptures, and in the Saviour\u2019s answer there was an implied\nrebuke for their ignorance of the Sacred Writings. \u201cHave ye not\nread so much as this,\u201d He said, \u201cwhat David did, when himself was\nan hungered, and they which were with him; how he went into the\nhouse of God, and did take and eat the shewbread,... which it is not\nlawful to eat but for the priests alone?\u201d \u201cAnd He said unto them, The\nSabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.\u201d \u201cHave ye\nnot read in the law, how that on the Sabbath days the priests in the\ntemple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless? But I say unto you,\nThat in this place is one greater than the temple.\u201d \u201cThe Son of man\nis Lord also of the Sabbath.\u201d Luke 6:3, 4; Mark 2:27, 28; Matthew\n12:5, 6.\nIf it was right for David to satisfy his hunger by eating of the\nbread that had been set apart to a holy use, then it was right for the\ndisciples to supply their need by plucking the grain upon the sacred\nhours of the Sabbath. Again, the priests in the temple performed\ngreater labor on the Sabbath than upon other days. The same labor\nSabbath 239\nin secular business would be sinful; but the work of the priests was\nin the service of God. They were performing those rites that pointed\nto the redeeming power of Christ, and their labor was in harmony\nwith the object of the Sabbath. But now Christ Himself had come.\nThe disciples, in doing the work of Christ, were engaged in God\u2019s\nservice, and that which was necessary for the accomplishment of\nthis work it was right to do on the Sabbath day.\nChrist would teach His disciples and His enemies that the service\nof God is first of all. The object of God\u2019s work in this world is the\nredemption of man; therefore that which is necessary to be done on\nthe Sabbath in the accomplishment of this work is in accord with the\nSabbath law. Jesus then crowned His argument by declaring Himself\nthe \u201cLord of the Sabbath,\u201d\u2014One above all question and above all\nlaw. This infinite Judge acquits the disciples of blame, appealing to\nthe very statutes they are accused of violating.\nJesus did not let the matter pass without administering a rebuke to\nHis enemies. He declared that in their blindness they had mistaken\nthe object of the Sabbath. He said, \u201cIf ye had known what this\nmeaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have\ncondemned the guiltless.\u201d Matthew 12:7. Their many heartless rites\ncould not supply the lack of that truthful integrity and tender love [286]\nwhich will ever characterize the true worshiper of God.\nAgain Christ reiterated the truth that the sacrifices were in them-\nselves of no value. They were a means, and not an end. Their object\nwas to direct men to the Saviour, and thus to bring them into har-\nmony with God. It is the service of love that God values. When this\nis lacking, the mere round of ceremony is an offense to Him. So\nwith the Sabbath. It was designed to bring men into communion\nwith God; but when the mind was absorbed with wearisome rites,\nthe object of the Sabbath was thwarted. Its mere outward observance\nwas a mockery.\nUpon another Sabbath, as Jesus entered a synagogue, He saw\nthere a man who had a withered hand. The Pharisees watched Him,\neager to see what He would do. The Saviour well knew that in\nhealing on the Sabbath He would be regarded as a transgressor, but\nHe did not hesitate to break down the wall of traditional requirements\nthat barricaded the Sabbath. Jesus bade the afflicted man stand forth,\nand then asked, \u201cIs it lawful to do good on the Sabbath days, or to\n240 The Desire of Ages\ndo evil? to save life, or to kill?\u201d It was a maxim among the Jews that\na failure to do good, when one had opportunity, was to do evil; to\nneglect to save life was to kill. Thus Jesus met the rabbis on their\nown ground. \u201cBut they held their peace. And when He had looked\nround about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of\ntheir hearts, He saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And\nhe stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.\u201d\nMark 3:4, 5.\nWhen questioned, \u201cIs it lawful to heal on the Sabbath days?\u201d\nJesus answered, \u201cWhat man shall there be among you, that shall\nhave one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath day, will he\nnot lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better\nthan a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days.\u201d\nMatthew 12:10-12.\nThe spies dared not answer Christ in the presence of the mul-\ntitude, for fear of involving themselves in difficulty. They knew\nthat He had spoken the truth. Rather than violate their traditions,\nthey would leave a man to suffer, while they would relieve a brute\nbecause of the loss to the owner if it were neglected. Thus greater\ncare was shown for a dumb animal than for man, who is made in\nthe image of God. This illustrates the working of all false religions.\nThey originate in man\u2019s desire to exalt himself above God, but they\nresult in degrading man below the brute. Every religion that wars[287]\nagainst the sovereignty of God defrauds man of the glory which\nwas his at the creation, and which is to be restored to him in Christ.\nEvery false religion teaches its adherents to be careless of human\nneeds, sufferings, and rights. The gospel places a high value upon\nhumanity as the purchase of the blood of Christ, and it teaches a\ntender regard for the wants and woes of man. The Lord says, \u201cI\nwill make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the\ngolden wedge of Ophir.\u201d Isaiah 13:12.\nWhen Jesus turned upon the Pharisees with the question whether\nit was lawful on the Sabbath day to do good or to do evil, to save\nlife or to kill, He confronted them with their own wicked purposes.\nThey were hunting His life with bitter hatred, while He was saving\nlife and bringing happiness to multitudes. Was it better to slay upon\nthe Sabbath, as they were planning to do, than to heal the afflicted,\nas He had done? Was it more righteous to have murder in the heart\nSabbath 241\nupon God\u2019s holy day than love to all men, which finds expression in\ndeeds of mercy?\nIn the healing of the withered hand, Jesus condemned the custom\nof the Jews, and left the fourth commandment standing as God had\ngiven it. \u201cIt is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days,\u201d He declared.\nBy sweeping away the senseless restrictions of the Jews, Christ\nhonored the Sabbath, while those who complained of Him were\ndishonoring God\u2019s holy day.\nThose who hold that Christ abolished the law teach that He broke\nthe Sabbath and justified His disciples in doing the same. Thus they\nare really taking the same ground as did the caviling Jews. In this\nthey contradict the testimony of Christ Himself, who declared, \u201cI\nhave kept My Father\u2019s commandments, and abide in His love.\u201d John\n15:10. Neither the Saviour nor His followers broke the law of the\nSabbath. Christ was a living representative of the law. No violation\nof its holy precepts was found in His life. Looking upon a nation of\nwitnesses who were seeking occasion to condemn Him, He could\nsay unchallenged, \u201cWhich of you convicteth Me of sin?\u201d John 8:46,",

      "text": "The Saviour had not come to set aside what patriarchs and\nprophets had spoken; for He Himself had spoken through these\nrepresentative men. All the truths of God\u2019s word came from Him.\nBut these priceless gems had been placed in false settings. Their\nprecious light had been made to minister to error. God desired them\nto be removed from their settings of error and replaced in the frame- [288]\nwork of truth. This work only a divine hand could accomplish. By\nits connection with error, the truth had been serving the cause of the\nenemy of God and man. Christ had come to place it where it would\nglorify God, and work the salvation of humanity.\n\u201cThe Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath,\u201d\nJesus said. The institutions that God has established are for the\nbenefit of mankind. \u201cAll things are for your sakes.\u201d \u201cWhether Paul,\nor Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things\npresent, or things to come; all are yours; and ye are Christ\u2019s; and\nChrist is God\u2019s.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:15; 1 Corinthians 3:22, 23. The\nlaw of Ten Commandments, of which the Sabbath forms a part, God\ngave to His people as a blessing. \u201cThe Lord commanded us,\u201d said\nMoses, \u201cto do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our\n242 The Desire of Ages\ngood always, that He might preserve us alive.\u201d Deuteronomy 6:24.\nAnd through the psalmist the message was given to Israel, \u201cServe the\nLord with gladness: come before His presence with singing. Know\nye that the Lord He is God: it is He that hath made us, and not we\nourselves; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture. Enter\ninto His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise.\u201d\nPsalm 100:2-4. And of all who keep \u201cthe Sabbath from polluting\nit,\u201d the Lord declares, \u201cEven them will I bring to My holy mountain,\nand make them joyful in My house of prayer.\u201d Isaiah 56:6, 7.\n\u201cWherefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.\u201d These\nwords are full of instruction and comfort. Because the Sabbath was\nmade for man, it is the Lord\u2019s day. It belongs to Christ. For \u201call\nthings were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made\nthat was made.\u201d John 1:3. Since He made all things, He made the\nSabbath. By Him it was set apart as a memorial of the work of\ncreation. It points to Him as both the Creator and the Sanctifier. It\ndeclares that He who created all things in heaven and in earth, and\nby whom all things hold together, is the head of the church, and that\nby His power we are reconciled to God. For, speaking of Israel, He\nsaid, \u201cI gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them,\nthat they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them,\u201d\u2014make\nthem holy. Ezekiel 20:12. Then the Sabbath is a sign of Christ\u2019s\npower to make us holy. And it is given to all whom Christ makes\nholy. As a sign of His sanctifying power, the Sabbath is given to all\nwho through Christ become a part of the Israel of God.\nAnd the Lord says, \u201cIf thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath,[289]\nfrom doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a\ndelight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; ... then shalt thou delight\nthyself in the Lord.\u201d Isaiah 58:13, 14. To all who receive the Sabbath\nas a sign of Christ\u2019s creative and redeeming power, it will be a\ndelight. Seeing Christ in it, they delight themselves in Him. The\nSabbath points them to the works of creation as an evidence of His\nmighty power in redemption. While it calls to mind the lost peace\nof Eden, it tells of peace restored through the Saviour. And every\nobject in nature repeats His invitation, \u201cCome unto Me, all ye that\nlabor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d Matthew 11:28.\nChapter 30\u2014\u201cHe Ordained Twelve\u201d [290]\nThis chapter is based on Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16.\n\u201cAnd He goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto Him whom\nHe would: and they came unto Him. And He ordained twelve, that\nthey should be with Him, and that He might send them forth to\npreach.\u201d\nIt was beneath the sheltering trees of the mountainside, but a\nlittle distance from the Sea of Galilee, that the twelve were called\nto the apostolate, and the Sermon on the Mount was given. The\nfields and hills were the favorite resorts of Jesus, and much of His\nteaching was given under the open sky, rather than in the temple or\nthe synagogues. No synagogue could have received the throngs that\nfollowed Him; but not for this reason only did He choose to teach in\nthe fields and groves. Jesus loved the scenes of nature. To Him each\nquiet retreat was a sacred temple.\nIt was under the trees of Eden that the first dwellers on earth\nhad chosen their sanctuary. There Christ had communed with the\nfather of mankind. When banished from Paradise, our first parents\nstill worshiped in the fields and groves, and there Christ met them\nwith the gospel of His grace. It was Christ who spoke with Abraham\nunder the oaks at Mamre; with Isaac as he went out to pray in the [291]\nfields at the eventide; with Jacob on the hillside at Bethel; with\nMoses among the mountains of Midian; and with the boy David as\nhe watched his flocks. It was at Christ\u2019s direction that for fifteen\ncenturies the Hebrew people had left their homes for one week every\nyear, and had dwelt in booths formed from the green branches \u201cof\ngoodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees,\nand willows of the brook.\u201d Leviticus 23:40.\nIn training His disciples, Jesus chose to withdraw from the con-\nfusion of the city to the quiet of the fields and hills, as more in\nharmony with the lessons of self-abnegation He desired to teach\nthem. And during His ministry He loved to gather the people about\n243\n244 The Desire of Ages\nHim under the blue heavens, on some grassy hillside, or on the beach\nbeside the lake. Here, surrounded by the works of His own creation,\nHe could turn the thoughts of His hearers from the artificial to the\nnatural. In the growth and development of nature were revealed the\nprinciples of His kingdom. As men should lift up their eyes to the\nhills of God, and behold the wonderful works of His hands, they\ncould learn precious lessons of divine truth. Christ\u2019s teaching would\nbe repeated to them in the things of nature. So it is with all who go\ninto the fields with Christ in their hearts. They will feel themselves\nsurrounded with a holy influence. The things of nature take up the\nparables of our Lord, and repeat His counsels. By communion with\nGod in nature, the mind is uplifted, and the heart finds rest.\nThe first step was now to be taken in the organization of the\nchurch that after Christ\u2019s departure was to be His representative on\nearth. No costly sanctuary was at their command, but the Saviour\nled His disciples to the retreat He loved, and in their minds the\nsacred experiences of that day were forever linked with the beauty\nof mountain and vale and sea.\nJesus had called His disciples that He might send them forth\nas His witnesses, to declare to the world what they had seen and\nheard of Him. Their office was the most important to which human\nbeings had ever been called, and was second only to that of Christ\nHimself. They were to be workers together with God for the saving\nof the world. As in the Old Testament the twelve patriarchs stand\nas representatives of Israel, so the twelve apostles were to stand as\nrepresentatives of the gospel church.\nThe Saviour knew the character of the men whom He had chosen;\nall their weaknesses and errors were open before Him; He knew the\nperils through which they must pass, the responsibility that would[292]\nrest upon them; and His heart yearned over these chosen ones. Alone\nupon a mountain near the Sea of Galilee He spent the entire night in\nprayer for them, while they were sleeping at the foot of the mountain.\nWith the first light of dawn He summoned them to meet Him; for\nHe had something of importance to communicate to them.\nThese disciples had been for some time associated with Jesus\nin active labor. John and James, Andrew and Peter, with Philip,\nNathanael, and Matthew, had been more closely connected with\nHim than the others, and had witnessed more of His miracles. Peter,\n\u201cHe Ordained Twelve\u201d 245\nJames, and John stood in still nearer relationship to Him. They were\nalmost constantly with Him, witnessing His miracles, and hearing\nHis words. John pressed into still closer intimacy with Jesus, so\nthat he is distinguished as the one whom Jesus loved. The Saviour\nloved them all, but John\u2019s was the most receptive spirit. He was\nyounger than the others, and with more of the child\u2019s confiding trust\nhe opened his heart to Jesus. Thus he came more into sympathy with\nChrist, and through him the Saviour\u2019s deepest spiritual teaching was\ncommunicated to His people.\nAt the head of one of the groups into which the apostles are\ndivided stands the name of Philip. He was the first disciple to whom\nJesus addressed the distinct command, \u201cFollow Me.\u201d Philip was of\nBethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. He had listened to the\nteaching of John the Baptist, and had heard his announcement of\nChrist as the Lamb of God. Philip was a sincere seeker for truth,\nbut he was slow of heart to believe. Although he had joined himself\nto Christ, yet his announcement of Him to Nathanael shows that he\nwas not fully convinced of the divinity of Jesus. Though Christ had\nbeen proclaimed by the voice from heaven as the Son of God, to\nPhilip He was \u201cJesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\u201d John 1:45.\nAgain, when the five thousand were fed, Philip\u2019s lack of faith was [293]\nshown. It was to test him that Jesus questioned, \u201cWhence shall we\nbuy bread, that these may eat?\u201d Philip\u2019s answer was on the side of\nunbelief: \u201cTwo hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for\nthem, that every one of them may take a little.\u201d John 6:5, 7. Jesus\nwas grieved. Although Philip had seen His works and felt His power,\nyet he had not faith. When the Greeks inquired of Philip concerning\nJesus, he did not seize upon the opportunity of introducing them\nto the Saviour, but he went to tell Andrew. Again, in those last\nhours before the crucifixion, the words of Philip were such as to\ndiscourage faith. When Thomas said to Jesus, \u201cLord, we know not\nwhither Thou goest; and how can we know the way?\u201d the Saviour\nanswered, \u201cI am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.... If ye had known\nMe, ye should have known My Father also.\u201d From Philip came the\nresponse of unbelief: \u201cLord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\u201d\nJohn 14:5-8. So slow of heart, so weak in faith, was that disciple\nwho for three years had been with Jesus.\n246 The Desire of Ages\nIn happy contrast to Philip\u2019s unbelief was the childlike trust of\nNathanael. He was a man of intensely earnest nature, one whose\nfaith took hold upon unseen realities. Yet Philip was a student in\nthe school of Christ, and the divine Teacher bore patiently with his\nunbelief and dullness. When the Holy Spirit was poured out upon\nthe disciples, Philip became a teacher after the divine order. He\nknew whereof he spoke, and he taught with an assurance that carried\nconviction to the hearers.\nWhile Jesus was preparing the disciples for their ordination, one\nwho had not been summoned urged his presence among them. It was\nJudas Iscariot, a man who professed to be a follower of Christ. He\nnow came forward, soliciting a place in this inner circle of disciples.\nWith great earnestness and apparent sincerity he declared, \u201cMaster, I\nwill follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest.\u201d Jesus neither repulsed\nnor welcomed him, but uttered only the mournful words: \u201cThe foxes\nhave holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man\nhath not where to lay His head.\u201d Matthew 8:19, 20. Judas believed[294]\nJesus to be the Messiah; and by joining the apostles, he hoped to\nsecure a high position in the new kingdom. This hope Jesus designed\nto cut off by the statement of His poverty.\nThe disciples were anxious that Judas should become one of\ntheir number. He was of commanding appearance, a man of keen\ndiscernment and executive ability, and they commended him to\nJesus as one who would greatly assist Him in His work. They were\nsurprised that Jesus received him so coolly.\nThe disciples had been much disappointed that Jesus had not\ntried to secure the co-operation of the leaders in Israel. They felt that\nit was a mistake not to strengthen His cause by securing the support\nof these influential men. If He had repulsed Judas, they would, in\ntheir own minds, have questioned the wisdom of their Master. The\nafter history of Judas would show them the danger of allowing any\nworldly consideration to have weight in deciding the fitness of men\nfor the work of God. The co-operation of such men as the disciples\nwere anxious to secure would have betrayed the work into the hands\nof its worst enemies.\nYet when Judas joined the disciples, he was not insensible to\nthe beauty of the character of Christ. He felt the influence of that\ndivine power which was drawing souls to the Saviour. He who came\n\u201cHe Ordained Twelve\u201d 247\nnot to break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking flax would\nnot repulse this soul while even one desire was reaching toward the\nlight. The Saviour read the heart of Judas; He knew the depths of\niniquity to which, unless delivered by the grace of God, Judas would\nsink. In connecting this man with Himself, He placed him where\nhe might, day by day, be brought in contact with the outflowing of\nHis own unselfish love. If he would open his heart to Christ, divine\ngrace would banish the demon of selfishness, and even Judas might\nbecome a subject of the kingdom of God.\nGod takes men as they are, with the human elements in their\ncharacter, and trains them for His service, if they will be disciplined\nand learn of Him. They are not chosen because they are perfect, but\nnotwithstanding their imperfections, that through the knowledge and\npractice of the truth, through the grace of Christ, they may become\ntransformed into His image.\nJudas had the same opportunities as had the other disciples. He\nlistened to the same precious lessons. But the practice of the truth,\nwhich Christ required, was at variance with the desires and purposes [295]\nof Judas, and he would not yield his ideas in order to receive wisdom\nfrom Heaven.\nHow tenderly the Saviour dealt with him who was to be His be-\ntrayer! In His teaching, Jesus dwelt upon principles of benevolence\nthat struck at the very root of covetousness. He presented before\nJudas the heinous character of greed, and many a time the disciple\nrealized that his character had been portrayed, and his sin pointed\nout; but he would not confess and forsake his unrighteousness. He\nwas self-sufficient, and instead of resisting temptation, he continued\nto follow his fraudulent practices. Christ was before him, a living\nexample of what he must become if he reaped the benefit of the\ndivine mediation and ministry; but lesson after lesson fell unheeded\non the ears of Judas.\nJesus dealt him no sharp rebuke for his covetousness, but with\ndivine patience bore with this erring man, even while giving him\nevidence that He read his heart as an open book. He presented before\nhim the highest incentives for right doing; and in rejecting the light\nof Heaven, Judas would be without excuse.\nInstead of walking in the light, Judas chose to retain his defects.\nEvil desires, revengeful passions, dark and sullen thoughts, were\n248 The Desire of Ages\ncherished, until Satan had full control of the man. Judas became a\nrepresentative of the enemy of Christ.\nWhen he came into association with Jesus, he had some precious\ntraits of character that might have been made a blessing to the church.\nIf he had been willing to wear the yoke of Christ, he might have\nbeen among the chief of the apostles; but he hardened his heart when\nhis defects were pointed out, and in pride and rebellion chose his\nown selfish ambitions, and thus unfitted himself for the work that\nGod would have given him to do.\nAll the disciples had serious faults when Jesus called them to His\nservice. Even John, who came into closest association with the meek\nand lowly One, was not himself naturally meek and yielding. He\nand his brother were called \u201cthe sons of thunder.\u201d While they were\nwith Jesus, any slight shown to Him aroused their indignation and\ncombativeness. Evil temper, revenge, the spirit of criticism, were\nall in the beloved disciple. He was proud, and ambitious to be first\nin the kingdom of God. But day by day, in contrast with his own\nviolent spirit, he beheld the tenderness and forbearance of Jesus, and\nheard His lessons of humility and patience. He opened his heart to\nthe divine influence, and became not only a hearer but a doer of the[296]\nSaviour\u2019s words. Self was hid in Christ. He learned to wear the yoke\nof Christ and to bear His burden.\nJesus reproved His disciples, He warned and cautioned them;\nbut John and his brethren did not leave Him; they chose Jesus,\nnotwithstanding the reproofs. The Saviour did not withdraw from\nthem because of their weakness and errors. They continued to the\nend to share His trials and to learn the lessons of His life. By\nbeholding Christ, they became transformed in character.\nThe apostles differed widely in habits and disposition. There\nwere the publican, Levi-Matthew, and the fiery zealot Simon, the\nuncompromising hater of the authority of Rome; the generous, im-\npulsive Peter, and the mean-spirited Judas; Thomas, truehearted, yet\ntimid and fearful, Philip, slow of heart, and inclined to doubt, and the\nambitious, outspoken sons of Zebedee, with their brethren. These\nwere brought together, with their different faults, all with inherited\nand cultivated tendencies to evil; but in and through Christ they were\nto dwell in the family of God, learning to become one in faith, in\ndoctrine, in spirit. They would have their tests, their grievances, their\n\u201cHe Ordained Twelve\u201d 249\ndifferences of opinion; but while Christ was abiding in the heart,\nthere could be no dissension. His love would lead to love for one\nanother; the lessons of the Master would lead to the harmonizing of\nall differences, bringing the disciples into unity, till they would be\nof one mind and one judgment. Christ is the great center, and they\nwould approach one another just in proportion as they approached\nthe center.\nWhen Jesus had ended His instruction to the disciples, He gath-\nered the little band close about Him, and kneeling in the midst of\nthem, and laying His hands upon their heads, He offered a prayer\ndedicating them to His sacred work. Thus the Lord\u2019s disciples were\nordained to the gospel ministry.\nAs His representatives among men, Christ does not choose angels\nwho have never fallen, but human beings, men of like passions\nwith those they seek to save. Christ took upon Himself humanity,\nthat He might reach humanity. Divinity needed humanity; for it\nrequired both the divine and the human to bring salvation to the\nworld. Divinity needed humanity, that humanity might afford a\nchannel of communication between God and man. So with the\nservants and messengers of Christ. Man needs a power outside of\nand beyond himself, to restore him to the likeness of God, and enable\nhim to do the work of God; but this does not make the human agency [297]\nunessential. Humanity lays hold upon divine power, Christ dwells\nin the heart by faith; and through co-operation with the divine, the\npower of man becomes efficient for good.\nHe who called the fishermen of Galilee is still calling men to His\nservice. And He is just as willing to manifest His power through us\nas through the first disciples. However imperfect and sinful we may\nbe, the Lord holds out to us the offer of partnership with Himself,\nof apprenticeship to Christ. He invites us to come under the divine\ninstruction, that, uniting with Christ, we may work the works of\nGod.\n\u201cWe have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding\ngreatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 4:7, R. V . This is why the preaching of the gospel was\ncommitted to erring men rather than to the angels. It is manifest\nthat the power which works through the weakness of humanity is\nthe power of God; and thus we are encouraged to believe that the\n250 The Desire of Ages\npower which can help others as weak as ourselves can help us. And\nthose who are themselves \u201ccompassed with infirmity\u201d should be\nable to \u201chave compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out\nof the way.\u201d Hebrews 5:2. Having been in peril themselves, they are\nacquainted with the dangers and difficulties of the way, and for this\nreason are called to reach out for others in like peril. There are souls\nperplexed with doubt, burdened with infirmities, weak in faith, and\nunable to grasp the Unseen; but a friend whom they can see, coming\nto them in Christ\u2019s stead, can be a connecting link to fasten their\ntrembling faith upon Christ.\nWe are to be laborers together with the heavenly angels in pre-\nsenting Jesus to the world. With almost impatient eagerness the\nangels wait for our co-operation; for man must be the channel to\ncommunicate with man. And when we give ourselves to Christ in\nwholehearted devotion, angels rejoice that they may speak through\nour voices to reveal God\u2019s love.\nChapter 31\u2014The Sermon on the Mount [298]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 5; Matthew 6; Matthew 7.\nChrist seldom gathered His disciples alone to receive His words.\nHe did not choose for His audience those only who knew the way of\nlife. It was His work to reach the multitudes who were in ignorance\nand error. He gave His lessons of truth where they could reach the\ndarkened understanding. He Himself was the Truth, standing with\ngirded loins and hands ever outstretched to bless, and in words of\nwarning, entreaty, and encouragement, seeking to uplift all who\nwould come unto Him.\nThe Sermon on the Mount, though given especially to the disci-\nples, was spoken in the hearing of the multitude. After the ordination\nof the apostles, Jesus went with them to the seaside. Here in the\nearly morning the people had begun to assemble. Besides the usual\ncrowds from the Galilean towns, there were people from Judea,\nand even from Jerusalem itself; from Perea, from Decapolis, from\nIdumea, away to the south of Judea; and from Tyre and Sidon, the\nPhoenician cities on the shore of the Mediterranean. \u201cWhen they\nhad heard what great things He did,\u201d they \u201ccame to hear Him, and\nto be healed of their diseases: ... there went virtue out of Him, and\nhealed them all.\u201d Mark 3:8; Luke 6:17-19.\nThe narrow beach did not afford even standing room within reach\nof His voice for all who desired to hear Him, and Jesus led the way\nback to the mountainside. Reaching a level space that offered a\npleasant gathering place for the vast assembly, He seated Himself on\nthe grass, and the disciples and the multitude followed His example.\nThe disciples\u2019 place was always next to Jesus. The people con- [299]\nstantly pressed upon Him, yet the disciples understood that they\nwere not to be crowded away from His presence. They sat close\nbeside Him, that they might not lose a word of His instruction. They\nwere attentive listeners, eager to understand the truths they were to\nmake known to all lands and all ages.\n251\n252 The Desire of Ages\nWith a feeling that something more than usual might be expected,\nthey now pressed about their Master. They believed that the kingdom\nwas soon to be established, and from the events of the morning they\ngathered assurance that some announcement concerning it was about\nto be made. A feeling of expectancy pervaded the multitude also,\nand eager faces gave evidence of the deep interest. As the people sat\nupon the green hillside, awaiting the words of the divine Teacher,\ntheir hearts were filled with thoughts of future glory. There were\nscribes and Pharisees who looked forward to the day when they\nshould have dominion over the hated Romans, and possess the riches\nand splendor of the world\u2019s great empire. The poor peasants and\nfishermen hoped to hear the assurance that their wretched hovels, the\nscanty food, the life of toil, and fear of want were to be exchanged\nfor mansions of plenty and days of ease. In place of the one coarse\ngarment which was their covering by day, and their blanket at night,\nthey hoped that Christ would give them the rich and costly robes of\ntheir conquerors. All hearts thrilled with the proud hope that Israel\nwas soon to be honored before the nations as the chosen of the Lord,\nand Jerusalem exalted as the head of a universal kingdom.\nChrist disappointed the hope of worldly greatness. In the Sermon\non the Mount He sought to undo the work that had been wrought by\nfalse education, and to give His hearers a right conception of His\nkingdom and of His own character. Yet He did not make a direct\nattack on the errors of the people. He saw the misery of the world on\naccount of sin, yet He did not present before them a vivid delineation\nof their wretchedness. He taught them of something infinitely better\nthan they had known. Without combating their ideas of the kingdom\nof God, He told them the conditions of entrance therein, leaving\nthem to draw their own conclusions as to its nature. The truths He\ntaught are no less important to us than to the multitude that followed\nHim. We no less than they need to learn the foundation principles of\nthe kingdom of God.\nChrist\u2019s first words to the people on the mount were words of\nblessing. Happy are they, He said, who recognize their spiritual\npoverty, and feel their need of redemption. The gospel is to be[300]\npreached to the poor. Not to the spiritually proud, those who claim\nto be rich and in need of nothing, is it revealed, but to those who are\nSermon on the Mount 253\nhumble and contrite. One fountain only has been opened for sin, a\nfountain for the poor in spirit.\nThe proud heart strives to earn salvation; but both our title to\nheaven and our fitness for it are found in the righteousness of Christ.\nThe Lord can do nothing toward the recovery of man until, convinced\nof his own weakness, and stripped of all self-sufficiency, he yields\nhimself to the control of God. Then he can receive the gift that God\nis waiting to bestow. From the soul that feels his need, nothing is\nwithheld. He has unrestricted access to Him in whom all fullness\ndwells. \u201cFor thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,\nwhose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him\nalso that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the\nhumble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.\u201d Isaiah 57:15.\n\u201cBlessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.\u201d By\nthese words Christ does not teach that mourning in itself has power\nto remove the guilt of sin. He gives no sanction to pretense or to\nvoluntary humility. The mourning of which He speaks does not\nconsist in melancholy and lamentation. While we sorrow on account\nof sin, we are to rejoice in the precious privilege of being children\nof God.\nWe often sorrow because our evil deeds bring unpleasant conse-\nquences to ourselves; but this is not repentance. Real sorrow for sin\nis the result of the working of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit reveals the\ningratitude of the heart that has slighted and grieved the Saviour, and\nbrings us in contrition to the foot of the cross. By every sin Jesus is\nwounded afresh; and as we look upon Him whom we have pierced,\nwe mourn for the sins that have brought anguish upon Him. Such\nmourning will lead to the renunciation of sin.\nThe worldling may pronounce this sorrow a weakness; but it is\nthe strength which binds the penitent to the Infinite One with links\nthat cannot be broken. It shows that the angels of God are bringing\nback to the soul the graces that were lost through hardness of heart\nand transgression. The tears of the penitent are only the raindrops\nthat precede the sunshine of holiness. This sorrow heralds a joy\nwhich will be a living fountain in the soul. \u201cOnly acknowledge thine\niniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God;\u201d \u201cand\nI will not cause Mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith\nthe Lord.\u201d Jeremiah 3:13, 12. \u201cUnto them that mourn in Zion,\u201d He\n254 The Desire of Ages\nhas appointed to give \u201cbeauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning,[301]\nthe garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.\u201d Isaiah 61:3.\nAnd for those also who mourn in trial and sorrow there is com-\nfort. The bitterness of grief and humiliation is better than the indul-\ngences of sin. Through affliction God reveals to us the plague spots\nin our characters, that by His grace we may overcome our faults.\nUnknown chapters in regard to ourselves are opened to us, and the\ntest comes, whether we will accept the reproof and the counsel of\nGod. When brought into trial, we are not to fret and complain. We\nshould not rebel, or worry ourselves out of the hand of Christ. We\nare to humble the soul before God. The ways of the Lord are obscure\nto him who desires to see things in a light pleasing to himself. They\nappear dark and joyless to our human nature. But God\u2019s ways are\nways of mercy and the end is salvation. Elijah knew not what he was\ndoing when in the desert he said that he had had enough of life, and\nprayed that he might die. The Lord in His mercy did not take him at\nhis word. There was yet a great work for Elijah to do; and when his\nwork was done, he was not to perish in discouragement and solitude\nin the wilderness. Not for him the descent into the dust of death,\nbut the ascent in glory, with the convoy of celestial chariots, to the\nthrone on high.\nGod\u2019s word for the sorrowing is, \u201cI have seen his ways, and\nwill heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him\nand to his mourners.\u201d \u201cI will turn their mourning into joy, and will\ncomfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.\u201d Isaiah\n57:18; Jeremiah 31:13.\n\u201cBlessed are the meek.\u201d The difficulties we have to encounter\nmay be very much lessened by that meekness which hides itself\nin Christ. If we possess the humility of our Master, we shall rise\nabove the slights, the rebuffs, the annoyances, to which we are daily\nexposed, and they will cease to cast a gloom over the spirit. The\nhighest evidence of nobility in a Christian is self-control. He who\nunder abuse or cruelty fails to maintain a calm and trustful spirit robs\nGod of His right to reveal in him His own perfection of character.\nLowliness of heart is the strength that gives victory to the followers\nof Christ; it is the token of their connection with the courts above.\n\u201cThough the Lord be high, yet hath He respect unto the lowly.\u201d\nPsalm 138:6. Those who reveal the meek and lowly spirit of Christ\nSermon on the Mount 255\nare tenderly regarded by God. They may be looked upon with scorn\nby the world, but they are of great value in His sight. Not only the\nwise, the great, the beneficent, will gain a passport to the heavenly\ncourts; not only the busy worker, full of zeal and restless activity. No; [302]\nthe poor in spirit, who crave the presence of an abiding Christ, the\nhumble in heart, whose highest ambition is to do God\u2019s will,\u2014these\nwill gain an abundant entrance. They will be among that number\nwho have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of\nthe Lamb. \u201cTherefore are they before the throne of God, and serve\nHim day and night in His temple: and He that sitteth on the throne\nshall dwell among them.\u201d Revelation 7:15.\n\u201cBlessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness.\u201d\nThe sense of unworthiness will lead the heart to hunger and thirst for\nrighteousness, and this desire will not be disappointed. Those who\nmake room in their hearts for Jesus will realize His love. All who\nlong to bear the likeness of the character of God shall be satisfied.\nThe Holy Spirit never leaves unassisted the soul who is looking unto\nJesus. He takes of the things of Christ and shows them unto him.\nIf the eye is kept fixed on Christ, the work of the Spirit ceases not\nuntil the soul is conformed to His image. The pure element of love\nwill expand the soul, giving it a capacity for higher attainments, for\nincreased knowledge of heavenly things, so that it will not rest short\nof the fullness. \u201cBlessed are they which do hunger and thirst after\nrighteousness; for they shall be filled.\u201d\nThe merciful shall find mercy, and the pure in heart shall see\nGod. Every impure thought defiles the soul, impairs the moral sense,\nand tends to obliterate the impressions of the Holy Spirit. It dims\nthe spiritual vision, so that men cannot behold God. The Lord may\nand does forgive the repenting sinner; but though forgiven, the soul\nis marred. All impurity of speech or of thought must be shunned by\nhim who would have clear discernment of spiritual truth.\nBut the words of Christ cover more than freedom from sensual\nimpurity, more than freedom from that ceremonial defilement which\nthe Jews so rigorously shunned. Selfishness prevents us from behold-\ning God. The self-seeking spirit judges of God as altogether such a\none as itself. Until we have renounced this, we cannot understand\nHim who is love. Only the unselfish heart, the humble and trustful\n256 The Desire of Ages\nspirit, shall see God as \u201cmerciful and gracious, long-suffering, and\nabundant in goodness and truth.\u201d Exodus 34:6.\n\u201cBlessed are the peacemakers.\u201d The peace of Christ is born of\ntruth. It is harmony with God. The world is at enmity with the law\nof God; sinners are at enmity with their Maker; and as a result they[303]\n[304]\n[305]\nare at enmity with one another. But the psalmist declares, \u201cGreat\npeace have they which love Thy law: and nothing shall offend them.\u201d\nPsalm 119:165. Men cannot manufacture peace. Human plans for\nthe purification and uplifting of individuals or of society will fail\nof producing peace, because they do not reach the heart. The only\npower that can create or perpetuate true peace is the grace of Christ.\nWhen this is implanted in the heart, it will cast out the evil passions\nthat cause strife and dissension. \u201cInstead of the thorn shall come up\nthe fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree;\u201d\nand life\u2019s desert \u201cshall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.\u201d Isaiah\n55:13; 35:1.\nThe multitudes were amazed at this teaching, which was so at\nvariance with the precepts and example of the Pharisees. The people\nhad come to think that happiness consisted in the possession of the\nthings of this world, and that fame and the honor of men were much\nto be coveted. It was very pleasing to be called \u201cRabbi,\u201d and to be\nextolled as wise and religious, having their virtues paraded before\nthe public. This was regarded as the crown of happiness. But in\nthe presence of that vast throng, Jesus declared that earthly gain\nand honor were all the reward such persons would ever receive. He\nspoke with certainty, and a convincing power attended His words.\nThe people were silenced, and a feeling of fear crept over them.\nThey looked at one another doubtfully. Who of them would be saved\nif this Man\u2019s teachings were true? Many were convicted that this\nremarkable Teacher was actuated by the Spirit of God, and that the\nsentiments He uttered were divine.\nAfter explaining what constitutes true happiness, and how it\nmay be obtained, Jesus more definitely pointed out the duty of His\ndisciples, as teachers chosen of God to lead others into the path of\nrighteousness and eternal life. He knew that they would often suffer\nfrom disappointment and discouragement, that they would meet with\ndecided opposition, that they would be insulted, and their testimony\nrejected. Well He knew that in the fulfillment of their mission, the\nSermon on the Mount 257\nhumble men who listened so attentively to His words were to bear\ncalumny, torture, imprisonment, and death, and He continued:\n\u201cBlessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness\u2019 sake:\nfor theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall\nrevile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against\nyou falsely, for My sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great\nis your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which [306]\nwere before you.\u201d\nThe world loves sin, and hates righteousness, and this was the\ncause of its hostility to Jesus. All who refuse His infinite love will\nfind Christianity a disturbing element. The light of Christ sweeps\naway the darkness that covers their sins, and the need of reform is\nmade manifest. While those who yield to the influence of the Holy\nSpirit begin war with themselves, those who cling to sin war against\nthe truth and its representatives.\nThus strife is created, and Christ\u2019s followers are accused as\ntroublers of the people. But it is fellowship with God that brings\nthem the world\u2019s enmity. They are bearing the reproach of Christ.\nThey are treading the path that has been trodden by the noblest of\nthe earth. Not with sorrow, but with rejoicing, should they meet\npersecution. Each fiery trial is God\u2019s agent for their refining. Each\nis fitting them for their work as colaborers with Him. Each conflict\nhas its place in the great battle for righteousness, and each will add\nto the joy of their final triumph. Having this in view, the test of their\nfaith and patience will be cheerfully accepted rather than dreaded\nand avoided. Anxious to fulfill their obligation to the world, fixing\ntheir desire upon the approval of God, His servants are to fulfill\nevery duty, irrespective of the fear or the favor of men.\n\u201cYe are the salt of the earth,\u201d Jesus said. Do not withdraw\nyourselves from the world in order to escape persecution. You are\nto abide among men, that the savor of the divine love may be as salt\nto preserve the world from corruption.\nHearts that respond to the influence of the Holy Spirit are the\nchannels through which God\u2019s blessing flows. Were those who serve\nGod removed from the earth, and His Spirit withdrawn from among\nmen, this world would be left to desolation and destruction, the fruit\nof Satan\u2019s dominion. Though the wicked know it not, they owe\neven the blessings of this life to the presence, in the world, of God\u2019s\n258 The Desire of Ages\npeople whom they despise and oppress. But if Christians are such in\nname only, they are like the salt that has lost its savor. They have no\ninfluence for good in the world. Through their misrepresentation of\nGod they are worse than unbelievers.\n\u201cYe are the light of the world.\u201d The Jews thought to confine the\nbenefits of salvation to their own nation; but Christ showed them\nthat salvation is like the sunshine. It belongs to the whole world.[307]\nThe religion of the Bible is not to be confined between the covers\nof a book, nor within the walls of a church. It is not to be brought\nout occasionally for our own benefit, and then to be carefully laid\naside again. It is to sanctify the daily life, to manifest itself in every\nbusiness transaction and in all our social relations.\nTrue character is not shaped from without, and put on; it radiates\nfrom within. If we wish to direct others in the path of righteousness,\nthe principles of righteousness must be enshrined in our own hearts.\nOur profession of faith may proclaim the theory of religion, but\nit is our practical piety that holds forth the word of truth. The\nconsistent life, the holy conversation, the unswerving integrity, the\nactive, benevolent spirit, the godly example,\u2014these are the mediums\nthrough which light is conveyed to the world.\nJesus had not dwelt on the specifications of the law, but He did\nnot leave His hearers to conclude that He had come to set aside its\nrequirements. He knew that spies stood ready to seize upon every\nword that might be wrested to serve their purpose. He knew the\nprejudice that existed in the minds of many of His hearers, and He\nsaid nothing to unsettle their faith in the religion and institutions that\nhad been committed to them through Moses. Christ Himself had\ngiven both the moral and the ceremonial law. He did not come to\ndestroy confidence in His own instruction. It was because of His\ngreat reverence for the law and the prophets that He sought to break\nthrough the wall of traditional requirements which hemmed in the\nJews. While He set aside their false interpretations of the law, He\ncarefully guarded His disciples against yielding up the vital truths\ncommitted to the Hebrews.\nThe Pharisees prided themselves on their obedience to the law;\nyet they knew so little of its principles through everyday practice that\nto them the Saviour\u2019s words sounded like heresy. As He swept away\nthe rubbish under which the truth had been buried, they thought He\nSermon on the Mount 259\nwas sweeping away the truth itself. They whispered to one another\nthat He was making light of the law. He read their thoughts, and\nanswered them, saying,\u2014\n\u201cThink not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I\nam not come to destroy, but to fulfill.\u201d Here Jesus refutes the charge\nof the Pharisees. His mission to the world is to vindicate the sacred\nclaims of that law which they charge Him with breaking. If the law\nof God could have been changed or abrogated, then Christ need not [308]\nhave suffered the consequences of our transgression. He came to\nexplain the relation of the law to man, and to illustrate its precepts\nby His own life of obedience.\nGod has given us His holy precepts, because He loves mankind.\nTo shield us from the results of transgression, He reveals the prin-\nciples of righteousness. The law is an expression of the thought of\nGod; when received in Christ, it becomes our thought. It lifts us\nabove the power of natural desires and tendencies, above temptations\nthat lead to sin. God desires us to be happy, and He gave us the\nprecepts of the law that in obeying them we might have joy. When\nat Jesus\u2019 birth the angels sang,\u2014\n\u201cGlory to God in the highest,\nAnd on earth peace, good will toward men\u201d (Luke 2:14),\nthey were declaring the principles of the law which He had come to\nmagnify and make honorable.\nWhen the law was proclaimed from Sinai, God made known\nto men the holiness of His character, that by contrast they might\nsee the sinfulness of their own. The law was given to convict them\nof sin, and reveal their need of a Saviour. It would do this as its\nprinciples were applied to the heart by the Holy Spirit. This work it\nis still to do. In the life of Christ the principles of the law are made\nplain; and as the Holy Spirit of God touches the heart, as the light\nof Christ reveals to men their need of His cleansing blood and His\njustifying righteousness, the law is still an agent in bringing us to\nChrist, that we may be justified by faith. \u201cThe law of the Lord is\nperfect, converting the soul.\u201d Psalm 19:7.\n\u201cTill heaven and earth pass,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cone jot or one tittle shall\nin nowise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\u201d The sun shining\n260 The Desire of Ages\nin the heavens, the solid earth upon which you dwell, are God\u2019s\nwitnesses that His law is changeless and eternal. Though they may\npass away, the divine precepts shall endure. \u201cIt is easier for heaven\nand earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.\u201d Luke 16:17. The\nsystem of types that pointed to Jesus as the Lamb of God was to\nbe abolished at His death; but the precepts of the Decalogue are as\nimmutable as the throne of God.\nSince \u201cthe law of the Lord is perfect,\u201d every variation from it\nmust be evil. Those who disobey the commandments of God, and\nteach others to do so, are condemned by Christ. The Saviour\u2019s life[309]\nof obedience maintained the claims of the law; it proved that the law\ncould be kept in humanity, and showed the excellence of character\nthat obedience would develop. All who obey as He did are likewise\ndeclaring that the law is \u201choly, and just, and good.\u201d Romans 7:12. On\nthe other hand, all who break God\u2019s commandments are sustaining\nSatan\u2019s claim that the law is unjust, and cannot be obeyed. Thus they\nsecond the deceptions of the great adversary, and cast dishonor upon\nGod. They are the children of the wicked one, who was the first rebel\nagainst God\u2019s law. To admit them into heaven would again bring in\nthe elements of discord and rebellion, and imperil the well-being of\nthe universe. No man who willfully disregards one principle of the\nlaw shall enter the kingdom of heaven.\nThe rabbis counted their righteousness a passport to heaven; but\nJesus declared it to be insufficient and unworthy. External cere-\nmonies and a theoretical knowledge of truth constituted Pharisaical\nrighteousness. The rabbis claimed to be holy through their own ef-\nforts in keeping the law; but their works had divorced righteousness\nfrom religion. While they were punctilious in ritual observances,\ntheir lives were immoral and debased. Their so-called righteousness\ncould never enter the kingdom of heaven.\nThe greatest deception of the human mind in Christ\u2019s day was\nthat a mere assent to the truth constitutes righteousness. In all human\nexperience a theoretical knowledge of the truth has been proved to be\ninsufficient for the saving of the soul. It does not bring forth the fruits\nof righteousness. A jealous regard for what is termed theological\ntruth often accompanies a hatred of genuine truth as made manifest\nin life. The darkest chapters of history are burdened with the record\nof crimes committed by bigoted religionists. The Pharisees claimed\nSermon on the Mount 261\nto be children of Abraham, and boasted of their possession of the\noracles of God; yet these advantages did not preserve them from\nselfishness, malignity, greed for gain, and the basest hypocrisy. They\nthought themselves the greatest religionists of the world, but their\nso-called orthodoxy led them to crucify the Lord of glory.\nThe same danger still exists. Many take it for granted that they\nare Christians, simply because they subscribe to certain theological\ntenets. But they have not brought the truth into practical life. They\nhave not believed and loved it, therefore they have not received\nthe power and grace that come through sanctification of the truth. [310]\nMen may profess faith in the truth; but if it does not make them\nsincere, kind, patient, forbearing, heavenly-minded, it is a curse to\nits possessors, and through their influence it is a curse to the world.\nThe righteousness which Christ taught is conformity of heart and\nlife to the revealed will of God. Sinful men can become righteous\nonly as they have faith in God and maintain a vital connection with\nHim. Then true godliness will elevate the thoughts and ennoble the\nlife. Then the external forms of religion accord with the Christian\u2019s\ninternal purity. Then the ceremonies required in the service of God\nare not meaningless rites, like those of the hypocritical Pharisees.\nJesus takes up the commandments separately, and explains the\ndepth and breadth of their requirement. Instead of removing one\njot of their force, He shows how far-reaching their principles are,\nand exposes the fatal mistake of the Jews in their outward show of\nobedience. He declares that by the evil thought or the lustful look\nthe law of God is transgressed. One who becomes a party to the least\ninjustice is breaking the law and degrading his own moral nature.\nMurder first exists in the mind. He who gives hatred a place in his\nheart is setting his feet in the path of the murderer, and his offerings\nare abhorrent to God.\nThe Jews cultivated a spirit of retaliation. In their hatred of the\nRomans they gave utterance to hard denunciations, and pleased the\nwicked one by manifesting his attributes. Thus they were training\nthemselves to do the terrible deeds to which he led them on. In the\nreligious life of the Pharisees there was nothing to recommend piety\nto the Gentiles. Jesus bade them not to deceive themselves with the\nthought that they could in heart rise up against their oppressors, and\ncherish the longing to avenge their wrongs.\n262 The Desire of Ages\nIt is true there is an indignation that is justifiable, even in the\nfollowers of Christ. When they see that God is dishonored, and His\nservice brought into disrepute, when they see the innocent oppressed,\na righteous indignation stirs the soul. Such anger, born of sensitive\nmorals, is not a sin. But those who at any supposed provocation feel\nat liberty to indulge anger or resentment are opening the heart to\nSatan. Bitterness and animosity must be banished from the soul if\nwe would be in harmony with heaven.\nThe Saviour goes farther than this. He says, \u201cIf thou bring thy\ngift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught\nagainst thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way;\nfirst be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.\u201d[311]\nMany are zealous in religious services, while between them and\ntheir brethren are unhappy differences which they might reconcile.\nGod requires them to do all in their power to restore harmony. Until\nthey do this, He cannot accept their services. The Christian\u2019s duty\nin this matter is clearly pointed out.\nGod pours His blessings upon all. \u201cHe maketh His sun to rise\non the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the\nunjust.\u201d He is \u201ckind unto the unthankful and to the evil.\u201d Luke 6:35.\nHe bids us to be like Him. \u201cBless them that curse you,\u201d said Jesus;\n\u201cdo good to them that hate you, ... that ye may be the children of\nyour Father which is in heaven.\u201d These are the principles of the law,\nand they are the wellsprings of life.\nGod\u2019s ideal for His children is higher than the highest human\nthought can reach. \u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father\nwhich is in heaven is perfect.\u201d This command is a promise. The plan\nof redemption contemplates our complete recovery from the power\nof Satan. Christ always separates the contrite soul from sin. He\ncame to destroy the works of the devil, and He has made provision\nthat the Holy Spirit shall be imparted to every repentant soul, to keep\nhim from sinning.\nThe tempter\u2019s agency is not to be accounted an excuse for one\nwrong act. Satan is jubilant when he hears the professed followers\nof Christ making excuses for their deformity of character. It is these\nexcuses that lead to sin. There is no excuse for sinning. A holy\ntemper, a Christlike life, is accessible to every repenting, believing\nchild of God.\nSermon on the Mount 263\nThe ideal of Christian character is Christlikeness. As the Son\nof man was perfect in His life, so His followers are to be perfect in\ntheir life. Jesus was in all things made like unto His brethren. He\nbecame flesh, even as we are. He was hungry and thirsty and weary.\nHe was sustained by food and refreshed by sleep. He shared the\nlot of man; yet He was the blameless Son of God. He was God in\nthe flesh. His character is to be ours. The Lord says of those who\nbelieve in Him, \u201cI will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will\nbe their God, and they shall be My people.\u201d 2 Corinthians 6:16.\nChrist is the ladder that Jacob saw, the base resting on the earth,\nand the topmost round reaching to the gate of heaven, to the very\nthreshold of glory. If that ladder had failed by a single step of\nreaching the earth, we should have been lost. But Christ reaches us\nwhere we are. He took our nature and overcame, that we through\ntaking His nature might overcome. Made \u201cin the likeness of sinful [312]\nflesh\u201d (Romans 8:3), He lived a sinless life. Now by His divinity\nHe lays hold upon the throne of heaven, while by His humanity He\nreaches us. He bids us by faith in Him attain to the glory of the\ncharacter of God. Therefore are we to be perfect, even as our \u201cFather\nwhich is in heaven is perfect.\u201d\nJesus had shown in what righteousness consists, and had pointed\nto God as its source. Now He turned to practical duties. In alms-\ngiving, in prayer, in fasting, He said, let nothing be done to attract\nattention or win praise to self. Give in sincerity, for the benefit of\nthe suffering poor. In prayer, let the soul commune with God. In\nfasting, go not with the head bowed down, and heart filled with\nthoughts of self. The heart of the Pharisee is a barren and profitless\nsoil, in which no seeds of divine life can flourish. It is he who yields\nhimself most unreservedly to God that will render Him the most\nacceptable service. For through fellowship with God men become\nworkers together with Him in presenting His character in humanity.\nThe service rendered in sincerity of heart has great recompense.\n\u201cThy Father which seeth in secret Himself shall reward thee openly.\u201d\nBy the life we live through the grace of Christ the character is\nformed. The original loveliness begins to be restored to the soul.\nThe attributes of the character of Christ are imparted, and the image\nof the Divine begins to shine forth. The faces of men and women\nwho walk and work with God express the peace of heaven. They\n264 The Desire of Ages\nare surrounded with the atmosphere of heaven. For these souls the\nkingdom of God has begun. They have Christ\u2019s joy, the joy of being\na blessing to humanity. They have the honor of being accepted for\nthe Master\u2019s use; they are trusted to do His work in His name.\n\u201cNo man can serve two masters.\u201d We cannot serve God with\na divided heart. Bible religion is not one influence among many\nothers; its influence is to be supreme, pervading and controlling\nevery other. It is not to be like a dash of color brushed here and there\nupon the canvas, but it is to pervade the whole life, as if the canvas\nwere dipped into the color, until every thread of the fabric were dyed\na deep, unfading hue.\n\u201cIf therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full\nof light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of\ndarkness.\u201d Purity and steadfastness of purpose are the conditions of\nreceiving light from God. He who desires to know the truth must\nbe willing to accept all that it reveals. He can make no compromise\nwith error. To be wavering and halfhearted in allegiance to truth is[313]\nto choose the darkness of error and satanic delusion.\nWorldly policy and the undeviating principles of righteousness\ndo not blend into each other imperceptibly, like the colors of the\nrainbow. Between the two a broad, clear line is drawn by the eternal\nGod. The likeness of Christ stands out as distinct from that of Satan\nas midday in contrast with midnight. And only those who live the\nlife of Christ are His co-workers. If one sin is cherished in the\nsoul, or one wrong practice retained in the life, the whole being is\ncontaminated. The man becomes an instrument of unrighteousness.\nAll who have chosen God\u2019s service are to rest in His care. Christ\npointed to the birds flying in the heavens, to the flowers of the field,\nand bade His hearers consider these objects of God\u2019s creation. \u201cAre\nnot ye of much more value than they?\u201d He said. Matthew 6:26,\nR. V . The measure of divine attention bestowed on any object is\nproportionate to its rank in the scale of being. The little brown\nsparrow is watched over by Providence. The flowers of the field, the\ngrass that carpets the earth, share the notice and care of our heavenly\nFather. The great Master Artist has taken thought for the lilies,\nmaking them so beautiful that they outshine the glory of Solomon.\nHow much more does He care for man, who is the image and glory\nof God. He longs to see His children reveal a character after His\nSermon on the Mount 265\nsimilitude. As the sunbeam imparts to the flowers their varied and\ndelicate tints, so does God impart to the soul the beauty of His own\ncharacter.\nAll who choose Christ\u2019s kingdom of love and righteousness and\npeace, making its interest paramount to all other, are linked to the\nworld above, and every blessing needed for this life is theirs. In the\nbook of God\u2019s providence, the volume of life, we are each given a\npage. That page contains every particular of our history; even the\nhairs of the head are numbered. God\u2019s children are never absent\nfrom His mind.\n\u201cBe not therefore anxious for the morrow.\u201d Matthew 6:34, R.\nV . We are to follow Christ day by day. God does not bestow help\nfor tomorrow. He does not give His children all the directions for\ntheir life journey at once, lest they should become confused. He tells\nthem just as much as they can remember and perform. The strength\nand wisdom imparted are for the present emergency. \u201cIf any of you\nlack wisdom,\u201d\u2014for today,\u2014\u201clet him ask of God, that giveth to all\nmen liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\u201d James\n1:5.\n\u201cJudge not, that ye be not judged.\u201d Do not think yourself better [314]\nthan other men, and set yourself up as their judge. Since you cannot\ndiscern motive, you are incapable of judging another. In criticizing\nhim, you are passing sentence upon yourself; for you show that you\nare a participant with Satan, the accuser of the brethren. The Lord\nsays, \u201cExamine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your\nown selves.\u201d This is our work. \u201cIf we would judge ourselves, we\nshould not be judged.\u201d 2 Corinthians 13:5; 1 Corinthians 11:31.\nThe good tree will produce good fruit. If the fruit is unpalatable\nand worthless, the tree is evil. So the fruit borne in the life testifies\nas to the condition of the heart and the excellence of the character.\nGood works can never purchase salvation, but they are an evidence\nof the faith that acts by love and purifies the soul. And though the\neternal reward is not bestowed because of our merit, yet it will be\nin proportion to the work that has been done through the grace of\nChrist.\nThus Christ set forth the principles of His kingdom, and showed\nthem to be the great rule of life. To impress the lesson He adds an\nillustration. It is not enough, He says, for you to hear My words. By\n266 The Desire of Ages\nobedience you must make them the foundation of your character.\nSelf is but shifting sand. If you build upon human theories and\ninventions, your house will fall. By the winds of temptation, the\ntempests of trial, it will be swept away. But these principles that I\nhave given will endure. Receive Me; build on My words.\n\u201cEveryone therefore which heareth these words of Mine, and\ndoeth them, shall be likened unto a wise man, which built his house\nupon the rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and\nthe winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was\nfounded upon the rock.\u201d Matthew 7:24, 25, R.V .\nChapter 32\u2014The Centurion [315]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 8:5-13; Luke 7:1-17.\nChrist had said to the nobleman whose son He healed, \u201cExcept\nye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.\u201d John 4:48. He was\ngrieved that His own nation should require these outward signs of\nHis Messiahship. Again and again He had marveled at their unbelief.\nBut He marveled at the faith of the centurion who came to Him. The\ncenturion did not question the Saviour\u2019s power. He did not even ask\nHim to come in person to perform the miracle. \u201cSpeak the word\nonly,\u201d he said, \u201cand my servant shall be healed.\u201d\nThe centurion\u2019s servant had been stricken with palsy, and lay at\nthe point of death. Among the Romans the servants were slaves,\nbought and sold in the market places, and treated with abuse and\ncruelty; but the centurion was tenderly attached to his servant, and\ngreatly desired his recovery. He believed that Jesus could heal him.\nHe had not seen the Saviour, but the reports he heard had inspired\nhim with faith. Notwithstanding the formalism of the Jews, this\nRoman was convinced that their religion was superior to his own.\nAlready he had broken through the barriers of national prejudice\nand hatred that separated the conquerors from the conquered people.\nHe had manifested respect for the service of God, and had shown\nkindness to the Jews as His worshipers. In the teaching of Christ, as\nit had been reported to him, he found that which met the need of the\nsoul. All that was spiritual within him responded to the Saviour\u2019s\nwords. But he felt unworthy to come into the presence of Jesus,\nand he appealed to the Jewish elders to make request for the healing\nof his servant. They were acquainted with the Great Teacher, and [316]\nwould, he thought, know how to approach Him so as to win His\nfavor.\nAs Jesus entered Capernaum, He was met by a delegation of the\nelders, who told Him of the centurion\u2019s desire. They urged \u201cthat he\n267\n268 The Desire of Ages\nwas worthy for whom He should do this: for he loveth our nation,\nand he hath built us a synagogue.\u201d\nJesus immediately set out for the officer\u2019s home; but, pressed\nby the multitude, He advanced slowly. The news of His coming\npreceded Him, and the centurion, in his self-distrust, sent Him the\nmessage, \u201cLord, trouble not Thyself: for I am not worthy that Thou\nshouldest enter under my roof.\u201d But the Saviour kept on His way,\nand the centurion, venturing at last to approach Him, completed the\nmessage, saying, \u201cNeither thought I myself worthy to come unto\nThee;\u201d \u201cbut speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.\nFor I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I\nsay to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he\ncometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.\u201d As I represent\nthe power of Rome, and my soldiers recognize my authority as\nsupreme, so dost Thou represent the power of the Infinite God, and\nall created things obey Thy word. Thou canst command the disease\nto depart, and it shall obey Thee. Thou canst summon Thy heavenly\nmessengers, and they shall impart healing virtue. Speak but the\nword, and my servant shall be healed.\n\u201cWhen Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned\nHim about, and said unto the people that followed Him, I say unto\nyou, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.\u201d And to the\ncenturion He said, \u201cAs thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.\nAnd his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.\u201d\nThe Jewish elders who recommended the centurion to Christ had\nshown how far they were from possessing the spirit of the gospel.[317]\nThey did not recognize that our great need is our only claim on God\u2019s\nmercy. In their self-righteousness they commended the centurion\nbecause of the favor he had shown to \u201cour nation.\u201d But the centurion\nsaid of himself, \u201cI am not worthy.\u201d His heart had been touched by\nthe grace of Christ. He saw his own unworthiness; yet he feared not\nto ask help. He trusted not to his own goodness; his argument was\nhis great need. His faith took hold upon Christ in His true character.\nHe did not believe in Him merely as a worker of miracles, but as the\nfriend and Saviour of mankind.\nIt is thus that every sinner may come to Christ. \u201cNot by works\nof righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy\nHe saved us.\u201d Titus 3:5. When Satan tells you that you are a sinner,\nCenturion 269\nand cannot hope to receive blessing from God, tell him that Christ\ncame into the world to save sinners. We have nothing to recommend\nus to God; but the plea that we may urge now and ever is our utterly\nhelpless condition that makes His redeeming power a necessity.\nRenouncing all self-dependence, we may look to the cross of Calvary\nand say,\u2014\n\u201cIn my hand no price I bring;\nSimply to Thy cross I cling.\u201d\nThe Jews had been instructed from childhood concerning the\nwork of the Messiah. The inspired utterances of patriarchs and\nprophets and the symbolic teaching of the sacrificial service had\nbeen theirs. But they had disregarded the light; and now they saw in\nJesus nothing to be desired. But the centurion, born in heathenism,\neducated in the idolatry of imperial Rome, trained as a soldier, seem-\ningly cut off from spiritual life by his education and surroundings,\nand still further shut out by the bigotry of the Jews, and by the con-\ntempt of his own countrymen for the people of Israel,\u2014this man\nperceived the truth to which the children of Abraham were blinded.\nHe did not wait to see whether the Jews themselves would receive\nthe One who claimed to be their Messiah. As the \u201clight, which\nlighteth every man that cometh into the world\u201d (John 1:9) had shone\nupon him, he had, though afar off, discerned the glory of the Son of\nGod.\nTo Jesus this was an earnest of the work which the gospel was\nto accomplish among the Gentiles. With joy He looked forward to\nthe gathering of souls from all nations to His kingdom. With deep\nsadness He pictured to the Jews the result of their rejection of His\ngrace: \u201cI say unto you, That many shall come from the east and [318]\nwest, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in\nthe kingdom of heaven. But the children of the kingdom shall be\ncast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing\nof teeth.\u201d Alas, how many are still preparing for the same fatal\ndisappointment! While souls in heathen darkness accept His grace,\nhow many there are in Christian lands upon whom the light shines\nonly to be disregarded.\n270 The Desire of Ages\nMore than twenty miles from Capernaum, on a tableland over-\nlooking the wide, beautiful plain of Esdraelon, lay the village of\nNain, and thither Jesus next bent His steps. Many of His disciples\nand others were with Him, and all along the way the people came,\nlonging for His words of love and pity, bringing their sick for His\nhealing, and ever with the hope that He who wielded such wondrous\npower would make Himself known as the King of Israel. A multi-\ntude thronged His steps, and it was a glad, expectant company that\nfollowed Him up the rocky path toward the gate of the mountain\nvillage.\nAs they draw near, a funeral train is seen coming from the gates.\nWith slow, sad steps it is proceeding to the place of burial. On an\nopen bier carried in front is the body of the dead, and about it are\nthe mourners, filling the air with their wailing cries. All the people\nof the town seem to have gathered to show their respect for the dead\nand their sympathy with the bereaved.\nIt was a sight to awaken sympathy. The deceased was the only\nson of his mother, and she a widow. The lonely mourner was fol-\nlowing to the grave her sole earthly support and comfort. \u201cWhen the\nLord saw her, He had compassion on her.\u201d As she moved on blindly,\nweeping, noting not His presence, He came close beside her, and\ngently said, \u201cWeep not.\u201d Jesus was about to change her grief to joy,\nyet He could not forbear this expression of tender sympathy.\n\u201cHe came and touched the bier;\u201d to Him even contact with death\ncould impart no defilement. The bearers stood still, and the lamenta-\ntions of the mourners ceased. The two companies gathered about the\nbier, hoping against hope. One was present who had banished dis-\nease and vanquished demons; was death also subject to His power?\nIn clear, authoritative voice the words are spoken, \u201cYoung man,\nI say unto thee, Arise.\u201d That voice pierces the ears of the dead. The\nyoung man opens his eyes. Jesus takes him by the hand, and lifts\nhim up. His gaze falls upon her who has been weeping beside him,\nand mother and son unite in a long, clinging, joyous embrace. The\nmultitude look on in silence, as if spellbound. \u201cThere came a fear on[319]\nall.\u201d Hushed and reverent they stood for a little time, as if in the very\npresence of God. Then they \u201cglorified God, saying, That a great\nprophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited His people.\u201d\nThe funeral train returned to Nain as a triumphal procession. \u201cAnd\nCenturion 271\nthis rumor of Him went forth throughout all Judea, and throughout\nall the region round about.\u201d\nHe who stood beside the sorrowing mother at the gate of Nain,\nwatches with every mourning one beside the bier. He is touched\nwith sympathy for our grief. His heart, that loved and pitied, is a\nheart of unchangeable tenderness. His word, that called the dead\nto life, is no less efficacious now than when spoken to the young\nman of Nain. He says, \u201cAll power is given unto Me in heaven and in\nearth.\u201d Matthew 28:18. That power is not diminished by the lapse\nof years, nor exhausted by the ceaseless activity of His overflowing\ngrace. To all who believe on Him He is still a living Saviour.\nJesus changed the mother\u2019s grief to joy when He gave back her [320]\nson; yet the youth was but called forth to this earthly life, to endure\nits sorrows, its toils, and its perils, and to pass again under the power\nof death. But Jesus comforts our sorrow for the dead with a message\nof infinite hope: \u201cI am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold,\nI am alive forevermore, ... and have the keys of hell and of death.\u201d\n\u201cForasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,\nHe also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death\nHe might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;\nand deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime\nsubject to bondage.\u201d Revelation 1:18; Hebrews 2:14, 15.\nSatan cannot hold the dead in his grasp when the Son of God\nbids them live. He cannot hold in spiritual death one soul who in\nfaith receives Christ\u2019s word of power. God is saying to all who are\ndead in sin, \u201cAwake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead.\u201d\nEphesians 5:14. That word is eternal life. As the word of God which\nbade the first man live, still gives us life; as Christ\u2019s word, \u201cYoung\nman, I say unto thee, Arise,\u201d gave life to the youth of Nain, so that\nword, \u201cArise from the dead,\u201d is life to the soul that receives it. God\n\u201chath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us\ninto the kingdom of His dear Son.\u201d Colossians 1:13. It is all offered\nus in His word. If we receive the word, we have the deliverance.\nAnd \u201cif the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell\nin you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken\nyour mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you.\u201d \u201cFor the Lord\nHimself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of\nthe Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ\n272 The Desire of Ages\nshall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught\nup together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and\nso shall we ever be with the Lord.\u201d Romans 8:11; 1 Thessalonians\n4:16, 17. This is the word of comfort wherewith He bids us comfort\none another.\nChapter 33\u2014Who Are My Brethren? [321]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 12:22-50; Mark 3:20-35.\nThe sons of Joseph were far from being in sympathy with Jesus\nin His work. The reports that reached them in regard to His life\nand labors filled them with astonishment and dismay. They heard\nthat He devoted entire nights to prayer, that through the day He was\nthronged by great companies of people, and did not give Himself\ntime so much as to eat. His friends felt that He was wearing Himself\nout by His incessant labor; they were unable to account for His\nattitude toward the Pharisees, and there were some who feared that\nHis reason was becoming unsettled.\nHis brothers heard of this, and also of the charge brought by the\nPharisees that He cast out devils through the power of Satan. They\nfelt keenly the reproach that came upon them through their relation\nto Jesus. They knew what a tumult His words and works created,\nand were not only alarmed at His bold statements, but indignant at\nHis denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees. They decided that\nHe must be persuaded or constrained to cease this manner of labor,\nand they induced Mary to unite with them, thinking that through His\nlove for her they might prevail upon Him to be more prudent.\nIt was just before this that Jesus had a second time performed\nthe miracle of healing a man possessed, blind and dumb, and the\nPharisees had reiterated the charge, \u201cHe casteth out devils through\nthe prince of the devils.\u201d Matthew 9:34. Christ told them plainly\nthat in attributing the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan, they were [322]\ncutting themselves off from the fountain of blessing. Those who had\nspoken against Jesus Himself, not discerning His divine character,\nmight receive forgiveness; for through the Holy Spirit they might be\nbrought to see their error and repent. Whatever the sin, if the soul\nrepents and believes, the guilt is washed away in the blood of Christ;\nbut he who rejects the work of the Holy Spirit is placing himself\nwhere repentance and faith cannot come to him. It is by the Spirit\n273\n274 The Desire of Ages\nthat God works upon the heart; when men willfully reject the Spirit,\nand declare It to be from Satan, they cut off the channel by which\nGod can communicate with them. When the Spirit is finally rejected,\nthere is no more that God can do for the soul.\nThe Pharisees to whom Jesus spoke this warning did not them-\nselves believe the charge they brought against Him. There was not\none of those dignitaries but had felt drawn toward the Saviour. They\nhad heard the Spirit\u2019s voice in their own hearts declaring Him to\nbe the Anointed of Israel, and urging them to confess themselves\nHis disciples. In the light of His presence they had realized their\nunholiness, and had longed for a righteousness which they could not\ncreate. But after their rejection of Him it would be too humiliating\nto receive Him as the Messiah. Having set their feet in the path of\nunbelief, they were too proud to confess their error. And in order to\navoid acknowledging the truth, they tried with desperate violence\nto dispute the Saviour\u2019s teaching. The evidence of His power and\nmercy exasperated them. They could not prevent the Saviour from\nworking miracles, they could not silence His teaching; but they did\neverything in their power to misrepresent Him and to falsify His\nwords. Still the convicting Spirit of God followed them, and they\nhad to build up many barriers in order to withstand its power. The\nmightiest agency that can be brought to bear upon the human heart\nwas striving with them, but they would not yield.\nIt is not God that blinds the eyes of men or hardens their hearts.\nHe sends them light to correct their errors, and to lead them in safe\npaths; it is by the rejection of this light that the eyes are blinded\nand the heart hardened. Often the process is gradual, and almost\nimperceptible. Light comes to the soul through God\u2019s word, through\nHis servants, or by the direct agency of His Spirit; but when one\nray of light is disregarded, there is a partial benumbing of the spir-\nitual perceptions, and the second revealing of light is less clearly\ndiscerned. So the darkness increases, until it is night in the soul.\nThus it had been with these Jewish leaders. They were convinced[323]\nthat a divine power attended Christ, but in order to resist the truth,\nthey attributed the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan. In doing this\nthey deliberately chose deception; they yielded themselves to Satan,\nand henceforth they were controlled by his power.\nWho Are My Brethren? 275\nClosely connected with Christ\u2019s warning in regard to the sin\nagainst the Holy Spirit is a warning against idle and evil words.\nThe words are an indication of that which is in the heart. \u201cOut of\nthe abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\u201d But the words are\nmore than an indication of character; they have power to react on\nthe character. Men are influenced by their own words. Often under\na momentary impulse, prompted by Satan, they give utterance to\njealousy or evil surmising, expressing that which they do not really\nbelieve; but the expression reacts on the thoughts. They are deceived\nby their words, and come to believe that true which was spoken at\nSatan\u2019s instigation. Having once expressed an opinion or decision,\nthey are often too proud to retract it, and try to prove themselves in\nthe right, until they come to believe that they are. It is dangerous\nto utter a word of doubt, dangerous to question and criticize divine\nlight. The habit of careless and irreverent criticism reacts upon\nthe character, in fostering irreverence and unbelief. Many a man\nindulging this habit has gone on unconscious of danger, until he\nwas ready to criticize and reject the work of the Holy Spirit. Jesus\nsaid, \u201cEvery idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account\nthereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be\njustified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.\u201d\nThen He added a warning to those who had been impressed by\nHis words, who had heard Him gladly, but who had not surrendered\nthemselves for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. It is not only by\nresistance but by neglect that the soul is destroyed. \u201cWhen the\nunclean spirit is gone out of a man,\u201d said Jesus, \u201che walketh through\ndry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. Then he saith, I will\nreturn into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come,\nhe findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh\nwith himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they\nenter in and dwell there.\u201d\nThere were many in Christ\u2019s day, as there are today, over whom\nthe control of Satan for the time seemed broken; through the grace\nof God they were set free from the evil spirits that had held dominion\nover the soul. They rejoiced in the love of God; but, like the stony- [324]\nground hearers of the parable, they did not abide in His love. They\ndid not surrender themselves to God daily, that Christ might dwell\nin the heart; and when the evil spirit returned, with \u201cseven other\n276 The Desire of Ages\nspirits more wicked than himself,\u201d they were wholly dominated by\nthe power of evil.\nWhen the soul surrenders itself to Christ, a new power takes\npossession of the new heart. A change is wrought which man can\nnever accomplish for himself. It is a supernatural work, bringing a\nsupernatural element into human nature. The soul that is yielded to\nChrist becomes His own fortress, which He holds in a revolted world,\nand He intends that no authority shall be known in it but His own. A\nsoul thus kept in possession by the heavenly agencies is impregnable\nto the assaults of Satan. But unless we do yield ourselves to the\ncontrol of Christ, we shall be dominated by the wicked one. We\nmust inevitably be under the control of the one or the other of the\ntwo great powers that are contending for the supremacy of the world.\nIt is not necessary for us deliberately to choose the service of the\nkingdom of darkness in order to come under its dominion. We\nhave only to neglect to ally ourselves with the kingdom of light. If\nwe do not co-operate with the heavenly agencies, Satan will take\npossession of the heart, and will make it his abiding place. The only\ndefense against evil is the indwelling of Christ in the heart through\nfaith in His righteousness. Unless we become vitally connected\nwith God, we can never resist the unhallowed effects of self-love,\nself-indulgence, and temptation to sin. We may leave off many bad\nhabits, for the time we may part company with Satan; but without\na vital connection with God, through the surrender of ourselves to\nHim moment by moment, we shall be overcome. Without a personal\nacquaintance with Christ, and a continual communion, we are at the\nmercy of the enemy, and shall do his bidding in the end.\n\u201cThe last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so,\u201d said\nJesus, \u201cshall it be also unto this wicked generation.\u201d There are none\nso hardened as those who have slighted the invitation of mercy, and\ndone despite to the Spirit of grace. The most common manifestation\nof the sin against the Holy Spirit is in persistently slighting Heaven\u2019s\ninvitation to repent. Every step in the rejection of Christ is a step\ntoward the rejection of salvation, and toward the sin against the Holy\nSpirit.\nIn rejecting Christ the Jewish people committed the unpardon-\nable sin; and by refusing the invitation of mercy, we may commit\nthe same error. We offer insult to the Prince of life, and put Him[325]\nWho Are My Brethren? 277\nto shame before the synagogue of Satan and before the heavenly\nuniverse when we refuse to listen to His delegated messengers, and\ninstead listen to the agents of Satan, who would draw the soul away\nfrom Christ. So long as one does this, he can find no hope or pardon,\nand he will finally lose all desire to be reconciled to God.\nWhile Jesus was still teaching the people, His disciples brought\nthe message that His mother and His brothers were without, and\ndesired to see Him. He knew what was in their hearts, and \u201cHe\nanswered and said unto him that told Him, Who is My mother? and\nwho are My brethren? And He stretched forth His hand toward\nHis disciples, and said, Behold My mother and My brethren! For\nwhosoever shall do the will of My Father which is in heaven, the\nsame is My brother, and sister, and mother.\u201d\nAll who would receive Christ by faith were united to Him by\na tie closer than that of human kinship. They would become one\nwith Him, as He was one with the Father. As a believer and doer of\nHis words, His mother was more nearly and savingly related to Him\nthan through her natural relationship. His brothers would receive no\nbenefit from their connection with Him unless they accepted Him as\ntheir personal Saviour.\nWhat a support Christ would have found in His earthly relatives\nif they had believed in Him as one from heaven, and had co-operated\nwith Him in doing the work of God! Their unbelief cast a shadow\nover the earthly life of Jesus. It was a part of the bitterness of that\ncup of woe which He drained for us.\nThe enmity kindled in the human heart against the gospel was [326]\nkeenly felt by the Son of God, and it was most painful to Him in\nHis home; for His own heart was full of kindness and love, and He\nappreciated tender regard in the family relation. His brothers desired\nthat He should concede to their ideas, when such a course would have\nbeen utterly out of harmony with His divine mission. They looked\nupon Him as in need of their counsel. They judged Him from their\nhuman point of view, and thought that if He would speak only such\nthings as would be acceptable to the scribes and Pharisees, He would\navoid the disagreeable controversy that His words aroused. They\nthought that He was beside Himself in claiming divine authority,\nand in placing Himself before the rabbis as a reprover of their sins.\n278 The Desire of Ages\nThey knew that the Pharisees were seeking occasion to accuse Him,\nand they felt that He had given them sufficient occasion.\nWith their short measuring line they could not fathom the mission\nwhich He came to fulfill, and therefore could not sympathize with\nHim in His trials. Their coarse, unappreciative words showed that\nthey had no true perception of His character, and did not discern\nthat the divine blended with the human. They often saw Him full\nof grief; but instead of comforting Him, their spirit and words only\nwounded His heart. His sensitive nature was tortured, His motives\nwere misunderstood, His work was uncomprehended.\nHis brothers often brought forward the philosophy of the Phar-\nisees, which was threadbare and hoary with age, and presumed to\nthink that they could teach Him who understood all truth, and com-\nprehended all mysteries. They freely condemned that which they\ncould not understand. Their reproaches probed Him to the quick,\nand His soul was wearied and distressed. They avowed faith in God,\nand thought they were vindicating God, when God was with them\nin the flesh, and they knew Him not.\nThese things made His path a thorny one to travel. So pained\nwas Christ by the misapprehension in His own home that it was a\nrelief to Him to go where it did not exist. There was one home that\nHe loved to visit,\u2014the home of Lazarus, and Mary, and Martha; for\nin the atmosphere of faith and love His spirit had rest. Yet there were\nnone on earth who could comprehend His divine mission, or know\nthe burden which He bore in behalf of humanity. Often He could\nfind relief only in being alone, and communing with His heavenly\nFather.\nThose who are called to suffer for Christ\u2019s sake, who have to[327]\nendure misapprehension and distrust, even in their own home, may\nfind comfort in the thought that Jesus has endured the same. He is\nmoved with compassion for them. He bids them find companionship\nin Him, and relief where He found it, in communion with the Father.\nThose who accept Christ as their personal Saviour are not left\nas orphans, to bear the trials of life alone. He receives them as\nmembers of the heavenly family; He bids them call His Father their\nFather. They are His \u201clittle ones,\u201d dear to the heart of God, bound\nto Him by the most tender and abiding ties. He has toward them an\nexceeding tenderness, as far surpassing what our father or mother\nWho Are My Brethren? 279\nhas felt toward us in our helplessness as the divine is above the\nhuman.\nOf Christ\u2019s relation to His people, there is a beautiful illustration\nin the laws given to Israel. When through poverty a Hebrew had\nbeen forced to part with his patrimony, and to sell himself as a\nbondservant, the duty of redeeming him and his inheritance fell to\nthe one who was nearest of kin. See Leviticus 25:25, 47-49; Ruth\n2:20. So the work of redeeming us and our inheritance, lost through\nsin, fell upon Him who is \u201cnear of kin\u201d unto us. It was to redeem\nus that He became our kinsman. Closer than father, mother, brother,\nfriend, or lover is the Lord our Saviour. \u201cFear not,\u201d He says, \u201cfor I\nhave redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art Mine.\u201d\n\u201cSince thou wast precious in My sight, thou hast been honorable,\nand I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people\nfor thy life.\u201d Isaiah 43:1, 4.\nChrist loves the heavenly beings that surround His throne; but\nwhat shall account for the great love wherewith He has loved us?\nWe cannot understand it, but we can know it true in our own experi-\nence. And if we do hold the relation of kinship to Him, with what\ntenderness should we regard those who are brethren and sisters of\nour Lord! Should we not be quick to recognize the claims of our\ndivine relationship? Adopted into the family of God, should we not\nhonor our Father and our kindred?\nChapter 34\u2014The Invitation[328]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 11:28-30.\n\u201cCome unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will\ngive you rest.\u201d\nThese words of comfort were spoken to the multitude that fol-\nlowed Jesus. The Saviour had said that only through Himself could\nmen receive a knowledge of God. He had spoken of His disciples as\nthe ones to whom a knowledge of heavenly things had been given.\nBut He left none to feel themselves shut out from His care and love.\nAll who labor and are heavy-laden may come unto Him.\nScribes and rabbis, with their punctilious attention to religious\nforms, had a sense of want that rites of penance could never satisfy.\nPublicans and sinners might pretend to be content with the sensual\nand earthly, but in their hearts were distrust and fear. Jesus looked\nupon the distressed and heart burdened, those whose hopes were\nblighted, and who with earthly joys were seeking to quiet the longing\nof the soul, and He invited all to find rest in Him.\nTenderly He bade the toiling people, \u201cTake My yoke upon you,\nand learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find\nrest unto your souls.\u201d\nIn these words Christ is speaking to every human being. Whether\nthey know it or not, all are weary and heavy-laden. All are weighed\ndown with burdens that only Christ can remove. The heaviest burden\nthat we bear is the burden of sin. If we were left to bear this burden,\nit would crush us. But the Sinless One has taken our place. \u201cThe[329]\nLord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all.\u201d Isaiah 53:6. He has\nborne the burden of our guilt. He will take the load from our weary\nshoulders. He will give us rest. The burden of care and sorrow also\nHe will bear. He invites us to cast all our care upon Him; for He\ncarries us upon His heart.\nThe Elder Brother of our race is by the eternal throne. He looks\nupon every soul who is turning his face toward Him as the Saviour.\n280\nInvitation 281\nHe knows by experience what are the weaknesses of humanity, what\nare our wants, and where lies the strength of our temptations; for\nHe was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. He is\nwatching over you, trembling child of God. Are you tempted? He\nwill deliver. Are you weak? He will strengthen. Are you ignorant?\nHe will enlighten. Are you wounded? He will heal. The Lord \u201ctelleth\nthe number of the stars;\u201d and yet \u201cHe healeth the broken in heart, and\nbindeth up their wounds.\u201d Psalm 147:4, 3. \u201cCome unto Me,\u201d is His\ninvitation. Whatever your anxieties and trials, spread out your case\nbefore the Lord. Your spirit will be braced for endurance. The way\nwill be opened for you to disentangle yourself from embarrassment\nand difficulty. The weaker and more helpless you know yourself\nto be, the stronger will you become in His strength. The heavier\nyour burdens, the more blessed the rest in casting them upon the\nBurden Bearer. The rest that Christ offers depends upon conditions,\nbut these conditions are plainly specified. They are those with which\nall can comply. He tells us just how His rest is to be found.\n\u201cTake My yoke upon you,\u201d Jesus says. The yoke is an instrument\nof service. Cattle are yoked for labor, and the yoke is essential that\nthey may labor effectually. By this illustration Christ teaches us that\nwe are called to service as long as life shall last. We are to take upon\nus His yoke, that we may be co-workers with Him.\nThe yoke that binds to service is the law of God. The great law\nof love revealed in Eden, proclaimed upon Sinai, and in the new\ncovenant written in the heart, is that which binds the human worker to\nthe will of God. If we were left to follow our own inclinations, to go\njust where our will would lead us, we should fall into Satan\u2019s ranks\nand become possessors of his attributes. Therefore God confines us\nto His will, which is high, and noble, and elevating. He desires that\nwe shall patiently and wisely take up the duties of service. The yoke\nof service Christ Himself has borne in humanity. He said, \u201cI delight\nto do Thy will, O My God: yea, Thy law is within My heart.\u201d Psalm\n40:8. \u201cI came down from heaven, not to do Mine own will, but the [330]\nwill of Him that sent Me.\u201d John 6:38. Love for God, zeal for His\nglory, and love for fallen humanity, brought Jesus to earth to suffer\nand to die. This was the controlling power of His life. This principle\nHe bids us adopt.\n282 The Desire of Ages\nThere are many whose hearts are aching under a load of care\nbecause they seek to reach the world\u2019s standard. They have chosen\nits service, accepted its perplexities, adopted its customs. Thus their\ncharacter is marred, and their life made a weariness. In order to\ngratify ambition and worldly desires, they wound the conscience,\nand bring upon themselves an additional burden of remorse. The\ncontinual worry is wearing out the life forces. Our Lord desires\nthem to lay aside this yoke of bondage. He invites them to accept\nHis yoke; He says, \u201cMy yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\u201d He\nbids them seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and\nHis promise is that all things needful to them for this life shall be\nadded. Worry is blind, and cannot discern the future; but Jesus sees\nthe end from the beginning. In every difficulty He has His way\nprepared to bring relief. Our heavenly Father has a thousand ways\nto provide for us, of which we know nothing. Those who accept the\none principle of making the service and honor of God supreme will\nfind perplexities vanish, and a plain path before their feet.\n\u201cLearn of Me,\u201d says Jesus; \u201cfor I am meek and lowly in heart:\nand ye shall find rest.\u201d We are to enter the school of Christ, to learn\nfrom Him meekness and lowliness. Redemption is that process\nby which the soul is trained for heaven. This training means a\nknowledge of Christ. It means emancipation from ideas, habits,\nand practices that have been gained in the school of the prince of\ndarkness. The soul must be delivered from all that is opposed to\nloyalty to God.\nIn the heart of Christ, where reigned perfect harmony with God,\nthere was perfect peace. He was never elated by applause, nor\ndejected by censure or disappointment. Amid the greatest opposition\nand the most cruel treatment, He was still of good courage. But many\nwho profess to be His followers have an anxious, troubled heart,\nbecause they are afraid to trust themselves with God. They do\nnot make a complete surrender to Him; for they shrink from the\nconsequences that such a surrender may involve. Unless they do\nmake this surrender, they cannot find peace.\nIt is the love of self that brings unrest. When we are born from\nabove, the same mind will be in us that was in Jesus, the mind that\nled Him to humble Himself that we might be saved. Then we shall[331]\nnot be seeking the highest place. We shall desire to sit at the feet\nInvitation 283\nof Jesus, and learn of Him. We shall understand that the value of\nour work does not consist in making a show and noise in the world,\nand in being active and zealous in our own strength. The value of\nour work is in proportion to the impartation of the Holy Spirit. Trust\nin God brings holier qualities of mind, so that in patience we may\npossess our souls.\nThe yoke is placed upon the oxen to aid them in drawing the\nload, to lighten the burden. So with the yoke of Christ. When our\nwill is swallowed up in the will of God, and we use His gifts to\nbless others, we shall find life\u2019s burden light. He who walks in the\nway of God\u2019s commandments is walking in company with Christ,\nand in His love the heart is at rest. When Moses prayed, \u201cShow\nme now Thy way, that I may know Thee,\u201d the Lord answered him,\n\u201cMy presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.\u201d And\nthrough the prophets the message was given, \u201cThus saith the Lord,\nStand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the\ngood way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.\u201d\nExodus 33:13, 14; Jeremiah 6:16. And He says, \u201cO that thou hadst\nhearkened to My commandments! then had thy peace been as a\nriver, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea.\u201d Isaiah 48:18.\nThose who take Christ at His word, and surrender their souls to\nHis keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace and quietude.\nNothing of the world can make them sad when Jesus makes them\nglad by His presence. In perfect acquiescence there is perfect rest.\nThe Lord says, \u201cThou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind\nis stayed on Thee: because he trusteth in Thee.\u201d Isaiah 26:3. Our\nlives may seem a tangle; but as we commit ourselves to the wise\nMaster Worker, He will bring out the pattern of life and character\nthat will be to His own glory. And that character which expresses\nthe glory\u2014character\u2014of Christ will be received into the Paradise\nof God. A renovated race shall walk with Him in white, for they are\nworthy.\nAs through Jesus we enter into rest, heaven begins here. We\nrespond to His invitation, Come, learn of Me, and in thus coming\nwe begin the life eternal. Heaven is a ceaseless approaching to God\nthrough Christ. The longer we are in the heaven of bliss, the more\nand still more of glory will be opened to us; and the more we know\nof God, the more intense will be our happiness. As we walk with\n284 The Desire of Ages\nJesus in this life, we may be filled with His love, satisfied with His\npresence. All that human nature can bear, we may receive here. But[332]\nwhat is this compared with the hereafter? There \u201care they before the\nthrone of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple: and He\nthat sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger\nno more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them,\nnor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall\nfeed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and\nGod shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.\u201d Revelation 7:15-17.\nChapter 35\u2014\u201cPeace, Be Still\u201d [333]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 8:23-34; Mark 4:35-41; Mark\n5:1-20; Luke 8:22-39.\nIt had been an eventful day in the life of Jesus. Beside the Sea\nof Galilee He had spoken His first parables, by familiar illustrations\nagain explaining to the people the nature of His kingdom and the\nmanner in which it was to be established. He had likened His own\nwork to that of the sower; the development of His kingdom to the\ngrowth of the mustard seed and the effect of leaven in the measure of\nmeal. The great final separation of the righteous and the wicked He\nhad pictured in the parables of the wheat and tares and the fishing\nnet. The exceeding preciousness of the truths He taught had been\nillustrated by the hidden treasure and the pearl of great price, while\nin the parable of the householder He taught His disciples how they\nwere to labor as His representatives.\nAll day He had been teaching and healing; and as evening came\non the crowds still pressed upon Him. Day after day He had min-\nistered to them, scarcely pausing for food or rest. The malicious\ncriticism and misrepresentation with which the Pharisees constantly\npursued Him made His labors much more severe and harassing;\nand now the close of the day found Him so utterly wearied that He\ndetermined to seek retirement in some solitary place across the lake.\nThe eastern shore of Gennesaret was not uninhabited, for there\nwere towns here and there beside the lake; yet it was a desolate\nregion when compared with the western side. It contained a popula- [334]\ntion more heathen than Jewish, and had little communication with\nGalilee. Thus it offered Jesus the seclusion He sought, and He now\nbade His disciples accompany Him thither.\nAfter He had dismissed the multitude, they took Him, even \u201cas\nHe was,\u201d into the boat, and hastily set off. But they were not to\ndepart alone. There were other fishing boats lying near the shore,\n285\n286 The Desire of Ages\nand these were quickly crowded with people who followed Jesus,\neager still to see and hear Him.\nThe Saviour was at last relieved from the pressure of the multi-\ntude, and, overcome with weariness and hunger, He lay down in the\nstern of the boat, and soon fell asleep. The evening had been calm\nand pleasant, and quiet rested upon the lake; but suddenly darkness\noverspread the sky, the wind swept wildly down the mountain gorges\nalong the eastern shore, and a fierce tempest burst upon the lake.\nThe sun had set, and the blackness of night settled down upon\nthe stormy sea. The waves, lashed into fury by the howling winds,\ndashed fiercely over the disciples\u2019 boat, and threatened to engulf\nit. Those hardy fishermen had spent their lives upon the lake, and\nhad guided their craft safely through many a storm; but now their\nstrength and skill availed nothing. They were helpless in the grasp\nof the tempest, and hope failed them as they saw that their boat was\nfilling.\nAbsorbed in their efforts to save themselves, they had forgotten\nthat Jesus was on board. Now, seeing their labor vain and only death\nbefore them, they remembered at whose command they had set out\nto cross the sea. In Jesus was their only hope. In their helplessness\nand despair they cried, \u201cMaster, Master!\u201d But the dense darkness hid\nHim from their sight. Their voices were drowned by the roaring of\nthe tempest, and there was no reply. Doubt and fear assailed them.\nHad Jesus forsaken them? Was He who had conquered disease and\ndemons, and even death, powerless to help His disciples now? Was\nHe unmindful of them in their distress?\nAgain they call, but there is no answer except the shrieking of the\nangry blast. Already their boat is sinking. A moment, and apparently\nthey will be swallowed up by the hungry waters.\nSuddenly a flash of lightning pierces the darkness, and they see\nJesus lying asleep, undisturbed by the tumult. In amazement and\ndespair they exclaim, \u201cMaster, carest Thou not that we perish?\u201d How\ncan He rest so peacefully, while they are in danger and battling with\ndeath?\nTheir cry arouses Jesus. As the lightning\u2019s glare reveals Him,[335]\nthey see the peace of heaven in His face; they read in His glance\nself-forgetful, tender love, and, their hearts turning to Him, cry,\n\u201cLord, save us: we perish.\u201d\n\u201cPeace, Be Still\u201d 287\nNever did a soul utter that cry unheeded. As the disciples grasp\ntheir oars to make a last effort, Jesus rises. He stands in the midst of\nHis disciples, while the tempest rages, the waves break over them,\nand the lightning illuminates His countenance. He lifts His hand, so\noften employed in deeds of mercy, and says to the angry sea, \u201cPeace,\nbe still.\u201d\nThe storm ceases. The billows sink to rest. The clouds roll\naway, and the stars shine forth. The boat rests upon a quiet sea.\nThen turning to His disciples, Jesus asks sorrowfully, \u201cWhy are ye\nfearful? have ye not yet faith?\u201d Mark 4:40, R.V .\nA hush fell upon the disciples. Even Peter did not attempt to\nexpress the awe that filled his heart. The boats that had set out to\naccompany Jesus had been in the same peril with that of the disciples.\nTerror and despair had seized their occupants; but the command of\nJesus brought quiet to the scene of tumult. The fury of the storm had\ndriven the boats into close proximity, and all on board beheld the\nmiracle. In the calm that followed, fear was forgotten. The people\nwhispered among themselves, \u201cWhat manner of man is this, that\neven the winds and the sea obey Him?\u201d\nWhen Jesus was awakened to meet the storm, He was in perfect [336]\npeace. There was no trace of fear in word or look, for no fear was in\nHis heart. But He rested not in the possession of almighty power. It\nwas not as the \u201cMaster of earth and sea and sky\u201d that He reposed in\nquiet. That power He had laid down, and He says, \u201cI can of Mine\nown self do nothing.\u201d John 5:30. He trusted in the Father\u2019s might. It\nwas in faith\u2014faith in God\u2019s love and care\u2014that Jesus rested, and the\npower of that word which stilled the storm was the power of God.\nAs Jesus rested by faith in the Father\u2019s care, so we are to rest\nin the care of our Saviour. If the disciples had trusted in Him, they\nwould have been kept in peace. Their fear in the time of danger\nrevealed their unbelief. In their efforts to save themselves, they\nforgot Jesus; and it was only when, in despair of self-dependence,\nthey turned to Him that He could give them help.\nHow often the disciples\u2019 experience is ours! When the tempests\nof temptation gather, and the fierce lightnings flash, and the waves\nsweep over us, we battle with the storm alone, forgetting that there\nis One who can help us. We trust to our own strength till our hope\nis lost, and we are ready to perish. Then we remember Jesus, and\n288 The Desire of Ages\nif we call upon Him to save us, we shall not cry in vain. Though\nHe sorrowfully reproves our unbelief and self-confidence, He never\nfails to give us the help we need. Whether on the land or on the sea,\nif we have the Saviour in our hearts, there is no need of fear. Living\nfaith in the Redeemer will smooth the sea of life, and will deliver us\nfrom danger in the way that He knows to be best.\nThere is another spiritual lesson in this miracle of the stilling\nof the tempest. Every man\u2019s experience testifies to the truth of the\nwords of Scripture, \u201cThe wicked are like the troubled sea, when it\ncannot rest.... There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.\u201d Isaiah\n57:20, 21. Sin has destroyed our peace. While self is unsubdued,\nwe can find no rest. The masterful passions of the heart no human\npower can control. We are as helpless here as were the disciples\nto quiet the raging storm. But He who spoke peace to the billows\nof Galilee has spoken the word of peace for every soul. However\nfierce the tempest, those who turn to Jesus with the cry, \u201cLord, save\nus,\u201d will find deliverance. His grace, that reconciles the soul to God,\nquiets the strife of human passion, and in His love the heart is at\nrest. \u201cHe maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are\nstill. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so He bringeth them[337]\nunto their desired haven.\u201d Psalm 107:29, 30. \u201cBeing justified by\nfaith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d \u201cThe\nwork of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness\nquietness and assurance forever.\u201d Romans 5:1; Isaiah 32:17.\nIn the early morning the Saviour and His companions came to\nshore, and the light of the rising sun touched sea and land as with the\nbenediction of peace. But no sooner had they stepped upon the beach\nthan their eyes were greeted by a sight more terrible than the fury of\nthe tempest. From some hiding place among the tombs, two madmen\nrushed upon them as if to tear them in pieces. Hanging about these\nmen were parts of chains which they had broken in escaping from\nconfinement. Their flesh was torn and bleeding where they had cut\nthemselves with sharp stones. Their eyes glared out from their long\nand matted hair, the very likeness of humanity seemed to have been\nblotted out by the demons that possessed them, and they looked\nmore like wild beasts than like men.\nThe disciples and their companions fled in terror; but presently\nthey noticed that Jesus was not with them, and they turned to look\n\u201cPeace, Be Still\u201d 289\nfor Him. He was standing where they had left Him. He who had\nstilled the tempest, who had before met Satan and conquered him,\ndid not flee before these demons. When the men, gnashing their\nteeth, and foaming at the mouth, approached Him, Jesus raised that\nhand which had beckoned the waves to rest, and the men could come\nno nearer. They stood raging but helpless before Him.\nWith authority He bade the unclean spirits come out of them. His\nwords penetrated the darkened minds of the unfortunate men. They\nrealized dimly that One was near who could save them from the [338]\ntormenting demons. They fell at the Saviour\u2019s feet to worship Him;\nbut when their lips were opened to entreat His mercy, the demons\nspoke through them, crying vehemently, \u201cWhat have I to do with\nThee, Jesus, Thou Son of God most high? I beseech Thee, torment\nme not.\u201d\nJesus asked, \u201cWhat is thy name?\u201d And the answer was, \u201cMy\nname is Legion: for we are many.\u201d Using the afflicted men as medi-\nums of communication, they besought Jesus not to send them out\nof the country. Upon a mountainside not far distant a great herd of\nswine was feeding. Into these the demons asked to be allowed to\nenter, and Jesus suffered them. Immediately a panic seized the herd.\nThey rushed madly down the cliff, and, unable to check themselves\nupon the shore, plunged into the lake, and perished.\nMeanwhile a marvelous change had come over the demoniacs.\nLight had shone into their minds. Their eyes beamed with intelli-\ngence. The countenances, so long deformed into the image of Satan,\nbecame suddenly mild, the bloodstained hands were quiet, and with\nglad voices the men praised God for their deliverance.\nFrom the cliff the keepers of the swine had seen all that had oc-\ncurred, and they hurried away to publish the news to their employers\nand to all the people. In fear and amazement the whole population\nflocked to meet Jesus. The two demoniacs had been the terror of the\ncountry. No one had been safe to pass the place where they were;\nfor they would rush upon every traveler with the fury of demons.\nNow these men were clothed and in their right mind, sitting at the\nfeet of Jesus, listening to His words, and glorifying the name of\nHim who had made them whole. But the people who beheld this\nwonderful scene did not rejoice. The loss of the swine seemed to\n290 The Desire of Ages\nthem of greater moment than the deliverance of these captives of\nSatan.\nIt was in mercy to the owners of the swine that this loss had been\npermitted to come upon them. They were absorbed in earthly things,\nand cared not for the great interests of spiritual life. Jesus desired\nto break the spell of selfish indifference, that they might accept His\ngrace. But regret and indignation for their temporal loss blinded[339]\ntheir eyes to the Saviour\u2019s mercy.\nThe manifestation of supernatural power aroused the supersti-\ntions of the people, and excited their fears. Further calamities might\nfollow from having this Stranger among them. They apprehended\nfinancial ruin, and determined to be freed from His presence. Those\nwho had crossed the lake with Jesus told of all that had happened on\nthe preceding night, of their peril in the tempest, and how the wind\nand the sea had been stilled. But their words were without effect. In\nterror the people thronged about Jesus, beseeching Him to depart\nfrom them, and He complied, taking ship at once for the opposite\nshore.\nThe people of Gergesa had before them the living evidence of\nChrist\u2019s power and mercy. They saw the men who had been restored\nto reason; but they were so fearful of endangering their earthly\ninterests that He who had vanquished the prince of darkness before\ntheir eyes was treated as an intruder, and the Gift of heaven was\nturned from their doors. We have not the opportunity of turning from\nthe person of Christ as had the Gergesenes; but still there are many\nwho refuse to obey His word, because obedience would involve the\nsacrifice of some worldly interest. Lest His presence shall cause\nthem pecuniary loss, many reject His grace, and drive His Spirit\nfrom them.\nBut far different was the feeling of the restored demoniacs. They\ndesired the company of their deliverer. In His presence they felt\nsecure from the demons that had tormented their lives and wasted\ntheir manhood. As Jesus was about to enter the boat, they kept close\nto His side, knelt at His feet, and begged Him to keep them near\nHim, where they might ever listen to His words. But Jesus bade\nthem go home and tell what great things the Lord had done for them.\nHere was a work for them to do,\u2014to go to a heathen home, and\ntell of the blessing they had received from Jesus. It was hard for\n\u201cPeace, Be Still\u201d 291\nthem to be separated from the Saviour. Great difficulties were sure to\nbeset them in association with their heathen countrymen. And their\nlong isolation from society seemed to have disqualified them for the\nwork He had indicated. But as soon as Jesus pointed out their duty\nthey were ready to obey. Not only did they tell their own households\nand neighbors about Jesus, but they went throughout Decapolis,\neverywhere declaring His power to save, and describing how He had\nfreed them from the demons. In doing this work they could receive\na greater blessing than if, merely for benefit to themselves, they had [340]\nremained in His presence. It is in working to spread the good news\nof salvation that we are brought near to the Saviour.\nThe two restored demoniacs were the first missionaries whom\nChrist sent to preach the gospel in the region of Decapolis. For a few\nmoments only these men had been privileged to hear the teachings\nof Christ. Not one sermon from His lips had ever fallen upon their\nears. They could not instruct the people as the disciples who had\nbeen daily with Christ were able to do. But they bore in their own\npersons the evidence that Jesus was the Messiah. They could tell\nwhat they knew; what they themselves had seen, and heard, and felt\nof the power of Christ. This is what everyone can do whose heart\nhas been touched by the grace of God. John, the beloved disciple,\nwrote: \u201cThat which was from the beginning, which we have heard,\nwhich we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and\nour hands have handled, of the Word of life; ... that which we have\nseen and heard declare we unto you.\u201d 1 John 1:1-3. As witnesses for\nChrist, we are to tell what we know, what we ourselves have seen\nand heard and felt. If we have been following Jesus step by step, we\nshall have something right to the point to tell concerning the way in\nwhich He has led us. We can tell how we have tested His promise,\nand found the promise true. We can bear witness to what we have\nknown of the grace of Christ. This is the witness for which our Lord\ncalls, and for want of which the world is perishing.\nThough the people of Gergesa had not received Jesus, He did\nnot leave them to the darkness they had chosen. When they bade\nHim depart from them, they had not heard His words. They were\nignorant of that which they were rejecting. Therefore He again sent\nthe light to them, and by those to whom they would not refuse to\nlisten.\n292 The Desire of Ages\nIn causing the destruction of the swine, it was Satan\u2019s purpose to\nturn the people away from the Saviour, and prevent the preaching of\nthe gospel in that region. But this very occurrence roused the whole\ncountry as nothing else could have done, and directed attention to\nChrist. Though the Saviour Himself departed, the men whom He\nhad healed remained as witnesses to His power. Those who had\nbeen mediums of the prince of darkness became channels of light,\nmessengers of the Son of God. Men marveled as they listened to the\nwondrous news. A door was opened to the gospel throughout that\nregion. When Jesus returned to Decapolis, the people flocked about\nHim, and for three days, not merely the inhabitants of one town,[341]\nbut thousands from all the surrounding region, heard the message\nof salvation. Even the power of demons is under the control of our\nSaviour, and the working of evil is overruled for good.\nThe encounter with the demoniacs of Gergesa had a lesson for\nthe disciples. It showed the depths of degradation to which Satan\nis seeking to drag the whole human race, and the mission of Christ\nto set men free from his power. Those wretched beings, dwelling\nin the place of graves, possessed by demons, in bondage to un-\ncontrolled passions and loathsome lusts, represent what humanity\nwould become if given up to satanic jurisdiction. Satan\u2019s influence\nis constantly exerted upon men to distract the senses, control the\nmind for evil, and incite to violence and crime. He weakens the\nbody, darkens the intellect, and debases the soul. Whenever men\nreject the Saviour\u2019s invitation, they are yielding themselves to Satan.\nMultitudes in every department in life, in the home, in business, and\neven in the church, are doing this today. It is because of this that\nviolence and crime have overspread the earth, and moral darkness,\nlike the pall of death, enshrouds the habitations of men. Through his\nspecious temptations Satan leads men to worse and worse evils, till\nutter depravity and ruin are the result. The only safeguard against\nhis power is found in the presence of Jesus. Before men and angels\nSatan has been revealed as man\u2019s enemy and destroyer; Christ, as\nman\u2019s friend and deliverer. His Spirit will develop in man all that\nwill ennoble the character and dignify the nature. It will build man\nup for the glory of God in body and soul and spirit. \u201cFor God hath\nnot given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a\nsound mind.\u201d 2 Timothy 1:7. He has called us \u201cto the obtaining of\n\u201cPeace, Be Still\u201d 293\nthe glory\u201d\u2014character\u2014\u201cof our Lord Jesus Christ;\u201d has called us\nto be \u201cconformed to the image of His Son.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 2:14;\nRomans 8:29.\nAnd souls that have been degraded into instruments of Satan\nare still through the power of Christ transformed into messengers of\nrighteousness, and sent forth by the Son of God to tell what \u201cgreat\nthings the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on\nthee.\u201d\nChapter 36\u2014The Touch of Faith[342]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 9:18-26; Mark 5:21-43; Luke\n8:40-56.\nReturning from Gergesa to the western shore, Jesus found a\nmultitude gathered to receive Him, and they greeted Him with joy.\nHe remained by the seaside for a time, teaching and healing, and\nthen repaired to the house of Levi-Matthew to meet the publicans at\nthe feast. Here Jairus, the ruler of the synagogue, found Him.\nThis elder of the Jews came to Jesus in great distress, and cast\nhimself at His feet, exclaiming, \u201cMy little daughter lieth at the point\nof death: I pray Thee, come and lay Thy hands on her, that she may\nbe healed; and she shall live.\u201d\nJesus set out at once with the ruler for his home. Though the\ndisciples had seen so many of His works of mercy, they were sur-\nprised at His compliance with the entreaty of the haughty rabbi; yet\nthey accompanied their Master, and the people followed, eager and\nexpectant.\nThe ruler\u2019s house was not far distant, but Jesus and His compan-\nions advanced slowly, for the crowd pressed Him on every side. The\nanxious father was impatient of delay; but Jesus, pitying the people,\nstopped now and then to relieve some suffering one, or to comfort a\ntroubled heart.\nWhile they were still on the way, a messenger pressed through\nthe crowd, bearing to Jairus the news that his daughter was dead,\nand it was useless to trouble the Master further. The word caught\nthe ear of Jesus. \u201cFear not,\u201d He said; \u201cbelieve only, and she shall be[343]\nmade whole.\u201d\nJairus pressed closer to the Saviour, and together they hurried to\nthe ruler\u2019s home. Already the hired mourners and flute players were\nthere, filling the air with their clamor. The presence of the crowd,\nand the tumult jarred upon the spirit of Jesus. He tried to silence\nthem, saying, \u201cWhy make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not\n294\nTouch of Faith 295\ndead, but sleepeth.\u201d They were indignant at the words of the Stranger.\nThey had seen the child in the embrace of death, and they laughed\nHim to scorn. Requiring them all to leave the house, Jesus took with\nHim the father and mother of the maiden, and the three disciples,\nPeter, James, and John, and together they entered the chamber of\ndeath.\nJesus approached the bedside, and, taking the child\u2019s hand in His\nown, He pronounced softly, in the familiar language of her home,\nthe words, \u201cDamsel, I say unto thee, arise.\u201d\nInstantly a tremor passed through the unconscious form. The\npulses of life beat again. The lips unclosed with a smile. The eyes\nopened widely as if from sleep, and the maiden gazed with wonder\non the group beside her. She arose, and her parents clasped her in\ntheir arms, and wept for joy.\nOn the way to the ruler\u2019s house, Jesus had met, in the crowd,\na poor woman who for twelve years had suffered from a disease\nthat made her life a burden. She had spent all her means upon\nphysicians and remedies, only to be pronounced incurable. But her\nhopes revived when she heard of the cures that Christ performed.\nShe felt assured that if she could only go to Him she would be healed.\nIn weakness and suffering she came to the seaside where He was\nteaching, and tried to press through the crowd, but in vain. Again\nshe followed Him from the house of Levi-Matthew, but was still\nunable to reach Him. She had begun to despair, when, in making\nHis way through the multitude, He came near where she was.\nThe golden opportunity had come. She was in the presence of\nthe Great Physician! But amid the confusion she could not speak to\nHim, nor catch more than a passing glimpse of His figure. Fearful\nof losing her one chance of relief, she pressed forward, saying to\nherself, \u201cIf I may but touch His garment, I shall be whole.\u201d As He\nwas passing, she reached forward, and succeeded in barely touching\nthe border of His garment. But in that moment she knew that she was\nhealed. In that one touch was concentrated the faith of her life, and\ninstantly her pain and feebleness gave place to the vigor of perfect\nhealth.\nWith a grateful heart she then tried to withdraw from the crowd; [344]\nbut suddenly Jesus stopped, and the people halted with Him. He\nturned, and looking about asked in a voice distinctly heard above\n296 The Desire of Ages\nthe confusion of the multitude, \u201cWho touched Me?\u201d The people\nanswered this query with a look of amazement. Jostled upon all\nsides, and rudely pressed hither and thither, as He was, it seemed a\nstrange inquiry.\nPeter, ever ready to speak, said, \u201cMaster, the multitude throng\nThee and press Thee, and sayest Thou, Who touched Me?\u201d Jesus\nanswered, \u201cSomebody hath touched Me: for I perceive that virtue is\ngone out of Me.\u201d The Saviour could distinguish the touch of faith\nfrom the casual contact of the careless throng. Such trust should not\nbe passed without comment. He would speak to the humble woman\nwords of comfort that would be to her a wellspring of joy,\u2014words\nthat would be a blessing to His followers to the close of time.\nLooking toward the woman, Jesus insisted on knowing who\nhad touched Him. Finding concealment vain, she came forward\ntremblingly, and cast herself at His feet. With grateful tears she[345]\n[346]\n[347]\ntold the story of her suffering, and how she had found relief. Jesus\ngently said, \u201cDaughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made\nthee whole; go in peace.\u201d He gave no opportunity for superstition to\nclaim healing virtue for the mere act of touching His garments. It\nwas not through the outward contact with Him, but through the faith\nwhich took hold on His divine power, that the cure was wrought.\nThe wondering crowd that pressed close about Christ realized no\naccession of vital power. But when the suffering woman put forth\nher hand to touch Him, believing that she would be made whole,\nshe felt the healing virtue. So in spiritual things. To talk of religion\nin a casual way, to pray without soul hunger and living faith, avails\nnothing. A nominal faith in Christ, which accepts Him merely as the\nSaviour of the world, can never bring healing to the soul. The faith\nthat is unto salvation is not a mere intellectual assent to the truth. He\nwho waits for entire knowledge before he will exercise faith, cannot\nreceive blessing from God. It is not enough to believe about Christ;\nwe must believe in Him. The only faith that will benefit us is that\nwhich embraces Him as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His\nmerits to ourselves. Many hold faith as an opinion. Saving faith\nis a transaction by which those who receive Christ join themselves\nin covenant relation with God. Genuine faith is life. A living faith\nmeans an increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by which the soul\nbecomes a conquering power.\nTouch of Faith 297\nAfter healing the woman, Jesus desired her to acknowledge the\nblessing she had received. The gifts which the gospel offers are not\nto be secured by stealth or enjoyed in secret. So the Lord calls upon\nus for confession of His goodness. \u201cYe are My witnesses, saith the\nLord, that I am God.\u201d Isaiah 43:12.\nOur confession of His faithfulness is Heaven\u2019s chosen agency\nfor revealing Christ to the world. We are to acknowledge His grace\nas made known through the holy men of old; but that which will\nbe most effectual is the testimony of our own experience. We are\nwitnesses for God as we reveal in ourselves the working of a power\nthat is divine. Every individual has a life distinct from all others, and\nan experience differing essentially from theirs. God desires that our\npraise shall ascend to Him, marked by our own individuality. These\nprecious acknowledgments to the praise of the glory of His grace,\nwhen supported by a Christ-like life, have an irresistible power that\nworks for the salvation of souls.\nWhen the ten lepers came to Jesus for healing, He bade them go [348]\nand show themselves to the priest. On the way they were cleansed,\nbut only one of them returned to give Him glory. The others went\ntheir way, forgetting Him who had made them whole. How many\nare still doing the same thing! The Lord works continually to benefit\nmankind. He is ever imparting His bounties. He raises up the\nsick from beds of languishing, He delivers men from peril which\nthey do not see, He commissions heavenly angels to save them\nfrom calamity, to guard them from \u201cthe pestilence that walketh in\ndarkness\u201d and \u201cthe destruction that wasteth at noonday\u201d (Psalm\n91:6); but their hearts are unimpressed. He has given all the riches\nof heaven to redeem them, and yet they are unmindful of His great\nlove. By their ingratitude they close their hearts against the grace of\nGod. Like the heath in the desert they know not when good cometh,\nand their souls inhabit the parched places of the wilderness.\nIt is for our own benefit to keep every gift of God fresh in our\nmemory. Thus faith is strengthened to claim and to receive more and\nmore. There is greater encouragement for us in the least blessing\nwe ourselves receive from God than in all the accounts we can read\nof the faith and experience of others. The soul that responds to the\ngrace of God shall be like a watered garden. His health shall spring\nforth speedily; his light shall rise in obscurity, and the glory of the\n298 The Desire of Ages\nLord shall be seen upon him. Let us then remember the loving-\nkindness of the Lord, and the multitude of His tender mercies. Like\nthe people of Israel, let us set up our stones of witness, and inscribe\nupon them the precious story of what God has wrought for us. And\nas we review His dealings with us in our pilgrimage, let us, out of\nhearts melted with gratitude, declare, \u201cWhat shall I render unto the\nLord for all His benefits toward me? I will take the cup of salvation,\nand call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the\nLord now in the presence of all His people.\u201d Psalm 116:12-14.\nChapter 37\u2014The First Evangelists [349]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 10; Mark 6:7-11; Luke 9:1-6.\nThe apostles were members of the family of Jesus, and they had\naccompanied Him as He traveled on foot through Galilee. They had\nshared with Him the toils and hardships that overtook them. They\nhad listened to His discourses, they had walked and talked with the\nSon of God, and from His daily instruction they had learned how to\nwork for the elevation of humanity. As Jesus ministered to the vast\nmultitudes that gathered about Him, His disciples were in attendance,\neager to do His bidding and to lighten His labor. They assisted in\narranging the people, bringing the afflicted ones to the Saviour, and\npromoting the comfort of all. They watched for interested hearers,\nexplained the Scriptures to them, and in various ways worked for\ntheir spiritual benefit. They taught what they had learned of Jesus,\nand were every day obtaining a rich experience. But they needed\nalso an experience in laboring alone. They were still in need of\nmuch instruction, great patience and tenderness. Now, while He\nwas personally with them, to point out their errors, and counsel and\ncorrect them, the Saviour sent them forth as His representatives.\nWhile they had been with Him, the disciples had often been\nperplexed by the teaching of the priests and Pharisees, but they had\nbrought their perplexities to Jesus. He had set before them the truths\nof Scripture in contrast with tradition. Thus He had strengthened\ntheir confidence in God\u2019s word, and in a great measure had set them\nfree from their fear of the rabbis and their bondage to tradition. In\nthe training of the disciples the example of the Saviour\u2019s life was [350]\nfar more effective than any mere doctrinal instruction. When they\nwere separated from Him, every look and tone and word came back\nto them. Often when in conflict with the enemies of the gospel, they\nrepeated His words, and as they saw their effect upon the people,\nthey rejoiced greatly.\n299\n300 The Desire of Ages\nCalling the twelve about Him, Jesus bade them go out two and\ntwo through the towns and villages. None were sent forth alone,\nbut brother was associated with brother, friend with friend. Thus\nthey could help and encourage each other, counseling and praying\ntogether, each one\u2019s strength supplementing the other\u2019s weakness.\nIn the same manner He afterward sent forth the seventy. It was\nthe Saviour\u2019s purpose that the messengers of the gospel should be\nassociated in this way. In our own time evangelistic work would be\nfar more successful if this example were more closely followed.\nThe disciples\u2019 message was the same as that of John the Baptist\nand of Christ Himself: \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u201d They\nwere to enter into no controversy with the people as to whether Jesus\nof Nazareth was the Messiah; but in His name they were to do the\nsame works of mercy as He had done. He bade them, \u201cHeal the sick,\ncleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have\nreceived, freely give.\u201d\nDuring His ministry Jesus devoted more time to healing the sick\nthan to preaching. His miracles testified to the truth of His words,\nthat He came not to destroy but to save. His righteousness went\nbefore Him, and the glory of the Lord was His rearward. Wherever\nHe went, the tidings of His mercy preceded Him. Where He had\npassed, the objects of His compassion were rejoicing in health, and\nmaking trial of their new-found powers. Crowds were collecting\naround them to hear from their lips the works that the Lord had\nwrought. His voice was the first sound that many had ever heard,\nHis name the first word they had ever spoken, His face the first they\nhad ever looked upon. Why should they not love Jesus, and sound\nHis praise? As He passed through the towns and cities He was like\na vital current, diffusing life and joy wherever He went.\nThe followers of Christ are to labor as He did. We are to feed the\nhungry, clothe the naked, and comfort the suffering and afflicted. We\nare to minister to the despairing, and inspire hope in the hopeless.\nAnd to us also the promise will be fulfilled, \u201cThy righteousness\nshall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward.\u201d\nIsaiah 58:8. The love of Christ, manifested in unselfish ministry,\nwill be more effective in reforming the evildoer than will the sword\nor the court of justice. These are necessary to strike terror to the[351]\nlawbreaker, but the loving missionary can do more than this. Often\nFirst Evangelists 301\nthe heart will harden under reproof; but it will melt under the love of\nChrist. The missionary cannot only relieve physical maladies, but he\ncan lead the sinner to the Great Physician, who can cleanse the soul\nfrom the leprosy of sin. Through His servants, God designs that the\nsick, the unfortunate, those possessed of evil spirits, shall hear His\nvoice. Through His human agencies He desires to be a Comforter\nsuch as the world knows not.\nThe disciples on their first missionary tour were to go only to\n\u201cthe lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u201d If they had now preached the\ngospel to the Gentiles or the Samaritans, they would have lost their\ninfluence with the Jews. By exciting the prejudice of the Pharisees\nthey would have involved themselves in controversy which would\nhave discouraged them at the outset of their labors. Even the apostles\nwere slow to understand that the gospel was to be carried to all\nnations. Until they themselves could grasp this truth they were not\nprepared to labor for the Gentiles. If the Jews would receive the\ngospel, God purposed to make them His messengers to the Gentiles.\nTherefore they were first to hear the message.\nAll over the field of Christ\u2019s labor there were souls awakened to\ntheir need, and hungering and thirsting for the truth. The time had\ncome to send the tidings of His love to these longing hearts. To all\nthese the disciples were to go as His representatives. The believers\nwould thus be led to look upon them as divinely appointed teachers,\nand when the Saviour should be taken from them they would not be\nleft without instructors.\nOn this first tour the disciples were to go only where Jesus had\nbeen before them, and had made friends. Their preparation for the\njourney was to be of the simplest kind. Nothing must be allowed\nto divert their minds from their great work, or in any way excite\nopposition and close the door for further labor. They were not to\nadopt the dress of the religious teachers, nor use any guise in apparel\nto distinguish them from the humble peasants. They were not to\nenter into the synagogues and call the people together for public\nservice; their efforts were to be put forth in house-to-house labor.\nThey were not to waste time in needless salutations, or in going from\nhouse to house for entertainment. But in every place they were to\naccept the hospitality of those who were worthy, those who would\nwelcome them heartily as if entertaining Christ Himself. They were\n302 The Desire of Ages\nto enter the dwelling with the beautiful salutation, \u201cPeace be to this\nhouse.\u201d Luke 10:5. That home would be blessed by their prayers,\ntheir songs of praise, and the opening of the Scriptures in the family[352]\ncircle.\nThese disciples were to be heralds of the truth, to prepare the\nway for the coming of their Master. The message they had to bear\nwas the word of eternal life, and the destiny of men depended upon\ntheir reception or rejection of it. To impress the people with its\nsolemnity, Jesus bade His disciples, \u201cWhosoever shall not receive\nyou, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city,\nshake off the dust of your feet. Verily I say unto you, It shall be\nmore tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of\njudgment, than for that city.\u201d\nNow the Saviour\u2019s eye penetrates the future; He beholds the\nbroader fields in which, after His death, the disciples are to be\nwitnesses for Him. His prophetic glance takes in the experience of\nHis servants through all the ages till He shall come the second time.\nHe shows His followers the conflicts they must meet; He reveals the\ncharacter and plan of the battle. He lays open before them the perils\nthey must encounter, the self-denial that will be required. He desires\nthem to count the cost, that they may not be taken unawares by the\nenemy. Their warfare is not to be waged against flesh and blood,\nbut \u201cagainst the principalities, against the powers, against the world\nrulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in\nthe heavenly places.\u201d Ephesians 6:12, R. V . They are to contend with\nsupernatural forces, but they are assured of supernatural help. All\nthe intelligences of heaven are in this army. And more than angels\nare in the ranks. The Holy Spirit, the representative of the Captain\nof the Lord\u2019s host, comes down to direct the battle. Our infirmities\nmay be many, our sins and mistakes grievous; but the grace of God\nis for all who seek it with contrition. The power of Omnipotence is\nenlisted in behalf of those who trust in God.\n\u201cBehold,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cI send you forth as sheep in the midst of[353]\nwolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.\u201d\nChrist Himself did not suppress one word of truth, but He spoke it\nalways in love. He exercised the greatest tact, and thoughtful, kind\nattention in His intercourse with the people. He was never rude,\nnever needlessly spoke a severe word, never gave needless pain to a\nFirst Evangelists 303\nsensitive soul. He did not censure human weakness. He fearlessly\ndenounced hypocrisy, unbelief, and iniquity, but tears were in His\nvoice as He uttered His scathing rebukes. He wept over Jerusalem,\nthe city He loved, that refused to receive Him, the Way, the Truth,\nand the Life. They rejected Him, the Saviour, but He regarded them\nwith pitying tenderness, and sorrow so deep that it broke His heart.\nEvery soul was precious in His eyes. While He always bore Himself\nwith divine dignity, He bowed with tenderest regard to every member\nof the family of God. In all men He saw fallen souls whom it was\nHis mission to save.\nThe servants of Christ are not to act out the dictates of the natural\nheart. They need to have close communion with God, lest, under\nprovocation, self rise up, and they pour forth a torrent of words that\nare unbefitting, that are not as dew or the still showers that refresh\nthe withering plants. This is what Satan wants them to do; for these\nare his methods. It is the dragon that is wroth; it is the spirit of Satan\nthat is revealed in anger and accusing. But God\u2019s servants are to be\nrepresentatives of Him. He desires them to deal only in the currency\nof heaven, the truth that bears His own image and superscription.\nThe power by which they are to overcome evil is the power of Christ.\nThe glory of Christ is their strength. They are to fix their eyes upon\nHis loveliness. Then they can present the gospel with divine tact and\ngentleness. And the spirit that is kept gentle under provocation will\nspeak more effectively in favor of the truth than will any argument,\nhowever forcible.\nThose who are brought in controversy with the enemies of truth\nhave to meet, not only men, but Satan and his agents. Let them\nremember the Saviour\u2019s words, \u201cBehold, I send you forth as lambs\namong wolves.\u201d Luke 10:3. Let them rest in the love of God, and the\nspirit will be kept calm, even under personal abuse. The Lord will\nclothe them with a divine panoply. His Holy Spirit will influence\nthe mind and heart, so that their voices shall not catch the notes of\nthe baying of the wolves.\nContinuing His instruction to His disciples, Jesus said, \u201cBeware [354]\nof men.\u201d They were not to put implicit confidence in those who\nknew not God, and open to them their counsels; for this would give\nSatan\u2019s agents an advantage. Man\u2019s inventions often counterwork\nGod\u2019s plans. Those who build the temple of the Lord are to build\n304 The Desire of Ages\naccording to the pattern shown in the mount,\u2014the divine similitude.\nGod is dishonored and the gospel is betrayed when His servants\ndepend on the counsel of men who are not under the guidance of the\nHoly Spirit. Worldly wisdom is foolishness with God. Those who\nrely upon it will surely err.\n\u201cThey will deliver you up to councils, ... yea and before gover-\nnors and kings shall ye be brought for My sake, for a testimony to\nthem and to the Gentiles.\u201d Matthew 10:17, 18, R. V . Persecution\nwill spread the light. The servants of Christ will be brought before\nthe great men of the world, who, but for this, might never hear the\ngospel. The truth has been misrepresented to these men. They have\nlistened to false charges concerning the faith of Christ\u2019s disciples.\nOften their only means of learning its real character is the testimony\nof those who are brought to trial for their faith. Under examination\nthese are required to answer, and their judges to listen to the testi-\nmony borne. God\u2019s grace will be dispensed to His servants to meet\nthe emergency. \u201cIt shall be given you,\u201d says Jesus, \u201cin that same\nhour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of\nyour Father which speaketh in you.\u201d As the Spirit of God illuminates\nthe minds of His servants, the truth will be presented in its divine\npower and preciousness. Those who reject the truth will stand to\naccuse and oppress the disciples. But under loss and suffering, even\nunto death, the Lord\u2019s children are to reveal the meekness of their\ndivine Example. Thus will be seen the contrast between Satan\u2019s\nagents and the representatives of Christ. The Saviour will be lifted\nup before the rulers and the people.\nThe disciples were not endowed with the courage and fortitude\nof the martyrs until such grace was needed. Then the Saviour\u2019s\npromise was fulfilled. When Peter and John testified before the\nSanhedrin council, men \u201cmarveled; and they took knowledge of\nthem, that they had been with Jesus.\u201d Acts 4:13. Of Stephen it is\nwritten that \u201call that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him,\nsaw his face as it had been the face of an angel.\u201d Men \u201cwere not able\nto resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.\u201d Acts 6:15,\n10. And Paul, writing of his own trial at the court of the Caesars,\nsays, \u201cAt my first defense no one took my part, but all forsook me....[355]\nBut the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the\nmessage might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might\nFirst Evangelists 305\nhear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.\u201d 2 Timothy",

      "text": "The servants of Christ were to prepare no set speech to present\nwhen brought to trial. Their preparation was to be made day by\nday in treasuring up the precious truths of God\u2019s word, and through\nprayer strengthening their faith. When they were brought into trial,\nthe Holy Spirit would bring to their remembrance the very truths\nthat would be needed.\nA daily, earnest striving to know God, and Jesus Christ whom\nHe has sent, would bring power and efficiency to the soul. The\nknowledge obtained by diligent searching of the Scriptures would be\nflashed into the memory at the right time. But if any had neglected\nto acquaint themselves with the words of Christ, if they had never\ntested the power of His grace in trial, they could not expect that the\nHoly Spirit would bring His words to their remembrance. They were\nto serve God daily with undivided affection, and then trust Him.\nSo bitter would be the enmity to the gospel that even the tenderest\nearthly ties would be disregarded. The disciples of Christ would be\nbetrayed to death by the members of their own households. \u201cYe shall\nbe hated of all men for My name\u2019s sake,\u201d He added; \u201cbut he that\nshall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\u201d Mark 13:13. But\nHe bade them not to expose themselves unnecessarily to persecution.\nHe Himself often left one field of labor for another, in order to escape\nfrom those who were seeking His life. When He was rejected at\nNazareth, and His own townsmen tried to kill Him, He went down\nto Capernaum, and there the people were astonished at His teaching;\n\u201cfor His word was with power.\u201d Luke 4:32. So His servants were\nnot to be discouraged by persecution, but to seek a place where they\ncould still labor for the salvation of souls.\nThe servant is not above his master. The Prince of heaven was\ncalled Beelzebub, and His disciples will be misrepresented in like\nmanner. But whatever the danger, Christ\u2019s followers must avow their\nprinciples. They should scorn concealment. They cannot remain\nuncommitted until assured of safety in confessing the truth. They\nare set as watchmen, to warn men of their peril. The truth received\nfrom Christ must be imparted to all, freely and openly. Jesus said,\n\u201cWhat I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear\nin the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.\u201d\n306 The Desire of Ages\nJesus Himself never purchased peace by compromise. His heart[356]\noverflowed with love for the whole human race, but He was never\nindulgent to their sins. He was too much their friend to remain silent\nwhile they were pursuing a course that would ruin their souls,\u2014the\nsouls He had purchased with His own blood. He labored that man\nshould be true to himself, true to his higher and eternal interest.\nThe servants of Christ are called to the same work, and they should\nbeware lest, in seeking to prevent discord, they surrender the truth.\nThey are to \u201cfollow after the things which make for peace\u201d (Romans\n14:19); but real peace can never be secured by compromising princi-\nple. And no man can be true to principle without exciting opposition.\nA Christianity that is spiritual will be opposed by the children of\ndisobedience. But Jesus bade His disciples, \u201cFear not them which\nkill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.\u201d Those who are true\nto God need not fear the power of men nor the enmity of Satan. In\nChrist their eternal life is secure. Their only fear should be lest they\nsurrender the truth, and thus betray the trust with which God has\nhonored them.\nIt is Satan\u2019s work to fill men\u2019s hearts with doubt. He leads them\nto look upon God as a stern judge. He tempts them to sin, and then\nto regard themselves as too vile to approach their heavenly Father or\nto excite His pity. The Lord understands all this. Jesus assures His\ndisciples of God\u2019s sympathy for them in their needs and weaknesses.\nNot a sigh is breathed, not a pain felt, not a grief pierces the soul,\nbut the throb vibrates to the Father\u2019s heart.\nThe Bible shows us God in His high and holy place, not in a\nstate of inactivity, not in silence and solitude, but surrounded by ten\nthousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands of holy\nintelligences, all waiting to do His will. Through channels which\nwe cannot discern He is in active communication with every part of\nHis dominion. But it is in this speck of a world, in the souls that He\ngave His only-begotten Son to save, that His interest and the interest\nof all heaven is centered. God is bending from His throne to hear the\ncry of the oppressed. To every sincere prayer He answers, \u201cHere am\nI.\u201d He uplifts the distressed and downtrodden. In all our afflictions\nHe is afflicted. In every temptation and every trial the angel of His\npresence is near to deliver.\nFirst Evangelists 307\nNot even a sparrow falls to the ground without the Father\u2019s\nnotice. Satan\u2019s hatred against God leads him to hate every object of\nthe Saviour\u2019s care. He seeks to mar the handiwork of God, and he\ndelights in destroying even the dumb creatures. It is only through [357]\nGod\u2019s protecting care that the birds are preserved to gladden us with\ntheir songs of joy. But He does not forget even the sparrows. \u201cFear\nye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.\u201d\nJesus continues: As you confess Me before men, so I will confess\nyou before God and the holy angels. You are to be My witnesses\nupon earth, channels through which My grace can flow for the\nhealing of the world. So I will be your representative in heaven.\nThe Father beholds not your faulty character, but He sees you as\nclothed in My perfection. I am the medium through which Heaven\u2019s\nblessings shall come to you. And everyone who confesses Me by\nsharing My sacrifice for the lost shall be confessed as a sharer in the\nglory and joy of the redeemed.\nHe who would confess Christ must have Christ abiding in him.\nHe cannot communicate that which he has not received. The disci-\nples might speak fluently on doctrines, they might repeat the words\nof Christ Himself; but unless they possessed Christlike meekness\nand love, they were not confessing Him. A spirit contrary to the\nspirit of Christ would deny Him, whatever the profession. Men\nmay deny Christ by evilspeaking, by foolish talking, by words that\nare untruthful or unkind. They may deny Him by shunning life\u2019s\nburdens, by the pursuit of sinful pleasure. They may deny Him by\nconforming to the world, by uncourteous behavior, by the love of\ntheir own opinions, by justifying self, by cherishing doubt, borrow-\ning trouble, and dwelling in darkness. In all these ways they declare\nthat Christ is not in them. And \u201cwhosoever shall deny Me before\nmen,\u201d He says, \u201chim will I also deny before My Father which is in\nheaven.\u201d\nThe Saviour bade His disciples not to hope that the world\u2019s\nenmity to the gospel would be overcome, and that after a time its\nopposition would cease. He said, \u201cI came not to send peace, but a\nsword.\u201d This creating of strife is not the effect of the gospel, but the\nresult of opposition to it. Of all persecution the hardest to bear is\nvariance in the home, the estrangement of dearest earthly friends.\nBut Jesus declares, \u201cHe that loveth father or mother more than Me is\n308 The Desire of Ages\nnot worthy of Me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than Me\nis not worthy of Me. And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth\nafter Me, is not worthy of Me.\u201d\nThe mission of Christ\u2019s servants is a high honor, and a sacred\ntrust. \u201cHe that receiveth you,\u201d He says, \u201creceiveth Me, and he that\nreceiveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me.\u201d No act of kindness shown[358]\nto them in His name will fail to be recognized and rewarded. And\nin the same tender recognition He includes the feeblest and lowliest\nof the family of God: \u201cWhosoever shall give to drink unto one of\nthese little ones\u201d\u2014those who are as children in their faith and their\nknowledge of Christ\u2014\u201ca cup of cold water only in the name of a\ndisciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in nowise lose his reward.\u201d\nThus the Saviour ended His instruction. In the name of Christ\nthe chosen twelve went out, as He had gone, \u201cto preach the gospel to\nthe poor, ... to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the\ncaptives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them\nthat are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\u201d Luke\n4:18, 19.\nChapter 38\u2014Come Rest Awhile [359]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 14:1, 2, 12, 13; Mark 6:30-32;\nLuke 9:7-10.\nOn returning from their missionary tour, \u201cthe apostles gathered\nthemselves together unto Jesus, and told Him all things, both what\nthey had done, and what they had taught. And He said unto them,\nCome ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest awhile: for\nthere were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much\nas to eat.\u201d\nThe disciples came to Jesus and told Him all things. Their inti-\nmate relationship with Him encouraged them to lay before Him their\nfavorable and unfavorable experiences, their joy at seeing results\nfrom their labors, and their sorrow at their failures, their faults, and\ntheir weaknesses. They had committed errors in their first work as\nevangelists, and as they frankly told Christ of their experiences, He\nsaw that they needed much instruction. He saw, too, that they had\nbecome weary in their labors, and that they needed to rest.\nBut where they then were they could not obtain the needed\nprivacy; \u201cfor there were many coming and going, and they had no\nleisure so much as to eat.\u201d The people were thronging after Christ,\nanxious to be healed, and eager to listen to His words. Many felt\ndrawn to Him; for He seemed to them to be the fountain of all\nblessings. Many of those who then thronged about Christ to receive\nthe precious boon of health accepted Him as their Saviour. Many\nothers, afraid then to confess Him, because of the Pharisees, were\nconverted at the descent of the Holy Spirit, and, before the angry [360]\npriests and rulers, acknowledged Him as the Son of God.\nBut now Christ longed for retirement, that He might be with His\ndisciples; for He had much to say to them. In their work they had\npassed through the test of conflict, and had encountered opposition in\nvarious forms. Hitherto they had consulted Christ in everything; but\nfor some time they had been alone, and at times they had been much\n309\n310 The Desire of Ages\ntroubled to know what to do. They had found much encouragement\nin their work; for Christ did not send them away without His Spirit,\nand by faith in Him they worked many miracles; but they needed\nnow to feed on the Bread of Life. They needed to go to a place\nof retirement, where they could hold communion with Jesus and\nreceive instruction for future work.\n\u201cAnd He said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert\nplace, and rest awhile.\u201d Christ is full of tenderness and compassion\nfor all in His service. He would show His disciples that God does\nnot require sacrifice, but mercy. They had been putting their whole\nsouls into labor for the people, and this was exhausting their physical\nand mental strength. It was their duty to rest.\nAs the disciples had seen the success of their labors, they were\nin danger of taking credit to themselves, in danger of cherishing\nspiritual pride, and thus falling under Satan\u2019s temptations. A great\nwork was before them, and first of all they must learn that their\nstrength was not in self, but in God. Like Moses in the wilderness\nof Sinai, like David among the hills of Judea, or Elijah by the brook\nCherith, the disciples needed to come apart from the scenes of their\nbusy activity, to commune with Christ, with nature, and with their\nown hearts.\nWhile the disciples had been absent on their missionary tour,\nJesus had visited other towns and villages, preaching the gospel of\nthe kingdom. It was about this time that He received tidings of the\nBaptist\u2019s death. This event brought vividly before Him the end to\nwhich His own steps were tending. The shadows were gathering\nthickly about His path. Priests and rabbis were watching to compass\nHis death, spies hung upon His steps, and on every hand plots for\nHis ruin were multiplying. News of the preaching of the apostles\nthroughout Galilee reached Herod, calling his attention to Jesus and\nHis work. \u201cThis is John the Baptist,\u201d he said; \u201che is risen from\nthe dead;\u201d and he expressed a desire to see Jesus. Herod was in\nconstant fear lest a revolution might be secretly carried forward,\nwith the object of unseating him from the throne, and breaking the\nRoman yoke from the Jewish nation. Among the people the spirit\nof discontent and insurrection was rife. It was evident that Christ\u2019s[361]\npublic labors in Galilee could not be long continued. The scenes of\nCome Rest Awhile 311\nHis suffering were drawing near, and He longed to be apart for a\nseason from the confusion of the multitude.\nWith saddened hearts the disciples of John had borne his mu-\ntilated body to its burial. Then they \u201cwent and told Jesus.\u201d These\ndisciples had been envious of Christ when He seemed to be drawing\nthe people away from John. They had sided with the Pharisees in\naccusing Him when He sat with the publicans at Matthew\u2019s feast.\nThey had doubted His divine mission because He did not set the\nBaptist at liberty. But now that their teacher was dead, and they\nlonged for consolation in their great sorrow, and for guidance as to\ntheir future work, they came to Jesus, and united their interest with\nHis. They too needed a season of quiet for communion with the\nSaviour.\nNear Bethsaida, at the northern end of the lake, was a lonely\nregion, now beautiful with the fresh green of spring, that offered\na welcome retreat to Jesus and His disciples. For this place they\nset out, going in their boat across the water. Here they would be\naway from the thoroughfares of travel, and the bustle and agitation\nof the city. The scenes of nature were in themselves a rest, a change\ngrateful to the senses. Here they could listen to the words of Christ\nwithout hearing the angry interruptions, the retorts and accusations\nof the scribes and Pharisees. Here they could enjoy a short season\nof precious fellowship in the society of their Lord.\nThe rest which Christ and His disciples took was not self-in-\ndulgent rest. The time they spent in retirement was not devoted to\npleasure seeking. They talked together regarding the work of God,\nand the possibility of bringing greater efficiency to the work. The\ndisciples had been with Christ, and could understand Him; to them\nHe need not talk in parables. He corrected their errors, and made\nplain to them the right way of approaching the people. He opened\nmore fully to them the precious treasures of divine truth. They were\nvitalized by divine power, and inspired with hope and courage.\nThough Jesus could work miracles, and had empowered His\ndisciples to work miracles, He directed His worn servants to go apart\ninto the country and rest. When He said that the harvest was great,\nand the laborers were few, He did not urge upon His disciples the\nnecessity of ceaseless toil, but said, \u201cPray ye therefore the Lord of the\nharvest, that He will send forth laborers into His harvest.\u201d Matthew\n312 The Desire of Ages\n9:38. God has appointed to every man his work, according to his[362]\nability (Ephesians 4:11-13), and He would not have a few weighted\nwith responsibilities while others have no burden, no travail of soul.\nChrist\u2019s words of compassion are spoken to His workers today\njust as surely as they were spoken to His disciples. \u201cCome ye\nyourselves apart, ... and rest awhile,\u201d He says to those who are worn\nand weary. It is not wise to be always under the strain of work and\nexcitement, even in ministering to men\u2019s spiritual needs; for in this\nway personal piety is neglected, and the powers of mind and soul\nand body are overtaxed. Self-denial is required of the disciples of\nChrist, and sacrifices must be made; but care must also be exercised\nlest through their overzeal Satan take advantage of the weakness of\nhumanity, and the work of God be marred.\nIn the estimation of the rabbis it was the sum of religion to be\nalways in a bustle of activity. They depended upon some outward\nperformance to show their superior piety. Thus they separated their\nsouls from God, and built themselves up in self-sufficiency. The\nsame dangers still exist. As activity increases and men become\nsuccessful in doing any work for God, there is danger of trusting\nto human plans and methods. There is a tendency to pray less, and\nto have less faith. Like the disciples, we are in danger of losing\nsight of our dependence on God, and seeking to make a savior of\nour activity. We need to look constantly to Jesus, realizing that it\nis His power which does the work. While we are to labor earnestly\nfor the salvation of the lost, we must also take time for meditation,\nfor prayer, and for the study of the word of God. Only the work\naccomplished with much prayer, and sanctified by the merit of Christ,\nwill in the end prove to have been efficient for good.\nNo other life was ever so crowded with labor and responsibility\nas was that of Jesus; yet how often He was found in prayer! How\nconstant was His communion with God! Again and again in the\nhistory of His earthly life are found records such as these: \u201cRising\nup a great while before day, He went out, and departed into a solitary\nplace, and there prayed.\u201d \u201cGreat multitudes came together to hear,\nand to be healed by Him of their infirmities. And He withdrew\nHimself into the wilderness, and prayed.\u201d \u201cAnd it came to pass in\nthose days, that He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued\nall night in prayer to God.\u201d Mark 1:35; Luke 5:15, 16; 6:12.\nCome Rest Awhile 313\nIn a life wholly devoted to the good of others, the Saviour found\nit necessary to withdraw from the thoroughfares of travel and from [363]\nthe throng that followed Him day after day. He must turn aside from\na life of ceaseless activity and contact with human needs, to seek\nretirement and unbroken communion with His Father. As one with\nus, a sharer in our needs and weaknesses, He was wholly dependent\nupon God, and in the secret place of prayer He sought divine strength,\nthat He might go forth braced for duty and trial. In a world of sin\nJesus endured struggles and torture of soul. In communion with God\nHe could unburden the sorrows that were crushing Him. Here He\nfound comfort and joy.\nIn Christ the cry of humanity reached the Father of infinite pity.\nAs a man He supplicated the throne of God till His humanity was\ncharged with a heavenly current that should connect humanity with\ndivinity. Through continual communion He received life from God,\nthat He might impart life to the world. His experience is to be ours.\n\u201cCome ye yourselves apart,\u201d He bids us. If we would give\nheed to His word, we should be stronger and more useful. The\ndisciples sought Jesus, and told Him all things; and He encouraged\nand instructed them. If today we would take time to go to Jesus and\ntell Him our needs, we should not be disappointed; He would be at\nour right hand to help us. We need more simplicity, more trust and\nconfidence in our Saviour. He whose name is called \u201cThe mighty\nGod, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace;\u201d He of whom\nit is written, \u201cThe government shall be upon His shoulder,\u201d is the\nWonderful Counselor. We are invited to ask wisdom of Him. He\n\u201cgiveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.\u201d Isaiah 9:6; James\n1:5.\nIn all who are under the training of God is to be revealed a life\nthat is not in harmony with the world, its customs, or its practices;\nand everyone needs to have a personal experience in obtaining a\nknowledge of the will of God. We must individually hear Him\nspeaking to the heart. When every other voice is hushed, and in\nquietness we wait before Him, the silence of the soul makes more\ndistinct the voice of God. He bids us, \u201cBe still, and know that I\nam God.\u201d Psalm 46:10. Here alone can true rest be found. And\nthis is the effectual preparation for all who labor for God. Amid\nthe hurrying throng, and the strain of life\u2019s intense activities, the\n314 The Desire of Ages\nsoul that is thus refreshed will be surrounded with an atmosphere of\nlight and peace. The life will breathe out fragrance, and will reveal\na divine power that will reach men\u2019s hearts.\nChapter 39\u2014\u201cGive Ye Them to Eat\u201d [364]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 14:13-21; Mark 6:32-44; Luke\n9:10-17; John 6:1-13.\nChrist had retired to a secluded place with His disciples, but this\nrare season of peaceful quietude was soon broken. The disciples\nthought they had retired where they would not be disturbed; but\nas soon as the multitude missed the divine Teacher, they inquired,\n\u201cWhere is He?\u201d Some among them had noticed the direction in\nwhich Christ and His disciples had gone. Many went by land to\nmeet them, while others followed in their boats across the water.\nThe Passover was at hand, and, from far and near, bands of pilgrims\non their way to Jerusalem gathered to see Jesus. Additions were\nmade to their number, until there were assembled five thousand men\nbesides women and children. Before Christ reached the shore, a\nmultitude were waiting for Him. But He landed unobserved by them,\nand spent a little time apart with the disciples.\nFrom the hillside He looked upon the moving multitude, and\nHis heart was stirred with sympathy. Interrupted as He was, and\nrobbed of His rest, He was not impatient. He saw a greater necessity\ndemanding His attention as He watched the people coming and still\ncoming. He \u201cwas moved with compassion toward them, because\nthey were as sheep not having a shepherd.\u201d Leaving His retreat, He\nfound a convenient place where He could minister to them. They\nreceived no help from the priests and rulers; but the healing waters [365]\nof life flowed from Christ as He taught the multitude the way of\nsalvation.\nThe people listened to the words of mercy flowing so freely from\nthe lips of the Son of God. They heard the gracious words, so simple\nand so plain that they were as the balm of Gilead to their souls. The\nhealing of His divine hand brought gladness and life to the dying,\nand ease and health to those suffering with disease. The day seemed\n315\n316 The Desire of Ages\nto them like heaven upon earth, and they were utterly unconscious\nof how long it had been since they had eaten anything.\nAt length the day was far spent. The sun was sinking in the west,\nand yet the people lingered. Jesus had labored all day without food\nor rest. He was pale from weariness and hunger, and the disciples\nbesought Him to cease from His toil. But He could not withdraw\nHimself from the multitude that pressed upon Him.\nThe disciples finally came to Him, urging that for their own sake\nthe people should be sent away. Many had come from far, and had\neaten nothing since morning. In the surrounding towns and villages\nthey might be able to buy food. But Jesus said, \u201cGive ye them to eat,\u201d\nand then, turning to Philip, questioned, \u201cWhence shall we buy bread,\nthat these may eat?\u201d This He said to test the faith of the disciple.\nPhilip looked over the sea of heads, and thought how impossible it\nwould be to provide food to satisfy the wants of such a crowd. He\nanswered that two hundred pennyworth of bread would not be nearly\nenough to divide among them, so that each might have a little. Jesus\ninquired how much food could be found among the company. \u201cThere\nis a lad here,\u201d said Andrew, \u201cwhich hath five barley loaves, and two\nsmall fishes; but what are they among so many?\u201d Jesus directed that\nthese be brought to Him. Then He bade the disciples seat the people\non the grass in parties of fifty or a hundred, to preserve order, and\nthat all might witness what He was about to do. When this was\naccomplished, Jesus took the food, \u201cand looking up to heaven, He\nblessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to His disciples, and the\ndisciples to the multitude.\u201d \u201cAnd they did all eat, and were filled.\nAnd they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the\nfishes.\u201d\nHe who taught the people the way to secure peace and happiness\nwas just as thoughtful of their temporal necessities as of their spiritual\nneed. The people were weary and faint. There were mothers with\nbabes in their arms, and little children clinging to their skirts. Many\nhad been standing for hours. They had been so intensely interested\nin Christ\u2019s words that they had not once thought of sitting down, and[366]\nthe crowd was so great that there was danger of their trampling on\none another. Jesus would give them a chance to rest, and He bade\nthem sit down. There was much grass in the place, and all could rest\nin comfort.\n\u201cGive Ye Them to Eat\u201d 317\nChrist never worked a miracle except to supply a genuine ne-\ncessity, and every miracle was of a character to lead the people to\nthe tree of life, whose leaves are for the healing of the nations. The\nsimple food passed round by the hands of the disciples contained [367]\na whole treasure of lessons. It was humble fare that had been pro-\nvided; the fishes and barley loaves were the daily food of the fisher\nfolk about the Sea of Galilee. Christ could have spread before the\npeople a rich repast, but food prepared merely for the gratification\nof appetite would have conveyed no lesson for their good. Christ\ntaught them in this lesson that the natural provisions of God for\nman had been perverted. And never did people enjoy the luxurious\nfeasts prepared for the gratification of perverted taste as this people\nenjoyed the rest and the simple food which Christ provided so far\nfrom human habitations.\nIf men today were simple in their habits, living in harmony with\nnature\u2019s laws, as did Adam and Eve in the beginning, there would\nbe an abundant supply for the needs of the human family. There\nwould be fewer imaginary wants, and more opportunities to work in\nGod\u2019s ways. But selfishness and the indulgence of unnatural taste\nhave brought sin and misery into the world, from excess on the one\nhand, and from want on the other.\nJesus did not seek to attract the people to Him by gratifying the\ndesire for luxury. To that great throng, weary and hungry after the\nlong, exciting day, the simple fare was an assurance not only of\nHis power, but of His tender care for them in the common needs\nof life. The Saviour has not promised His followers the luxuries of\nthe world; their fare may be plain, and even scanty; their lot may be\nshut in by poverty; but His word is pledged that their need shall be\nsupplied, and He has promised that which is far better than worldly\ngood,\u2014the abiding comfort of His own presence.\nIn feeding the five thousand, Jesus lifts the veil from the world\nof nature, and reveals the power that is constantly exercised for our\ngood. In the production of earth\u2019s harvests God is working a miracle\nevery day. Through natural agencies the same work is accomplished\nthat was wrought in the feeding of the multitude. Men prepare the\nsoil and sow the seed, but it is the life from God that causes the seed\nto germinate. It is God\u2019s rain and air and sunshine that cause it to\nput forth, \u201cfirst the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the\n318 The Desire of Ages\near.\u201d Mark 4:28. It is God who is every day feeding millions from\nearth\u2019s harvest fields. Men are called upon to co-operate with God in\nthe care of the grain and the preparation of the loaf, and because of\nthis they lose sight of the divine agency. They do not give God the\nglory due unto His holy name. The working of His power is ascribed[368]\nto natural causes or to human instrumentality. Man is glorified in\nplace of God, and His gracious gifts are perverted to selfish uses,\nand made a curse instead of a blessing. God is seeking to change all\nthis. He desires that our dull senses shall be quickened to discern\nHis merciful kindness and to glorify Him for the working of His\npower. He desires us to recognize Him in His gifts, that they may be,\nas He intended, a blessing to us. It was to accomplish this purpose\nthat the miracles of Christ were performed.\nAfter the multitude had been fed, there was an abundance of\nfood left. But He who had all the resources of infinite power at His\ncommand said, \u201cGather up the fragments that remain, that nothing\nbe lost.\u201d These words meant more than putting the bread into the\nbaskets. The lesson was twofold. Nothing is to be wasted. We are\nto let slip no temporal advantage. We should neglect nothing that\nwill tend to benefit a human being. Let everything be gathered up\nthat will relieve the necessity of earth\u2019s hungry ones. And there\nshould be the same carefulness in spiritual things. When the baskets\nof fragments were collected, the people thought of their friends\nat home. They wanted them to share in the bread that Christ had\nblessed. The contents of the baskets were distributed among the\neager throng, and were carried away into all the region round about.\nSo those who were at the feast were to give to others the bread that\ncomes down from heaven, to satisfy the hunger of the soul. They\nwere to repeat what they had learned of the wonderful things of God.\nNothing was to be lost. Not one word that concerned their eternal\nsalvation was to fall useless to the ground.\nThe miracle of the loaves teaches a lesson of dependence upon\nGod. When Christ fed the five thousand, the food was not nigh\nat hand. Apparently He had no means at His command. Here He\nwas, with five thousand men, besides women and children, in the\nwilderness. He had not invited the large multitude to follow Him;\nthey came without invitation or command; but He knew that after\nthey had listened so long to His instruction, they would feel hungry\n\u201cGive Ye Them to Eat\u201d 319\nand faint; for He was one with them in their need of food. They\nwere far from home, and the night was close at hand. Many of them\nwere without means to purchase food. He who for their sake had\nfasted forty days in the wilderness would not suffer them to return\nfasting to their homes. The providence of God had placed Jesus\nwhere He was; and He depended on His heavenly Father for the\nmeans to relieve the necessity.\nAnd when we are brought into strait places, we are to depend [369]\non God. We are to exercise wisdom and judgment in every action\nof life, that we may not, by reckless movements, place ourselves in\ntrial. We are not to plunge into difficulties, neglecting the means God\nhas provided, and misusing the faculties He has given us. Christ\u2019s\nworkers are to obey His instructions implicitly. The work is God\u2019s,\nand if we would bless others His plans must be followed. Self cannot\nbe made a center; self can receive no honor. If we plan according to\nour own ideas, the Lord will leave us to our own mistakes. But when,\nafter following His directions, we are brought into strait places, He\nwill deliver us. We are not to give up in discouragement, but in\nevery emergency we are to seek help from Him who has infinite\nresources at His command. Often we shall be surrounded with trying\ncircumstances, and then, in the fullest confidence, we must depend\nupon God. He will keep every soul that is brought into perplexity\nthrough trying to keep the way of the Lord.\nChrist has bidden us, through the prophet, \u201cDeal thy bread to the\nhungry,\u201d and \u201csatisfy the afflicted soul;\u201d \u201cwhen thou seest the naked,\nthat thou cover him,\u201d and \u201cbring the poor that are cast out to thy\nhouse.\u201d Isaiah 58:7-10. He has bidden us, \u201cGo ye into all the world,\nand preach the gospel to every creature.\u201d Mark 16:15. But how often\nour hearts sink, and faith fails us, as we see how great is the need,\nand how small the means in our hands. Like Andrew looking upon\nthe five barley loaves and the two little fishes, we exclaim, \u201cWhat\nare they among so many?\u201d Often we hesitate, unwilling to give all\nthat we have, fearing to spend and to be spent for others. But Jesus\nhas bidden us, \u201cGive ye them to eat.\u201d His command is a promise;\nand behind it is the same power that fed the multitude beside the sea.\nIn Christ\u2019s act of supplying the temporal necessities of a hungry\nmultitude is wrapped up a deep spiritual lesson for all His workers.\nChrist received from the Father; He imparted to the disciples; they\n320 The Desire of Ages\nimparted to the multitude; and the people to one another. So all\nwho are united to Christ will receive from Him the bread of life, the\nheavenly food, and impart it to others.\nIn full reliance upon God, Jesus took the small store of loaves;\nand although there was but a small portion for His own family of\ndisciples, He did not invite them to eat, but began to distribute\nto them, bidding them serve the people. The food multiplied in\nHis hands; and the hands of the disciples, reaching out to Christ\nHimself the Bread of Life, were never empty. The little store was[370]\nsufficient for all. After the wants of the people had been supplied,\nthe fragments were gathered up, and Christ and His disciples ate\ntogether of the precious, Heaven-supplied food.\nThe disciples were the channel of communication between Christ\nand the people. This should be a great encouragement to His disci-\nples today. Christ is the great center, the source of all strength. His\ndisciples are to receive their supplies from Him. The most intelli-\ngent, the most spiritually minded, can bestow only as they receive.\nOf themselves they can supply nothing for the needs of the soul.\nWe can impart only that which we receive from Christ; and we can\nreceive only as we impart to others. As we continue imparting, we\ncontinue to receive; and the more we impart, the more we shall\nreceive. Thus we may be constantly believing, trusting, receiving,\nand imparting.\nThe work of building up the kingdom of Christ will go forward,\nthough to all appearance it moves slowly and impossibilities seem\nto testify against advance. The work is of God, and He will furnish\nmeans, and will send helpers, true, earnest disciples, whose hands\nalso will be filled with food for the starving multitude. God is not\nunmindful of those who labor in love to give the word of life to\nperishing souls, who in their turn reach forth their hands for food for\nother hungry souls.\nIn our work for God there is danger of relying too largely upon\nwhat man with his talents and ability can do. Thus we lose sight\nof the one Master Worker. Too often the worker for Christ fails to\nrealize his personal responsibility. He is in danger of shifting his\nburden upon organizations, instead of relying upon Him who is the\nsource of all strength. It is a great mistake to trust in human wisdom\nor numbers in the work of God. Successful work for Christ depends\n\u201cGive Ye Them to Eat\u201d 321\nnot so much on numbers or talent as upon pureness of purpose, the\ntrue simplicity of earnest, dependent faith. Personal responsibilities\nmust be borne, personal duties must be taken up, personal efforts\nmust be made for those who do not know Christ. In the place of\nshifting your responsibility upon someone whom you think more\nrichly endowed than you are, work according to your ability.\nWhen the question comes home to your heart, \u201cWhence shall we\nbuy bread, that these may eat?\u201d let not your answer be the response of\nunbelief. When the disciples heard the Saviour\u2019s direction, \u201cGive ye\nthem to eat,\u201d all the difficulties arose in their minds. They questioned,\nShall we go away into the villages to buy food? So now, when the [371]\npeople are destitute of the bread of life, the Lord\u2019s children question,\nShall we send for someone from afar, to come and feed them? But\nwhat said Christ? \u201cMake the men sit down,\u201d and He fed them there.\nSo when you are surrounded by souls in need, know that Christ is\nthere. Commune with Him. Bring your barley loaves to Jesus.\nThe means in our possession may not seem to be sufficient for\nthe work; but if we will move forward in faith, believing in the\nall-sufficient power of God, abundant resources will open before us.\nIf the work be of God, He Himself will provide the means for its\naccomplishment. He will reward honest, simple reliance upon Him.\nThe little that is wisely and economically used in the service of the\nLord of heaven will increase in the very act of imparting. In the\nhand of Christ the small supply of food remained undiminished until\nthe famished multitude were satisfied. If we go to the Source of all\nstrength, with our hands of faith outstretched to receive, we shall be\nsustained in our work, even under the most forbidding circumstances,\nand shall be enabled to give to others the bread of life.\nThe Lord says, \u201cGive, and it shall be given unto you.\u201d \u201cHe that\nsoweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth with\nblessings shall reap also with blessings.... And God is able to make\nall grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in\neverything, may abound unto every good work; as it is written,\u2014\n\u201cHe hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor:\nHis righteousness abideth forever.\n322 The Desire of Ages\n\u201cAnd He that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall\nsupply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits\nof your righteousness: ye being enriched in everything unto all\nliberality, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.\u201d Luke\n6:38; 2 Corinthians 9:6-11, R. V ., margin.\nChapter 40\u2014A Night on the Lake [372]\n[373]\n[374]\n[375]\n[376]\n[377]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 14:22-33; Mark 6:45-52; John\n6:14-21.\nSeated upon the grassy plain, in the twilight of the spring evening,\nthe people ate of the food that Christ had provided. The words they\nhad heard that day had come to them as the voice of God. The works\nof healing they had witnessed were such as only divine power could\nperform. But the miracle of the loaves appealed to everyone in that\nvast multitude. All were sharers in its benefit. In the days of Moses,\nGod had fed Israel with manna in the desert; and who was this that\nhad fed them that day but He whom Moses had foretold? No human\npower could create from five barley loaves and two small fishes food\nsufficient to feed thousands of hungry people. And they said one to\nanother, \u201cThis is of a truth that Prophet that should come into the\nworld.\u201d\nAll day the conviction has strengthened. That crowning act is\nassurance that the long-looked-for Deliverer is among them. The\nhopes of the people rise higher and higher. This is He who will\nmake Judea an earthly paradise, a land flowing with milk and honey.\nHe can satisfy every desire. He can break the power of the hated\nRomans. He can deliver Judah and Jerusalem. He can heal the\nsoldiers who are wounded in battle. He can supply whole armies\nwith food. He can conquer the nations, and give to Israel the long-\nsought dominion.\nIn their enthusiasm the people are ready at once to crown Him [378]\nking. They see that He makes no effort to attract attention or secure\nhonor to Himself. In this He is essentially different from the priests\nand rulers, and they fear that He will never urge His claim to David\u2019s\nthrone. Consulting together, they agree to take Him by force, and\nproclaim Him the king of Israel. The disciples unite with the mul-\ntitude in declaring the throne of David the rightful inheritance of\ntheir Master. It is the modesty of Christ, they say, that causes Him\n323\n324 The Desire of Ages\nto refuse such honor. Let the people exalt their Deliverer. Let the ar-\nrogant priests and rulers be forced to honor Him who comes clothed\nwith the authority of God.\nThey eagerly arrange to carry out their purpose; but Jesus sees\nwhat is on foot, and understands, as they cannot, what would be\nthe result of such a movement. Even now the priests and rulers are\nhunting His life. They accuse Him of drawing the people away from\nthem. Violence and insurrection would follow an effort to place\nHim on the throne, and the work of the spiritual kingdom would be\nhindered. Without delay the movement must be checked. Calling\nHis disciples, Jesus bids them take the boat and return at once to\nCapernaum, leaving Him to dismiss the people.\nNever before had a command from Christ seemed so impossible\nof fulfillment. The disciples had long hoped for a popular movement\nto place Jesus on the throne; they could not endure the thought that\nall this enthusiasm should come to nothing. The multitudes that\nwere assembling to keep the Passover were anxious to see the new\nprophet. To His followers this seemed the golden opportunity to\nestablish their beloved Master on the throne of Israel. In the glow of\nthis new ambition it was hard for them to go away by themselves,\nand leave Jesus alone upon that desolate shore. They protested\nagainst the arrangement; but Jesus now spoke with an authority He\nhad never before assumed toward them. They knew that further\nopposition on their part would be useless, and in silence they turned\ntoward the sea.\nJesus now commands the multitude to disperse; and His manner\nis so decisive that they dare not disobey. The words of praise and\nexaltation die on their lips. In the very act of advancing to seize\nHim their steps are stayed, and the glad, eager look fades from\ntheir countenances. In that throng are men of strong mind and firm\ndetermination; but the kingly bearing of Jesus, and His few quiet\nwords of command, quell the tumult, and frustrate their designs.\nThey recognize in Him a power above all earthly authority, and[379]\nwithout a question they submit.\nWhen left alone, Jesus \u201cwent up into a mountain apart to pray.\u201d\nFor hours He continued pleading with God. Not for Himself but\nfor men were those prayers. He prayed for power to reveal to men\nthe divine character of His mission, that Satan might not blind their\nNight on the Lake 325\nunderstanding and pervert their judgment. The Saviour knew that\nHis days of personal ministry on earth were nearly ended, and that\nfew would receive Him as their Redeemer. In travail and conflict of\nsoul He prayed for His disciples. They were to be grievously tried.\nTheir long-cherished hopes, based on a popular delusion, were to\nbe disappointed in a most painful and humiliating manner. In the\nplace of His exaltation to the throne of David they were to witness\nHis crucifixion. This was to be indeed His true coronation. But they\ndid not discern this, and in consequence strong temptations would\ncome to them, which it would be difficult for them to recognize\nas temptations. Without the Holy Spirit to enlighten the mind and\nenlarge the comprehension the faith of the disciples would fail. It\nwas painful to Jesus that their conceptions of His kingdom were, to\nso great a degree, limited to worldly aggrandizement and honor. For\nthem the burden was heavy upon His heart, and He poured out His\nsupplications with bitter agony and tears.\nThe disciples had not put off immediately from the land, as Jesus\ndirected them. They waited for a time, hoping that He would come to\nthem. But as they saw that darkness was fast gathering, they \u201centered [380]\ninto a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.\u201d They had left\nJesus with dissatisfied hearts, more impatient with Him than ever\nbefore since acknowledging Him as their Lord. They murmured\nbecause they had not been permitted to proclaim Him king. They\nblamed themselves for yielding so readily to His command. They\nreasoned that if they had been more persistent they might have\naccomplished their purpose.\nUnbelief was taking possession of their minds and hearts. Love\nof honor had blinded them. They knew that Jesus was hated by the\nPharisees, and they were eager to see Him exalted as they thought\nHe should be. To be united with a teacher who could work mighty\nmiracles, and yet to be reviled as deceivers, was a trial they could\nill endure. Were they always to be accounted followers of a false\nprophet? Would Christ never assert His authority as king? Why\ndid not He who possessed such power reveal Himself in His true\ncharacter, and make their way less painful? Why had He not saved\nJohn the Baptist from a violent death? Thus the disciples reasoned\nuntil they brought upon themselves great spiritual darkness. They\nquestioned, Could Jesus be an impostor, as the Pharisees asserted?\n326 The Desire of Ages\nThe disciples had that day witnessed the wonderful works of\nChrist. It had seemed that heaven had come down to the earth. The\nmemory of that precious, glorious day should have filled them with\nfaith and hope. Had they, out of the abundance of their hearts, been\nconversing together in regard to these things, they would not have\nentered into temptation. But their disappointment had absorbed their\nthoughts. The words of Christ, \u201cGather up the fragments, ... that\nnothing be lost,\u201d were unheeded. Those were hours of large blessing\nto the disciples, but they had forgotten it all. They were in the midst\nof troubled waters. Their thoughts were stormy and unreasonable,\nand the Lord gave them something else to afflict their souls and\noccupy their minds. God often does this when men create burdens\nand troubles for themselves. The disciples had no need to make\ntrouble. Already danger was fast approaching.\nA violent tempest had been stealing upon them, and they were\nunprepared for it. It was a sudden contrast, for the day had been\nperfect; and when the gale struck them, they were afraid. They\nforgot their disaffection, their unbelief, their impatience. Everyone\nworked to keep the boat from sinking. It was but a short distance by\nsea from Bethsaida to the point where they expected to meet Jesus,\nand in ordinary weather the journey required but a few hours; but\nnow they were driven farther and farther from the point they sought.[381]\nUntil the fourth watch of the night they toiled at the oars. Then the\nweary men gave themselves up for lost. In storm and darkness the\nsea had taught them their own helplessness, and they longed for the\npresence of their Master.\nJesus had not forgotten them. The Watcher on the shore saw\nthose fear-stricken men battling with the tempest. Not for a moment\ndid He lose sight of His disciples. With deepest solicitude His\neyes followed the storm-tossed boat with its precious burden; for\nthese men were to be the light of the world. As a mother in tender\nlove watches her child, so the compassionate Master watched His\ndisciples. When their hearts were subdued, their unholy ambition\nquelled, and in humility they prayed for help, it was given them.\nAt the moment when they believe themselves lost, a gleam of\nlight reveals a mysterious figure approaching them upon the water.\nBut they know not that it is Jesus. The One who has come for\ntheir help they count as an enemy. Terror overpowers them. The\nNight on the Lake 327\nhands that have grasped the oars with muscles like iron let go their\nhold. The boat rocks at the will of the waves; all eyes are riveted on\nthis vision of a man walking upon the white-capped billows of the\nfoaming sea.\nThey think it a phantom that omens their destruction, and they\ncry out for fear. Jesus advances as if He would pass them; but they\nrecognize Him, and cry out, entreating His help. Their beloved\nMaster turns, His voice silences their fear, \u201cBe of good cheer: it is I;\nbe not afraid.\u201d\nAs soon as they could credit the wondrous fact, Peter was almost\nbeside himself with joy. As if he could scarcely yet believe, he cried\nout, \u201cLord, if it be Thou, bid me come unto Thee on the water. And\nHe said, Come.\u201d\nLooking unto Jesus, Peter walks securely; but as in self-satis-\nfaction he glances back toward his companions in the boat, his eyes\nare turned from the Saviour. The wind is boisterous. The waves\nroll high, and come directly between him and the Master; and he\nis afraid. For a moment Christ is hidden from his view, and his\nfaith gives way. He begins to sink. But while the billows talk with\ndeath, Peter lifts his eyes from the angry waters, and fixing them\nupon Jesus, cries, \u201cLord, save me.\u201d Immediately Jesus grasps the\noutstretched hand, saying, \u201cO thou of little faith, wherefore didst\nthou doubt?\u201d\nWalking side by side, Peter\u2019s hand in that of his Master, they\nstepped into the boat together. But Peter was now subdued and silent.\nHe had no reason to boast over his fellows, for through unbelief and\nself-exaltation he had very nearly lost his life. When he turned his [382]\neyes from Jesus, his footing was lost, and he sank amid the waves.\nWhen trouble comes upon us, how often we are like Peter! We\nlook upon the waves, instead of keeping our eyes fixed upon the\nSaviour. Our footsteps slide, and the proud waters go over our souls.\nJesus did not bid Peter come to Him that he should perish; He does\nnot call us to follow Him, and then forsake us. \u201cFear not,\u201d He says;\n\u201cfor I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art\nMine. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and\nthrough the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest\nthrough the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame\n328 The Desire of Ages\nkindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel,\nthy Saviour.\u201d Isaiah 43:1-3.\nJesus read the character of His disciples. He knew how sorely\ntheir faith was to be tried. In this incident on the sea He desired\nto reveal to Peter his own weakness,\u2014to show that his safety was\nin constant dependence upon divine power. Amid the storms of\ntemptation he could walk safely only as in utter self-distrust he\nshould rely upon the Saviour. It was on the point where he thought\nhimself strong that Peter was weak; and not until he discerned his\nweakness could he realize his need of dependence upon Christ. Had\nhe learned the lesson that Jesus sought to teach him in that experience\non the sea, he would not have failed when the great test came upon\nhim.\nDay by day God instructs His children. By the circumstances of\nthe daily life He is preparing them to act their part upon that wider\nstage to which His providence has appointed them. It is the issue of\nthe daily test that determines their victory or defeat in life\u2019s great\ncrisis.\nThose who fail to realize their constant dependence upon God\nwill be overcome by temptation. We may now suppose that our feet\nstand secure, and that we shall never be moved. We may say with\nconfidence, \u201cI know in whom I have believed; nothing can shake\nmy faith in God and in His word.\u201d But Satan is planning to take\nadvantage of our hereditary and cultivated traits of character, and\nto blind our eyes to our own necessities and defects. Only through\nrealizing our own weakness and looking steadfastly unto Jesus can\nwe walk securely.\nNo sooner had Jesus taken His place in the boat than the wind\nceased, \u201cand immediately the ship was at the land whither they\nwent.\u201d The night of horror was succeeded by the light of dawn. The\ndisciples, and others who also were on board, bowed at the feet of\nJesus with thankful hearts, saying, \u201cOf a truth Thou art the Son of\nGod!\u201d\nChapter 41\u2014The Crisis in Galilee [383]\nThis chapter is based on John 6:22-71.\nWhen Christ forbade the people to declare Him king, He knew\nthat a turning point in His history was reached. Multitudes who\ndesired to exalt Him to the throne today would turn from Him tomor-\nrow. The disappointment of their selfish ambition would turn their\nlove to hatred, and their praise to curses. Yet knowing this, He took\nno measures to avert the crisis. From the first He had held out to His\nfollowers no hope of earthly rewards. To one who came desiring to\nbecome His disciple He had said, \u201cThe foxes have holes, and the\nbirds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to\nlay His head.\u201d Matthew 8:20. If men could have had the world with\nChrist, multitudes would have proffered Him their allegiance; but\nsuch service He could not accept. Of those now connected with Him\nthere were many who had been attracted by the hope of a worldly\nkingdom. These must be undeceived. The deep spiritual teaching in\nthe miracle of the loaves had not been comprehended. This was to\nbe made plain. And this new revelation would bring with it a closer\ntest.\nThe miracle of the loaves was reported far and near, and very\nearly next morning the people flocked to Bethsaida to see Jesus.\nThey came in great numbers, by land and sea. Those who had left\nHim the preceding night returned, expecting to find Him still there;\nfor there had been no boat by which He could pass to the other side.\nBut their search was fruitless, and many repaired to Capernaum, still\nseeking Him.\nMeanwhile He had arrived at Gennesaret, after an absence of but [384]\none day. As soon as it was known that He had landed, the people\n\u201cran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about\nin beds those that were sick, where they heard He was.\u201d Mark 6:55.\nAfter a time He went to the synagogue, and there those who had\ncome from Bethsaida found Him. They learned from His disciples\n329\n330 The Desire of Ages\nhow He had crossed the sea. The fury of the storm, and the many\nhours of fruitless rowing against adverse winds, the appearance of\nChrist walking upon the water, the fears thus aroused, His reassuring\nwords, the adventure of Peter and its result, with the sudden stilling\nof the tempest and landing of the boat, were all faithfully recounted to\nthe wondering crowd. Not content with this, however, many gathered\nabout Jesus, questioning, \u201cRabbi, when camest Thou hither?\u201d They\nhoped to receive from His own lips a further account of the miracle.\nJesus did not gratify their curiosity. He sadly said, \u201cYe seek Me,\nnot because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves,\nand were filled.\u201d They did not seek Him from any worthy motive;\nbut as they had been fed with the loaves, they hoped still to receive\ntemporal benefit by attaching themselves to Him. The Saviour bade\nthem, \u201cLabor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat\nwhich endureth unto everlasting life.\u201d Seek not merely for material [385]\nbenefit. Let it not be the chief effort to provide for the life that now\nis, but seek for spiritual food, even that wisdom which will endure\nunto everlasting life. This the Son of God alone can give; \u201cfor Him\nhath God the Father sealed.\u201d\nFor the moment the interest of the hearers was awakened. They\nexclaimed, \u201cWhat shall we do, that we might work the works of\nGod?\u201d They had been performing many and burdensome works\nin order to recommend themselves to God; and they were ready\nto hear of any new observance by which they could secure greater\nmerit. Their question meant, What shall we do that we may deserve\nheaven? What is the price we are required to pay in order to obtain\nthe life to come?\n\u201cJesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God,\nthat ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.\u201d The price of heaven\nis Jesus. The way to heaven is through faith in \u201cthe Lamb of God,\nwhich taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d John 1:29.\nBut the people did not choose to receive this statement of divine\ntruth. Jesus had done the very work which prophecy had foretold\nthat the Messiah would do; but they had not witnessed what their\nselfish hopes had pictured as His work. Christ had indeed once fed\nthe multitude with barley loaves; but in the days of Moses Israel\nhad been fed with manna forty years, and far greater blessings were\nexpected from the Messiah. Their dissatisfied hearts queried why, if\nCrisis in Galilee 331\nJesus could perform so many wondrous works as they had witnessed,\ncould He not give health, strength, and riches to all His people, free\nthem from their oppressors, and exalt them to power and honor?\nThe fact that He claimed to be the Sent of God, and yet refused to\nbe Israel\u2019s king, was a mystery which they could not fathom. His\nrefusal was misinterpreted. Many concluded that He dared not assert\nHis claims because He Himself doubted as to the divine character of\nHis mission. Thus they opened their hearts to unbelief, and the seed\nwhich Satan had sown bore fruit of its kind, in misunderstanding\nand defection.\nNow, half mockingly, a rabbi questioned, \u201cWhat sign showest\nThou then, that we may see, and believe Thee? what dost Thou\nwork? Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He\ngave them bread from heaven to eat.\u201d\nThe Jews honored Moses as the giver of the manna, ascribing\npraise to the instrument, and losing sight of Him by whom the work\nhad been accomplished. Their fathers had murmured against Moses,\nand had doubted and denied his divine mission. Now in the same\nspirit the children rejected the One who bore the message of God to [386]\nthemselves. \u201cThen said Jesus unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto\nyou, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven.\u201d The giver of the\nmanna was standing among them. It was Christ Himself who had\nled the Hebrews through the wilderness, and had daily fed them with\nthe bread from heaven. That food was a type of the real bread from\nheaven. The life-giving Spirit, flowing from the infinite fullness of\nGod, is the true manna. Jesus said, \u201cThe bread of God is that which\ncometh down out of heaven, and giveth life unto the world.\u201d John",

      "text": "Still thinking that it was temporal food to which Jesus referred,\nsome of His hearers exclaimed, \u201cLord, evermore give us this bread.\u201d\nJesus then spoke plainly: \u201cI am the bread of life.\u201d\nThe figure which Christ used was a familiar one to the Jews.\nMoses, by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, had said, \u201cMan doth\nnot live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the\nmouth of the Lord.\u201d And the prophet Jeremiah had written, \u201cThy\nwords were found, and I did eat them; and Thy word was unto me\nthe joy and rejoicing of mine heart.\u201d Deuteronomy 8:3; Jeremiah\n15:16. The rabbis themselves had a saying, that the eating of bread,\n332 The Desire of Ages\nin its spiritual significance, was the study of the law and the practice\nof good works; and it was often said that at the Messiah\u2019s coming\nall Israel would be fed. The teaching of the prophets made plain\nthe deep spiritual lesson in the miracle of the loaves. This lesson\nChrist was seeking to open to His hearers in the synagogue. Had\nthey understood the Scriptures, they would have understood His\nwords when He said, \u201cI am the bread of life.\u201d Only the day before,\nthe great multitude, when faint and weary, had been fed by the bread\nwhich He had given. As from that bread they had received physical\nstrength and refreshment, so from Christ they might receive spiritual\nstrength unto eternal life. \u201cHe that cometh to Me,\u201d He said, \u201cshall\nnever hunger; and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst.\u201d But\nHe added, \u201cYe also have seen Me, and believe not.\u201d\nThey had seen Christ by the witness of the Holy Spirit, by the\nrevelation of God to their souls. The living evidences of His power\nhad been before them day after day, yet they asked for still another\nsign. Had this been given, they would have remained as unbelieving\nas before. If they were not convinced by what they had seen and\nheard, it was useless to show them more marvelous works. Unbe-\nlief will ever find excuse for doubt, and will reason away the most\npositive proof.\nAgain Christ appealed to those stubborn hearts. \u201cHim that\ncometh to Me I will in nowise cast out.\u201d All who received Him[387]\nin faith, He said, should have eternal life. Not one could be lost. No\nneed for Pharisees and Sadducees to dispute concerning the future\nlife. No longer need men mourn in hopeless grief over their dead.\n\u201cThis is the will of Him that sent Me, that everyone which seeth the\nSon, and believeth on Him, may have everlasting life: and I will\nraise him up at the last day.\u201d\nBut the leaders of the people were offended, \u201cand they said, Is\nnot this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?\nhow is it then that He saith, I came down from heaven?\u201d They tried\nto arouse prejudice by referring scornfully to the lowly origin of\nJesus. They contemptuously alluded to His life as a Galilean laborer,\nand to His family as being poor and lowly. The claims of this\nuneducated carpenter, they said, were unworthy of their attention.\nAnd on account of His mysterious birth they insinuated that He was\nCrisis in Galilee 333\nof doubtful parentage, thus representing the human circumstances\nof His birth as a blot upon His history.\nJesus did not attempt to explain the mystery of His birth. He\nmade no answer to the questionings in regard to His having come\ndown from heaven, as He had made none to the questions concerning\nHis crossing the sea. He did not call attention to the miracles that\nmarked His life. V oluntarily He had made Himself of no reputation,\nand taken upon Him the form of a servant. But His words and\nworks revealed His character. All whose hearts were open to divine\nillumination would recognize in Him \u201cthe Only-begotten of the\nFather, full of grace and truth.\u201d John 1:14.\nThe prejudice of the Pharisees lay deeper than their questions\nwould indicate; it had its root in the perversity of their hearts. Every\nword and act of Jesus aroused antagonism in them; for the spirit\nwhich they cherished could find in Him no answering chord.\n\u201cNo man can come to Me, except the Father which hath sent\nMe draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written\nin the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man\ntherefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh\nunto Me.\u201d None will ever come to Christ, save those who respond to\nthe drawing of the Father\u2019s love. But God is drawing all hearts unto\nHim, and only those who resist His drawing will refuse to come to\nChrist.\nIn the words, \u201cThey shall be all taught of God,\u201d Jesus referred to\nthe prophecy of Isaiah: \u201cAll thy children shall be taught of the Lord;\nand great shall be the peace of thy children.\u201d Isaiah 54:13. This\nscripture the Jews appropriated to themselves. It was their boast that [388]\nGod was their teacher. But Jesus showed how vain is this claim; for\nHe said, \u201cEvery man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of\nthe Father, cometh unto Me.\u201d Only through Christ could they receive\na knowledge of the Father. Humanity could not endure the vision\nof His glory. Those who had learned of God had been listening to\nthe voice of His Son, and in Jesus of Nazareth they would recognize\nHim who through nature and revelation has declared the Father.\n\u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on Me hath\neverlasting life.\u201d Through the beloved John, who listened to these\nwords, the Holy Spirit declared to the churches, \u201cThis is the record,\nthat God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He\n334 The Desire of Ages\nthat hath the Son hath life.\u201d 1 John 5:11, 12. And Jesus said, \u201cI will\nraise him up at the last day.\u201d Christ became one flesh with us, in\norder that we might become one spirit with Him. It is by virtue of\nthis union that we are to come forth from the grave,\u2014not merely as a\nmanifestation of the power of Christ, but because, through faith, His\nlife has become ours. Those who see Christ in His true character,\nand receive Him into the heart, have everlasting life. It is through\nthe Spirit that Christ dwells in us; and the Spirit of God, received\ninto the heart by faith, is the beginning of the life eternal.\nThe people had referred Christ to the manna which their fathers\nate in the wilderness, as if the furnishing of that food was a greater\nmiracle than Jesus had performed; but He shows how meager was\nthat gift when compared with the blessings He had come to bestow.\nThe manna could sustain only this earthly existence; it did not pre-\nvent the approach of death, nor insure immortality; but the bread of\nheaven would nourish the soul unto everlasting life. The Saviour\nsaid, \u201cI am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the\nwilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from\nheaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living\nbread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread,\nhe shall live forever.\u201d To this figure Christ now adds another. Only\nthrough dying could He impart life to men, and in the words that\nfollow He points to His death as the means of salvation. He says,\n\u201cThe bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life\nof the world.\u201d\nThe Jews were about to celebrate the Passover at Jerusalem,\nin commemoration of the night of Israel\u2019s deliverance, when the\ndestroying angel smote the homes of Egypt. In the paschal lamb God\ndesired them to behold the Lamb of God, and through the symbol[389]\nreceive Him who gave Himself for the life of the world. But the Jews\nhad come to make the symbol all-important, while its significance\nwas unnoticed. They discerned not the Lord\u2019s body. The same truth\nthat was symbolized in the paschal service was taught in the words\nof Christ. But it was still undiscerned.\nNow the rabbis exclaimed angrily, \u201cHow can this Man give us\nHis flesh to eat?\u201d They affected to understand His words in the same\nliteral sense as did Nicodemus when he asked, \u201cHow can a man be\nborn when he is old?\u201d John 3:4. To some extent they comprehended\nCrisis in Galilee 335\nthe meaning of Jesus, but they were not willing to acknowledge it.\nBy misconstruing His words, they hoped to prejudice the people\nagainst Him.\nChrist did not soften down His symbolical representation. He\nreiterated the truth in yet stronger language: \u201cVerily, verily, I say\nunto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His\nblood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh\nMy blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.\nFor My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. He that\neateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in\nhim.\u201d\nTo eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ is to receive Him as\na personal Saviour, believing that He forgives our sins, and that we\nare complete in Him. It is by beholding His love, by dwelling upon\nit, by drinking it in, that we are to become partakers of His nature.\nWhat food is to the body, Christ must be to the soul. Food cannot\nbenefit us unless we eat it, unless it becomes a part of our being.\nSo Christ is of no value to us if we do not know Him as a personal\nSaviour. A theoretical knowledge will do us no good. We must feed\nupon Him, receive Him into the heart, so that His life becomes our\nlife. His love, His grace, must be assimilated.\nBut even these figures fail to present the privilege of the be-\nliever\u2019s relation to Christ. Jesus said, \u201cAs the living Father hath sent\nMe, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth Me, even he shall live\nby Me.\u201d As the Son of God lived by faith in the Father, so are we to\nlive by faith in Christ. So fully was Jesus surrendered to the will of\nGod that the Father alone appeared in His life. Although tempted in\nall points like as we are, He stood before the world untainted by the\nevil that surrounded Him. Thus we also are to overcome as Christ\novercame.\nAre you a follower of Christ? Then all that is written concerning\nthe spiritual life is written for you, and may be attained through\nuniting yourself to Jesus. Is your zeal languishing? has your first [390]\nlove grown cold? Accept again of the proffered love of Christ. Eat\nof His flesh, drink of His blood, and you will become one with the\nFather and with the Son.\nThe unbelieving Jews refused to see any except the most literal\nmeaning in the Saviour\u2019s words. By the ritual law they were forbid-\n336 The Desire of Ages\nden to taste blood, and they now construed Christ\u2019s language into a\nsacrilegious speech, and disputed over it among themselves. Many\neven of the disciples said, \u201cThis is an hard saying; who can hear it?\u201d\nThe Saviour answered them: \u201cDoth this offend you? What and\nif ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where He was before? It is\nthe spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that\nI speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\u201d\nThe life of Christ that gives life to the world is in His word. It\nwas by His word that Jesus healed disease and cast out demons; by\nHis word He stilled the sea, and raised the dead; and the people bore\nwitness that His word was with power. He spoke the word of God,\nas He had spoken through all the prophets and teachers of the Old\nTestament. The whole Bible is a manifestation of Christ, and the\nSaviour desired to fix the faith of His followers on the word. When\nHis visible presence should be withdrawn, the word must be their\nsource of power. Like their Master, they were to live \u201cby every word\nthat proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\u201d Matthew 4:4.\nAs our physical life is sustained by food, so our spiritual life is\nsustained by the word of God. And every soul is to receive life from\nGod\u2019s word for himself. As we must eat for ourselves in order to\nreceive nourishment, so we must receive the word for ourselves. We\nare not to obtain it merely through the medium of another\u2019s mind.\nWe should carefully study the Bible, asking God for the aid of the\nHoly Spirit, that we may understand His word. We should take\none verse, and concentrate the mind on the task of ascertaining the\nthought which God has put in that verse for us. We should dwell\nupon the thought until it becomes our own, and we know \u201cwhat saith\nthe Lord.\u201d\nIn His promises and warnings, Jesus means me. God so loved\nthe world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that I by believing\nin Him, might not perish, but have everlasting life. The experiences\nrelated in God\u2019s word are to be my experiences. Prayer and promise,\nprecept and warning, are mine. \u201cI am crucified with Christ: never-\ntheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I\nnow live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved\nme, and gave Himself for me.\u201d Galatians 2:20. As faith thus receives[391]\nand assimilates the principles of truth, they become a part of the\nbeing and the motive power of the life. The word of God, received\nCrisis in Galilee 337\ninto the soul, molds the thoughts, and enters into the development\nof character.\nBy looking constantly to Jesus with the eye of faith, we shall be\nstrengthened. God will make the most precious revelations to His\nhungering, thirsting people. They will find that Christ is a personal\nSaviour. As they feed upon His word, they find that it is spirit and\nlife. The word destroys the natural, earthly nature, and imparts a\nnew life in Christ Jesus. The Holy Spirit comes to the soul as a\nComforter. By the transforming agency of His grace, the image of\nGod is reproduced in the disciple; he becomes a new creature. Love\ntakes the place of hatred, and the heart receives the divine similitude.\nThis is what it means to live \u201cby every word that proceedeth out of\nthe mouth of God.\u201d This is eating the Bread that comes down from\nheaven.\nChrist had spoken a sacred, eternal truth regarding the relation\nbetween Himself and His followers. He knew the character of those\nwho claimed to be His disciples, and His words tested their faith.\nHe declared that they were to believe and act upon His teaching. All\nwho received Him would partake of His nature, and be conformed\nto His character. This involved the relinquishment of their cherished\nambitions. It required the complete surrender of themselves to Jesus.\nThey were called to become self-sacrificing, meek and lowly in heart.\nThey must walk in the narrow path traveled by the Man of Calvary,\nif they would share in the gift of life and the glory of heaven.\nThe test was too great. The enthusiasm of those who had sought\nto take Him by force and make Him king grew cold. This discourse\nin the synagogue, they declared, had opened their eyes. Now they\nwere undeceived. In their minds His words were a direct confession\nthat He was not the Messiah, and that no earthly rewards were to\nbe realized from connection with Him. They had welcomed His\nmiracle-working power; they were eager to be freed from disease\nand suffering; but they would not come into sympathy with His self-\nsacrificing life. They cared not for the mysterious spiritual kingdom\nof which He spoke. The insincere, the selfish, who had sought\nHim, no longer desired Him. If He would not devote His power and\ninfluence to obtaining their freedom from the Romans, they would\nhave nothing to do with Him.\n338 The Desire of Ages\nJesus told them plainly, \u201cThere are some of you that believe not;\u201d\nadding, \u201cTherefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto Me,\nexcept it were given unto him of My Father.\u201d He wished them to[392]\nunderstand that if they were not drawn to Him it was because their\nhearts were not open to the Holy Spirit. \u201cThe natural man receiveth\nnot the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him:\nneither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\u201d\n1 Corinthians 2:14. It is by faith that the soul beholds the glory of\nJesus. This glory is hidden, until, through the Holy Spirit, faith is\nkindled in the soul.\nBy the public rebuke of their unbelief these disciples were still\nfurther alienated from Jesus. They were greatly displeased, and\nwishing to wound the Saviour and gratify the malice of the Phar-\nisees, they turned their backs upon Him, and left Him with disdain.\nThey had made their choice,\u2014had taken the form without the spirit,\nthe husk without the kernel. Their decision was never afterward\nreversed; for they walked no more with Jesus.\n\u201cWhose fan is in His hand, and He will throughly purge His\nfloor, and gather His wheat into the garner.\u201d Matthew 3:12. This\nwas one of the times of purging. By the words of truth, the chaff\nwas being separated from the wheat. Because they were too vain\nand self-righteous to receive reproof, too world-loving to accept a\nlife of humility, many turned away from Jesus. Many are still doing\nthe same thing. Souls are tested today as were those disciples in the\nsynagogue at Capernaum. When truth is brought home to the heart,\nthey see that their lives are not in accordance with the will of God.\nThey see the need of an entire change in themselves; but they are not\nwilling to take up the self-denying work. Therefore they are angry\nwhen their sins are discovered. They go away offended, even as the\ndisciples left Jesus, murmuring, \u201cThis is an hard saying; who can\nhear it?\u201d\nPraise and flattery would be pleasing to their ears; but the truth\nis unwelcome; they cannot hear it. When the crowds follow, and the\nmultitudes are fed, and the shouts of triumph are heard, their voices\nare loud in praise; but when the searching of God\u2019s Spirit reveals\ntheir sin, and bids them leave it, they turn their backs upon the truth,\nand walk no more with Jesus.\nCrisis in Galilee 339\nAs those disaffected disciples turned away from Christ, a differ-\nent spirit took control of them. They could see nothing attractive in\nHim whom they had once found so interesting. They sought out His\nenemies, for they were in harmony with their spirit and work. They\nmisinterpreted His words, falsified His statements, and impugned\nHis motives. They sustained their course by gathering up every item\nthat could be turned against Him; and such indignation was stirred [393]\nup by these false reports that His life was in danger.\nThe news spread swiftly that by His own confession Jesus of\nNazareth was not the Messiah. And thus in Galilee the current of\npopular feeling was turned against Him, as, the year before, it had\nbeen in Judea. Alas for Israel! They rejected their Saviour, because\nthey longed for a conqueror who would give them temporal power.\nThey wanted the meat which perishes, and not that which endures\nunto everlasting life.\nWith a yearning heart, Jesus saw those who had been His dis-\nciples departing from Him, the Life and the Light of men. The\nconsciousness that His compassion was unappreciated, His love\nunrequited, His mercy slighted, His salvation rejected, filled Him\nwith sorrow that was inexpressible. It was such developments as\nthese that made Him a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.\nWithout attempting to hinder those who were leaving Him, Jesus\nturned to the twelve and said, \u201cWill ye also go away?\u201d\nPeter replied by asking, \u201cLord, to whom shall we go?\u201d \u201cThou\nhast the words of eternal life,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we believe and are\nsure that Thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.\u201d\n\u201cTo whom shall we go?\u201d The teachers of Israel were slaves to\nformalism. The Pharisees and Sadducees were in constant con-\ntention. To leave Jesus was to fall among sticklers for rites and\nceremonies, and ambitious men who sought their own glory. The\ndisciples had found more peace and joy since they had accepted\nChrist than in all their previous lives. How could they go back to\nthose who had scorned and persecuted the Friend of sinners? They\nhad long been looking for the Messiah; now He had come, and they\ncould not turn from His presence to those who were hunting His life,\nand had persecuted them for becoming His followers.\n\u201cTo whom shall we go?\u201d Not from the teaching of Christ, His\nlessons of love and mercy, to the darkness of unbelief, the wicked-\n340 The Desire of Ages\nness of the world. While the Saviour was forsaken by many who\nhad witnessed His wonderful works, Peter expressed the faith of the\ndisciples,\u2014\u201cThou art that Christ.\u201d The very thought of losing this\nanchor of their souls filled them with fear and pain. To be destitute\nof a Saviour was to be adrift on a dark and stormy sea.\nMany of the words and acts of Jesus appear mysterious to finite\nminds, but every word and act had its definite purpose in the work\nfor our redemption; each was calculated to produce its own result.\nIf we were capable of understanding His purposes, all would appear[394]\nimportant, complete, and in harmony with His mission.\nWhile we cannot now comprehend the works and ways of God,\nwe can discern His great love, which underlies all His dealings with\nmen. He who lives near to Jesus will understand much of the mystery\nof godliness. He will recognize the mercy that administers reproof,\nthat tests the character, and brings to light the purpose of the heart.\nWhen Jesus presented the testing truth that caused so many of\nHis disciples to turn back, He knew what would be the result of\nHis words; but He had a purpose of mercy to fulfill. He foresaw\nthat in the hour of temptation every one of His beloved disciples\nwould be severely tested. His agony in Gethsemane, His betrayal\nand crucifixion, would be to them a most trying ordeal. Had no\nprevious test been given, many who were actuated by merely selfish\nmotives would have been connected with them. When their Lord\nwas condemned in the judgment hall; when the multitude who had\nhailed Him as their king hissed at Him and reviled Him; when the\njeering crowd cried, \u201cCrucify Him!\u201d\u2014when their worldly ambitions\nwere disappointed, these self-seeking ones would, by renouncing\ntheir allegiance to Jesus, have brought upon the disciples a bitter,\nheart-burdening sorrow, in addition to their grief and disappointment\nin the ruin of their fondest hopes. In that hour of darkness, the\nexample of those who turned from Him might have carried others\nwith them. But Jesus brought about this crisis while by His personal\npresence He could still strengthen the faith of His true followers.\nCompassionate Redeemer, who in the full knowledge of the\ndoom that awaited Him, tenderly smoothed the way for the disciples,\nprepared them for their crowning trial, and strengthened them for\nthe final test!\nChapter 42\u2014Tradition [395]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 15:1-20; Mark 7:1-23.\nThe scribes and Pharisees, expecting to see Jesus at the Passover,\nhad laid a trap for Him. But Jesus, knowing their purpose, had\nabsented Himself from this gathering. \u201cThen came together unto\nHim the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes.\u201d As He did not go\nto them, they came to Him. For a time it had seemed that the\npeople of Galilee would receive Jesus as the Messiah, and that\nthe power of the hierarchy in that region would be broken. The\nmission of the twelve, indicating the extension of Christ\u2019s work, and\nbringing the disciples more directly into conflict with the rabbis,\nhad excited anew the jealousy of the leaders at Jerusalem. The spies\nthey sent to Capernaum in the early part of His ministry, who had\ntried to fix on Him the charge of Sabbathbreaking, had been put to\nconfusion; but the rabbis were bent on carrying out their purpose.\nNow another deputation was sent to watch His movements, and find\nsome accusation against Him.\nAs before, the ground of complaint was His disregard of the\ntraditional precepts that encumbered the law of God. These were\nprofessedly designed to guard the observance of the law, but they\nwere regarded as more sacred than the law itself. When they came\nin collision with the commandments given from Sinai, preference\nwas given to the rabbinical precepts.\nAmong the observances most strenuously enforced was that of\nceremonial purification. A neglect of the forms to be observed\nbefore eating was accounted a heinous sin, to be punished both in [396]\nthis world and in the next; and it was regarded as a virtue to destroy\nthe transgressor.\nThe rules in regard to purification were numberless. The period\nof a lifetime was scarcely sufficient for one to learn them all. The\nlife of those who tried to observe the rabbinical requirements was\none long struggle against ceremonial defilement, an endless round\n341\n342 The Desire of Ages\nof washings and purifications. While the people were occupied with\ntrifling distinctions, and observances which God had not required,\ntheir attention was turned away from the great principles of His law.\nChrist and His disciples did not observe these ceremonial wash-\nings, and the spies made this neglect the ground of their accusation.\nThey did not, however, make a direct attack on Christ, but came to\nHim with criticism of His disciples. In the presence of the multitude\nthey said, \u201cWhy do Thy disciples transgress the tradition of the\nelders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.\u201d\nWhenever the message of truth comes home to souls with special\npower, Satan stirs up his agents to start a dispute over some minor\nquestion. Thus he seeks to attract attention from the real issue.\nWhenever a good work is begun, there are cavilers ready to enter\ninto dispute over forms or technicalities, to draw minds away from\nthe living realities. When it appears that God is about to work\nin a special manner for His people, let them not be enticed into a\ncontroversy that will work only ruin of souls. The questions that\nmost concern us are, Do I believe with saving faith on the Son of\nGod? Is my life in harmony with the divine law? \u201cHe that believeth\non the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son\nshall not see life.\u201d \u201cAnd hereby we do know that we know Him, if\nwe keep His commandments.\u201d John 3:36; 1 John 2:3.\nJesus made no attempt to defend Himself or His disciples. He\nmade no reference to the charges against Him, but proceeded to\nshow the spirit that actuated these sticklers for human rites. He\ngave them an example of what they were repeatedly doing, and\nhad done just before coming in search of Him. \u201cFull well ye reject\nthe commandment of God,\u201d He said, \u201cthat ye may keep your own\ntradition. For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and,\nWhoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death: but ye say, If\na man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a\ngift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.\nAnd ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother.\u201d\nThey set aside the fifth commandment as of no consequence, but[397]\nwere very exact in carrying out the traditions of the elders. They\ntaught the people that the devotion of their property to the temple\nwas a duty more sacred than even the support of their parents; and\nthat, however great the necessity, it was sacrilege to impart to father\nTradition 343\nor mother any part of what had been thus consecrated. An undutiful\nchild had only to pronounce the word \u201cCorban\u201d over his property,\nthus devoting it to God, and he could retain it for his own use during\nhis lifetime, and after his death it was to be appropriated to the\ntemple service. Thus he was at liberty, both in life and in death,\nto dishonor and defraud his parents, under cover of a pretended\ndevotion to God.\nNever, by word or deed, did Jesus lessen man\u2019s obligation to\npresent gifts and offerings to God. It was Christ who gave all the\ndirections of the law in regard to tithes and offerings. When on earth\nHe commended the poor woman who gave her all to the temple\ntreasury. But the apparent zeal for God on the part of the priests and\nrabbis was a pretense to cover their desire for self-aggrandizement.\nThe people were deceived by them. They were bearing heavy bur-\ndens which God had not imposed. Even the disciples of Christ were\nnot wholly free from the yoke that had been bound upon them by\ninherited prejudice and rabbinical authority. Now, by revealing the\ntrue spirit of the rabbis, Jesus sought to free from the bondage of\ntradition all who were really desirous of serving God.\n\u201cYe hypocrites,\u201d He said, addressing the wily spies, \u201cwell did\nEsaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto\nMe with their mouth, and honoreth Me with their lips; but their\nheart is far from Me. But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for\ndoctrines the commandments of men.\u201d The words of Christ were an\narraignment of the whole system of Pharisaism. He declared that by\nplacing their requirements above the divine precepts the rabbis were\nsetting themselves above God.\nThe deputies from Jerusalem were filled with rage. They could\nnot accuse Christ as a violator of the law given from Sinai, for He\nspoke as its defender against their traditions. The great precepts of\nthe law, which He had presented, appeared in striking contrast to the\npetty rules that men had devised.\nTo the multitude, and afterward more fully to His disciples, Jesus\nexplained that defilement comes not from without, but from within.\nPurity and impurity pertain to the soul. It is the evil deed, the evil\nword, the evil thought, the transgression of the law of God, not the\nneglect of external, man-made ceremonies, that defiles a man.\nThe disciples noted the rage of the spies as their false teaching [398]\n344 The Desire of Ages\nwas exposed. They saw the angry looks, and heard the half-muttered\nwords of dissatisfaction and revenge. Forgetting how often Christ\nhad given evidence that He read the heart as an open book, they told\nHim of the effect of His words. Hoping that He might conciliate\nthe enraged officials, they said to Jesus, \u201cKnowest Thou that the\nPharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?\u201d\nHe answered, \u201cEvery plant, which My heavenly Father hath not\nplanted, shall be rooted up.\u201d The customs and traditions so highly\nvalued by the rabbis were of this world, not from heaven. However\ngreat their authority with the people, they could not endure the testing\nof God. Every human invention that has been substituted for the\ncommandments of God will be found worthless in that day when\n\u201cGod shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing,\nwhether it be good, or whether it be evil.\u201d Ecclesiastes 12:14.\nThe substitution of the precepts of men for the commandments\nof God has not ceased. Even among Christians are found institutions\nand usages that have no better foundation than the traditions of\nthe fathers. Such institutions, resting upon mere human authority,\nhave supplanted those of divine appointment. Men cling to their\ntraditions, and revere their customs, and cherish hatred against those\nwho seek to show them their error. In this day, when we are bidden\nto call attention to the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus,\nwe see the same enmity as was manifested in the days of Christ. Of\nthe remnant people of God it is written, \u201cThe dragon was wroth with\nthe woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed,\nwhich keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of\nJesus Christ.\u201d Revelation 12:17.\nBut \u201cevery plant, which My heavenly Father hath not planted,\nshall be rooted up.\u201d In place of the authority of the so-called fathers\nof the church, God bids us accept the word of the eternal Father,\nthe Lord of heaven and earth. Here alone is truth unmixed with\nerror. David said, \u201cI have more understanding than all my teachers:\nfor Thy testimonies are my meditation. I understand more than the\nancients, because I keep Thy precepts.\u201d Psalm 119:99, 100. Let\nall who accept human authority, the customs of the church, or the\ntraditions of the fathers, take heed to the warning conveyed in the\nwords of Christ, \u201cIn vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines\nthe commandments of men.\u201d\nChapter 43\u2014Barriers Broken Down [399]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 15:21-28; Mark 7:24-30.\nAfter the encounter with the Pharisees, Jesus withdrew from\nCapernaum, and crossing Galilee, repaired to the hill country on the\nborders of Phoenicia. Looking westward, He could see, spread out\nupon the plain below, the ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon, with their\nheathen temples, their magnificent palaces and marts of trade, and\nthe harbors filled with shipping. Beyond was the blue expanse of\nthe Mediterranean, over which the messengers of the gospel were to\nbear its glad tidings to the centers of the world\u2019s great empire. But\nthe time was not yet. The work before Him now was to prepare His\ndisciples for their mission. In coming to this region He hoped to find\nthe retirement He had failed to secure at Bethsaida. Yet this was not\nHis only purpose in taking this journey.\n\u201cBehold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders,\nand cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Thou Son of David;\nmy daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.\u201d Matthew 15:22, R. V .\nThe people of this district were of the old Canaanite race. They were\nidolaters, and were despised and hated by the Jews. To this class\nbelonged the woman who now came to Jesus. She was a heathen,\nand was therefore excluded from the advantages which the Jews\ndaily enjoyed. There were many Jews living among the Phoenicians, [400]\nand the tidings of Christ\u2019s work had penetrated to this region. Some\nof the people had listened to His words and had witnessed His\nwonderful works. This woman had heard of the prophet, who, it\nwas reported, healed all manner of diseases. As she heard of His\npower, hope sprang up in her heart. Inspired by a mother\u2019s love,\nshe determined to present her daughter\u2019s case to Him. It was her\nresolute purpose to bring her affliction to Jesus. He must heal her\nchild. She had sought help from the heathen gods, but had obtained\nno relief. And at times she was tempted to think, What can this\nJewish teacher do for me? But the word had come, He heals all\n345\n346 The Desire of Ages\nmanner of diseases, whether those who come to Him for help are\nrich or poor. She determined not to lose her only hope.\nChrist knew this woman\u2019s situation. He knew that she was long-\ning to see Him, and He placed Himself in her path. By ministering\nto her sorrow, He could give a living representation of the lesson He\ndesigned to teach. For this He had brought His disciples into this\nregion. He desired them to see the ignorance existing in cities and\nvillages close to the land of Israel. The people who had been given\nevery opportunity to understand the truth were without a knowledge\nof the needs of those around them. No effort was made to help souls\nin darkness. The partition wall which Jewish pride had erected, shut\neven the disciples from sympathy with the heathen world. But these\nbarriers were to be broken down.\nChrist did not immediately reply to the woman\u2019s request. He\nreceived this representative of a despised race as the Jews would have\ndone. In this He designed that His disciples should be impressed\nwith the cold and heartless manner in which the Jews would treat\nsuch a case, as evinced by His reception of the woman, and the\ncompassionate manner in which He would have them deal with such\ndistress, as manifested by His subsequent granting of her petition.\nBut although Jesus did not reply, the woman did not lose faith.\nAs He passed on, as if not hearing her, she followed Him, continuing\nher supplications. Annoyed by her importunities, the disciples asked\nJesus to send her away. They saw that their Master treated her with\nindifference, and they therefore supposed that the prejudice of the\nJews against the Canaanites was pleasing to Him. But it was a\npitying Saviour to whom the woman made her plea, and in answer to\nthe request of the disciples, Jesus said, \u201cI am not sent but unto the lost\nsheep of the house of Israel.\u201d Although this answer appeared to be in[401]\naccordance with the prejudice of the Jews, it was an implied rebuke\nto the disciples, which they afterward understood as reminding them\nof what He had often told them,\u2014that He came to the world to save\nall who would accept Him.\nThe woman urged her case with increased earnestness, bowing\nat Christ\u2019s feet, and crying, \u201cLord, help me.\u201d Jesus, still apparently\nrejecting her entreaties, according to the unfeeling prejudice of the\nJews, answered, \u201cIt is not meet to take the children\u2019s bread, and\nto cast it to dogs.\u201d This was virtually asserting that it was not just\nBarriers Broken Down 347\nto lavish the blessings brought to the favored people of God upon\nstrangers and aliens from Israel. This answer would have utterly\ndiscouraged a less earnest seeker. But the woman saw that her\nopportunity had come. Beneath the apparent refusal of Jesus, she saw\na compassion that He could not hide. \u201cTruth, Lord,\u201d she answered,\n\u201cyet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters\u2019 table.\u201d\nWhile the children of the household eat at the father\u2019s table, even\nthe dogs are not left unfed. They have a right to the crumbs that\nfall from the table abundantly supplied. So while there were many\nblessings given to Israel, was there not also a blessing for her? She\nwas looked upon as a dog, and had she not then a dog\u2019s claim to a\ncrumb from His bounty?\nJesus had just departed from His field of labor because the scribes\nand Pharisees were seeking to take His life. They murmured and\ncomplained. They manifested unbelief and bitterness, and refused\nthe salvation so freely offered them. Here Christ meets one of an\nunfortunate and despised race, that has not been favored with the\nlight of God\u2019s word; yet she yields at once to the divine influence of\nChrist, and has implicit faith in His ability to grant the favor she asks.\nShe begs for the crumbs that fall from the Master\u2019s table. If she may\nhave the privilege of a dog, she is willing to be regarded as a dog.\nShe has no national or religious prejudice or pride to influence her\ncourse, and she immediately acknowledges Jesus as the Redeemer,\nand as being able to do all that she asks of Him.\nThe Saviour is satisfied. He has tested her faith in Him. By His\ndealings with her, He has shown that she who has been regarded\nas an outcast from Israel is no longer an alien, but a child in God\u2019s\nhousehold. As a child it is her privilege to share in the Father\u2019s\ngifts. Christ now grants her request, and finishes the lesson to the\ndisciples. Turning to her with a look of pity and love, He says, \u201cO\nwoman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.\u201d From [402]\nthat hour her daughter became whole. The demon troubled her no\nmore. The woman departed, acknowledging her Saviour, and happy\nin the granting of her prayer.\nThis was the only miracle that Jesus wrought while on this\njourney. It was for the performance of this act that He went to the\nborders of Tyre and Sidon. He wished to relieve the afflicted woman,\nand at the same time to leave an example in His work of mercy\n348 The Desire of Ages\ntoward one of a despised people for the benefit of His disciples when\nHe should no longer be with them. He wished to lead them from\ntheir Jewish exclusiveness to be interested in working for others\nbesides their own people.\nJesus longed to unfold the deep mysteries of the truth which\nhad been hid for ages, that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs with\nthe Jews, and \u201cpartakers of His promise in Christ by the gospel.\u201d\nEphesians 3:6. This truth the disciples were slow to learn, and the\ndivine Teacher gave them lesson upon lesson. In rewarding the\nfaith of the centurion at Capernaum, and preaching the gospel to\nthe inhabitants of Sychar, He had already given evidence that He\ndid not share the intolerance of the Jews. But the Samaritans had\nsome knowledge of God; and the centurion had shown kindness to\nIsrael. Now Jesus brought the disciples in contact with a heathen,\nwhom they regarded as having no reason above any of her people,\nto expect favor from Him. He would give an example of how such a\none should be treated. The disciples had thought that He dispensed\ntoo freely the gifts of His grace. He would show that His love was\nnot to be circumscribed to race or nation.\nWhen He said, \u201cI am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house\nof Israel,\u201d He stated the truth, and in His work for the Canaanite\nwoman He was fulfilling His commission. This woman was one of\nthe lost sheep that Israel should have rescued. It was their appointed\nwork, the work which they had neglected, that Christ was doing.\nThis act opened the minds of the disciples more fully to the labor\nthat lay before them among the Gentiles. They saw a wide field\nof usefulness outside of Judea. They saw souls bearing sorrows\nunknown to those more highly favored. Among those whom they\nhad been taught to despise were souls longing for help from the\nmighty Healer, hungering for the light of truth, which had been so\nabundantly given to the Jews.\nAfterward, when the Jews turned still more persistently from the\ndisciples, because they declared Jesus to be the Saviour of the world,\nand when the partition wall between Jew and Gentile was broken[403]\ndown by the death of Christ, this lesson, and similar ones which\npointed to the gospel work unrestricted by custom or nationality, had\na powerful influence upon the representatives of Christ, in directing\ntheir labors.\nBarriers Broken Down 349\nThe Saviour\u2019s visit to Phoenicia and the miracle there performed\nhad a yet wider purpose. Not alone for the afflicted woman, nor\neven for His disciples and those who received their labors, was the\nwork accomplished; but also \u201cthat ye might believe that Jesus is\nthe Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life\nthrough His name.\u201d John 20:31. The same agencies that barred men\naway from Christ eighteen hundred years ago are at work today. The\nspirit which built up the partition wall between Jew and Gentile is\nstill active. Pride and prejudice have built strong walls of separation\nbetween different classes of men. Christ and His mission have been\nmisrepresented, and multitudes feel that they are virtually shut away\nfrom the ministry of the gospel. But let them not feel that they are\nshut away from Christ. There are no barriers which man or Satan\ncan erect but that faith can penetrate.\nIn faith the woman of Phoenicia flung herself against the barriers\nthat had been piled up between Jew and Gentile. Against discour-\nagement, regardless of appearances that might have led her to doubt,\nshe trusted the Saviour\u2019s love. It is thus that Christ desires us to trust\nin Him. The blessings of salvation are for every soul. Nothing but\nhis own choice can prevent any man from becoming a partaker of\nthe promise in Christ by the gospel.\nCaste is hateful to God. He ignores everything of this character.\nIn His sight the souls of all men are of equal value. He \u201chath made of\none blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth,\nand hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of\ntheir habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might\nfeel after Him, and find Him, though He be not far from every one of\nus.\u201d Without distinction of age, or rank, or nationality, or religious\nprivilege, all are invited to come unto Him and live. \u201cWhosoever\nbelieveth on Him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference.\u201d\n\u201cThere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free.\u201d\n\u201cThe rich and poor meet together: the Lord is the Maker of them\nall.\u201d \u201cThe same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him. For\nwhosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\u201d Acts\n17:26, 27; Galatians 3:28; Proverbs 22:2; Romans 10:11-13.\nChapter 44\u2014The True Sign[404]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 15:29-39; Matthew 16:1-12;\nMark 7:31-37; Mark 8:1-21.\n\u201cAgain He went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through\nSidon unto the Sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of\nDecapolis.\u201d Mark 7:31, R. V .\nIt was in the region of Decapolis that the demoniacs of Gergesa\nhad been healed. Here the people, alarmed at the destruction of\nthe swine, had constrained Jesus to depart from among them. But\nthey had listened to the messengers He left behind, and a desire was\naroused to see Him. As He came again into that region, a crowd\ngathered about Him, and a deaf, stammering man was brought to\nHim. Jesus did not, according to His custom, restore the man by\na word only. Taking him apart from the multitude, He put His\nfingers in his ears, and touched his tongue; looking up to heaven,\nHe sighed at thought of the ears that would not be open to the truth,\nthe tongues that refused to acknowledge the Redeemer. At the word,\n\u201cBe opened,\u201d the man\u2019s speech was restored, and, disregarding the\ncommand to tell no man, he published abroad the story of his cure.\nJesus went up into a mountain, and there the multitude flocked\nto Him, bringing their sick and lame, and laying them at His feet.\nHe healed them all; and the people, heathen as they were, glorified\nthe God of Israel. For three days they continued to throng about\nthe Saviour, sleeping at night in the open air, and through the day\npressing eagerly to hear the words of Christ, and to see His works.\nAt the end of three days their food was spent. Jesus would not send[405]\nthem away hungry, and He called upon His disciples to give them\nfood. Again the disciples revealed their unbelief. At Bethsaida they\nhad seen how, with Christ\u2019s blessing, their little store availed for\nthe feeding of the multitude; yet they did not now bring forward\ntheir all, trusting His power to multiply it for the hungry crowds.\nMoreover, those whom He fed at Bethsaida were Jews; these were\n350\nTrue Sign 351\nGentiles and heathen. Jewish prejudice was still strong in the hearts\nof the disciples, and they answered Jesus, \u201cWhence can a man\nsatisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?\u201d But obedient\nto His word they brought Him what they had,\u2014seven loaves and\ntwo fishes. The multitude were fed, seven large baskets of fragments\nremaining. Four thousand men, besides women and children, were\nthus refreshed, and Jesus sent them away with glad and grateful\nhearts.\nThen taking a boat with His disciples, He crossed the lake to\nMagdala, at the southern end of the plain of Gennesaret. In the border\nof Tyre and Sidon His spirit had been refreshed by the confiding trust\nof the Syrophoenician woman. The heathen people of Decapolis\nhad received Him with gladness. Now as He landed once more\nin Galilee, where His power had been most strikingly manifested,\nwhere most of His works of mercy had been performed, and His\nteaching given, He was met with contemptuous unbelief.\nA deputation of Pharisees had been joined by representatives\nfrom the rich and lordly Sadducees, the party of the priests, the\nskeptics and aristocracy of the nation. The two sects had been at\nbitter enmity. The Sadducees courted the favor of the ruling power\nin order to maintain their own position and authority. The Pharisees,\non the other hand, fostered the popular hatred against the Romans,\nlonging for the time when they could throw off the yoke of the\nconqueror. But Pharisee and Sadducee now united against Christ.\nLike seeks like; and evil, wherever it exists, leagues with evil for the\ndestruction of the good.\nNow the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Christ, asking for a [406]\nsign from heaven. When in the days of Joshua Israel went out to\nbattle with the Canaanites at Bethhoron, the sun had stood still at\nthe leader\u2019s command until victory was gained; and many similar\nwonders had been manifest in their history. Some such sign was\ndemanded of Jesus. But these signs were not what the Jews needed.\nNo mere external evidence could benefit them. What they needed\nwas not intellectual enlightenment, but spiritual renovation.\n\u201cO ye hypocrites,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cye can discern the face of the\nsky,\u201d\u2014by studying the sky they could foretell the weather,\u2014\u201cbut\ncan ye not discern the signs of the times?\u201d Christ\u2019s own words,\nspoken with the power of the Holy Spirit that convicted them of sin,\n352 The Desire of Ages\nwere the sign that God had given for their salvation. And signs direct\nfrom heaven had been given to attest the mission of Christ. The song\nof the angels to the shepherds, the star that guided the wise men, the\ndove and the voice from heaven at His baptism, were witnesses for\nHim.\n\u201cAnd He sighed deeply in His spirit, and saith, Why doth this\ngeneration seek after a sign?\u201d \u201cThere shall no sign be given unto\nit, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.\u201d As Jonah was three days and\nthree nights in the belly of the whale, Christ was to be the same\ntime \u201cin the heart of the earth.\u201d And as the preaching of Jonah was\na sign to the Ninevites, so Christ\u2019s preaching was a sign to His\ngeneration. But what a contrast in the reception of the word! The\npeople of the great heathen city trembled as they heard the warning\nfrom God. Kings and nobles humbled themselves; the high and\nthe lowly together cried to the God of heaven, and His mercy was\ngranted unto them. \u201cThe men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with\nthis generation,\u201d Christ had said, \u201cand shall condemn it: because\nthey repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than\nJonas is here.\u201d Matthew 12:40, 41.\nEvery miracle that Christ performed was a sign of His divinity.\nHe was doing the very work that had been foretold of the Messiah;\nbut to the Pharisees these works of mercy were a positive offense.\nThe Jewish leaders looked with heartless indifference on human\nsuffering. In many cases their selfishness and oppression had caused\nthe affliction that Christ relieved. Thus His miracles were to them a\nreproach.\nThat which led the Jews to reject the Saviour\u2019s work was the\nhighest evidence of His divine character. The greatest significance\nof His miracles is seen in the fact that they were for the blessing of\nhumanity. The highest evidence that He came from God is that His [407]\nlife revealed the character of God. He did the works and spoke the\nwords of God. Such a life is the greatest of all miracles.\nWhen the message of truth is presented in our day, there are many\nwho, like the Jews, cry, Show us a sign. Work us a miracle. Christ\nwrought no miracle at the demand of the Pharisees. He wrought\nno miracle in the wilderness in answer to Satan\u2019s insinuations. He\ndoes not impart to us power to vindicate ourselves or to satisfy the\ndemands of unbelief and pride. But the gospel is not without a sign\nTrue Sign 353\nof its divine origin. Is it not a miracle that we can break from the\nbondage of Satan? Enmity against Satan is not natural to the human\nheart; it is implanted by the grace of God. When one who has been\ncontrolled by a stubborn, wayward will is set free, and yields himself\nwholeheartedly to the drawing of God\u2019s heavenly agencies, a miracle\nis wrought; so also when a man who has been under strong delusion\ncomes to understand moral truth. Every time a soul is converted,\nand learns to love God and keep His commandments, the promise of\nGod is fulfilled, \u201cA new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit\nwill I put within you.\u201d Ezekiel 36:26. The change in human hearts,\nthe transformation of human characters, is a miracle that reveals an\never-living Saviour, working to rescue souls. A consistent life in\nChrist is a great miracle. In the preaching of the word of God, the\nsign that should be manifest now and always is the presence of the\nHoly Spirit, to make the word a regenerating power to those that\nhear. This is God\u2019s witness before the world to the divine mission of\nHis Son.\nThose who desired a sign from Jesus had so hardened their hearts\nin unbelief that they did not discern in His character the likeness of\nGod. They would not see that His mission was in fulfillment of the\nScriptures. In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, Jesus said to\nthe Pharisees, \u201cIf they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will\nthey be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.\u201d Luke 16:31. No\nsign that could be given in heaven or earth would benefit them.\nJesus \u201csighed deeply in His spirit,\u201d and, turning from the group\nof cavilers, re-entered the boat with His disciples. In sorrowful\nsilence they again crossed the lake. They did not, however, return to\nthe place they had left, but directed their course toward Bethsaida,\nnear where the five thousand had been fed. Upon reaching the farther\nside, Jesus said, \u201cTake heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees\nand of the Sadducees.\u201d The Jews had been accustomed since the [408]\ndays of Moses to put away leaven from their houses at the Passover\nseason, and they had thus been taught to regard it as a type of sin. Yet\nthe disciples failed to understand Jesus. In their sudden departure\nfrom Magdala they had forgotten to take bread, and they had with\nthem only one loaf. To this circumstance they understood Christ to\nrefer, warning them not to buy bread of a Pharisee or a Sadducee.\nTheir lack of faith and spiritual insight had often led them to similar\n354 The Desire of Ages\nmisconception of His words. Now Jesus reproved them for thinking\nthat He who had fed thousands with a few fishes and barley loaves\ncould in that solemn warning have referred merely to temporal food.\nThere was danger that the crafty reasoning of the Pharisees and the\nSadducees would leaven His disciples with unbelief, causing them\nto think lightly of the works of Christ.\nThe disciples were inclined to think that their Master should have\ngranted the demand for a sign in the heavens. They believed that He\nwas fully able to do this, and that such a sign would put His enemies\nto silence. They did not discern the hypocrisy of these cavilers.\nMonths afterward, \u201cwhen there were gathered together an in-\nnumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon\nanother,\u201d Jesus repeated the same teaching. \u201cHe began to say unto\nHis disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees,\nwhich is hypocrisy.\u201d Luke 12:1.\nThe leaven placed in the meal works imperceptibly, changing the\nwhole mass to its own nature. So if hypocrisy is allowed to exist in\nthe heart, it permeates the character and the life. A striking example\nof the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, Christ had already rebuked in\ndenouncing the practice of \u201cCorban,\u201d by which a neglect of filial\nduty was concealed under a pretense of liberality to the temple. The\nscribes and Pharisees were insinuating deceptive principles. They\nconcealed the real tendency of their doctrines, and improved every\noccasion to instill them artfully into the minds of their hearers. These\nfalse principles, when once accepted, worked like leaven in the meal,\npermeating and transforming the character. It was this deceptive\nteaching that made it so hard for the people to receive the words of\nChrist.\nThe same influences are working today through those who try to\nexplain the law of God in such a way as to make it conform to their\npractices. This class do not attack the law openly, but put forward\nspeculative theories that undermine its principles. They explain it so[409]\nas to destroy its force.\nThe hypocrisy of the Pharisees was the product of self-seeking.\nThe glorification of themselves was the object of their lives. It was\nthis that led them to pervert and misapply the Scriptures, and blinded\nthem to the purpose of Christ\u2019s mission. This subtle evil even the\ndisciples of Christ were in danger of cherishing. Those who classed\nTrue Sign 355\nthemselves with the followers of Jesus, but who had not left all in\norder to become His disciples, were influenced in a great degree by\nthe reasoning of the Pharisees. They were often vacillating between\nfaith and unbelief, and they did not discern the treasures of wisdom\nhidden in Christ. Even the disciples, though outwardly they had\nleft all for Jesus\u2019 sake, had not in heart ceased to seek great things\nfor themselves. It was this spirit that prompted the strife as to who\nshould be greatest. It was this that came between them and Christ,\nmaking them so little in sympathy with His mission of self-sacrifice,\nso slow to comprehend the mystery of redemption. As leaven, if left\nto complete its work, will cause corruption and decay, so does the\nself-seeking spirit, cherished, work the defilement and ruin of the\nsoul.\nAmong the followers of our Lord today, as of old, how\nwidespread is this subtle, deceptive sin! How often our service\nto Christ, our communion with one another, is marred by the secret\ndesire to exalt self! How ready the thought of self-gratulation, and\nthe longing for human approval! It is the love of self, the desire for\nan easier way than God has appointed that leads to the substitution\nof human theories and traditions for the divine precepts. To His own\ndisciples the warning words of Christ are spoken, \u201cTake heed and\nbeware of the leaven of the Pharisees.\u201d\nThe religion of Christ is sincerity itself. Zeal for God\u2019s glory\nis the motive implanted by the Holy Spirit; and only the effectual\nworking of the Spirit can implant this motive. Only the power of\nGod can banish self-seeking and hypocrisy. This change is the sign\nof His working. When the faith we accept destroys selfishness and\npretense, when it leads us to seek God\u2019s glory and not our own, we\nmay know that it is of the right order. \u201cFather, glorify Thy name\u201d\n(John 12:28), was the keynote of Christ\u2019s life, and if we follow Him,\nthis will be the keynote of our life. He commands us to \u201cwalk, even\nas He walked;\u201d and \u201chereby we do know that we know Him, if we\nkeep His commandments.\u201d 1 John 2:6, 3.\nChapter 45\u2014The Foreshadowing of the Cross[410]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 16:13-28; Mark 8:27-38; Luke\n9:18-27.\nThe work of Christ on earth was hastening to a close. Before\nHim, in vivid outline, lay the scenes whither His feet were tending.\nEven before He took humanity upon Him, He saw the whole length\nof the path He must travel in order to save that which was lost. Every\npang that rent His heart, every insult that was heaped upon His head,\nevery privation that He was called to endure, was open to His view\nbefore He laid aside His crown and royal robe, and stepped down\nfrom the throne, to clothe His divinity with humanity. The path from\nthe manger to Calvary was all before His eyes. He knew the anguish\nthat would come upon Him. He knew it all, and yet He said, \u201cLo, I\ncome: in the volume of the Book it is written of Me, I delight to do\nThy will, O My God: yea, Thy law is within My heart.\u201d Psalm 40:7,\n8.\nEver before Him He saw the result of His mission. His earthly\nlife, so full of toil and self-sacrifice, was cheered by the prospect that\nHe would not have all this travail for nought. By giving His life for\nthe life of men, He would win back the world to its loyalty to God.\nAlthough the baptism of blood must first be received; although the\nsins of the world were to weigh upon His innocent soul; although\nthe shadow of an unspeakable woe was upon Him; yet for the joy\nthat was set before Him, He chose to endure the cross, and despised\nthe shame.\nFrom the chosen companions of His ministry the scenes that lay\nbefore Him were as yet hidden; but the time was near when they\nmust behold His agony. They must see Him whom they had loved[411]\nand trusted, delivered into the hands of His enemies, and hung upon\nthe cross of Calvary. Soon He must leave them to face the world\nwithout the comfort of His visible presence. He knew how bitter\n356\nForeshadowing of the Cross 357\nhate and unbelief would persecute them, and He desired to prepare\nthem for their trials.\nJesus and His disciples had now come into one of the towns\nabout Caesarea Philippi. They were beyond the limits of Galilee, in\na region where idolatry prevailed. Here the disciples were withdrawn\nfrom the controlling influence of Judaism, and brought into closer\ncontact with the heathen worship. Around them were represented\nforms of superstition that existed in all parts of the world. Jesus\ndesired that a view of these things might lead them to feel their\nresponsibility to the heathen. During His stay in this region, He\nendeavored to withdraw from teaching the people, and to devote\nHimself more fully to His disciples.\nHe was about to tell them of the suffering that awaited Him.\nBut first He went away alone, and prayed that their hearts might be\nprepared to receive His words. Upon joining them, He did not at\nonce communicate that which He desired to impart. Before doing\nthis, He gave them an opportunity of confessing their faith in Him\nthat they might be strengthened for the coming trial. He asked,\n\u201cWhom do men say that I the Son of man am?\u201d\nSadly the disciples were forced to acknowledge that Israel had\nfailed to recognize their Messiah. Some indeed, when they saw His\nmiracles, had declared Him to be the Son of David. The multitudes\nthat had been fed at Bethsaida had desired to proclaim Him king of\nIsrael. Many were ready to accept Him as a prophet; but they did\nnot believe Him to be the Messiah.\nJesus now put a second question, relating to the disciples them-\nselves: \u201cBut whom say ye that I am?\u201d Peter answered, \u201cThou art the\nChrist, the Son of the living God.\u201d\nFrom the first, Peter had believed Jesus to be the Messiah. Many\nothers who had been convicted by the preaching of John the Baptist,\nand had accepted Christ, began to doubt as to John\u2019s mission when\nhe was imprisoned and put to death; and they now doubted that\nJesus was the Messiah, for whom they had looked so long. Many\nof the disciples who had ardently expected Jesus to take His place\non David\u2019s throne left Him when they perceived that He had no\nsuch intention. But Peter and his companions turned not from their [412]\nallegiance. The vacillating course of those who praised yesterday\nand condemned today did not destroy the faith of the true follower\n358 The Desire of Ages\nof the Saviour. Peter declared, \u201cThou art the Christ, the Son of the\nliving God.\u201d He waited not for kingly honors to crown his Lord, but\naccepted Him in His humiliation.\nPeter had expressed the faith of the twelve. Yet the disciples\nwere still far from understanding Christ\u2019s mission. The opposition\nand misrepresentation of the priests and rulers, while it could not\nturn them away from Christ, still caused them great perplexity. They\ndid not see their way clearly. The influence of their early training,\nthe teaching of the rabbis, the power of tradition, still intercepted\ntheir view of truth. From time to time precious rays of light from\nJesus shone upon them, yet often they were like men groping among\nshadows. But on this day, before they were brought face to face\nwith the great trial of their faith, the Holy Spirit rested upon them\nin power. For a little time their eyes were turned away from \u201cthe\nthings which are seen,\u201d to behold \u201cthe things which are not seen.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 4:18. Beneath the guise of humanity they discerned the\nglory of the Son of God.\nJesus answered Peter, saying, \u201cBlessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona:\nfor flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father\nwhich is in heaven.\u201d\nThe truth which Peter had confessed is the foundation of the\nbeliever\u2019s faith. It is that which Christ Himself has declared to be\neternal life. But the possession of this knowledge was no ground for\nself-glorification. Through no wisdom or goodness of his own had\nit been revealed to Peter. Never can humanity, of itself, attain to a\nknowledge of the divine. \u201cIt is as high as heaven; what canst thou\ndo? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?\u201d Job 11:8. Only the\nspirit of adoption can reveal to us the deep things of God, which \u201ceye\nhath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of\nman.\u201d \u201cGod hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit\nsearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.\u201d 1 Corinthians 2:9,\n10. \u201cThe secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him;\u201d and the fact\nthat Peter discerned the glory of Christ was an evidence that he had\nbeen \u201ctaught of God.\u201d Psalm 25:14; John 6:45. Ah, indeed, \u201cblessed\nart thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it\nunto thee.\u201d\nJesus continued: \u201cI say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and\nupon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of hell shall\nForeshadowing of the Cross 359\nnot prevail against it.\u201d The word Peter signifies a stone,\u2014a rolling [413]\nstone. Peter was not the rock upon which the church was founded.\nThe gates of hell did prevail against him when he denied his Lord\nwith cursing and swearing. The church was built upon One against\nwhom the gates of hell could not prevail.\nCenturies before the Saviour\u2019s advent Moses had pointed to the\nRock of Israel\u2019s salvation. The psalmist had sung of \u201cthe Rock of my\nstrength.\u201d Isaiah had written, \u201cThus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay\nin Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone,\na sure foundation.\u201d Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 62:7; Isaiah 28:16.\nPeter himself, writing by inspiration, applies this prophecy to Jesus.\nHe says, \u201cIf ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious: unto whom\ncoming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect,\nprecious, ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house.\u201d 1\nPeter 2:3-5, R. V .\n\u201cOther foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is\nJesus Christ.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:11. \u201cUpon this rock,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cI\nwill build My church.\u201d In the presence of God, and all the heavenly\nintelligences, in the presence of the unseen army of hell, Christ\nfounded His church upon the living Rock. That Rock is Himself,\u2014\nHis own body, for us broken and bruised. Against the church built\nupon this foundation, the gates of hell shall not prevail.\nHow feeble the church appeared when Christ spoke these words!\nThere was only a handful of believers, against whom all the power of\ndemons and evil men would be directed; yet the followers of Christ\nwere not to fear. Built upon the Rock of their strength, they could\nnot be overthrown.\nFor six thousand years, faith has builded upon Christ. For six\nthousand years the floods and tempests of satanic wrath have beaten\nupon the Rock of our salvation; but it stands unmoved.\nPeter had expressed the truth which is the foundation of the\nchurch\u2019s faith, and Jesus now honored him as the representative of\nthe whole body of believers. He said, \u201cI will give unto thee the keys\nof the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth\nshall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth\nshall be loosed in heaven.\u201d\n\u201cThe keys of the kingdom of heaven\u201d are the words of Christ. All\nthe words of Holy Scripture are His, and are here included. These\n360 The Desire of Ages\nwords have power to open and to shut heaven. They declare the\nconditions upon which men are received or rejected. Thus the work[414]\nof those who preach God\u2019s word is a savor of life unto life or of\ndeath unto death. Theirs is a mission weighted with eternal results.\nThe Saviour did not commit the work of the gospel to Peter\nindividually. At a later time, repeating the words that were spoken\nto Peter, He applied them directly to the church. And the same in\nsubstance was spoken also to the twelve as representatives of the\nbody of believers. If Jesus had delegated any special authority to\none of the disciples above the others, we should not find them so\noften contending as to who should be the greatest. They would have\nsubmitted to the wish of their Master, and honored the one whom\nHe had chosen.\nInstead of appointing one to be their head, Christ said to the\ndisciples, \u201cBe not ye called Rabbi;\u201d \u201cneither be ye called masters:\nfor one is your Master, even Christ.\u201d Matthew 23:8, 10.\n\u201cThe head of every man is Christ.\u201d God, who put all things under\nthe Saviour\u2019s feet, \u201cgave Him to be the head over all things to the\nchurch, which is His body, the fullness of Him that filleth all in all.\u201d\n1 Corinthians 11:3; Ephesians 1:22, 23. The church is built upon\nChrist as its foundation; it is to obey Christ as its head. It is not\nto depend upon man, or be controlled by man. Many claim that a\nposition of trust in the church gives them authority to dictate what\nother men shall believe and what they shall do. This claim God\ndoes not sanction. The Saviour declares, \u201cAll ye are brethren.\u201d All\nare exposed to temptation, and are liable to error. Upon no finite\nbeing can we depend for guidance. The Rock of faith is the living\npresence of Christ in the church. Upon this the weakest may depend,\nand those who think themselves the strongest will prove to be the\nweakest, unless they make Christ their efficiency. \u201cCursed be the\nman that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm.\u201d The Lord \u201cis\nthe Rock, His work is perfect.\u201d \u201cBlessed are all they that put their\ntrust in Him.\u201d Jeremiah 17:5; Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 2:12.\nAfter Peter\u2019s confession, Jesus charged the disciples to tell no\nman that He was the Christ. This charge was given because of the\ndetermined opposition of the scribes and Pharisees. More than this,\nthe people, and even the disciples, had so false a conception of the\nMessiah that a public announcement of Him would give them no true\nForeshadowing of the Cross 361\nidea of His character or His work. But day by day He was revealing\nHimself to them as the Saviour, and thus He desired to give them a\ntrue conception of Him as the Messiah.\nThe disciples still expected Christ to reign as a temporal prince. [415]\nAlthough He had so long concealed His design, they believed that\nHe would not always remain in poverty and obscurity; the time was\nnear when He would establish His kingdom. That the hatred of the\npriests and rabbis would never be overcome, that Christ would be\nrejected by His own nation, condemned as a deceiver, and crucified\nas a malefactor,\u2014such a thought the disciples had never entertained.\nBut the hour of the power of darkness was drawing on, and Jesus\nmust open to His disciples the conflict before them. He was sad as\nHe anticipated the trial.\nHitherto He had refrained from making known to them anything\nrelative to His sufferings and death. In His conversation with Nicode-\nmus He had said, \u201cAs Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,\neven so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth\nin Him should not perish, but have eternal life.\u201d John 3:14, 15. But\nthe disciples did not hear this, and had they heard, would not have\nunderstood. But now they have been with Jesus, listening to His\nwords, beholding His works, until, notwithstanding the humility of\nHis surroundings, and the opposition of priests and people, they can\njoin in the testimony of Peter, \u201cThou art the Christ, the Son of the\nliving God.\u201d Now the time has come for the veil that hides the future\nto be withdrawn. \u201cFrom that time forth began Jesus to show unto\nHis disciples, how that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many\nthings of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and\nbe raised again the third day.\u201d\nSpeechless with grief and amazement, the disciples listened.\nChrist had accepted Peter\u2019s acknowledgment of Him as the Son\nof God; and now His words pointing to His suffering and death\nseemed incomprehensible. Peter could not keep silent. He laid hold\nupon his Master, as if to draw Him back from His impending doom,\nexclaiming, \u201cBe it far from Thee, Lord: this shall not be unto Thee.\u201d\nPeter loved his Lord; but Jesus did not commend him for thus\nmanifesting the desire to shield Him from suffering. Peter\u2019s words\nwere not such as would be a help and solace to Jesus in the great\ntrial before Him. They were not in harmony with God\u2019s purpose\n362 The Desire of Ages\nof grace toward a lost world, nor with the lesson of self-sacrifice\nthat Jesus had come to teach by His own example. Peter did not\ndesire to see the cross in the work of Christ. The impression which\nhis words would make was directly opposed to that which Christ\ndesired to make on the minds of His followers, and the Saviour was\nmoved to utter one of the sternest rebukes that ever fell from His lips:[416]\n\u201cGet thee behind Me, Satan: thou art an offense unto Me: for thou\nsavorest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.\u201d\nSatan was trying to discourage Jesus, and turn Him from His\nmission; and Peter, in his blind love, was giving voice to the tempta-\ntion. The prince of evil was the author of the thought. His instigation\nwas behind that impulsive appeal. In the wilderness, Satan had of-\nfered Christ the dominion of the world on condition of forsaking\nthe path of humiliation and sacrifice. Now he was presenting the\nsame temptation to the disciple of Christ. He was seeking to fix\nPeter\u2019s gaze upon the earthly glory, that he might not behold the\ncross to which Jesus desired to turn his eyes. And through Peter,\nSatan was again pressing the temptation upon Jesus. But the Saviour\nheeded it not; His thought was for His disciple. Satan had interposed\nbetween Peter and his Master, that the heart of the disciple might not\nbe touched at the vision of Christ\u2019s humiliation for him. The words\nof Christ were spoken, not to Peter, but to the one who was trying to\nseparate him from his Redeemer. \u201cGet thee behind Me, Satan.\u201d No\nlonger interpose between Me and My erring servant. Let Me come\nface to face with Peter, that I may reveal to him the mystery of My\nlove.\nIt was to Peter a bitter lesson, and one which he learned but\nslowly, that the path of Christ on earth lay through agony and hu-\nmiliation. The disciple shrank from fellowship with his Lord in\nsuffering. But in the heat of the furnace fire he was to learn its\nblessing. Long afterward, when his active form was bowed with the\nburden of years and labors, he wrote, \u201cBeloved, think it not strange\nconcerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange\nthing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers\nof Christ\u2019s sufferings; that, when His glory shall be revealed, ye may\nbe glad also with exceeding joy.\u201d 1 Peter 4:12, 13.\nJesus now explained to His disciples that His own life of self-\nabnegation was an example of what theirs should be. Calling about\nForeshadowing of the Cross 363\nHim, with the disciples, the people who had been lingering near,\nHe said, \u201cIf any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and\ntake up his cross daily, and follow Me.\u201d The cross was associated\nwith the power of Rome. It was the instrument of the most cruel\nand humiliating form of death. The lowest criminals were required\nto bear the cross to the place of execution; and often as it was\nabout to be laid upon their shoulders, they resisted with desperate\nviolence, until they were overpowered, and the instrument of torture [417]\nwas bound upon them. But Jesus bade His followers take up the\ncross and bear it after Him. To the disciples His words, though\ndimly comprehended, pointed to their submission to the most bitter\nhumiliation,\u2014submission even unto death for the sake of Christ.\nNo more complete self-surrender could the Saviour\u2019s words have\npictured. But all this He had accepted for them. Jesus did not count\nheaven a place to be desired while we were lost. He left the heavenly\ncourts for a life of reproach and insult, and a death of shame. He who\nwas rich in heaven\u2019s priceless treasure, became poor, that through\nHis poverty we might be rich. We are to follow in the path He trod.\nLove for souls for whom Christ died means crucifixion of self.\nHe who is a child of God should henceforth look upon himself as\na link in the chain let down to save the world, one with Christ in\nHis plan of mercy, going forth with Him to seek and save the lost.\nThe Christian is ever to realize that he has consecrated himself to\nGod, and that in character he is to reveal Christ to the world. The\nself-sacrifice, the sympathy, the love, manifested in the life of Christ\nare to reappear in the life of the worker for God.\n\u201cWhosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall\nlose his life for My sake and the gospel\u2019s, the same shall save it.\u201d\nSelfishness is death. No organ of the body could live should it\nconfine its service to itself. The heart, failing to send its lifeblood\nto the hand and the head, would quickly lose its power. As our\nlifeblood, so is the love of Christ diffused through every part of His\nmystical body. We are members one of another, and the soul that\nrefuses to impart will perish. And \u201cwhat is a man profited,\u201d said\nJesus, \u201cif he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or\nwhat shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d\nBeyond the poverty and humiliation of the present, He pointed\nthe disciples to His coming in glory, not in the splendor of an earthly\n364 The Desire of Ages\nthrone, but with the glory of God and the hosts of heaven. And then,\nHe said, \u201cHe shall reward every man according to his works.\u201d Then\nfor their encouragement He gave the promise, \u201cVerily I say unto\nyou, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till\nthey see the Son of man coming in His kingdom.\u201d But the disciples\ndid not comprehend His words. The glory seemed far away. Their\neyes were fixed upon the nearer view, the earthly life of poverty,\nhumiliation, and suffering. Must their glowing expectations of the\nMessiah\u2019s kingdom be relinquished? Were they not to see their Lord\nexalted to the throne of David? Could it be that Christ was to live[418]\na humble, homeless wanderer, to be despised, rejected, and put to\ndeath? Sadness oppressed their hearts, for they loved their Master.\nDoubt also harassed their minds, for it seemed incomprehensible\nthat the Son of God should be subjected to such cruel humiliation.\nThey questioned why He should voluntarily go to Jerusalem to meet\nthe treatment which He had told them He was there to receive. How\ncould He resign Himself to such a fate, and leave them in greater\ndarkness than that in which they were groping before He revealed\nHimself to them?\nIn the region of Caesarea Philippi, Christ was out of the reach\nof Herod and Caiaphas, the disciples reasoned. He had nothing to\nfear from the hatred of the Jews or from the power of the Romans.\nWhy not work there, at a distance from the Pharisees? Why need\nHe give Himself up to death? If He was to die, how was it that His\nkingdom was to be established so firmly that the gates of hell should\nnot prevail against it? To the disciples this was indeed a mystery.\nThey were even now journeying along the shores of the Sea of\nGalilee toward the city where all their hopes were to be crushed.\nThey dared not remonstrate with Christ, but they talked together in\nlow, sorrowful tones in regard to what the future would be. Even\namid their questionings they clung to the thought that some unfore-\nseen circumstance might avert the doom which seemed to await their\nLord. Thus they sorrowed and doubted, hoped and feared, for six\nlong, gloomy days.\nChapter 46\u2014He Was Transfigured [419]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 17:1-8; Mark 9:2-8; Luke\n9:28-36.\nEvening is drawing on as Jesus calls to His side three of His\ndisciples, Peter, James, and John, and leads them across the fields,\nand far up a rugged path, to a lonely mountainside. The Saviour and\nHis disciples have spent the day in traveling and teaching, and the\nmountain climb adds to their weariness. Christ has lifted burdens\nfrom mind and body of many sufferers; He has sent the thrill of\nlife through their enfeebled frames; but He also is compassed with\nhumanity, and with His disciples He is wearied with the ascent.\nThe light of the setting sun still lingers on the mountain top,\nand gilds with its fading glory the path they are traveling. But soon\nthe light dies out from hill as well as valley, the sun disappears\nbehind the western horizon, and the solitary travelers are wrapped\nin the darkness of night. The gloom of their surroundings seems\nin harmony with their sorrowful lives, around which the clouds are\ngathering and thickening.\nThe disciples do not venture to ask Christ whither He is going, or\nfor what purpose. He has often spent entire nights in the mountains\nin prayer. He whose hand formed mountain and valley is at home\nwith nature, and enjoys its quietude. The disciples follow where\nChrist leads the way; yet they wonder why their Master should lead\nthem up this toilsome ascent when they are weary, and when He too\nis in need of rest.\nPresently Christ tells them that they are now to go no farther.\nStepping a little aside from them, the Man of Sorrows pours out His\nsupplications with strong crying and tears. He prays for strength to [420]\nendure the test in behalf of humanity. He must Himself gain a fresh\nhold on Omnipotence, for only thus can He contemplate the future.\nAnd He pours out His heart longings for His disciples, that in the\nhour of the power of darkness their faith may not fail. The dew is\n365\n366 The Desire of Ages\nheavy upon His bowed form, but He heeds it not. The shadows of\nnight gather thickly about Him, but He regards not their gloom. So\nthe hours pass slowly by. At first the disciples unite their prayers\nwith His in sincere devotion; but after a time they are overcome\nwith weariness, and, even while trying to retain their interest in the\nscene, they fall asleep. Jesus has told them of His sufferings; He has\ntaken them with Him that they might unite with Him in prayer; even\nnow He is praying for them. The Saviour has seen the gloom of\nHis disciples, and has longed to lighten their grief by an assurance\nthat their faith has not been in vain. Not all, even of the twelve, can\nreceive the revelation He desires to give. Only the three who are\nto witness His anguish in Gethsemane have been chosen to be with\nHim on the mount. Now the burden of His prayer is that they may be\ngiven a manifestation of the glory He had with the Father before the[421]\nworld was, that His kingdom may be revealed to human eyes, and\nthat His disciples may be strengthened to behold it. He pleads that\nthey may witness a manifestation of His divinity that will comfort\nthem in the hour of His supreme agony with the knowledge that He\nis of a surety the Son of God and that His shameful death is a part of\nthe plan of redemption.\nHis prayer is heard. While He is bowed in lowliness upon the\nstony ground, suddenly the heavens open, the golden gates of the\ncity of God are thrown wide, and holy radiance descends upon the\nmount, enshrouding the Saviour\u2019s form. Divinity from within flashes\nthrough humanity, and meets the glory coming from above. Arising\nfrom His prostrate position, Christ stands in godlike majesty. The\nsoul agony is gone. His countenance now shines \u201cas the sun,\u201d and\nHis garments are \u201cwhite as the light.\u201d\nThe disciples, awaking, behold the flood of glory that illuminates\nthe mount. In fear and amazement they gaze upon the radiant form\nof their Master. As they become able to endure the wondrous light,\nthey see that Jesus is not alone. Beside Him are two heavenly beings,\nin close converse with Him. They are Moses, who upon Sinai had\ntalked with God; and Elijah, to whom the high privilege was given\u2014\ngranted to but one other of the sons of Adam\u2014never to come under\nthe power of death.\nUpon Mount Pisgah fifteen centuries before, Moses had stood\ngazing upon the Land of Promise. But because of his sin at Meribah,\nHe Was Transfigured 367\nit was not for him to enter there. Not for him was the joy of leading\nthe host of Israel into the inheritance of their fathers. His agonized\nentreaty, \u201cI pray Thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is\nbeyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon\u201d (Deuteronomy\n3:25), was refused. The hope that for forty years had lighted up the\ndarkness of the desert wanderings must be denied. A wilderness\ngrave was the goal of those years of toil and heart-burdening care.\nBut He who is \u201cable to do exceeding abundantly above all that we\nask or think\u201d (Ephesians 3:20), had in this measure answered His\nservant\u2019s prayer. Moses passed under the dominion of death, but\nhe was not to remain in the tomb. Christ Himself called him forth\nto life. Satan the tempter had claimed the body of Moses because\nof his sin; but Christ the Saviour brought him forth from the grave.\nJude 9.\nMoses upon the mount of transfiguration was a witness to\nChrist\u2019s victory over sin and death. He represented those who shall\ncome forth from the grave at the resurrection of the just. Elijah, [422]\nwho had been translated to heaven without seeing death, represented\nthose who will be living upon the earth at Christ\u2019s second coming,\nand who will be \u201cchanged, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,\nat the last trump;\u201d when \u201cthis mortal must put on immortality,\u201d and\n\u201cthis corruptible must put on incorruption.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:51-53.\nJesus was clothed with the light of heaven, as He will appear when\nHe shall come \u201cthe second time without sin unto salvation.\u201d For He\nwill come \u201cin the glory of His Father with the holy angels.\u201d Hebrews\n9:28; Mark 8:38. The Saviour\u2019s promise to the disciples was now\nfulfilled. Upon the mount the future kingdom of glory was repre-\nsented in miniature,\u2014Christ the King, Moses a representative of the\nrisen saints, and Elijah of the translated ones.\nThe disciples do not yet comprehend the scene; but they rejoice\nthat the patient Teacher, the meek and lowly One, who has wandered\nto and fro a helpless stranger, is honored by the favored ones of\nheaven. They believe that Elijah has come to announce the Messiah\u2019s\nreign, and that the kingdom of Christ is about to be set up on the\nearth. The memory of their fear and disappointment they would\nbanish forever. Here, where the glory of God is revealed, they long\nto tarry. Peter exclaims, \u201cMaster, it is good for us to be here: and let\nus make three tabernacles; one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one\n368 The Desire of Ages\nfor Elias.\u201d The disciples are confident that Moses and Elijah have\nbeen sent to protect their Master, and to establish His authority as\nking.\nBut before the crown must come the cross. Not the inauguration\nof Christ as king, but the decease to be accomplished at Jerusalem,\nis the subject of their conference with Jesus. Bearing the weakness\nof humanity, and burdened with its sorrow and sin, Jesus walked\nalone in the midst of men. As the darkness of the coming trial\npressed upon Him, He was in loneliness of spirit, in a world that\nknew Him not. Even His loved disciples, absorbed in their own\ndoubt and sorrow and ambitious hopes, had not comprehended the\nmystery of His mission. He had dwelt amid the love and fellowship\nof heaven; but in the world that He had created, He was in solitude.\nNow heaven had sent its messengers to Jesus; not angels, but men\nwho had endured suffering and sorrow, and who could sympathize\nwith the Saviour in the trial of His earthly life. Moses and Elijah\nhad been colaborers with Christ. They had shared His longing for\nthe salvation of men. Moses had pleaded for Israel: \u201cYet now, if\nThou wilt forgive their sin\u2014; and if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out\nof Thy book which Thou hast written.\u201d Exodus 32:32. Elijah had[423]\n[424]\n[425]\nknown loneliness of spirit, as for three years and a half of famine\nhe had borne the burden of the nation\u2019s hatred and its woe. Alone\nhe had stood for God upon Mount Carmel. Alone he had fled to the\ndesert in anguish and despair. These men, chosen above every angel\naround the throne, had come to commune with Jesus concerning the\nscenes of His suffering, and to comfort Him with the assurance of\nthe sympathy of heaven. The hope of the world, the salvation of\nevery human being, was the burden of their interview.\nThrough being overcome with sleep, the disciples heard little of\nwhat passed between Christ and the heavenly messengers. Failing\nto watch and pray, they had not received that which God desired to\ngive them,\u2014a knowledge of the sufferings of Christ, and the glory\nthat should follow. They lost the blessing that might have been theirs\nthrough sharing His self-sacrifice. Slow of heart to believe were\nthese disciples, little appreciative of the treasure with which Heaven\nsought to enrich them.\nYet they received great light. They were assured that all heaven\nknew of the sin of the Jewish nation in rejecting Christ. They were\nHe Was Transfigured 369\ngiven a clearer insight into the work of the Redeemer. They saw\nwith their eyes and heard with their ears things that were beyond the\ncomprehension of man. They were \u201ceyewitnesses of His majesty\u201d\n(2 Peter 1:16), and they realized that Jesus was indeed the Messiah,\nto whom patriarchs and prophets had witnessed, and that He was\nrecognized as such by the heavenly universe.\nWhile they were still gazing on the scene upon the mount, \u201ca\nbright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the\ncloud, which said, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well\npleased; hear ye Him.\u201d As they beheld the cloud of glory, brighter\nthan that which went before the tribes of Israel in the wilderness;\nas they heard the voice of God speak in awful majesty that caused\nthe mountain to tremble, the disciples fell smitten to the earth. They\nremained prostrate, their faces hidden, till Jesus came near, and\ntouched them, dispelling their fears with His well-known voice,\n\u201cArise, and be not afraid.\u201d Venturing to lift up their eyes, they saw\nthat the heavenly glory had passed away, the forms of Moses and\nElijah had disappeared. They were upon the mount, alone with\nJesus.\nChapter 47\u2014Ministry[426]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 17:9-21; Mark 9:9-29; Luke\n9:37-45.\nThe entire night had been passed in the mountain; and as the\nsun arose, Jesus and His disciples descended to the plain. Absorbed\nin thought, the disciples were awed and silent. Even Peter had not\na word to say. Gladly would they have lingered in that holy place\nwhich had been touched with the light of heaven, and where the Son\nof God had manifested His glory; but there was work to be done for\nthe people, who were already searching far and near for Jesus.\nAt the foot of the mountain a large company had gathered, led\nhither by the disciples who had remained behind, but who knew\nwhither Jesus had resorted. As the Saviour drew near, He charged\nHis three companions to keep silence concerning what they had\nwitnessed, saying, \u201cTell the vision to no man, until the Son of\nman be risen again from the dead.\u201d The revelation made to the\ndisciples was to be pondered in their own hearts, not to be published\nabroad. To relate it to the multitudes would excite only ridicule\nor idle wonder. And even the nine apostles would not understand\nthe scene until after Christ had risen from the dead. How slow of\ncomprehension even the three favored disciples were, is seen in the\nfact that notwithstanding all that Christ had said of what was before\nHim, they queried among themselves what the rising from the dead\nshould mean. Yet they asked no explanation from Jesus. His words[427]\nin regard to the future had filled them with sorrow; they sought no\nfurther revelation concerning that which they were fain to believe\nmight never come to pass.\nAs the people on the plain caught sight of Jesus, they ran to meet\nHim, greeting Him with expressions of reverence and joy. Yet His\nquick eye discerned that they were in great perplexity. The disciples\nappeared troubled. A circumstance had just occurred that had caused\nthem bitter disappointment and humiliation.\n370\nMinistry 371\nWhile they were waiting at the foot of the mountain, a father\nhad brought to them his son, to be delivered from a dumb spirit\nthat tormented him. Authority over unclean spirits, to cast them\nout, had been conferred on the disciples when Jesus sent out the\ntwelve to preach through Galilee. As they went forth strong in faith,\nthe evil spirits had obeyed their word. Now in the name of Christ\nthey commanded the torturing spirit to leave his victim; but the\ndemon only mocked them by a fresh display of his power. The\ndisciples, unable to account for their defeat, felt that they were\nbringing dishonor upon themselves and their Master. And in the\ncrowd there were scribes who made the most of this opportunity to\nhumiliate them. Pressing around the disciples, they plied them with\nquestions, seeking to prove that they and their Master were deceivers.\nHere, the rabbis triumphantly declared, was an evil spirit that neither\nthe disciples nor Christ Himself could conquer. The people were\ninclined to side with the scribes, and a feeling of contempt and scorn\npervaded the crowd.\nBut suddenly the accusations ceased. Jesus and the three disci-\nples were seen approaching, and with a quick revulsion of feeling\nthe people turned to meet them. The night of communion with the\nheavenly glory had left its trace upon the Saviour and His compan-\nions. Upon their countenances was a light that awed the beholders.\nThe scribes drew back in fear, while the people welcomed Jesus.\nAs if He had been a witness of all that had occurred, the Saviour\ncame to the scene of conflict, and fixing His gaze upon the scribes\ninquired, \u201cWhat question ye with them?\u201d\nBut the voices so bold and defiant before were now silent. A\nhush had fallen upon the entire company. Now the afflicted father\nmade his way through the crowd, and falling at the feet of Jesus,\npoured out the story of his trouble and disappointment.\n\u201cMaster,\u201d he said, \u201cI have brought unto Thee my son, which hath [428]\na dumb spirit; and wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: ...\nand I spake to Thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they\ncould not.\u201d\nJesus looked about Him upon the awe-stricken multitude, the\ncaviling scribes, the perplexed disciples. He read the unbelief in\nevery heart; and in a voice filled with sorrow He exclaimed, \u201cO\nfaithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall\n372 The Desire of Ages\nI suffer you?\u201d Then He bade the distressed father, \u201cBring thy son\nhither.\u201d\nThe boy was brought, and as the Saviour\u2019s eyes fell upon him,\nthe evil spirit cast him to the ground in convulsions of agony. He lay\nwallowing and foaming, rending the air with unearthly shrieks.\nAgain the Prince of life and the prince of the powers of darkness\nhad met on the field of battle,\u2014Christ in fulfillment of His mission\nto \u201cpreach deliverance to the captives, ... to set at liberty them that\nare bruised\u201d (Luke 4:18), Satan seeking to hold his victim under\nhis control. Angels of light and the hosts of evil angels, unseen,\nwere pressing near to behold the conflict. For a moment, Jesus\npermitted the evil spirit to display his power, that the beholders\nmight comprehend the deliverance about to be wrought.\nThe multitude looked on with bated breath, the father in an agony\nof hope and fear. Jesus asked, \u201cHow long is it ago since this came\nunto him?\u201d The father told the story of long years of suffering, and\nthen, as if he could endure no more, exclaimed, \u201cIf Thou canst do\nanything, have compassion on us, and help us.\u201d \u201cIf Thou canst!\u201d\nEven now the father questioned the power of Christ.\nJesus answers, \u201cIf thou canst believe, all things are possible\nto him that believeth.\u201d There is no lack of power on the part of\nChrist; the healing of the son depends upon the father\u2019s faith. With\na burst of tears, realizing his own weakness, the father casts himself\nupon Christ\u2019s mercy, with the cry, \u201cLord, I believe; help Thou mine\nunbelief.\u201d\nJesus turns to the suffering one, and says, \u201cThou dumb and deaf\nspirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.\u201d\nThere is a cry, an agonized struggle. The demon, in passing, seems\nabout to rend the life from his victim. Then the boy lies motionless,\nand apparently lifeless. The multitude whisper, \u201cHe is dead.\u201d But\nJesus takes him by the hand, and lifting him up, presents him, in\nperfect soundness of mind and body, to his father. Father and son\npraise the name of their Deliverer. The multitude are \u201camazed at the[429]\nmighty power of God,\u201d while the scribes, defeated and crestfallen,\nturn sullenly away.\n\u201cIf Thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help\nus.\u201d How many a sin-burdened soul has echoed that prayer. And\nto all, the pitying Saviour\u2019s answer is, \u201cIf thou canst believe, all\nMinistry 373\nthings are possible to him that believeth.\u201d It is faith that connects\nus with heaven, and brings us strength for coping with the powers\nof darkness. In Christ, God has provided means for subduing every\nsinful trait, and resisting every temptation, however strong. But many\nfeel that they lack faith, and therefore they remain away from Christ.\nLet these souls, in their helpless unworthiness, cast themselves upon\nthe mercy of their compassionate Saviour. Look not to self, but to\nChrist. He who healed the sick and cast out demons when He walked\namong men is the same mighty Redeemer today. Faith comes by the\nword of God. Then grasp His promise, \u201cHim that cometh to Me I\nwill in no wise cast out.\u201d John 6:37. Cast yourself at His feet with\nthe cry, \u201cLord, I believe; helpThou mine unbelief.\u201d You can never\nperish while you do this\u2014never.\nIn a brief space of time the favored disciples have beheld the\nextreme of glory and of humiliation. They have seen humanity as\ntransfigured into the image of God, and as debased into the like-\nness of Satan. From the mountain where He has talked with the\nheavenly messengers, and has been proclaimed the Son of God by\nthe voice from the radiant glory, they have seen Jesus descend to\nmeet that most distressing and revolting spectacle, the maniac boy,\nwith distorted countenance, gnashing his teeth in spasms of agony\nthat no human power could relieve. And this mighty Redeemer,\nwho but a few hours before stood glorified before His wondering\ndisciples, stoops to lift the victim of Satan from the earth where he\nis wallowing, and in health of mind and body restores him to his\nfather and his home.\nIt was an object lesson of redemption,\u2014the Divine One from\nthe Father\u2019s glory stooping to save the lost. It represented also the\ndisciples\u2019 mission. Not alone upon the mountaintop with Jesus, in\nhours of spiritual illumination, is the life of Christ\u2019s servants to be\nspent. There is work for them down in the plain. Souls whom Satan\nhas enslaved are waiting for the word of faith and prayer to set them\nfree.\nThe nine disciples were yet pondering upon the bitter fact of\ntheir own failure; and when Jesus was once more alone with them,\nthey questioned, \u201cWhy could not we cast him out?\u201d Jesus answered\nthem, \u201cBecause of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye [430]\nhave faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain,\n374 The Desire of Ages\nRemove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing\nshall be impossible unto you. Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by\nprayer and fasting.\u201d Their unbelief, that shut them out from deeper\nsympathy with Christ, and the carelessness with which they regarded[431]\nthe sacred work committed to them, had caused their failure in the\nconflict with the powers of darkness.\nThe words of Christ pointing to His death had brought sadness\nand doubt. And the selection of the three disciples to accompany\nJesus to the mountain had excited the jealousy of the nine. Instead\nof strengthening their faith by prayer and meditation on the words\nof Christ, they had been dwelling on their discouragements and\npersonal grievances. In this state of darkness they had undertaken\nthe conflict with Satan.\nIn order to succeed in such a conflict they must come to the work\nin a different spirit. Their faith must be strengthened by fervent\nprayer and fasting, and humiliation of heart. They must be emptied\nof self, and be filled with the Spirit and power of God. Earnest,\npersevering supplication to God in faith\u2014faith that leads to entire\ndependence upon God, and unreserved consecration to His work\u2014\ncan alone avail to bring men the Holy Spirit\u2019s aid in the battle against\nprincipalities and powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world,\nand wicked spirits in high places.\n\u201cIf ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cye shall\nsay unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall\nremove.\u201d Though the grain of mustard seed is so small, it contains\nthat same mysterious life principle which produces growth in the\nloftiest tree. When the mustard seed is cast into the ground, the\ntiny germ lays hold of every element that God has provided for its\nnutriment, and it speedily develops a sturdy growth. If you have faith\nlike this, you will lay hold upon God\u2019s word, and upon all the helpful\nagencies He has appointed. Thus your faith will strengthen, and will\nbring to your aid the power of heaven. The obstacles that are piled by\nSatan across your path, though apparently as insurmountable as the\neternal hills, shall disappear before the demand of faith. \u201cNothing\nshall be impossible unto you.\u201d\nChapter 48\u2014Who Is the Greatest? [432]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 17:22-27; Matthew 18:1-20;\nMark 9:30-50; Luke 9:46-48.\nOn returning to Capernaum, Jesus did not repair to the well-\nknown resorts where He had taught the people, but with His disciples\nquietly sought the house that was to be His temporary home. During\nthe remainder of His stay in Galilee it was His object to instruct the\ndisciples rather than to labor for the multitudes.\nOn the journey through Galilee, Christ had again tried to prepare\nthe minds of His disciples for the scenes before Him. He told them\nthat He was to go up to Jerusalem to be put to death and to rise again.\nAnd He added the strange and solemn announcement that He was to\nbe betrayed into the hands of His enemies. The disciples did not even\nnow comprehend His words. Although the shadow of a great sorrow\nfell upon them, a spirit of rivalry found a place in their hearts. They\ndisputed among themselves which should be accounted greatest in\nthe kingdom. This strife they thought to conceal from Jesus, and\nthey did not, as usual, press close to His side, but loitered behind, so\nthat He was in advance of them as they entered Capernaum. Jesus\nread their thoughts, and He longed to counsel and instruct them. But\nfor this He awaited a quiet hour, when their hearts should be open to\nreceive His words.\nSoon after they reached the town, the collector of the temple\nrevenue came to Peter with the question, \u201cDoth not your Master pay\ntribute?\u201d This tribute was not a civil tax, but a religious contribution, [433]\nwhich every Jew was required to pay annually for the support of the\ntemple. A refusal to pay the tribute would be regarded as disloyalty\nto the temple,\u2014in the estimation of the rabbis a most grievous sin.\nThe Saviour\u2019s attitude toward the rabbinical laws, and His plain\nreproofs to the defenders of tradition, afforded a pretext for the\ncharge that He was seeking to overthrow the temple service. Now\n375\n376 The Desire of Ages\nHis enemies saw an opportunity of casting discredit upon Him. In\nthe collector of the tribute they found a ready ally.\nPeter saw in the collector\u2019s question an insinuation touching\nChrist\u2019s loyalty to the temple. Zealous for his Master\u2019s honor, he\nhastily answered, without consulting Him, that Jesus would pay the\ntribute.\nBut Peter only partially comprehended the purpose of his ques-\ntioner. There were some classes who were held to be exempt from\nthe payment of the tribute. In the time of Moses, when the Levites\nwere set apart for the service of the sanctuary, they were given no\ninheritance among the people. The Lord said, \u201cLevi hath no part nor\ninheritance with his brethren; the Lord is his inheritance.\u201d Deuteron-\nomy 10:9. In the days of Christ the priests and Levites were still\nregarded as especially devoted to the temple, and were not required\nto make the annual contribution for its support. Prophets also were\nexempted from this payment. In requiring the tribute from Jesus, the\nrabbis were setting aside His claim as a prophet or teacher, and were\ndealing with Him as with any commonplace person. A refusal on\nHis part to pay the tribute would be represented as disloyalty to the\ntemple; while, on the other hand, the payment of it would be taken\nas justifying their rejection of Him as a prophet.\nOnly a little before, Peter had acknowledged Jesus as the Son of\nGod; but he now missed an opportunity of setting forth the character\nof his Master. By his answer to the collector, that Jesus would pay\nthe tribute, he had virtually sanctioned the false conception of Him\nto which the priests and rulers were trying to give currency.\nWhen Peter entered the house, the Saviour made no reference to\nwhat had taken place, but inquired, \u201cWhat thinkest thou, Simon? of\nwhom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own\nchildren, or of strangers?\u201d Peter answered, \u201cOf strangers.\u201d And Jesus\nsaid, \u201cThen are the children free.\u201d While the people of a country are\ntaxed for the maintenance of their king, the monarch\u2019s own children\nare exempt. So Israel, the professed people of God, were required\nto maintain His service; but Jesus, the Son of God, was under no[434]\nsuch obligation. If priests and Levites were exempt because of their\nconnection with the temple, how much more He to whom the temple\nwas His Father\u2019s house.\nWho Is the Greatest? 377\nIf Jesus had paid the tribute without a protest, He would virtually\nhave acknowledged the justice of the claim, and would thus have\ndenied His divinity. But while He saw good to meet the demand,\nHe denied the claim upon which it was based. In providing for the\npayment of the tribute He gave evidence of His divine character. It\nwas made manifest that He was one with God, and therefore was\nnot under tribute as a mere subject of the kingdom.\n\u201cGo thou to the sea,\u201d He directed Peter, \u201cand cast an hook, and\ntake up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his\nmouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto\nthem for Me and thee.\u201d\nThough He had clothed His divinity with humanity, in this mir-\nacle He revealed His glory. It was evident that this was He who\nthrough David had declared, \u201cEvery beast of the forest is Mine, and\nthe cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the moun-\ntains; and the wild beasts of the field are Mine. If I were hungry, I\nwould not tell thee: for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof.\u201d\nPsalm 50:10-12.\nWhile Jesus made it plain that He was under no obligation to pay\nthe tribute, He entered into no controversy with the Jews in regard to\nthe matter; for they would have misinterpreted His words, and turned\nthem against Him. Lest He should give offense by withholding the\ntribute, He did that which He could not justly be required to do. This\nlesson would be of great value to His disciples. Marked changes\nwere soon to take place in their relation to the temple service, and\nChrist taught them not to place themselves needlessly in antagonism\nto established order. So far as possible, they were to avoid giving\noccasion for misinterpretation of their faith. While Christians are\nnot to sacrifice one principle of truth, they should avoid controversy\nwhenever it is possible to do so.\nWhen Christ and the disciples were alone in the house, while\nPeter was gone to the sea, Jesus called the others to Him, and asked,\n\u201cWhat was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?\u201d The\npresence of Jesus, and His question, put the matter in an entirely\ndifferent light from that in which it had appeared to them while they\nwere contending by the way. Shame and self-condemnation kept [435]\nthem silent. Jesus had told them that He was to die for their sake,\n378 The Desire of Ages\nand their selfish ambition was in painful contrast to His unselfish\nlove.\nWhen Jesus told them that He was to be put to death and to rise\nagain, He was trying to draw them into conversation in regard to\nthe great test of their faith. Had they been ready to receive what He\ndesired to make known to them, they would have been saved bitter\nanguish and despair. His words would have brought consolation\nin the hour of bereavement and disappointment. But although He\nhad spoken so plainly of what awaited Him, His mention of the fact\nthat He was soon to go to Jerusalem again kindled their hope that\nthe kingdom was about to be set up. This had led to questioning\nas to who should fill the highest offices. On Peter\u2019s return from\nthe sea, the disciples told him of the Saviour\u2019s question, and at last\none ventured to ask Jesus, \u201cWho is the greatest in the kingdom of\nheaven?\u201d\nThe Saviour gathered His disciples about Him, and said to them,\n\u201cIf any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant\nof all.\u201d There was in these words a solemnity and impressiveness\nwhich the disciples were far from comprehending. That which Christ\ndiscerned they could not see. They did not understand the nature of\nChrist\u2019s kingdom, and this ignorance was the apparent cause of their\ncontention. But the real cause lay deeper. By explaining the nature\nof the kingdom, Christ might for the time have quelled their strife;\nbut this would not have touched the underlying cause. Even after\nthey had received the fullest knowledge, any question of precedence\nmight have renewed the trouble. Thus disaster would have been\nbrought to the church after Christ\u2019s departure. The strife for the\nhighest place was the outworking of that same spirit which was the\nbeginning of the great controversy in the worlds above, and which\nhad brought Christ from heaven to die. There rose up before Him\na vision of Lucifer, the \u201cson of the morning,\u201d in glory surpassing\nall the angels that surround the throne, and united in closest ties to\nthe Son of God. Lucifer had said, \u201cI will be like the Most High\u201d\n(Isaiah 14:12, 14); and the desire for self-exaltation had brought\nstrife into the heavenly courts, and had banished a multitude of the\nhosts of God. Had Lucifer really desired to be like the Most High,\nhe would never have deserted his appointed place in heaven; for the\nspirit of the Most High is manifested in unselfish ministry. Lucifer\nWho Is the Greatest? 379\ndesired God\u2019s power, but not His character. He sought for himself\nthe highest place, and every being who is actuated by his spirit will [436]\ndo the same. Thus alienation, discord, and strife will be inevitable.\nDominion becomes the prize of the strongest. The kingdom of Satan\nis a kingdom of force; every individual regards every other as an\nobstacle in the way of his own advancement, or a steppingstone on\nwhich he himself may climb to a higher place.\nWhile Lucifer counted it a thing to be grasped to be equal with\nGod, Christ, the Exalted One, \u201cmade Himself of no reputation, and\ntook upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness\nof men: and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Him-\nself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\u201d\nPhilippians 2:7, 8. Now the cross was just before Him; and His\nown disciples were so filled with self-seeking\u2014the very principle\nof Satan\u2019s kingdom\u2014that they could not enter into sympathy with\ntheir Lord, or even understand Him as He spoke of His humiliation\nfor them.\nVery tenderly, yet with solemn emphasis, Jesus tried to correct\nthe evil. He showed what is the principle that bears sway in the\nkingdom of heaven, and in what true greatness consists, as estimated\nby the standard of the courts above. Those who were actuated by\npride and love of distinction were thinking of themselves, and of the\nrewards they were to have, rather than how they were to render back\nto God the gifts they had received. They would have no place in the\nkingdom of heaven, for they were identified with the ranks of Satan.\nBefore honor is humility. To fill a high place before men, Heaven\nchooses the worker who, like John the Baptist, takes a lowly place\nbefore God. The most childlike disciple is the most efficient in labor\nfor God. The heavenly intelligences can co-operate with him who\nis seeking, not to exalt self, but to save souls. He who feels most\ndeeply his need of divine aid will plead for it; and the Holy Spirit\nwill give unto him glimpses of Jesus that will strengthen and uplift\nthe soul. From communion with Christ he will go forth to work for\nthose who are perishing in their sins. He is anointed for his mission;\nand he succeeds where many of the learned and intellectually wise\nwould fail.\nBut when men exalt themselves, feeling that they are a necessity\nfor the success of God\u2019s great plan, the Lord causes them to be set\n380 The Desire of Ages\naside. It is made evident that the Lord is not dependent upon them.\nThe work does not stop because of their removal from it, but goes\nforward with greater power.\nIt was not enough for the disciples of Jesus to be instructed as to[437]\nthe nature of His kingdom. What they needed was a change of heart\nthat would bring them into harmony with its principles. Calling a\nlittle child to Him, Jesus set him in the midst of them; then tenderly\nfolding the little one in His arms He said, \u201cExcept ye be converted,\nand become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom\nof heaven.\u201d The simplicity, the self-forgetfulness, and the confiding\nlove of a little child are the attributes that Heaven values. These are\nthe characteristics of real greatness.\nAgain Jesus explained to the disciples that His kingdom is not\ncharacterized by earthly dignity and display. At the feet of Jesus all\nthese distinctions are forgotten. The rich and the poor, the learned\nand the ignorant, meet together, with no thought of caste or worldly\npreeminence. All meet as blood-bought souls, alike dependent upon\nOne who has redeemed them to God.\nThe sincere, contrite soul is precious in the sight of God. He\nplaces His own signet upon men, not by their rank, not by their\nwealth, not by their intellectual greatness, but by their oneness with\nChrist. The Lord of glory is satisfied with those who are meek and\nlowly in heart. \u201cThou hast also given me,\u201d said David, \u201cthe shield of\nThy salvation: ... and Thy gentleness\u201d\u2014as an element in the human\ncharacter\u2014\u201chath made me great.\u201d Psalm 18:35.\n\u201cWhosoever shall receive one of such children in My name,\u201d said\nJesus, \u201creceiveth Me: and whosoever shall receive Me, receiveth not\nMe, but Him that sent Me.\u201d \u201cThus saith the Lord, The heaven is My\nthrone, and the earth is My footstool: ... but to this man will I look,\neven to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My\nword.\u201d Isaiah 66:1, 2.\nThe Saviour\u2019s words awakened in the disciples a feeling of self-\ndistrust. No one had been specially pointed out in the reply; but John\nwas led to question whether in one case his action had been right.\nWith the spirit of a child he laid the matter before Jesus. \u201cMaster,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cwe saw one casting out devils in Thy name, and he followeth\nnot us: and we forbade him, because he followeth not us.\u201d\nWho Is the Greatest? 381\nJames and John had thought that in checking this man they had\nhad in view their Lord\u2019s honor; they began to see that they were\njealous for their own. They acknowledged their error, and accepted\nthe reproof of Jesus, \u201cForbid him not: for there is no man which\nshall do a miracle in My name, that can lightly speak evil of Me.\u201d\nNone who showed themselves in any way friendly to Christ were to [438]\nbe repulsed. There were many who had been deeply moved by the\ncharacter and the work of Christ, and whose hearts were opening to\nHim in faith; and the disciples, who could not read motives, must\nbe careful not to discourage these souls. When Jesus was no longer\npersonally among them, and the work was left in their hands, they\nmust not indulge a narrow, exclusive spirit, but manifest the same\nfar-reaching sympathy which they had seen in their Master.\nThe fact that one does not in all things conform to our personal\nideas or opinions will not justify us in forbidding him to labor for\nGod. Christ is the Great Teacher; we are not to judge or to command,\nbut in humility each is to sit at the feet of Jesus, and learn of Him.\nEvery soul whom God has made willing is a channel through which\nChrist will reveal His pardoning love. How careful we should be\nlest we discourage one of God\u2019s light bearers, and thus intercept the\nrays that He would have shine to the world!\nHarshness or coldness shown by a disciple toward one whom\nChrist was drawing\u2014such an act as that of John in forbidding one to\nwork miracles in Christ\u2019s name\u2014might result in turning the feet into\nthe path of the enemy, and causing the loss of a soul. Rather than\nfor one to do this, said Jesus, \u201cit is better for him that a millstone\nwere hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.\u201d And He\nadded, \u201cIf thy hand cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for\nthee to enter into life maimed, rather than having thy two hands to\ngo into hell, into the unquenchable fire. And if thy foot cause thee\nto stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life halt, rather\nthan having thy two feet to be cast into hell.\u201d Mark 9:43-45, R. V .\nWhy this earnest language, than which none can be stronger?\nBecause \u201cthe Son of man is come to save that which was lost.\u201d Shall\nHis disciples show less regard for the souls of their fellow men than\nthe Majesty of heaven has shown? Every soul has cost an infinite\nprice, and how terrible is the sin of turning one soul away from\n382 The Desire of Ages\nChrist, so that for him the Saviour\u2019s love and humiliation and agony\nshall have been in vain.\n\u201cWoe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling! for it\nmust needs be that the occasions come.\u201d Matthew 18:7, R. V . The\nworld, inspired by Satan, will surely oppose the followers of Christ,\nand seek to destroy their faith; but woe to him who has taken Christ\u2019s\nname, and yet is found doing this work. Our Lord is put to shame by[439]\nthose who claim to serve Him, but who misrepresent His character;\nand multitudes are deceived, and led into false paths.\nAny habit or practice that would lead into sin, and bring dishonor\nupon Christ, would better be put away, whatever the sacrifice. That\nwhich dishonors God cannot benefit the soul. The blessing of heaven\ncannot attend any man in violating the eternal principles of right.\nAnd one sin cherished is sufficient to work the degradation of the\ncharacter, and to mislead others. If the foot or the hand would be\ncut off, or even the eye would be plucked out, to save the body from\ndeath, how much more earnest should we be to put away sin, that\nbrings death to the soul!\nIn the ritual service, salt was added to every sacrifice. This,\nlike the offering of incense, signified that only the righteousness of\nChrist could make the service acceptable to God. Referring to this\npractice, Jesus said, \u201cEvery sacrifice shall be salted with salt.\u201d \u201cHave\nsalt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.\u201d All who would\npresent themselves \u201ca living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God\u201d\n(Romans 12:1), must receive the saving salt, the righteousness of our\nSaviour. Then they become \u201cthe salt of the earth,\u201d restraining evil\namong men, as salt preserves from corruption. Matthew 5:13. But if\nthe salt has lost its savor; if there is only a profession of godliness,\nwithout the love of Christ, there is no power for good. The life can\nexert no saving influence upon the world. Your energy and efficiency\nin the upbuilding of My kingdom, Jesus says, depend upon your\nreceiving of My Spirit. You must be partakers of My grace, in order\nto be a savor of life unto life. Then there will be no rivalry, no\nself-seeking, no desire for the highest place. You will have that love\nwhich seeks not her own, but another\u2019s wealth.\nLet the repenting sinner fix his eyes upon \u201cthe Lamb of God,\nwhich taketh away the sin of the world\u201d (John 1:29); and by behold-\ning, he becomes changed. His fear is turned to joy, his doubts to\nWho Is the Greatest? 383\nhope. Gratitude springs up. The stony heart is broken. A tide of\nlove sweeps into the soul. Christ is in him a well of water springing\nup unto everlasting life. When we see Jesus, a Man of Sorrows and\nacquainted with grief, working to save the lost, slighted, scorned,\nderided, driven from city to city till His mission was accomplished;\nwhen we behold Him in Gethsemane, sweating great drops of blood,\nand on the cross dying in agony,\u2014when we see this, self will no\nlonger clamor to be recognized. Looking unto Jesus, we shall be\nashamed of our coldness, our lethargy, our self-seeking. We shall be [440]\nwilling to be anything or nothing, so that we may do heart service for\nthe Master. We shall rejoice to bear the cross after Jesus, to endure\ntrial, shame, or persecution for His dear sake.\n\u201cWe then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak,\nand not to please ourselves.\u201d Romans 15:1. No soul who believes\nin Christ, though his faith may be weak, and his steps wavering\nas those of a little child, is to be lightly esteemed. By all that has\ngiven us advantage over another,\u2014be it education and refinement,\nnobility of character, Christian training, religious experience,\u2014we\nare in debt to those less favored; and, so far as lies in our power,\nwe are to minister unto them. If we are strong, we are to stay up\nthe hands of the weak. Angels of glory, that do always behold the\nface of the Father in heaven, joy in ministering to His little ones.\nTrembling souls, who have many objectionable traits of character,\nare their special charge. Angels are ever present where they are most\nneeded, with those who have the hardest battle with self to fight, and\nwhose surroundings are the most discouraging. And in this ministry\nChrist\u2019s true followers will co-operate.\nIf one of these little ones shall be overcome, and commit a wrong\nagainst you, then it is your work to seek his restoration. Do not wait\nfor him to make the first effort for reconciliation. \u201cHow think ye?\u201d\nsaid Jesus; \u201cif a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be\ngone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the\nmountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray? And if so be that\nhe find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than\nof the ninety and nine which went not astray. Even so it is not the\nwill of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones\nshould perish.\u201d\n384 The Desire of Ages\nIn the spirit of meekness, \u201cconsidering thyself, lest thou also\nbe tempted,\u201d (Galatians 6:1), go to the erring one, and \u201ctell him\nhis fault between thee and him alone.\u201d Do not put him to shame\nby exposing his fault to others, nor bring dishonor upon Christ by\nmaking public the sin or error of one who bears His name. Often the\ntruth must be plainly spoken to the erring; he must be led to see his\nerror, that he may reform. But you are not to judge or to condemn.\nMake no attempt at self-justification. Let all your effort be for his\nrecovery. In treating the wounds of the soul, there is need of the most\ndelicate touch, the finest sensibility. Only the love that flows from\nthe Suffering One of Calvary can avail here. With pitying tenderness,\nlet brother deal with brother, knowing that if you succeed, you will\n\u201csave a soul from death,\u201d and \u201chide a multitude of sins.\u201d James 5:20.\nBut even this effort may be unavailing. Then, said Jesus, \u201ctake[441]\nwith thee one or two more.\u201d It may be that their united influence will\nprevail where that of the first was unsuccessful. Not being parties to\nthe trouble, they will be more likely to act impartially, and this fact\nwill give their counsel greater weight with the erring one.\nIf he will not hear them, then, and not till then, the matter is to\nbe brought before the whole body of believers. Let the members\nof the church, as the representatives of Christ, unite in prayer and\nloving entreaty that the offender may be restored. The Holy Spirit\nwill speak through His servants, pleading with the wanderer to return\nto God. Paul the apostle, speaking by inspiration, says, \u201cAs though\nGod did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ\u2019s stead, be ye\nreconciled to God.\u201d 2 Corinthians 5:20. He who rejects this united\noverture has broken the tie that binds him to Christ, and thus has\nsevered himself from the fellowship of the church. Henceforth, said\nJesus, \u201clet him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.\u201d But\nhe is not to be regarded as cut off from the mercy of God. Let him\nnot be despised or neglected by his former brethren, but be treated\nwith tenderness and compassion, as one of the lost sheep that Christ\nis still seeking to bring to His fold.\nChrist\u2019s instruction as to the treatment of the erring repeats in\nmore specific form the teaching given to Israel through Moses:\n\u201cThou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in anywise\nrebuke thy neighbor, that thou bear not sin for him.\u201d Leviticus 19:17,\nmargin. That is, if one neglects the duty Christ has enjoined, of trying\nWho Is the Greatest? 385\nto restore those who are in error and sin, he becomes a partaker in the\nsin. For evils that we might have checked, we are just as responsible\nas if we were guilty of the acts ourselves.\nBut it is to the wrongdoer himself that we are to present the\nwrong. We are not to make it a matter of comment and criticism\namong ourselves; nor even after it is told to the church, are we at\nliberty to repeat it to others. A knowledge of the faults of Christians\nwill be only a cause of stumbling to the unbelieving world; and by\ndwelling upon these things, we ourselves can receive only harm; for\nit is by beholding that we become changed. While we seek to correct\nthe errors of a brother, the Spirit of Christ will lead us to shield him,\nas far as possible, from the criticism of even his own brethren, and\nhow much more from the censure of the unbelieving world. We\nourselves are erring, and need Christ\u2019s pity and forgiveness, and just\nas we wish Him to deal with us, He bids us deal with one another.\n\u201cWhatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: [442]\nand whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\u201d\nYou are acting as the ambassadors of heaven, and the issues of your\nwork are for eternity.\nBut we are not to bear this great responsibility alone. Wherever\nHis word is obeyed with a sincere heart, there Christ abides. Not\nonly is He present in the assemblies of the church, but wherever\ndisciples, however few, meet in His name, there also He will be. And\nHe says, \u201cIf two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything\nthat they shall ask, it shall be done for them of My Father which is\nin heaven.\u201d\nJesus says, \u201cMy Father which is in heaven,\u201d as reminding His\ndisciples that while by His humanity He is linked with them, a sharer\nin their trials, and sympathizing with them in their sufferings, by His\ndivinity He is connected with the throne of the Infinite. Wonderful\nassurance! The heavenly intelligences unite with men in sympathy\nand labor for the saving of that which was lost. And all the power of\nheaven is brought to combine with human ability in drawing souls\nto Christ.\nChapter 49\u2014At the Feast of Tabernacles[443]\n[444]\n[445]\n[446]\n[447]\nThis chapter is based on John 7:1-15, 37-39.\nThree times a year the Jews were required to assemble at\nJerusalem for religious purposes. Enshrouded in the pillar of cloud,\nIsrael\u2019s invisible Leader had given the directions in regard to these\ngatherings. During the captivity of the Jews, they could not be ob-\nserved; but when the people were restored to their own land, the\nobservance of these memorials was once more begun. It was God\u2019s\ndesign that these anniversaries should call Him to the minds of the\npeople. But with few exceptions, the priests and leaders of the\nnation had lost sight of this purpose. He who had ordained these\nnational assemblies and understood their significance witnessed their\nperversion.\nThe Feast of Tabernacles was the closing gathering of the year.\nIt was God\u2019s design that at this time the people should reflect on His\ngoodness and mercy. The whole land had been under His guidance,\nreceiving His blessing. Day and night His watchcare had continued.\nThe sun and rain had caused the earth to produce her fruits. From\nthe valleys and plains of Palestine the harvest had been gathered.\nThe olive berries had been picked, and the precious oil stored in\nbottles. The palm had yielded her store. The purple clusters of the\nvine had been trodden in the wine press.\nThe feast continued for seven days, and for its celebration the[448]\ninhabitants of Palestine, with many from other lands, left their homes,\nand came to Jerusalem. From far and near the people came, bringing\nin their hands a token of rejoicing. Old and young, rich and poor,\nall brought some gift as a tribute of thanksgiving to Him who had\ncrowned the year with His goodness, and made His paths drop\nfatness. Everything that could please the eye, and give expression\nto the universal joy, was brought from the woods; the city bore the\nappearance of a beautiful forest.\n386\nAt the Feast of Tabernacles 387\nThis feast was not only the harvest thanksgiving, but the memo-\nrial of God\u2019s protecting care over Israel in the wilderness. In com-\nmemoration of their tent life, the Israelites during the feast dwelt in\nbooths or tabernacles of green boughs. These were erected in the\nstreets, in the courts of the temple, or on the housetops. The hills\nand valleys surrounding Jerusalem were also dotted with these leafy\ndwellings, and seemed to be alive with people.\nWith sacred song and thanksgiving the worshipers celebrated\nthis occasion. A little before the feast was the Day of Atonement,\nwhen, after confession of their sins, the people were declared to be\nat peace with Heaven. Thus the way was prepared for the rejoicing\nof the feast. \u201cO give thanks unto the Lord; for He is good: for His\nmercy endureth forever\u201d (Psalm 106:1) rose triumphantly, while all\nkinds of music, mingled with shouts of hosanna, accompanied the\nunited singing. The temple was the center of the universal joy. Here\nwas the pomp of the sacrificial ceremonies. Here, ranged on either\nside of the white marble steps of the sacred building, the choir of\nLevites led the service of song. The multitude of worshipers, waving\ntheir branches of palm and myrtle, took up the strain, and echoed\nthe chorus; and again the melody was caught up by voices near and\nafar off, till the encircling hills were vocal with praise.\nAt night the temple and its court blazed with artificial light. The\nmusic, the waving of palm branches, the glad hosannas, the great\nconcourse of people, over whom the light streamed from the hanging\nlamps, the array of the priests, and the majesty of the ceremonies,\ncombined to make a scene that deeply impressed the beholders. But\nthe most impressive ceremony of the feast, one that called forth great-\nest rejoicing, was one commemorating an event in the wilderness\nsojourn.\nAt the first dawn of day, the priests sounded a long, shrill blast\nupon their silver trumpets, and the answering trumpets, and the\nglad shouts of the people from their booths, echoing over hill and\nvalley, welcomed the festal day. Then the priest dipped from the [449]\nflowing waters of the Kedron a flagon of water, and, lifting it on\nhigh, while the trumpets were sounding, he ascended the broad steps\nof the temple, keeping time with the music with slow and measured\ntread, chanting meanwhile, \u201cOur feet shall stand within thy gates, O\nJerusalem.\u201d Psalm 122:2.\n388 The Desire of Ages\nHe bore the flagon to the altar, which occupied a central position\nin the court of the priests. Here were two silver basins, with a priest\nstanding at each one. The flagon of water was poured into one, and\na flagon of wine into the other; and the contents of both flowed into\na pipe which communicated with the Kedron, and was conducted\nto the Dead Sea. This display of the consecrated water represented\nthe fountain that at the command of God had gushed from the rock\nto quench the thirst of the children of Israel. Then the jubilant\nstrains rang forth, \u201cThe Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song;\u201d\n\u201ctherefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.\u201d\nIsaiah 12:2, 3.\nAs the sons of Joseph made preparation to attend the Feast of[450]\nTabernacles, they saw that Christ made no movement signifying His\nintention of attending. They watched Him with anxiety. Since the\nhealing at Bethesda He had not attended the national gatherings. To\navoid useless conflict with the leaders at Jerusalem, He had restricted\nHis labors to Galilee. His apparent neglect of the great religious\nassemblies, and the enmity manifested toward Him by the priests\nand rabbis, were a cause of perplexity to the people about Him,\nand even to His own disciples and His kindred. In His teachings\nHe had dwelt upon the blessings of obedience to the law of God,\nand yet He Himself seemed to be indifferent to the service which\nhad been divinely established. His mingling with publicans and\nothers of ill repute, His disregard of the rabbinical observances, and\nthe freedom with which He set aside the traditional requirements\nconcerning the Sabbath, all seeming to place Him in antagonism\nto the religious authorities, excited much questioning. His brothers\nthought it a mistake for Him to alienate the great and learned men\nof the nation. They felt that these men must be in the right, and that\nJesus was at fault in placing Himself in antagonism to them. But\nthey had witnessed His blameless life, and though they did not rank\nthemselves with His disciples, they had been deeply impressed by\nHis works. His popularity in Galilee was gratifying to their ambition;\nthey still hoped that He would give an evidence of His power which\nwould lead the Pharisees to see that He was what He claimed to be.\nWhat if He were the Messiah, the Prince of Israel! They cherished\nthis thought with proud satisfaction.\nAt the Feast of Tabernacles 389\nSo anxious were they about this that they urged Christ to go\nto Jerusalem. \u201cDepart hence,\u201d they said, \u201cand go into Judea, that\nThy disciples also may see the works that Thou doest. For there is\nno man that doeth anything in secret, and he himself seeketh to be\nknown openly. If Thou do these things, show Thyself to the world.\u201d\nThe \u201cif\u201d expressed doubt and unbelief. They attributed cowardice\nand weakness to Him. If He knew that He was the Messiah, why this\nstrange reserve and inaction? If He really possessed such power, why\nnot go boldly to Jerusalem, and assert His claims? Why not perform\nin Jerusalem the wonderful works reported of Him in Galilee? Do\nnot hide in secluded provinces, they said, and perform your mighty\nworks for the benefit of ignorant peasants and fishermen. Present\nyourself at the capital, win the support of the priests and rulers, and\nunite the nation in establishing the new kingdom.\nThese brothers of Jesus reasoned from the selfish motive so often [451]\nfound in the hearts of those ambitious for display. This spirit was\nthe ruling spirit of the world. They were offended because, instead\nof seeking a temporal throne, Christ had declared Himself to be the\nbread of life. They were greatly disappointed when so many of His\ndisciples forsook Him. They themselves turned from Him to escape\nthe cross of acknowledging what His works revealed\u2014that He was\nthe Sent of God.\n\u201cThen Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your\ntime is alway ready. The world cannot hate you; but Me it hateth,\nbecause I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. Go ye up unto\nthis feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for My time is not yet full\ncome. When He had said these words unto them, He abode still\nin Galilee.\u201d His brothers had spoken to Him in a tone of authority,\nprescribing the course He should pursue. He cast their rebuke back\nto them, classing them not with His self-denying disciples, but with\nthe world. \u201cThe world cannot hate you,\u201d He said, \u201cbut Me it hateth,\nbecause I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.\u201d The world\ndoes not hate those who are like it in spirit; it loves them as its own.\nThe world for Christ was not a place of ease and self-aggran-\ndizement. He was not watching for an opportunity to seize its power\nand its glory. It held out no such prize for Him. It was the place\ninto which His Father had sent Him. He had been given for the\nlife of the world, to work out the great plan of redemption. He was\n390 The Desire of Ages\naccomplishing His work for the fallen race. But He was not to be\npresumptuous, not to rush into danger, not to hasten a crisis. Each\nevent in His work had its appointed hour. He must wait patiently. He\nknew that He was to receive the world\u2019s hatred; He knew that His\nwork would result in His death; but to prematurely expose Himself\nwould not be the will of His Father.\nFrom Jerusalem the report of Christ\u2019s miracles had spread wher-\never the Jews were dispersed; and although for many months He\nhad been absent from the feasts, the interest in Him had not abated.\nMany from all parts of the world had come up to the Feast of Taber-\nnacles in the hope of seeing Him. At the beginning of the feast many\ninquiries were made for Him. The Pharisees and rulers looked for\nHim to come, hoping for an opportunity to condemn Him. They\nanxiously inquired, \u201cWhere is He?\u201d but no one knew. The thought\nof Him was uppermost in all minds. Through fear of the priests and\nrulers, none dared acknowledge Him as the Messiah, but everywhere[452]\nthere was quiet yet earnest discussion concerning Him. Many de-\nfended Him as one sent from God, while others denounced Him as\na deceiver of the people.\nMeanwhile Jesus had quietly arrived at Jerusalem. He had chosen\nan unfrequented route by which to go, in order to avoid the travelers\nwho were making their way to the city from all quarters. Had He\njoined any of the caravans that went up to the feast, public attention\nwould have been attracted to Him on His entrance into the city,\nand a popular demonstration in His favor would have aroused the\nauthorities against Him. It was to avoid this that He chose to make\nthe journey alone.\nIn the midst of the feast, when the excitement concerning Him\nwas at its height, He entered the court of the temple in the presence\nof the multitude. Because of His absence from the feast, it had been\nurged that He dared not place Himself in the power of the priests and\nrulers. All were surprised at His presence. Every voice was hushed.\nAll wondered at the dignity and courage of His bearing in the midst\nof powerful enemies who were thirsting for His life.\nStanding thus, the center of attraction to that vast throng, Jesus\naddressed them as no man had ever done. His words showed a\nknowledge of the laws and institutions of Israel, of the sacrificial[453]\nservice and the teachings of the prophets, far exceeding that of the\nAt the Feast of Tabernacles 391\npriests and rabbis. He broke through the barriers of formalism and\ntradition. The scenes of the future life seemed outspread before\nHim. As one who beheld the Unseen, He spoke of the earthly and\nthe heavenly, the human and the divine, with positive authority. His\nwords were most clear and convincing; and again, as at Capernaum,\nthe people were astonished at His teaching; \u201cfor His word was with\npower.\u201d Luke 4:32. Under a variety of representations He warned\nHis hearers of the calamity that would follow all who rejected the\nblessings He came to bring them. He had given them every possible\nproof that He came forth from God, and made every possible effort\nto bring them to repentance. He would not be rejected and murdered\nby His own nation if He could save them from the guilt of such a\ndeed.\nAll wondered at His knowledge of the law and the prophecies;\nand the question passed from one to another, \u201cHow knoweth this Man\nletters, having never learned?\u201d No one was regarded as qualified to\nbe a religious teacher unless he had studied in the rabbinical schools,\nand both Jesus and John the Baptist had been represented as ignorant\nbecause they had not received this training. Those who heard them\nwere astonished at their knowledge of the Scriptures, \u201chaving never\nlearned.\u201d Of men they had not, truly; but the God of heaven was\ntheir teacher, and from Him they had received the highest kind of\nwisdom.\nAs Jesus spoke in the temple court, the people were held spell-\nbound. The very men who were the most violent against Him felt\nthemselves powerless to do Him harm. For the time, all other inter-\nests were forgotten.\nDay after day He taught the people, until the last, \u201cthat great day\nof the feast.\u201d The morning of this day found the people wearied from\nthe long season of festivity. Suddenly Jesus lifted up His voice, in\ntones that rang through the courts of the temple:\n\u201cIf any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink. He that\nbelieveth on Me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall\nflow rivers of living water.\u201d The condition of the people made this\nappeal very forcible. They had been engaged in a continued scene\nof pomp and festivity, their eyes had been dazzled with light and\ncolor, and their ears regaled with the richest music; but there had\nbeen nothing in all this round of ceremonies to meet the wants of the\n392 The Desire of Ages\nspirit, nothing to satisfy the thirst of the soul for that which perishes[454]\nnot. Jesus invited them to come and drink of the fountain of life,\nof that which would be in them a well of water, springing up unto\neverlasting life.\nThe priest had that morning performed the ceremony which\ncommemorated the smiting of the rock in the wilderness. That rock\nwas a symbol of Him who by His death would cause living streams\nof salvation to flow to all who are athirst. Christ\u2019s words were the\nwater of life. There in the presence of the assembled multitude He\nset Himself apart to be smitten, that the water of life might flow to\nthe world. In smiting Christ, Satan thought to destroy the Prince of\nlife; but from the smitten rock there flowed living water. As Jesus\nthus spoke to the people, their hearts thrilled with a strange awe, and\nmany were ready to exclaim, with the woman of Samaria, \u201cGive me\nthis water, that I thirst not.\u201d John 4:15.\nJesus knew the wants of the soul. Pomp, riches, and honor cannot\nsatisfy the heart. \u201cIf any man thirst, let him come unto Me.\u201d The rich,\nthe poor, the high, the low, are alike welcome. He promises to relieve\nthe burdened mind, to comfort the sorrowing, and to give hope to\nthe despondent. Many of those who heard Jesus were mourners over\ndisappointed hopes, many were nourishing a secret grief, many were\nseeking to satisfy their restless longing with the things of the world\nand the praise of men; but when all was gained, they found that they\nhad toiled only to reach a broken cistern, from which they could not\nquench their thirst. Amid the glitter of the joyous scene they stood,\ndissatisfied and sad. That sudden cry, \u201cIf any man thirst,\u201d startled\nthem from their sorrowful meditation, and as they listened to the\nwords that followed, their minds kindled with a new hope. The Holy\nSpirit presented the symbol before them until they saw in it the offer\nof the priceless gift of salvation.\nThe cry of Christ to the thirsty soul is still going forth, and it\nappeals to us with even greater power than to those who heard it in\nthe temple on that last day of the feast. The fountain is open for all.\nThe weary and exhausted ones are offered the refreshing draught of\neternal life. Jesus is still crying, \u201cIf any man thirst, let him come\nunto Me, and drink.\u201d \u201cLet him that is athirst come. And whosoever\nwill, let him take the water of life freely.\u201d \u201cWhosoever drinketh of\nthe water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that\nAt the Feast of Tabernacles 393\nI shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into\neverlasting life.\u201d Revelation 22:17; John 4:14.\nChapter 50\u2014Among Snares[455]\nThis chapter is based on John 7:16-36, 40-53; John 8:1-11.\nAll the while Jesus was at Jerusalem during the feast He was\nshadowed by spies. Day after day new schemes to silence Him were\ntried. The priests and rulers were watching to entrap Him. They\nwere planning to stop Him by violence. But this was not all. They\nwanted to humble this Galilean rabbi before the people.\nOn the first day of His presence at the feast, the rulers had come\nto Him, demanding by what authority He taught. They wished to\ndivert attention from Him to the question of His right to teach, and\nthus to their own importance and authority.\n\u201cMy teaching is not Mine,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cbut His that sent Me.\nIf any man willeth to do His will, he shall know of the teaching,\nwhether it be of God, or whether I speak from Myself.\u201d John 7:16,\n17, R. V . The question of these cavilers Jesus met, not by answering\nthe cavil, but by opening up truth vital to the salvation of the soul.\nThe perception and appreciation of truth, He said, depends less upon\nthe mind than upon the heart. Truth must be received into the soul;\nit claims the homage of the will. If truth could be submitted to the\nreason alone, pride would be no hindrance in the way of its reception.\nBut it is to be received through the work of grace in the heart; and\nits reception depends upon the renunciation of every sin that the\nSpirit of God reveals. Man\u2019s advantages for obtaining a knowledge\nof the truth, however great these may be, will prove of no benefit\nto him unless the heart is open to receive the truth, and there is a[456]\nconscientious surrender of every habit and practice that is opposed to\nits principles. To those who thus yield themselves to God, having an\nhonest desire to know and to do His will, the truth is revealed as the\npower of God for their salvation. These will be able to distinguish\nbetween him who speaks for God, and him who speaks merely from\nhimself. The Pharisees had not put their will on the side of God\u2019s\nwill. They were not seeking to know the truth, but to find some\n394\nAmong Snares 395\nexcuse for evading it; Christ showed that this was why they did not\nunderstand His teaching.\nHe now gave a test by which the true teacher might be distin-\nguished from the deceiver: \u201cHe that speaketh from himself seeketh\nhis own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of Him that sent him,\nthe same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.\u201d John 7:18, R. V .\nHe that seeketh his own glory is speaking only from himself. The\nspirit of self-seeking betrays its origin. But Christ was seeking the\nglory of God. He spoke the words of God. This was the evidence of\nHis authority as a teacher of the truth.\nJesus gave the rabbis an evidence of His divinity by showing\nthat He read their hearts. Ever since the healing at Bethesda they\nhad been plotting His death. Thus they were themselves breaking\nthe law which they professed to be defending. \u201cDid not Moses give\nyou the law,\u201d He said, \u201cand yet none of you keepeth the law? Why\ngo ye about to kill Me?\u201d\nLike a swift flash of light these words revealed to the rabbis the\npit of ruin into which they were about to plunge. For an instant they\nwere filled with terror. They saw that they were in conflict with\nInfinite Power. But they would not be warned. In order to maintain\ntheir influence with the people, their murderous designs must be\nconcealed. Evading the question of Jesus, they exclaimed, \u201cThou\nhast a devil: who goeth about to kill Thee?\u201d They insinuated that the\nwonderful works of Jesus were instigated by an evil spirit.\nTo this insinuation Christ gave no heed. He went on to show that\nHis work of healing at Bethesda was in harmony with the Sabbath\nlaw, and that it was justified by the interpretation which the Jews\nthemselves put upon the law. He said, \u201cMoses therefore gave unto\nyou circumcision; ... and ye on the Sabbath day circumcise a man.\u201d\nAccording to the law, every child must be circumcised on the eighth\nday. Should the appointed time fall upon the Sabbath, the rite must\nthen be performed. How much more must it be in harmony with the\nspirit of the law to make a man \u201cevery whit whole on the Sabbath [457]\nday.\u201d And He warned them to \u201cjudge not according to the appearance,\nbut judge righteous judgment.\u201d\nThe rulers were silenced; and many of the people exclaimed, \u201cIs\nnot this He, whom they seek to kill? But, lo, He speaketh boldly,\n396 The Desire of Ages\nand they say nothing unto Him. Do the rulers know indeed that this\nis the very Christ?\u201d\nMany among Christ\u2019s hearers who were dwellers at Jerusalem,\nand who were not ignorant of the plots of the rulers against Him, felt\nthemselves drawn to Him by an irresistible power. The conviction\npressed upon them that He was the Son of God. But Satan was ready\nto suggest doubt; and for this the way was prepared by their own\nerroneous ideas of the Messiah and His coming. It was generally\nbelieved that Christ would be born at Bethlehem, but that after a time\nHe would disappear, and at His second appearance none would know\nwhence He came. There were not a few who held that the Messiah\nwould have no natural relationship to humanity. And because the\npopular conception of the glory of the Messiah was not met by Jesus\nof Nazareth, many gave heed to the suggestion, \u201cHowbeit we know\nthis Man whence He is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth\nwhence He is.\u201d\nWhile they were thus wavering between doubt and faith, Jesus\ntook up their thoughts and answered them: \u201cYe both know Me, and\nye know whence I am: and I am not come of Myself, but He that sent\nMe is true, whom ye know not.\u201d They claimed a knowledge of what\nthe origin of Christ should be, but they were in utter ignorance of\nit. If they had lived in accordance with the will of God, they would\nhave known His Son when He was manifested to them.\nThe hearers could not but understand Christ\u2019s words. Clearly\nthey were a repetition of the claim He had made in the presence\nof the Sanhedrin many months before, when He declared Himself\nthe Son of God. As the rulers then tried to compass His death, so\nnow they sought to take Him; but they were prevented by an unseen\npower, which put a limit to their rage, saying to them, Thus far shalt\nthou go, and no farther.\nAmong the people many believed on Him, and they said, \u201cWhen\nChrist cometh, will He do more miracles than these which this\nMan hath done?\u201d The leaders of the Pharisees, who were anxiously\nwatching the course of events, caught the expressions of sympathy\namong the throng. Hurrying away to the chief priests, they laid their\nplans to arrest Him. They arranged, however, to take Him when[458]\nHe was alone; for they dared not seize Him in the presence of the\npeople. Again Jesus made it manifest that He read their purpose.\nAmong Snares 397\n\u201cYet a little while am I with you,\u201d He said, \u201cand then I go unto Him\nthat sent Me. Ye shall seek Me, and shall not find Me: and where I\nam, thither ye cannot come.\u201d Soon He would find a refuge beyond\nthe reach of their scorn and hate. He would ascend to the Father, to\nbe again the Adored of the angels; and thither His murderers could\nnever come.\nSneeringly the rabbis said, \u201cWhither will He go, that we shall\nnot find Him? will He go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles,\nand teach the Gentiles?\u201d Little did these cavilers dream that in their\nmocking words they were picturing the mission of the Christ! All\nday long He had stretched forth His hands unto a disobedient and\ngainsaying people; yet He would be found of them that sought Him\nnot; among a people that had not called upon His name He would\nbe manifest. Romans 10:20, 21.\nMany who were convinced that Jesus was the Son of God were\nmisled by the false reasoning of the priests and rabbis. These teach-\ners had repeated with great effect the prophecies concerning the\nMessiah, that He would \u201creign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and\nbefore His ancients gloriously;\u201d that He would \u201chave dominion also\nfrom sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.\u201d Isaiah\n24:23; Psalm 72:8. Then they made contemptuous comparisons\nbetween the glory here pictured and the humble appearance of Jesus.\nThe very words of prophecy were so perverted as to sanction error.\nHad the people in sincerity studied the word for themselves, they\nwould not have been misled. The sixty-first chapter of Isaiah testifies\nthat Christ was to do the very work He did. Chapter fifty-three sets\nforth His rejection and sufferings in the world, and chapter fifty-nine\ndescribes the character of the priests and rabbis.\nGod does not compel men to give up their unbelief. Before them\nare light and darkness, truth and error. It is for them to decide which\nthey will accept. The human mind is endowed with power to dis-\ncriminate between right and wrong. God designs that men shall not\ndecide from impulse, but from weight of evidence, carefully com-\nparing scripture with scripture. Had the Jews laid by their prejudice\nand compared written prophecy with the facts characterizing the life\nof Jesus, they would have perceived a beautiful harmony between\nthe prophecies and their fulfillment in the life and ministry of the\nlowly Galilean.\n398 The Desire of Ages\nMany are deceived today in the same way as were the Jews.[459]\nReligious teachers read the Bible in the light of their own under-\nstanding and traditions; and the people do not search the Scriptures\nfor themselves, and judge for themselves as to what is truth; but\nthey yield up their judgment, and commit their souls to their leaders.\nThe preaching and teaching of His word is one of the means that\nGod has ordained for diffusing light; but we must bring every man\u2019s\nteaching to the test of Scripture. Whoever will prayerfully study the\nBible, desiring to know the truth, that he may obey it, will receive\ndivine enlightenment. He will understand the Scriptures. \u201cIf any\nman willeth to do His will, he shall know of the teaching.\u201d John",

      "text": "On the last day of the feast, the officers sent out by the priests\nand rulers to arrest Jesus, returned without Him. They were an-\ngrily questioned, \u201cWhy have ye not brought Him?\u201d With solemn\ncountenance they answered, \u201cNever man spake like this Man.\u201d\nHardened as were their hearts, they were melted by His words.\nWhile He was speaking in the temple court, they had lingered near,\nto catch something that might be turned against Him. But as they\nlistened, the purpose for which they had been sent was forgotten.\nThey stood as men entranced. Christ revealed Himself to their souls.\nThey saw that which priests and rulers would not see,\u2014humanity\nflooded with the glory of divinity. They returned, so filled with this\nthought, so impressed by His words, that to the inquiry, \u201cWhy have\nye not brought Him?\u201d they could only reply, \u201cNever man spake like\nthis Man.\u201d\nThe priests and rulers, on first coming into the presence of Christ,\nhad felt the same conviction. Their hearts were deeply moved, and\nthe thought was forced upon them, \u201cNever man spake like this Man.\u201d\nBut they had stifled the conviction of the Holy Spirit. Now, enraged\nthat even the instruments of the law should be influenced by the\nhated Galilean, they cried, \u201cAre ye also deceived? Have any of the\nrulers or of the Pharisees believed on Him? But this people who\nknoweth not the law are cursed.\u201d\nThose to whom the message of truth is spoken seldom ask, \u201cIs it\ntrue?\u201d but, \u201cBy whom is it advocated?\u201d Multitudes estimate it by the\nnumbers who accept it; and the question is still asked, \u201cHave any\nof the learned men or religious leaders believed?\u201d Men are no more\nAmong Snares 399\nfavorable to real godliness now than in the days of Christ. They are\njust as intently seeking earthly good, to the neglect of eternal riches;\nand it is not an argument against the truth, that large numbers are [460]\nnot ready to accept it, or that it is not received by the world\u2019s great\nmen, or even by the religious leaders.\nAgain the priests and rulers proceeded to lay plans for arresting\nJesus. It was urged that if He were longer left at liberty, He would\ndraw the people away from the established leaders, and the only safe\ncourse was to silence Him without delay. In the full tide of their\ndiscussion, they were suddenly checked. Nicodemus questioned,\n\u201cDoth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he\ndoeth?\u201d Silence fell on the assembly. The words of Nicodemus came\nhome to their consciences. They could not condemn a man unheard.\nBut it was not for this reason alone that the haughty rulers remained\nsilent, gazing at him who had dared to speak in favor of justice.\nThey were startled and chagrined that one of their own number had\nbeen so far impressed by the character of Jesus as to speak a word\nin His defense. Recovering from their astonishment, they addressed\nNicodemus with cutting sarcasm, \u201cArt thou also of Galilee? Search\nand look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.\u201d\nYet the protest resulted in staying the proceedings of the council.\nThe rulers were unable to carry out their purpose and condemn Jesus\nwithout a hearing. Defeated for the time, \u201cevery man went unto his\nown house. Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives.\u201d\nFrom the excitement and confusion of the city, from the eager\ncrowds and the treacherous rabbis, Jesus turned away to the quiet\nof the olive groves, where He could be alone with God. But in the\nearly morning He returned to the temple, and as the people gathered\nabout Him, He sat down and taught them.\nHe was soon interrupted. A group of Pharisees and scribes ap-\nproached Him, dragging with them a terror-stricken woman, whom\nwith hard, eager voices they accused of having violated the seventh\ncommandment. Having pushed her into the presence of Jesus, they\nsaid to Him, with a hypocritical show of respect, \u201cMoses in the law\ncommanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest Thou?\u201d\nTheir pretended reverence veiled a deep-laid plot for His ruin.\nThey had seized upon this opportunity to secure His condemnation,\nthinking that whatever decision He might make, they would find\n400 The Desire of Ages\noccasion to accuse Him. Should He acquit the woman, He might\nbe charged with despising the law of Moses. Should He declare her\nworthy of death, He could be accused to the Romans as one who[461]\nwas assuming authority that belonged only to them.\nJesus looked for a moment upon the scene,\u2014the trembling victim\nin her shame, the hard-faced dignitaries, devoid of even human pity.\nHis spirit of stainless purity shrank from the spectacle. Well He\nknew for what purpose this case had been brought to Him. He read\nthe heart, and knew the character and life history of everyone in His\npresence. These would-be guardians of justice had themselves led\ntheir victim into sin, that they might lay a snare for Jesus. Giving\nno sign that He had heard their question, He stooped, and fixing His\neyes upon the ground, began to write in the dust.\nImpatient at His delay and apparent indifference, the accusers\ndrew nearer, urging the matter upon His attention. But as their eyes,\nfollowing those of Jesus, fell upon the pavement at His feet, their\ncountenances changed. There, traced before them, were the guilty\nsecrets of their own lives. The people, looking on, saw the sudden\nchange of expression, and pressed forward to discover what it was\nthat they were regarding with such astonishment and shame.\nWith all their professions of reverence for the law, these rabbis,\nin bringing the charge against the woman, were disregarding its\nprovisions. It was the husband\u2019s duty to take action against her, and\nthe guilty parties were to be punished equally. The action of the\naccusers was wholly unauthorized. Jesus, however, met them on\ntheir own ground. The law specified that in punishment by stoning,\nthe witnesses in the case should be the first to cast a stone. Now\nrising, and fixing His eyes upon the plotting elders, Jesus said, \u201cHe\nthat is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.\u201d And\nstooping down, He continued writing on the ground.\nHe had not set aside the law given through Moses, nor infringed\nupon the authority of Rome. The accusers had been defeated. Now,\ntheir robe of pretended holiness torn from them, they stood, guilty\nand condemned, in the presence of Infinite Purity. They trembled\nlest the hidden iniquity of their lives should be laid open to the\nmultitude; and one by one, with bowed heads and downcast eyes,\nthey stole away, leaving their victim with the pitying Saviour.\nAmong Snares 401\nJesus arose, and looking at the woman said, \u201cWoman, where are\nthose thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No\nman, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go,\nand sin no more.\u201d\nThe woman had stood before Jesus, cowering with fear. His [462]\nwords, \u201cHe that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone,\u201d\nhad come to her as a death sentence. She dared not lift her eyes to\nthe Saviour\u2019s face, but silently awaited her doom. In astonishment\nshe saw her accusers depart speechless and confounded; then those\nwords of hope fell upon her ear, \u201cNeither do I condemn thee: go,\nand sin no more.\u201d Her heart was melted, and she cast herself at the\nfeet of Jesus, sobbing out her grateful love, and with bitter tears\nconfessing her sins.\nThis was to her the beginning of a new life, a life of purity and\npeace, devoted to the service of God. In the uplifting of this fallen\nsoul, Jesus performed a greater miracle than in healing the most\ngrievous physical disease; He cured the spiritual malady which is\nunto death everlasting. This penitent woman became one of His\nmost steadfast followers. With self-sacrificing love and devotion she\nrepaid His forgiving mercy.\nIn His act of pardoning this woman and encouraging her to live a\nbetter life, the character of Jesus shines forth in the beauty of perfect\nrighteousness. While He does not palliate sin, nor lessen the sense\nof guilt, He seeks not to condemn, but to save. The world had for\nthis erring woman only contempt and scorn; but Jesus speaks words\nof comfort and hope. The Sinless One pities the weakness of the\nsinner, and reaches to her a helping hand. While the hypocritical\nPharisees denounce, Jesus bids her, \u201cGo, and sin no more.\u201d\nIt is not Christ\u2019s follower that, with averted eyes, turns from the\nerring, leaving them unhindered to pursue their downward course.\nThose who are forward in accusing others, and zealous in bringing\nthem to justice, are often in their own lives more guilty than they.\nMen hate the sinner, while they love the sin. Christ hates the sin,\nbut loves the sinner. This will be the spirit of all who follow Him.\nChristian love is slow to censure, quick to discern penitence, ready\nto forgive, to encourage, to set the wanderer in the path of holiness,\nand to stay his feet therein.\nChapter 51\u2014\u201cThe Light of Life\u201d[463]\nThis chapter is based on John 8:12-59; John 9.\n\u201cThen spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the\nworld: he that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall\nhave the light of life.\u201d\nWhen He spoke these words, Jesus was in the court of the temple\nspecially connected with the services of the Feast of Tabernacles. In\nthe center of this court rose two lofty standards, supporting lamp-\nstands of great size. After the evening sacrifice, all the lamps were\nkindled, shedding their light over Jerusalem. This ceremony was in\ncommemoration of the pillar of light that guided Israel in the desert,\nand was also regarded as pointing to the coming of the Messiah.\nAt evening when the lamps were lighted, the court was a scene of\ngreat rejoicing. Gray-haired men, the priests of the temple and the\nrulers of the people, united in the festive dances to the sound of\ninstrumental music and the chants of the Levites.\nIn the illumination of Jerusalem, the people expressed their hope\nof the Messiah\u2019s coming to shed His light upon Israel. But to Jesus\nthe scene had a wider meaning. As the radiant lamps of the temple\nlighted up all about them, so Christ, the source of spiritual light,\nillumines the darkness of the world. Yet the symbol was imperfect.\nThat great light which His own hand had set in the heavens was a\ntruer representation of the glory of His mission.\nIt was morning; the sun had just risen above the Mount of Olives,\nand its rays fell with dazzling brightness on the marble palaces, and\nlighted up the gold of the temple walls, when Jesus, pointing to it,[464]\nsaid, \u201cI am the light of the world.\u201d\nBy one who listened to these words, they were long afterward\nre-echoed in that sublime passage, \u201cIn Him was life; and the life\nwas the light of men. And the light shineth in the darkness; and\nthe darkness apprehended it not.\u201d \u201cThat was the true light, which\nlighteth every man that cometh into the world.\u201d John 1:4, 5, R. V .,\n402\n\u201cThe Light of Life\u201d 403\n9. And long after Jesus had ascended to heaven, Peter also, writing\nunder the illumination of the divine Spirit, recalled the symbol Christ\nhad used: \u201cWe have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto\nye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark\nplace, until the day dawn, and the daystar arise in your hearts.\u201d 2\nPeter 1:19.\nIn the manifestation of God to His people, light had ever been\na symbol of His presence. At the creative word in the beginning,\nlight had shone out of darkness. Light had been enshrouded in the\npillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night, leading the vast\narmies of Israel. Light blazed with awful grandeur about the Lord\non Mount Sinai. Light rested over the mercy seat in the tabernacle.\nLight filled the temple of Solomon at its dedication. Light shone\non the hills of Bethlehem when the angels brought the message of\nredemption to the watching shepherds.\nGod is light; and in the words, \u201cI am the light of the world,\u201d\nChrist declared His oneness with God, and His relation to the whole\nhuman family. It was He who at the beginning had caused \u201cthe light\nto shine out of darkness.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:6. He is the light of sun\nand moon and star. He was the spiritual light that in symbol and type\nand prophecy had shone upon Israel. But not to the Jewish nation\nalone was the light given. As the sunbeams penetrate to the remotest\ncorners of the earth, so does the light of the Sun of Righteousness\nshine upon every soul.\n\u201cThat was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh\ninto the world.\u201d The world has had its great teachers, men of giant\nintellect and wonderful research, men whose utterances have stim-\nulated thought, and opened to view vast fields of knowledge; and\nthese men have been honored as guides and benefactors of their race.\nBut there is One who stands higher than they. \u201cAs many as received\nHim, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.\u201d \u201cNo man\nhath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, which is in the\nbosom of the Father, He hath declared Him.\u201d John 1:12, 18. We\ncan trace the line of the world\u2019s great teachers as far back as human\nrecords extend; but the Light was before them. As the moon and the [465]\nstars of the solar system shine by the reflected light of the sun, so, as\nfar as their teaching is true, do the world\u2019s great thinkers reflect the\nrays of the Sun of Righteousness. Every gem of thought, every flash\n404 The Desire of Ages\nof the intellect, is from the Light of the world. In these days we hear\nmuch about \u201chigher education.\u201d The true \u201chigher education\u201d is that\nimparted by Him \u201cin whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and\nknowledge.\u201d \u201cIn Him was life; and the life was the light of men.\u201d\nColossians 2:3; John 1:4. \u201cHe that followeth Me,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cshall\nnot walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\u201d\nIn the words, \u201cI am the light of the world,\u201d Jesus declared Him-\nself the Messiah. The aged Simeon, in the temple where Christ was\nnow teaching, had spoken of Him as \u201ca light to lighten the Gentiles,\nand the glory of Thy people Israel.\u201d Luke 2:32. In these words\nhe was applying to Him a prophecy familiar to all Israel. By the\nprophet Isaiah, the Holy Spirit had declared, \u201cIt is too light a thing\nthat Thou shouldest be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob,\nand to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give Thee for a\nlight to the Gentiles, that Thou mayest be My salvation unto the\nend of the earth.\u201d Isaiah 49:6, R. V . This prophecy was generally\nunderstood as spoken of the Messiah, and when Jesus said, \u201cI am\nthe light of the world,\u201d the people could not fail to recognize His\nclaim to be the Promised One.\nTo the Pharisees and rulers this claim seemed an arrogant as-\nsumption. That a man like themselves should make such pretensions\nthey could not tolerate. Seeming to ignore His words, they de-\nmanded, \u201cWho art Thou?\u201d They were bent upon forcing Him to\ndeclare Himself the Christ. His appearance and His work were so\nat variance with the expectations of the people, that, as His wily\nenemies believed, a direct announcement of Himself as the Messiah\nwould cause Him to be rejected as an impostor.\nBut to their question, \u201cWho art Thou?\u201d Jesus replied, \u201cEven that\nwhich I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.\u201d John 8:25,\nR.V . That which had been revealed in His words was revealed also\nin His character. He was the embodiment of the truths He taught.\n\u201cI do nothing of Myself,\u201d He continued; \u201cbut as My Father hath\ntaught Me, I speak these things. And He that sent Me is with Me:\nthe Father hath not left Me alone; for I do always those things that\nplease Him.\u201d He did not attempt to prove His Messianic claim, but\nshowed His unity with God. If their minds had been open to God\u2019s\nlove, they would have received Jesus.\nAmong His hearers many were drawn to Him in faith, and to[466]\n\u201cThe Light of Life\u201d 405\nthem He said, \u201cif ye continue in My word, then are ye My disciples\nindeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you\nfree.\u201d\nThese words offended the Pharisees. The nation\u2019s long subjec-\ntion to a foreign yoke, they disregarded, and angrily exclaimed, \u201cWe\nbe Abraham\u2019s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how\nsayest Thou, Ye shall be made free?\u201d Jesus looked upon these men,\nthe slaves of malice, whose thoughts were bent upon revenge, and\nsadly answered, \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever com-\nmitteth sin is the servant of sin.\u201d They were in the worst kind of\nbondage,\u2014ruled by the spirit of evil.\nEvery soul that refuses to give himself to God is under the control\nof another power. He is not his own. He may talk of freedom, but he\nis in the most abject slavery. He is not allowed to see the beauty of\ntruth, for his mind is under the control of Satan. While he flatters\nhimself that he is following the dictates of his own judgment, he\nobeys the will of the prince of darkness. Christ came to break the\nshackles of sin-slavery from the soul. \u201cIf the Son therefore shall\nmake you free, ye shall be free indeed.\u201d \u201cThe law of the Spirit of life\nin Christ Jesus\u201d sets us \u201cfree from the law of sin and death.\u201d Romans\n8:2.\nIn the work of redemption there is no compulsion. No external\nforce is employed. Under the influence of the Spirit of God, man\nis left free to choose whom he will serve. In the change that takes\nplace when the soul surrenders to Christ, there is the highest sense\nof freedom. The expulsion of sin is the act of the soul itself. True,\nwe have no power to free ourselves from Satan\u2019s control; but when\nwe desire to be set free from sin, and in our great need cry out for a\npower out of and above ourselves, the powers of the soul are imbued\nwith the divine energy of the Holy Spirit, and they obey the dictates\nof the will in fulfilling the will of God.\nThe only condition upon which the freedom of man is possible\nis that of becoming one with Christ. \u201cThe truth shall make you\nfree;\u201d and Christ is the truth. Sin can triumph only by enfeebling the\nmind, and destroying the liberty of the soul. Subjection to God is\nrestoration to one\u2019s self,\u2014to the true glory and dignity of man. The\ndivine law, to which we are brought into subjection, is \u201cthe law of\nliberty.\u201d James 2:12.\n406 The Desire of Ages\nThe Pharisees had declared themselves the children of Abraham.\nJesus told them that this claim could be established only by doing\nthe works of Abraham. The true children of Abraham would live,\nas he did, a life of obedience to God. They would not try to kill\nOne who was speaking the truth that was given Him from God.\nIn plotting against Christ, the rabbis were not doing the works of[467]\nAbraham. A mere lineal descent from Abraham was of no value.\nWithout a spiritual connection with him, which would be manifested\nin possessing the same spirit, and doing the same works, they were\nnot his children.\nThis principle bears with equal weight upon a question that\nhas long agitated the Christian world,\u2014the question of apostolic\nsuccession. Descent from Abraham was proved, not by name and\nlineage, but by likeness of character. So the apostolic succession\nrests not upon the transmission of ecclesiastical authority, but upon\nspiritual relationship. A life actuated by the apostles\u2019 spirit, the\nbelief and teaching of the truth they taught, this is the true evidence\nof apostolic succession. This is what constitutes men the successors\nof the first teachers of the gospel.\nJesus denied that the Jews were children of Abraham. He said,\n\u201cYe do the deeds of your father.\u201d In mockery they answered, \u201cWe\nbe not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.\u201d These\nwords, in allusion to the circumstances of His birth, were intended as\na thrust against Christ in the presence of those who were beginning\nto believe on Him. Jesus gave no heed to the base insinuation, but\nsaid, \u201cIf God were your Father, ye would love Me: for I proceeded\nforth and came from God.\u201d\nTheir works testified of their relationship to him who was a liar\nand a murderer. \u201cYe are of your father the devil,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cand\nthe lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer\nfrom the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because there is no\ntruth in him.... Because I say the truth, ye believe Me not.\u201d John\n8:44, 45, R. V . The fact that Jesus spoke the truth, and that with\ncertainty, was why He was not received by the Jewish leaders. It was\nthe truth that offended these self-righteous men. The truth exposed\nthe fallacy of error; it condemned their teaching and practice, and it\nwas unwelcome. They would rather close their eyes to the truth than\n\u201cThe Light of Life\u201d 407\nhumble themselves to confess that they had been in error. They did\nnot love the truth. They did not desire it, even though it was truth.\n\u201cWhich of you convicteth [Revised Version] Me of sin? And if\nI say the truth, why do ye not believe Me?\u201d Day by day for three\nyears His enemies had been following Christ, trying to find some\nstain in His character. Satan and all the confederacy of evil had\nbeen seeking to overcome Him; but they had found nothing in Him\nby which to gain an advantage. Even the devils were forced to\nconfess, \u201cThou art the Holy One of God.\u201d Mark 1:24. Jesus lived\nthe law in the sight of heaven, in the sight of unfallen worlds, and in [468]\nthe sight of sinful men. Before angels, men, and demons, He had\nspoken, unchallenged, words that from any other lips would have\nbeen blasphemy: \u201cI do always those things that please Him.\u201d\nThe fact that although they could find no sin in Christ the Jews\nwould not receive Him proved that they themselves had no connec-\ntion with God. They did not recognize His voice in the message of\nHis Son. They thought themselves passing judgment on Christ; but\nin rejecting Him they were pronouncing sentence upon themselves.\n\u201cHe that is of God,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cheareth God\u2019s words: ye therefore\nhear them not, because ye are not of God.\u201d\nThe lesson is true for all time. Many a man who delights to\nquibble, to criticize, seeking for something to question in the word\nof God, thinks that he is thereby giving evidence of independence\nof thought, and mental acuteness. He supposes that he is sitting\nin judgment on the Bible, when in truth he is judging himself. He\nmakes it manifest that he is incapable of appreciating truths that\noriginate in heaven, and that compass eternity. In presence of the\ngreat mountain of God\u2019s righteousness, his spirit is not awed. He\nbusies himself with hunting for sticks and straws, and in this betrays\na narrow and earthly nature, a heart that is fast losing its capacity to\nappreciate God. He whose heart has responded to the divine touch\nwill be seeking for that which will increase his knowledge of God,\nand will refine and elevate the character. As a flower turns to the\nsun, that the bright rays may touch it with tints of beauty, so will\nthe soul turn to the Sun of Righteousness, that heaven\u2019s light may\nbeautify the character with the graces of the character of Christ.\n408 The Desire of Ages\nJesus continued, drawing a sharp contrast between the position\nof the Jews and that of Abraham: \u201cYour father Abraham rejoiced to\nsee My day: and he saw it, and was glad.\u201d\nAbraham had greatly desired to see the promised Saviour. He\noffered up the most earnest prayer that before his death he might\nbehold the Messiah. And he saw Christ. A supernatural light was\ngiven him, and he acknowledged Christ\u2019s divine character. He saw\nHis day, and was glad. He was given a view of the divine sacrifice\nfor sin. Of this sacrifice he had an illustration in his own experience.\nThe command came to him, \u201cTake now thy son, thine only son Isaac,\nwhom thou lovest, ... and offer him ... for a burnt offering.\u201d Genesis\n22:2. Upon the altar of sacrifice he laid the son of promise, the son[469]\nin whom his hopes were centered. Then as he waited beside the\naltar with knife upraised to obey God, he heard a voice from heaven\nsaying, \u201cLay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything\nunto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast\nnot withheld thy son, thine only son from Me.\u201d Genesis 22:12. This\nterrible ordeal was imposed upon Abraham that he might see the day\nof Christ, and realize the great love of God for the world, so great\nthat to raise it from its degradation, He gave His only-begotten Son\nto a most shameful death.\nAbraham learned of God the greatest lesson ever given to mor-\ntal. His prayer that he might see Christ before he should die was\nanswered. He saw Christ; he saw all that mortal can see, and live.\nBy making an entire surrender, he was able to understand the vision\nof Christ, which had been given him. He was shown that in giving\nHis only-begotten Son to save sinners from eternal ruin, God was\nmaking a greater and more wonderful sacrifice than ever man could\nmake.\nAbraham\u2019s experience answered the question: \u201cWherewith shall\nI come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God?\nShall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year\nold? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with\nten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my\ntransgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?\u201d Micah\n6:6, 7. In the words of Abraham, \u201cMy son, God will provide Himself\na lamb for a burnt offering,\u201d (Genesis 22:8), and in God\u2019s provision\nof a sacrifice instead of Isaac, it was declared that no man could\n\u201cThe Light of Life\u201d 409\nmake expiation for himself. The pagan system of sacrifice was\nwholly unacceptable to God. No father was to offer up his son or\nhis daughter for a sin offering. The Son of God alone can bear the\nguilt of the world.\nThrough his own suffering, Abraham was enabled to behold\nthe Saviour\u2019s mission of sacrifice. But Israel would not understand\nthat which was so unwelcome to their proud hearts. Christ\u2019s words\nconcerning Abraham conveyed to His hearers no deep significance.\nThe Pharisees saw in them only fresh ground for caviling. They\nretorted with a sneer, as if they would prove Jesus to be a madman,\n\u201cThou art not yet fifty years old, and hast Thou seen Abraham?\u201d\nWith solemn dignity Jesus answered, \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto\nyou, Before Abraham was, I AM.\u201d\nSilence fell upon the vast assembly. The name of God, given to\nMoses to express the idea of the eternal presence, had been claimed\nas His own by this Galilean Rabbi. He had announced Himself to be [470]\nthe self-existent One, He who had been promised to Israel, \u201cwhose\ngoings forth have been from of old, from the days of eternity.\u201d Micah\n5:2, margin.\nAgain the priests and rabbis cried out against Jesus as a blas-\nphemer. His claim to be one with God had before stirred them to\ntake His life, and a few months later they plainly declared, \u201cFor a\ngood work we stone Thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that\nThou, being a man, makest Thyself God.\u201d John 10:33. Because He\nwas, and avowed Himself to be, the Son of God, they were bent on\ndestroying Him. Now many of the people, siding with the priests\nand rabbis, took up stones to cast at Him. \u201cBut Jesus hid Himself,\nand went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so\npassed by.\u201d\nThe Light was shining in darkness; but \u201cthe darkness appre-\nhended it not.\u201d John 1:5, R. V .\n\u201cAs Jesus passed by, He saw a man which was blind from his\nbirth. And His disciples asked Him, saying, Master, who did sin,\nthis man, or his parents, that he was born blind? Jesus answered,\nNeither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of\nGod should be made manifest in him.... When He had thus spoken,\nHe spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and He anointed\nthe eyes of the blind man with the clay, and said unto him, Go, wash\n410 The Desire of Ages\nin the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went\nhis way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.\u201d\nIt was generally believed by the Jews that sin is punished in this[471]\nlife. Every affliction was regarded as the penalty of some wrongdo-\ning, either of the sufferer himself or of his parents. It is true that all\nsuffering results from the transgression of God\u2019s law, but this truth\nhad become perverted. Satan, the author of sin and all its results,\nhad led men to look upon disease and death as proceeding from\nGod,\u2014as punishment arbitrarily inflicted on account of sin. Hence\none upon whom some great affliction or calamity had fallen had the\nadditional burden of being regarded as a great sinner.\nThus the way was prepared for the Jews to reject Jesus. He who\n\u201chath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows\u201d was looked upon by\nthe Jews as \u201cstricken, smitten of God, and afflicted;\u201d and they hid\ntheir faces from Him. Isaiah 53:4, 3.\nGod had given a lesson designed to prevent this. The history of\nJob had shown that suffering is inflicted by Satan, and is overruled\nby God for purposes of mercy. But Israel did not understand the\nlesson. The same error for which God had reproved the friends of\nJob was repeated by the Jews in their rejection of Christ.\nThe belief of the Jews in regard to the relation of sin and suffering\nwas held by Christ\u2019s disciples. While Jesus corrected their error, He\ndid not explain the cause of the man\u2019s affliction, but told them what\nwould be the result. Because of it the works of God would be made\nmanifest. \u201cAs long as I am in the world,\u201d He said, \u201cI am the light of\nthe world.\u201d Then having anointed the eyes of the blind man, He sent\nhim to wash in the pool of Siloam, and the man\u2019s sight was restored.\nThus Jesus answered the question of the disciples in a practical way,\nas He usually answered questions put to Him from curiosity. The\ndisciples were not called upon to discuss the question as to who had\nsinned or had not sinned, but to understand the power and mercy of\nGod in giving sight to the blind. It was evident that there was no\nhealing virtue in the clay, or in the pool wherein the blind man was\nsent to wash, but that the virtue was in Christ.\nThe Pharisees could not but be astonished at the cure. Yet they\nwere more than ever filled with hatred; for the miracle had been\nperformed on the Sabbath day.\n\u201cThe Light of Life\u201d 411\nThe neighbors of the young man, and those who knew him\nbefore in his blindness, said, \u201cIs not this he that sat and begged?\u201d\nThey looked upon him with doubt; for when his eyes were opened,\nhis countenance was changed and brightened, and he appeared like\nanother man. From one to another the question passed. Some said, [472]\n\u201cThis is he;\u201d others, \u201cHe is like him.\u201d But he who had received the\ngreat blessing settled the question by saying, \u201cI am he.\u201d He then\ntold them of Jesus, and by what means he had been healed, and they\ninquired, \u201cWhere is He? He said, I know not.\u201d\nThen they brought him before a council of the Pharisees. Again\nthe man was asked how he had received his sight. \u201cHe said unto\nthem, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. There-\nfore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because He\nkeepeth not the Sabbath day.\u201d The Pharisees hoped to make Jesus\nout to be a sinner, and therefore not the Messiah. They knew not that\nit was He who had made the Sabbath and knew all its obligation,\nwho had healed the blind man. They appeared wonderfully zealous\nfor the observance of the Sabbath, yet were planning murder on that\nvery day. But many were greatly moved at hearing of this miracle,\nand were convicted that He who had opened the eyes of the blind\nwas more than a common man. In answer to the charge that Jesus\nwas a sinner because He kept not the Sabbath day, they said, \u201cHow\ncan a man that is a sinner do such miracles?\u201d\nAgain the rabbis appealed to the blind man, \u201cWhat sayest thou of\nHim, that He hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.\u201d The\nPharisees then asserted that he had not been born blind and received\nhis sight. They called for his parents, and asked them, saying, \u201cIs\nthis your son, who ye say was born blind?\u201d\nThere was the man himself, declaring that he had been blind,\nand had had his sight restored; but the Pharisees would rather deny\nthe evidence of their own senses than admit that they were in error.\nSo powerful is prejudice, so distorting is Pharisaical righteousness.\nThe Pharisees had one hope left, and that was to intimidate the\nman\u2019s parents. With apparent sincerity they asked, \u201cHow then doth\nhe now see?\u201d The parents feared to compromise themselves; for\nit had been declared that whoever should acknowledge Jesus as\nthe Christ should be \u201cput out of the synagogue;\u201d that is, should be\nexcluded from the synagogue for thirty days. During this time no\n412 The Desire of Ages\nchild could be circumcised nor dead be lamented in the offender\u2019s\nhome. The sentence was regarded as a great calamity; and if it failed\nto produce repentance, a far heavier penalty followed. The great\nwork wrought for their son had brought conviction to the parents, yet\nthey answered, \u201cWe know that this is our son, and that he was born\nblind: but by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath[473]\nopened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak\nfor himself.\u201d Thus they shifted all responsibility from themselves to\ntheir son; for they dared not confess Christ.\nThe dilemma in which the Pharisees were placed, their ques-\ntioning and prejudice, their unbelief in the facts of the case, were\nopening the eyes of the multitude, especially of the common people.\nJesus had frequently wrought His miracles in the open street, and His\nwork was always of a character to relieve suffering. The question\nin many minds was, Would God do such mighty works through an\nimpostor, as the Pharisees insisted that Jesus was? The controversy\nwas becoming very earnest on both sides.\nThe Pharisees saw that they were giving publicity to the work\ndone by Jesus. They could not deny the miracle. The blind man\nwas filled with joy and gratitude; he beheld the wondrous things of\nnature, and was filled with delight at the beauty of earth and sky. He\nfreely related his experience, and again they tried to silence him,\nsaying, \u201cGive God the praise: we know that this Man is a sinner.\u201d\nThat is, Do not say again that this Man gave you sight; it is God who\nhas done this.\nThe blind man answered, \u201cWhether He be a sinner or no, I know\nnot: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.\u201d\nThen they questioned again, \u201cWhat did He to thee? how opened\nHe thine eyes?\u201d With many words they tried to confuse him, so that\nhe might think himself deluded. Satan and his evil angels were on\nthe side of the Pharisees, and united their energies and subtlety with\nman\u2019s reasoning in order to counteract the influence of Christ. They\nblunted the convictions that were deepening in many minds. Angels\nof God were also on the ground to strengthen the man who had had\nhis sight restored.\nThe Pharisees did not realize that they had to deal with any other[474]\nthan the uneducated man who had been born blind; they knew not\nHim with whom they were in controversy. Divine light shone into\n\u201cThe Light of Life\u201d 413\nthe chambers of the blind man\u2019s soul. As these hypocrites tried\nto make him disbelieve, God helped him to show, by the vigor\nand pointedness of his replies, that he was not to be ensnared. He\nanswered, \u201cI have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore\nwould ye hear it again? will ye also be His disciples? Then they\nreviled him, and said, Thou art His disciple; but we are Moses\u2019\ndisciples. We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow,\nwe know not from whence He is.\u201d\nThe Lord Jesus knew the ordeal through which the man was\npassing, and He gave him grace and utterance, so that he became a\nwitness for Christ. He answered the Pharisees in words that were a\ncutting rebuke to his questioners. They claimed to be the expositors\nof Scripture, the religious guides of the nation; and yet here was\nOne performing miracles, and they were confessedly ignorant as to\nthe source of His power, and as to His character and claims. \u201cWhy\nherein is a marvelous thing,\u201d said the man, \u201cthat ye know not from\nwhence He is, and yet He hath opened mine eyes. Now we know\nthat God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshiper of God,\nand doeth His will, him He heareth. Since the world began was it\nnot heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.\nIf this Man were not of God, He could do nothing.\u201d\nThe man had met his inquisitors on their own ground. His\nreasoning was unanswerable. The Pharisees were astonished, and\nthey held their peace,\u2014spellbound before his pointed, determined\nwords. For a few moments there was silence. Then the frowning\npriests and rabbis gathered about them their robes, as though they\nfeared contamination from contact with him; they shook off the\ndust from their feet, and hurled denunciations against him,\u2014\u201cThou\nwast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us?\u201d And they\nexcommunicated him.\nJesus heard what had been done; and finding him soon after, He\nsaid, \u201cDost thou believe on the Son of God?\u201d\nFor the first time the blind man looked upon the face of his\nRestorer. Before the council he had seen his parents troubled and\nperplexed; he had looked upon the frowning faces of the rabbis;\nnow his eyes rested upon the loving, peaceful countenance of Jesus.\nAlready, at great cost to himself, he had acknowledged Him as a\ndelegate of divine power; now a higher revelation was granted him.\n414 The Desire of Ages\nTo the Saviour\u2019s question, \u201cDost thou believe on the Son of[475]\nGod?\u201d the blind man replied by asking, \u201cWho is He, Lord, that\nI might believe on Him?\u201d And Jesus said, \u201cThou hast both seen\nHim, and it is He that talketh with thee.\u201d The man cast himself at\nthe Saviour\u2019s feet in worship. Not only had his natural sight been\nrestored, but the eyes of his understanding had been opened. Christ\nhad been revealed to his soul, and he received Him as the Sent of\nGod.\nA group of Pharisees had gathered near, and the sight of them\nbrought to the mind of Jesus the contrast ever manifest in the effect\nof His words and works. He said, \u201cFor judgment I am come into\nthis world, that they which see not might see; and that they which\nsee might be made blind.\u201d Christ had come to open the blind eyes,\nto give light to them that sit in darkness. He had declared Himself\nto be the light of the world, and the miracle just performed was in\nattestation of His mission. The people who beheld the Saviour at\nHis advent were favored with a fuller manifestation of the divine\npresence than the world had ever enjoyed before. The knowledge\nof God was revealed more perfectly. But in this very revelation,\njudgment was passing upon men. Their character was tested, their\ndestiny determined.\nThe manifestation of divine power that had given to the blind\nman both natural and spiritual sight had left the Pharisees in yet\ndeeper darkness. Some of His hearers, feeling that Christ\u2019s words\napplied to them, inquired, \u201cAre we blind also?\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cIf\nye were blind, ye should have no sin.\u201d If God had made it impossible\nfor you to see the truth, your ignorance would involve no guilt.\n\u201cBut now ye say, We see.\u201d You believe yourselves able to see, and\nreject the means through which alone you could receive sight. To\nall who realized their need, Christ came with infinite help. But the\nPharisees would confess no need; they refused to come to Christ,\nand hence they were left in blindness,\u2014a blindness for which they\nwere themselves guilty. Jesus said, \u201cYour sin remaineth.\u201d\nChapter 52\u2014The Divine Shepherd [476]\nThis chapter is based on John 10:1-30.\n\u201cI am the Good Shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for\nthe sheep.\u201d \u201cI am the Good Shepherd, and know My sheep, and am\nknown of Mine. As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the\nFather: and I lay down My life for the sheep.\u201d\nAgain Jesus found access to the minds of His hearers by the\npathway of their familiar associations. He had likened the Spirit\u2019s\ninfluence to the cool, refreshing water. He had represented Himself\nas the light, the source of life and gladness to nature and to man.\nNow in a beautiful pastoral picture He represents His relation to\nthose that believe on Him. No picture was more familiar to His\nhearers than this, and Christ\u2019s words linked it forever with Himself.\nNever could the disciples look on the shepherds tending their flocks\nwithout recalling the Saviour\u2019s lesson. They would see Christ in\neach faithful shepherd. They would see themselves in each helpless\nand dependent flock.\nThis figure the prophet Isaiah had applied to the Messiah\u2019s mis-\nsion, in the comforting words, \u201cO Zion, that bringest good tidings,\nget thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good\ntidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say\nunto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! ... He shall feed His\nflock like a shepherd: He shall gather the lambs with His arm, and\ncarry them in His bosom.\u201d Isaiah 40:9-11. David had sung, \u201cThe\nLord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\u201d Psalm 23:1. And the Holy [477]\nSpirit through Ezekiel had declared: \u201cI will set up one Shepherd\nover them, and He shall feed them.\u201d \u201cI will seek that which was lost,\nand bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that\nwhich was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick.\u201d \u201cAnd I\nwill make with them a covenant of peace.\u201d \u201cAnd they shall no more\nbe a prey to the heathen; ... but they shall dwell safely, and none\nshall make them afraid.\u201d Ezekiel 34:23, 16, 25, 28.\n415\n416 The Desire of Ages\nChrist applied these prophecies to Himself, and He showed the\ncontrast between His own character and that of the leaders in Israel.\nThe Pharisees had just driven one from the fold, because he dared to\nbear witness to the power of Christ. They had cut off a soul whom\nthe True Shepherd was drawing to Himself. In this they had shown\nthemselves ignorant of the work committed to them, and unworthy\nof their trust as shepherds of the flock. Jesus now set before them\nthe contrast between them and the Good Shepherd, and He pointed\nto Himself as the real keeper of the Lord\u2019s flock. Before doing this,\nhowever, He speaks of Himself under another figure.\nHe said, \u201cHe that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but\nclimbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But\nhe that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.\u201d The\nPharisees did not discern that these words were spoken against them.\nWhen they reasoned in their hearts as to the meaning, Jesus told\nthem plainly, \u201cI am the door: by Me if any man enter in, he shall be\nsaved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh\nnot, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they\nmight have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\u201d\nChrist is the door to the fold of God. Through this door all His\nchildren, from the earliest times, have found entrance. In Jesus,\nas shown in types, as shadowed in symbols, as manifested in the\nrevelation of the prophets, as unveiled in the lessons given to His\ndisciples, and in the miracles wrought for the sons of men, they have\nbeheld \u201cthe Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\u201d\n(John 1:29), and through Him they are brought within the fold of\nHis grace. Many have come presenting other objects for the faith\nof the world; ceremonies and systems have been devised by which\nmen hope to receive justification and peace with God, and thus find\nentrance to His fold. But the only door is Christ, and all who have\ninterposed something to take the place of Christ, all who have tried[478]\nto enter the fold in some other way, are thieves and robbers.\nThe Pharisees had not entered by the door. They had climbed\ninto the fold by another way than Christ, and they were not fulfilling\nthe work of the true shepherd. The priests and rulers, the scribes and\nPharisees, destroyed the living pastures, and defiled the wellsprings\nof the water of life. Faithfully do the words of inspiration describe\nthose false shepherds: \u201cThe diseased have ye not strengthened,\nDivine Shepherd 417\nneither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound\nup that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which\nwas driven away; ... but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled\nthem.\u201d Ezekiel 34:4.\nIn all ages, philosophers and teachers have been presenting to\nthe world theories by which to satisfy the soul\u2019s need. Every heathen\nnation has had its great teachers and religious systems offering some\nother means of redemption than Christ, turning the eyes of men away\nfrom the Father\u2019s face, and filling their hearts with fear of Him who\nhas given them only blessing. The trend of their work is to rob God\nof that which is His own, both by creation and by redemption. And\nthese false teachers rob man as well. Millions of human beings are\nbound down under false religions, in the bondage of slavish fear, of\nstolid indifference, toiling like beasts of burden, bereft of hope or\njoy or aspiration here, and with only a dull fear of the hereafter. It\nis the gospel of the grace of God alone that can uplift the soul. The\ncontemplation of the love of God manifested in His Son will stir the\nheart and arouse the powers of the soul as nothing else can. Christ\ncame that He might re-create the image of God in man; and whoever\nturns men away from Christ is turning them away from the source\nof true development; he is defrauding them of the hope and purpose\nand glory of life. He is a thief and a robber.\n\u201cHe that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.\u201d\nChrist is both the door and the shepherd. He enters in by Himself.\nIt is through His own sacrifice that He becomes the shepherd of the\nsheep. \u201cTo Him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear His voice:\nand He calleth His own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And\nwhen He putteth forth His own sheep, He goeth before them, and\nthe sheep follow Him: for they know His voice.\u201d\nOf all creatures the sheep is one of the most timid and helpless,\nand in the East the shepherd\u2019s care for his flock is untiring and\nincessant. Anciently as now there was little security outside of the [479]\nwalled towns. Marauders from the roving border tribes, or beasts\nof prey from their hiding places in the rocks, lay in wait to plunder\nthe flocks. The shepherd watched his charge, knowing that it was\nat the peril of his own life. Jacob, who kept the flocks of Laban in\nthe pasture grounds of Haran, describing his own unwearied labor,\nsaid, \u201cIn the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night;\n418 The Desire of Ages\nand my sleep departed from mine eyes.\u201d Genesis 31:40. And it was\nwhile guarding his father\u2019s sheep that the boy David, single-handed,\nencountered the lion and the bear, and rescued from their teeth the\nstolen lamb.\nAs the shepherd leads his flock over the rocky hills, through\nforest and wild ravines, to grassy nooks by the riverside; as he\nwatches them on the mountains through the lonely night, shielding\nfrom robbers, caring tenderly for the sickly and feeble, his life comes\nto be one with theirs. A strong and tender attachment unites him to\nthe objects of his care. However large the flock, the shepherd knows\nevery sheep. Every one has its name, and responds to the name at\nthe shepherd\u2019s call.\nAs an earthly shepherd knows his sheep, so does the divine\nShepherd know His flock that are scattered throughout the world.\n\u201cYe My flock, the flock of My pasture, are men, and I am your God,\nsaith the Lord God.\u201d Jesus says, \u201cI have called thee by thy name;\nthou art Mine.\u201d \u201cI have graven thee upon the palms of My hands.\u201d\nEzekiel 34:31; Isaiah 43:1; 49:16.\nJesus knows us individually, and is touched with the feeling of\nour infirmities. He knows us all by name. He knows the very house\nin which we live, the name of each occupant. He has at times given\ndirections to His servants to go to a certain street in a certain city, to\nsuch a house, to find one of His sheep.\nEvery soul is as fully known to Jesus as if he were the only one[480]\nfor whom the Saviour died. The distress of every one touches His\nheart. The cry for aid reaches His ear. He came to draw all men unto\nHimself. He bids them, \u201cFollow Me,\u201d and His Spirit moves upon\ntheir hearts to draw them to come to Him. Many refuse to be drawn.\nJesus knows who they are. He also knows who gladly hear His call,\nand are ready to come under His pastoral care. He says, \u201cMy sheep\nhear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.\u201d He cares for\neach one as if there were not another on the face of the earth.\n\u201cHe calleth His own sheep by name, and leadeth them out....\nAnd the sheep follow Him: for they know His voice.\u201d The Eastern\nshepherd does not drive his sheep. He depends not upon force or\nfear; but going before, he calls them. They know his voice, and\nobey the call. So does the Saviour-Shepherd with His sheep. The\nScripture says, \u201cThou leddest Thy people like a flock by the hand\nDivine Shepherd 419\nof Moses and Aaron.\u201d Through the prophet, Jesus declares, \u201cI have\nloved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving-kindness\nhave I drawn thee.\u201d He compels none to follow Him. \u201cI drew them,\u201d\nHe says, \u201cwith cords of a man, with bands of love.\u201d Psalm 77:20;\nJeremiah 31:3; Hosea 11:4.\nIt is not the fear of punishment, or the hope of everlasting reward,\nthat leads the disciples of Christ to follow Him. They behold the\nSaviour\u2019s matchless love, revealed throughout His pilgrimage on\nearth, from the manger of Bethlehem to Calvary\u2019s cross, and the\nsight of Him attracts, it softens and subdues the soul. Love awakens\nin the heart of the beholders. They hear His voice, and they follow\nHim.\nAs the shepherd goes before his sheep, himself first encountering\nthe perils of the way, so does Jesus with His people. \u201cWhen He\nputteth forth His own sheep, He goeth before them.\u201d The way to\nheaven is consecrated by the Saviour\u2019s footprints. The path may\nbe steep and rugged, but Jesus has traveled that way; His feet have\npressed down the cruel thorns, to make the pathway easier for us.\nEvery burden that we are called to bear He Himself has borne.\nThough now He has ascended to the presence of God, and shares\nthe throne of the universe, Jesus has lost none of His compassionate\nnature. Today the same tender, sympathizing heart is open to all the\nwoes of humanity. Today the hand that was pierced is reached forth\nto bless more abundantly His people that are in the world. \u201cAnd they\nshall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand.\u201d\nThe soul that has given himself to Christ is more precious in His [481]\n[482]\n[483]\nsight than the whole world. The Saviour would have passed through\nthe agony of Calvary that one might be saved in His kingdom. He\nwill never abandon one for whom He has died. Unless His followers\nchoose to leave Him, He will hold them fast.\nThrough all our trials we have a never-failing Helper. He does\nnot leave us alone to struggle with temptation, to battle with evil,\nand be finally crushed with burdens and sorrow. Though now He\nis hidden from mortal sight, the ear of faith can hear His voice\nsaying, Fear not; I am with you. \u201cI am He that liveth, and was\ndead; and, behold, I am alive forevermore.\u201d Revelation 1:18. I have\nendured your sorrows, experienced your struggles, encountered your\ntemptations. I know your tears; I also have wept. The griefs that\n420 The Desire of Ages\nlie too deep to be breathed into any human ear, I know. Think not\nthat you are desolate and forsaken. Though your pain touch no\nresponsive chord in any heart on earth, look unto Me, and live. \u201cThe\nmountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but My kindness\nshall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of My peace\nbe removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.\u201d Isaiah 54:10.\nHowever much a shepherd may love his sheep, he loves his\nsons and daughters more. Jesus is not only our shepherd; He is our\n\u201ceverlasting Father.\u201d And He says, \u201cI know Mine own, and Mine own\nknow Me, even as the Father knoweth Me, and I know the Father.\u201d\nJohn 10:14, 15, R. V . What a statement is this!\u2014the only-begotten\nSon, He who is in the bosom of the Father, He whom God has\ndeclared to be \u201cthe Man that is My fellow\u201d (Zechariah 13:7),\u2014the\ncommunion between Him and the eternal God is taken to represent\nthe communion between Christ and His children on the earth!\nBecause we are the gift of His Father, and the reward of His\nwork, Jesus loves us. He loves us as His children. Reader, He\nloves you. Heaven itself can bestow nothing greater, nothing better.\nTherefore trust.\nJesus thought upon the souls all over the earth who were misled\nby false shepherds. Those whom He longed to gather as the sheep\nof His pasture were scattered among wolves, and He said, \u201cOther\nsheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring,\nand they shall hear My voice; and they shall become one flock, one\nshepherd.\u201d John 10:16, R. V .\n\u201cTherefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down My\nlife, that I might take it again.\u201d That is, My Father has so loved you,\nthat He even loves Me more for giving My life to redeem you. In[484]\nbecoming your substitute and surety, by surrendering My life, by\ntaking your liabilities, your transgressions, I am endeared to My\nFather.\n\u201cI lay down My life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it\nfrom Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down,\nand I have power to take it again.\u201d While as a member of the human\nfamily He was mortal, as God He was the fountain of life for the\nworld. He could have withstood the advances of death, and refused\nto come under its dominion; but voluntarily He laid down His life,\nthat He might bring life and immortality to light. He bore the sin of\nDivine Shepherd 421\nthe world, endured its curse, yielded up His life as a sacrifice, that\nmen might not eternally die. \u201cSurely He hath borne our griefs, and\ncarried our sorrows.... He was wounded for our transgressions, He\nwas bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was\nupon Him; and with His stripes we are healed. All we like sheep\nhave gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the\nLord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all.\u201d Isaiah 53:4-6.\nChapter 53\u2014The Last Journey From Galilee[485]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 9:51-56; Luke 10:1-24.\nAs the close of His ministry drew near, there was a change in\nChrist\u2019s manner of labor. Heretofore He had sought to shun excite-\nment and publicity. He had refused the homage of the people, and\nhad passed quickly from place to place when the popular enthusiasm\nin His favor seemed kindling beyond control. Again and again He\nhad commanded that none should declare Him to be the Christ.\nAt the time of the Feast of Tabernacles His journey to Jerusalem\nwas made swiftly and secretly. When urged by His brothers to\npresent Himself publicly as the Messiah, His answer was, \u201cMy\ntime is not yet come.\u201d John 7:6. He made His way to Jerusalem\nunobserved, and entered the city unannounced, and unhonored by\nthe multitude. But not so with His last journey. He had left Jerusalem\nfor a season because of the malice of the priests and rabbis. But\nHe now set out to return, traveling in the most public manner, by\na circuitous route, and preceded by such an announcement of His\ncoming as He had never made before. He was going forward to the\nscene of His great sacrifice, and to this the attention of the people\nmust be directed.\n\u201cAs Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must\nthe Son of man be lifted up.\u201d John 3:14. As the eyes of all Israel\nhad been directed to the uplifted serpent, the symbol appointed for\ntheir healing, so all eyes must be drawn to Christ, the sacrifice that\nbrought salvation to the lost world.\nIt was a false conception of the Messiah\u2019s work, and a lack of\nfaith in the divine character of Jesus, that had led His brothers to[486]\nurge Him to present Himself publicly to the people at the Feast\nof Tabernacles. Now, in a spirit akin to this, the disciples would\nhave prevented Him from making the journey to Jerusalem. They\nremembered His words concerning what was to befall Him there,\n422\nLast Journey From Galilee 423\nthey knew the deadly hostility of the religious leaders, and they\nwould fain have dissuaded their Master from going thither.\nTo the heart of Christ it was a bitter task to press His way against\nthe fears, disappointment, and unbelief of His beloved disciples. It\nwas hard to lead them forward to the anguish and despair that awaited\nthem at Jerusalem. And Satan was at hand to press his temptations\nupon the Son of man. Why should He now go to Jerusalem, to\ncertain death? All around Him were souls hungering for the bread\nof life. On every hand were suffering ones waiting for His word\nof healing. The work to be wrought by the gospel of His grace\nwas but just begun. And He was full of the vigor of manhood\u2019s\nprime. Why not go forward to the vast fields of the world with the\nwords of His grace, the touch of His healing power? Why not take\nto Himself the joy of giving light and gladness to those darkened\nand sorrowing millions? Why leave the harvest gathering to His\ndisciples, so weak in faith, so dull of understanding, so slow to act?\nWhy face death now, and leave the work in its infancy? The foe who\nin the wilderness had confronted Christ assailed Him now with fierce\nand subtle temptations. Had Jesus yielded for a moment, had He\nchanged His course in the least particular to save Himself, Satan\u2019s\nagencies would have triumphed, and the world would have been lost.\nBut Jesus had \u201csteadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem.\u201d The\none law of His life was the Father\u2019s will. In the visit to the temple in\nHis boyhood, He had said to Mary, \u201cWist ye not that I must be about\nMy Father\u2019s business?\u201d Luke 2:49. At Cana, when Mary desired\nHim to reveal His miraculous power, His answer was, \u201cMine hour\nis not yet come.\u201d John 2:4. With the same words He replied to His\nbrothers when they urged Him to go to the feast. But in God\u2019s great\nplan the hour had been appointed for the offering of Himself for the\nsins of men, and that hour was soon to strike. He would not fail nor\nfalter. His steps are turned toward Jerusalem, where His foes have\nlong plotted to take His life; now He will lay it down. He set His face\nsteadfastly to go to persecution, denial, rejection, condemnation,\nand death.\nAnd He \u201csent messengers before His face: and they went, and\nentered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for Him.\u201d\nBut the people refused to receive Him, because He was on His [487]\nway to Jerusalem. This they interpreted as meaning that Christ\n424 The Desire of Ages\nshowed a preference for the Jews, whom they hated with intense\nbitterness. Had He come to restore the temple and worship upon\nMount Gerizim, they would gladly have received Him; but He was\ngoing to Jerusalem, and they would show Him no hospitality. Little\ndid they realize that they were turning from their doors the best gift\nof heaven. Jesus invited men to receive Him, He asked favors at\ntheir hands, that He might come near to them, to bestow the richest\nblessings. For every favor manifested toward Him, He requited a\nmore precious grace. But all was lost to the Samaritans because of\ntheir prejudice and bigotry.\nJames and John, Christ\u2019s messengers, were greatly annoyed at\nthe insult shown to their Lord. They were filled with indignation\nbecause He had been so rudely treated by the Samaritans whom\nHe was honoring by His presence. They had recently been with\nHim on the mount of transfiguration, and had seen Him glorified by\nGod, and honored by Moses and Elijah. This manifest dishonor on\nthe part of the Samaritans, should not, they thought, be passed over\nwithout marked punishment.\nComing to Christ, they reported to Him the words of the people,\ntelling Him that they had even refused to give Him a night\u2019s lodging.\nThey thought that a grievous wrong had been done Him, and seeing\nMount Carmel in the distance, where Elijah had slain the false\nprophets, they said, \u201cWilt Thou that we command fire to come down\nfrom heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?\u201d They were\nsurprised to see that Jesus was pained by their words, and still more\nsurprised as His rebuke fell upon their ears, \u201cYe know not what\nmanner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy\nmen\u2019s lives, but to save them.\u201d And He went to another village.\nIt is no part of Christ\u2019s mission to compel men to receive Him.\nIt is Satan, and men actuated by his spirit, that seek to compel the\nconscience. Under a pretense of zeal for righteousness, men who\nare confederate with evil angels bring suffering upon their fellow\nmen, in order to convert them to their ideas of religion; but Christ\nis ever showing mercy, ever seeking to win by the revealing of His\nlove. He can admit no rival in the soul, nor accept of partial service;\nbut He desires only voluntary service, the willing surrender of the\nheart under the constraint of love. There can be no more conclusive\nevidence that we possess the spirit of Satan than the disposition to\nLast Journey From Galilee 425\nhurt and destroy those who do not appreciate our work, or who act\ncontrary to our ideas.\nEvery human being, in body, soul, and spirit, is the property of [488]\nGod. Christ died to redeem all. Nothing can be more offensive to\nGod than for men, through religious bigotry, to bring suffering upon\nthose who are the purchase of the Saviour\u2019s blood.\n\u201cAnd He arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judea\nby the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto Him again;\nand, as He was wont, He taught them again.\u201d Mark 10:1.\nA considerable part of the closing months of Christ\u2019s ministry\nwas spent in Perea, the province on \u201cthe farther side of Jordan\u201d\nfrom Judea. Here the multitude thronged His steps, as in His early\nministry in Galilee, and much of His former teaching was repeated.\nAs He had sent out the twelve, so He \u201cappointed seventy others,\nand sent them two and two before His face into every city and place,\nwhither He Himself was about to come.\u201d Luke 10:1, R. V . These\ndisciples had been for some time with Him, in training for their\nwork. When the twelve were sent out on their first separate mission,\nother disciples accompanied Jesus in His journey through Galilee.\nThus they had the privilege of intimate association with Him, and\ndirect personal instruction. Now this larger number also were to go\nforth on a separate mission.\nThe directions to the seventy were similar to those that had been\ngiven to the twelve; but the command to the twelve, not to enter into\nany city of the Gentiles or of the Samaritans, was not given to the\nseventy. Though Christ had just been repulsed by the Samaritans,\nHis love toward them was unchanged. When the seventy went forth\nin His name, they visited, first of all, the cities of Samaria.\nThe Saviour\u2019s own visit to Samaria, and later, the commendation\nof the good Samaritan, and the grateful joy of that leper, a Samaritan,\nwho alone of the ten returned to give thanks to Christ, were full of\nsignificance to the disciples. The lesson sank deep into their hearts.\nIn His commission to them, just before His ascension, Jesus men-\ntioned Samaria with Jerusalem and Judea as the places where they\nwere first to preach the gospel. This commission His teaching had\nprepared them to fulfill. When in their Master\u2019s name they went to\nSamaria, they found the people ready to receive them. The Samari-\ntans had heard of Christ\u2019s words of commendation and His works of\n426 The Desire of Ages\nmercy for men of their nation. They saw that, notwithstanding their\nrude treatment of Him, He had only thoughts of love toward them,\nand their hearts were won. After His ascension they welcomed the\nSaviour\u2019s messengers, and the disciples gathered a precious harvest\nfrom among those who had once been their bitterest enemies. \u201cA[489]\nbruised reed shall He not break, and the dimly burning flax shall He\nnot quench: He shall bring forth judgment unto truth.\u201d \u201cAnd in His\nname shall the Gentiles trust.\u201d Isaiah 42:3, margin; Matthew 12:21.\nIn sending out the seventy, Jesus bade them, as He had bidden\nthe twelve, not to urge their presence where they were unwelcome.\n\u201cInto whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not,\u201d He said,\n\u201cgo your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, Even the\nvery dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against\nyou: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God\nis come nigh unto you.\u201d They were not to do this from motives of\nresentment or through wounded dignity, but to show how grievous a\nthing it is to refuse the Lord\u2019s message or His messengers. To reject\nthe Lord\u2019s servants is to reject Christ Himself.\n\u201cI say unto you,\u201d Jesus added, \u201cthat it shall be more tolerable in\nthat day for Sodom, than for that city.\u201d Then His mind reverted to the\nGalilean towns where so much of His ministry had been spent. In\ndeeply sorrowful accents He exclaimed, \u201cWoe unto thee, Chorazin!\nwoe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done\nin Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great\nwhile ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. But it shall be\nmore tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.\nAnd thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust\ndown to hell.\u201d\nTo those busy towns about the Sea of Galilee, heaven\u2019s richest\nblessings had been freely offered. Day after day the Prince of life\nhad gone in and out among them. The glory of God, which prophets\nand kings had longed to see, had shone upon the multitudes that\nthronged the Saviour\u2019s steps. Yet they had refused the heavenly Gift.\nWith a great show of prudence the rabbis had warned the peo-\nple against receiving the new doctrines taught by this new teacher;\nfor His theories and practices were contrary to the teachings of the\nfathers. The people gave credence to what the priests and Phar-\nisees taught, in place of seeking to understand the word of God for\nLast Journey From Galilee 427\nthemselves. They honored the priests and rulers instead of honoring\nGod, and rejected the truth that they might keep their own traditions.\nMany had been impressed and almost persuaded; but they did not\nact upon their convictions, and were not reckoned on the side of\nChrist. Satan presented his temptations, until the light appeared as\ndarkness. Thus many rejected the truth that would have proved the\nsaving of the soul.\nThe True Witness says, \u201cBehold, I stand at the door, and knock.\u201d\nRevelation 3:20. Every warning, reproof, and entreaty in the word\nof God or through His messengers is a knock at the door of the [490]\nheart. It is the voice of Jesus asking for entrance. With every\nknock unheeded, the disposition to open becomes weaker. The\nimpressions of the Holy Spirit if disregarded today, will not be as\nstrong tomorrow. The heart becomes less impressible, and lapses\ninto a perilous unconsciousness of the shortness of life, and of the\ngreat eternity beyond. Our condemnation in the judgment will not\nresult from the fact that we have been in error, but from the fact that\nwe have neglected heaven-sent opportunities for learning what is\ntruth.\nLike the apostles, the seventy had received supernatural endow-\nments as a seal of their mission. When their work was completed,\nthey returned with joy, saying, \u201cLord, even the devils are subject\nunto us through Thy name.\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cI beheld Satan as\nlightning fall from heaven.\u201d\nThe scenes of the past and the future were presented to the mind\nof Jesus. He beheld Lucifer as he was first cast out from the heavenly\nplaces. He looked forward to the scenes of His own agony, when\nbefore all the worlds the character of the deceiver should be unveiled.\nHe heard the cry, \u201cIt is finished\u201d (John 19:30), announcing that the\nredemption of the lost race was forever made certain, that heaven\nwas made eternally secure against the accusations, the deceptions,\nthe pretensions, that Satan would instigate.\nBeyond the cross of Calvary, with its agony and shame, Jesus\nlooked forward to the great final day, when the prince of the power\nof the air will meet his destruction in the earth so long marred by\nhis rebellion. Jesus beheld the work of evil forever ended, and the\npeace of God filling heaven and earth.\n428 The Desire of Ages\nHenceforward Christ\u2019s followers were to look upon Satan as a\nconquered foe. Upon the cross, Jesus was to gain the victory for\nthem; that victory He desired them to accept as their own. \u201cBehold,\u201d\nHe said, \u201cI give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions,\nand over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means\nhurt you.\u201d\nThe omnipotent power of the Holy Spirit is the defense of every\ncontrite soul. Not one that in penitence and faith has claimed His\nprotection will Christ permit to pass under the enemy\u2019s power. The\nSaviour is by the side of His tempted and tried ones. With Him there\ncan be no such thing as failure, loss, impossibility, or defeat; we can\ndo all things through Him who strengthens us. When temptations\nand trials come, do not wait to adjust all the difficulties, but look to[491]\n[492]\n[493]\nJesus, your helper.\nThere are Christians who think and speak altogether too much\nabout the power of Satan. They think of their adversary, they pray\nabout him, they talk about him, and he looms up greater and greater\nin their imagination. It is true that Satan is a powerful being; but,\nthank God, we have a mighty Saviour, who cast out the evil one\nfrom heaven. Satan is pleased when we magnify his power. Why\nnot talk of Jesus? Why not magnify His power and His love?\nThe rainbow of promise encircling the throne on high is an\neverlasting testimony that \u201cGod so loved the world, that He gave\nHis only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should\nnot perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16. It testifies to the\nuniverse that God will never forsake His people in their struggle\nwith evil. It is an assurance to us of strength and protection as long\nas the throne itself shall endure.\nJesus added, \u201cNotwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits\nare subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are\nwritten in heaven.\u201d Rejoice not in the possession of power, lest\nyou lose sight of your dependence upon God. Be careful lest self-\nsufficiency come in, and you work in your own strength, rather than\nin the spirit and strength of your Master. Self is ever ready to take\nthe credit if any measure of success attends the work. Self is flattered\nand exalted, and the impression is not made upon other minds that\nGod is all and in all. The apostle Paul says, \u201cWhen I am weak,\nthen am I strong.\u201d 2 Corinthians 12:10. When we have a realization\nLast Journey From Galilee 429\nof our weakness, we learn to depend upon a power not inherent.\nNothing can take so strong a hold on the heart as the abiding sense\nof our responsibility to God. Nothing reaches so fully down to the\ndeepest motives of conduct as a sense of the pardoning love of Christ.\nWe are to come in touch with God, then we shall be imbued with\nHis Holy Spirit, that enables us to come in touch with our fellow\nmen. Then rejoice that through Christ you have become connected\nwith God, members of the heavenly family. While you look higher\nthan yourself, you will have a continual sense of the weakness of\nhumanity. The less you cherish self, the more distinct and full will\nbe your comprehension of the excellence of your Saviour. The more\nclosely you connect yourself with the source of light and power, the\ngreater light will be shed upon you, and the greater power will be\nyours to work for God. Rejoice that you are one with God, one with\nChrist, and with the whole family of heaven.\nAs the seventy listened to the words of Christ, the Holy Spirit [494]\nwas impressing their minds with living realities, and writing truth\nupon the tablets of the soul. Though multitudes surrounded them,\nthey were as though shut in with God.\nKnowing that they had caught the inspiration of the hour, Jesus\n\u201crejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven\nand earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent,\nand hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed\ngood in Thy sight. All things are delivered to Me of My Father: and\nno man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father, and who the Father\nis, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him.\u201d\nThe honored men of the world, the so-called great and wise men,\nwith all their boasted wisdom, could not comprehend the character\nof Christ. They judged Him from outward appearance, from the\nhumiliation that came upon Him as a human being. But to fisher-\nmen and publicans it had been given to see the Invisible. Even the\ndisciples failed of understanding all that Jesus desired to reveal to\nthem; but from time to time, as they surrendered themselves to the\nHoly Spirit\u2019s power, their minds were illuminated. They realized\nthat the mighty God, clad in the garb of humanity, was among them.\nJesus rejoiced that though this knowledge was not possessed by the\nwise and prudent, it had been revealed to these humble men. Often\nas He had presented the Old Testament Scriptures, and showed their\n430 The Desire of Ages\napplication to Himself and His work of atonement, they had been\nawakened by His Spirit, and lifted into a heavenly atmosphere. Of\nthe spiritual truths spoken by the prophets they had a clearer under-\nstanding than had the original writers themselves. Hereafter they\nwould read the Old Testament Scriptures, not as the doctrines of the\nscribes and Pharisees, not as the utterances of wise men who were\ndead, but as a new revelation from God. They beheld Him \u201cwhom\nthe world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth\nHim: but ye know Him; for He dwelleth with you, and shall be in\nyou.\u201d John 14:17.\nThe only way in which we can gain a more perfect apprehension\nof truth is by keeping the heart tender and subdued by the Spirit of\nChrist. The soul must be cleansed from vanity and pride, and vacated\nof all that has held it in possession, and Christ must be enthroned\nwithin. Human science is too limited to comprehend the atonement.\nThe plan of redemption is so far-reaching that philosophy cannot\nexplain it. It will ever remain a mystery that the most profound[495]\nreasoning cannot fathom. The science of salvation cannot be ex-\nplained; but it can be known by experience. Only he who sees his\nown sinfulness can discern the preciousness of the Saviour.\nFull of instruction were the lessons which Christ taught as He\nslowly made His way from Galilee toward Jerusalem. Eagerly the\npeople listened to His words. In Perea as in Galilee the people\nwere less under the control of Jewish bigotry than in Judea, and His\nteaching found a response in their hearts.\nDuring these last months of His ministry, many of Christ\u2019s para-\nbles were spoken. The priests and rabbis pursued Him with ever-in-\ncreasing bitterness, and His warnings to them He veiled in symbols.\nThey could not mistake His meaning, yet they could find in His\nwords nothing on which to ground an accusation against Him. In the\nparable of the Pharisee and the publican, the self-sufficient prayer,\n\u201cGod, I thank Thee that I am not as the rest of men,\u201d stood out in\nsharp contrast to the penitent\u2019s plea, \u201cBe merciful to me the sinner.\u201d\nLuke 18:11, 13, R. V ., margin. Thus Christ rebuked the hypocrisy of\nthe Jews. And under the figures of the barren fig tree and the great\nsupper He foretold the doom about to fall upon the impenitent nation.\nThose who had scornfully rejected the invitation to the gospel feast\nLast Journey From Galilee 431\nheard His warning words: \u201cI say unto you, That none of those men\nwhich were bidden shall taste of My supper.\u201d Luke 14:24.\nVery precious was the instruction given to the disciples. The\nparable of the importunate widow and the friend asking for bread at\nmidnight gave new force to His words, \u201cAsk, and it shall be given\nyou; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\u201d\nLuke 11:9. And often their wavering faith was strengthened by the\nmemory that Christ had said, \u201cShall not God do justice for His elect,\nwhich cry to Him day and night, and He is long-suffering over them?\nI say unto you, that He will do them justice speedily.\u201d Luke 18:7, 8,\nR. V ., margin.\nThe beautiful parable of the lost sheep Christ repeated. And He\ncarried its lesson still farther, as He told of the lost piece of silver\nand the prodigal son. The force of these lessons the disciples could\nnot then fully appreciate; but after the outpouring of the Holy Spirit,\nas they saw the ingathering of the Gentiles and the envious anger\nof the Jews, they better understood the lesson of the prodigal son,\nand could enter into the joy of Christ\u2019s words, \u201cIt was meet that we\nshould make merry, and be glad;\u201d \u201cfor this my son was dead, and is [496]\nalive again; he was lost, and is found.\u201d Luke 15:32, 24. And as they\nwent out in their Master\u2019s name, facing reproach and poverty and\npersecution, they often strengthened their hearts by repeating His\ninjunction, spoken on this last journey, \u201cFear not, little flock; for it\nis your Father\u2019s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell that ye\nhave, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a\ntreasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth,\nneither moth corrupteth. For where your treasure is, there will your\nheart be also.\u201d Luke 12:32-34.\nChapter 54\u2014The Good Samaritan[497]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 10:25-37.\nIn the story of the good Samaritan, Christ illustrates the nature\nof true religion. He shows that it consists not in systems, creeds, or\nrites, but in the performance of loving deeds, in bringing the greatest\ngood to others, in genuine goodness.\nAs Christ was teaching the people, \u201ca certain lawyer stood up,\nand tempted Him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal\nlife?\u201d With breathless attention the large congregation awaited the\nanswer. The priests and rabbis had thought to entangle Christ by\nhaving the lawyer ask this question. But the Saviour entered into no\ncontroversy. He required the answer from the questioner himself.\n\u201cWhat is written in the law?\u201d He said; \u201chow readest thou?\u201d The Jews\nstill accused Jesus of lightly regarding the law given from Sinai;\nbut He turned the question of salvation upon the keeping of God\u2019s\ncommandments.\nThe lawyer said, \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy\nheart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy\nmind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cThou hast answered\nright: this do, and thou shalt live.\u201d\nThe lawyer was not satisfied with the position and works of the\nPharisees. He had been studying the Scriptures with a desire to\nlearn their real meaning. He had a vital interest in the matter, and\nhad asked in sincerity, \u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d In his answer as to the\nrequirements of the law, he passed by all the mass of ceremonial[498]\nand ritualistic precepts. For these he claimed no value, but presented\nthe two great principles on which hang all the law and the prophets.\nThis answer, being commended by Christ, placed the Saviour on\nvantage ground with the rabbis. They could not condemn Him for\nsanctioning that which had been advanced by an expositor of the\nlaw.\n432\nGood Samaritan 433\n\u201cThis do, and thou shalt live,\u201d Jesus said. He presented the law\nas a divine unity, and in this lesson taught that it is not possible to\nkeep one precept, and break another; for the same principle runs\nthrough them all. Man\u2019s destiny will be determined by his obedience\nto the whole law. Supreme love to God and impartial love to man\nare the principles to be wrought out in the life.\nThe lawyer found himself a lawbreaker. He was convicted under\nChrist\u2019s searching words. The righteousness of the law, which he\nclaimed to understand, he had not practiced. He had not manifested\nlove toward his fellow man. Repentance was demanded; but instead\nof repenting, he tried to justify himself. Rather than acknowledge the\ntruth, he sought to show how difficult of fulfillment the command-\nment is. Thus he hoped both to parry conviction and to vindicate\nhimself in the eyes of the people. The Saviour\u2019s words had shown\nthat his question was needless, since he had been able to answer it\nhimself. Yet he put another question, saying, \u201cWho is my neighbor?\u201d\nAmong the Jews this question caused endless dispute. They had\nno doubt as to the heathen and the Samaritans; these were strangers\nand enemies. But where should the distinction be made among\nthe people of their own nation, and among the different classes of\nsociety? Whom should the priest, the rabbi, the elder, regard as\nneighbor? They spent their lives in a round of ceremonies to make\nthemselves pure. Contact with the ignorant and careless multitude,\nthey taught, would cause defilement that would require wearisome\neffort to remove. Were they to regard the \u201cunclean\u201d as neighbors?\nAgain Jesus refused to be drawn into controversy. He did not\ndenounce the bigotry of those who were watching to condemn Him.\nBut by a simple story He held up before His hearers such a picture of\nthe outflowing of heaven-born love as touched all hearts, and drew\nfrom the lawyer a confession of the truth.\nThe way to dispel darkness is to admit light. The best way to\ndeal with error is to present truth. It is the revelation of God\u2019s love\nthat makes manifest the deformity and sin of the heart centered in\nself.\n\u201cA certain man,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cwas going down from Jerusalem [499]\nto Jericho; and he fell among robbers, which both stripped him and\nbeat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance a\ncertain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he\n434 The Desire of Ages\npassed by on the other side. And in like manner a Levite also, when\nhe came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.\u201d\nLuke 10:30-32, R. V . This was no imaginary scene, but an actual\noccurrence, which was known to be exactly as represented. The\npriest and the Levite who had passed by on the other side were in\nthe company that listened to Christ\u2019s words.\nIn journeying from Jerusalem to Jericho, the traveler had to pass\nthrough a portion of the wilderness of Judea. The road led down a\nwild, rocky ravine, which was infested by robbers, and was often the\nscene of violence. It was here that the traveler was attacked, stripped\nof all that was valuable, wounded and bruised, and left half dead\nby the wayside. As he lay thus, the priest came that way; but he\nmerely glanced toward the wounded man. Then the Levite appeared.\nCurious to know what had happened, he stopped and looked at the\nsufferer. He was convicted of what he ought to do; but it was not an\nagreeable duty. He wished that he had not come that way, so that he\nneed not have seen the wounded man. He persuaded himself that the\ncase was no concern of his.\nBoth these men were in sacred office, and professed to expound\nthe Scriptures. They were of the class specially chosen to be repre-\nsentatives of God to the people. They were to \u201chave compassion on\nthe ignorant, and on them that are out of the way\u201d (Hebrews 5:2),\nthat they might lead men to understand God\u2019s great love toward hu-[500]\nmanity. The work they were called to do was the same that Jesus had\ndescribed as His own when He said, \u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon\nMe, because He hath anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor;\nHe hath sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance\nto the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty\nthem that are bruised.\u201d Luke 4:18.\nThe angels of heaven look upon the distress of God\u2019s family upon\nthe earth, and they are prepared to co-operate with men in relieving\noppression and suffering. God in His providence had brought the\npriest and the Levite along the road where the wounded sufferer\nlay, that they might see his need of mercy and help. All heaven\nwatched to see if the hearts of these men would be touched with\npity for human woe. The Saviour was the One who had instructed\nthe Hebrews in the wilderness; from the pillar of cloud and of fire\nHe had taught a very different lesson from that which the people\nGood Samaritan 435\nwere now receiving from their priests and teachers. The merciful\nprovisions of the law extended even to the lower animals, which\ncannot express in words their want and suffering. Directions had\nbeen given to Moses for the children of Israel to this effect: \u201cIf thou\nmeet thine enemy\u2019s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring\nit back to him again. If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying\nunder his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely\nhelp with him.\u201d Exodus 23:4, 5. But in the man wounded by robbers,\nJesus presented the case of a brother in suffering. How much more\nshould their hearts have been moved with pity for him than for a\nbeast of burden! The message had been given them through Moses\nthat the Lord their God, \u201ca great God, a mighty, and a terrible,\u201d\n\u201cdoth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth\nthe stranger.\u201d Wherefore He commanded, \u201cLove ye therefore the\nstranger.\u201d \u201cThou shalt love him as thyself.\u201d Deuteronomy 10:17-19;\nLeviticus 19:34.\nJob had said, \u201cThe stranger did not lodge in the street: but I\nopened my doors to the traveler.\u201d And when the two angels in the\nguise of men came to Sodom, Lot bowed himself with his face\ntoward the ground, and said, \u201cBehold now, my lords, turn in, I\npray you, into your servant\u2019s house, and tarry all night.\u201d Job 31:32;\nGenesis 19:2. With all these lessons the priest and the Levite were\nfamiliar, but they had not brought them into practical life. Trained in\nthe school of national bigotry, they had become selfish, narrow, and\nexclusive. When they looked upon the wounded man, they could not\ntell whether he was of their nation or not. They thought he might be\nof the Samaritans, and they turned away.\nIn their action, as Christ had described it, the lawyer saw nothing [501]\n[502]\n[503]\ncontrary to what he had been taught concerning the requirements of\nthe law. But now another scene was presented:\nA certain Samaritan, in his journey, came where the sufferer\nwas, and when he saw him, he had compassion on him. He did not\nquestion whether the stranger was a Jew or a Gentile. If a Jew, the\nSamaritan well knew that, were their condition reversed, the man\nwould spit in his face, and pass him by with contempt. But he did not\nhesitate on account of this. He did not consider that he himself might\nbe in danger of violence by tarrying in the place. It was enough\nthat there was before him a human being in need and suffering. He\n436 The Desire of Ages\ntook off his own garment with which to cover him. The oil and\nwine provided for his own journey he used to heal and refresh the\nwounded man. He lifted him on his own beast, and moved slowly\nalong with even pace, so that the stranger might not be jarred, and\nmade to suffer increased pain. He brought him to an inn, and cared\nfor him through the night, watching him tenderly. In the morning, as\nthe sick man had improved, the Samaritan ventured to go on his way.\nBut before doing this, he placed him in the care of the innkeeper,\npaid the charges, and left a deposit for his benefit; and not satisfied\neven with this, he made provision for any further need, saying to the\nhost, \u201cTake care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I\ncome again, I will repay thee.\u201d\nThe story ended, Jesus fixed His eyes upon the lawyer, in a glance\nthat seemed to read his soul, and said, \u201cWhich of these three, thinkest\nthou, proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers?\u201d Luke",

      "text": "The lawyer would not, even now, take the name Samaritan upon\nhis lips, and he made answer, \u201cHe that showed mercy on him.\u201d Jesus\nsaid, \u201cGo, and do thou likewise.\u201d\nThus the question, \u201cWho is my neighbor?\u201d is forever answered.\nChrist has shown that our neighbor does not mean merely one of\nthe church or faith to which we belong. It has no reference to race,\ncolor, or class distinction. Our neighbor is every person who needs\nour help. Our neighbor is every soul who is wounded and bruised by\nthe adversary. Our neighbor is everyone who is the property of God.\nIn the story of the good Samaritan, Jesus gave a picture of Him-\nself and His mission. Man had been deceived, bruised, robbed, and\nruined by Satan, and left to perish; but the Saviour had compassion\non our helpless condition. He left His glory, to come to our rescue.[504]\nHe found us ready to die, and He undertook our case. He healed our\nwounds. He covered us with His robe of righteousness. He opened\nto us a refuge of safety, and made complete provision for us at His\nown charges. He died to redeem us. Pointing to His own example,\nHe says to His followers, \u201cThese things I command you, that ye love\none another.\u201d \u201cAs I have loved you, that ye also love one another.\u201d\nJohn 15:17; 13:34.\nThe lawyer\u2019s question to Jesus had been, \u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d And\nJesus, recognizing love to God and man as the sum of righteousness,\nGood Samaritan 437\nhad said, \u201cThis do, and thou shalt live.\u201d The Samaritan had obeyed\nthe dictates of a kind and loving heart, and in this had proved himself\na doer of the law. Christ bade the lawyer, \u201cGo, and do thou likewise.\u201d\nDoing, and not saying merely, is expected of the children of God.\n\u201cHe that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even\nas He walked.\u201d 1 John 2:6.\nThe lesson is no less needed in the world today than when it fell\nfrom the lips of Jesus. Selfishness and cold formality have well-nigh\nextinguished the fire of love, and dispelled the graces that should\nmake fragrant the character. Many who profess His name have lost\nsight of the fact that Christians are to represent Christ. Unless there\nis practical self-sacrifice for the good of others, in the family circle,\nin the neighborhood, in the church, and wherever we may be, then\nwhatever our profession, we are not Christians.\nChrist has linked His interest with that of humanity, and He asks\nus to become one with Him for the saving of humanity. \u201cFreely ye\nhave received,\u201d He says, \u201cfreely give.\u201d Matthew 10:8. Sin is the\ngreatest of all evils, and it is ours to pity and help the sinner. There\nare many who err, and who feel their shame and their folly. They are\nhungry for words of encouragement. They look upon their mistakes\nand errors, until they are driven almost to desperation. These souls\nwe are not to neglect. If we are Christians, we shall not pass by on\nthe other side, keeping as far as possible from the very ones who\nmost need our help. When we see human beings in distress, whether\nthrough affliction or through sin, we shall never say, This does not\nconcern me.\n\u201cYe which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of\nmeekness.\u201d Galatians 6:1. By faith and prayer press back the power\nof the enemy. Speak words of faith and courage that will be as\na healing balsam to the bruised and wounded one. Many, many,\nhave fainted and become discouraged in the great struggle of life, [505]\nwhen one word of kindly cheer would have strengthened them to\novercome. Never should we pass by one suffering soul without\nseeking to impart to him of the comfort wherewith we are comforted\nof God.\nAll this is but a fulfillment of the principle of the law,\u2014the\nprinciple that is illustrated in the story of the good Samaritan, and\nmade manifest in the life of Jesus. His character reveals the true\n438 The Desire of Ages\nsignificance of the law, and shows what is meant by loving our\nneighbor as ourselves. And when the children of God manifest\nmercy, kindness, and love toward all men, they also are witnessing\nto the character of the statutes of heaven. They are bearing testimony\nto the fact that \u201cthe law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.\u201d\nPsalm 19:7. And whoever fails to manifest this love is breaking the\nlaw which he professes to revere. For the spirit we manifest toward\nour brethren declares what is our spirit toward God. The love of God\nin the heart is the only spring of love toward our neighbor. \u201cIf a man\nsay, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth\nnot his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he\nhath not seen?\u201d Beloved, \u201cif we love one another, God dwelleth in\nus, and His love is perfected in us.\u201d 1 John 4:20, 12.\nChapter 55\u2014Not With Outward Show [506]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 17:20-22.\nSome of the Pharisees had come to Jesus demanding \u201cwhen the\nkingdom of God should come.\u201d More than three years had passed\nsince John the Baptist gave the message that like a trumpet call\nhad sounded through the land, \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u201d\nMatthew 3:2. And as yet these Pharisees saw no indication of the\nestablishment of the kingdom. Many of those who rejected John, and\nat every step had opposed Jesus, were insinuating that His mission\nhad failed.\nJesus answered, \u201cThe kingdom of God cometh not with outward\nshow; [margin]: neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for,\nbehold, the kingdom of God is within you.\u201d The kingdom of God\nbegins in the heart. Look not here or there for manifestations of\nearthly power to mark its coming.\n\u201cThe days will come,\u201d He said, turning to His disciples, \u201cwhen\nye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall\nnot see it.\u201d Because it is not attended by worldly pomp, you are in\ndanger of failing to discern the glory of My mission. You do not\nrealize how great is your present privilege in having among you,\nthough veiled in humanity, Him who is the life and the light of men.\nThe days will come when you will look back with longing upon the\nopportunities you now enjoy to walk and talk with the Son of God.\nBecause of their selfishness and earthliness, even the disciples\nof Jesus could not comprehend the spiritual glory which He sought [507]\nto reveal unto them. It was not until after Christ\u2019s ascension to His\nFather, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the believers, that\nthe disciples fully appreciated the Saviour\u2019s character and mission.\nAfter they had received the baptism of the Spirit, they began to\nrealize that they had been in the very presence of the Lord of glory.\nAs the sayings of Christ were brought to their remembrance, their\nminds were opened to comprehend the prophecies, and to understand\n439\n440 The Desire of Ages\nthe miracles which He had wrought. The wonders of His life passed\nbefore them, and they were as men awakened from a dream. They\nrealized that \u201cthe Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and\nwe beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father,)\nfull of grace and truth.\u201d John 1:14. Christ had actually come from\nGod to a sinful world to save the fallen sons and daughters of Adam.\nThe disciples now seemed, to themselves, of much less importance\nthan before they realized this. They never wearied of rehearsing His\nwords and works. His lessons, which they had but dimly understood,\nnow came to them as a fresh revelation. The Scriptures became to\nthem a new book.\nAs the disciples searched the prophecies that testified of Christ,\nthey were brought into fellowship with the Deity, and learned of Him\nwho had ascended to heaven to complete the work He had begun\non earth. They recognized the fact that in Him dwelt knowledge\nwhich no human being, unaided by divine agency, could compre-\nhend. They needed the help of Him whom kings, prophets, and\nrighteous men had foretold. With amazement they read and reread\nthe prophetic delineations of His character and work. How dimly\nhad they comprehended the prophetic scriptures! how slow they had\nbeen in taking in the great truths which testified of Christ! Looking\nupon Him in His humiliation, as He walked a man among men,\nthey had not understood the mystery of His incarnation, the dual\ncharacter of His nature. Their eyes were holden, so that they did not\nfully recognize divinity in humanity. But after they were illuminated\nby the Holy Spirit, how they longed to see Him again, and to place\nthemselves at His feet! How they wished that they might come to\nHim, and have Him explain the scriptures which they could not\ncomprehend! How attentively would they listen to His words! What\nhad Christ meant when He said, \u201cI have yet many things to say unto\nyou, but ye cannot bear them now\u201d? John 16:12. How eager they\nwere to know it all! They grieved that their faith had been so feeble,[508]\nthat their ideas had been so wide of the mark, that they had so failed\nof comprehending the reality.\nA herald had been sent from God to proclaim the coming of\nChrist, and to call the attention of the Jewish nation and of the\nworld to His mission, that men might prepare for His reception.\nThe wonderful personage whom John had announced had been\nNot With Outward Show 441\namong them for more than thirty years, and they had not really\nknown Him as the One sent from God. Remorse took hold of the\ndisciples because they had allowed the prevailing unbelief to leaven\ntheir opinions and becloud their understanding. The Light of this\ndark world had been shining amid its gloom, and they had failed\nto comprehend whence were its beams. They asked themselves\nwhy they had pursued a course that made it necessary for Christ to\nreprove them. They often repeated His conversations, and said, Why\ndid we allow earthly considerations and the opposition of priests and\nrabbis to confuse our senses, so that we did not comprehend that\na greater than Moses was among us, that One wiser than Solomon\nwas instructing us? How dull were our ears! how feeble was our\nunderstanding!\nThomas would not believe until he had thrust his finger into the\nwound made by the Roman soldiers. Peter had denied Him in His\nhumiliation and rejection. These painful remembrances came before\nthem in distinct lines. They had been with Him, but they had not\nknown or appreciated Him. But how these things now stirred their\nhearts as they recognized their unbelief!\nAs priests and rulers combined against them, and they were\nbrought before councils and thrust into prison, the followers of\nChrist rejoiced \u201cthat they were counted worthy to suffer shame for\nHis name.\u201d Acts 5:41. They rejoiced to prove, before men and\nangels, that they recognized the glory of Christ, and chose to follow\nHim at the loss of all things.\nIt is as true now as in apostolic days, that without the illumination\nof the divine Spirit, humanity cannot discern the glory of Christ.\nThe truth and the work of God are unappreciated by a world-loving\nand compromising Christianity. Not in the ways of ease, of earthly\nhonor or worldly conformity, are the followers of the Master found.\nThey are far in advance, in the paths of toil, and humiliation, and\nreproach, in the front of the battle \u201cagainst the principalities, against\nthe powers, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the\nspiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\u201d Ephesians\n6:12, R. V . And now, as in Christ\u2019s day, they are misunderstood and [509]\nreproached and oppressed by the priests and Pharisees of their time.\nThe kingdom of God comes not with outward show. The gospel\nof the grace of God, with its spirit of self-abnegation, can never\n442 The Desire of Ages\nbe in harmony with the spirit of the world. The two principles are\nantagonistic. \u201cThe natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit\nof God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,\nbecause they are spiritually discerned.\u201d 1 Corinthians 2:14.\nBut today in the religious world there are multitudes who, as\nthey believe, are working for the establishment of the kingdom of\nChrist as an earthly and temporal dominion. They desire to make our\nLord the ruler of the kingdoms of this world, the ruler in its courts\nand camps, its legislative halls, its palaces and market places. They\nexpect Him to rule through legal enactments, enforced by human\nauthority. Since Christ is not now here in person, they themselves\nwill undertake to act in His stead, to execute the laws of His kingdom.\nThe establishment of such a kingdom is what the Jews desired in the\ndays of Christ. They would have received Jesus, had He been willing\nto establish a temporal dominion, to enforce what they regarded as\nthe laws of God, and to make them the expositors of His will and\nthe agents of His authority. But He said, \u201cMy kingdom is not of this\nworld.\u201d John 18:36. He would not accept the earthly throne.\nThe government under which Jesus lived was corrupt and op-\npressive; on every hand were crying abuses,\u2014extortion, intolerance,\nand grinding cruelty. Yet the Saviour attempted no civil reforms.\nHe attacked no national abuses, nor condemned the national ene-\nmies. He did not interfere with the authority or administration of\nthose in power. He who was our example kept aloof from earthly\ngovernments. Not because He was indifferent to the woes of men,\nbut because the remedy did not lie in merely human and external\nmeasures. To be efficient, the cure must reach men individually, and\nmust regenerate the heart.\nNot by the decisions of courts or councils or legislative assem-\nblies, not by the patronage of worldly great men, is the kingdom\nof Christ established, but by the implanting of Christ\u2019s nature in\nhumanity through the work of the Holy Spirit. \u201cAs many as received\nHim, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to\nthem that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood, nor\nof the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\u201d John 1:12,\n13. Here is the only power that can work the uplifting of mankind.[510]\nAnd the human agency for the accomplishment of this work is the\nteaching and practicing of the word of God.\nNot With Outward Show 443\nWhen the apostle Paul began his ministry in Corinth, that pop-\nulous, wealthy, and wicked city, polluted by the nameless vices of\nheathenism, he said, \u201cI determined not to know anything among you,\nsave Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.\u201d 1 Corinthians 2:2. Writing\nafterward to some of those who had been corrupted by the foulest\nsins, he could say, \u201cBut ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye\nare justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our\nGod.\u201d \u201cI thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God\nwhich is given you by Jesus Christ.\u201d 1 Corinthians 6:11; 1:4.\nNow, as in Christ\u2019s day, the work of God\u2019s kingdom lies not with\nthose who are clamoring for recognition and support by earthly rulers\nand human laws, but with those who are declaring to the people in\nHis name those spiritual truths that will work in the receivers the\nexperience of Paul: \u201cI am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live;\nyet not I, but Christ liveth in me.\u201d Galatians 2:20. Then they will\nlabor as did Paul for the benefit of men. He said, \u201cNow then we are\nambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we\npray you in Christ\u2019s stead, be ye reconciled to God.\u201d 2 Corinthians\n5:20.\nChapter 56\u2014Blessing the Children[511]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 19:13-15; Mark 10:13-16; Luke\n18:15-17.\nJesus was ever a lover of children. He accepted their childish\nsympathy and their open, unaffected love. The grateful praise from\ntheir pure lips was music in His ears, and refreshed His spirit when\noppressed by contact with crafty and hypocritical men. Wherever\nthe Saviour went, the benignity of His countenance, and His gentle,\nkindly manner won the love and confidence of children.\nAmong the Jews it was customary for children to be brought\nto some rabbi, that he might lay his hands upon them in blessing;\nbut the Saviour\u2019s disciples thought His work too important to be\ninterrupted in this way. When the mothers came to Him with their\nlittle ones, the disciples looked on them with disfavor. They thought\nthese children too young to be benefited by a visit to Jesus, and\nconcluded that He would be displeased at their presence. But it was\nthe disciples with whom He was displeased. The Saviour understood\nthe care and burden of the mothers who were seeking to train their\nchildren according to the word of God. He had heard their prayers.\nHe Himself had drawn them into His presence.\nOne mother with her child had left her home to find Jesus. On\nthe way she told a neighbor her errand, and the neighbor wanted to\nhave Jesus bless her children. Thus several mothers came together,\nwith their little ones. Some of the children had passed beyond the\nyears of infancy to childhood and youth. When the mothers made[512]\nknown their desire, Jesus heard with sympathy the timid, tearful\nrequest. But He waited to see how the disciples would treat them.\nWhen He saw them send the mothers away, thinking to do Him a\nfavor, He showed them their error, saying, \u201cSuffer the little children\nto come unto Me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom\nof God.\u201d He took the children in His arms, He laid His hands upon\nthem, and gave them the blessing for which they came.\n444\nBlessing the Children 445\nThe mothers were comforted. They returned to their homes\nstrengthened and blessed by the words of Christ. They were encour-\naged to take up their burden with new cheerfulness, and to work\nhopefully for their children. The mothers of today are to receive His\nwords with the same faith. Christ is as verily a personal Saviour\ntoday as when He lived a man among men. He is as verily the helper\nof mothers today as when He gathered the little ones to His arms in\nJudea. The children of our hearths are as much the purchase of His\nblood as were the children of long ago.\nJesus knows the burden of every mother\u2019s heart. He who had a\nmother that struggled with poverty and privation sympathizes with\nevery mother in her labors. He who made a long journey in order\nto relieve the anxious heart of a Canaanite woman will do as much\nfor the mothers of today. He who gave back to the widow of Nain\nher only son, and who in His agony upon the cross remembered His\nown mother, is touched today by the mother\u2019s sorrow. In every grief\nand every need He will give comfort and help.\nLet mothers come to Jesus with their perplexities. They will find\ngrace sufficient to aid them in the management of their children. The\ngates are open for every mother who would lay her burdens at the\nSaviour\u2019s feet. He who said, \u201cSuffer the little children to come unto\nMe, and forbid them not,\u201d still invites the mothers to lead up their\nlittle ones to be blessed by Him. Even the babe in its mother\u2019s arms\nmay dwell as under the shadow of the Almighty through the faith\nof the praying mother. John the Baptist was filled with the Holy\nSpirit from his birth. If we will live in communion with God, we too\nmay expect the divine Spirit to mold our little ones, even from their\nearliest moments.\nIn the children who were brought in contact with Him, Jesus\nsaw the men and women who should be heirs of His grace and\nsubjects of His kingdom, and some of whom would become martyrs\nfor His sake. He knew that these children would listen to Him and [513]\n[514]\n[515]\naccept Him as their Redeemer far more readily than would grown-\nup people, many of whom were the worldly-wise and hardhearted.\nIn His teaching He came down to their level. He, the Majesty of\nheaven, did not disdain to answer their questions, and simplify His\nimportant lessons to meet their childish understanding. He planted\n446 The Desire of Ages\nin their minds the seeds of truth, which in after years would spring\nup, and bear fruit unto eternal life.\nIt is still true that children are the most susceptible to the teach-\nings of the gospel; their hearts are open to divine influences, and\nstrong to retain the lessons received. The little children may be\nChristians, having an experience in accordance with their years.\nThey need to be educated in spiritual things, and parents should\ngive them every advantage, that they may form characters after the\nsimilitude of the character of Christ.\nFathers and mothers should look upon their children as younger\nmembers of the Lord\u2019s family, committed to them to educate for\nheaven. The lessons that we ourselves learn from Christ we should\ngive to our children, as the young minds can receive them, little by\nlittle opening to them the beauty of the principles of heaven. Thus\nthe Christian home becomes a school, where the parents serve as\nunderteachers, while Christ Himself is the chief instructor.\nIn working for the conversion of our children, we should not\nlook for violent emotion as the essential evidence of conviction\nof sin. Nor is it necessary to know the exact time when they are\nconverted. We should teach them to bring their sins to Jesus, asking\nHis forgiveness, and believing that He pardons and receives them as\nHe received the children when He was personally on earth.\nAs the mother teaches her children to obey her because they love\nher, she is teaching them the first lessons in the Christian life. The\nmother\u2019s love represents to the child the love of Christ, and the little\nones who trust and obey their mother are learning to trust and obey\nthe Saviour.\nJesus was the pattern for children, and He was also the father\u2019s\nexample. He spoke as one having authority, and His word was with\npower; yet in all His intercourse with rude and violent men He did\nnot use one unkind or discourteous expression. The grace of Christ\nin the heart will impart a heaven-born dignity and sense of propriety.\nIt will soften whatever is harsh, and subdue all that is coarse and\nunkind. It will lead fathers and mothers to treat their children as\nintelligent beings, as they themselves would like to be treated.\nParents, in the training of your children, study the lessons that[516]\nGod has given in nature. If you would train a pink, or rose, or lily,\nhow would you do it? Ask the gardener by what process he makes\nBlessing the Children 447\nevery branch and leaf to flourish so beautifully, and to develop in\nsymmetry and loveliness. He will tell you that it was by no rude\ntouch, no violent effort; for this would only break the delicate stems.\nIt was by little attentions, often repeated. He moistened the soil,\nand protected the growing plants from the fierce blasts and from the\nscorching sun, and God caused them to flourish and to blossom into\nloveliness. In dealing with your children, follow the method of the\ngardener. By gentle touches, by loving ministrations, seek to fashion\ntheir characters after the pattern of the character of Christ.\nEncourage the expression of love toward God and toward one\nanother. The reason why there are so many hardhearted men and\nwomen in the world is that true affection has been regarded as\nweakness, and has been discouraged and repressed. The better\nnature of these persons was stifled in childhood; and unless the light\nof divine love shall melt away their cold selfishness, their happiness\nwill be forever ruined. If we wish our children to possess the tender\nspirit of Jesus, and the sympathy that angels manifest for us, we\nmust encourage the generous, loving impulses of childhood.\nTeach the children to see Christ in nature. Take them out into\nthe open air, under the noble trees, into the garden; and in all the\nwonderful works of creation teach them to see an expression of His\nlove. Teach them that He made the laws which govern all living\nthings, that He has made laws for us, and that these laws are for\nour happiness and joy. Do not weary them with long prayers and [517]\ntedious exhortations, but through nature\u2019s object lessons teach them\nobedience to the law of God.\nAs you win their confidence in you as followers of Christ, it\nwill be easy to teach them of the great love wherewith He has loved\nus. As you try to make plain the truths of salvation, and point the\nchildren to Christ as a personal Saviour, angels will be by your side.\nThe Lord will give to fathers and mothers grace to interest their little\nones in the precious story of the Babe of Bethlehem, who is indeed\nthe hope of the world.\nWhen Jesus told the disciples not to forbid the children to come\nto Him, He was speaking to His followers in all ages,\u2014to officers of\nthe church, to ministers, helpers, and all Christians. Jesus is drawing\nthe children, and He bids us, Suffer them to come; as if He would\nsay, They will come if you do not hinder them.\n448 The Desire of Ages\nLet not your un-Christlike character misrepresent Jesus. Do not\nkeep the little ones away from Him by your coldness and harshness.\nNever give them cause to feel that heaven will not be a pleasant\nplace to them if you are there. Do not speak of religion as something\nthat children cannot understand, or act as if they were not expected\nto accept Christ in their childhood. Do not give them the false\nimpression that the religion of Christ is a religion of gloom, and that\nin coming to the Saviour they must give up all that makes life joyful.\nAs the Holy Spirit moves upon the hearts of the children, co-op-\nerate with His work. Teach them that the Saviour is calling them, that\nnothing can give Him greater joy than for them to give themselves\nto Him in the bloom and freshness of their years.\nThe Saviour regards with infinite tenderness the souls whom He\nhas purchased with His own blood. They are the claim of His love.\nHe looks upon them with unutterable longing. His heart is drawn\nout, not only to the best-behaved children, but to those who have by\ninheritance objectionable traits of character. Many parents do not\nunderstand how much they are responsible for these traits in their\nchildren. They have not the tenderness and wisdom to deal with the\nerring ones whom they have made what they are. But Jesus looks\nupon these children with pity. He traces from cause to effect.\nThe Christian worker may be Christ\u2019s agent in drawing these\nchildren to the Saviour. By wisdom and tact he may bind them to his\nheart, he may give them courage and hope, and through the grace\nof Christ may see them transformed in character, so that of them it\nmay be said, \u201cOf such is the kingdom of God.\u201d\nChapter 57\u2014\u201cOne Thing Thou Lackest\u201d [518]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 19:16-22; Mark 10:17-22; Luke\n18:18-23.\n\u201cAnd when He was gone forth into the way, there came one\nrunning, and kneeled to Him, and asked Him, Good Master, what\nshall I do that I may inherit eternal life?\u201d\nThe young man who asked this question was a ruler. He had\ngreat possessions, and occupied a position of responsibility. He saw\nthe love that Christ manifested toward the children brought to Him;\nhe saw how tenderly He received them, and took them up in His\narms, and his heart kindled with love for the Saviour. He felt a desire\nto be His disciple. He was so deeply moved that as Christ was going\non His way, he ran after Him, and kneeling at His feet, asked with\nsincerity and earnestness the question so important to his soul and to\nthe soul of every human being, \u201cGood Master, what shall I do that I\nmay inherit eternal life?\u201d\n\u201cWhy callest thou Me good?\u201d said Christ, \u201cthere is none good\nbut One, that is, God.\u201d Jesus desired to test the ruler\u2019s sincerity, and\nto draw from him the way in which he regarded Him as good. Did\nhe realize that the One to whom he was speaking was the Son of\nGod? What was the true sentiment of his heart?\nThis ruler had a high estimate of his own righteousness. He did\nnot really suppose that he was defective in anything, yet he was not\naltogether satisfied. He felt the want of something that he did not\npossess. Could not Jesus bless him as He blessed the little children,\nand satisfy his soul want?\nIn reply to this question Jesus told him that obedience to the\ncommandments of God was necessary if he would obtain eternal\nlife; and He quoted several of the commandments which show man\u2019s\nduty to his fellow men. The ruler\u2019s answer was positive: \u201cAll these [519]\nthings have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?\u201d\n449\n450 The Desire of Ages\nChrist looked into the face of the young man, as if reading his\nlife and searching his character. He loved him, and He hungered\nto give him that peace and grace and joy which would materially\nchange his character. \u201cOne thing thou lackest,\u201d He said; \u201cgo thy\nway, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt\nhave treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow\nMe.\u201d\nChrist was drawn to this young man. He knew him to be sincere\nin his assertion, \u201cAll these things have I kept from my youth.\u201d The\nRedeemer longed to create in him that discernment which would\nenable him to see the necessity of heart devotion and Christian\ngoodness. He longed to see in him a humble and contrite heart,\nconscious of the supreme love to be given to God, and hiding its\nlack in the perfection of Christ.\nJesus saw in this ruler just the help He needed if the young man\nwould become a colaborer with Him in the work of salvation. If he\nwould place himself under Christ\u2019s guidance, he would be a power\nfor good. In a marked degree the ruler could have represented Christ;\nfor he possessed qualifications, which, if he were united with the\nSaviour, would enable him to become a divine force among men.\nChrist, seeing into his character, loved him. Love for Christ was\nawakening in the ruler\u2019s heart; for love begets love. Jesus longed\nto see him a co-worker with Him. He longed to make him like\nHimself, a mirror in which the likeness of God would be reflected.\nHe longed to develop the excellence of his character, and sanctify\nit to the Master\u2019s use. If the ruler had then given himself to Christ,\nhe would have grown in the atmosphere of His presence. If he had\nmade this choice, how different would have been his future!\n\u201cOne thing thou lackest,\u201d Jesus said. \u201cIf thou wilt be perfect,\ngo and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have\ntreasure in heaven: and come and follow Me.\u201d Christ read the ruler\u2019s\nheart. Only one thing he lacked, but that was a vital principle. He\nneeded the love of God in the soul. This lack, unless supplied, would\nprove fatal to him; his whole nature would become corrupted. By\nindulgence, selfishness would strengthen. That he might receive the\nlove of God, his supreme love of self must be surrendered.\nChrist gave this man a test. He called upon him to choose\nbetween the heavenly treasure and worldly greatness. The heavenly\n\u201cOne Thing Thou Lackest\u201d 451\ntreasure was assured him if he would follow Christ. But self must\nyield; his will must be given into Christ\u2019s control. The very holiness\nof God was offered to the young ruler. He had the privilege of [520]\nbecoming a son of God, and a coheir with Christ to the heavenly\ntreasure. But he must take up the cross, and follow the Saviour in\nthe path of self-denial.\nChrist\u2019s words were verily to the ruler the invitation, \u201cChoose\nyou this day whom ye will serve.\u201d Joshua 24:15. The choice was\nleft with him. Jesus was yearning for his conversion. He had shown\nhim the plague spot in his character, and with what deep interest He\nwatched the issue as the young man weighed the question! If he\ndecided to follow Christ, he must obey His words in everything. He\nmust turn from his ambitious projects. With what earnest, anxious\nlonging, what soul hunger, did the Saviour look at the young man,\nhoping that he would yield to the invitation of the Spirit of God!\nChrist made the only terms which could place the ruler where\nhe would perfect a Christian character. His words were words of\nwisdom, though they appeared severe and exacting. In accepting\nand obeying them was the ruler\u2019s only hope of salvation. His exalted\nposition and his possessions were exerting a subtle influence for\nevil upon his character. If cherished, they would supplant God in\nhis affections. To keep back little or much from God was to retain\nthat which would lessen his moral strength and efficiency; for if the\nthings of this world are cherished, however uncertain and unworthy\nthey may be, they will become all-absorbing.\nThe ruler was quick to discern all that Christ\u2019s words involved,\nand he became sad. If he had realized the value of the offered gift,\nquickly would he have enrolled himself as one of Christ\u2019s followers.\nHe was a member of the honored council of the Jews, and Satan\nwas tempting him with flattering prospects of the future. He wanted\nthe heavenly treasure, but he wanted also the temporal advantages\nhis riches would bring him. He was sorry that such conditions\nexisted; he desired eternal life, but he was not willing to make the\nsacrifice. The cost of eternal life seemed too great, and he went away\nsorrowful; \u201cfor he had great possessions.\u201d\nHis claim that he had kept the law of God was a deception. He\nshowed that riches were his idol. He could not keep the command-\nments of God while the world was first in his affections. He loved\n452 The Desire of Ages\nthe gifts of God more than he loved the Giver. Christ had offered\nthe young man fellowship with Himself. \u201cFollow Me,\u201d He said. But\nthe Saviour was not so much to him as his own name among men\nor his possessions. To give up his earthly treasure, that was seen,\nfor the heavenly treasure, that was unseen, was too great a risk. He\nrefused the offer of eternal life, and went away, and ever after the\nworld was to receive his worship. Thousands are passing through[521]\n[522]\n[523]\nthis ordeal, weighing Christ against the world; and many choose the\nworld. Like the young ruler, they turn from the Saviour, saying in\ntheir hearts, I will not have this Man as my leader.\nChrist\u2019s dealing with the young man is presented as an object\nlesson. God has given us the rule of conduct which every one of\nHis servants must follow. It is obedience to His law, not merely a\nlegal obedience, but an obedience which enters into the life, and\nis exemplified in the character. God has set His own standard of\ncharacter for all who would become subjects of His kingdom. Only\nthose who will become co-workers with Christ, only those who will\nsay, Lord, all I have and all I am is Thine, will be acknowledged as\nsons and daughters of God. All should consider what it means to\ndesire heaven, and yet to turn away because of the conditions laid\ndown. Think of what it means to say \u201cNo\u201d to Christ. The ruler said,\nNo, I cannot give You all. Do we say the same? The Saviour offers\nto share with us the work God has given us to do. He offers to use\nthe means God has given us, to carry forward His work in the world.\nOnly in this way can He save us.\nThe ruler\u2019s possessions were entrusted to him that he might prove\nhimself a faithful steward; he was to dispense these goods for the\nblessing of those in need. So God now entrusts men with means,\nwith talents and opportunities, that they may be His agents in helping\nthe poor and the suffering. He who uses his entrusted gifts as God\ndesigns becomes a co-worker with the Saviour. He wins souls to\nChrist, because he is a representative of His character.\nTo those who, like the young ruler, are in high positions of trust\nand have great possessions, it may seem too great a sacrifice to give\nup all in order to follow Christ. But this is the rule of conduct for\nall who would become His disciples. Nothing short of obedience\ncan be accepted. Self-surrender is the substance of the teachings of\nChrist. Often it is presented and enjoined in language that seems\n\u201cOne Thing Thou Lackest\u201d 453\nauthoritative, because there is no other way to save man than to cut\naway those things which, if entertained, will demoralize the whole\nbeing.\nWhen Christ\u2019s followers give back to the Lord His own, they are\naccumulating treasure which will be given to them when they shall\nhear the words, \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant; ... enter thou\ninto the joy of thy Lord.\u201d \u201cWho for the joy that was set before Him\nendured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right\nhand of the throne of God.\u201d Matthew 25:23; Hebrews 12:2. The joy\nof seeing souls redeemed, souls eternally saved, is the reward of all\nthat put their feet in the footprints of Him who said, \u201cFollow Me.\u201d\nChapter 58\u2014\u201cLazarus, Come Forth\u201d[524]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 10:38-42; John 11:1-44.\nAmong the most steadfast of Christ\u2019s disciples was Lazarus\nof Bethany. From their first meeting his faith in Christ had been\nstrong; his love for Him was deep, and he was greatly beloved by\nthe Saviour. It was for Lazarus that the greatest of Christ\u2019s miracles\nwas performed. The Saviour blessed all who sought His help; He\nloves all the human family, but to some He is bound by peculiarly\ntender associations. His heart was knit by a strong bond of affection\nto the family at Bethany, and for one of them His most wonderful\nwork was wrought.\nAt the home of Lazarus, Jesus had often found rest. The Saviour\nhad no home of His own; He was dependent on the hospitality of His\nfriends and disciples, and often, when weary, thirsting for human\nfellowship, He had been glad to escape to this peaceful household,\naway from the suspicion and jealousy of the angry Pharisees. Here\nHe found a sincere welcome, and pure, holy friendship. Here He\ncould speak with simplicity and perfect freedom, knowing that His\nwords would be understood and treasured.\nOur Saviour appreciated a quiet home and interested listeners.\nHe longed for human tenderness, courtesy, and affection. Those who\nreceived the heavenly instruction He was always ready to impart\nwere greatly blessed. As the multitudes followed Christ through the\nopen fields, He unfolded to them the beauties of the natural world.[525]\nHe sought to open the eyes of their understanding, that they might\nsee how the hand of God upholds the world. In order to call out\nan appreciation of God\u2019s goodness and benevolence, He called the\nattention of His hearers to the gently falling dew, to the soft showers\nof rain and the bright sunshine, given alike to good and evil. He\ndesired men to realize more fully the regard that God bestows on the\nhuman instrumentalities He has created. But the multitudes were\nslow of hearing, and in the home at Bethany Christ found rest from\n454\n\u201cLazarus, Come Forth\u201d 455\nthe weary conflict of public life. Here He opened to an appreciative\naudience the volume of Providence. In these private interviews He\nunfolded to His hearers that which He did not attempt to tell to the\nmixed multitude. He needed not to speak to His friends in parables.\nAs Christ gave His wonderful lessons, Mary sat at His feet, a\nreverent and devoted listener. On one occasion, Martha, perplexed\nwith the care of preparing the meal, went to Christ, saying, \u201cLord,\ndost Thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her\ntherefore that she help me.\u201d This was the time of Christ\u2019s first visit to\nBethany. The Saviour and His disciples had just made the toilsome\njourney on foot from Jericho. Martha was anxious to provide for\ntheir comfort, and in her anxiety she forgot the courtesy due to her\nGuest. Jesus answered her with mild and patient words, \u201cMartha,\nMartha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: but one\nthing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall\nnot be taken away from her.\u201d Mary was storing her mind with the\nprecious words falling from the Saviour\u2019s lips, words that were more\nprecious to her than earth\u2019s most costly jewels.\nThe \u201cone thing\u201d that Martha needed was a calm, devotional spirit,\na deeper anxiety for knowledge concerning the future, immortal life,\nand the graces necessary for spiritual advancement. She needed\nless anxiety for the things which pass away, and more for those\nthings which endure forever. Jesus would teach His children to seize\nevery opportunity of gaining that knowledge which will make them\nwise unto salvation. The cause of Christ needs careful, energetic\nworkers. There is a wide field for the Marthas, with their zeal in\nactive religious work. But let them first sit with Mary at the feet of\nJesus. Let diligence, promptness, and energy be sanctified by the\ngrace of Christ; then the life will be an unconquerable power for\ngood.\nSorrow entered the peaceful home where Jesus had rested.\nLazarus was stricken with sudden illness, and his sisters sent to\nthe Saviour, saying, \u201cLord, behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick.\u201d [526]\nThey saw the violence of the disease that had seized their brother, but\nthey knew that Christ had shown Himself able to heal all manner of\ndiseases. They believed that He would sympathize with them in their\ndistress; therefore they made no urgent demand for His immediate\npresence, but sent only the confiding message, \u201cHe whom Thou\n456 The Desire of Ages\nlovest is sick.\u201d They thought that He would immediately respond to\ntheir message, and be with them as soon as He could reach Bethany.\nAnxiously they waited for a word from Jesus. As long as the\nspark of life was yet alive in their brother, they prayed and watched\nfor Jesus to come. But the messenger returned without Him. Yet\nhe brought the message, \u201cThis sickness is not unto death,\u201d and they\nclung to the hope that Lazarus would live. Tenderly they tried to\nspeak words of hope and encouragement to the almost unconscious\nsufferer. When Lazarus died, they were bitterly disappointed; but\nthey felt the sustaining grace of Christ, and this kept them from\nreflecting any blame on the Saviour.\nWhen Christ heard the message, the disciples thought He re-\nceived it coldly. He did not manifest the sorrow they expected Him\nto show. Looking up to them, He said, \u201cThis sickness is not unto\ndeath, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glo-\nrified thereby.\u201d For two days He remained in the place where He\nwas. This delay was a mystery to the disciples. What a comfort\nHis presence would be to the afflicted household! they thought. His\nstrong affection for the family at Bethany was well known to the\ndisciples, and they were surprised that He did not respond to the sad\nmessage, \u201cHe whom Thou lovest is sick.\u201d\nDuring the two days Christ seemed to have dismissed the mes-\nsage from His mind; for He did not speak of Lazarus. The disciples\nthought of John the Baptist, the forerunner of Jesus. They had won-\ndered why Jesus, with the power to perform wonderful miracles,\nhad permitted John to languish in prison, and to die a violent death.\nPossessing such power, why did not Christ save John\u2019s life? This\nquestion had often been asked by the Pharisees, who presented it\nas an unanswerable argument against Christ\u2019s claim to be the Son\nof God. The Saviour had warned His disciples of trials, losses, and\npersecution. Would He forsake them in trial? Some questioned if\nthey had mistaken His mission. All were deeply troubled.\nAfter waiting for two days, Jesus said to the disciples, \u201cLet us\ngo into Judea again.\u201d The disciples questioned why, if Jesus were\ngoing to Judea, He had waited two days. But anxiety for Christ and\nfor themselves was now uppermost in their minds. They could see[527]\nnothing but danger in the course He was about to pursue. \u201cMaster,\u201d\nthey said, \u201cthe Jews of late sought to stone Thee; and goest Thou\n\u201cLazarus, Come Forth\u201d 457\nthither again? Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the\nday?\u201d I am under the guidance of My Father; as long as I do His\nwill, My life is safe. My twelve hours of day are not yet ended. I\nhave entered upon the last remnant of My day; but while any of this\nremains, I am safe.\n\u201cIf any man walk in the day,\u201d He continued, \u201che stumbleth not,\nbecause he seeth the light of this world.\u201d He who does the will\nof God, who walks in the path that God has marked out, cannot\nstumble and fall. The light of God\u2019s guiding Spirit gives him a clear\nperception of his duty, and leads him aright till the close of his work.\n\u201cBut if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no\nlight in him.\u201d He who walks in a path of his own choosing, where\nGod has not called him, will stumble. For him day is turned into\nnight, and wherever he may be, he is not secure.\n\u201cThese things said He: and after that He saith unto them, Our\nfriend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.\u201d\n\u201cOur friend Lazarus sleepeth.\u201d How touching the words! how full\nof sympathy! In the thought of the peril their Master was about\nto incur by going to Jerusalem, the disciples had almost forgotten\nthe bereaved family at Bethany. But not so Christ. The disciples\nfelt rebuked. They had been disappointed because Christ did not\nrespond more promptly to the message. They had been tempted to\nthink that He had not the tender love for Lazarus and his sisters that\nthey had thought He had, or He would have hastened back with the\nmessenger. But the words, \u201cOur friend Lazarus sleepeth,\u201d awakened\nright feelings in their minds. They were convinced that Christ had\nnot forgotten His suffering friends.\n\u201cThen said His disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.\nHowbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that He had\nspoken of taking of rest in sleep.\u201d Christ represents death as a sleep\nto His believing children. Their life is hid with Christ in God, and\nuntil the last trump shall sound those who die will sleep in Him.\n\u201cThen said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. And I am\nglad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe;\nnevertheless let us go unto him.\u201d Thomas could see nothing but\ndeath in store for his Master if he went to Judea; but he girded up\nhis spirit, and said to the other disciples, \u201cLet us also go, that we\nmay die with Him.\u201d He knew the hatred of the Jews toward Christ.\n458 The Desire of Ages\nIt was their purpose to compass His death, but this purpose had not[528]\nsucceeded, because some of His allotted time still remained. During\nthis time Jesus had the guardianship of heavenly angels; and even in\nthe regions of Judea, where the rabbis were plotting how they might\ntake Him and put Him to death, no harm could come to Him.\nThe disciples marveled at Christ\u2019s words when He said, \u201cLazarus\nis dead. And I am glad ... that I was not there.\u201d Did the Saviour by\nHis own choice avoid the home of His suffering friends? Apparently\nMary and Martha and the dying Lazarus were left alone. But they\nwere not alone. Christ beheld the whole scene, and after the death\nof Lazarus the bereaved sisters were upheld by His grace. Jesus\nwitnessed the sorrow of their rent hearts, as their brother wrestled\nwith his strong foe, death. He felt every pang of anguish, as He\nsaid to His disciples, \u201cLazarus is dead.\u201d But Christ had not only\nthe loved ones at Bethany to think of; He had the training of His\ndisciples to consider. They were to be His representatives to the\nworld, that the Father\u2019s blessing might embrace all. For their sake\nHe permitted Lazarus to die. Had He restored him from illness to\nhealth, the miracle that is the most positive evidence of His divine\ncharacter, would not have been performed.\nHad Christ been in the sickroom, Lazarus would not have died;\nfor Satan would have had no power over him. Death could not have\naimed his dart at Lazarus in the presence of the Life-giver. Therefore\nChrist remained away. He suffered the enemy to exercise his power,\nthat He might drive him back, a conquered foe. He permitted Lazarus\nto pass under the dominion of death; and the suffering sisters saw\ntheir brother laid in the grave. Christ knew that as they looked on\nthe dead face of their brother their faith in their Redeemer would be\nseverely tried. But He knew that because of the struggle through\nwhich they were now passing their faith would shine forth with far\ngreater power. He suffered every pang of sorrow that they endured.\nHe loved them no less because He tarried; but He knew that for\nthem, for Lazarus, for Himself, and for His disciples, a victory was\nto be gained.\n\u201cFor your sakes,\u201d \u201cto the intent ye may believe.\u201d To all who are\nreaching out to feel the guiding hand of God, the moment of greatest\ndiscouragement is the time when divine help is nearest. They will\nlook back with thankfulness upon the darkest part of their way. \u201cThe\n\u201cLazarus, Come Forth\u201d 459\nLord knoweth how to deliver the godly,\u201d 2 Peter 2:9. From every\ntemptation and every trial He will bring them forth with firmer faith\nand a richer experience.\nIn delaying to come to Lazarus, Christ had a purpose of mercy [529]\ntoward those who had not received Him. He tarried, that by raising\nLazarus from the dead He might give to His stubborn, unbelieving\npeople another evidence that He was indeed \u201cthe resurrection, and\nthe life.\u201d He was loath to give up all hope of the people, the poor,\nwandering sheep of the house of Israel. His heart was breaking\nbecause of their impenitence. In His mercy He purposed to give\nthem one more evidence that He was the Restorer, the One who\nalone could bring life and immortality to light. This was to be an\nevidence that the priests could not misinterpret. This was the reason\nof His delay in going to Bethany. This crowning miracle, the raising\nof Lazarus, was to set the seal of God on His work and on His claim\nto divinity.\nOn His journey to Bethany, Jesus, according to His custom,\nministered to the sick and the needy. Upon reaching the town He\nsent a messenger to the sisters with the tidings of His arrival. Christ\ndid not at once enter the house, but remained in a quiet place by\nthe wayside. The great outward display observed by the Jews at\nthe death of friends or relatives was not in harmony with the spirit\nof Christ. He heard the sound of wailing from the hired mourners,\nand He did not wish to meet the sisters in the scene of confusion.\nAmong the mourning friends were relatives of the family, some of\nwhom held high positions of responsibility in Jerusalem. Among\nthese were some of Christ\u2019s bitterest enemies. Christ knew their\npurposes, and therefore He did not at once make Himself known.\nThe message was given to Martha so quietly that others in the\nroom did not hear. Absorbed in her grief, Mary did not hear the\nwords. Rising at once, Martha went out to meet her Lord, but\nthinking that she had gone to the place where Lazarus was buried,\nMary sat still in her sorrow, making no outcry.\nMartha hastened to meet Jesus, her heart agitated by conflicting\nemotions. In His expressive face she read the same tenderness\nand love that had always been there. Her confidence in Him was\nunbroken, but she thought of her dearly loved brother, whom Jesus\nalso had loved. With grief surging in her heart because Christ had not\n460 The Desire of Ages\ncome before, yet with hope that even now He would do something to\ncomfort them, she said, \u201cLord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother\nhad not died.\u201d Over and over again, amid the tumult made by the\nmourners, the sisters had repeated these words.\nWith human and divine pity Jesus looked into her sorrowful,\ncareworn face. Martha had no inclination to recount the past; all was[530]\nexpressed by the pathetic words, \u201cLord, if Thou hadst been here, my\nbrother had not died.\u201d But looking into that face of love, she added,\n\u201cI know, that even now, whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will\ngive it Thee.\u201d\nJesus encouraged her faith, saying, \u201cThy brother shall rise again.\u201d\nHis answer was not intended to inspire hope of an immediate change.\nHe carried Martha\u2019s thoughts beyond the present restoration of her\nbrother, and fixed them upon the resurrection of the just. This He\ndid that she might see in the resurrection of Lazarus a pledge of the\nresurrection of all the righteous dead, and an assurance that it would\nbe accomplished by the Saviour\u2019s power.\nMartha answered, \u201cI know that he shall rise again in the resur-\nrection at the last day.\u201d\nStill seeking to give a true direction to her faith, Jesus declared,\n\u201cI am the resurrection, and the life.\u201d In Christ is life, original, unbor-\nrowed, underived. \u201cHe that hath the Son hath life.\u201d 1 John 5:12. The\ndivinity of Christ is the believer\u2019s assurance of eternal life. \u201cHe that\nbelieveth in Me,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cthough he were dead, yet shall he live:\nand whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest\nthou this?\u201d Christ here looks forward to the time of His second com-\ning. Then the righteous dead shall be raised incorruptible, and the\nliving righteous shall be translated to heaven without seeing death.\nThe miracle which Christ was about to perform, in raising Lazarus\nfrom the dead, would represent the resurrection of all the righteous\ndead. By His word and His works He declared Himself the Author\nof the resurrection. He who Himself was soon to die upon the cross\nstood with the keys of death, a conqueror of the grave, and asserted\nHis right and power to give eternal life.\nTo the Saviour\u2019s words, \u201cBelievest thou?\u201d Martha responded,\n\u201cYea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which\nshould come into the world.\u201d She did not comprehend in all their\nsignificance the words spoken by Christ, but she confessed her faith\n\u201cLazarus, Come Forth\u201d 461\nin His divinity, and her confidence that He was able to perform\nwhatever it pleased Him to do.\n\u201cAnd when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary\nher sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.\u201d\nShe delivered her message as quietly as possible; for the priests and\nrulers were prepared to arrest Jesus when opportunity offered. The\ncries of the mourners prevented her words from being heard.\nOn hearing the message, Mary rose hastily, and with an eager [531]\n[532]\n[533]\nlook on her face left the room. Thinking that she had gone to the\ngrave to weep, the mourners followed her. When she reached the\nplace where Jesus was waiting, she knelt at His feet, and said with\nquivering lips, \u201cLord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not\ndied.\u201d The cries of the mourners were painful to her; for she longed\nfor a few quiet words alone with Jesus. But she knew of the envy\nand jealousy cherished in the hearts of some present against Christ,\nand she was restrained from fully expressing her grief.\n\u201cWhen Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weep-\ning which came with her, He groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.\u201d\nHe read the hearts of all assembled. He saw that with many, what\npassed as a demonstration of grief was only pretense. He knew that\nsome in the company, now manifesting hypocritical sorrow, would\nerelong be planning the death, not only of the mighty miracle worker,\nbut of the one to be raised from the dead. Christ could have stripped\nfrom them their robe of pretended sorrow. But He restrained His\nrighteous indignation. The words He could in all truth have spoken,\nHe did not speak, because of the loved one kneeling at His feet in\nsorrow, who truly believed in Him.\n\u201cWhere have ye laid him?\u201d He asked, \u201cThey said unto Him,\nLord, come and see.\u201d Together they proceeded to the grave. It was\na mournful scene. Lazarus had been much beloved, and his sisters\nwept for him with breaking hearts, while those who had been his\nfriends mingled their tears with those of the bereaved sisters. In\nview of this human distress, and of the fact that the afflicted friends\ncould mourn over the dead while the Saviour of the world stood by,\u2014\n\u201cJesus wept.\u201d Though He was the Son of God, yet He had taken\nhuman nature upon Him, and He was moved by human sorrow. His\ntender, pitying heart is ever awakened to sympathy by suffering. He\nweeps with those that weep, and rejoices with those that rejoice.\n462 The Desire of Ages\nBut it was not only because of His human sympathy with Mary\nand Martha that Jesus wept. In His tears there was a sorrow as high\nabove human sorrow as the heavens are higher than the earth. Christ\ndid not weep for Lazarus; for He was about to call him from the\ngrave. He wept because many of those now mourning for Lazarus\nwould soon plan the death of Him who was the resurrection and the\nlife. But how unable were the unbelieving Jews rightly to interpret\nHis tears! Some, who could see nothing more than the outward[534]\ncircumstances of the scene before Him as a cause for His grief, said\nsoftly, \u201cBehold how He loved him!\u201d Others, seeking to drop the seed\nof unbelief into the hearts of those present, said derisively, \u201cCould\nnot this Man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that\neven this man should not have died?\u201d If it were in Christ\u2019s power to\nsave Lazarus, why then did He suffer him to die?\nWith prophetic eye Christ saw the enmity of the Pharisees and\nthe Sadducees. He knew that they were premeditating His death. He\nknew that some of those now apparently so sympathetic would soon\nclose against themselves the door of hope and the gates of the city\nof God. A scene was about to take place, in His humiliation and\ncrucifixion, that would result in the destruction of Jerusalem, and at\nthat time none would make lamentation for the dead. The retribution\nthat was coming upon Jerusalem was plainly portrayed before Him.\nHe saw Jerusalem compassed by the Roman legions. He knew that\nmany now weeping for Lazarus would die in the siege of the city,\nand in their death there would be no hope.\nIt was not only because of the scene before Him that Christ wept.\nThe weight of the grief of ages was upon Him. He saw the terrible\neffects of the transgression of God\u2019s law. He saw that in the history\nof the world, beginning with the death of Abel, the conflict between\ngood and evil had been unceasing. Looking down the years to come,\nHe saw the suffering and sorrow, tears and death, that were to be the\nlot of men. His heart was pierced with the pain of the human family\nof all ages and in all lands. The woes of the sinful race were heavy\nupon His soul, and the fountain of His tears was broken up as He\nlonged to relieve all their distress.\n\u201cJesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave.\u201d\nLazarus had been laid in a cave in a rock, and a massive stone\nhad been placed before the entrance. \u201cTake ye away the stone,\u201d\n\u201cLazarus, Come Forth\u201d 463\nChrist said. Thinking that He only wished to look upon the dead,\nMartha objected, saying that the body had been buried four days, and\ncorruption had already begun its work. This statement, made before\nthe raising of Lazarus, left no room for Christ\u2019s enemies to say that a\ndeception had been practiced. In the past the Pharisees had circulated\nfalse statements regarding the most wonderful manifestations of the\npower of God. When Christ raised to life the daughter of Jairus, He\nhad said, \u201cThe damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.\u201d Mark 5:39. As she\nhad been sick only a short time, and was raised immediately after [535]\ndeath, the Pharisees declared that the child had not been dead; that\nChrist Himself had said she was only asleep. They had tried to make\nit appear that Christ could not cure disease, that there was foul play\nabout His miracles. But in this case, none could deny that Lazarus\nwas dead.\nWhen the Lord is about to do a work, Satan moves upon someone\nto object. \u201cTake ye away the stone,\u201d Christ said. As far as possible,\nprepare the way for My work. But Martha\u2019s positive and ambitious\nnature asserted itself. She was unwilling that the decomposing body\nshould be brought to view. The human heart is slow to understand\nChrist\u2019s words, and Martha\u2019s faith had not grasped the true meaning\nof His promise.\nChrist reproved Martha, but His words were spoken with the\nutmost gentleness. \u201cSaid I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest\nbelieve, thou shouldest see the glory of God?\u201d Why should you\ndoubt in regard to My power? Why reason in opposition to My\nrequirements? You have My word. If you will believe, you shall see\nthe glory of God. Natural impossibilities cannot prevent the work\nof the Omnipotent One. Skepticism and unbelief are not humility.\nImplicit belief in Christ\u2019s word is true humility, true self-surrender.\n\u201cTake ye away the stone.\u201d Christ could have commanded the\nstone to remove, and it would have obeyed His voice. He could have\nbidden the angels who were close by His side to do this. At His\nbidding, invisible hands would have removed the stone. But it was\nto be taken away by human hands. Thus Christ would show that\nhumanity is to co-operate with divinity. What human power can do\ndivine power is not summoned to do. God does not dispense with\nman\u2019s aid. He strengthens him, co-operating with him as he uses the\npowers and capabilities given him.\n464 The Desire of Ages\nThe command is obeyed. The stone is rolled away. Everything\nis done openly and deliberately. All are given a chance to see that no\ndeception is practiced. There lies the body of Lazarus in its rocky\ngrave, cold and silent in death. The cries of the mourners are hushed.\nSurprised and expectant, the company stand around the sepulcher,\nwaiting to see what is to follow.\nCalmly Christ stands before the tomb. A sacred solemnity rests\nupon all present. Christ steps closer to the sepulcher. Lifting His\neyes to heaven, He says, \u201cFather, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard\nMe.\u201d Not long before this, Christ\u2019s enemies had accused Him of\nblasphemy, and had taken up stones to cast at Him because He\nclaimed to be the Son of God. They accused Him of performing[536]\nmiracles by the power of Satan. But here Christ claims God as His\nFather, and with perfect confidence declares that He is the Son of\nGod.\nIn all that He did, Christ was co-operating with His Father. Ever\nHe had been careful to make it evident that He did not work inde-\npendently; it was by faith and prayer that He wrought His miracles.\nChrist desired all to know His relationship with His Father. \u201cFather,\u201d\nHe said, \u201cI thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me. And I knew that\nThou hearest Me always: but because of the people which stand\nby I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\u201d Here\nthe disciples and the people were to be given the most convincing\nevidence in regard to the relationship existing between Christ and\nGod. They were to be shown that Christ\u2019s claim was not a deception.\n\u201cAnd when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice,\nLazarus, come forth.\u201d His voice, clear and penetrating, pierces the\near of the dead. As He speaks, divinity flashes through humanity.\nIn His face, which is lighted up by the glory of God, the people see\nthe assurance of His power. Every eye is fastened on the entrance\nto the cave. Every ear is bent to catch the slightest sound. With\nintense and painful interest all wait for the test of Christ\u2019s divinity,\nthe evidence that is to substantiate His claim to be the Son of God,\nor to extinguish the hope forever.\nThere is a stir in the silent tomb, and he who was dead stands\nat the door of the sepulcher. His movements are impeded by the\ngraveclothes in which he was laid away, and Christ says to the\nastonished spectators, \u201cLoose him, and let him go.\u201d Again they are\n\u201cLazarus, Come Forth\u201d 465\nshown that the human worker is to co-operate with God. Humanity\nis to work for humanity. Lazarus is set free, and stands before\nthe company, not as one emaciated from disease, and with feeble,\ntottering limbs, but as a man in the prime of life, and in the vigor of\na noble manhood. His eyes beam with intelligence and with love for\nhis Saviour. He casts himself in adoration at the feet of Jesus.\nThe beholders are at first speechless with amazement. Then there\nfollows an inexpressible scene of rejoicing and thanksgiving. The\nsisters receive their brother back to life as the gift of God, and with\njoyful tears they brokenly express their thanks to the Saviour. But\nwhile brother, sisters, and friends are rejoicing in this reunion, Jesus\nwithdraws from the scene. When they look for the Life-giver, He is\nnot to be found.\nChapter 59\u2014Priestly Plottings[537]\nThis chapter is based on John 11:47-54.\nBethany was so near Jerusalem that the news of the raising\nof Lazarus was soon carried to the city. Through spies who had\nwitnessed the miracle the Jewish rulers were speedily in possession\nof the facts. A meeting of the Sanhedrin was at once called to decide\nas to what should be done. Christ had now fully made manifest\nHis control of death and the grave. That mighty miracle was the\ncrowning evidence offered by God to men that He had sent His\nSon into the world for their salvation. It was a demonstration of\ndivine power sufficient to convince every mind that was under the\ncontrol of reason and enlightened conscience. Many who witnessed\nthe resurrection of Lazarus were led to believe on Jesus. But the\nhatred of the priests against Him was intensified. They had rejected\nall lesser evidence of His divinity, and they were only enraged at\nthis new miracle. The dead had been raised in the full light of day,\nand before a crowd of witnesses. No artifice could explain away\nsuch evidence. For this very reason the enmity of the priests grew\ndeadlier. They were more than ever determined to put a stop to\nChrist\u2019s work.\nThe Sadducees, though not favorable to Christ, had not been so\nfull of malignity toward Him as were the Pharisees. Their hatred had\nnot been so bitter. But they were now thoroughly alarmed. They did\nnot believe in a resurrection of the dead. Producing so-called science,[538]\nthey had reasoned that it would be an impossibility for a dead body\nto be brought to life. But by a few words from Christ their theory\nhad been overthrown. They were shown to be ignorant both of the\nScriptures and of the power of God. They could see no possibility of\nremoving the impression made on the people by the miracle. How\ncould men be turned away from Him who had prevailed to rob the\ngrave of its dead? Lying reports were put in circulation, but the\nmiracle could not be denied, and how to counteract its effect they\n466\nPriestly Plottings 467\nknew not. Thus far the Sadducees had not encouraged the plan of\nputting Christ to death. But after the resurrection of Lazarus they\ndecided that only by His death could His fearless denunciations\nagainst them be stopped.\nThe Pharisees believed in the resurrection, and they could not\nbut see that this miracle was an evidence that the Messiah was\namong them. But they had ever opposed Christ\u2019s work. From the\nfirst they had hated Him because He had exposed their hypocritical\npretensions. He had torn aside the cloak of rigorous rites under\nwhich their moral deformity was hidden. The pure religion that\nHe taught had condemned their hollow professions of piety. They\nthirsted to be revenged upon Him for His pointed rebukes. They\nhad tried to provoke Him to say or do something that would give\nthem occasion to condemn Him. Several times they had attempted\nto stone Him, but He had quietly withdrawn, and they had lost sight\nof Him.\nThe miracles He performed on the Sabbath were all for the\nrelief of the afflicted, but the Pharisees had sought to condemn\nHim as a Sabbathbreaker. They had tried to arouse the Herodians\nagainst Him. They represented that He was seeking to set up a rival\nkingdom, and consulted with them how to destroy Him. To excite\nthe Romans against Him, they had represented Him as trying to\nsubvert their authority. They had tried every pretext to cut Him off\nfrom influencing the people. But so far their attempts had been\nfoiled. The multitudes who witnessed His works of mercy and heard\nHis pure and holy teachings knew that these were not the deeds and\nwords of a Sabbathbreaker or blasphemer. Even the officers sent by\nthe Pharisees had been so influenced by His words that they could\nnot lay hands on Him. In desperation the Jews had finally passed an\nedict that any man who professed faith in Jesus should be cast out\nof the synagogue.\nSo, as the priests, the rulers, and the elders gathered for consul-\ntation, it was their fixed determination to silence Him who did such\nmarvelous works that all men wondered. Pharisees and Sadducees [539]\nwere more nearly united than ever before. Divided hitherto, they\nbecame one in their opposition to Christ. Nicodemus and Joseph\nhad, in former councils, prevented the condemnation of Jesus, and\nfor this reason they were not now summoned. There were present\n468 The Desire of Ages\nat the council other influential men who believed on Jesus, but their\ninfluence prevailed nothing against that of the malignant Pharisees.\nYet the members of the council were not all agreed. The San-\nhedrin was not at this time a legal assembly. It existed only by\ntolerance. Some of its number questioned the wisdom of putting\nChrist to death. They feared that this would excite an insurrection\namong the people, causing the Romans to withhold further favors\nfrom the priesthood, and to take from them the power they still held.\nThe Sadducees were united in their hatred of Christ, yet they were\ninclined to be cautious in their movements, fearing that the Romans\nwould deprive them of their high standing.\nIn this council, assembled to plan the death of Christ, the Witness\nwas present who heard the boastful words of Nebuchadnezzar, who\nwitnessed the idolatrous feast of Belshazzar, who was present when\nChrist in Nazareth announced Himself the Anointed One. This\nWitness was now impressing the rulers with the work they were\ndoing. Events in the life of Christ rose up before them with a\ndistinctness that alarmed them. They remembered the scene in the\ntemple, when Jesus, then a child of twelve, stood before the learned\ndoctors of the law, asking them questions at which they wondered.\nThe miracle just performed bore witness that Jesus was none other\nthan the Son of God. In their true significance, the Old Testament\nScriptures regarding Christ flashed before their minds. Perplexed\nand troubled, the rulers asked, \u201cWhat do we?\u201d There was a division\nin the council. Under the impression of the Holy Spirit, the priests\nand rulers could not banish the conviction that they were fighting\nagainst God.\nWhile the council was at the height of its perplexity, Caiaphas the\nhigh priest arose. Caiaphas was a proud and cruel man, overbearing\nand intolerant. Among his family connections were Sadducees,\nproud, bold, reckless, full of ambition and cruelty, which they hid\nunder a cloak of pretended righteousness. Caiaphas had studied the\nprophecies, and although ignorant of their true meaning, he spoke\nwith great authority and assurance: \u201cYe know nothing at all, nor\nconsider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the\npeople, and that the whole nation perish not.\u201d Even if Jesus were[540]\ninnocent, urged the high priest, He must be put out of the way. He\nwas troublesome, drawing the people to Himself, and lessening\nPriestly Plottings 469\nthe authority of the rulers. He was only one; it was better that He\nshould die than that the authority of the rulers should be weakened.\nIf the people were to lose confidence in their rulers, the national\npower would be destroyed. Caiaphas urged that after this miracle\nthe followers of Jesus would likely rise in revolt. The Romans will\nthen come, he said, and will close our temple, and abolish our laws,\ndestroying us as a nation. What is the life of this Galilean worth in\ncomparison with the life of the nation? If He stands in the way of\nIsrael\u2019s well-being, is it not doing God a service to remove Him?\nBetter that one man perish than that the whole nation be destroyed.\nIn declaring that one man should die for the nation, Caiaphas\nindicated that he had some knowledge of the prophecies, although it\nwas very limited. But John, in his account of this scene, takes up the\nprophecy, and shows its broad and deep significance. He says, \u201cAnd\nnot for that nation only, but that also He should gather together in\none the children of God that were scattered abroad.\u201d How blindly\ndid the haughty Caiaphas acknowledge the Saviour\u2019s mission!\nOn the lips of Caiaphas this most precious truth was turned into\na lie. The policy he advocated was based on a principle borrowed\nfrom heathenism. Among the heathen, the dim consciousness that\none was to die for the human race had led to the offering of human\nsacrifices. So Caiaphas proposed by the sacrifice of Jesus to save the\nguilty nation, not from transgression, but in transgression, that they\nmight continue in sin. And by his reasoning he thought to silence\nthe remonstrances of those who might dare to say that as yet nothing\nworthy of death had been found in Jesus.\nAt this council Christ\u2019s enemies had been deeply convicted. The\nHoly Spirit had impressed their minds. But Satan strove to gain\ncontrol of them. He urged upon their notice the grievances they\nhad suffered on account of Christ. How little He had honored their\nrighteousness. He presented a righteousness far greater, which all\nwho would be children of God must possess. Taking no notice\nof their forms and ceremonies, He had encouraged sinners to go\ndirectly to God as a merciful Father, and make known their wants.\nThus, in their opinion, He had set aside the priesthood. He had\nrefused to acknowledge the theology of the rabbinical schools. He\nhad exposed the evil practices of the priests, and had irreparably [541]\nhurt their influence. He had injured the effect of their maxims and\n470 The Desire of Ages\ntraditions, declaring that though they strictly enforced the ritual law,\nthey made void the law of God. All this Satan now brought to their\nminds.\nSatan told them that in order to maintain their authority, they\nmust put Jesus to death. This counsel they followed. The fact that\nthey might lose the power they then exercised, was, they thought,\nsufficient reason for coming to some decision. With the exception\nof a few who dared not speak their minds, the Sanhedrin received\nthe words of Caiaphas as the words of God. Relief came to the\ncouncil; the discord ceased. They resolved to put Christ to death\nat the first favorable opportunity. In rejecting the proof of the di-\nvinity of Jesus, these priests and rulers had locked themselves in\nimpenetrable darkness. They had come wholly under the sway of\nSatan, to be hurried by him over the brink of eternal ruin. Yet such\nwas their deception that they were well pleased with themselves.\nThey regarded themselves as patriots, who were seeking the nation\u2019s\nsalvation.\nThe Sanhedrin feared, however, to take rash measures against\nJesus, lest the people should become incensed, and the violence\nmeditated toward Him should fall upon themselves. On this account\nthe council delayed to execute the sentence they had pronounced.\nThe Saviour understood the plotting of the priests. He knew that\nthey longed to remove Him, and that their purpose would soon be\naccomplished. But it was not His place to hasten the crisis, and He\nwithdrew from that region, taking the disciples with Him. Thus by\nHis own example Jesus again enforced the instruction He had given\nto the disciples, \u201cWhen they persecute you in this city, flee ye into\nanother.\u201d Matthew 10:23. There was a wide field in which to work\nfor the salvation of souls; and unless loyalty to Him required it, the\nLord\u2019s servants were not to imperil their lives.\nJesus had now given three years of public labor to the world.\nHis example of self-denial and disinterested benevolence was before\nthem. His life of purity, of suffering and devotion, was known to all.\nYet this short period of three years was as long as the world could\nendure the presence of its Redeemer.\nHis life had been one of persecution and insult. Driven from\nBethlehem by a jealous king, rejected by His own people at Nazareth,\ncondemned to death without a cause at Jerusalem, Jesus, with His\nPriestly Plottings 471\nfew faithful followers, found a temporary asylum in a strange city.\nHe who was ever touched by human woe, who healed the sick, [542]\nrestored sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and speech to the\ndumb, who fed the hungry and comforted the sorrowful, was driven\nfrom the people He had labored to save. He who walked upon the\nheaving billows, and by a word silenced their angry roaring, who\ncast out devils that in departing acknowledged Him to be the Son\nof God, who broke the slumbers of the dead, who held thousands\nentranced by His words of wisdom, was unable to reach the hearts of\nthose who were blinded by prejudice and hatred, and who stubbornly\nrejected the light.\nChapter 60\u2014The Law of the New Kingdom[543]\n[544]\n[545]\n[546]\n[547]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 20:20-28; Mark 10:32-45; Luke\n18:31-34.\nThe time of the Passover was drawing near, and again Jesus\nturned toward Jerusalem. In His heart was the peace of perfect\noneness with the Father\u2019s will, and with eager steps He pressed on\ntoward the place of sacrifice. But a sense of mystery, of doubt and\nfear, fell upon the disciples. The Saviour \u201cwent before them: and\nthey were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid.\u201d\nAgain Christ called the twelve about Him, and with greater\ndefiniteness than ever before, He opened to them His betrayal and\nsufferings. \u201cBehold,\u201d He said, \u201cwe go up to Jerusalem, and all things\nthat are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall\nbe accomplished. For He shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and\nshall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: and they\nshall scourge Him, and put Him to death: and the third day He\nshall rise again. And they understood none of these things: and this\nsaying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were\nspoken.\u201d\nHad they not just before proclaimed everywhere, \u201cThe kingdom\nof heaven is at hand\u201d? Had not Christ Himself promised that many\nshould sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom\nof God? Had He not promised to all who had left aught for His\nsake a hundredfold in this life, and a part in His kingdom? And\nhad He not given to the twelve the special promise of positions of\nhigh honor in His kingdom,\u2014to sit on thrones judging the twelve\ntribes of Israel? Even now He had said that all things written in[548]\nthe prophets concerning Him should be fulfilled. And had not the\nprophets foretold the glory of the Messiah\u2019s reign? In the light\nof these thoughts, His words in regard to betrayal, persecution,\nand death seemed vague and shadowy. Whatever difficulties might\nintervene, they believed that the kingdom was soon to be established.\n472\nLaw of the New Kingdom 473\nJohn, the son of Zebedee, had been one of the first two disciples\nwho had followed Jesus. He and his brother James had been among\nthe first group who had left all for His service. Gladly they had\nforsaken home and friends that they might be with Him; they had\nwalked and talked with Him; they had been with Him in the privacy\nof the home, and in the public assemblies. He had quieted their fears,\ndelivered them from danger, relieved their sufferings, comforted their\ngrief, and with patience and tenderness had taught them, till their\nhearts seemed linked with His, and in the ardor of their love they\nlonged to be nearest to Him in His kingdom. At every possible\nopportunity, John took his place next the Saviour, and James longed\nto be honored with as close connection with Him.\nTheir mother was a follower of Christ, and had ministered to\nHim freely of her substance. With a mother\u2019s love and ambition for\nher sons, she coveted for them the most honored place in the new\nkingdom. For this she encouraged them to make request.\nTogether the mother and her sons came to Jesus, asking that He\nwould grant a petition on which their hearts were set.\n\u201cWhat would ye that I should do for you?\u201d He questioned.\nThe mother answered, \u201cGrant that these my two sons may sit, the\none on Thy right hand, and the other on the left, in Thy kingdom.\u201d\nJesus bears tenderly with them, not rebuking their selfishness\nin seeking preference above their brethren. He reads their hearts,\nHe knows the depth of their attachment to Him. Their love is not a\nmere human affection; though defiled by the earthliness of its human\nchannel, it is an outflowing from the fountain of His own redeeming\nlove. He will not rebuke, but deepen and purify. He said, \u201cAre ye\nable to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with\nthe baptism that I am baptized with?\u201d They recall His mysterious\nwords, pointing to trial and suffering, yet answer confidently, \u201cWe\nare able.\u201d They would count it highest honor to prove their loyalty\nby sharing all that is to befall their Lord.\n\u201cYe shall drink indeed of My cup, and be baptized with the\nbaptism that I am baptized with,\u201d He said; before Him a cross\ninstead of a throne, two malefactors His companions at His right [549]\nhand and His left. John and James were to share with their Master in\nsuffering; the one, first of the brethren to perish with the sword; the\nother, longest of all to endure toil, and reproach, and persecution.\n474 The Desire of Ages\n\u201cBut to sit on My right hand, and on My left,\u201d He continued,\n\u201cis not Mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is\nprepared of My Father.\u201d In the kingdom of God, position is not\ngained through favoritism. It is not earned, nor is it received through\nan arbitrary bestowal. It is the result of character. The crown and\nthe throne are the tokens of a condition attained; they are the tokens\nof self-conquest through our Lord Jesus Christ.\nLong afterward, when the disciple had been brought into sympa-\nthy with Christ through the fellowship of His sufferings, the Lord\nrevealed to John what is the condition of nearness in His kingdom.\n\u201cTo him that overcometh,\u201d Christ said, \u201cwill I grant to sit with Me\nin My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My\nFather in His throne.\u201d \u201cHim that overcometh will I make a pillar in\nthe temple of My God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write\nupon him the name of My God, ... and I will write upon him My\nnew name.\u201d Revelation 3:21, 12. So Paul the apostle wrote, \u201cI am\nnow ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I\nhave fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the\nfaith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,\nwhich the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day.\u201d 2\nTimothy 4:6-8.\nThe one who stands nearest to Christ will be he who on earth has\ndrunk most deeply of the spirit of His self-sacrificing love,\u2014love\nthat \u201cvaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, ... seeketh not her own, is\nnot easily provoked, thinketh no evil\u201d (1 Corinthians 13:4, 5),\u2014love\nthat moves the disciple, as it moved our Lord, to give all, to live and\nlabor and sacrifice, even unto death, for the saving of humanity. This\nspirit was made manifest in the life of Paul. He said, \u201cFor to me\nto live is Christ;\u201d for his life revealed Christ to men; \u201cand to die is\ngain,\u201d\u2014gain to Christ; death itself would make manifest the power\nof His grace, and gather souls to Him. \u201cChrist shall be magnified in\nmy body,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it be by life or by death.\u201d Philippians\n1:21, 20.\nWhen the ten heard of the request of James and John, they were\nmuch displeased. The highest place in the kingdom was just what\nevery one of them was seeking for himself, and they were angry that\nthe two disciples had gained a seeming advantage over them.\nAgain the strife as to which should be greatest seemed about to[550]\nLaw of the New Kingdom 475\nbe renewed, when Jesus, calling them to Him, said to the indignant\ndisciples, \u201cYe know that they which are accounted to rule over the\nGentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise\nauthority upon them. But so shall it not be among you.\u201d\nIn the kingdoms of the world, position meant self-aggrandize-\nment. The people were supposed to exist for the benefit of the ruling\nclasses. Influence, wealth, education, were so many means of gain-\ning control of the masses for the use of the leaders. The higher\nclasses were to think, decide, enjoy, and rule; the lower were to obey\nand serve. Religion, like all things else, was a matter of authority.\nThe people were expected to believe and practice as their superiors\ndirected. The right of man as man, to think and act for himself, was\nwholly unrecognized.\nChrist was establishing a kingdom on different principles. He\ncalled men, not to authority, but to service, the strong to bear the\ninfirmities of the weak. Power, position, talent, education, placed\ntheir possessor under the greater obligation to serve his fellows. To\neven the lowliest of Christ\u2019s disciples it is said, \u201cAll things are for\nyour sakes.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:15.\n\u201cThe Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minis-\nter, and to give His life a ransom for many.\u201d Among His disciples\nChrist was in every sense a caretaker, a burden bearer. He shared\ntheir poverty, He practiced self-denial on their account, He went\nbefore them to smooth the more difficult places, and soon He would\nconsummate His work on earth by laying down His life. The princi-\nple on which Christ acted is to actuate the members of the church\nwhich is His body. The plan and ground of salvation is love. In the\nkingdom of Christ those are greatest who follow the example He has\ngiven, and act as shepherds of His flock.\nThe words of Paul reveal the true dignity and honor of the Chris-\ntian life: \u201cThough I be free from all men, yet have I made myself\nservant unto all,\u201d \u201cnot seeking mine own profit, but the profit of\nmany, that they may be saved.\u201d 1 Corinthians 9:19; 10:33.\nIn matters of conscience the soul must be left untrammeled. No\none is to control another\u2019s mind, to judge for another, or to prescribe\nhis duty. God gives to every soul freedom to think, and to follow his\nown convictions. \u201cEvery one of us shall give account of himself to\nGod.\u201d No one has a right to merge his own individuality in that of\n476 The Desire of Ages\nanother. In all matters where principle is involved, \u201clet every man\nbe fully persuaded in his own mind.\u201d Romans 14:12, 5. In Christ\u2019s\nkingdom there is no lordly oppression, no compulsion of manner.[551]\nThe angels of heaven do not come to the earth to rule, and to exact\nhomage, but as messengers of mercy, to co-operate with men in\nuplifting humanity.\nThe principles and the very words of the Saviour\u2019s teaching, in\ntheir divine beauty, dwelt in the memory of the beloved disciple.\nTo his latest days the burden of John\u2019s testimony to the churches\nwas, \u201cThis is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that\nwe should love one another.\u201d \u201cHereby perceive we the love of God,\nbecause He laid down His life for us: and we ought to lay down our\nlives for the brethren.\u201d 1 John 3:11, 16.\nThis was the spirit that pervaded the early church. After the\noutpouring of the Holy Spirit, \u201cthe multitude of them that believed\nwere of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that\naught of the things which he possessed was his own.\u201d \u201cNeither was\nthere any among them that lacked.\u201d \u201cAnd with great power gave\nthe apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great\ngrace was upon them all.\u201d Acts 4:32, 34, 33.\nChapter 61\u2014Zacchaeus [552]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 19:1-10.\nOn the way to Jerusalem \u201cJesus entered and passed through\nJericho.\u201d A few miles from the Jordan, on the western edge of the\nvalley that here spread out into a plain, the city lay in the midst of\ntropic verdure and luxuriance of beauty. With its palm trees and\nrich gardens watered by living springs, it gleamed like an emerald\nin the setting of limestone hills and desolate ravines that interposed\nbetween Jerusalem and the city of the plain.\nMany caravans on their way to the feast passed through Jericho.\nTheir arrival was always a festive season, but now a deeper interest\nstirred the people. It was known that the Galilean Rabbi who had so\nlately brought Lazarus to life was in the throng; and though whispers\nwere rife as to the plottings of the priests, the multitudes were eager\nto do Him homage.\nJericho was one of the cities anciently set apart for the priests,\nand at this time large numbers of priests had their residence there.\nBut the city had also a population of a widely different character.\nIt was a great center of traffic, and Roman officials and soldiers,\nwith strangers from different quarters, were found there, while the\ncollection of customs made it the home of many publicans.\n\u201cThe chief among the publicans,\u201d Zacchaeus, was a Jew, and\ndetested by his countrymen. His rank and wealth were the reward of\na calling they abhorred, and which was regarded as another name [553]\nfor injustice and extortion. Yet the wealthy customs officer was not\naltogether the hardened man of the world that he seemed. Beneath\nthe appearance of worldliness and pride was a heart susceptible to\ndivine influences. Zacchaeus had heard of Jesus. The report of\nOne who had borne Himself with kindness and courtesy toward\nthe proscribed classes had spread far and wide. In this chief of the\npublicans was awakened a longing for a better life. Only a few\nmiles from Jericho, John the Baptist had preached at the Jordan, and\n477\n478 The Desire of Ages\nZacchaeus had heard of the call to repentance. The instruction to\nthe publicans, \u201cExact no more than that which is appointed you\u201d\n(Luke 3:13), though outwardly disregarded, had impressed his mind.\nHe knew the Scriptures, and was convicted that his practice was\nwrong. Now, hearing the words reported to have come from the\nGreat Teacher, he felt that he was a sinner in the sight of God. Yet\nwhat he had heard of Jesus kindled hope in his heart. Repentance,\nreformation of life, was possible, even to him; was not one of the\nnew Teacher\u2019s most trusted disciples a publican? Zacchaeus began\nat once to follow the conviction that had taken hold upon him, and\nto make restitution to those whom he had wronged.\nAlready he had begun thus to retrace his steps, when the news\nsounded through Jericho that Jesus was entering the town. Zacchaeus\ndetermined to see Him. He was beginning to realize how bitter are\nthe fruits of sin, and how difficult the path of him who tries to\nreturn from a course of wrong. To be misunderstood, to be met with\nsuspicion and distrust in the effort to correct his errors, was hard to\nbear. The chief publican longed to look upon the face of Him whose\nwords had brought hope to his heart.\nThe streets were crowded, and Zacchaeus, who was small of\nstature, could see nothing over the heads of the people. None would\ngive way for him; so, running a little in advance of the multitude,\nto where a wide-branching fig tree hung over the way, the rich tax\ncollector climbed to a seat among the boughs, whence he could\nsurvey the procession as it passed below. The crowd comes near, it\nis going by, and Zacchaeus scans with eager eyes to discern the one\nfigure he longs to see.\nAbove the clamor of priests and rabbis and the shouts of welcome\nfrom the multitude, that unuttered desire of the chief publican spoke\nto the heart of Jesus. Suddenly, just beneath the fig tree, a group\nhalts, the company before and behind come to a standstill, and One\nlooks upward whose glance seems to read the soul. Almost doubting\nhis senses, the man in the tree hears the words, \u201cZacchaeus, make[554]\nhaste, and come down; for today I must abide at thy house.\u201d\nThe multitude give way, and Zacchaeus, walking as in a dream,\nleads the way toward his own home. But the rabbis look on with\nscowling faces, and murmur in discontent and scorn, \u201cthat He was\ngone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.\u201d\nZacchaeus 479\nZacchaeus had been overwhelmed, amazed, and silenced at the\nlove and condescension of Christ in stooping to him, so unworthy.\nNow love and loyalty to his new-found Master unseal his lips. He\nwill make public his confession and his repentance.\nIn the presence of the multitude, \u201cZacchaeus stood, and said [555]\nunto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor;\nand if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I\nrestore him fourfold.\n\u201cAnd Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this\nhouse, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.\u201d\nWhen the rich young ruler had turned away from Jesus, the\ndisciples had marveled at their Master\u2019s saying, \u201cHow hard is it for\nthem that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!\u201d They had\nexclaimed one to another, \u201cWho then can be saved?\u201d Now they had\na demonstration of the truth of Christ\u2019s words, \u201cThe things which\nare impossible with men are possible with God.\u201d Mark 10:24, 26;\nLuke 18:27. They saw how, through the grace of God, a rich man\ncould enter into the kingdom.\nBefore Zacchaeus had looked upon the face of Christ, he had\nbegun the work that made him manifest as a true penitent. Before\nbeing accused by man, he had confessed his sin. He had yielded\nto the conviction of the Holy Spirit, and had begun to carry out\nthe teaching of the words written for ancient Israel as well as for\nourselves. The Lord had said long before, \u201cIf thy brother be waxen\npoor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea,\nthough he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.\nTake thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy\nbrother may live with thee. Thou shalt not give him thy money upon\nusury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.\u201d \u201cYe shall not therefore\noppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God.\u201d Leviticus 25:35-\n37, 17. These words had been spoken by Christ Himself when He\nwas enshrouded in the pillar of cloud, and the very first response\nof Zacchaeus to the love of Christ was in manifesting compassion\ntoward the poor and suffering.\nAmong the publicans there was a confederacy, so that they could\noppress the people, and sustain one another in their fraudulent prac-\ntices. In their extortion they were but carrying out what had be-\ncome an almost universal custom. Even the priests and rabbis who\n480 The Desire of Ages\ndespised them were guilty of enriching themselves by dishonest\npractices under cover of their sacred calling. But no sooner did\nZacchaeus yield to the influence of the Holy Spirit than he cast aside\nevery practice contrary to integrity.\nNo repentance is genuine that does not work reformation. The\nrighteousness of Christ is not a cloak to cover unconfessed and\nunforsaken sin; it is a principle of life that transforms the character[556]\nand controls the conduct. Holiness is wholeness for God; it is the\nentire surrender of heart and life to the indwelling of the principles\nof heaven.\nThe Christian in his business life is to represent to the world the\nmanner in which our Lord would conduct business enterprises. In\nevery transaction he is to make it manifest that God is his teacher.\n\u201cHoliness unto the Lord\u201d is to be written upon daybooks and ledgers,\non deeds, receipts, and bills of exchange. Those who profess to be\nfollowers of Christ, and who deal in an unrighteous manner, are\nbearing false witness against the character of a holy, just, and mer-\nciful God. Every converted soul will, like Zacchaeus, signalize the\nentrance of Christ into his heart by an abandonment of the unrigh-\nteous practices that have marked his life. Like the chief publican, he\nwill give proof of his sincerity by making restitution. The Lord says,\n\u201cIf the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed,\nwalk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; ... none of\nhis sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: ... He\nshall surely live.\u201d Ezekiel 33:15, 16.\nIf we have injured others through any unjust business transaction,\nif we have overreached in trade, or defrauded any man, even though\nit be within the pale of the law, we should confess our wrong, and\nmake restitution as far as lies in our power. It is right for us to\nrestore not only that which we have taken, but all that it would have\naccumulated if put to a right and wise use during the time it has been\nin our possession.\nTo Zacchaeus the Saviour said, \u201cThis day is salvation come to\nthis house.\u201d Not only was Zacchaeus himself blessed, but all his\nhousehold with him. Christ went to his home to give him lessons\nof truth, and to instruct his household in the things of the kingdom.\nThey had been shut out from the synagogues by the contempt of\nrabbis and worshipers; but now, the most favored household in all\nZacchaeus 481\nJericho, they gathered in their own home about the divine Teacher,\nand heard for themselves the words of life.\nIt is when Christ is received as a personal Saviour that salvation\ncomes to the soul. Zacchaeus had received Jesus, not merely as a\npassing guest in his home, but as One to abide in the soul temple.\nThe scribes and Pharisees accused him as a sinner, they murmured\nagainst Christ for becoming his guest, but the Lord recognized him\nas a son of Abraham. For \u201cthey which are of faith, the same are the\nchildren of Abraham.\u201d Galatians 3:7.\nChapter 62\u2014The Feast at Simon\u2019s House[557]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-11; Luke\n7:36-50; John 11:55-57; John 12:1-11.\nSimon of Bethany was accounted a disciple of Jesus. He was\none of the few Pharisees who had openly joined Christ\u2019s followers.\nHe acknowledged Jesus as a teacher, and hoped that He might be the\nMessiah, but he had not accepted Him as a Saviour. His character\nwas not transformed; his principles were unchanged.\nSimon had been healed of the leprosy, and it was this that had\ndrawn him to Jesus. He desired to show his gratitude, and at Christ\u2019s\nlast visit to Bethany he made a feast for the Saviour and His disciples.\nThis feast brought together many of the Jews. There was at this\ntime much excitement at Jerusalem. Christ and His mission were\nattracting greater attention than ever before. Those who had come\nto the feast closely watched His movements, and some of them with\nunfriendly eyes.\nThe Saviour had reached Bethany only six days before the\nPassover, and according to His custom had sought rest at the home\nof Lazarus. The crowds of travelers who passed on to the city spread\nthe tidings that He was on His way to Jerusalem, and that He would\nrest over the Sabbath at Bethany. Among the people there was great\nenthusiasm. Many flocked to Bethany, some out of sympathy with\nJesus, and others from curiosity to see one who had been raised from\nthe dead.\nMany expected to hear from Lazarus a wonderful account of\nscenes witnessed after death. They were surprised that he told them\nnothing. He had nothing of this kind to tell. Inspiration declares,[558]\n\u201cThe dead know not anything.... Their love, and their hatred, and\ntheir envy, is now perished.\u201d Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6. But Lazarus did\nhave a wonderful testimony to bear in regard to the work of Christ.\nHe had been raised from the dead for this purpose. With assurance\nand power he declared that Jesus was the Son of God.\n482\nFeast at Simon\u2019s House 483\nThe reports carried back to Jerusalem by the visitors to Bethany\nincreased the excitement. The people were eager to see and hear\nJesus. There was a general inquiry as to whether Lazarus would\naccompany Him to Jerusalem, and if the prophet would be crowned\nking at the Passover. The priests and rulers saw that their hold upon\nthe people was still weakening, and their rage against Jesus grew\nmore bitter. They could hardly wait for the opportunity of removing\nHim forever from their way. As time passed, they began to fear that\nafter all He might not come to Jerusalem. They remembered how\noften He had baffled their murderous designs, and they were fearful\nthat He had now read their purposes against Him, and would remain\naway. They could ill conceal their anxiety, and questioned among\nthemselves, \u201cWhat think ye, that He will not come to the feast?\u201d\nA council of the priests and Pharisees was called. Since the\nraising of Lazarus the sympathies of the people were so fully with\nChrist that it would be dangerous to seize upon Him openly. So the\nauthorities determined to take Him secretly, and carry on the trial\nas quietly as possible. They hoped that when His condemnation\nbecame known, the fickle tide of public opinion would set in their\nfavor.\nThus they proposed to destroy Jesus. But so long as Lazarus\nlived, the priests and rabbis knew that they were not secure. The very\nexistence of a man who had been four days in the grave, and who\nhad been restored by a word from Jesus, would sooner or later cause\na reaction. The people would be avenged on their leaders for taking\nthe life of One who could perform such a miracle. The Sanhedrin\ntherefore decided that Lazarus also must die. To such lengths do\nenvy and prejudice lead their slaves. The hatred and unbelief of the\nJewish leaders had increased until they would even take the life of\none whom infinite power had rescued from the grave.\nWhile this plotting was going on at Jerusalem, Jesus and His\nfriends were invited to Simon\u2019s feast. At the table the Saviour sat\nwith Simon, whom He had cured of a loathsome disease, on one\nside, and Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead, on the other.\nMartha served at the table, but Mary was earnestly listening to every\nword from the lips of Jesus. In His mercy, Jesus had pardoned her [559]\nsins, He had called forth her beloved brother from the grave, and\nMary\u2019s heart was filled with gratitude. She had heard Jesus speak\n484 The Desire of Ages\nof His approaching death, and in her deep love and sorrow she had\nlonged to show Him honor. At great personal sacrifice she had\npurchased an alabaster box of \u201cointment of spikenard, very costly,\u201d\nwith which to anoint His body. But now many were declaring that\nHe was about to be crowned king. Her grief was turned to joy, and\nshe was eager to be first in honoring her Lord. Breaking her box of\nointment, she poured its contents upon the head and feet of Jesus;\nthen, as she knelt weeping, moistening them with her tears, she\nwiped His feet with her long, flowing hair.\nShe had sought to avoid observation, and her movements might\nhave passed unnoticed, but the ointment filled the room with its\nfragrance, and published her act to all present. Judas looked upon\nthis act with great displeasure. Instead of waiting to hear what Christ\nwould say of the matter, he began to whisper his complaints to\nthose near him, throwing reproach upon Christ for suffering such\nwaste. Craftily he made suggestions that would be likely to cause\ndisaffection.\nJudas was treasurer for the disciples, and from their little store\nhe had secretly drawn for his own use, thus narrowing down their\nresources to a meager pittance. He was eager to put into the bag all\nthat he could obtain. The treasure in the bag was often drawn upon\nto relieve the poor; and when something that Judas did not think\nessential was bought, he would say, Why is this waste? why was not\nthe cost of this put into the bag that I carry for the poor? Now the\nact of Mary was in such marked contrast to his selfishness that he\nwas put to shame; and according to his custom, he sought to assign a\nworthy motive for his objection to her gift. Turning to the disciples,\nhe asked, \u201cWhy was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence,\nand given to the poor? This he said, not that he cared for the poor;\nbut because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put\ntherein.\u201d Judas had no heart for the poor. Had Mary\u2019s ointment been\nsold, and the proceeds fallen into his possession, the poor would\nhave received no benefit.\nJudas had a high opinion of his own executive ability. As a\nfinancier he thought himself greatly superior to his fellow disciples,\nand he had led them to regard him in the same light. He had gained\ntheir confidence, and had a strong influence over them. His professed\nsympathy for the poor deceived them, and his artful insinuation\nFeast at Simon\u2019s House 485\ncaused them to look distrustfully upon Mary\u2019s devotion. The murmur [560]\npassed round the table, \u201cTo what purpose is this waste? For this\nointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.\u201d\nMary heard the words of criticism. Her heart trembled within\nher. She feared that her sister would reproach her for extravagance.\nThe Master, too, might think her improvident. Without apology or\nexcuse she was about to shrink away, when the voice of her Lord\nwas heard, \u201cLet her alone; why trouble ye her?\u201d He saw that she\nwas embarrassed and distressed. He knew that in this act of service\nshe had expressed her gratitude for the forgiveness of her sins, and\nHe brought relief to her mind. Lifting His voice above the murmur\nof criticism, He said, \u201cShe hath wrought a good work on Me. For\nye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may\ndo them good: but Me ye have not always. She hath done what she\ncould: she is come aforehand to anoint My body to the burying.\u201d\nThe fragrant gift which Mary had thought to lavish upon the\ndead body of the Saviour she poured upon His living form. At\nthe burial its sweetness could only have pervaded the tomb; now it\ngladdened His heart with the assurance of her faith and love. Joseph\nof Arimathaea and Nicodemus offered not their gift of love to Jesus\nin His life. With bitter tears they brought their costly spices for His\ncold, unconscious form. The women who bore spices to the tomb\nfound their errand in vain, for He had risen. But Mary, pouring out\nher love upon the Saviour while He was conscious of her devotion,\nwas anointing Him for the burial. And as He went down into the\ndarkness of His great trial, He carried with Him the memory of that\ndeed, an earnest of the love that would be His from His redeemed\nones forever.\nMany there are who bring their precious gifts for the dead. As\nthey stand about the cold, silent form, words of love are freely\nspoken. Tenderness, appreciation, devotion, all are lavished upon\none who sees not nor hears. Had these words been spoken when the\nweary spirit needed them so much, when the ear could hear and the\nheart could feel, how precious would have been their fragrance!\nMary knew not the full significance of her deed of love. She\ncould not answer her accusers. She could not explain why she\nhad chosen that occasion for anointing Jesus. The Holy Spirit had\nplanned for her, and she had obeyed His promptings. Inspiration\n486 The Desire of Ages\nstoops to give no reason. An unseen presence, it speaks to mind and\nsoul, and moves the heart to action. It is its own justification.\nChrist told Mary the meaning of her act, and in this He gave her\nmore than He had received. \u201cIn that she hath poured this ointment[561]\n[562]\n[563]\non My body,\u201d He said, \u201cshe did it for My burial.\u201d As the alabaster\nbox was broken, and filled the whole house with its fragrance, so\nChrist was to die, His body was to be broken; but He was to rise\nfrom the tomb, and the fragrance of His life was to fill the earth.\nChrist \u201chath loved us, and hath given Himself for us an offering and\na sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.\u201d Ephesians 5:2.\n\u201cVerily I say unto you,\u201d Christ declared, \u201cWheresoever this\ngospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that\nshe hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.\u201d Looking\ninto the future, the Saviour spoke with certainty concerning His\ngospel. It was to be preached throughout the world. And as far as\nthe gospel extended, Mary\u2019s gift would shed its fragrance, and hearts\nwould be blessed through her unstudied act. Kingdoms would rise\nand fall; the names of monarchs and conquerors would be forgotten;\nbut this woman\u2019s deed would be immortalized upon the pages of\nsacred history. Until time should be no more, that broken alabaster\nbox would tell the story of the abundant love of God for a fallen\nrace.\nMary\u2019s act was in marked contrast with that which Judas was\nabout to do. What a sharp lesson Christ might have given him who\nhad dropped the seed of criticism and evil thinking into the minds of\nthe disciples! How justly the accuser might have been accused! He\nwho reads the motives of every heart, and understands every action,\nmight have opened before those at the feast dark chapters in the\nexperience of Judas. The hollow pretense on which the traitor based\nhis words might have been laid bare; for, instead of sympathizing\nwith the poor, he was robbing them of the money intended for their\nrelief. Indignation might have been excited against him for his\noppression of the widow, the orphan, and the hireling. But had\nChrist unmasked Judas, this would have been urged as a reason for\nthe betrayal. And though charged with being a thief, Judas would\nhave gained sympathy, even among the disciples. The Saviour\nreproached him not, and thus avoided giving him an excuse for his\ntreachery.\nFeast at Simon\u2019s House 487\nBut the look which Jesus cast upon Judas convinced him that the\nSaviour penetrated his hypocrisy, and read his base, contemptible\ncharacter. And in commending Mary\u2019s action, which had been so\nseverely condemned, Christ had rebuked Judas. Prior to this, the\nSaviour had never given him a direct rebuke. Now the reproof\nrankled in his heart. He determined to be revenged. From the supper\nhe went directly to the palace of the high priest, where he found the [564]\ncouncil assembled, and he offered to betray Jesus into their hands.\nThe priests were greatly rejoiced. These leaders of Israel had\nbeen given the privilege of receiving Christ as their Saviour, without\nmoney and without price. But they refused the precious gift offered\nthem in the most tender spirit of constraining love. They refused to\naccept that salvation which is of more value than gold, and bought\ntheir Lord for thirty pieces of silver.\nJudas had indulged avarice until it overpowered every good trait\nof his character. He grudged the offering made to Jesus. His heart\nburned with envy that the Saviour should be the recipient of a gift\nsuitable for the monarchs of the earth. For a sum far less than the\nbox of ointment cost, he betrayed his Lord.\nThe disciples were not like Judas. They loved the Saviour. But\nthey did not rightly appreciate His exalted character. Had they\nrealized what He had done for them, they would have felt that nothing\nbestowed upon Him was wasted. The wise men from the East, who\nknew so little of Jesus, had shown a truer appreciation of the honor\ndue Him. They brought precious gifts to the Saviour, and bowed\nin homage before Him when He was but a babe, and cradled in a\nmanger.\nChrist values acts of heartfelt courtesy. When anyone did Him\na favor, with heavenly politeness He blessed the actor. He did not\nrefuse the simplest flower plucked by the hand of a child, and offered\nto Him in love. He accepted the offerings of children, and blessed the\ngivers, inscribing their names in the book of life. In the Scriptures,\nMary\u2019s anointing of Jesus is mentioned as distinguishing her from\nthe other Marys. Acts of love and reverence for Jesus are an evidence\nof faith in Him as the Son of God. And the Holy Spirit mentions,\nas evidences of woman\u2019s loyalty to Christ: \u201cIf she have washed the\nsaints\u2019 feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently\nfollowed every good work.\u201d 1 Timothy 5:10.\n488 The Desire of Ages\nChrist delighted in the earnest desire of Mary to do the will of her\nLord. He accepted the wealth of pure affection which His disciples\ndid not, would not, understand. The desire that Mary had to do this\nservice for her Lord was of more value to Christ than all the precious\nointment in the world, because it expressed her appreciation of the\nworld\u2019s Redeemer. It was the love of Christ that constrained her. The\nmatchless excellence of the character of Christ filled her soul. That\nointment was a symbol of the heart of the giver. It was the outward\ndemonstration of a love fed by heavenly streams until it overflowed.\nThe work of Mary was just the lesson the disciples needed to[565]\nshow them that the expression of their love for Him would be pleas-\ning to Christ. He had been everything to them, and they did not\nrealize that soon they would be deprived of His presence, that soon\nthey could offer Him no token of their gratitude for His great love.\nThe loneliness of Christ, separated from the heavenly courts, living\nthe life of humanity, was never understood or appreciated by the\ndisciples as it should have been. He was often grieved because His\ndisciples did not give Him that which He should have received from\nthem. He knew that if they were under the influence of the heavenly\nangels that accompanied Him, they too would think no offering of\nsufficient value to declare the heart\u2019s spiritual affection.\nTheir afterknowledge gave them a true sense of the many things\nthey might have done for Jesus expressive of the love and gratitude\nof their hearts, while they were near Him. When Jesus was no longer\nwith them, and they felt indeed as sheep without a shepherd, they\nbegan to see how they might have shown Him attentions that would\nhave brought gladness to His heart. They no longer cast blame upon\nMary, but upon themselves. Oh, if they could have taken back their\ncensuring, their presenting the poor as more worthy of the gift than\nwas Christ! They felt the reproof keenly as they took from the cross\nthe bruised body of their Lord.\nThe same want is evident in our world today. But few appreciate\nall that Christ is to them. If they did, the great love of Mary would be\nexpressed, the anointing would be freely bestowed. The expensive\nointment would not be called a waste. Nothing would be thought\ntoo costly to give for Christ, no self-denial or self-sacrifice too great\nto be endured for His sake.\nFeast at Simon\u2019s House 489\nThe words spoken in indignation, \u201cTo what purpose is this\nwaste?\u201d brought vividly before Christ the greatest sacrifice ever\nmade,\u2014the gift of Himself as the propitiation for a lost world. The\nLord would be so bountiful to His human family that it could not be\nsaid of Him that He could do more. In the gift of Jesus, God gave all\nheaven. From a human point of view, such a sacrifice was a wanton\nwaste. To human reasoning the whole plan of salvation is a waste of\nmercies and resources. Self-denial and wholehearted sacrifice meet\nus everywhere. Well may the heavenly host look with amazement\nupon the human family who refuse to be uplifted and enriched with\nthe boundless love expressed in Christ. Well may they exclaim, Why\nthis great waste?\nBut the atonement for a lost world was to be full, abundant, and\ncomplete. Christ\u2019s offering was exceedingly abundant to reach every [566]\nsoul that God had created. It could not be restricted so as not to\nexceed the number who would accept the great Gift. All men are\nnot saved; yet the plan of redemption is not a waste because it does\nnot accomplish all that its liberality has provided for. There must be\nenough and to spare.\nSimon the host had been influenced by the criticism of Judas\nupon Mary\u2019s gift, and he was surprised at the conduct of Jesus. His\nPharisaic pride was offended. He knew that many of his guests were\nlooking upon Christ with distrust and displeasure. Simon said in\nhis heart, \u201cThis Man, if He were a prophet, would have known who\nand what manner of woman this is that toucheth Him: for she is a\nsinner.\u201d\nBy curing Simon of leprosy, Christ had saved him from a liv-\ning death. But now Simon questioned whether the Saviour were\na prophet. Because Christ allowed this woman to approach Him,\nbecause He did not indignantly spurn her as one whose sins were\ntoo great to be forgiven, because He did not show that He real-\nized she had fallen, Simon was tempted to think that He was not\na prophet. Jesus knows nothing of this woman who is so free in\nher demonstrations, he thought, or He would not allow her to touch\nHim.\nBut it was Simon\u2019s ignorance of God and of Christ that led him\nto think as he did. He did not realize that God\u2019s Son must act in\nGod\u2019s way, with compassion, tenderness, and mercy. Simon\u2019s way\n490 The Desire of Ages\nwas to take no notice of Mary\u2019s penitent service. Her act of kissing\nChrist\u2019s feet and anointing them with ointment was exasperating to\nhis hardheartedness. He thought that if Christ were a prophet, He\nwould recognize sinners and rebuke them.\nTo this unspoken thought the Saviour answered: \u201cSimon, I have\nsomewhat to say unto thee.... There was a certain creditor which\nhad two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other\nfifty. And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them\nboth. Tell Me therefore, which of them will love him most? Simon\nanswered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And\nHe said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.\u201d\nAs did Nathan with David, Christ concealed His home thrust\nunder the veil of a parable. He threw upon His host the burden of\npronouncing sentence upon himself. Simon had led into sin the\nwoman he now despised. She had been deeply wronged by him.\nBy the two debtors of the parable, Simon and the woman were\nrepresented. Jesus did not design to teach that different degrees of\nobligation should be felt by the two persons, for each owed a debt[567]\nof gratitude that never could be repaid. But Simon felt himself more\nrighteous than Mary, and Jesus desired him to see how great his guilt\nreally was. He would show him that his sin was greater than hers, as\nmuch greater as a debt of five hundred pence exceeds a debt of fifty\npence.\nSimon now began to see himself in a new light. He saw how\nMary was regarded by One who was more than a prophet. He\nsaw that with keen prophetic eye Christ read her heart of love and\ndevotion. Shame seized upon him, and he realized that he was in the\npresence of One superior to himself.\n\u201cI entered into thine house,\u201d Christ continued, \u201cthou gavest Me\nno water for My feet;\u201d but with tears of repentance, prompted by\nlove, Mary hath washed My feet, and wiped them with the hair\nof her head. \u201cThou gavest Me no kiss: but this woman,\u201d whom\nyou despise, \u201csince the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss My\nfeet.\u201d Christ recounted the opportunities Simon had had to show his\nlove for his Lord, and his appreciation of what had been done for\nhim. Plainly, yet with delicate politeness, the Saviour assured His\ndisciples that His heart is grieved when His children neglect to show\ntheir gratitude to Him by words and deeds of love.\nFeast at Simon\u2019s House 491\nThe Heart Searcher read the motive that led to Mary\u2019s action,\nand He saw also the spirit that prompted Simon\u2019s words. \u201cSeest thou\nthis woman?\u201d He said to him. She is a sinner. \u201cI say unto thee, Her\nsins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom\nlittle is forgiven, the same loveth little.\u201d\nSimon\u2019s coldness and neglect toward the Saviour showed how\nlittle he appreciated the mercy he had received. He had thought he\nhonored Jesus by inviting Him to his house. But he now saw himself\nas he really was. While he thought himself reading his Guest, his\nGuest had been reading him. He saw how true Christ\u2019s judgment\nof him was. His religion had been a robe of Pharisaism. He had\ndespised the compassion of Jesus. He had not recognized Him as\nthe representative of God. While Mary was a sinner pardoned, he\nwas a sinner unpardoned. The rigid rule of justice he had desired to\nenforce against her condemned him.\nSimon was touched by the kindness of Jesus in not openly re-\nbuking him before the guests. He had not been treated as he desired\nMary to be treated. He saw that Jesus did not wish to expose his\nguilt to others, but sought by a true statement of the case to convince\nhis mind, and by pitying kindness to subdue his heart. Stern denun-\nciation would have hardened Simon against repentance, but patient\nadmonition convinced him of his error. He saw the magnitude of the [568]\ndebt which he owed his Lord. His pride was humbled, he repented,\nand the proud Pharisee became a lowly, self-sacrificing disciple.\nMary had been looked upon as a great sinner, but Christ knew the\ncircumstances that had shaped her life. He might have extinguished\nevery spark of hope in her soul, but He did not. It was He who had\nlifted her from despair and ruin. Seven times she had heard His\nrebuke of the demons that controlled her heart and mind. She had\nheard His strong cries to the Father in her behalf. She knew how\noffensive is sin to His unsullied purity, and in His strength she had\novercome.\nWhen to human eyes her case appeared hopeless, Christ saw in\nMary capabilities for good. He saw the better traits of her character.\nThe plan of redemption has invested humanity with great possibil-\nities, and in Mary these possibilities were to be realized. Through\nHis grace she became a partaker of the divine nature. The one who\nhad fallen, and whose mind had been a habitation of demons, was\n492 The Desire of Ages\nbrought very near to the Saviour in fellowship and ministry. It was\nMary who sat at His feet and learned of Him. It was Mary who\npoured upon His head the precious anointing oil, and bathed His\nfeet with her tears. Mary stood beside the cross, and followed Him\nto the sepulcher. Mary was first at the tomb after His resurrection. It\nwas Mary who first proclaimed a risen Saviour.\nJesus knows the circumstances of every soul. You may say, I\nam sinful, very sinful. You may be; but the worse you are, the more\nyou need Jesus. He turns no weeping, contrite one away. He does\nnot tell to any all that He might reveal, but He bids every trembling\nsoul take courage. Freely will He pardon all who come to Him for\nforgiveness and restoration.\nChrist might commission the angels of heaven to pour out the\nvials of His wrath on our world, to destroy those who are filled with\nhatred of God. He might wipe this dark spot from His universe. But\nHe does not do this. He is today standing at the altar of incense,\npresenting before God the prayers of those who desire His help.\nThe souls that turn to Him for refuge, Jesus lifts above the\naccusing and the strife of tongues. No man or evil angel can impeach\nthese souls. Christ unites them to His own divine-human nature.\nThey stand beside the great Sin Bearer, in the light proceeding from\nthe throne of God. \u201cWho shall lay anything to the charge of God\u2019s\nelect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is\nChrist that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the\nright hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.\u201d Romans\n8:33, 34.\nChapter 63\u2014\u201cThy King Cometh\u201d [569]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 21:1-11; Mark 11:1-10; Luke\n19:29-44; John 12:12-19.\n\u201cRejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of\nJerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: He is just, and\nhaving salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the\nfoal of an ass.\u201d Zechariah 9:9.\nFive hundred years before the birth of Christ, the prophet\nZechariah thus foretold the coming of the King to Israel. This\nprophecy is now to be fulfilled. He who has so long refused royal\nhonors now comes to Jerusalem as the promised heir to David\u2019s\nthrone.\nIt was on the first day of the week that Christ made His triumphal\nentry into Jerusalem. Multitudes who had flocked to see Him at\nBethany now accompanied Him, eager to witness His reception.\nMany people were on their way to the city to keep the Passover,\nand these joined the multitude attending Jesus. All nature seemed\nto rejoice. The trees were clothed with verdure, and their blossoms\nshed a delicate fragrance on the air. A new life and joy animated the\npeople. The hope of the new kingdom was again springing up.\nPurposing to ride into Jerusalem, Jesus had sent two of His\ndisciples to bring to Him an ass and its colt. At His birth the Saviour\nwas dependent upon the hospitality of strangers. The manger in\nwhich He lay was a borrowed resting place. Now, although the cattle\non a thousand hills are His, He is dependent on a stranger\u2019s kindness\nfor an animal on which to enter Jerusalem as its King. But again [570]\nHis divinity is revealed, even in the minute directions given His\ndisciples for this errand. As He foretold, the plea, \u201cThe Lord hath\nneed of them,\u201d was readily granted. Jesus chose for His use the colt\non which never man had sat. The disciples, with glad enthusiasm,\nspread their garments on the beast, and seated their Master upon\nit. Heretofore Jesus had always traveled on foot, and the disciples\n493\n494 The Desire of Ages\nhad at first wondered that He should now choose to ride. But hope\nbrightened in their hearts with the joyous thought that He was about\nto enter the capital, proclaim Himself King, and assert His royal\npower. While on their errand they communicated their glowing\nexpectations to the friends of Jesus, and the excitement spread far\nand near, raising the expectations of the people to the highest pitch.\nChrist was following the Jewish custom for a royal entry. The\nanimal on which He rode was that ridden by the kings of Israel, and\nprophecy had foretold that thus the Messiah should come to His\nkingdom. No sooner was He seated upon the colt than a loud shout\nof triumph rent the air. The multitude hailed Him as Messiah, their\nKing. Jesus now accepted the homage which He had never before\npermitted, and the disciples received this as proof that their glad\nhopes were to be realized by seeing Him established on the throne.\nThe multitude were convinced that the hour of their emancipation\nwas at hand. In imagination they saw the Roman armies driven from\nJerusalem, and Israel once more an independent nation. All were\nhappy and excited; the people vied with one another in paying Him\nhomage. They could not display outward pomp and splendor, but\nthey gave Him the worship of happy hearts. They were unable to\npresent Him with costly gifts, but they spread their outer garments\nas a carpet in His path, and they also strewed the leafy branches of\nthe olive and the palm in the way. They could lead the triumphal\nprocession with no royal standards, but they cut down the spreading\npalm boughs, Nature\u2019s emblem of victory, and waved them aloft\nwith loud acclamations and hosannas.\nAs they proceeded, the multitude was continually increased by\nthose who had heard of the coming of Jesus and hastened to join the\nprocession. Spectators were constantly mingling with the throng,\nand asking, Who is this? What does all this commotion signify?\nThey had all heard of Jesus, and expected Him to go to Jerusalem;\nbut they knew that He had heretofore discouraged all effort to place\nHim on the throne, and they were greatly astonished to learn that\nthis was He. They wondered what could have wrought this change\nin Him who had declared that His kingdom was not of this world.\nTheir questionings are silenced by a shout of triumph. Again[571]\nand again it is repeated by the eager throng; it is taken up by the\npeople afar off, and echoed from the surrounding hills and valleys.\n\u201cThy King Cometh\u201d 495\nAnd now the procession is joined by crowds from Jerusalem. From\nthe multitudes gathered to attend the Passover, thousands go forth to\nwelcome Jesus. They greet Him with the waving of palm branches\nand a burst of sacred song. The priests at the temple sound the\ntrumpet for evening service, but there are few to respond, and the\nrulers say to one another in alarm. \u201cThe world is gone after Him.\u201d\nNever before in His earthly life had Jesus permitted such a\ndemonstration. He clearly foresaw the result. It would bring Him to\nthe cross. But it was His purpose thus publicly to present Himself as\nthe Redeemer. He desired to call attention to the sacrifice that was\nto crown His mission to a fallen world. While the people were as-\nsembling at Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover, He, the antitypical\nLamb, by a voluntary act set Himself apart as an oblation. It would\nbe needful for His church in all succeeding ages to make His death\nfor the sins of the world a subject of deep thought and study. Every\nfact connected with it should be verified beyond a doubt. It was\nnecessary, then, that the eyes of all people should now be directed to\nHim; the events which preceded His great sacrifice must be such as\nto call attention to the sacrifice itself. After such a demonstration as\nthat attending His entry into Jerusalem, all eyes would follow His\nrapid progress to the final scene.\nThe events connected with this triumphal ride would be the talk\nof every tongue, and would bring Jesus before every mind. After\nHis crucifixion, many would recall these events in their connection\nwith His trial and death. They would be led to search the prophecies,\nand would be convinced that Jesus was the Messiah; and in all lands\nconverts to the faith would be multiplied.\nIn this one triumphant scene of His earthly life, the Saviour\nmight have appeared escorted by heavenly angels, and heralded\nby the trump of God; but such a demonstration would have been\ncontrary to the purpose of His mission, contrary to the law which\nhad governed His life. He remained true to the humble lot He had\naccepted. The burden of humanity He must bear until His life was\ngiven for the life of the world.\nThis day, which seemed to the disciples the crowning day of\ntheir lives, would have been shadowed with gloomy clouds had they\nknown that this scene of rejoicing was but a prelude to the suffering\nand death of their Master. Although He had repeatedly told them\n496 The Desire of Ages\nof His certain sacrifice, yet in the glad triumph of the present they[572]\nforgot His sorrowful words, and looked forward to His prosperous\nreign on David\u2019s throne.\nNew accessions were made continually to the procession, and,\nwith few exceptions, all who joined it caught the inspiration of the\nhour, and helped to swell the hosannas that echoed and re-echoed\nfrom hill to hill and from valley to valley. The shouts went up\ncontinually, \u201cHosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is He that\ncometh in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest.\u201d\nNever before had the world seen such a triumphal procession.\nIt was not like that of the earth\u2019s famous conquerors. No train of\nmourning captives, as trophies of kingly valor, made a feature of\nthat scene. But about the Saviour were the glorious trophies of His\nlabors of love for sinful man. There were the captives whom He\nhad rescued from Satan\u2019s power, praising God for their deliverance.\nThe blind whom He had restored to sight were leading the way. The\ndumb whose tongues He had loosed shouted the loudest hosannas.\nThe cripples whom He had healed bounded with joy, and were the\nmost active in breaking the palm branches and waving them before\nthe Saviour. Widows and orphans were exalting the name of Jesus\nfor His works of mercy to them. The lepers whom He had cleansed\nspread their untainted garments in His path, and hailed Him as the\nKing of glory. Those whom His voice had awakened from the\nsleep of death were in that throng. Lazarus, whose body had seen\ncorruption in the grave, but who now rejoiced in the strength of\nglorious manhood, led the beast on which the Saviour rode.\nMany Pharisees witnessed the scene, and, burning with envy and\nmalice, sought to turn the current of popular feeling. With all their\nauthority they tried to silence the people; but their appeals and threats\nonly increased the enthusiasm. They feared that this multitude, in\nthe strength of their numbers, would make Jesus king. As a last\nresort they pressed through the crowd to where the Saviour was,\nand accosted Him with reproving and threatening words: \u201cMaster,\nrebuke Thy disciples.\u201d They declared that such noisy demonstrations\nwere unlawful, and would not be permitted by the authorities. But\nthey were silenced by the reply of Jesus, \u201cI tell you that, if these\nshould hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.\u201d That\nscene of triumph was of God\u2019s own appointing. It had been foretold\n\u201cThy King Cometh\u201d 497\nby the prophet, and man was powerless to turn aside God\u2019s purpose.\nHad men failed to carry out His plan, He would have given a voice\nto the inanimate stones, and they would have hailed His Son with\nacclamations of praise. As the silenced Pharisees drew back, the [573]\n[574]\n[575]\nwords of Zechariah were taken up by hundreds of voices: \u201cRejoice\ngreatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold,\nthy King cometh unto thee: He is just, and having salvation; lowly,\nand riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.\u201d\nWhen the procession reached the brow of the hill, and was about\nto descend into the city, Jesus halted, and all the multitude with\nHim. Before them lay Jerusalem in its glory, now bathed in the\nlight of the declining sun. The temple attracted all eyes. In stately\ngrandeur it towered above all else, seeming to point toward heaven\nas if directing the people to the only true and living God. The temple\nhad long been the pride and glory of the Jewish nation. The Romans\nalso prided themselves in its magnificence. A king appointed by\nthe Romans had united with the Jews to rebuild and embellish it,\nand the emperor of Rome had enriched it with his gifts. Its strength,\nrichness, and magnificence had made it one of the wonders of the\nworld.\nWhile the westering sun was tinting and gilding the heavens, its\nresplendent glory lighted up the pure white marble of the temple\nwalls, and sparkled on its gold-capped pillars. From the crest of\nthe hill where Jesus and His followers stood, it had the appearance\nof a massive structure of snow, set with golden pinnacles. At the\nentrance to the temple was a vine of gold and silver, with green\nleaves and massive clusters of grapes executed by the most skillful\nartists. This design represented Israel as a prosperous vine. The gold,\nsilver, and living green were combined with rare taste and exquisite\nworkmanship; as it twined gracefully about the white and glistening\npillars, clinging with shining tendrils to their golden ornaments, it\ncaught the splendor of the setting sun, shining as if with a glory\nborrowed from heaven.\nJesus gazes upon the scene, and the vast multitude hush their\nshouts, spellbound by the sudden vision of beauty. All eyes turn upon\nthe Saviour, expecting to see in His countenance the admiration they\nthemselves feel. But instead of this they behold a cloud of sorrow.\nThey are surprised and disappointed to see His eyes fill with tears,\n498 The Desire of Ages\nand His body rock to and fro like a tree before the tempest, while\na wail of anguish bursts from His quivering lips, as if from the\ndepths of a broken heart. What a sight was this for angels to behold!\ntheir loved Commander in an agony of tears! What a sight was this\nfor the glad throng that with shouts of triumph and the waving of\npalm branches were escorting Him to the glorious city, where they\nfondly hoped He was about to reign! Jesus had wept at the grave\nof Lazarus, but it was in a godlike grief in sympathy with human[576]\nwoe. But this sudden sorrow was like a note of wailing in a grand\ntriumphal chorus. In the midst of a scene of rejoicing, where all\nwere paying Him homage, Israel\u2019s King was in tears; not silent\ntears of gladness, but tears and groans of insuppressible agony. The\nmultitude were struck with a sudden gloom. Their acclamations\nwere silenced. Many wept in sympathy with a grief they could not\ncomprehend.\nThe tears of Jesus were not in anticipation of His own suffering.\nJust before Him was Gethsemane, where soon the horror of a great\ndarkness would overshadow Him. The sheepgate also was in sight,\nthrough which for centuries the beasts for sacrificial offerings had\nbeen led. This gate was soon to open for Him, the great Antitype,\ntoward whose sacrifice for the sins of the world all these offerings\nhad pointed. Near by was Calvary, the scene of His approaching\nagony. Yet it was not because of these reminders of His cruel death\nthat the Redeemer wept and groaned in anguish of spirit. His was\nno selfish sorrow. The thought of His own agony did not intimidate\nthat noble, self-sacrificing soul. It was the sight of Jerusalem that\npierced the heart of Jesus\u2014Jerusalem that had rejected the Son\nof God and scorned His love, that refused to be convinced by His\nmighty miracles, and was about to take His life. He saw what she\nwas in her guilt of rejecting her Redeemer, and what she might have\nbeen had she accepted Him who alone could heal her wound. He\nhad come to save her; how could He give her up?\nIsrael had been a favored people; God had made their temple\nHis habitation; it was \u201cbeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth.\u201d Psalm 48:2. The record of more than a thousand years of\nChrist\u2019s guardian care and tender love, such as a father bears his only\nchild, was there. In that temple the prophets had uttered their solemn\nwarnings. There had the burning censers waved, while incense,\n\u201cThy King Cometh\u201d 499\nmingled with the prayers of the worshipers, had ascended to God.\nThere the blood of beasts had flowed, typical of the blood of Christ.\nThere Jehovah had manifested His glory above the mercy seat. There\nthe priests had officiated, and the pomp of symbol and ceremony\nhad gone on for ages. But all this must have an end.\nJesus raised His hand,\u2014that had so often blessed the sick and\nsuffering,\u2014and waving it toward the doomed city, in broken utter-\nances of grief exclaimed: \u201cIf thou hadst known, even thou, at least\nin this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace!\u2014\u201d Here the\nSaviour paused, and left unsaid what might have been the condition\nof Jerusalem had she accepted the help that God desired to give [577]\nher,\u2014the gift of His beloved Son. If Jerusalem had known what it\nwas her privilege to know, and had heeded the light which Heaven\nhad sent her, she might have stood forth in the pride of prosperity,\nthe queen of kingdoms, free in the strength of her God-given power.\nThere would have been no armed soldiers standing at her gates, no\nRoman banners waving from her walls. The glorious destiny that\nmight have blessed Jerusalem had she accepted her Redeemer rose\nbefore the Son of God. He saw that she might through Him have\nbeen healed of her grievous malady, liberated from bondage, and\nestablished as the mighty metropolis of the earth. From her walls\nthe dove of peace would have gone forth to all nations. She would\nhave been the world\u2019s diadem of glory.\nBut the bright picture of what Jerusalem might have been fades\nfrom the Saviour\u2019s sight. He realizes what she now is under the\nRoman yoke, bearing the frown of God, doomed to His retributive\njudgment. He takes up the broken thread of His lamentation: \u201cBut\nnow they are hid from thine eyes. For the days shall come upon thee,\nthat thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee\nround, and keep thee in on every side, and shall lay thee even with\nthe ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in\nthee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of\nthy visitation.\u201d\nChrist came to save Jerusalem with her children; but Pharisaical\npride, hypocrisy, jealousy, and malice had prevented Him from ac-\ncomplishing His purpose. Jesus knew the terrible retribution which\nwould be visited upon the doomed city. He saw Jerusalem encom-\npassed with armies, the besieged inhabitants driven to starvation and\n500 The Desire of Ages\ndeath, mothers feeding upon the dead bodies of their own children,\nand both parents and children snatching the last morsel of food from\none another, natural affection being destroyed by the gnawing pangs\nof hunger. He saw that the stubbornness of the Jews, as evinced\nin their rejection of His salvation, would also lead them to refuse\nsubmission to the invading armies. He beheld Calvary, on which He\nwas to be lifted up, set with crosses as thickly as forest trees. He\nsaw the wretched inhabitants suffering torture on the rack and by\ncrucifixion, the beautiful palaces destroyed, the temple in ruins, and\nof its massive walls not one stone left upon another, while the city\nwas plowed like a field. Well might the Saviour weep in agony in\nview of that fearful scene.\nJerusalem had been the child of His care, and as a tender father\nmourns over a wayward son, so Jesus wept over the beloved city.\nHow can I give thee up? How can I see thee devoted to destruc-[578]\ntion? Must I let thee go to fill up the cup of thine iniquity? One\nsoul is of such value that, in comparison with it, worlds sink into\ninsignificance; but here was a whole nation to be lost. When the fast\nwestering sun should pass from sight in the heavens, Jerusalem\u2019s day\nof grace would be ended. While the procession was halting on the\nbrow of Olivet, it was not yet too late for Jerusalem to repent. The\nangel of mercy was then folding her wings to step down from the\ngolden throne to give place to justice and swift-coming judgment.\nBut Christ\u2019s great heart of love still pleaded for Jerusalem, that had\nscorned His mercies, despised His warnings, and was about to im-\nbrue her hands in His blood. If Jerusalem would but repent, it was\nnot yet too late. While the last rays of the setting sun were lingering\non temple, tower, and pinnacle, would not some good angel lead her\nto the Saviour\u2019s love, and avert her doom? Beautiful and unholy city,\nthat had stoned the prophets, that had rejected the Son of God, that\nwas locking herself by her impenitence in fetters of bondage,\u2014her\nday of mercy was almost spent!\nYet again the Spirit of God speaks to Jerusalem. Before the day\nis done, another testimony is borne to Christ. The voice of witness is\nlifted up, responding to the call from a prophetic past. If Jerusalem\nwill hear the call, if she will receive the Saviour who is entering her\ngates, she may yet be saved.\n\u201cThy King Cometh\u201d 501\nReports have reached the rulers in Jerusalem that Jesus is ap-\nproaching the city with a great concourse of people. But they have\nno welcome for the Son of God. In fear they go out to meet Him,\nhoping to disperse the throng. As the procession is about to descend\nthe Mount of Olives, it is intercepted by the rulers. They inquire\nthe cause of the tumultuous rejoicing. As they question, \u201cWho is\nthis?\u201d the disciples, filled with the spirit of inspiration, answer this\nquestion. In eloquent strains they repeat the prophecies concerning\nChrist:\nAdam will tell you, It is the seed of the woman that shall bruise\nthe serpent\u2019s head.\nAsk Abraham, he will tell you, It is \u201cMelchizedek King of\nSalem,\u201d King of Peace. Genesis 14:18.\nJacob will tell you, He is Shiloh of the tribe of Judah.\nIsaiah will tell you, \u201cImmanuel,\u201d \u201cWonderful, Counselor, The\nmighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.\u201d Isaiah\n7:14; 9:6.\nJeremiah will tell you, The Branch of David, \u201cthe Lord our\nRighteousness.\u201d Jeremiah 23:6.\nDaniel will tell you, He is the Messiah. [579]\nHosea will tell you, He is \u201cthe Lord God of hosts; the Lord is\nHis memorial.\u201d Hosea 12:5.\nJohn the Baptist will tell you, He is \u201cthe Lamb of God, which\ntaketh away the sin of the world.\u201d John 1:29.\nThe great Jehovah has proclaimed from His throne, \u201cThis is My\nbeloved Son.\u201d Matthew 3:17.\nWe, His disciples, declare, This is Jesus, the Messiah, the Prince\nof life, the Redeemer of the world.\nAnd the prince of the powers of darkness acknowledges Him,\nsaying, \u201cI know Thee who Thou art, the Holy One of God.\u201d Mark\n1:24.\nChapter 64\u2014A Doomed People[580]\nThis chapter is based on Mark 11:11-14, 20, 21; Matthew 21:17-19.\nThe triumphal ride of Christ into Jerusalem was the dim fore-\nshadowing of His coming in the clouds of heaven with power and\nglory, amid the triumph of angels and the rejoicing of the saints.\nThen will be fulfilled the words of Christ to the priests and Pharisees:\n\u201cYe shall not see Me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is He that\ncometh in the name of the Lord.\u201d Matthew 23:39. In prophetic vi-\nsion Zechariah was shown that day of final triumph; and he beheld\nalso the doom of those who at the first advent had rejected Christ:\n\u201cThey shall look upon Me whom they have pierced, and they shall\nmourn for Him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in\nbitterness for Him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born.\u201d\nZechariah 12:10. This scene Christ foresaw when He beheld the city\nand wept over it. In the temporal ruin of Jerusalem He saw the final\ndestruction of that people who were guilty of the blood of the Son\nof God.\nThe disciples saw the hatred of the Jews to Christ, but they did\nnot yet see to what it would lead. They did not yet understand the\ntrue condition of Israel, nor comprehend the retribution that was to\nfall upon Jerusalem. This Christ opened to them by a significant\nobject lesson.\nThe last appeal to Jerusalem had been in vain. The priests and\nrulers had heard the prophetic voice of the past echoed by the mul-\ntitude, in answer to the question, \u201cWho is this?\u201d but they did not\naccept it as the voice of Inspiration. In anger and amazement they[581]\ntried to silence the people. There were Roman officers in the throng,\nand to them His enemies denounced Jesus as the leader of a rebel-\nlion. They represented that He was about to take possession of the\ntemple, and reign as king in Jerusalem.\nBut the calm voice of Jesus hushed for a moment the clamorous\nthrong as He again declared that He had not come to establish a\n502\nDoomed People 503\ntemporal rule; He should soon ascend to His Father, and His accusers\nwould see Him no more until He should come again in glory. Then,\ntoo late for their salvation, they would acknowledge Him. These\nwords Jesus spoke with sadness and with singular power. The Roman\nofficers were silenced and subdued. Their hearts, though strangers to\ndivine influence, were moved as they had never been moved before.\nIn the calm, solemn face of Jesus they read love, benevolence, and\nquiet dignity. They were stirred by a sympathy they could not\nunderstand. Instead of arresting Jesus, they were more inclined to\npay Him homage. Turning upon the priests and rulers, they charged\nthem with creating the disturbance. These leaders, chagrined and\ndefeated, turned to the people with their complaints, and disputed\nangrily among themselves.\nMeanwhile Jesus passed unnoticed to the temple. All was quiet\nthere, for the scene upon Olivet had called away the people. For\na short time Jesus remained at the temple, looking upon it with\nsorrowful eyes. Then He withdrew with His disciples, and returned\nto Bethany. When the people sought for Him to place Him on the\nthrone, He was not to be found.\nThe entire night Jesus spent in prayer, and in the morning He\ncame again to the temple. On the way He passed a fig orchard. He\nwas hungry, \u201cand seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, He came,\nif haply He might find anything thereon: and when He came to it,\nHe found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.\u201d\nIt was not the season for ripe figs, except in certain localities;\nand on the highlands about Jerusalem it might truly be said, \u201cThe\ntime of figs was not yet.\u201d But in the orchard to which Jesus came,\none tree appeared to be in advance of all the others. It was already\ncovered with leaves. It is the nature of the fig tree that before the\nleaves open, the growing fruit appears. Therefore this tree in full\nleaf gave promise of well-developed fruit. But its appearance was\ndeceptive. Upon searching its branches, from the lowest bough to\nthe topmost twig, Jesus found \u201cnothing but leaves.\u201d It was a mass of\npretentious foliage, nothing more.\nChrist uttered against it a withering curse. \u201cNo man eat fruit of [582]\nthee hereafter forever,\u201d He said. The next morning, as the Saviour\nand His disciples were again on their way to the city, the blasted\nbranches and drooping leaves attracted their attention. \u201cMaster,\u201d\n504 The Desire of Ages\nsaid Peter, \u201cbehold, the fig tree which Thou cursedst is withered\naway.\u201d\nChrist\u2019s act in cursing the fig tree had astonished the disciples. It\nseemed to them unlike His ways and works. Often they had heard\nHim declare that He came not to condemn the world, but that the\nworld through Him might be saved. They remembered His words,\n\u201cThe Son of man is not come to destroy men\u2019s lives, but to save\nthem.\u201d Luke 9:56. His wonderful works had been done to restore,\nnever to destroy. The disciples had known Him only as the Restorer,\nthe Healer. This act stood alone. What was its purpose? they\nquestioned.\nGod \u201cdelighteth in mercy.\u201d \u201cAs I live, saith the Lord God, I have\nno pleasure in the death of the wicked.\u201d Micah 7:18; Ezekiel 33:11.\nTo Him the work of destruction and the denunciation of judgment\nis a \u201cstrange work.\u201d Isaiah 28:21. But it is in mercy and love that\nHe lifts the veil from the future, and reveals to men the results of a\ncourse of sin.\nThe cursing of the fig tree was an acted parable. That barren\ntree, flaunting its pretentious foliage in the very face of Christ, was\na symbol of the Jewish nation. The Saviour desired to make plain\nto His disciples the cause and the certainty of Israel\u2019s doom. For\nthis purpose He invested the tree with moral qualities, and made it\nthe expositor of divine truth. The Jews stood forth distinct from all\nother nations, professing allegiance to God. They had been specially[583]\nfavored by Him, and they laid claim to righteousness above every\nother people. But they were corrupted by the love of the world and\nthe greed of gain. They boasted of their knowledge, but they were\nignorant of the requirements of God, and were full of hypocrisy. Like\nthe barren tree, they spread their pretentious branches aloft, luxuriant\nin appearance, and beautiful to the eye, but they yielded \u201cnothing but\nleaves.\u201d The Jewish religion, with its magnificent temple, its sacred\naltars, its mitered priests and impressive ceremonies, was indeed fair\nin outward appearance, but humility, love, and benevolence were\nlacking.\nAll the trees in the fig orchard were destitute of fruit; but the\nleafless trees raised no expectation, and caused no disappointment.\nBy these trees the Gentiles were represented. They were as destitute\nas were the Jews of godliness; but they had not professed to serve\nDoomed People 505\nGod. They made no boastful pretensions to goodness. They were\nblind to the works and ways of God. With them the time of figs\nwas not yet. They were still waiting for a day which would bring\nthem light and hope. The Jews, who had received greater blessings\nfrom God, were held accountable for their abuse of these gifts. The\nprivileges of which they boasted only increased their guilt.\nJesus had come to the fig tree hungry, to find food. So He had\ncome to Israel, hungering to find in them the fruits of righteousness.\nHe had lavished on them His gifts, that they might bear fruit for\nthe blessing of the world. Every opportunity and privilege had\nbeen granted them, and in return He sought their sympathy and\nco-operation in His work of grace. He longed to see in them self-\nsacrifice and compassion, zeal for God, and a deep yearning of soul\nfor the salvation of their fellow men. Had they kept the law of God,\nthey would have done the same unselfish work that Christ did. But\nlove to God and man was eclipsed by pride and self-sufficiency. They\nbrought ruin upon themselves by refusing to minister to others. The\ntreasures of truth which God had committed to them, they did not\ngive to the world. In the barren tree they might read both their sin and\nits punishment. Withered beneath the Saviour\u2019s curse, standing forth\nsere and blasted, dried up by the roots, the fig tree showed what the\nJewish people would be when the grace of God was removed from\nthem. Refusing to impart blessing, they would no longer receive it.\n\u201cO Israel,\u201d the Lord says, \u201cthou hast destroyed thyself.\u201d Hosea 13:9.\nThe warning is for all time. Christ\u2019s act in cursing the tree which [584]\nHis own power had created stands as a warning to all churches and\nto all Christians. No one can live the law of God without ministering\nto others. But there are many who do not live out Christ\u2019s merciful,\nunselfish life. Some who think themselves excellent Christians do\nnot understand what constitutes service for God. They plan and\nstudy to please themselves. They act only in reference to self. Time\nis of value to them only as they can gather for themselves. In all the\naffairs of life this is their object. Not for others but for themselves do\nthey minister. God created them to live in a world where unselfish\nservice must be performed. He designed them to help their fellow\nmen in every possible way. But self is so large that they cannot see\nanything else. They are not in touch with humanity. Those who thus\nlive for self are like the fig tree, which made every pretension but was\n506 The Desire of Ages\nfruitless. They observe the forms of worship, but without repentance\nor faith. In profession they honor the law of God, but obedience\nis lacking. They say, but do not. In the sentence pronounced on\nthe fig tree Christ demonstrates how hateful in His eyes is this vain\npretense. He declares that the open sinner is less guilty than is he\nwho professes to serve God, but who bears no fruit to His glory.\nThe parable of the fig tree, spoken before Christ\u2019s visit to\nJerusalem, had a direct connection with the lesson He taught in\ncursing the fruitless tree. For the barren tree of the parable the\ngardener pleaded, Let it alone this year, until I shall dig about it\nand dress it; and if it bear fruit, well; but if not, then after that thou\nshalt cut it down. Increased care was to be given the unfruitful tree.\nIt was to have every advantage. But if it remained fruitless, noth-\ning could save it from destruction. In the parable the result of the\ngardener\u2019s work was not foretold. It depended upon that people to\nwhom Christ\u2019s words were spoken. They were represented by the\nfruitless tree, and it rested with them to decide their own destiny.\nEvery advantage that Heaven could bestow was given them, but they\ndid not profit by their increased blessings. By Christ\u2019s act in cursing\nthe barren fig tree, the result was shown. They had determined their\nown destruction.\nFor more than a thousand years the Jewish nation had abused\nGod\u2019s mercy and invited His judgments. They had rejected His\nwarnings and slain His prophets. For these sins the people of Christ\u2019s\nday made themselves responsible by following the same course. In\nthe rejection of their present mercies and warnings lay the guilt of[585]\n[586]\n[587]\nthat generation. The fetters which the nation had for centuries been\nforging, the people of Christ\u2019s day were fastening upon themselves.\nIn every age there is given to men their day of light and privilege,\na probationary time in which they may become reconciled to God.\nBut there is a limit to this grace. Mercy may plead for years and be\nslighted and rejected; but there comes a time when mercy makes her\nlast plea. The heart becomes so hardened that it ceases to respond to\nthe Spirit of God. Then the sweet, winning voice entreats the sinner\nno longer, and reproofs and warnings cease.\nThat day had come to Jerusalem. Jesus wept in anguish over\nthe doomed city, but He could not deliver her. He had exhausted\nevery resource. In rejecting the warnings of God\u2019s Spirit, Israel had\nDoomed People 507\nrejected the only means of help. There was no other power by which\nthey could be delivered.\nThe Jewish nation was a symbol of the people of all ages who\nscorn the pleadings of Infinite Love. The tears of Christ when He\nwept over Jerusalem were for the sins of all time. In the judgments\npronounced upon Israel, those who reject the reproofs and warnings\nof God\u2019s Holy Spirit, may read their own condemnation.\nIn this generation there are many who are treading on the same\nground as were the unbelieving Jews. They have witnessed the\nmanifestation of the power of God; the Holy Spirit has spoken to\ntheir hearts; but they cling to their unbelief and resistance. God\nsends them warnings and reproof, but they are not willing to confess\ntheir errors, and they reject His message and His messenger. The\nvery means He uses for their recovery becomes to them a stone of\nstumbling.\nThe prophets of God were hated by apostate Israel because\nthrough them their hidden sins were brought to light. Ahab regarded\nElijah as his enemy because the prophet was faithful to rebuke the\nking\u2019s secret iniquities. So today the servant of Christ, the reprover\nof sin, meets with scorn and rebuffs. Bible truth, the religion of\nChrist, struggles against a strong current of moral impurity. Preju-\ndice is even stronger in the hearts of men now than in Christ\u2019s day.\nChrist did not fulfill men\u2019s expectations; His life was a rebuke to\ntheir sins, and they rejected Him. So now the truth of God\u2019s word\ndoes not harmonize with men\u2019s practices and their natural inclina-\ntion, and thousands reject its light. Men prompted by Satan cast\ndoubt upon God\u2019s word, and choose to exercise their independent [588]\njudgment. They choose darkness rather than light, but they do it at\nthe peril of their souls. Those who caviled at the words of Christ,\nfound ever-increased cause for cavil, until they turned from the Truth\nand the Life. So it is now. God does not propose to remove every\nobjection which the carnal heart may bring against His truth. To\nthose who refuse the precious rays of light which would illuminate\nthe darkness, the mysteries of God\u2019s word remain such forever. From\nthem the truth is hidden. They walk blindly, and know not the ruin\nbefore them.\nChrist overlooked the world and all ages from the height of\nOlivet; and His words are applicable to every soul who slights\n508 The Desire of Ages\nthe pleadings of divine mercy. Scorner of His love, He addresses\nyou today. It is \u201cthou, even thou,\u201d who shouldest know the things\nthat belong to thy peace. Christ is shedding bitter tears for you,\nwho have no tears to shed for yourself. Already that fatal hardness\nof heart which destroyed the Pharisees is manifest in you. And\nevery evidence of the grace of God, every ray of divine light, is\neither melting and subduing the soul, or confirming it in hopeless\nimpenitence.\nChrist foresaw that Jerusalem would remain obdurate and im-\npenitent; yet all the guilt, all the consequences of rejected mercy, lay\nat her own door. Thus it will be with every soul who is following\nthe same course. The Lord declares, \u201cO Israel, thou hast destroyed\nthyself.\u201d \u201cHear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people,\neven the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened\nunto My words, nor to My law, but rejected it.\u201d Hosea 13:9; Jeremiah\n6:19.\nChapter 65\u2014The Temple Cleansed Again [589]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 21:12-16, 23-46; Mark 11:15-19,\n27-33; Mark 12:1-12; Luke 19:45-48; Luke 20:1-19.\nAt the beginning of His ministry, Christ had driven from the\ntemple those who defiled it by their unholy traffic; and His stern and\ngodlike demeanor had struck terror to the hearts of the scheming\ntraders. At the close of His mission He came again to the temple,\nand found it still desecrated as before. The condition of things was\neven worse than before. The outer court of the temple was like a vast\ncattle yard. With the cries of the animals and the sharp chinking of\ncoin was mingled the sound of angry altercation between traffickers,\nand among them were heard the voices of men in sacred office.\nThe dignitaries of the temple were themselves engaged in buying\nand selling and the exchange of money. So completely were they\ncontrolled by their greed of gain that in the sight of God they were\nno better than thieves.\nLittle did the priests and rulers realize the solemnity of the work\nwhich it was theirs to perform. At every Passover and Feast of\nTabernacles, thousands of animals were slain, and their blood was\ncaught by the priests and poured upon the altar. The Jews had\nbecome familiar with the offering of blood, and had almost lost sight\nof the fact that it was sin which made necessary all this shedding of\nthe blood of beasts. They did not discern that it prefigured the blood\nof God\u2019s dear Son, which was to be shed for the life of the world, [590]\nand that by the offering of sacrifices men were to be directed to a\ncrucified Redeemer.\nJesus looked upon the innocent victims of sacrifice, and saw how\nthe Jews had made these great convocations scenes of bloodshed and\ncruelty. In place of humble repentance of sin, they had multiplied\nthe sacrifice of beasts, as if God could be honored by a heartless\nservice. The priests and rulers had hardened their hearts through\nselfishness and avarice. The very symbols pointing to the Lamb of\n509\n510 The Desire of Ages\nGod they had made a means of getting gain. Thus in the eyes of the\npeople the sacredness of the sacrificial service had been in a great\nmeasure destroyed. The indignation of Jesus was stirred; He knew\nthat His blood, so soon to be shed for the sins of the world, would\nbe as little appreciated by the priests and elders as was the blood of\nbeasts which they kept incessantly flowing.\nAgainst these practices Christ had spoken through the prophets.\nSamuel had said, \u201cHath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings\nand sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey\nis better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.\u201d And\nIsaiah, seeing in prophetic vision the apostasy of the Jews, addressed\nthem as rulers of Sodom and Gomorrah: \u201cHear the word of the Lord,\nye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people\nof Gomorrah. To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices\nunto Me? saith the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams,\nand the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks,\nor of lambs, or of he-goats. When ye come to appear before Me,\nwho hath required this at your hand, to tread My courts?\u201d \u201cWash\nyou, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before\nMine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve\nthe oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.\u201d 1 Samuel\n15:22; Isaiah 1:10-12, 16, 17.\nHe who had Himself given these prophecies now for the last\ntime repeated the warning. In fulfillment of prophecy the people\nhad proclaimed Jesus king of Israel. He had received their homage,\nand accepted the office of king. In this character He must act. He\nknew that His efforts to reform a corrupt priesthood would be in\nvain; nevertheless His work must be done; to an unbelieving people\nthe evidence of His divine mission must be given.\nAgain the piercing look of Jesus swept over the desecrated court\nof the temple. All eyes were turned toward Him. Priest and ruler,\nPharisee and Gentile, looked with astonishment and awe upon Him[591]\nwho stood before them with the majesty of heaven\u2019s King. Divinity\nflashed through humanity, investing Christ with a dignity and glory\nHe had never manifested before. Those standing nearest Him drew\nas far away as the crowd would permit. Except for a few of His\ndisciples, the Saviour stood alone. Every sound was hushed. The\ndeep silence seemed unbearable. Christ spoke with a power that\nTemple Cleansed Again 511\nswayed the people like a mighty tempest: \u201cIt is written, My house\nshall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of\nthieves.\u201d His voice sounded like a trumpet through the temple. The\ndispleasure of His countenance seemed like consuming fire. With\nauthority He commanded, \u201cTake these things hence.\u201d John 2:16.\nThree years before, the rulers of the temple had been ashamed of\ntheir flight before the command of Jesus. They had since wondered at\ntheir own fears, and their unquestioning obedience to a single humble\nMan. They had felt that it was impossible for their undignified [592]\nsurrender to be repeated. Yet they were now more terrified than\nbefore, and in greater haste to obey His command. There were none\nwho dared question His authority. Priests and traders fled from His\npresence, driving their cattle before them.\nOn the way from the temple they were met by a throng who\ncame with their sick inquiring for the Great Healer. The report given\nby the fleeing people caused some of these to turn back. They feared\nto meet One so powerful, whose very look had driven the priests and\nrulers from His presence. But a large number pressed through the\nhurrying crowd, eager to reach Him who was their only hope. When\nthe multitude fled from the temple, many had remained behind.\nThese were now joined by the newcomers. Again the temple court\nwas filled by the sick and the dying, and once more Jesus ministered\nto them.\nAfter a season the priests and rulers ventured back to the temple.\nWhen the panic had abated, they were seized with anxiety to know\nwhat would be the next movement of Jesus. They expected Him\nto take the throne of David. Quietly returning to the temple, they\nheard the voices of men, women, and children praising God. Upon\nentering, they stood transfixed before the wonderful scene. They\nsaw the sick healed, the blind restored to sight, and deaf receive their\nhearing, and the crippled leap for joy. The children were foremost in\nthe rejoicing. Jesus had healed their maladies; He had clasped them\nin His arms, received their kisses of grateful affection, and some\nof them had fallen asleep upon His breast as He was teaching the\npeople. Now with glad voices the children sounded His praise. They\nrepeated the hosannas of the day before, and waved palm branches\ntriumphantly before the Saviour. The temple echoed and re-echoed\nwith their acclamations, \u201cBlessed be He that cometh in the name\n512 The Desire of Ages\nof the Lord!\u201d \u201cBehold, thy King cometh unto thee; He is just, and\nhaving salvation!\u201d Psalm 118:26; Zechariah 9:9. \u201cHosanna to the\nSon of David!\u201d\nThe sound of these happy, unrestrained voices was an offense\nto the rulers of the temple. They set about putting a stop to such\ndemonstrations. They represented to the people that the house of\nGod was desecrated by the feet of the children and the shouts of\nrejoicing. Finding that their words made no impression on the\npeople, the rulers appealed to Christ: \u201cHearest Thou what these\nsay? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the\nmouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise?\u201d Prophecy[593]\nhad foretold that Christ should be proclaimed as king, and that word\nmust be fulfilled. The priests and rulers of Israel refused to herald\nHis glory, and God moved upon the children to be His witnesses.\nHad the voices of the children been silent, the very pillars of the\ntemple would have sounded the Saviour\u2019s praise.\nThe Pharisees were utterly perplexed and disconcerted. One\nwhom they could not intimidate was in command. Jesus had taken\nHis position as guardian of the temple. Never before had He as-\nsumed such kingly authority. Never before had His words and works\npossessed so great power. He had done marvelous works throughout\nJerusalem, but never before in a manner so solemn and impres-\nsive. In presence of the people who had witnessed His wonderful\nworks, the priests and rulers dared not show Him open hostility.\nThough enraged and confounded by His answer, they were unable\nto accomplish anything further that day.\nThe next morning the Sanhedrin again considered what course\nto pursue toward Jesus. Three years before, they had demanded a\nsign of His Messiahship. Since that time He had wrought mighty\nworks throughout the land. He had healed the sick, miraculously\nfed thousands of people, walked upon the waves, and spoken peace\nto the troubled sea. He had repeatedly read the hearts of men as\nan open book; He had cast out demons, and raised the dead. The\nrulers had before them the evidences of His Messiahship. They now\ndecided to demand no sign of His authority, but to draw out some\nadmission or declaration by which He might be condemned.\nRepairing to the temple where He was teaching, they proceeded\nto question Him: \u201cBy what authority doest Thou these things? and\nTemple Cleansed Again 513\nwho gave Thee this authority?\u201d They expected Him to claim that\nHis authority was from God. Such an assertion they intended to\ndeny. But Jesus met them with a question apparently pertaining to\nanother subject, and He made His reply to them conditional on their\nanswering this question. \u201cThe baptism of John,\u201d He said, \u201cwhence\nwas it? from heaven, or of men?\u201d\nThe priests saw that they were in a dilemma from which no\nsophistry could extricate them. If they said that John\u2019s baptism was\nfrom heaven, their inconsistency would be made apparent. Christ\nwould say, Why have ye not then believed on him? John had testified\nof Christ, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of [594]\nthe world.\u201d John 1:29. If the priests believed John\u2019s testimony, how\ncould they deny the Messiahship of Christ? If they declared their\nreal belief, that John\u2019s ministry was of men, they would bring upon\nthemselves a storm of indignation; for the people believed John to\nbe a prophet.\nWith intense interest the multitude awaited the decision. They\nknew that the priests had professed to accept the ministry of John,\nand they expected them to acknowledge without a question that\nhe was sent from God. But after conferring secretly together, the\npriests decided not to commit themselves. Hypocritically professing\nignorance, they said, \u201cWe cannot tell.\u201d \u201cNeither tell I you,\u201d said\nChrist, \u201cby what authority I do these things.\u201d\nScribes, priests, and rulers were all silenced. Baffled and disap-\npointed, they stood with lowering brows, not daring to press further\nquestions upon Christ. By their cowardice and indecision they had\nin a great measure forfeited the respect of the people, who now stood\nby, amused to see these proud, self-righteous men defeated.\nAll these sayings and doings of Christ were important, and their\ninfluence was to be felt in an ever-increasing degree after His cru-\ncifixion and ascension. Many of those who had anxiously awaited\nthe result of the questioning of Jesus were finally to become His\ndisciples, first drawn toward Him by His words on that eventful\nday. The scene in the temple court was never to fade from their\nminds. The contrast between Jesus and the high priest as they talked\ntogether was marked. The proud dignitary of the temple was clothed\nin rich and costly garments. Upon his head was a glittering tiara.\nHis bearing was majestic, his hair and his long flowing beard were\n514 The Desire of Ages\nsilvered by age. His appearance awed the beholders. Before this\naugust personage stood the Majesty of heaven, without adornment\nor display. His garments were travel stained; His face was pale,\nand expressed a patient sadness; yet written there were dignity and\nbenevolence that contrasted strangely with the proud, self-confident,\nand angry air of the high priest. Many of those who witnessed the\nwords and deeds of Jesus in the temple from that time enshrined\nHim in their hearts as a prophet of God. But as the popular feeling\nturned in His favor, the hatred of the priests toward Jesus increased.\nThe wisdom by which He escaped the snares set for His feet, being\na new evidence of His divinity, added fuel to their wrath.\nIn His contest with the rabbis, it was not Christ\u2019s purpose to\nhumiliate His opponents. He was not glad to see them in a hard\nplace. He had an important lesson to teach. He had mortified His[595]\nenemies by allowing them to be entangled in the net they had spread\nfor Him. Their acknowledged ignorance in regard to the character of\nJohn\u2019s baptism gave Him an opportunity to speak, and He improved\nthe opportunity by presenting before them their real position, adding\nanother warning to the many already given.\n\u201cWhat think ye?\u201d He said. \u201cA certain man had two sons; and he\ncame to the first, and said, Son, go work today in my vineyard. He\nanswered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.\nAnd he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and\nsaid, I go, sir: and went not. Whether of them twain did the will of\nhis father?\u201d\nThis abrupt question threw His hearers off their guard. They had\nfollowed the parable closely, and now immediately answered, \u201cThe\nfirst.\u201d Fixing His steady eye upon them, Jesus responded in stern\nand solemn tones: \u201cVerily I say unto you, That the publicans and the\nharlots go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came unto\nyou in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the\npublicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it,\nrepented not afterward, that ye might believe him.\u201d\nThe priests and rulers could not but give a correct answer to\nChrist\u2019s question, and thus He obtained their opinion in favor of\nthe first son. This son represented the publicans, those who were\ndespised and hated by the Pharisees. The publicans had been grossly\nimmoral. They had indeed been transgressors of the law of God,\nTemple Cleansed Again 515\nshowing in their lives an absolute resistance to His requirements.\nThey had been unthankful and unholy; when told to go and work\nin the Lord\u2019s vineyard, they had given a contemptuous refusal. But\nwhen John came, preaching repentance and baptism, the publicans\nreceived his message and were baptized.\nThe second son represented the leading men of the Jewish nation.\nSome of the Pharisees had repented and received the baptism of John;\nbut the leaders would not acknowledge that he came from God. His\nwarnings and denunciations did not lead them to reformation. They\n\u201crejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized\nof him.\u201d Luke 7:30. They treated his message with disdain. Like\nthe second son, who, when called, said, \u201cI go, sir,\u201d but went not,\nthe priests and rulers professed obedience, but acted disobedience.\nThey made great professions of piety, they claimed to be obeying\nthe law of God, but they rendered only a false obedience. The\npublicans were denounced and cursed by the Pharisees as infidels;\nbut they showed by their faith and works that they were going into [596]\nthe kingdom of heaven before those self-righteous men who had\nbeen given great light, but whose works did not correspond to their\nprofession of godliness.\nThe priests and rulers were unwilling to bear these searching\ntruths; they remained silent, however, hoping that Jesus would say\nsomething which they could turn against Him; but they had still\nmore to bear.\n\u201cHear another parable,\u201d Christ said: \u201cThere was a certain house-\nholder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and\ndigged a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to hus-\nbandmen, and went into a far country: and when the time of the\nfruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they\nmight receive the fruits of it. And the husbandmen took his servants,\nand beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. Again, he sent\nother servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.\nBut last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence\nmy son. But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among\nthemselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize\non his inheritance. And they caught him, and cast him out of the\nvineyard, and slew him. When the lord therefore of the vineyard\ncometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?\u201d\n516 The Desire of Ages\nJesus addressed all the people present; but the priests and rulers\nanswered. \u201cHe will miserably destroy those wicked men,\u201d they\nsaid, \u201cand will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which\nshall render him the fruits in their seasons.\u201d The speakers had not\nat first perceived the application of the parable, but they now saw\nthat they had pronounced their own condemnation. In the parable\nthe householder represented God, the vineyard the Jewish nation,\nand the hedge the divine law which was their protection. The tower\nwas a symbol of the temple. The lord of the vineyard had done\neverything needful for its prosperity. \u201cWhat could have been done\nmore to my vineyard,\u201d he says, \u201cthat I have not done in it?\u201d Isaiah\n5:4. Thus was represented God\u2019s unwearied care for Israel. And\nas the husbandmen were to return to the lord a due proportion of\nthe fruits of the vineyard, so God\u2019s people were to honor Him by a\nlife corresponding to their sacred privileges. But as the husbandmen\nhad killed the servants whom the master sent to them for fruit, so\nthe Jews had put to death the prophets whom God sent to call them\nto repentance. Messenger after messenger had been slain. Thus far\nthe application of the parable could not be questioned, and in what\nfollowed it was not less evident. In the beloved son whom the lord\nof the vineyard finally sent to his disobedient servants, and whom\nthey seized and slew, the priests and rulers saw a distinct picture[597]\nof Jesus and His impending fate. Already they were planning to\nslay Him whom the Father had sent to them as a last appeal. In the\nretribution inflicted upon the ungrateful husbandmen was portrayed\nthe doom of those who should put Christ to death.\nLooking with pity upon them, the Saviour continued, \u201cDid ye\nnever read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected,\nthe same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord\u2019s doing,\nand it is marvelous in our eyes? Therefore say I unto you, The\nkingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation\nbringing forth the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this\nstone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind\nhim to powder.\u201d\nThis prophecy the Jews had often repeated in the synagogues,\napplying it to the coming Messiah. Christ was the cornerstone of the\nJewish economy, and of the whole plan of salvation. This foundation\nstone the Jewish builders, the priests and rulers of Israel, were now\nTemple Cleansed Again 517\nrejecting. The Saviour called their attention to the prophecies that\nwould show them their danger. By every means in His power He\nsought to make plain to them the nature of the deed they were about\nto do.\nAnd His words had another purpose. In asking the question,\n\u201cWhen the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do\nunto those husbandmen?\u201d Christ designed that the Pharisees should\nanswer as they did. He designed that they should condemn them-\nselves. His warnings, failing to arouse them to repentance, would\nseal their doom, and He wished them to see that they had brought\nruin on themselves. He designed to show them the justice of God in\nthe withdrawal of their national privileges, which had already begun,\nand which would end, not only in the destruction of their temple and\ntheir city, but in the dispersion of the nation.\nThe hearers recognized the warning. But notwithstanding the\nsentence they themselves had pronounced, the priests and rulers\nwere ready to fill out the picture by saying, \u201cThis is the heir; come,\nlet us kill him.\u201d \u201cBut when they sought to lay hands on Him, they\nfeared the multitude,\u201d for the public sentiment was in Christ\u2019s favor.\nIn quoting the prophecy of the rejected stone, Christ referred\nto an actual occurrence in the history of Israel. The incident was\nconnected with the building of the first temple. While it had a\nspecial application at the time of Christ\u2019s first advent, and should\nhave appealed with special force to the Jews, it has also a lesson for\nus. When the temple of Solomon was erected, the immense stones [598]\nfor the walls and the foundation were entirely prepared at the quarry;\nafter they were brought to the place of building, not an instrument\nwas to be used upon them; the workmen had only to place them in\nposition. For use in the foundation, one stone of unusual size and\npeculiar shape had been brought; but the workmen could find no\nplace for it, and would not accept it. It was an annoyance to them as\nit lay unused in their way. Long it remained a rejected stone. But\nwhen the builders came to the laying of the corner, they searched\nfor a long time to find a stone of sufficient size and strength, and\nof the proper shape, to take that particular place, and bear the great\nweight which would rest upon it. Should they make an unwise choice\nfor this important place, the safety of the entire building would be\nendangered. They must find a stone capable of resisting the influence\n518 The Desire of Ages\nof the sun, of frost, and of tempest. Several stones had at different\ntimes been chosen, but under the pressure of immense weights they\nhad crumbled to pieces. Others could not bear the test of the sudden\natmospheric changes. But at last attention was called to the stone\nso long rejected. It had been exposed to the air, to sun and storm,\nwithout revealing the slightest crack. The builders examined this\nstone. It had borne every test but one. If it could bear the test of\nsevere pressure, they decided to accept it for the cornerstone. The\ntrial was made. The stone was accepted, brought to its assigned\nposition, and found to be an exact fit. In prophetic vision, Isaiah was\nshown that this stone was a symbol of Christ. He says:\n\u201cSanctify the Lord of hosts Himself; and let Him be your fear,\nand let Him be your dread. And He shall be for a sanctuary; but for\na stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses\nof Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\nAnd many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and\nbe snared, and be taken.\u201d Carried down in prophetic vision to the\nfirst advent, the prophet is shown that Christ is to bear trials and\ntests of which the treatment of the chief cornerstone in the temple\nof Solomon was symbolic. \u201cTherefore thus saith the Lord God,\nBehold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a\nprecious cornerstone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not\nmake haste.\u201d Isaiah 8:13-15; 28:16.\nIn infinite wisdom, God chose the foundation stone, and laid it\nHimself. He called it \u201ca sure foundation.\u201d The entire world may lay\nupon it their burdens and griefs; it can endure them all. With perfect\nsafety they may build upon it. Christ is a \u201ctried stone.\u201d Those who\ntrust in Him, He never disappoints. He has borne every test. He has\nendured the pressure of Adam\u2019s guilt, and the guilt of his posterity,[599]\nand has come off more than conqueror of the powers of evil. He\nhas borne the burdens cast upon Him by every repenting sinner. In\nChrist the guilty heart has found relief. He is the sure foundation.\nAll who make Him their dependence rest in perfect security.\nIn Isaiah\u2019s prophecy, Christ is declared to be both a sure foun-\ndation and a stone of stumbling. The apostle Peter, writing by\ninspiration of the Holy Spirit, clearly shows to whom Christ is a\nfoundation stone, and to whom a rock of offense:\nTemple Cleansed Again 519\n\u201cIf so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. To whom\ncoming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but cho-\nsen of God, and precious, ye also, as lively stones, are built up a\nspiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices,\nacceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contained\nin the Scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief cornerstone, elect,\nprecious: and he that believeth on Him shall not be confounded.\nUnto you therefore which believe He is precious: but unto them\nwhich be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the\nsame is made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling, and\na rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being\ndisobedient.\u201d 1 Peter 2:3-8.\nTo those who believe, Christ is the sure foundation. These are\nthey who fall upon the Rock and are broken. Submission to Christ\nand faith in Him are here represented. To fall upon the Rock and be\nbroken is to give up our self-righteousness and to go to Christ with\nthe humility of a child, repenting of our transgressions, and believing\nin His forgiving love. And so also it is by faith and obedience that\nwe build on Christ as our foundation.\nUpon this living stone, Jews and Gentiles alike may build. This\nis the only foundation upon which we may securely build. It is broad\nenough for all, and strong enough to sustain the weight and burden\nof the whole world. And by connection with Christ, the living stone,\nall who build upon this foundation become living stones. Many\npersons are by their own endeavors hewn, polished, and beautified;\nbut they cannot become \u201cliving stones,\u201d because they are not con-\nnected with Christ. Without this connection, no man can be saved.\nWithout the life of Christ in us, we cannot withstand the storms of\ntemptation. Our eternal safety depends upon our building upon the\nsure foundation. Multitudes are today building upon foundations\nthat have not been tested. When the rain falls, and the tempest rages,\nand the floods come, their house will fall, because it is not founded [600]\nupon the eternal Rock, the chief cornerstone Christ Jesus.\n\u201cTo them which stumble at the word, being disobedient,\u201d Christ\nis a rock of offense. But \u201cthe stone which the builders disallowed,\nthe same is made the head of the corner.\u201d Like the rejected stone,\nChrist in His earthly mission had borne neglect and abuse. He was\n\u201cdespised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted\n520 The Desire of Ages\nwith grief: ... He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.\u201d Isaiah\n53:3. But the time was near when He would be glorified. By the\nresurrection from the dead He would be declared \u201cthe Son of God\nwith power.\u201d Romans 1:4. At His second coming He would be\nrevealed as Lord of heaven and earth. Those who were now about to\ncrucify Him would recognize His greatness. Before the universe the\nrejected stone would become the head of the corner.\nAnd on \u201cwhomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\u201d\nThe people who rejected Christ were soon to see their city and their\nnation destroyed. Their glory would be broken, and scattered as the\ndust before the wind. And what was it that destroyed the Jews? It\nwas the rock which, had they built upon it, would have been their\nsecurity. It was the goodness of God despised, the righteousness\nspurned, the mercy slighted. Men set themselves in opposition to\nGod, and all that would have been their salvation was turned to their\ndestruction. All that God ordained unto life they found to be unto\ndeath. In the Jews\u2019 crucifixion of Christ was involved the destruction\nof Jerusalem. The blood shed upon Calvary was the weight that sank\nthem to ruin for this world and for the world to come. So it will be\nin the great final day, when judgment shall fall upon the rejecters of\nGod\u2019s grace. Christ, their rock of offense, will then appear to them\nas an avenging mountain. The glory of His countenance, which to\nthe righteous is life, will be to the wicked a consuming fire. Because\nof love rejected, grace despised, the sinner will be destroyed.\nBy many illustrations and repeated warnings, Jesus showed what\nwould be the result to the Jews of rejecting the Son of God. In these\nwords He was addressing all in every age who refuse to receive\nHim as their Redeemer. Every warning is for them. The desecrated\ntemple, the disobedient son, the false husbandmen, the contemptuous\nbuilders, have their counterpart in the experience of every sinner.\nUnless he repent, the doom which they foreshadowed will be his.\nChapter 66\u2014Controversy [601]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 22:15-46; Mark 12:13-40; Luke\n20:20-47\nThe priests and rulers had listened in silence to Christ\u2019s pointed\nrebukes. They could not refute His charges. But they were only\nthe more determined to entrap Him, and with this object they sent\nto Him spies, \u201cwhich should feign themselves just men, that they\nmight take hold of His words, that so they might deliver Him unto\nthe power and authority of the governor.\u201d They did not send the old\nPharisees whom Jesus had often met, but young men, who were\nardent and zealous, and whom, they thought, Christ did not know.\nThese were accompanied by certain of the Herodians, who were to\nhear Christ\u2019s words, that they might testify against Him at His trial.\nThe Pharisees and Herodians had been bitter enemies, but they were\nnow one in enmity to Christ.\nThe Pharisees had ever chafed under the exaction of tribute by the\nRomans. The payment of tribute they held to be contrary to the law\nof God. Now they saw opportunity to lay a snare for Jesus. The spies\ncame to Him, and with apparent sincerity, as though desiring to know\ntheir duty, said, \u201cMaster, we know that Thou sayest and teachest\nrightly, neither acceptest Thou the person of any, but teachest the\nway of God truly: is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or\nno?\u201d\nThe words, \u201cWe know that Thou sayest and teachest rightly,\u201d [602]\nhad they been sincere, would have been a wonderful admission. But\nthey were spoken to deceive; nevertheless their testimony was true.\nThe Pharisees did know that Christ said and taught rightly, and by\ntheir own testimony will they be judged.\nThose who put the question to Jesus thought that they had suf-\nficiently disguised their purpose; but Jesus read their hearts as an\nopen book, and sounded their hypocrisy. \u201cWhy tempt ye Me?\u201d He\nsaid; thus giving them a sign they had not asked, by showing that\n521\n522 The Desire of Ages\nHe read their hidden purpose. They were still more confused when\nHe added, \u201cShow Me a penny.\u201d They brought it, and He asked them,\n\u201cWhose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said,\nCaesar\u2019s.\u201d Pointing to the inscription on the coin, Jesus said, \u201cRen-\nder therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar\u2019s; and unto\nGod the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d\nThe spies had expected Jesus to answer their question directly,\nin one way or the other. If He should say, It is unlawful to give\ntribute to Caesar, He would be reported to the Roman authorities and\narrested for inciting rebellion. But in case He should pronounce it\nlawful to pay the tribute, they designed to accuse Him to the people\nas opposing the law of God. Now they felt themselves baffled and\ndefeated. Their plans were disarranged. The summary manner in\nwhich their question had been settled left them nothing further to\nsay.\nChrist\u2019s reply was no evasion, but a candid answer to the ques-\ntion. Holding in His hand the Roman coin, upon which were stamped\nthe name and image of Caesar, He declared that since they were\nliving under the protection of the Roman power, they should render\nto that power the support it claimed, so long as this did not conflict\nwith a higher duty. But while peaceably subject to the laws of the\nland, they should at all times give their first allegiance to God.\nThe Saviour\u2019s words, \u201cRender ... unto God the things that are\nGod\u2019s,\u201d were a severe rebuke to the intriguing Jews. Had they\nfaithfully fulfilled their obligations to God, they would not have\nbecome a broken nation, subject to a foreign power. No Roman\nensign would have waved over Jerusalem, no Roman sentinel would\nhave stood at her gates, no Roman governor would have ruled within\nher walls. The Jewish nation was then paying the penalty of its\napostasy from God.\nWhen the Pharisees heard Christ\u2019s answer, \u201cthey marveled, and\nleft Him, and went their way.\u201d He had rebuked their hypocrisy and\npresumption, and in doing this He had stated a great principle, a[603]\nprinciple that clearly defines the limits of man\u2019s duty to the civil\ngovernment and his duty to God. In many minds a vexed question\nhad been settled. Ever after they held to the right principle. And\nalthough many went away dissatisfied, they saw that the principle\nControversy 523\nunderlying the question had been clearly set forth, and they marveled\nat Christ\u2019s far-seeing discernment.\nNo sooner were the Pharisees silenced than the Sadducees came\nforward with their artful questions. The two parties stood in bitter\nopposition to each other. The Pharisees were rigid adherents to\ntradition. They were exact in outward ceremonies, diligent in wash-\nings, fastings, and long prayers, and ostentatious in almsgiving. But\nChrist declared that they made void the law of God by teaching for\ndoctrines the commandments of men. As a class they were bigoted\nand hypocritical; yet among them were persons of genuine piety,\nwho accepted Christ\u2019s teachings and became His disciples. The\nSadducees rejected the traditions of the Pharisees. They professed\nto believe the greater portion of the Scriptures, and to regard them as\nthe rule of action; but practically they were skeptics and materialists.\nThe Sadducees denied the existence of angels, the resurrection\nof the dead, and the doctrine of a future life, with its rewards and\npunishments. On all these points they differed with the Pharisees.\nBetween the two parties the resurrection was especially a subject of\ncontroversy. The Pharisees had been firm believers in the resurrec-\ntion, but in these discussions their views in regard to the future state [604]\nbecame confused. Death became to them an inexplicable mystery.\nTheir inability to meet the arguments of the Sadducees gave rise to\ncontinual irritation. The discussions between the two parties usually\nresulted in angry disputes, leaving them farther apart than before.\nIn numbers the Sadducees fell far below their opponents, and\nthey had not so strong a hold upon the common people; but many of\nthem were wealthy, and they had the influence which wealth imparts.\nIn their ranks were included most of the priests, and from among\nthem the high priest was usually chosen. This was, however, with\nthe express stipulation that their skeptical opinions should not be\nmade prominent. On account of the numbers and popularity of the\nPharisees, it was necessary for the Sadducees to concede outwardly\nto their doctrines when holding any priestly office; but the very fact\nthat they were eligible to such office gave influence to their errors.\nThe Sadducees rejected the teaching of Jesus; He was animated\nby a spirit which they would not acknowledge as manifesting itself\nthus; and His teaching in regard to God and the future life contra-\ndicted their theories. They believed in God as the only being superior\n524 The Desire of Ages\nto man; but they argued that an overruling providence and a divine\nforesight would deprive man of free moral agency, and degrade him\nto the position of a slave. It was their belief, that, having created\nman, God had left him to himself, independent of a higher influence.\nThey held that man was free to control his own life and to shape the\nevents of the world; that his destiny was in his own hands. They\ndenied that the Spirit of God works through human efforts or natural\nmeans. Yet they still held that, through the proper employment of\nhis natural powers, man could become elevated and enlightened;\nthat by rigorous and austere exactions his life could be purified.\nTheir ideas of God molded their own character. As in their view\nHe had no interest in man, so they had little regard for one another;\nthere was little union among them. Refusing to acknowledge the\ninfluence of the Holy Spirit upon human action, they lacked His\npower in their lives. Like the rest of the Jews, they boasted much of\ntheir birthright as children of Abraham, and of their strict adherence\nto the requirements of the law; but of the true spirit of the law and\nthe faith and benevolence of Abraham, they were destitute. Their\nnatural sympathies were brought within a narrow compass. They\nbelieved it possible for all men to secure the comforts and blessings[605]\nof life; and their hearts were not touched by the wants and sufferings\nof others. They lived for themselves.\nBy His words and His works, Christ testified to a divine power\nthat produces supernatural results, to a future life beyond the present,\nto God as a Father of the children of men, ever watchful of their true\ninterests. He revealed the working of divine power in benevolence\nand compassion that rebuked the selfish exclusiveness of the Sad-\nducees. He taught that both for man\u2019s temporal and for his eternal\ngood, God moves upon the heart by the Holy Spirit. He showed the\nerror of trusting to human power for that transformation of character\nwhich can be wrought only by the Spirit of God.\nThis teaching the Sadducees were determined to discredit. In\nseeking a controversy with Jesus, they felt confident of bringing Him\ninto disrepute, even if they could not secure His condemnation. The\nresurrection was the subject on which they chose to question Him.\nShould He agree with them, He would give still further offense to\nthe Pharisees. Should He differ with them, they designed to hold\nHis teaching up to ridicule.\nControversy 525\nThe Sadducees reasoned that if the body is to be composed of\nthe same particles of matter in its immortal as in its mortal state,\nthen when raised from the dead it must have flesh and blood, and\nmust resume in the eternal world the life interrupted on earth. In that\ncase they concluded that earthly relationships would be resumed,\nhusband and wife would be reunited, marriages consummated, and\nall things go on the same as before death, the frailties and passions\nof this life being perpetuated in the life beyond.\nIn answer to their questions, Jesus lifted the veil from the future\nlife. \u201cIn the resurrection,\u201d He said, \u201cthey neither marry, nor are given\nin marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.\u201d He showed that\nthe Sadducees were wrong in their belief. Their premises were false.\n\u201cYe do err,\u201d He added, \u201cnot knowing the Scriptures, nor the power\nof God.\u201d He did not charge them, as He had charged the Pharisees,\nwith hypocrisy, but with error of belief.\nThe Sadducees had flattered themselves that they of all men\nadhered most strictly to the Scriptures. But Jesus showed that they\nhad not known their true meaning. That knowledge must be brought\nhome to the heart by the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit. Their\nignorance of the Scriptures and the power of God He declared to\nbe the cause of their confusion of faith and darkness of mind. They [606]\nwere seeking to bring the mysteries of God within the compass\nof their finite reasoning. Christ called upon them to open their\nminds to those sacred truths that would broaden and strengthen the\nunderstanding. Thousands become infidels because their finite minds\ncannot comprehend the mysteries of God. They cannot explain the\nwonderful exhibition of divine power in His providences, therefore\nthey reject the evidences of such power, attributing them to natural\nagencies which they can comprehend still less. The only key to the\nmysteries that surround us is to acknowledge in them all the presence\nand power of God. Men need to recognize God as the Creator of the\nuniverse, One who commands and executes all things. They need a\nbroader view of His character, and of the mystery of His agencies.\nChrist declared to His hearers that if there were no resurrection\nof the dead, the Scriptures which they professed to believe would\nbe of no avail. He said, \u201cBut as touching the resurrection of the\ndead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God,\nsaying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the\n526 The Desire of Ages\nGod of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.\u201d\nGod counts the things that are not as though they were. He sees\nthe end from the beginning, and beholds the result of His work as\nthough it were now accomplished. The precious dead, from Adam\ndown to the last saint who dies, will hear the voice of the Son of\nGod, and will come forth from the grave to immortal life. God will\nbe their God, and they shall be His people. There will be a close and\ntender relationship between God and the risen saints. This condition,\nwhich is anticipated in His purpose, He beholds as if it were already\nexisting. The dead live unto Him.\nBy the words of Christ the Sadducees were put to silence. They\ncould not answer Him. Not a word had been spoken of which the\nleast advantage could be taken for His condemnation. His adver-\nsaries had gained nothing but the contempt of the people.\nThe Pharisees, however, did not yet despair of driving Him to\nspeak that which they could use against Him. They prevailed upon\na certain learned scribe to question Jesus as to which of the ten\nprecepts of the law was of the greatest importance.\nThe Pharisees had exalted the first four commandments, which\npoint out the duty of man to his Maker, as of far greater consequence\nthan the other six, which define man\u2019s duty to his fellow man. As the\nresult, they greatly failed of practical godliness. Jesus had shown the[607]\npeople their great deficiency, and had taught the necessity of good\nworks, declaring that the tree is known by its fruits. For this reason\nHe had been charged with exalting the last six commandments above\nthe first four.\nThe lawyer approached Jesus with a direct question, \u201cWhich is\nthe first commandment of all?\u201d The answer of Christ is direct and\nforcible: \u201cThe first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The\nLord our God is one Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord thy God\nwith all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and\nwith all thy strength: this is the first commandment.\u201d The second\nis like the first, said Christ; for it flows out of it, \u201cThou shalt love\nthy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater\nthan these.\u201d \u201cOn these two commandments hang all the law and the\nprophets.\u201d\nThe first four of the Ten Commandments are summed up in the\none great precept, \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy\nControversy 527\nheart.\u201d The last six are included in the other, \u201cThou shalt love thy\nneighbor as thyself.\u201d Both these commandments are an expression\nof the principle of love. The first cannot be kept and the second\nbroken, nor can the second be kept while the first is broken. When\nGod has His rightful place on the throne of the heart, the right place\nwill be given to our neighbor. We shall love him as ourselves. And\nonly as we love God supremely is it possible to love our neighbor\nimpartially.\nAnd since all the commandments are summed up in love to\nGod and man, it follows that not one precept can be broken without\nviolating this principle. Thus Christ taught His hearers that the law\nof God is not so many separate precepts, some of which are of great\nimportance, while others are of small importance and may with\nimpunity be ignored. Our Lord presents the first four and the last six\ncommandments as a divine whole, and teaches that love to God will\nbe shown by obedience to all His commandments.\nThe scribe who had questioned Jesus was well read in the law,\nand he was astonished at His words. He did not expect Him to\nmanifest so deep and thorough a knowledge of the Scriptures. He\nhad gained a broader view of the principles underlying the sacred\nprecepts. Before the assembled priests and rulers he honestly ac-\nknowledged that Christ had given the right interpretation to the law,\nsaying:\n\u201cWell, Master, Thou hast said the truth: for there is one God;\nand there is none other but He: and to love Him with all the heart,\nand with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the [608]\nstrength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than all whole\nburnt offerings and sacrifices.\u201d\nThe wisdom of Christ\u2019s answer had convicted the scribe. He\nknew that the Jewish religion consisted in outward ceremonies rather\nthan inward piety. He had some sense of the worthlessness of mere\nceremonial offerings, and the faithless shedding of blood for expia-\ntion of sin. Love and obedience to God, and unselfish regard for man,\nappeared to him of more value than all these rites. The readiness of\nthis man to acknowledge the correctness of Christ\u2019s reasoning, and\nhis decided and prompt response before the people, manifested a\nspirit entirely different from that of the priests and rulers. The heart\nof Jesus went out in pity to the honest scribe who had dared to face\n528 The Desire of Ages\nthe frowns of the priests and the threats of the rulers to speak the\nconvictions of his heart. \u201cAnd when Jesus saw that he answered\ndiscreetly, He said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of\nGod.\u201d\nThe scribe was near to the kingdom of God, in that he recognized\ndeeds of righteousness as more acceptable to God than burnt offer-\nings and sacrifices. But he needed to recognize the divine character\nof Christ, and through faith in Him receive power to do the works of\nrighteousness. The ritual service was of no value, unless connected\nwith Christ by living faith. Even the moral law fails of its purpose,\nunless it is understood in its relation to the Saviour. Christ had\nrepeatedly shown that His Father\u2019s law contained something deeper\nthan mere authoritative commands. In the law is embodied the same\nprinciple that is revealed in the gospel. The law points out man\u2019s\nduty and shows him his guilt. To Christ he must look for pardon and\nfor power to do what the law enjoins.\nThe Pharisees had gathered close about Jesus as He answered\nthe question of the scribe. Now turning He put a question to them:\n\u201cWhat think ye of Christ? whose son is He?\u201d This question was de-\nsigned to test their belief concerning the Messiah,\u2014to show whether\nthey regarded Him simply as a man or as the Son of God. A chorus\nof voices answered, \u201cThe Son of David.\u201d This was the title which\nprophecy had given to the Messiah. When Jesus revealed His divin-\nity by His mighty miracles, when He healed the sick and raised the\ndead, the people had inquired among themselves, \u201cIs not this the\nSon of David?\u201d The Syrophoenician woman, blind Bartimaeus, and\nmany others had cried to Him for help, \u201cHave mercy on me, O Lord,\nThou Son of David.\u201d Matthew 15:22. While riding into Jerusalem\nHe had been hailed with the joyful shout, \u201cHosanna to the Son of[609]\nDavid: Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.\u201d Matthew\n21:9. And the little children in the temple had that day echoed the\nglad ascription. But many who called Jesus the Son of David did\nnot recognize His divinity. They did not understand that the Son of\nDavid was also the Son of God.\nIn reply to the statement that Christ was the Son of David, Jesus\nsaid, \u201cHow then doth David in Spirit [the Spirit of Inspiration from\nGod] call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou\non My right hand, till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool? If David\nControversy 529\nthen call Him Lord, how is He his son? And no man was able to\nanswer Him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask\nHim any more questions.\u201d\nChapter 67\u2014Woes on the Pharisees[610]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 23; Mark 12:41-44; Luke\n20:45-47; Luke 21:1-4.\nIt was the last day of Christ\u2019s teaching in the temple. Of the\nvast throngs that were gathered at Jerusalem, the attention of all had\nbeen attracted to Him; the people had crowded the temple courts,\nwatching the contest that had been in progress, and they eagerly\ncaught every word that fell from His lips. Never before had such\na scene been witnessed. There stood the young Galilean, bearing\nno earthly honor or royal badge. Surrounding Him were priests in\ntheir rich apparel, rulers with robes and badges significant of their\nexalted station, and scribes with scrolls in their hands, to which they\nmade frequent reference. Jesus stood calmly before them, with the\ndignity of a king. As one invested with the authority of heaven, He\nlooked unflinchingly upon His adversaries, who had rejected and\ndespised His teachings, and who thirsted for His life. They had\nassailed Him in great numbers, but their schemes to ensnare and\ncondemn Him had been in vain. Challenge after challenge He had\nmet, presenting the pure, bright truth in contrast to the darkness and\nerrors of the priests and Pharisees. He had set before these leaders\ntheir real condition, and the retribution sure to follow persistence in\ntheir evil deeds. The warning had been faithfully given. Yet another\nwork remained for Christ to do. Another purpose was still to be[611]\naccomplished.\nThe interest of the people in Christ and His work had steadily\nincreased. They were charmed with His teaching, but they were also\ngreatly perplexed. They had respected the priests and rabbis for their\nintelligence and apparent piety. In all religious matters they had\never yielded implicit obedience to their authority. Yet they now saw\nthese men trying to cast discredit upon Jesus, a teacher whose virtue\nand knowledge shone forth the brighter from every assault. They\nlooked upon the lowering countenances of the priests and elders,\n530\nWoes on the Pharisees 531\nand there saw discomfiture and confusion. They marveled that the\nrulers would not believe on Jesus, when His teachings were so plain\nand simple. They themselves knew not what course to take. With\neager anxiety they watched the movements of those whose counsel\nthey had always followed.\nIn the parables which Christ had spoken, it was His purpose both\nto warn the rulers and to instruct the people who were willing to be\ntaught. But there was need to speak yet more plainly. Through their\nreverence for tradition and their blind faith in a corrupt priesthood,\nthe people were enslaved. These chains Christ must break. The [612]\ncharacter of the priests, rulers, and Pharisees must be more fully\nexposed.\n\u201cThe scribes and the Pharisees,\u201d He said, \u201csit in Moses\u2019 seat: all\ntherefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but\ndo not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.\u201d The scribes\nand Pharisees claimed to be invested with divine authority similar to\nthat of Moses. They assumed to take his place as expounders of the\nlaw and judges of the people. As such they claimed from the people\nthe utmost deference and obedience. Jesus bade His hearers do that\nwhich the rabbis taught according to the law, but not to follow their\nexample. They themselves did not practice their own teaching.\nAnd they taught much that was contrary to the Scriptures. Jesus\nsaid, \u201cThey bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay\nthem on men\u2019s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them\nwith one of their fingers.\u201d The Pharisees enjoined a multitude of\nregulations, having their foundation in tradition, and unreasonably\nrestricting personal liberty. And certain portions of the law they\nso explained as to impose upon the people observances which they\nthemselves secretly ignored, and from which, when it served their\npurpose, they actually claimed exemption.\nTo make a show of their piety was their constant aim. Nothing\nwas held too sacred to serve this end. To Moses God had said\nconcerning His commandments, \u201cThou shalt bind them for a sign\nupon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 6:8. These words have a deep meaning. As the word\nof God is meditated upon and practiced, the whole man will be\nennobled. In righteous and merciful dealing, the hands will reveal,\nas a signet, the principles of God\u2019s law. They will be kept clean\n532 The Desire of Ages\nfrom bribes, and from all that is corrupt and deceptive. They will be\nactive in works of love and compassion. The eyes, directed toward a\nnoble purpose, will be clear and true. The expressive countenance,\nthe speaking eye, will testify to the blameless character of him who\nloves and honors the word of God. But by the Jews of Christ\u2019s\nday all this was undiscerned. The command given to Moses was\nconstrued into a direction that the precepts of Scripture should be\nworn upon the person. They were accordingly written upon strips of\nparchment, and bound in a conspicuous manner about the head and\nwrists. But this did not cause the law of God to take a firmer hold of\nthe mind and heart. These parchments were worn merely as badges,\nto attract attention. They were thought to give the wearers an air of[613]\ndevotion which would command the reverence of the people. Jesus\nstruck a blow at this vain pretense:\n\u201cBut all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make\nbroad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,\nand love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the\nsynagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men,\nRabbi, Rabbi. But be not ye called Rabbi: for One is your Master,\neven Christ; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father\nupon the earth: for One is your Father, which is in heaven. Neither\nbe ye called master: for One is your Master, even Christ.\u201d In such\nplain words the Saviour revealed the selfish ambition that was ever\nreaching for place and power, displaying a mock humility, while the\nheart was filled with avarice and envy. When persons were invited to\na feast, the guests were seated according to their rank, and those who\nwere given the most honorable place received the first attention and\nspecial favors. The Pharisees were ever scheming to secure these\nhonors. This practice Jesus rebuked.\nHe also reproved the vanity shown in coveting the title of rabbi,\nor master. Such a title, He declared, belonged not to men, but to\nChrist. Priests, scribes, and rulers, expounders and administrators of\nthe law, were all brethren, children of one Father. Jesus impressed\nupon the people that they were to give no man a title of honor\nindicating his control of their conscience or their faith.\nIf Christ were on earth today, surrounded by those who bear the\ntitle of \u201cReverend\u201d or \u201cRight Reverend,\u201d would He not repeat His\nsaying, \u201cNeither be ye called masters: for One is your Master, even\nWoes on the Pharisees 533\nChrist\u201d? The Scripture declares of God, \u201cHoly and reverend is His\nname.\u201d Psalm 111:9. To what human being is such a title befitting?\nHow little does man reveal of the wisdom and righteousness it indi-\ncates! How many of those who assume this title are misrepresenting\nthe name and character of God! Alas, how often have worldly ambi-\ntion, despotism, and the basest sins been hidden under the broidered\ngarments of a high and holy office! The Saviour continued:\n\u201cBut he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. And\nwhosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall\nhumble himself shall be exalted.\u201d Again and again Christ had taught\nthat true greatness is measured by moral worth. In the estimation of\nheaven, greatness of character consists in living for the welfare of\nour fellow men, in doing works of love and mercy. Christ the King [614]\nof glory was a servant to fallen man.\n\u201cWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,\u201d said Jesus;\n\u201cfor ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither\ngo in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.\u201d\nBy perverting the Scriptures, the priests and lawyers blinded the\nminds of those who would otherwise have received a knowledge of\nChrist\u2019s kingdom, and that inward, divine life which is essential to\ntrue holiness.\n\u201cWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour\nwidows\u2019 houses, and for a pretense make long prayer: therefore\nye shall receive the greater damnation.\u201d The Pharisees had great\ninfluence with the people, and of this they took advantage to serve\ntheir own interests. They gained the confidence of pious widows,\nand then represented it as a duty for them to devote their property to\nreligious purposes. Having secured control of their money, the wily\nschemers used it for their own benefit. To cover their dishonesty, they\noffered long prayers in public, and made a great show of piety. This\nhypocrisy Christ declared would bring them the greater damnation.\nThe same rebuke falls upon many in our day who make a high\nprofession of piety. Their lives are stained by selfishness and avarice,\nyet they throw over it all a garment of seeming purity, and thus for\na time deceive their fellow men. But they cannot deceive God. He\nreads every purpose of the heart, and will judge every man according\nto his deeds.\n534 The Desire of Ages\nChrist unsparingly condemned abuses, but He was careful not\nto lessen obligation. He rebuked the selfishness that extorted and\nmisapplied the widow\u2019s gifts. At the same time He commended the\nwidow who brought her offering for God\u2019s treasury. Man\u2019s abuse of\nthe gift could not turn God\u2019s blessing from the giver.\nJesus was in the court where were the treasure chests, and He\nwatched those who came to deposit their gifts. Many of the rich\nbrought large sums, which they presented with great ostentation.\nJesus looked upon them sadly, but made no comment on their liberal\nofferings. Presently His countenance lighted as He saw a poor widow\napproach hesitatingly, as though fearful of being observed. As the\nrich and haughty swept by, to deposit their offerings, she shrank\nback as if hardly daring to venture farther. And yet she longed to\ndo something, little though it might be, for the cause she loved.\nShe looked at the gift in her hand. It was very small in comparison\nwith the gifts of those around her, yet it was her all. Watching her[615]\nopportunity, she hurriedly threw in her two mites, and turned to\nhasten away. But in doing this she caught the eye of Jesus, which\nwas fastened earnestly upon her.\nThe Saviour called His disciples to Him, and bade them mark\nthe widow\u2019s poverty. Then His words of commendation fell upon\nher ear: \u201cOf a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast\nin more than they all.\u201d Tears of joy filled her eyes as she felt that\nher act was understood and appreciated. Many would have advised\nher to keep her pittance for her own use; given into the hands of the\nwell-fed priests, it would be lost sight of among the many costly\ngifts brought to the treasury. But Jesus understood her motive. She\nbelieved the service of the temple to be of God\u2019s appointment, and\nshe was anxious to do her utmost to sustain it. She did what she\ncould, and her act was to be a monument to her memory through all\ntime, and her joy in eternity. Her heart went with her gift; its value\nwas estimated, not by the worth of the coin, but by the love to God\nand the interest in His work that had prompted the deed.\nJesus said of the poor widow, She \u201chath cast in more than they\nall.\u201d The rich had bestowed from their abundance, many of them to\nbe seen and honored by men. Their large donations had deprived\nthem of no comfort, or even luxury; they had required no sacrifice,\nand could not be compared in value with the widow\u2019s mite.\nWoes on the Pharisees 535\nIt is the motive that gives character to our acts, stamping them\nwith ignominy or with high moral worth. Not the great things which\nevery eye sees and every tongue praises does God account most\nprecious. The little duties cheerfully done, the little gifts which\nmake no show, and which to human eyes may appear worthless,\noften stand highest in His sight. A heart of faith and love is dearer\nto God than the most costly gift. The poor widow gave her living\nto do the little that she did. She deprived herself of food in order to\ngive those two mites to the cause she loved. And she did it in faith,\nbelieving that her heavenly Father would not overlook her great need.\nIt was this unselfish spirit and childlike faith that won the Saviour\u2019s\ncommendation.\nAmong the poor there are many who long to show their gratitude\nto God for His grace and truth. They greatly desire to share with\ntheir more prosperous brethren in sustaining His service. These\nsouls should not be repulsed. Let them lay up their mites in the\nbank of heaven. If given from a heart filled with love for God, these\nseeming trifles become consecrated gifts, priceless offerings, which\nGod smiles upon and blesses.\nWhen Jesus said of the widow, She \u201chath cast in more than they [616]\nall,\u201d His words were true, not only of the motive, but of the results\nof her gift. The \u201ctwo mites which make a farthing\u201d have brought to\nGod\u2019s treasury an amount of money far greater than the contributions\nof those rich Jews. The influence of that little gift has been like a\nstream, small in its beginning, but widening and deepening as it\nflowed down through the ages. In a thousand ways it has contributed\nto the relief of the poor and the spread of the gospel. Her example\nof self-sacrifice has acted and reacted upon thousands of hearts in\nevery land and in every age. It has appealed to both the rich and the\npoor, and their offerings have swelled the value of her gift. God\u2019s\nblessing upon the widow\u2019s mite has made it the source of great\nresults. So with every gift bestowed and every act performed with\na sincere desire for God\u2019s glory. It is linked with the purposes of\nOmnipotence. Its results for good no man can measure.\nThe Saviour continued His denunciations of the scribes and\nPharisees: \u201cWoe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever\nshall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear\nby the gold of the temple, he is a debtor! Ye fools and blind: for\n536 The Desire of Ages\nwhether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?\nand, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever\nsweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty. Ye fools and blind:\nfor whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?\u201d\nThe priests interpreted God\u2019s requirements according to their own\nfalse and narrow standard. They presumed to make nice distinctions\nas to the comparative guilt of various sins, passing over some lightly,\nand treating others of perhaps less consequence as unpardonable.\nFor a money consideration they excused persons from their vows.\nAnd for large sums of money they sometimes passed over aggravated\ncrimes. At the same time these priests and rulers would in other\ncases pronounce severe judgment for trivial offenses.\n\u201cWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay\ntithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier\nmatters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to\nhave done, and not to leave the other undone.\u201d In these words Christ\nagain condemns the abuse of sacred obligation. The obligation itself\nHe does not set aside. The tithing system was ordained by God, and\nit had been observed from the earliest times. Abraham, the father of\nthe faithful, paid tithes of all that he possessed. The Jewish rulers\nrecognized the obligation of tithing, and this was right; but they\ndid not leave the people to carry out their own convictions of duty.[617]\nArbitrary rules were laid down for every case. The requirements\nhad become so complicated that it was impossible for them to be\nfulfilled. None knew when their obligations were met. As God gave\nit, the system was just and reasonable; but the priests and rabbis had\nmade it a wearisome burden.\nAll that God commands is of consequence. Christ recognized\nthe payment of tithes as a duty; but He showed that this could not\nexcuse the neglect of other duties. The Pharisees were very exact\nin tithing garden herbs, such as mint, anise, and rue; this cost them\nlittle, and it gave them a reputation for exactness and sanctity. At\nthe same time their useless restrictions oppressed the people and\ndestroyed respect for the sacred system of God\u2019s own appointing.\nThey occupied men\u2019s minds with trifling distinctions, and turned\ntheir attention from essential truths. The weightier matters of the\nlaw, justice, mercy, and truth, were neglected. \u201cThese,\u201d Christ said,\n\u201cought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.\u201d\nWoes on the Pharisees 537\nOther laws had been perverted by the rabbis in like manner.\nIn the directions given through Moses it was forbidden to eat any\nunclean thing. The use of swine\u2019s flesh, and the flesh of certain other\nanimals, was prohibited, as likely to fill the blood with impurities,\nand to shorten life. But the Pharisees did not leave these restrictions\nas God had given them. They went to unwarranted extremes. Among\nother things the people were required to strain all the water used,\nlest it should contain the smallest insect, which might be classed\nwith the unclean animals. Jesus, contrasting these trivial exactions\nwith the magnitude of their actual sins, said to the Pharisees, \u201cYe\nblind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.\u201d\n\u201cWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are\nlike unto whited sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward,\nbut are within full of dead men\u2019s bones, and of all uncleanness.\u201d As\nthe whited and beautifully decorated tomb concealed the putrefying\nremains within, so the outward holiness of the priests and rulers\nconcealed iniquity. Jesus continued:\n\u201cWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye\nbuild the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchers of the\nrighteous, and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we\nwould not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.\nWherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children\nof them which killed the prophets.\u201d To show their esteem for the dead [618]\nprophets, the Jews were very zealous in beautifying their tombs; but\nthey did not profit by their teachings, nor give heed to their reproofs.\nIn the days of Christ a superstitious regard was cherished for the\nresting places of the dead, and vast sums of money were lavished\nupon their decoration. In the sight of God this was idolatry. In their\nundue regard for the dead, men showed that they did not love God\nsupremely, nor their neighbor as themselves. The same idolatry\nis carried to great lengths today. Many are guilty of neglecting\nthe widow and the fatherless, the sick and the poor, in order to\nbuild expensive monuments for the dead. Time, money, and labor\nare freely spent for this purpose, while duties to the living\u2014duties\nwhich Christ has plainly enjoined\u2014are left undone.\nThe Pharisees built the tombs of the prophets, and adorned their\nsepulchers, and said one to another, If we had lived in the days of\nour fathers, we would not have united with them in shedding the\n538 The Desire of Ages\nblood of God\u2019s servants. At the same time they were planning to\ntake the life of His Son. This should be a lesson to us. It should\nopen our eyes to the power of Satan to deceive the mind that turns\nfrom the light of truth. Many follow in the track of the Pharisees.\nThey revere those who have died for their faith. They wonder at\nthe blindness of the Jews in rejecting Christ. Had we lived in His\nday, they declare, we would gladly have received His teaching; we\nwould never have been partakers in the guilt of those who rejected\nthe Saviour. But when obedience to God requires self-denial and\nhumiliation, these very persons stifle their convictions, and refuse\nobedience. Thus they manifest the same spirit as did the Pharisees\nwhom Christ condemned.\nLittle did the Jews realize the terrible responsibility involved in\nrejecting Christ. From the time when the first innocent blood was\nshed, when righteous Abel fell by the hand of Cain, the same history\nhad been repeated, with increasing guilt. In every age prophets had\nlifted up their voices against the sins of kings, rulers, and people,\nspeaking the words which God gave them, and obeying His will\nat the peril of their lives. From generation to generation there had\nbeen heaping up a terrible punishment for the rejecters of light and\ntruth. This the enemies of Christ were now drawing down upon\ntheir own heads. The sin of the priests and rulers was greater than\nthat of any preceding generation. By their rejection of the Saviour,\nthey were making themselves responsible for the blood of all the[619]\nrighteous men slain from Abel to Christ. They were about to fill to\noverflowing their cup of iniquity. And soon it was to be poured upon\ntheir heads in retributive justice. Of this, Jesus warned them:\n\u201cThat upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the\nearth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias\nson of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the al-\ntar. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this\ngeneration.\u201d\nThe scribes and Pharisees who listened to Jesus knew that His\nwords were true. They knew how the prophet Zacharias had been\nslain. While the words of warning from God were upon his lips,\na satanic fury seized the apostate king, and at his command the\nprophet was put to death. His blood had imprinted itself upon the\nvery stones of the temple court, and could not be erased; it remained\nWoes on the Pharisees 539\nto bear testimony against apostate Israel. As long as the temple\nshould stand, there would be the stain of that righteous blood, crying\nto God to be avenged. As Jesus referred to these fearful sins, a thrill\nof horror ran through the multitude.\nLooking forward, Jesus declared that the impenitence of the Jews\nand their intolerance of God\u2019s servants would be the same in the\nfuture as it had been in the past:\n\u201cWherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and\nscribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them\nshall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city\nto city.\u201d Prophets and wise men, full of faith and the Holy Ghost,\u2014\nStephen, James, and many others,\u2014would be condemned and slain.\nWith hand uplifted to heaven, and a divine light enshrouding His\nperson, Christ spoke as a judge to those before Him. His voice, that\nhad so often been heard in gentleness and entreaty, was now heard\nin rebuke and condemnation. The listeners shuddered. Never was\nthe impression made by His words and His look to be effaced.\nChrist\u2019s indignation was directed against the hypocrisy, the gross\nsins, by which men were destroying their own souls, deceiving the\npeople and dishonoring God. In the specious deceptive reasoning of\nthe priests and rulers He discerned the working of satanic agencies.\nKeen and searching had been His denunciation of sin; but He spoke\nno words of retaliation. He had a holy wrath against the prince of\ndarkness; but He manifested no irritated temper. So the Christian\nwho lives in harmony with God, possessing the sweet attributes of\nlove and mercy, will feel a righteous indignation against sin; but [620]\nhe will not be roused by passion to revile those who revile him.\nEven in meeting those who are moved by a power from beneath\nto maintain falsehood, in Christ he will still preserve calmness and\nself-possession.\nDivine pity marked the countenance of the Son of God as He cast\none lingering look upon the temple and then upon His hearers. In a\nvoice choked by deep anguish of heart and bitter tears He exclaimed,\n\u201cO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest\nthem which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy\nchildren together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her\nwings, and ye would not!\u201d This is the separation struggle. In the\n540 The Desire of Ages\nlamentation of Christ the very heart of God is pouring itself forth. It\nis the mysterious farewell of the long-suffering love of the Deity.\nPharisees and Sadducees were alike silenced. Jesus summoned\nHis disciples, and prepared to leave the temple, not as one defeated\nand forced from the presence of his adversaries, but as one whose\nwork was accomplished. He retired a victor from the contest.\nThe gems of truth that fell from Christ\u2019s lips on that eventful day\nwere treasured in many hearts. For them new thoughts started into\nlife, new aspirations were awakened, and a new history began. After\nthe crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, these persons came to the\nfront, and fulfilled their divine commission with a wisdom and zeal\ncorresponding to the greatness of the work. They bore a message\nthat appealed to the hearts of men, weakening the old superstitions\nthat had long dwarfed the lives of thousands. Before their testimony\nhuman theories and philosophies became as idle fables. Mighty were\nthe results flowing from the words of the Saviour to that wondering,\nawestruck crowd in the temple at Jerusalem.\nBut Israel as a nation had divorced herself from God. The natural\nbranches of the olive tree were broken off. Looking for the last time\nupon the interior of the temple, Jesus said with mournful pathos,\n\u201cBehold, your house is left unto you desolate. For I say unto you,\nYe shall not see Me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is He that\ncometh in the name of the Lord.\u201d Hitherto He had called the temple\nHis Father\u2019s house; but now, as the Son of God should pass out\nfrom those walls, God\u2019s presence would be withdrawn forever from\nthe temple built to His glory. Henceforth its ceremonies would be\nmeaningless, its services a mockery.\nChapter 68\u2014In the Outer Court [621]\nThis chapter is based on John 12:20-42.\n\u201cAnd there were certain Greeks among them that came up to\nworship at the feast: the same came therefore to Philip, which was\nof Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see\nJesus. Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and\nPhilip tell Jesus.\u201d\nAt this time Christ\u2019s work bore the appearance of cruel defeat.\nHe had been victor in the controversy with the priests and Pharisees,\nbut it was evident that He would never be received by them as the\nMessiah. The final separation had come. To His disciples the case\nseemed hopeless. But Christ was approaching the consummation\nof His work. The great event which concerned not only the Jewish\nnation, but the whole world, was about to take place. When Christ\nheard the eager request, \u201cWe would see Jesus,\u201d echoing the hunger-\ning cry of the world, His countenance lighted up, and He said, \u201cThe\nhour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.\u201d In the request\nof the Greeks He saw an earnest of the results of His great sacrifice.\nThese men came from the West to find the Saviour at the close\nof His life, as the wise men had come from the East at the beginning.\nAt the time of Christ\u2019s birth the Jewish people were so engrossed\nwith their own ambitious plans that they knew not of His advent.\nThe magi from a heathen land came to the manger with their gifts, [622]\nto worship the Saviour. So these Greeks, representing the nations,\ntribes, and peoples of the world, came to see Jesus. So the people\nof all lands and all ages would be drawn by the Saviour\u2019s cross. So\nshall many \u201ccome from the east and west, and shall sit down with\nAbraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.\u201d Matthew\n8:11.\nThe Greeks had heard of Christ\u2019s triumphal entry into Jerusalem.\nSome supposed, and had circulated the report, that He had driven the\npriests and rulers from the temple, and that He was to take possession\n541\n542 The Desire of Ages\nof David\u2019s throne, and reign as king of Israel. The Greeks longed to\nknow the truth in regard to His mission. \u201cWe would see Jesus,\u201d they\nsaid. Their desire was granted. When the request was brought to\nJesus, He was in that part of the temple from which all except Jews\nwere excluded, but He went out to the Greeks in the outer court, and\nhad a personal interview with them.\nThe hour of Christ\u2019s glorification had come. He was standing in\nthe shadow of the cross, and the inquiry of the Greeks showed Him\nthat the sacrifice He was about to make would bring many sons and\ndaughters to God. He knew that the Greeks would soon see Him in\na position they did not then dream of. They would see Him placed\nbeside Barabbas, a robber and murderer, who would be chosen for\nrelease before the Son of God. They would hear the people, inspired\nby the priests and rulers, making their choice. And to the question,\n\u201cWhat shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?\u201d the answer\nwould be given, \u201cLet Him be crucified.\u201d Matthew 27:22. By making\nthis propitiation for the sins of men, Christ knew that His kingdom\nwould be perfected, and would extend throughout the world. He\nwould work as the Restorer, and His Spirit would prevail. For a\nmoment He looked into futurity, and heard the voices proclaiming\nin all parts of the earth, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh\naway the sin of the world.\u201d John 1:29. In these strangers He saw\nthe pledge of a great harvest, when the partition wall between Jew\nand Gentile should be broken down, and all nations, tongues, and\npeoples should hear the message of salvation. The anticipation of\nthis, the consummation of His hopes, is expressed in the words,\n\u201cThe hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.\u201d But\nthe way in which this glorification must take place was never absent\nfrom Christ\u2019s mind. The gathering in of the Gentiles was to follow\nHis approaching death. Only by His death could the world be saved.\nLike a grain of wheat, the Son of man must be cast into the ground[623]\nand die, and be buried out of sight; but He was to live again.\nChrist presented His future, illustrating it by the things of nature,\nthat the disciples might understand. The true result of His mission\nwas to be reached by His death. \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you,\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cExcept a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth\nalone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.\u201d When the grain of\nwheat falls into the ground and dies, it springs up, and bears fruit.\nIn the Outer Court 543\nSo the death of Christ would result in fruit for the kingdom of God.\nIn accordance with the law of the vegetable kingdom, life was to be\nthe result of His death.\nThose who till the soil have the illustration ever before them.\nYear by year man preserves his supply of grain by apparently throw-\ning away the choicest part. For a time it must be hidden under the\nfurrow, to be watched over by the Lord. Then appears the blade, then\nthe ear, and then the corn in the ear. But this development cannot\ntake place unless the grain is buried out of sight, hidden, and to all\nappearance, lost.\nThe seed buried in the ground produces fruit, and in turn this is\nplanted. Thus the harvest is multiplied. So the death of Christ on the\ncross of Calvary will bear fruit unto eternal life. The contemplation\nof this sacrifice will be the glory of those who, as the fruit of it, will\nlive through the eternal ages.\nThe grain of wheat that preserves its own life can produce no\nfruit. It abides alone. Christ could, if He chose, save Himself from\ndeath. But should He do this, He must abide alone. He could bring\nno sons and daughters to God. Only by yielding up His life could\nHe impart life to humanity. Only by falling into the ground to die\ncould He become the seed of that vast harvest,\u2014the great multitude\nthat out of every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, are\nredeemed to God.\nWith this truth Christ connects the lesson of self-sacrifice that\nall should learn: \u201cHe that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that\nhateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.\u201d All who\nwould bring forth fruit as workers together with Christ must first\nfall into the ground and die. The life must be cast into the furrow\nof the world\u2019s need. Self-love, self-interest, must perish. And the\nlaw of self-sacrifice is the law of self-preservation. The husbandman\npreserves his grain by casting it away. So in human life. To give is\nto live. The life that will be preserved is the life that is freely given\nin service to God and man. Those who for Christ\u2019s sake sacrifice [624]\ntheir life in this world will keep it unto life eternal.\nThe life spent on self is like the grain that is eaten. It disappears,\nbut there is no increase. A man may gather all he can for self; he\nmay live and think and plan for self; but his life passes away, and he\nhas nothing. The law of self-serving is the law of self-destruction.\n544 The Desire of Ages\n\u201cIf any man serve Me,\u201d said Jesus, \u201clet him follow Me; and\nwhere I am, there shall also My servant be: if any man serve Me,\nhim will My Father honor.\u201d All who have borne with Jesus the cross\nof sacrifice will be sharers with Him of His glory. It was the joy\nof Christ in His humiliation and pain that His disciples should be\nglorified with Him. They are the fruit of His self-sacrifice. The\noutworking in them of His own character and spirit is His reward,\nand will be His joy throughout eternity. This joy they share with\nHim as the fruit of their labor and sacrifice is seen in other hearts\nand lives. They are workers together with Christ, and the Father will\nhonor them as He honors His Son.\nThe message of the Greeks, foreshadowing as it did the gathering\nin of the Gentiles, brought to the mind of Jesus His entire mission.\nThe work of redemption passed before Him, from the time when in\nheaven the plan was laid, to the death that was now so near at hand.\nA mysterious cloud seemed to enshroud the Son of God. Its gloom\nwas felt by those near Him. He sat rapt in thought. At last the silence\nwas broken by His mournful voice, \u201cNow is My soul troubled; and\nwhat shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour?\u201d In anticipation\nChrist was already drinking the cup of bitterness. His humanity\nshrank from the hour of abandonment, when to all appearance He\nwould be deserted even by God, when all would see Him stricken,\nsmitten of God, and afflicted. He shrank from public exposure,\nfrom being treated as the worst of criminals, from a shameful and\ndishonored death. A foreboding of His conflict with the powers of\ndarkness, a sense of the awful burden of human transgression, and\nthe Father\u2019s wrath because of sin caused the spirit of Jesus to faint,\nand the pallor of death to overspread His countenance.\nThen came divine submission to His Father\u2019s will. \u201cFor this\ncause,\u201d He said, \u201ccame I unto this hour. Father, glorify Thy name.\u201d\nOnly through the death of Christ could Satan\u2019s kingdom be over-\nthrown. Only thus could man be redeemed, and God be glorified.\nJesus consented to the agony, He accepted the sacrifice. The Majesty\nof heaven consented to suffer as the Sin Bearer. \u201cFather, glorify Thy\nname,\u201d He said. As Christ spoke these words, a response came from[625]\nthe cloud which hovered above His head: \u201cI have both glorified it,\nand will glorify it again.\u201d Christ\u2019s whole life, from the manger to the\ntime when these words were spoken, had glorified God; and in the\nIn the Outer Court 545\ncoming trial His divine-human sufferings would indeed glorify His\nFather\u2019s name.\nAs the voice was heard, a light darted from the cloud, and en-\ncircled Christ, as if the arms of Infinite Power were thrown about\nHim like a wall of fire. The people beheld this scene with terror and\namazement. No one dared to speak. With silent lips and bated breath\nall stood with eyes fixed upon Jesus. The testimony of the Father\nhaving been given, the cloud lifted, and scattered in the heavens. For\nthe time the visible communion between the Father and the Son was\nended.\n\u201cThe people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it\nthundered: others said, An angel spake to Him.\u201d But the inquiring\nGreeks saw the cloud, heard the voice, comprehended its meaning,\nand discerned Christ indeed; to them He was revealed as the Sent of\nGod.\nThe voice of God had been heard at the baptism of Jesus at the\nbeginning of His ministry, and again at His transfiguration on the\nmount. Now at the close of His ministry it was heard for the third\ntime, by a larger number of persons, and under peculiar circum-\nstances. Jesus had just spoken the most solemn truth regarding the\ncondition of the Jews. He had made His last appeal, and pronounced\ntheir doom. Now God again set His seal to the mission of His Son.\nHe recognized the One whom Israel had rejected. \u201cThis voice came\nnot because of Me,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cbut for your sakes.\u201d It was the\ncrowning evidence of His Messiahship, the signal from the Father\nthat Jesus had spoken the truth, and was the Son of God.\n\u201cNow is the judgment of this world,\u201d Christ continued; \u201cnow\nshall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up\nfrom the earth, will draw all unto Me. This He said, signifying what\ndeath He should die.\u201d This is the crisis of the world. If I become the\npropitiation for the sins of men, the world will be lighted up. Satan\u2019s\nhold upon the souls of men will be broken. The defaced image of\nGod will be restored in humanity, and a family of believing saints\nwill finally inherit the heavenly home. This is the result of Christ\u2019s\ndeath. The Saviour is lost in contemplation of the scene of triumph\ncalled up before Him. He sees the cross, the cruel, ignominious\ncross, with all its attending horrors, blazing with glory.\nBut the work of human redemption is not all that is accomplished [626]\n546 The Desire of Ages\nby the cross. The love of God is manifested to the universe. The\nprince of this world is cast out. The accusations which Satan has\nbrought against God are refuted. The reproach which he has cast\nupon heaven is forever removed. Angels as well as men are drawn\nto the Redeemer. \u201cI, if I be lifted up from the earth,\u201d He said, \u201cwill\ndraw all unto Me.\u201d\nMany people were round about Christ as He spoke these words,\nand one said, \u201cWe have heard out of the law that Christ abideth\nforever: and how sayest Thou, The Son of man must be lifted up?\nwho is this Son of man? Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while\nis the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness\ncome upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither\nhe goeth. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be\nthe children of light.\u201d\n\u201cBut though He had done so many miracles before them, yet\nthey believed not on Him.\u201d They had once asked the Saviour, \u201cWhat\nsign showest Thou then, that we may see, and believe Thee?\u201d John\n6:30. Innumerable signs had been given; but they had closed their\neyes and hardened their hearts. Now that the Father Himself had\nspoken, and they could ask for no further sign, they still refused to\nbelieve.\n\u201cNevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on\nHim; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest\nthey should be put out of the synagogue.\u201d They loved the praise\nof men rather than the approval of God. To save themselves from\nreproach and shame, they denied Christ, and rejected the offer of\neternal life. And how many through all the centuries since have\nbeen doing the same thing! To them all the Saviour\u2019s warning words\napply: \u201cHe that loveth his life shall lose it.\u201d \u201cHe that rejecteth Me,\u201d\nsaid Jesus, \u201cand receiveth not My words, hath one that judgeth him:\nthe word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last\nday.\u201d John 12:48.\nAlas for those who knew not the time of their visitation! Slowly\nand regretfully Christ left forever the precincts of the temple.\nChapter 69\u2014On the Mount of Olives [627]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 24; Mark 13; Luke 21:5-38.\nChrist\u2019s words to the priests and rulers, \u201cBehold, your house is\nleft unto you desolate\u201d (Matthew 23:38), had struck terror to their\nhearts. They affected indifference, but the question kept rising in\ntheir minds as to the import of these words. An unseen danger\nseemed to threaten them. Could it be that the magnificent temple,\nwhich was the nation\u2019s glory, was soon to be a heap of ruins? The\nforeboding of evil was shared by the disciples, and they anxiously\nwaited for some more definite statement from Jesus. As they passed\nwith Him out of the temple, they called His attention to its strength\nand beauty. The stones of the temple were of the purest marble,\nof perfect whiteness, and some of them of almost fabulous size. A\nportion of the wall had withstood the siege by Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s\narmy. In its perfect masonry it appeared like one solid stone dug\nentire from the quarry. How those mighty walls could be overthrown\nthe disciples could not comprehend.\nAs Christ\u2019s attention was attracted to the magnificence of the\ntemple, what must have been the unuttered thoughts of that Rejected\nOne! The view before Him was indeed beautiful, but He said with\nsadness, I see it all. The buildings are indeed wonderful. You point\nto these walls as apparently indestructible; but listen to My words:\nThe day will come when \u201cthere shall not be left one stone upon\nanother, that shall not be thrown down.\u201d\nChrist\u2019s words had been spoken in the hearing of a large number [628]\nof people; but when He was alone, Peter, John, James, and Andrew\ncame to Him as He sat upon the Mount of Olives. \u201cTell us,\u201d they\nsaid, \u201cwhen shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of\nThy coming, and of the end of the world?\u201d Jesus did not answer His\ndisciples by taking up separately the destruction of Jerusalem and\nthe great day of His coming. He mingled the description of these\ntwo events. Had He opened to His disciples future events as He\n547\n548 The Desire of Ages\nbeheld them, they would have been unable to endure the sight. In\nmercy to them He blended the description of the two great crises,\nleaving the disciples to study out the meaning for themselves. When\nHe referred to the destruction of Jerusalem, His prophetic words\nreached beyond that event to the final conflagration in that day when\nthe Lord shall rise out of His place to punish the world for their\niniquity, when the earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more\ncover her slain. This entire discourse was given, not for the disciples\nonly, but for those who should live in the last scenes of this earth\u2019s\nhistory.\nTurning to the disciples, Christ said, \u201cTake heed that no man\ndeceive you. For many shall come in My name, saying, I am Christ;\nand shall deceive many.\u201d Many false messiahs will appear, claiming\nto work miracles, and declaring that the time of the deliverance of\nthe Jewish nation has come. These will mislead many. Christ\u2019s\nwords were fulfilled. Between His death and the siege of Jerusalem\nmany false messiahs appeared. But this warning was given also\nto those who live in this age of the world. The same deceptions\npracticed prior to the destruction of Jerusalem have been practiced\nthrough the ages, and will be practiced again.\n\u201cAnd ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that ye be\nnot troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end\nis not yet.\u201d Prior to the destruction of Jerusalem, men wrestled for\nthe supremacy. Emperors were murdered. Those supposed to be\nstanding next the throne were slain. There were wars and rumors\nof wars. \u201cAll these things must come to pass,\u201d said Christ, \u201cbut the\nend [of the Jewish nation as a nation] is not yet. For nation shall\nrise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall\nbe famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All\nthese are the beginning of sorrows.\u201d Christ said, As the rabbis see\nthese signs, they will declare them to be God\u2019s judgments upon the\nnations for holding in bondage His chosen people. They will declare\nthat these signs are the token of the advent of the Messiah. Be not[629]\ndeceived; they are the beginning of His judgments. The people have\nlooked to themselves. They have not repented and been converted\nthat I should heal them. The signs that they represent as tokens of\ntheir release from bondage are signs of their destruction.\nOn the Mount of Olives 549\n\u201cThen shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you:\nand ye shall be hated of all nations for My name\u2019s sake. And then\nshall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate\none another.\u201d All this the Christians suffered. Fathers and mothers\nbetrayed their children. Children betrayed their parents. Friends\ndelivered their friends up to the Sanhedrin. The persecutors wrought\nout their purpose by killing Stephen, James, and other Christians.\nThrough His servants, God gave the Jewish people a last oppor- [630]\ntunity to repent. He manifested Himself through His witnesses in\ntheir arrest, in their trial, and in their imprisonment. Yet their judges\npronounced on them the death sentence. They were men of whom\nthe world was not worthy, and by killing them the Jews crucified\nafresh the Son of God. So it will be again. The authorities will make\nlaws to restrict religious liberty. They will assume the right that is\nGod\u2019s alone. They will think they can force the conscience, which\nGod alone should control. Even now they are making a beginning;\nthis work they will continue to carry forward till they reach a bound-\nary over which they cannot step. God will interpose in behalf of His\nloyal, commandment-keeping people.\nOn every occasion when persecution takes place, those who\nwitness it make decisions either for Christ or against Him. Those\nwho manifest sympathy for the ones wrongly condemned show their\nattachment for Christ. Others are offended because the principles of\ntruth cut directly across their practice. Many stumble and fall, apos-\ntatizing from the faith they once advocated. Those who apostatize\nin time of trial will, to secure their own safety, bear false witness,\nand betray their brethren. Christ has warned us of this, that we may\nnot be surprised at the unnatural, cruel course of those who reject\nthe light.\nChrist gave His disciples a sign of the ruin to come on Jerusalem,\nand He told them how to escape: \u201cWhen ye shall see Jerusalem\ncompassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is\nnigh. Then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let\nthem which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are\nin the countries enter thereinto. For these be the days of vengeance,\nthat all things which are written may be fulfilled.\u201d This warning was\ngiven to be heeded forty years after, at the destruction of Jerusalem.\n550 The Desire of Ages\nThe Christians obeyed the warning, and not a Christian perished in\nthe fall of the city.\n\u201cPray ye that your flight be not in the winter; neither on the\nSabbath day,\u201d Christ said. He who made the Sabbath did not abolish\nit, nailing it to His cross. The Sabbath was not rendered null and\nvoid by His death. Forty years after His crucifixion it was still to\nbe held sacred. For forty years the disciples were to pray that their\nflight might not be on the Sabbath day.\nFrom the destruction of Jerusalem, Christ passed on rapidly to\nthe greater event, the last link in the chain of this earth\u2019s history,\u2014the\ncoming of the Son of God in majesty and glory. Between these two\nevents, there lay open to Christ\u2019s view long centuries of darkness,\ncenturies for His church marked with blood and tears and agony.[631]\nUpon these scenes His disciples could not then endure to look, and\nJesus passed them by with a brief mention. \u201cThen shall be great\ntribulation,\u201d He said, \u201csuch as was not since the beginning of the\nworld to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days\nshould be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the\nelect\u2019s sake those days shall be shortened.\u201d For more than a thousand\nyears such persecution as the world had never before known was to\ncome upon Christ\u2019s followers. Millions upon millions of His faithful\nwitnesses were to be slain. Had not God\u2019s hand been stretched out\nto preserve His people, all would have perished. \u201cBut for the elect\u2019s\nsake,\u201d He said, \u201cthose days shall be shortened.\u201d\nNow, in unmistakable language, our Lord speaks of His second\ncoming, and He gives warning of dangers to precede His advent\nto the world. \u201cIf any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ,\nor there; believe it not. For there shall arise false christs, and false\nprophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if\nit were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told\nyou before. Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, He is in\nthe desert; go not forth: behold, He is in the secret chambers; believe\nit not. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even\nunto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.\u201d As\none of the signs of Jerusalem\u2019s destruction, Christ had said, \u201cMany\nfalse prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.\u201d False prophets\ndid rise, deceiving the people, and leading great numbers into the\ndesert. Magicians and sorcerers, claiming miraculous power, drew\nOn the Mount of Olives 551\nthe people after them into the mountain solitudes. But this prophecy\nwas spoken also for the last days. This sign is given as a sign of the\nsecond advent. Even now false christs and false prophets are showing\nsigns and wonders to seduce His disciples. Do we not hear the cry,\n\u201cBehold, He is in the desert\u201d? Have not thousands gone forth into\nthe desert, hoping to find Christ? And from thousands of gatherings\nwhere men profess to hold communion with departed spirits is not\nthe call now heard, \u201cBehold, He is in the secret chambers\u201d? This\nis the very claim that spiritism puts forth. But what says Christ?\n\u201cBelieve it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and\nshineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of\nman be.\u201d\nThe Saviour gives signs of His coming, and more than this, He\nfixes the time when the first of these signs shall appear: \u201cImmediately\nafter the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the\nmoon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, [632]\nand the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: and then shall appear\nthe sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of\nthe earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the\nclouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He shall send His\nangels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together\nHis elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.\u201d\nAt the close of the great papal persecution, Christ declared, the\nsun should be darkened, and the moon should not give her light.\nNext, the stars should fall from heaven. And He says, \u201cLearn a\nparable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth\nforth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: so likewise ye, when ye\nshall see all these things, know that He is near, even at the doors.\u201d\nMatthew 24:32, 33, margin.\nChrist has given signs of His coming. He declares that we may\nknow when He is near, even at the doors. He says of those who see\nthese signs, \u201cThis generation shall not pass, till all these things be\nfulfilled.\u201d These signs have appeared. Now we know of a surety that\nthe Lord\u2019s coming is at hand. \u201cHeaven and earth shall pass away,\u201d\nHe says, \u201cbut My words shall not pass away.\u201d\nChrist is coming with clouds and with great glory. A multitude\nof shining angels will attend Him. He will come to raise the dead,\nand to change the living saints from glory to glory. He will come to\n552 The Desire of Ages\nhonor those who have loved Him, and kept His commandments, and\nto take them to Himself. He has not forgotten them nor His promise.\nThere will be a relinking of the family chain. When we look upon\nour dead, we may think of the morning when the trump of God shall\nsound, when \u201cthe dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be\nchanged.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:52. A little longer, and we shall see the\nKing in His beauty. A little longer, and He will wipe all tears from\nour eyes. A little longer, and He will present us \u201cfaultless before the\npresence of His glory with exceeding joy.\u201d Jude 1:24. Wherefore,\nwhen He gave the signs of His coming He said, \u201cWhen these things\nbegin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your\nredemption draweth nigh.\u201d\nBut the day and the hour of His coming Christ has not revealed.\nHe stated plainly to His disciples that He Himself could not make\nknown the day or the hour of His second appearing. Had He been at\nliberty to reveal this, why need He have exhorted them to maintain\nan attitude of constant expectancy? There are those who claim to\nknow the very day and hour of our Lord\u2019s appearing. Very earnest\nare they in mapping out the future. But the Lord has warned them[633]\noff the ground they occupy. The exact time of the second coming of\nthe Son of man is God\u2019s mystery.\nChrist continues, pointing out the condition of the world at His\ncoming: \u201cAs the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the\nSon of man be. For as in the days that were before the Flood they\nwere eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until\nthe day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not until the Flood\ncame, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of\nman be.\u201d Christ does not here bring to view a temporal millennium,\na thousand years in which all are to prepare for eternity. He tells\nus that as it was in Noah\u2019s day, so will it be when the Son of man\ncomes again.\nHow was it in Noah\u2019s day? \u201cGod saw that the wickedness of man\nwas great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of\nhis heart was only evil continually.\u201d Genesis 6:5. The inhabitants of\nthe antediluvian world turned from Jehovah, refusing to do His holy\nwill. They followed their own unholy imagination and perverted\nideas. It was because of their wickedness that they were destroyed;\nand today the world is following the same way. It presents no\nOn the Mount of Olives 553\nflattering signs of millennial glory. The transgressors of God\u2019s law\nare filling the earth with wickedness. Their betting, their horse\nracing, their gambling, their dissipation, their lustful practices, their\nuntamable passions, are fast filling the world with violence.\nIn the prophecy of Jerusalem\u2019s destruction Christ said, \u201cBecause\niniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that\nshall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. And this gospel\nof the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto\nall nations; and then shall the end come.\u201d This prophecy will again\nbe fulfilled. The abounding iniquity of that day finds its counterpart\nin this generation. So with the prediction in regard to the preaching\nof the gospel. Before the fall of Jerusalem, Paul, writing by the\nHoly Spirit, declared that the gospel was preached to \u201cevery creature\nwhich is under heaven.\u201d Colossians 1:23. So now, before the coming\nof the Son of man, the everlasting gospel is to be preached \u201cto every\nnation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.\u201d Revelation 14:6, 14.\nGod \u201chath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world.\u201d\nActs 17:31. Christ tells us when that day shall be ushered in. He\ndoes not say that all the world will be converted, but that \u201cthis gospel\nof the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto\nall nations; and then shall the end come.\u201d By giving the gospel to\nthe world it is in our power to hasten our Lord\u2019s return. We are not\nonly to look for but to hasten the coming of the day of God. 2 Peter\n3:12, margin. Had the church of Christ done her appointed work [634]\nas the Lord ordained, the whole world would before this have been\nwarned, and the Lord Jesus would have come to our earth in power\nand great glory.\nAfter He had given the signs of His coming, Christ said, \u201cWhen\nye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God\nis nigh at hand.\u201d \u201cTake ye heed, watch and pray.\u201d God has always\ngiven men warning of coming judgments. Those who had faith in\nHis message for their time, and who acted out their faith, in obedi-\nence to His commandments, escaped the judgments that fell upon\nthe disobedient and unbelieving. The word came to Noah, \u201cCome\nthou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous\nbefore Me.\u201d Noah obeyed and was saved. The message came to Lot,\n\u201cUp, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city.\u201d\nGenesis 7:1; 19:14. Lot placed himself under the guardianship of\n554 The Desire of Ages\nthe heavenly messengers, and was saved. So Christ\u2019s disciples were\ngiven warning of the destruction of Jerusalem. Those who watched\nfor the sign of the coming ruin, and fled from the city, escaped the\ndestruction. So now we are given warning of Christ\u2019s second coming\nand of the destruction to fall upon the world. Those who heed the\nwarning will be saved.\nBecause we know not the exact time of His coming, we are\ncommanded to watch. \u201cBlessed are those servants, whom the Lord\nwhen He cometh shall find watching.\u201d Luke 12:37. Those who\nwatch for the Lord\u2019s coming are not waiting in idle expectancy. The\nexpectation of Christ\u2019s coming is to make men fear the Lord, and\nfear His judgments upon transgression. It is to awaken them to the\ngreat sin of rejecting His offers of mercy. Those who are watching\nfor the Lord are purifying their souls by obedience to the truth.\nWith vigilant watching they combine earnest working. Because\nthey know that the Lord is at the door, their zeal is quickened to\nco-operate with the divine intelligences in working for the salvation\nof souls. These are the faithful and wise servants who give to the\nLord\u2019s household \u201ctheir portion of meat in due season.\u201d Luke 12:42.\nThey are declaring the truth that is now specially applicable. As\nEnoch, Noah, Abraham, and Moses each declared the truth for his\ntime, so will Christ\u2019s servants now give the special warning for their\ngeneration.\nBut Christ brings to view another class: \u201cIf that evil servant shall\nsay in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to\nsmite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;\nthe lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for\nhim.\u201d\nThe evil servant says in his heart, \u201cMy lord delayeth his coming.\u201d[635]\nHe does not say that Christ will not come. He does not scoff at the\nidea of His second coming. But in his heart and by his actions and\nwords he declares that the Lord\u2019s coming is delayed. He banishes\nfrom the minds of others the conviction that the Lord is coming\nquickly. His influence leads men to presumptuous, careless delay.\nThey are confirmed in their worldliness and stupor. Earthly passions,\ncorrupt thoughts, take possession of the mind. The evil servant\neats and drinks with the drunken, unites with the world in pleasure\nseeking. He smites his fellow servants, accusing and condemning\nOn the Mount of Olives 555\nthose who are faithful to their Master. He mingles with the world.\nLike grows with like in transgression. It is a fearful assimilation.\nWith the world he is taken in the snare. \u201cThe lord of that servant\nshall come ... in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him\nasunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites.\u201d\n\u201cIf therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief,\nand thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.\u201d Revelation\n3:3. The advent of Christ will surprise the false teachers. They are\nsaying, \u201cPeace and safety.\u201d Like the priests and teachers before the\nfall of Jerusalem, they look for the church to enjoy earthly prosperity\nand glory. The signs of the times they interpret as foreshadowing\nthis. But what saith the word of Inspiration? \u201cSudden destruction\ncometh upon them.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 5:3. Upon all who dwell on the\nface of the whole earth, upon all who make this world their home,\nthe day of God will come as a snare. It comes to them as a prowling\nthief.\nThe world, full of rioting, full of godless pleasure, is asleep,\nasleep in carnal security. Men are putting afar off the coming of\nthe Lord. They laugh at warnings. The proud boast is made, \u201cAll\nthings continue as they were from the beginning.\u201d \u201cTomorrow shall\nbe as this day, and much more abundant.\u201d 2 Peter 3:4; Isaiah 56:12.\nWe will go deeper into pleasure loving. But Christ says, \u201cBehold,\nI come as a thief.\u201d Revelation 16:15. At the very time when the\nworld is asking in scorn, \u201cWhere is the promise of His coming?\u201d\nthe signs are fulfilling. While they cry, \u201cPeace and safety,\u201d sudden\ndestruction is coming. When the scorner, the rejecter of truth, has\nbecome presumptuous; when the routine of work in the various\nmoney-making lines is carried on without regard to principle; when\nthe student is eagerly seeking knowledge of everything but his Bible,\nChrist comes as a thief.\nEverything in the world is in agitation. The signs of the times [636]\nare ominous. Coming events cast their shadows before. The Spirit\nof God is withdrawing from the earth, and calamity follows calamity\nby sea and by land. There are tempests, earthquakes, fires, floods,\nmurders of every grade. Who can read the future? Where is security?\nThere is assurance in nothing that is human or earthly. Rapidly\nare men ranging themselves under the banner they have chosen.\nRestlessly are they waiting and watching the movements of their\n556 The Desire of Ages\nleaders. There are those who are waiting and watching and working\nfor our Lord\u2019s appearing. Another class are falling into line under\nthe generalship of the first great apostate. Few believe with heart\nand soul that we have a hell to shun and a heaven to win.\nThe crisis is stealing gradually upon us. The sun shines in the\nheavens, passing over its usual round, and the heavens still declare\nthe glory of God. Men are still eating and drinking, planting and\nbuilding, marrying, and giving in marriage. Merchants are still buy-\ning and selling. Men are jostling one against another, contending\nfor the highest place. Pleasure lovers are still crowding to theaters,\nhorse races, gambling hells. The highest excitement prevails, yet\nprobation\u2019s hour is fast closing, and every case is about to be eter-\nnally decided. Satan sees that his time is short. He has set all his\nagencies at work that men may be deceived, deluded, occupied and\nentranced, until the day of probation shall be ended, and the door of\nmercy be forever shut.\nSolemnly there come to us down through the centuries the warn-\ning words of our Lord from the Mount of Olives: \u201cTake heed to\nyourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeit-\ning, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come\nupon you unawares.\u201d \u201cWatch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye\nmay be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come\nto pass, and to stand before the Son of man.\u201d\nChapter 70\u2014\u201cThe Least of These My Brethren\u201d [637]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 25:31-46.\n\u201cWhen the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the\nholy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His\nglory: and before Him shall be gathered all nations: and He shall\nseparate them one from another.\u201d Thus Christ on the Mount of Olives\npictured to His disciples the scene of the great judgment day. And\nHe represented its decision as turning upon one point. When the\nnations are gathered before Him, there will be but two classes, and\ntheir eternal destiny will be determined by what they have done\nor have neglected to do for Him in the person of the poor and the\nsuffering.\nIn that day Christ does not present before men the great work\nHe has done for them in giving His life for their redemption. He\npresents the faithful work they have done for Him. To those whom\nHe sets upon His right hand He will say, \u201cCome, ye blessed of My\nFather, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of\nthe world: for I was an hungered, and ye gave Me meat: I was thirsty,\nand ye gave Me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me in: naked,\nand ye clothed Me: I was sick, and ye visited Me: I was in prison,\nand ye came unto Me.\u201d But those whom Christ commends know\nnot that they have been ministering unto Him. To their perplexed\ninquiries He answers, \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the\nleast of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\u201d\nJesus had told His disciples that they were to be hated of all men,\nto be persecuted and afflicted. Many would be driven from their\nhomes, and brought to poverty. Many would be in distress through\ndisease and privation. Many would be cast into prison. To all who [638]\nforsook friends or home for His sake He had promised in this life a\nhundredfold. Now He assured a special blessing to all who should\nminister to their brethren. In all who suffer for My name, said Jesus,\n557\n558 The Desire of Ages\nyou are to recognize Me. As you would minister to Me, so you are\nto minister to them. This is the evidence that you are My disciples.\nAll who have been born into the heavenly family are in a special\nsense the brethren of our Lord. The love of Christ binds together\nthe members of His family, and wherever that love is made manifest\nthere the divine relationship is revealed. \u201cEveryone that loveth is\nborn of God, and knoweth God.\u201d 1 John 4:7.\nThose whom Christ commends in the judgment may have known\nlittle of theology, but they have cherished His principles. Through\nthe influence of the divine Spirit they have been a blessing to those\nabout them. Even among the heathen are those who have cherished\nthe spirit of kindness; before the words of life had fallen upon their\nears, they have befriended the missionaries, even ministering to them\nat the peril of their own lives. Among the heathen are those who\nworship God ignorantly, those to whom the light is never brought\nby human instrumentality, yet they will not perish. Though ignorant\nof the written law of God, they have heard His voice speaking to\nthem in nature, and have done the things that the law required. Their\nworks are evidence that the Holy Spirit has touched their hearts, and\nthey are recognized as the children of God.\nHow surprised and gladdened will be the lowly among the na-\ntions, and among the heathen, to hear from the lips of the Saviour,\n\u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My\nbrethren, ye have done it unto Me\u201d! How glad will be the heart of\nInfinite Love as His followers look up with surprise and joy at His\nwords of approval!\nBut not to any class is Christ\u2019s love restricted. He identifies Him-\nself with every child of humanity. That we might become members\nof the heavenly family, He became a member of the earthly family.\nHe is the Son of man, and thus a brother to every son and daughter\nof Adam. His followers are not to feel themselves detached from\nthe perishing world around them. They are a part of the great web\nof humanity; and Heaven looks upon them as brothers to sinners as\nwell as to saints. The fallen, the erring, and the sinful, Christ\u2019s love\nembraces; and every deed of kindness done to uplift a fallen soul,\nevery act of mercy, is accepted as done to Him.\nThe angels of heaven are sent forth to minister to those who shall[639]\nbe heirs of salvation. We know not now who they are; it is not yet\n\u201cThe Least of These My Brethren\u201d 559\nmade manifest who shall overcome, and share the inheritance of\nthe saints in light; but angels of heaven are passing throughout the\nlength and breadth of the earth, seeking to comfort the sorrowing, to\nprotect the imperiled, to win the hearts of men to Christ. Not one is\nneglected or passed by. God is no respecter of persons, and He has\nan equal care for all the souls He has created.\nAs you open your door to Christ\u2019s needy and suffering ones,\nyou are welcoming unseen angels. You invite the companionship of\nheavenly beings. They bring a sacred atmosphere of joy and peace.\nThey come with praises upon their lips, and an answering strain\nis heard in heaven. Every deed of mercy makes music there. The\nFather from His throne numbers the unselfish workers among His\nmost precious treasures.\nThose on the left hand of Christ, those who had neglected Him\nin the person of the poor and the suffering, were unconscious of\ntheir guilt. Satan had blinded them; they had not perceived what\nthey owed to their brethren. They had been self-absorbed, and cared\nnot for others\u2019 needs.\nTo the rich, God has given wealth that they may relieve and\ncomfort His suffering children; but too often they are indifferent\nto the wants of others. They feel themselves superior to their poor\nbrethren. They do not put themselves in the poor man\u2019s place. They\ndo not understand the temptations and struggles of the poor, and\nmercy dies out of their hearts. In costly dwellings and splendid\nchurches, the rich shut themselves away from the poor; the means\nthat God has given to bless the needy is spent in pampering pride\nand selfishness. The poor are robbed daily of the education they\nshould have concerning the tender mercies of God; for He has made\nample provision that they should be comforted with the necessities\nof life. They are compelled to feel the poverty that narrows life,\nand are often tempted to become envious, jealous, and full of evil\nsurmisings. Those who themselves have not endured the pressure\nof want too often treat the poor in a contemptuous way, and make\nthem feel that they are looked upon as paupers.\nBut Christ beholds it all, and He says, It was I who was hungry\nand thirsty. It was I who was a stranger. It was I who was sick. It was\nI who was in prison. While you were feasting at your bountifully\nspread table, I was famishing in the hovel or the empty street. While\n560 The Desire of Ages\nyou were at ease in your luxurious home, I had not where to lay My\nhead. While you crowded your wardrobe with rich apparel, I was[640]\ndestitute. While you pursued your pleasures, I languished in prison.\nWhen you doled out the pittance of bread to the starving poor,\nwhen you gave those flimsy garments to shield them from the biting\nfrost, did you remember that you were giving to the Lord of glory?\nAll the days of your life I was near you in the person of these afflicted\nones, but you did not seek Me. You would not enter into fellowship\nwith Me. I know you not.\nMany feel that it would be a great privilege to visit the scenes\nof Christ\u2019s life on earth, to walk where He trod, to look upon the\nlake beside which He loved to teach, and the hills and valleys on\nwhich His eyes so often rested. But we need not go to Nazareth, to\nCapernaum, or to Bethany, in order to walk in the steps of Jesus. We\nshall find His footprints beside the sickbed, in the hovels of poverty,\nin the crowded alleys of the great city, and in every place where\nthere are human hearts in need of consolation. In doing as Jesus did\nwhen on earth, we shall walk in His steps.\nAll may find something to do. \u201cThe poor always ye have with\nyou,\u201d (John 12:8), Jesus said, and none need feel that there is no\nplace where they can labor for Him. Millions upon millions of\nhuman souls ready to perish, bound in chains of ignorance and sin,\nhave never so much as heard of Christ\u2019s love for them. Were our\ncondition and theirs to be reversed, what would we desire them to\ndo for us? All this, so far as lies in our power, we are under the most\nsolemn obligation to do for them. Christ\u2019s rule of life, by which\nevery one of us must stand or fall in the judgment, is, \u201cWhatsoever ye\nwould that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\u201d Matthew\n7:12.\nThe Saviour has given His precious life in order to establish a\nchurch capable of caring for sorrowful, tempted souls. A company\nof believers may be poor, uneducated, and unknown; yet in Christ\nthey may do a work in the home, the neighborhood, the church, and\neven in \u201cthe regions beyond,\u201d whose results shall be as far-reaching\nas eternity.\nIt is because this work is neglected that so many young disciples\nnever advance beyond the mere alphabet of Christian experience.\nThe light which was glowing in their own hearts when Jesus spoke\n\u201cThe Least of These My Brethren\u201d 561\nto them, \u201cThy sins be forgiven thee,\u201d they might have kept alive by\nhelping those in need. The restless energy that is so often a source of\ndanger to the young might be directed into channels through which\nit would flow out in streams of blessing. Self would be forgotten in [641]\nearnest work to do others good.\nThose who minister to others will be ministered unto by the\nChief Shepherd. They themselves will drink of the living water, and\nwill be satisfied. They will not be longing for exciting amusements,\nor for some change in their lives. The great topic of interest will be,\nhow to save the souls that are ready to perish. Social intercourse will\nbe profitable. The love of the Redeemer will draw hearts together in\nunity.\nWhen we realize that we are workers together with God, His\npromises will not be spoken with indifference. They will burn in our\nhearts, and kindle upon our lips. To Moses, when called to minister\nto an ignorant, undisciplined, and rebellious people, God gave the\npromise, \u201cMy presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.\u201d\nAnd He said, \u201cCertainly I will be with thee.\u201d Exodus 33:14; 3:12.\nThis promise is to all who labor in Christ\u2019s stead for His afflicted\nand suffering ones.\nLove to man is the earthward manifestation of the love of God.\nIt was to implant this love, to make us children of one family, that\nthe King of glory became one with us. And when His parting words\nare fulfilled, \u201cLove one another, as I have loved you\u201d (John 15:12);\nwhen we love the world as He has loved it, then for us His mission\nis accomplished. We are fitted for heaven; for we have heaven in our\nhearts.\nBut \u201cif thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death,\nand those that are ready to be slain; if thou sayest, Behold, we knew\nit not; doth not He that pondereth the heart consider it? and He that\nkeepeth thy soul, doth not He know it? and shall not He render to\nevery man according to his works?\u201d Proverbs 24:11, 12. In the great\nJudgment day, those who have not worked for Christ, who have\ndrifted along thinking of themselves, caring for themselves, will be\nplaced by the Judge of the whole earth with those who did evil. They\nreceive the same condemnation.\nTo every soul a trust is given. Of everyone the Chief Shepherd\nwill demand, \u201cWhere is the flock that was given thee, thy beauti-\n562 The Desire of Ages\nful flock?\u201d And \u201cwhat wilt thou say when He shall punish thee?\u201d\nJeremiah 13:20, 21.\nChapter 71\u2014A Servant of Servants [642]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 22:7-18, 24; John 13:1-17.\nIn the upper chamber of a dwelling at Jerusalem, Christ was\nsitting at table with His disciples. They had gathered to celebrate\nthe Passover. The Saviour desired to keep this feast alone with the\ntwelve. He knew that His hour was come; He Himself was the true\npaschal lamb, and on the day the Passover was eaten He was to be\nsacrificed. He was about to drink the cup of wrath; He must soon\nreceive the final baptism of suffering. But a few quiet hours yet\nremained to Him, and these were to be spent for the benefit of His\nbeloved disciples.\nThe whole life of Christ had been a life of unselfish service. \u201cNot\nto be ministered unto, but to minister,\u201d (Matthew 20:28), had been\nthe lesson of His every act. But not yet had the disciples learned the\nlesson. At this last Passover supper, Jesus repeated His teaching by\nan illustration that impressed it forever on their minds and hearts.\nThe interviews between Jesus and His disciples were usually\nseasons of calm joy, highly prized by them all. The Passover suppers\nhad been scenes of special interest; but upon this occasion Jesus\nwas troubled. His heart was burdened, and a shadow rested upon\nHis countenance. As He met the disciples in the upper chamber, [643]\nthey perceived that something weighed heavily upon His mind, and\nalthough they knew not its cause, they sympathized with His grief.\nAs they were gathered about the table, He said in tones of touch-\ning sadness, \u201cWith desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you\nbefore I suffer: for I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof,\nuntil it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. And He took the cup, and\ngave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:\nfor I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the\nkingdom of God shall come.\u201d\nChrist knew that the time had come for Him to depart out of\nthe world, and go to His Father. And having loved His own that\n563\n564 The Desire of Ages\nwere in the world, He loved them unto the end. He was now in the\nshadow of the cross, and the pain was torturing His heart. He knew\nthat He would be deserted in the hour of His betrayal. He knew that\nby the most humiliating process to which criminals were subjected\nHe would be put to death. He knew the ingratitude and cruelty of\nthose He had come to save. He knew how great the sacrifice that He\nmust make, and for how many it would be in vain. Knowing all that\nwas before Him, He might naturally have been overwhelmed with\nthe thought of His own humiliation and suffering. But He looked\nupon the twelve, who had been with Him as His own, and who, after\nHis shame and sorrow and painful usage were over, would be left to\nstruggle in the world. His thoughts of what He Himself must suffer\nwere ever connected with His disciples. He did not think of Himself.\nHis care for them was uppermost in His mind.\nOn this last evening with His disciples, Jesus had much to tell\nthem. If they had been prepared to receive what He longed to impart,\nthey would have been saved from heartbreaking anguish, from disap-\npointment and unbelief. But Jesus saw that they could not bear what\nHe had to say. As He looked into their faces, the words of warning\nand comfort were stayed upon His lips. Moments passed in silence.\nJesus appeared to be waiting. The disciples were ill at ease. The\nsympathy and tenderness awakened by Christ\u2019s grief seemed to have\npassed away. His sorrowful words, pointing to His own suffering,\nhad made little impression. The glances they cast upon each other\ntold of jealousy and contention.\nThere was \u201ca strife among them, which of them should be ac-\ncounted the greatest.\u201d This contention, carried on in the presence\nof Christ, grieved and wounded Him. The disciples clung to their\nfavorite idea that Christ would assert His power, and take His posi-\ntion on the throne of David. And in heart each still longed for the\nhighest place in the kingdom. They had placed their own estimate[644]\nupon themselves and upon one another, and, instead of regarding\ntheir brethren as more worthy, they had placed themselves first. The\nrequest of James and John to sit on the right and left of Christ\u2019s\nthrone had excited the indignation of the others. That the two broth-\ners should presume to ask for the highest position so stirred the ten\nthat alienation threatened. They felt that they were misjudged, that\nServant of Servants 565\ntheir fidelity and talents were not appreciated. Judas was the most\nsevere upon James and John.\nWhen the disciples entered the supper room, their hearts were\nfull of resentful feelings. Judas pressed next to Christ on the left\nside; John was on the right. If there was a highest place, Judas was\ndetermined to have it, and that place was thought to be next to Christ.\nAnd Judas was a traitor.\nAnother cause of dissension had arisen. At a feast it was custom-\nary for a servant to wash the feet of the guests, and on this occasion\npreparation had been made for the service. The pitcher, the basin,\nand the towel were there, in readiness for the feet washing; but no\nservant was present, and it was the disciples\u2019 part to perform it. But\neach of the disciples, yielding to wounded pride, determined not to\nact the part of a servant. All manifested a stoical unconcern, seeming\nunconscious that there was anything for them to do. By their silence\nthey refused to humble themselves.\nHow was Christ to bring these poor souls where Satan would not\ngain over them a decided victory? How could He show that a mere\nprofession of discipleship did not make them disciples, or insure\nthem a place in His kingdom? How could He show that it is loving\nservice, true humility, which constitutes real greatness? How was\nHe to kindle love in their hearts, and enable them to comprehend\nwhat He longed to tell them?\nThe disciples made no move toward serving one another. Jesus\nwaited for a time to see what they would do. Then He, the divine\nTeacher, rose from the table. Laying aside the outer garment that\nwould have impeded His movements, He took a towel, and girded\nHimself. With surprised interest the disciples looked on, and in\nsilence waited to see what was to follow. \u201cAfter that He poureth\nwater into a basin, and began to wash the disciples\u2019 feet, and to wipe\nthem with the towel wherewith He was girded.\u201d This action opened\nthe eyes of the disciples. Bitter shame and humiliation filled their\nhearts. They understood the unspoken rebuke, and saw themselves\nin altogether a new light.\nSo Christ expressed His love for His disciples. Their selfish spirit\nfilled Him with sorrow, but He entered into no controversy with them\nregarding their difficulty. Instead He gave them an example they [645]\nwould never forget. His love for them was not easily disturbed or\n566 The Desire of Ages\nquenched. He knew that the Father had given all things into His\nhands, and that He came from God, and went to God. He had a full\nconsciousness of His divinity; but He had laid aside His royal crown\nand kingly robes, and had taken the form of a servant. One of the\nlast acts of His life on earth was to gird Himself as a servant, and\nperform a servant\u2019s part.\nBefore the Passover Judas had met a second time with the priests\nand scribes, and had closed the contract to deliver Jesus into their\nhands. Yet he afterward mingled with the disciples as though inno-\ncent of any wrong, and interested in the work of preparing for the\nfeast. The disciples knew nothing of the purpose of Judas. Jesus\nalone could read his secret. Yet He did not expose him. Jesus hun-\ngered for his soul. He felt for him such a burden as for Jerusalem\nwhen He wept over the doomed city. His heart was crying, How can\nI give thee up? The constraining power of that love was felt by Judas.\nWhen the Saviour\u2019s hands were bathing those soiled feet, and wiping\nthem with the towel, the heart of Judas thrilled through and through\nwith the impulse then and there to confess his sin. But he would\nnot humble himself. He hardened his heart against repentance; and\nthe old impulses, for the moment put aside, again controlled him.\nJudas was now offended at Christ\u2019s act in washing the feet of His\ndisciples. If Jesus could so humble Himself, he thought, He could\nnot be Israel\u2019s king. All hope of worldly honor in a temporal king-\ndom was destroyed. Judas was satisfied that there was nothing to\nbe gained by following Christ. After seeing Him degrade Himself,\nas he thought, he was confirmed in his purpose to disown Him, and\nconfess himself deceived. He was possessed by a demon, and he\nresolved to complete the work he had agreed to do in betraying his\nLord.\nJudas, in choosing his position at table, had tried to place himself\nfirst, and Christ as a servant served him first. John, toward whom\nJudas had felt so much bitterness, was left till the last. But John\ndid not take this as a rebuke or slight. As the disciples watched\nChrist\u2019s action, they were greatly moved. When Peter\u2019s turn came,\nhe exclaimed with astonishment, \u201cLord, dost Thou wash my feet?\u201d\nChrist\u2019s condescension broke his heart. He was filled with shame\nto think that one of the disciples was not performing this service.\n\u201cWhat I do,\u201d Christ said, \u201cthou knowest not now; but thou shalt know\nServant of Servants 567\nhereafter.\u201d Peter could not bear to see his Lord, whom he believed to\nbe the Son of God, acting the part of a servant. His whole soul rose\nup against this humiliation. He did not realize that for this Christ [646]\ncame into the world. With great emphasis he exclaimed, \u201cThou shalt\nnever wash my feet.\u201d\nSolemnly Christ said to Peter, \u201cIf I wash thee not, thou hast no\npart with Me.\u201d The service which Peter refused was the type of a\nhigher cleansing. Christ had come to wash the heart from the stain of\nsin. In refusing to allow Christ to wash his feet, Peter was refusing\nthe higher cleansing included in the lower. He was really rejecting\nhis Lord. It is not humiliating to the Master to allow Him to work for\nour purification. The truest humility is to receive with thankful heart\nany provision made in our behalf, and with earnestness do service\nfor Christ.\nAt the words, \u201cIf I wash thee not, thou hast no part with Me,\u201d\nPeter surrendered his pride and self-will. He could not endure the\nthought of separation from Christ; that would have been death to\nhim. \u201cNot my feet only,\u201d he said, \u201cbut also my hands and my head.\nJesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his\nfeet, but is clean every whit.\u201d\nThese words mean more than bodily cleanliness. Christ is still\nspeaking of the higher cleansing as illustrated by the lower. He who\ncame from the bath was clean, but the sandaled feet soon became\ndusty, and again needed to be washed. So Peter and his brethren had\nbeen washed in the great fountain opened for sin and uncleanness.\nChrist acknowledged them as His. But temptation had led them into\nevil, and they still needed His cleansing grace. When Jesus girded\nHimself with a towel to wash the dust from their feet, He desired\nby that very act to wash the alienation, jealousy, and pride from\ntheir hearts. This was of far more consequence than the washing\nof their dusty feet. With the spirit they then had, not one of them\nwas prepared for communion with Christ. Until brought into a\nstate of humility and love, they were not prepared to partake of the\npaschal supper, or to share in the memorial service which Christ\nwas about to institute. Their hearts must be cleansed. Pride and\nself-seeking create dissension and hatred, but all this Jesus washed\naway in washing their feet. A change of feeling was brought about.\nLooking upon them, Jesus could say, \u201cYe are clean.\u201d Now there was\n568 The Desire of Ages\nunion of heart, love for one another. They had become humble and\nteachable. Except Judas, each was ready to concede to another the\nhighest place. Now with subdued and grateful hearts they could\nreceive Christ\u2019s words.\nLike Peter and his brethren, we too have been washed in the\nblood of Christ, yet often through contact with evil the heart\u2019s purity\nis soiled. We must come to Christ for His cleansing grace. Peter\nshrank from bringing his soiled feet in contact with the hands of his\nLord and Master; but how often we bring our sinful, polluted hearts[647]\n[648]\n[649]\nin contact with the heart of Christ! How grievous to Him is our evil\ntemper, our vanity and pride! Yet all our infirmity and defilement\nwe must bring to Him. He alone can wash us clean. We are not\nprepared for communion with Him unless cleansed by His efficacy.\nJesus said to the disciples, \u201cYe are clean, but not all.\u201d He had\nwashed the feet of Judas, but the heart had not been yielded to Him.\nIt was not purified. Judas had not submitted himself to Christ.\nAfter Christ had washed the disciples\u2019 feet, and had taken His\ngarments and sat down again, He said to them, \u201cKnow ye what I\nhave done to you? Ye call Me Master and Lord: and ye say well;\nfor so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet;\nye also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet. For I have given you an\nexample, that ye should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I\nsay unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that\nis sent greater than he that sent him.\u201d\nChrist would have His disciples understand that although He had\nwashed their feet, this did not in the least detract from His dignity.\n\u201cYe call Me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.\u201d And\nbeing so infinitely superior, He imparted grace and significance to\nthe service. No one was so exalted as Christ, and yet He stooped\nto the humblest duty. That His people might not be misled by the\nselfishness which dwells in the natural heart, and which strengthens\nby self-serving, Christ Himself set the example of humility. He\nwould not leave this great subject in man\u2019s charge. Of so much\nconsequence did He regard it, that He Himself, One equal with God,\nacted as servant to His disciples. While they were contending for\nthe highest place, He to whom every knee shall bow, He whom the\nangels of glory count it honor to serve, bowed down to wash the feet\nof those who called Him Lord. He washed the feet of His betrayer.\nServant of Servants 569\nIn His life and lessons, Christ has given a perfect exemplification\nof the unselfish ministry which has its origin in God. God does not\nlive for Himself. By creating the world, and by upholding all things,\nHe is constantly ministering for others. \u201cHe maketh His sun to rise\non the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the\nunjust.\u201d Matthew 5:45. This ideal of ministry God has committed to\nHis Son. Jesus was given to stand at the head of humanity, that by\nHis example He might teach what it means to minister. His whole\nlife was under a law of service. He served all, ministered to all. Thus\nHe lived the law of God, and by His example showed how we are to\nobey it.\nAgain and again Jesus had tried to establish this principle among [650]\nHis disciples. When James and John made their request for pre-\neminence, He had said, \u201cWhosoever will be great among you, let\nhim be your minister.\u201d Matthew 20:26. In My kingdom the principle\nof preference and supremacy has no place. The only greatness is the\ngreatness of humility. The only distinction is found in devotion to\nthe service of others.\nNow, having washed the disciples\u2019 feet, He said, \u201cI have given\nyou an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.\u201d In these\nwords Christ was not merely enjoining the practice of hospitality.\nMore was meant than the washing of the feet of guests to remove the\ndust of travel. Christ was here instituting a religious service. By the\nact of our Lord this humiliating ceremony was made a consecrated\nordinance. It was to be observed by the disciples, that they might\never keep in mind His lessons of humility and service.\nThis ordinance is Christ\u2019s appointed preparation for the sacra-\nmental service. While pride, variance, and strife for supremacy are\ncherished, the heart cannot enter into fellowship with Christ. We\nare not prepared to receive the communion of His body and His\nblood. Therefore it was that Jesus appointed the memorial of His\nhumiliation to be first observed.\nAs they come to this ordinance, the children of God should bring\nto remembrance the words of the Lord of life and glory: \u201cKnow ye\nwhat I have done to you? Ye call Me Master and Lord: and ye say\nwell; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your\nfeet; ye also ought to wash one another\u2019s feet. For I have given you\nan example, that ye should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily,\n570 The Desire of Ages\nI say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he\nthat is sent greater than he that sent him. If ye know these things,\nhappy are ye if ye do them.\u201d There is in man a disposition to esteem\nhimself more highly than his brother, to work for self, to seek the\nhighest place; and often this results in evil surmisings and bitterness\nof spirit. The ordinance preceding the Lord\u2019s Supper is to clear away\nthese misunderstandings, to bring man out of his selfishness, down\nfrom his stilts of self-exaltation, to the humility of heart that will\nlead him to serve his brother.\nThe holy Watcher from heaven is present at this season to make\nit one of soul searching, of conviction of sin, and of the blessed\nassurance of sins forgiven. Christ in the fullness of His grace is there\nto change the current of the thoughts that have been running in selfish\nchannels. The Holy Spirit quickens the sensibilities of those who\nfollow the example of their Lord. As the Saviour\u2019s humiliation for\nus is remembered, thought links with thought; a chain of memories[651]\nis called up, memories of God\u2019s great goodness and of the favor and\ntenderness of earthly friends. Blessings forgotten, mercies abused,\nkindnesses slighted, are called to mind. Roots of bitterness that have\ncrowded out the precious plant of love are made manifest. Defects of\ncharacter, neglect of duties, ingratitude to God, coldness toward our\nbrethren, are called to remembrance. Sin is seen in the light in which\nGod views it. Our thoughts are not thoughts of self-complacency,\nbut of severe self-censure and humiliation. The mind is energized to\nbreak down every barrier that has caused alienation. Evil thinking\nand evilspeaking are put away. Sins are confessed, they are forgiven.\nThe subduing grace of Christ comes into the soul, and the love of\nChrist draws hearts together in a blessed unity.\nAs the lesson of the preparatory service is thus learned, the\ndesire is kindled for a higher spiritual life. To this desire the divine\nWitness will respond. The soul will be uplifted. We can partake of\nthe Communion with a consciousness of sins forgiven. The sunshine\nof Christ\u2019s righteousness will fill the chambers of the mind and the\nsoul temple. We \u201cbehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the\nsin of the world.\u201d John 1:29.\nTo those who receive the spirit of this service, it can never be-\ncome a mere ceremonial. Its constant lesson will be, \u201cBy love serve\none another.\u201d Galatians 5:13. In washing the feet of His disciples,\nServant of Servants 571\nChrist gave evidence that He would do any service, however hum-\nble, that would make them heirs with Him of the eternal wealth of\nheaven\u2019s treasure. His disciples, in performing the same rite, pledge\nthemselves in like manner to serve their brethren. Whenever this\nordinance is rightly celebrated, the children of God are brought into\na holy relationship, to help and bless each other. They covenant that\nthe life shall be given to unselfish ministry. And this, not only for\none another. Their field of labor is as wide as their Master\u2019s was. The\nworld is full of those who need our ministry. The poor, the helpless,\nthe ignorant, are on every hand. Those who have communed with\nChrist in the upper chamber will go forth to minister as He did.\nJesus, the served of all, came to be the servant of all. And\nbecause He ministered to all, He will again be served and honored\nby all. And those who would partake of His divine attributes, and\nshare with Him the joy of seeing souls redeemed, must follow His\nexample of unselfish ministry.\nAll this was comprehended in the words of Jesus, \u201cI have given\nyou an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.\u201d This was\nthe intent of the service He established. And He says, \u201cIf ye know\nthese things,\u201d if you know the purpose of His lessons, \u201chappy are ye\nif ye do them.\u201d\nChapter 72\u2014\u201cIn Remembrance of Me\u201d[652]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 26:20-29; Mark 14:17-25; Luke\n22:14-23; John 13:18-30\n\u201cThe Lord Jesus the same night in which He was betrayed took\nbread: and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and said, Take,\neat: this is My body, which is broken for you: this do in remem-\nbrance of Me. After the same manner also He took the cup, when\nHe had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in My blood:\nthis do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of Me. For as often\nas ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord\u2019s death\ntill He come.\u201d 1 Corinthians 11:23-26.\nChrist was standing at the point of transition between two\neconomies and their two great festivals. He, the spotless Lamb\nof God, was about to present Himself as a sin offering, that He\nwould thus bring to an end the system of types and ceremonies that\nfor four thousand years had pointed to His death. As He ate the\nPassover with His disciples, He instituted in its place the service\nthat was to be the memorial of His great sacrifice. The national\nfestival of the Jews was to pass away forever. The service which\nChrist established was to be observed by His followers in all lands\nand through all ages.\nThe Passover was ordained as a commemoration of the deliver-\nance of Israel from Egyptian bondage. God had directed that, year\nby year, as the children should ask the meaning of this ordinance, the\nhistory should be repeated. Thus the wonderful deliverance was to\nbe kept fresh in the minds of all. The ordinance of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nwas given to commemorate the great deliverance wrought out as the[653]\nresult of the death of Christ. Till He shall come the second time in\npower and glory, this ordinance is to be celebrated. It is the means\nby which His great work for us is to be kept fresh in our minds.\nAt the time of their deliverance from Egypt, the children of Israel\nate the Passover supper standing, with their loins girded, and with\n572\n\u201cIn Remembrance of Me\u201d 573\ntheir staves in their hands, ready for their journey. The manner in\nwhich they celebrated this ordinance harmonized with their condi-\ntion; for they were about to be thrust out of the land of Egypt, and\nwere to begin a painful and difficult journey through the wilderness.\nBut in Christ\u2019s time the condition of things had changed. They were\nnot now about to be thrust out of a strange country, but were dwellers\nin their own land. In harmony with the rest that had been given them,\nthe people then partook of the Passover supper in a reclining posi-\ntion. Couches were placed about the table, and the guests lay upon\nthem, resting upon the left arm, and having the right hand free for\nuse in eating. In this position a guest could lay his head upon the\nbreast of the one who sat next above him. And the feet, being at the\nouter edge of the couch, could be washed by one passing around the\noutside of the circle.\nChrist is still at the table on which the paschal supper has been\nspread. The unleavened cakes used at the Passover season are before\nHim. The Passover wine, untouched by fermentation, is on the table.\nThese emblems Christ employs to represent His own unblemished\nsacrifice. Nothing corrupted by fermentation, the symbol of sin and\ndeath, could represent the \u201cLamb without blemish and without spot.\u201d\n1 Peter 1:19.\n\u201cAnd as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and\nbrake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My\nbody. And He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,\nsaying, Drink ye all of it; for this is My blood of the new testament,\nwhich is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto you,\nI will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day\nwhen I drink it new with you in My Father\u2019s kingdom.\u201d\nJudas the betrayer was present at the sacramental service. He\nreceived from Jesus the emblems of His broken body and His spilled\nblood. He heard the words, \u201cThis do in remembrance of Me.\u201d\nAnd sitting there in the very presence of the Lamb of God, the\nbetrayer brooded upon his own dark purposes, and cherished his\nsullen, revengeful thoughts.\nAt the feet washing, Christ had given convincing proof that He\nunderstood the character of Judas. \u201cYe are not all clean\u201d (John\n13:11), He said. These words convinced the false disciple that Christ [654]\nread his secret purpose. Now Christ spoke out more plainly. As\n574 The Desire of Ages\nthey were seated at the table He said, looking upon His disciples,\n\u201cI speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the\nscripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with Me hath lifted\nup his heel against Me.\u201d\nEven now the disciples did not suspect Judas. But they saw that\nChrist appeared greatly troubled. A cloud settled over them all, a\npremonition of some dreadful calamity, the nature of which they did\nnot understand. As they ate in silence, Jesus said, \u201cVerily I say unto\nyou, that one of you shall betray Me.\u201d At these words amazement and\nconsternation seized them. They could not comprehend how any one\nof them could deal treacherously with their divine Teacher. For what\ncause could they betray Him? and to whom? Whose heart could\ngive birth to such a design? Surely not one of the favored twelve,\nwho had been privileged above all others to hear His teachings, who\nhad shared His wonderful love, and for whom He had shown such\ngreat regard by bringing them into close communion with Himself!\nAs they realized the import of His words, and remembered how\ntrue His sayings were, fear and self-distrust seized them. They\nbegan to search their own hearts to see if one thought against their\nMaster were harbored there. With the most painful emotion, one\nafter another inquired, \u201cLord, is it I?\u201d But Judas sat silent. John in\ndeep distress at last inquired, \u201cLord, who is it?\u201d And Jesus answered,\n\u201cHe that dippeth his hand with Me in the dish, the same shall betray\nMe. The Son of man goeth as it is written of Him: but woe unto\nthat man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good\nfor that man if he had not been born.\u201d The disciples had searched\none another\u2019s faces closely as they asked, \u201cLord, is it I?\u201d And now\nthe silence of Judas drew all eyes to him. Amid the confusion of\nquestions and expressions of astonishment, Judas had not heard the\nwords of Jesus in answer to John\u2019s question. But now, to escape the\nscrutiny of the disciples, he asked as they had done, \u201cMaster, is it\nI?\u201d Jesus solemnly replied, \u201cThou hast said.\u201d\nIn surprise and confusion at the exposure of his purpose, Judas\nrose hastily to leave the room. \u201cThen said Jesus unto him, That\nthou doest, do quickly.... He then having received the sop went\nimmediately out: and it was night.\u201d Night it was to the traitor as he\nturned away from Christ into the outer darkness.\n\u201cIn Remembrance of Me\u201d 575\nUntil this step was taken, Judas had not passed beyond the pos-\nsibility of repentance. But when he left the presence of his Lord\nand his fellow disciples, the final decision had been made. He had [655]\npassed the boundary line.\nWonderful had been the long-suffering of Jesus in His dealing\nwith this tempted soul. Nothing that could be done to save Judas\nhad been left undone. After he had twice covenanted to betray his\nLord, Jesus still gave him opportunity for repentance. By reading\nthe secret purpose of the traitor\u2019s heart, Christ gave to Judas the final,\nconvincing evidence of His divinity. This was to the false disciple\nthe last call to repentance. No appeal that the divine-human heart\nof Christ could make had been spared. The waves of mercy, beaten\nback by stubborn pride, returned in a stronger tide of subduing love.\nBut although surprised and alarmed at the discovery of his guilt,\nJudas became only the more determined. From the sacramental\nsupper he went out to complete the work of betrayal.\nIn pronouncing the woe upon Judas, Christ also had a purpose\nof mercy toward His disciples. He thus gave them the crowning\nevidence of His Messiahship. \u201cI tell you before it come,\u201d He said,\n\u201cthat, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I AM.\u201d Had Jesus\nremained silent, in apparent ignorance of what was to come upon\nHim, the disciples might have thought that their Master had not\ndivine foresight, and had been surprised and betrayed into the hands\nof the murderous mob. A year before, Jesus had told the disciples\nthat He had chosen twelve, and that one was a devil. Now His\nwords to Judas, showing that his treachery was fully known to his\nMaster, would strengthen the faith of Christ\u2019s true followers during\nHis humiliation. And when Judas should have come to his dreadful\nend, they would remember the woe that Jesus had pronounced upon\nthe betrayer.\nAnd the Saviour had still another purpose. He had not withheld\nHis ministry from him whom He knew to be a traitor. The disciples\ndid not understand His words when He said at the feet washing, \u201cYe\nare not all clean,\u201d nor yet when at the table He declared, \u201cHe that\neateth bread with Me hath lifted up his heel against Me.\u201d John 13:11,\n18. But afterward, when His meaning was made plain, they had\nsomething to consider as to the patience and mercy of God toward\nthe most grievously erring.\n576 The Desire of Ages\nThough Jesus knew Judas from the beginning, He washed his\nfeet. And the betrayer was privileged to unite with Christ in partaking\nof the sacrament. A long-suffering Saviour held out every induce-\nment for the sinner to receive Him, to repent, and to be cleansed from\nthe defilement of sin. This example is for us. When we suppose one\nto be in error and sin, we are not to divorce ourselves from him. By\nno careless separation are we to leave him a prey to temptation, or[656]\ndrive him upon Satan\u2019s battleground. This is not Christ\u2019s method. It\nwas because the disciples were erring and faulty that He washed their\nfeet, and all but one of the twelve were thus brought to repentance.\nChrist\u2019s example forbids exclusiveness at the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nIt is true that open sin excludes the guilty. This the Holy Spirit\nplainly teaches. 1 Corinthians 5:11. But beyond this none are to\npass judgment. God has not left it with men to say who shall present\nthemselves on these occasions. For who can read the heart? Who\ncan distinguish the tares from the wheat? \u201cLet a man examine\nhimself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.\u201d\nFor \u201cwhosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord,\nunworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.\u201d \u201cHe\nthat eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation\nto himself, not discerning the Lord\u2019s body.\u201d 1 Corinthians 11:28, 27,\n29.\nWhen believers assemble to celebrate the ordinances, there are\npresent messengers unseen by human eyes. There may be a Judas\nin the company, and if so, messengers from the prince of darkness\nare there, for they attend all who refuse to be controlled by the Holy\nSpirit. Heavenly angels also are present. These unseen visitants are\npresent on every such occasion. There may come into the company\npersons who are not in heart servants of truth and holiness, but who\nmay wish to take part in the service. They should not be forbidden.\nThere are witnesses present who were present when Jesus washed\nthe feet of the disciples and of Judas. More than human eyes beheld\nthe scene.\nChrist by the Holy Spirit is there to set the seal to His own\nordinance. He is there to convict and soften the heart. Not a look,\nnot a thought of contrition, escapes His notice. For the repentant,\nbrokenhearted one He is waiting. All things are ready for that soul\u2019s\n\u201cIn Remembrance of Me\u201d 577\nreception. He who washed the feet of Judas longs to wash every\nheart from the stain of sin.\nNone should exclude themselves from the Communion because\nsome who are unworthy may be present. Every disciple is called\nupon to participate publicly, and thus bear witness that he accepts\nChrist as a personal Saviour. It is at these, His own appointments,\nthat Christ meets His people, and energizes them by His presence.\nHearts and hands that are unworthy may even administer the ordi-\nnance, yet Christ is there to minister to His children. All who come\nwith their faith fixed upon Him will be greatly blessed. All who\nneglect these seasons of divine privilege will suffer loss. Of them it\nmay appropriately be said, \u201cYe are not all clean.\u201d\nIn partaking with His disciples of the bread and wine, Christ\npledged Himself to them as their Redeemer. He committed to them [657]\n[658]\n[659]\nthe new covenant, by which all who receive Him become children\nof God, and joint heirs with Christ. By this covenant every blessing\nthat heaven could bestow for this life and the life to come was theirs.\nThis covenant deed was to be ratified with the blood of Christ. And\nthe administration of the Sacrament was to keep before the disciples\nthe infinite sacrifice made for each of them individually as a part of\nthe great whole of fallen humanity.\nBut the Communion service was not to be a season of sorrowing.\nThis was not its purpose. As the Lord\u2019s disciples gather about His\ntable, they are not to remember and lament their shortcomings. They\nare not to dwell upon their past religious experience, whether that\nexperience has been elevating or depressing. They are not to recall\nthe differences between them and their brethren. The preparatory\nservice has embraced all this. The self-examination, the confession\nof sin, the reconciling of differences, has all been done. Now they\ncome to meet with Christ. They are not to stand in the shadow of\nthe cross, but in its saving light. They are to open the soul to the\nbright beams of the Sun of Righteousness. With hearts cleansed by\nChrist\u2019s most precious blood, in full consciousness of His presence,\nalthough unseen, they are to hear His words, \u201cPeace I leave with\nyou, My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto\nyou.\u201d John 14:27.\nOur Lord says, Under conviction of sin, remember that I died\nfor you. When oppressed and persecuted and afflicted for My sake\n578 The Desire of Ages\nand the gospel\u2019s, remember My love, so great that for you I gave My\nlife. When your duties appear stern and severe, and your burdens\ntoo heavy to bear, remember that for your sake I endured the cross,\ndespising the shame. When your heart shrinks from the trying ordeal,\nremember that your Redeemer liveth to make intercession for you.\nThe Communion service points to Christ\u2019s second coming. It\nwas designed to keep this hope vivid in the minds of the disciples.\nWhenever they met together to commemorate His death, they re-\ncounted how \u201cHe took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,\nsaying, Drink ye all of it; for this is My blood of the new testament,\nwhich is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto\nyou, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that\nday when I drink it new with you in My Father\u2019s kingdom.\u201d In their\ntribulation they found comfort in the hope of their Lord\u2019s return.\nUnspeakably precious to them was the thought, \u201cAs often as ye eat\nthis bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord\u2019s death till He\ncome.\u201d 1 Corinthians 11:26.\nThese are the things we are never to forget. The love of Jesus,[660]\nwith its constraining power, is to be kept fresh in our memory. Christ\nhas instituted this service that it may speak to our senses of the love\nof God that has been expressed in our behalf. There can be no union\nbetween our souls and God except through Christ. The union and\nlove between brother and brother must be cemented and rendered\neternal by the love of Jesus. And nothing less than the death of\nChrist could make His love efficacious for us. It is only because\nof His death that we can look with joy to His second coming. His\nsacrifice is the center of our hope. Upon this we must fix our faith.\nThe ordinances that point to our Lord\u2019s humiliation and suffering\nare regarded too much as a form. They were instituted for a purpose.\nOur senses need to be quickened to lay hold of the mystery of\ngodliness. It is the privilege of all to comprehend, far more than\nwe do, the expiatory sufferings of Christ. \u201cAs Moses lifted up the\nserpent in the wilderness,\u201d even so has the Son of man been lifted\nup, \u201cthat whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have\neternal life.\u201d John 3:14, 15. To the cross of Calvary, bearing a dying\nSaviour, we must look. Our eternal interests demand that we show\nfaith in Christ.\n\u201cIn Remembrance of Me\u201d 579\nOur Lord has said, \u201cExcept ye eat the flesh of the Son of man,\nand drink His blood, ye have no life in you.... For My flesh is meat\nindeed, and My blood is drink indeed.\u201d John 6:53-55. This is true\nof our physical nature. To the death of Christ we owe even this\nearthly life. The bread we eat is the purchase of His broken body.\nThe water we drink is bought by His spilled blood. Never one, saint\nor sinner, eats his daily food, but he is nourished by the body and\nthe blood of Christ. The cross of Calvary is stamped on every loaf.\nIt is reflected in every water spring. All this Christ has taught in\nappointing the emblems of His great sacrifice. The light shining\nfrom that Communion service in the upper chamber makes sacred\nthe provisions for our daily life. The family board becomes as the\ntable of the Lord, and every meal a sacrament.\nAnd how much more are Christ\u2019s words true of our spiritual\nnature. He declares, \u201cWhoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My\nblood, hath eternal life.\u201d It is by receiving the life for us poured out\non Calvary\u2019s cross, that we can live the life of holiness. And this life\nwe receive by receiving His word, by doing those things which He\nhas commanded. Thus we become one with Him. \u201cHe that eateth\nMy flesh,\u201d He says, \u201cand drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I\nin him. As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father: [661]\nso he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me.\u201d John 6:54, 56, 57.\nTo the holy Communion this scripture in a special sense applies. As\nfaith contemplates our Lord\u2019s great sacrifice, the soul assimilates the\nspiritual life of Christ. That soul will receive spiritual strength from\nevery Communion. The service forms a living connection by which\nthe believer is bound up with Christ, and thus bound up with the\nFather. In a special sense it forms a connection between dependent\nhuman beings and God.\nAs we receive the bread and wine symbolizing Christ\u2019s broken\nbody and spilled blood, we in imagination join in the scene of\nCommunion in the upper chamber. We seem to be passing through\nthe garden consecrated by the agony of Him who bore the sins of\nthe world. We witness the struggle by which our reconciliation with\nGod was obtained. Christ is set forth crucified among us.\nLooking upon the crucified Redeemer, we more fully com-\nprehend the magnitude and meaning of the sacrifice made by the\nMajesty of heaven. The plan of salvation is glorified before us, and\n580 The Desire of Ages\nthe thought of Calvary awakens living and sacred emotions in our\nhearts. Praise to God and the Lamb will be in our hearts and on our\nlips; for pride and self-worship cannot flourish in the soul that keeps\nfresh in memory the scenes of Calvary.\nHe who beholds the Saviour\u2019s matchless love will be elevated in\nthought, purified in heart, transformed in character. He will go forth\nto be a light to the world, to reflect in some degree this mysterious\nlove. The more we contemplate the cross of Christ, the more fully\nshall we adopt the language of the apostle when he said, \u201cGod\nforbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,\nby whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.\u201d\nGalatians 6:14.\nChapter 73\u2014\u201cLet Not Your Heart Be Troubled\u201d [662]\nThis chapter is based on John 13:31-38; John 14; John 15; John 16;\nJohn 17.\nLooking upon His disciples with divine love and with the tender-\nest sympathy, Christ said, \u201cNow is the Son of man glorified, and God\nis glorified in Him.\u201d Judas had left the upper chamber, and Christ\nwas alone with the eleven. He was about to speak of His approaching\nseparation from them; but before doing this He pointed to the great\nobject of His mission. It was this that He kept ever before Him. It\nwas His joy that all His humiliation and suffering would glorify the\nFather\u2019s name. To this He first directs the thoughts of His disciples.\nThen addressing them by the endearing term, \u201cLittle children,\u201d\nHe said, \u201cYet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek Me: and as\nI said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to\nyou.\u201d\nThe disciples could not rejoice when they heard this. Fear fell\nupon them. They pressed close about the Saviour. Their Master and\nLord, their beloved Teacher and Friend, He was dearer to them than\nlife. To Him they had looked for help in all their difficulties, for\ncomfort in their sorrows and disappointments. Now He was to leave\nthem, a lonely, dependent company. Dark were the forebodings that\nfilled their hearts.\nBut the Saviour\u2019s words to them were full of hope. He knew\nthat they were to be assailed by the enemy, and that Satan\u2019s craft\nis most successful against those who are depressed by difficulties.\nTherefore He pointed them away from \u201cthe things which are seen,\u201d\nto \u201cthe things which are not seen.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:18. From earthly\nexile He turned their thoughts to the heavenly home.\n\u201cLet not your heart be troubled,\u201d He said; \u201cye believe in God, [663]\nbelieve also in Me. In My Father\u2019s house are many mansions: if\nit were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for\nyou. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,\n581\n582 The Desire of Ages\nand receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.\nAnd whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.\u201d For your sake\nI came into the world. I am working in your behalf. When I go\naway, I shall still work earnestly for you. I came into the world to\nreveal Myself to you, that you might believe. I go to the Father to\nco-operate with Him in your behalf. The object of Christ\u2019s departure\nwas the opposite of what the disciples feared. It did not mean a final\nseparation. He was going to prepare a place for them, that He might\ncome again, and receive them unto Himself. While He was building\nmansions for them, they were to build characters after the divine\nsimilitude.\nStill the disciples were perplexed. Thomas, always troubled by\ndoubts, said, \u201cLord, we know not whither Thou goest; and how can\nwe know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and\nthe life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me. If ye had known\nMe, ye should have known My Father also: and from henceforth ye\nknow Him, and have seen Him.\u201d\nThere are not many ways to heaven. Each one may not choose\nhis own way. Christ says, \u201cI am the way: ... no man cometh unto the\nFather, but by Me.\u201d Since the first gospel sermon was preached, when\nin Eden it was declared that the seed of the woman should bruise the\nserpent\u2019s head, Christ had been uplifted as the way, the truth, and the\nlife. He was the way when Adam lived, when Abel presented to God\nthe blood of the slain lamb, representing the blood of the Redeemer.\nChrist was the way by which patriarchs and prophets were saved.\nHe is the way by which alone we can have access to God.\n\u201cIf ye had known Me,\u201d Christ said, \u201cye should have known My\nFather also: and from henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him.\u201d\nBut not yet did the disciples understand. \u201cLord, show us the Father,\u201d\nexclaimed Philip, \u201cand it sufficeth us.\u201d\nAmazed at his dullness of comprehension, Christ asked with\npained surprise, \u201cHave I been so long time with you, and yet hast\nthou not known Me, Philip?\u201d Is it possible that you do not see the\nFather in the works He does through Me? Do you not believe that I\ncame to testify of the Father? \u201cHow sayest thou then, Show us the\nFather?\u201d \u201cHe that hath seen Me hath seen the Father.\u201d Christ had not\nceased to be God when He became man. Though He had humbled[664]\nHimself to humanity, the Godhead was still His own. Christ alone\n\u201cLet Not Your Heart Be Troubled\u201d 583\ncould represent the Father to humanity, and this representation the\ndisciples had been privileged to behold for over three years.\n\u201cBelieve Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me: or\nelse believe Me for the very works\u2019 sake.\u201d Their faith might safely\nrest on the evidence given in Christ\u2019s works, works that no man, of\nhimself, ever had done, or ever could do. Christ\u2019s work testified to\nHis divinity. Through Him the Father had been revealed.\nIf the disciples believed this vital connection between the Fa-\nther and the Son, their faith would not forsake them when they saw\nChrist\u2019s suffering and death to save a perishing world. Christ was\nseeking to lead them from their low condition of faith to the experi-\nence they might receive if they truly realized what He was,\u2014God in\nhuman flesh. He desired them to see that their faith must lead up to\nGod, and be anchored there. How earnestly and perseveringly our\ncompassionate Saviour sought to prepare His disciples for the storm\nof temptation that was soon to beat upon them. He would have them\nhid with Him in God.\nAs Christ was speaking these words, the glory of God was shin-\ning from His countenance, and all present felt a sacred awe as they\nlistened with rapt attention to His words. Their hearts were more\ndecidedly drawn to Him; and as they were drawn to Christ in greater\nlove, they were drawn to one another. They felt that heaven was\nvery near, and that the words to which they listened were a message\nto them from their heavenly Father.\n\u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you,\u201d Christ continued, \u201cHe that be-\nlieveth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also.\u201d The Saviour was\ndeeply anxious for His disciples to understand for what purpose His\ndivinity was united to humanity. He came to the world to display\nthe glory of God, that man might be uplifted by its restoring power.\nGod was manifested in Him that He might be manifested in them.\nJesus revealed no qualities, and exercised no powers, that men may\nnot have through faith in Him. His perfect humanity is that which\nall His followers may possess, if they will be in subjection to God\nas He was.\n\u201cAnd greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto\nMy Father.\u201d By this Christ did not mean that the disciples\u2019 work\nwould be of a more exalted character than His, but that it would have\n584 The Desire of Ages\ngreater extent. He did not refer merely to miracle working, but to all\nthat would take place under the working of the Holy Spirit.\nAfter the Lord\u2019s ascension, the disciples realized the fulfillment[665]\n[666]\n[667]\nof His promise. The scenes of the crucifixion, resurrection, and\nascension of Christ were a living reality to them. They saw that the\nprophecies had been literally fulfilled. They searched the Scriptures,\nand accepted their teaching with a faith and assurance unknown\nbefore. They knew that the divine Teacher was all that He had\nclaimed to be. As they told their experience, and exalted the love of\nGod, men\u2019s hearts were melted and subdued, and multitudes believed\non Jesus.\nThe Saviour\u2019s promise to His disciples is a promise to His church\nto the end of time. God did not design that His wonderful plan to\nredeem men should achieve only insignificant results. All who will\ngo to work, trusting not in what they themselves can do, but in\nwhat God can do for and through them, will certainly realize the\nfulfillment of His promise. \u201cGreater works than these shall ye do,\u201d\nHe declares; \u201cbecause I go unto My Father.\u201d\nAs yet the disciples were unacquainted with the Saviour\u2019s unlim-\nited resources and power. He said to them, \u201cHitherto have ye asked\nnothing in My name.\u201d John 16:24. He explained that the secret of\ntheir success would be in asking for strength and grace in His name.\nHe would be present before the Father to make request for them.\nThe prayer of the humble suppliant He presents as His own desire in\nthat soul\u2019s behalf. Every sincere prayer is heard in heaven. It may\nnot be fluently expressed; but if the heart is in it, it will ascend to the\nsanctuary where Jesus ministers, and He will present it to the Father\nwithout one awkward, stammering word, beautiful and fragrant with\nthe incense of His own perfection.\nThe path of sincerity and integrity is not a path free from obstruc-\ntion, but in every difficulty we are to see a call to prayer. There is\nno one living who has any power that he has not received from God,\nand the source whence it comes is open to the weakest human being.\n\u201cWhatsoever ye shall ask in My name,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cthat will I do,\nthat the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything\nin My name, I will do it.\u201d\n\u201cIn My name,\u201d Christ bade His disciples pray. In Christ\u2019s name\nHis followers are to stand before God. Through the value of the sac-\n\u201cLet Not Your Heart Be Troubled\u201d 585\nrifice made for them, they are of value in the Lord\u2019s sight. Because\nof the imputed righteousness of Christ they are accounted precious.\nFor Christ\u2019s sake the Lord pardons those that fear Him. He does not\nsee in them the vileness of the sinner. He recognizes in them the\nlikeness of His Son, in whom they believe.\nThe Lord is disappointed when His people place a low estimate [668]\nupon themselves. He desires His chosen heritage to value themselves\naccording to the price He has placed upon them. God wanted them,\nelse He would not have sent His Son on such an expensive errand\nto redeem them. He has a use for them, and He is well pleased\nwhen they make the very highest demands upon Him, that they may\nglorify His name. They may expect large things if they have faith in\nHis promises.\nBut to pray in Christ\u2019s name means much. It means that we are\nto accept His character, manifest His spirit, and work His works.\nThe Saviour\u2019s promise is given on condition. \u201cIf ye love Me,\u201d He\nsays, \u201ckeep My commandments.\u201d He saves men, not in sin, but from\nsin; and those who love Him will show their love by obedience.\nAll true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart work with\nChrist. And if we consent, He will so identify Himself with our\nthoughts and aims, so blend our hearts and minds into conformity to\nHis will, that when obeying Him we shall be but carrying out our\nown impulses. The will, refined and sanctified, will find its highest\ndelight in doing His service. When we know God as it is our privilege\nto know Him, our life will be a life of continual obedience. Through\nan appreciation of the character of Christ, through communion with\nGod, sin will become hateful to us.\nAs Christ lived the law in humanity, so we may do if we will\ntake hold of the Strong for strength. But we are not to place the\nresponsibility of our duty upon others, and wait for them to tell us\nwhat to do. We cannot depend for counsel upon humanity. The Lord\nwill teach us our duty just as willingly as He will teach somebody\nelse. If we come to Him in faith, He will speak His mysteries to us\npersonally. Our hearts will often burn within us as One draws nigh\nto commune with us as He did with Enoch. Those who decide to\ndo nothing in any line that will displease God, will know, after pre-\nsenting their case before Him, just what course to pursue. And they\nwill receive not only wisdom, but strength. Power for obedience, for\n586 The Desire of Ages\nservice, will be imparted to them, as Christ has promised. Whatever\nwas given to Christ\u2014the \u201call things\u201d to supply the need of fallen\nmen\u2014was given to Him as the head and representative of humanity.\nAnd \u201cwhatsoever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His\ncommandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.\u201d\n1 John 3:22.\nBefore offering Himself as the sacrificial victim, Christ sought\nfor the most essential and complete gift to bestow upon His followers,\na gift that would bring within their reach the boundless resources[669]\nof grace. \u201cI will pray the Father,\u201d He said, \u201cand He shall give you\nanother Comforter, that He may abide with you forever; even the\nSpirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him\nnot, neither knoweth Him: but ye know Him; for He dwelleth with\nyou, and shall be in you. I will not leave you orphans: I will come\nto you.\u201d John 14:16-18, margin.\nBefore this the Spirit had been in the world; from the very\nbeginning of the work of redemption He had been moving upon\nmen\u2019s hearts. But while Christ was on earth, the disciples had desired\nno other helper. Not until they were deprived of His presence would\nthey feel their need of the Spirit, and then He would come.\nThe Holy Spirit is Christ\u2019s representative, but divested of the\npersonality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered with\nhumanity, Christ could not be in every place personally. Therefore\nit was for their interest that He should go to the Father, and send\nthe Spirit to be His successor on earth. No one could then have any\nadvantage because of his location or his personal contact with Christ.\nBy the Spirit the Saviour would be accessible to all. In this sense\nHe would be nearer to them than if He had not ascended on high.\n\u201cHe that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love\nhim, and will manifest Myself to him.\u201d Jesus read the future of His\ndisciples. He saw one brought to the scaffold, one to the cross, one\nto exile among the lonely rocks of the sea, others to persecution and\ndeath. He encouraged them with the promise that in every trial He\nwould be with them. That promise has lost none of its force. The\nLord knows all about His faithful servants who for His sake are lying\nin prison or who are banished to lonely islands. He comforts them\nwith His own presence. When for the truth\u2019s sake the believer stands\nat the bar of unrighteous tribunals, Christ stands by his side. All the\n\u201cLet Not Your Heart Be Troubled\u201d 587\nreproaches that fall upon him, fall upon Christ. Christ is condemned\nover again in the person of His disciple. When one is incarcerated\nin prison walls, Christ ravishes the heart with His love. When one\nsuffers death for His sake, Christ says, \u201cI am He that liveth, and was\ndead; and, behold, I am alive forevermore, ... and have the keys of\nhell and of death.\u201d Revelation 1:18. The life that is sacrificed for Me\nis preserved unto eternal glory.\nAt all times and in all places, in all sorrows and in all afflictions,\nwhen the outlook seems dark and the future perplexing, and we feel\nhelpless and alone, the Comforter will be sent in answer to the prayer\nof faith. Circumstances may separate us from every earthly friend; [670]\nbut no circumstance, no distance, can separate us from the heavenly\nComforter. Wherever we are, wherever we may go, He is always at\nour right hand to support, sustain, uphold, and cheer.\nThe disciples still failed to understand Christ\u2019s words in their\nspiritual sense, and again He explained His meaning. By the Spirit,\nHe said, He would manifest Himself to them. \u201cThe Comforter, which\nis the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall\nteach you all things.\u201d No more will you say, I cannot comprehend.\nNo longer will you see through a glass, darkly. You shall \u201cbe able\nto comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and\ndepth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth\nknowledge.\u201d Ephesians 3:18, 19.\nThe disciples were to bear witness to the life and work of Christ.\nThrough their word He was to speak to all the people on the face of\nthe earth. But in the humiliation and death of Christ they were to\nsuffer great trial and disappointment. That after this experience their\nword might be accurate, Jesus promised that the Comforter should\n\u201cbring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cI have yet many things to say unto you,\u201d He continued, \u201cbut ye\ncannot bear them now. Howbeit when He, the Spirit of truth, is come,\nHe will guide you into all truth: for He shall not speak of Himself; but\nwhatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak: and He will show you\nthings to come. He shall glorify Me: for He shall receive of Mine,\nand shall show it unto you.\u201d Jesus had opened before His disciples\na vast tract of truth. But it was most difficult for them to keep His\nlessons distinct from the traditions and maxims of the scribes and\n588 The Desire of Ages\nPharisees. They had been educated to accept the teaching of the\nrabbis as the voice of God, and it still held a power over their minds,\nand molded their sentiments. Earthly ideas, temporal things, still had\na large place in their thoughts. They did not understand the spiritual\nnature of Christ\u2019s kingdom, though He had so often explained it to\nthem. Their minds had become confused. They did not comprehend\nthe value of the scriptures Christ presented. Many of His lessons\nseemed almost lost upon them. Jesus saw that they did not lay hold\nof the real meaning of His words. He compassionately promised\nthat the Holy Spirit should recall these sayings to their minds. And\nHe had left unsaid many things that could not be comprehended by\nthe disciples. These also would be opened to them by the Spirit. The\nSpirit was to quicken their understanding, that they might have an[671]\nappreciation of heavenly things. \u201cWhen He, the Spirit of truth, is\ncome,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cHe will guide you into all truth.\u201d\nThe Comforter is called \u201cthe Spirit of truth.\u201d His work is to\ndefine and maintain the truth. He first dwells in the heart as the\nSpirit of truth, and thus He becomes the Comforter. There is comfort\nand peace in the truth, but no real peace or comfort can be found\nin falsehood. It is through false theories and traditions that Satan\ngains his power over the mind. By directing men to false standards,\nhe misshapes the character. Through the Scriptures the Holy Spirit\nspeaks to the mind, and impresses truth upon the heart. Thus He\nexposes error, and expels it from the soul. It is by the Spirit of truth,\nworking through the word of God, that Christ subdues His chosen\npeople to Himself.\nIn describing to His disciples the office work of the Holy Spirit,\nJesus sought to inspire them with the joy and hope that inspired\nHis own heart. He rejoiced because of the abundant help He had\nprovided for His church. The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts\nthat He could solicit from His Father for the exaltation of His people.\nThe Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and without this\nthe sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail. The power of\nevil had been strengthening for centuries, and the submission of\nmen to this satanic captivity was amazing. Sin could be resisted and\novercome only through the mighty agency of the Third Person of\nthe Godhead, who would come with no modified energy, but in the\nfullness of divine power. It is the Spirit that makes effectual what\n\u201cLet Not Your Heart Be Troubled\u201d 589\nhas been wrought out by the world\u2019s Redeemer. It is by the Spirit\nthat the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes\na partaker of the divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine\npower to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil,\nand to impress His own character upon His church.\nOf the Spirit Jesus said, \u201cHe shall glorify Me.\u201d The Saviour came\nto glorify the Father by the demonstration of His love; so the Spirit\nwas to glorify Christ by revealing His grace to the world. The very\nimage of God is to be reproduced in humanity. The honor of God,\nthe honor of Christ, is involved in the perfection of the character of\nHis people.\n\u201cWhen He [the Spirit of truth] is come, He will reprove the\nworld of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.\u201d The preaching\nof the word will be of no avail without the continual presence and\naid of the Holy Spirit. This is the only effectual teacher of divine\ntruth. Only when the truth is accompanied to the heart by the Spirit [672]\nwill it quicken the conscience or transform the life. One might be\nable to present the letter of the word of God, he might be familiar\nwith all its commands and promises; but unless the Holy Spirit sets\nhome the truth, no souls will fall on the Rock and be broken. No\namount of education, no advantages, however great, can make one a\nchannel of light without the co-operation of the Spirit of God. The\nsowing of the gospel seed will not be a success unless the seed is\nquickened into life by the dew of heaven. Before one book of the\nNew Testament was written, before one gospel sermon had been\npreached after Christ\u2019s ascension, the Holy Spirit came upon the\npraying apostles. Then the testimony of their enemies was, \u201cYe have\nfilled Jerusalem with your doctrine.\u201d Acts 5:28.\nChrist has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church,\nand the promise belongs to us as much as to the first disciples. But\nlike every other promise, it is given on conditions. There are many\nwho believe and profess to claim the Lord\u2019s promise; they talkabout\nChrist and about the Holy Spirit, yet receive no benefit. They do not\nsurrender the soul to be guided and controlled by the divine agencies.\nWe cannot use the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is to use us. Through\nthe Spirit God works in His people \u201cto will and to do of His good\npleasure.\u201d Philippians 2:13. But many will not submit to this. They\nwant to manage themselves. This is why they do not receive the\n590 The Desire of Ages\nheavenly gift. Only to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch\nfor His guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. The power of God\nawaits their demand and reception. This promised blessing, claimed\nby faith, brings all other blessings in its train. It is given according\nto the riches of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply every\nsoul according to the capacity to receive.\nIn His discourse to the disciples, Jesus made no mournful allu-\nsion to His own sufferings and death. His last legacy to them was a\nlegacy of peace. He said, \u201cPeace I leave with you, My peace I give\nunto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart\nbe troubled, neither let it be afraid.\u201d\nBefore leaving the upper chamber, the Saviour led His disciples\nin a song of praise. His voice was heard, not in the strains of some\nmournful lament, but in the joyful notes of the Passover hallel:\n\u201cO praise the Lord, all ye nations:\nPraise Him, all ye people.\nFor His merciful kindness is great toward us:\nAnd the truth of the Lord endureth forever.\nPraise ye the Lord.\u201d Psalm 117.\nAfter the hymn, they went out. Through the crowded streets they[673]\nmade their way, passing out of the city gate toward the Mount of\nOlives. Slowly they proceeded, each busy with his own thoughts.\nAs they began to descend toward the mount, Jesus said, in a tone of\ndeepest sadness, \u201cAll ye shall be offended because of Me this night:\nfor it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock\nshall be scattered abroad.\u201d Matthew 26:31. The disciples listened in\nsorrow and amazement. They remembered how in the synagogue\nat Capernaum, when Christ spoke of Himself as the bread of life,\nmany had been offended, and had turned away from Him. But the\ntwelve had not shown themselves unfaithful. Peter, speaking for his\nbrethren, had then declared his loyalty to Christ. Then the Saviour\nhad said, \u201cHave not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?\u201d\nJohn 6:70. In the upper chamber Jesus said that one of the twelve\nwould betray Him, and that Peter would deny Him. But now His\nwords include them all.\n\u201cLet Not Your Heart Be Troubled\u201d 591\nNow Peter\u2019s voice is heard vehemently protesting, \u201cAlthough\nall shall be offended, yet will not I.\u201d In the upper chamber he had\ndeclared, \u201cI will lay down my life for Thy sake.\u201d Jesus had warned\nhim that he would that very night deny his Saviour. Now Christ\nrepeats the warning: \u201cVerily I say unto thee, That this day, even in\nthis night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny Me thrice.\u201d\nBut Peter only \u201cspake the more vehemently, If I should die with\nThee, I will not deny Thee in anywise. Likewise also said they all.\u201d\nMark 14:29, 30, 31. In their self-confidence they denied the repeated\nstatement of Him who knew. They were unprepared for the test;\nwhen temptation should overtake them, they would understand their\nown weakness.\nWhen Peter said he would follow his Lord to prison and to\ndeath, he meant it, every word of it; but he did not know himself.\nHidden in his heart were elements of evil that circumstances would\nfan into life. Unless he was made conscious of his danger, these\nwould prove his eternal ruin. The Saviour saw in him a self-love\nand assurance that would overbear even his love for Christ. Much\nof infirmity, of unmortified sin, carelessness of spirit, unsanctified\ntemper, heedlessness in entering into temptation, had been revealed\nin his experience. Christ\u2019s solemn warning was a call to heart\nsearching. Peter needed to distrust himself, and to have a deeper\nfaith in Christ. Had he in humility received the warning, he would\nhave appealed to the Shepherd of the flock to keep His sheep. When\non the Sea of Galilee he was about to sink, he cried, \u201cLord, save me.\u201d\nMatthew 14:30. Then the hand of Christ was outstretched to grasp [674]\nhis hand. So now if he had cried to Jesus, Save me from myself,\nhe would have been kept. But Peter felt that he was distrusted, and\nhe thought it cruel. He was already offended, and he became more\npersistent in his self-confidence.\nJesus looks with compassion on His disciples. He cannot save\nthem from the trial, but He does not leave them comfortless. He\nassures them that He is to break the fetters of the tomb, and that His\nlove for them will not fail. \u201cAfter I am risen again,\u201d He says, \u201cI will\ngo before you into Galilee.\u201d Matthew 26:32. Before the denial, they\nhave the assurance of forgiveness. After His death and resurrection,\nthey knew that they were forgiven, and were dear to the heart of\nChrist.\n592 The Desire of Ages\nJesus and the disciples were on the way to Gethsemane, at the\nfoot of Mount Olivet, a retired spot which He had often visited for\nmeditation and prayer. The Saviour had been explaining to His\ndisciples His mission to the world, and the spiritual relation to Him\nwhich they were to sustain. Now He illustrates the lesson. The\nmoon is shining bright, and reveals to Him a flourishing grapevine.\nDrawing the attention of the disciples to it, He employs it as a\nsymbol.\n\u201cI am the true Vine,\u201d He says. Instead of choosing the graceful\npalm, the lofty cedar, or the strong oak, Jesus takes the vine with\nits clinging tendrils to represent Himself. The palm tree, the cedar,\nand the oak stand alone. They require no support. But the vine\nentwines about the trellis, and thus climbs heavenward. So Christ\nin His humanity was dependent upon divine power. \u201cI can of Mine[675]\nown self do nothing,\u201d He declared. John 5:30.\n\u201cI am the true Vine.\u201d The Jews had always regarded the vine\nas the most noble of plants, and a type of all that was powerful,\nexcellent, and fruitful. Israel had been represented as a vine which\nGod had planted in the Promised Land. The Jews based their hope\nof salvation on the fact of their connection with Israel. But Jesus\nsays, I am the real Vine. Think not that through a connection with\nIsrael you may become partakers of the life of God, and inheritors\nof His promise. Through Me alone is spiritual life received.\n\u201cI am the true Vine, and My Father is the husbandman.\u201d On the\nhills of Palestine our heavenly Father had planted this goodly Vine,\nand He Himself was the husbandman. Many were attracted by the\nbeauty of this Vine, and declared its heavenly origin. But to the\nleaders in Israel it appeared as a root out of a dry ground. They\ntook the plant, and bruised it, and trampled it under their unholy\nfeet. Their thought was to destroy it forever. But the heavenly\nHusbandman never lost sight of His plant. After men thought they\nhad killed it, He took it, and replanted it on the other side of the wall.\nThe vine stock was to be no longer visible. It was hidden from the\nrude assaults of men. But the branches of the Vine hung over the\nwall. They were to represent the Vine. Through them grafts might\nstill be united to the Vine. From them fruit has been obtained. There\nhas been a harvest which the passers-by have plucked.\n\u201cLet Not Your Heart Be Troubled\u201d 593\n\u201cI am the Vine, ye are the branches,\u201d Christ said to His disciples.\nThough He was about to be removed from them, their spiritual union\nwith Him was to be unchanged. The connection of the branch with\nthe vine, He said, represents the relation you are to sustain to Me.\nThe scion is engrafted into the living vine, and fiber by fiber, vein by\nvein, it grows into the vine stock. The life of the vine becomes the\nlife of the branch. So the soul dead in trespasses and sins receives\nlife through connection with Christ. By faith in Him as a personal\nSaviour the union is formed. The sinner unites his weakness to\nChrist\u2019s strength, his emptiness to Christ\u2019s fullness, his frailty to\nChrist\u2019s enduring might. Then he has the mind of Christ. The\nhumanity of Christ has touched our humanity, and our humanity\nhas touched divinity. Thus through the agency of the Holy Spirit\nman becomes a partaker of the divine nature. He is accepted in the\nBeloved.\nThis union with Christ, once formed, must be maintained. Christ [676]\nsaid, \u201cAbide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit\nof itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye\nabide in Me.\u201d This is no casual touch, no off-and-on connection.\nThe branch becomes a part of the living vine. The communication\nof life, strength, and fruitfulness from the root to the branches is\nunobstructed and constant. Separated from the vine, the branch\ncannot live. No more, said Jesus, can you live apart from Me. The\nlife you have received from Me can be preserved only by continual\ncommunion. Without Me you cannot overcome one sin, or resist\none temptation.\n\u201cAbide in Me, and I in you.\u201d Abiding in Christ means a constant\nreceiving of His Spirit, a life of unreserved surrender to His service.\nThe channel of communication must be open continually between\nman and his God. As the vine branch constantly draws the sap from\nthe living vine, so are we to cling to Jesus, and receive from Him by\nfaith the strength and perfection of His own character.\nThe root sends its nourishment through the branch to the outer-\nmost twig. So Christ communicates the current of spiritual strength\nto every believer. So long as the soul is united to Christ, there is no\ndanger that it will wither or decay.\nThe life of the vine will be manifest in fragrant fruit on the\nbranches. \u201cHe that abideth in Me,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cand I in him, the\n594 The Desire of Ages\nsame bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing.\u201d\nWhen we live by faith on the Son of God, the fruits of the Spirit will\nbe seen in our lives; not one will be missing.\n\u201cMy Father is the husbandman. Every branch in Me that beareth\nnot fruit He taketh away.\u201d While the graft is outwardly united with\nthe vine, there may be no vital connection. Then there will be no\ngrowth or fruitfulness. So there may be an apparent connection\nwith Christ without a real union with Him by faith. A profession\nof religion places men in the church, but the character and conduct\nshow whether they are in connection with Christ. If they bear no\nfruit, they are false branches. Their separation from Christ involves\na ruin as complete as that represented by the dead branch. \u201cIf a man\nabide not in Me,\u201d said Christ, \u201che is cast forth as a branch, and is\nwithered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they\nare burned.\u201d\n\u201cAnd every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth [pruneth] it,\nthat it may bring forth more fruit.\u201d From the chosen twelve who had\nfollowed Jesus, one as a withered branch was about to be taken away;[677]\nthe rest were to pass under the pruning knife of bitter trial. Jesus\nwith solemn tenderness explained the purpose of the husbandman.\nThe pruning will cause pain, but it is the Father who applies the\nknife. He works with no wanton hand or indifferent heart. There\nare branches trailing upon the ground; these must be cut loose from\nthe earthly supports to which their tendrils are fastening. They are\nto reach heavenward, and find their support in God. The excessive\nfoliage that draws away the life current from the fruit must be pruned\noff. The overgrowth must be cut out, to give room for the healing\nbeams of the Sun of Righteousness. The husbandman prunes away\nthe harmful growth, that the fruit may be richer and more abundant.\n\u201cHerein is My Father glorified,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cthat ye bear much\nfruit.\u201d God desires to manifest through you the holiness, the benevo-\nlence, the compassion, of His own character. Yet the Saviour does\nnot bid the disciples labor to bear fruit. He tells them to abide in\nHim. \u201cIf ye abide in Me,\u201d He says, \u201cand My words abide in you, ye\nshall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\u201d It is through\nthe word that Christ abides in His followers. This is the same vital\nunion that is represented by eating His flesh and drinking His blood.\nThe words of Christ are spirit and life. Receiving them, you receive\n\u201cLet Not Your Heart Be Troubled\u201d 595\nthe life of the Vine. You live \u201cby every word that proceedeth out of\nthe mouth of God.\u201d Matthew 4:4. The life of Christ in you produces\nthe same fruits as in Him. Living in Christ, adhering to Christ,\nsupported by Christ, drawing nourishment from Christ, you bear\nfruit after the similitude of Christ.\nIn this last meeting with His disciples, the great desire which\nChrist expressed for them was that they might love one another as\nHe had loved them. Again and again He spoke of this. \u201cThese things\nI command you,\u201d He said repeatedly, \u201cthat ye love one another.\u201d His\nvery first injunction when alone with them in the upper chamber was,\n\u201cA new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as\nI have loved you, that ye also love one another.\u201d To the disciples this\ncommandment was new; for they had not loved one another as Christ\nhad loved them. He saw that new ideas and impulses must control\nthem; that new principles must be practiced by them; through His\nlife and death they were to receive a new conception of love. The\ncommand to love one another had a new meaning in the light of His\nself-sacrifice. The whole work of grace is one continual service of [678]\nlove, of self-denying, self-sacrificing effort. During every hour of\nChrist\u2019s sojourn upon the earth, the love of God was flowing from\nHim in irrepressible streams. All who are imbued with His Spirit\nwill love as He loved. The very principle that actuated Christ will\nactuate them in all their dealing one with another.\nThis love is the evidence of their discipleship. \u201cBy this shall all\nmen know that ye are My disciples,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cif ye have love\none to another.\u201d When men are bound together, not by force or self-\ninterest, but by love, they show the working of an influence that\nis above every human influence. Where this oneness exists, it is\nevidence that the image of God is being restored in humanity, that\na new principle of life has been implanted. It shows that there is\npower in the divine nature to withstand the supernatural agencies of\nevil, and that the grace of God subdues the selfishness inherent in\nthe natural heart.\nThis love, manifested in the church, will surely stir the wrath of\nSatan. Christ did not mark out for His disciples an easy path. \u201cIf\nthe world hate you,\u201d He said, \u201cye know that it hated Me before it\nhated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own:\nbut because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the\n596 The Desire of Ages\nworld, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I\nsaid unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have\npersecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept My\nsaying, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do\nunto you for My name\u2019s sake, because they know not Him that sent\nMe.\u201d The gospel is to be carried forward by aggressive warfare, in\nthe midst of opposition, peril, loss, and suffering. But those who do\nthis work are only following in their Master\u2019s steps.\nAs the world\u2019s Redeemer, Christ was constantly confronted with\napparent failure. He, the messenger of mercy to our world, seemed\nto do little of the work He longed to do in uplifting and saving.\nSatanic influences were constantly working to oppose His way. But\nHe would not be discouraged. Through the prophecy of Isaiah He\ndeclares, \u201cI have labored in vain, I have spent My strength for nought,\nand in vain: yet surely My judgment is with the Lord, and My work\nwith My God.... Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious\nin the eyes of the Lord, and My God shall be My strength.\u201d It is to\nChrist that the promise is given, \u201cThus saith the Lord, the Redeemer\nof Israel, and His Holy One, to Him whom man despiseth, to Him\nwhom the nation abhorreth; ... thus saith the Lord: ... I will preserve[679]\nThee, and give Thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the\nearth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages; that Thou mayest\nsay to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show\nyourselves.... They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat\nnor sun smite them: for He that hath mercy on them shall lead them,\neven by the springs of water shall He guide them.\u201d Isaiah 49:4, 5,\n7-10.\nUpon this word Jesus rested, and He gave Satan no advantage.\nWhen the last steps of Christ\u2019s humiliation were to be taken, when\nthe deepest sorrow was closing about His soul, He said to His dis-\nciples, \u201cThe prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in Me.\u201d\n\u201cThe prince of this world is judged.\u201d Now shall he be cast out. John\n14:30; 16:11; 12:31. With prophetic eye Christ traced the scenes to\ntake place in His last great conflict. He knew that when He should\nexclaim, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d all heaven would triumph. His ear caught\nthe distant music and the shouts of victory in the heavenly courts. He\nknew that the knell of Satan\u2019s empire would then be sounded, and the\n\u201cLet Not Your Heart Be Troubled\u201d 597\nname of Christ would be heralded from world to world throughout\nthe universe.\nChrist rejoiced that He could do more for His followers than\nthey could ask or think. He spoke with assurance, knowing that an\nalmighty decree had been given before the world was made. He knew\nthat truth, armed with the omnipotence of the Holy Spirit, would\nconquer in the contest with evil; and that the bloodstained banner\nwould wave triumphantly over His followers. He knew that the life\nof His trusting disciples would be like His, a series of uninterrupted\nvictories, not seen to be such here, but recognized as such in the\ngreat hereafter.\n\u201cThese things I have spoken unto you,\u201d He said, \u201cthat in Me ye\nmight have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of\ngood cheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d Christ did not fail, neither\nwas He discouraged, and His followers are to manifest a faith of the\nsame enduring nature. They are to live as He lived, and work as He\nworked, because they depend on Him as the great Master Worker.\nCourage, energy, and perseverance they must possess. Though\napparent impossibilities obstruct their way, by His grace they are to\ngo forward. Instead of deploring difficulties, they are called upon\nto surmount them. They are to despair of nothing, and to hope for\neverything. With the golden chain of His matchless love Christ has\nbound them to the throne of God. It is His purpose that the highest\ninfluence in the universe, emanating from the source of all power,\nshall be theirs. They are to have power to resist evil, power that [680]\nneither earth, nor death, nor hell can master, power that will enable\nthem to overcome as Christ overcame.\nChrist designs that heaven\u2019s order, heaven\u2019s plan of government,\nheaven\u2019s divine harmony, shall be represented in His church on\nearth. Thus in His people He is glorified. Through them the Sun of\nRighteousness will shine in undimmed luster to the world. Christ\nhas given to His church ample facilities, that He may receive a large\nrevenue of glory from His redeemed, purchased possession. He\nhas bestowed upon His people capabilities and blessings that they\nmay represent His own sufficiency. The church, endowed with the\nrighteousness of Christ, is His depositary, in which the riches of His\nmercy, His grace, and His love, are to appear in full and final display.\nChrist looks upon His people in their purity and perfection, as the\n598 The Desire of Ages\nreward of His humiliation, and the supplement of His glory,\u2014Christ,\nthe great Center, from whom radiates all glory.\nWith strong, hopeful words the Saviour ended His instruction.\nThen He poured out the burden of His soul in prayer for His disciples.\nLifting His eyes to heaven, He said, \u201cFather, the hour is come; glorify\nThy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee: as Thou hast given\nHim power over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to as many\nas Thou hast given Him. And this is life eternal, that they might\nknow Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast\nsent.\u201d\nChrist had finished the work that was given Him to do. He had\nglorified God on the earth. He had manifested the Father\u2019s name. He\nhad gathered out those who were to continue His work among men.\nAnd He said, \u201cI am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the\nworld, but these are in the world, and I come to Thee. Holy Father,\nkeep through Thine own name those whom Thou hast given Me,\nthat they may be one, as We are.\u201d \u201cNeither pray I for these alone,\nbut for them also which shall believe on Me through their word; that\nthey all may be one; ... I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be\nmade perfect in one; and that the world may know that Thou hast\nsent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.\u201d\nThus in the language of one who has divine authority, Christ\ngives His elect church into the Father\u2019s arms. As a consecrated\nhigh priest He intercedes for His people. As a faithful shepherd He\ngathers His flock under the shadow of the Almighty, in the strong\nand sure refuge. For Him there waits the last battle with Satan, and\nHe goes forth to meet it.\nChapter 74\u2014Gethsemane [681]\n[682]\n[683]\n[684]\n[685]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 26:36-56; Mark 14:32-50; Luke\n22:39-53; John 18:1-12.\nIn company with His disciples, the Saviour slowly made His way\nto the garden of Gethsemane. The Passover moon, broad and full,\nshone from a cloudless sky. The city of pilgrims\u2019 tents was hushed\ninto silence.\nJesus had been earnestly conversing with His disciples and in-\nstructing them; but as He neared Gethsemane, He became strangely\nsilent. He had often visited this spot for meditation and prayer; but\nnever with a heart so full of sorrow as upon this night of His last\nagony. Throughout His life on earth He had walked in the light of\nGod\u2019s presence. When in conflict with men who were inspired by\nthe very spirit of Satan, He could say, \u201cHe that sent Me is with Me:\nthe Father hath not left Me alone; for I do always those things that\nplease Him.\u201d John 8:29. But now He seemed to be shut out from the\nlight of God\u2019s sustaining presence. Now He was numbered with the\ntransgressors. The guilt of fallen humanity He must bear. Upon Him\nwho knew no sin must be laid the iniquity of us all. So dreadful does\nsin appear to Him, so great is the weight of guilt which He must\nbear, that He is tempted to fear it will shut Him out forever from\nHis Father\u2019s love. Feeling how terrible is the wrath of God against\ntransgression, He exclaims, \u201cMy soul is exceeding sorrowful, even\nunto death.\u201d\nAs they approached the garden, the disciples had marked the\nchange that came over their Master. Never before had they seen\nHim so utterly sad and silent. As He proceeded, this strange sadness [686]\ndeepened; yet they dared not question Him as to the cause. His\nform swayed as if He were about to fall. Upon reaching the garden,\nthe disciples looked anxiously for His usual place of retirement,\nthat their Master might rest. Every step that He now took was with\nlabored effort. He groaned aloud, as if suffering under the pressure\n599\n600 The Desire of Ages\nof a terrible burden. Twice His companions supported Him, or He\nwould have fallen to the earth.\nNear the entrance to the garden, Jesus left all but three of the\ndisciples, bidding them pray for themselves and for Him. With\nPeter, James, and John, He entered its secluded recesses. These\nthree disciples were Christ\u2019s closest companions. They had beheld\nHis glory on the mount of transfiguration; they had seen Moses\nand Elijah talking with Him; they had heard the voice from heaven;\nnow in His great struggle, Christ desired their presence near Him.\nOften they had passed the night with Him in this retreat. On these\noccasions, after a season of watching and prayer, they would sleep\nundisturbed at a little distance from their Master, until He awoke\nthem in the morning to go forth anew to labor. But now He desired\nthem to spend the night with Him in prayer. Yet He could not bear\nthat even they should witness the agony He was to endure.\n\u201cTarry ye here,\u201d He said, \u201cand watch with Me.\u201d\nHe went a little distance from them\u2014not so far but that they\ncould both see and hear Him\u2014and fell prostrate upon the ground.\nHe felt that by sin He was being separated from His Father. The gulf\nwas so broad, so black, so deep, that His spirit shuddered before it.\nThis agony He must not exert His divine power to escape. As man\nHe must suffer the consequences of man\u2019s sin. As man He must\nendure the wrath of God against transgression.\nChrist was now standing in a different attitude from that in which\nHe had ever stood before. His suffering can best be described in\nthe words of the prophet, \u201cAwake, O sword, against My shepherd,\nand against the man that is My fellow, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d\nZechariah 13:7. As the substitute and surety for sinful man, Christ\nwas suffering under divine justice. He saw what justice meant.\nHitherto He had been as an intercessor for others; now He longed to\nhave an intercessor for Himself.\nAs Christ felt His unity with the Father broken up, He feared\nthat in His human nature He would be unable to endure the coming\nconflict with the powers of darkness. In the wilderness of temptation\nthe destiny of the human race had been at stake. Christ was then\nconqueror. Now the tempter had come for the last fearful struggle.[687]\nFor this he had been preparing during the three years of Christ\u2019s\nministry. Everything was at stake with him. If he failed here, his\nGethsemane 601\nhope of mastery was lost; the kingdoms of the world would finally\nbecome Christ\u2019s; he himself would be overthrown and cast out.\nBut if Christ could be overcome, the earth would become Satan\u2019s\nkingdom, and the human race would be forever in his power. With\nthe issues of the conflict before Him, Christ\u2019s soul was filled with\ndread of separation from God. Satan told Him that if He became the\nsurety for a sinful world, the separation would be eternal. He would\nbe identified with Satan\u2019s kingdom, and would nevermore be one\nwith God.\nAnd what was to be gained by this sacrifice? How hopeless\nappeared the guilt and ingratitude of men! In its hardest features\nSatan pressed the situation upon the Redeemer: The people who\nclaim to be above all others in temporal and spiritual advantages\nhave rejected You. They are seeking to destroy You, the foundation,\nthe center and seal of the promises made to them as a peculiar people.\nOne of Your own disciples, who has listened to Your instruction, and\nhas been among the foremost in church activities, will betray You.\nOne of Your most zealous followers will deny You. All will forsake\nYou. Christ\u2019s whole being abhorred the thought. That those whom\nHe had undertaken to save, those whom He loved so much, should\nunite in the plots of Satan, this pierced His soul. The conflict was\nterrible. Its measure was the guilt of His nation, of His accusers and\nbetrayer, the guilt of a world lying in wickedness. The sins of men\nweighed heavily upon Christ, and the sense of God\u2019s wrath against\nsin was crushing out His life.\nBehold Him contemplating the price to be paid for the human\nsoul. In His agony He clings to the cold ground, as if to prevent\nHimself from being drawn farther from God. The chilling dew of\nnight falls upon His prostrate form, but He heeds it not. From His\npale lips comes the bitter cry, \u201cO My Father, if it be possible, let this\ncup pass from Me.\u201d Yet even now He adds, \u201cNevertheless not as I\nwill, but as Thou wilt.\u201d\nThe human heart longs for sympathy in suffering. This longing\nChrist felt to the very depths of His being. In the supreme agony\nof His soul He came to His disciples with a yearning desire to hear\nsome words of comfort from those whom He had so often blessed\nand comforted, and shielded in sorrow and distress. The One who\nhad always had words of sympathy for them was now suffering\n602 The Desire of Ages\nsuperhuman agony, and He longed to know that they were praying\nfor Him and for themselves. How dark seemed the malignity of[688]\nsin! Terrible was the temptation to let the human race bear the\nconsequences of its own guilt, while He stood innocent before God.\nIf He could only know that His disciples understood and appreciated\nthis, He would be strengthened.\nRising with painful effort, He staggered to the place where He\nhad left His companions. But He \u201cfindeth them asleep.\u201d Had He\nfound them praying, He would have been relieved. Had they been\nseeking refuge in God, that satanic agencies might not prevail over\nthem, He would have been comforted by their steadfast faith. But\nthey had not heeded the repeated warning, \u201cWatch and pray.\u201d At\nfirst they had been much troubled to see their Master, usually so\ncalm and dignified, wrestling with a sorrow that was beyond com-\nprehension. They had prayed as they heard the strong cries of the\nsufferer. They did not intend to forsake their Lord, but they seemed\nparalyzed by a stupor which they might have shaken off if they had\ncontinued pleading with God. They did not realize the necessity of\nwatchfulness and earnest prayer in order to withstand temptation.\nJust before He bent His footsteps to the garden, Jesus had said\nto the disciples, \u201cAll ye shall be offended because of Me this night.\u201d\nThey had given Him the strongest assurance that they would go\nwith Him to prison and to death. And poor, self-sufficient Peter had\nadded, \u201cAlthough all shall be offended, yet will not I.\u201d Mark 14:27,\n29. But the disciples trusted to themselves. They did not look to the[689]\nmighty Helper as Christ had counseled them to do. Thus when the\nSaviour was most in need of their sympathy and prayers, they were\nfound asleep. Even Peter was sleeping.\nAnd John, the loving disciple who had leaned upon the breast\nof Jesus, was asleep. Surely, the love of John for his Master should\nhave kept him awake. His earnest prayers should have mingled with\nthose of his loved Saviour in the time of His supreme sorrow. The\nRedeemer had spent entire nights praying for His disciples, that their\nfaith might not fail. Should Jesus now put to James and John the\nquestion He had once asked them, \u201cAre ye able to drink of the cup\nthat I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am\nbaptized with?\u201d they would not have ventured to answer, \u201cWe are\nable.\u201d Matthew 20:22.\nGethsemane 603\nThe disciples awakened at the voice of Jesus, but they hardly\nknew Him, His face was so changed by anguish. Addressing Peter,\nJesus said, \u201cSimon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one\nhour? Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit\ntruly is ready, but the flesh is weak.\u201d The weakness of His disciples\nawakened the sympathy of Jesus. He feared that they would not be\nable to endure the test which would come upon them in His betrayal\nand death. He did not reprove them, but said, \u201cWatch ye and pray,\nlest ye enter into temptation.\u201d Even in His great agony, He was\nseeking to excuse their weakness. \u201cThe spirit truly is ready,\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cbut the flesh is weak.\u201d\nAgain the Son of God was seized with superhuman agony, and\nfainting and exhausted, He staggered back to the place of His former\nstruggle. His suffering was even greater than before. As the agony of\nsoul came upon Him, \u201cHis sweat was as it were great drops of blood\nfalling down to the ground.\u201d The cypress and palm trees were the\nsilent witnesses of His anguish. From their leafy branches dropped\nheavy dew upon His stricken form, as if nature wept over its Author\nwrestling alone with the powers of darkness.\nA short time before, Jesus had stood like a mighty cedar, with-\nstanding the storm of opposition that spent its fury upon Him. Stub-\nborn wills, and hearts filled with malice and subtlety, had striven\nin vain to confuse and overpower Him. He stood forth in divine\nmajesty as the Son of God. Now He was like a reed beaten and\nbent by the angry storm. He had approached the consummation of\nHis work a conqueror, having at each step gained the victory over\nthe powers of darkness. As one already glorified, He had claimed [690]\noneness with God. In unfaltering accents He had poured out His\nsongs of praise. He had spoken to His disciples in words of courage\nand tenderness. Now had come the hour of the power of darkness.\nNow His voice was heard on the still evening air, not in tones of\ntriumph, but full of human anguish. The words of the Saviour were\nborne to the ears of the drowsy disciples, \u201cO My Father, if this cup\nmay not pass away from Me, except I drink it, Thy will be done.\u201d\nThe first impulse of the disciples was to go to Him; but He\nhad bidden them tarry there, watching unto prayer. When Jesus\ncame to them, He found them still sleeping. Again He had felt\na longing for companionship, for some words from His disciples\n604 The Desire of Ages\nwhich would bring relief, and break the spell of darkness that well-\nnigh overpowered Him. But their eyes were heavy; \u201cneither wist\nthey what to answer Him.\u201d His presence aroused them. They saw\nHis face marked with the bloody sweat of agony, and they were\nfilled with fear. His anguish of mind they could not understand. \u201cHis\nvisage was so marred more than any man, and His form more than\nthe sons of men.\u201d Isaiah 52:14.\nTurning away, Jesus sought again His retreat, and fell prostrate,\novercome by the horror of a great darkness. The humanity of the\nSon of God trembled in that trying hour. He prayed not now for\nHis disciples that their faith might not fail, but for His own tempted,\nagonized soul. The awful moment had come\u2014that moment which\nwas to decide the destiny of the world. The fate of humanity trem-\nbled in the balance. Christ might even now refuse to drink the cup\napportioned to guilty man. It was not yet too late. He might wipe the\nbloody sweat from His brow, and leave man to perish in his iniquity.\nHe might say, Let the transgressor receive the penalty of his sin, and\nI will go back to My Father. Will the Son of God drink the bitter cup\nof humiliation and agony? Will the innocent suffer the consequences\nof the curse of sin, to save the guilty? The words fall tremblingly\nfrom the pale lips of Jesus, \u201cO My Father, if this cup may not pass\naway from Me, except I drink it, Thy will be done.\u201d\nThree times has He uttered that prayer. Three times has humanity\nshrunk from the last, crowning sacrifice. But now the history of the\nhuman race comes up before the world\u2019s Redeemer. He sees that the\ntransgressors of the law, if left to themselves, must perish. He sees\nthe helplessness of man. He sees the power of sin. The woes and\nlamentations of a doomed world rise before Him. He beholds its\nimpending fate, and His decision is made. He will save man at any[691]\n[692]\n[693]\ncost to Himself. He accepts His baptism of blood, that through Him\nperishing millions may gain everlasting life. He has left the courts\nof heaven, where all is purity, happiness, and glory, to save the one\nlost sheep, the one world that has fallen by transgression. And He\nwill not turn from His mission. He will become the propitiation of a\nrace that has willed to sin. His prayer now breathes only submission:\n\u201cIf this cup may not pass away from Me, except I drink it, Thy will\nbe done.\u201d\nGethsemane 605\nHaving made the decision, He fell dying to the ground from\nwhich He had partially risen. Where now were His disciples, to\nplace their hands tenderly beneath the head of their fainting Master,\nand bathe that brow, marred indeed more than the sons of men? The\nSaviour trod the wine press alone, and of the people there was none\nwith Him.\nBut God suffered with His Son. Angels beheld the Saviour\u2019s\nagony. They saw their Lord enclosed by legions of satanic forces, His\nnature weighed down with a shuddering, mysterious dread. There\nwas silence in heaven. No harp was touched. Could mortals have\nviewed the amazement of the angelic host as in silent grief they\nwatched the Father separating His beams of light, love, and glory\nfrom His beloved Son, they would better understand how offensive\nin His sight is sin.\nThe worlds unfallen and the heavenly angels had watched with\nintense interest as the conflict drew to its close. Satan and his\nconfederacy of evil, the legions of apostasy, watched intently this\ngreat crisis in the work of redemption. The powers of good and evil\nwaited to see what answer would come to Christ\u2019s thrice-repeated\nprayer. Angels had longed to bring relief to the divine sufferer,\nbut this might not be. No way of escape was found for the Son of\nGod. In this awful crisis, when everything was at stake, when the\nmysterious cup trembled in the hand of the sufferer, the heavens\nopened, a light shone forth amid the stormy darkness of the crisis\nhour, and the mighty angel who stands in God\u2019s presence, occupying\nthe position from which Satan fell, came to the side of Christ. The\nangel came not to take the cup from Christ\u2019s hand, but to strengthen\nHim to drink it, with the assurance of the Father\u2019s love. He came to\ngive power to the divine-human suppliant. He pointed Him to the\nopen heavens, telling Him of the souls that would be saved as the\nresult of His sufferings. He assured Him that His Father is greater\nand more powerful than Satan, that His death would result in the\nutter discomfiture of Satan, and that the kingdom of this world would\nbe given to the saints of the Most High. He told Him that He would [694]\nsee of the travail of His soul, and be satisfied, for He would see a\nmultitude of the human race saved, eternally saved.\nChrist\u2019s agony did not cease, but His depression and discourage-\nment left Him. The storm had in nowise abated, but He who was its\n606 The Desire of Ages\nobject was strengthened to meet its fury. He came forth calm and\nserene. A heavenly peace rested upon His bloodstained face. He had\nborne that which no human being could ever bear; for He had tasted\nthe sufferings of death for every man.\nThe sleeping disciples had been suddenly awakened by the light\nsurrounding the Saviour. They saw the angel bending over their\nprostrate Master. They saw him lift the Saviour\u2019s head upon his\nbosom, and point toward heaven. They heard his voice, like sweetest\nmusic, speaking words of comfort and hope. The disciples recalled\nthe scene upon the mount of transfiguration. They remembered\nthe glory that in the temple had encircled Jesus, and the voice of\nGod that spoke from the cloud. Now that same glory was again\nrevealed, and they had no further fear for their Master. He was\nunder the care of God; a mighty angel had been sent to protect Him.\nAgain the disciples in their weariness yield to the strange stupor that\noverpowers them. Again Jesus finds them sleeping.\nLooking sorrowfully upon them He says, \u201cSleep on now, and\ntake your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is\nbetrayed into the hands of sinners.\u201d\nEven as He spoke these words, He heard the footsteps of the\nmob in search of Him, and said, \u201cRise, let us be going: behold, he is\nat hand that doth betray Me.\u201d\nNo traces of His recent agony were visible as Jesus stepped\nforth to meet His betrayer. Standing in advance of His disciples\nHe said, \u201cWhom seek ye?\u201d They answered, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d\nJesus replied, \u201cI am He.\u201d As these words were spoken, the angel\nwho had lately ministered to Jesus moved between Him and the\nmob. A divine light illuminated the Saviour\u2019s face, and a dovelike\nform overshadowed Him. In the presence of this divine glory, the\nmurderous throng could not stand for a moment. They staggered\nback. Priests, elders, soldiers, and even Judas, fell as dead men to\nthe ground.\nThe angel withdrew, and the light faded away. Jesus had oppor-\ntunity to escape, but He remained, calm and self-possessed. As one\nglorified He stood in the midst of that hardened band, now prostrate\nand helpless at His feet. The disciples looked on, silent with wonder\nand awe.\nBut quickly the scene changed. The mob started up. The Roman[695]\nGethsemane 607\nsoldiers, the priests and Judas, gathered about Christ. They seemed\nashamed of their weakness, and fearful that He would yet escape.\nAgain the question was asked by the Redeemer, \u201cWhom seek ye?\u201d\nThey had had evidence that He who stood before them was the Son\nof God, but they would not be convinced. To the question, \u201cWhom\nseek ye?\u201d again they answered, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d The Saviour\nthen said, \u201cI have told you that I am He: if therefore ye seek Me, let\nthese go their way\u201d\u2014pointing to the disciples. He knew how weak\nwas their faith, and He sought to shield them from temptation and\ntrial. For them He was ready to sacrifice Himself.\nJudas the betrayer did not forget the part he was to act. When\nthe mob entered the garden, he had led the way, closely followed by\nthe high priest. To the pursuers of Jesus he had given a sign, saying,\n\u201cWhomsoever I shall kiss, that same is He: hold Him fast.\u201d Matthew\n26:48. Now he pretends to have no part with them. Coming close\nto Jesus, he takes His hand as a familiar friend. With the words, [696]\n\u201cHail, Master,\u201d he kisses Him repeatedly, and appears to weep as if\nin sympathy with Him in His peril.\nJesus said to him, \u201cFriend, wherefore art thou come?\u201d His voice\ntrembled with sorrow as He added, \u201cJudas, betrayest thou the Son of\nman with a kiss?\u201d This appeal should have aroused the conscience\nof the betrayer, and touched his stubborn heart; but honor, fidelity,\nand human tenderness had forsaken him. He stood bold and defiant,\nshowing no disposition to relent. He had given himself up to Satan,\nand he had no power to resist him. Jesus did not refuse the traitor\u2019s\nkiss.\nThe mob grew bold as they saw Judas touch the person of Him\nwho had so recently been glorified before their eyes. They now laid\nhold of Jesus, and proceeded to bind those precious hands that had\never been employed in doing good.\nThe disciples had thought that their Master would not suffer\nHimself to be taken. For the same power that had caused the mob\nto fall as dead men could keep them helpless, until Jesus and His\ncompanions should escape. They were disappointed and indignant\nas they saw the cords brought forward to bind the hands of Him\nwhom they loved. Peter in his anger rashly drew his sword and tried\nto defend his Master, but he only cut off an ear of the high priest\u2019s\nservant. When Jesus saw what was done, He released His hands,\n608 The Desire of Ages\nthough held firmly by the Roman soldiers, and saying, \u201cSuffer ye\nthus far,\u201d He touched the wounded ear, and it was instantly made\nwhole. He then said to Peter, \u201cPut up again thy sword into his place:\nfor all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest\nthou that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He shall presently\ngive Me more than twelve legions of angels?\u201d\u2014a legion in place\nof each one of the disciples. Oh, why, the disciples thought, does\nHe not save Himself and us? Answering their unspoken thought,\nHe added, \u201cBut how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus\nit must be?\u201d \u201cThe cup which My Father hath given Me, shall I not\ndrink it?\u201d\nThe official dignity of the Jewish leaders had not prevented them\nfrom joining in the pursuit of Jesus. His arrest was too important\na matter to be trusted to subordinates; the wily priests and elders\nhad joined the temple police and the rabble in following Judas to\nGethsemane. What a company for those dignitaries to unite with\u2014a\nmob that was eager for excitement, and armed with all kinds of\nimplements, as if in pursuit of a wild beast!\nTurning to the priests and elders, Christ fixed upon them His[697]\nsearching glance. The words He spoke they would never forget\nas long as life should last. They were as the sharp arrows of the\nAlmighty. With dignity He said: You come out against Me with\nswords and staves as you would against a thief or a robber. Day by\nday I sat teaching in the temple. You had every opportunity of laying\nhands upon Me, and you did nothing. The night is better suited to\nyour work. \u201cThis is your hour, and the power of darkness.\u201d\nThe disciples were terrified as they saw Jesus permit Himself\nto be taken and bound. They were offended that He should suffer\nthis humiliation to Himself and them. They could not understand\nHis conduct, and they blamed Him for submitting to the mob. In\ntheir indignation and fear, Peter proposed that they save themselves.\nFollowing this suggestion, \u201cthey all forsook Him, and fled.\u201d But\nChrist had foretold this desertion, \u201cBehold,\u201d He had said, \u201cthe hour\ncometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to\nhis own, and shall leave Me alone: and yet I am not alone, because\nthe Father is with Me.\u201d John 16:32.\nChapter 75\u2014Before Annas and the Court of [698]\nCaiaphas\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 26:57-75; Matthew 27:1; Mark\n14:53-72; Mark 15:1; Luke 22:54-71; John 18:13-27.\nOver the brook Kedron, past gardens and olive groves, and\nthrough the hushed streets of the sleeping city, they hurried Jesus. It\nwas past midnight, and the cries of the hooting mob that followed\nHim broke sharply upon the still air. The Saviour was bound and\nclosely guarded, and He moved painfully. But in eager haste His\ncaptors made their way with Him to the palace of Annas, the ex-high\npriest.\nAnnas was the head of the officiating priestly family, and in\ndeference to his age he was recognized by the people as high priest.\nHis counsel was sought and carried out as the voice of God. He must\nfirst see Jesus a captive to priestly power. He must be present at the\nexamination of the prisoner, for fear that the less-experienced Ca-\niaphas might fail of securing the object for which they were working.\nHis artifice, cunning, and subtlety must be used on this occasion;\nfor, at all events, Christ\u2019s condemnation must be secured.\nChrist was to be tried formally before the Sanhedrin; but before\nAnnas He was subjected to a preliminary trial. Under the Roman\nrule the Sanhedrin could not execute the sentence of death. They\ncould only examine a prisoner, and pass judgment, to be ratified by\nthe Roman authorities. It was therefore necessary to bring against\nChrist charges that would be regarded as criminal by the Romans. [699]\nAn accusation must also be found which would condemn Him in the\neyes of the Jews. Not a few among the priests and rulers had been\nconvicted by Christ\u2019s teaching, and only fear of excommunication\nprevented them from confessing Him. The priests well remembered\nthe question of Nicodemus, \u201cDoth our law judge any man, before it\nhear him, and know what he doeth?\u201d John 7:51. This question had\nfor the time broken up the council, and thwarted their plans. Joseph\n609\n610 The Desire of Ages\nof Arimathaea and Nicodemus were not now to be summoned, but\nthere were others who might dare to speak in favor of justice. The\ntrial must be so conducted as to unite the members of the Sanhedrin\nagainst Christ. There were two charges which the priests desired\nto maintain. If Jesus could be proved a blasphemer, He would be\ncondemned by the Jews. If convicted of sedition, it would secure\nHis condemnation by the Romans. The second charge Annas tried\nfirst to establish. He questioned Jesus concerning His disciples and\nHis doctrines, hoping the prisoner would say something that would\ngive him material upon which to work. He thought to draw out some\nstatement to prove that He was seeking to establish a secret society,\nwith the purpose of setting up a new kingdom. Then the priests\ncould deliver Him to the Romans as a disturber of the peace and a\ncreator of insurrection.\nChrist read the priest\u2019s purpose as an open book. As if reading\nthe inmost soul of His questioner, He denied that there was between\nHim and His followers any secret bond of union, or that He gathered\nthem secretly and in the darkness to conceal His designs. He had\nno secrets in regard to His purposes or doctrines. \u201cI spake openly\nto the world,\u201d He answered; \u201cI ever taught in the synagogue, and in\nthe temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said\nnothing.\u201d\nThe Saviour contrasted His own manner of work with the meth-\nods of His accusers. For months they had hunted Him, striving to\nentrap Him and bring Him before a secret tribunal, where they might\nobtain by perjury what it was impossible to gain by fair means. Now\nthey were carrying out their purpose. The midnight seizure by a\nmob, the mockery and abuse before He was condemned, or even\naccused, was their manner of work, not His. Their action was in\nviolation of the law. Their own rules declared that every man should\nbe treated as innocent until proved guilty. By their own rules the\npriests stood condemned.\nTurning upon His questioner, Jesus said, \u201cWhy askest thou Me?\u201d\nHad not the priests and rulers sent spies to watch His movements,\nand report His every word? Had not these been present at every\ngathering of the people, and carried to the priests information of all[700]\nHis sayings and doings? \u201cAsk them which heard Me, what I have\nsaid unto them,\u201d replied Jesus; \u201cbehold, they know what I said.\u201d\nBefore Annas and the Court of Caiaphas 611\nAnnas was silenced by the decision of the answer. Fearing that\nChrist would say something regarding his course of action that he\nwould prefer to keep covered up, he said nothing more to Him at this\ntime. One of his officers, filled with wrath as he saw Annas silenced,\nstruck Jesus on the face, saying, \u201cAnswerest Thou the high priest\nso?\u201d\nChrist calmly replied, \u201cIf I have spoken evil, bear witness of the\nevil: but if well, why smitest thou Me?\u201d He spoke no burning words\nof retaliation. His calm answer came from a heart sinless, patient,\nand gentle, that would not be provoked.\nChrist suffered keenly under abuse and insult. At the hands of\nthe beings whom He had created, and for whom He was making\nan infinite sacrifice, He received every indignity. And He suffered\nin proportion to the perfection of His holiness and His hatred of\nsin. His trial by men who acted as fiends was to Him a perpetual\nsacrifice. To be surrounded by human beings under the control of\nSatan was revolting to Him. And He knew that in a moment, by the\nflashing forth of His divine power, He could lay His cruel tormentors\nin the dust. This made the trial the harder to bear.\nThe Jews were looking for a Messiah to be revealed in outward\nshow. They expected Him, by one flash of overmastering will,\nto change the current of men\u2019s thoughts, and force from them an\nacknowledgment of His supremacy. Thus, they believed, He was to\nsecure His own exaltation, and gratify their ambitious hopes. Thus\nwhen Christ was treated with contempt, there came to Him a strong\ntemptation to manifest His divine character. By a word, by a look,\nHe could compel His persecutors to confess that He was Lord above\nkings and rulers, priests and temple. But it was His difficult task to\nkeep to the position He had chosen as one with humanity.\nThe angels of heaven witnessed every movement made against\ntheir loved Commander. They longed to deliver Christ. Under God\nthe angels are all-powerful. On one occasion, in obedience to the\ncommand of Christ, they slew of the Assyrian army in one night one\nhundred and eighty-five thousand men. How easily could the angels,\nbeholding the shameful scene of the trial of Christ, have testified\ntheir indignation by consuming the adversaries of God! But they\nwere not commanded to do this. He who could have doomed His\nenemies to death bore with their cruelty. His love for His Father, and [701]\n[702]\n[703]\n612 The Desire of Ages\nHis pledge, made from the foundation of the world, to become the\nSin Bearer, led Him to endure uncomplainingly the coarse treatment\nof those He came to save. It was a part of His mission to bear, in His\nhumanity, all the taunts and abuse that men could heap upon Him.\nThe only hope of humanity was in this submission of Christ to all\nthat He could endure from the hands and hearts of men.\nChrist had said nothing that could give His accusers an advan-\ntage; yet He was bound, to signify that He was condemned. There\nmust, however, be a pretense of justice. It was necessary that there\nshould be the form of a legal trial. This the authorities were deter-\nmined to hasten. They knew the regard in which Jesus was held\nby the people, and feared that if the arrest were noised abroad, a\nrescue would be attempted. Again, if the trial and execution were\nnot brought about at once, there would be a week\u2019s delay on account\nof the celebration of the Passover. This might defeat their plans. In\nsecuring the condemnation of Jesus they depended largely upon the\nclamor of the mob, many of them the rabble of Jerusalem. Should\nthere be a week\u2019s delay, the excitement would abate, and a reaction\nwould be likely to set in. The better part of the people would be\naroused in Christ\u2019s favor; many would come forward with testimony\nin His vindication, bringing to light the mighty works He had done.\nThis would excite popular indignation against the Sanhedrin. Their\nproceedings would be condemned, and Jesus would be set free, to\nreceive new homage from the multitudes. The priests and rulers\ntherefore determined that before their purpose could become known,\nJesus should be delivered into the hands of the Romans.\nBut first of all, an accusation was to be found. They had gained\nnothing as yet. Annas ordered Jesus to be taken to Caiaphas. Ca-\niaphas belonged to the Sadducees, some of whom were now the\nmost desperate enemies of Jesus. He himself, though wanting in\nforce of character, was fully as severe, heartless, and unscrupulous\nas was Annas. He would leave no means untried to destroy Jesus.\nIt was now early morning, and very dark; by the light of torches\nand lanterns the armed band with their prisoner proceeded to the\nhigh priest\u2019s palace. Here, while the members of the Sanhedrin were\ncoming together, Annas and Caiaphas again questioned Jesus, but\nwithout success.\nBefore Annas and the Court of Caiaphas 613\nWhen the council had assembled in the judgment hall, Caiaphas\ntook his seat as presiding officer. On either side were the judges,\nand those specially interested in the trial. The Roman soldiers were\nstationed on the platform below the throne. At the foot of the throne [704]\nstood Jesus. Upon Him the gaze of the whole multitude was fixed.\nThe excitement was intense. Of all the throng He alone was calm\nand serene. The very atmosphere surrounding Him seemed pervaded\nby a holy influence.\nCaiaphas had regarded Jesus as his rival. The eagerness of the\npeople to hear the Saviour, and their apparent readiness to accept\nHis teachings, had aroused the bitter jealousy of the high priest. But\nas Caiaphas now looked upon the prisoner, he was struck with admi-\nration for His noble and dignified bearing. A conviction came over\nhim that this Man was akin to God. The next instant he scornfully\nbanished the thought. Immediately his voice was heard in sneer- [705]\ning, haughty tones demanding that Jesus work one of His mighty\nmiracles before them. But his words fell upon the Saviour\u2019s ears as\nthough He heard them not. The people compared the excited and\nmalignant deportment of Annas and Caiaphas with the calm, majes-\ntic bearing of Jesus. Even in the minds of that hardened multitude\narose the question, Is this man of godlike presence to be condemned\nas a criminal?\nCaiaphas, perceiving the influence that was obtaining, hastened\nthe trial. The enemies of Jesus were in great perplexity. They were\nbent on securing His condemnation, but how to accomplish this they\nknew not. The members of the council were divided between the\nPharisees and the Sadducees. There was bitter animosity and contro-\nversy between them; certain disputed points they dared not approach\nfor fear of a quarrel. With a few words Jesus could have excited\ntheir prejudices against each other, and thus have averted their wrath\nfrom Himself. Caiaphas knew this, and he wished to avoid stirring\nup a contention. There were plenty of witnesses to prove that Christ\nhad denounced the priests and scribes, that He had called them hyp-\nocrites and murderers; but this testimony it was not expedient to\nbring forward. The Sadducees in their sharp contentions with the\nPharisees had used to them similar language. And such testimony\nwould have no weight with the Romans, who were themselves dis-\ngusted with the pretensions of the Pharisees. There was abundant\n614 The Desire of Ages\nevidence that Jesus had disregarded the traditions of the Jews, and\nhad spoken irreverently of many of their ordinances; but in regard to\ntradition the Pharisees and Sadducees were at swords\u2019 points; and\nthis evidence also would have no weight with the Romans. Christ\u2019s\nenemies dared not accuse Him of Sabbathbreaking, lest an exami-\nnation should reveal the character of His work. If His miracles of\nhealing were brought to light, the very object of the priests would\nbe defeated.\nFalse witnesses had been bribed to accuse Jesus of inciting re-\nbellion and seeking to establish a separate government. But their\ntestimony proved to be vague and contradictory. Under examination\nthey falsified their own statements.\nEarly in His ministry Christ had said, \u201cDestroy this temple,\nand in three days I will raise it up.\u201d In the figurative language of\nprophecy, He had thus foretold His own death and resurrection. \u201cHe\nspake of the temple of His body.\u201d John 2:19, 21. These words the\nJews had understood in a literal sense, as referring to the temple\nat Jerusalem. Of all that Christ had said, the priests could find\nnothing to use against Him save this. By misstating these words they[706]\nhoped to gain an advantage. The Romans had engaged in rebuilding\nand embellishing the temple, and they took great pride in it; any\ncontempt shown to it would be sure to excite their indignation. Here\nRomans and Jews, Pharisees and Sadducees, could meet; for all\nheld the temple in great veneration. On this point two witnesses\nwere found whose testimony was not so contradictory as that of the\nothers had been. One of them, who had been bribed to accuse Jesus,\ndeclared, \u201cThis fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God,\nand to build it in three days.\u201d Thus Christ\u2019s words were misstated. If\nthey had been reported exactly as He spoke them, they would not\nhave secured His condemnation even by the Sanhedrin. Had Jesus\nbeen a mere man, as the Jews claimed, His declaration would only\nhave indicated an unreasonable, boastful spirit, but could not have\nbeen construed into blasphemy. Even as misrepresented by the false\nwitnesses, His words contained nothing which would be regarded\nby the Romans as a crime worthy of death.\nPatiently Jesus listened to the conflicting testimonies. No word\ndid He utter in self-defense. At last His accusers were entangled,\nconfused, and maddened. The trial was making no headway; it\nBefore Annas and the Court of Caiaphas 615\nseemed that their plottings were to fail. Caiaphas was desperate. One\nlast resort remained; Christ must be forced to condemn Himself. The\nhigh priest started from the judgment seat, his face contorted with\npassion, his voice and demeanor plainly indicating that were it in his\npower he would strike down the prisoner before him. \u201cAnswerest\nThou nothing?\u201d he exclaimed; \u201cwhat is it which these witness against\nThee?\u201d\nJesus held His peace. \u201cHe was oppressed, and He was afflicted,\nyet He opened not His mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaugh-\nter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not\nHis mouth.\u201d Isaiah 53:7.\nAt last, Caiaphas, raising his right hand toward heaven, addressed\nJesus in the form of a solemn oath: \u201cI adjure Thee by the living God,\nthat Thou tell us whether Thou be the Christ, the Son of God.\u201d\nTo this appeal Christ could not remain silent. There was a time\nto be silent, and a time to speak. He had not spoken until directly\nquestioned. He knew that to answer now would make His death\ncertain. But the appeal was made by the highest acknowledged\nauthority of the nation, and in the name of the Most High. Christ\nwould not fail to show proper respect for the law. More than this,\nHis own relation to the Father was called in question. He must\nplainly declare His character and mission. Jesus had said to His [707]\ndisciples, \u201cWhosoever therefore shall confess Me before men, him\nwill I confess also before My Father which is in heaven.\u201d Matthew\n10:32. Now by His own example He repeated the lesson.\nEvery ear was bent to listen, and every eye was fixed on His\nface as He answered, \u201cThou hast said.\u201d A heavenly light seemed to\nilluminate His pale countenance as He added, \u201cNevertheless I say\nunto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right\nhand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\u201d\nFor a moment the divinity of Christ flashed through His guise\nof humanity. The high priest quailed before the penetrating eyes of\nthe Saviour. That look seemed to read his hidden thoughts, and burn\ninto his heart. Never in afterlife did he forget that searching glance\nof the persecuted Son of God.\n\u201cHereafter,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cshall ye see the Son of man sitting on\nthe right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\u201d In [708]\nthese words Christ presented the reverse of the scene then taking\n616 The Desire of Ages\nplace. He, the Lord of life and glory, would be seated at God\u2019s right\nhand. He would be the judge of all the earth, and from His decision\nthere could be no appeal. Then every secret thing would be set in\nthe light of God\u2019s countenance, and judgment be passed upon every\nman according to his deeds.\nThe words of Christ startled the high priest. The thought that\nthere was to be a resurrection of the dead, when all would stand at the\nbar of God, to be rewarded according to their works, was a thought of\nterror to Caiaphas. He did not wish to believe that in future he would\nreceive sentence according to his works. There rushed before his\nmind as a panorama the scenes of the final judgment. For a moment\nhe saw the fearful spectacle of the graves giving up their dead, with\nthe secrets he had hoped were forever hidden. For a moment he felt\nas if standing before the eternal Judge, whose eye, which sees all\nthings, was reading his soul, bringing to light mysteries supposed to\nbe hidden with the dead.\nThe scene passed from the priest\u2019s vision. Christ\u2019s words cut\nhim, the Sadducee, to the quick. Caiaphas had denied the doctrine\nof the resurrection, the judgment, and a future life. Now he was\nmaddened by satanic fury. Was this man, a prisoner before him, to\nassail his most cherished theories? Rending his robe, that the people\nmight see his pretended horror, he demanded that without further\npreliminaries the prisoner be condemned for blasphemy. \u201cWhat\nfurther need have we of witnesses?\u201d he said; \u201cbehold, now ye have\nheard His blasphemy. What think ye?\u201d And they all condemned\nHim.\nConviction mingled with passion led Caiaphas to do as he did.\nHe was furious with himself for believing Christ\u2019s words, and instead\nof rending his heart under a deep sense of truth, and confessing that\nJesus was the Messiah, he rent his priestly robes in determined resis-\ntance. This act was deeply significant. Little did Caiaphas realize its\nmeaning. In this act, done to influence the judges and secure Christ\u2019s\ncondemnation, the high priest had condemned himself. By the law\nof God he was disqualified for the priesthood. He had pronounced\nupon himself the death sentence.\nA high priest was not to rend his garments. By the Levitical law,\nthis was prohibited under sentence of death. Under no circumstances,\non no occasion, was the priest to rend his robe. It was the custom\nBefore Annas and the Court of Caiaphas 617\namong the Jews for the garments to be rent at the death of friends,\nbut this custom the priests were not to observe. Express command [709]\nhad been given by Christ to Moses concerning this. Leviticus 10:6.\nEverything worn by the priest was to be whole and without\nblemish. By those beautiful official garments was represented the\ncharacter of the great antitype, Jesus Christ. Nothing but perfection,\nin dress and attitude, in word and spirit, could be acceptable to God.\nHe is holy, and His glory and perfection must be represented by\nthe earthly service. Nothing but perfection could properly represent\nthe sacredness of the heavenly service. Finite man might rend his\nown heart by showing a contrite and humble spirit. This God would\ndiscern. But no rent must be made in the priestly robes, for this\nwould mar the representation of heavenly things. The high priest\nwho dared to appear in holy office, and engage in the service of\nthe sanctuary, with a rent robe, was looked upon as having severed\nhimself from God. By rending his garment he cut himself off from\nbeing a representative character. He was no longer accepted by\nGod as an officiating priest. This course of action, as exhibited by\nCaiaphas, showed human passion, human imperfection.\nBy rending his garments, Caiaphas made of no effect the law of\nGod, to follow the tradition of men. A man-made law provided that\nin case of blasphemy a priest might rend his garments in horror at\nthe sin, and be guiltless. Thus the law of God was made void by the\nlaws of men.\nEach action of the high priest was watched with interest by the\npeople; and Caiaphas thought for effect to display his piety. But in\nthis act, designed as an accusation against Christ, he was reviling\nthe One of whom God had said, \u201cMy name is in Him.\u201d Exodus\n23:21. He himself was committing blasphemy. Standing under the\ncondemnation of God, he pronounced sentence upon Christ as a\nblasphemer.\nWhen Caiaphas rent his garment, his act was significant of the\nplace that the Jewish nation as a nation would thereafter occupy\ntoward God. The once favored people of God were separating them-\nselves from Him, and were fast becoming a people disowned by\nJehovah. When Christ upon the cross cried out, \u201cIt is finished\u201d\n(John 19:30), and the veil of the temple was rent in twain, the Holy\nWatcher declared that the Jewish people had rejected Him who was\n618 The Desire of Ages\nthe antitype of all their types, the substance of all their shadows.\nIsrael was divorced from God. Well might Caiaphas then rend his\nofficial robes, which signified that he claimed to be a representative\nof the great High Priest; for no longer had they any meaning for him\nor for the people. Well might the high priest rend his robes in horror\nfor himself and for the nation.\nThe Sanhedrin had pronounced Jesus worthy of death; but it[710]\nwas contrary to the Jewish law to try a prisoner by night. In legal\ncondemnation nothing could be done except in the light of day and\nbefore a full session of the council. Notwithstanding this, the Saviour\nwas now treated as a condemned criminal, and given up to be abused\nby the lowest and vilest of humankind. The palace of the high priest\nsurrounded an open court in which the soldiers and the multitude\nhad gathered. Through this court, Jesus was taken to the guardroom,\non every side meeting with mockery of His claim to be the Son\nof God. His own words, \u201csitting on the right hand of power,\u201d and,\n\u201ccoming in the clouds of heaven,\u201d were jeeringly repeated. While\nin the guardroom, awaiting His legal trial, He was not protected.\nThe ignorant rabble had seen the cruelty with which He was treated\nbefore the council, and from this they took license to manifest all the\nsatanic elements of their nature. Christ\u2019s very nobility and godlike\nbearing goaded them to madness. His meekness, His innocence,\nHis majestic patience, filled them with hatred born of Satan. Mercy\nand justice were trampled upon. Never was criminal treated in so\ninhuman a manner as was the Son of God.\nBut a keener anguish rent the heart of Jesus; the blow that in-\nflicted the deepest pain no enemy\u2019s hand could have dealt. While\nHe was undergoing the mockery of an examination before Caiaphas,\nChrist had been denied by one of His own disciples.\nAfter deserting their Master in the garden, two of the disciples\nhad ventured to follow, at a distance, the mob that had Jesus in\ncharge. These disciples were Peter and John. The priests recognized\nJohn as a well-known disciple of Jesus, and admitted him to the hall,\nhoping that as he witnessed the humiliation of his Leader, he would\nscorn the idea of such a one being the Son of God. John spoke in\nfavor of Peter, and gained an entrance for him also.\nIn the court a fire had been kindled; for it was the coldest hour\nof the night, being just before the dawn. A company drew about\nBefore Annas and the Court of Caiaphas 619\nthe fire, and Peter presumptuously took his place with them. He\ndid not wish to be recognized as a disciple of Jesus. By mingling\ncarelessly with the crowd, he hoped to be taken for one of those who\nhad brought Jesus to the hall.\nBut as the light flashed upon Peter\u2019s face, the woman who kept\nthe door cast a searching glance upon him. She had noticed that\nhe came in with John, she marked the look of dejection on his\nface, and thought that he might be a disciple of Jesus. She was one [711]\nof the servants of Caiaphas\u2019 household, and was curious to know.\nShe said to Peter, \u201cArt not thou also one of this Man\u2019s disciples?\u201d\nPeter was startled and confused; the eyes of the company instantly\nfastened upon him. He pretended not to understand her; but she was\npersistent, and said to those around her that this man was with Jesus.\nPeter felt compelled to answer, and said angrily, \u201cWoman, I know\nHim not.\u201d This was the first denial, and immediately the cock crew.\nO Peter, so soon ashamed of thy Master! so soon to deny thy Lord!\nThe disciple John, upon entering the judgment hall, did not try\nto conceal the fact that he was a follower of Jesus. He did not mingle\nwith the rough company who were reviling his Master. He was not\nquestioned, for he did not assume a false character, and thus lay\nhimself liable to suspicion. He sought a retired corner secure from\nthe notice of the mob, but as near Jesus as it was possible for him to [712]\nbe. Here he could see and hear all that took place at the trial of his\nLord.\nPeter had not designed that his real character should be known.\nIn assuming an air of indifference he had placed himself on the\nenemy\u2019s ground, and he became an easy prey to temptation. If\nhe had been called to fight for his Master, he would have been a\ncourageous soldier; but when the finger of scorn was pointed at\nhim, he proved himself a coward. Many who do not shrink from\nactive warfare for their Lord are driven by ridicule to deny their\nfaith. By associating with those whom they should avoid, they place\nthemselves in the way of temptation. They invite the enemy to\ntempt them, and are led to say and do that of which under other\ncircumstances they would never have been guilty. The disciple of\nChrist who in our day disguises his faith through dread of suffering\nor reproach denies his Lord as really as did Peter in the judgment\nhall.\n620 The Desire of Ages\nPeter tried to show no interest in the trial of his Master, but his\nheart was wrung with sorrow as he heard the cruel taunts, and saw\nthe abuse He was suffering. More than this, he was surprised and\nangry that Jesus should humiliate Himself and His followers by\nsubmitting to such treatment. In order to conceal his true feelings,\nhe endeavored to join with the persecutors of Jesus in their untimely\njests. But his appearance was unnatural. He was acting a lie, and\nwhile seeking to talk unconcernedly he could not restrain expressions\nof indignation at the abuse heaped upon his Master.\nAttention was called to him the second time, and he was again\ncharged with being a follower of Jesus. He now declared with an\noath, \u201cI do not know the Man.\u201d Still another opportunity was given\nhim. An hour had passed, when one of the servants of the high\npriest, being a near kinsman of the man whose ear Peter had cut off,\nasked him, \u201cDid not I see thee in the garden with Him?\u201d \u201cSurely\nthou art one of them: for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech agreeth\nthereto.\u201d At this Peter flew into a rage. The disciples of Jesus were\nnoted for the purity of their language, and in order fully to deceive\nhis questioners, and justify his assumed character, Peter now denied\nhis Master with cursing and swearing. Again the cock crew. Peter\nheard it then, and he remembered the words of Jesus, \u201cBefore the\ncock crow twice, thou shalt deny Me thrice.\u201d Mark 14:30.\nWhile the degrading oaths were fresh upon Peter\u2019s lips, and the\nshrill crowing of the cock was still ringing in his ears, the Saviour[713]\nturned from the frowning judges, and looked full upon His poor\ndisciple. At the same time Peter\u2019s eyes were drawn to his Master. In\nthat gentle countenance he read deep pity and sorrow, but there was\nno anger there.\nThe sight of that pale, suffering face, those quivering lips, that\nlook of compassion and forgiveness, pierced his heart like an arrow.\nConscience was aroused. Memory was active. Peter called to mind\nhis promise of a few short hours before that he would go with his\nLord to prison and to death. He remembered his grief when the\nSaviour told him in the upper chamber that he would deny his Lord\nthrice that same night. Peter had just declared that he knew not Jesus,\nbut he now realized with bitter grief how well his Lord knew him,\nand how accurately He had read his heart, the falseness of which\nwas unknown even to himself.\nBefore Annas and the Court of Caiaphas 621\nA tide of memories rushed over him. The Saviour\u2019s tender mercy,\nHis kindness and long-suffering, His gentleness and patience toward\nHis erring disciples,\u2014all was remembered. He recalled the caution,\n\u201cSimon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you\nas wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.\u201d Luke\n22:31, 32. He reflected with horror upon his own ingratitude, his\nfalsehood, his perjury. Once more he looked at his Master, and saw\na sacrilegious hand raised to smite Him in the face. Unable longer\nto endure the scene, he rushed, heartbroken, from the hall.\nHe pressed on in solitude and darkness, he knew not and cared\nnot whither. At last he found himself in Gethsemane. The scene of a\nfew hours before came vividly to his mind. The suffering face of his\nLord, stained with bloody sweat and convulsed with anguish, rose\nbefore him. He remembered with bitter remorse that Jesus had wept\nand agonized in prayer alone, while those who should have united\nwith Him in that trying hour were sleeping. He remembered His\nsolemn charge, \u201cWatch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.\u201d\nMatthew 26:41. He witnessed again the scene in the judgment hall.\nIt was torture to his bleeding heart to know that he had added the\nheaviest burden to the Saviour\u2019s humiliation and grief. On the very\nspot where Jesus had poured out His soul in agony to His Father,\nPeter fell upon his face, and wished that he might die.\nIt was in sleeping when Jesus bade him watch and pray that Peter\nhad prepared the way for his great sin. All the disciples, by sleeping\nin that critical hour, sustained a great loss. Christ knew the fiery [714]\nordeal through which they were to pass. He knew how Satan would\nwork to paralyze their senses that they might be unready for the trial.\nTherefore it was that He gave them warning. Had those hours in\nthe garden been spent in watching and prayer, Peter would not have\nbeen left to depend upon his own feeble strength. He would not\nhave denied his Lord. Had the disciples watched with Christ in His\nagony, they would have been prepared to behold His suffering upon\nthe cross. They would have understood in some degree the nature of\nHis overpowering anguish. They would have been able to recall His\nwords that foretold His sufferings, His death, and His resurrection.\nAmid the gloom of the most trying hour, some rays of hope would\nhave lighted up the darkness and sustained their faith.\n622 The Desire of Ages\nAs soon as it was day, the Sanhedrin again assembled, and again\nJesus was brought into the council room. He had declared Himself\nthe Son of God, and they had construed His words into a charge\nagainst Him. But they could not condemn Him on this, for many\nof them had not been present at the night session, and they had not\nheard His words. And they knew that the Roman tribunal would\nfind in them nothing worthy of death. But if from His own lips they\ncould all hear those words repeated, their object might be gained.\nHis claim to the Messiahship they might construe into a seditious\npolitical claim.\n\u201cArt Thou the Christ?\u201d they said, \u201ctell us.\u201d But Christ remained\nsilent. They continued to ply Him with questions. At last in tones\nof mournful pathos He answered, \u201cIf I tell you, ye will not believe;\nand if I also ask you, ye will not answer Me, nor let Me go.\u201d But\nthat they might be left without excuse He added the solemn warning,\n\u201cHereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of\nGod.\u201d\n\u201cArt Thou then the Son of God?\u201d they asked with one voice.\nHe said unto them, \u201cYe say that I am.\u201d They cried out, \u201cWhat need\nwe any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of His own\nmouth.\u201d\nAnd so by the third condemnation of the Jewish authorities,\nJesus was to die. All that was now necessary, they thought, was for\nthe Romans to ratify this condemnation, and deliver Him into their\nhands.\nThen came the third scene of abuse and mockery, worse even\nthan that received from the ignorant rabble. In the very presence\nof the priests and rulers, and with their sanction, this took place.\nEvery feeling of sympathy or humanity had gone out of their hearts.\nIf their arguments were weak, and failed to silence His voice, they[715]\nhad other weapons, such as in all ages have been used to silence\nheretics,\u2014suffering, and violence, and death.\nWhen the condemnation of Jesus was pronounced by the judges,\na satanic fury took possession of the people. The roar of voices\nwas like that of wild beasts. The crowd made a rush toward Jesus,\ncrying, He is guilty, put Him to death! Had it not been for the\nRoman soldiers, Jesus would not have lived to be nailed to the cross\nof Calvary. He would have been torn in pieces before His judges,\nBefore Annas and the Court of Caiaphas 623\nhad not Roman authority interfered, and by force of arms restrained\nthe violence of the mob.\nHeathen men were angry at the brutal treatment of one against\nwhom nothing had been proved. The Roman officers declared that\nthe Jews in pronouncing condemnation upon Jesus were infringing\nupon the Roman power, and that it was even against the Jewish law to\ncondemn a man to death upon his own testimony. This intervention\nbrought a momentary lull in the proceedings; but the Jewish leaders\nwere dead alike to pity and to shame.\nPriests and rulers forgot the dignity of their office, and abused the\nSon of God with foul epithets. They taunted Him with His parentage.\nThey declared that His presumption in proclaiming Himself the\nMessiah made Him deserving of the most ignominious death. The\nmost dissolute men engaged in infamous abuse of the Saviour. An\nold garment was thrown over His head, and His persecutors struck\nHim in the face, saying, \u201cProphesy unto us, Thou Christ, Who is he\nthat smote Thee?\u201d When the garment was removed, one poor wretch\nspat in His face.\nThe angels of God faithfully recorded every insulting look, word,\nand act against their beloved Commander. One day the base men\nwho scorned and spat upon the calm, pale face of Christ will look\nupon it in its glory, shining brighter than the sun.\nChapter 76\u2014Judas[716]\nThe history of Judas presents the sad ending of a life that might\nhave been honored of God. Had Judas died before his last journey\nto Jerusalem he would have been regarded as a man worthy of a\nplace among the twelve, and one who would be greatly missed. The\nabhorrence which has followed him through the centuries would not\nhave existed but for the attributes revealed at the close of his history.\nBut it was for a purpose that his character was laid open to the world.\nIt was to be a warning to all who, like him, should betray sacred\ntrusts.\nA little before the Passover, Judas had renewed his contract with\nthe priests to deliver Jesus into their hands. Then it was arranged\nthat the Saviour should be taken at one of His resorts for meditation\nand prayer. Since the feast at the house of Simon, Judas had had\nopportunity to reflect upon the deed which he had covenanted to\nperform, but his purpose was unchanged. For thirty pieces of silver\u2014\nthe price of a slave\u2014he sold the Lord of glory to ignominy and death.\nJudas had naturally a strong love for money; but he had not\nalways been corrupt enough to do such a deed as this. He had\nfostered the evil spirit of avarice until it had become the ruling\nmotive of his life. The love of mammon overbalanced his love for\nChrist. Through becoming the slave of one vice he gave himself to\nSatan, to be driven to any lengths in sin.\nJudas had joined the disciples when multitudes were following\nChrist. The Saviour\u2019s teaching moved their hearts as they hung\nentranced upon His words, spoken in the synagogue, by the seaside,\nupon the mount. Judas saw the sick, the lame, the blind, flock to[717]\nJesus from the towns and cities. He saw the dying laid at His feet. He\nwitnessed the Saviour\u2019s mighty works in healing the sick, casting out\ndevils, and raising the dead. He felt in his own person the evidence\nof Christ\u2019s power. He recognized the teaching of Christ as superior\nto all that he had ever heard. He loved the Great Teacher, and desired\nto be with Him. He felt a desire to be changed in character and\n624\nJudas 625\nlife, and he hoped to experience this through connecting himself\nwith Jesus. The Saviour did not repulse Judas. He gave him a place\namong the twelve. He trusted him to do the work of an evangelist.\nHe endowed him with power to heal the sick and to cast out devils.\nBut Judas did not come to the point of surrendering himself fully to\nChrist. He did not give up his worldly ambition or his love of money.\nWhile he accepted the position of a minister of Christ, he did not\nbring himself under the divine molding. He felt that he could retain\nhis own judgment and opinions, and he cultivated a disposition to\ncriticize and accuse.\nJudas was highly regarded by the disciples, and had great influ-\nence over them. He himself had a high opinion of his own quali-\nfications, and looked upon his brethren as greatly inferior to him\nin judgment and ability. They did not see their opportunities, he\nthought, and take advantage of circumstances. The church would\nnever prosper with such shortsighted men as leaders. Peter was\nimpetuous; he would move without consideration. John, who was\ntreasuring up the truths that fell from Christ\u2019s lips, was looked upon\nby Judas as a poor financier. Matthew, whose training had taught\nhim accuracy in all things, was very particular in regard to honesty,\nand he was ever contemplating the words of Christ, and became so\nabsorbed in them that, as Judas thought, he could not be trusted to\ndo sharp, far-seeing business. Thus Judas summed up all the disci-\nples, and flattered himself that the church would often be brought\ninto perplexity and embarrassment if it were not for his ability as a\nmanager. Judas regarded himself as the capable one, who could not\nbe overreached. In his own estimation he was an honor to the cause,\nand as such he always represented himself.\nJudas was blinded to his own weakness of character, and Christ\nplaced him where he would have an opportunity to see and correct\nthis. As treasurer for the disciples, he was called upon to provide\nfor the needs of the little company, and to relieve the necessities of\nthe poor. When in the Passover chamber Jesus said to him, \u201cThat\nthou doest, do quickly\u201d (John 13:27), the disciples thought He had\nbidden him buy what was needed for the feast, or give something [718]\nto the poor. In ministering to others, Judas might have developed\nan unselfish spirit. But while listening daily to the lessons of Christ\nand witnessing His unselfish life, Judas indulged his covetous dis-\n626 The Desire of Ages\nposition. The small sums that came into his hands were a continual\ntemptation. Often when he did a little service for Christ, or devoted\ntime to religious purposes, he paid himself out of this meager fund.\nIn his own eyes these pretexts served to excuse his action; but in\nGod\u2019s sight he was a thief.\nChrist\u2019s oft-repeated statement that His kingdom was not of\nthis world offended Judas. He had marked out a line upon which he\nexpected Christ to work. He had planned that John the Baptist should\nbe delivered from prison. But lo, John was left to be beheaded. And\nJesus, instead of asserting His royal right and avenging the death of\nJohn, retired with His disciples into a country place. Judas wanted\nmore aggressive warfare. He thought that if Jesus would not prevent\nthe disciples from carrying out their schemes, the work would be\nmore successful. He marked the increasing enmity of the Jewish\nleaders, and saw their challenge unheeded when they demanded\nfrom Christ a sign from heaven. His heart was open to unbelief, and\nthe enemy supplied thoughts of questioning and rebellion. Why did\nJesus dwell so much upon that which was discouraging? Why did He\npredict trial and persecution for Himself and for His disciples? The\nprospect of having a high place in the new kingdom had led Judas\nto espouse the cause of Christ. Were his hopes to be disappointed?\nJudas had not decided that Jesus was not the Son of God; but he was\nquestioning, and seeking to find some explanation of His mighty\nworks.\nNotwithstanding the Saviour\u2019s own teaching, Judas was continu-\nally advancing the idea that Christ would reign as king in Jerusalem.\nAt the feeding of the five thousand he tried to bring this about. On\nthis occasion Judas assisted in distributing the food to the hungry\nmultitude. He had an opportunity to see the benefit which it was in\nhis power to impart to others. He felt the satisfaction that always\ncomes in service to God. He helped to bring the sick and suffering\nfrom among the multitude to Christ. He saw what relief, what joy\nand gladness, come to human hearts through the healing power of\nthe Restorer. He might have comprehended the methods of Christ.\nBut he was blinded by his own selfish desires. Judas was first to take\nadvantage of the enthusiasm excited by the miracle of the loaves. It\nwas he who set on foot the project to take Christ by force and make[719]\nHim king. His hopes were high. His disappointment was bitter.\nJudas 627\nChrist\u2019s discourse in the synagogue concerning the bread of life\nwas the turning point in the history of Judas. He heard the words,\n\u201cExcept ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye\nhave no life in you.\u201d John 6:53. He saw that Christ was offering\nspiritual rather than worldly good. He regarded himself as farsighted,\nand thought he could see that Jesus would have no honor, and that He\ncould bestow no high position upon His followers. He determined\nnot to unite himself so closely to Christ but that he could draw away.\nHe would watch. And he did watch.\nFrom that time he expressed doubts that confused the disciples.\nHe introduced controversies and misleading sentiments, repeating\nthe arguments urged by the scribes and Pharisees against the claims\nof Christ. All the little and large troubles and crosses, the difficulties\nand the apparent hindrances to the advancement of the gospel, Judas\ninterpreted as evidences against its truthfulness. He would introduce\ntexts of Scripture that had no connection with the truths Christ was\npresenting. These texts, separated from their connection, perplexed\nthe disciples, and increased the discouragement that was constantly\npressing upon them. Yet all this was done by Judas in such a way\nas to make it appear that he was conscientious. And while the\ndisciples were searching for evidence to confirm the words of the\nGreat Teacher, Judas would lead them almost imperceptibly on\nanother track. Thus in a very religious, and apparently wise, way he\nwas presenting matters in a different light from that in which Jesus\nhad given them, and attaching to His words a meaning that He had\nnot conveyed. His suggestions were constantly exciting an ambitious\ndesire for temporal preferment, and thus turning the disciples from\nthe important things they should have considered. The dissension as\nto which of them should be greatest was generally excited by Judas.\nWhen Jesus presented to the rich young ruler the condition of\ndiscipleship, Judas was displeased. He thought that a mistake had\nbeen made. If such men as this ruler could be connected with the\nbelievers, they would help sustain Christ\u2019s cause. If Judas were only\nreceived as a counselor, he thought, he could suggest many plans\nfor the advantage of the little church. His principles and methods\nwould differ somewhat from Christ\u2019s, but in these things he thought\nhimself wiser than Christ.\nIn all that Christ said to His disciples, there was something with [720]\n628 The Desire of Ages\nwhich, in heart, Judas disagreed. Under his influence the leaven of\ndisaffection was fast doing its work. The disciples did not see the\nreal agency in all this; but Jesus saw that Satan was communicating\nhis attributes to Judas, and thus opening up a channel through which\nto influence the other disciples. This, a year before the betrayal,\nChrist declared. \u201cHave not I chosen you twelve,\u201d He said, \u201cand one\nof you is a devil?\u201d John 6:70.\nYet Judas made no open opposition, nor seemed to question the\nSaviour\u2019s lessons. He made no outward murmur until the time of\nthe feast in Simon\u2019s house. When Mary anointed the Saviour\u2019s feet,\nJudas manifested his covetous disposition. At the reproof from Jesus\nhis very spirit seemed turned to gall. Wounded pride and desire for\nrevenge broke down the barriers, and the greed so long indulged\nheld him in control. This will be the experience of everyone who\npersists in tampering with sin. The elements of depravity that are\nnot resisted and overcome, respond to Satan\u2019s temptation, and the\nsoul is led captive at his will.\nBut Judas was not yet wholly hardened. Even after he had twice\npledged himself to betray the Saviour, there was opportunity for\nrepentance. At the Passover supper Jesus proved His divinity by\nrevealing the traitor\u2019s purpose. He tenderly included Judas in the\nministry to the disciples. But the last appeal of love was unheeded.\nThen the case of Judas was decided, and the feet that Jesus had\nwashed went forth to the betrayer\u2019s work.\nJudas reasoned that if Jesus was to be crucified, the event must\ncome to pass. His own act in betraying the Saviour would not change\nthe result. If Jesus was not to die, it would only force Him to deliver\nHimself. At all events, Judas would gain something by his treachery.\nHe counted that he had made a sharp bargain in betraying his Lord.\nJudas did not, however, believe that Christ would permit Himself\nto be arrested. In betraying Him, it was his purpose to teach Him\na lesson. He intended to play a part that would make the Saviour\ncareful thenceforth to treat him with due respect. But Judas knew\nnot that he was giving Christ up to death. How often, as the Saviour\ntaught in parables, the scribes and Pharisees had been carried away\nwith His striking illustrations! How often they had pronounced\njudgment against themselves! Often when the truth was brought\nhome to their hearts, they had been filled with rage, and had taken up\nJudas 629\nstones to cast at Him; but again and again He had made His escape. [721]\nSince He had escaped so many snares, thought Judas, He certainly\nwould not now allow Himself to be taken.\nJudas decided to put the matter to the test. If Jesus really was\nthe Messiah, the people, for whom He had done so much, would\nrally about Him, and would proclaim Him king. This would forever\nsettle many minds that were now in uncertainty. Judas would have\nthe credit of having placed the king on David\u2019s throne. And this\nact would secure to him the first position, next to Christ, in the new\nkingdom.\nThe false disciple acted his part in betraying Jesus. In the garden,\nwhen he said to the leaders of the mob, \u201cWhomsoever I shall kiss,\nthat same is He: hold Him fast\u201d (Matthew 26:48), he fully believed\nthat Christ would escape out of their hands. Then if they should\nblame him, he could say, Did I not tell you to hold Him fast?\nJudas beheld the captors of Christ, acting upon his words, bind\nHim firmly. In amazement he saw that the Saviour suffered Himself\nto be led away. Anxiously he followed Him from the garden to the\ntrial before the Jewish rulers. At every movement he looked for Him\nto surprise His enemies, by appearing before them as the Son of\nGod, and setting at nought all their plots and power. But as hour\nafter hour went by, and Jesus submitted to all the abuse heaped upon\nHim, a terrible fear came to the traitor that he had sold his Master to\nHis death.\nAs the trial drew to a close, Judas could endure the torture of his\nguilty conscience no longer. Suddenly a hoarse voice rang through\nthe hall, sending a thrill of terror to all hearts: He is innocent; spare\nHim, O Caiaphas!\nThe tall form of Judas was now seen pressing through the startled\nthrong. His face was pale and haggard, and great drops of sweat\nstood on his forehead. Rushing to the throne of judgment, he threw\ndown before the high priest the pieces of silver that had been the [722]\nprice of his Lord\u2019s betrayal. Eagerly grasping the robe of Caiaphas,\nhe implored him to release Jesus, declaring that He had done nothing\nworthy of death. Caiaphas angrily shook him off, but was confused,\nand knew not what to say. The perfidy of the priests was revealed. It\nwas evident that they had bribed the disciple to betray his Master.\n630 The Desire of Ages\n\u201cI have sinned,\u201d again cried Judas, \u201cin that I have betrayed the\ninnocent blood.\u201d But the high priest, regaining his self-possession,\nanswered with scorn, \u201cWhat is that to us? see thou to that.\u201d Matthew\n27:4. The priests had been willing to make Judas their tool; but they\ndespised his baseness. When he turned to them with confession,\nthey spurned him.\nJudas now cast himself at the feet of Jesus, acknowledging Him\nto be the Son of God, and entreating Him to deliver Himself. The\nSaviour did not reproach His betrayer. He knew that Judas did not\nrepent; his confession was forced from his guilty soul by an awful\nsense of condemnation and a looking for of judgment, but he felt no\ndeep, heartbreaking grief that he had betrayed the spotless Son of\nGod, and denied the Holy One of Israel. Yet Jesus spoke no word of\ncondemnation. He looked pityingly upon Judas, and said, For this\nhour came I into the world.\nA murmur of surprise ran through the assembly. With amazement\nthey beheld the forbearance of Christ toward His betrayer. Again\nthere swept over them the conviction that this Man was more than\nmortal. But if He was the Son of God, they questioned, why did He\nnot free Himself from His bonds and triumph over His accusers?\nJudas saw that his entreaties were in vain, and he rushed from\nthe hall exclaiming, It is too late! It is too late! He felt that he could\nnot live to see Jesus crucified, and in despair went out and hanged\nhimself.\nLater that same day, on the road from Pilate\u2019s hall to Calvary,\nthere came an interruption to the shouts and jeers of the wicked\nthrong who were leading Jesus to the place of crucifixion. As they\npassed a retired spot, they saw at the foot of a lifeless tree, the body\nof Judas. It was a most revolting sight. His weight had broken the\ncord by which he had hanged himself to the tree. In falling, his\nbody had been horribly mangled, and dogs were now devouring it.\nHis remains were immediately buried out of sight; but there was\nless mockery among the throng, and many a pale face revealed the\nthoughts within. Retribution seemed already visiting those who\nwere guilty of the blood of Jesus.\nChapter 77\u2014In Pilate\u2019s Judgment Hall [723]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 27:2, 11-31; Mark 15:1-20; Luke\n23:1-25; John 18:28-40; John 19:1-16\nIn the judgment hall of Pilate, the Roman governor, Christ stands\nbound as a prisoner. About Him are the guard of soldiers, and the\nhall is fast filling with spectators. Just outside the entrance are the\njudges of the Sanhedrin, priests, rulers, elders, and the mob.\nAfter condemning Jesus, the council of the Sanhedrin had come\nto Pilate to have the sentence confirmed and executed. But these\nJewish officials would not enter the Roman judgment hall. Accord-\ning to their ceremonial law they would be defiled thereby, and thus\nprevented from taking part in the feast of the Passover. In their\nblindness they did not see that murderous hatred had defiled their\nhearts. They did not see that Christ was the real Passover lamb, and\nthat, since they had rejected Him, the great feast had for them lost\nits significance.\nWhen the Saviour was brought into the judgment hall, Pilate\nlooked upon Him with no friendly eyes. The Roman governor had\nbeen called from his bedchamber in haste, and he determined to do\nhis work as quickly as possible. He was prepared to deal with the\nprisoner with magisterial severity. Assuming his severest expression, [724]\nhe turned to see what kind of man he had to examine, that he had\nbeen called from his repose at so early an hour. He knew that it must\nbe someone whom the Jewish authorities were anxious to have tried\nand punished with haste.\nPilate looked at the men who had Jesus in charge, and then his\ngaze rested searchingly on Jesus. He had had to deal with all kinds\nof criminals; but never before had a man bearing marks of such\ngoodness and nobility been brought before him. On His face he saw\nno sign of guilt, no expression of fear, no boldness or defiance. He\nsaw a man of calm and dignified bearing, whose countenance bore\nnot the marks of a criminal, but the signature of heaven.\n631\n632 The Desire of Ages\nChrist\u2019s appearance made a favorable impression upon Pilate.\nHis better nature was roused. He had heard of Jesus and His works.\nHis wife had told him something of the wonderful deeds performed\nby the Galilean prophet, who cured the sick and raised the dead.\nNow this revived as a dream in Pilate\u2019s mind. He recalled rumors\nthat he had heard from several sources. He resolved to demand of\nthe Jews their charges against the prisoner.\nWho is this Man, and wherefore have ye brought Him? he said.\nWhat accusation bring ye against Him? The Jews were disconcerted.\nKnowing that they could not substantiate their charges against Christ,\nthey did not desire a public examination. They answered that He\nwas a deceiver called Jesus of Nazareth.\nAgain Pilate asked, \u201cWhat accusation bring ye against this Man?\u201d\nThe priests did not answer his question, but in words that showed\ntheir irritation, they said, \u201cIf He were not a malefactor, we would\nnot have delivered Him up unto thee.\u201d When those composing the\nSanhedrin, the first men of the nation, bring to you a man they deem\nworthy of death, is there need to ask for an accusation against him?\nThey hoped to impress Pilate with a sense of their importance, and\nthus lead him to accede to their request without going through many\npreliminaries. They were eager to have their sentence ratified; for\nthey knew that the people who had witnessed Christ\u2019s marvelous\nworks could tell a story very different from the fabrication they\nthemselves were now rehearsing.\nThe priests thought that with the weak and vacillating Pilate\nthey could carry through their plans without trouble. Before this\nhe had signed the death warrant hastily, condemning to death men\nthey knew were not worthy of death. In his estimation the life of a\nprisoner was of little account; whether he were innocent or guilty[725]\nwas of no special consequence. The priests hoped that Pilate would\nnow inflict the death penalty on Jesus without giving Him a hearing.\nThis they besought as a favor on the occasion of their great national\nfestival.\nBut there was something in the prisoner that held Pilate back\nfrom this. He dared not do it. He read the purposes of the priests. He\nremembered how, not long before, Jesus had raised Lazarus, a man\nthat had been dead four days; and he determined to know, before\nIn Pilate\u2019s Judgment Hall 633\nsigning the sentence of condemnation, what were the charges against\nHim, and whether they could be proved.\nIf your judgment is sufficient, he said, why bring the prisoner\nto me? \u201cTake ye Him, and judge Him according to your law.\u201d\nThus pressed, the priests said that they had already passed sentence\nupon Him, but that they must have Pilate\u2019s sentence to render their\ncondemnation valid. What is your sentence? Pilate asked. The death\nsentence, they answered; but it is not lawful for us to put any man\nto death. They asked Pilate to take their word as to Christ\u2019s guilt,\nand enforce their sentence. They would take the responsibility of\nthe result.\nPilate was not a just or a conscientious judge; but weak though\nhe was in moral power, he refused to grant this request. He would\nnot condemn Jesus until a charge had been brought against Him.\nThe priests were in a dilemma. They saw that they must cloak\ntheir hypocrisy under the thickest concealment. They must not\nallow it to appear that Christ had been arrested on religious grounds.\nWere this put forward as a reason, their proceedings would have no\nweight with Pilate. They must make it appear that Jesus was working\nagainst the common law; then He could be punished as a political\noffender. Tumults and insurrection against the Roman government\nwere constantly arising among the Jews. With these revolts the\nRomans had dealt very rigorously, and they were constantly on the\nwatch to repress everything that could lead to an outbreak.\nOnly a few days before this the Pharisees had tried to entrap\nChrist with the question, \u201cIs it lawful for us to give tribute unto\nCaesar?\u201d But Christ had unveiled their hypocrisy. The Romans\nwho were present had seen the utter failure of the plotters, and their\ndiscomfiture at His answer, \u201cRender therefore unto Caesar the things\nwhich be Caesar\u2019s.\u201d Luke 20:22-25.\nNow the priests thought to make it appear that on this occasion\nChrist had taught what they hoped He would teach. In their ex- [726]\ntremity they called false witnesses to their aid, \u201cand they began to\naccuse Him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and\nforbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ\na King.\u201d Three charges, each without foundation. The priests knew\nthis, but they were willing to commit perjury could they but secure\ntheir end.\n634 The Desire of Ages\nPilate saw through their purpose. He did not believe that the\nprisoner had plotted against the government. His meek and humble\nappearance was altogether out of harmony with the charge. Pilate\nwas convinced that a deep plot had been laid to destroy an innocent\nman who stood in the way of the Jewish dignitaries. Turning to Jesus\nhe asked, \u201cArt Thou the King of the Jews?\u201d The Saviour answered,\n\u201cThou sayest it.\u201d And as He spoke, His countenance lighted up as if\na sunbeam were shining upon it.\nWhen they heard His answer, Caiaphas and those that were with\nhim called Pilate to witness that Jesus had admitted the crime with\nwhich He was charged. With noisy cries, priests, scribes, and rulers\ndemanded that He be sentenced to death. The cries were taken up\nby the mob, and the uproar was deafening. Pilate was confused.\nSeeing that Jesus made no answer to His accusers, Pilate said to Him,\n\u201cAnswerest Thou nothing? behold how many things they witness\nagainst Thee. But Jesus yet answered nothing.\u201d\nStanding behind Pilate, in view of all in the court, Christ heard\nthe abuse; but to all the false charges against Him He answered not\na word. His whole bearing gave evidence of conscious innocence.\nHe stood unmoved by the fury of the waves that beat about Him. It\nwas as if the heavy surges of wrath, rising higher and higher, like the\nwaves of the boisterous ocean, broke about Him, but did not touch\nHim. He stood silent, but His silence was eloquence. It was as a\nlight shining from the inner to the outer man.\nPilate was astonished at His bearing. Does this Man disregard\nthe proceedings because He does not care to save His life? he asked\nhimself. As he looked at Jesus, bearing insult and mockery without\nretaliation, he felt that He could not be as unrighteous and unjust as\nwere the clamoring priests. Hoping to gain the truth from Him and\nto escape the tumult of the crowd, Pilate took Jesus aside with him,\nand again questioned, \u201cArt Thou the King of the Jews?\u201d\nJesus did not directly answer this question. He knew that the\nHoly Spirit was striving with Pilate, and He gave him opportunity[727]\nto acknowledge his conviction. \u201cSayest thou this thing of thyself,\u201d\nHe asked, \u201cor did others tell it thee of Me?\u201d That is, was it the\naccusations of the priests, or a desire to receive light from Christ, that\nprompted Pilate\u2019s question? Pilate understood Christ\u2019s meaning; but\npride arose in his heart. He would not acknowledge the conviction\nIn Pilate\u2019s Judgment Hall 635\nthat pressed upon him. \u201cAm I a Jew?\u201d he said. \u201cThine own nation\nand the chief priests have delivered Thee unto me: what hast Thou\ndone?\u201d\nPilate\u2019s golden opportunity had passed. Yet Jesus did not leave\nhim without further light. While He did not directly answer Pilate\u2019s\nquestion, He plainly stated His own mission. He gave Pilate to\nunderstand that He was not seeking an earthly throne.\n\u201cMy kingdom is not of this world,\u201d He said; \u201cif My kingdom\nwere of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be\ndelivered to the Jews: but now is My kingdom not from hence. Pilate\ntherefore said unto Him, Art Thou a king then? Jesus answered,\nThou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this\ncause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.\nEveryone that is of the truth heareth My voice.\u201d\nChrist affirmed that His word was in itself a key which would\nunlock the mystery to those who were prepared to receive it. It had\na self-commending power, and this was the secret of the spread of\nHis kingdom of truth. He desired Pilate to understand that only by\nreceiving and appropriating truth could his ruined nature be recon-\nstructed.\nPilate had a desire to know the truth. His mind was confused. He\neagerly grasped the words of the Saviour, and his heart was stirred\nwith a great longing to know what it really was, and how he could\nobtain it. \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d he inquired. But he did not wait for an\nanswer. The tumult outside recalled him to the interests of the hour;\nfor the priests were clamorous for immediate action. Going out to\nthe Jews, he declared emphatically, \u201cI find in Him no fault at all.\u201d\nThese words from a heathen judge were a scathing rebuke to\nthe perfidy and falsehood of the rulers of Israel who were accusing\nthe Saviour. As the priests and elders heard this from Pilate, their\ndisappointment and rage knew no bounds. They had long plotted\nand waited for this opportunity. As they saw the prospect of the\nrelease of Jesus, they seemed ready to tear Him in pieces. They\nloudly denounced Pilate, and threatened him with the censure of\nthe Roman government. They accused him of refusing to condemn [728]\nJesus, who, they affirmed, had set Himself up against Caesar.\nAngry voices were now heard, declaring that the seditious influ-\nence of Jesus was well known throughout the country. The priests\n636 The Desire of Ages\nsaid, \u201cHe stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, be-\nginning from Galilee to this place.\u201d\nPilate at this time had no thought of condemning Jesus. He knew\nthat the Jews had accused Him through hatred and prejudice. He\nknew what his duty was. Justice demanded that Christ should be\nimmediately released. But Pilate dreaded the ill will of the people.\nShould he refuse to give Jesus into their hands, a tumult would be\nraised, and this he feared to meet. When he heard that Christ was\nfrom Galilee, he decided to send Him to Herod, the ruler of that\nprovince, who was then in Jerusalem. By this course, Pilate thought\nto shift the responsibility of the trial from himself to Herod. He\nalso thought this a good opportunity to heal an old quarrel between\nhimself and Herod. And so it proved. The two magistrates made\nfriends over the trial of the Saviour.\nPilate delivered Jesus again to the soldiers, and amid the jeers\nand insults of the mob He was hurried to the judgment hall of Herod.\n\u201cWhen Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad.\u201d He had never\nbefore met the Saviour, but \u201che was desirous to see Him of a long\nseason, because he had heard many things of Him; and he hoped to\nhave seen some miracle done by Him.\u201d This Herod was he whose\nhands were stained with the blood of John the Baptist. When Herod\nfirst heard of Jesus, he was terror-stricken, and said, \u201cIt is John,\nwhom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead;\u201d \u201ctherefore mighty[729]\nworks do show forth themselves in him.\u201d Mark 6:16; Matthew 14:2.\nYet Herod desired to see Jesus. Now there was opportunity to save\nthe life of this prophet, and the king hoped to banish forever from his\nmind the memory of that bloody head brought to him in a charger.\nHe also desired to have his curiosity gratified, and thought that if\nChrist were given any prospect of release, He would do anything\nthat was asked of Him.\nA large company of the priests and elders had accompanied\nChrist to Herod. And when the Saviour was brought in, these digni-\ntaries, all speaking excitedly, urged their accusations against Him.\nBut Herod paid little regard to their charges. He commanded silence,\ndesiring an opportunity to question Christ. He ordered that the fet-\nters of Christ should be unloosed, at the same time charging His\nenemies with roughly treating Him. Looking with compassion into\nthe serene face of the world\u2019s Redeemer, he read in it only wisdom\nIn Pilate\u2019s Judgment Hall 637\nand purity. He as well as Pilate was satisfied that Christ had been\naccused through malice and envy.\nHerod questioned Christ in many words, but throughout the\nSaviour maintained a profound silence. At the command of the king,\nthe decrepit and maimed were then called in, and Christ was ordered\nto prove His claims by working a miracle. Men say that Thou canst\nheal the sick, said Herod. I am anxious to see that Thy widespread\nfame has not been belied. Jesus did not respond, and Herod still\ncontinued to urge: If Thou canst work miracles for others, work them\nnow for Thine own good, and it will serve Thee a good purpose.\nAgain he commanded, Show us a sign that Thou hast the power with\nwhich rumor hath accredited Thee. But Christ was as one who heard\nand saw not. The Son of God had taken upon Himself man\u2019s nature.\nHe must do as man must do in like circumstances. Therefore He\nwould not work a miracle to save Himself the pain and humiliation\nthat man must endure when placed in a similar position.\nHerod promised that if Christ would perform some miracle in\nhis presence, He should be released. Christ\u2019s accusers had seen with\ntheir own eyes the mighty works wrought by His power. They had\nheard Him command the grave to give up its dead. They had seen\nthe dead come forth obedient to His voice. Fear seized them lest\nHe should now work a miracle. Of all things they most dreaded\nan exhibition of His power. Such a manifestation would prove a\ndeathblow to their plans, and would perhaps cost them their lives. [730]\nAgain the priests and rulers, in great anxiety, urged their accusations\nagainst Him. Raising their voices, they declared, He is a traitor, a\nblasphemer. He works His miracles through the power given Him\nby Beelzebub, the prince of the devils. The hall became a scene of\nconfusion, some crying one thing and some another.\nHerod\u2019s conscience was now far less sensitive than when he had\ntrembled with horror at the request of Herodias for the head of John\nthe Baptist. For a time he had felt the keen stings of remorse for\nhis terrible act; but his moral perceptions had become more and\nmore degraded by his licentious life. Now his heart had become so\nhardened that he could even boast of the punishment he had inflicted\nupon John for daring to reprove him. And he now threatened Jesus,\ndeclaring repeatedly that he had power to release or to condemn\nHim. But no sign from Jesus gave evidence that He heard a word.\n638 The Desire of Ages\nHerod was irritated by this silence. It seemed to indicate utter\nindifference to his authority. To the vain and pompous king, open\nrebuke would have been less offensive than to be thus ignored. Again\nhe angrily threatened Jesus, who still remained unmoved and silent.\nThe mission of Christ in this world was not to gratify idle cu-\nriosity. He came to heal the brokenhearted. Could He have spoken\nany word to heal the bruises of sin-sick souls, He would not have\nkept silent. But He had no words for those who would but trample\nthe truth under their unholy feet.\nChrist might have spoken words to Herod that would have\npierced the ears of the hardened king. He might have stricken him\nwith fear and trembling by laying before him the full iniquity of his\nlife, and the horror of his approaching doom. But Christ\u2019s silence\nwas the severest rebuke that He could have given. Herod had rejected\nthe truth spoken to him by the greatest of the prophets, and no other\nmessage was he to receive. Not a word had the Majesty of heaven\nfor him. That ear that had ever been open to human woe, had no\nroom for Herod\u2019s commands. Those eyes that had ever rested upon\nthe penitent sinner in pitying, forgiving love had no look to bestow\nupon Herod. Those lips that had uttered the most impressive truth,\nthat in tones of tenderest entreaty had pleaded with the most sinful\nand the most degraded, were closed to the haughty king who felt no\nneed of a Saviour.\nHerod\u2019s face grew dark with passion. Turning to the multitude,\nhe angrily denounced Jesus as an impostor. Then to Christ he said,[731]\nIf You will give no evidence of Your claim, I will deliver You up to\nthe soldiers and the people. They may succeed in making You speak.\nIf You are an impostor, death at their hands is only what You merit;\nif You are the Son of God, save Yourself by working a miracle.\nNo sooner were these words spoken than a rush was made for\nChrist. Like wild beasts, the crowd darted upon their prey. Jesus\nwas dragged this way and that, Herod joining the mob in seeking to\nhumiliate the Son of God. Had not the Roman soldiers interposed,\nand forced back the maddened throng, the Saviour would have been\ntorn in pieces.\n\u201cHerod with his men of war set Him at nought, and mocked Him,\nand arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe.\u201d The Roman soldiers joined\nin this abuse. All that these wicked, corrupt soldiers, helped on by\nIn Pilate\u2019s Judgment Hall 639\nHerod and the Jewish dignitaries, could instigate was heaped upon\nthe Saviour. Yet His divine patience failed not.\nChrist\u2019s persecutors had tried to measure His character by their\nown; they had represented Him as vile as themselves. But back of all\nthe present appearance another scene intruded itself,\u2014a scene which\nthey will one day see in all its glory. There were some who trembled\nin Christ\u2019s presence. While the rude throng were bowing in mockery\nbefore Him, some who came forward for that purpose turned back,\nafraid and silenced. Herod was convicted. The last rays of merciful\nlight were shining upon his sin-hardened heart. He felt that this was\nno common man; for divinity had flashed through humanity. At the\nvery time when Christ was encompassed by mockers, adulterers,\nand murderers, Herod felt that he was beholding a God upon His\nthrone.\nHardened as he was, Herod dared not ratify the condemnation\nof Christ. He wished to relieve himself of the terrible responsibility,\nand he sent Jesus back to the Roman judgment hall.\nPilate was disappointed and much displeased. When the Jews\nreturned with their prisoner, he asked impatiently what they would\nhave him do. He reminded them that he had already examined\nJesus, and found no fault in Him; he told them that they had brought\ncomplaints against Him, but they had not been able to prove a single\ncharge. He had sent Jesus to Herod, the tetrarch of Galilee, and one\nof their own nation, but he also had found in Him nothing worthy\nof death. \u201cI will therefore chastise Him,\u201d Pilate said, \u201cand release\nHim.\u201d\nHere Pilate showed his weakness. He had declared that Jesus\nwas innocent, yet he was willing for Him to be scourged to pacify [732]\nHis accusers. He would sacrifice justice and principle in order to\ncompromise with the mob. This placed him at a disadvantage. The\ncrowd presumed upon his indecision, and clamored the more for the\nlife of the prisoner. If at the first Pilate had stood firm, refusing to\ncondemn a man whom he found guiltless, he would have broken the\nfatal chain that was to bind him in remorse and guilt as long as he\nlived. Had he carried out his convictions of right, the Jews would\nnot have presumed to dictate to him. Christ would have been put to\ndeath, but the guilt would not have rested upon Pilate. But Pilate\nhad taken step after step in the violation of his conscience. He had\n640 The Desire of Ages\nexcused himself from judging with justice and equity, and he now\nfound himself almost helpless in the hands of the priests and rulers.\nHis wavering and indecision proved his ruin.\nEven now Pilate was not left to act blindly. A message from God\nwarned him from the deed he was about to commit. In answer to\nChrist\u2019s prayer, the wife of Pilate had been visited by an angel from\nheaven, and in a dream she had beheld the Saviour and conversed\nwith Him. Pilate\u2019s wife was not a Jew, but as she looked upon Jesus\nin her dream, she had no doubt of His character or mission. She\nknew Him to be the Prince of God. She saw Him on trial in the\njudgment hall. She saw the hands tightly bound as the hands of a\ncriminal. She saw Herod and his soldiers doing their dreadful work.\nShe heard the priests and rulers, filled with envy and malice, madly\naccusing. She heard the words, \u201cWe have a law, and by our law He\nought to die.\u201d She saw Pilate give Jesus to the scourging, after he\nhad declared, \u201cI find no fault in Him.\u201d She heard the condemnation\npronounced by Pilate, and saw him give Christ up to His murderers.\nShe saw the cross uplifted on Calvary. She saw the earth wrapped in\ndarkness, and heard the mysterious cry, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d Still another\nscene met her gaze. She saw Christ seated upon the great white\ncloud, while the earth reeled in space, and His murderers fled from\nthe presence of His glory. With a cry of horror she awoke, and at\nonce wrote to Pilate words of warning.\nWhile Pilate was hesitating as to what he should do, a messenger\npressed through the crowd, and handed him the letter from his wife,\nwhich read:\n\u201cHave thou nothing to do with that just Man: for I have suffered\nmany things this day in a dream because of Him.\u201d\nPilate\u2019s face grew pale. He was confused by his own conflicting[733]\nemotions. But while he had been delaying to act, the priests and\nrulers were still further inflaming the minds of the people. Pilate\nwas forced to action. He now bethought himself of a custom which\nmight serve to secure Christ\u2019s release. It was customary at this feast\nto release some one prisoner whom the people might choose. This\ncustom was of pagan invention; there was not a shadow of justice in\nit, but it was greatly prized by the Jews. The Roman authorities at\nthis time held a prisoner named Barabbas, who was under sentence\nof death. This man had claimed to be the Messiah. He claimed\nIn Pilate\u2019s Judgment Hall 641\nauthority to establish a different order of things, to set the world\nright. Under satanic delusion he claimed that whatever he could\nobtain by theft and robbery was his own. He had done wonderful\nthings through satanic agencies, he had gained a following among\nthe people, and had excited sedition against the Roman government.\nUnder cover of religious enthusiasm he was a hardened and desperate\nvillain, bent on rebellion and cruelty. By giving the people a choice\nbetween this man and the innocent Saviour, Pilate thought to arouse\nthem to a sense of justice. He hoped to gain their sympathy for Jesus\nin opposition to the priests and rulers. So, turning to the crowd, he\nsaid with great earnestness, \u201cWhom will ye that I release unto you?\nBarabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?\u201d\nLike the bellowing of wild beasts came the answer of the mob,\n\u201cRelease unto us Barabbas!\u201d Louder and louder swelled the cry,\nBarabbas! Barabbas! Thinking that the people had not understood\nhis question, Pilate asked, \u201cWill ye that I release unto you the King\nof the Jews?\u201d But they cried out again, \u201cAway with this Man, and\nrelease unto us Barabbas\u201d! \u201cWhat shall I do then with Jesus which is\ncalled Christ?\u201d Pilate asked. Again the surging multitude roared like\ndemons. Demons themselves, in human form, were in the crowd,\nand what could be expected but the answer, \u201cLet Him be crucified\u201d?\nPilate was troubled. He had not thought it would come to that.\nHe shrank from delivering an innocent man to the most ignominious\nand cruel death that could be inflicted. After the roar of voices had\nceased, he turned to the people, saying, \u201cWhy, what evil hath He\ndone?\u201d But the case had gone too far for argument. It was not evi-\ndence of Christ\u2019s innocence that they wanted, but His condemnation.\nStill Pilate endeavored to save Him. \u201cHe said unto them the\nthird time, Why, what evil hath He done? I have found no cause of\ndeath in Him: I will therefore chastise Him, and let Him go.\u201d But [734]\nthe very mention of His release stirred the people to a tenfold frenzy.\n\u201cCrucify Him, crucify Him,\u201d they cried. Louder and louder swelled\nthe storm that Pilate\u2019s indecision had called forth.\nJesus was taken, faint with weariness and covered with wounds,\nand scourged in the sight of the multitude. \u201cAnd the soldiers led\nHim away into the hall, called Praetorium, and they call together the\nwhole band. And they clothed Him with purple, and platted a crown\nof thorns, and put it about His head, and began to salute Him, Hail,\n642 The Desire of Ages\nKing of the Jews! And they ... did spit upon Him, and bowing their\nknees worshiped Him.\u201d Occasionally some wicked hand snatched\nthe reed that had been placed in His hand, and struck the crown upon\nHis brow, forcing the thorns into His temples, and sending the blood\ntrickling down His face and beard.\nWonder, O heavens! and be astonished, O earth! Behold the op-\npressor and the oppressed. A maddened throng enclose the Saviour\nof the world. Mocking and jeering are mingled with the coarse oaths\nof blasphemy. His lowly birth and humble life are commented upon\nby the unfeeling mob. His claim to be the Son of God is ridiculed,\nand the vulgar jest and insulting sneer are passed from lip to lip.\nSatan led the cruel mob in its abuse of the Saviour. It was his\npurpose to provoke Him to retaliation if possible, or to drive Him\nto perform a miracle to release Himself, and thus break up the plan\nof salvation. One stain upon His human life, one failure of His\nhumanity to endure the terrible test, and the Lamb of God would\nhave been an imperfect offering, and the redemption of man a failure.\nBut He who by a command could bring the heavenly host to His\naid\u2014He who could have driven that mob in terror from His sight\nby the flashing forth of His divine majesty\u2014submitted with perfect\ncalmness to the coarsest insult and outrage.\nChrist\u2019s enemies had demanded a miracle as evidence of His\ndivinity. They had evidence far greater than any they had sought.\nAs their cruelty degraded His torturers below humanity into the\nlikeness of Satan, so did His meekness and patience exalt Jesus\nabove humanity, and prove His kinship to God. His abasement was\nthe pledge of His exaltation. The blood drops of agony that from His\nwounded temples flowed down His face and beard were the pledge\nof His anointing with \u201cthe oil of gladness\u201d (Hebrews 1:9.) as our\ngreat high priest.\nSatan\u2019s rage was great as he saw that all the abuse inflicted upon[735]\nthe Saviour had not forced the least murmur from His lips. Although\nHe had taken upon Him the nature of man, He was sustained by a\ngodlike fortitude, and departed in no particular from the will of His\nFather.\nWhen Pilate gave Jesus up to be scourged and mocked, he\nthought to excite the pity of the multitude. He hoped they would\ndecide that this was sufficient punishment. Even the malice of the\nIn Pilate\u2019s Judgment Hall 643\npriests, he thought, would now be satisfied. But with keen percep-\ntion the Jews saw the weakness of thus punishing a man who had\nbeen declared innocent. They knew that Pilate was trying to save\nthe life of the prisoner, and they were determined that Jesus should\nnot be released. To please and satisfy us, Pilate has scourged Him,\nthey thought, and if we press the matter to a decided issue, we shall\nsurely gain our end.\nPilate now sent for Barabbas to be brought into the court. He\nthen presented the two prisoners side by side, and pointing to the\nSaviour he said in a voice of solemn entreaty, \u201cBehold the Man!\u201d\n\u201cI bring Him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in\nHim.\u201d\nThere stood the Son of God, wearing the robe of mockery and\nthe crown of thorns. Stripped to the waist, His back showed the\nlong, cruel stripes, from which the blood flowed freely. His face\nwas stained with blood, and bore the marks of exhaustion and pain;\nbut never had it appeared more beautiful than now. The Saviour\u2019s\nvisage was not marred before His enemies. Every feature expressed\ngentleness and resignation and the tenderest pity for His cruel foes.\nIn His manner there was no cowardly weakness, but the strength and\ndignity of long-suffering. In striking contrast was the prisoner at His\nside. Every line of the countenance of Barabbas proclaimed him the\nhardened ruffian that he was. The contrast spoke to every beholder.\nSome of the spectators were weeping. As they looked upon Jesus,\ntheir hearts were full of sympathy. Even the priests and rulers were\nconvicted that He was all that He claimed to be.\nThe Roman soldiers that surrounded Christ were not all hard-\nened; some were looking earnestly into His face for one evidence\nthat He was a criminal or dangerous character. From time to time\nthey would turn and cast a look of contempt upon Barabbas. It\nneeded no deep insight to read him through and through. Again\nthey would turn to the One upon trial. They looked at the divine\nsufferer with feelings of deep pity. The silent submission of Christ\nstamped upon their minds the scene, never to be effaced until they [736]\neither acknowledged Him as the Christ, or by rejecting Him decided\ntheir own destiny.\nPilate was filled with amazement at the uncomplaining patience\nof the Saviour. He did not doubt that the sight of this Man, in contrast\n644 The Desire of Ages\nwith Barabbas, would move the Jews to sympathy. But he did not\nunderstand the fanatical hatred of the priests for Him, who, as the\nLight of the world, had made manifest their darkness and error.\nThey had moved the mob to a mad fury, and again priests, rulers,\nand people raised that awful cry, \u201cCrucify Him, crucify Him.\u201d At\nlast, losing all patience with their unreasoning cruelty, Pilate cried\nout despairingly, \u201cTake ye Him, and crucify Him: for I find no fault\nin Him.\u201d\nThe Roman governor, though familiar with cruel scenes, was\nmoved with sympathy for the suffering prisoner, who, condemned\nand scourged, with bleeding brow and lacerated back, still had the\nbearing of a king upon his throne. But the priests declared, \u201cWe have\na law, and by our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the\nSon of God.\u201d\nPilate was startled. He had no correct idea of Christ and His\nmission; but he had an indistinct faith in God and in beings superior\nto humanity. A thought that had once before passed through his\nmind now took more definite shape. He questioned whether it might\nnot be a divine being that stood before him, clad in the purple robe\nof mockery, and crowned with thorns.\nAgain he went into the judgment hall, and said to Jesus, \u201cWhence\nart Thou?\u201d But Jesus gave him no answer. The Saviour had spoken\nfreely to Pilate, explaining His own mission as a witness to the truth.\nPilate had disregarded the light. He had abused the high office of\njudge by yielding his principles and authority to the demands of the\nmob. Jesus had no further light for him. Vexed at His silence, Pilate\nsaid haughtily:\n\u201cSpeakest Thou not unto me? knowest Thou not that I have\npower to crucify Thee, and have power to release Thee?\u201d\nJesus answered, \u201cThou couldest have no power at all against Me,\nexcept it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered Me\nunto thee hath the greater sin.\u201d\nThus the pitying Saviour, in the midst of His intense suffering\nand grief, excused as far as possible the act of the Roman governor\nwho gave Him up to be crucified. What a scene was this to hand\ndown to the world for all time! What a light it sheds upon the\ncharacter of Him who is the Judge of all the earth!\n\u201cHe that delivered Me unto thee,\u201d said Jesus, \u201chath the greater[737]\nIn Pilate\u2019s Judgment Hall 645\nsin.\u201d By this Christ meant Caiaphas, who, as high priest, represented\nthe Jewish nation. They knew the principles that controlled the\nRoman authorities. They had had light in the prophecies that testified\nof Christ, and in His own teachings and miracles. The Jewish judges\nhad received unmistakable evidence of the divinity of Him whom\nthey condemned to death. And according to their light would they\nbe judged.\nThe greatest guilt and heaviest responsibility belonged to those\nwho stood in the highest places in the nation, the depositaries of\nsacred trusts that they were basely betraying. Pilate, Herod, and the\nRoman soldiers were comparatively ignorant of Jesus. They thought\nto please the priests and rulers by abusing Him. They had not the\nlight which the Jewish nation had so abundantly received. Had the\nlight been given to the soldiers, they would not have treated Christ\nas cruelly as they did.\nAgain Pilate proposed to release the Saviour. \u201cBut the Jews cried\nout, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar\u2019s friend.\u201d\nThus these hypocrites pretended to be jealous for the authority of\nCaesar. Of all the opponents of the Roman rule, the Jews were most\nbitter. When it was safe for them to do so, they were most tyrannical\nin enforcing their own national and religious requirements; but when\nthey desired to bring about some purpose of cruelty, they exalted\nthe power of Caesar. To accomplish the destruction of Christ, they\nwould profess loyalty to the foreign rule which they hated.\n\u201cWhosoever maketh himself a king,\u201d they continued, \u201cspeaketh\nagainst Caesar.\u201d This was touching Pilate in a weak point. He was\nunder suspicion by the Roman government, and he knew that such a\nreport would be ruin to him. He knew that if the Jews were thwarted,\ntheir rage would be turned against him. They would leave nothing\nundone to accomplish their revenge. He had before him an example\nof the persistence with which they sought the life of One whom they\nhated without reason.\nPilate then took his place on the judgment seat, and again pre-\nsented Jesus to the people, saying, \u201cBehold your King!\u201d Again the\nmad cry was heard, \u201cAway with Him, crucify Him.\u201d In a voice that\nwas heard far and near, Pilate asked, \u201cShall I crucify your King?\u201d\nBut from profane, blasphemous lips went forth the words, \u201cWe have\nno king but Caesar.\u201d\n646 The Desire of Ages\nThus by choosing a heathen ruler, the Jewish nation had with-\ndrawn from the theocracy. They had rejected God as their king.[738]\nHenceforth they had no deliverer. They had no king but Caesar. To\nthis the priests and teachers had led the people. For this, with the\nfearful results that followed, they were responsible. A nation\u2019s sin\nand a nation\u2019s ruin were due to the religious leaders.\n\u201cWhen Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a\ntumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the\nmultitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just Person:\nsee ye to it.\u201d In fear and self-condemnation Pilate looked upon the\nSaviour. In the vast sea of upturned faces, His alone was peaceful.\nAbout His head a soft light seemed to shine. Pilate said in his heart,\nHe is a God. Turning to the multitude he declared, I am clear of\nHis blood. Take ye Him, and crucify Him. But mark ye, priests and\nrulers, I pronounce Him a just man. May He whom He claims as\nHis Father judge you and not me for this day\u2019s work. Then to Jesus\nhe said, Forgive me for this act; I cannot save You. And when he\nhad again scourged Jesus, he delivered Him to be crucified.\nPilate longed to deliver Jesus. But he saw that he could not\ndo this, and yet retain his own position and honor. Rather than\nlose his worldly power, he chose to sacrifice an innocent life. How\nmany, to escape loss or suffering, in like manner sacrifice princi-\nple. Conscience and duty point one way, and self-interest points\nanother. The current sets strongly in the wrong direction, and he\nwho compromises with evil is swept away into the thick darkness of\nguilt.\nPilate yielded to the demands of the mob. Rather than risk losing\nhis position, he delivered Jesus up to be crucified. But in spite of\nhis precautions, the very thing he dreaded afterward came upon him.\nHis honors were stripped from him, he was cast down from his high\noffice, and, stung by remorse and wounded pride, not long after the\ncrucifixion he ended his own life. So all who compromise with sin\nwill gain only sorrow and ruin. \u201cThere is a way which seemeth right\nunto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.\u201d Proverbs\n14:12.\nWhen Pilate declared himself innocent of the blood of Christ, Ca-\niaphas answered defiantly, \u201cHis blood be on us, and on our children.\u201d\nThe awful words were taken up by the priests and rulers, and echoed\nIn Pilate\u2019s Judgment Hall 647\nby the crowd in an inhuman roar of voices. The whole multitude\nanswered and said, \u201cHis blood be on us, and on our children.\u201d\nThe people of Israel had made their choice. Pointing to Jesus\nthey had said, \u201cNot this man, but Barabbas.\u201d Barabbas, the robber [739]\nand murderer, was the representative of Satan. Christ was the rep-\nresentative of God. Christ had been rejected; Barabbas had been\nchosen. Barabbas they were to have. In making this choice they\naccepted him who from the beginning was a liar and a murderer.\nSatan was their leader. As a nation they would act out his dictation.\nHis works they would do. His rule they must endure. That people\nwho chose Barabbas in the place of Christ were to feel the cruelty\nof Barabbas as long as time should last.\nLooking upon the smitten Lamb of God, the Jews had cried,\n\u201cHis blood be on us, and on our children.\u201d That awful cry ascended\nto the throne of God. That sentence, pronounced upon themselves,\nwas written in heaven. That prayer was heard. The blood of the\nSon of God was upon their children and their children\u2019s children, a\nperpetual curse.\nTerribly was it realized in the destruction of Jerusalem. Ter-\nribly has it been manifested in the condition of the Jewish nation\nfor eighteen hundred years,\u2014a branch severed from the vine, a\ndead, fruitless branch, to be gathered up and burned. From land to\nland throughout the world, from century to century, dead, dead in\ntrespasses and sins!\nTerribly will that prayer be fulfilled in the great judgment day.\nWhen Christ shall come to the earth again, not as a prisoner sur-\nrounded by a rabble will men see Him. They will see Him then as\nheaven\u2019s King. Christ will come in His own glory, in the glory of\nHis Father, and the glory of the holy angels. Ten thousand times ten\nthousand, and thousands of thousands of angels, the beautiful and\ntriumphant sons of God, possessing surpassing loveliness and glory,\nwill escort Him on His way. Then shall He sit upon the throne of\nHis glory, and before Him shall be gathered all nations. Then every\neye shall see Him, and they also that pierced Him. In the place of a\ncrown of thorns, He will wear a crown of glory,\u2014a crown within a\ncrown. In place of that old purple kingly robe, He will be clothed in\nraiment of whitest white, \u201cso as no fuller on earth can white them.\u201d\nMark 9:3. And on His vesture and on His thigh a name will be\n648 The Desire of Ages\nwritten, \u201cKing of kings, and Lord of lords.\u201d Revelation 19:16. Those\nwho mocked and smote Him will be there. The priests and rulers\nwill behold again the scene in the judgment hall. Every circumstance\nwill appear before them, as if written in letters of fire. Then those\nwho prayed, \u201cHis blood be on us, and on our children,\u201d will receive\nthe answer to their prayer. Then the whole world will know and[740]\nunderstand. They will realize who and what they, poor, feeble, finite\nbeings, have been warring against. In awful agony and horror they\nwill cry to the mountains and rocks, \u201cFall on us, and hide us from\nthe face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the\nLamb: for the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able\nto stand?\u201d Revelation 6:16, 17.\nChapter 78\u2014Calvary [741]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 27:31-53; Mark 14:20-38; Luke\n23:26-46; John 19:16-30.\n\u201cAnd when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,\nthere they crucified Him.\u201d\n\u201cThat He might sanctify the people with His own blood,\u201d Christ\n\u201csuffered without the gate.\u201d Hebrews 13:12. For transgression of the\nlaw of God, Adam and Eve were banished from Eden. Christ, our\nsubstitute, was to suffer without the boundaries of Jerusalem. He\ndied outside the gate, where felons and murderers were executed.\nFull of significance are the words, \u201cChrist hath redeemed us from\nthe curse of the law, being made a curse for us.\u201d Galatians 3:13.\nA vast multitude followed Jesus from the judgment hall to\nCalvary. The news of His condemnation had spread throughout\nJerusalem, and people of all classes and all ranks flocked toward\nthe place of crucifixion. The priests and rulers had been bound\nby a promise not to molest Christ\u2019s followers if He Himself were\ndelivered to them, and the disciples and believers from the city and\nthe surrounding region joined the throng that followed the Saviour.\nAs Jesus passed the gate of Pilate\u2019s court, the cross which had\nbeen prepared for Barabbas was laid upon His bruised and bleeding\nshoulders. Two companions of Barabbas were to suffer death at the\nsame time with Jesus, and upon them also crosses were placed. The\nSaviour\u2019s burden was too heavy for Him in His weak and suffering [742]\ncondition. Since the Passover supper with His disciples, He had\ntaken neither food nor drink. He had agonized in the garden of\nGethsemane in conflict with satanic agencies. He had endured the\nanguish of the betrayal, and had seen His disciples forsake Him and\nflee. He had been taken to Annas, then to Caiaphas, and then to\nPilate. From Pilate He had been sent to Herod, then sent again to\nPilate. From insult to renewed insult, from mockery to mockery,\ntwice tortured by the scourge,\u2014all that night there had been scene\n649\n650 The Desire of Ages\nafter scene of a character to try the soul of man to the uttermost.\nChrist had not failed. He had spoken no word but that tended to\nglorify God. All through the disgraceful farce of a trial He had\nborne Himself with firmness and dignity. But when after the second\nscourging the cross was laid upon Him, human nature could bear no\nmore. He fell fainting beneath the burden.\nThe crowd that followed the Saviour saw His weak and stagger-\ning steps, but they manifested no compassion. They taunted and\nreviled Him because He could not carry the heavy cross. Again the\nburden was laid upon Him, and again He fell fainting to the ground.\nHis persecutors saw that it was impossible for Him to carry His bur-\nden farther. They were puzzled to find anyone who would bear the\nhumiliating load. The Jews themselves could not do this, because\nthe defilement would prevent them from keeping the Passover. None\neven of the mob that followed Him would stoop to bear the cross.\nAt this time a stranger, Simon a Cyrenian, coming in from the\ncountry, meets the throng. He hears the taunts and ribaldry of the\ncrowd; he hears the words contemptuously repeated, Make way for\nthe King of the Jews! He stops in astonishment at the scene; and\nas he expresses his compassion, they seize him and place the cross\nupon his shoulders.\nSimon had heard of Jesus. His sons were believers in the Saviour,\nbut he himself was not a disciple. The bearing of the cross to Calvary\nwas a blessing to Simon, and he was ever after grateful for this\nprovidence. It led him to take upon himself the cross of Christ from\nchoice, and ever cheerfully stand beneath its burden.\nNot a few women are in the crowd that follow the Uncondemned\nto His cruel death. Their attention is fixed upon Jesus. Some of them\nhave seen Him before. Some have carried to Him their sick and\nsuffering ones. Some have themselves been healed. The story of the\nscenes that have taken place is related. They wonder at the hatred of\nthe crowd toward Him for whom their own hearts are melting and\nready to break. And notwithstanding the action of the maddened[743]\nthrong, and the angry words of the priests and rulers, these women\ngive expression to their sympathy. As Jesus falls fainting beneath\nthe cross, they break forth into mournful wailing.\nThis was the only thing that attracted Christ\u2019s attention. Although\nfull of suffering, while bearing the sins of the world, He was not\nCalvary 651\nindifferent to the expression of grief. He looked upon these women\nwith tender compassion. They were not believers in Him; He knew\nthat they were not lamenting Him as one sent from God, but were\nmoved by feelings of human pity. He did not despise their sympathy,\nbut it awakened in His heart a deeper sympathy for them. \u201cDaughters\nof Jerusalem,\u201d He said, \u201cweep not for Me, but weep for yourselves,\nand for your children.\u201d From the scene before Him, Christ looked\nforward to the time of Jerusalem\u2019s destruction. In that terrible scene,\nmany of those who were now weeping for Him were to perish with\ntheir children.\nFrom the fall of Jerusalem the thoughts of Jesus passed to a wider\njudgment. In the destruction of the impenitent city He saw a symbol\nof the final destruction to come upon the world. He said, \u201cThen\nshall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills,\nCover us. For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be\ndone in the dry?\u201d By the green tree, Jesus represented Himself, the\ninnocent Redeemer. God suffered His wrath against transgression\nto fall on His beloved Son. Jesus was to be crucified for the sins of\nmen. What suffering, then, would the sinner bear who continued in\nsin? All the impenitent and unbelieving would know a sorrow and\nmisery that language would fail to express.\nOf the multitude that followed the Saviour to Calvary, many had\nattended Him with joyful hosannas and the waving of palm branches\nas He rode triumphantly into Jerusalem. But not a few who had then\nshouted His praise, because it was popular to do so, now swelled the\ncry of \u201cCrucify Him, crucify Him.\u201d When Christ rode into Jerusalem,\nthe hopes of the disciples had been raised to the highest pitch. They\nhad pressed close about their Master, feeling that it was a high honor\nto be connected with Him. Now in His humiliation they followed\nHim at a distance. They were filled with grief, and bowed down\nwith disappointed hopes. How were the words of Jesus verified: \u201cAll\nye shall be offended because of Me this night: for it is written, I\nwill smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered\nabroad.\u201d Matthew 26:31.\nArriving at the place of execution, the prisoners were bound to [744]\nthe instruments of torture. The two thieves wrestled in the hands of\nthose who placed them on the cross; but Jesus made no resistance.\nThe mother of Jesus, supported by John the beloved disciple, had\n652 The Desire of Ages\nfollowed the steps of her Son to Calvary. She had seen Him fainting\nunder the burden of the cross, and had longed to place a supporting\nhand beneath His wounded head, and to bathe that brow which had\nonce been pillowed upon her bosom. But she was not permitted this\nmournful privilege. With the disciples she still cherished the hope\nthat Jesus would manifest His power, and deliver Himself from His\nenemies. Again her heart would sink as she recalled the words in\nwhich He had foretold the very scenes that were then taking place.\nAs the thieves were bound to the cross, she looked on with agonizing\nsuspense. Would He who had given life to the dead suffer Himself\nto be crucified? Would the Son of God suffer Himself to be thus\ncruelly slain? Must she give up her faith that Jesus was the Messiah?\nMust she witness His shame and sorrow, without even the privilege\nof ministering to Him in His distress? She saw His hands stretched\nupon the cross; the hammer and the nails were brought, and as\nthe spikes were driven through the tender flesh, the heart-stricken\ndisciples bore away from the cruel scene the fainting form of the\nmother of Jesus.\nThe Saviour made no murmur of complaint. His face remained\ncalm and serene, but great drops of sweat stood upon His brow.\nThere was no pitying hand to wipe the death dew from His face,\nnor words of sympathy and unchanging fidelity to stay His human\nheart. While the soldiers were doing their fearful work, Jesus prayed\nfor His enemies, \u201cFather, forgive them; for they know not what\nthey do.\u201d His mind passed from His own suffering to the sin of His\npersecutors, and the terrible retribution that would be theirs. No\ncurses were called down upon the soldiers who were handling Him\nso roughly. No vengeance was invoked upon the priests and rulers,\nwho were gloating over the accomplishment of their purpose. Christ\npitied them in their ignorance and guilt. He breathed only a plea for\ntheir forgiveness,\u2014\u201cfor they know not what they do.\u201d\nHad they known that they were putting to torture One who had\ncome to save the sinful race from eternal ruin, they would have been\nseized with remorse and horror. But their ignorance did not remove\ntheir guilt; for it was their privilege to know and accept Jesus as\ntheir Saviour. Some of them would yet see their sin, and repent,[745]\nand be converted. Some by their impenitence would make it an\nimpossibility for the prayer of Christ to be answered for them. Yet,\nCalvary 653\njust the same, God\u2019s purpose was reaching its fulfillment. Jesus\nwas earning the right to become the advocate of men in the Father\u2019s\npresence.\nThat prayer of Christ for His enemies embraced the world. It\ntook in every sinner that had lived or should live, from the beginning\nof the world to the end of time. Upon all rests the guilt of crucifying\nthe Son of God. To all, forgiveness is freely offered. \u201cWhosoever\nwill\u201d may have peace with God, and inherit eternal life.\nAs soon as Jesus was nailed to the cross, it was lifted by strong\nmen, and with great violence thrust into the place prepared for it.\nThis caused the most intense agony to the Son of God. Pilate then\nwrote an inscription in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, and placed it upon\nthe cross, above the head of Jesus. It read, \u201cJesus of Nazareth the\nKing of the Jews.\u201d This inscription irritated the Jews. In Pilate\u2019s\ncourt they had cried, \u201cCrucify Him.\u201d \u201cWe have no king but Caesar.\u201d\nJohn 19:15. They had declared that whoever should acknowledge\nany other king was a traitor. Pilate wrote out the sentiment they had\nexpressed. No offense was mentioned, except that Jesus was the\nKing of the Jews. The inscription was a virtual acknowledgment\nof the allegiance of the Jews to the Roman power. It declared that\nwhoever might claim to be the King of Israel would be judged by\nthem worthy of death. The priests had overreached themselves.\nWhen they were plotting the death of Christ, Caiaphas had declared\nit expedient that one man should die to save the nation. Now their\nhypocrisy was revealed. In order to destroy Christ, they had been\nready to sacrifice even their national existence.\nThe priests saw what they had done, and asked Pilate to change\nthe inscription. They said, \u201cWrite not, The King of the Jews; but that\nHe said, I am King of the Jews.\u201d But Pilate was angry with himself\nbecause of his former weakness, and he thoroughly despised the\njealous and artful priests and rulers. He replied coldly, \u201cWhat I have\nwritten I have written.\u201d\nA higher power than Pilate or the Jews had directed the placing\nof that inscription above the head of Jesus. In the providence of God\nit was to awaken thought, and investigation of the Scriptures. The\nplace where Christ was crucified was near to the city. Thousands\nof people from all lands were then at Jerusalem, and the inscription\ndeclaring Jesus of Nazareth the Messiah would come to their notice. [746]\n654 The Desire of Ages\nIt was a living truth, transcribed by a hand that God had guided.\nIn the sufferings of Christ upon the cross prophecy was fulfilled.\nCenturies before the crucifixion, the Saviour had foretold the treat-\nment He was to receive. He said, \u201cDogs have compassed Me: the\nassembly of the wicked have enclosed Me: they pierced My hands\nand My feet. I may tell all My bones: they look and stare upon\nMe. They part My garments among them, and cast lots upon My\nvesture.\u201d Psalm 22:16-18. The prophecy concerning His garments\nwas carried out without counsel or interference from the friends or\nthe enemies of the Crucified One. To the soldiers who had placed\nHim upon the cross, His clothing was given. Christ heard the men\u2019s\ncontention as they parted the garments among them. His tunic was\nwoven throughout without seam, and they said, \u201cLet us not rend it,\nbut cast lots for it, whose it shall be.\u201d\nIn another prophecy the Saviour declared, \u201cReproach hath broken\nMy heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take\npity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none. They\ngave Me also gall for My meat; and in My thirst they gave Me\nvinegar to drink.\u201d Psalm 69:20, 21. To those who suffered death by\nthe cross, it was permitted to give a stupefying potion, to deaden the\nsense of pain. This was offered to Jesus; but when He had tasted\nit, He refused it. He would receive nothing that could becloud His\nmind. His faith must keep fast hold upon God. This was His only\nstrength. To becloud His senses would give Satan an advantage.\nThe enemies of Jesus vented their rage upon Him as He hung\nupon the cross. Priests, rulers, and scribes joined with the mob in\nmocking the dying Saviour. At the baptism and at the transfiguration\nthe voice of God had been heard proclaiming Christ as His Son.\nAgain, just before Christ\u2019s betrayal, the Father had spoken, witness-\ning to His divinity. But now the voice from heaven was silent. No\ntestimony in Christ\u2019s favor was heard. Alone He suffered abuse and\nmockery from wicked men.\n\u201cIf Thou be the Son of God,\u201d they said, \u201ccome down from the\ncross.\u201d \u201cLet Him save Himself, if He be Christ, the chosen of God.\u201d\nIn the wilderness of temptation Satan had declared, \u201cIf Thou be\nthe Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\u201d \u201cIf\nThou be the Son of God, cast Thyself down\u201d from the pinnacle of\nthe temple. Matthew 4:3, 6. And Satan with his angels, in human\nCalvary 655\nform, was present at the cross. The archfiend and his hosts were [747]\n[748]\n[749]\nco-operating with the priests and rulers. The teachers of the people\nhad stimulated the ignorant mob to pronounce judgment against One\nupon whom many of them had never looked, until urged to bear\ntestimony against Him. Priests, rulers, Pharisees, and the hardened\nrabble were confederated together in a satanic frenzy. Religious\nrulers united with Satan and his angels. They were doing his bidding.\nJesus, suffering and dying, heard every word as the priests de-\nclared, \u201cHe saved others; Himself He cannot save. Let Christ the\nKing of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and\nbelieve.\u201d Christ could have come down from the cross. But it is be-\ncause He would not save Himself that the sinner has hope of pardon\nand favor with God.\nIn their mockery of the Saviour, the men who professed to be\nthe expounders of prophecy were repeating the very words which\nInspiration had foretold they would utter upon this occasion. Yet in\ntheir blindness they did not see that they were fulfilling the prophecy.\nThose who in derision uttered the words, \u201cHe trusted in God; let\nHim deliver Him now, if He will have Him: for He said, I am the\nSon of God,\u201d little thought that their testimony would sound down\nthe ages. But although spoken in mockery, these words led men\nto search the Scriptures as they had never done before. Wise men\nheard, searched, pondered, and prayed. There were those who never\nrested until, by comparing scripture with scripture, they saw the\nmeaning of Christ\u2019s mission. Never before was there such a general\nknowledge of Jesus as when He hung upon the cross. Into the hearts\nof many who beheld the crucifixion scene, and who heard Christ\u2019s\nwords, the light of truth was shining.\nTo Jesus in His agony on the cross there came one gleam of\ncomfort. It was the prayer of the penitent thief. Both the men who\nwere crucified with Jesus had at first railed upon Him; and one under\nhis suffering only became more desperate and defiant. But not so\nwith his companion. This man was not a hardened criminal; he\nhad been led astray by evil associations, but he was less guilty than\nmany of those who stood beside the cross reviling the Saviour. He\nhad seen and heard Jesus, and had been convicted by His teaching,\nbut he had been turned away from Him by the priests and rulers.\nSeeking to stifle conviction, he had plunged deeper and deeper into\n656 The Desire of Ages\nsin, until he was arrested, tried as a criminal, and condemned to die\non the cross. In the judgment hall and on the way to Calvary he had\nbeen in company with Jesus. He had heard Pilate declare, \u201cI find\nno fault in Him.\u201d John 19:4. He had marked His godlike bearing,[750]\nand His pitying forgiveness of His tormentors. On the cross he sees\nthe many great religionists shoot out the tongue with scorn, and\nridicule the Lord Jesus. He sees the wagging heads. He hears the\nupbraiding speeches taken up by his companion in guilt: \u201cIf Thou be\nChrist, save Thyself and us.\u201d Among the passers-by he hears many\ndefending Jesus. He hears them repeat His words, and tell of His\nworks. The conviction comes back to him that this is the Christ.\nTurning to his fellow criminal he says, \u201cDost not thou fear God,\nseeing thou art in the same condemnation?\u201d The dying thieves have\nno longer anything to fear from man. But upon one of them presses\nthe conviction that there is a God to fear, a future to cause him to\ntremble. And now, all sin-polluted as it is, his life history is about\nto close. \u201cAnd we indeed justly,\u201d he moans; \u201cfor we receive the due\nreward of our deeds: but this Man hath done nothing amiss.\u201d\nThere is no question now. There are no doubts, no reproaches.\nWhen condemned for his crime, the thief had become hopeless and\ndespairing; but strange, tender thoughts now spring up. He calls\nto mind all he has heard of Jesus, how He has healed the sick and\npardoned sin. He has heard the words of those who believed in Jesus\nand followed Him weeping. He has seen and read the title above the\nSaviour\u2019s head. He has heard the passers-by repeat it, some with\ngrieved, quivering lips, others with jesting and mockery. The Holy\nSpirit illuminates his mind, and little by little the chain of evidence\nis joined together. In Jesus, bruised, mocked, and hanging upon\nthe cross, he sees the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the\nworld. Hope is mingled with anguish in his voice as the helpless,\ndying soul casts himself upon a dying Saviour. \u201cLord, remember\nme,\u201d he cries, \u201cwhen Thou comest into Thy kingdom.\u201d\nQuickly the answer came. Soft and melodious the tone, full of\nlove, compassion, and power the words: Verily I say unto thee today,\nThou shalt be with Me in paradise.\nFor long hours of agony, reviling and mockery have fallen upon\nthe ears of Jesus. As He hangs upon the cross, there floats up to Him\nstill the sound of jeers and curses. With longing heart He has listened\nCalvary 657\nfor some expression of faith from His disciples. He has heard only\nthe mournful words, \u201cWe trusted that it had been He which should\nhave redeemed Israel.\u201d How grateful then to the Saviour was the\nutterance of faith and love from the dying thief! While the leading\nJews deny Him, and even the disciples doubt His divinity, the poor\nthief, upon the brink of eternity, calls Jesus Lord. Many were ready [751]\nto call Him Lord when He wrought miracles, and after He had risen\nfrom the grave; but none acknowledged Him as He hung dying upon\nthe cross save the penitent thief who was saved at the eleventh hour.\nThe bystanders caught the words as the thief called Jesus Lord.\nThe tone of the repentant man arrested their attention. Those who at\nthe foot of the cross had been quarreling over Christ\u2019s garments, and\ncasting lots upon His vesture, stopped to listen. Their angry tones\nwere hushed. With bated breath they looked upon Christ, and waited\nfor the response from those dying lips.\nAs He spoke the words of promise, the dark cloud that seemed\nto enshroud the cross was pierced by a bright and living light. To\nthe penitent thief came the perfect peace of acceptance with God.\nChrist in His humiliation was glorified. He who in all other eyes\nappeared to be conquered was a Conqueror. He was acknowledged\nas the Sin Bearer. Men may exercise power over His human body.\nThey may pierce the holy temples with the crown of thorns. They\nmay strip from Him His raiment, and quarrel over its division. But\nthey cannot rob Him of His power to forgive sins. In dying He bears\ntestimony to His own divinity and to the glory of the Father. His\near is not heavy that it cannot hear, neither His arm shortened that it\ncannot save. It is His royal right to save unto the uttermost all who\ncome unto God by Him.\nI say unto thee today, Thou shalt be with Me in Paradise. Christ\ndid not promise that the thief should be with Him in Paradise that\nday. He Himself did not go that day to Paradise. He slept in the\ntomb, and on the morning of the resurrection He said, \u201cI am not\nyet ascended to My Father.\u201d John 20:17. But on the day of the\ncrucifixion, the day of apparent defeat and darkness, the promise\nwas given. \u201cToday\u201d while dying upon the cross as a malefactor,\nChrist assures the poor sinner, Thou shalt be with Me in Paradise.\nThe thieves crucified with Jesus were placed \u201con either side one,\nand Jesus in the midst.\u201d This was done by the direction of the priests\n658 The Desire of Ages\nand rulers. Christ\u2019s position between the thieves was to indicate that\nHe was the greatest criminal of the three. Thus was fulfilled the\nscripture, \u201cHe was numbered with the transgressors.\u201d Isaiah 53:12.\nBut the full meaning of their act the priests did not see. As Jesus,\ncrucified with the thieves, was placed \u201cin the midst,\u201d so His cross\nwas placed in the midst of a world lying in sin. And the words of\npardon spoken to the penitent thief kindled a light that will shine to\nthe earth\u2019s remotest bounds.\nWith amazement the angels beheld the infinite love of Jesus,[752]\nwho, suffering the most intense agony of mind and body, thought\nonly of others, and encouraged the penitent soul to believe. In\nHis humiliation He as a prophet had addressed the daughters of\nJerusalem; as priest and advocate He had pleaded with the Father to\nforgive His murderers; as a loving Saviour He had forgiven the sins\nof the penitent thief.\nAs the eyes of Jesus wandered over the multitude about Him,\none figure arrested His attention. At the foot of the cross stood His\nmother, supported by the disciple John. She could not endure to\nremain away from her Son; and John, knowing that the end was\nnear, had brought her again to the cross. In His dying hour, Christ\nremembered His mother. Looking into her grief-stricken face and\nthen upon John, He said to her, \u201cWoman, behold thy son!\u201d then to\nJohn, \u201cBehold thy mother!\u201d John understood Christ\u2019s words, and\naccepted the trust. He at once took Mary to his home, and from\nthat hour cared for her tenderly. O pitiful, loving Saviour; amid\nall His physical pain and mental anguish, He had a thoughtful care\nfor His mother! He had no money with which to provide for her\ncomfort; but He was enshrined in the heart of John, and He gave His\nmother to him as a precious legacy. Thus He provided for her that\nwhich she most needed,\u2014the tender sympathy of one who loved her\nbecause she loved Jesus. And in receiving her as a sacred trust, John\nwas receiving a great blessing. She was a constant reminder of his\nbeloved Master.\nThe perfect example of Christ\u2019s filial love shines forth with\nundimmed luster from the mist of ages. For nearly thirty years Jesus\nby His daily toil had helped bear the burdens of the home. And now,\neven in His last agony, He remembers to provide for His sorrowing,\nwidowed mother. The same spirit will be seen in every disciple of\nCalvary 659\nour Lord. Those who follow Christ will feel that it is a part of their\nreligion to respect and provide for their parents. From the heart\nwhere His love is cherished, father and mother will never fail of\nreceiving thoughtful care and tender sympathy.\nAnd now the Lord of glory was dying, a ransom for the race. In\nyielding up His precious life, Christ was not upheld by triumphant\njoy. All was oppressive gloom. It was not the dread of death that\nweighed upon Him. It was not the pain and ignominy of the cross\nthat caused His inexpressible agony. Christ was the prince of suf-\nferers; but His suffering was from a sense of the malignity of sin,\na knowledge that through familiarity with evil, man had become [753]\nblinded to its enormity. Christ saw how deep is the hold of sin upon\nthe human heart, how few would be willing to break from its power.\nHe knew that without help from God, humanity must perish, and He\nsaw multitudes perishing within reach of abundant help.\nUpon Christ as our substitute and surety was laid the iniquity of\nus all. He was counted a transgressor, that He might redeem us from\nthe condemnation of the law. The guilt of every descendant of Adam\nwas pressing upon His heart. The wrath of God against sin, the\nterrible manifestation of His displeasure because of iniquity, filled\nthe soul of His Son with consternation. All His life Christ had been\npublishing to a fallen world the good news of the Father\u2019s mercy and\npardoning love. Salvation for the chief of sinners was His theme.\nBut now with the terrible weight of guilt He bears, He cannot see the\nFather\u2019s reconciling face. The withdrawal of the divine countenance\nfrom the Saviour in this hour of supreme anguish pierced His heart\nwith a sorrow that can never be fully understood by man. So great\nwas this agony that His physical pain was hardly felt.\nSatan with his fierce temptations wrung the heart of Jesus. The\nSaviour could not see through the portals of the tomb. Hope did\nnot present to Him His coming forth from the grave a conqueror, or\ntell Him of the Father\u2019s acceptance of the sacrifice. He feared that\nsin was so offensive to God that Their separation was to be eternal.\nChrist felt the anguish which the sinner will feel when mercy shall\nno longer plead for the guilty race. It was the sense of sin, bringing\nthe Father\u2019s wrath upon Him as man\u2019s substitute, that made the cup\nHe drank so bitter, and broke the heart of the Son of God.\n660 The Desire of Ages\nWith amazement angels witnessed the Saviour\u2019s despairing\nagony. The hosts of heaven veiled their faces from the fearful sight.\nInanimate nature expressed sympathy with its insulted and dying\nAuthor. The sun refused to look upon the awful scene. Its full, bright\nrays were illuminating the earth at midday, when suddenly it seemed\nto be blotted out. Complete darkness, like a funeral pall, enveloped\nthe cross. \u201cThere was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.\u201d\nThere was no eclipse or other natural cause for this darkness, which\nwas as deep as midnight without moon or stars. It was a miraculous\ntestimony given by God that the faith of after generations might be\nconfirmed.\nIn that thick darkness God\u2019s presence was hidden. He makes\ndarkness His pavilion, and conceals His glory from human eyes.\nGod and His holy angels were beside the cross. The Father was[754]\nwith His Son. Yet His presence was not revealed. Had His glory\nflashed forth from the cloud, every human beholder would have been\ndestroyed. And in that dreadful hour Christ was not to be comforted\nwith the Father\u2019s presence. He trod the wine press alone, and of the\npeople there was none with Him.\nIn the thick darkness, God veiled the last human agony of His\nSon. All who had seen Christ in His suffering had been convicted\nof His divinity. That face, once beheld by humanity, was never\nforgotten. As the face of Cain expressed his guilt as a murderer, so\nthe face of Christ revealed innocence, serenity, benevolence,\u2014the\nimage of God. But His accusers would not give heed to the signet of\nheaven. Through long hours of agony Christ had been gazed upon\nby the jeering multitude. Now He was mercifully hidden by the\nmantle of God.\nThe silence of the grave seemed to have fallen upon Calvary. A\nnameless terror held the throng that was gathered about the cross.\nThe cursing and reviling ceased in the midst of half-uttered sen-\ntences. Men, women, and children fell prostrate upon the earth.\nVivid lightnings occasionally flashed forth from the cloud, and re-\nvealed the cross and the crucified Redeemer. Priests, rulers, scribes,\nexecutioners, and the mob, all thought that their time of retribution\nhad come. After a while some whispered that Jesus would now come\ndown from the cross. Some attempted to grope their way back to the\ncity, beating their breasts and wailing in fear.\nCalvary 661\nAt the ninth hour the darkness lifted from the people, but still\nenveloped the Saviour. It was a symbol of the agony and horror\nthat weighed upon His heart. No eye could pierce the gloom that\nsurrounded the cross, and none could penetrate the deeper gloom\nthat enshrouded the suffering soul of Christ. The angry lightnings\nseemed to be hurled at Him as He hung upon the cross. Then \u201cJesus\ncried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\u201d \u201cMy\nGod, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\u201d As the outer gloom\nsettled about the Saviour, many voices exclaimed: The vengeance\nof heaven is upon Him. The bolts of God\u2019s wrath are hurled at Him,\nbecause He claimed to be the Son of God. Many who believed on\nHim heard His despairing cry. Hope left them. If God had forsaken\nJesus, in what could His followers trust?\nWhen the darkness lifted from the oppressed spirit of Christ,\nHe revived to a sense of physical suffering, and said, \u201cI thirst.\u201d\nOne of the Roman soldiers, touched with pity as he looked at the [755]\nparched lips, took a sponge on a stalk of hyssop, and dipping it in a\nvessel of vinegar, offered it to Jesus. But the priests mocked at His\nagony. When darkness covered the earth, they had been filled with\nfear; as their terror abated, the dread returned that Jesus would yet\nescape them. His words, \u201cEloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\u201d they had\nmisinterpreted. With bitter contempt and scorn they said, \u201cThis man\ncalleth for Elias.\u201d The last opportunity to relieve His sufferings they\nrefused. \u201cLet be,\u201d they said, \u201clet us see whether Elias will come to\nsave Him.\u201d\nThe spotless Son of God hung upon the cross, His flesh lacerated\nwith stripes; those hands so often reached out in blessing, nailed to\nthe wooden bars; those feet so tireless on ministries of love, spiked\nto the tree; that royal head pierced by the crown of thorns; those\nquivering lips shaped to the cry of woe. And all that He endured\u2014\nthe blood drops that flowed from His head, His hands, His feet, the\nagony that racked His frame, and the unutterable anguish that filled\nHis soul at the hiding of His Father\u2019s face\u2014speaks to each child of\nhumanity, declaring, It is for thee that the Son of God consents to\nbear this burden of guilt; for thee He spoils the domain of death,\nand opens the gates of Paradise. He who stilled the angry waves\nand walked the foam-capped billows, who made devils tremble and\ndisease flee, who opened blind eyes and called forth the dead to\n662 The Desire of Ages\nlife,\u2014offers Himself upon the cross as a sacrifice, and this from love\nto thee. He, the Sin Bearer, endures the wrath of divine justice, and[756]\nfor thy sake becomes sin itself.\nIn silence the beholders watched for the end of the fearful scene.\nThe sun shone forth; but the cross was still enveloped in darkness.\nPriests and rulers looked toward Jerusalem; and lo, the dense cloud\nhad settled over the city and the plains of Judea. The Sun of Righ-\nteousness, the Light of the world, was withdrawing His beams from\nthe once favored city of Jerusalem. The fierce lightnings of God\u2019s\nwrath were directed against the fated city.\nSuddenly the gloom lifted from the cross, and in clear, trumpet-\nlike tones, that seemed to resound throughout creation, Jesus cried,\n\u201cIt is finished.\u201d \u201cFather, into Thy hands I commend My spirit.\u201d A\nlight encircled the cross, and the face of the Saviour shone with a\nglory like the sun. He then bowed His head upon His breast, and\ndied.\nAmid the awful darkness, apparently forsaken of God, Christ\nhad drained the last dregs in the cup of human woe. In those dreadful\nhours He had relied upon the evidence of His Father\u2019s acceptance\nheretofore given Him. He was acquainted with the character of His\nFather; He understood His justice, His mercy, and His great love.\nBy faith He rested in Him whom it had ever been His joy to obey.\nAnd as in submission He committed Himself to God, the sense of\nthe loss of His Father\u2019s favor was withdrawn. By faith, Christ was\nvictor.\nNever before had the earth witnessed such a scene. The multi-\ntude stood paralyzed, and with bated breath gazed upon the Saviour.\nAgain darkness settled upon the earth, and a hoarse rumbling, like\nheavy thunder, was heard. There was a violent earthquake. The\npeople were shaken together in heaps. The wildest confusion and\nconsternation ensued. In the surrounding mountains, rocks were\nrent asunder, and went crashing down into the plains. Sepulchers\nwere broken open, and the dead were cast out of their tombs. Cre-\nation seemed to be shivering to atoms. Priests, rulers, soldiers,\nexecutioners, and people, mute with terror, lay prostrate upon the\nground.\nWhen the loud cry, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d came from the lips of Christ,\nthe priests were officiating in the temple. It was the hour of the\nCalvary 663\nevening sacrifice. The lamb representing Christ had been brought\nto be slain. Clothed in his significant and beautiful dress, the priest\nstood with lifted knife, as did Abraham when he was about to slay\nhis son. With intense interest the people were looking on. But the\nearth trembles and quakes; for the Lord Himself draws near. With a [757]\nrending noise the inner veil of the temple is torn from top to bottom\nby an unseen hand, throwing open to the gaze of the multitude a\nplace once filled with the presence of God. In this place the Shekinah\nhad dwelt. Here God had manifested His glory above the mercy\nseat. No one but the high priest ever lifted the veil separating this\napartment from the rest of the temple. He entered in once a year to\nmake an atonement for the sins of the people. But lo, this veil is rent\nin twain. The most holy place of the earthly sanctuary is no longer\nsacred.\nAll is terror and confusion. The priest is about to slay the victim;\nbut the knife drops from his nerveless hand, and the lamb escapes.\nType has met antitype in the death of God\u2019s Son. The great sacrifice\nhas been made. The way into the holiest is laid open. A new\nand living way is prepared for all. No longer need sinful, sorrowing\nhumanity await the coming of the high priest. Henceforth the Saviour\nwas to officiate as priest and advocate in the heaven of heavens. It\nwas as if a living voice had spoken to the worshipers: There is now\nan end to all sacrifices and offerings for sin. The Son of God is come\naccording to His word, \u201cLo, I come (in the volume of the Book\nit is written of Me,) to do Thy will, O God.\u201d \u201cBy His own blood\u201d\nHe entereth \u201cin once into the holy place, having obtained eternal\nredemption for us.\u201d Hebrews 10:7; 9:12.\nChapter 79\u2014\u201cIt is Finished\u201d[758]\nChrist did not yield up His life till He had accomplished the work\nwhich He came to do, and with His parting breath He exclaimed, \u201cIt\nis finished.\u201d John 19:30. The battle had been won. His right hand\nand His holy arm had gotten Him the victory. As a Conqueror He\nplanted His banner on the eternal heights. Was there not joy among\nthe angels? All heaven triumphed in the Saviour\u2019s victory. Satan\nwas defeated, and knew that his kingdom was lost.\nTo the angels and the unfallen worlds the cry, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d had\na deep significance. It was for them as well as for us that the great\nwork of redemption had been accomplished. They with us share the\nfruits of Christ\u2019s victory.\nNot until the death of Christ was the character of Satan clearly\nrevealed to the angels or to the unfallen worlds. The archapostate\nhad so clothed himself with deception that even holy beings had not\nunderstood his principles. They had not clearly seen the nature of\nhis rebellion.\nIt was a being of wonderful power and glory that had set himself\nagainst God. Of Lucifer the Lord says, \u201cThou sealest up the sum, full\nof wisdom, and perfect in beauty.\u201d Ezekiel 28:12. Lucifer had been\nthe covering cherub. He had stood in the light of God\u2019s presence. He\nhad been the highest of all created beings, and had been foremost in\nrevealing God\u2019s purposes to the universe. After he had sinned, his\npower to deceive was the more deceptive, and the unveiling of his[759]\ncharacter was the more difficult, because of the exalted position he\nhad held with the Father.\nGod could have destroyed Satan and his sympathizers as easily as\none can cast a pebble to the earth; but He did not do this. Rebellion\nwas not to be overcome by force. Compelling power is found only\nunder Satan\u2019s government. The Lord\u2019s principles are not of this\norder. His authority rests upon goodness, mercy, and love; and\nthe presentation of these principles is the means to be used. God\u2019s\n664\n\u201cIt is Finished\u201d 665\ngovernment is moral, and truth and love are to be the prevailing\npower.\nIt was God\u2019s purpose to place things on an eternal basis of\nsecurity, and in the councils of heaven it was decided that time\nmust be given for Satan to develop the principles which were the\nfoundation of his system of government. He had claimed that these\nwere superior to God\u2019s principles. Time was given for the working of\nSatan\u2019s principles, that they might be seen by the heavenly universe.\nSatan led men into sin, and the plan of redemption was put in\noperation. For four thousand years, Christ was working for man\u2019s\nuplifting, and Satan for his ruin and degradation. And the heavenly\nuniverse beheld it all.\nWhen Jesus came into the world, Satan\u2019s power was turned\nagainst Him. From the time when He appeared as a babe in Beth-\nlehem, the usurper worked to bring about His destruction. In every\npossible way he sought to prevent Jesus from developing a perfect\nchildhood, a faultless manhood, a holy ministry, and an unblemished\nsacrifice. But he was defeated. He could not lead Jesus into sin. He\ncould not discourage Him, or drive Him from a work He had come\non earth to do. From the desert to Calvary, the storm of Satan\u2019s wrath\nbeat upon Him, but the more mercilessly it fell, the more firmly did\nthe Son of God cling to the hand of His Father, and press on in the\nbloodstained path. All the efforts of Satan to oppress and overcome\nHim only brought out in a purer light His spotless character.\nAll heaven and the unfallen worlds had been witnesses to the\ncontroversy. With what intense interest did they follow the closing\nscenes of the conflict. They beheld the Saviour enter the garden\nof Gethsemane, His soul bowed down with the horror of a great\ndarkness. They heard His bitter cry, \u201cFather, if it be possible, let\nthis cup pass from Me.\u201d Matthew 26:39. As the Father\u2019s presence\nwas withdrawn, they saw Him sorrowful with a bitterness of sorrow\nexceeding that of the last great struggle with death. The bloody\nsweat was forced from His pores, and fell in drops upon the ground. [760]\nThrice the prayer for deliverance was wrung from His lips. Heaven\ncould no longer endure the sight, and a messenger of comfort was\nsent to the Son of God.\nHeaven beheld the Victim betrayed into the hands of the murder-\nous mob, and with mockery and violence hurried from one tribunal\n666 The Desire of Ages\nto another. It heard the sneers of His persecutors because of His\nlowly birth. It heard the denial with cursing and swearing by one\nof His best-loved disciples. It saw the frenzied work of Satan, and\nhis power over the hearts of men. Oh, fearful scene! the Saviour\nseized at midnight in Gethsemane, dragged to and fro from palace\nto judgment hall, arraigned twice before the priests, twice before\nthe Sanhedrin, twice before Pilate, and once before Herod, mocked,\nscourged, condemned, and led out to be crucified, bearing the heavy\nburden of the cross, amid the wailing of the daughters of Jerusalem\nand the jeering of the rabble.\nHeaven viewed with grief and amazement Christ hanging upon\nthe cross, blood flowing from His wounded temples, and sweat\ntinged with blood standing upon His brow. From His hands and feet\nthe blood fell, drop by drop, upon the rock drilled for the foot of\nthe cross. The wounds made by the nails gaped as the weight of\nHis body dragged upon His hands. His labored breath grew quick\nand deep, as His soul panted under the burden of the sins of the\nworld. All heaven was filled with wonder when the prayer of Christ\nwas offered in the midst of His terrible suffering,\u2014\u201cFather, forgive\nthem; for they know not what they do.\u201d Luke 23:34. Yet there stood\nmen, formed in the image of God, joining to crush out the life of His\nonly-begotten Son. What a sight for the heavenly universe!\nThe principalities and powers of darkness were assembled\naround the cross, casting the hellish shadow of unbelief into the\nhearts of men. When the Lord created these beings to stand before\nHis throne, they were beautiful and glorious. Their loveliness and\nholiness were in accordance with their exalted station. They were\nenriched with the wisdom of God, and girded with the panoply of\nheaven. They were Jehovah\u2019s ministers. But who could recognize in\nthe fallen angels the glorious seraphim that once ministered in the\nheavenly courts?\nSatanic agencies confederated with evil men in leading the peo-\nple to believe Christ the chief of sinners, and to make Him the object\nof detestation. Those who mocked Christ as He hung upon the cross\nwere imbued with the spirit of the first great rebel. He filled them\nwith vile and loathsome speeches. He inspired their taunts. But by[761]\nall this he gained nothing.\n\u201cIt is Finished\u201d 667\nCould one sin have been found in Christ, had He in one particular\nyielded to Satan to escape the terrible torture, the enemy of God and\nman would have triumphed. Christ bowed His head and died, but\nHe held fast His faith and His submission to God. \u201cAnd I heard a\nloud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength,\nand the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ: for the\naccuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our\nGod day and night.\u201d Revelation 12:10.\nSatan saw that his disguise was torn away. His administration\nwas laid open before the unfallen angels and before the heavenly uni-\nverse. He had revealed himself as a murderer. By shedding the blood\nof the Son of God, he had uprooted himself from the sympathies of\nthe heavenly beings. Henceforth his work was restricted. Whatever\nattitude he might assume, he could no longer await the angels as\nthey came from the heavenly courts, and before them accuse Christ\u2019s\nbrethren of being clothed with the garments of blackness and the\ndefilement of sin. The last link of sympathy between Satan and the\nheavenly world was broken.\nYet Satan was not then destroyed. The angels did not even\nthen understand all that was involved in the great controversy. The\nprinciples at stake were to be more fully revealed. And for the sake\nof man, Satan\u2019s existence must be continued. Man as well as angels\nmust see the contrast between the Prince of light and the prince of\ndarkness. He must choose whom he will serve.\nIn the opening of the great controversy, Satan had declared that\nthe law of God could not be obeyed, that justice was inconsistent with\nmercy, and that, should the law be broken, it would be impossible for\nthe sinner to be pardoned. Every sin must meet its punishment, urged\nSatan; and if God should remit the punishment of sin, He would not\nbe a God of truth and justice. When men broke the law of God, and\ndefied His will, Satan exulted. It was proved, he declared, that the\nlaw could not be obeyed; man could not be forgiven. Because he,\nafter his rebellion, had been banished from heaven, Satan claimed\nthat the human race must be forever shut out from God\u2019s favor. God\ncould not be just, he urged, and yet show mercy to the sinner.\nBut even as a sinner, man was in a different position from that\nof Satan. Lucifer in heaven had sinned in the light of God\u2019s glory.\nTo him as to no other created being was given a revelation of God\u2019s\n668 The Desire of Ages\nlove. Understanding the character of God, knowing His goodness,[762]\nSatan chose to follow his own selfish, independent will. This choice\nwas final. There was no more that God could do to save him. But\nman was deceived; his mind was darkened by Satan\u2019s sophistry. The\nheight and depth of the love of God he did not know. For him there\nwas hope in a knowledge of God\u2019s love. By beholding His character\nhe might be drawn back to God.\nThrough Jesus, God\u2019s mercy was manifested to men; but mercy\ndoes not set aside justice. The law reveals the attributes of God\u2019s\ncharacter, and not a jot or tittle of it could be changed to meet man in\nhis fallen condition. God did not change His law, but He sacrificed\nHimself, in Christ, for man\u2019s redemption. \u201cGod was in Christ,\nreconciling the world unto Himself.\u201d 2 Corinthians 5:19.\nThe law requires righteousness,\u2014a righteous life, a perfect char-\nacter; and this man has not to give. He cannot meet the claims of\nGod\u2019s holy law. But Christ, coming to the earth as man, lived a holy\nlife, and developed a perfect character. These He offers as a free gift\nto all who will receive them. His life stands for the life of men. Thus\nthey have remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of\nGod. More than this, Christ imbues men with the attributes of God.\nHe builds up the human character after the similitude of the divine\ncharacter, a goodly fabric of spiritual strength and beauty. Thus the\nvery righteousness of the law is fulfilled in the believer in Christ.\nGod can \u201cbe just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.\u201d\nRomans 3:26.\nGod\u2019s love has been expressed in His justice no less than in His\nmercy. Justice is the foundation of His throne, and the fruit of His\nlove. It had been Satan\u2019s purpose to divorce mercy from truth and\njustice. He sought to prove that the righteousness of God\u2019s law is\nan enemy to peace. But Christ shows that in God\u2019s plan they are\nindissolubly joined together; the one cannot exist without the other.\n\u201cMercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have\nkissed each other.\u201d Psalm 85:10.\nBy His life and His death, Christ proved that God\u2019s justice did\nnot destroy His mercy, but that sin could be forgiven, and that the\nlaw is righteous, and can be perfectly obeyed. Satan\u2019s charges were\nrefuted. God had given man unmistakable evidence of His love.\n\u201cIt is Finished\u201d 669\nAnother deception was now to be brought forward. Satan de-\nclared that mercy destroyed justice, that the death of Christ abrogated\nthe Father\u2019s law. Had it been possible for the law to be changed or\nabrogated, then Christ need not have died. But to abrogate the law\nwould be to immortalize transgression, and place the world under [763]\nSatan\u2019s control. It was because the law was changeless, because\nman could be saved only through obedience to its precepts, that\nJesus was lifted up on the cross. Yet the very means by which Christ\nestablished the law Satan represented as destroying it. Here will\ncome the last conflict of the great controversy between Christ and\nSatan.\nThat the law which was spoken by God\u2019s own voice is faulty,\nthat some specification has been set aside, is the claim which Satan\nnow puts forward. It is the last great deception that he will bring\nupon the world. He needs not to assail the whole law; if he can lead\nmen to disregard one precept, his purpose is gained. For \u201cwhosoever\nshall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty\nof all.\u201d James 2:10. By consenting to break one precept, men are\nbrought under Satan\u2019s power. By substituting human law for God\u2019s\nlaw, Satan will seek to control the world. This work is foretold in\nprophecy. Of the great apostate power which is the representative of\nSatan, it is declared, \u201cHe shall speak great words against the Most\nHigh, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to\nchange times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand.\u201d Daniel\n7:25.\nMen will surely set up their laws to counterwork the laws of God.\nThey will seek to compel the consciences of others, and in their zeal\nto enforce these laws they will oppress their fellow men.\nThe warfare against God\u2019s law, which was begun in heaven,\nwill be continued until the end of time. Every man will be tested.\nObedience or disobedience is the question to be decided by the\nwhole world. All will be called to choose between the law of God\nand the laws of men. Here the dividing line will be drawn. There\nwill be but two classes. Every character will be fully developed; and\nall will show whether they have chosen the side of loyalty or that of\nrebellion.\nThen the end will come. God will vindicate His law and deliver\nHis people. Satan and all who have joined him in rebellion will\n670 The Desire of Ages\nbe cut off. Sin and sinners will perish, root and branch, (Malachi\n4:1),\u2014Satan the root, and his followers the branches. The word will\nbe fulfilled to the prince of evil, \u201cBecause thou hast set thine heart as\nthe heart of God; ... I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the\nmidst of the stones of fire.... Thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt\nthou be any more.\u201d Then \u201cthe wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt\ndiligently consider his place, and it shall not be;\u201d \u201cthey shall be as\nthough they had not been.\u201d Ezekiel 28:6-19; Psalm 37:10; Obadiah\n1:16.\nThis is not an act of arbitrary power on the part of God. The[764]\nrejecters of His mercy reap that which they have sown. God is the\nfountain of life; and when one chooses the service of sin, he separates\nfrom God, and thus cuts himself off from life. He is \u201calienated from\nthe life of God.\u201d Christ says, \u201cAll they that hate Me love death.\u201d\nEphesians 4:18; Proverbs 8:36. God gives them existence for a time\nthat they may develop their character and reveal their principles.\nThis accomplished, they receive the results of their own choice. By a\nlife of rebellion, Satan and all who unite with him place themselves\nso out of harmony with God that His very presence is to them a\nconsuming fire. The glory of Him who is love will destroy them.\nAt the beginning of the great controversy, the angels did not\nunderstand this. Had Satan and his host then been left to reap the\nfull result of their sin, they would have perished; but it would not\nhave been apparent to heavenly beings that this was the inevitable\nresult of sin. A doubt of God\u2019s goodness would have remained in\ntheir minds as evil seed, to produce its deadly fruit of sin and woe.\nBut not so when the great controversy shall be ended. Then, the\nplan of redemption having been completed, the character of God is\nrevealed to all created intelligences. The precepts of His law are seen\nto be perfect and immutable. Then sin has made manifest its nature,\nSatan his character. Then the extermination of sin will vindicate\nGod\u2019s love and establish His honor before a universe of beings who\ndelight to do His will, and in whose heart is His law.\nWell, then, might the angels rejoice as they looked upon the\nSaviour\u2019s cross; for though they did not then understand all, they\nknew that the destruction of sin and Satan was forever made cer-\ntain, that the redemption of man was assured, and that the universe\nwas made eternally secure. Christ Himself fully comprehended the\n\u201cIt is Finished\u201d 671\nresults of the sacrifice made upon Calvary. To all these He looked\nforward when upon the cross He cried out, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d\nChapter 80\u2014In Joseph\u2019s Tomb[765]\n[766]\n[767]\n[768]\n[769]\nAt last Jesus was at rest. The long day of shame and torture was\nended. As the last rays of the setting sun ushered in the Sabbath, the\nSon of God lay in quietude in Joseph\u2019s tomb. His work completed,\nHis hands folded in peace, He rested through the sacred hours of the\nSabbath day.\nIn the beginning the Father and the Son had rested upon the\nSabbath after Their work of creation. When \u201cthe heavens and the\nearth were finished, and all the host of them\u201d (Genesis 2:1), the\nCreator and all heavenly beings rejoiced in contemplation of the\nglorious scene. \u201cThe morning stars sang together, and all the sons\nof God shouted for joy.\u201d Job 38:7. Now Jesus rested from the work\nof redemption; and though there was grief among those who loved\nHim on earth, yet there was joy in heaven. Glorious to the eyes of\nheavenly beings was the promise of the future. A restored creation,\na redeemed race, that having conquered sin could never fall,\u2014this,\nthe result to flow from Christ\u2019s completed work, God and angels\nsaw. With this scene the day upon which Jesus rested is forever\nlinked. For \u201cHis work is perfect;\u201d and \u201cwhatsoever God doeth, it\nshall be forever.\u201d Deuteronomy 32:4; Ecclesiastes 3:14. When there\nshall be a \u201crestitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the\nmouth of all His holy prophets since the world began\u201d (Acts 3:21),\nthe creation Sabbath, the day on which Jesus lay at rest in Joseph\u2019s[770]\ntomb, will still be a day of rest and rejoicing. Heaven and earth\nwill unite in praise, as \u201cfrom one Sabbath to another\u201d (Isaiah 66:23)\nthe nations of the saved shall bow in joyful worship to God and the\nLamb.\nIn the closing events of the crucifixion day, fresh evidence was\ngiven of the fulfillment of prophecy, and new witness borne to\nChrist\u2019s divinity. When the darkness had lifted from the cross,\nand the Saviour\u2019s dying cry had been uttered, immediately another\nvoice was heard, saying, \u201cTruly this was the Son of God.\u201d Matthew\n27:54.\n672\nIn Joseph\u2019s Tomb 673\nThese words were said in no whispered tones. All eyes were\nturned to see whence they came. Who had spoken? It was the\ncenturion, the Roman soldier. The divine patience of the Saviour,\nand His sudden death, with the cry of victory upon His lips, had\nimpressed this heathen. In the bruised, broken body hanging upon\nthe cross, the centurion recognized the form of the Son of God. He\ncould not refrain from confessing his faith. Thus again evidence was\ngiven that our Redeemer was to see of the travail of His soul. Upon\nthe very day of His death, three men, differing widely from one\nanother, had declared their faith,\u2014he who commanded the Roman\nguard, he who bore the cross of the Saviour, and he who died upon\nthe cross at His side.\nAs evening drew on, an unearthly stillness hung over Cal-\nvary. The crowd dispersed, and many returned to Jerusalem greatly\nchanged in spirit from what they had been in the morning. Many\nhad flocked to the crucifixion from curiosity, and not from hatred\ntoward Christ. Still they believed the accusations of the priests, and\nlooked upon Christ as a malefactor. Under an unnatural excitement\nthey had united with the mob in railing against Him. But when the\nearth was wrapped in blackness, and they stood accused by their own\nconsciences, they felt guilty of a great wrong. No jest or mocking\nlaughter was heard in the midst of that fearful gloom; and when it\nwas lifted, they made their way to their homes in solemn silence.\nThey were convinced that the charges of the priests were false, that\nJesus was no pretender; and a few weeks later, when Peter preached\nupon the day of Pentecost, they were among the thousands who\nbecame converts to Christ.\nBut the Jewish leaders were unchanged by the events they had\nwitnessed. Their hatred of Jesus had not abated. The darkness that\nhad mantled the earth at the crucifixion was not more dense than\nthat which still enveloped the minds of the priests and rulers. At His\nbirth the star had known Christ, and had guided the wise men to the [771]\nmanger where He lay. The heavenly hosts had known Him, and had\nsung His praise over the plains of Bethlehem. The sea had known\nHis voice, and had obeyed His command. Disease and death had\nrecognized His authority, and had yielded to Him their prey. The sun\nhad known Him, and at the sight of His dying anguish, had hidden\nits face of light. The rocks had known Him, and had shivered into\n674 The Desire of Ages\nfragments at His cry. Inanimate nature had known Christ, and had\nborne witness to His divinity. But the priests and rulers of Israel\nknew not the Son of God.\nYet the priests and rulers were not at rest. They had carried\nout their purpose in putting Christ to death; but they did not feel\nthe sense of victory they had expected. Even in the hour of their\napparent triumph, they were harassed with doubts as to what would\nnext take place. They had heard the cry, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d \u201cFather, into\nThy hands I commend My spirit.\u201d John 19:30; Luke 23:46. They\nhad seen the rocks rent, and had felt the mighty earthquake, and they\nwere restless and uneasy.\nThey had been jealous of Christ\u2019s influence with the people when\nliving; they were jealous of Him even in death. They dreaded the\ndead Christ more, far more, than they had ever feared the living\nChrist. They dreaded to have the attention of the people directed\nany further to the events attending His crucifixion. They feared the\nresults of that day\u2019s work. Not on any account would they have had\nHis body remain on the cross during the Sabbath. The Sabbath was\nnow drawing on, and it would be a violation of its sanctity for the\nbodies to hang upon the cross. So, using this as a pretext, the leading\nJews requested Pilate that the death of the victims might be hastened,\nand their bodies be removed before the setting of the sun.\nPilate was as unwilling as they for the body of Jesus to remain\nupon the cross. His consent having been obtained, the legs of the\ntwo thieves were broken to hasten their death; but Jesus was found\nto be already dead. The rude soldiers had been softened by what\nthey had heard and seen of Christ, and they were restrained from\nbreaking His limbs. Thus in the offering of the Lamb of God was\nfulfilled the law of the Passover, \u201cThey shall leave none of it unto the\nmorning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances\nof the Passover they shall keep it.\u201d Numbers 9:12\nThe priests and rulers were amazed to find that Christ was dead.\nDeath by the cross was a lingering process; it was difficult to deter-\nmine when life had ceased. It was an unheard-of thing for one to[772]\ndie within six hours of crucifixion. The priests wished to make sure\nof the death of Jesus, and at their suggestion a soldier thrust a spear\ninto the Saviour\u2019s side. From the wound thus made, there flowed\ntwo copious and distinct streams, one of blood, the other of water.\nIn Joseph\u2019s Tomb 675\nThis was noted by all the beholders, and John states the occurrence\nvery definitely. He says, \u201cOne of the soldiers with a spear pierced\nHis side, and forthwith came there out blood and water. And he that\nsaw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he\nsaith true, that ye might believe. For these things were done, that\nthe scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of Him shall not be broken.\nAnd again another scripture saith, They shall look on Him whom\nthey pierced.\u201d John 19:34-37.\nAfter the resurrection the priests and rulers circulated the report\nthat Christ did not die upon the cross, that He merely fainted, and\nwas afterward revived. Another report affirmed that it was not a real\nbody of flesh and bone, but the likeness of a body, that was laid in the\ntomb. The action of the Roman soldiers disproves these falsehoods.\nThey broke not His legs, because He was already dead. To satisfy\nthe priests, they pierced His side. Had not life been already extinct,\nthis wound would have caused instant death.\nBut it was not the spear thrust, it was not the pain of the cross,\nthat caused the death of Jesus. That cry, uttered \u201cwith a loud voice\u201d\n(Matthew 27:50; Luke 23:46), at the moment of death, the stream\nof blood and water that flowed from His side, declared that He died\nof a broken heart. His heart was broken by mental anguish. He was\nslain by the sin of the world.\nWith the death of Christ the hopes of His disciples perished.\nThey looked upon His closed eyelids and drooping head, His hair\nmatted with blood, His pierced hands and feet, and their anguish was\nindescribable. Until the last they had not believed that He would die;\nthey could hardly believe that He was really dead. Overwhelmed\nwith sorrow, they did not recall His words foretelling this very scene.\nNothing that He had said now gave them comfort. They saw only the\ncross and its bleeding Victim. The future seemed dark with despair.\nTheir faith in Jesus had perished; but never had they loved their Lord\nas now. Never before had they so felt His worth, and their need of\nHis presence.\nEven in death, Christ\u2019s body was very precious to His disciples.\nThey longed to give Him an honored burial, but knew not how to\naccomplish this. Treason against the Roman government was the [773]\ncrime for which Jesus was condemned, and persons put to death for\nthis offense were consigned to a burial ground especially provided\n676 The Desire of Ages\nfor such criminals. The disciple John with the women from Galilee\nhad remained at the cross. They could not leave the body of their\nLord to be handled by the unfeeling soldiers, and buried in a dis-\nhonored grave. Yet they could not prevent it. They could obtain no\nfavors from the Jewish authorities, and they had no influence with\nPilate.\nIn this emergency, Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus came\nto the help of the disciples. Both these men were members of the\nSanhedrin, and were acquainted with Pilate. Both were men of\nwealth and influence. They were determined that the body of Jesus\nshould have an honorable burial.\nJoseph went boldly to Pilate, and begged from him the body\nof Jesus. For the first time, Pilate learned that Jesus was really\ndead. Conflicting reports had reached him in regard to the events\nattending the crucifixion, but the knowledge of Christ\u2019s death had\nbeen purposely kept from him. Pilate had been warned by the priests\nand rulers against deception by Christ\u2019s disciples in regard to His\nbody. Upon hearing Joseph\u2019s request, he therefore sent for the\ncenturion who had charge at the cross, and learned for a certainty of\nthe death of Jesus. He also drew from him an account of the scenes\nof Calvary, confirming the testimony of Joseph.\nThe request of Joseph was granted. While John was troubled\nabout the burial of his Master, Joseph returned with Pilate\u2019s order for\nthe body of Christ; and Nicodemus came bringing a costly mixture\nof myrrh and aloes, of about a hundred pounds\u2019 weight, for His\nembalming. The most honored in all Jerusalem could not have been\nshown more respect in death. The disciples were astonished to see\nthese wealthy rulers as much interested as they themselves in the\nburial of their Lord.\nNeither Joseph nor Nicodemus had openly accepted the Saviour\nwhile He was living. They knew that such a step would exclude them\nfrom the Sanhedrin, and they hoped to protect Him by their influence\nin its councils. For a time they had seemed to succeed; but the wily\npriests, seeing their favor to Christ, had thwarted their plans. In their\nabsence Jesus had been condemned and delivered to be crucified.\nNow that He was dead, they no longer concealed their attachment to\nHim. While the disciples feared to show themselves openly as His\nfollowers, Joseph and Nicodemus came boldly to their aid. The help[774]\nIn Joseph\u2019s Tomb 677\nof these rich and honored men was greatly needed at this time. They\ncould do for their dead Master what it was impossible for the poor\ndisciples to do; and their wealth and influence protected them, in a\ngreat measure, from the malice of the priests and rulers.\nGently and reverently they removed with their own hands the\nbody of Jesus from the cross. Their tears of sympathy fell fast as\nthey looked upon His bruised and lacerated form. Joseph owned\na new tomb, hewn in a rock. This he was reserving for himself;\nbut it was near Calvary, and he now prepared it for Jesus. The\nbody, together with the spices brought by Nicodemus, was carefully\nwrapped in a linen sheet, and the Redeemer was borne to the tomb.\nThere the three disciples straightened the mangled limbs, and folded\nthe bruised hands upon the pulseless breast. The Galilean women\ncame to see that all had been done that could be done for the lifeless\nform of their beloved Teacher. Then they saw the heavy stone rolled\nagainst the entrance of the tomb, and the Saviour was left at rest. The\nwomen were last at the cross, and last at the tomb of Christ. While\nthe evening shades were gathering, Mary Magdalene and the other\nMarys lingered about the resting place of their Lord, shedding tears\nof sorrow over the fate of Him whom they loved. \u201cAnd they returned,\n... and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment.\u201d Luke\n23:56.\nThat was a never-to-be-forgotten Sabbath to the sorrowing dis-\nciples, and also to the priests, rulers, scribes, and people. At the\nsetting of the sun on the evening of the preparation day the trumpets\nsounded, signifying that the Sabbath had begun. The Passover was\nobserved as it had been for centuries, while He to whom it pointed\nhad been slain by wicked hands, and lay in Joseph\u2019s tomb. On the\nSabbath the courts of the temple were filled with worshipers. The\nhigh priest from Golgotha was there, splendidly robed in his sacer-\ndotal garments. White-turbaned priests, full of activity, performed\ntheir duties. But some present were not at rest as the blood of bulls\nand goats was offered for sin. They were not conscious that type\nhad met antitype, that an infinite sacrifice had been made for the sins\nof the world. They knew not that there was no further value in the\nperformance of the ritual service. But never before had that service\nbeen witnessed with such conflicting feelings. The trumpets and\nmusical instruments and the voices of the singers were as loud and\n678 The Desire of Ages\nclear as usual. But a sense of strangeness pervaded everything. One[775]\nafter another inquired about a strange event that had taken place.\nHitherto the most holy place had been sacredly guarded from intru-\nsion. But now it was open to all eyes. The heavy veil of tapestry,\nmade of pure linen, and beautifully wrought with gold, scarlet, and\npurple, was rent from top to bottom. The place where Jehovah had\nmet with the high priest, to communicate His glory, the place that\nhad been God\u2019s sacred audience chamber, lay open to every eye,\u2014a\nplace no longer recognized by the Lord. With gloomy presentiments\nthe priests ministered before the altar. The uncovering of the sacred\nmystery of the most holy place filled them with dread of coming\ncalamity.\nMany minds were busy with thoughts started by the scenes of\nCalvary. From the crucifixion to the resurrection many sleepless\neyes were constantly searching the prophecies, some to learn the\nfull meaning of the feast they were then celebrating, some to find\nevidence that Jesus was not what He claimed to be; and others with\nsorrowful hearts were searching for proofs that He was the true\nMessiah. Though searching with different objects in view, all were\nconvicted of the same truth,\u2014that prophecy had been fulfilled in\nthe events of the past few days, and that the Crucified One was the\nworld\u2019s Redeemer. Many who at that time united in the service\nnever again took part in the paschal rites. Many even of the priests\nwere convicted of the true character of Jesus. Their searching of\nthe prophecies had not been in vain, and after His resurrection they\nacknowledged Him as the Son of God.\nNicodemus, when he saw Jesus lifted up on the cross, remem-\nbered His words spoken by night in the Mount of Olives: \u201cAs Moses\nlifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man\nbe lifted up: that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but\nhave eternal life.\u201d John 3:14, 15. On that Sabbath, when Christ lay in\nthe grave, Nicodemus had opportunity for reflection. A clearer light\nnow illuminated his mind, and the words which Jesus had spoken to\nhim were no longer mysterious. He felt that he had lost much by not\nconnecting himself with the Saviour during His life. Now he recalled\nthe events of Calvary. The prayer of Christ for His murderers and\nHis answer to the petition of the dying thief spoke to the heart of the\nlearned councilor. Again he looked upon the Saviour in His agony;\nIn Joseph\u2019s Tomb 679\nagain he heard that last cry, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d spoken like the words\nof a conqueror. Again he beheld the reeling earth, the darkened\nheavens, the rent veil, the shivered rocks, and his faith was forever\nestablished. The very event that destroyed the hopes of the disciples [776]\nconvinced Joseph and Nicodemus of the divinity of Jesus. Their\nfears were overcome by the courage of a firm and unwavering faith.\nNever had Christ attracted the attention of the multitude as now\nthat He was laid in the tomb. According to their practice, the people\nbrought their sick and suffering ones to the temple courts, inquiring,\nWho can tell us of Jesus of Nazareth? Many had come from far to\nfind Him who had healed the sick and raised the dead. On every side\nwas heard the cry, We want Christ the Healer! Upon this occasion\nthose who were thought to show indications of the leprosy were\nexamined by the priests. Many were forced to hear their husbands,\nwives, or children pronounced leprous, and doomed to go forth from\nthe shelter of their homes and the care of their friends, to warn off\nthe stranger with the mournful cry, \u201cUnclean, unclean!\u201d The friendly\nhands of Jesus of Nazareth, that never refused to touch with healing\nthe loathsome leper, were folded on His breast. The lips that had\nanswered his petition with the comforting words, \u201cI will; be thou\nclean\u201d (Matthew 8:3), were now silent. Many appealed to the chief\npriests and rulers for sympathy and relief, but in vain. Apparently\nthey were determined to have the living Christ among them again.\nWith persistent earnestness they asked for Him. They would not\nbe turned away. But they were driven from the temple courts, and\nsoldiers were stationed at the gates to keep back the multitude that\ncame with their sick and dying, demanding entrance.\nThe sufferers who had come to be healed by the Saviour sank\nunder their disappointment. The streets were filled with mourning.\nThe sick were dying for want of the healing touch of Jesus. Physi-\ncians were consulted in vain; there was no skill like that of Him who\nlay in Joseph\u2019s tomb.\nThe mourning cries of the suffering ones brought home to thou-\nsands of minds the conviction that a great light had gone out of the\nworld. Without Christ, the earth was blackness and darkness. Many\nwhose voices had swelled the cry of \u201cCrucify Him, crucify Him,\u201d\nnow realized the calamity that had fallen upon them, and would as\neagerly have cried, Give us Jesus! had He still been alive.\n680 The Desire of Ages\nWhen the people learned that Jesus had been put to death by the\npriests, inquiries were made regarding His death. The particulars\nof His trial were kept as private as possible; but during the time\nwhen He was in the grave, His name was on thousands of lips, and\nreports of His mock trial, and of the inhumanity of the priests and[777]\nrulers, were circulated everywhere. By men of intellect these priests\nand rulers were called upon to explain the prophecies of the Old\nTestament concerning the Messiah, and while trying to frame some\nfalsehood in reply, they became like men insane. The prophecies\nthat pointed to Christ\u2019s sufferings and death they could not explain,\nand many inquirers were convinced that the Scriptures had been\nfulfilled.\nThe revenge which the priests had thought would be so sweet\nwas already bitterness to them. They knew that they were meeting\nthe severe censure of the people; they knew that the very ones whom\nthey had influenced against Jesus were now horrified by their own\nshameful work. These priests had tried to believe Jesus a deceiver;\nbut it was in vain. Some of them had stood by the grave of Lazarus,\nand had seen the dead brought back to life. They trembled for fear\nthat Christ would Himself rise from the dead, and again appear\nbefore them. They had heard Him declare that He had power to\nlay down His life and to take it again. They remembered that He\nhad said, \u201cDestroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.\u201d\nJohn 2:19. Judas had told them the words spoken by Jesus to the\ndisciples while on the last journey to Jerusalem: \u201cBehold, we go up\nto Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief\npriests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death,\nand shall deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to\ncrucify Him: and the third day He shall rise again.\u201d Matthew 20:18,\n19. When they heard these words, they had mocked and ridiculed.\nBut now they remembered that Christ\u2019s predictions had so far been\nfulfilled. He had said that He would rise again the third day, and\nwho could say that this also would not come to pass? They longed\nto shut out these thoughts, but they could not. Like their father, the\ndevil, they believed and trembled.\nNow that the frenzy of excitement was past, the image of Christ\nwould intrude upon their minds. They beheld Him as He stood\nserene and uncomplaining before His enemies, suffering without\nIn Joseph\u2019s Tomb 681\na murmur their taunts and abuse. All the events of His trial and\ncrucifixion came back to them with an overpowering conviction that\nHe was the Son of God. They felt that He might at any time stand\nbefore them, the accused to become the accuser, the condemned to\ncondemn, the slain to demand justice in the death of His murderers.\nThey could rest little upon the Sabbath. Though they would\nnot step over a Gentile\u2019s threshold for fear of defilement, yet they [778]\nheld a council concerning the body of Christ. Death and the grave\nmust hold Him whom they had crucified. \u201cThe chief priests and\nPharisees came together unto Pilate, saying, Sir, we remember that\nthat deceiver said, while He was yet alive, After three days I will\nrise again. Command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure until\nthe third day, lest His disciples come by night, and steal Him away,\nand say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error\nshall be worse than the first. Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch:\ngo your way, make it as sure as ye can.\u201d Matthew 27:62-65.\nThe priests gave directions for securing the sepulcher. A great\nstone had been placed before the opening. Across this stone they\nplaced cords, securing the ends to the solid rock, and sealing them\nwith the Roman seal. The stone could not be moved without breaking\nthe seal. A guard of one hundred soldiers was then stationed around\nthe sepulcher to prevent it from being tampered with. The priests\ndid all they could to keep Christ\u2019s body where it had been laid. He\nwas sealed as securely in His tomb as if He were to remain there\nthrough all time.\nSo weak men counseled and planned. Little did these murderers\nrealize the uselessness of their efforts. But by their action God was\nglorified. The very efforts made to prevent Christ\u2019s resurrection\nare the most convincing arguments in its proof. The greater the\nnumber of soldiers placed around the tomb, the stronger would be\nthe testimony that He had risen. Hundreds of years before the death\nof Christ, the Holy Spirit had declared through the psalmist, \u201cWhy\ndo the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings\nof the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together,\nagainst the Lord, and against His anointed.... He that sitteth in the\nheavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.\u201d Psalm\n2:1-4. Roman guards and Roman arms were powerless to confine\nthe Lord of life within the tomb. The hour of His release was near.\nChapter 81\u2014\u201cThe Lord Is Risen\u201d[779]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 28:2-4, 11-15.\nThe night of the first day of the week had worn slowly away.\nThe darkest hour, just before daybreak, had come. Christ was still\na prisoner in His narrow tomb. The great stone was in its place;\nthe Roman seal was unbroken; the Roman guards were keeping\ntheir watch. And there were unseen watchers. Hosts of evil angels\nwere gathered about the place. Had it been possible, the prince of\ndarkness with his apostate army would have kept forever sealed the\ntomb that held the Son of God. But a heavenly host surrounded the\nsepulcher. Angels that excel in strength were guarding the tomb,\nand waiting to welcome the Prince of life.\n\u201cAnd, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the\nLord descended from heaven.\u201d Clothed with the panoply of God,\nthis angel left the heavenly courts. The bright beams of God\u2019s glory\nwent before him, and illuminated his pathway. \u201cHis countenance\nwas like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: and for fear of\nhim the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.\u201d\nNow, priests and rulers, where is the power of your guard? Brave\nsoldiers that have never been afraid of human power are now as\ncaptives taken without sword or spear. The face they look upon is\nnot the face of mortal warrior; it is the face of the mightiest of the[780]\nLord\u2019s host. This messenger is he who fills the position from which\nSatan fell. It is he who on the hills of Bethlehem proclaimed Christ\u2019s\nbirth. The earth trembles at his approach, the hosts of darkness flee,\nand as he rolls away the stone, heaven seems to come down to the\nearth. The soldiers see him removing the stone as he would a pebble,\nand hear him cry, Son of God, come forth; Thy Father calls Thee.\nThey see Jesus come forth from the grave, and hear Him proclaim\nover the rent sepulcher, \u201cI am the resurrection, and the life.\u201d As\nHe comes forth in majesty and glory, the angel host bow low in\n682\n\u201cThe Lord Is Risen\u201d 683\nadoration before the Redeemer, and welcome Him with songs of\npraise.\nAn earthquake marked the hour when Christ laid down His life,\nand another earthquake witnessed the moment when He took it up\nin triumph. He who had vanquished death and the grave came forth\nfrom the tomb with the tread of a conqueror, amid the reeling of the\nearth, the flashing of lightning, and the roaring of thunder. When\nHe shall come to the earth again, He will shake \u201cnot the earth only,\nbut also heaven.\u201d \u201cThe earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard,\nand shall be removed like a cottage.\u201d \u201cThe heavens shall be rolled\ntogether as a scroll;\u201d \u201cthe elements shall melt with fervent heat, the\nearth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.\u201d But\n\u201cthe Lord will be the hope of His people, and the strength of the\nchildren of Israel.\u201d Hebrews 12:26; Isaiah 24:20; 34:4; 2 Peter 3:10;\nJoel 3:16.\nAt the death of Jesus the soldiers had beheld the earth wrapped in\ndarkness at midday; but at the resurrection they saw the brightness of\nthe angels illuminate the night, and heard the inhabitants of heaven\nsinging with great joy and triumph: Thou hast vanquished Satan and\nthe powers of darkness; Thou hast swallowed up death in victory!\nChrist came forth from the tomb glorified, and the Roman guard\nbeheld Him. Their eyes were riveted upon the face of Him whom\nthey had so recently mocked and derided. In this glorified Being\nthey beheld the prisoner whom they had seen in the judgment hall,\nthe one for whom they had plaited a crown of thorns. This was the\nOne who had stood unresisting before Pilate and Herod, His form\nlacerated by the cruel scourge. This was He who had been nailed to\nthe cross, at whom the priests and rulers, full of self-satisfaction, had\nwagged their heads, saying, \u201cHe saved others; Himself He cannot\nsave.\u201d Matthew 27:42. This was He who had been laid in Joseph\u2019s\nnew tomb. The decree of heaven had loosed the captive. Mountains [781]\npiled upon mountains over His sepulcher could not have prevented\nHim from coming forth.\nAt sight of the angels and the glorified Saviour the Roman guard\nhad fainted and become as dead men. When the heavenly train was\nhidden from their view, they arose to their feet, and as quickly as\ntheir trembling limbs could carry them, made their way to the gate\nof the garden. Staggering like drunken men, they hurried on to the\n684 The Desire of Ages\ncity, telling those whom they met the wonderful news. They were\nmaking their way to Pilate, but their report had been carried to the\nJewish authorities, and the chief priests and rulers sent for them\nto be brought first into their presence. A strange appearance those\nsoldiers presented. Trembling with fear, their faces colorless, they\nbore testimony to the resurrection of Christ. The soldiers told all,\njust as they had seen it; they had not had time to think or speak\nanything but the truth. With painful utterance they said, It was the\nSon of God who was crucified; we have heard an angel proclaiming\nHim as the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory.\nThe faces of the priests were as those of the dead. Caiaphas tried\nto speak. His lips moved, but they uttered no sound. The soldiers\nwere about to leave the council room, when a voice stayed them.\nCaiaphas had at last found speech. Wait, wait, he said. Tell no one\nthe things you have seen.\nA lying report was then given to the soldiers. \u201cSay ye,\u201d said\nthe priests, \u201cHis disciples came by night, and stole Him away while\nwe slept.\u201d Here the priests overreached themselves. How could the[782]\nsoldiers say that the disciples had stolen the body while they slept?\nIf they were asleep, how could they know? And if the disciples had\nbeen proved guilty of stealing Christ\u2019s body, would not the priests\nhave been first to condemn them? Or if the sentinels had slept at the\ntomb, would not the priests have been foremost in accusing them to\nPilate?\nThe soldiers were horrified at the thought of bringing upon them-\nselves the charge of sleeping at their post. This was an offense\npunishable with death. Should they bear false witness, deceiving\nthe people, and placing their own lives in peril? Had they not kept\ntheir weary watch with sleepless vigilance? How could they stand\nthe trial, even for the sake of money, if they perjured themselves?\nIn order to silence the testimony they feared, the priests promised\nto secure the safety of the guard, saying that Pilate would not desire\nto have such a report circulated any more than they did. The Roman\nsoldiers sold their integrity to the Jews for money. They came in\nbefore the priests burdened with a most startling message of truth;\nthey went out with a burden of money, and on their tongues a lying\nreport which had been framed for them by the priests.\n\u201cThe Lord Is Risen\u201d 685\nMeanwhile the report of Christ\u2019s resurrection had been carried\nto Pilate. Though Pilate was responsible for having given Christ\nup to die, he had been comparatively unconcerned. While he had\ncondemned the Saviour unwillingly, and with a feeling of pity, he\nhad felt no real compunction until now. In terror he now shut himself\nwithin his house, determined to see no one. But the priests made\ntheir way into his presence, told the story which they had invented,\nand urged him to overlook the sentinels\u2019 neglect of duty. Before\nconsenting to this, he himself privately questioned the guard. They,\nfearing for their own safety, dared not conceal anything, and Pilate\ndrew from them an account of all that had taken place. He did not\nprosecute the matter further, but from that time there was no peace\nfor him.\nWhen Jesus was laid in the grave, Satan triumphed. He dared to\nhope that the Saviour would not take up His life again. He claimed\nthe Lord\u2019s body, and set his guard about the tomb, seeking to hold\nChrist a prisoner. He was bitterly angry when his angels fled at the\napproach of the heavenly messenger. When he saw Christ come\nforth in triumph, he knew that his kingdom would have an end, and\nthat he must finally die.\nThe priests, in putting Christ to death, had made themselves [783]\n[784]\n[785]\nthe tools of Satan. Now they were entirely in his power. They\nwere entangled in a snare from which they saw no escape but in\ncontinuing their warfare against Christ. When they heard the report\nof His resurrection, they feared the wrath of the people. They felt\nthat their own lives were in danger. The only hope for them was to\nprove Christ an impostor by denying that He had risen. They bribed\nthe soldiers, and secured Pilate\u2019s silence. They spread their lying\nreports far and near. But there were witnesses whom they could\nnot silence. Many had heard of the soldiers\u2019 testimony to Christ\u2019s\nresurrection. And certain of the dead who came forth with Christ\nappeared to many, and declared that He had risen. Reports were\nbrought to the priests of persons who had seen these risen ones,\nand heard their testimony. The priests and rulers were in continual\ndread, lest in walking the streets, or within the privacy of their own\nhomes, they should come face to face with Christ. They felt that\nthere was no safety for them. Bolts and bars were but poor protection\nagainst the Son of God. By day and by night that awful scene in the\n686 The Desire of Ages\njudgment hall, when they had cried, \u201cHis blood be on us, and on\nour children,\u201d was before them. Matthew 27:25. Nevermore would\nthe memory of that scene fade from their minds. Nevermore would\npeaceful sleep come to their pillows.\nWhen the voice of the mighty angel was heard at Christ\u2019s tomb,\nsaying, Thy Father calls Thee, the Saviour came forth from the grave\nby the life that was in Himself. Now was proved the truth of His\nwords, \u201cI lay down My life, that I might take it again.... I have power\nto lay it down, and I have power to take it again.\u201d Now was fulfilled\nthe prophecy He had spoken to the priests and rulers, \u201cDestroy this\ntemple, and in three days I will raise it up.\u201d John 10:17, 18; 2:19.\nOver the rent sepulcher of Joseph, Christ had proclaimed in\ntriumph, \u201cI am the resurrection, and the life.\u201d These words could\nbe spoken only by the Deity. All created beings live by the will\nand power of God. They are dependent recipients of the life of\nGod. From the highest seraph to the humblest animate being, all are\nreplenished from the Source of life. Only He who is one with God\ncould say, I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to\ntake it again. In His divinity, Christ possessed the power to break\nthe bonds of death.\nChrist arose from the dead as the first fruits of those that slept. He\nwas the antitype of the wave sheaf, and His resurrection took place\non the very day when the wave sheaf was to be presented before the[786]\nLord. For more than a thousand years this symbolic ceremony had\nbeen performed. From the harvest fields the first heads of ripened\ngrain were gathered, and when the people went up to Jerusalem to\nthe Passover, the sheaf of first fruits was waved as a thank offering\nbefore the Lord. Not until this was presented could the sickle be put\nto the grain, and it be gathered into sheaves. The sheaf dedicated to\nGod represented the harvest. So Christ the first fruits represented\nthe great spiritual harvest to be gathered for the kingdom of God.\nHis resurrection is the type and pledge of the resurrection of all the\nrighteous dead. \u201cFor if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,\neven so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him.\u201d 1\nThessalonians 4:14.\nAs Christ arose, He brought from the grave a multitude of cap-\ntives. The earthquake at His death had rent open their graves, and\nwhen He arose, they came forth with Him. They were those who\n\u201cThe Lord Is Risen\u201d 687\nhad been co-laborers with God, and who at the cost of their lives\nhad borne testimony to the truth. Now they were to be witnesses for\nHim who had raised them from the dead.\nDuring His ministry, Jesus had raised the dead to life. He had\nraised the son of the widow of Nain, and the ruler\u2019s daughter and\nLazarus. But these were not clothed with immortality. After they\nwere raised, they were still subject to death. But those who came\nforth from the grave at Christ\u2019s resurrection were raised to everlasting\nlife. They ascended with Him as trophies of His victory over death\nand the grave. These, said Christ, are no longer the captives of Satan;\nI have redeemed them. I have brought them from the grave as the\nfirst fruits of My power, to be with Me where I am, nevermore to\nsee death or experience sorrow.\nThese went into the city, and appeared unto many, declaring,\nChrist has risen from the dead, and we be risen with Him. Thus was\nimmortalized the sacred truth of the resurrection. The risen saints\nbore witness to the truth of the words, \u201cThy dead men shall live,\ntogether with My dead body shall they arise.\u201d Their resurrection was\nan illustration of the fulfillment of the prophecy, \u201cAwake and sing,\nye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the\nearth shall cast out the dead.\u201d Isaiah 26:19.\nTo the believer, Christ is the resurrection and the life. In our\nSaviour the life that was lost through sin is restored; for He has life\nin Himself to quicken whom He will. He is invested with the right [787]\nto give immortality. The life that He laid down in humanity, He\ntakes up again, and gives to humanity. \u201cI am come,\u201d He said, \u201cthat\nthey might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\u201d\n\u201cWhosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never\nthirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of\nwater springing up into everlasting life.\u201d \u201cWhoso eateth My flesh,\nand drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at\nthe last day.\u201d John 10:10; 4:14; John 6:54.\nTo the believer, death is but a small matter. Christ speaks of it as\nif it were of little moment. \u201cIf a man keep My saying, he shall never\nsee death,\u201d \u201che shall never taste of death.\u201d To the Christian, death is\nbut a sleep, a moment of silence and darkness. The life is hid with\nChrist in God, and \u201cwhen Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then\n688 The Desire of Ages\nshall ye also appear with Him in glory.\u201d John 8:51, 52; Colossians\n3:4.\nThe voice that cried from the cross, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d was heard\namong the dead. It pierced the walls of sepulchers, and summoned\nthe sleepers to arise. Thus will it be when the voice of Christ shall\nbe heard from heaven. That voice will penetrate the graves and\nunbar the tombs, and the dead in Christ shall arise. At the Saviour\u2019s\nresurrection a few graves were opened, but at His second coming\nall the precious dead shall hear His voice, and shall come forth to\nglorious, immortal life. The same power that raised Christ from\nthe dead will raise His church, and glorify it with Him, above all\nprincipalities, above all powers, above every name that is named,\nnot only in this world, but also in the world to come.\nChapter 82\u2014\u201cWhy Weepest Thou?\u201d [788]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 28:1, 5-8; Mark 16:1-8; Luke\n24:1-12; John 20:1-18.\nThe women who had stood by the cross of Christ waited and\nwatched for the hours of the Sabbath to pass. On the first day of\nthe week, very early, they made their way to the tomb, taking with\nthem precious spices to anoint the Saviour\u2019s body. They did not\nthink about His rising from the dead. The sun of their hope had set,\nand night had settled down on their hearts. As they walked, they\nrecounted Christ\u2019s works of mercy and His words of comfort. But\nthey remembered not His words, \u201cI will see you again.\u201d John 16:22.\nIgnorant of what was even then taking place, they drew near the\ngarden, saying as they went, \u201cWho shall roll us away the stone from\nthe door of the sepulcher?\u201d They knew that they could not remove\nthe stone, yet they kept on their way. And lo, the heavens were\nsuddenly alight with glory that came not from the rising sun. The\nearth trembled. They saw that the great stone was rolled away. The\ngrave was empty.\nThe women had not all come to the tomb from the same direction.\nMary Magdalene was the first to reach the place; and upon seeing\nthat the stone was removed, she hurried away to tell the disciples.\nMeanwhile the other women came up. A light was shining about the\ntomb, but the body of Jesus was not there. As they lingered about\nthe place, suddenly they saw that they were not alone. A young man\nclothed in shining garments was sitting by the tomb. It was the angel\nwho had rolled away the stone. He had taken the guise of humanity\nthat he might not alarm these friends of Jesus. Yet about him the [789]\nlight of the heavenly glory was still shining, and the women were\nafraid. They turned to flee, but the angel\u2019s words stayed their steps.\n\u201cFear not ye,\u201d he said; \u201cfor I know that ye seek Jesus, which was\ncrucified. He is not here: for He is risen, as He said. Come, see\nthe place where the Lord lay. And go quickly, and tell His disciples\n689\n690 The Desire of Ages\nthat He is risen from the dead.\u201d Again they look into the tomb, and\nagain they hear the wonderful news. Another angel in human form\nis there, and he says, \u201cWhy seek ye the living among the dead? He\nis not here, but is risen: remember how He spake unto you when\nHe was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered\ninto the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise\nagain.\u201d\nHe is risen, He is risen! The women repeat the words again and\nagain. No need now for the anointing spices. The Saviour is living,\nand not dead. They remember now that when speaking of His death\nHe said that He would rise again. What a day is this to the world!\nQuickly the women departed from the sepulcher \u201cwith fear and great\njoy; and did run to bring His disciples word.\u201d\nMary had not heard the good news. She went to Peter and John\nwith the sorrowful message, \u201cThey have taken away the Lord out\nof the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid Him.\u201d The\ndisciples hurried to the tomb, and found it as Mary had said. They\nsaw the shroud and the napkin, but they did not find their Lord. Yet\neven here was testimony that He had risen. The graveclothes were\nnot thrown heedlessly aside, but carefully folded, each in a place\nby itself. John \u201csaw, and believed.\u201d He did not yet understand the\nscripture that Christ must rise from the dead; but he now remembered\nthe Saviour\u2019s words foretelling His resurrection.\nIt was Christ Himself who had placed those graveclothes with\nsuch care. When the mighty angel came down to the tomb, he was\njoined by another, who with his company had been keeping guard\nover the Lord\u2019s body. As the angel from heaven rolled away the\nstone, the other entered the tomb, and unbound the wrappings from\nthe body of Jesus. But it was the Saviour\u2019s hand that folded each,\nand laid it in its place. In His sight who guides alike the star and the\natom, there is nothing unimportant. Order and perfection are seen in\nall His work.\nMary had followed John and Peter to the tomb; when they re-\nturned to Jerusalem, she remained. As she looked into the empty\ntomb, grief filled her heart. Looking in, she saw the two angels, one\nat the head and the other at the foot where Jesus had lain. \u201cWoman,[790]\nwhy weepest thou?\u201d they asked her. \u201cBecause they have taken away\n\u201cWhy Weepest Thou?\u201d 691\nmy Lord,\u201d she answered, \u201cand I know not where they have laid\nHim.\u201d\nThen she turned away, even from the angels, thinking that she\nmust find someone who could tell her what had been done with the\nbody of Jesus. Another voice addressed her, \u201cWoman, why weepest\nthou? whom seekest thou?\u201d Through her tear-dimmed eyes, Mary\nsaw the form of a man, and thinking that it was the gardener, she\nsaid, \u201cSir, if thou have borne Him hence, tell me where thou hast\nlaid Him, and I will take Him away.\u201d If this rich man\u2019s tomb was\nthought too honorable a burial place for Jesus, she herself would\nprovide a place for Him. There was a grave that Christ\u2019s own voice\nhad made vacant, the grave where Lazarus had lain. Might she not\nthere find a burial place for her Lord? She felt that to care for His\nprecious crucified body would be a great consolation to her in her\ngrief.\nBut now in His own familiar voice Jesus said to her, \u201cMary.\u201d\nNow she knew that it was not a stranger who was addressing her, and\nturning she saw before her the living Christ. In her joy she forgot\nthat He had been crucified. Springing toward Him, as if to embrace\nHis feet, she said, \u201cRabboni.\u201d But Christ raised His hand, saying,\nDetain Me not; \u201cfor I am not yet ascended to My Father: but go to\nMy brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto My Father, and your\nFather; and to My God, and your God.\u201d And Mary went her way to\nthe disciples with the joyful message.\nJesus refused to receive the homage of His people until He had\nthe assurance that His sacrifice was accepted by the Father. He\nascended to the heavenly courts, and from God Himself heard the\nassurance that His atonement for the sins of men had been ample,\nthat through His blood all might gain eternal life. The Father ratified\nthe covenant made with Christ, that He would receive repentant and\nobedient men, and would love them even as He loves His Son. Christ\nwas to complete His work, and fulfill His pledge to \u201cmake a man\nmore precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of\nOphir.\u201d Isaiah 13:12. All power in heaven and on earth was given to\nthe Prince of Life, and He returned to His followers in a world of\nsin, that He might impart to them of His power and glory.\nWhile the Saviour was in God\u2019s presence, receiving gifts for His\nchurch, the disciples thought upon His empty tomb, and mourned\n692 The Desire of Ages\nand wept. The day that was a day of rejoicing to all heaven was\nto the disciples a day of uncertainty, confusion, and perplexity.\nTheir unbelief in the testimony of the women gives evidence of[791]\n[792]\n[793]\nhow low their faith had sunk. The news of Christ\u2019s resurrection\nwas so different from what they had anticipated that they could not\nbelieve it. It was too good to be true, they thought. They had heard\nso much of the doctrines and the so-called scientific theories of the\nSadducees that the impression made on their minds in regard to the\nresurrection was vague. They scarcely knew what the resurrection\nfrom the dead could mean. They were unable to take in the great\nsubject.\n\u201cGo your way,\u201d the angels had said to the women, \u201ctell His\ndisciples and Peter that He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall\nye see Him, as He said unto you.\u201d These angels had been with Christ\nas guardian angels throughout His life on earth. They had witnessed\nHis trial and crucifixion. They had heard His words to His disciples.\nThis was shown by their message to the disciples, and should have\nconvinced them of its truth. Such words could have come only from\nthe messengers of their risen Lord.\n\u201cTell His disciples and Peter,\u201d the angels said. Since the death\nof Christ, Peter had been bowed down with remorse. His shameful\ndenial of the Lord, and the Saviour\u2019s look of love and anguish, were\never before him. Of all the disciples he had suffered most bitterly.\nTo him the assurance is given that his repentance is accepted and his\nsin forgiven. He is mentioned by name.\n\u201cTell His disciples and Peter that He goeth before you into\nGalilee: there shall ye see Him.\u201d All the disciples had forsaken\nJesus, and the call to meet Him again includes them all. He has not\ncast them off. When Mary Magdalene told them she had seen the\nLord, she repeated the call to the meeting in Galilee. And a third\ntime the message was sent to them. After He had ascended to the\nFather, Jesus appeared to the other women, saying, \u201cAll hail. And\nthey came and held Him by the feet, and worshiped Him. Then said\nJesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell My brethren that they go into\nGalilee, and there shall they see Me.\u201d\nChrist\u2019s first work on earth after His resurrection was to convince\nHis disciples of His undiminished love and tender regard for them.\nTo give them proof that He was their living Saviour, that He had\n\u201cWhy Weepest Thou?\u201d 693\nbroken the fetters of the tomb, and could no longer be held by the\nenemy death; to reveal that He had the same heart of love as when\nHe was with them as their beloved Teacher, He appeared to them\nagain and again. He would draw the bonds of love still closer around\nthem. Go tell My brethren, He said, that they meet Me in Galilee.\nAs they heard this appointment, so definitely given, the disciples [794]\nbegan to think of Christ\u2019s words to them foretelling His resurrection.\nBut even now they did not rejoice. They could not cast off their\ndoubt and perplexity. Even when the women declared that they had\nseen the Lord, the disciples would not believe. They thought them\nunder an illusion.\nTrouble seemed crowding upon trouble. On the sixth day of the\nweek they had seen their Master die; on the first day of the next week\nthey found themselves deprived of His body, and they were accused\nof having stolen it away for the sake of deceiving the people. They\ndespaired of ever correcting the false impressions that were gaining\nground against them. They feared the enmity of the priests and the\nwrath of the people. They longed for the presence of Jesus, who had\nhelped them in every perplexity.\nOften they repeated the words, \u201cWe trusted that it had been He\nwhich should have redeemed Israel.\u201d Lonely and sick at heart they\nremembered His words, \u201cIf they do these things in a green tree, what\nshall be done in the dry?\u201d Luke 24:21; 23:31. They met together in\nthe upper chamber, and closed and fastened the doors, knowing that\nthe fate of their beloved Teacher might at any time be theirs.\nAnd all the time they might have been rejoicing in the knowledge\nof a risen Saviour. In the garden, Mary had stood weeping, when\nJesus was close beside her. Her eyes were so blinded by tears that\nshe did not discern Him. And the hearts of the disciples were so full\nof grief that they did not believe the angels\u2019 message or the words\nof Christ Himself.\nHow many are still doing what these disciples did! How many\necho Mary\u2019s despairing cry, \u201cThey have taken away the Lord, ...\nand we know not where they have laid Him\u201d! To how many might\nthe Saviour\u2019s words be spoken, \u201cWhy weepest thou? whom seekest\nthou?\u201d He is close beside them, but their tear-blinded eyes do not\ndiscern Him. He speaks to them, but they do not understand.\n694 The Desire of Ages\nOh that the bowed head might be lifted, that the eyes might be\nopened to behold Him, that the ears might listen to His voice! \u201cGo\nquickly, and tell His disciples that He is risen.\u201d Bid them look not to\nJoseph\u2019s new tomb, that was closed with a great stone, and sealed\nwith the Roman seal. Christ is not there. Look not to the empty\nsepulcher. Mourn not as those who are hopeless and helpless. Jesus\nlives, and because He lives, we shall live also. From grateful hearts,\nfrom lips touched with holy fire, let the glad song ring out, Christ is\nrisen! He lives to make intercession for us. Grasp this hope, and it\nwill hold the soul like a sure, tried anchor. Believe, and thou shalt\nsee the glory of God.\nChapter 83\u2014The Walk to Emmaus [795]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 24:13-33.\nLate in the afternoon of the day of the resurrection, two of the\ndisciples were on their way to Emmaus, a little town eight miles\nfrom Jerusalem. These disciples had had no prominent place in\nChrist\u2019s work, but they were earnest believers in Him. They had\ncome to the city to keep the Passover, and were greatly perplexed by\nthe events that had recently taken place. They had heard the news\nof the morning in regard to the removal of Christ\u2019s body from the\ntomb, and also the report of the women who had seen the angels and\nhad met Jesus. They were now returning to their homes to meditate\nand pray. Sadly they pursued their evening walk, talking over the\nscenes of the trial and the crucifixion. Never before had they been\nso utterly disheartened. Hopeless and faithless, they were walking\nin the shadow of the cross.\nThey had not advanced far on their journey when they were\njoined by a stranger, but they were so absorbed in their gloom and\ndisappointment that they did not observe him closely. They contin-\nued their conversation, expressing the thoughts of their hearts. They\nwere reasoning in regard to the lessons that Christ had given, which\nthey seemed unable to comprehend. As they talked of the events that\nhad taken place, Jesus longed to comfort them. He had seen their\ngrief; He understood the conflicting, perplexing ideas that brought\nto their minds the thought, Can this Man, who suffered Himself to [796]\nbe so humiliated, be the Christ? Their grief could not be restrained,\nand they wept. Jesus knew that their hearts were bound up with Him\nin love, and He longed to wipe away their tears, and fill them with\njoy and gladness. But He must first give them lessons they would\nnever forget.\n\u201cHe said unto them, What manner of communications are these\nthat ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? And the\none of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto Him,\n695\n696 The Desire of Ages\nArt Thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the\nthings which are come to pass there in these days?\u201d They told Him\nof their disappointment in regard to their Master, \u201cwhich was a\nprophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;\u201d\nbut \u201cthe chief priests and our rulers,\u201d they said, \u201cdelivered Him to be\ncondemned to death, and have crucified Him.\u201d With hearts sore with\ndisappointment, and with quivering lips, they added, \u201cWe trusted\nthat it had been He which should have redeemed Israel: and beside\nall this, today is the third day since these things were done.\u201d\nStrange that the disciples did not remember Christ\u2019s words, and\nrealize that He had foretold the events which had come to pass!\nThey did not realize that the last part of His disclosure would be just\nas verily fulfilled as the first part, that the third day He would rise\nagain. This was the part they should have remembered. The priests\nand rulers did not forget this. On the day \u201cthat followed the day of\nthe preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto\nPilate, saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while He\nwas yet alive, After three days I will rise again.\u201d Matthew 27:62, 63.\nBut the disciples did not remember these words.\n\u201cThen He said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe\nall that the prophets have spoken: ought not Christ to have suffered\nthese things, and to enter into His glory?\u201d The disciples wondered\nwho this stranger could be, that He should penetrate to their very\nsouls, and speak with such earnestness, tenderness, and sympathy,\nand with such hopefulness. For the first time since Christ\u2019s betrayal,\nthey began to feel hopeful. Often they looked earnestly at their\ncompanion, and thought that His words were just the words that\nChrist would have spoken. They were filled with amazement, and\ntheir hearts began to throb with joyful expectation.\nBeginning at Moses, the very Alpha of Bible history, Christ ex-\npounded in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. Had\nHe first made Himself known to them, their hearts would have been[797]\n[798]\n[799]\nsatisfied. In the fullness of their joy they would have hungered for\nnothing more. But it was necessary for them to understand the wit-\nness borne to Him by the types and prophecies of the Old Testament.\nUpon these their faith must be established. Christ performed no\nmiracle to convince them, but it was His first work to explain the\nScriptures. They had looked upon His death as the destruction of\nWalk to Emmaus 697\nall their hopes. Now He showed from the prophets that this was the\nvery strongest evidence for their faith.\nIn teaching these disciples, Jesus showed the importance of\nthe Old Testament as a witness to His mission. Many professed\nChristians now discard the Old Testament, claiming that it is no\nlonger of any use. But such is not Christ\u2019s teaching. So highly did\nHe value it that at one time He said, \u201cIf they hear not Moses and the\nprophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the\ndead.\u201d Luke 16:31.\nIt is the voice of Christ that speaks through patriarchs and\nprophets, from the days of Adam even to the closing scenes of\ntime. The Saviour is revealed in the Old Testament as clearly as in\nthe New. It is the light from the prophetic past that brings out the\nlife of Christ and the teachings of the New Testament with clearness\nand beauty. The miracles of Christ are a proof of His divinity; but\na stronger proof that He is the world\u2019s Redeemer is found in com-\nparing the prophecies of the Old Testament with the history of the\nNew.\nReasoning from prophecy, Christ gave His disciples a correct\nidea of what He was to be in humanity. Their expectation of a\nMessiah who was to take His throne and kingly power in accordance\nwith the desires of men had been misleading. It would interfere with\na correct apprehension of His descent from the highest to the lowest\nposition that could be occupied. Christ desired that the ideas of His\ndisciples might be pure and true in every specification. They must\nunderstand as far as possible in regard to the cup of suffering that had\nbeen apportioned to Him. He showed them that the awful conflict\nwhich they could not yet comprehend was the fulfillment of the\ncovenant made before the foundation of the world was laid. Christ\nmust die, as every transgressor of the law must die if he continues in\nsin. All this was to be, but it was not to end in defeat, but in glorious,\neternal victory. Jesus told them that every effort must be made to\nsave the world from sin. His followers must live as He lived, and\nwork as He worked, with intense, persevering effort.\nThus Christ discoursed to His disciples, opening their minds that [800]\nthey might understand the Scriptures. The disciples were weary,\nbut the conversation did not flag. Words of life and assurance fell\nfrom the Saviour\u2019s lips. But still their eyes were holden. As He\n698 The Desire of Ages\ntold them of the overthrow of Jerusalem, they looked upon the\ndoomed city with weeping. But little did they yet suspect who their\ntraveling companion was. They did not think that the subject of\ntheir conversation was walking by their side; for Christ referred to\nHimself as though He were another person. They thought that He\nwas one of those who had been in attendance at the great feast, and\nwho was now returning to his home. He walked as carefully as they\nover the rough stones, now and then halting with them for a little\nrest. Thus they proceeded along the mountainous road, while the\nOne who was soon to take His position at God\u2019s right hand, and\nwho could say, \u201cAll power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth,\u201d\nwalked beside them. Matthew 28:18.\nDuring the journey the sun had gone down, and before the trav-\nelers reached their place of rest, the laborers in the fields had left\ntheir work. As the disciples were about to enter their home, the\nstranger appeared as though He would continue His journey. But\nthe disciples felt drawn to Him. Their souls hungered to hear more\nfrom Him. \u201cAbide with us,\u201d they said. He did not seem to accept\nthe invitation, but they pressed it upon Him, urging, \u201cIt is toward\nevening, and the day is far spent.\u201d Christ yielded to this entreaty and\n\u201cwent in to tarry with them.\u201d\nHad the disciples failed to press their invitation, they would\nnot have known that their traveling companion was the risen Lord.\nChrist never forces His company upon anyone. He interests Himself\nin those who need Him. Gladly will He enter the humblest home,\nand cheer the lowliest heart. But if men are too indifferent to think\nof the heavenly Guest, or ask Him to abide with them, He passes on.\nThus many meet with great loss. They do not know Christ any more\nthan did the disciples as He walked with them by the way.\nThe simple evening meal of bread is soon prepared. It is placed\nbefore the guest, who has taken His seat at the head of the table.\nNow He puts forth His hands to bless the food. The disciples start\nback in astonishment. Their companion spreads forth His hands in\nexactly the same way as their Master used to do. They look again,\nand lo, they see in His hands the print of nails. Both exclaim at once,\nIt is the Lord Jesus! He has risen from the dead!\nThey rise to cast themselves at His feet and worship Him, but[801]\nHe has vanished out of their sight. They look at the place which had\nWalk to Emmaus 699\nbeen occupied by One whose body had lately lain in the grave, and\nsay to each other, \u201cDid not our heart burn within us, while He talked\nwith us by the way, and while He opened to us the Scriptures?\u201d\nBut with this great news to communicate they cannot sit and\ntalk. Their weariness and hunger are gone. They leave their meal\nuntasted, and full of joy immediately set out again on the same path\nby which they came, hurrying to tell the tidings to the disciples in the\ncity. In some parts the road is not safe, but they climb over the steep\nplaces, slipping on the smooth rocks. They do not see, they do not\nknow, that they have the protection of Him who has traveled the road\nwith them. With their pilgrim staff in hand, they press on, desiring\nto go faster than they dare. They lose their track, but find it again.\nSometimes running, sometimes stumbling, they press forward, their\nunseen Companion close beside them all the way.\nThe night is dark, but the Sun of Righteousness is shining upon\nthem. Their hearts leap for joy. They seem to be in a new world.\nChrist is a living Saviour. They no longer mourn over Him as\ndead. Christ is risen\u2014over and over again they repeat it. This is\nthe message they are carrying to the sorrowing ones. They must tell\nthem the wonderful story of the walk to Emmaus. They must tell\nwho joined them by the way. They carry the greatest message ever\ngiven to the world, a message of glad tidings upon which the hopes\nof the human family for time and for eternity depend.\nChapter 84\u2014\u201cPeace Be Unto You\u201d[802]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 24:33-48; John 20:19-29.\nOn reaching Jerusalem the two disciples enter at the eastern gate,\nwhich is open at night on festal occasions. The houses are dark and\nsilent, but the travelers make their way through the narrow streets by\nthe light of the rising moon. They go to the upper chamber where\nJesus spent the hours of the last evening before His death. Here they\nknow that their brethren are to be found. Late as it is, they know\nthat the disciples will not sleep till they learn for a certainty what\nhas become of the body of their Lord. They find the door of the\nchamber securely barred. They knock for admission, but no answer\ncomes. All is still. Then they give their names. The door is carefully\nunbarred, they enter, and Another, unseen, enters with them. Then\nthe door is again fastened, to keep out spies.\nThe travelers find all in surprised excitement. The voices of\nthose in the room break out into thanksgiving and praise, saying,\n\u201cThe Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.\u201d Then the\ntwo travelers, panting with the haste with which they have made\ntheir journey, tell the wondrous story of how Jesus has appeared to\nthem. They have just ended, and some are saying that they cannot\nbelieve it, for it is too good to be true, when behold, another Person\nstands before them. Every eye is fastened upon the stranger. No\none has knocked for entrance. No footstep has been heard. The[803]\ndisciples are startled, and wonder what it means. Then they hear a\nvoice which is no other than the voice of their Master. Clear and\ndistinct the words fall from His lips, \u201cPeace be unto you.\u201d\n\u201cBut they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they\nhad seen a spirit. And He said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and\nwhy do thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold My hands and My\nfeet, that it is I Myself: handle Me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh\nand bones, as ye see Me have. And when He had thus spoken, He\nshowed them His hands and His feet.\u201d\n700\n\u201cPeace Be Unto You\u201d 701\nThey beheld the hands and feet marred by the cruel nails. They\nrecognized His voice, like no other they had ever heard. \u201cAnd while\nthey yet believed not for joy, and wondered, He said unto them,\nHave ye here any meat? And they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish,\nand of an honeycomb. And He took it, and did eat before them.\u201d\n\u201cThen were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.\u201d Faith and\njoy took the place of unbelief, and with feelings which no words\ncould express they acknowledged their risen Saviour.\nAt the birth of Jesus the angel announced, Peace on earth, and\ngood will to men. And now at His first appearance to the disciples\nafter His resurrection, the Saviour addressed them with the blessed\nwords, \u201cPeace be unto you.\u201d Jesus is ever ready to speak peace to [804]\nsouls that are burdened with doubts and fears. He waits for us to\nopen the door of the heart to Him, and say, Abide with us. He says,\n\u201cBehold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice,\nand open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and\nhe with Me.\u201d Revelation 3:20.\nThe resurrection of Jesus was a type of the final resurrection of\nall who sleep in Him. The countenance of the risen Saviour, His\nmanner, His speech, were all familiar to His disciples. As Jesus\narose from the dead, so those who sleep in Him are to rise again.\nWe shall know our friends, even as the disciples knew Jesus. They\nmay have been deformed, diseased, or disfigured, in this mortal life,\nand they rise in perfect health and symmetry; yet in the glorified\nbody their identity will be perfectly preserved. Then shall we know\neven as also we are known. 1 Corinthians 13:12. In the face radiant\nwith the light shining from the face of Jesus, we shall recognize the\nlineaments of those we love.\nWhen Jesus met with His disciples, He reminded them of the\nwords He had spoken to them before His death, that all things must\nbe fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and in the\nprophets, and in the Psalm concerning Him. \u201cThen opened He their\nunderstanding, that they might understand the Scriptures, and said\nunto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, [805]\nand to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and\nremission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations,\nbeginning at Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these things.\u201d\n702 The Desire of Ages\nThe disciples began to realize the nature and extent of their work.\nThey were to proclaim to the world the wonderful truths which\nChrist had entrusted to them. The events of His life, His death\nand resurrection, the prophecies that pointed to these events, the\nsacredness of the law of God, the mysteries of the plan of salvation,\nthe power of Jesus for the remission of sins,\u2014to all these things they\nwere witnesses, and they were to make them known to the world.\nThey were to proclaim the gospel of peace and salvation through\nrepentance and the power of the Saviour.\n\u201cAnd when He had said this, He breathed on them, and saith unto\nthem, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: Whosesoever sins ye remit, they\nare remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are\nretained.\u201d The Holy Spirit was not yet fully manifested; for Christ\nhad not yet been glorified. The more abundant impartation of the\nSpirit did not take place till after Christ\u2019s ascension. Not until this\nwas received could the disciples fulfill the commission to preach\nthe gospel to the world. But the Spirit was now given for a special\npurpose. Before the disciples could fulfill their official duties in\nconnection with the church, Christ breathed His Spirit upon them.\nHe was committing to them a most sacred trust, and He desired to\nimpress them with the fact that without the Holy Spirit this work\ncould not be accomplished.\nThe Holy Spirit is the breath of spiritual life in the soul. The\nimpartation of the Spirit is the impartation of the life of Christ. It\nimbues the receiver with the attributes of Christ. Only those who are\nthus taught of God, those who possess the inward working of the\nSpirit, and in whose life the Christ-life is manifested, are to stand as\nrepresentative men, to minister in behalf of the church.\n\u201cWhosesoever sins ye remit,\u201d said Christ, \u201cthey are remitted; ...\nand whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.\u201d Christ here gives\nno liberty for any man to pass judgment upon others. In the Sermon\non the Mount He forbade this. It is the prerogative of God. But\non the church in its organized capacity He places a responsibility\nfor the individual members. Toward those who fall into sin, the\nchurch has a duty, to warn, to instruct, and if possible to restore.\n\u201cReprove, rebuke, exhort,\u201d the Lord says, \u201cwith all long-suffering\nand doctrine.\u201d 2 Timothy 4:2. Deal faithfully with wrongdoing.[806]\nWarn every soul that is in danger. Leave none to deceive themselves.\n\u201cPeace Be Unto You\u201d 703\nCall sin by its right name. Declare what God has said in regard\nto lying, Sabbathbreaking, stealing, idolatry, and every other evil.\n\u201cThey which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\u201d\nGalatians 5:21. If they persist in sin, the judgment you have declared\nfrom God\u2019s word is pronounced upon them in heaven. In choosing\nto sin, they disown Christ; the church must show that she does not\nsanction their deeds, or she herself dishonors her Lord. She must\nsay about sin what God says about it. She must deal with it as God\ndirects, and her action is ratified in heaven. He who despises the\nauthority of the church despises the authority of Christ Himself.\nBut there is a brighter side to the picture. \u201cWhosesoever sins\nye remit, they are remitted.\u201d Let this thought be kept uppermost.\nIn labor for the erring, let every eye be directed to Christ. Let the\nshepherds have a tender care for the flock of the Lord\u2019s pasture. Let\nthem speak to the erring of the forgiving mercy of the Saviour. Let\nthem encourage the sinner to repent, and believe in Him who can\npardon. Let them declare, on the authority of God\u2019s word, \u201cIf we\nconfess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and\nto cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\u201d 1 John 1:9. All who repent\nhave the assurance, \u201cHe will have compassion upon us; He will\nsubdue our iniquities; and Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths\nof the sea.\u201d Micah 7:19.\nLet the repentance of the sinner be accepted by the church with\ngrateful hearts. Let the repenting one be led out from the darkness of\nunbelief into the light of faith and righteousness. Let his trembling\nhand be placed in the loving hand of Jesus. Such a remission is\nratified in heaven.\nOnly in this sense has the church power to absolve the sinner.\nRemission of sins can be obtained only through the merits of Christ.\nTo no man, to no body of men, is given power to free the soul\nfrom guilt. Christ charged His disciples to preach the remission of\nsins in His name among all nations; but they themselves were not\nempowered to remove one stain of sin. The name of Jesus is the\nonly \u201cname under heaven given among men, whereby we must be\nsaved.\u201d Acts 4:12.\nWhen Jesus first met the disciples in the upper chamber, Thomas\nwas not with them. He heard the reports of the others, and received\nabundant proof that Jesus had risen; but gloom and unbelief filled his\n704 The Desire of Ages\nheart. As he heard the disciples tell of the wonderful manifestations\nof the risen Saviour, it only plunged him in deeper despair. If Jesus\nhad really risen from the dead, there could be no further hope of a[807]\nliteral earthly kingdom. And it wounded his vanity to think that his\nMaster should reveal Himself to all the disciples except him. He was\ndetermined not to believe, and for a whole week he brooded over his\nwretchedness, which seemed all the darker in contrast with the hope\nand faith of his brethren.\nDuring this time he repeatedly declared, \u201cExcept I shall see in\nHis hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print\nof the nails, and thrust my hand into His side, I will not believe.\u201d\nHe would not see through the eyes of his brethren, or exercise faith\nwhich was dependent upon their testimony. He ardently loved his\nLord, but he had allowed jealousy and unbelief to take possession of\nhis mind and heart.\nA number of the disciples now made the familiar upper chamber\ntheir temporary home, and at evening all except Thomas gathered\nhere. One evening Thomas determined to meet with the others.\nNotwithstanding his unbelief, he had a faint hope that the good\nnews was true. While the disciples were taking their evening meal,\nthey talked of the evidences which Christ had given them in the\nprophecies. \u201cThen came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in\nthe midst, and said, Peace be unto you.\u201d\nTurning to Thomas He said, \u201cReach hither thy finger, and behold\nMy hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into My side: and\nbe not faithless, but believing.\u201d These words showed that He was\nacquainted with the thoughts and words of Thomas. The doubting\ndisciple knew that none of his companions had seen Jesus for a week.\nThey could not have told the Master of his unbelief. He recognized\nthe One before him as his Lord. He had no desire for further proof.\nHis heart leaped for joy, and he cast himself at the feet of Jesus\ncrying, \u201cMy Lord and my God.\u201d\nJesus accepted his acknowledgment, but gently reproved his\nunbelief: \u201cThomas, because thou hast seen Me, thou hast believed:\nblessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.\u201d The faith\nof Thomas would have been more pleasing to Christ if he had been\nwilling to believe upon the testimony of his brethren. Should the\nworld now follow the example of Thomas, no one would believe\n\u201cPeace Be Unto You\u201d 705\nunto salvation; for all who receive Christ must do so through the\ntestimony of others.\nMany who are given to doubt excuse themselves by saying that\nif they had the evidence which Thomas had from his companions,\nthey would believe. They do not realize that they have not only\nthat evidence, but much more. Many who, like Thomas, wait for [808]\nall cause of doubt to be removed, will never realize their desire.\nThey gradually become confirmed in unbelief. Those who educate\nthemselves to look on the dark side, and murmur and complain,\nknow not what they do. They are sowing the seeds of doubt, and\nthey will have a harvest of doubt to reap. At a time when faith\nand confidence are most essential, many will thus find themselves\npowerless to hope and believe.\nIn His treatment of Thomas, Jesus gave a lesson for His followers.\nHis example shows how we should treat those whose faith is weak,\nand who make their doubts prominent. Jesus did not overwhelm\nThomas with reproach, nor did He enter into controversy with him.\nHe revealed Himself to the doubting one. Thomas had been most\nunreasonable in dictating the conditions of his faith, but Jesus, by\nHis generous love and consideration, broke down all the barriers.\nUnbelief is seldom overcome by controversy. It is rather put upon\nself-defense, and finds new support and excuse. But let Jesus, in His\nlove and mercy, be revealed as the crucified Saviour, and from many\nonce unwilling lips will be heard the acknowledgment of Thomas,\n\u201cMy Lord and my God.\u201d\nChapter 85\u2014By the Sea Once More[809]\nThis chapter is based on John 21:1-22.\nJesus had appointed to meet His disciples in Galilee; and soon\nafter the Passover week was ended, they bent their steps thither.\nTheir absence from Jerusalem during the feast would have been\ninterpreted as disaffection and heresy, therefore they remained till\nits close; but this over, they gladly turned homeward to meet the\nSaviour as He had directed.\nSeven of the disciples were in company. They were clad in the\nhumble garb of fishermen; they were poor in worldly goods, but\nrich in the knowledge and practice of the truth, which in the sight\nof Heaven gave them the highest rank as teachers. They had not\nbeen students in the schools of the prophets, but for three years they\nhad been taught by the greatest Educator the world has ever known.\nUnder His instruction they had become elevated, intelligent, and\nrefined, agents through whom men might be led to a knowledge of\nthe truth.\nMuch of the time of Christ\u2019s ministry had been passed near the\nSea of Galilee. As the disciples gathered in a place where they were\nnot likely to be disturbed, they found themselves surrounded by\nreminders of Jesus and His mighty works. On this sea, when their\nhearts were filled with terror, and the fierce storm was hurrying them\nto destruction, Jesus had walked upon the billows to their rescue.\nHere the tempest had been hushed by His word. Within sight was\nthe beach where above ten thousand persons had been fed from a\nfew small loaves and fishes. Not far distant was Capernaum, the\nscene of so many miracles. As the disciples looked upon the scene,[810]\ntheir minds were full of the words and deeds of their Saviour.\nThe evening was pleasant, and Peter, who still had much of his\nold love for boats and fishing, proposed that they should go out upon\nthe sea and cast their nets. In this plan all were ready to join; they\nwere in need of food and clothing, which the proceeds of a successful\n706\nBy the Sea Once More 707\nnight\u2019s fishing would supply. So they went out in their boat, but\nthey caught nothing. All night they toiled, without success. Through\nthe weary hours they talked of their absent Lord, and recalled the\nwonderful events they had witnessed in His ministry beside the sea.\nThey questioned as to their own future, and grew sad at the prospect\nbefore them.\nAll the while a lone watcher upon the shore followed them with\nHis eye, while He Himself was unseen. At length the morning\ndawned. The boat was but a little way from the shore, and the\ndisciples saw a stranger standing upon the beach, who accosted\nthem with the question, \u201cChildren, have ye any meat?\u201d When they\nanswered, \u201cNo,\u201d \u201cHe said unto them, Cast the net on the right side\nof the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they\nwere not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.\u201d\nJohn recognized the stranger, and exclaimed to Peter, \u201cIt is the\nLord.\u201d Peter was so elated and so glad that in his eagerness he cast\nhimself into the water and was soon standing by the side of his\nMaster. The other disciples came in their boat, dragging the net with\nfishes. \u201cAs soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of\ncoals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.\u201d\nThey were too much amazed to question whence came the fire\nand the food. \u201cJesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye\nhave now caught.\u201d Peter rushed for the net, which he had dropped,\nand helped his brethren drag it to the shore. After the work was\ndone, and the preparation made, Jesus bade the disciples come and\ndine. He broke the food, and divided it among them, and was known\nand acknowledged by all the seven. The miracle of feeding the five\nthousand on the mountainside was now brought to their minds; but\na mysterious awe was upon them, and in silence they gazed upon\nthe risen Saviour.\nVividly they recalled the scene beside the sea when Jesus had\nbidden them follow Him. They remembered how, at His command,\nthey had launched out into the deep, and had let down their net, and\nthe catch had been so abundant as to fill the net, even to breaking.\nThen Jesus had called them to leave their fishing boats, and had\npromised to make them fishers of men. It was to bring this scene [811]\nto their minds, and to deepen its impression, that He had again\nperformed the miracle. His act was a renewal of the commission\n708 The Desire of Ages\nto the disciples. It showed them that the death of their Master had\nnot lessened their obligation to do the work He had assigned them.\nThough they were to be deprived of His personal companionship,\nand of the means of support by their former employment, the risen\nSaviour would still have a care for them. While they were doing His\nwork, He would provide for their needs. And Jesus had a purpose in\nbidding them cast their net on the right side of the ship. On that side\nHe stood upon the shore. That was the side of faith. If they labored\nin connection with Him,\u2014His divine power combining with their\nhuman effort,\u2014they could not fail of success.\nAnother lesson Christ had to give, relating especially to Peter.\nPeter\u2019s denial of his Lord had been in shameful contrast to his former\nprofessions of loyalty. He had dishonored Christ, and had incurred\nthe distrust of his brethren. They thought he would not be allowed\nto take his former position among them, and he himself felt that\nhe had forfeited his trust. Before being called to take up again\nhis apostolic work, he must before them all give evidence of his\nrepentance. Without this, his sin, though repented of, might have\ndestroyed his influence as a minister of Christ. The Saviour gave\nhim opportunity to regain the confidence of his brethren, and, so far\nas possible, to remove the reproach he had brought upon the gospel.\nHere is given a lesson for all Christ\u2019s followers. The gospel\nmakes no compromise with evil. It cannot excuse sin. Secret sins are\nto be confessed in secret to God; but, for open sin, open confession\nis required. The reproach of the disciple\u2019s sin is cast upon Christ. It\ncauses Satan to triumph, and wavering souls to stumble. By giving\nproof of repentance, the disciple, so far as lies in his power, is to\nremove this reproach.\nWhile Christ and the disciples were eating together by the sea-\nside, the Saviour said to Peter, \u201cSimon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me\nmore than these?\u201d referring to his brethren. Peter had once declared,\n\u201cThough all men shall be offended because of Thee, yet will I never\nbe offended.\u201d Matthew 26:33. But he now put a truer estimate upon\nhimself. \u201cYea, Lord,\u201d he said, \u201cThou knowest that I love Thee.\u201d\nThere is no vehement assurance that his love is greater than that of\nhis brethren. He does not express his own opinion of his devotion.\nTo Him who can read all the motives of the heart he appeals to judge\nBy the Sea Once More 709\nas to his sincerity,\u2014\u201cThou knowest that I love Thee.\u201d And Jesus\nbids him, \u201cFeed My lambs.\u201d\nAgain Jesus applied the test to Peter, repeating His former words: [812]\n\u201cSimon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me?\u201d This time He did not ask\nPeter whether he loved Him better than did his brethren. The second\nresponse was like the first, free from extravagant assurance: \u201cYea,\nLord; Thou knowest that I love Thee.\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cFeed My\nsheep.\u201d Once more the Saviour put the trying question: \u201cSimon,\nson of Jonas, lovest thou Me?\u201d Peter was grieved; he thought that\nJesus doubted his love. He knew that his Lord had cause to distrust\nhim, and with an aching heart he answered, \u201cLord, Thou knowest\nall things; Thou knowest that I love Thee.\u201d Again Jesus said to him,\n\u201cFeed My sheep.\u201d\nThree times Peter had openly denied his Lord, and three times\nJesus drew from him the assurance of his love and loyalty, pressing\nhome that pointed question, like a barbed arrow to his wounded\nheart. Before the assembled disciples Jesus revealed the depth of\nPeter\u2019s repentance, and showed how thoroughly humbled was the\nonce boasting disciple.\nPeter was naturally forward and impulsive, and Satan had taken\nadvantage of these characteristics to overthrow him. Just before the\nfall of Peter, Jesus had said to him, \u201cSatan hath desired to have you,\nthat he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy\nfaith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\u201d\nLuke 22:31, 32. That time had now come, and the transformation\nin Peter was evident. The close, testing questions of the Lord had\nnot called out one forward, self-sufficient reply; and because of\nhis humiliation and repentance, Peter was better prepared than ever\nbefore to act as shepherd to the flock.\nThe first work that Christ entrusted to Peter on restoring him to\nthe ministry was to feed the lambs. This was a work in which Peter\nhad little experience. It would require great care and tenderness,\nmuch patience and perseverance. It called him to minister to those\nwho were young in the faith, to teach the ignorant, to open the\nScriptures to them, and to educate them for usefulness in Christ\u2019s\nservice. Heretofore Peter had not been fitted to do this, or even to\nunderstand its importance. But this was the work which Jesus now\n710 The Desire of Ages\ncalled upon him to do. For this work his own experience of suffering\nand repentance had prepared him.\nBefore his fall, Peter was always speaking unadvisedly, from the\nimpulse of the moment. He was always ready to correct others, and\nto express his mind, before he had a clear comprehension of himself\nor of what he had to say. But the converted Peter was very different.\nHe retained his former fervor, but the grace of Christ regulated his\nzeal. He was no longer impetuous, self-confident, and self-exalted,\nbut calm, self-possessed, and teachable. He could then feed the[813]\n[814]\n[815]\nlambs as well as the sheep of Christ\u2019s flock.\nThe Saviour\u2019s manner of dealing with Peter had a lesson for\nhim and for his brethren. It taught them to meet the transgressor\nwith patience, sympathy, and forgiving love. Although Peter had\ndenied his Lord, the love which Jesus bore him never faltered. Just\nsuch love should the undershepherd feel for the sheep and lambs\ncommitted to his care. Remembering his own weakness and failure,\nPeter was to deal with his flock as tenderly as Christ had dealt with\nhim.\nThe question that Christ had put to Peter was significant. He\nmentioned only one condition of discipleship and service. \u201cLovest\nthou Me?\u201d He said. This is the essential qualification. Though\nPeter might possess every other, yet without the love of Christ he\ncould not be a faithful shepherd over the Lord\u2019s flock. Knowledge,\nbenevolence, eloquence, gratitude, and zeal are all aids in the good\nwork; but without the love of Jesus in the heart, the work of the\nChristian minister is a failure.\nJesus walked alone with Peter, for there was something which\nHe wished to communicate to him only. Before His death, Jesus had\nsaid to him, \u201cWhither I go, thou canst not follow Me now; but thou\nshalt follow Me afterwards.\u201d To this Peter had replied, \u201cLord, why\ncannot I follow Thee now? I will lay down my life for Thy sake.\u201d\nJohn 13:36, 37. When he said this, he little knew to what heights and\ndepths Christ\u2019s feet would lead the way. Peter had failed when the\ntest came, but again he was to have opportunity to prove his love for\nChrist. That he might be strengthened for the final test of his faith,\nthe Saviour opened to him his future. He told him that after living a\nlife of usefulness, when age was telling upon his strength, he would\nindeed follow his Lord. Jesus said, \u201cWhen thou wast young, thou\nBy the Sea Once More 711\ngirdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou\nshalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall\ngird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. This spake He,\nsignifying by what death he should glorify God.\u201d\nJesus thus made known to Peter the very manner of his death; He\neven foretold the stretching forth of his hands upon the cross. Again\nHe bade His disciple, \u201cFollow Me.\u201d Peter was not disheartened by\nthe revelation. He felt willing to suffer any death for his Lord.\nHeretofore Peter had known Christ after the flesh, as many know\nHim now; but he was no more to be thus limited. He knew Him no\nmore as he had known Him in his association with Him in humanity.\nHe had loved Him as a man, as a heaven-sent teacher; he now loved [816]\nHim as God. He had been learning the lesson that to him Christ\nwas all in all. Now he was prepared to share in his Lord\u2019s mission\nof sacrifice. When at last brought to the cross, he was, at his own\nrequest, crucified with his head downward. He thought it too great\nan honor to suffer in the same way as his Master did.\nTo Peter the words \u201cFollow Me\u201d were full of instruction. Not\nonly for his death, but for every step of his life, was the lesson given.\nHitherto Peter had been inclined to act independently. He had tried\nto plan for the work of God, instead of waiting to follow out God\u2019s\nplan. But he could gain nothing by rushing on before the Lord. Jesus\nbids him, \u201cFollow Me.\u201d Do not run ahead of Me. Then you will not\nhave the hosts of Satan to meet alone. Let Me go before you, and\nyou will not be overcome by the enemy.\nAs Peter walked beside Jesus, he saw that John was following.\nA desire came over him to know his future, and he \u201csaith to Jesus,\nLord, and what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will\nthat he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou Me.\u201d Peter\nshould have considered that his Lord would reveal to him all that it\nwas best for him to know. It is the duty of everyone to follow Christ,\nwithout undue anxiety as to the work assigned to others. In saying\nof John, \u201cIf I will that he tarry till I come,\u201d Jesus gave no assurance\nthat this disciple should live until the Lord\u2019s second coming. He\nmerely asserted His own supreme power, and that even if He should\nwill this to be so, it would in no way affect Peter\u2019s work. The future\nof both John and Peter was in the hands of their Lord. Obedience in\nfollowing Him was the duty required of each.\n712 The Desire of Ages\nHow many today are like Peter! They are interested in the affairs\nof others, and anxious to know their duty, while they are in danger\nof neglecting their own. It is our work to look to Christ and follow\nHim. We shall see mistakes in the lives of others, and defects in\ntheir character. Humanity is encompassed with infirmity. But in\nChrist we shall find perfection. Beholding Him, we shall become\ntransformed.\nJohn lived to be very aged. He witnessed the destruction of\nJerusalem, and the ruin of the stately temple,\u2014a symbol of the final\nruin of the world. To his latest days John closely followed his Lord.\nThe burden of his testimony to the churches was, \u201cBeloved, let us\nlove one another;\u201d \u201che that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and\nGod in him.\u201d 1 John 4:7, 16.\nPeter had been restored to his apostleship, but the honor and[817]\nauthority he received from Christ had not given him supremacy over\nhis brethren. This Christ had made plain when in answer to Peter\u2019s\nquestion, \u201cWhat shall this man do?\u201d He had said, \u201cWhat is that\nto thee? follow thou Me.\u201d Peter was not honored as the head of\nthe church. The favor which Christ had shown him in forgiving his\napostasy, and entrusting him with the feeding of the flock, and Peter\u2019s\nown faithfulness in following Christ, won for him the confidence of\nhis brethren. He had much influence in the church. But the lesson\nwhich Christ had taught him by the Sea of Galilee Peter carried with\nhim throughout his life. Writing by the Holy Spirit to the churches,\nhe said:\n\u201cThe elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder,\nand a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the\nglory that shall be revealed: Feed the flock of God which is among\nyou, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly;\nnot for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over\nGod\u2019s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. And when the\nChief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that\nfadeth not away.\u201d 1 Peter 5:1-4.\nChapter 86\u2014Go Teach All Nations [818]\nThis chapter is based on Matthew 28:16-20.\nStanding but a step from His heavenly throne, Christ gave the\ncommission to His disciples. \u201cAll power is given unto Me in heaven\nand in earth,\u201d He said. \u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations.\u201d \u201cGo\nye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\u201d Mark\n16:15. Again and again the words were repeated, that the disciples\nmight grasp their significance. Upon all the inhabitants of the earth,\nhigh and low, rich and poor, was the light of heaven to shine in clear,\nstrong rays. The disciples were to be colaborers with their Redeemer\nin the work of saving the world.\nThe commission had been given to the twelve when Christ met\nwith them in the upper chamber; but it was now to be given to a larger\nnumber. At the meeting on a mountain in Galilee, all the believers\nwho could be called together were assembled. Of this meeting Christ\nHimself, before His death, had designated the time and place. The\nangel at the tomb reminded the disciples of His promise to meet\nthem in Galilee. The promise was repeated to the believers who\nwere gathered at Jerusalem during the Passover week, and through\nthem it reached many lonely ones who were mourning the death of\ntheir Lord. With intense interest all looked forward to the interview.\nThey made their way to the place of meeting by circuitous routes,\ncoming in from every direction, to avoid exciting the suspicion of the\njealous Jews. With wondering hearts they came, talking earnestly\ntogether of the news that had reached them concerning Christ.\nAt the time appointed, about five hundred believers were col-\nlected in little knots on the mountainside, eager to learn all that could\nbe learned from those who had seen Christ since His resurrection. [819]\nFrom group to group the disciples passed, telling all they had seen\nand heard of Jesus, and reasoning from the Scriptures as He had\ndone with them. Thomas recounted the story of his unbelief, and\ntold how his doubts had been swept away. Suddenly Jesus stood\n713\n714 The Desire of Ages\namong them. No one could tell whence or how He came. Many who\nwere present had never before seen Him; but in His hands and feet\nthey beheld the marks of the crucifixion; His countenance was as\nthe face of God, and when they saw Him, they worshiped Him.\nBut some doubted. So it will always be. There are those who find\nit hard to exercise faith, and they place themselves on the doubting\nside. These lose much because of their unbelief.\nThis was the only interview that Jesus had with many of the\nbelievers after His resurrection. He came and spoke to them saying,\n\u201cAll power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.\u201d The disciples\nhad worshiped Him before He spoke, but His words, falling from\nlips that had been closed in death, thrilled them with peculiar power.\nHe was now the risen Saviour. Many of them had seen Him exercise\nHis power in healing the sick and controlling satanic agencies. They\nbelieved that He possessed power to set up His kingdom at Jerusalem,\npower to quell all opposition, power over the elements of nature.\nHe had stilled the angry waters; He had walked upon the white-\ncrested billows; He had raised the dead to life. Now He declared\nthat \u201call power\u201d was given to Him. His words carried the minds of\nHis hearers above earthly and temporal things to the heavenly and\neternal. They were lifted to the highest conception of His dignity\nand glory.\nChrist\u2019s words on the mountainside were the announcement that\nHis sacrifice in behalf of man was full and complete. The conditions\nof the atonement had been fulfilled; the work for which He came\nto this world had been accomplished. He was on His way to the\nthrone of God, to be honored by angels, principalities, and powers.\nHe had entered upon His mediatorial work. Clothed with boundless\nauthority, He gave His commission to the disciples: \u201cGo ye therefore,\nand teach all nations,\u201d \u201cbaptizing them into the name of the Father\nand of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: teaching them to observe all\nthings whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always,\neven unto the end of the world.\u201d Matthew 28:19, 20, R. V .\nThe Jewish people had been made the depositaries of sacred\ntruth; but Pharisaism had made them the most exclusive, the most\nbigoted, of all the human race. Everything about the priests and[820]\nrulers\u2014their dress, customs, ceremonies, traditions\u2014made them\nunfit to be the light of the world. They looked upon themselves, the\nGo Teach All Nations 715\nJewish nation, as the world. But Christ commissioned His disciples\nto proclaim a faith and worship that would have in it nothing of caste\nor country, a faith that would be adapted to all peoples, all nations,\nall classes of men.\nBefore leaving His disciples, Christ plainly stated the nature\nof His kingdom. He called to their minds what He had previously\ntold them concerning it. He declared that it was not His purpose to\nestablish in this world a temporal, but a spiritual kingdom. He was\nnot to reign as an earthly king on David\u2019s throne. Again He opened\nto them the Scriptures, showing that all He had passed through\nhad been ordained in heaven, in the councils between the Father\nand Himself. All had been foretold by men inspired by the Holy\nSpirit. He said, You see that all I have revealed to you concerning\nMy rejection as the Messiah has come to pass. All I have said in\nregard to the humiliation I should endure and the death I should\ndie, has been verified. On the third day I rose again. Search the\nScriptures more diligently, and you will see that in all these things\nthe specifications of prophecy concerning Me have been fulfilled.\nChrist commissioned His disciples to do the work He had left in\ntheir hands, beginning at Jerusalem. Jerusalem had been the scene\nof His amazing condescension for the human race. There He had\nsuffered, been rejected and condemned. The land of Judea was His\nbirthplace. There, clad in the garb of humanity, He had walked with\nmen, and few had discerned how near heaven came to the earth when\nJesus was among them. At Jerusalem the work of the disciples must\nbegin.\nIn view of all that Christ had suffered there, and the unappreci-\nated labor He had put forth, the disciples might have pleaded for a\nmore promising field; but they made no such plea. The very ground\nwhere He had scattered the seed of truth was to be cultivated by\nthe disciples, and the seed would spring up and yield an abundant\nharvest. In their work the disciples would have to meet persecution\nthrough the jealousy and hatred of the Jews; but this had been en-\ndured by their Master, and they were not to flee from it. The first\noffers of mercy must be made to the murderers of the Saviour.\nAnd there were in Jerusalem many who had secretly believed on\nJesus, and many who had been deceived by the priests and rulers.\nTo these also the gospel was to be presented. They were to be\n716 The Desire of Ages\ncalled to repentance. The wonderful truth that through Christ alone[821]\ncould remission of sins be obtained was to be made plain. While all\nJerusalem was stirred by the thrilling events of the past few weeks,\nthe preaching of the gospel would make the deepest impression.\nBut the work was not to stop here. It was to be extended to the\nearth\u2019s remotest bounds. To His disciples Christ said, You have\nbeen witnesses of My life of self-sacrifice in behalf of the world.\nYou have witnessed My labors for Israel. Although they would not\ncome unto Me that they might have life, although priests and rulers\nhave done to Me as they listed, although they have rejected Me as\nthe Scriptures foretold, they shall have still another opportunity of\naccepting the Son of God. You have seen that all who come to Me,\nconfessing their sins, I freely receive. Him that cometh to Me I will\nin nowise cast out. All who will, may be reconciled to God, and\nreceive everlasting life. To you, My disciples, I commit this message\nof mercy. It is to be given to Israel first, and then to all nations,\ntongues, and peoples. It is to be given to Jews and Gentiles. All who\nbelieve are to be gathered into one church.\nThrough the gift of the Holy Spirit the disciples were to receive\na marvelous power. Their testimony was to be confirmed by signs\nand wonders. Miracles would be wrought, not only by the apostles,\nbut by those who received their message. Jesus said, \u201cIn My name\nshall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they\nshall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not\nhurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\u201d\nMark 16:17, 18.\nAt that time poisoning was often practiced. Unscrupulous men\ndid not hesitate to remove by this means those who stood in the way\nof their ambition. Jesus knew that the life of His disciples would\nthus be imperiled. Many would think it doing God service to put\nHis witnesses to death. He therefore promised them protection from\nthis danger.\nThe disciples were to have the same power which Jesus had to\nheal \u201call manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the\npeople.\u201d By healing in His name the diseases of the body, they would\ntestify to His power for the healing of the soul. Matthew 4:23; 9:6.\nAnd a new endowment was now promised. The disciples were to\npreach among other nations, and they would receive power to speak\nGo Teach All Nations 717\nother tongues. The apostles and their associates were unlettered men,\nyet through the outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, their\nspeech, whether in their own or a foreign language, became pure,\nsimple, and accurate, both in word and in accent.\nThus Christ gave His disciples their commission. He made full [822]\nprovision for the prosecution of the work, and took upon Himself\nthe responsibility for its success. So long as they obeyed His word,\nand worked in connection with Him, they could not fail. Go to\nall nations, He bade them. Go to the farthest part of the habitable\nglobe, but know that My presence will be there. Labor in faith and\nconfidence, for the time will never come when I will forsake you.\nThe Saviour\u2019s commission to the disciples included all the be-\nlievers. It includes all believers in Christ to the end of time. It is a\nfatal mistake to suppose that the work of saving souls depends alone\non the ordained minister. All to whom the heavenly inspiration has\ncome are put in trust with the gospel. All who receive the life of\nChrist are ordained to work for the salvation of their fellow men.\nFor this work the church was established, and all who take upon\nthemselves its sacred vows are thereby pledged to be co-workers\nwith Christ.\n\u201cThe Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth\nsay, Come.\u201d Revelation 22:17. Everyone who hears is to repeat the\ninvitation. Whatever one\u2019s calling in life, his first interest should be\nto win souls for Christ. He may not be able to speak to congregations,\nbut he can work for individuals. To them he can communicate the\ninstruction received from his Lord. Ministry does not consist alone in\npreaching. Those minister who relieve the sick and suffering, helping\nthe needy, speaking words of comfort to the desponding and those\nof little faith. Nigh and afar off are souls weighed down by a sense\nof guilt. It is not hardship, toil, or poverty that degrades humanity. It\nis guilt, wrongdoing. This brings unrest and dissatisfaction. Christ\nwould have His servants minister to sin-sick souls.\nThe disciples were to begin their work where they were. The\nhardest and most unpromising field was not to be passed by. So every\none of Christ\u2019s workers is to begin where he is. In our own families\nmay be souls hungry for sympathy, starving for the bread of life.\nThere may be children to be trained for Christ. There are heathen at\nour very doors. Let us do faithfully the work that is nearest. Then\n718 The Desire of Ages\nlet our efforts be extended as far as God\u2019s hand may lead the way.\nThe work of many may appear to be restricted by circumstances;\nbut, wherever it is, if performed with faith and diligence it will be\nfelt to the uttermost parts of the earth. Christ\u2019s work when upon\nearth appeared to be confined to a narrow field, but multitudes from\nall lands heard His message. God often uses the simplest means to\naccomplish the greatest results. It is His plan that every part of His[823]\nwork shall depend on every other part, as a wheel within a wheel, all\nacting in harmony. The humblest worker, moved by the Holy Spirit,\nwill touch invisible chords, whose vibrations will ring to the ends of\nthe earth, and make melody through eternal ages.\nBut the command, \u201cGo ye into all the world,\u201d is not to be lost\nsight of. We are called upon to lift our eyes to the \u201cregions beyond.\u201d\nChrist tears away the wall of partition, the dividing prejudice of\nnationality, and teaches a love for all the human family. He lifts\nmen from the narrow circle which their selfishness prescribes; He\nabolishes all territorial lines and artificial distinctions of society. He\nmakes no difference between neighbors and strangers, friends and\nenemies. He teaches us to look upon every needy soul as our brother,\nand the world as our field.\nWhen the Saviour said, \u201cGo, ... teach all nations,\u201d He said also,\n\u201cThese signs shall follow them that believe; In My name shall they\ncast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take\nup serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt\nthem; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\u201d The\npromise is as far-reaching as the commission. Not that all the gifts\nare imparted to each believer. The Spirit divides \u201cto every man\nseverally as He will.\u201d 1 Corinthians 12:11. But the gifts of the Spirit\nare promised to every believer according to his need for the Lord\u2019s\nwork. The promise is just as strong and trustworthy now as in the\ndays of the apostles. \u201cThese signs shall follow them that believe.\u201d\nThis is the privilege of God\u2019s children, and faith should lay hold on\nall that it is possible to have as an indorsement of faith.\n\u201cThey shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\u201d This\nworld is a vast lazar house, but Christ came to heal the sick, to\nproclaim deliverance to the captives of Satan. He was in Himself\nhealth and strength. He imparted His life to the sick, the afflicted,\nthose possessed of demons. He turned away none who came to\nGo Teach All Nations 719\nreceive His healing power. He knew that those who petitioned Him\nfor help had brought disease upon themselves; yet He did not refuse\nto heal them. And when virtue from Christ entered into these poor\nsouls, they were convicted of sin, and many were healed of their\nspiritual disease, as well as of their physical maladies. The gospel\nstill possesses the same power, and why should we not today witness\nthe same results?\nChrist feels the woes of every sufferer. When evil spirits rend a\nhuman frame, Christ feels the curse. When fever is burning up the\nlife current, He feels the agony. And He is just as willing to heal\nthe sick now as when He was personally on earth. Christ\u2019s servants\nare His representatives, the channels for His working. He desires [824]\nthrough them to exercise His healing power.\nIn the Saviour\u2019s manner of healing there were lessons for His\ndisciples. On one occasion He anointed the eyes of a blind man with\nclay, and bade him, \u201cGo, wash in the pool of Siloam.... He went his\nway therefore, and washed, and came seeing.\u201d John 9:7. The cure\ncould be wrought only by the power of the Great Healer, yet Christ\nmade use of the simple agencies of nature. While He did not give\ncountenance to drug medication, He sanctioned the use of simple\nand natural remedies.\nTo many of the afflicted ones who received healing, Christ said,\n\u201cSin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.\u201d John 5:14. Thus\nHe taught that disease is the result of violating God\u2019s laws, both\nnatural and spiritual. The great misery in the world would not exist\ndid men but live in harmony with the Creator\u2019s plan.\nChrist had been the guide and teacher of ancient Israel, and He\ntaught them that health is the reward of obedience to the laws of God.\nThe Great Physician who healed the sick in Palestine had spoken to\nHis people from the pillar of cloud, telling them what they must do,\nand what God would do for them. \u201cIf thou wilt diligently hearken to\nthe voice of the Lord thy God,\u201d He said, \u201cand wilt do that which is\nright in His sight, and wilt give ear to His commandments, and keep\nall His statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which\nI have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth\nthee.\u201d Exodus 15:26. Christ gave to Israel definite instruction in\nregard to their habits of life, and He assured them, \u201cThe Lord will\ntake away from thee all sickness.\u201d Deuteronomy 7:15. When they\n720 The Desire of Ages\nfulfilled the conditions, the promise was verified to them. \u201cThere\nwas not one feeble person among their tribes.\u201d Psalm 105:37.\nThese lessons are for us. There are conditions to be observed\nby all who would preserve health. All should learn what these\nconditions are. The Lord is not pleased with ignorance in regard to\nHis laws, either natural or spiritual. We are to be workers together\nwith God for the restoration of health to the body as well as to the\nsoul.\nAnd we should teach others how to preserve and to recover\nhealth. For the sick we should use the remedies which God has\nprovided in nature, and we should point them to Him who alone\ncan restore. It is our work to present the sick and suffering to Christ\nin the arms of our faith. We should teach them to believe in the\nGreat Healer. We should lay hold on His promise, and pray for\nthe manifestation of His power. The very essence of the gospel is\nrestoration, and the Saviour would have us bid the sick, the hopeless,[825]\nand the afflicted take hold upon His strength.\nThe power of love was in all Christ\u2019s healing, and only by partak-\ning of that love, through faith, can we be instruments for His work.\nIf we neglect to link ourselves in divine connection with Christ, the\ncurrent of life-giving energy cannot flow in rich streams from us to\nthe people. There were places where the Saviour Himself could not\ndo many mighty works because of their unbelief. So now unbelief\nseparates the church from her divine Helper. Her hold upon eternal\nrealities is weak. By her lack of faith, God is disappointed, and\nrobbed of His glory.\nIt is in doing Christ\u2019s work that the church has the promise of\nHis presence. Go teach all nations, He said; \u201cand, lo, I am with you\nalway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d To take His yoke is one of the\nfirst conditions of receiving His power. The very life of the church\ndepends upon her faithfulness in fulfilling the Lord\u2019s commission.\nTo neglect this work is surely to invite spiritual feebleness and decay.\nWhere there is no active labor for others, love wanes, and faith grows\ndim.\nChrist intends that His ministers shall be educators of the church\nin gospel work. They are to teach the people how to seek and save\nthe lost. But is this the work they are doing? Alas, how many are\ntoiling to fan the spark of life in a church that is ready to die! How\nGo Teach All Nations 721\nmany churches are tended like sick lambs by those who ought to be\nseeking for the lost sheep! And all the time millions upon millions\nwithout Christ are perishing.\nDivine love has been stirred to its unfathomable depths for the\nsake of men, and angels marvel to behold in the recipients of so\ngreat love a mere surface gratitude. Angels marvel at man\u2019s shallow\nappreciation of the love of God. Heaven stands indignant at the\nneglect shown to the souls of men. Would we know how Christ\nregards it? How would a father and mother feel, did they know that\ntheir child, lost in the cold and the snow, had been passed by, and\nleft to perish, by those who might have saved it? Would they not\nbe terribly grieved, wildly indignant? Would they not denounce\nthose murderers with wrath hot as their tears, intense as their love?\nThe sufferings of every man are the sufferings of God\u2019s child, and\nthose who reach out no helping hand to their perishing fellow beings\nprovoke His righteous anger. This is the wrath of the Lamb. To\nthose who claim fellowship with Christ, yet have been indifferent to\nthe needs of their fellow men, He will declare in the great Judgment\nday, \u201cI know you not whence ye are; depart from Me, all ye workers\nof iniquity.\u201d Luke 13:27.\nIn the commission to His disciples, Christ not only outlined their [826]\nwork, but gave them their message. Teach the people, He said, \u201cto\nobserve all things whatsoever I have commanded you.\u201d The disciples\nwere to teach what Christ had taught. That which He had spoken,\nnot only in person, but through all the prophets and teachers of the\nOld Testament, is here included. Human teaching is shut out. There\nis no place for tradition, for man\u2019s theories and conclusions, or for\nchurch legislation. No laws ordained by ecclesiastical authority are\nincluded in the commission. None of these are Christ\u2019s servants\nto teach. \u201cThe law and the prophets,\u201d with the record of His own\nwords and deeds, are the treasure committed to the disciples to be\ngiven to the world. Christ\u2019s name is their watchword, their badge\nof distinction, their bond of union, the authority for their course of\naction, and the source of their success. Nothing that does not bear\nHis superscription is to be recognized in His kingdom.\nThe gospel is to be presented, not as a lifeless theory, but as\na living force to change the life. God desires that the receivers of\nHis grace shall be witnesses to its power. Those whose course has\n722 The Desire of Ages\nbeen most offensive to Him He freely accepts; when they repent,\nHe imparts to them His divine Spirit, places them in the highest\npositions of trust, and sends them forth into the camp of the disloyal\nto proclaim His boundless mercy. He would have His servants\nbear testimony to the fact that through His grace men may possess\nChristlikeness of character, and may rejoice in the assurance of His\ngreat love. He would have us bear testimony to the fact that He\ncannot be satisfied until the human race are reclaimed and reinstated\nin their holy privileges as His sons and daughters.\nIn Christ is the tenderness of the shepherd, the affection of the\nparent, and the matchless grace of the compassionate Saviour. His\nblessings He presents in the most alluring terms. He is not content\nmerely to announce these blessings; He presents them in the most\nattractive way, to excite a desire to possess them. So His servants\nare to present the riches of the glory of the unspeakable Gift. The\nwonderful love of Christ will melt and subdue hearts, when the\nmere reiteration of doctrines would accomplish nothing. \u201cComfort\nye, comfort ye My people, saith your God.\u201d \u201cO Zion, that bringest\ngood tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that\nbringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be\nnot afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! ... He\nshall feed His flock like a shepherd: He shall gather the lambs with\nHis arm, and carry them in His bosom.\u201d Isaiah 40:1, 9-11. Tell[827]\nthe people of Him who is \u201cthe Chiefest among ten thousand,\u201d and\nthe One \u201caltogether lovely.\u201d The Song of Solomon 5:10, 16. Words\nalone cannot tell it. Let it be reflected in the character and manifested\nin the life. Christ is sitting for His portrait in every disciple. Every\none God has predestinated to be \u201cconformed to the image of His\nSon.\u201d Romans 8:29. In every one Christ\u2019s long-suffering love, His\nholiness, meekness, mercy, and truth are to be manifested to the\nworld.\nThe first disciples went forth preaching the word. They revealed\nChrist in their lives. And the Lord worked with them, \u201cconfirming the\nword with signs following.\u201d Mark 16:20. These disciples prepared\nthemselves for their work. Before the day of Pentecost they met\ntogether, and put away all differences. They were of one accord.\nThey believed Christ\u2019s promise that the blessing would be given, and\nthey prayed in faith. They did not ask for a blessing for themselves\nGo Teach All Nations 723\nmerely; they were weighted with the burden for the salvation of\nsouls. The gospel was to be carried to the uttermost parts of the\nearth, and they claimed the endowment of power that Christ had\npromised. Then it was that the Holy Spirit was poured out, and\nthousands were converted in a day.\nSo it may be now. Instead of man\u2019s speculations, let the word\nof God be preached. Let Christians put away their dissensions, and\ngive themselves to God for the saving of the lost. Let them in faith\nask for the blessing, and it will come. The outpouring of the Spirit\nin apostolic days was the \u201cformer rain,\u201d and glorious was the result.\nBut the \u201clatter rain\u201d will be more abundant. Joel 2:23.\nAll who consecrate soul, body, and spirit to God will be con-\nstantly receiving a new endowment of physical and mental power.\nThe inexhaustible supplies of heaven are at their command. Christ\ngives them the breath of His own spirit, the life of His own life. The\nHoly Spirit puts forth its highest energies to work in heart and mind.\nThe grace of God enlarges and multiplies their faculties, and every\nperfection of the divine nature comes to their assistance in the work\nof saving souls. Through co-operation with Christ they are complete\nin Him, and in their human weakness they are enabled to do the\ndeeds of Omnipotence.\nThe Saviour longs to manifest His grace and stamp His character\non the whole world. It is His purchased possession, and He desires\nto make men free, and pure, and holy. Though Satan works to hinder\nthis purpose, yet through the blood shed for the world there are\ntriumphs to be achieved that will bring glory to God and the Lamb.\nChrist will not be satisfied till the victory is complete, and \u201cHe shall\nsee of the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied.\u201d Isaiah 53:11. [828]\nAll the nations of the earth shall hear the gospel of His grace. Not\nall will receive His grace; but \u201ca seed shall serve Him; it shall be\naccounted to the Lord for a generation.\u201d Psalm 22:30. \u201cThe kingdom\nand dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole\nheaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High,\u201d\nand \u201cthe earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the\nwaters cover the sea.\u201d \u201cSo shall they fear the name of the Lord from\nthe west, and His glory from the rising of the sun.\u201d Daniel 7:27;\nIsaiah 11:9; 59:19.\n724 The Desire of Ages\n\u201cHow beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that\nbringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good\ntidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy\nGod reigneth! ... Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places:\n... for the Lord hath comforted His people.... The Lord hath made\nbare His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of\nthe earth shall see the salvation of our God.\u201d Isaiah 52:7-10.\nChapter 87\u2014\u201cTo My Father, and Your Father\u201d [829]\nThis chapter is based on Luke 24:50-53; Acts 1:9-12.\nThe time had come for Christ to ascend to His Father\u2019s throne.\nAs a divine conqueror He was about to return with the trophies of\nvictory to the heavenly courts. Before His death He had declared to\nHis Father, \u201cI have finished the work which Thou gavest Me to do.\u201d\nJohn 17:4. After His resurrection He tarried on earth for a season,\nthat His disciples might become familiar with Him in His risen and\nglorified body. Now He was ready for the leave-taking. He had\nauthenticated the fact that He was a living Saviour. His disciples\nneed no longer associate Him with the tomb. They could think of\nHim as glorified before the heavenly universe.\nAs the place of His ascension, Jesus chose the spot so often hal-\nlowed by His presence while He dwelt among men. Not Mount Zion,\nthe place of David\u2019s city, not Mount Moriah, the temple site, was to\nbe thus honored. There Christ had been mocked and rejected. There\nthe waves of mercy, still returning in a stronger tide of love, had\nbeen beaten back by hearts as hard as rock. Thence Jesus, weary and\nheart-burdened, had gone forth to find rest in the Mount of Olives.\nThe holy Shekinah, in departing from the first temple, had stood\nupon the eastern mountain, as if loath to forsake the chosen city; so\nChrist stood upon Olivet, with yearning heart overlooking Jerusalem.\nThe groves and glens of the mountain had been consecrated by His [830]\nprayers and tears. Its steeps had echoed the triumphant shouts of\nthe multitude that proclaimed Him king. On its sloping descent\nHe had found a home with Lazarus at Bethany. In the garden of\nGethsemane at its foot He had prayed and agonized alone. From\nthis mountain He was to ascend to heaven. Upon its summit His feet\nwill rest when He shall come again. Not as a man of sorrows, but\nas a glorious and triumphant king He will stand upon Olivet, while\nHebrew hallelujahs mingle with Gentile hosannas, and the voices of\n725\n726 The Desire of Ages\nthe redeemed as a mighty host shall swell the acclamation, Crown\nHim Lord of all!\nNow with the eleven disciples Jesus made His way toward the\nmountain. As they passed through the gate of Jerusalem, many\nwondering eyes looked upon the little company, led by One whom\na few weeks before the rulers had condemned and crucified. The\ndisciples knew not that this was to be their last interview with their\nMaster. Jesus spent the time in conversation with them, repeating\nHis former instruction. As they approached Gethsemane, He paused,\nthat they might call to mind the lessons He had given them on the\nnight of His great agony. Again He looked upon the vine by which\nHe had then represented the union of His church with Himself and\nHis Father; again He repeated the truths He had then unfolded.\nAll around Him were reminders of His unrequited love. Even the\ndisciples who were so dear to His heart, had, in the hour of His\nhumiliation, reproached and forsaken Him.\nChrist had sojourned in the world for thirty-three years; He had\nendured its scorn, insult, and mockery; He had been rejected and\ncrucified. Now, when about to ascend to His throne of glory,\u2014as\nHe reviews the ingratitude of the people He came to save,\u2014will\nHe not withdraw from them His sympathy and love? Will not His\naffections be centered upon that realm where He is appreciated, and\nwhere sinless angels wait to do His bidding? No; His promise to\nthose loved ones whom He leaves on earth is, \u201cI am with you alway,\neven unto the end of the world.\u201d Matthew 28:20.\nUpon reaching the Mount of Olives, Jesus led the way across\nthe summit, to the vicinity of Bethany. Here He paused, and the\ndisciples gathered about Him. Beams of light seemed to radiate\nfrom His countenance as He looked lovingly upon them. He up-\nbraided them not for their faults and failures; words of the deepest\ntenderness were the last that fell upon their ears from the lips of their\nLord. With hands outstretched in blessing, and as if in assurance of[831]\nHis protecting care, He slowly ascended from among them, drawn\nheavenward by a power stronger than any earthly attraction. As He\npassed upward, the awe-stricken disciples looked with straining eyes\nfor the last glimpse of their ascending Lord. A cloud of glory hid\nHim from their sight; and the words came back to them as the cloudy\nchariot of angels received Him, \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto\n\u201cTo My Father, and Your Father\u201d 727\nthe end of the world.\u201d At the same time there floated down to them\nthe sweetest and most joyous music from the angel choir.\nWhile the disciples were still gazing upward, voices addressed\nthem which sounded like richest music. They turned, and saw two\nangels in the form of men, who spoke to them, saying, \u201cYe men of\nGalilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which\nis taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye [832]\nhave seen Him go into heaven.\u201d\nThese angels were of the company that had been waiting in a\nshining cloud to escort Jesus to His heavenly home. The most exalted\nof the angel throng, they were the two who had come to the tomb at\nChrist\u2019s resurrection, and they had been with Him throughout His\nlife on earth. With eager desire all heaven had waited for the end\nof His tarrying in a world marred by the curse of sin. The time had\nnow come for the heavenly universe to receive their King. Did not\nthe two angels long to join the throng that welcomed Jesus? But\nin sympathy and love for those whom He had left, they waited to\ngive them comfort. \u201cAre they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to\nminister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?\u201d Hebrews 1:14.\nChrist had ascended to heaven in the form of humanity. The\ndisciples had beheld the cloud receive Him. The same Jesus who\nhad walked and talked and prayed with them; who had broken bread\nwith them; who had been with them in their boats on the lake; and\nwho had that very day toiled with them up the ascent of Olivet,\u2014the\nsame Jesus had now gone to share His Father\u2019s throne. And the\nangels had assured them that the very One whom they had seen go\nup into heaven, would come again even as He had ascended. He\nwill come \u201cwith clouds; and every eye shall see Him.\u201d \u201cThe Lord\nHimself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of\nthe Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ\nshall rise.\u201d \u201cThe Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy\nangels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory.\u201d\nRevelation 1:7; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; Matthew 25:31. Thus will\nbe fulfilled the Lord\u2019s own promise to His disciples: \u201cIf I go and\nprepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto\nMyself; that where I am, there ye may be also.\u201d John 14:3. Well\nmight the disciples rejoice in the hope of their Lord\u2019s return.\n728 The Desire of Ages\nWhen the disciples went back to Jerusalem, the people looked\nupon them with amazement. After the trial and crucifixion of Christ,\nit had been thought that they would appear downcast and ashamed.\nTheir enemies expected to see upon their faces an expression of\nsorrow and defeat. Instead of this there was only gladness and\ntriumph. Their faces were aglow with a happiness not born of earth.\nThey did not mourn over disappointed hopes, but were full of praise\nand thanksgiving to God. With rejoicing they told the wonderful\nstory of Christ\u2019s resurrection and His ascension to heaven, and their\ntestimony was received by many.\nThe disciples no longer had any distrust of the future. They knew[833]\nthat Jesus was in heaven, and that His sympathies were with them\nstill. They knew that they had a friend at the throne of God, and\nthey were eager to present their requests to the Father in the name of\nJesus. In solemn awe they bowed in prayer, repeating the assurance,\n\u201cWhatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it\nyou. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in My name: ask, and ye shall\nreceive, that your joy may be full.\u201d John 16:23, 24. They extended\nthe hand of faith higher and higher, with the mighty argument, \u201cIt\nis Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the\nright hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.\u201d Romans\n8:34. And Pentecost brought them fullness of joy in the presence of\nthe Comforter, even as Christ had promised.\nAll heaven was waiting to welcome the Saviour to the celestial\ncourts. As He ascended, He led the way, and the multitude of\ncaptives set free at His resurrection followed. The heavenly host,\nwith shouts and acclamations of praise and celestial song, attended\nthe joyous train.\nAs they drew near to the city of God, the challenge is given by\nthe escorting angels,\u2014\n\u201cLift up your heads, O ye gates;\nAnd be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors;\nAnd the King of glory shall come in.\u201d\nJoyfully the waiting sentinels respond,\u2014\n\u201cWho is this King of glory?\u201d\n\u201cTo My Father, and Your Father\u201d 729\nThis they say, not because they know not who He is, but because\nthey would hear the answer of exalted praise,\u2014\n\u201cThe Lord strong and mighty,\nThe Lord mighty in battle!\nLift up your heads, O ye gates;\nEven lift them up, ye everlasting doors;\nAnd the King of glory shall come in.\u201d\nAgain is heard the challenge, \u201cWho is this King of glory?\u201d for\nthe angels never weary of hearing His name exalted. The escorting\nangels make reply,\u2014\n\u201cThe Lord of hosts;\nHe is the King of glory.\u201d Psalm 24:7-10.\nThen the portals of the city of God are opened wide, and the\nangelic throng sweep through the gates amid a burst of rapturous\nmusic.\nThere is the throne, and around it the rainbow of promise. There [834]\nare cherubim and seraphim. The commanders of the angel hosts,\nthe sons of God, the representatives of the unfallen worlds, are\nassembled. The heavenly council before which Lucifer had accused\nGod and His Son, the representatives of those sinless realms over\nwhich Satan had thought to establish his dominion,\u2014all are there\nto welcome the Redeemer. They are eager to celebrate His triumph\nand to glorify their King.\nBut He waves them back. Not yet; He cannot now receive the\ncoronet of glory and the royal robe. He enters into the presence of\nHis Father. He points to His wounded head, the pierced side, the\nmarred feet; He lifts His hands, bearing the print of nails. He points\nto the tokens of His triumph; He presents to God the wave sheaf,\nthose raised with Him as representatives of that great multitude\nwho shall come forth from the grave at His second coming. He\napproaches the Father, with whom there is joy over one sinner that\nrepents; who rejoices over one with singing. Before the foundations\nof the earth were laid, the Father and the Son had united in a covenant\nto redeem man if he should be overcome by Satan. They had clasped\n730 The Desire of Ages\nTheir hands in a solemn pledge that Christ should become the surety\nfor the human race. This pledge Christ has fulfilled. When upon the\ncross He cried out, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d He addressed the Father. The\ncompact had been fully carried out. Now He declares: Father, it is\nfinished. I have done Thy will, O My God. I have completed the\nwork of redemption. If Thy justice is satisfied, \u201cI will that they also,\nwhom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am.\u201d John 19:30;\n17:24.\nThe voice of God is heard proclaiming that justice is satisfied.\nSatan is vanquished. Christ\u2019s toiling, struggling ones on earth are\n\u201caccepted in the Beloved.\u201d Ephesians 1:6. Before the heavenly\nangels and the representatives of unfallen worlds, they are declared\njustified. Where He is, there His church shall be. \u201cMercy and truth\nare met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.\u201d\nPsalm 85:10. The Father\u2019s arms encircle His Son, and the word is\ngiven, \u201cLet all the angels of God worship Him.\u201d Hebrews 1:6.\nWith joy unutterable, rulers and principalities and powers ac-\nknowledge the supremacy of the Prince of life. The angel host\nprostrate themselves before Him, while the glad shout fills all the\ncourts of heaven, \u201cWorthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive\npower, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory,\nand blessing.\u201d Revelation 5:12.\nSongs of triumph mingle with the music from angel harps, till[835]\nheaven seems to overflow with joy and praise. Love has conquered.\nThe lost is found. Heaven rings with voices in lofty strains pro-\nclaiming, \u201cBlessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him\nthat sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.\u201d\nRevelation 5:13.\n* * * * *\nFrom that scene of heavenly joy, there comes back to us on earth\nthe echo of Christ\u2019s own wonderful words, \u201cI ascend unto My Father,\nand your Father; and to My God, and your God.\u201d John 20:17. The\nfamily of heaven and the family of earth are one. For us our Lord\nascended, and for us He lives. \u201cWherefore He is able also to save\nthem to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever\nliveth to make intercession for them.\u201d Hebrews 7:25.",
