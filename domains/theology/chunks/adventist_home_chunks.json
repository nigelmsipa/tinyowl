White has written much and very valuable counsel\nfor parents. She has touched upon every phase of the home, and\noffers specific instruction on many of the problems which give so\nmuch concern to thoughtful and often anxious parents today. Some\nyears before her death, she indicated her desire to get out \u201ca book\nfor Christian parents\u201d that would define \u201cthe mother\u2019s duty and\ninfluence over her children.\u201d In the present work an endeavor has\nbeen made to fulfill this expectation.\nThis book, The Adventist Home, is at once a sort of handbook or\nmanual for busy parents, and a pattern or ideal of what the home can\nand should become. Here are the answers to your many questions,\nthe words of wisdom from the heavenly Father.\nIn compiling this work, excerpts have been drawn from the Ellen\nG. White writings penned through seven decades, but especially\nfrom the thousands of E. G. White articles which were prepared\nfor the journals of the denomination. The current published works,\nspecial testimonies issued in pamphlet form, and the E. G. White\nmanuscript files have also enriched the V olume. Appropriate source\ncredits are given in connection with each chapter. As the excerpts\ndrawn from different sources written at different times are linked [6]\ntogether in their logical sequence, there may be occasionally a slight\nunavoidable break in thought or manner of address, for the compilers\nare limited in their work to selecting and arranging the subject matter\nand supplying the headings.\nThis document has been prepared in the office of the Ellen G.\nWhite Publications. The work has been done in harmony with Mrs.\niii\nWhite\u2019s instruction to her trustees in providing \u201cfor the printing\nof compilations\u201d from her manuscripts, for they contain, she said,\n\u201cinstruction that the Lord has given me for his people.\u201d\nNever in the history of the world has a book like this been needed\nmore urgently than it is right now. Never have parents and children\nbeen more anxious for the right answer to the things which trouble\nthem. Never have homes been in such jeopardy as they are today.\nEvery one of us knows that conditions in society are but a re-\nflection of conditions in the homes of the nation. We likewise know\nthat a change in the home will be mirrored in a changed society.\nTo this end this V olume\u2014The Adventist Home\u2014has been prepared\nand, as a part of the Christian home library, is now sent forth on its\nimportant mission by the publishers and\nThe Trustees of the\nEllen G. White Publications\nWashington, D.C.,\nMay 8, 1952.\nContents\nInformation about this Book . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i\nForeword . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

1\u2014Atmosphere of the Home\nHome Is the Heart of All Activity \u2014Society is composed of\nfamilies, and is what the heads of families make it. Out of the heart\nare \u201cthe issues of life\u201d; and the heart of the community, of the church,\nand of the nation is the household. The well-being of society, the\nsuccess of the church, the prosperity of the nation, depend upon\nhome influences.1\nThe elevation or deterioration of the future of society will be de-\ntermined by the manners and morals of the youth growing up around\nus. As the youth are educated, and as their characters are molded in\ntheir childhood to virtuous habits, self-control, and temperance, so\nwill their influence be upon society. If they are left unenlightened\nand uncontrolled, and as the result become self-willed, intemperate\nin appetite and passion, so will be their future influence in molding\nsociety. The company which the young now keep, the habits they\nnow form, and the principles they now adopt are the index to the\nstate of society for years to come.2\nThe Sweetest Type of Heaven\u2014Home should be made all that\nthe word implies. It should be a little heaven upon earth, a place\nwhere the affections are cultivated instead of being studiously re-\npressed. Our happiness depends upon this cultivation of love, sym-\npathy, and true courtesy to one another.3\nThe sweetest type of heaven is a home where the Spirit of the\nLord presides. If the will of God is fulfilled, the husband and wife\nwill respect each other and cultivate love and confidence.4\nImportance of the Home Atmosphere\u2014The atmosphere sur-[16]\nrounding the souls of fathers and mothers fills the whole house, and\nis felt in every department of the home.5\nTo a large extent parents create the atmosphere of the home\ncircle, and when there is disagreement between father and mother,\nthe children partake of the same spirit. Make your home atmosphere\nfragrant with tender thoughtfulness. If you have become estranged\nand have failed to be Bible Christians, be converted; for the character\n10\nAtmosphere of the Home 11\nyou bear in probationary time will be the character you will have at\nthe coming of Christ. If you would be a saint in heaven, you must\nfirst be a saint on earth. The traits of character you cherish in life\nwill not be changed by death or by the resurrection. You will come\nup from the grave with the same disposition you manifested in your\nhome and in society. Jesus does not change the character at His\ncoming. The work of transformation must be done now. Our daily\nlives are determining our destiny.6\nCreating a Pure Atmosphere\u2014Every Christian home should\nhave rules; and parents should, in their words and deportment toward\neach other, give to the children a precious, living example of what\nthey desire them to be. Purity in speech and true Christian courtesy\nshould be constantly practiced. Teach the children and youth to\nrespect themselves, to be true to God, true to principle; teach them to\nrespect and obey the law of God. These principles will control their\nlives and will be carried out in their associations with others. They\nwill create a pure atmosphere\u2014one that will have an influence that\nwill encourage weak souls in the upward path that leads to holiness\nand heaven. Let every lesson be of an elevating and ennobling [17]\ncharacter, and the records made in the books of heaven will be such\nas you will not be ashamed to meet in the judgment.\nChildren who receive this kind of instruction will ... be prepared\nto fill places of responsibility and, by precept and example, will be\nconstantly aiding others to do right. Those whose moral sensibilities\nhave not been blunted will appreciate right principles; they will put\na just estimate upon their natural endowments and will make the\nbest use of their physical, mental, and moral powers. Such souls are\nstrongly fortified against temptation; they are surrounded by a wall\nnot easily broken down.7\nGod would have our families symbols of the family in heaven.\nLet parents and children bear this in mind every day, relating them-\nselves to one another as members of the family of God. Then their\nlives will be of such a character as to give to the world an object\nlesson of what families who love God and keep His commandments\nmay be. Christ will be glorified; His peace and grace and love will\npervade the family circle like a precious perfume.8\nMuch depends on the father and mother. They are to be firm\nand kind in their discipline, and they are to work most earnestly to\n12 The Adventist Home\nhave an orderly, correct household, that the heavenly angels may be\nattracted to it to impart peace and a fragrant influence.9\nMake Home Bright and Happy\u2014Never forget that you are to\nmake the home bright and happy for yourselves and your children\nby cherishing the Saviour\u2019s attributes. If you bring Christ into the\nhome, you will know good from evil. You will be able to help your\nchildren to be trees of righteousness, bearing the fruit of the Spirit.10\nTroubles may invade, but these are the lot of humanity. Let[18]\npatience, gratitude, and love keep sunshine in the heart though the\nday may be ever so cloudy.11\nThe home may be plain, but it can always be a place where\ncheerful words are spoken and kindly deeds are done, where courtesy\nand love are abiding guests.12\nAdminister the rules of the home in wisdom and love, not with\na rod of iron. Children will respond with willing obedience to the\nrule of love. Commend your children whenever you can. Make their\nlives as happy as possible.... Keep the soil of the heart mellow by\nthe manifestation of love and affection, thus preparing it for the seed\nof truth. Remember that the Lord gives the earth not only clouds\nand rain, but the beautiful, smiling sunshine, causing the seed to ger-\nminate and the blossom to appear. Remember that children need not\nonly reproof and correction, but encouragement and commendation,\nthe pleasant sunshine of kind words.13\nYou must not have strife in your household. \u201cBut the wisdom\nthat is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to\nbe intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and\nwithout hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace\nof them that make peace.\u201d It is gentleness and peace that we want in\nour homes.14\nTender Ties That Bind\u2014The family tie is the closest, the most\ntender and sacred, of any on earth. It was designed to be a blessing to\nmankind. And it is a blessing wherever the marriage covenant is en-\ntered into intelligently, in the fear of God, and with due consideration\nfor its responsibilities.15\nEvery home should be a place of love, a place where the angels\nof God abide, working with softening, subduing influence upon the[19]\nhearts of parents and children.16\nAtmosphere of the Home 13\nOur homes must be made a Bethel, our hearts a shrine. Wherever\nthe love of God is cherished in the soul, there will be peace, there will\nbe light and joy. Spread out the word of God before your families in\nlove, and ask, \u201cWhat hath God spoken?\u201d17\nChrist\u2019s Presence Makes a Home Christian\u2014The home that\nis beautified by love, sympathy, and tenderness is a place that angels\nlove to visit, and where God is glorified. The influence of a carefully\nguarded Christian home in the years of childhood and youth is\nthe surest safeguard against the corruptions of the world. In the\natmosphere of such a home the children will learn to love both their\nearthly parents and their heavenly Father.18\nFrom their infancy the youth need to have a firm barrier built up\nbetween them and the world, that its corrupting influence may not\naffect them.19\nEvery Christian family should illustrate to the world the power\nand excellence of Christian influence.... Parents should realize their\naccountability to keep their homes free from every taint of moral\nevil.20\nHoliness to God is to pervade the home.... Parents and children\nare to educate themselves to co-operate with God. They are to bring\ntheir habits and practices into harmony with God\u2019s plans.21\nThe family relationship should be sanctifying in its influence.\nChristian homes, established and conducted in accordance with\nGod\u2019s plan, are a wonderful help in forming Christian character....\nParents and children should unite in offering loving service to Him\nwho alone can keep human love pure and noble.22\nThe first work to be done in a Christian home is to see that the [20]\nSpirit of Christ abides there, that every member of the household\nmay be able to take his cross and follow where Jesus leads the way.23\n1The Ministry of Healing, 349.\n2Pacific Health Journal, June, 1890.\n3Testimonies for the Church 3:539.\n4The Signs of the Times, June 20, 1911.\n5Manuscript 49, 1898.\n6Letter 18b, 1891.\n7Special Selections from the Testimonies for Students and Workers of our Sanitariums\n(1911) 4, 5.\n8The Review and Herald, November 17, 1896.\n14 The Adventist Home\n9Manuscript 14, 1905.\n10Letter 29, 1902.\n11The Ministry of Healing, 393.\n12The Review and Herald, July 9, 1901.\n13Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 114.\n14Manuscript 9, 1893.\n15The Ministry of Healing, 356, 357.\n16Letter 25, 1904.\n17Letter 24a, 1896.\n18Manuscript 126, 1903.\n19Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 119.\n20The Review and Herald, October 9, 1900.\n21Letter 9, 1904.\n22Manuscript 16, 1899.\n23Manuscript 17, 1891.\nChapter 2\u2014Fundamentals of True Homemaking [21]\nThe Most Attractive Place in the World \u2014While there are\nweighty responsibilities devolving upon the parents to guard care-\nfully the future happiness and interests of their children, it is also\ntheir duty to make home as attractive as possible. This is of far\ngreater consequence than to acquire estates and money. Home must\nnot lack sunshine. The home feeling should be kept alive in the\nhearts of the children, that they may look back upon the home of\ntheir childhood as a place of peace and happiness next to heaven.\nThen as they come to maturity, they should in their turn try to be a\ncomfort and blessing to their parents.1\nThe home should be to the children the most attractive place in\nthe world, and the mother\u2019s presence should be its greatest attraction.\nChildren have sensitive, loving natures. They are easily pleased, and\neasily made unhappy. By gentle discipline, in loving words and acts,\nmothers may bind their children to their hearts.2\nClean, Neat, Orderly \u2014Cleanliness, neatness, and order are\nindispensable to the proper management of the household. But when\nthe mother makes these the all-important duties of her life, and\ndevotes herself to them, to the neglect of the physical development\nand the mental and moral training of her children, she makes a sad\nmistake.3\nBelievers should be taught that even though they may be poor,\nthey need not be unclean or untidy in their persons or in their homes. [22]\nHelp must be given in this line to those who seem to have no sense\nof the meaning and importance of cleanliness. They are to be taught\nthat those who are to represent the high and holy God must keep\ntheir souls pure and clean, and that this purity must extend to their\ndress and to everything in the home, so that the ministering angels\nwill have evidence that the truth has wrought a change in the life,\npurifying the soul and refining the tastes. Those who, after receiv-\ning the truth, make no change in word or deportment, in dress or\n15\n16 The Adventist Home\nsurroundings, are living to themselves, not to Christ. They have not\nbeen created anew in Christ Jesus, unto purification and holiness....\nWhile we are to guard against needless adornment and display,\nwe are in no case to be careless and indifferent in regard to outward\nappearance. All about our persons and our homes is to be neat and\nattractive. The youth are to be taught the importance of presenting\nan appearance above criticism, an appearance that honors God and\nthe truth.4\nA neglect of cleanliness will induce disease. Sickness does not\ncome without a cause. Violent epidemics of fevers have occurred in\nvillages and cities that were considered perfectly healthful, and these\nhave resulted in death or broken constitutions. In many instances\nthe premises of the very ones who fell victims to these epidemics\ncontained the agents of destruction which sent forth deadly poison\ninto the atmosphere, to be inhaled by the family and the neighbor-\nhood. It is astonishing to witness the prevailing ignorance relative to\nthe effects which slackness and recklessness produce upon health.5\nOrder Necessary for a Happy Home\u2014God is displeased with\ndisorder, slackness, and a lack of thoroughness in anyone. These[23]\ndeficiencies are serious evils, and tend to wean the affections of\nthe husband from the wife when the husband loves order, well-\ndisciplined children, and a well-regulated house. A wife and mother\ncannot make home agreeable and happy unless she possesses a\nlove for order, preserves her dignity, and has good government;\ntherefore all who fail on these points should begin at once to educate\nthemselves in this direction, and cultivate the very things wherein is\ntheir greatest lack.6\nVigilance and Diligence to Be Blended \u2014When we give our-\nselves unreservedly to the Lord, the simple, commonplace duties of\nhome life will be seen in their true importance, and we shall perform\nthem in accordance with the will of God. We are to be vigilant,\nwatching for the coming of the Son of man; and we must also be\ndiligent; working as well as waiting is required; there must be a\nunion of the two. This will balance the Christian character, making\nit well developed, symmetrical. We should not feel that we are to\nneglect everything else, and give ourselves up to meditation, study,\nor prayer; neither are we to be full of bustle and hurry and work, to\nthe neglect of personal piety. Waiting and watching and working are\nFundamentals of True Homemaking 17\nto be blended. \u201cNot slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving\nthe Lord.\u201d7\nProvide Laborsaving Facilities\u2014In many a home the wife and\nmother has no time to read, to keep herself well informed, no time\nto be a companion to her husband, no time to keep in touch with\nthe developing minds of her children. There is no time or place for\nthe precious Saviour to be a close, dear companion. Little by little\nshe sinks into a mere household drudge, her strength and time and\ninterest absorbed in the things that perish with the using. Too late\nshe awakes to find herself almost a stranger in her own home. The [24]\nprecious opportunities once hers to influence her dear ones for the\nhigher life, unimproved, have passed away forever.\nLet the homemakers resolve to live on a wiser plan. Let it be\nyour first aim to make a pleasant home. Be sure to provide the\nfacilities that will lighten labor and promote health.8\nEven the Humblest Tasks Are the Work of God \u2014All the\nwork we do that is necessary to be done, be it washing dishes,\nsetting tables, waiting upon the sick, cooking, or washing, is of\nmoral importance.... The humble tasks before us are to be taken up\nby someone; and those who do them should feel that they are doing\na necessary and honorable work, and that in their mission, humble\nthough it may be, they are doing the work of God just as surely as\nwas Gabriel when sent to the prophets. All are working in their order\nin their respective spheres. Woman in her home, doing the simple\nduties of life that must be done, can and should exhibit faithfulness,\nobedience, and love, as sincere as angels in their sphere. Conformity\nto the will of God makes any work honorable that must be done.9\n1The Review and Herald, February 2, 1886.\n2The Ministry of Healing, 388.\n3The Signs of the Times, August 5, 1875.\n4The Review and Herald, June 10, 1902.\n5Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 105, 106.\n6Testimonies for the Church 2:298, 299.\n7The Review and Herald, September 15, 1891.\n8The Ministry of Healing, 368, 369.\n9Testimonies for the Church 3:79, 80.\nChapter 3\u2014The Eden Home a Pattern[25]\nGod Prepared Man\u2019s First Home \u2014The Eden home of our\nfirst parents was prepared for them by God Himself. When He had\nfurnished it with everything that man could desire, He said: \u201cLet Us\nmake man in Our image, after Our likeness.\u201d ...\nThe Lord was pleased with this last and noblest of all His crea-\ntures, and designed that he should be the perfect inhabitant of a\nperfect world. But it was not His purpose that man should live in\nsolitude. He said: \u201cIt is not good that the man should be alone; I\nwill make him an help meet for him.\u201d1\nGod Himself gave Adam a companion. He provided \u201can help\nmeet for him\u201d\u2014a helper corresponding to him\u2014one who was fitted\nto be his companion, and who could be one with him in love and\nsympathy. Eve was created from a rib taken from the side of Adam,\nsignifying that she was not to control him as the head, nor to be\ntrampled under his feet as an inferior, but to stand by his side as an\nequal, to be loved and protected by him. A part of man, bone of his\nbone, and flesh of his flesh, she was his second self; showing the\nclose union and the affectionate attachment that should exist in this\nrelation. \u201cFor no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth\nand cherisheth it.\u201d \u201cTherefore shall a man leave his father and his\nmother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one.\u201d2\nFirst Marriage Performed by God\u2014God celebrated the first\nmarriage. Thus the institution has for its originator the Creator of[26]\nthe universe. \u201cMarriage is honourable\u201d; it was one of the first gifts\nof God to man, and it is one of the two institutions that, after the\nfall, Adam brought with him beyond the gates of Paradise. When\nthe divine principles are recognized and obeyed in this relation,\nmarriage is a blessing; it guards the purity and happiness of the\nrace, it provides for man\u2019s social needs, it elevates the physical, the\nintellectual, and the moral nature.3\nHe who gave Eve to Adam as a helpmeet performed His first\nmiracle at a marriage festival. In the festal hall where friends and\n18\nEden Home a Pattern 19\nkindred rejoiced together, Christ began His public ministry. Thus He\nsanctioned marriage, recognizing it as an institution that He Himself\nhad established....\nChrist honored the marriage relation by making it also a symbol\nof the union between Him and His redeemed ones. He Himself is\nthe Bridegroom; the bride is the church, of which, as His chosen\none, He says, \u201cThou art all fair, My love; there is no spot in thee.\u201d4\nEvery Want Was Supplied\u2014Adam was surrounded with ev-\nerything his heart could wish. Every want was supplied. There were\nno sin and no signs of decay in glorious Eden. Angels of God con-\nversed freely and lovingly with the holy pair. The happy songsters\ncaroled forth their free, joyous songs of praise to their Creator. The\npeaceful beasts in happy innocence played about Adam and Eve,\nobedient to their word. Adam was in the perfection of manhood, the\nnoblest of the Creator\u2019s work.5\nNot a shadow interposed between them and their Creator. They\nknew God as their beneficent Father, and in all things their will was\nconformed to the will of God. And God\u2019s character was reflected [27]\nin the character of Adam. His glory was revealed in every object of\nnature.6\nLabor Was Appointed for Man\u2019s Happiness\u2014God is a lover\nof the beautiful. He has given us unmistakable evidence of this in the\nwork of His hands. He planted for our first parents a beautiful garden\nin Eden. Stately trees were caused to grow out of the ground, of every\ndescription, for usefulness and ornament. The beautiful flowers were\nformed, of rare loveliness, of every tint and hue, perfuming the air....\nIt was the design of God that man should find happiness in the\nemployment of tending the things He had created, and that his wants\nshould be met with the fruits of the trees of the garden7\nTo Adam was given the work of caring for the garden. The\nCreator knew that Adam could not be happy without employment.\nThe beauty of the garden delighted him, but this was not enough.\nHe must have labor to call into exercise the wonderful organs of\nthe body. Had happiness consisted in doing nothing, man, in his\nstate of holy innocence, would have been left unemployed. But He\nwho created man knew what would be for his happiness; and no\nsooner had He created him than He gave him his appointed work.\n20 The Adventist Home\nThe promise of future glory, and the decree that man must toil for\nhis daily bread, came from the same throne.8\nGod Is Honored by a Christian Home\u2014Fathers and mothers\nwho make God first in their households, who teach their children that\nthe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, glorify God before\nangels and before men by presenting to the world a well-ordered,\nwell-disciplined family\u2014a family that love and obey God instead of\nrebelling against Him. Christ is not a stranger in their homes; His[28]\nname is a household name, revered and glorified. Angels delight\nin a home where God reigns supreme and the children are taught\nto reverence religion, the Bible, and their Creator. Such families\ncan claim the promise, \u201cThem that honour Me I will honour.\u201d As\nfrom such a home the father goes forth to his daily duties, it is with\na spirit softened and subdued by converse with God.9\nThe presence of Christ alone can make men and women happy.\nAll the common waters of life Christ can turn into the wine of heaven.\nThe home then becomes as an Eden of bliss; the family, a beautiful\nsymbol of the family in heaven.10\n1The Youth\u2019s Instructor, August 10, 1899.\n2Patriarchs and Prophets, 46.\n3Ibid., 46.\n4The Ministry of Healing, 356.\n5The Signs of the Times, June 11, 1874.\n6The Youth\u2019s Instructor, June 2, 1898.\n7The Health Reformer, July, 1871.\n8The Youth\u2019s Instructor, February 27, 1902.\n9Testimonies for the Church 5:424.\n10Manuscript 43, 1900.\nSection 2\u2014A Light in the Community [29]\nChapter 4\u2014Far-Reaching Influence of the Home[30]\n[31]\nThe Christian Home Is an Object Lesson\u2014The mission of the\nhome extends beyond its own members. The Christian home is to be\nan object lesson, illustrating the excellence of the true principles of\nlife. Such an illustration will be a power for good in the world.... As\nthe youth go out from such a home, the lessons they have learned\nare imparted. Nobler principles of life are introduced into other\nhouseholds, and an uplifting influence works in the community.1\nThe home in which the members are polite, courteous Christians\nexerts a far-reaching influence for good. Other families will mark\nthe results attained by such a home, and will follow the example\nset, in their turn guarding the home against Satanic influences. The\nangels of God will often visit the home in which the will of God\nbears sway. Under the power of divine grace such a home becomes a\nplace of refreshing to worn, weary pilgrims. By watchful guarding,\nself is kept from asserting itself. Correct habits are formed. There\nis a careful recognition of the rights of others. The faith that works\nby love and purifies the soul stands at the helm, presiding over the\nwhole household. Under the hallowed influence of such a home,\nthe principle of brotherhood laid down in the word of God is more\nwidely recognized and obeyed.2\nInfluence of a Well-ordered Family\u2014It is no small matter for\na family to stand as representatives of Jesus, keeping God\u2019s law in an\nunbelieving community. We are required to be living epistles known[32]\nand read of all men. This position involves fearful responsibilities.3\nOne well-ordered, well-disciplined family tells more in behalf of\nChristianity than all the sermons that can be preached. Such a family\ngives evidence that the parents have been successful in following\nGod\u2019s directions, and that their children will serve Him in the church.\nTheir influence grows; for as they impart, they receive to impart\nagain. The father and mother find helpers in their children, who give\nto others the instruction received in the home. The neighborhood in\nwhich they live is helped, for in it they have become enriched for\n22\nFar-Reaching Influence of the Home 23\ntime and for eternity. The whole family is engaged in the service\nof the Master; and by their godly example, others are inspired to\nbe faithful and true to God in dealing with His flock, His beautiful\nflock.4\nThe greatest evidence of the power of Christianity that can be\npresented to the world is a well-ordered, well-disciplined family.\nThis will recommend the truth as nothing else can, for it is a living\nwitness of its practical power upon the heart.5\nThe best test of the Christianity of a home is the type of character\nbegotten by its influence. Actions speak louder than the most positive\nprofession of godliness.6\nOur business in this world ... is to see what virtues we can\nteach our children and our families to possess, that they shall have\nan influence upon other families, and thus we can be an educating\npower although we never enter into the desk. A well-ordered, a\nwell-disciplined family in the sight of God is more precious than\nfine gold, even than the golden wedge of Ophir.7\nWonderful Possibilities Are Ours\u2014Our time here is short. We\ncan pass through this world but once; as we pass along, let us make [33]\nthe most of life. The work to which we are called does not require\nwealth or social position or great ability. It requires a kindly, self-\nsacrificing spirit and a steadfast purpose. A lamp, however small,\nif kept steadily burning, may be the means of lighting many other\nlamps. Our sphere of influence may seem narrow, our ability small,\nour opportunities few, our acquirements limited; yet wonderful pos-\nsibilities are ours through a faithful use of the opportunities of our\nown homes. If we will open our hearts and homes to the divine prin-\nciples of life, we shall become channels for currents of life-giving\npower. From our homes will flow streams of healing, bringing life,\nand beauty, and fruitfulness where now are barrenness and dearth.8\nGod-fearing parents will diffuse an influence from their own\nhome circle to that of others that will act as did the leaven that was\nhid in three measures of meal.9\nFaithful work done in the home educates others to do the same\nclass of work. The spirit of fidelity to God is like leaven and, when\nmanifested in the church, will have an effect upon others, and will be\na recommendation to Christianity everywhere. The work of whole-\nsouled soldiers of Christ is as far-reaching as eternity. Then why is\n24 The Adventist Home\nit that there is such a lack of the missionary spirit in our churches?\nIt is because there is a neglect of home piety.10\nInfluence of an Ill-regulated Family\u2014The influence of an ill-\nregulated family is widespread, and disastrous to all society. It\naccumulates in a tide of evil that affects families, communities, and\ngovernments.11\nIt is impossible for any of us to live in such a way that we\nshall not cast an influence in the world. No member of the family\ncan enclose himself within himself, where other members of the\nfamily shall not feel his influence and spirit. The very expression[34]\nof the countenance has an influence for good or evil. His spirit, his\nwords, his actions, his attitude toward others, are unmistakable. If\nhe is living in selfishness, he surrounds his soul with a malarious\natmosphere; while if he is filled with the love of Christ, he will\nmanifest courtesy, kindness, tender regard for the feelings of others\nand will communicate to his associates, by his acts of love, a tender,\ngrateful, happy feeling. It will be made manifest that he is living for\nJesus and daily learning lessons at His feet, receiving His light and\nHis peace. He will be able to say to the Lord, \u201cThy gentleness hath\nmade me great.\u201d12\n1The Ministry of Healing, 352.\n2Letter 272, 1903.\n3Testimonies for the Church 4:106.\n4The Review and Herald, June 6, 1899.\n5Testimonies for the Church 4:304.\n6Patriarchs and Prophets, 579.\n7Manuscript 12, 1895.\n8The Ministry of Healing, 355.\n9The Signs of the Times, September 17, 1894.\n10The Review and Herald, February 19, 1895.\n11Patriarchs and Prophets, 579.\n12The Youth\u2019s Instructor, June 22, 1893.\nChapter 5\u2014A Powerful Christian Witness [35]\nBest Missionaries Come From Christian Homes\u2014Missionar-\nies for the Master are best prepared for work abroad in the Christian\nhousehold, where God is feared, where God is loved, where God is\nworshiped, where faithfulness has become second nature, where hap-\nhazard, careless inattention to home duties is not permitted, where\nquiet communion with God is looked upon as essential to the faithful\nperformance of daily duties.1\nHome duties should be performed with the consciousness that\nif they are done in the right spirit, they give an experience that will\nenable us to work for Christ in the most permanent and thorough\nmanner. Oh, what might not a living Christian do in missionary\nlines by performing faithfully the daily duties, cheerfully lifting the\ncross, not neglecting any work, however disagreeable to the natural\nfeelings!2\nOur work for Christ is to begin with the family, in the home....\nThere is no missionary field more important than this....\nBy many this home field has been shamefully neglected, and it\nis time that divine resources and remedies were presented, that this\nstate of evil may be corrected.3\nThe highest duty that devolves upon youth is in their own homes,\nblessing father and mother, brothers and sisters, by affection and\ntrue interest. Here they can show self-denial and self-forgetfulness\nin caring and doing for others.... What an influence a sister may\nhave over brothers! If she is right, she may determine the character\nof her brothers. Her prayers, her gentleness, and her affection may\ndo much in a household.3\nIn the home those who have received Christ are to show what [36]\ngrace has done for them. \u201cAs many as received Him, to them gave\nHe power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe\non His name.\u201d A conscious authority pervades the true believer in\nChrist, that makes its influence felt throughout the home. This is\nfavorable for the perfection of the characters of all in the home.5\n25\n26 The Adventist Home\nAn Argument That the Infidel Cannot Gainsay\u2014A well-or-\ndered Christian household is a powerful argument in favor of the\nreality of the Christian religion\u2014an argument that the infidel cannot\ngainsay. All can see that there is an influence at work in the family\nthat affects the children, and that the God of Abraham is with them.\nIf the homes of professed Christians had a right religious mold, they\nwould exert a mighty influence for good. They would indeed be the\n\u201clight of the world.\u201d6\nChildren to Extend Knowledge of Bible Principles \u2014Chil-\ndren who have been properly educated, who love to be useful, to\nhelp father and mother, will extend a knowledge of correct ideas and\nBible principles to all with whom they associate.7\nWhen our own homes are what they should be, our children will\nnot be allowed to grow up in idleness and indifference to the claims\nof God in behalf of the needy all about them. As the Lord\u2019s heritage,\nthey will be qualified to take up the work where they are. A light\nwill shine from such homes which will reveal itself in behalf of the\nignorant, leading them to the source of all knowledge. An influence\nwill be exerted that will be a power for God and for His truth.8\nParents who can be approached in no other way are frequently\nreached through their children.9\nCheerful Homes Will Be a Light to Neighbors \u2014We need[37]\nmore sunshiny parents and more sunshiny Christians. We are too\nmuch shut up within ourselves. Too often the kindly, encouraging\nword, the cheery smile, are withheld from our children and from the\noppressed and discouraged.\nParents, upon you rests the responsibility of being light-bearers\nand light-givers. Shine as lights in the home, brightening the path\nthat your children must travel. As you do this, your light will shine\nto those without.10\nFrom every Christian home a holy light should shine forth. Love\nshould be revealed in action. It should flow out in all home inter-\ncourse, showing itself in thoughtful kindness, in gentle, unselfish\ncourtesy. There are homes where this principle is carried out\u2014\nhomes where God is worshiped and truest love reigns. From these\nhomes morning and evening prayer ascends to God as sweet incense,\nand His mercies and blessings descend upon the suppliants like the\nmorning dew.11\nPowerful Christian Witness 27\nResults of Family Unity\u2014The first work of Christians is to be\nunited in the family. Then the work is to extend to their neighbors\nnigh and afar off. Those who have received light are to let the light\nshine forth in clear rays. Their words, fragrant with the love of\nChrist, are to be a savor of life unto life.12\nThe more closely the members of a family are united in their\nwork in the home, the more uplifting and helpful will be the influence\nthat father and mother and sons and daughters will exert outside the\nhome.13\nGood Men Needed More Than Great Minds\u2014The happiness\nof families and churches depends upon home influences. Eternal [38]\ninterests depend upon the proper discharge of the duties of this life.\nThe world is not so much in need of great minds as of good men\nwho will be a blessing in their homes.14\nAvoid Mistakes That May Close Doors \u2014When religion is\nmanifested in the home, its influence will be felt in the church and in\nthe neighborhood. But some who profess to be Christians talk with\ntheir neighbors concerning their home difficulties. They relate their\ngrievances in such a way as to call forth sympathy for themselves;\nbut it is a great mistake to pour our trouble into the ears of others,\nespecially when many of our grievances are manufactured and exist\nbecause of our irreligious life and defective character. Those who\ngo forth to lay their private grievances before others might better\nremain at home to pray, to surrender their perverse will to God, to\nfall on the Rock and be broken, to die to self that Jesus may make\nthem vessels unto honor.15\nA lack of courtesy, a moment of petulance, a single rough,\nthoughtless word, will mar your reputation, and may close the door\nto hearts so that you can never reach them.16\nChristianity in the Home Shines Abroad\u2014The effort to make\nthe home what it should be\u2014a symbol of the home in heaven\u2014\nprepares us for work in a larger sphere. The education received by\nshowing a tender regard for each other enables us to know how to\nreach hearts that need to be taught the principles of true religion. The\nchurch needs all the cultivated spiritual force which can be obtained,\nthat all, and especially the younger members of the Lord\u2019s family,\nmay be carefully guarded. The truth lived at home makes itself felt\nin disinterested labor abroad. He who lives Christianity in the home [39]\n28 The Adventist Home\nwill be a bright and shining light everywhere.17\n1Manuscript 140, 1897.\n2The Signs of the Times, September 1, 1898.\n3Testimonies for the Church 6:429, 430.\n3Testimonies for the Church 3:80, 81.\n5Manuscript 140, 1897.\n6Patriarchs and Prophets, 144.\n7Letter 28, 1890.\n8Testimonies for the Church 6:430.\n9Ibid., 4:70.\n10The Review and Herald, January 29, 1901.\n11Patriarchs and Prophets, 144.\n12Manuscript 11, 1901.\n13Letter 189, 1903.\n14Testimonies for the Church 4:522.\n15The Signs of the Times, November 14, 1892.\n16Testimonies for the Church 5:335.\n17The Signs of the Times, September 1, 1898.\nSection 3\u2014Choosing the Life Partner [40]\n[41]\nChapter 6\u2014The Great Decision[42]\n[43]\nA Happy or Unhappy Marriage?\u2014If those who are contem-\nplating marriage would not have miserable, unhappy reflections after\nmarriage, they must make it a subject of serious, earnest reflection\nnow. This step taken unwisely is one of the most effective means of\nruining the usefulness of young men and women. Life becomes a\nburden, a curse. No one can so effectually ruin a woman\u2019s happiness\nand usefulness, and make life a heartsickening burden, as her own\nhusband; and no one can do one hundredth part as much to chill the\nhopes and aspirations of a man, to paralyze his energies and ruin\nhis influence and prospects, as his own wife. It is from the marriage\nhour that many men and women date their success or failure in this\nlife, and their hopes of the future life.1\nI wish I could make the youth see and feel their danger, especially\nthe danger of making unhappy marriages.2\nMarriage is something that will influence and affect your life both\nin this world and in the world to come. A sincere Christian will not\nadvance his plans in this direction without the knowledge that God\napproves his course. He will not want to choose for himself, but will\nfeel that God must choose for him. We are not to please ourselves,\nfor Christ pleased not Himself. I would not be understood to mean\nthat anyone is to marry one whom he does not love. This would be\nsin. But fancy and the emotional nature must not be allowed to lead\non to ruin. God requires the whole heart, the supreme affections.3\nMake Haste Slowly\u2014Few have correct views of the marriage[44]\nrelation. Many seem to think that it is the attainment of perfect\nbliss; but if they could know one quarter of the heartaches of men\nand women that are bound by the marriage vow in chains that they\ncannot and dare not break, they would not be surprised that I trace\nthese lines. Marriage, in a majority of cases, is a most galling yoke.\nThere are thousands that are mated but not matched. The books of\nheaven are burdened with the woes, the wickedness, and the abuse\nthat lie hidden under the marriage mantle. This is why I would warn\n30\nGreat Decision 31\nthe young who are of a marriageable age to make haste slowly in\nthe choice of a companion. The path of married life may appear\nbeautiful and full of happiness; but why may not you be disappointed\nas thousands of others have been?4\nThose who are contemplating marriage should consider what\nwill be the character and influence of the home they are founding.\nAs they become parents, a sacred trust is committed to them. Upon\nthem depends in a great measure the well-being of their children\nin this world, and their happiness in the world to come. To a great\nextent they determine both the physical and the moral stamp that the\nlittle ones receive. And upon the character of the home depends the\ncondition of society; the weight of each family\u2019s influence will tell\nin the upward or the downward scale.5\nVital Factors in the Choice \u2014Great care should be taken by\nChristian youth in the formation of friendships and in the choice\nof companions. Take heed, lest what you now think to be pure\ngold turns out to be base metal. Worldly associations tend to place\nobstructions in the way of your service to God, and many souls\nare ruined by unhappy unions, either business or matrimonial, with [45]\nthose who can never elevate or ennoble.6\nWeigh every sentiment, and watch every development of char-\nacter in the one with whom you think to link your life destiny. The\nstep you are about to take is one of the most important in your life,\nand should not be taken hastily. While you may love, do not love\nblindly.\nExamine carefully to see if your married life would be happy or\ninharmonious and wretched. Let the questions be raised, Will this\nunion help me heavenward? Will it increase my love for God? And\nwill it enlarge my sphere of usefulness in this life? If these reflections\npresent no drawback, then in the fear of God move forward.7\nMost men and women have acted in entering the marriage rela-\ntion as though the only question for them to settle was whether they\nloved each other. But they should realize that a responsibility rests\nupon them in the marriage relation farther than this. They should\nconsider whether their offspring will possess physical health and\nmental and moral strength. But few have moved with high motives\nand with elevated considerations which they could not lightly throw\n32 The Adventist Home\noff\u2014that society had claims upon them, that the weight of their\nfamily\u2019s influence would tell in the upward or downward scale.8\nThe choice of a life companion should be such as best to secure\nphysical, mental, and spiritual well-being for parents and for their\nchildren\u2014such as will enable both parents and children to bless their\nfellow men and to honor their Creator.9\nQualities to Be Sought in a Prospective Wife \u2014Let a young\nman seek one to stand by his side who is fitted to bear her share of\nlife\u2019s burdens, one whose influence will ennoble and refine him, and[46]\nwho will make him happy in her love.\n\u201cA prudent wife is from the Lord.\u201d \u201cThe heart of her husband\ndoth safely trust in her.... She will do him good and not evil all\nthe days of her life.\u201d \u201cShe openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in\nher tongue is the law of kindness. She looketh well to the ways of\nher household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her children\narise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her,\u201d\nsaying, \u201cMany daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest\nthem all.\u201d He who gains such a wife \u201cfindeth a good thing, and\nobtaineth favor of the Lord.\u201d10\nHere are things which should be considered: Will the one you\nmarry bring happiness to your home? Is [she] an economist, or will\nshe, if married, not only use all her own earnings, but all of yours to\ngratify a vanity, a love of appearance? Are her principles correct in\nthis direction? Has she anything now to depend upon? ... I know that\nto the mind of a man infatuated with love and thoughts of marriage\nthese questions will be brushed away as though they were of no\nconsequence. But these things should be duly considered, for they\nhave a bearing upon your future life....\nIn your choice of a wife study her character. Will she be one\nwho will be patient and painstaking? Or will she cease to care for\nyour mother and father at the very time when they need a strong son\nto lean upon? And will she withdraw him from their society to carry\nout her plans and to suit her own pleasure, and leave the father and\nmother who, instead of gaining an affectionate daughter, will have\nlost a son?11\nQualities to Be Sought in a Prospective Husband \u2014Before[47]\ngiving her hand in marriage, every woman should inquire whether\nhe with whom she is about to unite her destiny is worthy. What\nGreat Decision 33\nhas been his past record? Is his life pure? Is the love which he\nexpresses of a noble, elevated character, or is it a mere emotional\nfondness? Has he the traits of character that will make her happy?\nCan she find true peace and joy in his affection? Will she be allowed\nto preserve her individuality, or must her judgment and conscience\nbe surrendered to the control of her husband? ... Can she honor\nthe Saviour\u2019s claims as supreme? Will body and soul, thoughts\nand purposes, be preserved pure and holy? These questions have a\nvital bearing upon the well-being of every woman who enters the\nmarriage relation.12\nLet the woman who desires a peaceful, happy union, who would\nescape future misery and sorrow, inquire before she yields her affec-\ntions, Has my lover a mother? What is the stamp of her character?\nDoes he recognize his obligations to her? Is he mindful of her wishes\nand happiness? If he does not respect and honor his mother, will he\nmanifest respect and love, kindness and attention, toward his wife?\nWhen the novelty of marriage is over, will he love me still? Will he\nbe patient with my mistakes, or will he be critical, overbearing, and\ndictatorial? True affection will overlook many mistakes; love will\nnot discern them.13\nAccept Only Pure, Manly Traits\u2014Let a young woman accept\nas a life companion only one who possesses pure, manly traits of\ncharacter, one who is diligent, aspiring, and honest, one who loves\nand fears God.14\nShun those who are irreverent. Shun one who is a lover of\nidleness; shun the one who is a scoffer of hallowed things. Avoid [48]\nthe society of one who uses profane language, or is addicted to the\nuse of even one glass of liquor. Listen not to the proposals of a\nman who has no realization of his responsibility to God. The pure\ntruth which sanctifies the soul will give you courage to cut yourself\nloose from the most pleasing acquaintance whom you know does\nnot love and fear God, and knows nothing of the principles of true\nrighteousness. We may always bear with a friend\u2019s infirmities and\nwith his ignorance, but never with his vices.15\nEasier to Make a Mistake Than to Correct It \u2014Marriages\nthat are impulsive and selfishly planned generally do not result well,\nbut often turn out miserable failures. Both parties find themselves\ndeceived, and gladly would they undo that which they did under an\n34 The Adventist Home\ninfatuation. It is easier, far easier, to make a mistake in this matter\nthan to correct the error after it is made.16\nBetter to Break Unwise Engagement\u2014Even if an engagement\nhas been entered into without a full understanding of the character\nof the one with whom you intend to unite, do not think that the en-\ngagement makes it a positive necessity for you to take upon yourself\nthe marriage vow and link yourself for life to one whom you cannot\nlove and respect. Be very careful how you enter into conditional\nengagements; but better, far better, break the engagement before\nmarriage than separate afterward, as many do.17\nYou may say, \u201cBut I have given my promise, and shall I now\nretract it?\u201d I answer, If you have made a promise contrary to the\nScriptures, by all means retract it without delay, and in humility\nbefore God repent of the infatuation that led you to make so rash a\npledge. Far better take back such a promise, in the fear of God, than[49]\nkeep it, and thereby dishonor your Maker.18\nLet every step toward a marriage alliance be characterized by\nmodesty, simplicity, sincerity, and an earnest purpose to please and\nhonor God. Marriage affects the afterlife both in this world and in\nthe world to come. A sincere Christian will make no plans that God\ncannot approve.19\n1The Review and Herald, February 2, 1886.\n2Testimonies for the Church 4:622.\n3The Review and Herald, September 25, 1888.\n4The Review and Herald, February 2, 1886.\n5The Ministry of Healing, 357.\n6Fundamentals of Christian Education, 500.\n7Ibid., 104, 105.\n8Messages to Young People, 461.\n9The Ministry of Healing, 357, 358.\n10Ibid., 359.\n11Letter 23, 1886.\n12Testimonies for the Church 5:362.\n13Fundamentals of Christian Education, 105.\n14The Ministry of Healing, 359.\n15Letter 51, 1894.\n16Letter 23, 1886.\n17Fundamentals of Christian Education, 105.\n18Testimonies for the Church 5:365.\n19The Ministry of Healing, 359.\nChapter 7\u2014True Love or Infatuation [50]\nLove Is a Precious Gift From Jesus\u2014Love is a precious gift,\nwhich we receive from Jesus. Pure and holy affection is not a\nfeeling, but a principle. Those who are actuated by true love are\nneither unreasonable nor blind.1\nThere is but little real, genuine, devoted, pure love. This precious\narticle is very rare. Passion is termed love.2\nTrue love is a high and holy principle, altogether different in\ncharacter from that love which is awakened by impulse, and which\nsuddenly dies when severely tested.3\nLove is a plant of heavenly growth, and it must be fostered and\nnourished. Affectionate hearts, truthful, loving words, will make\nhappy families and exert an elevating influence upon all who come\nwithin the sphere of their influence.4\nTrue Love Versus Passion\u2014Love ... is not unreasonable; it\nis not blind. It is pure and holy. But the passion of the natural\nheart is another thing altogether. While pure love will take God\ninto all its plans, and will be in perfect harmony with the Spirit of\nGod, passion will be headstrong, rash, unreasonable, defiant of all\nrestraint, and will make the object of its choice an idol. In all the\ndeportment of one who possesses true love, the grace of God will\nbe shown. Modesty, simplicity, sincerity, morality, and religion will\ncharacterize every step toward an alliance in marriage. Those who\nare thus controlled will not be absorbed in each other\u2019s society, at\na loss of interest in the prayer meeting and the religious service. [51]\nTheir fervor for the truth will not die on account of the neglect of the\nopportunities and privileges that God has graciously given to them.5\nThat love which has no better foundation than mere sensual\ngratification will be headstrong, blind, and uncontrollable. Honor,\ntruth, and every noble, elevated power of the mind are brought under\nthe slavery of passions. The man who is bound in the chains of this\ninfatuation is too often deaf to the voice of reason and conscience;\n35\n36 The Adventist Home\nneither argument nor entreaty can lead him to see the folly of his\ncourse.6\nTrue love is not a strong, fiery, impetuous passion. On the con-\ntrary, it is calm and deep in its nature. It looks beyond mere externals,\nand is attracted by qualities alone. It is wise and discriminating, and\nits devotion is real and abiding.7\nLove, lifted out of the realm of passion and impulse, becomes\nspiritualized, and is revealed in words and acts. A Christian must\nhave a sanctified tenderness and love in which there is no impatience\nor fretfulness; the rude, harsh manners must be softened by the grace\nof Christ.8\nSentimentalism to Be Shunned as Leprosy \u2014Imagination,\nlovesick sentimentalism, should be guarded against as would be\nthe leprosy. Very many of the young men and women in this age of\nthe world are lacking in virtue; therefore great caution is needed....\nThose who have preserved a virtuous character, although they may\nlack in other desirable qualities, may be of real moral worth.9\nThere are persons who have for some time made a profession\nof religion who are, to all intents and purposes, without God and\nwithout a sensitive conscience. They are vain and trifling; their\nconversation is of a low order. Courtship and marriage occupy the[52]\nmind, to the exclusion of higher and nobler thoughts.10\nThe young are bewitched with the mania for courtship and mar-\nriage. Lovesick sentimentalism prevails. Great vigilance and tact\nare needed to guard the youth from these wrong influences.11\nDaughters are not taught self-denial and self-control. They are\npetted, and their pride is fostered. They are allowed to have their\nown way, until they become headstrong and self-willed, and you are\nput to your wits\u2019 end to know what course to pursue to save them\nfrom ruin. Satan is leading them on to be a proverb in the mouth\nof unbelievers because of their boldness, their lack of reserve and\nwomanly modesty. The young boys are likewise left to have their\nown way. They have scarcely entered their teens before they are by\nthe side of little girls of their own age, accompanying them home\nand making love to them. And the parents are so completely in\nbondage through their own indulgence and mistaken love for their\nchildren that they dare not pursue a decided course to make a change\nand restrain their too-fast children in this fast age.12\nTrue Love or Infatuation 37\nCounsel to a Romantic, Lovesick Girl\u2014You have fallen into\nthe sad error which is so prevalent in this degenerate age, especially\nwith women. You are too fond of the other sex. You love their\nsociety; your attention to them is flattering, and you encourage,\nor permit, a familiarity which does not always accord with the ex-\nhortation of the apostle, to \u201cabstain from all appearance of evil.\u201d\n...\nTurn your mind away from romantic projects. You mingle with\nyour religion a romantic, lovesick sentimentalism, which does not\nelevate, but only lowers. It is not yourself alone who is affected; [53]\nothers are injured by your example and influence.... Daydreaming\nand romantic castle building have unfitted you for usefulness. You\nhave lived in an imaginary world; you have been an imaginary\nmartyr and an imaginary Christian.\nThere is much of this low sentimentalism mingled with the reli-\ngious experience of the young in this age of the world. My sister,\nGod requires you to be transformed. Elevate your affections, I im-\nplore you. Devote your mental and physical powers to the service of\nyour Redeemer, who has bought you. Sanctify your thoughts and\nfeelings that all your works may be wrought in God.13\nCaution to a Youthful Student\u2014You are now in your student\u2019s\nlife; let your mind dwell upon spiritual subjects. Keep all sentimen-\ntalism apart from your life. Give to yourself vigilant self-instruction,\nand bring yourself under self-control. You are now in the formative\nperiod of character; nothing with you is to be considered trivial or\nunimportant which will detract from your highest, holiest interest,\nyour efficiency in the preparation to do the work God has assigned\nyou.14\nResults of Unwise Courtship and Marriage.\u2014We can see that\ninnumerable difficulties meet us at every step. The iniquity that is\ncherished by young as well as old; the unwise, unsanctified courtship\nand marriages cannot fail to result in bickerings, in strife, in alien-\nations, in indulgence of unbridled passions, in unfaithfulness of\nhusbands and wives, unwillingness to restrain the self-willed, inor-\ndinate desires, and in indifference to the things of eternal interest....\nThe holiness of the oracles of God is not loved by very many [54]\nwho claim to be Bible Christians. They show by their free, loose\n38 The Adventist Home\nconduct that they prefer a wider scope. They do not want their selfish\nindulgences limited.15\nGuard the Affections\u2014Gird up the loins of your mind, says the\napostle; then control your thoughts, not allowing them to have full\nscope. The thoughts may be guarded and controlled by your own\ndetermined efforts. Think right thoughts, and you will perform right\nactions. You have, then, to guard the affections, not letting them go\nout and fasten upon improper objects. Jesus has purchased you with\nHis own life; you belong to Him; therefore He is to be consulted in\nall things, as to how the powers of your mind and the affections of\nyour heart shall be employed.16\n1The Ministry of Healing, 358, 359.\n2Testimonies for the Church 2:381.\n3Patriarchs and Prophets, 176.\n4Testimonies for the Church 4:548.\n5The Review and Herald, September 25, 1888.\n6The Signs of the Times, July 1, 1903.\n7Testimonies for the Church 2:133.\n8Testimonies for the Church 5:335.\n9Testimonies for the Church 5:123.\n10Testimonies for the Church 4:589.\n11Ibid., 5:60.\n12Ibid., 2:460.\n13Ibid., 248-251.\n14Letter 23, 1893.\n15Manuscript 14, 1888.\n16The Youth\u2019s Instructor, April 21, 1886.\nChapter 8\u2014Common Courtship Practices [55]\nWrong Ideas of Courtship and Marriage \u2014The ideas of\ncourtship have their foundation in erroneous ideas concerning mar-\nriage. They follow impulse and blind passion. The courtship is\ncarried on in a spirit of flirtation. The parties frequently violate\nthe rules of modesty and reserve and are guilty of indiscretion, if\nthey do not break the law of God. The high, noble, lofty design of\nGod in the institution of marriage is not discerned; therefore the\npurest affections of the heart, the noblest traits of character are not\ndeveloped.\nNot one word should be spoken, not one action performed, that\nyou would not be willing the holy angels should look upon and\nregister in the books above. You should have an eye single to the\nglory of God. The heart should have only pure, sanctified affection,\nworthy of the followers of Jesus Christ, exalted in its nature, and\nmore heavenly than earthly. Anything different from this is debasing,\ndegrading in courtship; and marriage cannot be holy and honorable\nin the sight of a pure and holy God, unless it is after the exalted\nScriptural principle.1\nThe youth trust altogether too much to impulse. They should not\ngive themselves away too easily, nor be captivated too readily by the\nwinning exterior of the lover. Courtship as carried on in this age is a\nscheme of deception and hypocrisy, with which the enemy of souls\nhas far more to do than the Lord. Good common sense is needed\nhere if anywhere; but the fact is, it has little to do in the matter.2\nKeeping Late Hours\u2014The habit of sitting up late at night is [56]\ncustomary; but it is not pleasing to God, even if you are both Chris-\ntians. These untimely hours injure health, unfit the mind for the next\nday\u2019s duties, and have an appearance of evil. My brother, I hope\nyou will have self-respect enough to shun this form of courtship.\nIf you have an eye single to the glory of God, you will move with\ndeliberate caution. You will not suffer lovesick sentimentalism to so\n39\n40 The Adventist Home\nblind your vision that you cannot discern the high claims that God\nhas upon you as a Christian.3\nSatan\u2019s angels are keeping watch with those who devote a large\nshare of the night to courting. Could they have their eyes opened,\nthey would see an angel making a record of their words and acts.\nThe laws of health and modesty are violated. It would be more\nappropriate to let some of the hours of courtship before marriage\nrun through the married life. But as a general thing, marriage ends\nall the devotion manifested during the days of courtship.\nThese hours of midnight dissipation, in this age of depravity,\nfrequently lead to the ruin of both parties thus engaged. Satan exults\nand God is dishonored when men and women dishonor themselves.\nThe good name of honor is sacrificed under the spell of this infatua-\ntion, and the marriage of such persons cannot be solemnized under\nthe approval of God. They are married because passion moved them,\nand when the novelty of the affair is over, they will begin to realize\nwhat they have done.4\nSatan knows just what elements he has to deal with, and he\ndisplays his infernal wisdom in various devices to entrap souls to\ntheir ruin. He watches every step that is taken, and makes many\nsuggestions, and often these suggestions are followed rather than\nthe counsel of God\u2019s word. This finely woven, dangerous net is[57]\nskillfully prepared to entangle the young and unwary. It may often\nbe disguised under a covering of light; but those who become its\nvictims pierce themselves through with many sorrows. As the result,\nwe see wrecks of humanity everywhere.5\nTrifling With Hearts\u2014To trifle with hearts is a crime of no\nsmall magnitude in the sight of a holy God. And yet some will show\npreference for young ladies and call out their affections, and then go\ntheir way and forget all about the words they have spoken and their\neffect. A new face attracts them, and they repeat the same words,\ndevote to another the same attentions.\nThis disposition will reveal itself in the married life. The mar-\nriage relation does not always make the fickle mind firm, the wa-\nvering steadfast and true to principle. They tire of constancy, and\nunholy thoughts will manifest themselves in unholy actions. How\nessential it is, then, that the youth so gird up the loins of their mind\nCommon Courtship Practices 41\nand guard their conduct that Satan cannot beguile them from the\npath of uprightness.6\nDeceptive Practices in Courtship\u2014A young man who enjoys\nthe society and wins the friendship of a young lady unbeknown to\nher parents does not act a noble Christian part toward her or toward\nher parents. Through secret communications and meetings he may\ngain an influence over her mind, but in so doing he fails to manifest\nthat nobility and integrity of soul which every child of God will\npossess. In order to accomplish their ends, they act a part that is\nnot frank and open and according to the Bible standard, and prove\nthemselves untrue to those who love them and try to be faithful\nguardians over them. Marriages contracted under such influences [58]\nare not according to the word of God. He who would lead a daughter\naway from duty, who would confuse her ideas of God\u2019s plain and\npositive commands to obey and honor her parents, is not one who\nwould be true to the marriage obligations....\n\u201cThou shalt not steal\u201d was written by the finger of God upon the\ntables of stone, yet how much underhand stealing of affections is\npracticed and excused! A deceptive courtship is maintained, private\ncommunications are kept up, until the affections of one who is\ninexperienced, and knows not whereunto these things may grow, are\nin a measure withdrawn from her parents and placed upon him who\nshows by the very course he pursues that he is unworthy of her love.\nThe Bible condemns every species of dishonesty....\nThis underhand way in which courtships and marriages are car-\nried on is the cause of a great amount of misery, the full extent of\nwhich is known only to God. On this rock thousands have made ship-\nwreck of their souls. Professed Christians, whose lives are marked\nwith integrity, and who seem sensible upon every other subject,\nmake fearful mistakes here. They manifest a set, determined will\nthat reason cannot change. They become so fascinated with human\nfeelings and impulses that they have no desire to search the Bible\nand come into close relationship with God.7\nAvoid the First Downward Step\u2014When one commandment\nof the Decalogue is broken, the downward steps are almost certain.\nWhen once the barriers of female modesty are removed, the basest\nlicentiousness does not appear exceeding sinful. Alas, what terrible\nresults of woman\u2019s influence for evil may be witnessed in the world [59]\n42 The Adventist Home\ntoday! Through the allurements of \u201cstrange women,\u201d thousands are\nincarcerated in prison cells, many take their own lives, and many cut\nshort the lives of others. How true the words of Inspiration, \u201cHer\nfeet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.\u201d\nBeacons of warning are placed on every side in the pathway\nof life to prevent men from approaching the dangerous, forbidden\nground; but, notwithstanding this, multitudes choose the fatal path,\ncontrary to the dictates of reason, regardless of God\u2019s law, and in\ndefiance of His vengeance.\nThose who would preserve physical health, a vigorous intellect,\nand sound morals must \u201cflee ... youthful lusts.\u201d Those who will put\nforth zealous and decided efforts to check the wickedness that lifts\nits bold, presumptuous head in our midst are hated and maligned by\nall wrongdoers, but they will be honored and recompensed of God.8\nSow Wild Oats\u2014Reap a Bitter Crop\u2014You must not imperil\nyour souls by sowing wild oats. You cannot afford to be careless in\nregard to the companions you choose.9\nA little time spent in sowing your wild oats, dear young friends,\nwill produce a crop that will embitter your whole life; an hour of\nthoughtlessness, once yielding to temptation, may turn the whole\ncurrent of your life in the wrong direction. You can have but one\nyouth; make that useful. When once you have passed over the\nground, you can never return to rectify your mistakes. He who re-\nfuses to connect with God, and puts himself in the way of temptation\nwill surely fall. God is testing every youth. Many have excused their\ncarelessness and irreverence because of the wrong example given\nthem by more experienced professors. But this should not deter any[60]\nfrom right doing. In the day of final accounts you will plead no such\nexcuses as you plead now.10\n1Manuscript 4a, 1885.\n2Fundamentals of Christian Education, 105.\n3Testimonies for the Church 3:44, 45.\n4The Review and Herald, September 25, 1888.\n5Fundamentals of Christian Education, 103, 104.\n6The Review and Herald, November 4, 1884.\n7Fundamentals of Christian Education, 101-103.\n8The Signs of the Times, July 1, 1903.\n9Messages to Young People, 164.\nCommon Courtship Practices 43\n10Testimonies for the Church 4:622, 623.\nChapter 9\u2014Forbidden Marriages[61]\nMarriage of Christians With Unbelievers \u2014There is in the\nChristian world an astonishing, alarming indifference to the teaching\nof God\u2019s word in regard to the marriage of Christians with unbeliev-\ners. Many who profess to love and fear God choose to follow the\nbent of their own minds rather than take counsel of Infinite Wisdom.\nIn a matter which vitally concerns the happiness and well-being of\nboth parties for this world and the next, reason, judgment, and the\nfear of God are set aside; and blind impulse, stubborn determination\nare allowed to control.\nMen and women who are otherwise sensible and conscientious\nclose their ears to counsel; they are deaf to the appeals and entreaties\nof friends and kindred and of the servants of God. The expression\nof a caution or warning is regarded as impertinent meddling, and\nthe friend who is faithful enough to utter a remonstrance is treated\nas an enemy. All this is as Satan would have it. He weaves his\nspell about the soul, and it becomes bewitched, infatuated. Reason\nlets fall the reins of self-control upon the neck of lust; unsanctified\npassion bears sway, until, too late, the victim awakens to a life of\nmisery and bondage. This is not a picture drawn by the imagination,\nbut a recital of facts. God\u2019s sanction is not given to unions which\nHe has expressly forbidden.1\nGod\u2019s Commands Are Plain\u2014The Lord commanded ancient\nIsrael not to intermarry with the idolatrous nations around them:\n\u201cNeither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou\nshalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy[62]\nson.\u201d The reason is given. Infinite Wisdom, foreseeing the result\nof such unions, declares: \u201cFor they will turn away thy son from\nfollowing Me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of\nthe Lord be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.\u201d \u201cFor\nthou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God\nhath chosen thee to be a special people unto Himself, above all\npeople that are upon the face of the earth.\u201d ...\n44\nForbidden Marriages 45\nIn the New Testament are similar prohibitions concerning the\nmarriage of Christians with the ungodly. The Apostle Paul, in his\nfirst letter to the Corinthians, declares: \u201cThe wife is bound by the\nlaw as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is\nat liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.\u201d Again,\nin his second epistle, he writes: \u201cBe ye not unequally yoked together\nwith unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with un-\nrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness? And\nwhat concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath he that\nbelieveth with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple of\nGod with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God; as God\nhath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their\nGod, and they shall be My people. Wherefore come out from among\nthem, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean\nthing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye\nshall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\u201d2\nThe curse of God rests upon many of the ill-timed, inappropriate\nconnections that are formed in this age of the world. If the Bible left\nthese questions in a vague, uncertain light, then the course that many\nyouth of today are pursuing in their attachments for one another\nwould be more excusable. But the requirements of the Bible are not [63]\nhalfway injunctions; they demand perfect purity of thought, of word,\nand of deed. We are grateful to God that His word is a light to the\nfeet, and that none need mistake the path of duty. The young should\nmake it a business to consult its pages and heed its counsels, for sad\nmistakes are always made in departing from its precepts.3\nGod Forbids Believers Marrying Unbelievers\u2014Never should\nGod\u2019s people venture upon forbidden ground. Marriage between\nbelievers and unbelievers is forbidden by God. But too often the\nunconverted heart follows its own desires, and marriages unsanc-\ntioned by God are formed. Because of this many men and women\nare without hope and without God in the world. Their noble aspira-\ntions are dead; by a chain of circumstances they are held in Satan\u2019s\nnet. Those who are ruled by passion and impulse will have a bitter\nharvest to reap in this life, and their course may result in the loss of\ntheir souls.4\nThose who profess the truth trample on the will of God in mar-\nrying unbelievers; they lose His favor and make bitter work for\n46 The Adventist Home\nrepentance. The unbelieving may possess an excellent moral charac-\nter, but the fact that he or she has not answered to the claims of God\nand has neglected so great salvation is sufficient reason why such a\nunion should not be consummated. The character of the unbelieving\nmay be similar to that of the young man to whom Jesus addressed\nthe words, \u201cOne thing thou lackest\u201d; that was the one thing needful.5\nSolomon\u2019s Example\u2014There are men of poverty and obscurity\nwhose lives God would accept and make full of usefulness on earth[64]\nand of glory in heaven, but Satan is working persistently to defeat\nHis purposes and drag them down to perdition by marriage with\nthose whose character is such that they throw themselves directly\nacross the road to life. Very few come out from this entanglement\ntriumphant.6\nSatan well knew the results that would attend obedience; and\nduring the earlier years of Solomon\u2019s reign\u2014years glorious because\nof the wisdom, the beneficence and the uprightness of the king\u2014\nhe sought to bring in influences that would insidiously undermine\nSolomon\u2019s loyalty to principle and cause him to separate from God.\nAnd that the enemy was successful in this effort, we know from the\nrecord: \u201cSolomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and\ntook Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, and brought her into the city of David.\u201d\nIn forming an alliance with a heathen nation, and sealing the\ncompact by marriage with an idolatrous princess, Solomon rashly\ndisregarded the wise provisions that God had made for maintaining\nthe purity of His people. The hope that this Egyptian wife might be\nconverted was but a feeble excuse for the sin. In violation of a direct\ncommand to remain separate from other nations, the king united his\nstrength with the arm of flesh.\nFor a time God in His compassionate mercy overruled this ter-\nrible mistake. Solomon\u2019s wife was converted; and the king, by a\nwise course, might have done much to check the evil forces that\nhis imprudence had set in operation. But Solomon began to lose\nsight of the Source of his power and glory. Inclination gained the\nascendancy over reason. As his self-confidence increased, he sought\nto carry out the Lord\u2019s purpose in his own way....\nMany professed Christians think, like Solomon, that they may\nunite with the ungodly because their influence over those who are[65]\nin the wrong will be beneficial; but too often they themselves, en-\nForbidden Marriages 47\ntrapped and overcome, yield their sacred faith, sacrifice principle,\nand separate themselves from God. One false step leads to another,\ntill at last they place themselves where they cannot hope to break\nthe chains that bind them.7\nThe Plea\u2014\u201cHe Is Favorable to Religion.\u201d\u2014The plea is some-\ntimes made that the unbeliever is favorable to religion and is all\nthat could be desired in a companion except in one thing\u2014he is\nnot a Christian. Although the better judgment of the believer may\nsuggest the impropriety of a union for life with an unbeliever, yet,\nin nine cases out of ten, inclination triumphs. Spiritual declension\ncommences the moment the vow is made at the altar; religious fervor\nis dampened, and one stronghold after another is broken down, until\nboth stand side by side under the black banner of Satan. Even in the\nfestivities of the wedding the spirit of the world triumphs against\nconscience, faith, and truth. In the new home the hour of prayer is\nnot respected. The bride and bridegroom have chosen each other\nand dismissed Jesus.8\nThe Change Is Wrought in the Believing One \u2014At first the\nunbelieving one may make no show of opposition in the new rela-\ntion; but when the subject of Bible truth is presented for attention and\nconsideration, the feeling at once arises: \u201cYou married me, knowing\nthat I was what I am; I do not wish to be disturbed. From henceforth\nlet it be understood that conversation upon your peculiar views is to\nbe interdicted.\u201d If the believer should manifest any special earnest-\nness in regard to his faith, it might seem like unkindness toward the\none who has no interest in the Christian experience.\nThe believing one reasons that in his new relation he must con- [66]\ncede somewhat to the companion of his choice. Social, worldly\namusements are patronized. At first there is great reluctance of feel-\ning in doing this, but the interest in the truth becomes less and less,\nand faith is exchanged for doubt and unbelief. No one would have\nsuspected that the once firm, conscientious believer and devoted fol-\nlower of Christ could ever become the doubting, vacillating person\nthat he now is. Oh, the change wrought by that unwise marriage!9\nIt is a dangerous thing to form a worldly alliance. Satan well\nknows that the hour that witnesses the marriage of many young\nmen and women closes the history of their religious experience and\nusefulness. They are lost to Christ. They may for a time make an\n48 The Adventist Home\neffort to live a Christian life, but all their strivings are made against\na steady influence in the opposite direction. Once it was a privilege\nand joy to them to speak of their faith and hope; but they become\nunwilling to mention the subject, knowing that the one with whom\nthey have linked their destiny takes no interest in it. As the result,\nfaith in the precious truth dies out of the heart, and Satan insidiously\nweaves about them a web of skepticism.10\nRisking the Enjoyments of Heaven\u2014\u201cCan two walk together,\nexcept they be agreed?\u201d \u201cIf two of you shall agree on earth as touch-\ning any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of My\nFather which is in heaven.\u201d But how strange the sight! While one of\nthose so closely united is engaged in devotion, the other is indifferent\nand careless; while one is seeking the way to everlasting life, the\nother is in the broad road to death.\nHundreds have sacrificed Christ and heaven in consequence of\nmarrying unconverted persons. Can it be that the love and fellow-[67]\nship of Christ are of so little value to them that they prefer the\ncompanionship of poor mortals? Is heaven so little esteemed that\nthey are willing to risk its enjoyments for one who has no love for\nthe precious Saviour?11\nTo connect with an unbeliever is to place yourself on Satan\u2019s\nground. You grieve the Spirit of God and forfeit His protection. Can\nyou afford to have such terrible odds against you in fighting the\nbattle for everlasting life?12\nAsk yourself: \u201cWill not an unbelieving husband lead my thoughts\naway from Jesus? He is a lover of pleasure more than a lover of\nGod; will he not lead me to enjoy the things that he enjoys?\u201d The\npath to eternal life is steep and rugged. Take no additional weights\nto retard your progress.13\nA Home Where Shadows Are Never Lifted\u2014The heart yearns\nfor human love, but this love is not strong enough, or pure enough,\nor precious enough to supply the place of the love of Jesus. Only in\nher Saviour can the wife find wisdom, strength, and grace to meet\nthe cares, responsibilities, and sorrows of life. She should make\nHim her strength and her guide. Let woman give herself to Christ\nbefore giving herself to any earthly friend, and enter into no relation\nwhich shall conflict with this. Those who would find true happiness\nmust have the blessing of Heaven upon all that they possess and all\nForbidden Marriages 49\nthat they do. It is disobedience to God that fills so many hearts and\nhomes with misery. My sister, unless you would have a home where\nthe shadows are never lifted, do not unite yourself with one who is\nan enemy of God.14\nThe Christian\u2019s Reasoning\u2014What ought every Christian to do\nwhen brought into the trying position which tests the soundness of [68]\nreligious principle? With a firmness worthy of imitation he should\nsay frankly: \u201cI am a conscientious Christian. I believe the seventh\nday of the week to be the Sabbath of the Bible. Our faith and prin-\nciples are such that they lead in opposite directions. We cannot be\nhappy together, for if I follow on to gain a more perfect knowledge\nof the will of God, I shall become more and more unlike the world\nand assimilated to the likeness of Christ. If you continue to see no\nloveliness in Christ, no attractions in the truth, you will love the\nworld, which I cannot love, while I shall love the things of God,\nwhich you cannot love. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned.\nWithout spiritual discernment you will be unable to see the claims\nof God upon me, or to realize my obligations to the Master whom I\nserve; therefore you will feel that I neglect you for religious duties.\nYou will not be happy; you will be jealous on account of the affec-\ntions which I give to God, and I shall be alone in my religious belief.\nWhen your views shall change, when your heart shall respond to\nthe claims of God, and you shall learn to love my Saviour, then our\nrelationship may be renewed.\u201d\nThe believer thus makes a sacrifice for Christ which his con-\nscience approves, and which shows that he values eternal life too\nhighly to run the risk of losing it. He feels that it would be better\nto remain unmarried than to link his interest for life with one who\nchooses the world rather than Jesus, and who would lead away from\nthe cross of Christ.15\nA Safe Marriage Alliance\u2014It is only in Christ that a marriage\nalliance can be safely formed. Human love should draw its closest\nbonds from divine love. Only where Christ reigns can there be deep,\ntrue, unselfish affection.16\nWhen One Partner Is Converted After Marriage \u2014He who [69]\nhas entered the marriage relation while unconverted is by his conver-\nsion placed under stronger obligation to be faithful to his companion,\nhowever widely they may differ in regard to religious faith; yet the\n50 The Adventist Home\nclaims of God should be placed above every earthly relationship,\neven though trials and persecution may be the result. With the spirit\nof love and meekness, this fidelity may have an influence to win the\nunbelieving one.17\n1Testimonies for the Church 5:365, 366.\n2Ibid., 5:363, 364.\n3Fundamentals of Christian Education, 102, 103.\n4Ibid., 500, 501.\n5Testimonies for the Church 4:505.\n6Testimonies for the Church 5:124.\n7Fundamentals of Christian Education, 498-500.\n8Testimonies for the Church 4:505.\n9Ibid., 4:505, 506.\n10Ibid., 4:504, 505.\n11Ibid., 4:507.\n12Ibid., 5:364, 365.\n13Ibid., 5:363.\n14Ibid., 5:362, 363.\n15Ibid., 4:506, 507.\n16The Ministry of Healing, 358.\n17Patriarchs and Prophets, 175.\nChapter 10\u2014When Counsel is Needed [70]\nGet Counsel From the Bible\u2014Instituted by God, marriage is\na sacred ordinance and should never be entered upon in a spirit of\nselfishness. Those who contemplate this step should solemnly and\nprayerfully consider its importance and seek divine counsel that\nthey may know whether they are pursuing a course in harmony with\nthe will of God. The instruction given in God\u2019s word on this point\nshould be carefully considered. Heaven looks with pleasure upon a\nmarriage formed with an earnest desire to conform to the directions\ngiven in the Scripture.1\nIf there is any subject that should be considered with calm reason\nand unimpassioned judgment, it is the subject of marriage. If ever\nthe Bible is needed as a counselor, it is before taking a step that\nbinds persons together for life. But the prevailing sentiment is that\nin this matter the feelings are to be the guide, and in too many cases\nlovesick sentimentalism takes the helm and guides to certain ruin.\nIt is here that the youth show less intelligence than on any other\nsubject; it is here that they refuse to be reasoned with. The question\nof marriage seems to have a bewitching power over them. They do\nnot submit themselves to God. Their senses are enchained, and they\nmove forward in secretiveness, as if fearful that their plans would be\ninterfered with by someone.2\nMany are sailing in a dangerous harbor. They need a pilot; but\nthey scorn to accept the much-needed help, feeling that they are\ncompetent to guide their own bark, and not realizing that it is about\nto strike a hidden rock that may cause them to make shipwreck of [71]\nfaith and happiness.... Unless they are diligent students of that word\n[the Bible], they will make grave mistakes which will mar their\nhappiness and that of others, both for the present and the future life.3\nPrayer Necessary to Right Decision\u2014If men and women are\nin the habit of praying twice a day before they contemplate marriage,\nthey should pray four times a day when such a step is anticipated.\n51\n52 The Adventist Home\nMarriage is something that will influence and affect your life, both\nin this world and in the world to come....\nThe majority of the marriages of our time and the way in which\nthey are conducted make them one of the signs of the last days. Men\nand women are so persistent, so headstrong, that God is left out of\nthe question. Religion is laid aside, as if it had no part to act in this\nsolemn and important matter.4\nWhen Infatuation Is Deaf to Counsel\u2014Two persons become\nacquainted; they are infatuated with each other, and their whole at-\ntention is absorbed. Reason is blinded, and judgment is overthrown.\nThey will not submit to any advice or control, but insist on having\ntheir own way, regardless of consequences. Like some epidemic, or\ncontagion, that must run its course is the infatuation that possesses\nthem; and there seems to be no such thing as putting a stop to it.\nPerhaps there are those around them who realize that, should\nthe parties interested be united in marriage, it could only result\nin lifelong unhappiness. But entreaties and exhortations are given\nin vain. Perhaps, by such a union, the usefulness of one whom\nGod would bless in His service will be crippled and destroyed; but\nreasoning and persuasion are alike unheeded. All that can be said[72]\nby men and women of experience proves ineffectual; it is powerless\nto change the decision to which their desires have led them. They\nlose interest in the prayer meeting and in everything that pertains to\nreligion. They are wholly infatuated with each other, and the duties\nof life are neglected, as if they were matters of little concern.5\nYouth Need the Wisdom of Age and Experience \u2014When so\nmuch misery results from marriage, why will not the youth be wise?\nWhy will they continue to feel that they do not need the counsel of\nolder and more experienced persons? In business, men and women\nmanifest great caution. Before engaging in any important enterprise,\nthey prepare themselves for their work. Time, money, and much\ncareful study are devoted to the subject, lest they shall make a failure\nin their undertaking.\nHow much greater caution should be exercised in entering the\nmarriage relation\u2014a relation which affects future generations and\nthe future life? Instead of this, it is often entered upon with jest and\nlevity, impulse and passion, blindness and lack of calm consideration.\nThe only explanation of this is that Satan loves to see misery and ruin\nWhen Counsel is Needed 53\nin the world, and he weaves this net to entangle souls. He rejoices to\nhave these inconsiderate persons lose their enjoyment of this world\nand their home in the world to come.6\nMatured Judgment of Parents Should Be Valued\u2014Shall chil-\ndren consult only their own desires and inclinations irrespective of\nthe advice and judgment of their parents? Some seem never to be-\nstow a thought upon their parents\u2019 wishes or preferences, nor to\nregard their matured judgment. Selfishness has closed the door of\ntheir hearts to filial affection. The minds of the young need to be [73]\naroused in regard to this matter. The fifth commandment is the\nonly commandment to which is annexed a promise, but it is held\nlightly and is even positively ignored by the lover\u2019s claim. Slight-\ning a mother\u2019s love, dishonoring a father\u2019s care are sins that stand\nregistered against many youth.\nOne of the greatest errors connected with this subject is that the\nyoung and inexperienced must not have their affections disturbed,\nthat there must be no interference in their love experience. If there\never was a subject that needed to be viewed from every standpoint,\nit is this. The aid of the experience of others and a calm, careful\nweighing of the matter on both sides are positively essential. It is a\nsubject that is treated altogether too lightly by the great majority of\npeople. Take God and your God-fearing parents into your counsel,\nyoung friends. Pray over the matter.7\nConfide in Godly Parents\u2014If you are blessed with God-fearing\nparents, seek counsel of them. Open to them your hopes and plans;\nlearn the lessons which their life experiences have taught.8\nIf children would be more familiar with their parents, if they\nwould confide in them and unburden to them their joys and sorrows,\nthey would save themselves many a future heartache. When per-\nplexed to know what course is right, let them lay the matter just as\nthey view it before their parents, and ask advice of them. Who are so\nwell calculated to point out their dangers as godly parents? Who can\nunderstand their peculiar temperaments so well as they? Children\nwho are Christians will esteem above every earthly blessing the\nlove and approbation of their God-fearing parents. The parents can\nsympathize with the children and pray for and with them that God [74]\nwill shield and guide them. Above everything else they will point\nthem to their never-failing Friend and Counselor.9\n54 The Adventist Home\nParents to Guide the Affections of Youth\u2014Fathers and moth-\ners should feel that a duty devolves upon them to guide the affections\nof the youth, that they may be placed upon those who will be suitable\ncompanions. They should feel it a duty, by their own teaching and\nexample, with the assisting grace of God, to so mold the character\nof the children from their earliest years that they will be pure and\nnoble and will be attracted to the good and true. Like attracts like;\nlike appreciates like. Let the love for truth and purity and goodness\nbe early implanted in the soul, and the youth will seek the society of\nthose who possess these characteristics.10\nThe Example Set by Isaac \u2014Parents should never lose sight\nof their own responsibility for the future happiness of their chil-\ndren. Isaac\u2019s deference to his father\u2019s judgment was the result of the\ntraining that had taught him to love a life of obedience.11\nIsaac was highly honored by God in being made inheritor of\nthe promises through which the world was to be blessed; yet when\nhe was forty years of age, he submitted to his father\u2019s judgment in\nappointing his experienced, God-fearing servant to choose a wife\nfor him. And the result of that marriage, as presented in the Scrip-\ntures, is a tender and beautiful picture of domestic happiness: \u201cIsaac\nbrought her into his mother Sarah\u2019s tent, and took Rebekah, and she\nbecame his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after\nhis mother\u2019s death.\u201d12\nWise Parents Will Be Considerate \u2014\u201cShould parents,\u201d you[75]\nask, \u201cselect a companion without regard to the mind or feelings of\nson or daughter?\u201d I put the question to you as it should be: Should\na son or daughter select a companion without first consulting the\nparents, when such a step must materially affect the happiness of\nparents if they have any affection for their children? And should\nthat child, notwithstanding the counsel and entreaties of his parents,\npersist in following his own course? I answer decidedly: No; not\nif he never marries. The fifth commandment forbids such a course.\n\u201cHonor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the\nland which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\u201d Here is a commandment\nwith a promise which the Lord will surely fulfill to those who obey.\nWise parents will never select companions for their children without\nrespect to their wishes.13\nWhen Counsel is Needed 55\n1Letter 17, 1896.\n2Fundamentals of Christian Education, 103.\n3Ibid., 100.\n4Messages to Young People, 460.\n5The Review and Herald, September 25, 1888.\n6The Review and Herald, February 2, 1886.\n7Fundamentals of Christian Education, 104.\n8The Ministry of Healing, 359.\n9Fundamentals of Christian Education, 105, 106.\n10Patriarchs and Prophets, 176.\n11Ibid., 175, 176.\n12Ibid., 175.\n13Testimonies for the Church 5:108.\n56 The Adventist Home\nSection 4\u2014Factors that Make for Success [76]\n[77]or Failure\nChapter 11\u2014Hasty, Immature Marriages[78]\n[79]\nDangers of Childhood Attachments\u2014Early marriages are not\nto be encouraged. A relation so important as marriage and so far-\nreaching in its results should not be entered upon hastily, without\nsufficient preparation, and before the mental and physical powers\nare well developed.1\nBoys and girls enter upon the marriage relation with unripe love,\nimmature judgment, without noble, elevated feelings, and take upon\nthemselves the marriage vows, wholly led by their boyish, girlish\npassions....\nAttachments formed in childhood have often resulted in very\nwretched unions or in disgraceful separations. Early connections, if\nformed without the consent of parents, have seldom proved happy.\nThe young affections should be restrained until the period arrives\nwhen sufficient age and experience will make it honorable and safe\nto unfetter them. Those who will not be restrained will be in danger\nof dragging out an unhappy existence.\nA youth not out of his teens is a poor judge of the fitness of\na person as young as himself to be his companion for life. After\ntheir judgment has become more matured, they view themselves\nbound for life to each other and perhaps not at all calculated to make\neach other happy. Then, instead of making the best of their lot,\nrecriminations take place, the breach widens, until there is settled\nindifference and neglect of each other. To them there is nothing\nsacred in the word \u201chome.\u201d The very atmosphere is poisoned by\nunloving words and bitter reproaches.2\nImmature marriages are productive of a vast amount of the evils[80]\nthat exist today. Neither physical health nor mental vigor is pro-\nmoted by a marriage that is entered on too early in life. Upon this\nsubject altogether too little reason is exercised. Many youth act from\nimpulse. This step, which affects them seriously for good or ill, to\nbe a lifelong blessing or curse, is too often taken hastily, under the\n58\nHasty, Immature Marriages 59\nimpulse of sentiment. Many will not listen to reason or instruction\nfrom a Christian point of view.3\nSatan is constantly busy to hurry inexperienced youth into a\nmarriage alliance. But the less we glory in the marriages which are\nnow taking place, the better.4\nIn consequence of hasty marriages, even among the professed\npeople of God, there are separations, divorces, and great confusion\nin the church.5\nWhat a contrast between the course of Isaac and that pursued\nby the youth of our time, even among professed Christians! Young\npeople too often feel that the bestowal of their affections is a matter\nin which self alone should be consulted\u2014a matter that neither God\nnor their parents should in any wise control. Long before they have\nreached manhood or womanhood, they think themselves competent\nto make their own choice, without the aid of their parents. A few\nyears of married life are usually sufficient to show them their error,\nbut often too late to prevent its baleful results. For the same lack of\nwisdom and self-control that dictated the hasty choice is permitted\nto aggravate the evil, until the marriage relation becomes a galling\nyoke. Many have thus wrecked their happiness in this life and their\nhope of the life to come.6\nPotential Workers for God Entangled\u2014Young men have re-\nceived the truth and run well for a season, but Satan has woven his [81]\nmeshes about them in unwise attachments and poor marriages. This\nhe saw would be the most successful way he could allure them from\nthe path of holiness.7\nI have been shown that the youth of today have no true sense\nof their great danger. There are many of the young whom God\nwould accept as laborers in the various branches of His work, but\nSatan steps in and so entangles them in his web that they become\nestranged from God and powerless in His work. Satan is a sharp and\npersevering workman. He knows just how to entrap the unwary, and\nit is an alarming fact that but few succeed in escaping from his wiles.\nThey see no danger and do not guard against his devices. He prompts\nthem to fasten their affections upon one another without seeking\nwisdom of God or of those whom He has sent to warn, reprove, and\ncounsel. They feel self-sufficient and will not bear restraint.8\n60 The Adventist Home\nCounsel to a Teen-age Youth\u2014Your boyish ideas of love for\nyoung girls does not give anyone a high opinion of you. By letting\nyour mind run in this channel, you spoil your thoughts for study.\nYou will be led to form impure associations; your ways and the ways\nof others will be corrupted. This is just as your case is presented to\nme, and as long as you persist in following your own way, whoever\nwill seek to guide, influence, or restrain you will meet with the most\ndetermined resistance because your heart is not in harmony with\ntruth and righteousness.9\nDisparity in Age\u2014The parties may not have worldly wealth,\nbut they should have the far greater blessing of health. And in most\ncases there should not be a great disparity in age. A neglect of this[82]\nrule may result in seriously impairing the health of the younger. And\noften the children are robbed of physical and mental strength. They\ncannot receive from an aged parent the care and companionship\nwhich their young lives demand, and they may be deprived by death\nof the father or the mother at the very time when love and guidance\nare most needed.10\n1The Ministry of Healing, 358.\n2Messages to Young People, 452.\n3Ibid., 453.\n4Testimonies for the Church 2:252.\n5The Review and Herald, September 25, 1888.\n6Patriarchs and Prophets, 175.\n7Testimonies for the Church 5:114, 115.\n8Ibid., 105, 106.\n9Manuscript 15a, 1896.\n10The Ministry of Healing, 358.\nChapter 12\u2014Compatibility [83]\nAdapted to Each Other \u2014In many families there is not that\nChristian politeness, that true courtesy, deference, and respect for\none another that would prepare its members to marry and make\nhappy families of their own. In the place of patience, kindness,\ntender courtesy, and Christian sympathy and love, there are sharp\nwords, clashing ideas, and a criticizing, dictatorial spirit.1\nIt is often the case that persons before marriage have little oppor-\ntunity to become acquainted with each other\u2019s habits and disposition;\nand, so far as everyday life is concerned, they are virtually strangers\nwhen they unite their interests at the altar. Many find, too late, that\nthey are not adapted to each other, and lifelong wretchedness is the\nresult of their union. Often the wife and children suffer from the\nindolence and inefficiency or the vicious habits of the husband and\nfather.2\nThe world is full of misery and sin today in consequence of\nill-assorted marriages. In many cases it takes only a few months for\nhusband and wife to realize that their dispositions can never blend;\nand the result is that discord prevails in the home, where only the\nlove and harmony of heaven should exist.\nBy contention over trivial matters a bitter spirit is cultivated.\nOpen disagreements and bickering bring inexpressible misery into\nthe home and drive asunder those who should be united in the bonds\nof love. Thus thousands have sacrificed themselves, soul and body,\nby unwise marriages and have gone down in the path of perdition.3\nPerpetual Differences in a Divided Home \u2014The happiness [84]\nand prosperity of the married life depend upon the unity of the\nparties. How can the carnal mind harmonize with the mind that is\nassimilated to the mind of Christ? One is sowing to the flesh, think-\ning and acting in accordance with the promptings of his own heart;\nthe other is sowing to the Spirit, seeking to repress selfishness, to\novercome inclination, and to live in obedience to the Master, whose\nservant he professes to be. Thus there is a perpetual difference\n61\n62 The Adventist Home\nof taste, of inclination, and of purpose. Unless the believer shall,\nthrough his steadfast adherence to principle, win the impenitent, he\nwill, as is much more common, become discouraged and sell his\nreligious principles for the poor companionship of one who has no\nconnection with Heaven.4\nMarriages Wrecked by Incompatibility \u2014Many marriages\ncan only be productive of misery; and yet the minds of the youth run\nin this channel because Satan leads them there, making them believe\nthat they must be married in order to be happy, when they have not\nthe ability to control themselves or support a family. Those who are\nnot willing to adapt themselves to each other\u2019s disposition, so as to\navoid unpleasant differences and contentions, should not take the\nstep. But this is one of the alluring snares of the last days, in which\nthousands are ruined for this life and the next.5\nThe Aftermath of Blind Love \u2014Every faculty of those who\nbecome affected by this contagious disease\u2014blind love\u2014is brought\nin subjection to it. They seem to be devoid of good sense, and their\ncourse of action is disgusting to all who behold it.... With many\nthe crisis of the disease is reached in an immature marriage, and\nwhen the novelty is past and the bewitching power of love-making[85]\nis over, one or both parties awake to their true situation. They then\nfind themselves ill-mated, but united for life. Bound to each other\nby the most solemn vows, they look with sinking hearts upon the\nmiserable life they must lead. They ought then to make the best of\ntheir situation, but many will not do this. They will either prove false\nto their marriage vows or make the yoke which they persisted in\nplacing upon their own necks so very galling that not a few cowardly\nput an end to their existence.6\nIt should henceforth be the life study of both husband and wife\nhow to avoid everything that creates contention and to keep unbroken\nthe marriage vows.7\nExperience of Others a Warning \u2014Mr. A has a nature that\nSatan plays upon with wonderful success. This case is one that\nshould teach the young a lesson in regard to marriage. His wife\nfollowed feeling and impulse, not reason and judgment, in selecting\na companion. Was their marriage the result of true love? No, no; it\nwas the result of impulse\u2014blind, unsanctified passion. Neither was\nat all fitted for the responsibilities of married life. When the novelty\nCompatibility 63\nof the new order of things wore away, and each became acquainted\nwith the other, did their love become stronger, their affection deeper,\nand their lives blend together in beautiful harmony? It was entirely\nthe opposite. The worst traits of their characters began to deepen by\nexercise; and, instead of their married life being one of happiness, it\nhas been one of increasing trouble.8\nFor years I have been receiving letters from different persons\nwho have formed unhappy marriages, and the revolting histories\nopened before me are enough to make the heart ache. It is no easy [86]\nthing to decide what advice can be given to these unfortunate ones,\nor how their hard lot can be lightened; but their sad experience should\nbe a warning to others.9\n1The Review and Herald, February 2, 1886.\n2Patriarchs and Prophets, 189.\n3Messages to Young People, 453.\n4Testimonies for the Church 4:507, 508.\n5Testimonies for the Church 5:122, 123.\n6Testimonies for the Church 5:110, 111.\n7Testimonies for the Church 5:122.\n8Testimonies for the Church 5:121, 122.\n9Testimonies for the Church 5:366.\nChapter 13\u2014Domestic Training[87]\nPreparation for Marriage Is an Essential Part of Educa-\ntion\u2014Upon no account should the marriage relation be entered\nupon until the parties have a knowledge of the duties of a practical\ndomestic life. The wife should have culture of mind and manners\nthat she may be qualified to rightly train the children that may be\ngiven her.1\nMany ladies, accounted well-educated, having graduated with\nhonors at some institution of learning, are shamefully ignorant of\nthe practical duties of life. They are destitute of the qualifications\nnecessary for the proper regulation of family, and hence essential to\nits happiness. They may talk of woman\u2019s elevated sphere and of her\nrights, yet they themselves fall far below the true sphere of woman.\nIt is the right of every daughter of Eve to have a thorough knowl-\nedge of household duties, to receive training in every department\nof domestic labor. Every young lady should be so educated that if\ncalled to fill the position of wife and mother, she may preside as a\nqueen in her own domain. She should be fully competent to guide\nand instruct her children and to direct her servants, or, if need be,\nto minister with her own hands to the wants of her household. It is\nher right to understand the mechanism of the human body and the\nprinciples of hygiene, the matters of diet and dress, labor and recre-\nation, and countless others that intimately concern the well-being\nof her household. It is her right to obtain such a knowledge of the[88]\nbest methods of treating disease that she can care for her children in\nsickness, instead of leaving her precious treasures in the hands of\nstranger nurses and physicians.\nThe idea that ignorance of useful employment is an essential\ncharacteristic of the true gentleman or lady is contrary to the design\nof God in the creation of man. Idleness is a sin, and ignorance of\ncommon duties is the result of folly, which afterlife will give ample\noccasion to bitterly regret.2\n64\nDomestic Training 65\nYoung women think that it is menial to cook and do other kinds\nof housework; and, for this reason, many girls who marry and have\nthe care of families have little idea of the duties devolving upon a\nwife and mother.3\nIt should be a law that young people should not get married\nunless they know how to care for the children that are brought into\ntheir family. They must know how to take care of this house that\nGod has given them. Unless they understand in regard to the laws\nwhich God has established in their system, they cannot understand\ntheir duty to their God or themselves.4\nDomestic Training Should Be in the College Curriculum \u2014\nThe education which the young men and women who attend our\ncolleges should receive in the home life is deserving of special\nattention. It is of great importance in the work of character building\nthat students who attend our colleges be taught to take up the work\nthat is appointed them, throwing off all inclination to sloth. They\nneed to become familiar with the duties of daily life. They should be\ntaught to do their domestic duties thoroughly and well, with as little\nnoise and confusion as possible. Everything should be done decently\nand in order. The kitchen and all other parts of the building should [89]\nbe kept sweet and clean. Books should be laid aside till their proper\nseason, and no more study should be taken than can be attended to\nwithout neglecting the household duties. The study of books is not\nto engross the mind to the neglect of home duties upon which the\ncomfort of the family depends.\nIn the performance of these duties careless, neglectful, disorderly\nhabits should be overcome; for unless corrected, these habits will\nbe carried into every phase of life, and the life will be spoiled for\nusefulness.5\nA Knowledge of Homemaking Is Indispensable \u2014Many of\nthe branches of study that consume the student\u2019s time are not es-\nsential to usefulness or happiness, but it is essential for every youth\nto have a thorough acquaintance with everyday duties. If need be,\na young woman can dispense with a knowledge of French and al-\ngebra, or even of the piano; but it is indispensable that she learn to\nmake good bread, to fashion neatly fitting garments, and to perform\nefficiently the many duties that pertain to homemaking.\n66 The Adventist Home\nTo the health and happiness of the whole family nothing is more\nvital than skill and intelligence on the part of the cook. By ill-\nprepared, unwholesome food she may hinder and even ruin both\nthe adult\u2019s usefulness and the child\u2019s development. Or by providing\nfood adapted to the needs of the body, and at the same time inviting\nand palatable, she can accomplish as much in the right as otherwise\nshe accomplishes in the wrong direction. So, in many ways, life\u2019s\nhappiness is bound up with faithfulness in common duties.6\nGive Attention to the Principles of Hygiene\u2014The principles\nof hygiene as applied to diet, exercise, the care of children, the[90]\ntreatment of the sick, and many like matters should be given much\nmore attention than they ordinarily receive.7\nIn the study of hygiene the earnest teacher will improve every\nopportunity to show the necessity of perfect cleanliness both in\npersonal habits and in all one\u2019s surroundings.... Teach the pupils\nthat a healthful sleeping room, a thoroughly clean kitchen, and\na tastefully arranged, wholesomely supplied table will go farther\ntoward securing the happiness of the family and the regard of every\nsensible visitor than any amount of expensive furnishing in the\ndrawing room. That \u201cthe life is more than meat, and the body is\nmore than raiment\u201d [Luke 12:23] is a lesson no less needed now\nthan when given by the divine Teacher eighteen hundred years ago.8\nA Young Lady Counseled to Acquire Habits of Industry \u2014\nYou have peculiarities of character which need to be sternly dis-\nciplined and resolutely controlled before you can with any safety\nenter the marriage relation. Therefore marriage should be put from\nyour mind until you overcome the defects in your character, for you\nwould not make a happy wife. You have neglected to educate your-\nself for systematic household labor. You have not seen the necessity\nof acquiring habits of industry. The habit of enjoying useful labor,\nonce formed, will never be lost. You are then prepared to be placed\nin any circumstances in life, and you will be fitted for the position.\nYou will learn to love activity. If you enjoy useful labor, your mind\nwill be occupied with your employment, and you will not find time\nto indulge in dreamy fancies.\nKnowledge of useful labor will impart to your restless and dis-[91]\nsatisfied mind energy, efficiency, and a becoming, modest dignity,\nwhich will command respect.9\nDomestic Training 67\nValue of Practical Education for Girls\u2014Many who consider\nit necessary for a son to be trained with reference to his own fu-\nture maintenance seem to consider it entirely optional with herself\nwhether or not their daughter is educated to be independent and self-\nsupporting. She usually learns little at school which can be put to\npractical use in earning her daily bread; and receiving no instruction\nat home in the mysteries of the kitchen and domestic life, she grows\nup utterly useless, a burden upon her parents....\nA woman who has been taught to take care of herself is also\nfitted to take care of others. She will never be a drug in the family\nor in society. When fortune frowns, there will be a place for her\nsomewhere, a place where she can earn an honest living and assist\nthose who are dependent upon her. Woman should be trained to some\nbusiness whereby she can gain a livelihood if necessary. Passing over\nother honorable employments, every girl should learn to take charge\nof the domestic affairs of home, should be a cook, a housekeeper,\na seamstress. She should understand all those things which it is\nnecessary that the mistress of a house should know, whether her\nfamily are rich or poor. Then, if reverses come, she is prepared for\nany emergency; she is, in a manner, independent of circumstances.10\nA knowledge of domestic duties is beyond price to every woman.\nThere are families without number whose happiness is wrecked by\nthe inefficiency of the wife and mother. It is not so important that our\ndaughters learn painting, fancywork, music, or even \u201ccube root\u201d, or\nthe figures of rhetoric, as that they learn how to cut, make, and mend [92]\ntheir own clothing, or to prepare food in a wholesome and palatable\nmanner. When a little girl is nine or ten years old, she should be\nrequired to take her regular share in household duties, as she is able,\nand should be held responsible for the manner in which she does her\nwork. That was a wise father who, when asked what he intended to\ndo with his daughters, replied, \u201cI intend to apprentice them to their\nexcellent mother, that they may learn the art of improving time, and\nbe fitted to become wives and mothers, heads of families, and useful\nmembers of society.\u201d11\nThe Prospective Husband Should Be Thrifty and Industri-\nous\u2014In early times custom required the bridegroom, before the\nratification of a marriage engagement, to pay a sum of money or its\nequivalent in other property, according to his circumstances, to the\n68 The Adventist Home\nfather of his wife. This was regarded as a safeguard to the marriage\nrelation. Fathers did not think it safe to trust the happiness of their\ndaughters to men who had not made provision for the support of a\nfamily. If they had not sufficient thrift and energy to manage business\nand acquire cattle or lands, it was feared that their life would prove\nworthless. But provision was made to test those who had nothing to\npay for a wife. They were permitted to labor for the father whose\ndaughter they loved, the length of time being regulated by the value\nof the dowry required. When the suitor was faithful in his services,\nand proved in other respects worthy, he obtained the daughter as his\nwife; and generally the dowry which the father had received was\ngiven her at her marriage....\nThe ancient custom, though sometimes abused, as by Laban,\nwas productive of good results. When the suitor was required to[93]\nrender service to secure his bride, a hasty marriage was prevented,\nand there was opportunity to test the depth of his affections, as well\nas his ability to provide for a family. In our time many evils result\nfrom pursuing an opposite course.12\nNo man is excusable for being without financial ability. Of many\na man it may be said, He is kind, amiable, generous, a good man,\na Christian; but he is not qualified to manage his own business. As\nfar as the outlay of means is concerned, he is a mere child. He has\nnot been brought up by his parents to understand and to practice the\nprinciples of self-support.13\n1Pacific Health Journal, May, 1890.\n2Fundamentals of Christian Education, 75.\n3The Ministry of Healing, 302.\n4Manuscript 19, 1887.\n5Testimonies for the Church 6:169, 170.\n6Education, 216.\n7Education, 197.\n8Education, 200.\n9Testimonies for the Church 3:336.\n10The Health Reformer, December, 1877.\n11Fundamentals of Christian Education, 74.\n12Patriarchs and Prophets, 188, 189.\n13Letter 123, 1900.\nChapter 14\u2014True Conversion a Requisite [94]\nReligion Ensures Family Happiness \u2014Family religion is a\nwonderful power. The conduct of the husband toward the wife\nand of the wife toward the husband may be such that it will make\nthe home life a preparation for entrance to the family above.1\nHearts that are filled with the love of Christ can never get very\nfar apart. Religion is love, and a Christian home is one where love\nreigns and finds expression in words and acts of thoughtful kindness\nand gentle courtesy.2\nReligion is needed in the home. Only this can prevent the\ngrievous wrongs which so often embitter married life. Only where\nChrist reigns can there be deep, true, unselfish love. Then soul will\nbe knit with soul, and the two lives will blend in harmony. Angels of\nGod will be guests in the home, and their holy vigils will hallow the\nmarriage chamber. Debasing sensuality will be banished. Upward to\nGod will the thoughts be directed; to Him will the heart\u2019s devotion\nascend.3\nIn every family where Christ abides, a tender interest and love\nwill be manifested for one another; not a spasmodic love expressed\nonly in fond caresses, but a love that is deep and abiding.4\nChristianity to Be a Controlling Influence \u2014Christianity\nought to have a controlling influence upon the marriage relation, but\nit is too often the case that the motives which lead to this union are\nnot in keeping with Christian principles. Satan is constantly seeking\nto strengthen his power over the people of God by inducing them\nto enter into alliance with his subjects, and in order to accomplish [95]\nthis he endeavors to arouse unsanctified passions in the heart. But\nthe Lord has in His word plainly instructed His people not to unite\nthemselves with those who have not His love abiding in them.5\nCounsel to a Newly Married Couple\u2014Marriage, a union for\nlife, is a symbol of the union between Christ and His church. The\nspirit that Christ manifests toward His church is the spirit that the\nhusband and wife are to manifest toward each other. If they love God\n69\n70 The Adventist Home\nsupremely, they will love each other in the Lord, ever treating each\nother courteously, drawing in even cords. In their mutual self-denial\nand self-sacrifice they will be a blessing to each other....\nBoth of you need to be converted. Neither of you have a proper\nidea of the meaning of obedience to God. Study the words, \u201cHe\nthat is not with Me is against Me; and he that gathereth not with Me\nscattereth abroad.\u201d I sincerely hope that you will both become true\nchildren of God, servants to whom He can entrust responsibilities.\nThen peace and confidence and faith will come to you. Yes, you\nmay both be happy, consistent Christians. Cultivate keenness of\nperception, that you may know how to choose the good and refuse\nthe evil. Make the word of God your study. The Lord Jesus wants\nyou to be saved. He has wonderfully preserved you, my brother,\nthat your life may be one of usefulness. Bring all the good works\npossible into it.\nUnless you have an earnest desire to become children of God,\nyou will not understand clearly how to help each other. To each\nother ever be tender and thoughtful, giving up your own wishes and\npurposes to make each other happy. Day by day you may make\nadvancement in self-knowledge. Day by day you may learn better\nhow to strengthen your weak points of character. The Lord Jesus[96]\nwill be your light, your strength, your crown of rejoicing, because\nyou yield the will to His will....\nYou need the subduing grace of God in your heart. Do not desire\na life of ease and inactivity. All who are connected with the Lord\u2019s\nwork must be constantly on guard against selfishness. Keep your\nlamp trimmed and burning. Then you will not be reckless of your\nwords and actions. You will both be happy if you try to please each\nother. Keep the windows of the soul closed earthward and opened\nheavenward.\nMen and women may reach a high standard, if they will but ac-\nknowledge Christ as their personal Saviour. Watch and pray, making\na surrender of all to God. The knowledge that you are striving for\neternal life will strengthen and comfort you both. In thought, in\nword, in action, you are to be lights in the world. Discipline your-\nselves in the Lord; for He has committed to you sacred trusts, which\nyou cannot properly fulfill without this discipline. By believing\nin Jesus, you are not only to save your own souls, but by precept\nTrue Conversion a Requisite 71\nand example you are to seek to save other souls. Take Christ as\nyour pattern. Hold Him up as the One who can give you power to\novercome. Utterly destroy the root of selfishness. Magnify God, for\nyou are His children.

All who enter into matrimonial relations with a holy\npurpose\u2014the husband to obtain the pure affections of a woman\u2019s\nheart, the wife to soften and improve her husband\u2019s character and\ngive it completeness\u2014fulfill God\u2019s purpose for them.\nChrist came not to destroy this institution, but to restore it to its\noriginal sanctity and elevation. He came to restore the moral image\nof God in man, and He began His work by sanctioning the marriage\nrelation.1\nHe who gave Eve to Adam as a helpmeet performed His first\nmiracle at a marriage festival. In the festal hall where friends and\nkindred rejoiced together, Christ began His public ministry. Thus He\nsanctioned marriage, recognizing it as an institution that He Himself\nhad established. He ordained that men and women should be united\nin holy wedlock, to rear families whose members, crowned with\nhonor, should be recognized as members of the family above.2\nJesus Wants Happy Marriages\u2014The divine love emanating\nfrom Christ never destroys human love, but includes it. By it human\nlove is refined and purified, elevated and ennobled. Human love\ncan never bear its precious fruit until it is united with the divine\nnature and trained to grow heavenward. Jesus wants to see happy\nmarriages, happy firesides.3\nLike every other one of God\u2019s good gifts entrusted to the keeping[100]\nof humanity, marriage has been perverted by sin; but it is the purpose\nof the gospel to restore its purity and beauty....\nThe grace of Christ, and this alone, can make this institution what\nGod designed it should be\u2014an agent for the blessing and uplifting\nof humanity. And thus the families of earth, in their unity and peace\nand love, may represent the family of heaven.\n74\nSolemn Promises 75\nThe condition of society presents a sad comment upon Heaven\u2019s\nideal of this sacred relation. Yet even for those who have found bit-\nterness and disappointment where they had hoped for companionship\nand joy, the gospel of Christ offers a solace.4\nA Joyous Occasion\u2014The Scriptures state that both Jesus and\nHis disciples were called to this marriage feast [at Cana]. Christ has\ngiven Christians no sanction to say when invited to a marriage, We\nought not to be present on so joyous an occasion. By attending this\nfeast Christ taught that He would have us rejoice with those who\ndo rejoice in the observance of His statutes. He never discouraged\nthe innocent festivities of mankind when carried on in accordance\nwith the laws of Heaven. A gathering that Christ honored by His\npresence, it is right that His followers should attend. After attending\nthis feast, Christ attended many others, sanctifying them by His\npresence and instruction.5\nDisplay, Extravagance, and Hilarity Are Inappropriate At\nWeddings\u2014Marriage ceremonies are made matters of display, ex-\ntravagance, and self-indulgence. But if the contracting parties are\nagreed in religious belief and practice, and everything is consistent,\nand the ceremony be conducted without display and extravagance, [101]\nmarriage at this time need not be displeasing to God.6\nThere is no reason why we should make great parade or display,\neven if the parties were perfectly suited to each other.7\nIt has always seemed so very inappropriate to me to see the\nmarriage ordinance associated with hilarity and glee and a pretense\nof something. No. It is an ordinance ordained of God, to be looked\nupon with the greatest solemnity. As the family relation is formed\nhere below, it is to give a demonstration of what they shall be, the\nfamily in heaven above. The glory of God is ever to be made first.8\nA Wedding in Mrs. White\u2019s Home\u2014About 11 a.m. Tuesday\nour large dining room was prepared for the wedding ceremony.\nBrother B officiated in the service, and it passed off nicely. The\nrequest was made ... that Sister White should offer prayer after the\nmarriage ceremony. The Lord gave me special freedom. My heart\nwas softened and subdued by the Spirit of God. On this occasion\nthere were no light jests or foolish sayings: everything was solemn\nand sacred in connection with this marriage. Everything was of\nan elevating character and deeply impressive. The Lord sanctified\n76 The Adventist Home\nthis marriage, and these two now unite their interests to work in the\nmission field, to seek and to save them that are lost. God will bless\nthem in their work if they walk humbly with Him, leaning wholly\nupon His promises.9\nThe Blending of Two Lives [Note: Remarks by Mrs. E. G.\nWhite on the occasion of a wedding ceremony at Sanitarium Califor-\nnia, in 1905.]\u2014This is an important period in the history of the ones\nwho have stood before you to unite their interests, their sympathies,[102]\ntheir love, their labor, with each other in the ministry of the saving\nof souls. In the marriage relation there is a very important step\ntaken\u2014the blending of two lives into one.... It is in accord with the\nwill of God that man and wife should be linked together in His work,\nto carry it forward in a wholeness and a holiness. They can do this.\nThe blessing of God in the home where this union shall exist\nis as the sunshine of heaven, because it is the Lord\u2019s ordained will\nthat man and wife should be linked together in holy bonds of union,\nunder Jesus Christ, with Him to control, and His spirit to guide....\nGod wants the home to be the happiest place on earth, the very\nsymbol of the home in heaven. Bearing the marriage responsibilities\nin the home, linking their interests with Jesus Christ, leaning upon\nHis arm and His assurance, husband and wife may share a happiness\nin this union that angels of God commend.\nMarriage does not lessen their usefulness, but strengthens it.\nThey may make that married life a ministry to win souls to Christ;\nand I know whereof I speak, because for thirty-six years my husband\nand I were united, and we went everywhere that the Lord said Go.\nIn this matter we know that we have the commendation of God in\nthe marriage relation. Therefore it is a solemn ordinance....\nAnd now I can at this time take by the hand this our brother; ...\nand we take by the hand you, his wife, and urge you to carry on\nthe work of God unitedly. I would say, Make God your counselor.\nBlend, blend together.10\nCounsel to a Newly Wedded Pair\u2014My Dear Brother and Sis-\nter: You have united in a lifelong covenant. Your education in[103]\nmarried life has begun. The first year of married life is a year of\nexperience, a year in which husband and wife learn each other\u2019s\ndifferent traits of character, as a child learns lessons in school. In\nSolemn Promises 77\nthis, the first year of your married life, let there be no chapters that\nwill mar your future happiness....\nMy brother, your wife\u2019s time and strength and happiness are now\nbound up with yours. Your influence over her may be a savor of life\nunto life or of death unto death. Be very careful not to spoil her life.\nMy sister, you are now to learn your first practical lessons in\nregard to the responsibilities of married life. Be sure to learn these\nlessons faithfully day by day.... Guard constantly against giving way\nto selfishness.\nIn your life union your affections are to be tributary to each\nother\u2019s happiness. Each is to minister to the happiness of the other.\nThis is the will of God concerning you. But while you are to blend\nas one, neither of you is to lose his or her individuality in the other.\nGod is the owner of your individuality. Of Him you are to ask: What\nis right? What is wrong? How may I best fulfill the purpose of my\ncreation?11\nA Pledge Before Heavenly Witnesses\u2014God has ordained that\nthere should be perfect love and harmony between those who enter\ninto the marriage relation. Let bride and bridegroom, in the presence\nof the heavenly universe, pledge themselves to love each other as\nGod has ordained they should.... The wife is to respect and reverence\nher husband, and the husband is to love and cherish his wife.12\nMen and women, at the beginning of married life, should recon-\nsecrate themselves to God.13\nBe as true as steel to your marriage vows, refusing, in thought, [104]\nword, or deed, to spoil your record as a man who fears God and\nobeys His commandments.14\n1Manuscript 16, 1899.\n2The Ministry of Healing, 356.\n3The Bible Echo, September 4, 1899.\n4The Review and Herald, December 10, 1908.\n5Manuscript 16, 1899.\n6The Review and Herald, September 25, 1888.\n7Testimonies for the Church 4:515.\n8Manuscript 170, 1905.\n9Manuscript 23, 1894.\n10Manuscript 170, 1905.\n11Testimonies for the Church 7:45.\n12The Bible Echo, September 4, 1899.\n78 The Adventist Home\n13Manuscript 70, 1903.\n14Letter 231, 1903.\nChapter 16\u2014A Happy, Successful Partnership [105]\nThe Real Union Is a Lifelong Experience \u2014To gain a proper\nunderstanding of the marriage relation is the work of a lifetime.\nThose who marry enter a school from which they are never in this\nlife to be graduated.1\nHowever carefully and wisely marriage may have been entered\ninto, few couples are completely united when the marriage ceremony\nis performed. The real union of the two in wedlock is the work of\nthe afteryears.2\nAs life with its burden of perplexity and care meets the newly\nwedded pair, the romance with which imagination so often invests\nmarriage disappears. Husband and wife learn each other\u2019s character\nas it was impossible to learn it in their previous association. This is\na most critical period in their experience. The happiness and useful-\nness of their whole future life depend upon their taking a right course\nnow. Often they discern in each other unsuspected weaknesses and\ndefects; but the hearts that love has united will discern excellencies\nalso heretofore unknown. Let all seek to discover the excellencies\nrather than the defects. Often it is our own attitude, the atmosphere\nthat surrounds ourselves, which determines what will be revealed to\nus in another.3\nLove Must Be Tested and Tried\u2014Affection may be as clear as\ncrystal and beauteous in its purity, yet it may be shallow because\nit has not been tested and tried. Make Christ first and last and best\nin everything. Constantly behold Him, and your love for Him will\ndaily become deeper and stronger as it is submitted to the test of [106]\ntrial. And as your love for Him increases, your love for each other\nwill grow deeper and stronger.4\nThough difficulties, perplexities, and discouragements may arise,\nlet neither husband nor wife harbor the thought that their union\nis a mistake or a disappointment. Determine to be all that it is\npossible to be to each other. Continue the early attentions. In every\nway encourage each other in fighting the battles of life. Study to\n79\n80 The Adventist Home\nadvance the happiness of each other. Let there be mutual love,\nmutual forbearance. Then marriage, instead of being the end of love,\nwill be as it were the very beginning of love. The warmth of true\nfriendship, the love that binds heart to heart, is a foretaste of the joys\nof heaven.5\nAll should cultivate patience by practicing patience. By being\nkind and forbearing, true love may be kept warm in the heart, and\nqualities will be developed that Heaven will approve.6\nThe Enemy Will Seek to Alienate\u2014Satan is ever ready to take\nadvantage when any matter of variance arises, and by moving upon\nthe objectionable, hereditary traits of character in husband or wife,\nhe will try to cause the alienation of those who have united their\ninterests in a solemn covenant before God. In the marriage vows\nthey have promised to be as one, the wife covenanting to love and\nobey her husband, the husband promising to love and cherish his\nwife. If the law of God is obeyed, the demon of strife will be kept\nout of the family, and no separation of interests will take place, no\nalienation of affection will be permitted.7\nCounsel to a Strong-willed Couple\u2014Neither husband nor wife\nis to make a plea for rulership. The Lord has laid down the principle[107]\nthat is to guide in this matter. The husband is to cherish his wife\nas Christ cherishes the church. And the wife is to respect and love\nher husband. Both are to cultivate the spirit of kindness, being\ndetermined never to grieve or injure the other....\nDo not try to compel each other to do as you wish. You cannot do\nthis and retain each other\u2019s love. Manifestations of self-will destroy\nthe peace and happiness of the home. Let not your married life be\none of contention. If you do, you will both be unhappy. Be kind in\nspeech and gentle in action, giving up your own wishes. Watch well\nyour words, for they have a powerful influence for good or for ill.\nAllow no sharpness to come into your voices. Bring into your united\nlife the fragrance of Christlikeness.8\nExpress Love in Words and Deeds\u2014There are many who re-\ngard the expression of love as a weakness, and they maintain a\nreserve that repels others. This spirit checks the current of sympathy.\nAs the social and generous impulses are repressed, they wither, and\nthe heart becomes desolate and cold. We should beware of this error.\nHappy, Successful Partnership 81\nLove cannot long exist without expression. Let not the heart of one\nconnected with you starve for the want of kindness and sympathy....\nLet each give love rather than exact it. Cultivate that which is\nnoblest in yourselves, and be quick to recognize the good qualities\nin each other. The consciousness of being appreciated is a wonderful\nstimulus and satisfaction. Sympathy and respect encourage the\nstriving after excellence, and love itself increases as it stimulates to\nnobler aims.9\nThe reason there are so many hardhearted men and women in\nour world is that true affection has been regarded as weakness and [108]\nhas been discouraged and repressed. The better part of the nature\nof persons of this class was perverted and dwarfed in childhood;\nand unless rays of divine light can melt away their coldness and\nhardhearted selfishness, the happiness of such is buried forever. If\nwe would have tender hearts, such as Jesus had when He was upon\nthe earth, and sanctified sympathy, such as the angels have for sinful\nmortals, we must cultivate the sympathies of childhood, which are\nsimplicity itself. Then we shall be refined, elevated, and directed by\nheavenly principles.10\nToo many cares and burdens are brought into our families, and\ntoo little of natural simplicity and peace and happiness is cherished.\nThere should be less care for what the outside world will say and\nmore thoughtful attention to the members of the family circle. There\nshould be less display and affectation of worldly politeness, and\nmuch more tenderness and love, cheerfulness and Christian cour-\ntesy, among the members of the household. Many need to learn how\nto make home attractive, a place of enjoyment. Thankful hearts and\nkind looks are more valuable than wealth and luxury, and content-\nment with simple things will make home happy if love be there.11\nThe Little Attentions Count\u2014God tests and proves us by the\ncommon occurrences of life. It is the little things which reveal the\nchapters of the heart. It is the little attentions, the numerous small\nincidents and simple courtesies of life, that make up the sum of life\u2019s\nhappiness; and it is the neglect of kindly, encouraging, affectionate\nwords, and the little courtesies of life, which helps compose the sum\nof life\u2019s wretchedness. It will be found at last that the denial of self\nfor the good and happiness of those around us constitutes a large [109]\nshare of the life record in heaven. And the fact will also be revealed\n82 The Adventist Home\nthat the care of self, irrespective of the good and happiness of others,\nis not beneath the notice of our heavenly Father.12\nA Husband Who Failed to Express Affection\u2014A house with\nlove in it, where love is expressed in words and looks and deeds,\nis a place where angels love to manifest their presence and hallow\nthe scene by rays of light from glory. There the humble household\nduties have a charm in them. None of life\u2019s duties will be unpleasant\nto your wife under such circumstances. She will perform them with\ncheerfulness of spirit and will be like a sunbeam to all around her,\nand she will be making melody in her heart to the Lord. At present\nshe feels that she has not your heart\u2019s affections. You have given her\noccasion to feel thus. You perform the necessary duties devolving\nupon you as head of the family, but there is a lack. There is a serious\nlack of love\u2019s precious influence which leads to kindly attentions.\nLove should be seen in the looks and manners and heard in the tones\nof the voice.13\nA Disappointing, Self-centered Wife \u2014The moral character\nof those united in marriage is either elevated or degraded by their\nassociation; and the work of deterioration accomplished by a low,\ndeceptive, selfish, uncontrollable nature is begun soon after the\nmarriage ceremony. If the young man makes a wise choice, he may\nhave one to stand by his side who will bear to the utmost of her\nability her share of the burdens of life, who will ennoble and refine\nhim, and make him happy in her love. But if the wife is fitful in\ncharacter, self-admiring, exacting, accusing, charging her husband\nwith motives and feelings that originate only in her own perverted[110]\ntemperament; if she has not discernment and nice discrimination to\nrecognize his love and appreciate it, but talks of neglect and lack\nof love because he does not gratify every whim, she will almost\ninevitably bring about the very state of things she seems to deplore;\nshe will make all these accusations realities.14\nCharacteristics of a Companionable Wife and Mother \u2014In-\nstead of sinking into a mere household drudge, let the wife and\nmother take time to read, to keep herself well informed, to be a\ncompanion to her husband, and to keep in touch with the developing\nminds of her children. Let her use wisely the opportunities now hers\nto influence her dear ones for the higher life. Let her take time to\nmake the dear Saviour a daily Companion and familiar Friend. Let\nHappy, Successful Partnership 83\nher take time for the study of His word, take time to go with the\nchildren into the fields and learn of God through the beauty of His\nworks.\nLet her keep cheerful and buoyant. Instead of spending every\nmoment in endless sewing, make the evening a pleasant social sea-\nson, a family reunion after the day\u2019s duties. Many a man would thus\nbe led to choose the society of his home before that of the clubhouse\nor the saloon. Many a boy would be kept from the street or the corner\ngrocery. Many a girl would be saved from frivolous, misleading\nassociations. The influence of the home would be to parents and\nchildren what God designed it should be, a lifelong blessing.15\nMarried life is not all romance; it has its real difficulties and\nits homely details. The wife must not consider herself a doll, to\nbe tended, but a woman; one to put her shoulder under real, not\nimaginary, burdens, and live an understanding, thoughtful life, con- [111]\nsidering that there are other things to be thought of than herself....\nReal life has its shadows and its sorrows. To every soul troubles\nmust come. Satan is constantly working to unsettle the faith and\ndestroy the courage and hope of every one.16\nCounsel to an Unhappy Couple\u2014Your married life has been\nvery much like a desert\u2014but very few green spots to look back upon\nwith grateful remembrance. It need not have been thus.\nLove can no more exist without revealing itself in outward acts\nthan fire can be kept alive without fuel. You, Brother C, have felt\nthat it was beneath your dignity to manifest tenderness by kindly\nacts and to watch for an opportunity to evince affection for your wife\nby words of tenderness and kind regard. You are changeable in your\nfeelings and are very much affected by surrounding circumstances....\nLeave your business cares and perplexities and annoyances when\nyou leave your business. Come to your family with a cheerful\ncountenance, with sympathy, tenderness, and love. This will be\nbetter than expending money for medicines or physicians for your\nwife. It will be health to the body and strength to the soul. Your\nlives have been very wretched. You have both acted a part in making\nthem so. God is not pleased with your misery; you have brought it\nupon yourselves by want of self-control.\nYou let feelings bear sway. You think it beneath your dignity,\nBrother C, to manifest love, to speak kindly and affectionately. All\n84 The Adventist Home\nthese tender words, you think, savor of softness and weakness, and\nare unnecessary. But in their place come fretful words, words of\ndiscord, strife, and censure....\nYou have not the elements of a contented spirit. You dwell upon[112]\nyour troubles; imaginary want and poverty far ahead stare you in\nthe face; you feel afflicted, distressed, agonized; your brain seems\non fire, your spirits depressed. You do not cherish love to God and\ngratitude of heart for all the blessings which your kind heavenly\nFather has bestowed upon you. You see only the discomforts of life.\nA worldly insanity shuts you in like heavy clouds of thick darkness.\nSatan exults over you because you will have misery when peace and\nhappiness are at your command.17\nMutual Love and Forbearance Rewarded\u2014Without mutual\nforbearance and love no earthly power can hold you and your hus-\nband in the bonds of Christian unity. Your companionship in the\nmarriage relation should be close and tender, holy and elevated,\nbreathing a spiritual power into your lives, that you may be every-\nthing to each other that God\u2019s word requires. When you reach the\ncondition that the Lord desires you to reach, you will find heaven\nbelow and God in your life.18\nRemember, my dear brother and sister, that God is love and that\nby His grace you can succeed in making each other happy, as in your\nmarriage pledge you promised to do.19\nMen and women can reach God\u2019s ideal for them if they will take\nChrist as their helper. What human wisdom cannot do, His grace\nwill accomplish for those who give themselves to Him in loving\ntrust. His providence can unite hearts in bonds that are of heavenly\norigin. Love will not be a mere exchange of soft and flattering words.\nThe loom of heaven weaves with warp and woof finer, yet more firm,\nthan can be woven by the looms of earth. The result is not a tissue\nfabric, but a texture that will bear wear and test and trial. Heart will[113]\nbe bound to heart in the golden bonds of a love that is enduring.20\n1Testimonies for the Church 7:45.\n2The Ministry of Healing, 359, 360.\n3Ibid., 360.\n4Testimonies for the Church 7:46.\n5The Ministry of Healing, 360.\n6The Review and Herald, February 2, 1886.\nHappy, Successful Partnership 85\n7Letter 18a, 1891.\n8Testimonies for the Church 7:47.\n9The Ministry of Healing, 360, 361.\n10Testimonies for the Church 3:539.\n11Ibid., 4:621, 622.\n12Ibid., 2:133, 134.\n13Ibid., 2:417, 418.\n14Letter 10, 1889.\n15The Ministry of Healing, 294.\n16Letter 34, 1890.\n17Testimonies for the Church 1:695-697.\n18Letter 18a, 1891.\n19Testimonies for the Church 7:49.\n20The Ministry of Healing, 362.\nChapter 17\u2014Mutual Obligations[114]\nEach Has Individual Responsibilities \u2014The two who unite\ntheir interest in life will have distinct characteristics and individual\nresponsibilities. Each one will have his or her work, but women are\nnot to be valued by the amount of work they can do as are beasts of\nburden. The wife is to grace the family circle as a wife and compan-\nion to a wise husband. At every step she should inquire, \u201cIs this the\nstandard of true womanhood?\u201d and, \u201cHow shall I make my influence\nChristlike in my home?\u201d The husband should let his wife know that\nhe appreciates her work.1\nThe wife is to respect her husband. The husband is to love and\ncherish his wife; and as their marriage vow unites them as one, so\ntheir belief in Christ should make them one in Him. What can be\nmore pleasing to God than to see those who enter into the marriage\nrelation seek together to learn of Jesus and to become more and\nmore imbued with His Spirit?2\nYou now have duties to perform that before your marriage you\ndid not have. \u201cPut on therefore, ... kindness, humbleness of mind,\nmeekness, longsuffering.\u201d \u201cWalk in love, as Christ also hath loved\nus.\u201d Give careful study to the following instruction: \u201cWives, submit\nyourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the\nhusband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the\nchurch.... Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the\nwives be to their own husbands in every thing. Husbands, love your\nwives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself for\nit.\u201d3\nGod\u2019s Instruction to Eve\u2014Eve was told of the sorrow and pain[115]\nthat must henceforth be her portion. And the Lord said, \u201cThy desire\nshall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\u201d In the creation,\nGod had made her the equal of Adam. Had they remained obedient\nto God\u2014in harmony with His great law of love\u2014they would ever\nhave been in harmony with each other; but sin had brought discord,\nand now their union could be maintained and harmony preserved\n86\nMutual Obligations 87\nonly by submission on the part of the one or the other. Eve had\nbeen the first in transgression; and she had fallen into temptation by\nseparating from her companion, contrary to the divine direction. It\nwas by her solicitation that Adam sinned, and she was now placed in\nsubjection to her husband. Had the principles enjoined in the law of\nGod been cherished by the fallen race, this sentence, though growing\nout of the results of sin, would have proved a blessing to them; but\nman\u2019s abuse of the supremacy thus given him has too often rendered\nthe lot of woman very bitter, and made her life a burden.\nEve had been perfectly happy by her husband\u2019s side in her Eden\nhome; but, like restless modern Eves, she was flattered with the hope\nof entering a higher sphere than that which God had assigned her.\nIn attempting to rise above her original position, she fell far below\nit. A similar result will be reached by all who are unwilling to take\nup cheerfully their life duties in accordance with God\u2019s plan.4\nWives Submit; Husbands Love\u2014The question is often asked,\n\u201cShall a wife have no will of her own?\u201d The Bible plainly states that\nthe husband is the head of the family. \u201cWives, submit yourselves\nunto your own husbands.\u201d If this injunction ended here, we might say\nthat the position of the wife is not an enviable one; it is a very hard [116]\nand trying position in very many cases, and it would be better were\nthere fewer marriages. Many husbands stop at the words, \u201cWives,\nsubmit yourselves,\u201d but we will read the conclusion of the same\ninjunction, which is. \u201cAs it is fit in the Lord.\u201d\nGod requires that the wife shall keep the fear and glory of God\never before her. Entire submission is to be made only to the Lord\nJesus Christ, who has purchased her as His own child by the infinite\nprice of His life. God has given her a conscience, which she cannot\nviolate with impunity. Her individuality cannot be merged into that\nof her husband, for she is the purchase of Christ. It is a mistake to\nimagine that with blind devotion she is to do exactly as her husband\nsays in all things, when she knows that in so doing, injury would\nbe worked for her body and her spirit, which have been ransomed\nfrom the slavery of Satan. There is One who stands higher than the\nhusband to the wife; it is her Redeemer, and her submission to her\nhusband is to be rendered as God has directed\u2014\u201cas it is fit in the\nLord.\u201d\n88 The Adventist Home\nWhen husbands require the complete subjection of their wives,\ndeclaring that women have no voice or will in the family, but must\nrender entire submission, they place their wives in a position contrary\nto the Scripture. In interpreting the Scripture in this way, they do\nviolence to the design of the marriage institution. This interpretation\nis made simply that they may exercise arbitrary rule, which is not\ntheir prerogative. But we read on, \u201cHusbands, love your wives, and\nbe not bitter against them.\u201d Why should the husband be bitter against\nhis wife? If the husband has found her erring and full of faults,\nbitterness of spirit will not remedy the evil.5\nWives Subject Only As Husbands Are Subject to Christ \u2014[117]\nThe Lord Jesus has not been correctly represented in His relation to\nthe church by many husbands in their relation to their wives, for they\ndo not keep the way of the Lord. They declare that their wives must\nbe subject to them in everything. But it was not the design of God\nthat the husband should have control, as head of the house, when\nhe himself does not submit to Christ. He must be under the rule of\nChrist that he may represent the relation of Christ to the church. If\nhe is a coarse, rough, boisterous, egotistical, harsh, and overbearing\nman, let him never utter the word that the husband is the head of the\nwife, and that she must submit to him in everything; for he is not the\nLord, he is not the husband in the true significance of the term....\nHusbands should study the pattern and seek to know what is\nmeant by the symbol presented in Ephesians, the relation Christ\nsustains to the church. The husband is to be as a Saviour in his\nfamily. Will he stand in his noble, God-given manhood, ever seeking\nto uplift his wife and children? Will he breathe about him a pure,\nsweet atmosphere? Will he not as assiduously cultivate the love of\nJesus, making it an abiding principle in his home, as he will assert\nhis claims to authority?\nLet every husband and father study to understand the words\nof Christ, not in a one-sided manner, merely dwelling upon the\nsubjection of the wife to her husband, but in the light of the cross of\nCalvary, study as to his own position in the family circle. \u201cHusbands,\nlove your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave\nHimself for it; that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing\nof water by the word.\u201d Jesus gave Himself up to die upon the cross\nin order that He might cleanse and keep us from all sin and pollution[118]\nMutual Obligations 89\nby the influence of the Holy Spirit.6\nMutual Forbearance Is Needed\u2014We must have the Spirit of\nGod, or we can never have harmony in the home. The wife, if she\nhas the spirit of Christ, will be careful of her words; she will control\nher spirit, she will be submissive, and yet will not feel that she is\na bondslave, but a companion to her husband. If the husband is\na servant of God, he will not lord it over his wife; he will not be\narbitrary and exacting. We cannot cherish home affection with too\nmuch care; for the home, if the Spirit of the Lord dwells there, is\na type of heaven.... If one errs, the other will exercise Christlike\nforbearance and not draw coldly away.7\nNeither the husband nor the wife should attempt to exercise over\nthe other an arbitrary control. Do not try to compel each other to\nyield to your wishes. You cannot do this and retain each other\u2019s love.\nBe kind, patient, and forbearing, considerate, and courteous. By the\ngrace of God you can succeed in making each other happy, as in\nyour marriage vow you promised to do.8\nLet Each Graciously Yield \u2014In the married life men and\nwomen sometimes act like undisciplined, perverse children. The\nhusband wants his way, and the wife wants her way, and neither\nis willing to yield. Such a condition of things can bring only the\ngreatest unhappiness. Both husband and wife should be willing to\nyield his or her way or opinion. There is no possibility of happiness\nwhile they both persists in doing as they please.9\nUnless men and women have learned of Christ, His meekness\nand lowliness, they will reveal the impulsive, unreasonable spirit so\noften revealed by children. The strong, undisciplined will will seek\nto rule. Such ones need to study the words of Paul: \u201cWhen I was a [119]\nchild, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child:\nbut when I became a man, I put away childish things.\u201d10\nAdjusting Family Difficulties \u2014It is a hard matter to adjust\nfamily difficulties, even when husband and wife seek to make a\nfair and just settlement in regard to their several duties, if they have\nfailed to submit the heart to God. How can husband and wife divide\nthe interests of their home life and still keep a loving, firm hold upon\neach other? They should have a united interest in all that concerns\ntheir homemaking, and the wife, if a Christian, will have her interest\n90 The Adventist Home\nwith her husband as his companion; for the husband is to stand as\nthe head of the household.11\nCounsel to Discordant Families\u2014Your spirit is wrong. When\nyou take a position, you do not weigh the matter well and consider\nwhat must be the effect of your maintaining your views and in an in-\ndependent manner weaving them into your prayers and conversation,\nwhen you know that your wife does not hold the same views that\nyou do. Instead of respecting the feelings of your wife and kindly\navoiding, as a gentleman would, those subjects upon which you\nknow you differ, you have been forward to dwell upon objectionable\npoints, and have manifested a persistency in expressing your views\nregardless of any around you. You have felt that others had no right\nto see matters differently from yourself. These fruits do not grow\nupon the Christian tree.12\nMy brother, my sister, open the door of the heart to receive Jesus.\nInvite him into the soul-temple. Help each other to overcome the\nobstacles which enter the married life of all. You will have a fierce\nconflict to overcome your adversary the devil, and if you expect[120]\nGod to help you in this battle, you must both unite in deciding to\novercome, to seal your lips against speaking any words of wrong,\neven if you have to fall upon your knees and cry aloud, \u201cLord, rebuke\nthe adversary of my soul.\u201d13\nChrist in Each Heart Will Bring Unity\u2014If the will of God is\nfulfilled, the husband and wife will respect each other and cultivate\nlove and confidence. Anything that would mar the peace and unity of\nthe family should be firmly repressed, and kindness and love should\nbe cherished. He who manifests the spirit of tenderness, forbearance,\nand love will find that the same spirit will be reflected upon him.\nWhere the Spirit of God reigns, there will be no talk of unsuitability\nin the marriage relation. If Christ indeed is formed within, the hope\nof glory, there will be union and love in the home. Christ abiding in\nthe heart of the wife will be at agreement with Christ abiding in the\nheart of the husband. They will be striving together for the mansions\nChrist has gone to prepare for those who love Him.14\nMutual Obligations 91\n1Manuscript 17, 1891.\n2Manuscript 36, 1899.\n3Testimonies for the Church 7:46.\n4Patriarchs and Prophets, 58, 59.\n5Letter 18, 1891\n6Manuscript 17, 1891.\n7Letter 18, 1891.\n8The Ministry of Healing, 361.\n9Manuscript 31, 1911.\n10Letter 55, 1902.\n11Manuscript 31, 1911.\n12Testimonies for the Church 2:418.\n13Letter 105, 1893.\n14The Signs of the Times, November 14, 1892.\nChapter 18\u2014Marital Duties and Privileges[121]\nJesus Did Not Enforce Celibacy\u2014Those who regard the mar-\nriage relation as one of God\u2019s sacred ordinances, guarded by His\nholy precept, will be controlled by the dictates of reason.1\nJesus did not enforce celibacy upon any class of men. He came\nnot to destroy the sacred relationship of marriage, but to exalt it and\nrestore it to its original sanctity. He looks with pleasure upon the\nfamily relationship where sacred and unselfish love bears sway.2\nMarriage Is Lawful and Holy \u2014There is in itself no sin in\neating and drinking, or in marrying and giving in marriage. It was\nlawful to marry in the time of Noah, and it is lawful to marry now,\nif that which is lawful is properly treated and not carried to sinful\nexcess. But in the days of Noah men married without consulting\nGod or seeking His guidance and counsel....\nThe fact that all the relations of life are of a transitory nature\nshould have a modifying influence on all we do and say. In Noah\u2019s\nday it was the inordinate, excessive love of that which in itself was\nlawful, when properly used, that made marriage sinful before God.\nThere are many who are losing their souls in this age of the world by\nbecoming absorbed in the thoughts of marriage and in the marriage\nrelation itself.3\nThe marriage relation is holy, but in this degenerate age it covers\nvileness of every description. It is abused and has become a crime\nwhich now constitutes one of the signs of the last days, even as[122]\nmarriages, managed as they were previous to the Flood, were then\na crime.... When the sacred nature and the claims of marriage are\nunderstood, it will even now be approved of Heaven; and the result\nwill be happiness to both parties, and God will be glorified.4\nThe Privileges of the Marriage Relation \u2014Those professing\nto be Christians ... should duly consider the result of every privilege\n[Note: On another occasion Mrs. White speaks of the \u201cPrivacy And\nPrivileges Of The Family Relation.\u201d See Testimonies for the Church\n92\nMarital Duties and Privileges 93\n2:90.\u2014Compilers.] of the marriage relation, and sanctified principle\nshould be the basis of every action.5\nIn very many cases the parents ... have abused their marriage\nprivileges, and by indulgence have strengthened their animal pas-\nsions.6\nDuty to Avoid Excesses\u2014It is carrying that which is lawful to\nexcess that makes it a grievous sin.7\nMany parents do not obtain the knowledge that they should in\nthe married life. They are not guarded lest Satan take advantage of\nthem and control their minds and their lives. They do not see that\nGod requires them to control their married lives from any excesses.\nBut very few feel it to be a religious duty to govern their passions.\nThey have united themselves in marriage to the object of their choice\nand, therefore, reason that marriage sanctifies the indulgence of the\nbaser passions. Even men and women professing godliness give\nloose rein to their lustful passions and have no thought that God\nholds them accountable for the expenditure of vital energy, which\nweakens their hold on life and enervates the entire system.8\nLet Self-denial and Temperance Be the Watchword \u2014Oh, [123]\nthat I could make all understand their obligation to God to preserve\nthe mental and physical organism in the best condition to render\nperfect service to their Maker! Let the Christian wife refrain, both\nin word and act, from exciting the animal passions of her husband.\nMany have no strength at all to waste in this direction. From their\nyouth up they have weakened the brain and sapped the constitution\nby the gratification of animal passions. Self-denial and temperance\nshould be the watchword in their married life.9\nWe are under solemn obligations to God to keep the spirit pure\nand the body healthy, that we may be a benefit to humanity and\nrender to God perfect service. The apostle utters these words of\nwarning: \u201cLet not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye\nshould obey it in the lusts thereof.\u201d He urges us onward by telling\nus that \u201cevery man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all\nthings.\u201d He exhorts all who call themselves Christians to present\ntheir bodies \u201ca living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.\u201d He says:\n\u201cI keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by\nany means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a\ncastaway.\u201d10\n94 The Adventist Home\nIt is not pure love which actuates a man to make his wife an\ninstrument to minister to his lust. It is the animal passions which\nclamor for indulgence. How few men show their love in the manner\nspecified by the apostle: \u201cEven as Christ also loved the church, and\ngave Himself for it; that He might [not pollute it, but] sanctify and\ncleanse it; ... that it should be holy and without blemish.\u201d This is\nthe quality of love in the marriage relation which God recognizes as\nholy. Love is a pure and holy principle, but lustful passion will not\nadmit of restraint and will not be dictated to or controlled by reason.[124]\nIt is blind to consequences; it will not reason from cause to effect.11\nWhy Satan Seeks to Weaken Self-control \u2014Satan seeks to\nlower the standard of purity and to weaken the self-control of those\nwho enter the marriage relation, because he knows that while the\nbaser passions are in the ascendancy, the moral powers grow steadily\nweaker, and he need have no concern as to their spiritual growth.\nHe knows, too, that in no way can he better stamp his own hateful\nimage upon their offspring, and that he can thus mold their character\neven more readily than he can the character of the parents.12\nResults of Excesses\u2014Men and women, you will one day learn\nwhat is lust and the result of its gratification. Passion of just as base\na quality may be found in the marriage relation as outside of it.13\nWhat is the result of giving loose rein to the lower passions?\n... The bedchamber, where angels of God should preside, is made\nunholy by unholy practices. And because shameful animalism rules,\nbodies are corrupted; loathsome practices lead to loathsome diseases.\nThat which God has given as a blessing is made a curse.14\nSexual excess will effectually destroy a love for devotional exer-\ncises, will take from the brain the substance needed to nourish the\nsystem, and will most effectively exhaust the vitality. No woman\nshould aid her husband in this work of self-destruction. She will not\ndo it if she is enlightened and has true love for him.\nThe more the animal passions are indulged, the stronger do they\nbecome, and the more violent will be their clamors for indulgence.[125]\nLet God-fearing men and women awake to their duty. Many pro-\nfessed Christians are suffering with paralysis of nerve and brain\nbecause of their intemperance in this direction.15\nHusbands to Be Considerate \u2014Husbands should be careful,\nattentive, constant, faithful, and compassionate. They should man-\nMarital Duties and Privileges 95\nifest love and sympathy. If they fulfill the words of Christ, their\nlove will not be of a base, earthly, sensual character that will lead\nto the destruction of their own bodies and bring upon their wives\ndebility and disease. They will not indulge in the gratification of\nbase passions, while ringing in the ears of their wives that they must\nbe subject to the husband in everything. When the husband has the\nnobility of character, purity of heart, elevation of mind that every\ntrue Christian must possess, it will be made manifest in the marriage\nrelation. If he has the mind of Christ, he will not be a destroyer of\nthe body, but will be full of tender love, seeking to reach the highest\nstandard in Christ.16\nWhen Doubts Creep In\u2014No man can truly love his wife when\nshe will patiently submit to become his slave and minister to his\ndepraved passions. In her passive submission she loses the value\nshe once possessed in his eyes. He sees her dragged down from\neverything elevating to a low level, and soon he suspects that she\nwill as tamely submit to be degraded by another as by himself. He\ndoubts her constancy and purity, tires of her, and seeks new objects\nto arouse and intensify his hellish passions. The law of God is not\nregarded. These men are worse than brutes; they are demons in\nhuman form. They are unacquainted with the elevating, ennobling\nprinciples of true, sanctified love.\nThe wife also becomes jealous of the husband and suspects that [126]\nif opportunity should offer, he would just as readily pay his addresses\nto another as to her. She sees that he is not controlled by conscience\nor the fear of God; all these sanctified barriers are broken down\nby lustful passions; all that is Godlike in the husband is made the\nservant of low, brutish lust.17\nThe Problem of Unreasonable Demands \u2014The matter now\nto be settled is: Shall the wife feel bound to yield implicitly to the\ndemands of her husband when she sees that nothing but base passions\ncontrol him, and when her reason and judgment are convinced that\nshe does it to the injury of her body, which God has enjoined upon\nher to possess in sanctification and honor, to preserve as a living\nsacrifice to God?\nIt is not pure, holy love which leads the wife to gratify the animal\npropensities of her husband at the expense of health and life. If she\npossesses true love and wisdom, she will seek to divert his mind\n96 The Adventist Home\nfrom the gratification of lustful passions to high and spiritual themes\nby dwelling upon interesting spiritual subjects. It may be necessary\nto humbly and affectionately urge, even at the risk of his displeasure,\nthat she cannot debase her body by yielding to sexual excess. She\nshould, in a tender, kind manner, remind him that God has the\nfirst and highest claim upon her entire being, and that she cannot\ndisregard this claim, for she will be held accountable in the great\nday of God....\nIf she will elevate her affections, and in sanctification and honor\npreserve her refined, womanly dignity, woman can do much by her\njudicious influence to sanctify her husband, and thus fulfill her high\nmission. In so doing she can save both her husband and herself, thus\nperforming a double work. In this matter, so delicate and so difficult[127]\nto manage, much wisdom and patience are necessary, as well as\nmoral courage and fortitude. Strength and grace can be found in\nprayer. Sincere love is to be the ruling principle of the heart. Love\nto God and love to the husband can alone be the right ground of\naction....\nWhen the wife yields her body and mind to the control of her\nhusband, being passive to his will in all things, sacrificing her con-\nscience, her dignity, and even her identity, she loses the opportunity\nof exerting that mighty influence for good which she should possess\nto elevate her husband. She could soften his stern nature, and her\nsanctifying influence could be exerted in a manner to refine and\npurify, leading him to strive earnestly to govern his passions and\nbe more spiritually minded, that they might be partakers together\nof the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the\nworld through lust. The power of influence can be great to lead the\nmind to high and noble themes, above the low, sensual indulgences\nfor which the heart unrenewed by grace naturally seeks. If the wife\nfeels that in order to please her husband she must come down to\nhis standard, when animal passion is the principal basis of his love\nand controls his actions, she displeases God; for she fails to exert a\nsanctifying influence upon her husband. If she feels that she must\nsubmit to his animal passions without a word of remonstrance, she\ndoes not understand her duty to him nor to her God.18\nOur Bodies a Purchased Possession\u2014The lower passions have\ntheir seat in the body and work through it. The words \u201cflesh\u201d or\nMarital Duties and Privileges 97\n\u201cfleshly\u201d or \u201ccarnal lusts\u201d embrace the lower, corrupt nature; the flesh\nof itself cannot act contrary to the will of God. We are commanded\nto crucify the flesh, with the affections and lusts. How shall we do it? [128]\nShall we inflict pain on the body? No; but put to death the temptation\nto sin. The corrupt thought is to be expelled. Every thought is to be\nbrought into captivity to Jesus Christ. All animal propensities are to\nbe subjected to the higher powers of the soul. The love of God must\nreign supreme; Christ must occupy an undivided throne. Our bodies\nare to be regarded as His purchased possession. The members of the\nbody are to become the instruments of righteousness.19\n1A Solemn Appeal, 139.\n2Manuscript 126, 1903.\n3The Review and Herald, September 25, 1888.\n4Testimonies for the Church 2:252.\n5Ibid., 2:380.\n6Ibid., 2:391.\n7Testimonies for the Church 4:505.\n8Testimonies for the Church 2:472.\n9Testimonies for the Church 2:477, 478.\n10Testimonies for the Church 2:381.\n11Testimonies for the Church 2:473.\n12Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 130.\n13Testimonies for the Church 2:473.\n14Manuscript 1, 1888.\n15Testimonies for the Church 2:477.\n16Manuscript 17, 1891.\n17Testimonies for the Church 2:474, 475.\n18Ibid., 2:475-477.\n19Manuscript 1, 1888.\n98 The Adventist Home\nSection 6\u2014The New Home [129]\nChapter 19\u2014Where Shall the Home Be?[130]\n[131]\nGuiding Principles in Choosing the Location \u2014In choosing\na home, God would have us consider, first of all, the moral and\nreligious influences that will surround us and our families.1\nWe should choose the society most favorable to our spiritual\nadvancement, and avail ourselves of every help within our reach;\nfor Satan will oppose many hindrances to make our progress toward\nheaven as difficult as possible. We may be placed in trying positions,\nfor many cannot have their surroundings what they would; but we\nshould not voluntarily expose ourselves to influences that are unfa-\nvorable to the formation of Christian character. When duty calls us\nto do this, we should be doubly watchful and prayerful, that, through\nthe grace of Christ, we may stand uncorrupted.2\nThe gospel ... teaches us to estimate things at their true value,\nand to give the most effort to the things of greatest worth\u2014the things\nthat will endure. This lesson is needed by those upon whom rests the\nresponsibility of selecting a home. They should not allow themselves\nto be diverted from the highest aim....\nAs the location for a home is sought, let this purpose direct the\nchoice. Be not controlled by the desire for wealth, the dictates of\nfashion, or the customs of society. Consider what will tend most to\nsimplicity, purity, health, and real worth....\nInstead of dwelling where only the works of men can be seen,\nwhere the sights and sounds frequently suggest thoughts of evil,\nwhere turmoil and confusion bring weariness and disquietude, go\nwhere you can look upon the works of God. Find rest of spirit in the[132]\nbeauty and quietude and peace of nature. Let the eye rest on the green\nfields, the groves, and the hills. Look up to the blue sky, unobscured\nby the city\u2019s dust and smoke, and breathe the invigorating air of\nheaven.3\nThe First Home a Model\u2014The home of our first parents was\nto be a pattern for other homes as their children should go forth\nto occupy the earth. That home, beautified by the hand of God\n100\nWhere Shall the Home Be? 101\nHimself, was not a gorgeous palace. Men, in their pride, delight in\nmagnificent and costly edifices, and glory in the works of their own\nhands: but God placed Adam in a garden. This was his dwelling.\nThe blue heavens were its dome; the earth, with its delicate flowers\nand carpet of living green, was its floor; and the leafy branches of\nthe goodly trees were its canopy. Its walls were hung with the most\nmagnificent adornings\u2014the handiwork of the great Master Artist. In\nthe surroundings of the holy pair was a lesson for all time\u2014that true\nhappiness is found, not in the indulgence of pride and luxury, but in\ncommunion with God through His created works. If men would give\nless attention to the artificial and would cultivate greater simplicity,\nthey would come far nearer to answering the purpose of God in their\ncreation. Pride and ambition are never satisfied, but those who are\ntruly wise will find substantial and elevating pleasure in the sources\nof enjoyment that God has placed within the reach of all.4\nGod\u2019s Choice of an Earthly Home for His Son\u2014Jesus came\nto this earth to accomplish the greatest work ever accomplished\namong men. He came as God\u2019s ambassador, to show us how to live\nso as to secure life\u2019s best results. What were the conditions chosen\nby the Infinite Father for His Son? A secluded home in the Galilean [133]\nhills; a household sustained by honest, self-respecting labor; a life of\nsimplicity; daily conflict with difficulty and hardship; self-sacrifice,\neconomy, and patient, gladsome service; the hour of study at His\nmother\u2019s side, with the open scroll of Scripture; the quiet of dawn\nor twilight in the green valley; the holy ministries of nature; the\nstudy of creation and providence; and the soul\u2019s communion with\nGod\u2014these were the conditions and opportunities of the early life\nof Jesus.5\nRural Homes in the Promised Land \u2014In the Promised Land\nthe discipline begun in the wilderness was continued under circum-\nstances favorable to the formation of right habits. The people were\nnot crowded together in cities, but each family had its own landed\npossession, ensuring to all the health-giving blessings of a natural,\nunperverted life.6\nEffect of Environment on the Character of John \u2014John the\nBaptist, the forerunner of Christ, received his early training from his\nparents. The greater portion of his life was spent in the wilderness....\nIt was John\u2019s choice to forego the enjoyments and luxuries of city\n102 The Adventist Home\nlife for the stern discipline of the wilderness. Here his surroundings\nwere favorable to habits of simplicity and self-denial. Uninterrupted\nby the clamor of the world, he could here study the lessons of nature,\nof revelation, and of providence.... From his childhood his mission\nhad been kept before him, and he accepted the holy trust. To him\nthe solitude of the desert was a welcome escape from the society\nin which suspicion, unbelief, and impurity had become well-nigh\nall-pervading. He distrusted his own power to withstand temptation\nand shrank from constant contact with sin lest he should lose the[134]\nsense of its exceeding sinfulness.7\nOther Worthies Reared in Country Homes \u2014So with the\ngreat majority of the best and noblest men of all ages. Read the\nhistory of Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph; of Moses, David, and Elisha.\nStudy the lives of men of later times who have most worthily filled\npositions of trust and responsibility.\nHow many of these were reared in country homes. They knew\nlittle of luxury. They did not spend their youth in amusement. Many\nwere forced to struggle with poverty and hardship. They early\nlearned to work, and their active life in the open air gave vigor\nand elasticity to all their faculties. Forced to depend upon their own\nresources, they learned to combat difficulties and to surmount obsta-\ncles, and they gained courage and perseverance. They learned the\nlessons of self-reliance and self-control. Sheltered in a great degree\nfrom evil associations, they were satisfied with natural pleasures and\nwholesome companionships. They were simple in their tastes and\ntemperate in their habits. They were governed by principle, and they\ngrew up pure and strong and true. When called to their lifework,\nthey brought to it physical and mental power, buoyancy of spirit,\nability to plan and execute, and steadfastness in resisting evil that\nmade them a positive power for good in the world.8\n1Patriarchs and Prophets, 169.\n2Messages to Young People, 419.\n3The Ministry of Healing, 363, 366, 367.\n4Patriarchs and Prophets, 49, 50.\n5The Ministry of Healing, 365, 366.\n6Ibid., 280.\n7Testimonies for the Church 8:221.\n8The Ministry of Healing, 366.\nChapter 20\u2014The Family and the City [135]\nHazards of City Life\u2014Life in the cities is false and artificial.\nThe intense passion for money getting, the whirl of excitement and\npleasure seeking, the thirst for display, the luxury and extravagance\u2014\nall are forces that, with the great masses of mankind, are turning\nthe mind from life\u2019s true purpose. They are opening the door to a\nthousand evils. Upon the youth they have almost irresistible power.\nOne of the most subtle and dangerous temptations that assails the\nchildren and youth in the cities is the love of pleasure. Holidays are\nnumerous; games and horse racing draw thousands, and the whirl of\nexcitement and pleasure attracts them away from the sober duties of\nlife. Money that should have been saved for better uses is frittered\naway for amusements.1\nConsider the Health Standpoint\u2014The physical surroundings\nin the cities are often a peril to health. The constant liability to\ncontact with disease, the prevalence of foul air, impure water, impure\nfood, the crowded, dark, unhealthful dwellings, are some of the many\nevils to be met.\nIt was not God\u2019s purpose that people should be crowded into\ncities, huddled together in terraces and tenements. In the beginning\nHe placed our first parents amidst the beautiful sights and sounds\nHe desires us to rejoice in today. The more nearly we come into\nharmony with God\u2019s original plan, the more favorable will be our\nposition to secure health of body and mind and soul.2\nHotbeds of Iniquity\u2014The cities are filled with temptation. We [136]\nshould plan our work in such a way as to keep our young people as\nfar as possible from this contamination.3\nThe children and youth should be carefully guarded. They should\nbe kept away from the hotbeds of iniquity that are to be found in our\ncities.4\nTurmoil and Confusion\u2014It is not God\u2019s will that His people\nshall settle in the cities, where there is constant turmoil and confu-\n103\n104 The Adventist Home\nsion. Their children should be spared this, for the whole system is\ndemoralized by the hurry and rush and noise.5\nLabor Troubles\u2014Through the working of trusts and the results\nof labor unions and strikes, the conditions of life in the city are\nconstantly becoming more and more difficult. Serious troubles are\nbefore us, and for many families removal from the cities will become\na necessity.6\nImpending Destruction\u2014The time is near when large cities\nwill be swept away, and all should be warned of these coming judg-\nments.7\nOh, that God\u2019s people had a sense of the impending destruction\nof thousands of cities now almost given to idolatry!8\nFor Worldly Interests and Love of Gain\u2014It is often the case\nthat parents are not careful to surround their children with right\ninfluences. In choosing a home, they think more of their worldly\ninterests than of the moral and social atmosphere, and the children\nform associations that are unfavorable to the development of piety\nand the formation of right characters....\nParents who denounce the Canaanites for offering their children[137]\nto Moloch, what are you doing? You are making a most costly\noffering to your mammon god, and then, when your children grow\nup unloved and unlovely in character, when they show decided\nimpiety and a tendency to infidelity, you blame the faith you profess\nbecause it was unable to save them. You are reaping that which\nyou have sown\u2014the result of your selfish love of the world and\nneglect of the means of grace. You moved your families into places\nof temptation; and the ark of God, your glory and defense, you did\nnot consider essential; and the Lord has not worked a miracle to\ndeliver your children from temptation.9\nCities Offer No Real Benefit \u2014There is not one family in a\nhundred who will be improved physically, mentally, or spiritually\nby residing in the city. Faith, hope, love, happiness, can far better be\ngained in retired places, where there are fields and hills and trees.\nTake your children away from the sights and sounds of the city, away\nfrom the rattle and din of streetcars and teams, and their minds will\nbecome more healthy. It will be found easier to bring home to their\nhearts the truth of the word of God.10\nFamily and the City 105\nCounsel on Moving From Rural to City Areas \u2014Many par-\nents remove from their country homes to the city, regarding it as a\nmore desirable or profitable location. But by making this change,\nthey expose their children to many and great temptations. The boys\nhave no employment, and they obtain a street education and go on\nfrom one step in depravity to another, until they lose all interest\nin anything that is good and pure and holy. How much better had\nthe parents remained with their families in the country, where the [138]\ninfluences are most favorable for physical and mental strength. Let\nthe youth be taught to labor in tilling the soil, and let them sleep the\nsweet sleep of weariness and innocence.\nThrough the neglect of parents, the youth in our cities are corrupt-\ning their ways and polluting their souls before God. This will ever\nbe the fruit of idleness. The almshouses, the prisons, and the gallows\npublish the sorrowful tale of the neglected duties of parents.11\nBetter sacrifice any and every worldly consideration than to\nimperil the precious souls committed to your care. They will be\nassailed by temptations and should be taught to meet them; but it\nis your duty to cut off every influence, to break up every habit, to\nsunder every tie, that keeps you from the most free, open, and hearty\ncommittal of yourselves and your family to God.\nInstead of the crowded city seek some retired situation where\nyour children will be, so far as possible, shielded from temptation,\nand there train and educate them for usefulness. The prophet Ezekiel\nthus enumerates the causes that led to Sodom\u2019s sin and destruction:\n\u201cPride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and\nin her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and\nneedy.\u201d All who would escape the doom of Sodom must shun the\ncourse that brought God\u2019s judgments upon that wicked city.12\nWhen Lot entered Sodom, he fully intended to keep himself\nfree from iniquity and to command his household after him. But he\nsignally failed. The corrupting influences about him had an effect\nupon his own faith, and his children\u2019s connection with the inhabitants\nof Sodom bound up his interest in a measure with theirs. The result\nis before us. Many are still making a similar mistake.13\nLet it be your study to select and make your homes as far from [139]\nSodom and Gomorrah as you can. Keep out of the large cities. If\npossible make your homes in the quiet retirement of the country,\n106 The Adventist Home\neven if you can never become wealthy by so doing. Locate where\nthere is the best influence.14\nI am instructed by the Lord to warn our people not to flock to the\ncities to find homes for their families. To fathers and to mothers I\nam instructed to say, Fail not to keep your children within your own\npremises.15\nTime Now to Move From the Cities\u2014Take your families away\nfrom the cities is my message.16\nThe time has come when, as God opens the way, families should\nmove out of the cities. The children should be taken into the country.\nThe parents should get as suitable a place as their means will allow.\nThough the dwelling may be small, yet there should be land in\nconnection with it that may be cultivated.17\nBefore the overflowing scourge shall come upon the dwellers of\nthe earth, the Lord calls upon all who are Israelites indeed to prepare\nfor that event. To parents He sends the warning cry: Gather your\nchildren into your own houses; gather them away from those who\nare disregarding the commandments of God, who are teaching and\npracticing evil. Get out of the large cities as fast as possible.18\nGod Will Help His People\u2014Parents can secure small homes in\nthe country, with land for cultivation, where they can have orchards\nand where they can raise vegetables and small fruits to take the\nplace of flesh meat, which is so corrupting to the lifeblood coursing\nthrough the veins. On such places the children will not be surrounded[140]\nwith the corrupting influences of city life. God will help His people\nto find such homes outside of the cities.19\n1The Ministry of Healing, 364.\n2Ibid., 365.\n3Country Living, 30.\n4Ibid., 12.\n5Ibid., 29.\n6The Ministry of Healing, 364.\n7Evangelism, 29.\n8The Review and Herald, September 10, 1903.\n9Testimonies for the Church 5:320.\n10Country Living, 13.\n11The Review and Herald, September 13, 1881\n12Testimonies for the Church 5:232, 233.\n13Patriarchs and Prophets, 168.\nFamily and the City 107\n14Manuscript 57, 1897.\n15Country Living, 12, 13.\n16Ibid., 29.\n17Ibid., 24.\n18Testimonies for the Church 6:195.\n19Medical Ministry, 310.\nChapter 21\u2014Advantages of the Country[141]\nWith a Piece of Land and a Comfortable Home\u2014Whenever\npossible, it is the duty of parents to make homes in the country for\ntheir children.1\nFathers and mothers who possess a piece of land and a comfort-\nable home are kings and queens.2\nDo not consider it a privation when you are called to leave the\ncities and move out into the country places. Here there await rich\nblessings for those who will grasp them.3\nContributes to Economic Security\u2014Again and again the Lord\nhas instructed that our people are to take their families away from the\ncities, into the country, where they can raise their own provisions;\nfor in the future the problem of buying and selling will be a very\nserious one. We should now begin to heed the instruction given us\nover and over again: Get out of the cities into rural districts, where\nthe houses are not crowded closely together, and where you will be\nfree from the interference of enemies.4 (For further detailed counsel\non this topic see Country Living.)\nAdvice to a City Dweller\u2014It would be well for you to lay by\nyour perplexing cares and find a retreat in the country, where there is\nnot so strong an influence to corrupt the morals of the young. True,\nyou would not be entirely free from annoyances and perplexing cares\nin the country; but you would there avoid many evils and close the\ndoor against a flood of temptations which threaten to overpower the\nminds of your children. They need employment and variety. The[142]\nsameness of their home makes them uneasy and restless, and they\nhave fallen into the habit of mingling with the vicious lads of the\ntown, thus obtaining a street education....\nTo live in the country would be very beneficial to them; an\nactive, out-of-door life would develop health of both mind and body.\nThey should have a garden to cultivate, where they might find both\namusement and useful employment. The training of plants and\nflowers tends to the improvement of taste and judgment, while an\n108\nAdvantages of the Country 109\nacquaintance with God\u2019s useful and beautiful creations has a refining\nand ennobling influence upon the mind, referring it to the Maker\nand Master of all.5\nRich Blessings Assured Country Dwellers \u2014The earth has\nblessings hidden in her depths for those who have courage and\nwill and perseverance to gather her treasures.... Many farmers have\nfailed to secure adequate returns from their land because they have\nundertaken the work as though it was a degrading employment;\nthey do not see that there is a blessing in it for themselves and their\nfamilies.6\nLabor That Will Quicken the Mind, Refine the Character\u2014\nIn the cultivation of the soil the thoughtful worker will find that\ntreasures little dreamed of are opening up before him. No one\ncan succeed in agriculture or gardening without attention to the\nlaws involved. The special needs of every variety of plant must be\nstudied. Different varieties require different soil and cultivation,\nand compliance with the laws governing each is the condition of\nsuccess. The attention required in transplanting, that not even a\nroot fiber shall be crowded or misplaced, the care of the young\nplants, the pruning and watering, the shielding from frost at night [143]\nand sun by day, keeping out weeds, disease, and insect pests, the\ntraining and arranging, not only teach important lessons concerning\nthe development of character, but the work itself is a means of\ndevelopment. In cultivating carefulness, patience, attention to detail,\nobedience to law, it imparts a most essential training. The constant\ncontact with the mystery of life and the loveliness of nature, as well\nas the tenderness called forth in ministering to these beautiful objects\nof God\u2019s creation, tends to quicken the mind and refine and elevate\nthe character.7\nGod Will Instruct and Teach\u2014He who taught Adam and Eve\nin Eden how to tend the garden would instruct men today. There\nis wisdom for him who holds the plow and plants and sows the\nseed. The earth has its concealed treasures, and the Lord would\nhave thousands and tens of thousands working upon the soil who are\ncrowded into the cities to watch for a chance to earn a trifle.... Those\nwho will take their families into the country place them where they\nhave fewer temptations. The children who are with parents that love\nand fear God are in every way much better situated to learn of the\n110 The Adventist Home\nGreat Teacher, who is the source and fountain of wisdom. They have\na much more favorable opportunity to gain a fitness for the kingdom\nof heaven.8\nGod\u2019s Plan for Israel\u2019s Land\u2014Through disobedience to God\nAdam and Eve had lost Eden, and because of sin the whole earth\nwas cursed. But if God\u2019s people followed His instruction, their\nland would be restored to fertility and beauty. God Himself gave\nthem directions in regard to the culture of the soil, and they were to\nco-operate with Him in its restoration. Thus the whole land, under\nGod\u2019s control, would become an object lesson of spiritual truth.[144]\nAs in obedience to His natural laws the earth should produce its\ntreasures, so in obedience to His moral law the hearts of the people\nwere to reflect the attributes of His character.9\nFind Spiritual Lessons in Daily Living\u2014God has surrounded\nus with nature\u2019s beautiful scenery to attract and interest the mind. It\nis His design that we should associate the glories of nature with His\ncharacter. If we faithfully study the book of nature, we shall find\nit a fruitful source for contemplating the infinite love and power of\nGod.10\nChrist has linked His teaching, not only with the day of rest, but\nwith the week of toil.... In the plowing and sowing, the tilling and\nreaping, He teaches us to see an illustration of His work of grace in\nthe heart. So in every line of useful labor and every association of\nlife, He desires us to find a lesson of divine truth. Then our daily toil\nwill no longer absorb our attention and lead us to forget God; it will\ncontinually remind us of our Creator and Redeemer. The thought of\nGod will run like a thread of gold through all our homely cares and\noccupations. For us the glory of His face will again rest upon the\nface of nature. We shall ever be learning new lessons of heavenly\ntruth and growing into the image of His purity.11\nIdentical Laws Govern Nature and Mankind \u2014The Great\nTeacher brought His hearers in contact with nature, that they might\nlisten to the voice which speaks in all created things; and as their\nhearts became tender and their minds receptive, He helped them to\ninterpret the spiritual teaching of the scenes upon which their eyes\nrested.... In His lessons there was something to interest every mind,[145]\nto appeal to every heart. Thus the daily task, instead of being a mere\nAdvantages of the Country 111\nround of toil, bereft of higher thoughts, was brightened and uplifted\nby constant reminders of the spiritual and the unseen.\nSo we should teach. Let the children learn to see in nature an\nexpression of the love and the wisdom of God; let the thought of Him\nbe linked with bird and flower and tree; let all things seen become\nto them the interpreters of the unseen, and all the events of life be a\nmeans of divine teaching.\nAs they learn thus to study the lessons in all created things and\nin all life\u2019s experiences, show that the same laws which govern the\nthings of nature and the events of life are to control us, that they are\ngiven for our good, and that only in obedience to them can we find\ntrue happiness and success.12\nGive Practical Lessons in Agriculture \u2014Of the almost innu-\nmerable lessons taught in the varied processes of growth, some of the\nmost precious are conveyed in the Saviour\u2019s parable of the growing\nseed. It has lessons for old and young....\nThe germination of the seed represents the beginning of spiritual\nlife, and the development of the plant is a figure of the development\nof character.... As parents and teachers try to teach these lessons, the\nwork should be made practical. Let the children themselves prepare\nthe soil and sow the seed. As they work, the parent or teacher can\nexplain the garden of the heart, with the good or bad seed sown\nthere, and that as the garden must be prepared for the natural seed,\nso the heart must be prepared for the seed of truth.... No one settles\nupon a raw piece of land with the expectation that it will at once [146]\nyield a harvest. Diligent, persevering labor must be put forth in the\npreparation of the soil, the sowing of the seed, and the culture of the\ncrop. So it must be in the spiritual sowing.13\nWrong Habits Seen as Weeds\u2014If possible, the home should\nbe out of the city, where the children can have ground to cultivate.\nLet them each have a piece of ground of their own; and as you teach\nthem how to make a garden, how to prepare the soil for seed, and\nthe importance of keeping all the weeds pulled out, teach them also\nhow important it is to keep unsightly, injurious practices out of the\nlife. Teach them to keep down wrong habits as they keep down the\nweeds in their gardens. It will take time to teach these lessons, but it\nwill pay, greatly pay.14\n112 The Adventist Home\nHome Surroundings to Exemplify Our Beliefs \u2014Parents are\nunder obligation to God to make their surroundings such as will\ncorrespond to the truth they profess. They can then give correct\nlessons to their children, and the children will learn to associate the\nhome below with the home above. The family here must, as far\nas possible, be a model of the one in heaven. Then temptations to\nindulge in what is low and groveling will lose much of their force.\nChildren should be taught that they are only probationers here, and\neducated to become inhabitants of the mansions which Christ is\npreparing for those who love Him and keep His commandments.\nThis is the highest duty which parents have to perform.15\nParents: Get Homes in the Country \u2014So long as God gives\nme power to speak to our people, I shall continue to call upon\nparents to leave the cities and get homes in the country, where they\ncan cultivate the soil and learn from the book of nature the lessons\nof purity and simplicity. The things of nature are the Lord\u2019s silent[147]\nministers, given to us to teach us spiritual truths. They speak to us of\nthe love of God and declare the wisdom of the great Master Artist.\nI love the beautiful flowers. They are memories of Eden, pointing\nto the blessed country into which, if faithful, we shall soon enter.\nThe Lord is leading my mind to the health-giving properties of the\nflowers and trees.16\n1Country Living, 12.\n2Fundamentals of Christian Education, 327.\n3Country Living, 14.\n4Ibid., 9, 10.\n5Testimonies for the Church 4:136.\n6Fundamentals of Christian Education, 326, 327.\n7Education, 111, 112.\n8Fundamentals of Christian Education, 326.\n9Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 289.\n10Messages to Young People, 365, 366.\n11Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 26, 27.\n12Education, 102, 103.\n13Ibid., 104, 105, 111.\n14Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 124.\n15Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 144.\n16Letter 47, 1903.\nChapter 22\u2014Building and Furnishing the Home [148]\nProvide Ventilation, Sunlight, and Drainage \u2014In the con-\nstruction of buildings, whether for public purposes or as dwellings,\ncare should be taken to provide for good ventilation and plenty of\nsunlight. Churches and schoolrooms are often faulty in this respect.\nNeglect of proper ventilation is responsible for much of the drowsi-\nness and dullness that destroy the effect of many a sermon and make\nthe teacher\u2019s work toilsome and ineffective.\nSo far as possible, all buildings intended for human habitation\nshould be placed on high, well-drained ground. This will ensure a\ndry site.... This matter is often too lightly regarded. Continuous ill\nhealth, serious diseases, and many deaths result from the dampness\nand malaria of low-lying, ill-drained situations.\nIn the building of houses it is especially important to secure\nthorough ventilation and plenty of sunlight. Let there be a current of\nair and an abundance of light in every room in the house. Sleeping\nrooms should be so arranged as to have a free circulation of air day\nand night. No room is fit to be occupied as a sleeping room unless it\ncan be thrown open daily to the air and sunshine. In most countries\nbedrooms need to be supplied with conveniences for heating, that\nthey may be thoroughly warmed and dried in cold or wet weather.\nThe guestchamber should have equal care with the rooms in-\ntended for constant use. Like the other bedrooms, it should have air\nand sunshine and should be provided with some means of heating\nto dry out the dampness that always accumulates in a room not in [149]\nconstant use. Whoever sleeps in a sunless room or occupies a bed\nthat has not been thoroughly dried and aired does so at the risk of\nhealth, and often of life....\nThose who have the aged to provide for should remember that\nthese especially need warm, comfortable rooms. Vigor declines as\nyears advance, leaving less vitality with which to resist unhealthful\ninfluences; hence the greater necessity for the aged to have plenty of\nsunlight and fresh, pure air.1\n113\n114 The Adventist Home\nAvoid Lowlands\u2014If we would have our homes the abiding\nplace of health and happiness, we must place them above the miasma\nand fog of the lowlands and give free entrance to heaven\u2019s life-giving\nagencies. Dispense with heavy curtains, open the windows and the\nblinds, allow no vines, however beautiful, to shade the windows, and\npermit no trees to stand so near the house as to shut out the sunshine.\nThe sunlight may fade the drapery and the carpets and tarnish the\npicture frames, but it will bring a healthy glow to the cheeks of the\nchildren.2\nThe Yard Surrounding the House \u2014A yard beautified with\nscattering trees and some shrubbery, at a proper distance from the\nhouse, has a happy influence upon the family, and, if well taken\ncare of, will prove no injury to the health. But shade trees and\nshrubbery close and dense around a house make it unhealthful, for\nthey prevent the free circulation of air and shut out the rays of the\nsun. In consequence, a dampness gathers in the house, especially in\nwet seasons.3\nThe Effect of Natural Beauty on the Household\u2014God loves\nthe beautiful. He has clothed the earth and the heavens with beauty,[150]\nand with a Father\u2019s joy He watches the delight of His children in the\nthings that He has made. He desires us to surround our homes with\nthe beauty of natural things.\nNearly all dwellers in the country, however poor, could have\nabout their homes a bit of grassy lawn, a few shade trees, flowering\nshrubbery, or fragrant blossoms. And far more than any artificial\nadorning will they minister to the happiness of the household. They\nwill bring into the home life a softening, refining influence, strength-\nening the love of nature and drawing the members of the household\nnearer to one another and nearer to God.4\nLet the Home Furnishings Be Simple \u2014Our artificial habits\ndeprive us of many blessings and much enjoyment, and unfit us for\nliving the most useful lives. Elaborate and expensive furnishings are\na waste not only of money but of that which is a thousandfold more\nprecious. They bring into the home a heavy burden of care and labor\nand perplexity....\nFurnish your home with things plain and simple, things that will\nbear handling, that can be easily kept clean, and that can be replaced\nwithout great expense. By exercising taste, you can make a very\nBuilding and Furnishing the Home 115\nsimple home attractive and inviting, if love and contentment are\nthere.5\nHappiness is not found in empty show. The more simple the\norder of a well-regulated household, the happier will that home be.6\nAvoid the Spirit of Rivalry \u2014Life is a disappointment and a\nweariness to many persons because of the unnecessary labor with\nwhich they burden themselves in meeting the claims of custom.\nTheir minds are continually harassed with anxiety as to supplying [151]\nwants which are the offspring of pride and fashion....\nThe expense, the care, and labor lavished on that which, if not\npositively injurious, is unnecessary would go far toward advancing\nthe cause of God if applied to a worthier object. People crave what\nare called the luxuries of life, and sacrifice health, strength, and\nmeans to obtain them. A lamentable spirit of rivalry is manifested\namong persons of the same class as to who shall make the greatest\ndisplay in matters of dress and of household expenditure. The sweet\nword \u201cHome\u201d is perverted to mean \u201csomething with four walls, filled\nwith elegant furniture and adornments,\u201d while its inmates are on a\ncontinual strain to meet the requirements of custom in the different\ndepartments of life.7\nMany are unhappy in their home life because they are trying so\nhard to keep up appearances. They expend large sums of money and\nlabor unremittingly that they may make a display and gain the praise\nof their associates\u2014those who really care nothing for them or their\nprosperity. One article after another is considered indispensable\nto the household appointments, until many expensive additions are\nmade that, while they please the eye and gratify pride and ambition,\ndo not in the least increase the comfort of the family. And yet these\nthings have taxed the strength and patience, and consumed valuable\ntime which should have been given to the service of the Lord.\nThe precious grace of God is made secondary to matters of no\nreal importance; and many, while collecting material for enjoyment,\nlose the capacity for happiness. They find that their possessions fail\nto give the satisfaction they had hoped to derive from them. This\nendless round of labor, this unceasing anxiety to embellish the home [152]\nfor visitors and strangers to admire, never pays for the time and\nmeans thus expended. It is placing upon the neck a yoke of bondage\ngrievous to be borne.8\n116 The Adventist Home\nTwo Visits are Contrasted\u2014In some families there is too much\ndone. Neatness and order are essential to comfort, but these virtues\nshould not be carried to such an extreme as to make life a period of\nunceasing drudgery and to render the inmates of the home miserable.\nIn the houses of some whom we highly esteem, there is a stiff\nprecision about the arrangement of the furniture and belongings that\nis quite as disagreeable as a lack of order would be. The painful\npropriety which invests the whole house makes it impossible to find\nthere that rest which one expects in the true home.\nIt is not pleasant, when making a brief visit to dear friends, to see\nthe broom and the duster in constant requisition, and the time which\nyou had anticipated enjoying with your friends in social converse\nspent by them in a general tidying up and peering into corners in\nsearch of a concealed speck of dust or a cobweb. Although this may\nbe done out of respect to your presence in the house, yet you feel a\npainful conviction that your company is of less consequence to your\nfriends than their ideas of excessive neatness.\nIn direct contrast to such homes was one that we visited during\nthe last summer [1876]. Here the few hours of our stay were not\nspent in useless labor or in doing that which could be done as well\nat some other time, but were occupied in a pleasant and profitable\nmanner, restful alike to mind and body. The house was a model of\ncomfort, although not extravagantly furnished. The rooms were all\nwell lighted and ventilated, ... which is of more real value than the\nmost costly adornments. The parlors were not furnished with that[153]\nprecision which is so tiresome to the eye, but there was a pleasing\nvariety in the articles of furniture.\nThe chairs were mostly rockers or easy chairs, not all of the\nsame fashion, but adapted to the comfort of the different members\nof the family. There were low, cushioned rocking chairs and high,\nstraight-backed ones; wide, capacious lounging chairs and snug,\nlittle ones; there were also comfortable sofas; and all seemed to say,\nTry me, rest in me. There were tables strewn with books and papers.\nAll was neat and attractive, but without that precise arrangement that\nseems to warn all beholders not to touch anything for fear of getting\nit out of place.\nThe proprietors of this pleasant home were in such circumstances\nthat they might have furnished and embellished their residence ex-\nBuilding and Furnishing the Home 117\npensively, but they had wisely chosen comfort rather than display.\nThere was nothing in the house considered too good for general use,\nand the curtains and blinds were not kept closed to keep the carpets\nfrom fading and the furniture from tarnishing. The God-given sun-\nlight and air had free ingress, with the fragrance of the flowers in the\ngarden. The family were, of course, in keeping with the home; they\nwere cheerful and entertaining, doing everything needful for our\ncomfort, without oppressing us with so much attention as to make\nus fear that we were causing extra trouble. We felt that here was a\nplace of rest. This was a home in the fullest sense of the word.9\nA Principle Used in Decorating \u2014The rigid precision which\nwe have mentioned as being a disagreeable feature of so many homes\nis not in accordance with the great plan of nature. God has not caused\nthe flowers of the fields to grow in regular beds, with set borders,\nbut He has scattered them like gems over the greensward, and they [154]\nbeautify the earth with their variety of form and color. The trees of\nthe forest are not in regular order. It is restful to eye and mind to\nrange over the scenes of nature, over forest, hill, and valley, plain\nand river, enjoying the endless diversity of form and color, and the\nbeauty with which trees, shrubs, and flowers are grouped in nature\u2019s\ngarden, making it a picture of loveliness. Childhood, youth, and age\ncan alike find rest and gratification there.\nThis law of variety can be in a measure carried out in the home.\nThere should be a proper harmony of colors and a general fitness of\nthings in the furnishings of a house; but it is not necessary to good\ntaste that every article of furniture in a room should be of the same\npattern in design, material, or upholstery; but, on the contrary, it is\nmore pleasing to the eye that there should be a harmonious variety.\nBut whether the home be humble or elegant, its appointments\ncostly or the reverse, there will be no happiness within its walls\nunless the spirit of its inmates is in harmony with the divine will.\nContentment should reign within the household.10\nThe very best part of the house, the sunniest and most inviting\nrooms, and the most comfortable furniture should be in a daily use\nby those who really live in the house. This will make home attractive\nto the inmates and also to that class of friends who really care for\nus, whom we could benefit, and by whom we could be benefited.11\n118 The Adventist Home\nConsider the Children\u2019s Comfort and Welfare\u2014It does not\nrequire costly surroundings and expensive furniture to make children\ncontented and happy in their homes, but it is necessary that the[155]\nparents give them tender love and careful attention.12\nFour walls and costly furniture, velvet carpets, elegant mirrors,\nand fine pictures do not make a \u201chome\u201d if sympathy and love are\nwanting. That sacred word does not belong to the glittering mansion\nwhere the joys of domestic life are unknown....\nIn fact the comfort and welfare of the children are the last things\nthought of in such a home. They are neglected by the mother,\nwhose whole time is devoted to keeping up appearances and meeting\nthe claims of fashionable society. Their minds are untrained; they\nacquire bad habits and become restless and dissatisfied. Finding no\npleasure in their own homes, but only uncomfortable restrictions,\nthey break away from the family circle as soon as possible. They\nlaunch out into the great world with little reluctance, unrestrained\nby home influence and the tender counsel of the hearthstone.13\nDon\u2019t say to them as I have heard many mothers say, \u201cThere\nis no room for you here in the parlor. Don\u2019t sit on that sofa that\nis covered with satin damask. We don\u2019t want you to sit down on\nthat sofa.\u201d And when they go into another room, \u201cWe don\u2019t want\nyour noise here.\u201d And they go into the kitchen, and the cook says, \u201cI\ncannot be bothered with you here. Go out from here with your noise;\nyou pester me so, and bother me.\u201d Where do they go to receive their\neducation? Into the street.14\nKindness and Love More Precious Than Luxury\u2014Too many\ncares and burdens are brought into our families, and too little of nat-\nural simplicity and peace and happiness is cherished. There should\nbe less care for what the outside world will say, and more thought-\nful attention to the members of the family circle. There should be[156]\nless display and affectation of worldly politeness, and much more\ntenderness and love, cheerfulness and Christian courtesy among the\nmembers of the household. Many need to learn how to make home\nattractive, a place of enjoyment. Thankful hearts and kind looks are\nmore valuable than wealth and luxury, and contentment with simple\nthings will make home happy if love be there.\nJesus, our Redeemer, walked the earth with the dignity of a king;\nyet He was meek and lowly of heart. He was a light and blessing\nBuilding and Furnishing the Home 119\nin every home because He carried cheerfulness, hope, and courage\nwith Him. Oh, that we could be satisfied with less heart longings,\nless striving for things difficult to obtain wherewith to beautify our\nhomes, while that which God values above jewels, the meek and\nquiet spirit, is not cherished. The grace of simplicity, meekness, and\ntrue affection would make a paradise of the humblest home. It is\nbetter to endure cheerfully every inconvenience than to part with\npeace and contentment.15\n1The Ministry of Healing, 274, 275.\n2Ibid., 275.\n3Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 107.\n4The Ministry of Healing, 370.\n5Ibid., 367, 370.\n6The Signs of the Times, August 23, 1877.\n7The Signs of the Times, August 23, 1877.\n8The Signs of the Times, October 2, 1884.\n9The Signs of the Times, August 23, 1877.\n10The Signs of the Times, August 23, 1877.\n11The Signs of the Times, October 2, 1884.\n12The Signs of the Times, October 2, 1884.\n13The Signs of the Times, October 2, 1884.\n14Manuscript 43a, 1894.\n15Testimonies for the Church 4:621, 622.\n120 The Adventist Home\nSection 7\u2014Heritage of the Lord [157]\nChapter 23\u2014Children a Blessing[158]\n[159]\nGod Planned for Families\u2014He who gave Eve to Adam as a\nhelpmeet ... ordained that men and women should be united in\nholy wedlock, to rear families whose members, crowned with honor,\nshould be recognized as members of the family above.1\nChildren are the heritage of the Lord, and we are answerable\nto Him for our management of His property.... In love, faith, and\nprayer let parents work for their households, until with joy they can\ncome to God saying, \u201cBehold, I and the children whom the Lord\nhath given me.\u201d2\nA childless house is a desolate place. The hearts of the inmates\nare in danger of becoming selfish, of cherishing a love for their own\nease, and consulting their own desires and conveniences. They gather\nsympathy to themselves, but have little to bestow upon others.3\nCounsel to a Childless Couple\u2014Selfishness, which manifests\nitself in a variety of ways according to circumstances and the peculiar\norganization of individuals, must die. If you had children, and your\nmind were compelled to be called away from yourself to care for\nthem, to instruct them, and be an example to them, it would be an\nadvantage to you.... When two compose a family, as in your case,\nand there are no children to call into exercise patience, forbearance,\nand true love, there is need of constant watchfulness lest selfishness\nobtain the supremacy, lest you yourselves become the center, and\nyou require attention, care, and interest, which you feel under no\nobligation to bestow upon others.4\nMany are diseased physically, mentally, and morally because[160]\ntheir attention is turned almost exclusively to themselves. They\nmight be saved from stagnation by the healthy vitality of younger\nand varying minds and the restless energy of children.5\nNoble Traits Are Developed in Caring for Children\u2014I have\na very tender interest in all children, for I became a sufferer at a\nvery early age. I have taken many children to care for, and I have\n122\nChildren a Blessing 123\nalways felt that association with the simplicity of childhood was a\ngreat blessing to me....\nThe sympathy, forbearance, and love required in dealing with\nchildren would be a blessing in any household. They would soften\nand subdue set traits of character in those who need to be more\ncheerful and restful. The presence of a child in a home sweetens and\nrefines. A child brought up in the fear of the Lord is a blessing.6\nCare and affection for dependent children removes the roughness\nfrom our natures, makes us tender and sympathetic, and has an\ninfluence to develop the nobler elements of our character.7\nA Child\u2019s Influence on Enoch\u2014After the birth of his first son,\nEnoch reached a higher experience; he was drawn into a closer\nrelationship with God. He realized more fully his own obligations\nand responsibility as a son of God. And as he saw the child\u2019s\nlove for its father, its simple trust in his protection; as he felt the\ndeep, yearning tenderness of his own heart for that first-born son, he\nlearned a precious lesson of the wonderful love of God to men in\nthe gift of His Son, and the confidence which the children of God\nmay repose in their heavenly Father.8\nA Precious Trust\u2014Children are committed to their parents as [161]\na precious trust, which God will one day require at their hands. We\nshould give to their training more time, more care, and more prayer.\nThey need more of the right kind of instruction....\nRemember that your sons and daughters are younger members\nof God\u2019s family. He has committed them to your care, to train and\neducate for heaven. You must render an account to Him for the\nmanner in which you discharge your sacred trust.9\n1The Ministry of Healing, 356.\n2Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 195, 196.\n3Testimonies for the Church 2:647.\n4Ibid., 2:230, 231.\n5Ibid., 2:647.\n6Letter 329, 1904.\n7Testimonies for the Church 2:647.\n8Patriarchs and Prophets, 84.\n9The Review and Herald, June 13, 1882.\nChapter 24\u2014Size of the Family[162]\nA Grievous Wrong to Mothers, Children, and Society \u2014\nThere are parents who, without consideration as to whether or not\nthey can do justice to a large family, fill their houses with these\nhelpless little beings, who are wholly dependent upon their parents\nfor care and instruction.... This is a grievous wrong, not only to the\nmother, but to her children and to society....\nParents should always bear in mind the future good of their\nchildren. They should not be compelled to devote every hour to\ntaxing labor in order to provide the necessaries of life.1\nBefore increasing their family, they should take into considera-\ntion whether God would be glorified or dishonored by their bringing\nchildren into the world. They should seek to glorify God by their\nunion from the first, and during every year of their married life.2\nThe Mother\u2019s Health Is Important\u2014In view of the responsi-\nbility that devolves upon parents, it should be carefully considered\nwhether it is best to bring children into the family. Has the mother\nsufficient strength to care for her children? And can the father give\nsuch advantages as will rightly mold and educate the child? How\nlittle is the destiny of the child considered! The gratification of\npassion is the only thought, and burdens are brought upon the wife\nand mother which undermine her vitality and paralyze her spiritual\npower. In broken health and with discouraged spirits she finds her-\nself surrounded by a little flock whom she cannot care for as she\nshould. Lacking the instruction they should have, they grow up to[163]\ndishonor God and to communicate to others the evil of their own\nnatures, and thus an army is raised up whom Satan manages as he\npleases.3\nOther Factors to Be Considered\u2014God would have parents act\nas rational beings and live in such a manner that each child may\nbe properly educated, that the mother may have strength and time\nto employ her mental powers in disciplining her little ones for the\nsociety of the angels. She should have courage to act nobly her part\n124\nSize of the Family 125\nand to do her work in the fear and love of God, that her children may\nprove a blessing to the family and to society.\nThe husband and father should consider all these things lest the\nwife and mother of his children be overtaxed and thus overwhelmed\nwith despondency. He should see to it that the mother of his children\nis not placed in a position where she cannot possibly do justice to her\nnumerous little ones, so that they have to come up without proper\ntraining.4\nParents should not increase their families any faster than they\nknow that their children can be well cared for and educated. A child\nin the mother\u2019s arms from year to year is great injustice to her. It\nlessens, and often destroys, social enjoyment and increases domestic\nwretchedness. It robs their children of that care, education, and\nhappiness which parents should feel it their duty to bestow upon\nthem.5\nCounsel to Parents of a Large Family \u2014The question to be\nsettled by you is, \u201cAm I raising a family of children to strengthen\nthe influence and swell the ranks of the powers of darkness, or am I\nbringing up children for Christ?\u201d\nIf you do not govern your children and mold their characters [164]\nto meet the requirements of God, then the fewer children there are\nto suffer from your defective training the better it will be for you,\ntheir parents, and the better it will be for society. Unless children\ncan be trained and disciplined from their babyhood by a wise and\njudicious mother who is conscientious and intelligent, and who rules\nher household in the fear of the Lord, molding and shaping their\ncharacters to meet the standard of righteousness, it is a sin to increase\nyour family. God has given you reason, and He requires you to use\nit.6\nFathers and mothers, when you know that you are deficient in\na knowledge of how to train your children for the Master, why do\nyou not learn your lessons? Why do you continue to bring children\ninto the world to swell the numbers in Satan\u2019s ranks? Is God pleased\nwith this showing? When you see that a large family will severely\ntax your resources, when you see that it is giving the mother her\nhands full of children, and that she has not time intervening between\ntheir births to do the work every mother needs to do, why do you not\nconsider the sure result? Every child draws upon the vitality of the\n126 The Adventist Home\nmother, and when fathers and mothers do not use their reason in this\nmatter, what chance is given to parents or children to be properly\ndisciplined? The Lord calls upon parents to consider this matter in\nthe light of future eternal realities.7\nEconomic Considerations\u2014[Parents] should calmly consider\nwhat provision can be made for their children. They have no right\nto bring children into the world to be a burden to others. Have they\na business that they can rely upon to sustain a family so that they\nneed not become a burden to others? If they have not, they commit a[165]\ncrime in bringing children into the world to suffer for want of proper\ncare, food, and clothing.8\nThose who are seriously deficient in business tact, and who\nare the least qualified to get along in the world, generally fill their\nhouses with children; while men who have ability to acquire property\ngenerally have no more children than they can well provide for.\nThose who are not qualified to take care of themselves should not\nhave children.9\nHow Perplexity Is Sometimes Brought to the Church\u2014Many\nwho can but barely live when they are single choose to marry and\nraise a family when they know they have nothing with which to\nsupport them. And worse than this, they have no family govern-\nment. Their whole course in their family is marked with their loose,\nslack habits. They have but little control over themselves and are\npassionate, impatient, and fretful. When such embrace the message,\nthey feel that they are entitled to assistance from their more wealthy\nbrethren; and if their expectations are not met, they complain of the\nchurch and accuse them of not living out their faith. Who must be\nthe sufferers in this case? Must the cause of God be sapped, and\nthe treasury in different places exhausted, to take care of these large\nfamilies of poor? No. The parents must be the sufferers. They will\nnot, as a general thing, suffer any greater lack after they embrace the\nSabbath than they did before.10\nHow Missionary Service May Be Restricted\u2014In sending mis-\nsionaries to distant countries, those men should be selected who\nknow how to economize, who have not large families, and who, re-\nalizing the shortness of time and the great work to be accomplished,[166]\nwill not fill their hands and houses with children, but will keep them-\nselves as free as possible from everything that will divert their minds\nSize of the Family 127\nfrom their one great work. The wife, if devoted and left free to do\nso, can, by standing by the side of her husband, accomplish as much\nas he. God has blessed woman with talents to be used to His glory\nin bringing many sons and daughters to God; but many who might\nbe efficient laborers are kept at home to care for their little ones.\nWe want missionaries who are missionaries in the fullest sense\nof the word; who will put aside selfish considerations and let the\ncause of God come first; and who, working with an eye single to His\nglory, will keep themselves as minute men to go where He shall bid\nand to work in any capacity to spread the knowledge of the truth.\nMen who have wives that love and fear God and that can help them\nin the work are needed in the missionary field. Many who have\nfamilies go out to labor, but they do not give themselves entirely to\nthe work. Their minds are divided. Wife and children draw them\nfrom their labor and often keep them out of fields that they might\nenter were it not that they think they must be near their home.11\n1The Review and Herald, June 24, 1890.\n2Testimonies for the Church 2:380.\n3The Review and Herald, October 25, 1892.\n4The Review and Herald, June 24, 1890.\n5A Solemn Appeal, 110, 111\n6Testimonies for the Church 5:323, 324.\n7Letter 107, 1898.\n8Testimonies for the Church 2:380.\n9A Solemn Appeal, 103.\n10Testimonies for the Church 1:273.\n11The Review and Herald, December 8, 1885.\nChapter 25\u2014Caring for Needy Children[167]\nOrphaned Children\u2014Many a father who has died in the faith,\nresting upon the eternal promise of God, has left his loved ones\nin full trust that the Lord would care for them. And how does the\nLord provide for these bereaved ones? He does not work a miracle\nin sending manna from heaven; He does not send ravens to bring\nthem food; but He works a miracle upon human hearts, expelling\nselfishness from the soul and unsealing the fountains of benevolence.\nHe tests the love of His professed followers by committing to their\ntender mercies the afflicted and bereaved ones.\nLet those who have the love of God open their hearts and homes\nto take in these children....\nThere is a wide field of usefulness before all who will work\nfor the Master in caring for these children and youth who have\nbeen deprived of the watchful guidance of parents and the subduing\ninfluence of a Christian home. Many of them have inherited evil\ntraits of character; and if left to grow up in ignorance, they will drift\ninto associations that lead to vice and crime. These unpromising\nchildren need to be placed in a position favorable for the formation\nof a right character, that they may become children of God.1\nResponsibility of the Church\u2014Fatherless and motherless chil-\ndren are thrown into the arms of the church, and Christ says to His\nfollowers: Take these destitute children, bring them up for Me, and\nye shall receive your wages. I have seen much selfishness exhibited\nin these things. Unless there is some special evidence that theythem-[168]\nselves are to be benefited by adopting into their family those who\nneed homes, some turn away and answer: No. They do not seem\nto know or care whether such are saved or lost. That, they think, is\nnot their business. With Cain they say: \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d\nThey are not willing to be put to inconvenience or to make any sac-\nrifice for the orphans, and they indifferently thrust such ones into\nthe arms of the world, who are sometimes more willing to receive\nthem than are these professed Christians. In the day of God inquiry\n128\nCaring for Needy Children 129\nwill be made for those whom Heaven gave them the opportunity of\nsaving. But they wished to be excused, and would not engage in the\ngood work unless they could make it a matter of profit to them. I\nhave been shown that those who refuse these opportunities for doing\ngood will hear from Jesus: \u201cAs ye did it not to one of the least of\nthese, ye did it not to Me.\u201d Please read Isaiah 58: [verses 5-11].2\nAn Appeal to Childless Couples\u2014Some who have not children\nof their own should educate themselves to love and care for the\nchildren of others. They may not be called to go to a foreign field of\nlabor, but they may be called to work in the very locality in which\nthey live. In place of giving so much attention to pets, lavishing\naffection upon dumb animals, let them exercise their talent upon\nhuman beings who have a heaven to win and a hell to shun. Let them\ngive their attention to little children whose characters they may mold\nand fashion after the divine similitude. Place your love upon the\nhomeless little ones that are around you. Instead of closing your heart\nto the members of the human family, see how many of these little\nhomeless ones you can bring up in the nurture and admonition of the\nLord. There is an abundance of work for everyone who wants work [169]\nto do. By engaging in this line of Christian endeavor, the church\nmay be increased in members and enriched in spirit. The work of\nsaving the homeless and the fatherless is everyone\u2019s business.3\nIf those who have no children and whom God has made stewards\nof means would expand their hearts to care for children who need\nlove, care, and affection, and assistance with this world\u2019s goods, they\nwould be far happier than they are today. So long as youth who have\nnot a father\u2019s pitying care nor a mother\u2019s tender love are exposed to\nthe corrupting influences of these last days, it is somebody\u2019s duty\nto supply the place of father and mother to some of them. Learn to\ngive them love, affection, and sympathy. All who profess to have a\nFather in heaven, who they hope will care for them and finally take\nthem to the home He has prepared for them, ought to feel a solemn\nobligation resting upon them to be friends to the friendless and\nfathers to the orphans, to aid the widows, and be of some practical\nuse in this world by benefiting humanity.4\nShould Ministers\u2019 Wives Adopt Children?\u2014The question has\nbeen asked whether a minister\u2019s wife should adopt infant children. I\nanswer: if she has no inclination or fitness to engage in missionary\n130 The Adventist Home\nwork outside her home, and feels it her duty to take orphan children\nand care for them, she may do a good work. But let the choice of\nchildren be first made from among those who have been left orphans\nby Sabbathkeeping parents. God will bless men and women as they\nwith willing hearts share their homes with these homeless ones. But\nif the minister\u2019s wife can herself act a part in the work of educating\nothers, she should consecrate her powers to God as a Christian\nworker. She should be a true helper to her husband, assisting him in[170]\nhis work, improving her intellect, and helping to give the message.\nThe way is open for humble, consecrated women, dignified by the\ngrace of Christ, to visit those in need of help and shed light into\ndiscouraged souls. They can lift up the bowed down by praying with\nthem and pointing them to Christ. Such should not devote their time\nand strength to one helpless little mortal that requires constant care\nand attention. They should not thus voluntarily tie their hands.5\nOpen Homes to Orphans and Friendless \u2014As far as lies in\nyour power, make a home for the homeless. Let everyone stand\nready to act a part in helping forward this work. The Lord said to\nPeter: \u201cFeed My lambs.\u201d This command is to us, and by opening\nour homes for the orphans we aid in its fulfillment. Let not Jesus be\ndisappointed in you.\nTake these children and present them to God as a fragrant of-\nfering. Ask His blessing upon them and then mold and fashion\nthem according to Christ\u2019s order. Will our people accept this holy\ntrust?6 [Note: For further detailed counsel on this topic see Welfare\nMinistry.]\nA Test for God\u2019s People\u2014Years ago I was shown that God\u2019s\npeople would be tested upon this point of making homes for the\nhomeless; that there would be many without homes in consequence\nof their believing the truth. Opposition and persecution would de-\nprive believers of their homes, and it was the duty of those who had\nhomes to open a wide door to those who had not. I have been shown\nmore recently that God would specially test His professed people in\nreference to this matter. Christ for our sakes became poor that we[171]\nthrough His poverty might be made rich. He made a sacrifice that\nHe might provide a home for pilgrims and strangers in the world\nseeking for a better country, even an heavenly.7\nCaring for Needy Children 131\n1Testimonies for the Church 6:281, 282.\n2Ibid., 2:33.\n3Manuscript 38, 1895.\n4Testimonies for the Church 2:329.\n5Ibid., 6:285.\n6Ibid., 6:284.\n7Ibid., 2:27, 28.\nChapter 26\u2014Parents\u2019 Legacy to Children[172]\nThe Law of Heredity\u2014The physical and mental condition of\nthe parents is perpetuated in their offspring. This is a matter that is\nnot duly considered. Wherever the habits of the parents are contrary\nto physical law, the injury done to themselves will be repeated in the\nfuture generations....\nBy physical, mental, and moral culture all may become co-\nworkers with Christ. Very much depends upon the parents. It lies\nwith them whether they shall bring into the world children who will\nprove a blessing or a curse.1\nThe nobler the aims, the higher the mental and spiritual endow-\nments, and the better developed the physical powers of the parents,\nthe better will be the life equipment they give their children. In\ncultivating that which is best in themselves, parents are exerting an\ninfluence to mold society and to uplift future generations.2\nMany Parents Are Lamentably Ignorant \u2014Those who have\ncharge of God\u2019s property in the souls and bodies of the children\nformed in His image should erect barriers against the sensual indul-\ngence of this age which is ruining the physical and moral health of\nthousands. If the many crimes of this time were traced to their true\ncause, it would be seen that they are chargeable to the ignorance of\nfathers and mothers who are indifferent on this subject. Health and\nlife itself is being sacrificed to this lamentable ignorance. Parents, if\nyou fail to give your children the education that God makes it your\nduty to give them, both by precept and example, you must answer to\nyour God for the results. These results will not be confined merely[173]\nto your children. They will reach through generations. Just as the\none thistle permitted to grow in the field produces a harvest of its\nkind, the sins resulting from your neglect will work to ruin all who\ncome within the sphere of their influence.3\nEvils of Intemperance Are Perpetuated \u2014Luxurious living\nand the use of wine corrupt the blood, inflame the passions, and\nproduce diseases of every kind. But the evil does not end here. Par-\n132\nParents\u2019 Legacy to Children 133\nents leave maladies as a legacy to their children. As a rule, every\nintemperate man who rears children transmits his inclinations and\nevil tendencies to his offspring; he gives them disease from his own\ninflamed and corrupted blood. Licentiousness, disease, and imbecil-\nity are transmitted as an inheritance of woe from father to son and\nfrom generation to generation, and this brings anguish and suffering\ninto the world and is no less than a repetition of the fall of man....\nAnd yet with scarcely a thought or care, men and women of the\npresent generation indulge intemperance by surfeiting and drunken-\nness and thereby leave, as a legacy for the next generation, disease,\nenfeebled intellects, and polluted morals.4\nThere Is Reason for Double Understanding and Patience \u2014\nFathers and mothers may study their own character in their children.\nThey may often read humiliating lessons as they see their own im-\nperfections reproduced in their sons and daughters. While seeking\nto repress and correct in their children hereditary tendencies to evil,\nparents should call to their aid double patience, perseverance, and\nlove.5\nWhen a child reveals the wrong traits which it has inherited [174]\nfrom its parents, shall they storm over this reproduction of their own\ndefects? No, no! Let parents keep a careful watch over themselves,\nguarding against all coarseness and roughness, lest these defects be\nseen once more in their children.6\nManifest the meekness and gentleness of Christ in dealing with\nthe wayward little ones. Always bear in mind that they have re-\nceived their perversity as an inheritance from the father or mother.\nThen bear with the children who have inherited your own trait of\ncharacter.7\nParents must trust implicitly in the power of Christ to trans-\nform the tendencies to wrong which have been transmitted to their\nchildren.8\nHave patience, fathers and mothers. Often your past neglect will\nmake your work hard. But God will give you strength if you will\ntrust in Him. Deal wisely and tenderly with your children.9\n134 The Adventist Home\n1Manuscript 3, 1897.\n2The Ministry of Healing, 371.\n3Manuscript 58, 1899.\n4Testimonies for the Church 4:30, 31.\n5The Review and Herald, August 30, 1881.\n6The Signs of the Times, September 25, 1901.\n7Manuscript 142, 1898.\n8Manuscript 79, 1901.\n9Manuscript 80, 1901.\nSection 8\u2014The Successful Family [175]\nChapter 27\u2014A Sacred Circle[176]\n[177]\nSanctity of the Family Circle\u2014There is a sacred circle around\nevery family which should be preserved. No other one has any right\nin that sacred circle. The husband and wife should be all to each\nother. The wife should have no secrets to keep from her husband\nand let others know, and the husband should have no secrets to keep\nfrom his wife to relate to others. The heart of his wife should be the\ngrave for the faults of the husband, and the heart of the husband the\ngrave for his wife\u2019s faults. Never should either party indulge in a\njoke at the expense of the other\u2019s feelings. Never should either the\nhusband or wife in sport or in any other manner complain of each\nother to others, for frequently indulging in this foolish and what may\nseem perfectly harmless joking will end in trial with each other and\nperhaps estrangement. I have been shown that there should be a\nsacred shield around every family.1\nThe home circle should be regarded as a sacred place, a sym-\nbol of heaven, a mirror in which to reflect ourselves. Friends and\nacquaintances we may have, but in the home life they are not to\nmeddle. A strong sense of proprietorship should be felt, giving a\nsense of ease, restfulness, trust.2\nTongues, Ears, and Eyes to Be Sanctified\u2014Let those compos-\ning the family circle pray that God will sanctify their tongues, their\nears, their eyes, and every member of their body. When brought into\ncontact with evil, it is not necessary to be overcome of evil. Christ[178]\nhas made it possible for the character to be fragrant with good....\nHow many dishonor Christ and misrepresent His character in\nthe home circle! How many do not manifest patience, forbearance,\nforgiveness, and true love! Many have their likes and dislikes and\nfeel at liberty to manifest their own perverse disposition rather than\nto reveal the will, the works, the character of Christ. The life of\nJesus is full of kindness and love. Are we growing into His divine\nnature?3\n136\nSacred Circle 137\nUnity, Love, and Peace \u2014Let fathers and mothers make a\nsolemn promise to God, whom they profess to love and obey, that\nby His grace they will not disagree between themselves, but will\nin their own life and temper manifest the spirit that they wish their\nchildren to cherish.4\nParents should be careful not to allow the spirit of dissension to\ncreep into the home; for this is one of Satan\u2019s agents to make his\nimpression on the character. If parents will strive for unity in the\nhome by inculcating the principles that governed the life of Christ,\ndissension will be driven out, and unity and love will abide there.\nParents and children will partake of the gift of the Holy Spirit.5\nLet the husband and wife remember that they have burdens\nenough to carry without making their lives wretched by allowing\ndifferences to come in. Those who give place to little differences\ninvite Satan into their home. The children catch the spirit of con-\ntention over mere trifles. Evil agencies do their part to make parents\nand children disloyal to God.6\nAlthough trials may arise in the married life, the husband and\nthe wife are to keep their souls in the love of God. The father should [179]\nlook upon the mother of his children as one deserving of all kindness,\ntenderness, and sympathy.7\nThe Secret of Family Unity\u2014The cause of division and discord\nin families and in the church is separation from Christ. To come near\nto Christ is to come near to one another. The secret of true unity in\nthe church and in the family is not diplomacy, not management, not\na superhuman effort to overcome difficulties\u2014though there will be\nmuch of this to do\u2014but union with Christ.\nPicture a large circle, from the edge of which are many lines all\nrunning to the center. The nearer these lines approach the center, the\nnearer they are to one another.\nThus it is in the Christian life. The closer we come to Christ, the\nnearer we shall be to one another. God is glorified as His people\nunite in harmonious action.8\nLet Each Help the Other\u2014The family firm is a sacred, social\nsociety, in which each member is to act a part, each helping the other.\nThe work of the household is to move smoothly, like the different\nparts of well-regulated machinery.9\n138 The Adventist Home\nEvery member of the family should realize that a responsibility\nrests upon him individually to do his part in adding to the comfort,\norder, and regularity of the family. One should not work against\nanother. All should unitedly engage in the good work of encourag-\ning one another; they should exercise gentleness, forbearance, and\npatience; speak in low, calm tones, shunning confusion; and each\ndoing his utmost to lighten the burdens of the mother....\nEach member of the family should understand just the part he[180]\nis expected to act in union with the others. All, from the child six\nyears old and upward, should understand that it is required of them\nto bear their share of life\u2019s burdens.10\nA Fitting Resolve\u2014I must grow in grace at home and wherever\nI may be, in order to give moral power to all my actions. At home\nI must guard my spirit, my actions, my words. I must give time to\npersonal culture, to training and educating myself in right principles.\nI must be an example to others. I must meditate upon the word of\nGod night and day and bring it into my practical life. The sword of\nthe Spirit, which is the word of God, is the only sword which I can\nsafely use.11\n1Manuscript 1, 1855.\n2Letter 17, 1895.\n3Manuscript 18, 1891.\n4Manuscript 38, 1895.\n5Manuscript 53, 1912.\n6Letter 133, 1904.\n7Letter 198, 1901.\n8Letter 49, 1904.\n9Manuscript 129, 1903.\n10Testimonies for the Church 2:699, 700.\n11Manuscript 13, 1891.\nChapter 28\u2014The Child\u2019s First School [181]\nGod\u2019s Original Plan for Education\u2014The system of education\nestablished in Eden centered in the family. Adam was \u201cthe son of\nGod\u201d (Luke 3:38), and it was from their Father that the children of\nthe Highest received instruction. Theirs, in the truest sense, was a\nfamily school.\nIn the divine plan of education as adapted to man\u2019s condition\nafter the fall, Christ stands as the representative of the Father, the\nconnecting link between God and man; He is the great teacher of\nmankind. And He ordained that men and women should be His\nrepresentatives. The family was the school, and the parents were the\nteachers.\nThe education centering in the family was that which prevailed\nin the days of the patriarchs. For the schools thus established, God\nprovided the conditions most favorable for the development of char-\nacter. The people who were under His direction still pursued the\nplan of life that He had appointed in the beginning. Those who\ndeparted from God built for themselves cities, and, congregating\nin them, gloried in the splendor, the luxury, and the vice that make\nthe cities of today the world\u2019s pride and its curse. But the men who\nheld fast God\u2019s principles of life dwelt among the fields and hills.\nThey were tillers of the soil and keepers of flocks and herds; and in\nthis free, independent life, with its opportunities for labor and study\nand meditation, they learned of God and taught their children of His\nworks and ways. This was the method of education that God desired\nto establish in Israel.1\nIn ordinary life the family was both a school and a church, the [182]\nparents being the instructors in secular and in religious lines.2\nThe Family Circle a School\u2014In His wisdom the Lord has de-\ncreed that the family shall be the greatest of all educational agencies.\nIt is in the home that the education of the child is to begin. Here is\nhis first school. Here, with his parents as instructors, he is to learn\nthe lessons that are to guide him throughout life\u2014lessons of respect,\n139\n140 The Adventist Home\nobedience, reverence, self-control. The educational influences of\nthe home are a decided power for good or for evil. They are in\nmany respects silent and gradual, but if exerted on the right side,\nthey become a far-reaching power for truth and righteousness. If the\nchild is not instructed aright here, Satan will educate him through\nagencies of his choosing. How important, then, is the school in the\nhome!3\nLook upon the family circle as a training school, where you are\npreparing your children for the performance of their duties at home,\nin society, and in the church.4\nHome Education First in Importance\u2014It is a sad fact, almost\nuniversally admitted and deplored, that the home education and\ntraining of the youth of today have been neglected.5\nThere is no more important field of effort than that committed\nto the founders and guardians of the home. No work entrusted to\nhuman beings involves greater or more far-reaching results than does\nthe work of fathers and mothers.\nIt is by the youth and children of today that the future of society\nis to be determined, and what these youth and children shall be\ndepends upon the home. To the lack of right home training may be[183]\ntraced the larger share of the disease and misery and crime that curse\nhumanity. If the home life were pure and true, if the children who\nwent forth from its care were prepared to meet life\u2019s responsibilities\nand dangers, what a change would be seen in the world!6\nAll Else to Be Secondary\u2014Every child brought into the world\nis the property of Jesus Christ, and should be educated by precept\nand example to love and obey God; but by far the largest number of\nparents have neglected their God-given work, by failing to educate\nand train their children, from the first dawning of reason, to know and\nlove Christ. By painstaking effort parents are to watch the opening,\nreceptive mind and make everything in the home life secondary to\nthe positive duty enjoined upon them by God\u2014to train their children\nin the nurture and admonition of the Lord.7\nParents should not permit business cares, worldly customs and\nmaxims, and fashion to have a controlling power over them, so that\nthey neglect their children in babyhood and fail to give their children\nproper instruction as they increase in years.8\nChild\u2019s First School 141\nOne great reason why there is so much evil in the world today\nis that parents occupy their minds with other things than that which\nis all-important\u2014how to adapt themselves to the work of patiently\nand kindly teaching their children the way of the Lord. If the curtain\ncould be drawn aside, we should see that many, many children who\nhave gone astray have been lost to good influences through this\nneglect. Parents, can you afford to have it so in your experience?\nYou should have no work so important that it will prevent you from\ngiving to your children all the time that is necessary to make them [184]\nunderstand what it means to obey and trust the Lord fully....\nAnd what will you reap as a reward of your effort? You will find\nyour children right by your side, willing to take hold and co-operate\nwith you in the lines that you suggest. You will find your work made\neasy.9\nGod\u2019s Teaching Agents in the Home School\u2014Parents should\nin a special sense regard themselves as agents of God to instruct\ntheir children, as did Abraham, to keep the way of the Lord. They\nneed to search the Scriptures diligently, to know what is the way\nof the Lord, that they may teach it to their household. Micah says,\n\u201cWhat doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love\nmercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\u201d [Micah 6:8.] In order\nto be teachers, parents must be learners, gathering light constantly\nfrom the oracles of God and by precept and example bringing this\nprecious light into the education of their children.10\nFrom the light that God has given me, I know that the husband\nand the wife are to be in the home minister, physician, nurse, and\nteacher, binding their children to themselves and to God, training\nthem to avoid every habit that will in any way militate against God\u2019s\nwork in the body, and teaching them to care for every part of the\nliving organism.11\nThe mother must ever stand pre-eminent in this work of train-\ning the children; while grave and important duties rest upon the\nfather, the mother, by almost constant association with her children,\nespecially during their tender years, must always be their special\ninstructor and companion. She should take great care to cultivate\nneatness and order in her children, to direct them in forming correct\nhabits and tastes; she should train them to be industrious, self-reliant, [185]\n142 The Adventist Home\nand helpful to others; to live and act and labor as though always in\nthe sight of God.12\nThe elder sisters can exert a strong influence upon the younger\nmembers of the family. The younger, witnessing the example of\nthe older, will be led more by the principle of imitation than by oft-\nrepeated precepts. The eldest daughter should ever feel it a Christian\nduty devolving upon her to aid the mother in bearing her many\ntoilsome burdens.13\nParents should be much at home. By precept and example they\nshould teach their children the love and the fear of God; teach them\nto be intelligent, social, affectionate; to cultivate habits of industry,\neconomy, and self-denial. By giving their children love, sympathy,\nand encouragement at home, parents may provide for them a safe\nand welcome retreat from many of the world\u2019s temptations.14\nPreparation for the Church School\u2014It is in the home school\nthat our boys and girls are to be prepared to attend the church school.\nParents should constantly keep this in mind and, as teachers in the\nhome, should consecrate every power of the being to God, that they\nmay fulfill their high and holy mission. Diligent, faithful instruction\nin the home is the best preparation that children can receive for\nschool life.15\nGod\u2019s Injunctions to Be Paramount\u2014We have Bible rules for\nthe guidance of all, both parents and children, a high and holy stan-\ndard from which there can be no swerving. God\u2019s injunctions must\nbe paramount. Let the father and mother of the family spread out\nGod\u2019s word before Him, the searcher of hearts, and ask in sincerity,\n\u201cWhat hath God said?\u201d16\nTeach your children to love truth because it is truth, and because[186]\nthey are to be sanctified through the truth and fitted to stand in the\ngrand review that shall erelong determine whether they are qualified\nto enter into higher work and become members of the royal family,\nchildren of the heavenly King.17\nPrepare for the Coming Conflict \u2014Satan is marshaling his\nhosts; and are we individually prepared for the fearful conflict that\nis just before us? Are we preparing our children for the great crisis?\nAre we preparing ourselves and our households to understand the\nposition of our adversaries and their modes of warfare? Are our\nchildren forming habits of decision, that they may be firm and un-\nChild\u2019s First School 143\nyielding in every matter of principle and duty? I pray that we all\nmay understand the signs of the times, and that we may so prepare\nourselves and our children that in the time of conflict God may be\nour refuge and defense.18\n1Education, 33, 34.\n2Ibid., 41.\n3Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 107.\n4The Signs of the Times, September 10, 1894.\n5The Review and Herald, August 30, 1881.\n6The Ministry of Healing, 351.\n7Manuscript 12b, 1896.\n8The Signs of the Times, September 17, 1894.\n9Manuscript 53, 1912.\n10Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 145.\n11Manuscript 100, 1902.\n12Pacific Health Journal, January, 1890.\n13Testimonies for the Church 3:337.\n14Fundamentals of Christian Education, 65.\n15Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 150.\n16The Review and Herald, September 15, 1891.\n17The Signs of the Times, September 10, 1894.\n18The Review and Herald, April 23, 1889.\nChapter 29\u2014A Work That Cannot Be Transferred[187]\nParental Responsibilities Which No One Else Can Bear \u2014\nParents, you carry responsibilities that no one can bear for you. As\nlong as you live, you are accountable to God to keep His way....\nParents who make the word of God their guide, and who realize how\nmuch their children depend upon them for the characters they form,\nwill set an example that it will be safe for their children to follow.1\nFathers and mothers are responsible for the health, the consti-\ntution, the development of the character of their children. No one\nelse should be left to see to this work. In becoming the parents\nof children, it devolves upon you to co-operate with the Lord in\neducating them in sound principles.2\nHow sad it is that many parents have cast off their God-given\nresponsibility to their children, and are willing that strangers should\nbear it for them! They are willing that others should labor for their\nchildren and relieve them of all burden in the matter.3\nMany who are now bemoaning the waywardness of their children\nhave only themselves to blame. Let these look to their Bibles and\nsee what God enjoins upon them as parents and guardians. Let them\ntake up their long-neglected duties. They need to humble themselves\nand to repent before God for their neglect to follow His directions in\nthe training of their children. They need to change their own course\nof action and to follow the Bible strictly and carefully as their guide\nand counselor.4\nThe Church Alone Cannot Assume These Responsibilities\u2014[188]\nOh, that the youth and children would give their hearts to Christ!\nWhat an army might then be raised up to win others to righteousness!\nBut parents should not leave this work for the church to do alone.5\nNor Can the Minister\u2014You roll vast responsibilities upon the\npreacher and hold him accountable for the souls of your children;\nbut you do not sense your own responsibility as parents and as\ninstructors.... Your sons and daughters are corrupted by your own\nexample and lax precepts; and, notwithstanding this lack of domestic\n144\nWork That Cannot Be Transferred 145\ntraining, you expect the minister to counteract your daily work and\naccomplish the wonderful achievement of training their hearts and\nlives to virtue and piety. After the minister has done all he can do for\nthe church by faithful, affectionate admonition, patient discipline,\nand fervent prayer to reclaim and save the soul, yet is not successful,\nthe fathers and mothers often blame him because their children are\nnot converted, when it may be because of their own neglect. The\nburden rests with the parents; and will they take up the work that God\nhas entrusted to them and with fidelity perform it? Will they move\nonward and upward, working in a humble, patient, persevering way\nto reach the exalted standard themselves and to bring their children\nup with them?6\nAre not many fathers and mothers placing their responsibilities\ninto others\u2019 hands? Do not many of them think that the minister\nshould take the burden and see to it that their children are converted\nand that the seal of God is placed upon them?\u201d7\nNor Can the Sabbath School \u2014It is their [the parents\u2019] privi-\nlege to help their children obtain that knowledge which they may [189]\ncarry with them into the future life. But for some reason many par-\nents dislike to give their children religious instruction. They leave\nthem to pick up in Sabbath school the knowledge they should impart\nconcerning their responsibility to God. Such parents need to under-\nstand that God desires them to educate, discipline, and train their\nchildren, ever keeping before them the fact that they are forming\ncharacters for the present and the future life.8\nDo not depend upon the teachers of the Sabbath school to do\nyour work of training your children in the way they should go. The\nSabbath school is a great blessing; it may help you in your work, but\nit can never take your place. God has given to all fathers and mothers\nthe responsibility of bringing their children to Jesus, teaching them\nhow to pray and believe in the word of God.\nIn the education of your children lay not the grand truths of\nthe Bible to one side, supposing that the Sabbath school and the\nminister will do your neglected work. The Bible is not too sacred and\nsublime to be opened daily and studied diligently. The truths of the\nword of God are to be brought into contact with the supposed little\nthings of life. If rightly regarded they will brighten the common life,\n146 The Adventist Home\nsupplying motives for obedience and principles for the formation of\na right character.9\n1Letter 356, 1907.\n2Manuscript 126, 1897.\n3The Review and Herald, October 25, 1892.\n4Manuscript 57, 1897.\n5The Signs of the Times, August 13, 1896.\n6Testimonies for the Church 5:494, 495.\n7The Review and Herald, May 21, 1895.\n8The Review and Herald, June 6, 1899.\n9Manuscript 5, 1896.\nChapter 30\u2014Family Companionship [190]\nParents to Become Acquainted With Children \u2014Some par-\nents do not understand their children and are not really acquainted\nwith them. There is often a great distance between parents and\nchildren. If the parents would enter more fully into the feelings of\ntheir children and draw out what is in their hearts, it would have a\nbeneficial influence upon them.1\nThe father and the mother should work together in full sympathy\nwith each other. They should make themselves companions to their\nchildren.2\nParents should study the best and most successful manner of\nwinning the love and confidence of their children, that they may lead\nthem in the right path. They should reflect the sunshine of love upon\nthe household.3\nEncouragement and Commendation \u2014Young children love\ncompanionship and can seldom enjoy themselves alone. They yearn\nfor sympathy and tenderness. That which they enjoy they think will\nplease mother also, and it is natural for them to go to her with their\nlittle joys and sorrows. The mother should not wound their sensitive\nhearts by treating with indifference matters that, though trifling to\nher, are of great importance to them. Her sympathy and approval\nare precious. An approving glance, a word of encouragement or\ncommendation, will be like sunshine in their hearts, often making\nthe whole day happy.4\nParents to Be Child\u2019s Confidants\u2014Parents should encourage\ntheir children to confide in them and unburden to them their heart [191]\ngriefs, their little daily annoyances and trials.5\nKindly instruct them and bind them to your hearts. It is a critical\ntime for children. Influences will be thrown around them to wean\nthem from you which you must counteract. Teach them to make you\ntheir confidant. Let them whisper in your ear their trials and joys.6\nChildren would be saved from many evils if they would be more\nfamiliar with their parents. Parents should encourage in their children\n147\n148 The Adventist Home\na disposition to be open and frank with them, to come to them with\ntheir difficulties and, when they are perplexed as to what course is\nright, to lay the matter just as they view it before the parents and\nask their advice. Who are so well calculated to see and point out\ntheir dangers as godly parents? Who can understand the peculiar\ntemperaments of their own children as well as they? The mother\nwho has watched every turn of the mind from infancy, and is thus\nacquainted with the natural disposition, is best prepared to counsel\nher children. Who can tell as well what traits of character to check\nand restrain as the mother, aided by the father?7\n\u201cNo Time\u201d\u2014\u201cNo time,\u201d says the father; \u201cI have no time to\ngive to the training of my children, no time for social and domestic\nenjoyments.\u201d Then you should not have taken upon yourself the\nresponsibility of a family. By withholding from them the time which\nis justly theirs, you rob them of the education which they should\nhave at your hands. If you have children, you have a work to do, in\nunion with the mother, in the formation of their characters.8\nIt is the cry of many mothers: \u201cI have no time to be with my\nchildren.\u201d Then for Christ\u2019s sake spend less time on your dress.[192]\nNeglect if you will to adorn your apparel. Neglect to receive and\nmake calls. Neglect to cook an endless variety of dishes. But\nnever, never neglect your children. What is the chaff to the wheat?\nLet nothing interpose between you and the best interests of your\nchildren.9\nBurdened with many cares, mothers sometimes feel that they\ncannot take time patiently to instruct their little ones and give them\nlove and sympathy. But they should remember that if the children\ndo not find in their parents and in their home that which will satisfy\ntheir desire for sympathy and companionship, they will look to other\nsources, where both mind and character may be endangered.10\nWith Your Children in Work and Play\u2014Give some of your\nleisure hours to your children; associate with them in their work and\nin their sports, and win their confidence. Cultivate their friendship.11\nLet parents devote the evenings to their families. Lay off care\nand perplexity with the labors of the day.12\nCounsel to Reserved, Dictatorial Parents \u2014There is danger\nof both parents and teachers commanding and dictating too much,\nwhile they fail to come sufficiently into social relation with their\nFamily Companionship 149\nchildren or scholars. They often hold themselves too much reserved\nand exercise their authority in a cold, unsympathizing manner which\ncannot win the hearts of their children and pupils. If they would\ngather the children close to them and show that they love them, and\nwould manifest an interest in all their efforts and even in their sports,\nsometimes even being a child among children, they would make\nthe children very happy and would gain their love and win their\nconfidence. And the children would sooner respect and love the [193]\nauthority of their parents and teachers.13\nEvil Associates as Competitors of the Home \u2014Satan and his\nhost are making most powerful efforts to sway the minds of the\nchildren, and they must be treated with candor, Christian tenderness,\nand love. This will give you a strong influence over them, and they\nwill feel that they can repose unlimited confidence in you. Throw\naround your children the charms of home and of your society. If\nyou do this, they will not have so much desire for the society of\nyoung associates.... Because of the evils now in the world, and the\nrestriction necessary to be placed upon the children, parents should\nhave double care to bind them to their hearts and let them see that\nthey wish to make them happy.14\nParents to Be Acquainted With Their Children\u2014No barrier\nof coldness and reserve should be allowed to arise between parents\nand children. Let parents become acquainted with their children,\nseeking to understand their tastes and dispositions, entering into\ntheir feelings, and drawing out what is in their hearts.\nParents, let your children see that you love them and will do all\nin your power to make them happy. If you do so, your necessary\nrestrictions will have far greater weight in their young minds. Rule\nyour children with tenderness and compassion, remembering that\n\u201ctheir angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in\nheaven.\u201d If you desire the angels to do for your children the work\ngiven them of God, co-operate with them by doing your part.\nBrought up under the wise and loving guidance of a true home,\nchildren will have no desire to wander away in search of pleasure and [194]\ncompanionship. Evil will not attract them. The spirit that prevails\nin the home will mold their characters; they will form habits and\nprinciples that will be a strong defense against temptation when they\nshall leave the home shelter and take their place in the world.15\n150 The Adventist Home\n1Testimonies for the Church 1:395.\n2Manuscript 45, 1912.\n3The Review and Herald, August 30, 1881.\n4The Ministry of Healing, 388.\n5Testimonies for the Church 1:391.\n6Testimonies for the Church 1:387.\n7Testimonies for the Church 1:392.\n8Fundamentals of Christian Education, 65, 66.\n9The Signs of the Times, April 3, 1901.\n10The Ministry of Healing, 389.\n11Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 124.\n12Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 65.\n13Testimonies for the Church 3:134, 135.\n14Ibid., 1:387, 388.\n15The Ministry of Healing, 394.\nChapter 31\u2014Security Through Love [195]\nThe Power of Love\u2019s Ministry\u2014Love\u2019s agencies have wonder-\nful power, for they are divine. The soft answer that \u201cturneth away\nwrath,\u201d the love that \u201csuffereth long, and is kind,\u201d the charity that\n\u201ccovereth a multitude of sins\u201d\u2014would we learn the lesson, with\nwhat power for healing would our lives be gifted! How life would\nbe transformed and the earth become a very likeness and foretaste\nof heaven!\nThese precious lessons may be so simply taught as to be un-\nderstood even by little children. The heart of the child is tender\nand easily impressed; and when we who are older become \u201cas little\nchildren,\u201d when we learn the simplicity and gentleness and tender\nlove of the Saviour, we shall not find it difficult to touch the hearts\nof the little ones and teach them love\u2019s ministry of healing.1\nFrom a worldly point of view, money is power; but from the\nChristian standpoint, love is power. Intellectual and spiritual strength\nare involved in this principle. Pure love has special efficacy to do\ngood, and can do nothing but good. It prevents discord and misery\nand brings the truest happiness. Wealth is often an influence to\ncorrupt and destroy; force is strong to do hurt; but truth and goodness\nare the properties of pure love.2\nLove Is a Plant to Be Nourished\u2014Home is to be the center of\nthe purest and most elevated affection. Peace, harmony, affection,\nand happiness should be perseveringly cherished every day, until\nthese precious things abide in the hearts of those who compose the\nfamily. The plant of love must be carefully nourished, else it will die. [196]\nEvery good principle must be cherished if we would have it thrive\nin the soul. That which Satan plants in the heart\u2014envy, jealousy,\nevil surmising, evil speaking, impatience, prejudice, selfishness,\ncovetousness, and vanity\u2014must be uprooted. If these evil things are\nallowed to remain in the soul, they will bear fruit by which many\nshall be defiled. Oh, how many cultivate the poisonous plants that\nkill out the precious fruits of love and defile the soul!3\n151\n152 The Adventist Home\nRemember Your Own Childhood\u2014Do not treat your children\nonly with sternness, forgetting your own childhood and forgetting\nthat they are but children. Do not expect them to be perfect or try\nto make them men and women in their acts at once. By so doing,\nyou will close the door of access which you might otherwise have\nto them and will drive them to open a door for injurious influences,\nfor others to poison their young minds before you awake to their\ndanger....\nParents should not forget their childhood years, how much they\nyearned for sympathy and love, and how unhappy they felt when\ncensured and fretfully chided. They should be young again in their\nfeelings, and bring their minds down to understand the wants of their\nchildren.4\nThey need gentle, encouraging words. How easy it is for mothers\nto speak words of kindness and affection which will send a sunbeam\nto the hearts of the little ones, causing them to forget their troubles!5\nParents, give your children love: love in babyhood, love in\nchildhood, love in youth. Do not give them frowns, but ever keep a\nsunshiny countenance.6\nKeep Children in a Sunny Atmosphere\u2014The little ones must[197]\nbe carefully soothed when in trouble. Children between babyhood\nand manhood and womanhood do not generally receive the attention\nthat they should have. Mothers are needed who will so guide their\nchildren that they will regard themselves as a part of the family. Let\nthe mother talk with her children regarding their hopes and their\nperplexities. Let parents remember that their children are to be\ncared for in preference to strangers. They are to be kept in a sunny\natmosphere, under the mother\u2019s guidance.7\nHelp your children to gain victories.... Surround them with an\natmosphere of love. Thus you can subdue their stubborn disposi-\ntions.8\nWhen Children Need Love Rather Than Food\u2014Many moth-\ners shamefully neglect their children that they may gain time to\nembroider the clothing or to put needless trimming upon the little\ngarments of their children. When the children are tired and really\nneed their care, they are neglected or given something to eat. They\nnot only did not need the food but it was a positive injury to them.\nWhat they did need was the mother\u2019s soothing embrace. Every\nSecurity Through Love 153\nmother should have time to give her children these little endear-\nments which are so essential during infancy and childhood. In this\nway the mother would bind up the children\u2019s hearts and happiness\nwith her own. She is to them what God is to us.9\nReasonable Desires to Be Gratified\u2014You should ever impress\nupon your children the fact that you love them; that you are laboring\nfor their interest; that their happiness is dear to you; and that you\ndesign to do only that which is for their good. You should gratify [198]\ntheir little wants whenever you can reasonably do so.10\nNever act from impulse in governing children. Let authority\nand affection be blended. Cherish and cultivate all that is good and\nlovely, and lead them to desire the higher good by revealing Christ to\nthem. While you deny them those things that would be an injury to\nthem, let them see that you love them and want to make them happy.\nThe more unlovely they are, the greater pains you should take to\nreveal your love for them. When the child has confidence that you\nwant to make him happy, love will break every barrier down. This is\nthe principle of the Saviour\u2019s dealing with man; it is the principle\nthat must be brought into the church.11\nLove Should Be Expressed\u2014In many families there is a great\nlack in expressing affection one for another. While there is no need\nof sentimentalism, there is need of expressing love and tenderness in\na chaste, pure, dignified way. Many absolutely cultivate hardness of\nheart and in word and action reveal the satanic side of the character.\nTender affection should ever be cherished between husband and\nwife, parents and children, brothers and sisters. Every hasty word\nshould be checked, and there should not be even the appearance of\nthe lack of love one for another. It is the duty of everyone in the\nfamily to be pleasant, to speak kindly.12\nCultivate tenderness, affection, and love that have expression in\nlittle courtesies, in speech, in thoughtful attentions.13\nThe best way to educate children to respect their father and\nmother is to give them the opportunity of seeing the father offering\nkindly attentions to the mother and the mother rendering respect\nand reverence to the father. It is by beholding love in their parents [199]\nthat children are led to obey the fifth commandment and to heed\nthe injunction, \u201cChildren, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is\nright.\u201d14\n154 The Adventist Home\nThe Love of Jesus to Be Mirrored in the Parents\u2014When the\nmother has gained the confidence of her children and taught them to\nlove and obey her, she has given them the first lesson in the Christian\nlife. They must love and trust and obey their Saviour as they love\nand trust and obey their parents. The love which in faithful care and\nright training the parent manifests for the child faintly mirrors the\nlove of Jesus for His faithful people.15\n1Education, 114.\n2Testimonies for the Church 4:138.\n3The Signs of the Times, June 20, 1911.\n4Testimonies for the Church 1:387, 388.\n5The Review and Herald, July 9, 1901.\n6Manuscript 129, 1898.\n7Manuscript 127, 1898.\n8Manuscript 114, 1903.\n9Manuscript 43, 1900.\n10Testimonies for the Church 4:140.\n11Manuscript 4, 1893.\n12The Signs of the Times, November 14, 1892.\n13The Youth\u2019s Instructor, April 21, 1886.\n14The Review and Herald, November 15, 1892.\n15The Signs of the Times, April 4, 1911.\nChapter 32\u2014Preoccupy the Garden of the Heart [200]\nParents as Gardeners \u2014The Lord has entrusted to parents a\nsolemn, sacred work. They are to cultivate carefully the soil of the\nheart. Thus they may be laborers together with God. He expects\nthem to guard and tend carefully the garden of their children\u2019s hearts.\nThey are to sow the good seed, weeding out every unsightly weed.\nEvery defect in character, every fault in disposition, needs to be\ncut away; for if allowed to remain, these will mar the beauty of the\ncharacter.1\nParents, your own home is the first field in which you are called\nto labor. The precious plants in the home garden demand your first\ncare. To you it is appointed to watch for souls as they that must give\naccount. Carefully consider your work, its nature, its bearing, and\nits results.2\nYou have before your own door a little plot of ground to care for,\nand God will hold you responsible for this work which He has left\nin your hands.3\nTending the Garden\u2014The prevailing influence in the world is\nto suffer the youth to follow the natural turn of their own minds.\nAnd if very wild in youth, parents say they will come right after a\nwhile and, when sixteen or eighteen years of age, will reason for\nthemselves and leave off their wrong habits and become at last useful\nmen and women. What a mistake! For years they permit an enemy\nto sow the garden of the heart; they suffer wrong principles to grow, [201]\nand in many cases all the labor afterward bestowed on that soil will\navail nothing....\nSome parents have suffered their children to form wrong habits,\nthe marks of which may be seen all through life. Upon the parents\nlies this sin. These children may profess to be Christians; yet without\na special work of grace upon the heart and a thorough reform in life,\ntheir past habits will be seen in all their experience, and they will\nexhibit just the character which their parents allowed them to form.4\n155\n156 The Adventist Home\nThe young should not be suffered to learn good and evil indis-\ncriminately, with the idea that at some future time the good will\npredominate and the evil lose its influence. The evil will increase\nfaster than the good. It is possible that after many years the evil\nthey have learned may be eradicated; but who will venture this?\nTime is short. It is easier and much safer to sow clean, good seed\nin the hearts of your children than to pluck up the weeds afterward.\nImpressions made upon the minds of the young are hard to efface.\nHow important, then, that these impressions be of the right sort, that\nthe elastic faculties of youth be bent in the right direction.5\nSeed Sowing, Weeding\u2014In the earliest years of the child\u2019s life\nthe soil of the heart should be carefully prepared for the showers of\nGod\u2019s grace. Then the seeds of truth are to be carefully sown and\ndiligently tended. And God, who rewards every effort made in His\nname, will put life into the seed sown; and there will appear first the\nblade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear.\nToo often, because of the wicked neglect of parents, Satan sows\nhis seeds in the hearts of children, and a harvest of shame and\nsorrow is borne. The world today is destitute of true goodness\nbecause parents have failed to gather their children to themselves[202]\nin the home. They have not kept them from association with the\ncareless and reckless. Therefore the children have gone forth into\nthe world to sow the seeds of death.6\nThe great work of instruction, of weeding out worthless and\npoisonous weeds, is a most important one. For if left to themselves,\nthese weeds will grow until they choke out the precious plants of\nmoral principle and truth.7\nIf a field is left uncultivated, a crop of noxious weeds is sure\nto appear which will be very difficult to exterminate. Then the\nsoil must be worked and the weeds subdued before the precious\nplants can grow. Before these valuable plants can grow, the seed\nmust first be carefully sown. If mothers neglect the sowing of the\nprecious seed and then expect a harvest of precious grain, they will\nbe disappointed; for they will reap briars and thorns. Satan is ever\nwatching, prepared to sow seeds which will spring up and bear a\nplentiful harvest after his own satanic character.8\nEternal vigilance must be manifested with regard to our children.\nWith his manifold devices Satan begins to work with their tempers\nPreoccupy the Garden of the Heart 157\nand their wills as soon as they are born. Their safety depends upon\nthe wisdom and the vigilant care of the parents. They must strive\nin the love and fear of God to preoccupy the garden of the heart,\nsowing the good seeds of a right spirit, correct habits, and the love\nand fear of God.9\nUnfolding Natural Beauty\u2014Parents and teachers should seek\nmost earnestly for that wisdom which Jesus is ever ready to give;\nfor they are dealing with human minds at the most interesting and\nimpressible period of their development. They should aim so to\ncultivate the tendencies of the youth that at each stage of their life\nthey may represent the natural beauty appropriate to that period, [203]\nunfolding gradually, as do the plants and flowers in the garden.10\n1Manuscript 138, 1898.\n2The Signs of the Times, July 1, 1886.\n3The Review and Herald, September 15, 1891.\n4Testimonies for the Church 1:403.\n5Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 138, 139.\n6Manuscript 49, 1901.\n7The Review and Herald, April 14, 1885.\n8Manuscript 43, 1900.\n9Manuscript 7, 1899.\n10Testimonies for the Church 6:204, 205.\nChapter 33\u2014Promises of Divine Guidance[204]\nHow Sweet the Consciousness of a Divine Friend\u2014Your com-\npassionate Redeemer is watching you with love and sympathy, ready\nto hear your prayers and to render you the assistance which you need.\nHe knows the burdens of every mother\u2019s heart and is her best friend\nin every emergency. His everlasting arms support the God-fearing,\nfaithful mother. When upon earth, He had a mother that struggled\nwith poverty, having many anxious cares and perplexities, and He\nsympathizes with every Christian mother in her cares and anxieties.\nThat Saviour who took a long journey for the purpose of relieving\nthe anxious heart of a woman whose daughter was possessed by an\nevil spirit will hear the mother\u2019s prayers and will bless her children.\nHe who gave back to the widow her only son as he was carried\nto the burial is touched today by the woe of the bereaved mother.\nHe who wept tears of sympathy at the grave of Lazarus and gave\nback to Martha and Mary their buried brother; who pardoned Mary\nMagdalene; who remembered His mother when He was hanging\nin agony upon the cross; who appeared to the weeping women and\nmade them His messengers to spread the first glad tidings of a risen\nSaviour\u2014He is woman\u2019s best friend today and is ready to aid her in\nall the relations of life.1\nNo work can equal that of the Christian mother. She takes up\nher work with a sense of what it is to bring up her children in the\nnurture and admonition of the Lord. How often will she feel her\nburden\u2019s weight heavier than she can bear; and then how precious the[205]\nprivilege of taking it all to her sympathizing Saviour in prayer! She\nmay lay her burden at His feet and find in His presence a strength\nthat will sustain her and give her cheerfulness, hope, courage, and\nwisdom in the most trying hours. How sweet to the careworn mother\nis the consciousness of such a friend in all her difficulties! If mothers\nwould go to Christ more frequently and trust Him more fully, their\nburdens would be easier, and they would find rest to their souls.2\n158\nPromises of Divine Guidance 159\nThe God of Heaven Hears Your Prayers\u2014You cannot bring\nup your children as you should without divine help; for the fallen\nnature of Adam always strives for the mastery. The heart must be\nprepared for the principles of truth, that they may root in the soul\nand find nourishment in the life.3\nParents may understand that as they follow God\u2019s directions in\nthe training of their children, they will receive help from on high.\nThey receive much benefit; for as they teach, they learn. Their\nchildren will achieve victories through the knowledge that they\nhave acquired in keeping the way of the Lord. They are enabled to\novercome natural and hereditary tendencies to evil.4\nParents, are you working with unflagging energy in behalf of\nyour children? The God of heaven marks your solicitude, your\nearnest work, your constant watchfulness. He hears your prayers.\nWith patience and tenderness train your children for the Lord. All\nheaven is interested in your work.... God will unite with you, crown-\ning your efforts with success.5\nAs you try to make plain the truths of salvation, and point the\nchildren to Christ as a personal Saviour, angels will be by your side.\nThe Lord will give to fathers and mothers grace to interest their little [206]\nones in the precious story of the Babe of Bethlehem, who is indeed\nthe hope of the world.6\nAsk and Receive \u2014In their important work parents must ask\nand receive divine aid. Even if the character, habits, and practices\nof parents have been cast in an inferior mold, if the lessons given\nthem in childhood and youth have led to an unhappy development\nof character, they need not despair. The converting power of God\ncan transform inherited and cultivated tendencies; for the religion of\nJesus is uplifting. \u201cBorn again\u201d means a transformation, a new birth\nin Christ Jesus.7\nLet us instruct our children in the teachings of the word. If you\nwill call, the Lord will answer you. He will say, Here I am; what\nwould you have Me do for you? Heaven is linked with earth that\nevery soul may be enabled to fulfill his mission. The Lord loves\nthese children. He wants them brought up with an understanding of\ntheir high calling.8\nThe Holy Spirit Will Guide\u2014The mother should feel her need\nof the Holy Spirit\u2019s guidance, that she herself may have a genuine\n160 The Adventist Home\nexperience in submission to the way and will of God. Then, through\nthe grace of Christ, she can be a wise, gentle, loving teacher.9\nChrist has made every provision that every parent who will be\ncontrolled by the Holy Spirit will be given strength and grace to be a\nteacher in the home. This education and discipline in the home will\nhave a molding and fashioning influence.10\nDivine Power Will Unite With Human Effort \u2014Without hu-\nman effort divine effort is in vain. God will work with power when[207]\nin trustful dependence upon Him parents will awake to the sacred re-\nsponsibility resting upon them and seek to train their children aright.\nHe will co-operate with those parents who carefully and prayerfully\neducate their children, working out their own and their children\u2019s\nsalvation. He will work in them to will and to do of His own good\npleasure.11\nHuman effort alone will not result in helping your children to\nperfect a character for heaven; but with divine help a grand and holy\nwork may be accomplished.12\nWhen you take up your duties as a parent in the strength of God,\nwith a firm determination never to relax your efforts nor to leave\nyour post of duty in striving to make your children what God would\nhave them, then God looks down upon you with approbation. He\nknows that you are doing the best you can, and He will increase your\npower. He will Himself do the part of the work that the mother or\nfather cannot do; He will work with the wise, patient, well-directed\nefforts of the God-fearing mother. Parents, God does not propose\nto do the work that He has left for you to do in your home. You\nmust not give up to indolence and be slothful servants, if you would\nhave your children saved from the perils that surround them in the\nworld.13\nCling to Jesus When Trials Come\u2014Parents, gather the rays of\ndivine light which are shining upon your pathway. Walk in the light\nas Christ is in the light. As you take up the work of saving your\nchildren and maintaining your position on the highway of holiness,\nthe most provoking trials will come. But do not lose your hold. Cling\nto Jesus. He says, \u201cLet him take hold of My strength, that he may\nmake peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.\u201d Difficulties[208]\nwill arise. You will meet with obstacles. Look constantly to Jesus.\nWhen an emergency arises, ask, Lord, what shall I do now?14\nPromises of Divine Guidance 161\nThe harder the battle, the greater their [parents] need of help\nfrom their heavenly Father, and the more marked will be the victory\ngained.15\nThen Work in Faith.\u2014Patiently, lovingly, as faithful stewards\nof the manifold grace of Christ, parents are to do their appointed\nwork. It is expected of them that they will be found faithful. Every-\nthing is to be done in faith. Constantly they must pray that God will\nimpart His grace to their children. Never must they become weary,\nimpatient, or fretful in their work. They must cling closely to their\nchildren and to God. If parents work in patience and love, earnestly\nendeavoring to help their children to reach the highest standard of\npurity and modesty, they will succeed.16\n1The Signs of the Times, September 9, 1886.\n2The Signs of the Times, September 13, 1877.\n3The Review and Herald, October 25, 1892.\n4The Review and Herald, June 6, 1899.\n5The Review and Herald, January 29, 1901.\n6The Desire of Ages, 517.\n7The Review and Herald, April 13, 1897.\n8Manuscript 31, 1909.\n9Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 128.\n10Manuscript 36, 1899.\n11The Signs of the Times, September 25, 1901.\n12The Review and Herald, October 25, 1892.\n13The Review and Herald, July 10, 1888.\n14Manuscript 67, 1901.\n15The Review and Herald, August 30, 1881.\n16Manuscript 138, 1898.\n162 The Adventist Home\nSection 9\u2014Father\u2014The House-Band [209]\nChapter 34\u2014Father\u2019s Position and Responsibilities[210]\n[211]\nTrue Definition of Husband \u2014The home is an institution of\nGod. God designed that the family circle, father, mother, and chil-\ndren, should exist in this world as a firm.1\nThe work of making home happy does not rest upon the mother\nalone. Fathers have an important part to act. The husband is the\nhouse-band of the home treasures, binding by his strong, earnest, de-\nvoted affection the members of the household, mother and children,\ntogether in the strongest bonds of union.2\nHis name, \u201chouse-band,\u201d is the true definition of husband.... I\nsaw that but few fathers realize their responsibility.3\nThe Head of the Family Firm\u2014The husband and father is the\nhead of the household. The wife looks to him for love and sympathy\nand for aid in the training of the children; and this is right. The\nchildren are his as well as hers, and he is equally interested in their\nwelfare. The children look to the father for support and guidance;\nhe needs to have a right conception of life and of the influences and\nassociations that should surround his family; above all, he should be\ncontrolled by the love and fear of God and by the teaching of His\nword, that he may guide the feet of his children in the right way....\nThe father should do his part toward making home happy. What-\never his cares and business perplexities, they should not be permitted\nto overshadow his family; he should enter his home with smiles and[212]\npleasant words.4\nThe Lawmaker and Priest\u2014All members of the family center\nin the father. He is the lawmaker, illustrating in his own manly\nbearing the sterner virtues: energy, integrity, honesty, patience,\ncourage, diligence, and practical usefulness. The father is in one\nsense the priest of the household, laying upon the altar of God the\nmorning and evening sacrifice. The wife and children should be\nencouraged to unite in this offering and also to engage in the song of\npraise. Morning and evening the father, as priest of the household,\nshould confess to God the sins committed by himself and his children\n164\nFather\u2019s Position and Responsibilities 165\nthrough the day. Those sins which have come to his knowledge and\nalso those which are secret, of which God\u2019s eye alone has taken\ncognizance, should be confessed. This rule of action, zealously\ncarried out by the father when he is present or by the mother when\nhe is absent, will result in blessings to the family.5\nThe father represents the divine Lawgiver in his family. He is a\nlaborer together with God, carrying out the gracious designs of God\nand establishing in his children upright principles, enabling them\nto form pure and virtuous characters, because he has preoccupied\nthe soul with that which will enable his children to render obedience\nnot only to their earthly parent but also to their heavenly Father.6\nThe father must not betray his sacred trust. He must not, on any\npoint, yield up his parental authority.7\nTo Walk With God\u2014The father ... will bind his children to the\nthrone of God by living faith. Distrusting his own strength, he hangs\nhis helpless soul on Jesus and takes hold of the strength of the Most [213]\nHigh. Brethren, pray at home, in your family, night and morning;\npray earnestly in your closet; and while engaged in your daily labor,\nlift up the soul to God in prayer. It was thus that Enoch walked with\nGod. The silent, fervent prayer of the soul will rise like holy incense\nto the throne of grace and will be as acceptable to God as if offered\nin the sanctuary. To all who thus seek Him, Christ becomes a present\nhelp in time of need. They will be strong in the day of trial.8\nMaturity of Experience Called For\u2014A father must not be as\na child, moved merely by impulse. He is bound to his family by\nsacred, holy ties.9\nWhat his influence will be in the home will be determined by his\nknowledge of the only true God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent.\n\u201cWhen I was a child,\u201d Paul says, \u201cI spake as a child, I understood as\na child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away\nchildish things.\u201d The father is to stand at the head of his family, not as\nan overgrown, undisciplined boy, but as a man with manly character\nand with his passions controlled. He is to obtain an education in\ncorrect morals. His conduct in his home life is to be directed and\nrestrained by the pure principles of the word of God. Then he will\ngrow up to the full stature of a man in Christ Jesus.10\nSubmit the Will to God\u2014To the man who is a husband and a\nfather, I would say, Be sure that a pure, holy atmosphere surrounds\n166 The Adventist Home\nyour soul.... You are to learn daily of Christ. Never, never are you\nto show a tyrannical spirit in the home. The man who does this is\nworking in partnership with satanic agencies. Bring your will into\nsubmission to the will of God. Do all in your power to make the life[214]\nof your wife pleasant and happy. Take the word of God as the man of\nyour counsel. In the home live out the teachings of the word. Then\nyou will live them out in the church and will take them with you to\nyour place of business. The principles of heaven will ennoble all\nyour transactions. Angels of God will cooperate with you, helping\nyou to reveal Christ to the world.11\nA Fitting Prayer for a Quick-tempered Husband\u2014Do not al-\nlow the vexations of your business to bring darkness into your home\nlife. If, when little things occur that are not exactly as you think they\nshould be, you fail to reveal patience, long forbearance, kindness,\nand love, you show that you have not chosen as a companion Him\nwho so loved you that He gave His life for you, that you might be\none with Him.\nIn the daily life you will meet with sudden surprises, disappoint-\nments, and temptations. What saith the word? \u201cResist the devil,\u201d\nby firm reliance upon God, \u201cand he will flee from you. Draw nigh\nto God, and He will draw nigh to you.\u201d \u201cLet him take hold of My\nstrength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace\nwith Me.\u201d Look unto Jesus at all times and in all places, offering\na silent prayer from a sincere heart that you may know how to do\nHis will. Then when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of\nthe Lord will lift up a standard for you against the enemy. When\nyou are almost ready to yield, to lose patience and self-control, to\nbe hard and denunciatory, to find fault and accuse\u2014this is the time\nfor you to send to heaven the prayer, \u201cHelp me, O God, to resist\ntemptation, to put all bitterness and wrath and evilspeaking out of\nmy heart. Give me Thy meekness, Thy lowliness, Thy long-suf-\nfering, and Thy love. Leave me not to dishonor my Redeemer, to[215]\nmisinterpret the words and motives of my wife, my children, and\nmy brethren and sisters in the faith. Help me that I may be kind,\npitiful, tenderhearted, forgiving. Help me to be a real house-band in\nmy home and to represent the character of Christ to others.\u201d12\nExercise Authority With Humility\u2014It is no evidence of man-\nliness in the husband for him to dwell constantly upon his position\nFather\u2019s Position and Responsibilities 167\nas head of the family. It does not increase respect for him to hear\nhim quoting Scripture to sustain his claims to authority. It will not\nmake him more manly to require his wife, the mother of his chil-\ndren, to act upon his plans as if they were infallible. The Lord has\nconstituted the husband the head of the wife to be her protector; he\nis the house-band of the family, binding the members together, even\nas Christ is the head of the church and the Saviour of the mystical\nbody. Let every husband who claims to love God carefully study the\nrequirements of God in his position. Christ\u2019s authority is exercised in\nwisdom, in all kindness and gentleness; so let the husband exercise\nhis power and imitate the great Head of the church.13\n1Manuscript 36, 1899.\n2The Signs of the Times, September 13, 1877.\n3Testimonies for the Church 1:547.\n4The Ministry of Healing, 390, 392.\n5Testimonies for the Church 2:701.\n6The Signs of the Times, September 10, 1894.\n7Letter 9, 1904.\n8Testimonies for the Church 4:616.\n9Testimonies for the Church 1:547.\n10Manuscript 36, 1899.\n11Letter 272, 1903.\n12Letter 105, 1893.\n13Letter 18b, 1891.\nChapter 35\u2014Sharing the Burdens[216]\nFather\u2019s Duty Cannot Be Transferred\u2014The father\u2019s duty to\nhis children cannot be transferred to the mother. If she performs\nher own duty, she has burden enough to bear. Only by working in\nunison can the father and mother accomplish the work which God\nhas committed to their hands.1\nThe father should not excuse himself from his part in the work of\neducating his children for life and immortality. He must share in the\nresponsibility. There is obligation for both father and mother. There\nmust be love and respect manifested by the parents for one another,\nif they would see these qualities developed in their children.2\nThe father should encourage and sustain the mother in her work\nof care by his cheerful looks and kind words.3\nTry to help your wife in the conflict before her. Be careful of\nyour words, cultivate refinement of manners, courtesy, gentleness,\nand you will be rewarded for so doing.4\nTender Ministration Will Lighten the Mother\u2019s Load \u2014\nWhatever may be his calling and its perplexities, let the father take\ninto his home the same smiling countenance and pleasant tones with\nwhich he has all day greeted visitors and strangers. Let the wife feel\nthat she can lean upon the large affections of her husband\u2014that his\narms will strengthen and uphold her through all her toils and cares,\nthat his influence will sustain hers\u2014and her burden will lose half its\nweight. Are the children not his as well as hers?5\nThe wife may gather to herself burdens which she may suppose[217]\nto be of greater importance than to help her husband in bearing his\nportion of responsibility; and the same is true of the husband. Tender\nministrations are of value. There is a tendency for the husband to\nfeel free to go out and come into his home more as a boarder than a\nhusband of the family circle.6\nDomestic duties are sacred and important; yet they are often\nattended by a weary monotony. The countless cares and perplex-\nities become irritating without the variety of change and cheerful\n168\nSharing the Burdens 169\nrelaxation which the husband and father frequently has ... in his\npower to grant her if he chose\u2014or rather if he thought it necessary\nor desirable to do so. The life of a mother in the humbler walks of\nlife is one of unceasing self-sacrifice, made harder if the husband\nfails to appreciate the difficulties of her position and to give her his\nsupport.7\nShow Consideration for a Feeble Wife\u2014The husband should\nmanifest great interest in his family. Especially should he be very\ntender of the feelings of a feeble wife. He can shut the door against\nmuch disease. Kind, cheerful, and encouraging words will prove\nmore effective than the most healing medicines. These will bring\ncourage to the heart of the desponding and discouraged, and the\nhappiness and sunshine brought into the family by kind acts and\nencouraging words will repay the effort tenfold. The husband should\nremember that much of the burden of training his children rests upon\nthe mother, that she has much to do with molding their minds. This\nshould call into exercise his tenderest feelings, and with care should\nhe lighten her burdens. He should encourage her to lean upon\nhis large affections and direct her mind to heaven, where there is\nstrength and peace and a final rest for the weary. He should not come [218]\nto his home with a clouded brow, but should with his presence bring\nsunlight into the family and should encourage his wife to look up\nand believe in God. Unitedly they can claim the promises of God\nand bring His rich blessing into the family.8\n\u201cLead on Softly\u201d\u2014Many a husband and father might learn a\nhelpful lesson from the carefulness of the faithful shepherd. Jacob,\nwhen urged to undertake a rapid and difficult journey, made answer:\n\u201cThe children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young\nare with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock\nwill die.\u201d \u201cI will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth\nbefore me and the children be able to endure.\u201d\nIn life\u2019s toilsome way let the husband and father \u201clead on softly,\u201d\nas the companion of his journey is able to endure. Amidst the world\u2019s\neager rush for wealth and power, let him learn to stay his steps, to\ncomfort and support the one who is called to walk by his side....\nLet the husband aid his wife by his sympathy and unfailing af-\nfection. If he wishes to keep her fresh and gladsome, so that she will\nbe as sunshine in the home, let him help her bear her burdens. His\n170 The Adventist Home\nkindness and loving courtesy will be to her a precious encourage-\nment, and the happiness he imparts will bring joy and peace to his\nown heart....\nIf the mother is deprived of the care and comforts she should\nhave, if she is allowed to exhaust her strength through overwork\nor through anxiety and gloom, her children will be robbed of the\nvital-force and of the mental elasticity and cheerful buoyancy they\nshould inherit. Far better will it be to make the mother\u2019s life bright\nand cheerful, to shield her from want, wearing labor, and depressing[219]\ncare, and let the children inherit good constitutions, so that they may\nbattle their way through life with their own energetic strength.9\n1Fundamentals of Christian Education, 69.\n2The Signs of the Times, July 22, 1889.\n3The Signs of the Times, September 13, 1877.\n4Testimonies for the Church 2:84.\n5Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 70.\n6Manuscript 80, 1898.\n7The Signs of the Times, December 6, 1877.\n8Testimonies for the Church 1:306, 307.\n9The Ministry of Healing, 374.\nChapter 36\u2014A Companion With His Children [220]\nSpend Time With Children\u2014The average father wastes many\ngolden opportunities to attract and bind his children to him. Upon\nreturning home from his business, he should find it a pleasant change\nto spend some time with his children.1\nFathers should unbend from their false dignity, deny themselves\nsome slight self-gratification in time and leisure, in order to mingle\nwith the children, sympathizing with them in their little troubles,\nbinding them to their hearts by the strong bonds of love, and es-\ntablishing such an influence over their expanding minds that their\ncounsel will be regarded as sacred.2\nTake Special Interest in the Boys\u2014The father of boys should\ncome into close contact with his sons, giving them the benefit of\nhis larger experience and talking with them in such simplicity and\ntenderness that he binds them to his heart. He should let them see\nthat he has their best interest, their happiness, in view all the time.3\nHe who has a family of boys must understand that, whatever\nhis calling, he is never to neglect the souls placed in his care. He\nhas brought these children into the world and has made himself\nresponsible to God to do everything in his power to keep them from\nunsanctified associations, from evil companionship. He should not\nleave his restless boys wholly to the care of the mother. This is too\nheavy a burden for her. He must arrange matters for the best interests\nof the mother and the children. It may be very hard for the mother\nto exercise self-control and to manage wisely in the training of her [221]\nchildren. If this is the case, the father should take more of the burden\nupon his soul. He should be determined to make the most decided\nefforts to save his children.4\nTrain Children for Usefulness\u2014The father, as the head of his\nown household, should understand how to train his children for use-\nfulness and duty. This is his special work, above every other. During\nthe first few years of a child\u2019s life the molding of the disposition is\ncommitted principally to the mother; but she should ever feel that\n171\n172 The Adventist Home\nin her work she has the co-operation of the father. If he is engaged\nin business which almost wholly closes the door of usefulness to\nhis family, he should seek other employment which will not prevent\nhim from devoting some time to his children. If he neglects them,\nhe is unfaithful to the trust committed to him of God.\nThe father may exert an influence over his children which shall\nbe stronger than the allurements of the world. He should study the\ndisposition and character of the members of his little circle, that he\nmay understand their needs and their dangers and thus be prepared\nto repress the wrong and encourage the right.5\nWhatever may be the character of his business, it is not of so great\nimportance that he be excused in neglecting the work of educating\nand training his children to keep the way of the Lord.6\nBecome Acquainted With Varied Dispositions \u2014The father\nshould not become so absorbed in business life or in the study of\nbooks that he cannot take time to study the natures and necessities\nof his children. He should help in devising ways by which they may\nbe kept busy in useful labor agreeable to their varying dispositions.7\nFathers, spend as much time as possible with your children.[222]\nSeek to become acquainted with their various dispositions, that you\nmay know how to train them in harmony with the word of God.\nNever should a word of discouragement pass your lips. Do not bring\ndarkness into the home. Be pleasant, kind, and affectionate toward\nyour children, but not foolishly indulgent. Let them bear their little\ndisappointments, as every one must. Do not encourage them to come\nto you with their petty complaints of one another. Teach them to bear\nwith one another and to seek to maintain each other\u2019s confidence\nand respect.8\nAssociate With Them in Work and Sports\u2014Fathers, ... com-\nbine affection with authority, kindness and sympathy with firm re-\nstraint. Give some of your leisure hours to your children; become\nacquainted with them; associate with them in their work and in their\nsports, and win their confidence. Cultivate friendship with them,\nespecially with your sons. In this way you will be a strong influence\nfor good.9\nTeach Them Lessons From Nature \u2014Let the father seek to\nlighten the mother\u2019s task.... Let him point them to the beautiful\nflowers, the lofty trees, in whose very leaves they can trace the work\nCompanion With His Children 173\nand love of God. He should teach them that the God who made all\nthese things loves the beautiful and the good. Christ pointed His\ndisciples to the lilies of the field and the birds of the air, showing\nhow God cares for them and presenting this as evidence that He will\ncare for man, who is of higher consequence than birds or flowers.\nTell the children that however much time may be wasted in attempts\nat display, our appearance can never compare, for grace and beauty, [223]\nwith that of the simplest flowers of the field. Thus their minds may\nbe drawn from the artificial to the natural. They may learn that God\nhas given them all these beautiful things to enjoy, and that He wants\nthem to give Him the heart\u2019s best and holiest affections.10\nHe may take them into the garden and show them the opening\nbuds and the varied tints of the blooming flowers. Through such\nmediums he may give them the most important lessons concerning\nthe Creator, by opening before them the great book of nature, where\nthe love of God is expressed in every tree and flower and blade\nof grass. He may impress upon their minds the fact that if God\ncares so much for the trees and flowers, He will care much more\nfor the creatures formed in His image. He may lead them early to\nunderstand that God wants children to be lovely, not with artificial\nadornment, but with beauty of character, the charms of kindness\nand affection, which will make their hearts bound with joy and\nhappiness.11\n1The Signs of the Times, December 6, 1877.\n2Ibid..\n3Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 128.\n4Manuscript 79, 1901.\n5The Review and Herald, August 30, 1881.\n6The Signs of the Times, September 10, 1894.\n7Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 127, 128.\n8Manuscript 60, 1903.\n9The Ministry of Healing, 391, 392.\n10Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 70.\n11The Signs of the Times, December 6, 1877.\nChapter 37\u2014The Kind of Husband Not To Be[224]\nThe Husband Who Expects Wife to Carry Double Bur-\ndens\u2014In most families there are children of various ages, some\nof whom need not only the attention and wise discipline of the\nmother but also the sterner, yet affectionate, influence of the father.\nFew fathers consider this matter in its due importance. They fall into\nneglect of their own duty and thus heap grievous burdens upon the\nmother, at the same time feeling at liberty to criticize and condemn\nher actions according to their judgment. Under this heavy sense\nof responsibility and censure, the poor wife and mother often feels\nguilty and remorseful for that which she has done innocently or\nignorantly, and frequently when she has done the very best thing\npossible under the circumstances. Yet when her wearisome efforts\nshould be appreciated and approved and her heart made glad, she\nis obliged to walk under a cloud of sorrow and condemnation be-\ncause her husband, while ignoring his own duty, expects her to fulfill\nboth her own and his to his satisfaction, regardless of preventing\ncircumstances.1\nMany husbands do not sufficiently understand and appreciate the\ncares and perplexities which their wives endure, generally confined\nall day to an unceasing round of household duties. They frequently\ncome to their homes with clouded brows, bringing no sunshine to\nthe family circle. If the meals are not on time, the tired wife, who is\nfrequently housekeeper, nurse, cook, and housemaid, all in one, is\ngreeted with faultfinding. The exacting husband may condescend[225]\nto take the worrying child from the weary arms of its mother that\nher arrangements for the family meal may be hastened; but if the\nchild is restless and frets in the arms of its father, he will seldom\nfeel it his duty to act the nurse and seek to quiet and soothe it. He\ndoes not pause to consider how many hours the mother has endured\nthe little one\u2019s fretfulness, but calls out impatiently, \u201cHere, Mother,\ntake your child.\u201d Is it not his child as well as hers? Is he not under a\n174\nKind of Husband Not To Be 175\nnatural obligation to patiently bear his part of the burden of rearing\nhis children?2\nA Dictatorial and Dominating Husband; Words of Coun-\nsel\u2014Your life would be much happier if you did not feel that abso-\nlute authority is vested in you because you are a husband and father.\nYour practice shows that you misinterpret your position\u2014house-\nband. You are nervous and dictatorial and often manifest great lack\nof judgment, so that however you may regard your course at such\ntimes, it cannot be made to appear consistent to your wife and chil-\ndren. When once you have taken a position, you are seldom willing\nto withdraw from it. You are determined to carry out your plans,\nwhen many times you are not pursuing the right course and should\nsee it. What you need is more, far more, of love, of forbearance, and\nless of a determination to have your way both in word and in deed.\nIn the course you are now pursuing, instead of being a house-band,\nyou will be as a vise to compress and distress others....\nIn trying to force others to carry out your ideas in every particular,\nyou often do greater harm than if you were to yield these points.\nThis is true even when your ideas are right in themselves, but in\nmany things they are not correct; they are overstrained as the result\nof the peculiarities of your organization; therefore you drive the [226]\nwrong thing in a strong, unreasonable manner.3\nYou have peculiar views in regard to managing your family. You\nexercise an independent, arbitrary power which permits no liberty\nof will around you. You think yourself sufficient to be head in your\nfamily and feel that your head is sufficient to move every member,\nas a machine is moved in the hands of the workmen. You dictate and\nassume authority. This displeases Heaven and grieves the pitying\nangels. You have conducted yourself in your family as though you\nalone were capable of self-government. It has offended you that\nyour wife should venture to oppose your opinion or question your\ndecisions.4\nFretful and Querulous Husbands \u2014Husbands, give your\nwives a chance for their spiritual life.... By many the disposition to\nfret is encouraged until they become like grown-up children. They\ndo not leave this portion of their child life behind them. They cherish\nthese feelings until they cramp and dwarf the whole life by their\nquerulous complaints. And not only their own lives but the lives of\n176 The Adventist Home\nothers also. They carry with them the spirit of Ishmael, whose hand\nwas against everybody, and everybody\u2019s hand against him.5\nThe Selfish and Morose Husband\u2014Brother B is not of a tem-\nperament to bring sunshine into his family. Here is a good place\nfor him to begin to work. He is more like a cloud than a beam of\nlight. He is too selfish to speak words of approval to the members of\nhis family, especially to the one of all others who should have his\nlove and tender respect. He is morose, overbearing, dictatorial; his\nwords are frequently cutting, and leave a wound that he does not try[227]\nto heal by softening spirit, acknowledging his faults, and confessing\nhis wrongdoings....\nBrother B should soften; he should cultivate refinement and\ncourtesy. He should be very tender and gentle toward his wife,\nwho is his equal in every respect; he should not utter a word that\nwould cast a shadow upon her heart. He should begin the work of\nreformation at home; he should cultivate affection and overcome the\ncoarse, harsh, unfeeling, and ungenerous traits of his disposition.6\nThe husband and father who is morose, selfish, and overbearing\nis not only unhappy himself, but he casts gloom upon all the inmates\nof his home. He will reap the result in seeing his wife dispirited and\nsickly and his children marred with his own unlovely temper.7\nAn Egotistical and Intolerant Husband \u2014You expect too\nmuch of your wife and children. You censure too much. If you\nwould encourage a cheerful, happy temper yourself and speak kindly\nand tenderly to them, you would bring sunlight into your dwelling\ninstead of clouds, sorrow, and unhappiness. You think too much of\nyour opinion; you have taken extreme positions, and have not been\nwilling that your wife\u2019s judgment should have the weight it should in\nyour family. You have not encouraged respect for your wife yourself\nnor educated your children to respect her judgment. You have not\nmade her your equal, but have rather taken the reins of government\nand control into your own hands and held them with a firm grasp.\nYou have not an affectionate, sympathetic disposition. These traits\nof character you need to cultivate if you want to be an overcomer\nand if you want the blessing of God in your family.8\nTo One Who Disregards Christian Courtesy \u2014You have[228]\nlooked upon it as a weakness to be kind, tender, and sympathetic and\nhave thought it beneath your dignity to speak tenderly, gently, and\nKind of Husband Not To Be 177\nlovingly to your wife. Here you mistake in what true manliness and\ndignity consist. The disposition to leave deeds of kindness undone\nis a manifest weakness and defect in your character. That which you\nwould look upon as weakness God regards as true Christian courtesy\nthat should be exercised by every Christian; for this was the spirit\nwhich Christ manifested.9\nHusbands Should Merit Love and Affection\u2014If the husband\nis tyrannical, exacting, critical of the actions of his wife, he cannot\nhold her respect and affection, and the marriage relation will become\nodious to her. She will not love her husband, because he does not\ntry to make himself lovable. Husbands should be careful, attentive,\nconstant, faithful, and compassionate. They should manifest love\nand sympathy.... When the husband has the nobility of character,\npurity of heart, elevation of mind, that every true Christian must\npossess, it will be made manifest in the marriage relation.... He will\nseek to keep his wife in health and courage. He will strive to speak\nwords of comfort, to create an atmosphere of peace in the home\ncircle.10\n1The Signs of the Times, December 6, 1877.\n2Ibid..\n3Letter 19a, 1891.\n4Testimonies for the Church 2:253.\n5Letter 107, 1898.\n6Testimonies for the Church 4:36, 37.\n7The Ministry of Healing, 374, 375.\n8Testimonies for the Church 4:255.\n9Testimonies for the Church 4:256.\n10Manuscript 17, 1891.\n178 The Adventist Home\nSection 10\u2014Mother\u2014Queen of the [229]\nHousehold\nChapter 38\u2014Mother\u2019s Position and Responsibilities[230]\n[231]\nThe Husband\u2019s Equal\u2014Woman should fill the position which\nGod originally designed for her, as her husband\u2019s equal. The world\nneeds mothers who are mothers not merely in name but in every\nsense of the word. We may safely say that the distinctive duties of\nwoman are more sacred, more holy, than those of man. Let woman\nrealize the sacredness of her work and in the strength and fear of God\ntake up her life mission. Let her educate her children for usefulness\nin this world and for a home in the better world.1\nThe wife and mother should not sacrifice her strength and allow\nher powers to lie dormant, leaning wholly upon her husband. Her\nindividuality cannot be merged in his. She should feel that she is\nher husband\u2019s equal\u2014to stand by his side, she faithful at her post of\nduty and he at his. Her work in the education of her children is in\nevery respect as elevating and ennobling as any post of duty he may\nbe called to fill, even if it is to be the chief magistrate of the nation.2\nThe Queen of the Home \u2014The king upon his throne has no\nhigher work than has the mother. The mother is queen of her house-\nhold. She has in her power the molding of her children\u2019s characters,\nthat they may be fitted for the higher, immortal life. An angel could\nnot ask for a higher mission; for in doing this work she is doing\nservice for God. Let her only realize the high character of her task,\nand it will inspire her with courage. Let her realize the worth of her[232]\nwork and put on the whole armor of God, that she may resist the\ntemptation to conform to the world\u2019s standard. Her work is for time\nand for eternity.3\nThe mother is the queen of the home, and the children are her\nsubjects. She is to rule her household wisely, in the dignity of her\nmotherhood. Her influence in the home is to be paramount; her word,\nlaw. If she is a Christian, under God\u2019s control, she will command\nthe respect of her children.4\nThe children are to be taught to regard their mother, not as a\nslave whose work it is to wait on them, but as a queen who is to\n180\nMother\u2019s Position and Responsibilities 181\nguide and direct them, teaching them line upon line, precept upon\nprecept.5\nA Graphic Comparison of Values\u2014The mother seldom appre-\nciates her own work and frequently sets so low an estimate upon her\nlabor that she regards it as domestic drudgery. She goes through the\nsame round day after day, week after week, with no special marked\nresults. She cannot tell at the close of the day the many little things\nshe has accomplished. Placed beside her husband\u2019s achievement,\nshe feels that she has done nothing worth mentioning.\nThe father frequently comes in with a self-satisfied air and\nproudly recounts what he has accomplished through the day. His\nremarks show that now he must be waited upon by the mother, for\nshe has not done much except take care of the children, cook the\nmeals, and keep the house in order. She has not acted the merchant,\nbought nor sold; she has not acted the farmer, in tilling the soil;\nshe has not acted the mechanic\u2014therefore she has done nothing to\nmake her weary. He criticizes and censures and dictates as though\nhe was the lord of creation. And this is all the more trying to the [233]\nwife and mother, because she has become very weary at her post of\nduty during the day, and yet she cannot see what she has done and is\nreally disheartened.\nCould the veil be withdrawn and father and mother see as God\nsees the work of the day, and see how His infinite eye compares the\nwork of the one with that of the other, they would be astonished\nat the heavenly revelation. The father would view his labors in a\nmore modest light, while the mother would have new courage and\nenergy to pursue her labor with wisdom, perseverance, and patience.\nNow she knows its value. While the father has been dealing with\nthe things which must perish and pass away, the mother has been\ndealing with developing minds and character, working not only for\ntime but for eternity.6\nGod Has Appointed Her Work \u2014Would that every mother\ncould realize how great are her duties and her responsibilities and\nhow great will be the reward of faithfulness.7\nThe mother who cheerfully takes up the duties lying directly in\nher path will feel that life is to her precious, because God has given\nher a work to perform. In this work she need not necessarily dwarf\nher mind nor allow her intellect to become enfeebled.8\n182 The Adventist Home\nThe mother\u2019s work is given her of God, to bring up her children\nin the nurture and admonition of the Lord. The love and fear of God\nshould ever be kept before their tender minds. When corrected, they\nshould be taught to feel that they are admonished of God, that He is\ndispleased with deception, untruthfulness, and wrongdoing. Thus\nthe minds of little ones may be so connected with God that all they\ndo and say will be in reference to His glory; and in after years they[234]\nwill not be like the reed in the wind, continually wavering between\ninclination and duty.9\nTo lead them to Jesus is not all that is required.... These children\nare to be educated and trained to become disciples of Christ, \u201cthat\nour sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters\nmay be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace.\u201d\nThis work of molding, refining, and polishing is the mother\u2019s. The\ncharacter of the child is to be developed. The mother must engrave\nupon the tablet of the heart lessons as enduring as eternity; and\nshe will surely meet the displeasure of the Lord if she neglects this\nsacred work or allows anything to interfere with it.... The Christian\nmother has her God-appointed work, which she will not neglect if\nshe is closely connected with God and imbued with His Spirit.10\nHer Grand and Noble Commission\u2014There are opportunities\nof inestimable worth, interests infinitely precious, committed to\nevery mother. The humble round of duties which women have come\nto regard as a wearisome task should be looked upon as a grand\nand noble work. It is the mother\u2019s privilege to bless the world by\nher influence, and in doing this she will bring joy to her own heart.\nShe may make straight paths for the feet of her children through\nsunshine and shadow to the glorious heights above. But it is only\nwhen she seeks, in her own life, to follow the teachings of Christ\nthat the mother can hope to form the character of her children after\nthe divine pattern.11\nAmid all the activities of life the mother\u2019s most sacred duty is to\nher children. But how often is this duty put aside that some selfish\ngratification may be followed! Parents are entrusted with the present[235]\nand eternal interests of their children. They are to hold the reins of\ngovernment and guide their households to the honor of God. God\u2019s\nlaw should be their standard, and love should rule in all things.12\nMother\u2019s Position and Responsibilities 183\nNo Work Is Greater or Holier \u2014If married men go into the\nwork, leaving their wives to care for the children at home, the wife\nand mother is doing fully as great and important a work as the\nhusband and father. Although one is in the missionary field, the\nother is a home missionary, whose cares and anxieties and burdens\nfrequently far exceed those of the husband and father. Her work is a\nsolemn and important one.... The husband in the open missionary\nfield may receive the honors of men, while the home toiler may\nreceive no earthly credit for her labor. But if she works for the best\ninterest of her family, seeking to fashion their characters after the\ndivine Model, the recording angel writes her name as one of the\ngreatest missionaries in the world. God does not see things as man\u2019s\nfinite vision views them.13\nThe mother is God\u2019s agent to Christianize her family. She is to\nexemplify Biblical religion, showing how its influence is to control\nus in its everyday duties and pleasures, teaching her children that\nby grace alone can they be saved, through faith, which is the gift of\nGod. This constant teaching as to what Christ is to us and to them,\nHis love, His goodness, His mercy, revealed in the great plan of\nredemption, will make a hallowed, sacred impress on the heart.14\nThe training of children constitutes an important part of God\u2019s\nplan for demonstrating the power of Christianity. A solemn respon-\nsibility rests upon parents to so train their children that when they\ngo forth into the world, they will do good and not evil to those with [236]\nwhom they associate.15\nA Co-worker With the Minister\u2014The minister has his line of\nwork, and the mother has hers. She is to bring her children to Jesus\nfor His blessing. She is to cherish the words of Christ and teach\nthem to her children. From their babyhood she is to discipline them\nto self-restraint and self-denial, to habits of neatness and order. The\nmother can bring up her children so that they will come with open,\ntender hearts to hear the words of God\u2019s servants. The Lord has need\nof mothers who in every line of the home life will improve their\nGod-given talents and fit their children for the family of heaven.\nThe Lord is served as much, yea, more, by faithful home work\nthan by the one who teaches the word. As verily as do the teachers in\nthe school, fathers and mothers are to feel that they are the educators\nof their children.16\n184 The Adventist Home\nThe Christian mother\u2019s sphere of usefulness should not be nar-\nrowed by her domestic life. The salutary influence which she exerts\nin the home circle she may and will make felt in more widespread\nusefulness in her neighborhood and in the church of God. Home is\nnot a prison to the devoted wife and mother.17\nShe Has a Life Mission \u2014Let woman realize the sacredness\nof her work and, in the strength and fear of God, take up her life\nmission. Let her educate her children for usefulness in this world\nand for a fitness for the better world. We address Christian mothers.\nWe entreat that you feel your responsibility as mothers and that you\nlive not to please yourselves, but to glorify God. Christ pleased not\nHimself, but took upon Him the form of a servant.18\nThe world teems with corrupting influences. Fashion and custom[237]\nexert a strong power over the young. If the mother fails in her duty\nto instruct, guide, and restrain, her children will naturally accept\nthe evil and turn from the good. Let every mother go often to her\nSaviour with the prayer, \u201cTeach us, how shall we order the child,\nand what shall we do unto him?\u201d Let her heed the instruction which\nGod has given in His word, and wisdom will be given her as she\nshall have need.19\nSculpturing a Likeness of the Divine\u2014There is a God above,\nand the light and glory from His throne rests upon the faithful mother\nas she tries to educate her children to resist the influence of evil.\nNo other work can equal hers in importance. She has not, like the\nartist, to paint a form of beauty upon canvas; nor, like the sculptor,\nto chisel it from marble. She has not, like the author, to embody a\nnoble thought in words of power; nor, like the musician, to express\na beautiful sentiment in melody. It is hers, with the help of God, to\ndevelop in a human soul the likeness of the divine.\nThe mother who appreciates this will regard her opportunities as\npriceless. Earnestly will she seek, in her own character and by her\nmethods of training, to present before her children the highest ideal.\nEarnestly, patiently, courageously, she will endeavor to improve\nher own abilities, that she may use aright the highest powers of\nthe mind in the training of her children. Earnestly will she inquire\nat every step, \u201cWhat hath God spoken?\u201d Diligently she will study\nHis word. She will keep her eyes fixed upon Christ, that her own\nMother\u2019s Position and Responsibilities 185\ndaily experience, in the lowly round of care and duty, may be a true\nreflection of the one true Life.20\nThe Faithful Mother Enrolled in Book of Immortal Fame\u2014 [238]\nSelf-denial and the cross are our portion. Will we accept it? None of\nus need expect that when the last great trials come upon us, a self-\nsacrificing, patriotic spirit will be developed in a moment because\nneeded. No, indeed, this spirit must be blended with our daily\nexperience and infused into the minds and hearts of our children,\nboth by precept and example. Mothers in Israel may not be warriors\nthemselves, but they may raise up warriors who shall gird on the\nwhole armor and fight manfully the battles of the Lord.21\nMothers, to a great degree the destiny of your children rests in\nyour hands. If you fail in duty, you may place them in the ranks of\nthe enemy and make them his agents to ruin souls; but by a godly\nexample and faithful discipline you may lead them to Christ and\nmake them the instruments in His hands of saving many souls.22\nHer work [the Christian mother\u2019s], if done faithfully in God, will\nbe immortalized. The votaries of fashion will never see or understand\nthe immortal beauty of that Christian mother\u2019s work, and will sneer\nat her old-fashioned notions and her plain, unadorned dress; while\nthe Majesty of heaven will write the name of that faithful mother in\nthe book of immortal fame.23\nThe Moments Are Priceless\u2014The whole future life of Moses,\nthe great mission which he fulfilled as the leader of Israel, testifies\nto the importance of the work of the Christian mother. There is no\nother work that can equal this... Parents should direct the instruction\nand training of their children while very young, to the end that they\nmay be Christians. They are placed in our care to be trained, not as\nheirs to the throne of an earthly empire, but as kings unto God, to\nreign through unending ages.\nLet every mother feel that her moments are priceless; her work [239]\nwill be tested in the solemn day of accounts. Then it will be found\nthat many of the failures and crimes of men and women have re-\nsulted from the ignorance and neglect of those whose duty it was\nto guide their childish feet in the right way. Then it will be found\nthat many who have blessed the world with the light of genius and\ntruth and holiness owe the principles that were the mainspring of\ntheir influence and success to a praying, Christian mother.24\n186 The Adventist Home\n1Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 77.\n2Pacific Health Journal, June, 1890.\n3The Signs of the Times, March 16, 1891.\n4Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 111.\n5Letter 272, 1903.\n6The Signs of the Times, September 13, 1877.\n7The Signs of the Times, October 11, 1910.\n8Pacific Health Journal, June, 1890.\n9Good Health, January, 1880.\n10Ibid.\n11Patriarchs and Prophets, 572.\n12The Signs of the Times, March 16, 1891.\n13Testimonies for the Church 5:594.\n14The Review and Herald, September 15, 1891.\n15Manuscript 49, 1901.\n16Manuscript 32, 1899.\n17Pacific Health Journal, June, 1890.\n18Testimonies for the Church 3:565.\n19Patriarchs and Prophets, 572, 573.\n20The Ministry of Healing, 377, 378.\n21Testimonies for the Church 5:135.\n22The Signs of the Times, March 11, 1886.\n23The Signs of the Times, September 13, 1877.\n24Patriarchs and Prophets, 244.\nChapter 39\u2014Influence of the Mother [240]\nMother\u2019s Influence Reaches Into Eternity\u2014The sphere of the\nmother may be humble; but her influence, united with the father\u2019s,\nis as abiding as eternity. Next to God, the mother\u2019s power for good\nis the strongest known on earth.1\nThe mother\u2019s influence is an unceasing influence; and if it is\nalways on the side of right, her children\u2019s characters will testify to\nher moral earnestness and worth. Her smile, her encouragement,\nmay be an inspiring force. She may bring sunshine to the heart of\nher child by a word of love, a smile of approval....\nWhen her influence is for truth, for virtue, when she is guided\nby divine wisdom, what a power for Christ will be her life! Her\ninfluence will reach on through time into eternity. What a thought\nis this\u2014that the mother\u2019s looks and words and actions bear fruit in\neternity, and the salvation or ruin of many will be the result of her\ninfluence!2\nLittle does the mother realize that her influence in the judicious\ntraining of her children reaches with such power through the vicissi-\ntudes of this life, stretching forward into the future, immortal life. To\nfashion a character after the heavenly Model requires much faithful,\nearnest, persevering labor; but it will pay, for God is a rewarder of\nall well-directed labor in securing the salvation of souls.3\nLike Mother\u2014Like Children\u2014The tenderest earthly tie is that\nbetween the mother and her child. The child is more readily im-\npressed by the life and example of the mother than by that of the\nfather, for a stronger and more tender bond of union unites them.4\nThe thoughts and feelings of the mother will have a powerful [241]\ninfluence upon the legacy she gives her child. If she allows her mind\nto dwell upon her own feelings, if she indulges in selfishness, if she\nis peevish and exacting, the disposition of her child will testify to the\nfact. Thus many have received as a birthright almost unconquerable\ntendencies to evil. The enemy of souls understands this matter much\nbetter than do many parents. He will bring his temptations to bear\n187\n188 The Adventist Home\nupon the mother, knowing that if she does not resist him, he can\nthrough her affect her child. The mother\u2019s only hope is in God. She\nmay flee to Him for strength and grace; and she will not seek in\nvain.5\nA Christian mother will ever be wide awake to discern the dan-\ngers that surround her children. She will keep her own soul in a pure,\nholy atmosphere; she will regulate her temper and principles by the\nword of God and will faithfully do her duty, living above the petty\ntemptations which will always assail her.6\nThe Wholesome Influence of a Patient Mother\u2014Many times\nin the day is the cry of, Mother, mother, heard, first from one little\ntroubled voice and then another. In answer to the cry, mother must\nturn here and there to attend to their demands. One is in trouble and\nneeds the wise head of the mother to free him from his perplexity.\nAnother is so pleased with some of his devices he must have his\nmother see them, thinking she will be as pleased as he is. A word of\napproval will bring sunshine to the heart for hours. Many precious\nbeams of light and gladness can the mother shed here and there\namong her precious little ones. How closely can she bind these dear\nones to her heart, that her presence will be to them the sunniest place\nin the world.\nBut frequently the patience of the mother is taxed with these nu-[242]\nmerous little trials that seem scarcely worth attention. Mischievous\nhands and restless feet create a great amount of labor and perplexity\nfor the mother. She has to hold fast the reins of self-control, or im-\npatient words will slip from her tongue. She almost forgets herself\ntime and again, but a silent prayer to her pitying Redeemer calms her\nnerves, and she is enabled to hold the reins of self-control with quiet\ndignity. She speaks with calm voice, but it has cost her an effort to\nrestrain harsh words and subdue angry feelings which, if expressed,\nwould have destroyed her influence, which it would have taken time\nto regain.\nThe perception of children is quick, and they discern patient,\nloving tones from the impatient, passionate command, which dries\nup the moisture of love and affection in the hearts of children. The\ntrue Christian mother will not drive her children from her presence\nby her fretfulness and lack of sympathizing love.7\nInfluence of the Mother 189\nTo Shape Minds and Mold Characters\u2014Especially does re-\nsponsibility rest upon the mother. She, by whose lifeblood the child\nis nourished and its physical frame built up, imparts to it also mental\nand spiritual influences that tend to the shaping of mind and charac-\nter. It was Jochebed, the Hebrew mother, who, strong in faith, was\n\u201cnot afraid of the king\u2019s commandment,\u201d of whom was born Moses,\nthe deliverer of Israel. It was Hannah, the woman of prayer and\nself-sacrifice and heavenly inspiration, who gave birth to Samuel,\nthe heaven-instructed child, the incorruptible judge, the founder of\nIsrael\u2019s sacred schools. It was Elizabeth, the kinswoman and kindred\nspirit of Mary of Nazareth, who was the mother of the Saviour\u2019s\nherald.8\nThe World\u2019s Debt to Mothers \u2014The day of God will reveal [243]\nhow much the world owes to godly mothers for men who have been\nunflinching advocates of truth and reform\u2014men who have been bold\nto do and dare, who have stood unshaken amid trials and temptations;\nmen who chose the high and holy interests of truth and the glory of\nGod before worldly honor or life itself.9\nMothers, awake to the fact that your influence and example are\naffecting the character and destiny of your children; and in view\nof your responsibility, develop a well-balanced mind and a pure\ncharacter, reflecting only the true, the good, and the beautiful.10\n1Good Health, March 1, 1880, par. 12.\n2The Signs of the Times, March 16, 1891.\n3Good Health, July, 1880.\n4Testimonies for the Church 2:536.\n5The Signs of the Times, September 13, 1910.\n6Letter 69, 1896.\n7The Signs of the Times, September 13, 1877.\n8The Ministry of Healing, 372.\n9The Signs of the Times, October 11, 1910.\n10The Signs of the Times, September 9, 1886.\nChapter 40\u2014Misconception of the Mother\u2019s Work[244]\nMother Tempted to Feel That Her Work Is Unimportant\u2014\nThe mother\u2019s work often seems to her an unimportant service. It is a\nwork that is rarely appreciated. Others know little of her many cares\nand burdens. Her days are occupied with a round of little duties,\nall calling for patient effort, for self-control, for tact, wisdom, and\nself-sacrificing love; yet she cannot boast of what she has done as\nany great achievement. She has only kept things in the home running\nsmoothly. Often weary and perplexed, she has tried to speak kindly\nto the children, to keep them busy and happy, and to guide their little\nfeet in the right path. She feels that she has accomplished nothing.\nBut it is not so. Heavenly angels watch the careworn mother, noting\nthe burdens she carries day by day. Her name may not have been\nheard in the world, but it is written in the Lamb\u2019s book of life.1\nThe true wife and mother ... will perform her duties with dignity\nand cheerfulness, not considering it degrading to do with her own\nhands whatever it is necessary to do in a well-ordered household.2\nRegarded as Inferior to Mission Service\u2014What an important\nwork! And yet we hear mothers sighing for missionary work! If\nthey could only go to some foreign country, they would feel that\nthey were doing something worth while. But to take up the daily\nduties of the home life and carry them forward seems to them like\nan exhausting and thankless task.3\nMothers who sigh for a missionary field have one at hand in their[245]\nown home circle.... Are not the souls of her own children of as much\nvalue as the souls of the heathen? With what care and tenderness\nshould she watch their growing minds and connect God with all their\nthoughts! Who can do this as well as a loving, God-fearing mother?4\nThere are some who think that unless they are directly connected\nwith active religious work, they are not doing the will of God; but\nthis is a mistake. Everyone has a work to do for the Master; it is a\nwonderful work to make home pleasant and all that it ought to be.\nThe humblest talents, if the heart of the recipient is given to God,\n190\nMisconception of the Mother\u2019s Work 191\nwill make the home life all that God would have it. A bright light\nwill shine forth as the result of wholehearted service to God. Men\nand women can just as surely serve God by giving earnest heed to\nthe things which they have heard, by educating their children to live\nand fear to offend God, as can the minister in the pulpit.5\nThese women who are doing with ready willingness what their\nhands find to do, with cheerfulness of spirit aiding their husbands to\nbear their burdens and training their children for God, are missionar-\nies in the highest sense.6\nReligious Activities Should Not Supersede Care of Family\u2014\nIf you ignore your duty as a wife and mother and hold out your hands\nfor the Lord to put another class of work in them, be sure that He\nwill not contradict Himself; He points you to the duty you have to\ndo at home. If you have the idea that some work greater and holier\nthan this has been entrusted to you, you are under a deception. By\nfaithfulness in your own home, working for the souls of those who\nare nearest to you, you may be gaining a fitness to work for Christ [246]\nin a wider field. But be sure that those who are neglectful of their\nduty in the home circle are not prepared to work for other souls.7\nThe Lord has not called you to neglect your home and your\nhusband and children. He never works in this way; and He never\nwill.... Never for a moment suppose that God has given you a work\nthat will necessitate a separation from your precious little flock. Do\nnot leave them to become demoralized by improper associations and\nto harden their hearts against their mother. This is letting your light\nshine in a wrong way, altogether; you are making it more difficult\nfor your children to become what God would have them and win\nheaven at last. God cares for them, and so must you if you claim to\nbe His child.8\nDuring the first years of their lives is the time in which to work\nand watch and pray and encourage every good inclination. This\nwork must go on without interruption. You may be urged to attend\nmothers\u2019 meetings and sewing circles, that you may do missionary\nwork; but unless there is a faithful, understanding instructor to be\nleft with your children, it is your duty to answer that the Lord has\ncommitted to you another work which you can in no wise neglect.\nYou cannot overwork in any line without becoming disqualified for\nthe work of training your little ones and making them what God\n192 The Adventist Home\nwould have them be. As Christ\u2019s co-worker you must bring them to\nHim disciplined and trained.9\nMuch of the malformation of an ill-trained child\u2019s character lies\nat the mother\u2019s door. The mother should not accept burdens in the\nchurch work which compel her to neglect her children. The best\nwork in which a mother can engage is to see that no stitches are\ndropped in the training of her children....\nIn no other way can a mother help the church more than by[247]\ndevoting her time to those who are dependent upon her for instruction\nand training.10\nAspirations for a Broader Mission Field Are Vain \u2014Some\nmothers long to engage in missionary labor, while they neglect\nthe simplest duties lying directly in their path. The children are\nneglected, the home is not made cheerful and happy for the family,\nscolding and complaining are of frequent occurrence, and the young\npeople grow up feeling that home is the most uninviting of all places.\nAs a consequence, they impatiently look forward to the time when\nthey shall leave it, and it is with little reluctance that they launch out\ninto the great world, unrestrained by home influence and the tender\ncounsel of the hearthstone.\nThe parents, whose aim should have been to bind these young\nhearts to themselves and guide them aright, squander their God-\ngiven opportunities, are blind to the most important duties of their\nlives, and vainly aspire to work in the broad missionary field.11\n1Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 144.\n2The Signs of the Times, September 9, 1886.\n3The Review and Herald, July 9, 1901.\n4Manuscript 43, 1900.\n5Manuscript 32, 1899.\n6Testimonies for the Church 2:466.\n7The Review and Herald, September 15, 1891, par. 2.\n8Letter 28, 1890.\n9Manuscript 32, 1899.\n10Manuscript 75, 1901.\n11The Health Reformer, October, 1876.\nChapter 41\u2014Imperfect Patterns of Motherhood [248]\nA Fancied Martyr\u2014Many a home is made very unhappy by\nthe useless repining of its mistress, who turns with distaste from\nthe simple, homely tasks of her unpretending domestic life. She\nlooks upon the cares and duties of her lot as hardships; and that\nwhich, through cheerfulness, might be made not only pleasant and\ninteresting, but profitable, becomes the merest drudgery. She looks\nupon the slavery of her life with repugnance and imagines herself a\nmartyr.\nIt is true that the wheels of domestic machinery will not always\nrun smoothly; there is much to try the patience and tax the strength.\nBut while mothers are not responsible for circumstances over which\nthey have no control, it is useless to deny that circumstances make a\ngreat difference with mothers in their lifework. But their condemna-\ntion is when circumstances are allowed to rule and to subvert their\nprinciple, when they grow tired and unfaithful to their high trust and\nneglect their known duty.\nThe wife and mother who nobly overcomes difficulties under\nwhich others sink for want of patience and fortitude to persevere not\nonly becomes strong herself in doing her duty, but her experience in\novercoming temptations and obstacles qualifies her to be an efficient\nhelp to others, both by words and example. Many who do well\nunder favorable circumstances seem to undergo a transformation of\ncharacter under adversity and trial; they deteriorate in proportion to\ntheir troubles. God never designed that we should be the sport of\ncircumstances.1\nNourishing a Sinful Discontent \u2014Very many husbands and [249]\nchildren who find nothing attractive at home, who are continually\ngreeted by scolding and murmuring, seek comfort and amusement\naway from home, in the dramshop or in other forbidden scenes\nof pleasure. The wife and mother, occupied with her household\ncares, frequently becomes thoughtless of the little courtesies that\nmake home pleasant to the husband and children, even if she avoids\n193\n194 The Adventist Home\ndwelling upon her peculiar vexations and difficulties in their pres-\nence. While she is absorbed in preparing something to eat or to wear,\nthe husband and sons go in and come out as strangers.\nWhile the mistress of the household may perform her outward\nduties with exactitude, she may be continually crying out against the\nslavery to which she is doomed, and exaggerate her responsibilities\nand restrictions by comparing her lot with what she styles the higher\nlife of woman.... While she is fruitlessly yearning for a different\nlife, she is nourishing a sinful discontent and making her home very\nunpleasant for her husband and children.2\nOccupied With the World\u2019s Follies\u2014Satan has prepared pleas-\ning attractions for parents as well as for children. He knows that\nif he can exert his deceptive power upon mothers, he has gained\nmuch. The ways of the world are full of deceitfulness and fraud and\nmisery, but they are made to appear inviting; and if the children and\nyouth are not carefully trained and disciplined, they will surely go\nastray. Having no fixed principles, it will be hard for them to resist\ntemptation.3\nAssuming Unnecessary Burdens\u2014Many mothers spend their\ntime in doing needless nothings. They give their whole attention to[250]\nthe things of time and sense\u2019 and do not pause to think of the things\nof eternal interest. How many neglect their children, and the little\nones grow up coarse, rough, and uncultivated!4\nWhen parents, especially mothers, have a true sense of the im-\nportant, responsible work which God has left for them to do, they\nwill not be so much engaged in the business which concerns their\nneighbors, with which they have nothing to do. They will not go\nfrom house to house to engage in fashionable gossip, dwelling upon\nthe faults, wrongs, and inconsistencies of their neighbors. They will\nfeel so great a burden of care for their own children that they can\nfind no time to take up a reproach against their neighbor.5\nIf woman looks to God for strength and comfort and in His\nfear seeks to perform her daily duties, she will win the respect and\nconfidence of her husband and see her children coming to maturity\nhonorable men and women, having moral stamina to do right. But\nmothers who neglect present opportunities, and let their duties and\nburdens fall upon others, will find that their responsibility remains\nthe same, and they will reap in bitterness what they have sown in\nImperfect Patterns of Motherhood 195\ncarelessness and neglect. There is no chance work in this life; the\nharvest will be determined by the character of the seed sown.6\n1The Signs of the Times, November 29, 1877.\n2Ibid.\n3The Review and Herald, June 27, 1899.\n4The Signs of the Times, July 22, 1889.\n5Testimonies for the Church 2:466.\n6The Signs of the Times, April 4, 1911.\nChapter 42\u2014Mother\u2019s Health and Personal[251]\nAppearance\nMother\u2019s Health to Be Cherished\u2014The strength of the mother\nshould be tenderly cherished. Instead of spending her precious\nstrength in exhausting labor, her care and burdens should be lessened.\nOften the husband and father is unacquainted with the physical\nlaws which the well-being of his family requires him to understand.\nAbsorbed in the struggle for a livelihood, or bent on acquiring wealth,\nand pressed with cares and perplexities, he allows to rest upon the\nwife and mother burdens that overtax her strength at the most critical\nperiod and cause feebleness and disease.1\nIt is for her own interest, and that of her family, to save herself\nall unnecessary taxation and to use every means at her command\nto preserve life, health, and the energies which God has given her;\nfor she will need the vigor of all her faculties for her great work. A\nportion of her time should be spent out-of-doors, in physical exercise,\nthat she may be invigorated to do her work indoors with cheerfulness\nand thoroughness, being the light and blessing of the home.2\nMothers to Be Advocates of Health Reform\u2014The will of God\nhas been plainly expressed to all mothers; He would have them, by\nprecept and example, advocates of health reform. They should plant\ntheir feet firmly upon principle, in no case to violate the physical\nlaws which God has implanted in their beings. \u201cStanding by a\npurpose true,\u201d with firm integrity, mothers will have moral power[252]\nand grace from Heaven to let their light shine forth to the world,\nboth in their own upright course and in the noble character of their\nchildren.3\nTo Exercise Self-control in Diet\u2014The mother needs the most\nperfect self-control; and in order to secure this, she should take\nall precautions against any physical or mental disorder. Her life\nshould be ordered according to the laws of God and of health. As\nthe diet materially affects the mind and disposition, she should\nbe very careful in that particular, eating that which is nourishing\n196\nMother\u2019s Health and Personal Appearance 197\nbut not stimulating, that her nerves may be calm and her temper\nequable. She will then find it easier to exercise patience in dealing\nwith the varying tendencies of her children and to hold the reins of\ngovernment firmly yet affectionately.4\nTo Radiate Sunshine Under All Circumstances\u2014The mother\ncan and should do much toward controlling her nerves and mind\nwhen depressed; even when she is sick, she can, if she only schools\nherself, be pleasant and cheerful and can bear more noise than she\nwould once have thought possible. She should not make the children\nfeel her infirmities and cloud their young, sensitive minds by her\ndepression of spirits, causing them to feel that the house is a tomb\nand the mother\u2019s room the most dismal place in the world. The mind\nand nerves gain tone and strength by the exercise of the will. The\npower of the will in many cases will prove a potent soother of the\nnerves. Do not let your children see you with a clouded brow.5\nTo Regard the Esteem of Husband and Children \u2014Sisters,\nwhen about their work, should not put on clothing which would\nmake them look like images to frighten the crows from the corn. [253]\nIt is more gratifying to their husbands and children to see them\nin a becoming, well-fitting attire than it can be to mere visitors or\nstrangers. Some wives and mothers seem to think it is no matter how\nthey look when about their work and when they are seen only by\ntheir husbands and children, but they are very particular to dress in\ntaste for the eyes of those who have no special claims upon them. Is\nnot the esteem and love of husband and children more to be prized\nthan that of strangers or common friends? The happiness of husband\nand children should be more sacred to every wife and mother than\nthat of all others.6\nWear clothing that is becoming to you. This will increase the\nrespect of your children for you. See to it that they, too, are dressed\nin a becoming manner. Do not allow them to fall into habits of\nuntidiness.7\nNot to Be in Bondage to Public Opinion\u2014Too often mothers\nshow a morbid sensitiveness as to what others may think of their\nhabits, dress, and opinions; and, to a great extent, they are slaves to\nthe thought of how others may regard them. Is it not a sad thing that\njudgment-bound creatures should be controlled more by the thought\nof what their neighbors will think of them than by the thought of\n198 The Adventist Home\ntheir obligation to God? We too often sacrifice the truth in order to\nbe in harmony with custom, that we may avoid ridicule....\nA mother cannot afford to be in bondage to opinion; for she is\nto train her children for this life and for the life to come. In dress,\nmothers should not seek to make a display by needless ornamenta-\ntion.8\nTo Give Lessons in Neatness and Purity \u2014If mothers allow\nthemselves to wear untidy garments at home, they are teaching their[254]\nchildren to follow in the same slovenly way. Many mothers think\nthat anything is good enough for home wear, be it ever so soiled\nand shabby. But they soon lose their influence in the family. The\nchildren draw comparisons between their mother\u2019s dress and that of\nothers who dress neatly, and their respect for her is weakened.\nMothers, make yourselves as attractive as possible; not by elabo-\nrate trimming, but by wearing clean, well-fitting garments. Thus you\nwill give to your children constant lessons in neatness and purity.\nThe love and respect of her children should be of the highest value to\nevery mother. Everything upon her person should teach cleanliness\nand order and should be associated in their minds with purity. There\nis a sense of fitness, an idea of the appropriateness of things, in the\nminds of even very young children; and how can they be impressed\nwith the desirability of purity and holiness when their eyes daily\nrest on untidy dresses and disorderly rooms? How can the heavenly\nguests, whose home is where all is pure and holy, be invited into\nsuch a dwelling?9\nOrder and cleanliness is the law of heaven; and in order to come\ninto harmony with the divine arrangement, it is our duty to be neat\nand tasty.10\n1The Ministry of Healing, 373.\n2Pacific Health Journal, June, 1890.\n3Good Health, February, 1880.\n4Pacific Health Journal, May, 1890.\n5Testimonies for the Church 1:387.\n6Ibid., 1:464, 465.\n7Letter 47a, 1902.\n8The Review and Herald, March 31, 1891.\n9Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 143, 144.\n10Testimonies for the Church 4:142, 143.\nChapter 43\u2014Prenatal Influences [255]\nWomen Should Be Qualified to Become Mothers \u2014Women\nhave need of great patience before they are qualified to become\nmothers. God has ordained that they shall be fitted for this work.\nThe work of the mother becomes infinite through her connection with\nChrist. It is beyond understanding. Woman\u2019s office is sacred. The\npresence of Jesus is needed in the home; for the mother\u2019s ministries\nof love may shape the home into a Bethel. The husband and the wife\nare to co-operate. What a world we would have if all mothers would\nconsecrate themselves on the altar of God, and would consecrate\ntheir offspring to God, both before and after its birth!1\nImportance of Prenatal Influences\u2014The effect of prenatal in-\nfluences is by many parents looked upon as a matter of little moment;\nbut heaven does not so regard it. The message sent by an angel of\nGod, and twice given in the most solemn manner, shows it to be\ndeserving of our most careful thought.\nIn the words spoken to the Hebrew mother [the wife of Manoah],\nGod speaks to all mothers in every age. \u201cLet her beware,\u201d the angel\nsaid; \u201call that I commanded her let her observe.\u201d The well-being of\nthe child will be affected by the habits of the mother. Her appetites\nand passions are to be controlled by principle. There is something\nfor her to shun, something for her to work against, if she fulfills\nGod\u2019s purpose for her in giving her a child.2\nThe world is full of snares for the feet of the young. Multitudes\nare attracted by a life of selfish and sensual pleasure. They cannot\ndiscern the hidden dangers or the fearful ending of the path that [256]\nseems to them the way of happiness. Through the indulgence of\nappetite and passion, their energies are wasted, and millions are\nruined for this world and for the world to come. Parents should\nremember that their children must encounter these temptations. Even\nbefore the birth of the child, the preparation should begin that will\nenable it to fight successfully the battle against evil.3\n199\n200 The Adventist Home\nIf before the birth of her child she is self-indulgent, if she is\nselfish, impatient, and exacting, these traits will be reflected in the\ndisposition of the child. Thus many children have received as a\nbirthright almost unconquerable tendencies to evil.\nBut if the mother unswervingly adheres to right principles, if she\nis temperate and self-denying, if she is kind, gentle, and unselfish,\nshe may give her child these same precious traits of character.4\nEssentials of Prenatal Care\u2014It is an error generally committed\nto make no difference in the life of a woman previous to the birth\nof her children. At this important period the labor of the mother\nshould be lightened. Great changes are going on in her system. It\nrequires a greater amount of blood, and therefore an increase of\nfood of the most nourishing quality to convert into blood. Unless\nshe has an abundant supply of nutritious food, she cannot retain\nher physical strength, and her offspring is robbed of vitality. [Note:\nSee Counsels On Diet And Foods, section, \u201cDiet During Pregnancy,\u201d\nfor further instruction on this point.] Her clothing also demands\nattention. Care should be taken to protect the body from a sense of\nchilliness. She should not call vitality unnecessarily to the surface\nto supply the want of sufficient clothing. If the mother is deprived[257]\nof an abundance of wholesome, nutritious food, she will lack in the\nquantity and quality of blood. Her circulation will be poor, and her\nchild will lack in the very same things. There will be an inability\nin the offspring to appropriate food which it can convert into good\nblood to nourish the system. The prosperity of mother and child\ndepends much upon good, warm clothing and a supply of nourishing\nfood.5\nGreat care should be exercised to have the surroundings of the\nmother pleasant and happy. The husband and father is under special\nresponsibility to do all in his power to lighten the burden of the wife\nand mother. He should bear, as much as possible, the burden of her\ncondition. He should be affable, courteous, kind, and tender, and\nspecially attentive to all her wants. Not half the care is taken of some\nwomen while they are bearing children that is taken of animals in\nthe stable.6\nAppetite Alone Not a Safe Guide\u2014The idea that women, be-\ncause of their special condition, may let the appetite run riot is a\nmistake based on custom, but not on sound sense. The appetite\nPrenatal Influences 201\nof women in this condition may be variable, fitful, and difficult to\ngratify; and custom allows her to have anything she may fancy, with-\nout consulting reason as to whether such food can supply nutrition\nfor her body and for the growth of her child. The food should be\nnutritious, but should not be of an exciting quality.... If ever there is\nneed of simplicity of diet and special care as to the quality of food\neaten, it is in this important period.\nWomen who possess principle, and who are well instructed, will\nnot depart from simplicity of diet at this time of all others. They\nwill consider that another life is dependent upon them and will be\ncareful in all their habits and especially in diet. They should not eat [258]\nthat which is innutritious and exciting, simply because it tastes good.\nThere are too many counselors ready to persuade them to do things\nwhich reason would tell them they ought not to do. Diseased children\nare born because of the gratification of appetite by the parents....\nIf so much food is taken into the stomach that the digestive\norgans are compelled to overwork in order to dispose of it and to\nfree the system from irritating substances, the mother does injustice\nto herself and lays the foundation of disease in her offspring. If she\nchooses to eat as she pleases and what she may fancy, irrespective of\nconsequences, she will bear the penalty, but not alone. Her innocent\nchild must suffer because of her indiscretion.7\nSelf-control and Temperance Are Necessary\u2014The mother\u2019s\nphysical needs should in no case be neglected. Two lives are de-\npending upon her, and her wishes should be tenderly regarded, her\nneeds generously supplied. But at this time above all others she\nshould avoid, in diet and in every other line, whatever would lessen\nphysical or mental strength. By the command of God Himself she is\nplaced under the most solemn obligation to exercise self-control.8\nThe basis of a right character in the future man is made firm by\nhabits of strict temperance in the mother prior to the birth of her\nchild.... This lesson should not be regarded with indifference.9\nEncourage Cheerful, Contented Disposition\u2014Every woman\nabout to become a mother, whatever may be her surroundings, should\nencourage constantly a happy, cheerful, contented disposition, know-\ning that for all her efforts in this direction she will be repaid tenfold\nin the physical, as well as the moral, character of her offspring. Nor [259]\nis this all. She can, by habit, accustom herself to cheerful thinking,\n202 The Adventist Home\nand thus encourage a happy state of mind and cast a cheerful reflec-\ntion of her own happiness of spirit upon her family and those with\nwhom she associates. And in a very great degree will her physical\nhealth be improved. A force will be imparted to the lifesprings, the\nblood will not move sluggishly, as would be the case if she were to\nyield to despondency and gloom. Her mental and moral health are\ninvigorated by the buoyancy of her spirits. The power of the will\ncan resist impressions of the mind and will prove a grand soother\nof the nerves. Children who are robbed of that vitality which they\nshould have inherited of their parents should have the utmost care.\nBy close attention to the laws of their being a much better condition\nof things can be established.10\nMaintain a Peaceful, Trustful Attitude\u2014She who expects to\nbecome a mother should keep her soul in the love of God. Her mind\nshould be at peace; she should rest in the love of Jesus, practicing the\nwords of Christ. She should remember that the mother is a laborer\ntogether with God.11\n1Manuscript 43, 1900.\n2The Ministry of Healing, 372.\n3Ibid., 371.\n4Ibid., 372, 373.\n5Testimonies for the Church 2:381, 382.\n6Ibid., 2:383.\n7Ibid., 382, 383.\n8The Ministry of Healing, 373.\n9Good Health, February, 1880.\n10A Solemn Appeal, 123, 124.\n11The Signs of the Times, April 9, 1896.\nChapter 44\u2014Care Of Little Children [260]\nCorrect Attitudes for the Nursing Mother\u2014The best food for\nthe infant is the food that nature provides. Of this it should not be\nneedlessly deprived. It is a heartless thing for a mother, for the sake\nof convenience or social enjoyment, to seek to free herself from the\ntender office of nursing her little one.1\nThe period in which the infant receives its nourishment from\nthe mother is critical. Many mothers, while nursing their infants,\nhave been permitted to overlabor and to heat their blood in cooking;\nand the nursling has been seriously affected, not only with fevered\nnourishment from the mother\u2019s breast, but its blood has been poi-\nsoned by the unhealthy diet of the mother, which has fevered her\nwhole system, thereby affecting the food of the infant. The infant\nwill also be affected by the condition of the mother\u2019s mind. If she\nis unhappy, easily agitated, irritable, giving vent to outbursts of\npassion, the nourishment the infant receives from its mother will\nbe inflamed, often producing colic, spasms, and in some instances\ncausing convulsions and fits.\nThe character also of the child is more or less affected by the\nnature of the nourishment received from the mother. How important\nthen that the mother, while nursing her infant, should preserve a\nhappy state of mind, having the perfect control of her own spirit.\nBy thus doing, the food of the child is not injured, and the calm,\nself-possessed course the mother pursues in the treatment of her\nchild has very much to do in molding the mind of the infant. If it is\nnervous and easily agitated, the mother\u2019s careful, unhurried manner\nwill have a soothing and correcting influence, and the health of the [261]\ninfant can be very much improved.2\nThe more quiet and simple the life of the child, the more favor-\nable it will be to both physical and mental development. At all times\nthe mother should endeavor to be quiet, calm, and self-possessed.3\nFood Is Not a Substitute for Attention \u2014Infants have been\ngreatly abused by improper treatment. If fretful, they have generally\n203\n204 The Adventist Home\nbeen fed to keep them quiet, when, in most cases, the very reason of\ntheir fretfulness was because of their having received too much food,\nmade injurious by the wrong habits of the mother. More food only\nmade the matter worse, for their stomachs were already overloaded.\nChildren are generally brought up from the cradle to indulge\nthe appetite and are taught that they live to eat. The mother does\nmuch toward the formation of the character of her children in their\nchildhood. She can teach them to control the appetite, or she can\nteach them to indulge the appetite and become gluttons. The mother\noften arranges her plans to accomplish a certain amount through\nthe day; and when the children trouble her, instead of taking time\nto soothe their little sorrows and divert them, something is given\nthem to eat to keep them still, which answers the purpose for a short\ntime but eventually makes things worse. The children\u2019s stomachs\nhave been pressed with food, when they had not the least want of it.\nAll that was required was a little of the mother\u2019s time and attention.\nBut she regarded her time as altogether too precious to devote to the\namusement of her children. Perhaps the arrangement of her house in\na tasteful manner for visitors to praise, and to have her food cooked\nin a fashionable style, are with her higher considerations than the[262]\nhappiness and health of her children.4\nFood to Be Wholesome and Inviting, but Simple \u2014Food\nshould be so simple that its preparation will not absorb all the time\nof the mother. It is true, care should be taken to furnish the table\nwith healthful food prepared in a wholesome and inviting manner.\nDo not think that anything you can carelessly throw together to serve\nas food is good enough for the children. But less time should be\ndevoted to the preparation of unhealthful dishes for the table, to\nplease a perverted taste, and more time to the education and training\nof the children.5\nPreparing the Baby\u2019s Layette \u2014In the preparation of the\nbaby\u2019s wardrobe, convenience, comfort, and health should be sought\nbefore fashion or a desire to excite admiration. The mother should\nnot spend time in embroidery and fancywork to make the little gar-\nments beautiful, thus taxing herself with unnecessary labor at the\nexpense of her own health and the health of her child. She should\nnot bend over sewing that severely taxes eyes and nerves, at a time\nwhen she needs much rest and pleasant exercise. She should realize\nCare Of Little Children 205\nher obligation to cherish her strength, that she may be able to meet\nthe demands that will be made upon her.6\nInsure Cleanliness, Warmth, Fresh Air \u2014Babies require\nwarmth, but a serious error is often committed in keeping them\nin overheated rooms, deprived to a great degree of fresh air....\nThe baby should be kept free from every influence that would\ntend to weaken or to poison the system. The most scrupulous care\nshould be taken to have everything about it sweet and clean. While [263]\nit may be necessary to protect the little ones from sudden or too\ngreat changes of temperature, care should be taken that, sleeping or\nwaking, day or night, they breathe a pure, invigorating atmosphere.7\nThe Care of Children in Sickness\u2014In many cases the sickness\nof children can be traced to errors in management. Irregularities in\neating, insufficient clothing in the chilly evening, lack of vigorous\nexercise to keep the blood in healthy circulation, or lack of abun-\ndance of air for its purification, may be the cause of the trouble. Let\nthe parents study to find the causes of the sickness and then remedy\nthe wrong conditions as soon as possible.\nAll parents have it in their power to learn much concerning the\ncare and prevention, and even the treatment, of disease. Especially\nought the mother to know what to do in common cases of illness in\nher family. She should know how to minister to her sick child. Her\nlove and insight should fit her to perform services for it which could\nnot so well be trusted to a stranger\u2019s hand.8\n1The Ministry of Healing, 383.\n2Counsels on Diet and Foods, 228.\n3The Ministry of Healing, 381.\n4A Solemn Appeal, 125, 126.\n5Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 141.\n6The Ministry of Healing, 381, 382.\n7Ibid., 381.\n8Ibid., 385.\nChapter 45\u2014Mother\u2019s First Duty Is To Train[264]\nChildren\nThe Possibilities in a Properly Trained Child\u2014God sees all\nthe possibilities in that mite of humanity. He sees that with proper\ntraining the child will become a power for good in the world. He\nwatches with anxious interest to see whether the parents will carry\nout His plan or whether by mistaken kindness they will destroy\nHis purpose, indulging the child to its present and eternal ruin. To\ntransform this helpless and apparently insignificant being into a\nblessing to the world and an honor to God is a great and grand\nwork. Parents should allow nothing to come between them and the\nobligation they owe to their children.1\nA Work for God and Country \u2014Those who keep the law of\nGod look upon their children with indefinable feelings of hope and\nfear, wondering what part they will act in the great conflict that is just\nbefore them. The anxious mother questions, \u201cWhat stand will they\ntake? What can I do to prepare them to act well their part, so that\nthey will be the recipients of eternal glory?\u201d Great responsibilities\nrest upon you, mothers. Although you may not stand in national\ncouncils, ... you may do a great work for God and your country. You\nmay educate your children. You may aid them to develop characters\nthat will not be swayed or influenced to do evil, but will sway and\ninfluence others to do right. By your fervent prayers of faith you can\nmove the arm that moves the world.2\nIt is in childhood and youth that instruction should be given. The[265]\nchildren should be educated for usefulness. They should be taught\nto do those things that are needful in the home life; and the parents\nshould make these duties as pleasant as possible with kindly words\nof instruction and approval.3\nHome Training Is Neglected by Many \u2014Notwithstanding\nboasted advancement that has been made in educational methods,\nthe training of children at the present day is sadly defective. It is\nthe home training that is neglected. Parents, and especially mothers,\n206\nMother\u2019s First Duty Is To Train Children 207\ndo not realize their responsibility. They have neither the patience to\ninstruct nor the wisdom to control the little ones entrusted to their\nkeeping.4\nIt is too true that mothers are not standing at their post of duty,\nfaithful to their motherhood. God requires of us nothing that we\ncannot in His strength perform, nothing that is not for our own good\nand the good of our children.5\nMothers to Seek Divine Aid\u2014Did mothers but realize the im-\nportance of their mission, they would be much in secret prayer,\npresenting their children to Jesus, imploring His blessing upon them,\nand pleading for wisdom to discharge aright their sacred duties.\nLet the mother improve every opportunity to mold and fashion the\ndisposition and habits of her children. Let her watch carefully the\ndevelopment of character, repressing traits that are too prominent,\nencouraging those that are deficient. Let her make her own life a\npure and noble example to her precious charge.\nThe mother should enter upon her work with courage and energy,\nrelying constantly upon divine aid in all her efforts. She should [266]\nnever rest satisfied until she sees in her children a gradual elevation\nof character, until they have a higher object in life than merely to\nseek their own pleasure.6\nIt is impossible to estimate the power of a praying mother\u2019s\ninfluence. She acknowledges God in all her ways. She takes her\nchildren before the throne of grace and presents them to Jesus,\npleading for His blessing upon them. The influence of those prayers\nis to those children as \u201ca wellspring of life.\u201d These prayers, offered\nin faith, are the support and strength of the Christian mother. To\nneglect the duty of praying with our children is to lose one of the\ngreatest blessings within our reach, one of the greatest helps amid\nthe perplexities, cares, and burdens of our lifework.7\nThe power of a mother\u2019s prayers cannot be too highly estimated.\nShe who kneels beside her son and daughter through the vicissitudes\nof childhood, through the perils of youth, will never know till the\njudgment the influence of her prayers upon the life of her children.\nIf she is connected by faith with the Son of God, the mother\u2019s\ntender hand may hold back her son from the power of temptation,\nmay restrain her daughter from indulging in sin. When passion is\nwarring for the mastery, the power of love, the restraining, earnest,\n208 The Adventist Home\ndetermined influence of the mother, may balance the soul on the side\nof right.8\nWhen Visitors Interrupt \u2014You should take time to talk and\npray with your little ones, and you should allow nothing to interrupt\nthat season of communion with God and with your children. You\ncan say to your visitors, \u201cGod has given me a work to do, and I have\nno time for gossiping.\u201d You should feel that you have a work to do\nfor time and for eternity. You owe your first duty to your children.9[267]\nBefore visitors, before every other consideration, your children\nshould come first.... The labor due your child during its early years\nwill admit of no neglect. There is no time in its life when the rule\nshould be forgotten.10\nDo not send them out-of-doors that you may entertain your\nvisitors, but teach them to be quiet and respectful in the presence of\nvisitors.11\nMothers to Be Models of Goodness and Nobility \u2014Mothers,\nbe careful of your precious moments. Remember that your children\nare passing forward where they may be beyond your educating and\ntraining. You may be to them the very model of all that is good and\npure and noble. Identify your interest with theirs.12\nIf you fail in everything else, be thorough, be efficient, here. If\nyour children come forth from the home training pure and virtuous,\nif they fill the least and lowest place in God\u2019s great plan of good for\nthe world, your life can never be called a failure and can never be\nreviewed with remorse.13\nInfant children are a mirror for the mother in which she may see\nreflected her own habits and deportment. How careful, then, should\nbe her language and behavior in the presence of these little learners!\nWhatever traits of character she wishes to see developed in them she\nmust cultivate in herself.14\nAim Higher Than the World\u2019s Standard\u2014The mother should\nnot be governed by the world\u2019s opinion, nor labor to reach its stan-\ndard. She should decide for herself what is the great end and aim\nof life and then bend all her efforts to attain that end. She may, for\nwant of time, neglect many things about her house, with no serious [268]\nevil results; but she cannot with impunity neglect the proper dis-\ncipline of her children. Their defective characters will publish her\nunfaithfulness. The evils which she permits to pass uncorrected, the\nMother\u2019s First Duty Is To Train Children 209\ncoarse, rough manners, the disrespect and disobedience, the habits of\nidleness and inattention, will reflect dishonor upon her and embitter\nher life. Mothers, the destiny of your children rests to a great extent\nin your hands. If you fail in duty, you may place them in Satan\u2019s\nranks, and make them his agents to ruin other souls. Or your faithful\ndiscipline and godly example may lead them to Christ, and they in\nturn will influence others, and thus many souls may be saved through\nyour instrumentality.15\nCultivate the Good; Repress the Evil \u2014Parents are to co-op-\nerate with God by bringing their children up in His love and fear.\nThey cannot displease Him more than by neglecting to train their\nchildren aright.... They are to carefully guard the words and actions\nof their little ones, lest the enemy shall gain an influence over them.\nThis he is intensely desirous of doing, that he may counterwork the\npurpose of God. Kindly, interestedly, tenderly, parents are to work\nfor their children, cultivating every good thing and repressing every\nevil thing which develops in the characters of their little ones.16\nThe Joy of Work Satisfactorily Done \u2014Children are the her-\nitage of the Lord, and we are answerable to Him for our management\nof His property. The education and training of their children to be\nChristians is the highest service that parents can render to God. It is\na work that demands patient labor\u2014a lifelong, diligent, and perse-\nvering effort. By a neglect of this trust we prove ourselves unfaithful [269]\nstewards....\nIn love, faith, and prayer let parents work for their households,\nuntil with joy they can come to God saying, \u201cBehold, I and the\nchildren whom the Lord hath given me.\u201d17\n1The Signs of the Times, September 25, 1901.\n2The Review and Herald, April 23, 1889.\n3Manuscript 12, 1898.\n4The Signs of the Times, March 11, 1886.\n5The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\n6The Signs of the Times, May 25, 1882.\n7Good Health, July, 1880.\n8The Signs of the Times, March 16, 1891.\n9The Signs of the Times, July 22, 1889.\n10Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 129.\n11The Signs of the Times, August 23, 1899.\n12The Review and Herald, September 15, 1891.\n210 The Adventist Home\n13Testimonies for the Church 5:44.\n14The Signs of the Times, September 9, 1886.\n15The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\n16Manuscript 49, 1901.\n17Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 195, 196.\nChapter 46\u2014The Stepmother [270]\nCounsel to a Stepmother\u2014Your marriage to one who is a father\nof children will prove to be a blessing to you.... You were in danger\nof becoming self-centered. You had precious traits of character that\nneeded to be awakened and exercised.... Through your new relations\nyou will gain an experience that will teach you how to deal with\nminds. By the care of children affection, love, and tenderness are\ndeveloped. The responsibilities resting upon you in your family\nmay be a means of great blessing to you. These children will be to\nyou a precious lesson book. They will bring you many blessings if\nyou read them aright. The train of thought awakened by their care\nwill call into exercise tenderness, love, and sympathy. Although\nthese children are not a part of your flesh and blood, yet through\nyour marriage to their father, they have become yours, to be loved,\ncherished, instructed, and ministered to by you. Your connection\nwith them will call into exercise thoughts and plans that will be\nof genuine benefit to you.... By the experience that you will gain\nin your home, you will lose the self-centered ideas that threatened\nto mar your work and will change the set plans that have needed\nsoftening and subduing....\nYou have needed to develop greater tenderness and larger sym-\npathy, that you might come close to those in need of gentle, sym-\npathetic, loving words. Your children will call out these traits of\ncharacter and will help you to develop breadth of mind and judgment.\nThrough loving association with them, you will learn to be more\ntender and sympathetic in your ministry for suffering humanity.1\nReproof to a Stepmother Who Lacked Love\u2014You loved your [271]\nhusband and married him. You knew that when you married him\nyou covenanted to become a mother to his children. But I saw a\nlack in you in this matter. You are sadly deficient. You do not love\nthe children of your husband, and unless there is an entire change,\na thorough reformation in you and in your manner of government,\n211\n212 The Adventist Home\nthese precious jewels are ruined. Love, manifestation of affection, is\nnot a part of your discipline....\nYou are making the lives of those dear children very bitter, espe-\ncially the daughter\u2019s. Where is the affection, the loving caress, the\npatient forbearance? Hatred lives in your unsanctified heart more\nthan love. Censure leaps from your lips more than praise and en-\ncouragement. Your manners, your harsh ways, your unsympathizing\nnature, are to that sensitive daughter like desolating hail upon a\ntender plant; it bends to every blast until its life is crushed out, and\nit lies bruised and broken.\nYour administration is drying up the channel of love, hopefulness,\nand joy in your children. A settled sadness is expressed in the\ncountenance of the girl, but, instead of awakening sympathy and\ntenderness in you, this arouses impatience and positive dislike. You\ncan change this expression to animation and cheerfulness if you\nchoose....\nChildren read the countenance of the mother; they understand\nwhether love or dislike is there expressed. You know not the work\nyou are doing. Does not the little sad face, the heaving sigh welling\nup from a pressed heart in its yearning call for love, awaken pity?2\nResults of Undue Severity\u2014Some time ago I was shown the\ncase of J. Her errors and wrongs were faithfully portrayed before[272]\nher; but in the last view given me I saw that the wrongs still existed,\nthat she was cold and unsympathizing with her husband\u2019s children.\nCorrection and reproof are not given by her for grave offenses merely,\nbut for trivial matters that should be passed by unnoticed. Constant\nfaultfinding is wrong, and the Spirit of Christ cannot abide in the\nheart where it exists. She is disposed to pass over the good in her\nchildren without a word of approval, but is ever ready to bear down\nwith censure if any wrong is seen. This ever discourages children\nand leads to habits of heedlessness. It stirs up the evil in the heart\nand causes it to cast up mire and dirt. In children who are habitually\ncensured there will be a spirit of \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d and evil passions\nwill frequently be manifested, regardless of consequences....\nSister J should cultivate love and sympathy. She should manifest\ntender affection for the motherless children under her care. This\nwould be a blessing to these children of God\u2019s love and would be\nreflected back upon her in affection and love.3\nStepmother 213\nWhen Double Care is Needed \u2014Children who have lost the\none in whose breasts maternal love has flowed have met with a loss\nthat can never be supplied. But when one ventures to stand in the\nplace of mother to the little stricken flock, a double care and burden\nrests upon her to be even more loving if possible, more forbearing of\ncensure and threatening than their own mother could have been, and\nin this way supply the loss which the little flock have sustained.4\n1Letter 329, 1904.\n2Testimonies for the Church 2:56-58.\n3Ibid., 3:531, 532.\n4Ibid., 2:58.\nChapter 47\u2014Christ\u2019s Encouragement to Mothers[273]\nJesus Blessed the Children \u2014In the days of Christ mothers\nbrought their children to Him, that He might lay His hands upon\nthem in blessing. By this act they showed their faith in Jesus and the\nintense anxiety of their hearts for the present and future welfare of\nthe little ones committed to their care. But the disciples could not\nsee the need of interrupting the Master just for the sake of noticing\nthe children, and as they were sending these mothers away, Jesus\nrebuked the disciples and commanded the crowd to make way for\nthese faithful mothers with their little children. Said He, \u201cSuffer\nlittle children, and forbid them not, to come unto Me: for of such is\nthe kingdom of heaven.\u201d\nAs the mothers passed along the dusty road and drew near the\nSaviour, He saw the unbidden tear and the quivering lip, as they\noffered a silent prayer in behalf of the children. He heard the words\nof rebuke from the disciples and promptly countermanded the order.\nHis great heart of love was open to receive the children. One after\nanother, He took them in His arms and blessed them, while one little\nchild lay fast asleep, reclining against His bosom. Jesus spoke words\nof encouragement to the mothers in reference to their work, and,\noh, what a relief was thus brought to their minds! With what joy\nthey dwelt upon the goodness and mercy of Jesus, as they looked\nback to that memorable occasion! His gracious words had removed\nthe burden from their hearts and inspired them with fresh hope and [274]\ncourage. All sense of weariness was gone.\nThis is an encouraging lesson to mothers for all time. After they\nhave done the best they can do for the good of their children, they\nmay bring them to Jesus. Even the babes in the mother\u2019s arms are\nprecious in His sight. And as the mother\u2019s heart yearns for the help\nshe knows she cannot give, the grace she cannot bestow, and she\ncasts herself and children into the merciful arms of Christ, He will\nreceive and bless them; He will give peace, hope, and happiness to\n214\nChrist\u2019s Encouragement to Mothers 215\nmother and children. This is a precious privilege which Jesus has\ngranted to all mothers.1\nJesus Still Invites the Mothers\u2014Christ, the Majesty of heaven,\nsaid, \u201cSuffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not:\nfor of such is the kingdom of God.\u201d Jesus does not send the children\nto the rabbis; He does not send them to the Pharisees; for He knows\nthat these men would teach them to reject their best Friend. The\nmothers that brought their children to Jesus did well.... Let mothers\nnow lead their children to Christ. Let ministers of the gospel take\nthe little children in their arms and bless them in the name of Jesus.\nLet words of tenderest love be spoken to the little ones; for Jesus\ntook the lambs of the flock in His arms and blessed them.2\nLet mothers come to Jesus with their perplexities. They will find\ngrace sufficient to aid them in the management of their children. The\ngates are open for every mother who would lay her burdens at the\nSaviour\u2019s feet.... He ... still invites the mothers to lead up their little\nones to be blessed by Him. Even the babe in its mother\u2019s arms may\ndwell under the shadow of the Almighty through the faith of the\npraying mother. John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit from [275]\nhis birth. If we live in communion with God, we too may expect\nthe divine Spirit to mould our little ones, even from their earliest\nmoments.3\nHearts of Young Are Susceptible\u2014He [Christ] identified Him-\nself with the lowly, the needy, and the afflicted. He took little\nchildren in His arms and descended to the level of the young. His\nlarge heart of love could comprehend their trials and necessities, and\nHe enjoyed their happiness. His spirit, wearied with the bustle and\nconfusion of the crowded city, tired of association with crafty and\nhypocritical men, found rest and peace in the society of innocent\nchildren. His presence never repulsed them. The Majesty of heaven\ncondescended to answer their questions and simplified His important\nlessons to meet their childish understanding. He planted in their\nyoung, expanding minds the seeds of truth that would spring up and\nproduce a plentiful harvest in their riper years.4\nHe knew that these children would listen to His counsel and\naccept Him as their Redeemer, while those who were worldly-wise\nand hardhearted would be less likely to follow Him and find a place\nin the kingdom of God. These little ones, by coming to Christ\n216 The Adventist Home\nand receiving His advice and benediction, had His image and His\ngracious words stamped upon their plastic minds, never to be effaced.\nWe should learn a lesson from this act of Christ, that the hearts of\nthe young are most susceptible to the teachings of Christianity,\neasy to influence toward piety and virtue, and strong to retain the\nimpressions received.5\n\u201cSuffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not:\nfor of such is the kingdom of heaven.\u201d These precious words are to\nbe cherished, not only by every mother, but by every father as well.\nThese words are an encouragement to parents to press their children[276]\ninto His notice, to ask in the name of Christ that the Father may\nlet His blessing rest upon their entire family. Not only are the best\nbeloved to receive particular attention, but also the restless, wayward\nchildren, who need careful training and tender guidance.6\n1Good Health, January, 1880.\n2The Review and Herald, March 24, 1896.\n3The Desire of Ages, 512.\n4Testimonies for the Church 4:141.\n5Ibid., 4:142.\n6The Signs of the Times, August 13, 1896.\nSection 11\u2014Children\u2014The Junior [277]\nPartners\nChapter 48\u2014Heaven\u2019s Estimate of Children[278]\n[279]\nChildren Are the Purchase of Christ\u2019s Blood\u2014Christ placed\nsuch a high estimate upon your children that He gave His life for\nthem. Treat them as the purchase of His blood. Patiently and firmly\ntrain them for Him. Discipline with love and forbearance. As you\ndo this, they will become a crown of rejoicing to you and will shine\nas lights in the world.1\nThe youngest child that loves and fears God is greater in His\nsight than the most talented and learned man who neglects the great\nsalvation. The youth who consecrate their hearts and lives to God\nhave, in so doing, placed themselves in connection with the Fountain\nof all wisdom and excellence.2\n\u201cOf Such Is the Kingdom of Heaven.\u201d\u2014The soul of the little\nchild that believes in Christ is as precious in His sight as are the\nangels about His throne. They are to be brought to Christ and trained\nfor Christ. They are to be guided in the path of obedience, not\nindulged in appetite or vanity.3\nIf we would but learn the wonderful lessons which Jesus sought\nto teach His disciples from a little child, how many things that now\nseem insurmountable difficulties would wholly disappear! When the\ndisciples came to Jesus, saying, \u201cWho is the greatest in the kingdom\nof heaven? ... Jesus called a little child unto Him, and set him in\nthe midst of them, and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be\nconverted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the\nkingdom of heaven.4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as[280]\nthis little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\u201d\nGod\u2019s Property Entrusted to Parents \u2014Children derive life\nand being from their parents, and yet it is through the creative power\nof God that your children have life, for God is the Life-giver. Let\nit be remembered that children are not to be treated as though they\nwere our own personal property. Children are the heritage of the\nLord, and the plan of redemption includes their salvation as well as\nours. They have been entrusted to parents in order that they might\n218\nHeaven\u2019s Estimate of Children 219\nbe brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, that they\nmight be qualified to do their work in time and eternity.5\nMothers, deal gently with your little ones. Christ was once a\nlittle child. For His sake honor the children. Look upon them as\na sacred charge, not to be indulged, petted, and idolized, but to be\ntaught to live pure, noble lives. They are God\u2019s property; He loves\nthem, and calls upon you to co-operate with Him in helping them to\nform perfect characters.6\nIf you would meet God in peace, feed His flock now with spiritual\nfood; for every child has the possibility of attaining unto eternal life.\nChildren and youth are God\u2019s peculiar treasure.7\nThe youth need to be impressed with the truth that their en-\ndowments are not their own. Strength, time, intellect, are but lent\ntreasures. They belong to God, and it should be the resolve of every\nyouth to put them to the highest use. He is a branch, from which\nGod expects fruit; a steward, whose capital must yield increase; a\nlight, to illuminate the world\u2019s darkness. Every youth, every child,\nhas a work to do for the honor of God and the uplifting of humanity.8\nThe Path to Heaven Is Suited to Children\u2019s Capacity\u2014I saw [281]\nthat Jesus knows our infirmities and has Himself shared our expe-\nrience in all things but in sin; therefore He has prepared for us a\npath suited to our strength and capacity and, like Jacob, has marched\nsoftly and in evenness with the children as they were able to endure,\nthat He might entertain us by the comfort of His company and be to\nus a perpetual guide. He does not despise, neglect, or leave behind\nthe children of the flock. He has not bidden us move forward and\nleave them. He has not traveled so hastily as to leave us with our\nchildren behind. Oh, no; but He has evened the path to life, even for\nchildren. And parents are required in His name to lead them along\nthe narrow way. God has appointed us a path suited to the strength\nand capacity of children.9\n1The Signs of the Times, April 3, 1901.\n2Messages to Young People, 329.\n3The Review and Herald, March 30, 1897.\n4Manuscript 13, 1891.\n5The Signs of the Times, September 10, 1894.\n6The Signs of the Times, August 23, 1899.\n7Letter 105, 1893.\n220 The Adventist Home\n8Education, 57, 58.\n9Testimonies for the Church 1:388, 389.\nChapter 49\u2014Mother\u2019s Helpers [282]\nChildren to Be Partners in the Home Firm\u2014Children as well\nas parents have important duties in the home. They should be taught\nthat they are a part of the home firm. They are fed and clothed\nand loved and cared for; and they should respond to these many\nmercies by bearing their share of the home burdens and bringing all\nthe happiness possible into the family of which they are members.1\nLet every mother teach her children that they are members of the\nfamily firm and must bear their share of the responsibilities of this\nfirm. Every member of the family should bear these responsibilities\nas faithfully as church members bear the responsibilities of church\nrelationships.\nLet the children know that they are helping father and mother by\ndoing little errands. Give them some work to do for you, and tell\nthem that afterward they can have a time to play.2\nChildren have active minds, and they need to be employed in\nlifting the burdens of practical life.... They should never be left to\npick up their own employment. Parents should control this matter\nthemselves.3\nParents and Children Have Obligations \u2014Parents are under\nobligation to feed and clothe and educate their children, and children\nare under obligation to serve their parents with cheerful, earnest\nfidelity. When children cease to feel their obligation to share the\ntoil and burden with their parents, then how would it suit them to\nhave their parents cease to feel their obligation to provide for them? [283]\nIn ceasing to do the duties that devolve upon them to be useful\nto their parents, to lighten their burdens by doing that which may\nbe disagreeable and full of toil, children miss their opportunity of\nobtaining a most valuable education that will fit them for future\nusefulness.4\nGod wants the children of all believers to be trained from their\nearliest years to share the burdens that their parents must bear in\ncaring for them. To them is given a portion of the home for their\n221\n222 The Adventist Home\nrooms and the right and privilege of having a place at the family\nboard. God requires parents to feed and clothe their children. But\nthe obligations of parents and children are mutual. On their part\nchildren are required to respect and honor their parents.5\nParents are not to be slaves to their children, doing all the sac-\nrificing, while the children are permitted to grow up careless and\nunconcerned, letting all the burdens rest upon their parents.6\nIndolence Taught Through Mistaken Kindness \u2014Children\nshould be taught very young to be useful, to help themselves, and\nto help others. Many daughters of this age can, without remorse of\nconscience, see their mothers toiling, cooking, washing, or ironing,\nwhile they sit in the parlor and read stories, knit edging, crochet, or\nembroider. Their hearts are as unfeeling as a stone.\nBut where does this wrong originate? Who are the ones usually\nmost to blame in this matter? The poor, deceived parents. They\noverlook the future good of their children and, in their mistaken\nfondness, let them sit in idleness or do that which is of but little\naccount, which requires no exercise of the mind or muscles, and\nthen excuse their indolent daughters because they are weakly. What\nhas made them weakly? In many cases it has been the wrong course[284]\nof the parents. A proper amount of exercise about the house would\nimprove both mind and body. But children are deprived of this\nthrough false ideas, until they are averse to work.7\nIf your children have been unaccustomed to labor, they will\nsoon become weary. They will complain of side ache, pain in\nthe shoulders, and tired limbs; and you will be in danger, through\nsympathy, of doing the work yourselves rather than have them suffer\na little. Let the burden upon the children be very light at first, and\nthen increase it a little every day, until they can do a proper amount\nof labor without becoming so weary.8\nPerils of Idleness \u2014I have been shown that much sin has re-\nsulted from idleness. Active hands and minds do not find time to\nheed every temptation which the enemy suggests, but idle hands\nand brains are all ready for Satan to control. The mind, when not\nproperly occupied, dwells upon improper things. Parents should\nteach their children that idleness is sin.9\nThere is nothing which more surely leads to evil than to lift\nall burdens from children, leaving them to an idle, aimless life, to\nMother\u2019s Helpers 223\ndo nothing, or to occupy themselves as they please. The minds of\nchildren are active, and if not occupied with that which is good and\nuseful, they will inevitably turn to what is bad. While it is right and\nnecessary for them to have recreation, they should be taught to work,\nto have regular hours for physical labor and also for reading and\nstudy. See that they have employment suited to their years and are\nsupplied with useful and interesting books.10\nThe Surest Safeguard Is Useful Occupation \u2014One of the\nsurest safeguards for the young is useful occupation. Had they [285]\nbeen trained to industrious habits, so that all their hours were use-\nfully employed, they would have no time for repining at their lot\nor for idle daydreaming. They would be in little danger of forming\nvicious habits or associations.11\nIf parents are so occupied with other things that they cannot keep\ntheir children usefully employed, Satan will keep them busy.12\nChildren Should Learn to Bear Burdens \u2014Parents should\nawaken to the fact that the most important lesson for their chil-\ndren to learn is that they must act their part in bearing the burdens of\nthe home.... Parents should teach their children to take a common-\nsense view of life, to realize that they are to be useful in the world.\nIn the home, under the supervision of a wise mother, boys and girls\nshould receive their first instruction in bearing the burdens of life.13\nThe education of the child for good or for evil begins in its\nearliest years.... As the older children grow up, they should help\nto care for the younger members of the family. The mother should\nnot wear herself out by doing work that her children might do and\nshould do.14\nSharing Burdens Gives Satisfaction\u2014Help your children, par-\nents, to do the will of God by being faithful in the performance of\nthe duties which really belong to them as members of the family.\nThis will give them a most valuable experience. It will teach them\nthat they are not to center their thoughts upon themselves, to do their\nown pleasure, or to amuse themselves. Patiently educate them to\nact their part in the family circle, to make a success of their efforts\nto share the burdens of father and mother and brothers and sisters. [286]\nThus they will have the satisfaction of knowing that they are really\nuseful.15\n224 The Adventist Home\nChildren can be educated to be helpful. They are naturally active\nand inclined to be busy; and this activity is susceptible of being\ntrained and directed in the right channel. Children may be taught,\nwhen young, to lift daily their light burdens, each child having some\nparticular task for the accomplishment of which he is responsible to\nhis parents or guardian. They will thus learn to bear the yoke of duty\nwhile young; and the performance of their little tasks will become\na pleasure, bringing them a happiness that is only gained by well-\ndoing. They will become accustomed to work and responsibility\nand will relish employment, perceiving that life holds for them more\nimportant business than that of amusing themselves....\nWork is good for children; they are happier to be usefully em-\nployed a large share of the time; their innocent amusements are\nenjoyed with a keener zest after the successful completion of their\ntasks. Labor strengthens both the muscles and the mind. Moth-\ners may make precious little helpers of their children; and, while\nteaching them to be useful, they may themselves gain knowledge\nof human nature and how to deal with these fresh, young beings\nand keep their hearts warm and youthful by contact with the little\nones. And as their children look to them in confidence and love, so\nmay they look to the dear Saviour for help and guidance. Children\nthat are properly trained, as they advance in years, learn to love that\nlabor which makes the burdens of their friends lighter.16\nAssures Mental Balance \u2014In the fulfillment of their appor-\ntioned tasks strength of memory and a right balance of mind may be\ngained, as well as stability of character and dispatch. The day, with[287]\nits round of little duties, calls for thought, calculation, and a plan\nof action. As the children become older, still more can be required\nof them. It should not be exhaustive labor, nor should their work\nbe so protracted as to fatigue and discourage them; but it should be\njudiciously selected with reference to the physical development most\ndesirable and the proper cultivation of the mind and character.17\nLinks With Workers in Heaven \u2014If children were taught to\nregard the humble round of everyday duties as the course marked\nout for them by the Lord, as a school in which they were to be trained\nto render faithful and efficient service, how much more pleasant and\nhonorable would their work appear! To perform every duty as unto\nthe Lord throws a charm around the humblest employment and links\nMother\u2019s Helpers 225\nthe workers on earth with the holy beings who do God\u2019s will in\nheaven.18\nWork is constantly being done in heaven. There are no idlers\nthere. \u201cMy Father worketh hitherto,\u201d said Christ, \u201cand I work.\u201d We\ncannot suppose that when the final triumph shall come, and we have\nthe mansions prepared for us, that idleness will be our portion, that\nwe shall rest in a blissful, do-nothing state.19\nStrengthens Home Ties\u2014In the home training of the youth the\nprinciple of co-operation is invaluable.... The older ones should be\ntheir parents\u2019 assistants, entering into their plans and sharing their\nresponsibilities and burdens. Let fathers and mothers take time to\nteach their children; let them show that they value their help, desire\ntheir confidence, and enjoy their companionship; and the children\nwill not be slow to respond. Not only will the parents\u2019 burden be\nlightened, and the children receive a practical training of inestimable [288]\nworth, but there will be a strengthening of the home ties and a\ndeepening of the very foundations of character.20\nMakes for Growth in Mental, Moral, Spiritual Excellence\u2014\nChildren and youth should take pleasure in making lighter the cares\nof father and mother, showing an unselfish interest in the home.\nAs they cheerfully lift the burdens that fall to their share, they are\nreceiving a training which will fit them for positions of trust and use-\nfulness. Each year they are to make steady advancement, gradually\nbut surely laying aside the inexperience of boyhood and girlhood\nfor the experience of manhood and womanhood. In the faithful\nperformance of the simple duties of the home boys and girls lay the\nfoundation for mental, moral, and spiritual excellence.21\nGives Health of Body, Peace of Mind\u2014The approval of God\nrests with loving assurance upon the children who cheerfully take\ntheir part in the duties of domestic life, sharing the burdens of father\nand mother. They will be rewarded with health of body and peace\nof mind; and they will enjoy the pleasure of seeing their parents\ntake their share of social enjoyment and healthful recreation, thus\nprolonging their lives. Children trained to the practical duties of life\nwill go out from the home to be useful members of society, with\nan education far superior to that gained by close confinement in the\nschoolroom at an early age, when neither the mind nor the body is\nstrong enough to endure the strain.22\n226 The Adventist Home\nIn some cases it would be better if children had less work in the\nschool and more training in the performance of home duties. Above\nall else they should be taught to be thoughtful and helpful. Many\nthings to be learned from books are far less essential than the lessons[289]\nof practical industry and discipline.23\nInsures Restful Sleep \u2014Mothers should take their daughters\nwith them into the kitchen and patiently educate them. Their consti-\ntution will be better for such labor, their muscles will gain tone and\nstrength, and their meditations will be more healthy and elevated at\nthe close of the day. They may be weary, but how sweet is rest after\na proper amount of labor! Sleep, nature\u2019s sweet restorer, invigorates\nthe weary body and prepares it for the next day\u2019s duties. Do not\nintimate to your children that it is no matter whether they labor or\nnot. Teach them that their help is needed, that their time is of value,\nand that you depend on their labor.24\nIt is a sin to let children grow up in idleness. Let them exercise\ntheir limbs and muscles, even if it wearies them. If they are not\noverworked, how can weariness harm them more than it harms\nyou? There is quite a difference between weariness and exhaustion.\nChildren need more frequent change of employment and intervals\nof rest than grown persons do; but even when quite young, they may\nbegin learning to work, and they will be happy in the thought that\nthey are making themselves useful. Their sleep will be sweet after\nhealthful labor, and they will be refreshed for the next day\u2019s work.25\nDo Not Say, \u201cMy Children Bother Me.\u201d \u2014\u201cOh,\u201d say some\nmothers, \u201cmy children bother me when they try to help me.\u201d So did\nmine, but do you think I let them know it? Praise your children.\nTeach them, line upon line, precept upon precept. This is better than\nreading novels, better than making calls, better than following the\nfashions of the world.26\nA View of the Pattern \u2014For a period of time the Majesty of[290]\nheaven, the King of glory, was only a Babe in Bethlehem and could\nonly represent the babe in its mother\u2019s arms. In childhood He could\nonly do the work of an obedient child, fulfilling the wishes of His\nparents, in doing such duties as would correspond to His ability as a\nchild. This is all that children can do, and they should be so educated\nand instructed that they may follow Christ\u2019s example. Christ acted\nin a manner that blessed the household in which He was found, for\nMother\u2019s Helpers 227\nHe was subject to His parents and thus did missionary work in His\nhome life. It is written, \u201cAnd the child grew, and waxed strong in\nspirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon Him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God\nand man.\u201d27\nIt is the precious privilege of teachers and parents to co-operate\nin teaching the children how to drink in the gladness of Christ\u2019s\nlife by learning to follow His example. The Saviour\u2019s early years\nwere useful years. He was His mother\u2019s helper in the home; and He\nwas just as verily fulfilling His commission when performing the\nduties of the home and working at the carpenter\u2019s bench as when He\nengaged in His public work of ministry.28\nIn His earth life Christ was an example to all the human family,\nand He was obedient and helpful in the home. He learned the car-\npenter\u2019s trade and worked with His own hands in the little shop at\nNazareth.... As He worked in childhood and youth, mind and body\nwere developed. He did not use His physical powers recklessly, but\nin such a way as to keep them in health, that He might do the best\nwork in every line.29\n1The Ministry of Healing, 394.\n2The Review and Herald, June 23, 1903.\n3Manuscript 57, 1897.\n4The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 20, 1893.\n5Manuscript 128, 1901.\n6Manuscript 126, 1897.\n7Testimonies for the Church 1:686.\n8Ibid., 1:686.\n9Ibid., 1:395.\n10Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 134, 135.\n11The Review and Herald, September 13, 1881.\n12The Signs of the Times, April 3, 1901.\n13Letter 106, 1901.\n14Manuscript 126, 1903.\n15Manuscript 27, 1896.\n16The Health Reformer, December, 1877.\n17Ibid.\n18Patriarchs and Prophets, 574.\n19Manuscript 126, 1897.\n20Education, 285.\n21Messages to Young People, 211, 212.\n228 The Adventist Home\n22Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 148.\n23Manuscript 126, 1903.\n24Testimonies for the Church 1:395.\n25Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 135.\n26Manuscript 31, 1901.\n27The Signs of the Times, September 17, 1894.\n28The Review and Herald, May 6, 1909.\n29Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 147.\nChapter 50\u2014The Honor Due Parents [291]\n[292]\nThe Child\u2019s Indebtedness to Parents \u2014Children should feel\nthat they are indebted to their parents, who have watched over them\nin infancy and nursed them in sickness. They should realize that\ntheir parents have suffered much anxiety on their account. Especially\nhave conscientious, godly parents felt the deepest interest that their\nchildren should take a right course. As they have seen faults in their\nchildren, how heavy have been their hearts! If the children who\ncaused those hearts to ache could see the effect of their course, they\nwould certainly relent. If they could see their mother\u2019s tears and\nhear her prayers to God in their behalf, if they could listen to her\nsuppressed and broken sighs, their hearts would feel and they would\nspeedily confess their wrongs and ask to be forgiven.1\nChildren, when they become of age, will prize the parent who\nlabored faithfully, and would not permit them to cherish wrong\nfeelings or indulge in evil habits.2\nA Command Binding on All \u2014\u201cHonor thy father and thy\nmother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord\nthy God giveth thee.\u201d This is the first commandment with promise.\nIt is binding upon childhood and youth, upon the middle-aged and\nthe aged. There is no period in life when children are excused from\nhonoring their parents. This solemn obligation is binding upon every\nson and daughter and is one of the conditions to their prolonging\ntheir lives upon the land which the Lord will give the faithful. This\nis not a subject unworthy of notice, but a matter of vital importance.\nThe promise is upon condition of obedience. If you obey, you shall [293]\nlive long in the land which the Lord your God gives you. If you\ndisobey, you shall not prolong your life in that land.3\nParents are entitled to a degree of love and respect which is due\nto no other person. God Himself, who has placed upon them a re-\nsponsibility for the souls committed to their charge, has ordained\nthat during the earlier years of life parents shall stand in the place\nof God to their children. And he who rejects the rightful authority\n229\n230 The Adventist Home\nof his parents is rejecting the authority of God. The fifth command-\nment requires children not only to yield respect, submission, and\nobedience to their parents, but also to give them love and tenderness,\nto lighten their cares, to guard their reputation, and to succor and\ncomfort them in old age.4\nGod cannot prosper those who go directly contrary to the plainest\nduty specified in His word, the duty of children to their parents....\nIf they disrespect and dishonor their earthly parents, they will not\nrespect and love their Creator.5\nWhen children have unbelieving parents, and their commands\ncontradict the requirements of Christ, then, painful though it may\nbe, they must obey God and trust the consequences with Him.6\nMany Are Breaking the Fifth Commandment\u2014In these last\ndays children are so noted for their disobedience and disrespect that\nGod has especially noticed it, and it constitutes a sign that the end is\nnear. It shows that Satan has almost complete control of the minds\nof the young. By many, age is no more respected.7\nThere are many children who profess to know the truth who do\nnot render to their parents the honor and affection that are due to[294]\nthem, who manifest but little love to father and mother, and fail to\nhonor them in deferring to their wishes or in seeking to relieve them\nof anxiety. Many who profess to be Christians do not know what it\nmeans to \u201chonor thy father and thy mother\u201d and consequently will\nknow just as little what it means, \u201cthat thy days may be long upon\nthe land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\u201d8\nIn this rebellious age children who have not received right in-\nstruction and discipline have but little sense of their obligations to\ntheir parents. It is often the case that the more their parents do for\nthem, the more ungrateful they are and the less they respect them.\nChildren who have been petted and waited upon always expect it;\nand if their expectations are not met, they are disappointed and dis-\ncouraged. This same disposition will be seen through their whole\nlives; they will be helpless, leaning upon others for aid, expecting\nothers to favor them and yield to them. And if they are opposed,\neven after they have grown to manhood and womanhood, they think\nthemselves abused; and thus they worry their way through the world,\nhardly able to bear their own weight, often murmuring and fretting\nbecause everything does not suit them.9\nHonor Due Parents 231\nNo Place in Heaven for Ungrateful Children\u2014I saw that Sa-\ntan had blinded the minds of the youth that they could not compre-\nhend the truths of God\u2019s word. Their sensibilities are so blunted that\nthey regard not the injunctions of the holy apostle:\n\u201cChildren, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Hon-\nour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with\npromise; that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long\non the [new] earth.\u201d \u201cChildren, obey your parents in all things: for [295]\nthis is well pleasing unto the Lord.\u201d Children who dishonor and\ndisobey their parents, and disregard their advice and instructions,\ncan have no part in the earth made new. The purified new earth will\nbe no place for the rebellious, the disobedient, the ungrateful son or\ndaughter. Unless such learn obedience and submission here, they\nwill never learn it; the peace of the ransomed will not be marred\nby disobedient, unruly, unsubmissive children. No commandment\nbreaker can inherit the kingdom of heaven.10\nLove to Be Manifested\u2014I have seen children who seemed to\nhave no affection to give to their parents, no expressions of love and\nendearment, which are due them and which they would appreciate;\nbut they lavish an abundance of affection and caresses to select ones\nfor whom they show preference. Is this as God would have it? No,\nno. Bring all the rays of sunshine, of love, and of affection into\nthe home circle. Your father and mother will appreciate these little\nattentions you can give. Your efforts to lighten the burdens, and\nto repress every word of fretfulness and ingratitude, show that you\nare not a thoughtless child, and that you do appreciate the care and\nlove that has been bestowed upon you in the years of your helpless\ninfancy and childhood.11\nChildren, it is necessary that your mothers love you, or else you\nwould be very unhappy. And is it not also right that children love\ntheir parents, and show this love by pleasant looks, pleasant words,\nand cheerful, hearty cooperation, helping the father out-of-doors and\nthe mother indoors?12\nDeeds Considered As Though Done to Jesus\u2014If you are truly\nconverted, if you are children of Jesus, you will honor your parents; [296]\nyou will not only do what they tell you but will watch for oppor-\ntunities to help them. In doing this you are working for Jesus. He\nconsiders all these care-taking, thoughtful deeds as done to Himself.\n232 The Adventist Home\nThis is the most important kind of missionary work; and those who\nare faithful in these little everyday duties are gaining a valuable\nexperience.13\n1Testimonies for the Church 1:395, 396.\n2The Signs of the Times, July 13, 1888.\n3Testimonies for the Church 2:80, 81.\n4Patriarchs and Prophets, 308.\n5Testimonies for the Church 3:232.\n6The Review and Herald, November 15, 1892.\n7Testimonies for the Church 1:217, 218.\n8Messages to Young People, 331.\n9Testimonies for the Church 1:392, 393.\n10Ibid., 1:497, 498.\n11The Youth\u2019s Instructor, April 21, 1886.\n12Manuscript 129, 1898.\n13The Youth\u2019s Instructor, January 30, 1884.\nChapter 51\u2014Counsel to Children [297]\nSeek God Early \u2014Children and youth should begin early to\nseek God; for early habits and impressions will frequently exert\na powerful influence upon the life and character. Therefore the\nyouth who would be like Samuel, John, and especially like Christ,\nmust be faithful in the things which are least, turning away from\nthe companions who plan evil and who think that their life in the\nworld is to be one of pleasure and selfish indulgence. Many of the\nlittle home duties are overlooked as of no consequence; but if the\nsmall things are neglected, the larger duties will be also. You want\nto be whole men and women, with pure, sound, noble characters.\nBegin the work at home; take up the little duties and do them with\nthoroughness and exactness. When the Lord sees you are faithful in\nthat which is least, He will entrust you with larger responsibilities.\nBe careful how you build, and what kind of material you put into\nthe building. The characters you are now forming will be lasting as\neternity.\nLet Jesus take possession of your mind, your heart, and your\naffections; and work as Christ worked, doing conscientiously the\nhome duties, little acts of self-denial and deeds of kindness, employ-\ning the moments diligently, keeping a careful watch against little\nsins and a grateful heart for little blessings, and you will have at last\nsuch a testimony for yourself as was given of John and Samuel, and\nespecially of Christ: \u201cAnd Jesus increased in wisdom and stature,\nand in favor with God and man.\u201d1\n\u201cGive Me Thine Heart.\u201d\u2014The Lord says to the young, \u201cMy\nson, give Me thine heart.\u201d The Saviour of the world loves to have [298]\nchildren and youth give their hearts to Him. There may be a large\narmy of children who shall be found faithful to God, because they\nwalk in the light as Christ is in the light. They will love the Lord\nJesus, and it will be their delight to please Him. They will not be\nimpatient if reproved, but will make glad the heart of father and\nmother by their kindness, their patience, their willingness to do\n233\n234 The Adventist Home\nall they can in helping to bear the burdens of daily life. Through\nchildhood and youth they will be found faithful disciples of our\nLord.2\nAn Individual Choice to Be Made\u2014Watch and pray, and ob-\ntain a personal experience in the things of God. Your parents may\nteach you, they may try to guide your feet into safe paths; but it is\nimpossible for them to change your heart. You must give your heart\nto Jesus and walk in the precious light of truth that He has given\nyou. Faithfully take up your duties in the home life, and, through the\ngrace of God, you may grow up unto the full stature of what Christ\nwould have a child grow to be in Him. The fact that your parents\nkeep the Sabbath, and obey the truth, will not insure your salvation.\nFor though Noah and Job and Daniel were in the land, \u201cAs I live,\nsaith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they\nshall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.\u201d\nIn childhood and youth you may have an experience in the ser-\nvice of God. Do the things that you know to be right. Be obedient to\nyour parents. Listen to their counsels; for if they love and fear God,\nupon them will be laid the responsibility of educating, disciplining,\nand training your soul for the immortal life. Thankfully receive the\nhelp they want to give you, and make their hearts glad by cheerfully[299]\nsubmitting yourselves to the dictates of their wiser judgments. In\nthis way you will honor your parents, glorify God, and become a\nblessing to those with whom you associate.3\nFight the battle, children; remember every victory places you\nabove the enemy.4\nChildren to Pray for Help\u2014Children should pray for grace to\nresist the temptations which will come to them\u2014temptations to have\ntheir own way and to do their own selfish pleasure. As they ask\nChrist to help them in their life service to be truthful, kind, obedient,\nand to bear their responsibilities in the family circle, He will hear\ntheir simple prayer.5\nJesus would have the children and the youth come to Him with\nthe same confidence with which they go to their parents. As a child\nasks his mother or father for bread when he is hungry, so the Lord\nwould have you ask Him for the things which you need....\nJesus knows the needs of children, and He loves to listen to their\nprayers. Let the children shut out the world and everything that\nCounsel to Children 235\nwould attract the thoughts from God; and let them feel that they are\nalone with God, that His eye looks into the inmost heart and reads\nthe desire of the soul, and that they may talk with God....\nThen, children, ask God to do for you those things that you can-\nnot do for yourselves. Tell Jesus everything. Lay open before Him\nthe secrets of your heart; for His eye searches the inmost recesses of\nthe soul, and He reads your thoughts as an open book. When you\nhave asked for the things that are necessary for your soul\u2019s good,\nbelieve that you receive them, and you shall have them.6\nPerform the Home Duties Cheerfully \u2014Children and youth [300]\nshould be missionaries at home by doing those things that need to\nbe done and that someone must do.... You can prove by faithful\nperformance of the little things that seem to you unimportant that\nyou have a true missionary spirit. It is the willingness to do the\nduties that lie in your path, to relieve your overburdened mother, that\nwill prove you worthy of being entrusted with larger responsibilities.\nYou do not think that washing dishes is pleasant work, yet you would\nnot like to be denied the privilege of eating food that has been placed\non those dishes. Do you think that it is more pleasant work for your\nmother to do those things than it is for you? Are you willing to leave\nwhat you consider a disagreeable task for your careworn mother to\ndo, while you play the lady? There is sweeping to be done, there are\nrugs to take up and shake, and the rooms are to be put in order; and\nwhile you are neglecting to do these things, is it consistent for you\nto desire larger responsibilities? Have you considered how many\ntimes mother has to attend to all these household duties while you\nare excused to attend school or amuse yourself?7\nMany children go about their home duties as though they were\ndisagreeable tasks, and their faces plainly show the disagreeable.\nThey find fault and murmur, and nothing is done willingly. This\nis not Christlike; it is the spirit of Satan, and if you cherish it, you\nwill be like him. You will be miserable yourselves and will make\nall about you miserable. Do not complain of how much you have to\ndo and how little time you have for amusement, but be thoughtful\nand care-taking. By employing your time in some useful work, you\nwill be closing a door against Satan\u2019s temptations. Remember that\nJesus lived not to please Himself, and you must be like Him. Make\nthis matter one of religious principle, and ask Jesus to help you. [301]\n236 The Adventist Home\nBy exercising your mind in this direction, you will be preparing\nto become burden bearers in the cause of God as you have been\ncaretakers in the home circle. You will have a good influence upon\nothers and may win them to the service of Christ.8\nGive Mothers Change and Rest \u2014It is difficult for a loving\nmother to urge her children to help her when she sees they have no\nheart in the work and will frame any and every excuse to get rid of\ndoing a disagreeable task Children and youth, Christ is looking upon\nyou, and shall He see you neglecting the trust He has put into your\nhands? If you want to be useful, the opportunity is yours. Your first\nduty is to help your mother who has done so much for you. Lift her\nburdens, give her pleasant days of rest; for she has had few holidays\nand very little variety in her life. You have claimed all the pleasure\nand amusement as your right, but the time has come for you to shed\nsunshine in the home. Take up your duty; go right to work. Through\nyour self-denying devotion give her rest and pleasure.9\nGod\u2019s Reward for the Daniels of Today\u2014There is now need\nof men who, like Daniel, will do and dare. A pure heart and a strong,\nfearless hand are wanted in the world today. God designed that man\nshould be constantly improving, daily reaching a higher point in the\nscale of excellence. He will help us if we seek to help ourselves. Our\nhope of happiness in two worlds depends upon our improvement in\none....\nDear youth, God calls upon you to do a work which through\nHis grace you can do. \u201cPresent your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,\nacceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.\u201d Stand forth[302]\nin your God-given manhood and womanhood. Show a purity of\ntastes, appetite, and habits that bears comparison with Daniel\u2019s.\nGod will reward you with calm nerves, a clear brain, an unimpaired\njudgment, keen perceptions. The youth of today whose principles\nare firm and unwavering will be blessed with health of body, mind,\nand soul.10\nBegin Now to Redeem the Past\u2014The youth are now deciding\ntheir own eternal destiny, and I would appeal to you to consider the\ncommandment to which God has annexed such a promise, \u201cThat\nthy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth\nthee.\u201d Children, do you desire eternal life? Then respect and honor\nyour parents. Do not wound and grieve their hearts and cause them\nCounsel to Children 237\nto spend sleepless nights in anxiety and distress over your case. If\nyou have sinned in not rendering love and obedience to them, begin\nnow to redeem the past. You cannot afford to take any other course;\nfor it means to you the loss of eternal life.11\n1The Youth\u2019s Instructor, November 3, 1886.\n2Messages to Young People, 333.\n3The Youth\u2019s Instructor, August 17, 1893.\n4Manuscript 19, 1887.\n5The Review and Herald, November 17, 1896.\n6The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 7, 1892.\n7The Youth\u2019s Instructor, March 2, 1893.\n8The Youth\u2019s Instructor, January 30, 1884.\n9The Youth\u2019s Instructor, March 2, 1893.\n10The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 9, 1903.\n11The Youth\u2019s Instructor, June 22, 1893.\n238 The Adventist Home\nSection 12\u2014Standards of Family Living [303]\nChapter 52\u2014Home Government[304]\n[305]\nThe Guiding Principle for Parents\u2014Many in the world have\ntheir affections on things that may be good in themselves, but their\nminds are satisfied with these things and do not seek the greater\nand higher good that Christ desires to give them. Now we must not\nrudely seek to deprive them of what they hold dear. Reveal to them\nthe beauty and preciousness of truth. Lead them to behold Christ\nand His loveliness; then they will turn aside from everything that\nwill draw their affections away from Him. This is the principle upon\nwhich parents should work in the training of their children. By your\nmanner of dealing with the little ones you can by the grace of Christ\nmold their characters for everlasting life.1\nFathers and mothers should make it their life study that their\nchildren may become as nearly perfect in character as human effort,\ncombined with divine aid, can make them. This work, with all its\nimportance and responsibility, they have accepted, in that they have\nbrought children into the world.2\nRules Necessary for Government in the Home\u2014Every Chris-\ntian home should have rules; and parents should, in their words and\nin their deportment toward each other, give to the children a precious\nliving example of what they desire them to be.... Teach the children\nand youth to respect themselves, to be true to God, true to principle;\nteach them to respect and obey the law of God. Then these principles\nwill control their lives and will be carried out in their association\nwith others.3\nBible Principles to Be Followed \u2014There is need for constant[306]\nwatching that the principles which lie at the foundation of family\ngovernment are not disregarded. The Lord designs that the families\non earth shall be symbols of the family in heaven. And when earthly\nfamilies are conducted in right lines, the same sanctification of the\nSpirit will be brought into the church.4\nParents should themselves be converted and know what it is\nto be in submission to God\u2019s will, as little children, bringing into\n240\nHome Government 241\ncaptivity their thoughts to the will of Jesus Christ, before they can\nrightly represent the government that God designed should exist in\nthe family.5\nGod Himself established the family relations. His word is the\nonly safe guide in the management of children. Human philosophy\nhas not discovered more than God knows or devised a wiser plan of\ndealing with children than that given by our Lord. Who can better\nunderstand all the needs of children than their Creator? Who can feel\na deeper interest in their welfare than He who bought them with His\nown blood? If the word of God were carefully studied and faithfully\nobeyed, there would be less soul anguish over the perverse conduct\nof wicked children.6\nRespect the Children\u2019s Rights\u2014Remember that children have\nrights which must be respected.7\nChildren have claims which their parents should acknowledge\nand respect. They have a right to such an education and training as\nwill make them useful, respected, and beloved members of society\nhere, and give them a moral fitness for the society of the pure and\nholy hereafter. The young should be taught that both their present\nand their future well-being depend to a great degree on the habits\nthey form in childhood and youth. They should be early accus- [307]\ntomed to submission, self-denial, and a regard for others\u2019 happiness.\nThey should be taught to subdue the hasty temper, to withhold the\npassionate word, to manifest unvarying kindness, courtesy, and self-\ncontrol.8\nTo a Parent Deluded by Blind Affection \u2014Blind affection, a\ncheap manifestation of love, goes a long ways with you. To encircle\nthe arms about the neck is easy; but manifestations should not be en-\ncouraged by you unless they are proved to be of real value by perfect\nobedience. Your indulgence, your disregard of God\u2019s requirements\nis the veriest cruelty. You encourage and excuse disobedience by\nsaying, \u201cMy boy loves me.\u201d Such love is cheap and deceptive. It\nis no love at all. The love, the genuine love, to be cultivated in the\nfamily is of value because it is verified by obedience....\nIf you love the souls of your children, bring them into order.\nBut abundant kisses and tokens of love blind your eyes, and your\nchildren know it. Make less of these outward demonstrations of\nembracing and kissing and go down to the bottom of things and\n242 The Adventist Home\nshow what constitutes filial love. Refuse these manifestations as a\nfraud, a deception, unless backed up by obedience and respect for\nyour commands.9\nManifest Neither Blind Affection nor Undue Severity \u2014\nWhile we are not to indulge blind affection, neither are we to mani-\nfest undue severity. Children cannot be brought to the Lord by force.\nThey can be led, but not driven. \u201cMy sheep hear My voice, and I\nknow them, and they follow Me,\u201d Christ declares. He did not say, My\nsheep hear My voice and are forced into the path of obedience. In the\ngovernment of children love must be shown. Never should parents[308]\ncause their children pain by harshness or unreasonable exactions.\nHarshness drives souls into Satan\u2019s net.10\nThe combined influence of authority and love will make it pos-\nsible to hold firmly and kindly the reins of family government. An\neye single to the glory of God and to what our children owe Him\nwill keep us from looseness and from sanctioning evil.11\nHarshness Not Requisite to Obedience\u2014Let none imagine ...\nthat harshness and severity are necessary to secure obedience. I\nhave seen the most efficient family government maintained without\na harsh word or look. I have been in other families where commands\nwere constantly given in an authoritative tone, and harsh rebukes\nand severe punishments were often administered. In the first case\nthe children followed the course pursued by the parents and seldom\nspoke to one another in harsh tones. In the second also the parental\nexample was imitated by the children; and cross words, faultfindings,\nand disputes were heard from morning till night.12\nWords that intimidate, creating fear and expelling love from the\nsoul, are to be restrained. A wise, tender, God-fearing father will\nbring, not a slavish fear, but an element of love into the home. If we\ndrink of the water of life, the fountain will send forth sweet water,\nnot bitter.13\nHarsh words sour the temper and wound the hearts of children,\nand in some cases these wounds are difficult to heal. Children are\nsensitive to the least injustice, and some become discouraged under\nit and will neither heed the loud, angry voice of command nor care\nfor threatenings of punishment.14\nThere is danger of too severely criticizing small things. Criticism\nthat is too severe, rules that are too rigid, lead to the disregard of[309]\nHome Government 243\nall regulations; and by and by children thus educated will show the\nsame disrespect for the laws of Christ.15\nUniform Firmness, Unimpassioned Control Necessary \u2014\nChildren have sensitive, loving natures. They are easily pleased\nand easily made unhappy. By gentle discipline in loving words\nand acts mothers may bind their children to their hearts. To man-\nifest severity and to be exacting with children are great mistakes.\nUniform firmness and unimpassioned control are necessary to the\ndiscipline of every family. Say what you mean calmly, move with\nconsideration, and carry out what you say without deviation.\nIt will pay to manifest affection in your association with your\nchildren. Do not repel them by lack of sympathy in their childish\nsports, joys, and griefs. Never let a frown gather upon your brow\nor a harsh word escape your lips. God writes all these words in His\nbook of records.16\nRestraint and Caution Not Enough \u2014Dear brethren, as a\nchurch you have sadly neglected your duty toward the children and\nyouth. While rules and restrictions are laid upon them, great care\nshould be taken to show them the Christlike side of your character\nand not the satanic side. Children need constant watchcare and ten-\nder love. Bind them to your hearts, and keep the love as well as the\nfear of God before them. Fathers and mothers do not control their\nown spirit and therefore are not fit to govern others. To restrain and\ncaution your children is not all that is required. You have yet to learn\nto do justly and love mercy, as well as to walk humbly with God.17\nCounsel to the Mother of a Strong-willed Child\u2014Your child\nis not your own; you cannot do with her as you like, for she is the [310]\nproperty of the Lord. Exercise a steady persevering control over her;\nteach her that she belongs to God. With such a training she will grow\nup to be a blessing to those around her. But clear, sharp discernment\nwill be necessary in order that you may repress her inclination to rule\nyou both, to have her own will and way, and to do as she pleases.18\nEven, Steady Management\u2014I have seen many families ship-\nwrecked through overmanagement on the part of their head, whereas\nthrough consultation and agreement all might have moved off har-\nmoniously and well.19\nUnsteadiness in family government is productive of great harm,\nin fact is nearly as bad as no government at all. The question is\n244 The Adventist Home\noften asked, Why are the children of religious parents so often\nheadstrong, defiant, and rebellious? The reason is to be found in the\nhome training. Too often the parents are not united in their family\ngovernment.20\nA fitful government\u2014at one time holding the lines firmly, and at\nanother allowing that which has been condemned\u2014is ruination to a\nchild.21\nMutual Law for Parents and Children\u2014God is our Lawgiver\nand King, and parents are to place themselves under His rule. This\nrule forbids all oppression from parents and all disobedience from\nchildren. The Lord is full of lovingkindness, mercy, and truth. His\nlaw is holy, just, and good, and must be obeyed by parents and\nchildren. The rules which should regulate the lives of parents and\nchildren flow from a heart of infinite love, and God\u2019s rich blessing\nwill rest upon those parents who administer His law in their homes,\nand upon the children who obey this law. The combined influence[311]\nof mercy and justice is to be felt. \u201cMercy and truth are met together;\nrighteousness and peace have kissed each other.\u201d Households under\nthis discipline will walk in the way of the Lord, to do justice and\njudgment.22\n1Manuscript 4, 1893.\n2Fundamentals of Christian Education, 67.\n3Letter 74, 1896.\n4Manuscript 80, 1898.\n5The Review and Herald, March 13, 1894.\n6The Signs of the Times, November 24, 1881.\n7Letter 47a, 1902.\n8Fundamentals of Christian Education, 67.\n9Letter 52, 1886.\n10The Review and Herald, January 29, 1901.\n11Manuscript 24, 1887.\n12The Signs of the Times, March 11, 1886.\n13Letter 8a, 1896.\n14Testimonies for the Church 3:532.\n15Manuscript 7, 1899.\n16Testimonies for the Church 3:532.\n17Ibid., 4:621.\n18Letter 69, 1896.\n19Testimonies for the Church 4:127.\n20The Signs of the Times, February 9, 1882.\nHome Government 245\n21Letter 69, 1896.\n22Manuscript 133, 1898.\nChapter 53\u2014A United Front[312]\nResponsibilities in Government to Be Shared\u2014Unitedly and\nprayerfully the father and mother should bear the grave responsibility\nof guiding their children aright.1\nParents are to work together as a unit. There must be no division.\nBut many parents work at cross-purposes, and thus the children are\nspoiled by mismanagement.... It sometimes happens that, of the\nmother and father, one is too indulgent and the other too severe.\nThis difference works against good results in the formation of the\ncharacters of their children. No harsh force is to be exercised in\ncarrying out reforms, but at the same time no weak indulgence must\nbe shown. The mother is not to seek to blind the eyes of the father\nto the faults of the children, neither is she to influence them to do\nthose things which the father has forbidden them to do. Not one seed\nof doubt should the mother plant in her children\u2019s minds in regard\nto the wisdom of the father\u2019s management. She should not, by her\ncourse of action, counteract the work of the father.2\nIf fathers and mothers are at variance, one working against the\nother to counteract each other\u2019s influence, the family will be in a\ndemoralized condition, and neither the father nor the mother will\nreceive the respect and confidence that are essential to a well-gov-\nerned family.... Children are quick to discern anything that will cast\na reflection upon the rules and regulations of a household, especially\nthose regulations that restrict their actions.3\nThe father and mother should unite in disciplining their children;[313]\neach should bear a share of the responsibility, acknowledging them-\nselves under solemn obligations to God to train up their offspring in\nsuch a way as to secure to them, as far as possible, good physical\nhealth and well-developed characters.4\nHow Lessons in Deception May Be Given\u2014Some fond moth-\ners suffer wrongs in their children which should not be allowed in\nthem for a moment. The wrongs of the children are sometimes con-\ncealed from the father. Articles of dress or some other indulgence\n246\nUnited Front 247\nis granted by the mother with the understanding that the father is to\nknow nothing about it, for he would reprove for these things.\nHere a lesson of deception is effectually taught the children.\nThen if the father discovers these wrongs, excuses are made and\nbut half the truth told. The mother is not openhearted. She does\nnot consider as she should that the father has the same interest in\nthe children as herself, and that he should not be kept ignorant of\nthe wrongs or besetments that ought to be corrected in them while\nyoung. Things have been covered. The children know the lack of\nunion in their parents, and it has its effect. The children begin young\nto deceive, cover up, tell things in a different light from what they\nare to their mother as well as their father. Exaggeration becomes\nhabit, and blunt falsehoods come to be told with but little conviction\nor reproof of conscience.\nThese wrongs commenced by the mother\u2019s concealing things\nfrom the father, who has an equal interest with her in the character\ntheir children are forming. The father should have been consulted\nfreely. All should have been laid open to him. But the opposite\ncourse, taken to conceal the wrongs of the children, encourages in [314]\nthem a disposition to deceive, a lack of truthfulness and honesty.5\nThere should always be a fixed principle with Christian parents\nto be united in the government of their children. There is a fault\nin this respect with some parents\u2014a lack of union. The fault is\nsometimes with the father, but oftener with the mother. The fond\nmother pets and indulges her children. The father\u2019s labor calls him\nfrom home often, and from the society of his children. The mother\u2019s\ninfluence tells. Her example does much toward forming the character\nof the children.6\nChildren Are Confused by Parents at Variance\u2014The family\nfirm must be well organized. Together the father and mother must\nconsider their responsibilities, and with a clear comprehension un-\ndertake their task. There is to be no variance. The father and mother\nshould never in the presence of their children criticize each other\u2019s\nplans and judgment.\nIf the mother is inexperienced in the knowledge of God, she\nshould reason from cause to effect, finding out whether her discipline\nis of a nature to increase the difficulties of the father as he labors for\n248 The Adventist Home\nthe salvation of the children. Am I following the way of the Lord?\nThis should be the all-important question.7\nIf parents do not agree, let them absent themselves from the\npresence of their children until an understanding can be arrived at.8\nToo often the parents are not united in their family government.\nThe father, who is with his children but little, and is ignorant of their\npeculiarities of disposition and temperament, is harsh and severe.\nHe does not control his temper, but corrects in passion. The child\nknows this, and instead of being subdued, the punishment fills him[315]\nwith anger. The mother allows misdemeanors to pass at one time\nfor which she will severely punish at another. The children never\nknow just what to expect, and are tempted to see how far they can\ntransgress with impunity. Thus are sown seeds of evil that spring up\nand bear fruit.9\nIf parents are united in this work of discipline, the child will\nunderstand what is required of him. But if the father, by word or\nlook, shows that he does not approve of the discipline the mother\ngives; if he feels that she is too strict and thinks that he must make\nup for the harshness by petting and indulgence, the child will be\nruined. He will soon learn that he can do as he pleases. Parents who\ncommit this sin against their children are accountable for the ruin of\ntheir souls.10\nThe angels look with intense interest upon every family, to see\nhow the children are treated by parents, guardians, or friends. What\nstrange mismanagement they witness in a family where father and\nmother are at variance! The tones of the voice of father and mother,\ntheir looks, their words\u2014all make it manifest that they are not united\nin the management of their children. The father casts reflections\nupon the mother and leads the children to hold in disrespect the\nmother\u2019s tenderness and affection for the little ones. The mother\nthinks she is compelled to give large affection to the children, to\ngratify and indulge them, because she thinks the father is harsh\nand impatient and she must work to counteract the influence of his\nseverity.11\nMuch Prayer, Sober Reflection Needed\u2014Affection cannot be\nlasting, even in the home circle, unless there is a conformity of the\nwill and disposition to the will of God. All the faculties and passions\nare to be brought into harmony with the attributes of Jesus Christ. If[316]\nUnited Front 249\nthe father and mother in the love and fear of God unite their interests\nto have authority in the home, they will see the necessity of much\nprayer, much sober reflection. And as they seek God, their eyes will\nbe opened to see heavenly messengers present to protect them in\nanswer to the prayer of faith. They will overcome the weaknesses of\ntheir character and go on unto perfection.12\nHearts to Be Bound by the Silken Cord of Love.\u2014Father and\nmother, bind your hearts in closest, happiest union. Do not grow\napart, but bind yourselves more closely to each other; then you are\nprepared to bind your children\u2019s hearts to you by the silken cord of\nlove.13\nKeep sowing the seed for time and eternity. All heaven is watch-\ning the efforts of the Christian parent.14\n1Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 127.\n2The Review and Herald, March 30, 1897.\n3The Review and Herald, March 13, 1894.\n4Pacific Health Journal, April, 1890.\n5Testimonies for the Church 1:156, 157.\n6Testimonies for the Church 1:156.\n7Manuscript 79, 1901.\n8The Review and Herald, March 30, 1897.\n9The Signs of the Times, March 11, 1886.\n10The Review and Herald, June 27, 1899.\n11The Review and Herald, March 13, 1894.\n12Manuscript 36, 1899.\n13The Review and Herald, September 15, 1891.\n14Ibid.\nChapter 54\u2014Religion in the Family[317]\nFamily Religion Defined\u2014Family religion consists in bringing\nup the children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Every\none in the family is to be nourished by the lessons of Christ, and\nthe interest of each soul is to be strictly guarded, in order that Satan\nshall not deceive and allure away from Christ. This is the standard\nevery family should aim to reach, and they should determine not to\nfail or to be discouraged. When parents are diligent and vigilant in\ntheir instruction, and train their children with an eye single to the\nglory of God, they co-operate with God, and God co-operates with\nthem in the saving of the souls of the children for whom Christ has\ndied.1\nReligious instruction means much more than ordinary instruc-\ntion. It means that you are to pray with your children, teaching them\nhow to approach Jesus and tell Him all their wants. It means that\nyou are to show in your life that Jesus is everything to you, and\nthat His love makes you patient, kind, forbearing, and yet firm in\ncommanding your children after you, as did Abraham.2\nJust as you conduct yourself in your home life, you are registered\nin the books of heaven. He who would become a saint in heaven\nmust first become a saint in his own family. If fathers and mothers\nare true Christians in the family, they will be useful members of the\nchurch and be able to conduct affairs in the church and in society\nafter the same manner in which they conduct their family concerns.\nParents, let not your religion be simply a profession, but let it become\na reality.3\nReligion to Be a Part of Home Education\u2014Home religion is[318]\nfearfully neglected. Men and women show much interest in foreign\nmissions. They give liberally to them and thus seek to satisfy their\nconscience, thinking that giving to the cause of God will atone for\ntheir neglect to set a right example in the home. But the home is\ntheir special field, and no excuse is accepted by God for neglecting\nthis field.4\n250\nReligion in the Family 251\nWhere religion is a practical thing in the home, great good is\naccomplished. Religion will lead the parents to do the very work\nGod designed should be done in the home. Children will be brought\nup in the fear and admonition of the Lord.5\nThe reason why the youth of the present age are not more reli-\ngiously inclined is that their education is defective. True love is not\nexercised toward children when they are allowed to indulge passion,\nor when disobedience of your laws is permitted to go unpunished.\nAs the twig is bent, the tree is inclined.6\nIf religion is to influence society, it must first influence the home\ncircle. If children were trained to love and fear God at home, when\nthey go forth into the world, they would be prepared to train their\nown families for God, and thus the principles of truth would become\nimplanted in society and would exert a telling influence in the world.\nReligion should not be divorced from home education.7\nHome Religion Precedes That in the Church \u2014In the home\nthe foundation is laid for the prosperity of the church. The influences\nthat rule in the home life are carried into the church life; therefore\nchurch duties should first begin in the home.8\nWhen we have good home religion, we will have excellent meet- [319]\ning religion. Hold the fort at home. Consecrate your family to God,\nand then speak and act at home as a Christian. Be kind and for-\nbearing and patient at home, knowing that you are teachers. Every\nmother is a teacher, and every mother should be a learner in the\nschool of Christ that she may know how to teach, that she may give\nthe right mold, the right form of character to her children.9\nWhere there is a lack of home religion, a profession of faith is\nvalueless.... Many are deceiving themselves by thinking that the\ncharacter will be transformed at the coming of Christ, but there will\nbe no conversion of heart at His appearing. Our defects of character\nmust here be repented of, and through the grace of Christ we must\novercome them while probation shall last. This is the place for fitting\nup for the family above.10\nHome religion is greatly needed, and our words in the home\nshould be of a right character, or our testimonies in the church will\namount to nothing. Unless you manifest meekness, kindness, and\ncourtesy in your home, your religion will be vain. If there were more\ngenuine home religion, there would be more power in the church.11\n252 The Adventist Home\nTerrible Mistake to Delay Religious Instruction\u2014It is a most\ngrievous thing to let children grow up without the knowledge of\nGod.12\nParents make a most terrible mistake when they neglect the\nwork of giving their children religious training, thinking that they\nwill come out all right in the future and, as they get older, will of\nthemselves be anxious for a religious experience. Cannot you see,\nparents, that if you do not plant the precious seeds of truth, of love,\nof heavenly attributes, in the heart, Satan will sow the field of the\nheart with tares?13\nToo often children are allowed to grow up without religion be-[320]\ncause their parents think they are too young to have Christian duties\nenjoined upon them....\nThe question of the duty of children in regard to religious matters\nis to be decided absolutely and without hesitancy while they are\nmembers of the family.14\nParents stand in the place of God to their children to tell them\nwhat they must do and what they must not do with firmness and\nperfect self-control. Every effort made for them with kindness and\nself-control will cultivate in their characters the elements of firmness\nand decision.... Fathers and mothers are in duty bound to settle this\nquestion early so that the child will no more think of breaking the\nSabbath, neglecting religious worship and family prayer than he\nwould think of stealing. Parents\u2019 own hands must build the barrier.15\nFrom the earliest age a wise education in Christ\u2019s lines is to\nbe begun and carried forward. When the children\u2019s hearts are im-\npressible, they are to be taught concerning eternal realities. Parents\nshould remember that they are living, speaking, and acting in the\npresence of God.16\nParents, what course are you pursuing? Are you acting upon\nthe idea that in religious matters your children should be left free of\nall restraint? Are you leaving them without counsel or admonition\nthrough childhood and youth? Are you leaving them to do as they\nplease? If so, you are neglecting your God-given responsibilities.17\nAdapt Instruction to the Child\u2019s Age \u2014As soon as the little\nones are intelligent to understand, parents should tell them the story\nof Jesus that they may drink in the precious truth concerning the\nBabe of Bethlehem. Impress upon the children\u2019s minds sentiments\nReligion in the Family 253\nof simple piety that are adapted to their years and ability. Bring your [321]\nchildren in prayer to Jesus, for He has made it possible for them to\nlearn religion as they learn to frame the words of the language.18\nWhen very young, children are susceptible to divine influences.\nThe Lord takes these children under His special care; and when they\nare brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, they are a\nhelp and not a hindrance to their parents.19\nParents Jointly Foster Religion in the Home\u2014The father and\nthe mother are responsible for the maintenance of religion in the\nhome.20\nLet not the mother gather to herself so many cares that she cannot\ngive time to the spiritual needs of her family. Let parents seek God\nfor guidance in their work. On their knees before Him they will gain\na true understanding of their great responsibilities, and there they\ncan commit their children to One who will never err in counsel and\ninstruction....\nThe father of the family should not leave to the mother all the\ncare of imparting spiritual instruction. A large work is to be done\nby fathers and mothers, and both should act their individual part in\npreparing their children for the grand review of the judgment.21\nParents, take your children with you into your religious exercises.\nThrow around them the arms of your faith, and consecrate them\nto Christ. Do not allow anything to cause you to throw off your\nresponsibility to train them aright; do not let any worldly interest\ninduce you to leave them behind. Never let your Christian life isolate\nthem from you. Bring them with you to the Lord; educate their minds\nto become familiar with divine truth. Let them associate with those\nthat love God. Bring them to the people of God as children whom [322]\nyou are seeking to help to build characters fit for eternity.22\nReligion in the home\u2014what will it not accomplish? It will do\nthe very work that God designed should be done in every family.\nChildren will be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the\nLord. They will be educated and trained, not to be society devotees,\nbut members of the Lord\u2019s family.23\nChildren Look to Parents for Consistent Life \u2014Everything\nleaves its impress upon the youthful mind. The countenance is\nstudied, the voice has its influence, and the deportment is closely\nimitated by them. Fretful and peevish fathers and mothers are giving\n254 The Adventist Home\ntheir children lessons which at some period in their lives they would\ngive all the world, were it theirs, could they unlearn. Children must\nsee in the lives of their parents that consistency which is in accor-\ndance with their faith. By leading a consistent life and exercising\nself-control, parents may mold the characters of their children.24\nGod Honors a Well-ordered Family \u2014Fathers and mothers\nwho make God first in their households, who teach their children that\nthe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, glorify God before\nangels and before men by presenting to the world a well-ordered,\nwell-disciplined family, a family that love and obey God instead of\nrebelling against Him. Christ is not a stranger in their homes; His\nname is a household name, revered and glorified. Angels delight in\na home where God reigns supreme, and the children are taught to\nreverence religion, the Bible, and their Creator. Such families can\nclaim the promise: \u201cThem that honour Me I will honour.\u201d25\nHow Christ Is Brought Into the Home \u2014When Christ is in[323]\nthe heart, He is brought into the family. The father and mother\nfeel the importance of living in obedience to the Holy Spirit so that\nthe heavenly angels, who minister to those who shall be heirs of\nsalvation, will minister to them as teachers in the home, educating\nand training them for the work of teaching their children. In the\nhome it is possible to have a little church which will honor and\nglorify the Redeemer.26\nMake Religion Attractive\u2014Make the Christian life an attrac-\ntive one. Speak of the country in which the followers of Christ are to\nmake their home. As you do this, God will guide your children into\nall truth, filling them with a desire to fit themselves for the mansions\nwhich Christ has gone to prepare for those that love Him.27\nParents are not to compel their children to have a form of religion,\nbut they are to place eternal principles before them in an attractive\nlight.28\nParents are to make the religion of Christ attractive by their cheer-\nfulness, their Christian courtesy, and their tender, compassionate\nsympathy; but they are to be firm in requiring respect and obedience.\nRight principles must be established in the mind of the child.29\nWe need to present to the youth an inducement for right doing.\nSilver and gold is not sufficient for this. Let us reveal to them the\nlove and mercy and grace of Christ, the preciousness of His word,\nReligion in the Family 255\nand the joys of the overcomer. In efforts of this kind you will do a\nwork that will last throughout eternity.30\nWhy Some Parents Fail\u2014Some parents, although they profess\nto be religious, do not keep before their children the fact that God is\nto be served and obeyed, that convenience, pleasure, or inclination [324]\nshould not interfere with His claims upon them. \u201cThe fear of the\nLord is the beginning of wisdom.\u201d This fact should be woven into\nthe very life and character. The right conception of God through the\nknowledge of Christ, who died that we might be saved, should be\nimpressed upon their minds.31\nYou may think, parents, that you have not time to do all this, but\nyou must take time to do your work in your family, else Satan will\nsupply the deficiency. Cut out everything else from your life that\nprevents this work from being done, and train your children after\nHis order. Neglect anything of a temporal nature, be satisfied to live\neconomically, bind about your wants, but for Christ\u2019s sake do not\nneglect the religious training of yourselves and your children.32\nEvery Member of the Family to Be Dedicated to God \u2014The\ndirections that Moses gave concerning the Passover feast are full of\nsignificance, and have an application to parents and children in this\nage of the world....\nThe father was to act as the priest of the household, and if the\nfather was dead, the eldest son living was to perform this solemn act\nof sprinkling the doorpost with blood. This is a symbol of the work\nto be done in every family. Parents are to gather their children into\nthe home and to present Christ before them as their Passover. The\nfather is to dedicate every inmate of his home to God and to do a\nwork that is represented by the feast of the Passover. It is perilous to\nleave this solemn duty in the hands of others.33\nLet Christian parents resolve that they will be loyal to God, and\nlet them gather their children into their homes with them and strike [325]\nthe doorpost with blood, representing Christ as the only One who\ncan shield and save, that the destroying angel may pass over the\ncherished circle of the household. Let the world see that a more than\nhuman influence is at work in the home. Let parents maintain a vital\nconnection with God, set themselves on Christ\u2019s side, and show by\nHis grace what great good may be accomplished through parental\nagency.34\n256 The Adventist Home\n1Manuscript 24b, 1894.\n2Letter 8a, 1896.\n3Manuscript 89, 1894.\n4The Signs of the Times, August 23, 1899.\n5The Review and Herald, March 13, 1894.\n6Testimonies for the Church 2:701.\n7The Signs of the Times, April 8, 1886.\n8The Signs of the Times, September 1, 1898.\n9Manuscript 13, 1888.\n10The Signs of the Times, November 14, 1892.\n11Messages to Young People, 327.\n12The Signs of the Times, April 23, 1894.\n13The Signs of the Times, August 6, 1912.\n14The Review and Herald, April 13, 1897.\n15Manuscript 119, 1899.\n16The Review and Herald, March 13, 1894.\n17Ibid.\n18The Signs of the Times, August 27, 1912.\n19The Signs of the Times, April 23, 1912.\n20Manuscript 47, 1908.\n21Letter 90, 1911.\n22The Signs of the Times, April 23, 1912.\n23Manuscript 7, 1899.\n24Testimonies for the Church 4:621.\n25Ibid., 5:424.\n26Manuscript 102, 1901.\n27The Review and Herald, January 29, 1901.\n28The Signs of the Times, August 27, 1912.\n29The Review and Herald, June 27, 1899.\n30Manuscript 93, 1909.\n31The Review and Herald, June 24, 1890.\n32Manuscript 12, 1898.\n33The Review and Herald, May 21, 1895.\n34The Review and Herald, February 19, 1895.\nChapter 55\u2014Moral Standards [326]\nSatan Seeks to Pervert the Marriage Institution\u2014It was Sa-\ntan\u2019s studied effort [in the antediluvian age] to pervert the marriage\ninstitution, to weaken its obligations and lessen its sacredness; for\nin no surer way could he deface the image of God in man and open\nthe door to misery and vice.1\nSatan well knows the material with which he has to deal in the\nhuman heart. He knows\u2014for he has studied with fiendish intensity\nfor thousands of years\u2014the points most easily assailed in every\ncharacter; and through successive generations he has wrought to\noverthrow the strongest men, princes in Israel, by the same temp-\ntations that were so successful at Baal-peor. All along through the\nages there are strewn wrecks of character that have been stranded\nupon the rocks of sensual indulgence.2\nTragedy in Israel\u2014The crime that brought the judgments of\nGod upon Israel was that of licentiousness. The forwardness of\nwomen to entrap souls did not end at Baal-peor. Notwithstanding\nthe punishment that followed the sinners in Israel, the same crime\nwas repeated many times. Satan was most active in seeking to make\nIsrael\u2019s overthrow complete.3\nThe licentious practice of the Hebrews accomplished for them\nthat which all the warfare of nations and the enchantments of Bal-\naam could not do. They became separated from their God. Their\ncovering and protection were removed from them. God turned to\nbe their enemy. So many of the princes and people were guilty of\nlicentiousness that it became a national sin, for God was wroth with [327]\nthe whole congregation.4\nThe History to Be Repeated \u2014Near the close of this earth\u2019s\nhistory Satan will work with all his powers in the same manner and\nwith the same temptations wherewith he tempted ancient Israel just\nbefore their entering the Land of Promise. He will lay snares for\nthose who claim to keep the commandments of God, and who are\nalmost on the borders of the heavenly Canaan. He will use his powers\n257\n258 The Adventist Home\nto their utmost in order to entrap souls and to take God\u2019s professed\npeople upon their weakest points. Those who have not brought the\nlower passions into subjection to the higher powers of their being,\nthose who have allowed their minds to flow in a channel of carnal\nindulgence of the baser passions, Satan is determined to destroy\nwith his temptations\u2014to pollute their souls with licentiousness.\nHe is not aiming especially at the lower and less important marks,\nbut he makes use of his snares through those whom he can enlist\nas his agents to allure or attract men to take liberties which are\ncondemned in the law of God. And men in responsible positions,\nteaching the claims of God\u2019s law, whose mouths are filled with\narguments in vindication of His law, against which Satan has made\nsuch a raid\u2014over such he sets his hellish powers and his agencies at\nwork and overthrows them upon the weak points in their character,\nknowing that he who offends on one point is guilty of all, thus\nobtaining complete mastery over the entire man. Mind, soul, body,\nand conscience are involved in the ruin. If he be a messenger of\nrighteousness and has had great light, or if the Lord has used him\nas His special worker in the cause of truth, then how great is the\ntriumph of Satan! How he exults! How God is dishonored!5\nPrevalence of Immorality Today \u2014A terrible picture of the[328]\ncondition of the world has been presented before me. Immorality\nabounds everywhere. Licentiousness is the special sin of this age.\nNever did vice lift its deformed head with such boldness as now.\nThe people seem to be benumbed, and the lovers of virtue and\ntrue goodness are nearly discouraged by its boldness, strength, and\nprevalence. The iniquity which abounds is not merely confined to\nthe unbeliever and the scoffer. Would that this were the case, but\nit is not. Many men and women who profess the religion of Christ\nare guilty. Even some who profess to be looking for His appearing\nare no more prepared for that event than Satan himself. They are\nnot cleansing themselves from all pollution. They have so long\nserved their lust that it is natural for their thoughts to be impure\nand their imaginations corrupt. It is as impossible to cause their\nminds to dwell upon pure and holy things as it would be to turn the\ncourse of Niagara and send its waters pouring up the falls.... Every\nChristian will have to learn to restrain his passions and be controlled\nMoral Standards 259\nby principle. Unless he does this, he is unworthy of the Christian\nname.6\nLovesick sentimentalism prevails. Married men receive atten-\ntion from married or unmarried women; women also appear to be\ncharmed and lose reason and spiritual discernment and good com-\nmon sense; they do the very things that the word of God condemns,\nthe very things that the testimonies of the Spirit of God condemn.\nWarnings and reproofs are before them in clear lines, yet they go\nover the same path that others have traveled before them. It is like\nan infatuating game at which they are playing. Satan leads them on\nto ruin themselves, to imperil the cause of God, to crucify the Son\nof God afresh and put Him to an open shame.7\nIgnorance, pleasure loving, and sinful habits, corrupting soul, [329]\nbody, and spirit, make the world full of moral leprosy; a deadly\nmoral malaria is destroying thousands and tens of thousands. What\nshall be done to save our youth? We can do little, but God lives and\nreigns, and He can do much.8\nGod\u2019s People to Stand in Contrast to the World\u2014The liber-\nties taken in this age of corruption should be no criterion for Christ\u2019s\nfollowers. These fashionable exhibitions of familiarity should not\nexist among Christians fitting for immortality. If lasciviousness, pol-\nlution, adultery, crime, and murder are the order of the day among\nthose who know not the truth, and who refuse to be controlled by the\nprinciples of God\u2019s word, how important that the class professing\nto be followers of Christ, closely allied to God and angels, should\nshow them a better and nobler way! How important that by their\nchastity and virtue they stand in marked contrast to that class who\nare controlled by brute passions!9\nIncreasing Perils and Dangers\u2014In this degenerate age many\nwill be found who are so blinded to the sinfulness of sin that they\nchoose a licentious life because it suits the natural and perverse\ninclination of the heart. Instead of facing the mirror of the law of\nGod and bringing their hearts and characters up to God\u2019s standard,\nthey allow Satan\u2019s agents to erect his standard in their hearts. Corrupt\nmen think it easier to misinterpret the Scriptures to sustain them in\ntheir iniquity than to yield up their corruption and sin and be pure in\nheart and life.\n260 The Adventist Home\nThere are more men of this stamp than many have imagined, and\nthey will multiply as we draw near the end of time.10\nWhen Satan\u2019s bewitching power controls a person, God is forgot-[330]\nten, and man who is filled with corrupt purposes is extolled. Secret\nlicentiousness is practiced by these deceived souls as a virtue. This\nis a species of witchcraft.... There is always a bewitching power in\nheresies and in licentiousness. The mind is so deluded that it cannot\nreason intelligently, and an illusion is continually leading it from\npurity. The spiritual eyesight becomes blurred, and persons of hith-\nerto untainted morals become confused under the delusive sophistry\nof those agents of Satan who profess to be messengers of light. It\nis this delusion which gives these agents power. Should they come\nout boldly and make their advances openly, they would be repulsed\nwithout a moment\u2019s hesitation; but they work first to gain sympathy\nand secure confidence in themselves as holy, self-sacrificing men of\nGod. As his special messengers they then begin their artful work\nof drawing away souls from the path of rectitude by attempting to\nmake void the law of God.11\nBoth Men and Women Must Keep Their Place and Live\nAbove Reproach\u2014The mind of a man or woman does not come\ndown in a moment from purity and holiness to depravity, corruption,\nand crime. It takes time to transform the human to the divine, or\nto degrade those formed in the image of God to the brutal or the\nsatanic. By beholding we become changed. Though formed in the\nimage of his Maker, man can so educate his mind that sin which he\nonce loathed will become pleasant to him. As he ceases to watch\nand pray, he ceases to guard the citadel, the heart, and engages in\nsin and crime. The mind is debased, and it is impossible to elevate it\nfrom corruption while it is being educated to enslave the moral and\nintellectual powers and bring them in subjection to grosser passions.[331]\nConstant war against the carnal mind must be maintained; and we\nmust be aided by the refining influence of the grace of God, which\nwill attract the mind upward and habituate it to meditate upon pure\nand holy things.12\nThere is no safety for any man, young or old, unless he feels\nthe necessity of seeking God for counsel at every step. Those only\nwho maintain close communion with God will learn to place His\nestimate upon men, to reverence the pure, the good, the humble,\nMoral Standards 261\nand the meek. The heart must be garrisoned as was that of Joseph.\nThen temptations to depart from integrity will be met with decision:\n\u201cHow then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?\u201d\nThe strongest temptation is no excuse for sin. No matter how severe\nthe pressure brought to bear upon you, sin is your own act. The seat\nof the difficulty is the unrenewed heart.13\nIn view of the dangers of this time, shall not we, as God\u2019s com-\nmandment-keeping people, put away from among us all sin, all\niniquity, all perverseness? Shall not the women professing the truth\nkeep strict guard over themselves, lest the least encouragement be\ngiven to unwarrantable familiarity? They may close many a door of\ntemptation if they will observe at all times strict reserve and propriety\nof deportment.14\nWomen Must Uphold High Standard of Conduct \u2014I write\nwith a distressed heart that the women in this age, both married\nand unmarried, too frequently do not maintain the reserve that is\nnecessary. They act like coquettes. They encourage the attentions\nof single and married men, and those who are weak in moral power\nwill be ensnared. These things, if allowed, deaden the moral senses\nand blind the mind so that crime does not appear sinful. Thoughts [332]\nare awakened that would not have been if woman had kept her place\nin all modesty and sobriety. She may have had no unlawful purpose\nor motive herself, but she has given encouragement to men who\nare tempted, and who need all the help they can get from those\nassociated with them. By being circumspect, reserved, taking no\nliberties, receiving no unwarrantable attentions, but preserving a high\nmoral tone and becoming dignity, much evil might be avoided.15\nI have long been designing to speak to my sisters and tell them\nthat, from what the Lord has been pleased to show me from time\nto time, there is a great fault among them. They are not careful to\nabstain from all appearance of evil. They are not all circumspect in\ntheir deportment, as becometh women professing godliness. Their\nwords are not as select and well chosen as those of women who have\nreceived the grace of God should be. They are too familiar with their\nbrethren. They linger around them, incline toward them, and seem\nto choose their society. They are highly gratified with their attention.\nFrom the light which the Lord has given me, our sisters should\npursue a very different course. They should be more reserved, mani-\n262 The Adventist Home\nfest less boldness, and encourage in themselves \u201cshamefacedness\nand sobriety.\u201d Both brethren and sisters indulge in too much jovial\ntalk when in each other\u2019s society. Women professing godliness in-\ndulge in much jesting, joking, and laughing. This is unbecoming\nand grieves the Spirit of God. These exhibitions reveal a lack of true\nChristian refinement. They do not strengthen the soul in God, but\nbring great darkness; they drive away the pure, refined, heavenly\nangels and bring those who engage in these wrongs down to a low\nlevel.16\nWomen are too often tempters. On one pretense or another they[333]\nengage the attention of men, married or unmarried, and lead them\non till they transgress the law of God, till their usefulness is ruined,\nand their souls are in jeopardy.... If women would only elevate their\nlives and become workers with Christ, there would be less danger\nthrough their influence; but with their present feelings of unconcern\nin regard to home responsibilities and in regard to the claims that\nGod has upon them, their influence is often strong in the wrong\ndirection, their powers are dwarfed, and their work does not bear the\ndivine impress.17\nThere are so many forward misses and bold, forward women\nwho have a faculty of insinuating themselves into notice, putting\nthemselves in the company of young men, courting the attentions,\ninviting flirtations from married or unmarried men, that unless your\nface is set Christward, firm as steel, you will be drawn into Satan\u2019s\nnet.18\nAs Christ\u2019s ambassador, I entreat you who profess present truth\nto promptly resent any approach to impurity and forsake the society\nof those who breathe an impure suggestion. Loathe these defiling\nsins with the most intense hatred. Flee from those who would, even\nin conversation, let the mind run in such a channel, \u201cfor out of the\nabundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\u201d ...\nYou should not for one moment give place to an impure, covert\nsuggestion, for even this will stain the soul, as impure water defiles\nthe channel through which it passes.19\nA woman who will allow an unchaste word or hint to be uttered\nin her presence is not as God would have her; one that will permit\nany undue familiarity or impure suggestion does not preserve her\ngodlike womanhood.20\nMoral Standards 263\nProtected by a Sacred Circle of Purity \u2014Our sisters should [334]\nencourage true meekness; they should not be forward, talkative,\nand bold, but modest and unassuming, slow to speak. They may\ncherish courteousness. To be kind, tender, pitiful, forgiving, and\nhumble would be becoming and well pleasing to God. If they occupy\nthis position, they will not be burdened with undue attention from\ngentlemen in the church or out. All will feel that there is a sacred\ncircle of purity around these God-fearing women which shields them\nfrom any unwarrantable liberties.\nWith some women professing godliness, there is a careless,\ncoarse freedom of manner which leads to wrong and evil. But those\ngodly women whose minds and hearts are occupied in meditating\nupon themes which strengthen purity of life, and which elevate\nthe soul to commune with God, will not be easily led astray from\nthe path of rectitude and virtue. Such will be fortified against the\nsophistry of Satan; they will be prepared to withstand his seductive\narts.21\nI appeal to you, as followers of Christ making an exalted profes-\nsion, to cherish the precious, priceless gem of modesty. This will\nguard virtue.22\nControl the Thoughts\u2014You should control your thoughts. This\nwill not be an easy task; you cannot accomplish it without close and\neven severe effort. Yet God requires this of you; it is a duty resting\nupon every accountable being. You are responsible to God for your\nthoughts. If you indulge in vain imaginations, permitting your mind\nto dwell upon impure subjects, you are, in a degree, as guilty before\nGod as if your thoughts were carried into action. All that prevents\nthe action is the lack of opportunity. Day and night dreaming and\ncastle-building are bad and exceedingly dangerous habits. When [335]\nonce established, it is next to impossible to break up such habits and\ndirect the thoughts to pure, holy, elevated themes.23\nBeware of Flattery\u2014I am pained when I see men praised, flat-\ntered, and petted. God has revealed to me the fact that some who\nreceive these attentions are unworthy to take His name upon their\nlips; yet they are exalted to heaven in the estimation of finite beings,\nwho read only from outward appearance. My sisters, never pet and\nflatter poor, fallible, erring men, either young or old, married or\nunmarried. You know not their weaknesses, and you know not but\n264 The Adventist Home\nthat these very attentions and this profuse praise may prove their\nruin. I am alarmed at the shortsightedness, the want of wisdom, that\nmany manifest in this respect.\nMen who are doing God\u2019s work, and who have Christ abiding\nin their hearts, will not lower the standard of morality, but will ever\nseek to elevate it. They will not find pleasure in the flattery of women\nor in being petted by them. Let men, both single and married, say:\n\u201cHands off! I will never give the least occasion that my good should\nbe evil spoken of. My good name is capital of far more value to me\nthan gold or silver. Let me preserve it untarnished. If men assail that\nname, it shall not be because I have given them occasion to do so,\nbut for the same reason that they spoke evil of Christ\u2014because they\nhated the purity and holiness of His character, for it was a constant\nrebuke to them.\u201d24\nIf the Minister Tempts\u2014The slightest insinuations, from what-\never source they may come, inviting you to indulge in sin or to\nallow the least unwarrantable liberty with your persons should be[336]\nresented as the worst of insults to your dignified womanhood. The\nkiss upon your cheek, at an improper time and place, should lead\nyou to repel the emissary of Satan with disgust. If it is from one\nin high places, who is dealing in sacred things, the sin is of tenfold\ngreater magnitude and should lead a God-fearing woman or youth to\nrecoil with horror, not only from the sin he would have you commit,\nbut from the hypocrisy and villainy of one whom the people respect\nand honor as God\u2019s servant.25\nIf a minister of the gospel does not control his baser passions,\nif he fails to follow the example of the apostle and so dishonors his\nprofession and faith as to even name the indulgence of sin, our sisters\nwho profess godliness should not for an instant flatter themselves\nthat sin or crime loses its sinfulness in the least because their minister\ndares to engage in it. The fact that men who are in responsible places\nshow themselves to be familiar with sin should not lessen the guilt\nand enormity of the sin in the minds of any. Sin should appear just as\nsinful, just as abhorrent, as it had been heretofore regarded; and the\nminds of the pure and elevated should abhor and shun the one who\nindulges in sin as they would flee from a serpent whose sting was\ndeadly. If the sisters were elevated and possessed purity of heart,\nMoral Standards 265\nany corrupt advances, even from their minister, would be repulsed\nwith such positiveness as would never need a repetition.26\nBe Faithful to Marriage Vows\u2014How careful should the hus-\nband and father be to maintain his loyalty to his marriage vows! How\ncircumspect should be his character, lest he shall encourage thoughts\nin young girls, or even in married women, that are not in accordance\nwith the high, holy standard\u2014the commandments of God! Those [337]\ncommandments Christ shows to be exceedingly broad, reaching\neven the thoughts, intents, and purposes of the heart. Here is where\nmany are delinquent. Their heart imaginings are not of the pure,\nholy character which God requires; and however high their calling,\nhowever talented they may be, God will mark iniquity against them\nand will count them as far more guilty and deserving of His wrath\nthan those who have less talent, less light, less influence.27\nTo married men I am instructed to say, It is to your wives, the\nmothers of your children, that your respect and affection are due.\nYour attentions are to be given to them, and your thoughts are to\ndwell upon plans for their happiness.28\nI have been shown families where the husband and father has\nnot preserved that reserve, that dignified, godlike manhood which\nis befitting a follower of Christ. He has failed to perform the kind,\ntender, courteous acts due to his wife, whom he has promised before\nGod and angels to love, respect, and honor while they both shall\nlive. The girl employed to do the work has been free and somewhat\nforward to dress his hair and to be affectionately attentive, and he\nis pleased, foolishly pleased. In his love and attention to his wife\nhe is not as demonstrative as he once was. Be sure that Satan is at\nwork here. Respect your hired help, treat them kindly, considerately,\nbut go no farther. Let your deportment be such that there will be no\nadvances to familiarity from them.29\nMaintain Family Privacy\u2014Oh, how many lives are made bitter\nby the breaking down of the walls which inclose the privacies of\nevery family, and which are calculated to preserve its purity and\nsanctity! A third person is taken into the confidence of the wife, and\nher private family matters are laid open before the special friend. [338]\nThis is the device of Satan to estrange the hearts of the husband and\nwife. Oh, that this would cease! What a world of trouble would be\nsaved! Lock within your own hearts the knowledge of each other\u2019s\n266 The Adventist Home\nfaults. Tell your troubles alone to God. He can give you right counsel\nand sure consolation which will be pure, having no bitterness in it.30\nWhen a woman relates her family troubles or complains of her\nhusband to another man, she violates her marriage vows; she dishon-\nors her husband and breaks down the wall erected to preserve the\nsanctity of the marriage relation; she throws wide open the door and\ninvites Satan to enter with his insidious temptations. This is just as\nSatan would have it. If a woman comes to a Christian brother with\na tale of her woes, her disappointments and trials, he should ever\nadvise her, if she must confide her troubles to someone, to select\nsisters for her confidants, and then there will be no appearance of\nevil whereby the cause of God may suffer reproach.31\nHow to Be Kept From Straying \u2014I speak to our people. If\nyou draw close to Jesus and seek to adorn your profession by a\nwell-ordered life and godly conversation, your feet will be kept from\nstraying into forbidden paths. If you will only watch, continually\nwatch unto prayer, if you will do everything as if you were in the\nimmediate presence of God, you will be saved from yielding to\ntemptation and may hope to be kept pure, spotless, and undefiled\ntill the last. If you hold the beginning of your confidence firm unto\nthe end, your ways will be established in God; and what grace has\nbegun, glory will crown in the kingdom of our God. The fruits of\nthe Spirit are love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,\nfaith, meekness, temperance; against such there is no law. If Christ[339]\nbe within us, we shall crucify the flesh with the affections and lusts.32\n1Patriarchs and Prophets, 338.\n2Ibid., 457.\n3The Review and Herald, May 17, 1887.\n4Ibid.\n5Ibid.\n6Testimonies for the Church 2:346, 347.\n7Manuscript 19a, 1890.\n8Manuscript 8, 1894.\n9Testimonies for the Church 2:459.\n10Testimonies for the Church 5:141.\n11Testimonies for the Church 5:142, 143.\n12Testimonies for the Church 2:478, 479.\n13Manuscript 19a, 1890.\n14Testimonies for the Church 5:601, 602.\nMoral Standards 267\n15Manuscript 4a, 1885.\n16Testimonies for the Church 2:455.\n17Testimonies for the Church 5:596, 597.\n18Medical Ministry, 145.\n19Testimonies for the Church 5:146, 147.\n20Manuscript 4a, 1885.\n21Testimonies for the Church 2:456.\n22Testimonies for the Church 2:458.\n23Testimonies for the Church 2:561.\n24Testimonies for the Church 5:595.\n25Testimonies for the Church 2:458, 459.\n26Testimonies for the Church 2:457.\n27Testimonies for the Church 5:594, 595.\n28Letter 231, 1903.\n29Testimonies for the Church 2:461.\n30Testimonies for the Church 2:462.\n31Testimonies for the Church 2:306.\n32Testimonies for the Church 5:148.\nChapter 56\u2014Divorce[340]\nMarriage Is a Contract for Life \u2014In the youthful mind mar-\nriage is clothed with romance, and it is difficult to divest it of this\nfeature, with which imagination covers it, and to impress the mind\nwith a sense of the weighty responsibilities involved in the marriage\nvow. This vow links the destinies of the two individuals with bonds\nwhich naught but the hand of death should sever.1\nEvery marriage engagement should be carefully considered, for\nmarriage is a step taken for life. Both the man and the woman should\ncarefully consider whether they can cleave to each other through the\nvicissitudes of life as long as they both shall live.2\nJesus Corrected Misconceptions of Marriage \u2014Among the\nJews a man was permitted to put away his wife for the most trivial\noffenses, and the woman was then at liberty to marry again. This\npractice led to great wretchedness and sin. In the Sermon on the\nMount Jesus declared plainly that there could be no dissolution of the\nmarriage tie except for unfaithfulness to the marriage vow. \u201cEvery\none,\u201d He said, \u201cthat putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of\nfornication, maketh her an adulteress: and whosoever shall marry\nher when she is put away committeth adultery.\u201d\nWhen the Pharisees afterward questioned Him concerning the\nlawfulness of divorce, Jesus pointed His hearers back to the marriage\ninstitution as ordained at creation. \u201cBecause of the hardness of your\nhearts,\u201d He said, Moses \u201csuffered you to put away your wives: but\nfrom the beginning it was not so.\u201d He referred them to the blessed[341]\ndays of Eden when God pronounced all things \u201cvery good.\u201d Then\nmarriage and the Sabbath had their origin, twin institutions for the\nglory of God in the benefit of humanity. Then, as the Creator joined\nthe hands of the holy pair in wedlock, saying, A man shall \u201cleave his\nfather and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall\nbe one,\u201d He enunciated the law of marriage for all the children of\nAdam to the close of time. That which the eternal Father Himself had\n268\nDivorce 269\npronounced good was the law of highest blessing and development\nfor man.3\nJesus came to our world to rectify mistakes and to restore the\nmoral image of God in man. Wrong sentiments in regard to marriage\nhad found a place in the minds of the teachers of Israel. They were\nmaking of none effect the sacred institution of marriage. Man was\nbecoming so hardhearted that he would for the most trivial excuse\nseparate from his wife, or, if he chose, he would separate her from\nthe children and send her away. This was considered a great disgrace\nand was often accompanied by the most acute suffering on the part\nof the discarded one.\nChrist came to correct these evils, and His first miracle was\nwrought on the occasion of the marriage. Thus He announced to\nthe world that marriage when kept pure and undefiled is a sacred\ninstitution.4\nCounsel to One Contemplating Divorce \u2014Your ideas in re-\ngard to the marriage relation have been erroneous. Nothing but the\nviolation of the marriage bed can either break or annul the marriage\nvow. We are living in perilous times, when there is no assurance in\nanything save in firm, unwavering faith in Jesus Christ. There is no\nheart that may not be estranged from God through the devices of\nSatan, if one does not watch unto prayer.\nYour health would have been in a far better condition had your [342]\nmind been at peace and rest; but it became confused and unbalanced,\nand you reasoned incorrectly in regard to the matter of divorce. Your\nviews cannot be sustained on the ground from which you reason.\nMen are not at liberty to make a standard of law for themselves, to\navoid God\u2019s law and please their own inclination. They must come\nto God\u2019s great moral standard of righteousness....\nGod gave only one cause why a wife should leave her husband,\nor the husband leave his wife, which was adultery. Let this ground\nbe prayerfully considered.5\nAdvice to a Separated Couple \u2014My brother, my sister, for\nsome time you have not been living together. You should not have\npursued this course and would not have done so if both of you had\nbeen cultivating the patience, kindness, and forbearance that should\never exist between husband and wife. Neither of you should set\nup your own will and try to carry out your individual ideas and\n270 The Adventist Home\nplans whatever the consequences may be. Neither of you should\nbe determined to do as you please. Let the softening, subduing\ninfluence of the Spirit of God work upon your hearts and fit you for\nthe work of training your children.... Appeal to your heavenly Father\nto keep you from yielding to the temptation to speak in an impatient,\nharsh, willful manner to each other, the husband to the wife, and the\nwife to the husband. Both of you have imperfect characters. Because\nyou have not been under God\u2019s control, your conduct toward each\nother has been unwise.\nI beseech you to bring yourselves under God\u2019s control. When\ntempted to speak provokingly, refrain from saying anything. You\nwill be tempted on this point because you have never overcome[343]\nthis objectionable trait of character. But every wrong habit must\nbe overcome. Make a complete surrender to God. Fall on the\nRock, Christ Jesus, and be broken. As husband and wife, discipline\nyourselves. Go to Christ for help. He will willingly supply you with\nHis divine sympathy, His free grace....\nRepent before God for your past course. Come to an understand-\ning, and reunite as husband and wife. Put away the disagreeable,\nunhappy experience of your past life. Take courage in the Lord.\nClose the windows of the soul earthward, and open them heaven-\nward. If your voices are uplifted in prayer to heaven for light, the\nLord Jesus, who is light and life, peace and joy, will hear your cry.\nHe, the Sun of Righteousness, will shine into the chambers of your\nmind, lighting up the soul temple. If you welcome the sunshine of\nHis presence into your home, you will not utter words of a nature to\ncause feelings of unhappiness.6\nTo a Hopelessly Mistreated Wife\u2014I have received your letter,\nand in reply to it I would say, I cannot advise you to return to D\nunless you see decided changes in him. The Lord is not pleased with\nthe ideas he has had in the past of what is due to a wife.... If [he]\nholds to his former views, the future would be not better for you\nthan the past has been. He does not know how to treat a wife.\nI feel very sad about this matter. I feel indeed sorry for D, but I\ncannot advise you to go to him against your judgment. I speak to\nyou as candidly as I spoke to him; it would be perilous for you to\nagain place yourself under his dictation. I had hoped that he would\nchange....\nDivorce 271\nThe Lord understands all about your experiences.... Be of good\ncourage in the Lord; He will not leave you nor forsake you. My [344]\nheart goes out in tenderest sympathy for you.7\nTo a Deserted Husband\u2014\u201cShoulder Your Cross.\u201d\u2014I cannot\nsee what more can be done in this case, and I think that the only thing\nthat you can do is to give up your wife. If she is thus determined\nnot to live with you, both she and you would be most miserable to\nattempt it. And as she has fully and determinedly set her stakes, you\ncan only shoulder your cross and show yourself a man.8\nStill Married in God\u2019s Sight, Although Divorced\u2014A woman\nmay be legally divorced from her husband by the laws of the land and\nyet not divorced in the sight of God and according to the higher law.\nThere is only one sin, which is adultery, which can place the husband\nor wife in a position where they can be free from the marriage vow in\nthe sight of God. Although the laws of the land may grant a divorce,\nyet they are husband and wife still in the Bible light, according to\nthe laws of God.\nI saw that Sister _____, as yet, has no right to marry another\nman; but if she, or any other woman, should obtain a divorce legally\non the ground that her husband was guilty of adultery, then she is\nfree to be married to whom she chooses.9\nSeparation From an Unbelieving Companion\u2014If the wife is\nan unbeliever and an opposer, the husband cannot, in view of the law\nof God, put her away on this ground alone. In order to be in harmony\nwith the law of Jehovah, he must abide with her unless she chooses\nof herself to depart. He may suffer opposition and be oppressed and\nannoyed in many ways; he will find his comfort and his strength and\nsupport from God, who is able to give grace for every emergency. [345]\nHe should be a man of pure mind, of truly decided, firm principles,\nand God will give him wisdom in regard to the course which he\nshould pursue. Impulse will not control his reason, but reason will\nhold the lines of control in her firm hand, that lust shall be held under\nbit and bridle.10\nA Wife Urged to Change Disposition, Not the Marriage Sta-\ntus\u2014I have received a letter from your husband. I would say that\nthere is only one thing for which a husband may lawfully separate\nfrom his wife or a wife from her husband, and that is adultery.\n272 The Adventist Home\nIf your dispositions are not congenial, would it not be for the\nglory of God for you to change these dispositions?\nA husband and wife should cultivate respect and affection for\neach other. They should guard the spirit, the words, and the actions\nso that nothing will be said or done to irritate or annoy. Each is to\nhave a care for the other, doing all in their power to strengthen their\nmutual affection.\nI tell you both to seek the Lord. In love and kindness do your\nduty one to the other. The husband should cultivate industrious\nhabits, doing his best to support his family. This will lead his wife\nto have respect for him....\nMy sister, you cannot please God by maintaining your present\nattitude. Forgive your husband. He is your husband, and you will be\nblessed in striving to be a dutiful, affectionate wife. Let the law of\nkindness be on your lips. You can and must change your attitude.11\nYou must both study how you can assimilate, instead of differing,\nwith one another.... The use of mild, gentle methods will make a\nsurprising difference in your lives.12\nAdultery, Divorce, and Church Membership \u2014In regard to[346]\nthe case of the injured sister, A.G., we would say in reply to the\nquestions of\u2014\u2014that it is a feature in the cases of most who have\nbeen overtaken in sin, as her husband has, that they have no real\nsense of their villainy. Some, however, do and are restored to the\nchurch, but not till they have merited the confidence of the people of\nGod by unqualified confessions and a period of sincere repentance.\nThis case presents difficulties not found in some, and we would add\nonly the following:\n1. In cases of the violation of the seventh commandment where\nthe guilty party does not manifest true repentance, if the injured\nparty can obtain a divorce without making their own cases and that\nof their children, if they have them, worse by so doing, they should\nbe free.\n2. If they would be liable to place themselves and their children\nin worse condition by a divorce, we know of no scripture that would\nmake the innocent party guilty by remaining.\n3. Time and labor and prayer and patience and faith and a godly\nlife might work a reform. To live with one who has broken the\nmarriage vows and is covered all over with the disgrace and shame\nDivorce 273\nof guilty love, and realizes it not, is an eating canker to the soul;\nand yet a divorce is a lifelong, heartfelt sore. God pity the innocent\nparty! Marriage should be considered well before contracted.\n4. Why! oh, why! will men and women who might be re-\nspectable and good and reach heaven at last sell themselves to the\ndevil so cheap, wound their bosom friends, disgrace their families,\nbring a reproach upon the cause, and go to hell at last? God have [347]\nmercy! Why will not those who are overtaken in crime manifest\nrepentance proportionate to the enormity of their crime and fly to\nChrist for mercy and heal, as far as possible, the wounds they have\nmade?13\n5. But, if they will not do as they should, and if the innocent have\nforfeited the legal right to a divorce, by living with the guilty after\nhis guilt is known, we do not see that sin rests upon the innocent\nin remaining, and her moral right in departing seems questionable,\nif her health and life be not greatly endangered in so remaining.\n[Note: This is one of the very few statements to be issued jointly\nby James and Ellen White. Inasmuch as it was signed by both, it is\nevident that the views expressed had full sanction of Mrs. White.\nIt should be noted that the restoration of church membership re-\nferred to in the introductory paragraph of the section is not against\na background of divorce, but of adultery. The paragraph makes\nno reference whatsoever to divorce. The references to divorce and\nchurch membership in the succeeding paragraphs relate, not to the\noffending husband, but to the offended wife and her church mem-\nbership should she decide to divorce or should she decide to remain\nwith her husband.\u2014Compilers.]\n1Testimonies for the Church 4:507.\n2Letter 17, 1896.\n3Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, 99, 100.\n4Manuscript 16, 1899.\n5Letter 8, 1888.\n6Letter 47, 1902.\n7Letter 148, 1907.\n8Letter 40, 1888.\n9Manuscript 2, 1863.\n10Letter 8, 1888.\n11Letter 168, 1901.\n12Letter 157, 1903.\n274 The Adventist Home\n13The Review and Herald, March 24, 1868.\nChapter 57\u2014Attitude Toward an Unbelieving [348]\nCompanion\n[Note: This chapter is largely communications to distressed\nbelievers seeking counsel.\u2014Compilers.]\nShould a Christian Wife Leave an Unbelieving Husband?\u2014\nLetters have come to me from mothers, relating their trials at home\nand asking my counsel. One of these cases will serve to represent\nmany. The husband and father is not a believer, and everything\nis made hard for the mother in the training of her children. The\nhusband is a profane man, vulgar and abusive in his language to her,\nand he teaches the children to disregard her authority. When she is\ntrying to pray with them, he will come in and make all the noise\nhe can and break out into cursing God and heaping vile epithets\nupon the Bible. She is so discouraged that life is a burden to her.\nWhat good can she do? What benefit is it to her children for her to\nremain at home? She has felt an earnest desire to do some work in\nthe Lord\u2019s vineyard and has thought that it might be best to leave\nher family rather than to remain while the husband and father is\nconstantly teaching the children to disrespect and disobey her.\nIn such cases my advice would be, Mothers, whatever trials\nyou may be called to endure through poverty, through wounds and\nbruises of the soul, from the harsh, overbearing assumption of the\nhusband and father, do not leave your children; do not give them up\nto the influence of a godless father. Your work is to counteract the\nwork of the father, who is apparently under the control of Satan.1\nGive a Living Example of Self-control \u2014You have trials, I [349]\nknow, but there is such a thing as showing a spirit of driving rather\nthan of drawing. Your husband needs each day to see a living\nexample of patience and self-control. Make every effort to please\nhim, and yet do not yield up one principle of the truth....\nChrist requires the whole being in His service\u2014heart, soul,\nmind, and strength. As you give Him what He asks of you, you will\nrepresent Him in character. Let your husband see the Holy Spirit\n275\n276 The Adventist Home\nworking in you. Be careful and considerate, patient and forbearing.\nDo not urge the truth upon him. Do your duty as a wife should,\nand then see if his heart is not touched. Your affections must not be\nweaned from your husband. Please him in every way possible. Let\nnot your religious faith draw you apart. Conscientiously obey God,\nand please your husband wherever you can....\nLet all see that you love Jesus and trust in Him. Give your\nhusband and your believing and unbelieving friends evidence that\nyou desire them to see the beauty of truth. But do not show that\npainful, worrying anxiety which often spoils a good work....\nNever let a word of reproach or faultfinding fall upon the ears\nof your husband. You sometimes pass through strait places, but do\nnot talk of these trials. Silence is eloquence. Hasty speech will\nonly increase your unhappiness. Be cheerful and happy. Bring all\nthe sunshine possible into your home, and shut out the shadows.\nLet the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness shine into the\nchambers of your soul temple. Then the fragrance of the Christian\nlife will be brought into your family. There will be no dwelling upon\ndisagreeable things, which many times have no truth in them.2\nA Burdened Wife Counseled to Keep Cheerful \u2014You now[350]\nhave a double responsibility because your husband has turned his\nface away from Jesus....\nI know it must be a great grief for you to stand alone, as far as\nthe doing of the word is concerned. But how knowest thou, O wife,\nbut that your consistent life of faith and obedience may win back\nyour husband to the truth? Let the dear children be brought to Jesus.\nIn simple language speak the words of truth to them. Sing to them\npleasant, attractive songs which reveal the love of Christ. Bring your\nchildren to Jesus, for He loves little children.\nKeep cheerful. Do not forget that you have a Comforter, the\nHoly Spirit, which Christ has appointed. You are never alone. If you\nwill listen to the voice that now speaks to you, if you will respond\nwithout delay to the knocking at the door of your heart, \u201cCome\nin, Lord Jesus, that I may sup with Thee, and Thee with me,\u201d the\nheavenly Guest will enter. When this element, which is all divine,\nabides with you, there is peace and rest.3\nMaintain Christian Principles\u2014The household where God is\nnot worshiped is like a ship in the midst of the sea without a pilot or\nAttitude Toward an Unbelieving Companion 277\na helm. The tempest beats and breaks upon it, and there is danger\nthat all on board may perish. Regard your life and the lives of your\nchildren as precious for Christ\u2019s sake, for you must meet them and\nyour husband before the throne of God. Your steadfast Christian\nprinciples must not become weak, but stronger and stronger. How-\never much your husband may be annoyed, however strongly he may\noppose you, you must show a consistent, faithful, Christian stead-\nfastness. And then whatever he may say, in heart and judgment he\ncan but respect you, if he has a heart of flesh.4\nGod\u2019s Claims to Come First[Note: Taken from chapter \u201cWarn- [351]\nings and Reproofs,\u201d in which are found testimonies to a number of\nmembers in a certain church. This follows a message addressed to\na brother T.\u2014Compilers.]\u2014I was then shown his daughter-in-law.\nShe is beloved of God, but held in servile bondage, fearing, trem-\nbling, desponding, doubting, and very nervous. This sister should\nnot feel that she must yield her will to a godless youth who has less\nyears upon his head than herself. She should remember that her mar-\nriage does not destroy her individuality. God has claims upon her\nhigher than any earthly claim. Christ has bought her with His own\nblood. She is not her own. She fails to put her entire trust in God and\nsubmits to yield her convictions, her conscience, to an overbearing,\ntyrannical man, fired up by Satan whenever his satanic majesty can\nwork effectually through him to intimidate this trembling, shrinking\nsoul. She has so many times been thrown into agitation that her\nnervous system is shattered, and she is merely a wreck. Is it the\nwill of the Lord that this sister should be in this state and God be\nrobbed of her service? No. Her marriage was a deception of the\ndevil. Yet now she should make the best of it, treat her husband with\ntenderness, and make him as happy as she can without violating\nher conscience; for if he remains in his rebellion, this world is all\nthe heaven he will have. But to deprive herself of the privilege of\nmeetings, to gratify an overbearing husband possessing the spirit of\nthe dragon, is not according to God\u2019s will.5\n\u201cAnd another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot\ncome.\u201d The sin of this man was not in marrying, but in marrying\none who divorced his mind from the higher and more important\ninterests of life. Never should a man allow wife and home to draw\nhis thoughts away from Christ or to lead him to refuse to accept the [352]\n278 The Adventist Home\ngracious invitations of the gospel.6\nBetter Save Part Than Lose All \u2014Brother K, you have had\nmany discouragements; but you must be earnest, firm, and decided\nto do your duty in your family, and take them with you if possible.\nYou should spare no effort to prevail upon them to accompany you\non your heavenward journey. But if the mother and the children do\nnot choose to accompany you, but rather seek to draw you away\nfrom your duties and religious privileges, you must go forward even\nif you go alone. You must live in the fear of God. You must improve\nyour opportunities of attending the meetings and gaining all the\nspiritual strength you can, for you will need it in the days to come.\nLot\u2019s property was all consumed. If you should meet with loss, you\nshould not be discouraged; and if you can save only a part of your\nfamily, it is much better than to lose all.7\n1Letter 28, 1890.\n2Letter 145, 1900.\n3Letter 124, 1897.\n4Letter 76, 1896.\n5Testimonies for the Church 2:99, 100.\n6Manuscript 24, 1891.\n7Testimonies for the Church 4:112, 113.\nChapter 58\u2014The Minister\u2019s Family [353]\nHome Life of Minister to Exemplify Message\u2014God designs\nthat in his home life the teacher of the Bible shall be an exempli-\nfication of the truths that he teaches. What a man is has greater\ninfluence than what he says. Piety in the daily life will give power\nto the public testimony. Patience, consistency, and love will make\nan impression on hearts that sermons fail to reach.1\nIf properly carried on, the training of the children of a minister\nwill illustrate the lessons he gives in the desk. But if, by the wrong\neducation he has given his children, a minister shows his incapacity\nto govern and control, he needs to learn that God requires him to\nproperly discipline the children given him before he can do his duty\nas shepherd of the flock of God.2\nHis First Duty Is to His Children \u2014The minister\u2019s duties lie\naround him, nigh and afar off; but his first duty is to his children.\nHe should not become so engrossed with his outside duties as to\nneglect the instruction which his children need. He may look upon\nhis home duties as of lesser importance, but in reality they lie at the\nvery foundation of the well-being of individuals and of society. To\na large degree the happiness of men and women and the success of\nthe church depend upon home influence....\nNothing can excuse the minister for neglecting the inner circle\nfor the larger circle outside. The spiritual welfare of his family\ncomes first. In the day of final reckoning God will inquire what\nhe did to win to Christ those whom he took the responsibility of\nbringing into the world. Great good done for others cannot cancel [354]\nthe debt that he owes to God to care for his own children.3\nThe Magnitude of the Minister\u2019s Influence\u2014Ministers\u2019 chil-\ndren are in some cases the most neglected children in the world, for\nthe reason that the father is with them but little, and they are left to\nchoose their own employment and amusement.4\nGreat as are the evils of parental unfaithfulness under any cir-\ncumstances, they are tenfold greater when they exist in the families\n279\n280 The Adventist Home\nof those appointed as teachers of the people. When these fail to\ncontrol their own households, they are, by their wrong example,\nmisleading many. Their guilt is as much greater than that of others\nas their position is more responsible.5\nWife and Children Best Judge of His Piety\u2014It is not so much\nthe religion of the pulpit as the religion of the family that reveals\nour real character. The minister\u2019s wife, his children, and those who\nare employed as helpers in his family are best qualified to judge of\nhis piety. A good man will be a blessing to his household. Wife,\nchildren, and helpers will all be the better for his religion.\nBrethren, carry Christ into the family, carry Him into the pulpit,\ncarry Him with you wherever you go. Then you need not urge upon\nothers the necessity of appreciating the ministry, for you will bear\nthe heavenly credentials which will prove to all that you are servants\nof Christ.6\nThe Minister\u2019s Wife, a Helper or a Hindrance? \u2014When a\nman accepts the responsibilities of a minister, he claims to be a\nmouthpiece for God, to take the words from the mouth of God and\ngive them to the people. How closely, then, he should keep at the\nside of the Great Shepherd; how humbly he should walk before God,[355]\nkeeping self out of sight and exalting Christ! And how important it\nis that the character of his wife be after the Bible pattern, and that\nhis children be in subjection with all gravity!\nThe wife of a minister of the gospel can be either a most success-\nful helper and a great blessing to her husband or a hindrance to him\nin his work. It depends very much on the wife whether a minister\nwill rise from day to day in his sphere of usefulness, or whether he\nwill sink to the ordinary level.7\nI saw that the wives of the ministers should help their husbands\nin their labors and be exact and careful what influence they exert,\nfor they are watched, and more is expected of them than of others.\nTheir dress should be an example. Their lives and conversation\nshould be an example, savoring of life rather than of death. I saw\nthat they should take a humble, meek, yet exalted stand, not having\ntheir conversation upon things that do not tend to direct the mind\nheavenward. The great inquiry should be: \u201cHow can I save my own\nsoul and be the means of saving others?\u201d I saw that no halfhearted\nwork in this matter is accepted of God. He wants the whole heart\nMinister\u2019s Family 281\nand interest, or He will have none. Their influence tells, decidedly,\nunmistakably, in favor of the truth or against it. They gather with\nJesus or scatter abroad. An unsanctified wife is the greatest curse\nthat a minister can have.8\nSatan is ever at work to dishearten and lead astray ministers\nwhom God has chosen to preach the truth. The most effectual\nway in which he can work is through home influences, through\nunconsecrated companions. If he can control their minds, he can\nthrough them the more readily gain access to the husband, who is\nlaboring in word and doctrine to save souls.... Satan has had much to [356]\ndo with controlling the labors of the ministers through the influence\nof selfish, ease-loving companions.9\nWords of Counsel to Ministers Regarding Family Manage-\nment\u2014You have a duty to do at home which you cannot shun and\nyet be true to God and to your God-given trust.... The gospel field is\nthe world. You wish to sow the field with gospel truth, waiting for\nGod to water the seed sown that it may bring forth fruit. You have\nentrusted to you a little plot of ground; but your own dooryard is\nleft to grow up with brambles and thorns, while you are engaged in\nweeding others\u2019 gardens. This is not a small work, but one of great\nmoment. You are preaching the gospel to others; practice it yourself\nat home.10\nUntil you can be united in the work of properly disciplining your\nchild, let the wife remain with her child away from the scene of her\nhusband\u2019s labors; for no example of lax, loose discipline should be\ngiven to the church of God.\nI have known many ministers who were unwise enough to travel\nabout, taking with them an unruly child. Their labors in the pul-\npit were counteracted by the unlovely tempers manifested by their\nchildren.11\nTake an Interest in Others\u2019 Children \u2014Your interest should\nnot be swallowed up in your own family to the exclusion of others.\nIf you share the hospitalities of your brethren, they may reasonably\nexpect something in return. Identify your interests with those of\nparents and children, and seek to instruct and bless. Sanctify yourself\nto the work of God, and be a blessing to those who entertain you,\nconversing with parents and in no case overlooking the children. Do [357]\n282 The Adventist Home\nnot feel that your own little one is more precious in the sight of God\nthan other children.12\nAn Appeal to a Minister\u2019s Wayward Son \u2014Your father is a\nminister of the gospel, and Satan works most zealously to lead the\nchildren of ministers to dishonor their parents. If possible he will\nbring them into captivity to his will and imbue them with his evil\npropensities. Will you allow Satan to work through you to destroy\nthe hope and comfort of your parents? Will they be obliged to\nlook upon you with continual sadness because you give yourself\ninto Satan\u2019s control? Will you leave them to the discouragement\nof thinking that they have brought up children who refuse to be\ninstructed by them, who follow their own inclinations whatever\nhappens? ...\nYou have good impulses, and you awaken hope and expectation\nin the minds of your parents; but, so far, you have been powerless to\nresist temptation, and Satan exults in your readiness to do just as he\nwills. Often you make statements which inspire your parents with\nhope, but just as often you fail because you will not resist the enemy.\nYou cannot know how it pains your father and mother when you\nare found on Satan\u2019s side. Many times you say, \u201cI cannot do this,\u201d\nand \u201cI cannot do that,\u201d when you know that the things you say you\ncannot do are right for you to do. You can fight against the enemy,\nnot in your own strength, but in the strength God is ever ready to\ngive you. Trusting in His word, you will never say, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d ...\nI appeal to you in the name of the Lord to turn before it is too\nlate. Because you are the son of parents who are co-workers with\nGod, you are supposed to be a well-disposed boy; but often, by your\nwaywardness, you dishonor your father and mother and counteract\nthe work they are seeking to do. Has not your mother sufficient[358]\nto oppress and crush her spirits without your waywardness? Will\nyou still pursue such a course of action that your father\u2019s heart will\nbe weighed down with grief? Is it a pleasure for you to have all\nheaven looking upon you with displeasure? Is it a satisfaction for\nyou to place yourself in the ranks of the enemy, to be ordered and\ncontrolled by him?\nOh, that now, while it is called today, you would turn to the\nLord! Your every deed is making you either better or worse. If your\nactions are on Satan\u2019s side, they leave behind them an influence that\nMinister\u2019s Family 283\ncontinues to work its baleful results. Only the pure, the clean, and\nthe holy can enter the city of God, \u201cToday if ye will hear His voice,\nharden not your hearts,\u201d but turn to the Lord, that the path you travel\nmay not leave desolation in its track.13\nMinister to Treat Children With Kindness and Courtesy \u2014\nLet the kindness and courtesy of the minister be seen in his treatment\nof children. He should ever bear in mind that they are miniature\nmen and women, younger members of the Lord\u2019s family. These may\nbe very near and dear to the Master and, if properly instructed and\ndisciplined, will do service for Him, even in their youth. Christ is\ngrieved with every harsh, severe, and inconsiderate word spoken\nto children. Their rights are not always respected, and they are\nfrequently treated as though they had not an individual character\nwhich needs to be properly developed that it may not be warped and\nthe purpose of God in their lives prove a failure.14\nLet the church take a special care of the lambs of the flock,\nexerting every influence in their power to win the love of the children [359]\nand to bind them to the truth. Ministers and church members should\nsecond the efforts of parents to lead the children into safe paths. The\nLord is calling for the youth, for He would make them His helpers\nto do good service under His banner.15\nAn Effectual Sermon on Godliness\u2014The minister should in-\nstruct the people upon the government of children, and his own\nchildren should be examples of proper subjection.16\nThere should exist in the minister\u2019s family a unity that will preach\nan effectual sermon on practical godliness. As the minister and his\nwife faithfully do their duty in the home, restraining, correcting, ad-\nvising, counseling, guiding, they are becoming better fitted to labor\nin the church and are multiplying agencies for the accomplishment\nof God\u2019s work outside the home. The members of the family become\nmembers of the family above and are a power for good, exerting a\nfar-reaching influence.17\n1Gospel Workers, 204.\n2Letter 1, 1877.\n3Gospel Workers, 204.\n4Ibid., 206.\n5Patriarchs and Prophets, 579.\n6Testimonies for the Church 5:161.\n284 The Adventist Home\n7Letter 1, 1877.\n8Testimonies for the Church 1:139.\n9Testimonies for the Church 1:449, 451.\n10Testimonies for the Church 4:381.\n11Letter 1, 1877.\n12Testimonies for the Church 4:382.\n13Letter 15a, 1896.\n14Testimonies for the Church 4:397, 398.\n15The Review and Herald, October 25, 1892.\n16Letter 1, 1877.\n17Gospel Workers, 204, 205.\nChapter 59\u2014The Aged Parents [360]\n\u201cHonor Thy Father and Thy Mother.\u201d\u2014The obligation rest-\ning upon children to honor their parents is of lifelong duration. If the\nparents are feeble and old, the affection and attention of the children\nshould be bestowed in proportion to the need of father and mother.\nNobly, decidedly, the children should shape their course of action\neven if it requires self-denial, so that every thought of anxiety and\nperplexity may be removed from the minds of the parents....\nChildren should be educated to love and care tenderly for father\nand mother. Care for them, children, yourselves; for no other hand\ncan do the little acts of kindness with the acceptance that you can\ndo them. Improve your precious opportunity to scatter seeds of\nkindness.1\nOur obligation to our parents never ceases. Our love for them,\nand theirs for us, is not measured by years or distance, and our\nresponsibility can never be set aside.2\nLet children carefully remember that at the best the aged parents\nhave but little joy and comfort. What can bring greater sorrow to\ntheir hearts than manifest neglect on the part of their children? What\nsin can be worse in children than to bring grief to an aged, helpless\nfather or mother?3\nSmooth the Pathway\u2014After children grow to years of maturity,\nsome of them think their duty is done in providing an abode for their\nparents. While giving them food and shelter, they give them no love\nor sympathy. In their parents\u2019 old age, when they long for expression\nof affection and sympathy, children heartlessly deprive them of their [361]\nattention. There is no time when children should withhold respect\nand love from their father and mother. While the parents live, it\nshould be the children\u2019s joy to honor and respect them. They should\nbring all the cheerfulness and sunshine into the life of the aged\nparents that they possibly can. They should smooth their pathway\nto the grave. There is no better recommendation in this world than\n285\n286 The Adventist Home\nthat a child has honored his parents, no better record in the books of\nheaven than that he has loved and honored father and mother.4\nIngratitude to Parents\u2014Is it possible that children can become\nso dead to the claims of father and mother that they will not willingly\nremove all causes of sorrow in their power, watching over them with\nunwearying care and devotion? Can it be possible that they will\nnot regard it a pleasure to make the last days of their parents their\nbest days? How can a son or daughter be willing to leave father or\nmother on the hands of strangers for them to care for! Even were\nthe mother an unbeliever and disagreeable, it would not release the\nchild from the obligation that God has placed upon him to care for\nhis parent.5\nSome Parents Are Responsible for Disrespect\u2014When parents\npermit a child to show them disrespect in childhood, allowing them\nto speak pettishly and even harshly, there will be a dreadful harvest\nto be reaped in after years. When parents fail to require prompt and\nperfect obedience in their children, they fail to lay the right founda-\ntion of character in their little ones. They prepare their children to\ndishonor them when they are old, and bring sorrow to their hearts\nwhen they are nearing the grave, unless the grace of Christ changes\nthe hearts and transforms the characters of their children.6\nShow No Retaliation Against Unjust Parents \u2014Said one of[362]\nher mother, \u201cI always hated my mother, and my mother hated me.\u201d\nThese words stand registered in the books of heaven to be opened and\nrevealed in the day of judgment when everyone shall be rewarded\naccording to his works.\nIf children think that they were treated with severity in their\nchildhood, will it help them to grow in grace and in the knowledge\nof Christ, will it make them reflect His image, to cherish a spirit of\nretaliation and revenge against their parents, especially when they\nare old and feeble? Will not the very helplessness of the parents\nplead for the children\u2019s love? Will not the necessities of the aged\nfather and mother call forth the noble feelings of the heart, and\nthrough the grace of Christ, shall not the parents be treated with\nkind attention and respect by their offspring? Oh, let not the heart\nbe made as adamant as steel against father and mother! How can a\ndaughter professing the name of Christ cherish hatred against her\nmother, especially if that mother is sick and old? Let kindness and\nAged Parents 287\nlove, the sweetest fruits of Christian life, find a place in the heart of\nchildren toward their parents.7\nBe Patient With Infirmities \u2014Especially dreadful is the\nthought of a child turning in hatred upon a mother who has be-\ncome old and feeble, upon whom has come those infirmities of\ndisposition attendant upon second childhood. How patiently, how\ntenderly, should children bear with such a mother! Tender words\nwhich will not irritate the spirit should be spoken. A true Christian\nwill never be unkind, never under any circumstances be neglectful\nof his father or mother, but will heed the command, \u201cHonour thy\nfather and thy mother.\u201d God has said, \u201cThou shalt rise up before the [363]\nhoary head, and honour the face of the old man.\u201d ...\nChildren, let your parents, infirm and unable to care for them-\nselves, find their last days filled with contentment, peace, and love.\nFor Christ\u2019s sake let them go down to the grave receiving from you\nonly words of kindness, love, mercy, and forgiveness. You desire\nthe Lord to love and pity and forgive you, and to make all your bed\nin your sickness, and will you not treat others as you would wish to\nbe treated yourself?8\nGod\u2019s Plan of Caring for the Aged\u2014The matter of caring for\nour aged brethren and sisters who have no homes is constantly\nbeing urged. What can be done for them? The light which the\nLord has given me has been repeated: It is not best to establish\ninstitutions for the care of the aged, that they may be in a company\ntogether. Nor should they be sent away from home to receive care.\nLet the members of every family minister to their own relatives.\nWhen this is not possible, the work belongs to the church, and it\nshould be accepted both as a duty and as a privilege. All who have\nChrist\u2019s spirit will regard the feeble and aged with special respect\nand tenderness.9\nA Privilege That Brings Satisfaction and Joy \u2014The thought\nthat children have ministered to the comfort of their parents is a\nthought of satisfaction all through the life, and will especially bring\nthem joy when they themselves are in need of sympathy and love.\nThose whose hearts are filled with love will regard the privilege of\nsmoothing the passage to the grave for their parents an inestimable\nprivilege. They will rejoice that they had a part in bringing comfort\nand peace to the last days of their loved parents. To do otherwise [364]\n288 The Adventist Home\nthan this, to deny to the helpless aged ones the kindly ministrations\nof sons and daughters, would fill the soul with remorse, the days\nwith regret, if our hearts were not hardened and cold as a stone.10\n1Manuscript 18, 1891.\n2The Review and Herald, November 15, 1892.\n3Ibid.\n4Ibid.\n5Ibid.\n6Manuscript 18, 1891.\n7Ibid.\n8Ibid.\n9Testimonies for the Church 6:272.\n10The Review and Herald, November 15, 1892.\nSection 13\u2014The Use of Money [365]\nChapter 60\u2014Stewards of God[366]\n[367]\nWe Are to Recognize God\u2019s Ownership\u2014That which lies at\nthe foundation of business integrity and of true success is the recog-\nnition of God\u2019s ownership. The Creator of all things, He is the\noriginal proprietor. We are His stewards. All that we have is a trust\nfrom Him, to be used according to His direction.\nThis is an obligation that rests upon every human being. It has to\ndo with the whole sphere of human activity. Whether we recognize it\nor not, we are stewards, supplied from God with talents and facilities\nand placed in the world to do a work appointed by Him.1\nMoney is not ours; houses and grounds, pictures and furniture,\ngarments and luxuries, do not belong to us. We are pilgrims, we are\nstrangers. We have only a grant of those things that are necessary\nfor health and life.... Our temporal blessings are given us in trust, to\nprove whether we can be entrusted with eternal riches. If we endure\nthe proving of God, then we shall receive that purchased possession\nwhich is to be our own\u2014glory, honor, and immortality.2\nWe Must Give an Account\u2014If our own people would only put\ninto the cause of God the money that has been lent them in trust, that\nportion which they spend in selfish gratification, in idolatry, they\nwould lay up treasure in heaven, and would be doing the very work\nGod requires them to do. But like the rich man in the parable, they\nlive sumptuously. The money God has lent them in trust, to be used\nto His name\u2019s glory, they spend extravagantly. They do not stop to[368]\nconsider their accountability to God. They do not stop to consider\nthat there is to be a reckoning day not far hence, when they must\ngive an account of their stewardship.3\nWe should ever remember that in the judgment we must meet\nthe record of the way we use God\u2019s money. Much is spent in self-\npleasing, self-gratification, that does us no real good, but positive\ninjury. If we realize that God is the giver of all good things, that\nthe money is His, then we shall exercise wisdom in its expenditure,\nconforming to His holy will. The world, its customs, its fashions,\n290\nStewards of God 291\nwill not be our standard. We shall not have a desire to conform to its\npractices; we shall not permit our own inclinations to control us.4\nIn our use of money we can make it an agent of spiritual im-\nprovement by regarding it as a sacred trust, not to be employed to\nadminister to pride, vanity, appetite, or passion.5\nI was shown that the recording angel makes a faithful record\nof every offering dedicated to God and put into the treasury and\nalso of the final result of the means thus bestowed. The eye of God\ntakes cognizance of every farthing devoted to His cause and of the\nwillingness or reluctance of the giver. The motive in giving is also\nchronicled.6\nSystematic Giving for the Family\u2014\u201cLet every one of you lay\nby him in store, as God hath prospered him.\u201d Every member of\nthe family, from the oldest down to the youngest, may take part in\nthis work of benevolence.... The plan of systematic benevolence\n[Note: Reference is here made to plans followed early by the church\nin laying aside weekly the tithes and offerings.\u2014Compilers.] will\nprove a safeguard to every family against temptations to spend means [369]\nfor needless things, and especially will it prove a blessing to the rich\nby guarding them from indulging in extravagances.\nEvery week the demands of God upon each family are brought\nto mind by each of its members fully carrying out the plan; and\nas they have denied themselves some superfluity in order to have\nmeans to put into the treasury, lessons of value in self-denial for\nthe glory of God have been impressed upon the heart. Once a week\neach is brought face to face with the doings of the past week\u2014the\nincome that he might have had if he had been economical, and the\nmeans that he does not have because of indulgence. His conscience\nis reined up, as it were, before God and either commends or accuses\nhim. He learns that if he retains peace of mind and the favor of God,\nhe must eat and drink and dress to His glory.7\nMake God\u2019s Requirements First\u2014God\u2019s requirements come\nfirst. We are not doing His will if we consecrate to Him what is\nleft of our income after all our imaginary wants have been supplied.\nBefore any part of our earnings is consumed, we should take out and\npresent to Him that portion which He claims. In the old dispensation\nan offering of gratitude was kept continually burning upon the altar,\nthus showing man\u2019s endless obligation to God. If we have prosperity\n292 The Adventist Home\nin our secular business, it is because God blesses us. A part of this\nincome is to be devoted to the poor, and a large portion to be applied\nto the cause of God. When that which God claims is rendered to\nHim, the remainder will be sanctified and blessed to our own use.\nBut when a man robs God by withholding that which He requires,\nHis curse rests upon the whole.8\nRemember the Needy Poor\u2014If we represent the character of[370]\nChrist, every particle of selfishness must be expelled from the soul.\nIn carrying forward the work He gave to our hands, it will be nec-\nessary for us to give every jot and tittle of our means that we can\nspare. Poverty and distress in families will come to our knowledge,\nand afflicted and suffering ones will have to be relieved. We know\nvery little of the human suffering that exists everywhere about us;\nbut as we have opportunity, we should be ready to render immediate\nassistance to those who are under a severe pressure.9\nThe squandering of money in luxuries deprives the poor of the\nmeans necessary to supply them with food and clothing. That which\nis spent for the gratification of pride in dress, in buildings, in furni-\nture, and in decorations would relieve the distress of many wretched,\nsuffering families. God\u2019s stewards are to minister to the needy.10\nGod\u2019s Remedy for Selfishness and Covetousness\u2014The giving\nthat is the fruit of self-denial is a wonderful help to the giver. It\nimparts an education that enables us more fully to comprehend the\nwork of Him who went about doing good, relieving the suffering,\nand supplying the needs of the destitute.11\nConstant, self-denying benevolence is God\u2019s remedy for the\ncankering sins of selfishness and covetousness. God has arranged\nsystematic benevolence to sustain His cause and relieve the necessi-\nties of the suffering and needy. He has ordained that giving should\nbecome a habit, that it may counteract the dangerous and deceit-\nful sin of covetousness. Continual giving starves covetousness to\ndeath. Systematic benevolence is designed in the order of God to\ntear away treasures from the covetous as fast as they are gained, and[371]\nto consecrate them to the Lord, to whom they belong....\nThe constant practice of God\u2019s plan of systematic benevolence\nweakens covetousness and strengthens benevolence. If riches in-\ncrease, men, even those professing godliness, set their hearts upon\nthem; and the more they have, the less they give to the treasury of\nStewards of God 293\nthe Lord. Thus riches make men selfish, and hoarding feeds cov-\netousness; and these evils strengthen by active exercise. God knows\nour danger and has hedged us about with means to prevent our own\nruin. He requires the constant exercise of benevolence, that the force\nof habit in good works may break the force of habit in an opposite\ndirection.12\n1Education, 137.\n2Letter 8, 1889.\n3Letter 21, 1898.\n4Letter 8, 1889.\n5Ibid.\n6Testimonies for the Church 2:518, 519.\n7Ibid., 3:412.\n8Ibid., 4:477.\n9Manuscript 25, 1894.\n10The Review and Herald, December 8, 1896.\n11The Youth\u2019s Instructor, September 10, 1907.\n12Testimonies for the Church 3:548.\nChapter 61\u2014Principles of Family Finance[372]\nMoney May Be a Blessing or a Curse \u2014Money is not neces-\nsarily a curse; it is of high value because if rightly appropriated, it\ncan do good in the salvation of souls, in blessing others who are\npoorer than ourselves. By an improvident or unwise use, ... money\nwill become a snare to the user. He who employs money to gratify\npride and ambition makes it a curse rather than a blessing. Money\nis a constant test of the affections. Whoever acquires more than\nsufficient for his real needs should seek wisdom and grace to know\nhis own heart and to keep his heart diligently, lest he have imaginary\nwants and become an unfaithful steward, using with prodigality his\nLord\u2019s entrusted capital.\nWhen we love God supremely, temporal things will occupy their\nright place in our affections. If we humbly and earnestly seek for\nknowledge and ability in order to make a right use of our Lord\u2019s\ngoods, we shall receive wisdom from above. When the heart leans to\nits own preferences and inclinations, when the thought is cherished\nthat money can confer happiness without the favor of God, then the\nmoney becomes a tyrant, ruling the man; it receives his confidence\nand esteem and is worshiped as a god. Honor, truth, righteousness,\nand justice are sacrificed upon its altar. The commands of God\u2019s\nword are set aside, and the world\u2019s customs and usages, which King\nMammon has ordained, become a controlling power.1\nSeek Security in Home Ownership\u2014If the laws given by God\nhad continued to be carried out, how different would be the present\ncondition of the world, morally, spiritually, and temporally. Self-[373]\nishness and self-importance would not be manifested as now, but\neach would cherish a kind regard for the happiness and welfare of\nothers.... Instead of the poorer classes being kept under the iron\nheel of oppression by the wealthy, instead of having other men\u2019s\nbrains to think and plan for them in temporal as well as in spiritual\nthings, they would have some chance for independence of thought\nand action.\n294\nPrinciples of Family Finance 295\nThe sense of being owners of their own homes would inspire\nthem with a strong desire for improvement. They would soon acquire\nskill in planning and devising for themselves; their children would\nbe educated to habits of industry and economy, and the intellect\nwould be greatly strengthened. They would feel that they are men,\nnot slaves, and would be able to regain to a great degree their lost\nself-respect and moral independence.2\nEducate our people to get out of the cities into the country, where\nthey can obtain a small piece of land and make a home for themselves\nand their children.3\nCaution Regarding Selling Homes\u2014There are poor men and\nwomen who are writing to me for advice as to whether they shall\nsell their homes and give the proceeds to the cause. They say the\nappeals for means stir their souls, and they want to do something\nfor the Master, who has done everything for them. I would say to\nsuch: \u201cIt may not be your duty to sell your little homes just now, but\ngo to God for yourselves; the Lord will certainly hear your earnest\nprayers for wisdom to understand your duty.\u201d4\nGod does not now call for the houses His people need to live in;\nbut if those who have an abundance do not hear His voice, cut loose\nfrom the world, and sacrifice for God, He will pass them by and will [374]\ncall for those who are willing to do anything for Jesus, even to sell\ntheir homes to meet the wants of the cause.5\nA Praiseworthy Independence\u2014Independence of one kind is\npraiseworthy. To desire to bear your own weight and not to eat\nthe bread of dependence is right. It is a noble, generous ambition\nthat dictates the wish to be self-supporting. Industrious habits and\nfrugality are necessary.6\nBalancing the Budget\u2014Many, very many, have not so educated\nthemselves that they can keep their expenditures within the limit\nof their income. They do not learn to adapt themselves to circum-\nstances, and they borrow and borrow again and again and become\noverwhelmed in debt, and consequently they become discouraged\nand disheartened.7\nKeep a Record of Expenditures\u2014Habits of self-indulgence or\na want of tact and skill on the part of the wife and mother may be\na constant drain upon the treasury; and yet that mother may think\nshe is doing her best because she has never been taught to restrict\n296 The Adventist Home\nher wants or the wants of her children and has never acquired skill\nand tact in household matters. Hence one family may require for its\nsupport twice the amount that would suffice for another family of\nthe same size.\nAll should learn how to keep accounts. Some neglect this work\nas nonessential, but this is wrong. All expenses should be accurately\nstated.8\nThe Evils of Spendthrift Habits\u2014The Lord has been pleased\nto present before me the evils which result from spendthrift habits,[375]\nthat I might admonish parents to teach their children strict economy.\nTeach them that money spent for that which they do not need is\nperverted from its proper use.9\nIf you have extravagant habits, cut them away from your life at\nonce. Unless you do this, you will be bankrupt for eternity. Habits of\neconomy, industry, and sobriety are a better portion for your children\nthan a rich dowry.\nWe are pilgrims and strangers on the earth. Let us not spend our\nmeans in gratifying desires that God would have us repress. Let us\nfitly represent our faith by restricting our wants.10\nA Parent Reproved for Extravagance\u2014You do not know how\nto use money economically and do not learn to bring your wants\nwithin your income.... You have an eager desire to get money, that\nyou may freely use it as your inclination shall dictate, and your\nteaching and example have proved a curse to your children. How\nlittle they care for principle! They are more and more forgetful of\nGod, less fearful of His displeasure, more impatient of restraint. The\nmore easily money is obtained, the less thankfulness is felt.11\nTo a Family Living Beyond Its Means\u2014You ought to be care-\nful that your expenses do not exceed your income. Bind about your\nwants.\nIt is a great pity that your wife is so much like you in this matter of\nexpending means so that she cannot be a help to you in this direction,\nto watch the little outgoes in order to avoid the larger leaks. Needless\nexpenses are constantly brought about in your family management.\nYour wife loves to see her children dress in a manner beyond their[376]\nmeans, and because of this, tastes and habits are cultivated in your\nchildren which will make them vain and proud. If you would learn\nthe lesson of economy and see the peril to yourselves and to your\nPrinciples of Family Finance 297\nchildren and to the cause of God in this free use of means, you would\nobtain an experience essential to the perfection of your Christian\ncharacter. Unless you do obtain such an experience, your children\nwill bear the mold of a defective education as long as they live....\nI would not influence you to hoard up means\u2014it would be dif-\nficult for you to do this\u2014but I would counsel you both to expend\nyour money carefully and let your daily example teach lessons of\nfrugality, self-denial, and economy to your children. They need to\nbe educated by precept and example.12\nA Family Called to Self-denial \u2014I was shown that you, my\nbrother and sister, have much to learn. You have not lived within\nyour means. You have not learned to economize. If you earn high\nwages, you do not know how to make it go as far as possible. You\nconsult taste or appetite instead of prudence. At times you expend\nmoney for a quality of food in which your brethren cannot afford to\nindulge. Dollars slip from your pocket very easily.... Self-denial is a\nlesson which you both have yet to learn.13\nParents should learn to live within their means. They should\ncultivate self-denial in their children, teaching them by precept and\nexample. They should make their wants few and simple, that there\nmay be time for mental improvement and spiritual culture.14\nIndulgence Not an Expression of Love\u2014Do not educate your\nchildren to think that your love for them must be expressed by [377]\nindulgence of their pride, extravagance, and love of display. There is\nno time now to invent ways for using up money. Use your inventive\nfaculties in seeking to economize.15\nEconomy Consistent With Generosity \u2014The natural turn of\nyouth in this age is to neglect and despise economy and to confound\nit with stinginess and narrowness. But economy is consistent with\nthe most broad and liberal views and feelings; there can be no true\ngenerosity where it is not practiced. No one should think it beneath\nhim to study.16\nThe Other Extreme\u2014Unwise Economy\u2014God is not honored\nwhen the body is neglected or abused and is thus unfitted for His\nservice. To care for the body by providing for it food that is relishable\nand strengthening is one of the first duties of the householder. It is\nfar better to have less expensive clothing and furniture than to stint\nthe supply of food.\n298 The Adventist Home\nSome householders stint the family table in order to provide\nexpensive entertainment for visitors. This is unwise. In the enter-\ntainment of guests there should be greater simplicity. Let the needs\nof the family have first attention.\nUnwise economy and artificial customs often prevent the exercise\nof hospitality where it is needed and would be a blessing. The regular\nsupply of food for our tables should be such that the unexpected\nguest can be made welcome without burdening the housewife to\nmake extra preparation.17\nOur economy must never be of that kind which would lead to\nproviding meager meals. Students should have an abundance of[378]\nwholesome food. But let those in charge of the cooking gather up\nthe fragments that nothing be lost.18\nEconomy does not mean niggardliness, but a prudent expenditure\nof means because there is a great work to be done.19\nProvide Conveniences to Lighten Wife\u2019s Labor\u2014Brother E\u2019s\nfamily live in accordance with the principles of strictest economy....\nBrother E had conscientiously decided not to build a convenient\nwoodshed and kitchen for his large family, because he did not feel\nfree to invest means in personal conveniences when the cause of\nGod needed money to carry it forward. I tried to show him that it\nwas necessary for the health as well as the morals of his children that\nhe should make home pleasant and provide conveniences to lighten\nthe labor of his wife.20\nWife\u2019s Allowance for Personal Use\u2014You must help each other.\nDo not look upon it as a virtue to hold fast the purse strings, refusing\nto give your wife money.21\nYou should allow your wife a certain sum weekly and should\nlet her do what she please with this money. You have not given her\nopportunity to exercise her tact or her taste because you have not a\nproper realization of the position that a wife should occupy. Your\nwife has an excellent and a well-balanced mind.22\nGive your wife a share of the money that you receive. Let her\nhave this as her own, and let her use it as she desires. She should\nhave been allowed to use the means that she earned as she in her\njudgment deemed best. If she had had a certain sum to use as her\nown, without being criticized, a great weight would have been lifted\nfrom her mind.23\nPrinciples of Family Finance 299\nSeek Comfort and Health\u2014Brother P has not made a judicious [379]\nuse of means. Wise judgment has not influenced him as much as\nhave the voices and desires of his children. He does not place the\nestimate that he should upon the means in his hands, and expend it\ncautiously for the most needful articles, for the very things he must\nhave for comfort and health. The entire family need to improve in\nthis respect. Many things are needed in the family for convenience\nand comfort. The lack of appreciating order and system in the\narrangement of family matters leads to destructiveness and working\nto great disadvantage.24\nWe cannot make the heart purer or holier by clothing the body\nin sackcloth or depriving the home of all that ministers to comfort,\ntaste, or convenience.25\nGod does not require that His people should deprive themselves\nof that which is really necessary for their health and comfort, but He\ndoes not approve of wantonness and extravagance and display.26\nLearn When to Spare and When to Spend\u2014You should learn\nto know when to spare and when to spend. We cannot be Christ\u2019s\nfollowers unless we deny self and lift the cross. We should pay up\nsquarely as we go; gather up the dropped stitches; bind off your rav-\neling edges, and know just what you can call your own. You should\nreckon up all the littles spent in self-gratification. You should notice\nwhat is used simply to gratify taste and in cultivating a perverted, epi-\ncurean appetite. The money expended for useless delicacies might\nbe used to add to your substantial home comforts and conveniences.\nYou are not to be penurious; you are to be honest with yourself\nand your brethren. Penuriousness is an abuse of God\u2019s bounties.\nLavishness is also an abuse. The little outgoes that you think of as [380]\nnot worth mentioning amount to considerable in the end.27\nThe Surrendered Heart Will Be Guided\u2014It is not necessary\nto specify here how economy may be practiced in every particular.\nThose whose hearts are fully surrendered to God, and who take His\nword as their guide, will know how to conduct themselves in all the\nduties of life. They will learn of Jesus, who is meek and lowly of\nheart; and in cultivating the meekness of Christ, they will close the\ndoor against innumerable temptations.28\n300 The Adventist Home\n1Letter 8, 1889.\n2Historical Sketches of The S.D.A.

He\nwrought a miracle to feed the hungry thousands who had listened to\nHis teachings; yet after all had eaten and were satisfied, He did not\npermit the fragments to be wasted. He who could, in their necessity,\nfeed the vast multitude by His divine power bade His disciples gather\nup the fragments, that nothing might be lost. This lesson was given\nas much for our benefit as for those living in Christ\u2019s day. The Son\nof God has a care for the necessities of temporal life. He did not\nneglect the broken fragments after the feast, although He could make\nsuch a feast whenever He chose.1\nThe lessons of Jesus Christ are to be carried into every phase\nof practical life. Economy is to be practiced in all things. Gather\nup the fragments, that nothing be lost. There is a religion that does\nnot touch the heart and therefore becomes a form of words. It is not\nbrought into practical life. Religious duty and the highest human\nprudence in business lines must be co-mingled.2\nFollow Christ in Self-denial\u2014In order to become acquainted\nwith the disappointments and trials and griefs that come to human\nbeings, Christ reached to the lowest depths of woe and humiliation.\nHe has traveled the path that He asks His followers to travel. He says\nto them, \u201cIf any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and\ntake up his cross daily, and follow Me.\u201d But professing Christians\nare not always willing to practice the self-denial that the Saviour\ncalls for. They are not willing to bind about their wishes and desires [382]\nin order that they may have more to give to the Lord. One says, \u201cMy\nfamily are expensive in their tastes, and it costs much to keep them.\u201d\nThis shows that he and they need to learn the lessons of economy\ntaught by the life of Christ....\nTo all comes the temptation to gratify selfish, extravagant desires,\nbut let us remember that the Lord of life and glory came to this world\nto teach humanity the lesson of self-denial.3\n301\n302 The Adventist Home\nThose who do not live for self will not use up every dollar meet-\ning their supposed wants and supplying their conveniences, but will\nbear in mind that they are Christ\u2019s followers, and that there are others\nwho are in need of food and clothing.4\nEconomize to Help God\u2019s Cause\u2014Much might be said to the\nyoung people regarding their privilege to help the cause of God by\nlearning lessons of economy and self-denial. Many think that they\nmust indulge in this pleasure and that, and in order to do this, they\naccustom themselves to live up to the full extent of their income.\nGod wants us to do better in this respect. We sin against ourselves\nwhen we are satisfied with enough to eat and drink and wear. God\nhas something higher than this before us. When we are willing to\nput away our selfish desires and give the powers of heart and mind\nto the work of the cause of God, heavenly agencies will co-operate\nwith us, making us a blessing to humanity.\nEven though he may be poor, the youth who is industrious and\neconomical can save a little for the cause of God.5\nWhen Tempted to Needless Spending \u2014When you are\ntempted to spend money for knickknacks, you should remember[383]\nthe self-denial and self-sacrifice that Christ endured to save fallen\nman. Our children should be taught to exercise self-denial and self-\ncontrol. The reason so many ministers feel that they have a hard\ntime in financial matters is that they do not bind about their tastes,\ntheir appetites and inclinations. The reason so many men become\nbankrupt and dishonestly appropriate means is because they seek\nto gratify the extravagant tastes of their wives and children. How\ncareful should fathers and mothers be to teach economy by precept\nand example to their children!6\nI wish I could impress on every mind the grievous sinfulness\nof wasting the Lord\u2019s money on fancied wants. The expenditure\nof sums that look small may start a train of circumstances that will\nreach into eternity. When the judgment shall sit, and the books are\nopened, the losing side will be presented to your view\u2014the good\nthat you might have done with the accumulated mites and the larger\nsums that were used for wholly selfish purposes.7\nWatch the Pennies and Nickels\u2014Waste not your pennies and\nyour shillings in purchasing unnecessary things. You may think\nthese little sums do not amount to much, but these many littles will\nEconomy to be Practiced 303\nprove a great whole. If we could, we would plead for the means that\nis spent in needless things, in dress and selfish indulgence. Poverty\nin every shape is on every hand. And God has made it our duty to\nrelieve suffering humanity in every way possible.\nThe Lord would have His people thoughtful and caretaking. He\nwould have them study economy in everything, and waste nothing.8\nThe amount daily spent in needless things, with the thought, \u201cIt [384]\nis only a nickel,\u201d \u201cIt is only a dime,\u201d seems very little; but multiply\nthese littles by the days of the year, and as the years go by, the array\nof figures will seem almost incredible.9\nDo Not Emulate Fashionable Neighbors\u2014It is not best to pre-\ntend to be rich, or anything above what we are\u2014humble followers\nof the meek and lowly Saviour. We are not to feel disturbed if our\nneighbors build and furnish their houses in a manner that we are\nnot authorized to follow. How must Jesus look upon our selfish\nprovision for the indulgence of appetite, to please our guests, or to\ngratify our own inclination! It is a snare to us to aim at making a\ndisplay or to allow our children, under our control, to do so.10\nPersonal Experience in Mrs. White\u2019s Girlhood\u2014When I was\nonly twelve years old, I knew what it was to economize. With my\nsister I learned a trade, and although we would earn only twenty-five\ncents a day, from this sum we were able to save a little to give to\nmissions. We saved little by little until we had thirty dollars. Then\nwhen the message of the Lord\u2019s soon coming came to us, with a\ncall for men and means, we felt it a privilege to hand over the thirty\ndollars to father, asking him to invest it in tracts and pamphlets to\nsend the message to those who were in darkness....\nWith the money that we had earned at our trade, my sister and\nI provided ourselves with clothes. We would hand our money to\nmother, saying, \u201cBuy so that, after we have paid for our clothing,\nthere will be something left to give for missionary work.\u201d And she\nwould do this, thus encouraging in us a missionary spirit.11\nPractice Economy From Principle\u2014Those whose hands are [385]\nopen to respond to the calls for means to sustain the cause of God\nand to relieve the suffering and the needy are not the ones who are\nfound loose and lax and dilatory in their business management. They\nare always careful to keep their outgoes within their income. They\n304 The Adventist Home\nare economical from principle; they feel it their duty to save, that\nthey may have something to give.12\n1Testimonies for the Church 4:572, 573.\n2Manuscript 31, 1897.\n3Letter 4a, 1902.\n4The Review and Herald, August 21, 1894.\n5The Youth\u2019s Instructor, September 10, 1907.\n6Letter 11, 1888.\n7The Review and Herald, August 11, 1891.\n8Letter 21, 1898.\n9Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 63.\n10Letter 8, 1889.\n11The Youth\u2019s Instructor, September 10, 1907.\n12Testimonies for the Church 4:573.\nChapter 63\u2014Instructing Children How to Earn and [386]\nUse Money\nTeach Simple Habits in Daily Life \u2014Parents are to bring up\nand educate and train their children in habits of self-control and self-\ndenial. They are ever to keep before them their obligation to obey\nthe word of God and to live for the purpose of serving Jesus. They\nare to educate their children that there is need of living in accordance\nwith simple habits in their daily life, and to avoid expensive dress,\nexpensive diet, expensive houses, and expensive furniture.1\nWhen very young, children should be educated to read, to write,\nto understand figures, to keep their own accounts. They may go\nforward, advancing step by step in this knowledge. But before\neverything else, they should be taught that the fear of the Lord is the\nbeginning of wisdom.2\nYouth to Be Considerate of Family Finance\u2014Through erro-\nneous ideas regarding the use of money the youth are exposed to\nmany dangers. They are not to be carried along and supplied with\nmoney as if there were an inexhaustible supply from which they\ncould draw to gratify every supposed need. Money is to be regarded\nas a gift entrusted to us of God to do His work, to build up His\nkingdom, and the youth should learn to restrict their desires.3\nDo not make your wants many, especially if the income for home\nexpenses is limited. Bring your wants within your parents\u2019 means.\nThe Lord will recognize and commend your unselfish efforts.... Be [387]\nfaithful in that which is least. You will then be in no danger of\nneglecting greater responsibilities. God\u2019s word declares, \u201cHe that is\nfaithful in that which is least is faithful also in much.\u201d4\nGive Lessons in Money Values\u2014Money which comes to the\nyoung with but little effort on their part will not be valued. Some\nhave to obtain money by hard work and privation, but how much\nsafer are those youth who know just where their spending money\ncomes from, who know what their clothing and food costs, and what\nit takes to purchase a home!\n305\n306 The Adventist Home\nThere are many ways in which children can earn money them-\nselves and can act their part in bringing thank offerings to Jesus,\nwho gave His own life for them.... They should be taught that the\nmoney which they earn is not theirs to spend as their inexperienced\nminds may choose, but to use judiciously and to give to missionary\npurposes. They should not be satisfied to take money from their\nfather or mother and put it into the treasury as an offering, when it\nis not theirs. They should say to themselves, \u201cShall I give of that\nwhich costs me nothing?\u201d5\nThere is such a thing as giving unwise help to our children. Those\nwho work their way through college appreciate their advantages\nmore than those who are provided with them at someone else\u2019s\nexpense, for they know their cost. We must not carry our children\nuntil they become helpless burdens.6\nParents mistake their duty when they freely hand out money to\nany youth who has physical strength to enter on a course of study to\nbecome a minister or a physician before he has had an experience in\nuseful, taxing labor.7\nEncourage Children to Earn Their Own Money \u2014Many a[388]\nchild who lives out of the city can have a little plot of land where\nhe can learn to garden. He can be taught to make this a means of\nsecuring money to give to the cause of God. Both boys and girls can\nengage in this work; and it will, if they are rightly instructed, teach\nthem the value of money and how to economize. It is possible for the\nchildren, besides raising money for missionary purposes, to be able\nto help in buying their own clothes, and they should be encouraged\nto do this.8\nDiscourage the Reckless Use of Money \u2014Oh, how much\nmoney we waste on useless articles in the house, on ruffles and\nfancy dress, and on candies and other articles we do not need! Par-\nents, teach your children that it is wrong to use God\u2019s money in\nself-gratification.... Encourage them to save their pennies wherever\npossible, to be used in missionary work. They will gain rich experi-\nences through the practice of self-denial, and such lessons will often\nkeep them from acquiring habits of intemperance.9\nThe children may learn to show their love for Christ by denying\nthemselves needless trifles, for the purchase of which much money\nslips through their fingers. In every family this work should be done.\nInstructing Children How to Earn and Use Money 307\nIt requires tact and method, but it will be the best education the\nchildren can receive. And if all the little children would present their\nofferings to the Lord, their gifts would be as little rivulets which,\nwhen united and set flowing, would swell into a river.10\nKeep a little money box on the mantel or in some safe place\nwhere it can be seen, in which the children can place their offerings\nfor the Lord.... Thus they may be trained for God.11\nTeach Children to Pay Tithe and Offerings \u2014Not only does [389]\nthe Lord claim the tithe as His own, but He tells us how it should be\nreserved for Him. He says, \u201cHonour the Lord with thy substance,\nand with the firstfruits of all thine increase.\u201d This does not teach that\nwe are to spend our means on ourselves and bring to the Lord the\nremnant, even though it should be otherwise an honest tithe. Let\nGod\u2019s portion be first set apart. The directions given by the Holy\nSpirit through the Apostle Paul in regard to gifts present a principle\nthat applies also to tithing. \u201cUpon the first day of the week let every\none of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him.\u201d Parents\nand children are here included.12\nA Mistake Sometimes Made by Wealthy Fathers \u2014The cir-\ncumstances in which a child is placed will often have a more effec-\ntive influence on him than even the example of parents. There are\nwealthy men who expect their children to be what they were in their\nyouth, and blame the depravity of the age if they are not. But they\nhave no right to expect this of their children unless they place them\nin circumstances similar to those in which they themselves have\nlived. The circumstances of the father\u2019s life have made him what he\nis. In his youth he was pressed with poverty and had to work with\ndiligence and perseverance. His character was molded in the stern\nschool of poverty. He was forced to be modest in his wants, active\nin his work, simple in his tastes. He had to put his faculties to work\nin order to obtain food and clothing. He had to practice economy.\nFathers labor to place their children in a position of wealth, rather\nthan where they themselves began. This is a common mistake. Had\nchildren today to learn in the same school in which their fathers\nlearned, they would become as useful as they. The fathers have [390]\naltered the circumstances of their children. Poverty was the father\u2019s\nmaster; abundance of means surrounds the son. All his wants are\nsupplied. His father\u2019s character was molded under the severe dis-\n308 The Adventist Home\ncipline of frugality; every trifling good was appreciated. His son\u2019s\nhabits and character will be formed, not by the circumstances which\nonce existed, but by the present situation\u2014ease and indulgence....\nWhen luxury abounds on every side, how can it be denied him?13\nParents\u2019 Best Legacy to Children \u2014The very best legacy\nwhich parents can leave their children is a knowledge of useful\nlabor and the example of a life characterized by disinterested benev-\nolence. By such a life they show the true value of money, that it is\nonly to be appreciated for the good that it will accomplish in reliev-\ning their own wants and the necessities of others, and in advancing\nthe cause of God.14\n1The Review and Herald, November 13, 1894.\n2Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 168, 169.\n3Testimonies for the Church 6:214, 215.\n4Manuscript 2, 1903.\n5Letter 11, 1888.\n6Letter 50, 1895.\n7Letter 103, 1900.\n8Letter 356, 1907.\n9The Youth\u2019s Instructor, November 1, 1904.\n10The Review and Herald, December 25, 1900.\n11Manuscript 128, 1901.\n12The Review and Herald, November 10, 1896.\n13Manuscript 58, 1899.\n14Testimonies for the Church 3:399.\nChapter 64\u2014Business Integrity [391]\nThe Bible a Source Book of Business Principles\u2014There is no\nbranch of legitimate business for which the Bible does not afford an\nessential preparation. Its principles of diligence, honesty, thrift, tem-\nperance, and purity are the secret of true success. These principles,\nas set forth in the Book of Proverbs, constitute a treasury of practical\nwisdom. Where can the merchant, the artisan, the director of men\nin any department of business, find better maxims for himself or for\nhis employees than are found in these words of the wise man:\n\u201cSeest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before\nkings; he shall not stand before mean men.\u201d\n\u201cIn all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only\nto penury.\u201d\n\u201cThe soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing.\u201d\n\u201cThe drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsi-\nness shall clothe a man with rags.\u201d ...\nHow many a man might have escaped financial failure and ruin\nby heeding the warnings so often repeated and emphasized in the\nScriptures:\n\u201cHe that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.\u201d\n\u201cWealth gotten in haste shall be diminished; but he that gathereth\nby labor shall have increase.\u201d\n\u201cThe getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to\nand fro of them that seek death.\u201d\n\u201cThe borrower is servant to the lender.\u201d\n\u201cHe that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that\nhateth suretiship is sure.\u201d1\nThe eighth commandment condemns ... theft and robbery. It [392]\ndemands strict integrity in the minutest details of the affairs of life.\nIt forbids overreaching in trade and requires the payment of just\ndebts or wages.\u201d2\nMind and Character Degraded by Dishonesty\u2014He [one who\nutters falsehood or practices deception] loses his own self-respect.\n309\n310 The Adventist Home\nHe may not be conscious that God sees him and is acquainted with\nevery business transaction, that holy angels are weighing his motives\nand listening to his words, and that his reward will be according to\nhis works; but if it were possible to conceal his wrongdoing from\nhuman and divine inspection, the fact that he himself knows it is\ndegrading to his mind and character. One act does not determine the\ncharacter, but it breaks down the barrier, and the next temptation is\nmore readily entertained, until finally a habit of prevarication and\ndishonesty in business is formed, and the man cannot be trusted.3\nAs we deal with our fellow men in petty dishonesty or in more\ndaring fraud, so will we deal with God. Men who persist in a course\nof dishonesty will carry out their principles until they cheat their\nown souls and lose heaven and eternal life. They will sacrifice honor\nand religion for a small worldly advantage.4\nShun Debt\u2014Many poor families are poor because they spend\ntheir money as soon as they receive it.5\nYou must see that one should not manage his affairs in a way\nthat will incur debt.... When one becomes involved in debt, he is in\none of Satan\u2019s nets, which he sets for souls....\nAbstracting and using money for any purpose, before it is earned,\nis a snare.6\nWords to One Who Lived Beyond His Income \u2014You ought[393]\nnot to allow yourself to become financially embarrassed, for the\nfact that you are in debt weakens your faith and tends to discourage\nyou; and even the thought of it makes you nearly wild. You need\nto cut down your expenses and strive to supply this deficiency in\nyour character. You can and should make determined efforts to bring\nunder control your disposition to spend means beyond your income.7\nThe Cause of God May Be Reproached \u2014The world has a\nright to expect strict integrity in those who profess to be Bible\nChristians. By one man\u2019s indifference in regard to paying his just\ndues all our people are in danger of being regarded as unreliable.8\nThose who make any pretensions to godliness should adorn\nthe doctrine they profess, and not give occasion for the truth to be\nreviled through their inconsiderate course of action. \u201cOwe no man\nany thing,\u201d says the apostle.9\nCounsel to One in Debt\u2014Be determined never to incur another\ndebt. Deny yourself a thousand things rather than run in debt. This\nBusiness Integrity 311\nhas been the curse of your life, getting into debt. Avoid it as you\nwould the smallpox.\nMake a solemn covenant with God that by His blessing you will\npay your debts and then owe no man anything if you live on porridge\nand bread. It is so easy in preparing your table to throw out of your\npocket twenty-five cents for extras. Take care of the pennies, and\nthe dollars will take care of themselves. It is the mites here and the\nmites there that are spent for this, that, and the other that soon run up\ninto dollars. Deny self at least while you are walled in with debts....\nDo not falter, be discouraged, or turn back. Deny your taste, deny\nthe indulgence of appetite, save your pence, and pay your debts. [394]\nWork them off as fast as possible. When you can stand forth a free\nman again, owing no man anything, you will have achieved a great\nvictory.10\nShow Consideration for Unfortunate Debtors \u2014If some are\nfound to be in debt and really unable to meet their obligations, they\nshould not be pressed to do that which is beyond their power. They\nshould be given a favorable chance to discharge their indebtedness,\nand not be placed in a position where they are utterly unable to free\nthemselves from debt. Though such a course might be considered\njustice, it is not mercy and the love of God.11\nDanger in Extreme Positions \u2014Some are not discreet and\nwould incur debts that might be avoided. Others exercise a cau-\ntion that savors of unbelief. By taking advantage of circumstances\nwe may at times invest means to such advantage that the work of\nGod will be strengthened and upbuilt, and yet keep strictly to right\nprinciples.12\n1Education, 135, 136.\n2Patriarchs and Prophets, 309.\n3Testimonies for the Church 5:396.\n4The Review and Herald, September 18, 1888.\n5Counsels on Stewardship, 269.\n6Letter 63, 1897.\n7Letter 48, 1888.\n8Testimonies for the Church 5:179.\n9Ibid., 5:181, 182.\n10Counsels on Stewardship, 257.\n11Manuscript 46, 1900.\n12Manuscript 20, 1891.\nChapter 65\u2014Provision for the Future[395]\nHome Ownership and Savings Versus Spendthrift Habits\u2014\nBrother and Sister B have not learned the lesson of economy.... They\nwould use all as they pass along, were it ever so much. They would\nenjoy as they go and then, when affliction draws upon them, would\nbe wholly unprepared.... Had Brother and Sister B been economical\nmanagers, denying themselves, they could ere this have had a home\nof their own and besides this have had means to draw upon in case\nof adversity. But they will not economize as others have done, upon\nwhom they have sometimes been dependent. If they neglect to learn\nthese lessons, their characters will not be found perfect in the day of\nGod.1\nThis Counsel May Help You \u2014You have been in a business\nwhich would at times yield you large profits at once. After you have\nearned means, you have not studied to economize in reference to a\ntime when means could not be earned so easily, but have expended\nmuch for imaginary wants. Had you and your wife understood it to\nbe a duty that God enjoined upon you to deny your taste and your\ndesires and make provision for the future instead of living merely for\nthe present, you could now have had a competency and your family\nhave had the comforts of life. You have a lesson to learn.... It is to\nmake a little go the longest way.2\nTo a Family That Should Save Systematically \u2014You might\ntoday have had a capital of means to use in case of emergency and to\naid the cause of God, if you had economized as you should. Every[396]\nweek a portion of your wages should be reserved and in no case\ntouched unless suffering actual want, or to render back to the Giver\nin offerings to God....\nThe means you have earned has not been wisely and economi-\ncally expended so as to leave a margin should you be sick and your\nfamily deprived of the means you bring to sustain them. Your family\nshould have something to rely upon if you should be brought into\nstraitened places.3\n312\nProvision for the Future 313\nAnother Family Advised Concerning a Savings Account \u2014\nEvery week you should lay by in some secure place five or ten\ndollars not to be used up unless in case of sickness. With economy\nyou may place something at interest. With wise management you\ncan save something after paying your debts.4\nI have known a family receiving twenty dollars a week to spend\nevery penny of this amount, while another family of the same size,\nreceiving but twelve dollars a week, laid aside one or two dollars\na week, managing to do this by refraining from purchasing things\nwhich seemed to be necessary but which could be dispensed with.5\nMake Property Secure by Proper Will\u2014Those who are faith-\nful stewards of the Lord\u2019s means will know just how their business\nstands, and, like wise men, they will be prepared for any emergency.\nShould their probation close suddenly, they would not leave such\ngreat perplexity upon those who are called to settle their estate.\nMany are not exercised upon the subject of making their wills\nwhile they are in apparent health. But this precaution should be\ntaken by our brethren. They should know their financial standing\nand should not allow their business to become entangled. They [397]\nshould arrange their property in such a manner that they may leave\nit at any time.\nWills should be made in a manner to stand the test of law. Af-\nter they are drawn, they may remain for years and do no harm, if\ndonations continue to be made from time to time as the cause has\nneed. Death will not come one day sooner, brethren, because you\nhave made your will. In disposing of your property by will to your\nrelatives, be sure that you do not forget God\u2019s cause. You are His\nagents, holding His property; and His claims should have your first\nconsideration. Your wife and children, of course, should not be left\ndestitute; provision should be made for them if they are needy. But\ndo not, simply because it is customary, bring into your will a long\nline of relatives who are not needy.6\nRemember God\u2019s Cause While Living\u2014Let no one think that\nhe will meet the mind of Christ in hoarding up property through\nlife and then at death making a bequest of a portion of it to some\nbenevolent cause.7\nSome selfishly retain their means during their lifetime, trusting\nto make up for their neglect by remembering the cause in their wills.\n314 The Adventist Home\nBut not half the means thus bestowed in legacies ever benefits the\nobject specified. Brethren and sisters, invest in the bank of heaven\nyourselves, and do not leave your stewardship upon another.8\nStewardship Transferred to Children Is Often Unwise\u2014Par-\nents should have great fear in entrusting children with the talents of\nmeans that God has placed in their hands, unless they have the surest\nevidence that their children have greater interest in, love for, and\ndevotion to the cause of God than they themselves possess, and that[398]\nthese children will be more earnest and zealous in forwarding the\nwork of God and more benevolent in carrying forward the various\nenterprises connected with in which call for means. But many place\ntheir means in the hands of their children, thus throwing upon them\nthe responsibility of their own stewardship because Satan prompts\nthem to do it. In so doing they effectually place that means in the\nenemy\u2019s ranks. Satan works the matter to suit his own purpose and\nkeeps from the cause of God the means which it needs, that it may\nbe abundantly sustained.9\nThe Curse of Hoarded Wealth\u2014Those who acquire wealth for\nthe purpose of hoarding it leave the curse of wealth to their children.\nIt is a sin, an awful, soul-periling sin for fathers and mothers to\ndo this, and this sin extends to their posterity. Often the children\nspend their means in foolish extravagance, in riotous living, so that\nthey become beggars. They know not the value of the inheritance\nthey have squandered. Had their fathers and mothers set them a\nproper example, not in hoarding but in imparting their wealth, they\nwould have laid up for themselves treasure in heaven and received a\nreturn even in this world of peace and happiness and in the future\nlife eternal riches.10\n1Testimonies for the Church 3:30, 31.\n2Testimonies for the Church 2:432, 433.\n3Letter 5, 1877.\n4Uncopied Letter 49, 1884.\n5Letter 156, 1901.\n6Testimonies for the Church 4:482.\n7The Review and Herald, February 27, 1894.\n8The Review and Herald, October 12, 1886.\n9Testimonies for the Church 2:655.\n10Letter 20, 1897.\nSection 14\u2014Guarding the Avenues of the [399]\nSoul\nChapter 66\u2014The Portals We Must Watch[400]\n[401]\nWhy God Gave Us Eyes, Ears, and Speech \u2014God gave men\neyes, that they might behold wondrous things out of His law. He\ngave them the hearing ear, that they might listen to His message,\nspoken by the living preacher. He gave men the talent of speech,\nthat they might present Christ as the sin-pardoning Saviour. With\nthe heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth\nconfession is made unto salvation.1\nHow Satan Gains Entrance to the Soul\u2014All should guard the\nsenses, lest Satan gain victory over them; for these are the avenues\nof the soul.2\nYou will have to become a faithful sentinel over your eyes, ears,\nand all your senses if you would control your mind and prevent vain\nand corrupt thoughts from staining your soul. The power of grace\nalone can accomplish this most desirable work.3\nSatan and his angels are busy creating a paralyzed condition\nof the senses so that cautions, warnings, and reproofs shall not be\nheard; or, if heard, that they shall not take effect upon the heart and\nreform the life.4\nMy brethren, God calls upon you as His followers to walk in\nthe light. You need to be alarmed. Sin is among us, and it is not\nseen to be exceedingly sinful. The senses of many are benumbed by\nthe indulgence of appetite and by familiarity with sin. We need to\nadvance nearer heaven.5\nSatan\u2019s Strategy Is to Confuse the Senses\u2014Satan\u2019s work is to\nlead men to ignore God, to so engross and absorb the mind that God[402]\nwill not be in their thoughts. The education they have received has\nbeen of a character to confuse the mind and eclipse the true light.\nSatan does not wish the people to have a knowledge of God; and if\nhe can set in operation games and theatrical performances that will\nso confuse the senses of the young that human beings will perish in\ndarkness while light shines all about them, he is well pleased.6\n316\nPortals We Must Watch 317\nSatan Cannot Enter the Mind Without Our Consent \u2014We\nshould present before the people the fact that God has provided that\nwe shall not be tempted above what we are able to bear, but that\nwith every temptation He will make a way of escape. If we live\nwholly for God, we shall not allow the mind to indulge in selfish\nimaginings.\nIf there is any way by which Satan can gain access to the mind,\nhe will sow his tares and cause them to grow until they will yield\nan abundant harvest. In no case can Satan obtain dominion over the\nthoughts, words, and actions, unless we voluntarily open the door\nand invite him to enter. He will then come in and, by catching away\nthe good seed sown in the heart, make of none effect the truth.7\nClose Every Avenue to the Tempter\u2014All who name the name\nof Christ need to watch and pray and guard the avenues of the soul,\nfor Satan is at work to corrupt and destroy if the least advantage is\ngiven him.8\nIt is not safe for us to linger to contemplate the advantages to be\nreaped through yielding to Satan\u2019s suggestions. Sin means dishonor\nand disaster to every soul that indulges in it; but it is blinding and\ndeceiving in its nature, and it will entice us with flattering presen-\ntations. If we venture on Satan\u2019s ground, we have no assurance of [403]\nprotection from his power. So far as in us lies, we should close every\navenue by which the tempter may find access to us.9\nWho can know, in the moment of temptation, the terrible con-\nsequences which will result from one wrong, hasty step! Our only\nsafety is to be shielded by the grace of God every moment, and not\nput out our own spiritual eyesight so that we will call evil, good, and\ngood, evil. Without hesitation or argument we must close and guard\nthe avenues of the soul against evil.10\nEvery Christian must stand on guard continually, watching every\navenue of the soul where Satan might find access. He must pray for\ndivine help and at the same time resolutely resist every inclination\nto sin. By courage, by faith, by persevering toil, he can conquer. But\nlet him remember that to gain the victory Christ must abide in him\nand he in Christ.11\nAvoid Reading, Seeing, or Hearing Evil\u2014The apostle [Peter]\nsought to teach the believers how important it is to keep the mind\nfrom wandering to forbidden themes or from spending its energies\n318 The Adventist Home\non trifling subjects. Those who would not fall a prey to Satan\u2019s\ndevices must guard well the avenues of the soul; they must avoid\nreading, seeing, or hearing that which will suggest impure thoughts.\nThe mind must not be left to dwell at random upon every subject\nthat the enemy of souls may suggest. The heart must be faithfully\nsentineled, or evils without will awaken evils within, and the soul\nwill wander in darkness.12\nEverything that can be done should be done to place ourselves\nand our children where we shall not see the iniquity that is practiced\nin the world. We should carefully guard the sight of our eyes and[404]\nthe hearing of our ears so that these awful things shall not enter our\nminds. When the daily newspaper comes into the house, I feel as if I\nwant to hide it, that the ridiculous, sensational things in it may not be\nseen. It seems as if the enemy is at the foundation of the publishing\nof many things that appear in newspapers. Every sinful thing that\ncan be found is uncovered and laid bare before the world.13\nThose who would have that wisdom which is from God must\nbecome fools in the sinful knowledge of this age, in order to be wise.\nThey should shut their eyes, that they may see and learn no evil.\nThey should close their ears, lest they hear that which is evil and\nobtain that knowledge which would stain their purity of thoughts\nand acts. And they should guard their tongues, lest they utter corrupt\ncommunications and guile be found in their mouths.14\nResistance Is Weakened by Opening the Door \u2014Do not see\nhow close you can walk upon the brink of a precipice and be safe.\nAvoid the first approach to danger. The soul\u2019s interests cannot be\ntrifled with. Your capital is your character. Cherish it as you would\na golden treasure. Moral purity, self-respect, a strong power of resis-\ntance, must be firmly and constantly cherished. There should not be\none departure from reserve; one act of familiarity, one indiscretion,\nmay jeopardize the soul in opening the door to temptation, and the\npower of resistance becomes weakened.15\nSatan Would Eclipse the Future Glories\u2014Satan has worked\ncontinually to eclipse the glories of the future world and to attract\nthe whole attention to the things of this life. He has striven so to\narrange matters that our thought, our anxiety, our labor might be so[405]\nfully employed in temporal things that we should not see or realize\nthe value of eternal realities. The world and its cares have too large\nPortals We Must Watch 319\na place, while Jesus and heavenly things have altogether too small\na share in our thoughts and affections. We should conscientiously\ndischarge all the duties of everyday life, but it is also essential that\nwe should cultivate, above everything else, holy affection for our\nLord Jesus Christ.16\nHeavenly Angels Will Help Us\u2014We should ever keep in mind\nthat unseen agencies are at work, both evil and good, to take the\ncontrol of the mind. They act with unseen yet effectual power. Good\nangels are ministering spirits, exerting a heavenly influence upon\nheart and mind; while the great adversary of souls, the devil, and his\nangels are continually laboring to accomplish our destruction....\nWhile we should be keenly alive to our exposure to the assaults\nof unseen and invisible foes, we are to be sure that they cannot harm\nus without gaining our consent.17\n1Letter 21, 1899.\n2Testimonies for the Church 3:507.\n3Testimonies for the Church 2:561.\n4Ibid., 5:493.\n5Ibid., 3:476.\n6The Review and Herald, March 13, 1900.\n7The Review and Herald, July 11, 1893.\n8Testimonies for the Church 3:476.\n9Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, 118.\n10Testimonies for the Church 3:324.\n11Ibid., 5:47.\n12The Acts of the Apostols, 518, 519.\n13Notebook Leaflets from the Elmshaven Library, Education, V olume 1 (1845).\n14A Solemn Appeal, 76.\n15Medical Ministry, 143.\n16The Review and Herald, January 7, 1890.\n17The Review and Herald, July 19, 1887.\nChapter 67\u2014Enticing Sights and Sounds[406]\nEvil Sights and Sounds All About Us \u2014There is reason for\ndeep solicitude on your part for your children, who have temptations\nto encounter at every advance step. It is impossible for them to avoid\ncontact with evil associates.... They will see sights, hear sounds, and\nbe subjected to influences which are demoralizing and which, unless\nthey are thoroughly guarded, will imperceptibly but surely corrupt\nthe heart and deform the character.1\nAll Need a Bulwark Against Temptation\u2014In Christian homes\na bulwark should be built against temptation. Satan is using every\nmeans to make crime and degrading vice popular. We cannot walk\nthe streets of our cities without encountering flaring notices of crime\npresented in some novel or to be acted at some theater. The mind\nis educated to familiarity with sin. The course pursued by the base\nand vile is kept before the people in the periodicals of the day, and\neverything that can arouse passion is brought before them in exciting\nstories.2\nSome fathers and mothers are so indifferent, so careless, that\nthey think it makes no difference whether their children attend a\nchurch school or a public school. \u201cWe are in the world,\u201d they say,\n\u201cand we cannot get out of it.\u201d But, parents, we can get a good way\nout of the world, if we choose to do so. We can avoid seeing many\nof the evils that are multiplying so fast in these last days. We can\navoid hearing about much of the wickedness and crime that exist.3\nSow Lawlessness, Reap a Harvest of Crime \u2014Many of the[407]\npopular publications of the day are filled with sensational stories\nthat are educating the youth in wickedness and leading them in the\npath to perdition. Mere children in years are old in a knowledge of\ncrime. They are incited to evil by the tales they read. In imagination\nthey act over the deeds portrayed, until their ambition is aroused to\nsee what they can do in committing crime and evading punishment.\nTo the active minds of children and youth the scenes pictured\nin imaginary revelations of the future are realities. As revolutions\n320\nEnticing Sights and Sounds 321\nare predicted and all manner of proceedings described that break\ndown the barriers of law and self-restraint, many catch the spirit of\nthese representations. They are led to the commission of crimes even\nworse, if possible, than these sensational writers depict. Through\nsuch influences as these society is becoming demoralized. The seeds\nof lawlessness are sown broadcast. None need marvel that a harvest\nof crime is the result.4\nThe Lure of Popular Music \u2014I feel alarmed as I witness ev-\nerywhere the frivolity of young men and young women who profess\nto believe the truth. God does not seem to be in their thoughts. Their\nminds are filled with nonsense. Their conversation is only empty,\nvain talk. They have a keen ear for music, and Satan knows what\norgans to excite to animate, engross, and charm the mind so that\nChrist is not desired. The spiritual longings of the soul for divine\nknowledge, for a growth in grace, are wanting.\nI was shown that the youth must take a higher stand and make\nthe word of God the man of their counsel and their guide. Solemn\nresponsibilities rest upon the young, which they lightly regard. The [408]\nintroduction of music into their homes, instead of inciting to holiness\nand spirituality, has been the means of diverting their minds from the\ntruth. Frivolous songs and the popular sheet music of the day seem\ncongenial to their taste. The instruments of music have taken time\nwhich should have been devoted to prayer. Music, when not abused,\nis a great blessing; but when put to a wrong use, it is a terrible\ncurse. It excites, but does not impart that strength and courage which\nthe Christian can find only at the throne of grace while humbly\nmaking known his wants and, with strong cries and tears, pleading\nfor heavenly strength to be fortified against the powerful temptations\nof the evil one. Satan is leading the young captive. Oh, what can I\nsay to lead them to break his power of infatuation! He is a skillful\ncharmer luring them on to perdition.5\nImpure Thoughts Lead to Impure Actions \u2014This is an age\nwhen corruption is teeming everywhere. The lust of the eye and\ncorrupt passions are aroused by beholding and by reading. The heart\nis corrupted through the imagination. The mind takes pleasure in\ncontemplating scenes which awaken the lower and baser passions.\nThese vile images, seen through defiled imagination, corrupt the\nmorals and prepare the deluded, infatuated beings to give loose rein\n322 The Adventist Home\nto lustful passions. Then follow sins and crimes which drag beings\nformed in the image of God down to a level with the beasts, sinking\nthem at last in perdition.6\nI Will See No Wicked Thing\u2014Parents must exercise unceasing\nwatchfulness, that their children be not lost to God. The vows of\nDavid, recorded in the 101st Psalm, should be the vows of all upon[409]\nwhom rest the responsibilities of guarding the influences of the home.\nThe psalmist declares: \u201cI will set no wicked thing before mine eyes:\nI hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me. A\nfroward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.\nWhoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that\nhath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. Mine eyes shall\nbe upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he\nthat walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. He that worketh\ndeceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not\ntarry in my sight.\u201d7\nSay firmly: \u201cI will not spend precious moments in reading that\nwhich will be of no profit to me, and which only unfits me to be of\nservice to others. I will devote my time and my thoughts to acquiring\na fitness for God\u2019s service. I will close my eyes to frivolous and\nsinful things. My ears are the Lord\u2019s, and I will not listen to the\nsubtle reasoning of the enemy. My voice shall not in any way be\nsubject to a will that is not under the influence of the Spirit of God.\nMy body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and every power of my\nbeing shall be consecrated to worthy pursuits.\u201d8\n1Pacific Health Journal, June, 1890.\n2Bible Echo, October 15, 1894, par.4.\n3Notebook Leaflets from the Elmshaven Library, Education, V olume 1 (1845).\n4The Ministry of Healing, 444, 445.\n5Testimonies for the Church 1:496, 497.\n6Testimonies for the Church 2:410.\n7Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 119.\n8Testimonies for the Church 7:64.\nChapter 68\u2014Reading and its Influence [410]\nFeed the Child\u2019s Mind With Proper Food\u2014The susceptible,\nexpanding mind of the child longs for knowledge. Parents should\nkeep themselves well informed, that they may give the minds of their\nchildren proper food. Like the body, the mind derives its strength\nfrom the food it receives. It is broadened and elevated by pure,\nstrengthening thoughts; but it is narrowed and debased by thoughts\nthat are of the earth earthy.\nParents, you are the ones to decide whether the minds of your\nchildren shall be filled with ennobling thoughts or with vicious\nsentiments. You cannot keep their active minds unoccupied; neither\ncan you frown away evil. Only by the inculcation of right principles\ncan you exclude wrong thoughts. Unless parents plant the seeds of\ntruth in the hearts of their children, the enemy will sow tares. Good,\nsound instruction is the only preventive of the evil communications\nthat corrupt good manners. Truth will protect the soul from the\nendless temptations that must be encountered.1\nParents to Control Reading Habits \u2014Many youth are eager\nfor books. They read anything that they can obtain. I appeal to the\nparents of such children to control their desire for reading. Do not\npermit upon your tables the magazines and newspapers in which are\nfound love stories. Supply their place with books that will help the\nyouth to put into their character-building the very best material\u2014the\nlove and fear of God, the knowledge of Christ. Encourage your\nchildren to store the mind with valuable knowledge, to let that which\nis good occupy the soul and control its powers, leaving no place for [411]\nlow, debasing thoughts. Restrict the desire for reading matter that\ndoes not furnish good food for the mind.2\nParents should endeavor to keep out of the home every influence\nthat is not productive of good. In this matter some parents have\nmuch to learn. To those who feel free to read story magazines and\nnovels I would say: You are sowing seed the harvest of which you\nwill not care to garner. From such reading there is no spiritual\n323\n324 The Adventist Home\nstrength to be gained. Rather it destroys love for the pure truth of the\nword. Through the agency of novels and story magazines, Satan is\nworking to fill with unreal and trivial thoughts minds that should be\ndiligently studying the word of God. Thus he is robbing thousands\nupon thousands of the time and energy and self-discipline demanded\nby the stern problems of life.3\nChildren need proper reading which will afford amusement and\nrecreation and not demoralize the mind or weary the body. If they are\ntaught to love romance and newspaper tales, instructive books and\npapers will become distasteful to them. Most children and young\npeople will have reading matter; and if it is not selected for them,\nthey will select it for themselves. They can find a ruinous quality\nof reading anywhere, and they soon learn to love it; but if pure and\ngood reading is furnished them, they will cultivate a taste for that.4\nDiscipline and Educate Mental Tastes \u2014The mental tastes\nmust be disciplined and educated with the greatest care. Parents\nmust begin early to unfold the Scriptures to the expanding minds of\ntheir children, that proper habits of thought may be formed.\nNo effort should be spared to establish right habits of study. If\nthe mind wanders, bring it back. If the intellectual and moral tastes[412]\nhave been perverted by over-wrought and exciting tales of fiction\nso that there is a disinclination to apply the mind, there is a battle\nto be fought to overcome this habit. A love for fictitious reading\nshould be overcome at once. Rigid rules should be enforced to hold\nthe mind in the proper channel.5\nAvoid Cultivating Taste for Fiction\u2014What shall our children\nread? This is a serious question and one that demands a serious\nanswer. It troubles me to see in Sabbathkeeping families periodicals\nand newspapers containing continued stories which leave no impres-\nsions for good on the minds of children and youth. I have watched\nthose whose taste for fiction was thus cultivated. They have had the\nprivilege of listening to the truth, of becoming acquainted with the\nreasons of our faith; but they have grown to maturer years destitute\nof true piety and practical godliness.6\nThe readers of fiction are indulging an evil that destroys spiritu-\nality, eclipsing the beauty of the sacred page.7\nPrevalence of Harmful Books \u2014The world is deluged with\nbooks that might better be consumed than circulated. Books on\nReading and its Influence 325\nsensational topics, published and circulated as a money-making\nscheme, might better never be read by the youth. There is a satanic\nfascination in such books....\nThe practice of story reading is one of the means employed by\nSatan to destroy souls. It produces a false, unhealthy excitement,\nfevers the imagination, unfits the mind for usefulness, and disquali-\nfies it for any spiritual exercise. It weans the soul from prayer and\nfrom the love of spiritual things.8\nWorks of romance, frivolous, exciting tales, are, in hardly less [413]\ndegree, a curse to the reader. The author may profess to teach a\nmoral lesson; throughout his work he may interweave religious sen-\ntiments, but often these serve only to veil the folly and worthlessness\nbeneath.9\nInfidel Authors\u2014Another source of danger against which we\nshould be constantly on guard is the reading of infidel authors. Such\nworks are inspired by the enemy of truth, and no one can read them\nwithout imperiling the soul. It is true that some who are affected by\nthem may finally recover; but all who tamper with their evil influence\nplace themselves on Satan\u2019s ground, and he makes the most of his\nadvantage. As they invite his temptations, they have not wisdom to\ndiscern or strength to resist them. With a fascinating, bewitching\npower unbelief and infidelity fasten themselves upon the mind.10\nMyths and Fairy Tales\u2014In the education of children and youth\nfairy tales, myths, and fictitious stories are now given a large place.\nBooks of this character are used in schools, and they are to be found\nin many homes. How can Christian parents permit their children\nto use books so filled with falsehood? When the children ask the\nmeaning of stories so contrary to the teaching of their parents, the\nanswer is that the stories are not true; but this does not do away\nwith the evil results of their use. The ideas presented in these books\nmislead the children. They impart false views of life and beget and\nfoster a desire for the unreal....\nNever should books containing a perversion of truth be placed\nin the hands of children or youth. Let not our children, in the very\nprocess of obtaining an education, receive ideas that will prove to\nbe seeds of sin.11\nHow Mental Vigor Is Destroyed\u2014There are few well-balanced [414]\nminds because parents are wickedly negligent of their duty to stimu-\n326 The Adventist Home\nlate weak traits and repress wrong ones. They do not remember that\nthey are under the most solemn obligation to watch the tendencies\nof each child, that it is their duty to train their children to right habits\nand right ways of thinking.12\nCultivate the moral and intellectual powers. Let not these noble\npowers become enfeebled and perverted by much reading of even\nstorybooks. I know of strong minds that have been unbalanced and\npartially benumbed, or paralyzed, by intemperance in reading.13\nExciting Reading Makes Restless, Dreamy Child \u2014Readers\nof frivolous, exciting tales become unfitted for the duties of practical\nlife. They live in an unreal world. I have watched children who have\nbeen allowed to make a practice of reading such stories. Whether\nat home or abroad, they were restless, dreamy, unable to converse\nexcept upon the most commonplace subjects. Religious thought and\nconversation was entirely foreign to their minds. With the cultivation\nof an appetite for sensational stories the mental taste is perverted,\nand the mind is not satisfied unless fed upon this unwholesome food.\nI can think of no more fitting name for those who indulge in such\nreading than mental inebriates. Intemperate habits of reading have\nan effect upon the brain similar to that which intemperate habits of\neating and drinking have upon the body.14\nBefore accepting the present truth, some had formed the habit of\nnovel reading. Upon uniting with the church, they made an effort\nto overcome this habit. To place before this class reading similar\nto that which they have discarded is like offering intoxicants to the\ninebriate. Yielding to the temptation continually before them, they[415]\nsoon lose their relish for solid reading. They have no interest in\nBible study. Their moral power becomes enfeebled. Sin appears less\nand less repulsive. There is manifest an increasing unfaithfulness,\na growing distaste for life\u2019s practical duties. As the mind becomes\nperverted, it is ready to grasp any reading of a stimulating character.\nThus the way is open for Satan to bring the soul fully under his\ndomination.15\nHasty, Superficial Reading Weakens Power of Concentra-\ntion\u2014With the immense tide of printed matter constantly pouring\nfrom the press, old and young form the habit of reading hastily and\nsuperficially, and the mind loses its power of connected and vig-\norous thought. Furthermore, a large share of the periodicals and\nReading and its Influence 327\nbooks that, like the frogs of Egypt, are overspreading the land are\nnot merely commonplace, idle, and enervating, but unclean and de-\ngrading. Their effect is not merely to intoxicate and ruin the mind,\nbut to corrupt and destroy the soul.16\n\u201cI Cannot Afford Our Church Papers.\u201d \u2014There are those\nwho profess to be brethren who do not take the Review, Signs, In-\nstructor, or Good Health, but take one or more secular papers. Their\nchildren are deeply interested in reading the fictitious tales and love\nstories which are found in these papers, and which their father can\nafford to pay for, although claiming that he cannot afford to pay for\nour periodicals and publications on present truth....\nParents should guard their children and teach them to cultivate\na pure imagination and to shun, as they would a leper, the lovesick\npen pictures presented in newspapers. Let publications upon moral [416]\nand religious subjects be found on your tables and in your libraries,\nthat your children may cultivate a taste for elevated reading.17\nMessages to Youth on Objectives in Reading \u2014As I see the\ndanger that threatens the youth from improper reading, I cannot\nforbear to present still further the warnings given me in regard to\nthis great evil.\nThe harm that results to the workers from handling matter of\nan objectionable character is too little realized. Their attention is\narrested and their interest aroused by the subject matter with which\nthey are dealing. Sentences are imprinted in the memory. Thoughts\nare suggested. Almost unconsciously the reader is influenced by the\nspirit of the writer, and mind and character receive an impress for\nevil. There are some who have little faith and little power of self-\ncontrol, and it is difficult for them to banish the thoughts suggested\nby such literature.18\nOh, that the young would reflect upon the influence which excit-\ning stories have upon the mind! Can you, after such reading, open\nthe word of God and read the words of life with interest? Do you not\nfind the book of God uninteresting? The charm of that love story is\nupon the mind, destroying its healthy tone and making it impossible\nfor you to fix your mind upon the important, solemn truths which\nconcern your eternal interest. You sin against your parents in de-\nvoting to such a poor purpose the time which belongs to them, and\n328 The Adventist Home\nyou sin against God in thus using the time which should be spent in\ndevotion to Him.19\nChildren, I have a message for you. You are now deciding your\nfuture destiny, and your character building is of that kind which will\nexclude you from the Paradise of God.... How sad it is for Jesus, the\nworld\u2019s Redeemer, to look upon a family where the children have no[417]\nlove for God, no respect for the word of God, but are all absorbed\nin reading storybooks. The time occupied in this way robs you of a\ndesire to become effective in household duties; it disqualifies you\nto stand at the head of a family, and if continued it will entangle\nyou more and more closely in Satan\u2019s snare.... Some of the books\nyou read contain excellent principles, but you read only to get the\nstory. If you would gather from the books you read that which\nwould help you in the formation of your character, your reading\nwould do you some good. But as you take up your books and peruse\npage after page of them, do you ask yourself, What is my object in\nreading? Am I seeking to gain substantial knowledge? You cannot\nbuild a right character by bringing to the foundation wood, hay, and\nstubble.20\nSow in the Mind Seeds of Bible Truth\u2014Between an unculti-\nvated field and an untrained mind there is a striking similarity. In\nthe minds of children and youth the enemy sows tares, and unless\nparents keep watchful guard, these will spring up to bear their evil\nfruit. Unceasing care is needed in cultivating the soil of the mind and\nsowing it with the precious seed of Bible truth. Children should be\ntaught to reject trashy, exciting tales and to turn to sensible reading,\nwhich will lead the mind to take an interest in Bible story, history,\nand argument. Reading that will throw light upon the Sacred V olume\nand quicken the desire to study it is not dangerous, but beneficial.21\nIt is impossible for the youth to possess a healthy tone of mind\nand correct religious principles unless they enjoy the perusal of the\nword of God. This book contains the most interesting history, points\nout the way of salvation through Christ, and is their guide to a higher[418]\nand better life.22\n1Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 121.\n2Ibid., 133.\n3Ibid., 120, 121.\n4The Review and Herald, December 11, 1879.\nReading and its Influence 329\n5Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 136.\n6Ibid., 132.\n7The Youth\u2019s Instructor, October 9, 1902.\n8Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 133, 134.\n9The Ministry of Healing, 445.\n10Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 135, 136.\n11Ibid., 384, 385.\n12The Review and Herald, November 12, 1908.\n13Testimonies for the Church 2:410.\n14Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 134, 135.\n15Testimonies for the Church 7:203.\n16Education, 189, 190.\n17The Review and Herald, December 11, 1879.\n18Testimonies for the Church 7:203.\n19Testimonies for the Church 2:236.\n20Letter 32, 1896.\n21Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 136, 137.\n22Testimonies for the Church 2:410, 411.\n330 The Adventist Home\nSection 15\u2014Graces that Brighten Family [419]\nLife\nChapter 69\u2014Courtesy and Kindness[420]\n[421]\nCourtesy Will Banish Half Life\u2019s Ills \u2014The principle incul-\ncated by the injunction, \u201cBe kindly affectioned one to another,\u201d lies\nat the very foundation of domestic happiness. Christian courtesy\nshould reign in every household. It is cheap, but it has power to\nsoften natures which would grow hard and rough without it. The\ncultivation of a uniform courtesy, a willingness to do by others as\nwe would like them to do by us, would banish half the ills of life.1\nCourtesy Begins in the Home\u2014If we would have our children\npractice kindness, courtesy, and love, we ourselves must set them\nthe example.2\nCourtesy, even in little things, should be manifested by the par-\nents toward each other. Universal kindness should be the law of the\nhouse. No rude language should be indulged; no bitter words should\nbe spoken.3\nAll may possess a cheerful countenance, a gentle voice, a courte-\nous manner; and these are elements of power. Children are attracted\nby a cheerful, sunny demeanor. Show them kindness and courtesy,\nand they will manifest the same spirit toward you and toward one\nanother.4\nYour courtesy and self-control will have greater influence upon\nthe characters of your children than mere words could have.5\nMutual Kindness Makes Home a Paradise \u2014By speaking\nkindly to their children and praising them when they try to do right,\nparents may encourage their efforts, make them very happy, and\nthrow around the family circle a charm which will chase away very[422]\ndark shadow and bring cheerful sunlight in. Mutual kindness and\nforbearance will make home a Paradise and attract holy angels into\nthe family circle; but they will flee from a house where there are\nunpleasant words, fretfulness, and strife. Unkindness, complaining,\nand anger shut Jesus from the dwelling.6\n332\nCourtesy and Kindness 333\nThe courtesies of everyday life and the affection that should exist\nbetween members of the same family do not depend upon outward\ncircumstances.7\nPleasant voices, gentle manners, and sincere affection that finds\nexpression in all the actions, together with industry, neatness, and\neconomy, make even a hovel the happiest of homes. The Creator\nregards such a home with approbation.8\nThere are many who should live less for the outside world and\nmore for the members of their own family circle. There should be\nless display of superficial politeness and affection toward strangers\nand visitors and more of the courtesy that springs from genuine love\nand sympathy toward the dear ones of our own firesides.9\nTrue Politeness Defined\u2014There is great need of the cultivation\nof true refinement in the home. This is a powerful witness in favor\nof the truth. In whomsoever they may appear, vulgarity of language\nand of demeanor indicate a vitiated heart. Truth of heavenly origin\nnever degrades the receiver, never makes him coarse or rough. Truth\nis softening and refining in its influence. When received into the\nheart, it makes the youth respectful and polite. Christian politeness\nis received only under the working of the Holy Spirit. It does not\nconsist in affectation or artificial polish, in bowing and simpering.\nThis is the class of politeness possessed by those of the world, but\nthey are destitute of true Christian politeness. True polish, true [423]\npoliteness, is obtained only from a practical knowledge of the gospel\nof Christ. True politeness, true courtesy, is a kindness shown to all,\nhigh or low, rich or poor.10\nThe essence of true politeness is consideration for others. The\nessential, enduring education is that which broadens the sympathies\nand encourages universal kindliness. That so-called culture which\ndoes not make a youth deferential toward his parents, appreciative\nof their excellences, forbearing toward their defects, and helpful to\ntheir necessities; which does not make him considerate and tender,\ngenerous and helpful toward the young, the old, and the unfortunate,\nand courteous toward all is a failure.11\nChristian courtesy is the golden clasp which unites the members\nof the family in bonds of love, becoming closer and stronger every\nday.12\n334 The Adventist Home\nMake the Golden Rule the Law for the Family \u2014The most\nvaluable rules for social and family intercourse are to be found in\nthe Bible. There is not only the best and purest standard of morality\nbut the most valuable code of politeness. Our Saviour\u2019s Sermon on\nthe Mount contains instruction of priceless worth to old and young.\nIt should be often read in the family circle and its precious teachings\nexemplified in the daily life. The golden rule, \u201cWhatsoever ye would\nthat men should do to you, do ye even so to them,\u201d as well as the\napostolic injunction, \u201cIn honour preferring one another,\u201d should be\nmade the law of the family. Those who cherish the spirit of Christ\nwill manifest politeness at home, a spirit of benevolence even in\nlittle things. They will be constantly seeking to make all around\nthem happy, forgetting self in their kind attentions to others. This is[424]\nthe fruit which grows upon the Christian tree.13\nThe golden rule is the principle of true courtesy, and its truest\nillustration is seen in the life and character of Jesus. Oh, what rays\nof softness and beauty shone forth in the daily life of our Saviour!\nWhat sweetness flowed from His very presence! The same spirit will\nbe revealed in His children. Those with whom Christ dwells will be\nsurrounded with a divine atmosphere. Their white robes of purity\nwill be fragrant with perfume from the garden of the Lord. Their\nfaces will reflect light from His, brightening the path for stumbling\nand weary feet.14\nThe Best Treatise on Etiquette \u2014The most valuable treatise\non etiquette ever penned is the precious instruction given by the\nSaviour, with the utterance of the Holy Spirit through the Apostle\nPaul\u2014words that should be ineffaceably written in the memory of\nevery human being, young or old:\n\u201cAs I have loved you, that ye also love one another.\u201d\n\u201cLove suffereth long, and is kind;\nLove envieth not;\nLove vaunteth not itself,\nIs not puffed up,\nDoth not behave itself unseemly,\nSeeketh not its own,\nIs not provoked,\nTaketh not account of evil;\nCourtesy and Kindness 335\nRejoiceth not in unrighteousness,\nBut rejoiceth with the truth;\nBeareth all things, believeth all things,\nHopeth all things, endureth all things.\nLove never faileth.\u201d15\nThe Bible enjoins courtesy; and it presents many illustrations [425]\nof the unselfish spirit, the gentle grace, the winsome temper, that\ncharacterize true politeness. These are but reflections of the character\nof Christ. All the real tenderness and courtesy in the world, even\namong those who do not acknowledge His name, is from Him.\nAnd He desires these characteristics to be perfectly reflected in His\nchildren. It is His purpose that in us men shall behold His beauty.16\nChristianity will make a man a gentleman. Christ was courteous,\neven to His persecutors; and His true followers will manifest the\nsame spirit. Look at Paul when brought before rulers. His speech be-\nfore Agrippa is an illustration of true courtesy as well as persuasive\neloquence. The gospel does not encourage the formal politeness cur-\nrent with the world, but the courtesy that springs from real kindness\nof heart.17\nWe do not plead for a manifestation of what the world calls\ncourtesy, but for that courtesy which everyone will take with him to\nthe mansions of the blessed.18\nTrue Courtesy Must Be Motivated by Love\u2014The most care-\nful cultivation of the outward proprieties of life is not sufficient to\nshut out all fretfulness, harsh judgment, and unbecoming speech.\nTrue refinement will never be revealed so long as self is considered as\nthe supreme object. Love must dwell in the heart. A thoroughgoing\nChristian draws his motives of action from his deep heart-love for\nhis Master. Up through the roots of his affection for Christ springs\nan unselfish interest in his brethren.19\nOf all things that are sought, cherished, and cultivated, there is\nnothing so valuable in the sight of God as a pure heart, a disposition\nimbued with thankfulness and peace.\nIf the divine harmony of truth and love exists in the heart, it will [426]\nshine forth in words and actions.... The spirit of genuine benevo-\nlence must dwell in the heart. Love imparts to its possessor grace,\npropriety, and comeliness of deportment. Love illuminates the coun-\n336 The Adventist Home\ntenance and subdues the voice; it refines and elevates the entire man.\nIt brings him into harmony with God, for it is a heavenly attribute.20\nTrue courtesy is not learned by the mere practice of rules of\netiquette. Propriety of deportment is at all times to be observed;\nwherever principle is not compromised, consideration of others will\nlead to compliance with accepted customs; but true courtesy requires\nno sacrifice of principle to conventionality. It ignores caste. It\nteaches self-respect, respect for the dignity of man as man, a regard\nfor every member of the great human brotherhood.21\nLove Is Expressed in Looks, Words, and Acts \u2014Above all\nthings, parents should surround their children with an atmosphere\nof cheerfulness, courtesy, and love. A home where love dwells\nand where it finds expression in looks, in words, in acts, is a place\nwhere angels delight to dwell. Parents, let the sunshine of love,\ncheer, and happy content enter your own hearts, and let its sweet\ninfluence pervade the home. Manifest a kindly, forbearing spirit,\nand encourage the same in your children, cultivating all those graces\nthat will brighten the home life. The atmosphere thus created will\nbe to the children what air and sunshine are to the vegetable world,\npromoting health and vigor of mind and body.22\nGentle manners, cheerful conversation, and loving acts will bind\nthe hearts of children to their parents by the silken cords of affection\nand will do more to make home attractive than the rarest ornaments[427]\nthat can be bought for gold.23\nVaried Temperaments Must Blend\u2014It is in the order of God\nthat persons of varied temperament should associate together. When\nthis is the case, each member of the household should sacredly regard\nthe feelings and respect the rights of the others. By this means mutual\nconsideration and forbearance will be cultivated, prejudices will be\nsoftened, and rough points of character smoothed. Harmony may\nbe secured, and the blending of the varied temperaments may be a\nbenefit to each.24\nNothing Will Atone for Lack of Courtesy \u2014Those who pro-\nfess to be followers of Christ and are at the same time rough, unkind,\nand uncourteous in words and deportment have not learned of Jesus.\nA blustering, overbearing, faultfinding man is not a Christian; for\nto be a Christian is to be Christlike. The conduct of some professed\nChristians is so lacking in kindness and courtesy that their good is\nCourtesy and Kindness 337\nevil spoken of. Their sincerity may not be doubted; their uprightness\nmay not be questioned, but sincerity and uprightness will not atone\nfor a lack of kindness and courtesy. The Christian is to be sympa-\nthetic as well as true, pitiful and courteous as well as upright and\nhonest.25\nAny negligence of acts of politeness and tender regard on the\npart of brother for brother, any neglect of kind, encouraging words\nin the family circle, parents with children and children with parents,\nconfirms habits which make the character unchristlike. But if these\nlittle things are performed, they become great things. They increase\nto large proportions. They breathe a sweet perfume in the life which\nascends to God as holy incense.26\nMany Are Longing for Thoughtfulness\u2014Many long intensely [428]\nfor friendly sympathy.... We should be self-forgetful, ever looking\nout for opportunities, even in little things, to show gratitude for the\nfavors we have received of others, and watching for opportunities\nto cheer others and lighten and relieve their sorrows and burdens by\nacts of tender kindness and little deeds of love. These thoughtful\ncourtesies that, commencing in our families, extend outside the\nfamily circle help make up the sum of life\u2019s happiness; and the\nneglect of these little things makes up the sum of life\u2019s bitterness\nand sorrow.27\nThrough Social Relations Contact Is Made With the\nWorld\u2014It is through the social relations that Christianity comes in\ncontact with the world. Every man or woman who has tasted of the\nlove of Christ and has received into the heart the divine illumination\nis required of God to shed light on the dark pathway of those who\nare unacquainted with the better way.28\nWe can manifest a thousand little attentions in friendly words and\npleasant looks, which will be reflected upon us again. Thoughtless\nChristians manifest by their neglect of others that they are not in\nunion with Christ. It is impossible to be in union with Christ and yet\nbe unkind to others and forgetful of their rights.29\nWe should all become witnesses for Jesus. Social power, sancti-\nfied by the grace of Christ, must be improved in winning souls to\nthe Saviour. Let the world see that we are not selfishly absorbed in\nour own interests, but that we desire others to share our blessings\nand privileges. Let them see that our religion does not make us\n338 The Adventist Home\nunsympathetic or exacting. Let all who profess to have found Christ\nminister as He did for the benefit of men. We should never give to[429]\nthe world the false impression that Christians are a gloomy, unhappy\npeople.30\nIf we are courteous and gentle at home, we shall carry the savor\nof a pleasant disposition when away from home. If we manifest\nforbearance, patience, meekness, and fortitude in the home, we shall\nbe able to be a light to the world.31\n1The Signs of the Times, September 9, 1886.\n2The Signs of the Times, May 25, 1882.\n3The Good Health, January 1, 1880, par. 6.\n4Education, 240.\n5The Review and Herald, June 13, 1882.\n6The Signs of the Times, April 17, 1884.\n7The Signs of the Times, August 23, 1877.\n8The Signs of the Times, October 2, 1884.\n9Ibid.\n10Manuscript 74, 1900.\n11Education, 241.\n12The Signs of the Times, November 29, 1877.\n13The Signs of the Times, July 1, 1886.\n14Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, 135.\n15Education, 242.\n16Ibid., 241, 242.\n17The Ministry of Healing, 489, 490.\n18The Signs of the Times, August 13, 1912.\n19The Ministry of Healing, 490.\n20Testimonies for the Church 4:559, 560.\n21Education, 240.\n22Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 115.\n23The Signs of the Times, October 2, 1884.\n24The Signs of the Times, April 4, 1911.\n25The Youth\u2019s Instructor, March 31, 1908.\n26Manuscript 107, 1898.\n27Testimonies for the Church 3:539, 540.\n28Testimonies for the Church 4:555.\n29Testimonies for the Church 3:539.\n30The Desire of Ages, 152.\n31The Signs of the Times, November 14, 1892.\nChapter 70\u2014Cheerfulness [430]\nThe True Christian Will Be Cheerful\u2014Do not allow the per-\nplexities and worries of everyday life to fret your mind and cloud\nyour brow. If you do, you will always have something to vex and\nannoy. Life is what we make it, and we shall find what we look for.\nIf we look for sadness and trouble, if we are in a frame of mind to\nmagnify little difficulties, we shall find plenty of them to engross\nour thoughts and our conversation. But if we look on the bright side\nof things, we shall find enough to make us cheerful and happy. If\nwe give smiles, they will be returned to us; if we speak pleasant,\ncheerful words, they will be spoken to us again.\nWhen Christians appear as gloomy and depressed as though they\nthought themselves friendless, they give a wrong impression of reli-\ngion. In some cases the idea has been entertained that cheerfulness\nis inconsistent with the dignity of the Christian character, but this is\na mistake. Heaven is all joy; and if we gather to our souls the joys\nof heaven and, as far as possible, express them in our words and\ndeportment, we shall be more pleasing to our heavenly Father than\nif we were gloomy and sad.\nIt is the duty of everyone to cultivate cheerfulness instead of\nbrooding over sorrow and troubles. Many not only make themselves\nwretched in this way, but they sacrifice health and happiness to a\nmorbid imagination. There are things in their surroundings that are\nnot agreeable, and their countenances wear a continual frown that,\nmore plainly than words, expresses discontent. These depressing [431]\nemotions are a great injury to them healthwise; for by hindering the\nprocess of digestion, they interfere with nutrition. While grief and\nanxiety cannot remedy a single evil, they can do great harm; but\ncheerfulness and hope, while they brighten the pathway of others,\n\u201care life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.\u201d1\nMrs. White Was Cheerful in Adversity [Note: In 1867 Elder\nJames White, who was in a critical condition following a paralytic\nstroke, was a patient at \u201cOur Home,\u201d in Dansville, New York. The\n339\n340 The Adventist Home\ndoctor in charge of the institution regarded religion as a depress-\ning influence and encouraged his patients to participate in various\namusements for the purpose of making them cheerful. Mrs. White\nwas solicited by one of the attendants to make a subscription for a\ndance and invited to bury her sorrows by attending. The words above\nindicate the nature of her reply to the suggestion.]\u2014Do you ever see\nme gloomy, desponding, complaining? I have a faith which forbids\nthis. It is a misconception of the true ideal of Christian character\nand Christian service that leads to these conclusions. It is the want\nof genuine religion that produces gloom, despondency, and sadness.\nEarnest Christians seek to imitate Jesus, for to be Christians is to be\nChristlike. It will be really essential to have correct conceptions of\nChrist\u2019s life, Christ\u2019s habits, that His principles may be reproduced\nin us who would be Christlike.\nA half service, loving the world, loving self, loving frivolous\namusements, makes a timid, cowardly servant; he follows Christ a\ngreat way off. A hearty, willing service to Jesus produces a sunny\nreligion. Those who follow Christ the most closely have not been\ngloomy. In Christ is light and peace and joy forevermore. We need\nmore Christ and less worldliness, more Christ and less selfishness.2\nWalk as Children of Light\u2014It is not the will of God that we[432]\nshould be gloomy or impatient, nor that we should be light and\ntrifling. It is Satan\u2019s studied plan to push persons from one extreme\nto the other. As children of the light, God would have us cultivate a\ncheerful, happy spirit, that we may show forth the praises of Him\nwho hath called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.3\nWinning the Affection of Children \u2014Smile, parents; smile,\nteachers. If your heart is sad, let not your face reveal the fact. Let\nthe sunshine from a loving, grateful heart light up the countenance.\nUnbend from your iron dignity, adapt yourselves to the children\u2019s\nneeds, and make them love you. You must win their affection, if you\nwould impress religious truth upon their heart.4\nKeep a Pleasant Countenance and Melodious Voice \u2014Par-\nents, be cheerful, not common and cheap, but be thankful and obedi-\nent and submissive to your heavenly Father. You are not at liberty\nto act out your feelings if things should arise that irritate. Winning\nlove is to be like deep waters, ever flowing forth in the management\nof your children. They are the lambs of the flock of God. Bring\nCheerfulness 341\nyour little ones to Christ. If parents would educate their children to\nbe pleasant, they should never speak in a scolding manner to them.\nEducate yourself to carry a pleasant countenance, and bring all the\nsweetness and melody possible into your voice. The angels of God\nare ever near your little ones, and your harsh loud tones of fretfulness\nare not pleasant to their ears.5\nThe mother should cultivate a cheerful, contented, happy dis-\nposition. Every effort in this direction will be abundantly repaid in\nboth the physical well-being and the moral character of her children. [433]\nA cheerful spirit will promote the happiness of her family and in a\nvery great degree improve her own health.6\nLift the Shadows and Lighten the Task\u2014Look upon matters\nin a cheerful light, seeking to lift the shadows that, if cherished, will\nenvelop the soul. Cultivate sympathy for others. Let cheerfulness,\nkindness, and love pervade the home. This will increase a love for\nreligious exercises, and duties large and small will be performed\nwith a light heart.7\nCheerfulness Without Levity Is Christian Grace \u2014We may\nhave true Christian dignity and at the same time be cheerful and\npleasant in our deportment. Cheerfulness without levity is one of\nthe Christian graces.8\n1The Signs of the Times, February 12, 1885.\n2Manuscript 1, 1867.\n3Australasian Union Conference Record, November 1, 1904.\n4Fundamentals of Christian Education, 68.\n5Manuscript 126, 1897.\n6The Ministry of Healing, 374.\n7The Signs of the Times, September 1, 1898.\n8Testimonies for the Church 4:62.\nChapter 71\u2014Speech[434]\nThe Voice Is a Talent\u2014The voice is an entrusted talent, and it\nshould be used to help and encourage and strengthen our fellow men.\nIf parents will love God and keep the way of the Lord to do justice\nand judgment, their language will not savor of sickly sentimentalism.\nIt will be of a sound, pure, edifying character. Whether they are at\nhome or abroad, their words will be well chosen. They will descend\nto no cheapness.1\nEvery Word Has an Influence\u2014Every word spoken by fathers\nand mothers has its influence over the children, for good or for evil.\nIf the parents speak passionately, if they show the spirit shown by\nthe children of this world, God counts them as the children of this\nworld, not as His sons and daughters.2\nA word spoken in due season may be as good seed in youthful\nminds and may result in leading little feet in the right path. But a\nwrong word may lead their feet in the path of ruin.3\nAngels hear the words that are spoken in the home. Therefore,\nnever scold; but let the influence of your words be such that it will\nascend to heaven as fragrant incense.4\nParents should keep the atmosphere of the home pure and fra-\ngrant with kind words, with tender sympathy and love; but at the\nsame time they are to be firm and unyielding in principle. If you\nare firm with your children, they may think that you do not love\nthem. This you may expect, but never manifest harshness. Justice\nand mercy must clasp hands; there must be no wavering or impulsive\nmovements.5\nLanguage to Be an Outward Expression of Inward Grace\u2014[435]\nThe chief requisite of language is that it be pure and kind and true\u2014\n\u201cthe outward expression of an inward grace.\u201d ... The best school for\nthis language study is the home.6\nKind words are as dew and gentle showers to the soul. The\nScripture says of Christ that grace was poured into His lips, that He\nmight \u201cknow how to speak a word in season to him that is weary.\u201d\n342\nSpeech 343\nAnd the Lord bids us, \u201cLet your speech be alway with grace,\u201d \u201cthat\nit may minister grace unto the hearers.\u201d7\nVoice Culture Should Be Given in the Home\u2014Instruction in\nvocal culture should be given in the home circle. Parents should\nteach their children to speak so plainly that those who are listening\ncan understand every word that is said. They should teach them to\nread the Bible in clear, distinct utterance, in a way that will honor\nGod. And let not those who kneel round the family altar put their\nfaces in their hands and in their chair when they address God. Let\nthem lift up their heads and, with holy awe and boldness, come to\nthe throne of grace.8\nBe pure in speech. Cultivate a soft and persuasive, not a harsh\nand dictatorial, tone of voice. Give the children lessons in voice\nculture. Train their habits of speech, until no coarse or rough words\nwill come spontaneously from their lips when any trial comes to\nthem.9\nV oice culture is a subject that has much to do with the health of\nstudents. The youth should be taught how to breathe properly and\nhow to read in such a way that no unnatural strain shall come on the\nthroat and lungs, but that the work shall be shared by the abdominal\nmuscles. Speaking from the throat, letting the sound come from the\nupper part of the vocal organs, impairs the health of these organs [436]\nand decreases their efficiency. The abdominal muscles are to do\nthe heaviest part of the labor, the throat being used as a channel.\nMany have died who might have lived had they been taught how to\nuse the voice correctly. The right use of the abdominal muscles in\nreading and speaking will prove a remedy for many voice and chest\ndifficulties and the means of prolonging life.10\nThe Effect of Harsh, Scolding Words \u2014In a home where\nharsh, fretful, scolding words are spoken, a child cries much; and\nupon its tender sensibilities are impressed the marks of unhappiness\nand discord. Then, mothers, let your countenance be full of sunshine.\nSmile, if you can, and the infant\u2019s mind and heart will reflect the\nlight of your countenance as the polished plate of an artist portrays\nthe human features. Be sure, mothers, to have an indwelling Christ\nso that on your child\u2019s plastic mind may be impressed the divine\nlikeness.11\n344 The Adventist Home\nLet There Be No Jarring Note \u2014Allow nothing like strife or\ndissension to come into the home. Speak gently. Never raise your\nvoice to harshness. Keep yourselves calm. Put away faultfinding and\nall untruthfulness. Tell the children that you want to help them to\nprepare for a holy heaven, where all is peace, where not one jarring\nnote is heard. Be patient with them in their trials, which may look\nsmall to you but which are large to them.12\nWhen fathers and mothers are converted, there will be a thorough\nconversion of their principles of management. Their thoughts will\nbe converted; their tongues will be converted....\nThere will be no loud, angry talking in the home. The words\nwill be of a character to soothe and bless the hearer.... Take all the\nugly features out of the voice.13\nWe must subdue a hasty temper and control our words, and in[437]\nthis we shall gain great victories. Unless we control our words and\ntemper, we are slaves to Satan. We are in subjection to him. He\nleads us captive. All jangling and unpleasant, impatient, fretful\nwords are an offering presented to his satanic majesty. And it is a\ncostly offering, more costly than any sacrifice we can make for God;\nfor it destroys the peace and happiness of whole families, destroys\nhealth, and is eventually the cause of forfeiting an eternal life of\nhappiness.14\nShall the Words Cause Sunshine or Shadow?\u2014It is important\nthat children and youth should be trained to guard their words and\ndeeds; for their course of action causes sunshine or shadow, not\nonly in their own home, but also with all with whom they come in\ncontact.15\nUnhappiness is often caused by an unwise use of the talent of\nspeech. The word of God does not authorize anyone to speak harshly,\nthereby creating disagreeable feelings and unhappiness in the family.\nThe other members of the family lose their respect for the one who\nspeaks thus, when if he would restrain his feelings, he might win the\nconfidence and affection of all.16\nPleasant Words to Children; Respectful Words to Parents\u2014\nLet only pleasant words be spoken by parents to their children,\nand respectful words by children to their parents. Attention must\nbe given to these things in the home life; for if, in their character\nSpeech 345\nbuilding, children form right habits, it will be much easier for them\nto be taught by God and to be obedient to His requirements.17\nShun Vulgarity in Every Form \u2014Fathers and mothers, hus-\nbands and wives, brothers and sisters, do not educate yourselves in [438]\nthe line of vulgarity of action, word, or thought. Coarse sayings,\nlow jests, lack of politeness and true courtesy in the home life, will\nbecome as second nature to you and will unfit you for the society\nof those who are becoming sanctified through the truth. The home\nis too sacred a place to be polluted by vulgarity, sensuality, recrim-\nination, and scandal. Silence the evil word; put away the unholy\nthought, for the True Witness weighs every word, sets a value on\nevery action, and declares, \u201cI know thy works.\u201d18\nLow, cheap, common talk should find no place in the family.\nWhen the heart is pure, rich treasures of wisdom will flow forth.19\nIndulge in no foolish talking in your house. Even very young\nchildren will be benefited by \u201cthe form of sound words.\u201d But idle\nand foolish words exchanged between father and mother will lead\nto the same kind of words among the children; while right, candid,\ntruthful, and serious words will lead to the same in all the household\nand will lead to right actions also.20\nThe Evils of Angry, Hasty Words \u2014When you speak angry\nwords to your children, you are helping the cause of the enemy of all\nrighteousness. Let every child have a fair chance from babyhood up.\nThe work of teaching should begin in childhood, not accompanied\nby harshness and fretting, but in kindness and patience; and this\ninstruction should be continued through all their years to manhood\nand womanhood.21\nLet every family seek the Lord in earnest prayer for help to do\nthe work of God. Let them overcome the habits of hasty speech and\nthe desire to blame others. Let them study to be kind and courteous\nin the home, to form habits of thoughtfulness and care.22\nWhat harm is wrought in the family circle by the utterance of [439]\nimpatient words, for the impatient utterance of one leads another to\nretort in the same spirit and manner. Then come words of retaliation,\nwords of self-justification, and it is by such words that a heavy,\ngalling yoke is manufactured for your neck; for all these bitter words\nwill come back in a baleful harvest to your soul.23\n346 The Adventist Home\nHard words beat upon the heart through the ear, awakening to\nlife the worst passions of the soul and tempting men and women\nto break God\u2019s commandments .... Words are as seeds which are\nplanted.24\nPassionate Words a Species of Swearing\u2014Among the mem-\nbers of many families there is practiced the habit of saying loose,\ncareless things; and the habit of tantalizing, of speaking harsh words,\nbecomes stronger and stronger as it is indulged, and thus many ob-\njectionable words are spoken that are after Satan\u2019s order and not\nafter the order of God.... Burning words of passion should never be\nspoken, for in the sight of God and holy angels they are as a species\nof swearing.25\nHow a Father Lost His Children\u2019s Confidence\u2014My brother,\nyour overbearing words hurt your children. As they advance in years,\ntheir tendency to criticize will grow. Faultfinding is corrupting your\nlife and is extending to your wife and to your children. Your children\nare not encouraged to give you their confidence or to acknowledge\ntheir faults, because they know that your stern rebuke is sure to\nfollow. Your words are often as a desolating hail which breaks down\ntender plants. It is impossible to estimate the harm thus done. Your\nchildren practice deception in order to avoid the hard words you\nspeak. They will evade the truth to escape censure and punishment.[440]\nA hard, cold command will do them no good.26\nA Suggestive Pledge\u2014It would be well for every man to sign\na pledge to speak kindly in his home, to let the law of love rule\nhis speech. Parents, never speak hastily. If your children do wrong,\ncorrect them, but let your words be full of tenderness and love. Every\ntime you scold, you lose a precious opportunity of giving a lesson in\nforbearance and patience. Let love be the most prominent feature in\nyour correction of wrong.27\nTable Conversation\u2014How many families season their daily\nmeals with doubt and questionings! They dissect the characters of\ntheir friends and serve them up as a dainty dessert. A precious bit of\nslander is passed around the board to be commented upon, not only\nby adults, but by children. In this God is dishonored.28\nIn the home the spirit of criticism and faultfinding should have\nno place. The peace of the home is too sacred to be marred by this\nspirit. But how often, when seated at the meal table, the members of\nSpeech 347\nthe family pass round a dish of criticism, faultfinding, and scandal.\nWere Christ to come today, would He not find many of the families\nwho profess to be Christians cherishing the spirit of criticism and\nunkindness? The members of such families are unready to unite\nwith the family above.29\nLet the conversation at the family board be such as is calculated\nto leave a fragrant influence on the minds of the children.30\nGossip and Talebearing\u2014We think with horror of the cannibal\nwho feasts on the still warm and trembling flesh of his victim; but\nare the results of even this practice more terrible than are the agony [441]\nand ruin caused by misrepresenting motive, blackening reputation,\ndissecting character? Let the children, and the youth as well, learn\nwhat God says about these things: \u201cDeath and life are in the power\nof the tongue.\u201d31\nThe spirit of gossip and talebearing is one of Satan\u2019s special\nagencies to sow discord and strife, to separate friends, and to under-\nmine the faith of many in the truthfulness of our positions.32\nSowing Seeds of Distrust Is an Aid to the Enemy \u2014It is nat-\nural for human beings to speak sharp words. Those who yield to\nthis inclination open the door for Satan to enter their hearts and to\nmake them quick to remember the mistakes and errors of others.\nTheir failings are dwelt upon, their deficiencies noted, and words are\nspoken that cause a lack of confidence in one who is doing his best\nto fulfill his duty as a laborer together with God. Often the seeds\nof distrust are sown because one thinks that he ought to have been\nfavored but was not.33\nGod calls upon believers to cease finding fault, to cease making\nhasty, unkind speeches. Parents, let the words that you speak to your\nchildren be kind and pleasant, that angels may have your help in\ndrawing them to Christ. A thorough reformation is needed in the\nhome church. Let it begin at once. Let all grumbling and fretting\nand scolding cease. Those who fret and scold shut out the angels of\nheaven and open the door to evil angels.34\nA Plea for Parental Forbearance and Restraint \u2014Parents,\nwhen you feel fretful, you should not commit so great a sin as\nto poison the whole family with this dangerous irritability. At such\ntimes set a double watch over yourselves, and resolve in your heart [442]\nnot to offend with your lips, that you will utter only pleasant, cheer-\n348 The Adventist Home\nful words. Say to yourselves: \u201cI will not mar the happiness of my\nchildren by a fretful word.\u201d By thus controlling yourselves, you will\ngrow stronger. Your nervous system will not be so sensitive. You\nwill be strengthened by the principles of right. The consciousness\nthat you are faithfully discharging your duty will strengthen you.\nAngels of God will smile upon your efforts and help you.35\nFathers and mothers, speak kindly to your children; remember\nhow sensitive you are, how little you can bear to be blamed; reflect,\nand know that your children are like you. That which you cannot\nbear do not lay upon them. If you cannot bear censure and blame,\nneither can your children, who are weaker than you and cannot\nendure as much. Let your pleasant, cheerful words ever be like\nsunbeams in your family. The fruits of self-control, thoughtfulness,\nand painstaking on your part will be a hundredfold.36\nA Time for Silence or Song\u2014Trials will come, it is true, even\nto those who are fully consecrated. The patience of the most patient\nwill be severely tested. The husband or the wife may utter words\nthat are liable to provoke a hasty reply, but let the one who is spoken\nto keep silent. In silence there is safety. Often silence is the severest\nrebuke that could be given to the one who has sinned with his lips.37\nWhen they [the children and youth] lose self-control and speak\nwords that are passionate, an attitude of silence is often the best\ncourse to pursue, not taking up a line of reproof or argument or\ncondemnation. Repentance will come very soon. The silence that is\ngolden will often do more than all the words that can be uttered.38\nWhen others are impatient, fretful, and complaining because[443]\nself is not subdued, begin to sing some of the songs of Zion. While\nChrist was working at the carpenter\u2019s bench, others would some-\ntimes surround Him, trying to cause Him to be impatient; but He\nwould begin singing some of the beautiful psalms, and before they\nrealized what they were doing, they had joined with Him in singing,\ninfluenced, as it were, by the power of the Holy Spirit which was\nthere.39\nThe Battle for Self-control in Speech\u2014God requires parents,\nby self-control, by an example of solid character building, to dis-\nseminate light within the immediate circle of their own little flock.\nNo trifling, common conversation is to be indulged. God looks into\nevery secret thing of life. By some a constant battle is maintained\nSpeech 349\nfor self-control. Daily they strive silently and prayerfully against\nharshness of speech and temper. These strivings may never be ap-\npreciated by human beings. They may get no praise from human lips\nfor keeping back the hasty words which sought for utterance. The\nworld will never see these conquests, and if it could, it would only\ndespise the conquerors. But in heaven\u2019s record they are registered as\novercomers. There is One who witnesses every secret combat and\nevery silent victory, and He says, \u201cHe that is slow to anger is better\nthan the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a\ncity.\u201d40\nIf you refuse to storm or fret or scold, the Lord will show you\nthe way through. He will help you to use the talent of speech in such\na Christlike way that the precious attributes of patience, comfort,\nand love will be brought into the home.41\n1Manuscript 36, 1899.\n2Manuscript 100, 1902.\n3The Review and Herald, June 24, 1890.\n4Letter 10, 1912.\n5The Review and Herald, March 30, 1897.\n6Education, 235.\n7The Youth\u2019s Instructor, March 31, 1908.\n8Manuscript 4, 1901.\n9Manuscript 60, 1903.\n10Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 297.\n11The Review and Herald, September 8, 1904.\n12Manuscript 14, 1905.\n13Letter 75, 1898.\n14Testimonies for the Church 1:310.\n15The Youth\u2019s Instructor, November 5, 1896.\n16Manuscript 60, 1903.\n17The Review and Herald, November 17, 1896.\n18The Signs of the Times, November 14, 1892.\n19The Review and Herald, May 17, 1898.\n20The Review and Herald, April 14, 1885.\n21Manuscript 53, 1912.\n22Manuscript 31, 1907.\n23The Review and Herald, February 27, 1913.\n24Letter 105, 1893.\n25The Youth\u2019s Instructor, September 20, 1894.\n26Letter 8a, 1896.\n27Letter 29, 1902.\n28Testimonies for the Church 4:195.\n350 The Adventist Home\n29The Signs of the Times, February 17, 1904.\n30Manuscript 49, 1898.\n31Education, 235.\n32Testimonies for the Church 4:195.\n33Letter 169, 1904.\n34Letter 133, 1904.\n35Testimonies for the Church 1:386, 387.\n36Ibid., 1:401.\n37Manuscript 70, 1903.\n38Manuscript 59, 1900.\n39Manuscript 102, 1901.\n40The Signs of the Times, August 23, 1899.\n41Manuscript 67, 1901.\nChapter 72\u2014Hospitality [444]\n[445]\nAngels May Be Entertained Today \u2014The Bible lays much\nstress upon the practice of hospitality. Not only does it enjoin hospi-\ntality as a duty, but it presents many beautiful pictures of the exercise\nof this grace and the blessings which it brings. Foremost among\nthese is the experience of Abraham....\nThese acts of courtesy God thought of sufficient importance to\nrecord in His word; and more than a thousand years later they were\nreferred to by an inspired apostle: \u201cBe not forgetful to entertain\nstrangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.\u201d\nThe privilege granted Abraham and Lot is not denied to us. By\nshowing hospitality to God\u2019s children we, too, may receive His\nangels into our dwellings. Even in our day angels in human form\nenter the homes of men and are entertained by them. And Christians\nwho live in the light of God\u2019s countenance are always accompanied\nby unseen angels, and these holy beings leave behind them a blessing\nin our homes.1\nNeglected Opportunities and Privileges\u2014\u201cA lover of hospital-\nity\u201d is among the specifications given by the Holy Spirit as marking\none who is to bear responsibility in the church. And to the whole\nchurch is given the injunction: \u201cUse hospitality one to another with-\nout grudging. As every man hath received the gift, even so minister\nthe same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of\nGod.\u201d\nThese admonitions have been strangely neglected. Even among\nthose who profess to be Christians true hospitality is little exercised. [446]\nAmong our own people the opportunity of showing hospitality is\nnot regarded as it should be, as a privilege and blessing. There is al-\ntogether too little sociability, too little of a disposition to make room\nfor two or three more at the family board without embarrassment or\nparade.2\nInadequate Excuses\u2014I have heard many excuse themselves\nfrom inviting to their homes and hearts the saints of God: \u201cWhy, I\n351\n352 The Adventist Home\nhave nothing prepared; I have nothing cooked; they must go to some\nother place.\u201d And at that place there may be some other excuse in-\nvented for not receiving those who need hospitality, and the feelings\nof the visitors are deeply grieved, and they leave with unpleasant\nimpressions in regard to the hospitality of these professed brethren\nand sisters. If you have no bread, sister, imitate the case brought to\nview in the Bible. Go to your neighbor and say: \u201cFriend, lend me\nthree loaves; for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I\nhave nothing to set before him.\u201d\nWe have not an example of this lack of bread ever being made an\nexcuse to refuse entrance to an applicant. When Elijah came to the\nwidow of Sarepta, she shared her morsel with the prophet of God,\nand he wrought a miracle and caused that in that act of making a\nhome for his servant and sharing her morsel with him, she herself\nwas sustained, and her life and that of her son preserved. Thus will\nit prove in the case of many, if they do this cheerfully, for the glory\nof God.\nSome plead their poor health\u2014they would love to do if they had\nstrength. Such have so long shut themselves up to themselves and\nthought so much of their own poor feelings and talked so much of\ntheir sufferings, trials, and afflictions that it is their present truth.\nThey can think of no one but self, however much others may be[447]\nin need of sympathy and assistance. You who are suffering with\npoor health, there is a remedy for you. If thou clothe the naked and\nbring the poor that are cast out to thy house and deal thy bread to\nthe hungry, \u201cthen shall thy light break forth as the morning, and\nthine health shall spring forth speedily.\u201d Doing good is an excellent\nremedy for disease. Those who engage in the work are invited to\ncall upon God, and He has pledged Himself to answer them. Their\nsoul shall be satisfied in drought, and they shall be like a watered\ngarden, whose waters fail not.3\nBlessings Lost by Selfish Exclusiveness \u2014God is displeased\nwith the selfish interest so often manifested for \u201cme and my family.\u201d\nEvery family that cherishes this spirit needs to be converted by the\npure principles exemplified in the life of Christ. Those who shut\nthemselves up within themselves, who are unwilling to drawn upon\nto entertain visitors, lose many blessings.4\nHospitality 353\nAngels are waiting to see if we embrace opportunities within\nour reach of doing good\u2014waiting to see if we will bless others, that\nthey in their turn may bless us. The Lord Himself has made us to\ndiffer\u2014some poor, some rich, some afflicted\u2014that all may have an\nopportunity to develop character. The poor are purposely permitted\nto be thus of God, that we may be tested and proved and develop\nwhat is in our hearts.5\nWhen the spirit of hospitality dies, the heart becomes palsied\nwith selfishness.6\nTo Whom Should Hospitality Be Extended?\u2014Our social en-\ntertainments should not be governed by the dictates of worldly cus-\ntom, but by the Spirit of Christ and the teaching of His word. The\nIsraelites, in all their festivities, included the poor, the stranger, and [448]\nthe Levite, who was both the assistant of the priest in the sanctuary\nand a religious teacher and missionary. These were regarded as the\nguests of the people, to share their hospitality on all occasions of\nsocial and religious rejoicing, and to be tenderly cared for in sick-\nness or in need. It is such as these whom we should make welcome\nto our homes. How much such a welcome might do to cheer and\nencourage the missionary nurse or the teacher, the care-burdened,\nhard-working mother, or the feeble and aged, so often without a\nhome and struggling with poverty and many discouragements.\n\u201cWhen thou makest a dinner or a supper,\u201d Christ says, \u201ccall\nnot thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich\nneighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made\nthee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed,\nthe lame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot\nrecompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection\nof the just.\u201d\nThese are guests whom it will lay on you no great burden to\nreceive. You will not need to provide for them elaborate or expensive\nentertainment. You will need to make no effort at display. The\nwarmth of a genial welcome, a place at your fireside, a seat at your\nhome table, the privilege of sharing the blessing of the hour of prayer,\nwould to many of these be like a glimpse of heaven.\nOur sympathies are to overflow the boundaries of self and the\nenclosure of family walls. There are precious opportunities for those\nwho will make their homes a blessing to others. Social influence is\n354 The Adventist Home\na wonderful power. We can use it, if we will, as a means of helping\nthose about us.7\nA Refuge for Tempted Youth\u2014Our homes should be a place of[449]\nrefuge for the tempted youth. Many there are who stand at the parting\nof the ways. Every influence, every impression, is determining\nthe choice that shapes their destiny both here and hereafter. Evil\ninvites them. Its resorts are made bright and attractive. They have a\nwelcome for every comer. All about us are youth who have no home\nand many whose homes have no helpful, uplifting power, and the\nyouth drift into evil. They are going down to ruin within the very\nshadow of our own doors.\nThese youth need a hand stretched out to them in sympathy. Kind\nwords simply spoken, little attentions simply bestowed, will sweep\naway the clouds of temptations which gather over the soul. The true\nexpression of heaven-born sympathy has power to open the door of\nhearts that need the fragrance of Christlike words and the simple,\ndelicate touch of the spirit of Christ\u2019s love. If we would show an\ninterest in the youth, invite them to our homes, and surround them\nwith cheering, helpful influences, there are many who would gladly\nturn their steps into the upward path.8\nPreserve Family Simplicity\u2014When visitors come, as they fre-\nquently will, they should not be allowed to absorb all the time and\nattention of the mother; her children\u2019s temporal and spiritual wel-\nfare should come first. Time should not be used in preparing rich\ncakes, pies, and unhealthful viands for the table. These are an extra\nexpense, and many cannot afford it. But the greater evil is in the\nexample. Let the simplicity of the family be preserved. Do not try\nto give the impression that you can sustain a style of living which is\nreally beyond your means. Do not try to appear what you are not,[450]\neither in your table preparations or in your manners.\nWhile you should treat your visitors kindly and make them feel\nat home, you should ever remember that you are a teacher to the little\nones God has given you. They are watching you, and no course of\nyours should direct their feet in the wrong way. Be to your visitors\njust what you are to your family every day\u2014pleasant, considerate,\nand courteous. In this way all can be educators, an example of good\nworks. They testify that there is something more essential than to\nHospitality 355\nkeep the mind on what they shall eat and drink and wherewithal they\nshall be clothed.9\nMaintain a Peaceful, Restful Atmosphere \u2014We would be\nmuch happier and more useful if our home life and social inter-\ncourse were governed by the meekness and simplicity of Christ.\nInstead of toiling for display to excite the admiration or the envy\nof visitors, we should endeavor to make all around us happy by\nour cheerfulness, sympathy, and love. Let visitors see that we are\nstriving to conform to the will of Christ. Let them see in us, even\nthough our lot is humble, a spirit of content and gratitude. The very\natmosphere of a truly Christian home is that of peace and restfulness.\nSuch an example will not be without effect.10\nAn Expense Account Is Kept in Heaven\u2014Christ keeps an ac-\ncount of every expense incurred in entertaining for His sake. He\nsupplies all that is necessary for this work. Those who for Christ\u2019s\nsake entertain their brethren, doing their best to make the visit prof-\nitable both to their guests and to themselves, are recorded in heaven\nas worthy of special blessings....\nChrist has given in His own life a lesson of hospitality. When [451]\nsurrounded by the hungry multitude beside the sea, He did not send\nthem unrefreshed to their homes. He said to His disciples: \u201cGive\nye them to eat.\u201d Matthew 14:16. And by an act of creative power\nHe supplied food sufficient to satisfy their need. Yet how simple\nwas the food provided! There were no luxuries. He who had all\nthe resources of heaven at His command could have spread for the\npeople a rich repast. But He supplied only that which would suffice\nfor their need, that which was the daily food of the fisherfolk about\nthe sea.\nIf men were today simple in their habits, living in harmony with\nnature\u2019s laws, there would be an abundant supply for all the needs\nof the human family. There would be fewer imaginary wants and\nmore opportunity to work in God\u2019s ways....\nPoverty need not shut us out from showing hospitality. We are to\nimpart what we have. There are those who struggle for a livelihood\nand who have great difficulty in making their income meet their\nnecessities; but they love Jesus in the person of His saints and are\nready to show hospitality to believers and unbelievers, trying to\nmake their visits profitable. At the family board and the family\n356 The Adventist Home\naltar the guests are made welcome. The season of prayer makes its\nimpression on those who receive entertainment, and even one visit\nmay mean the saving of a soul from death. For this work the Lord\nmakes a reckoning, saying: \u201cI will repay.\u201d11\nAwake to Opportunities\u2014Wake up, brethren and sisters. Do\nnot be afraid of good works. \u201cLet us not be weary in well doing:\nfor in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.\u201d Do not wait to be\ntold your duty. Open your eyes and see who are around you; make[452]\nyourselves acquainted with the helpless, afflicted, and needy. Hide\nnot yourselves from them, and seek not to shut out their needs. Who\ngives the proofs mentioned in James, of possessing pure religion,\nuntainted with selfishness or corruption? Who are anxious to do all\nin their power to aid in the great plan of salvation?12\n1Testimonies for the Church 6:341, 342.\n2Ibid., 6:342, 343.\n3Ibid., 2:28, 29.\n4Ibid., 6:344.\n5Ibid., 2:28.\n6Manuscript 41, 1903.\n7The Ministry of Healing, 352-354.\n8Ibid., 354.\n9Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 143.\n10The Review and Herald, November 29, 1887.\n11Testimonies for the Church 6:344, 345, 347.\n12Ibid., 2:29.\nSection 16\u2014The Home and its Social [453]\nRelationships\nChapter 73\u2014Our Social Needs[454]\n[455]\nGod Made Provision for Our Social Needs \u2014In the arrange-\nments for the education of the chosen people it is made manifest that\na life centered in God is a life of completeness. Every want He has\nimplanted He provides to satisfy; every faculty imparted He seeks\nto develop.\nThe Author of all beauty, Himself a lover of the beautiful, God\nprovided to gratify in His children the love of beauty. He made\nprovision also for their social needs, for the kindly and helpful\nassociations that do so much to cultivate sympathy and to brighten\nand sweeten life.1\nThe Influence of Association\u2014Everyone will find companions\nor make them. And just in proportion to the strength of the friend-\nship will be the amount of influence which friends will exert over\none another for good or for evil. All will have associates and will\ninfluence and be influenced in their turn.2\nGod\u2019s word places great stress upon the influence of association,\neven on men and women. How much greater is its power on the\ndeveloping mind and character of children and youth! The company\nthey keep, the principles they adopt, the habits they form, will decide\nthe question of their usefulness here and of their future destiny....\nIt is inevitable that the youth will have associates, and they will\nnecessarily feel their influence. There are mysterious links that bind\nsouls together so that the heart of one answers to the heart of another.\nOne catches the ideas, the sentiments, the spirit, of another. This\nassociation may be a blessing or a curse. The youth may help and[456]\nstrengthen one another, improving in deportment, in disposition, in\nknowledge; or, by permitting themselves to become careless and\nunfaithful, they may exert an influence that is demoralizing.3\nIt has been truly said, \u201cShow me your company, and I will show\nyou your character.\u201d The youth fail to realize how sensibly both\ntheir character and their reputation are affected by their choice of\nassociates. One seeks the company of those whose tastes and habits\n358\nOur Social Needs 359\nand practices are congenial. He who prefers the society of the\nignorant and vicious to that of the wise and good shows that his own\ncharacter is defective. His tastes and habits may at first be altogether\ndissimilar to the tastes and habits of those whose company he seeks;\nbut as he mingles with this class, his thoughts and feelings change;\nhe sacrifices right principles and insensibly yet unavoidably sinks\nto the level of his companions. As a stream always partakes of the\nproperty of the soil through which it runs, so the principles and\nhabits of youth invariably become tinctured with the character of the\ncompany in which they mingle.4\nNatural Tendencies Are Downward \u2014If the youth could be\npersuaded to associate with the pure, the thoughtful, and the amiable,\nthe effect would be most salutary. If choice is made of companions\nwho fear the Lord, the influence will lead to truth, to duty, and to\nholiness. A truly Christian life is a power for good. But, on the other\nhand, those who associate with men and women of questionable\nmorals, of bad principles and practices, will soon be walking in the\nsame path. The tendencies of the natural heart are downward. He\nwho associates with the skeptic will soon become skeptical; he who\nchooses the companionship of the vile will most assuredly become [457]\nvile. To walk in the counsel of the ungodly is the first step toward\nstanding in the way of sinners and sitting in the seat of the scornful.5\nWith worldly youth the love of society and pleasure becomes\nan absorbing passion. To dress, to visit, to indulge the appetite\nand passions, and to whirl through the round of social dissipation\nappear to be the great end of existence. They are unhappy if left\nin solitude. Their chief desire is to be admired and flattered and to\nmake a sensation in society; and when this desire is not gratified,\nlife seems unendurable.6\nThose who love society frequently indulge this trait until it be-\ncomes an overruling passion.... They cannot endure to read the Bible\nand contemplate heavenly things. They are miserable unless there\nis something to excite. They have not within them the power to be\nhappy, but they depend for happiness upon the company of other\nyouth as thoughtless and reckless as themselves. The powers which\nmight be turned to noble purposes they give to folly and mental\ndissipation.7\n360 The Adventist Home\nThe Blessings of Christian Sociability\u2014Christian sociability\nis altogether too little cultivated by God\u2019s people.... Those who shut\nthemselves up within themselves, who are unwilling to be drawn\nupon to bless others by friendly associations, lose many blessings;\nfor by mutual contact minds receive polish and refinement; by social\nintercourse acquaintances are formed and friendships contracted\nwhich result in a unity of heart and an atmosphere of love which is\npleasing in the sight of heaven.\nEspecially should those who have tasted the love of Christ de-\nvelop their social powers, for in this way they may win souls to the\nSaviour. Christ should not be hid away in their hearts, shut in as a[458]\ncoveted treasure, sacred and sweet, to be enjoyed solely by them-\nselves; nor should the love of Christ be manifested toward those only\nwho please their fancy. Students are to be taught the Christlikeness\nof exhibiting a kindly interest, a social disposition, toward those who\nare in the greatest need, even though these may not be their own\nchosen companions. At all times and in all places Jesus manifested\na loving interest in the human family and shed about Him the light\nof a cheerful piety.8\n1Education, 41.\n2Testimonies for the Church 4:587.\n3Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 220.\n4Ibid., 221.\n5Testimonies for the Church 4:587.\n6Testimonies for the Church 5:112.\n7Testimonies for the Church 4:624.\n8Testimonies for the Church 6:172, 173.\nChapter 74\u2014Safe And Unsafe Associations [459]\nThings Which Influence Us and Our Children\u2014Every asso-\nciation we form, however limited, exerts some influence upon us.\nThe extent to which we yield to that influence will be determined\nby the degree of intimacy, the constancy of the intercourse, and our\nlove and veneration for the one with whom we associate.1\nIf we place ourselves among associates whose influence has a\ntendency to make us forgetful of the high claims the Lord has upon\nus, we invite temptation and become too weak in moral power to\nresist it. We come to partake of the spirit and cherish the ideas of\nour associates and to place sacred and eternal things lower than the\nideas of our friends. We are, in short, leavened just as the enemy of\nall righteousness designed we should be.\nThe young, if brought under this influence, are more easily af-\nfected by it than those who are older. Everything leaves its impress\nupon their minds\u2014the countenances they look upon, the voices they\nhear, the places they visit, the company they keep, and the books\nthey read. It is impossible to overestimate the importance for this\nworld and the next of the associations we choose for ourselves and,\nmore especially, for our children.2\nDangers of Associating With the Ungodly\u2014The world is not\nto be our criterion. We are not to associate with the ungodly and\npartake of their spirit, for they will lead the heart away from God to\nthe worship of false gods. The steadfast soul, firm in the faith, can\ndo much good; he can impart blessings of the highest order to those\nwith whom he associates, for the law of the Lord is in his heart. But [460]\nwe cannot willingly associate with those who are trampling upon\nthe law of God, and preserve our faith pure and untarnished. We\nshall catch the spirit, and unless we separate from them, we shall be\nbound up with them at last, to share their doom.3\nIt was by associating with idolaters and joining in their festivities\nthat the Hebrews were led to transgress God\u2019s law and bring His\njudgments upon the nation. So now it is by leading the followers of\n361\n362 The Adventist Home\nChrist to associate with the ungodly and unite in their amusements\nthat Satan is most successful in alluring them into sin. \u201cCome out\nfrom among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not\nthe unclean.\u201d God requires of His people now as great a distinction\nfrom the world, in customs, habits, and principles, as He required of\nIsrael anciently.4\nSamson\u2019s Willful Choice\u2014God\u2019s providential care had been\nover Samson, that he might be prepared to accomplish the work\nwhich he was called to do. At the very outset of life he was sur-\nrounded with favorable conditions for physical strength, intellectual\nvigor, and moral purity. But under the influence of wicked associates\nhe let go that hold upon God which is man\u2019s only safeguard, and he\nwas swept away by the tide of evil. Those who in the way of duty\nare brought into trial may be sure that God will preserve them; but if\nmen willfully place themselves under the power of temptation, they\nwill fall sooner or later.5\nThe Insidious Leaven of Wickedness\u2014Dear students, day and\nnight the prayers of your parents will follow you. Listen to their\nentreaties and warnings, and do not choose reckless associates. You\ncannot discern how the leaven of wickedness will insidiously corrupt\nyour mind and impair your habits and, by leading you to repeat evil[461]\nhabits, cause you to develop an unsound character. You may see no\nreal danger and think that you will be able to do right as easily as\nbefore you yielded to temptation to do wrong, but this is a mistake.\nParents and teachers who love and fear God may warn and entreat\nand counsel, but it may all be in vain if you do not yield yourself to\nGod and improve the talents which He has given you to His glory.6\nBeware of Those Indifferent to Religion\u2014If children are with\nthose whose conversation is upon unimportant, earthly things, their\nminds will come to the same level. If they hear the principles of\nreligion slurred and our faith belittled, if sly objections to the truth\nare dropped in their hearing, these things will fasten in their minds\nand mold their characters.7\nNothing can more effectually prevent or banish serious impres-\nsions and good desires than association with vain, careless, and\ncorrupt-minded persons. Whatever attractions such persons may\npossess by their wit, sarcasm, and fun, the fact that they treat reli-\ngion with levity and indifference is sufficient reason why they should\nSafe And Unsafe Associations 363\nnot be associated with. The more engaging they are in other respects,\nthe more should their influence be dreaded as companions because\nthey throw around an irreligious life so many dangerous attractions.8\nWorldly associations attract and dazzle the senses so that piety,\nthe fear of God, faithfulness, and loyalty have not power to keep men\nsteadfast. The humble, unassuming life of Christ seems altogether\nunattractive. To many who claim to be sons and daughters of God,\nJesus, the Majesty of heaven, is \u201cas a root out of a dry ground: He\nhath no form nor comeliness.\u201d9\nDo Not Center Affections on Worldly Relatives\u2014We cannot [462]\nserve God and the world at the same time. We must not center\nour affections on worldly relatives, who have no desire to learn\nthe truth. We may seek in every way, while associated with them,\nto let our light shine; but our words, our deportment, our customs\nand practices, should not in any sense be molded by their ideas and\ncustoms. We are to show forth the truth in all our intercourse with\nthem. If we cannot do this, the less association we have with them\nthe better it will be for our spirituality.10\nShun Those With Low Standards, Loose Morals\u2014It is wrong\nfor Christians to associate with those whose morals are loose. An\nintimate, daily intercourse which occupies time without contributing\nin any degree to the strength of the intellect or morals is dangerous. If\nthe moral atmosphere surrounding persons is not pure and sanctified,\nbut is tainted with corruption, those who breathe this atmosphere will\nfind that it operates almost insensibly upon the intellect and heart\nto poison and to ruin. It is dangerous to be conversant with those\nwhose minds naturally take a low level. Gradually and imperceptibly\nthose who are naturally conscientious and love purity will come to\nthe same level and partake of and sympathize with the imbecility\nand moral barrenness with which they are so constantly brought in\ncontact.11\nA good name is more precious than gold. There is an inclination\nwith the youth to associate with those who are inferior in mind\nand morals. What real happiness can a young person expect from\na voluntary connection with persons who have a low standard of\nthoughts, feelings, and deportment? Some are debased in taste and\ndepraved in habits, and all who choose such companions will follow [463]\n364 The Adventist Home\ntheir example. We are living in times of peril that should cause the\nhearts of all to fear.12\nMany Yield to Temptation Through Fear of Ridicule\u2014Chil-\ndren ... should have companions who will not ridicule what is pure\nand worthy, but will rather advocate what is right. The fear of ridicule\nleads many a youth to yield to temptation and to walk in the way\nof the ungodly. Mothers may do much by example as well as by\nprecept to show their children how to be upright amid scorn and\nridicule.13\nWhy do our youth not consider that those who are ready to lead\nothers into forbidden paths are easily overcome by temptation and\nare Satan\u2019s agents to encourage disorderly habits, to laugh at those\nwho are conscientious and who would preserve their integrity of\ncharacter?14\nLive Before Strangers As You Would Before God \u2014Young\nfriends, do not spend an hour in the company of those who would\nunfit you for the pure and sacred work of God. Do nothing before\nstrangers that you would not do before your father and mother, or\nthat you would be ashamed of before Christ and the holy angels.\nSome may think these cautions are not needed by Sabbathkeep-\ners, but those to whom they apply know what I mean. I tell you,\nyoung men, to beware; for you can do nothing that is not open to\nthe eyes of angels and of God. You cannot do an evil work and\nothers not be affected by it. While your course of action reveals\nwhat kind of material is used in your own character building, it also\nhas a powerful influence over others. Never lose sight of the fact\nthat you belong to God, that He has bought you with a price, and\nyou must render an account to Him for all His entrusted talents.15\nSpecial Help Is Promised When Needed\u2014We are not to place[464]\nour children where they must associate with the depraved and de-\ngraded. Sometimes God in His providence may bring our youth into\nassociation with those who are impure and intemperate. He will give\nthem strength of purpose and power to resist temptation, even as\nHe did Daniel and his associates in Babylon, if they will co-operate\nwith Him. They must constantly commune with God. They must\nkeep themselves pure, refusing to do anything that would dishonor\nGod, living always with an eye single to His glory. They must watch\nSafe And Unsafe Associations 365\nfor souls, laboring earnestly for those in whom the image of God has\nbeen defaced, seeking to reform, to elevate, and to ennoble them.16\nChoose Thoughtful, Serious Companions \u2014The youth who\nare in harmony with Christ will choose companions who will help\nthem in right doing, and will shun society that gives no aid in the\ndevelopment of right principles and noble purposes. In every place\nare to be found youth whose minds are cast in an inferior mold.\nWhen brought into association with this class, those who have placed\nthemselves without reserve on the side of Christ will stand firmly by\nthat which reason and conscience tell them is right.17\nLet all who would form a right character choose associates who\nare of a serious, thoughtful turn of mind and who are religiously\ninclined. Those who have counted the cost and wish to build for\neternity must put good material into their building. If they accept of\nrotten timbers, if they are content with deficiencies of character, the\nbuilding is doomed to ruin. Let all take heed how they build. The\nstorm of temptation will sweep over the building, and unless it is [465]\nfirmly and faithfully constructed, it will not stand the test.18\nBy association with those who walk according to principle, even\nthe careless will learn to love righteousness. And by the practice of\nright doing there will be created in the heart a distaste for that which\nis cheap and common and at variance with the principles of God\u2019s\nword.19\n1Testimonies for the Church 5:222, 223.\n2Ibid., 543.\n3Manuscript 6, 1892.\n4Patriarchs and Prophets, 458.\n5Ibid., 568.\n6The Youth\u2019s Instructor, January 18, 1894.\n7Testimonies for the Church 5:545.\n8Ibid., 3:126.\n9Manuscript 6, 1892.\n10Testimonies for the Church 5:543.\n11Testimonies for the Church 3:125.\n12Testimonies for the Church 4:588.\n13The Review and Herald, March 31, 1891.\n14The Youth\u2019s Instructor, January 18, 1894.\n15Testimonies for the Church 5:398, 399.\n16Manuscript 18, 1892.\n17Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 226.\n366 The Adventist Home\n18Testimonies for the Church 4:588.\n19Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 222.\nChapter 75\u2014Parental Guidance In Social Affairs [466]\nEvil Influences Almost Overpowering \u2014The evil influence\naround our children is almost overpowering; it is corrupting their\nminds and leading them down to perdition. The minds of youth are\nnaturally given to folly; and at an early age, before their characters\nare formed and their judgment matured, they frequently manifest a\npreference for associates who will have an injurious influence over\nthem.1\nCould my voice reach the parents all through the land, I would\nwarn them not to yield to the desires of their children in choosing\ntheir companions or associates. Little do parents consider that injuri-\nous impressions are far more readily received by the young than are\ndivine impressions; therefore their associations should be the most\nfavorable for the growth of grace and for the truth revealed in the\nword of God to be established in the heart.2\nLet the youth be placed in the most favorable circumstances\npossible; for the company they keep, the principles they adopt, the\nhabits they form, will settle the question of their usefulness here and\nof their future, eternal interests with a certainty that is infallible.3\nThe Peril of Unlimited Freedom \u2014Parents, your sons and\ndaughters are not properly guarded. They should never be per-\nmitted to go and come when they please, without your knowledge\nand consent. The unbounded freedom granted to children at this\nage has proved the ruin of thousands. How many are allowed to be [467]\nin the streets at night, and parents are content to be ignorant of the\nassociates of their children. Too often companions are chosen whose\ninfluence tends only to demoralize.\nUnder the cover of darkness boys collect in groups to learn their\nfirst lessons in card playing, gambling, smoking, and wine or beer\nsipping. The sons of religious parents venture into the saloons for an\noyster supper or some similar indulgence, and thus place themselves\nin the way of temptation. The very atmosphere of these resorts is\nredolent with blasphemy and pollution. No one can long remain\n367\n368 The Adventist Home\nin it without becoming corrupted. It is by such associations that\npromising youth are becoming inebriates and criminals. The very\nbeginnings of the evil should be guarded against. Parents, unless you\nknow that their surroundings are unexceptionable, do not permit your\nchildren to go into the streets after nightfall to engage in outdoor\nsports or to meet other boys for amusement. If this rule be rigidly\nenforced, obedience to it will become habitual, and the desire to\ntransgress will soon cease.4\nParents Must Choose the Child\u2019s Associates\u2014Parents should\nremember that association with those of lax morals and coarseness\nof character will have a detrimental influence upon the youth. If they\nfail to choose proper society for their children, if they allow them\nto associate with youth of questionable morals, they place them,\nor permit them to place themselves, in a school where lessons of\ndepravity are taught and practiced. They may feel that their children\nare strong enough to withstand temptation, but how can they be sure\nof this? It is far easier to yield to evil influences than to resist them.\nEre they are aware of it, their children may become imbued with the[468]\nspirit of their associates and may be degraded or ruined.5\nThe dangers of the young are greatly increased as they are thrown\ninto the society of a large number of their own age, of varied charac-\nter and habits of life. Under these circumstances many parents are\ninclined to relax rather than redouble their own efforts to guard and\ncontrol their children.6\nPrayerfully, unitedly, the father and the mother should bear the\ngrave responsibility of guiding their children aright. Whatever else\nthey neglect, they should never leave their children free to wander\nin paths of sin. Many parents allow children to go and do as they\nplease, amusing themselves and choosing evil associates. In the\njudgment such parents will learn that their children have lost heaven\nbecause they have not been kept under home restraint.7\nWhere Are the Evenings Spent? \u2014Every son and daughter\nshould be called to account if absent from home at night. Parents\nshould know what company their children are in and at whose house\nthey spend their evenings. Some children deceive their parents with\nfalsehoods to avoid exposure of their wrong course.8\nWeeds Predominate in an Uncultivated Field \u2014Fathers and\nmothers too often leave their children to choose for themselves their\nParental Guidance In Social Affairs 369\namusements, their companions, and their occupation. The result\nis such as might reasonably be expected. Leave a field unculti-\nvated, and it will grow up to thorns and briers. You will never see\na lovely flower or a choice shrub peering above the unsightly, poi-\nsonous weeds. The worthless bramble will grow luxuriantly without\nthought or care, while plants that are valued for use or beauty require [469]\nthorough culture. Thus it is with our youth. If right habits are formed\nand right principles established, there is earnest work to be done. If\nwrong habits are corrected, diligence and perseverance are required\nto accomplish the task.9\nAccustom Child to Trust Parents\u2019 Judgment\u2014Parents, guard\nthe principles and habits of your children as the apple of the eye.\nAllow them to associate with no one with whose character you are\nnot well acquainted. Permit them to form no intimacy until you\nare assured that it will do them no harm. Accustom your children\nto trust your judgment and experience. Teach them that you have\nclearer perception of character than they in their inexperience can\nhave, and that your decisions must not be disregarded.10\nThe Restraint to Be Firm, but Kind\u2014The parents should not\nconcede to the inclinations of their children, but should follow the\nplain path of duty which God has marked out, restraining them in\nkindness, denying with firmness and determination, yet with love,\ntheir wrong desires, and with earnest, prayerful, persevering effort\nleading their steps away from the world upward to heaven. Children\nshould not be left to drift into whatever way they are inclined, and\nto go into avenues which are open on every side, leading away from\nthe right path. None are in so great danger as those who apprehend\nno danger and are impatient of caution and counsel.11\nGuard your children from every objectionable influence possible;\nfor in childhood they are more ready to receive impressions, either\nof moral dignity, purity, and loveliness of character, or of selfishness,\nimpurity, and disobedience. Once let them become influenced by\nthe spirit of murmuring, pride, vanity, and impurity, and the taint [470]\nmay be as indelible as life itself.12\nIt is because the home training is defective that the youth are\nso unwilling to submit to proper authority. I am a mother; I know\nwhereof I speak when I say that youth and children are not only\n370 The Adventist Home\nsafer but happier under wholesome restraint than when following\ntheir own inclination.13\nUnaccompanied Visits Inadvisable\u2014Some parents mistake in\ngiving their children too much liberty. They sometimes have so\nmuch confidence in them that they do not see their faults. It is wrong\nto allow children, at some expense, to visit at a distance, unaccom-\npanied by their parents or guardians. It has a wrong influence upon\nthe children. They come to feel that they are of considerable conse-\nquence and that certain privileges belong to them, and if these are\nnot granted, they think themselves abused. They refer to children\nwho go and come and have many privileges, while they have so few.\nAnd the mother, fearing that her children will think her unjust,\ngratifies their wishes, which in the end proves a great injury to them.\nYoung visitors, who have not a parent\u2019s watchful eye over them to\nsee and correct their faults, often receive impressions which it will\ntake months to remove.14\nUnwise Advice and How to Meet It \u2014Keep your children at\ntheir home; and if people say to you, \u201cYour children will not know\nhow to conduct themselves in the world,\u201d tell your friends that you\nare not so concerned about that matter, but that you do want to take\nthem to the Master for His blessing, even as the mothers of old\ntook their children to Jesus. Say to your advisers: Children are the[471]\nheritage of the Lord, and I want to prove faithful to my trust.... My\nchildren must be brought up in such a way that they shall not be\nswayed by the influences of the world, but where, when tempted to\nsin, they may be able to say a square, hearty no.\u201d ...Tell your friends\nand neighbors that you want to see your family inside the gates of\nthe beautiful city.15\nPowerful Tests Are Before Our Youth\u2014Children should be\ntrained and educated so that they may calculate to meet with diffi-\nculties and expect temptations and dangers. They should be taught\nto have control over themselves and to nobly overcome difficulties;\nand if they do not willfully rush into danger and needlessly place\nthemselves in the way of temptation, if they avoid evil influences\nand vicious society, and then are unavoidably compelled to be in\ndangerous company, they will have strength of character to stand for\nthe right and preserve principle and will come forth in the strength\nof God with their morals untainted. The moral powers of youth who\nParental Guidance In Social Affairs 371\nhave been properly educated, if they make God their trust, will be\nequal to stand the most powerful test.16\n1Testimonies for the Church 1:400, 401.\n2Ibid., 5:544, 545.\n3Ibid., 5:545.\n4Fundamentals of Christian Education, 63.\n5Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 120.\n6Ibid., 332.\n7The Review and Herald, September 8, 1904.\n8Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 332, 333.\n9The Review and Herald, September 13, 1881.\n10Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 120.\n11Testimonies for the Church 5:545, 546.\n12The Signs of the Times, April 16, 1896.\n13Fundamentals of Christian Education, 62, 63.\n14Testimonies for the Church 1:401, 402.\n15The Signs of the Times, April 23, 1894.\n16The Health Reformer, December, 1872.\nChapter 76\u2014Holidays And Anniversaries[472]\nThe Need of Guidance in Holiday Observance \u2014I saw that\nour holidays should not be spent in patterning after the world, yet\nthey should not be passed by unnoticed, for this will bring dissatis-\nfaction to our children. On these days when there is danger that our\nchildren will be exposed to evil influences and become corrupted by\nthe pleasures and excitement of the world, let the parents study to get\nup something to take the place of more dangerous amusements. Give\nyour children to understand that you have their good and happiness\nin view.1\nThrough the observance of holidays the people both of the world\nand of the churches have been educated to believe that these lazy\ndays are essential to health and happiness, but the results reveal that\nthey are full of evil.2\nWe have tried earnestly to make the holidays as interesting as\npossible to the youth and children, while changing this order of\nthings. Our object has been to keep them away from scenes of\namusement among unbelievers.3\nShall the Angel Record, \u201cA Day Lost?\u201d\u2014After a day of plea-\nsure seeking is ended, where is the satisfaction to the pleasure\nseeker? As Christian workers, whom have they helped to a bet-\nter, higher, and purer life? What would they see if they should look\nover the record the angel wrote? A day lost! To their own souls a\nday lost, a day lost in the service of Christ, because no good was\naccomplished. They may have other days but never that day which\nwas idled away in cheap, foolish talk, of girls with boys, and boys\nwith girls.\nNever will these same opportunities offer themselves again. They[473]\nhad better been doing the hardest kind of labor on that holiday. They\ndid not make the right use of their holiday, and it passed into eternity\nto confront them in the judgment as a day misspent.4\nBirthdays\u2014a Time to Praise God \u2014Under the Jewish econ-\nomy on the birth of children an offering was made to God, by\n372\nHolidays And Anniversaries 373\nHis own appointment. Now we see parents taking special pains to\npresent gifts to their children upon their birthdays; they make this\nan occasion of honoring the child, as though honor were due to the\nhuman being. Satan has had his own way in these things; he has\ndiverted the minds and the gifts to human beings; thus the thoughts\nof the children are turned to themselves, as if they were to be made\nthe objects of special favor....\nOn birthday occasions the children should be taught that they\nhave reason for gratitude to God for His loving-kindness in preserv-\ning their lives for another year. Precious lessons might thus be given.\nFor life, health, food, and clothing, no less than for the hope of eter-\nnal life, we are indebted to the Giver of all mercies; and it is due to\nGod to recognize His gifts and to present our offerings of gratitude\nto our greatest benefactor. These birthday gifts are recognized of\nHeaven.5\nA Time to Review the Year\u2019s Record\u2014Teach them to review\nthe past year of their life, to consider whether they would be glad to\nmeet its record just as it stands in the books of heaven. Encourage in\nthem serious thoughts, whether their deportment, their words, their\nworks, are of a character pleasing to God. Have they been making\ntheir lives more like Jesus, beautiful and lovely in the sight of God? [474]\nTeach them the knowledge of the Lord, His ways, His precepts.6\nMaking God\u2019s Cause First\u2014I have said to my family and my\nfriends, I desire that no one shall make me a birthday or Christmas\ngift, unless it be with permission to pass it on into the Lord\u2019s treasury,\nto be appropriated in the establishment of missions.7\nHow Shall We Observe Thanksgiving? \u2014Our Thanksgiving\nis approaching. Will it be, as it has been in many instances, a\nthanksgiving to ourselves? Or will it be a thanksgiving to God? Our\nThanksgivings may be made seasons of great profit to our own souls\nas well as to others if we improve this opportunity to remember the\npoor among us....\nThere are a hundred ways that can be devised to help the poor\nin so delicate a manner as to make them feel that they are doing us\na favor by receiving our gifts and sympathy. We are to remember\nthat it is more blessed to give than to receive. The attentions of our\nbrethren are most liberal to those whom they wish to honor, and\nwhose respect they desire, but who do not need their help at all.\n374 The Adventist Home\nCustom and fashion say, Give to those who will give to you; but this\nis not the Bible rule of giving. The word of God declares against\nthis way of gratifying self in thus bestowing our gifts, and says, \u201cHe\nthat giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.\u201d\nNow a season is coming when we shall have our principles tested.\nLet us begin to think what we can do for God\u2019s needy ones. We\ncan make them through ourselves the recipients of God\u2019s blessings.\nThink what widow, what orphan, what poor family you can relieve,\nnot in a way to make a great parade about the matter, but be as a\nchannel through which the Lord\u2019s substance shall flow as a blessing[475]\nto His poor....\nBut this does not embrace all your duty. Make an offering to\nyour best Friend; acknowledge His bounties; show your gratitude\nfor His favors; bring a thank offering to God.... Brethren and sisters,\neat a plain dinner on Thanksgiving Day, and with the money you\nwould spend in extras with which to indulge the appetite, make a\nthank offering to God.8\nLet not any more Thanksgiving days be observed to please and\ngratify the appetite and glorify self. We have reason for coming\ninto the courts of the Lord with offerings of gratitude that He has\npreserved our lives another year.... If a feast is to be made, let it be\nfor those who are in need.9\nA Day to Give Thanks [Note: Part of a thanksgiving sermon\ndelivered at the Battle Creek Tabernacle, Nov. 27, 1884.]\u2014I think\nwe have something to be thankful for. We ought to be glad and\nrejoice in God, for He has given us many mercies.... We want this\nThanksgiving to be all that it implies. Do not let it be perverted,\nmingled with dross; but let it be what its name implies\u2014giving\nthanks. Let our voices ascend in praise.10\nWhy Not Holidays Unto God?\u2014Would it not be well for us to\nobserve holidays unto God, when we could revive in our minds the\nmemory of His dealing with us? Would it not be well to consider\nHis past blessings, to remember the impressive warnings that have\ncome home to our souls so that we shall not forget God?\nThe world has many holidays, and men become engrossed with[476]\ngames, with horse races, with gambling, smoking, and drunken-\nness....\nHolidays And Anniversaries 375\nShall not the people of God more frequently have holy convoca-\ntions in which to thank God for His rich blessings?11\nHolidays Afford Opportunity for Missionary Service \u2014We\nwant men in the church who have ability to develop in the line of\norganizing and giving practical work to young men and women\nin the line of relieving the wants of humanity and working for the\nsalvation of the souls of men, women, youth, and children. It will\nnot be possible for all to give their whole time to the work because\nof the labor they must do to earn their daily living. Yet these have\ntheir holidays and times that they can devote to Christian work and\ndo good in this way if they cannot give much of their means.12\nWhen you have a holiday, make it a pleasant and happy day for\nyour children, and make it also a pleasant day for the poor and the\nafflicted. Do not let the day pass without bringing thanksgiving and\nthank offerings to Jesus.13\n1Testimonies for the Church 1:514, 515.\n2Fundamentals of Christian Education, 317.\n3The Review and Herald, January 29, 1884.\n4Letter 12, 1892.\n5The Review and Herald, December 9, 1890.\n6The Review and Herald, December 23, 1884.\n7The Review and Herald, December 27, 1906.\n8The Review and Herald, November 18, 1884.\n9The Review and Herald, December 23, 1884.\n10Ibid.\n11Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 343.\n12Letter 12, 1892.\n13The Review and Herald, November 13, 1894.\nChapter 77\u2014Christmas[477]\nChristmas as a Holiday \u2014\u201cChristmas is coming,\u201d is the note\nthat is sounded throughout our world from east to west and from\nnorth to south. With youth, those of mature age, and even the aged,\nit is a period of general rejoicing, of great gladness. But what is\nChristmas, that it should demand so much attention? ...\nThe twenty-fifth of December is supposed to be the day of the\nbirth of Jesus Christ, and its observance has become customary\nand popular. But yet there is no certainty that we are keeping the\nveritable day of our Saviour\u2019s birth. History gives us no certain\nassurance of this. The Bible does not give us the precise time. Had\nthe Lord deemed this knowledge essential to our salvation, He would\nhave spoken through His prophets and apostles, that we might know\nall about the matter. But the silence of the Scriptures upon this point\nevidences to us that it is hidden from us for the wisest purposes.\nIn His wisdom the Lord concealed the place where He buried\nMoses. God buried him, and God resurrected him and took him to\nheaven. This secrecy was to prevent idolatry. He against whom they\nrebelled while he was in active service, whom they provoked almost\nbeyond human endurance, was almost worshiped as God after his\nseparation from them by death. For the very same purpose He has\nconcealed the precise day of Christ\u2019s birth, that the day should not\nreceive the honor that should be given to Christ as the Redeemer of\nthe world\u2014one to be received, to be trusted, to be relied on as He\nwho could save to the uttermost all who come unto Him. The soul\u2019s\nadoration should be given to Jesus as the Son of the infinite God.1[478]\nThe Day Not to Be Ignored\u2014As the twenty-fifth of December\nis observed to commemorate the birth of Christ, as the children have\nbeen instructed by precept and example that this was indeed a day\nof gladness and rejoicing, you will find it a difficult matter to pass\nover this period without giving it some attention. It can be made to\nserve a very good purpose.\n376\nChristmas 377\nThe youth should be treated very carefully. They should not\nbe left on Christmas to find their own amusement in vanity and\npleasure seeking, in amusements which will be detrimental to their\nspirituality. Parents can control this matter by turning the minds and\nthe offerings of their children to God and His cause and the salvation\nof souls.\nThe desire for amusement, instead of being quenched and arbi-\ntrarily ruled down, should be controlled and directed by painstaking\neffort upon the part of the parents. Their desire to make gifts may\nbe turned into pure and holy channels and made to result in good to\nour fellow men by supplying the treasury in the great, grand work\nfor which Christ came into our world. Self-denial and self-sacrifice\nmarked His course of action. Let it mark ours who profess to love\nJesus because in Him is centered our hope of eternal life.2\nThe Interchange of Gifts as Tokens of Affection \u2014The holi-\nday season is fast approaching with its interchange of gifts, and old\nand young are intently studying what they can bestow upon their\nfriends as a token of affectionate remembrance. It is pleasant to\nreceive a gift, however small, from those we love. It is an assur-\nance that we are not forgotten, and seems to bind us to them a little [479]\ncloser....\nIt is right to bestow upon one another tokens of love and remem-\nbrance if we do not in this forget God, our best friend. We should\nmake our gifts such as will prove a real benefit to the receiver. I\nwould recommend such books as will be an aid in understanding the\nword of God or that will increase our love for its precepts. Provide\nsomething to be read during these long winter evenings.3\nBooks for Children Are Recommended\u2014There are many who\nhave not books and publications upon present truth. Here is a large\nfield where money can be safely invested. There are large numbers\nof little ones who should be supplied with reading. The Sunshine\nSeries, Golden Grains Series, Poems, Sabbath Readings, [Note:\nReference is made in this article to noncurrent publications. As the\nprinciples set forth in this connection are applicable today, these\nspecific references are left in the article.] etc., are all precious books\nand may be introduced safely into every family. The many trifles\nusually spent on candies and useless toys may be treasured up with\nwhich to buy these volumes....\n378 The Adventist Home\nLet those who wish to make valuable presents to their children,\ngrandchildren, nephews, and nieces procure for them the children\u2019s\nbooks mentioned above. For young people the Life of Joseph Bates\nis a treasure; also the three volumes ofThe Spirit of Prophecy. [Note:\nEarly E. G. White books preceding the present \u201cConflict Of The\nAges Series.\u201d] These volumes should be placed in every family in\nthe land. God is giving light from heaven, and not a family should\nbe without it. Let the presents you shall make be of that order which[480]\nwill shed beams of light upon the pathway to heaven.4\nJesus Not to Be Forgotten\u2014Brethren and sisters, while you are\ndevising gifts for one another, I would remind you of our heavenly\nFriend, lest you should be unmindful of His claims. Will He not\nbe pleased if we show that we have not forgotten Him? Jesus, the\nPrince of life, gave all to bring salvation within our reach.... He\nsuffered even unto death, that He might give us eternal life.\nIt is through Christ that we receive every blessing.... Shall not\nour heavenly Benefactor share in the tokens of our gratitude and\nlove? Come, brethren and sisters, come with your children, even the\nbabes in your arms, and bring your offerings to God according to\nyour ability. Make melody to Him in your hearts, and let His praise\nbe upon your lips.5\nChristmas\u2014a Time to Honor God \u2014By the world the holi-\ndays are spent in frivolity and extravagance, gluttony and display....\nThousands of dollars will be worse than thrown away upon the com-\ning Christmas and New Year\u2019s in needless indulgences. But it is our\nprivilege to depart from the customs and practices of this degenerate\nage; and instead of expending means merely for the gratification\nof the appetite or for needless ornaments or articles of clothing, we\nmay make the coming holidays an occasion in which to honor and\nglorify God.6\nChrist should be the supreme object; but as Christmas has been\nobserved, the glory is turned from Him to mortal man, whose sinful,\ndefective character made it necessary for Him to come to our world.\nJesus, the Majesty of heaven, the royal King of heaven, laid aside[481]\nHis royalty, left His throne of glory, His high command, and came\ninto our world to bring to fallen man, weakened in moral power and\ncorrupted by sin, aid divine....\nChristmas 379\nParents should keep these things before their children and instruct\nthem, line upon line, precept upon precept, in their obligation to\nGod\u2014not their obligation to each other, to honor and glorify one\nanother by gifts and offerings.7\nTurn Thoughts of the Children Into a New Channel\u2014There\nare many things which can be devised with taste and cost far less than\nthe unnecessary presents that are so frequently bestowed upon our\nchildren and relatives, and thus courtesy can be shown and happiness\nbrought into the home.\nYou can teach your children a lesson while you explain to them\nthe reason why you have made a change in the value of their presents,\ntelling them that you are convinced that you have hitherto considered\ntheir pleasure more than the glory of God. Tell them that you have\nthought more of your own pleasure and of their gratification and of\nkeeping in harmony with the customs and traditions of the world,\nin making presents to those who did not need them, than you have\nof advancing the cause of God. Like the wise men of old, you may\noffer to God your best gifts and show by your offerings to Him\nthat you appreciate His Gift to a sinful world. Set your children\u2019s\nthoughts running in a new, unselfish channel by inciting them to\npresent offerings to God for the gift of His only-begotten Son.8\n\u201cShall We Have a Christmas Tree?\u201d \u2014God would be well [482]\npleased if on Christmas each church would have a Christmas tree on\nwhich shall be hung offerings, great and small, for these houses of\nworship. [Note: Reference is made in this article to current building\nprojects. As the principles set forth in this connection are applicable\ntoday, these specific references are left in the article.] Letters of\ninquiry have come to us asking, Shall we have a Christmas tree?\nWill it not be like the world? We answer, You can make it like\nthe world if you have a disposition to do so, or you can make it as\nunlike the world as possible. There is no particular sin in selecting a\nfragrant evergreen and placing it in our churches, but the sin lies in\nthe motive which prompts to action and the use which is made of\nthe gifts placed upon the tree.\nThe tree may be as tall and its branches as wide as shall best suit\nthe occasion; but let its boughs be laden with the golden and silver\nfruit of your beneficence, and present this to Him as your Christmas\ngift. Let your donations be sanctified by prayer.9\n380 The Adventist Home\nChristmas and New Year celebrations can and should be held in\nbehalf of those who are helpless. God is glorified when we give to\nhelp those who have large families to support.10\nA Tree Laden With Offerings Is Not Sinful\u2014Let not the par-\nents take the position that an evergreen placed in the church for the\namusement of the Sabbath school scholars is a sin, for it may be\nmade a great blessing. Keep before their minds benevolent objects.\nIn no case should mere amusement be the object of these gather-\nings. While there may be some who will turn these occasions into\nseasons of careless levity, and whose minds will not receive the\ndivine impress, to other minds and characters these seasons will be[483]\nhighly beneficial. I am fully satisfied that innocent substitutes can\nbe devised for many gatherings that demoralize.11\nProvide Innocent Enjoyment for the Day\u2014Will you not arise,\nmy Christian brethren and sisters, and gird yourselves for duty in\nthe fear of God, so arranging this matter that it shall not be dry\nand uninteresting, but full of innocent enjoyment that shall bear the\nsignet of Heaven? I know the poorer class will respond to these\nsuggestions. The most wealthy should also show an interest and\nbestow their gifts and offerings proportionate to the means with\nwhich God has entrusted them. Let there be recorded in the heavenly\nbooks such a Christmas as has never yet been seen because of the\ndonations which shall be given for the sustaining of the work of God\nand the upbuilding of His kingdom.12\n1The Review and Herald, December 9, 1884.\n2Ibid.\n3The Review and Herald, December 26, 1882.\n4The Review and Herald, December 11, 1879.\n5The Review and Herald, December 26, 1882.\n6The Review and Herald, December 11, 1879.\n7The Review and Herald, December 9, 1884.\n8The Review and Herald, November 13, 1894.\n9The Review and Herald, December 11, 1879.\n10Manuscript 13, 1896.\n11The Review and Herald, December 9, 1884.\n12Ibid.\nChapter 78\u2014The Family a Missionary Center [484]\nParents Should Give Children Right Direction \u2014With us as\nparents and as Christians it rests to give our children right direc-\ntion. They are to be carefully, wisely, tenderly guided into paths of\nChristlike ministry. We are under sacred covenant with God to rear\nour children for His service. To surround them with such influences\nas shall lead them to choose a life of service, and to give them the\ntraining needed, is our first duty.1\nChildren May Be Daniels and Esthers Today\u2014God\u2019s purpose\nfor the children growing up beside our hearths is wider, deeper,\nhigher, than our restricted vision has comprehended. From the\nhumblest lot those whom He has seen faithful have in time past been\ncalled to witness for Him in the world\u2019s highest places. And many a\nlad of today, growing up as did Daniel in his Judean home, studying\nGod\u2019s word and His works, and learning the lessons of faithful\nservice, will yet stand in legislative assemblies, in halls of justice,\nor in royal courts as a witness for the King of kings. Multitudes\nwill be called to a wider ministry. The whole world is opening to\nthe gospel.... From every quarter of this world of ours comes the\ncry of sin-stricken hearts for a knowledge of the God of love.... It\nrests with us who have received the knowledge, with our children\nto whom we may impart it, to answer their cry. To every household\nand every school, to every parent, teacher, and child upon whom has\nshone the light of the gospel, comes at this crisis the question put to\nEsther the queen at that momentous crisis in Israel\u2019s history, \u201cWho [485]\nknoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as\nthis?\u201d2\nSuccessful Ways of Witnessing for Christ\u2014Not all can go as\nmissionaries to foreign lands, but all can be home missionaries in\ntheir families and neighborhoods. There are many ways in which\nchurch members may give the message to those around them. One\nof the most successful is by living helpful, unselfish Christian lives.\nThose who are fighting the battle of life at great odds may be re-\n381\n382 The Adventist Home\nfreshed and strengthened by little attentions which cost nothing.\nKindly words simply spoken, little attentions simply bestowed, will\nsweep away the clouds of temptation and doubt that gather over the\nsoul. The true heart expression of Christlike sympathy, given in\nsimplicity, has power to open the door of hearts that need the simple,\ndelicate touch of the spirit of Christ.3\nThere is a wide field of service for women as well as for men.\nThe efficient cook, the seamstress, the nurse\u2014the help of all is\nneeded. Let the members of poor households be taught how to\ncook, how to make and mend their own clothing, how to nurse the\nsick, how to care properly for the home. Even the children should\nbe taught to do some little errand of love and mercy for those less\nfortunate than themselves.4\nChildren and Youth to Join in Service for Others\u2014In an ef-\nfort to excuse themselves some say: \u201cMy home duties, my children,\nclaim my time and my means.\u201d Parents, your children should be\nyour helping hand, increasing your power and ability to work for\nthe Master. Children are the younger members of the Lord\u2019s family.\nThey should be led to consecrate themselves to God, whose they are[486]\nby creation and by redemption. They should be taught that all their\npowers of body, mind, and soul are His. They should be trained to\nhelp in various lines of unselfish service. Do not allow your children\nto be hindrances. With you the children should share spiritual as\nwell as physical burdens. By helping others they increase their own\nhappiness and usefulness.5\nIf in every church the young men and the young women would\nsolemnly consecrate themselves to God, if they would practice self-\ndenial in the home life, relieving their tired, careworn mothers,\nwhat a change would take place in our churches! The mother could\nfind time to make neighborly visits. When opportunity offered, the\nchildren could give assistance by doing, when quite young, little\nerrands of mercy and love to bless others. Thus thousands of the\nhomes of the poor and needy not of our faith could be entered.\nBooks relating to health and temperance could be placed in many\nhomes. The circulation of these books is an important work; for they\ncontain precious knowledge in regard to the treatment of disease\u2014\nknowledge that would be a great blessing to those who cannot afford\nto pay for the physician\u2019s visits.6\nFamily a Missionary Center 383\nGod Wants Children as Little Missionaries\u2014God wants ev-\nery child of tender age to be His child, to be adopted into His family.\nYoung though they may be, the youth may be members of the house-\nhold of faith and have a most precious experience.7\nIn their early years children may be useful in God\u2019s work.... He\nwill give them His grace and His Holy Spirit, that they may overcome\nimpatience, fretfulness, and all sin. Jesus loves the children. He\nhas blessings for them, and He loves to see them obedient to their\nparents. He desires them to be His little missionaries, denying their [487]\nown inclinations and desires for selfish pleasure to do service for\nHim; and this service is just as acceptable to God as is the service of\ngrown-up children.8\nBy precept and example parents are to teach their children to\nlabor for the unconverted. The children should be so educated that\nthey will sympathize with the aged and afflicted and will seek to\nalleviate the sufferings of the poor and distressed. They should be\ntaught to be diligent in missionary work; and from their earliest years\nself-denial and sacrifice for the good of others and the advancement\nof Christ\u2019s cause should be inculcated, that they may be laborers\ntogether with God.9\nLet parents teach their little ones the truth as it is in Jesus. The\nchildren in their simplicity will repeat to their associates that which\nthey have learned.10\nThe Church Has Work for the Youth \u2014Let the overseers of\nthe church devise plans whereby young men and women may be\ntrained to put to use their entrusted talents. Let the older members of\nthe church seek to do earnest, compassionate work for the children\nand youth. Let ministers put to use all their ingenuity in devising\nplans whereby the younger members of the church may be led to\nco-operate with them in missionary work. But do not imagine that\nyou can arouse their interest merely by preaching a long sermon at\nthe missionary meeting. Plan ways whereby a live interest may be\nkindled. Let all have a part to act. Train the young to do what is\nappointed them, and from week to week let them bring their reports\nto the missionary meeting, telling what they have experienced and\nthrough the grace of Christ what success has been theirs. If such\nreports were brought in by consecrated workers, the missionary\nmeetings would not be dull and tedious. They would be full of [488]\n384 The Adventist Home\ninterest, and there would be no lack in attendance.11\nSeek Opportunities in the Neighborhood\u2014Opportunities are\nwithin the reach of everyone. Take up the work that should be done in\nyour neighborhood, for which you are held responsible. [Note: For\ndetailed counsel on the methods and effectiveness of neighborhood\nministry of kindness, see Welfare Ministry.\u2014Compilers.] Wait not\nfor others to urge you to take advance steps. Move without delay,\nbearing in mind your individual responsibility to Him who gave His\nlife for you. Move as if you heard Christ calling upon you personally\nto awake out of sleep and to exert every God-given faculty in doing\nthe utmost in His service. Look not to see who else is ready to catch\ninspiration from the word of the living God. If you are thoroughly\nconsecrated, through your instrumentality He will bring into the\ntruth others whom He can use as channels to convey light to many\nsouls in darkness.12\nLet Christian Families Enter Dark Counties .\u2014God calls for\nChristian families to go into communities that are in darkness and\nerror, and work wisely and perseveringly for the Master. To answer\nthis call requires self-sacrifice. While many are waiting to have every\nobstacle removed, souls are dying without hope and without God\nin the world. Many, very many, for the sake of worldly advantage,\nfor the sake of acquiring scientific knowledge, will venture into\npestilential regions and endure hardship and privation. Where are\nthose who are willing to do this for the sake of telling others of the\nSaviour? Where are the men and women who will move into regions[489]\nthat are in need of the gospel, that they may point those in darkness\nto the Redeemer?13\nIf families would locate in the dark places of the earth, places\nwhere the people are enshrouded in spiritual gloom, and let the\nlight of Christ\u2019s life shine out through them, a great work might be\naccomplished. Let them begin their work in a quiet, unobtrusive\nway, not drawing on the funds of the conference until the interest\nbecomes so extensive that they cannot manage it without ministerial\nhelp.14\nChildren Will Work When Others Cannot\u2014When heavenly\nintelligences see that men are no longer permitted to present the\ntruth, the Spirit of God will come upon the children, and they will\nFamily a Missionary Center 385\ndo a work in the proclamation of the truth which the older workers\ncannot do because their way will be hedged up.15\nIn the closing scenes of this earth\u2019s history many of these children\nand youth will astonish people by their witness to the truth, which\nwill be borne in simplicity, yet with spirit and power. They have\nbeen taught the fear of the Lord, and their hearts have been softened\nby a careful and prayerful study of the Bible. In the near future many\nchildren will be endued with the Spirit of God and will do a work in\nproclaiming the truth to the world that at that time cannot well be\ndone by the older members of the church.16\nOur church schools are ordained by God to prepare the children\nfor this great work. Here children are to be instructed in the special\ntruths for this time and in practical missionary work. They are to\nenlist in the army of workers to help the sick and the suffering.\nChildren can take part in the medical missionary work and by their\njots and tittles can help to carry it forward.... By them God\u2019s message [490]\nwill be made known and His saving health to all nations. Then let\nthe church carry a burden for the lambs of the flock. Let the children\nbe educated and trained to do service for God.17\nLearn to Do by Doing \u2014Love and loyalty to Christ are the\nspring of all true service. In the heart touched by His love there is\nbegotten a desire to work for Him. Let this desire be encouraged\nand rightly guided. Whether in the home, the neighborhood, or the\nschool, the presence of the poor, the afflicted, the ignorant, or the\nunfortunate should be regarded, not as a misfortune, but as affording\nprecious opportunity for service.\nIn this work, as in every other, skill is gained in the work itself.\nIt is by training in the common duties of life and in ministry to\nthe needy and suffering that efficiency is assured. Without this the\nbest-meant efforts are often useless and even harmful. It is in the\nwater, not on the land, that men learn to swim.18\n1The Ministry of Healing, 396.\n2Education, 262, 263.\n3Testimonies for the Church 9:30.\n4Ibid., 9:36, 37.\n5Ibid., 7:63.\n6Manuscript 119, 1901.\n7Letter 104, 1897.\n386 The Adventist Home\n8The Review and Herald, November 17, 1896.\n9Testimonies for the Church 6:429.\n10Manuscript 19, 1900.\n11Testimonies for the Church 6:435, 436.\n12Manuscript 128, 1901.\n13Testimonies for the Church 9:33.\n14Ibid., 6:442.\n15Ibid., 203.\n16Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 166, 167.\n17Testimonies for the Church 6:203.\n18Education, 268.\nSection 17\u2014Relaxation and Recreation [491]\nChapter 79\u2014Recreation is Essential[492]\n[493]\nExtreme Views Regarding Recreation \u2014There are persons\nwith a diseased imagination to whom religion is a tyrant, ruling\nthem as with a rod of iron. Such are constantly mourning over their\ndepravity and groaning over supposed evil. Love does not exist\nin their hearts; a frown is ever upon their countenances. They are\nchilled by the innocent laugh from the youth or from anyone. They\nconsider all recreation or amusement a sin and think that the mind\nmust be constantly wrought up to just such a stern, severe pitch.\nThis is one extreme. Others think that the mind must be ever on\nthe stretch to invent new amusements and diversions in order to\ngain health. They learn to depend on excitement and are uneasy\nwithout it. Such are not true Christians. They go to another extreme.\nThe true principles of Christianity open before all a source of hap-\npiness, the height and depth, the length and breadth of which are\nimmeasurable.1\nTo Refresh the Spirits and Invigorate the Body \u2014It is the\nprivilege and duty of Christians to seek to refresh their spirits and\ninvigorate their bodies by innocent recreation, with the purpose of\nusing their physical and mental powers to the glory of God. Our\nrecreations should not be scenes of senseless mirth, taking the form\nof the nonsensical. We can conduct them in such a manner as will\nbenefit and elevate those with whom we associate, and better qualify\nus and them to more successfully attend to the duties devolving upon\nus as Christians.2\nI was shown that Sabbathkeepers as a people labor too hard[494]\nwithout allowing themselves change or periods of rest. Recreation\nis needful to those who are engaged in physical labor and is still\nmore essential for those whose labor is principally mental. It is not\nessential to our salvation, nor for the glory of God, to keep the mind\nlaboring constantly and excessively, even upon religious themes.3\nWith the question of recreation the surroundings of the home and\nthe school have much to do. In the choice of a home or the location\n388\nRecreation is Essential 389\nof a school these things should be considered. Those with whom\nmental and physical well-being is of greater moment than money or\nthe claims and customs of society should seek for their children the\nbenefit of nature\u2019s teaching and recreation amidst her surroundings.4\nRecreation Is Essential to Best Work\u2014The time spent in phys-\nical exercise is not lost.... A proportionate exercise of all the organs\nand faculties of the body is essential to the best work of each. When\nthe brain is constantly taxed while the other organs of the living ma-\nchinery are inactive, there is a loss of strength, physical and mental.\nThe physical system is robbed of its healthful tone, the mind loses\nits freshness and vigor, and a morbid excitability is the result.5\nCare needs to be exercised in regard to the regulation of hours for\nsleeping and laboring. We must take periods of rest, periods of recre-\nation, periods for contemplation.... The principles of temperance\nhave a wider range than many think.6\nStudents Need Relaxation\u2014Those who are engaged in study\nshould have relaxation. The mind must not be constantly confined [495]\nto close thought, for the delicate mental machinery becomes worn.\nThe body as well as the mind must have exercise.7\nAttention to recreation and physical culture will at times, no\ndoubt, interrupt the regular routine of schoolwork; but the interrup-\ntion will prove no real hindrance. In the invigoration of mind and\nbody, the fostering of an unselfish spirit, and the binding together\nof pupil and teacher by the ties of common interest and friendly\nassociation, the expenditure of time and effort will be repaid a hun-\ndredfold. A blessed outlet will be afforded for that restless energy\nwhich is so often a source of danger to the young. As a safeguard\nagainst evil, the preoccupation of the mind with good is worth more\nthan unnumbered barriers of law and discipline.8\nOffice Workers Who Needed Days for Recreation \u2014I saw\nthat but few realize the constant, wearing labor of those who are bear-\ning the responsibilities of the work in the office. They are confined\nwithin doors day after day and week after week, while a constant\nstrain upon the mental powers is surely undermining their constitu-\ntions and lessening their hold on life. These brethren are in danger\nof breaking suddenly. They are not immortal, and without a change\nthey must wear out and be lost to the work.\n390 The Adventist Home\nWe have precious gifts in Brethren A, B, and C. We cannot\nafford to have them ruin their health through close confinement and\nincessant toil....\nThey have had scarcely any variation except what fevers and\nother sickness have given them. They should have a change fre-\nquently, should often devote a day wholly to recreation with their\nfamilies, who are almost entirely deprived of their society. All may\nnot be able to leave the work at the same time; but they should[496]\nso arrange their work that one or two may go, leaving others to\nsupply their places, and then let these in their turn have the same\nopportunity.\nI saw that these brethren, A, B, and C, should as a religious duty\ntake care of the health and strength which God has given them. The\nLord does not require them just now to become martyrs to His cause.\nThey will obtain no reward for making this sacrifice, for God wants\nthem to live.9\nSeek Means for Innocent, Instructive Recreation\u2014There are\nmodes of recreation which are highly beneficial to both mind and\nbody. An enlightened, discriminating mind will find abundant means\nfor entertainment and diversion, from sources not only innocent, but\ninstructive. Recreation in the open air, the contemplation of the\nworks of God in nature, will be of the highest benefit.10\nI believe that, while we are seeking to refresh our spirits and\ninvigorate our bodies, we are required of God to use all our powers\nat all times to the best purpose. We may associate together as we\ndo here today, [Note: Portion of an address to a company of about\ntwo hundred, enjoying a season of recreation at Lake Goguac, near\nBattle Creek, Michigan, in May, 1870.] and do all to the glory of\nGod. We can and should conduct our recreations in such a manner\nthat we shall be fitted for the more successful discharge of the duties\ndevolving upon us, and that our influence shall be more beneficial\nupon those with whom we associate. Especially should it be the\ncase upon an occasion like this, which should be of good cheer to\nus all. We can return to our homes improved in mind and refreshed\nin body, and prepared to engage in the work anew, with better hope\nand better courage.11\nGod\u2019s Invitation to Youth \u2014God\u2019s invitation comes to each[497]\nyouth, \u201cMy son, give Me thine heart; I will keep it pure; I will\nRecreation is Essential 391\nsatisfy its longings with true happiness.\u201d God loves to make the\nyouth happy, and that is why He would have them give their hearts\ninto His keeping, that all the God-given faculties of the being may be\nkept in a vigorous, healthful condition.

He makes the heart beat; He gives strength to every faculty.\nPure enjoyment will not debase one of God\u2019s gifts.12\n1Testimonies for the Church 1:565.\n2The Health Reformer, July, 1871.\n3Testimonies for the Church 1:514.\n4Education, 211, 212.\n5Fundamentals of Christian Education, 418.\n6Manuscript 60, 1894.\n7Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 333.\n8Education, 213.\n9Testimonies for the Church 1:515, 516.\n10Testimonies for the Church 4:653.\n11Testimonies for the Church 2:586.\n12The Youth\u2019s Instructor, January 5, 1887.\nChapter 80\u2014What Shall We Play?[498]\nSubstitute the Innocent for the Sinful\u2014Youth cannot be made\nas sedate and grave as old age, the child as sober as the sire. While\nsinful amusements are condemned, as they should be, let parents,\nteachers, and guardians of youth provide in their stead innocent\npleasures which will not taint or corrupt the morals. Do not bind\ndown the young to rigid rules and restraints that will lead them to\nfeel themselves oppressed and to break over and rush into paths\nof folly and destruction. With a firm, kind, considerate hand hold\nthe lines of government, guiding and controlling their minds and\npurposes, yet so gently, so wisely, so lovingly, that they will still\nknow that you have their best good in view.1\nThere are amusements, such as dancing, card playing, chess,\ncheckers, etc., which we cannot approve because Heaven condemns\nthem. These amusements open the door for great evil. They are not\nbeneficial in their tendency, but have an exciting influence, producing\nin some minds a passion for those plays which lead to gambling and\ndissipation. All such plays should be condemned by Christians, and\nsomething perfectly harmless should be substituted in their place.2\nWhile we restrain our children from worldly pleasures that have a\ntendency to corrupt and mislead, we ought to provide them innocent\nrecreation, to lead them in pleasant paths where there is no danger.\nNo child of God need have a sad or mournful experience. Divine\ncommands, divine promises, show that this is so. Wisdom\u2019s ways\n\u201care ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\u201d3\nWhile we shun the false and artificial, discarding horse racing,[499]\ncard playing, lotteries, prize fights, liquor drinking, and tobacco\nusing, we must supply sources of pleasure that are pure and noble\nand elevating.4\nThe Useful Place of the Gymnasium \u2014Gymnastic exercises\nfill a useful place in many schools, but without careful supervision\nthey are often carried to excess. In the gymnasium many youth,\n392\nWhat Shall We Play? 393\nby their attempted feats of strength, have done themselves lifelong\ninjury.\nExercise in a gymnasium, however well conducted, cannot sup-\nply the place of recreation in the open air, and for this our schools\nshould afford better opportunity.5\nGames With a Ball\u2014Basic Guiding Principles\u2014I do not con-\ndemn the simple exercise of playing ball; but this, even in its sim-\nplicity, may be overdone.\nI shrink always from the almost sure result which follows in\nthe wake of these amusements. It leads to an outlay of means that\nshould be expended in bringing the light of truth to souls that are\nperishing out of Christ. The amusements and expenditures of means\nfor self-pleasing, which lead on step by step to self-glorifying, and\nthe educating in these games for pleasure produce a love and passion\nfor such things that is not favorable to the perfection of Christian\ncharacter.\nThe way that they have been conducted at the college does not\nbear the impress of heaven. It does not strengthen the intellect. It\ndoes not refine and purify the character. There are threads leading\nout through the habits and customs and worldly practices, and the\nactors become so engrossed and infatuated that they are pronounced\nin heaven lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. In the place\nof the intellect becoming strengthened to do better work as students, [500]\nto be better qualified as Christians to perform the Christian duties,\nthe exercise in these games is filling their brains with thoughts that\ndistract the mind from their studies....\nIs the eye single to the glory of God in these games? I know\nthat this is not so. There is a losing sight of God\u2019s way and His\npurpose. The employment of intelligent beings, in probationary\ntime, is superseding God\u2019s revealed will and substituting for it the\nspeculations and inventions of the human agent, with Satan by his\nside to imbue with his spirit.... The Lord God of heaven protests\nagainst the burning passion cultivated for supremacy in the games\nthat are so engrossing.6\nThe Problem of Many Athletic Sports\u2014Vigorous exercise the\npupils must have. Few evils are more to be dreaded than indolence\nand aimlessness. Yet the tendency of most athletic sports is a subject\nof anxious thought to those who have at heart the well-being of the\n394 The Adventist Home\nyouth. Teachers are troubled as they consider the influence of these\nsports both on the student\u2019s progress in school and on his success in\nafterlife. The games that occupy so much of his time are diverting\nthe mind from study. They are not helping to prepare the youth for\npractical, earnest work in life. Their influence does not tend toward\nrefinement, generosity, or real manliness.\nSome of the most popular amusements, such as football and\nboxing, have become schools of brutality. They are developing the\nsame characteristics as did the games of ancient Rome. The love\nof domination, the pride in mere brute force, the reckless disregard\nof life, are exerting upon the youth a power to demoralize that is\nappalling.\nOther athletic games, though not so brutalizing, are scarcely\nless objectionable because of the excess to which they are carried.[501]\nThey stimulate the love of pleasure and excitement, thus fostering a\ndistaste for useful labor, a disposition to shun practical duties and\nresponsibilities. They tend to destroy a relish for life\u2019s sober realities\nand its tranquil enjoyments. Thus the door is opened to dissipation\nand lawlessness with their terrible results.7\nWhen Life Was Less Complex\u2014In early ages, with the people\nwho were under God\u2019s direction, life was simple. They lived close to\nthe heart of nature. Their children shared in the labor of the parents\nand studied the beauties and mysteries of nature\u2019s treasure house.\nAnd in the quiet of field and wood they pondered those mighty truths\nhanded down as a sacred trust from generation to generation. Such\ntraining produced strong men.\nIn this age life has become artificial, and men have degenerated.\nWhile we may not return fully to the simple habits of those early\ntimes, we may learn from them lessons that will make our seasons\nof recreation what the name implies\u2014seasons of true upbuilding for\nbody and mind and soul.8\nFamily Outings\u2014Let several families living in a city or village\nunite and leave the occupations which have taxed them physically\nand mentally, and make an excursion into the country, to the side of a\nfine lake, or to a nice grove where the scenery of nature is beautiful.\nThey should provide themselves with plain, hygienic food, the very\nbest fruits and grains, and spread their table under the shade of some\ntree or under the canopy of heaven. The ride, the exercise, and the\nWhat Shall We Play? 395\nscenery will quicken the appetite, and they can enjoy a repast which\nkings might envy.\nOn such occasions parents and children should feel free from [502]\ncare, labor, and perplexity. Parents should become children with\ntheir children, making everything as pleasant for them as possible.\nLet the whole day be given to recreation. Exercise in the open air for\nthose whose employment has been within doors and sedentary will\nbe beneficial to health. All who can should feel it a duty to pursue\nthis course. Nothing will be lost, but much gained. They can return\nto their occupations with new life and new courage to engage in their\nlabor with zeal, and they are better prepared to resist disease.9\nFind Happiness in the Charms of Nature\u2014Do not think that\nGod wishes us to yield up everything which it is for our happiness\nhere to retain. All He requires us to give up is that which would not\nbe for our good and happiness to retain.\nThat God who has planted the noble trees and clothed them with\ntheir rich foliage, and given us the brilliant and beautiful shades of\nthe flowers, and whose handy and lovely work we see in all the realm\nof nature, does not design to make us unhappy; He does not design\nthat we shall have no taste and take no pleasure in these things. It is\nHis design that we shall enjoy them. It is His design that we shall be\nhappy in the charms of nature, which are of His own creating.10\nProfitable Social Gatherings \u2014Gatherings for social inter-\ncourse are made in the highest degree profitable and instructive\nwhen those who meet together have the love of God glowing in their\nhearts, when they meet to exchange thoughts in regard to the word\nof God or to consider methods for advancing His work and doing\ngood to their fellow men. When the Holy Spirit is regarded as a\nwelcome guest at these gatherings, when nothing is said or done to [503]\ngrieve Him away, God is honored, and those who meet together are\nrefreshed and strengthened.11\nOur gatherings should be so conducted, and we should so con-\nduct ourselves, that when we return to our homes, we can have a\nconscience void of offense toward God and man, a consciousness\nthat we have not wounded or injured in any manner those with whom\nwe have been associated, or had an injurious influence over them.12\nJesus Found Pleasure in Scenes of Innocent Happiness\u2014Je-\nsus reproved self-indulgence in all its forms, yet He was social in\n396 The Adventist Home\nHis nature. He accepted the hospitality of all classes, visiting the\nhomes of the rich and the poor, the learned and the ignorant, and\nseeking to elevate their thoughts from questions of commonplace\nlife to those things that are spiritual and eternal. He gave no license\nto dissipation, and no shadow of worldly levity marred His conduct;\nyet He found pleasure in scenes of innocent happiness and by His\npresence sanctioned the social gathering. A Jewish marriage was an\nimpressive occasion, and its joy was not displeasing to the Son of\nman.... To the mind of Jesus the gladness of the wedding festivities\npointed forward to the rejoicing of that day when He shall bring\nhome His bride to the Father\u2019s house, and the redeemed with the\nRedeemer shall sit down to the marriage supper of the Lamb.13\nHis Example in Conversation and Conduct \u2014When invited,\nas His work commenced, to a dinner or feast by Pharisee or publican,\nHe accepted the invitation.... On such occasions Christ controlled the\ntable talk and gave many precious lessons. Those present listened to\nHim; for had He not healed their sick, comforted their sorrowing,[504]\ntaken their children in His arms and blessed them? Publicans and\nsinners were drawn to Him, and when He opened His lips to speak,\ntheir attention was riveted on Him.\nChrist taught His disciples how to conduct themselves when in\nthe company of those who were not religious and those who were. He\ntaught them by example that when attending any public gathering,\nthey need not want for something to say. But His conversation\ndiffered most decidedly from that which had been listened to at\nfeasts in the past. Every word He uttered was a savor of life unto life\nto His hearers, and they listened with subdued attention as though\ndesirous of hearing to a purpose.14\nEllen G. White and a Pleasant Social Gathering \u2014At the\nclose of my long journey east, I reached my home in time to spend\nNew Year\u2019s Eve in Healdsburg. The college hall had been fitted\nup for a Sabbath school reunion. Cypress wreaths, autumn leaves,\nevergreens, and flowers were tastefully arranged; and a large bell\nof evergreens hung from the arched doorway at the entrance to the\nroom. The tree was well loaded with donations, which were to be\nused for the benefit of the poor and to help purchase a bell.... On this\noccasion nothing was said or done that need burden the conscience\nof anyone.\nWhat Shall We Play? 397\nSome have said to me, \u201cSister White, what do you think of this?\nIs it in accordance with our faith?\u201d I answer them, \u201cIt is with my\nfaith.\u201d15\nDraw Youth With a Winning Power\u2014God would have every\nhousehold and every church exert a winning power to draw the\nchildren away from the seducing pleasures of the world and from\nassociation with those whose influence would have a corrupting [505]\ntendency. Study to win the youth to Jesus.16\n1Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 335.\n2Testimonies for the Church 1:514.\n3The Review and Herald, January 29, 1884.\n4Special Testimonies on Education \u201cLiving by Principle\u201d, 1898, 19, 20.\n5Education, 210.\n6Notebook Leaflets from the Elmshaven Library, V ol. 1 (1945).\n7Education, 210, 211.\n8Ibid., 211.\n9Testimonies for the Church 1:514, 515.\n10The Review and Herald, May 25, 1886.\n11The Youth\u2019s Instructor, February 4, 1897.\n12Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 337.\n13The Desire of Ages, 150, 151.\n14Welfare Ministry, 287.\n15The Review and Herald, January 29, 1884.\n16Ibid.\nChapter 81\u2014Recreation that Yields Enduring[506]\nSatisfactions\nExercise That Develops Hand, Mind, and Character \u2014The\ngreatest benefit is not gained from exercise that is taken as play or\nexercise merely. There is some benefit derived from being in the\nfresh air and also from the exercise of the muscles; but let the same\namount of energy be given to the performance of helpful duties,\nand the benefit will be greater, and a feeling of satisfaction will be\nrealized; for such exercise carries with it the sense of helpfulness\nand the approval of conscience for duty well done.1\nIn the children and youth an ambition should be awakened to\ntake their exercise in doing something that will be beneficial to\nthemselves and helpful to others. The exercise that develops mind\nand character, that teaches the hands to be useful and trains the young\nto bear their share of life\u2019s burdens, is that which gives physical\nstrength and quickens every faculty. And there is a reward in virtuous\nindustry, in the cultivation of the habit of living to do good.2\nNo recreation helpful only to themselves will prove so great a\nblessing to the children and youth as that which makes them helpful\nto others. Naturally enthusiastic and impressible, the young are\nquick to respond to suggestion.3\nJesus\u2019 Example as a Youth\u2014The life of Jesus was filled with\nindustry, and He took exercise in performing varied tasks in harmony\nwith His developing physical strength. In doing the work that was[507]\nmarked out for Him, He had no time for indulgence in exciting,\nuseless amusements. He took no part in that which would poison the\nmoral and lower the physical tone, but was trained in useful labor\nand even for the endurance of hardship.4\nIn His earth life Christ was an example to all the human family,\nand He was obedient and helpful in the home. He learned the car-\npenter\u2019s trade and worked with His own hands in the little shop at\nNazareth....\n398\nRecreation that Yields Enduring Satisfactions 399\nThe Bible says of Jesus, \u201cAnd the child grew, and waxed strong in\nspirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon Him.\u201d As\nHe worked in childhood and youth, mind and body were developed.\nHe did not use His physical powers recklessly, but gave them such\nexercise as would keep them in health, that He might do the best\nwork in every line. He was not willing to be defective, even in the\nhandling of tools. He was perfect as a workman, as He was perfect\nin character. By precept and example Christ has dignified useful\nlabor.5\nRefreshment Through Variation of Labor \u2014Young men\nshould remember that they are accountable for all the privileges\nthey have enjoyed, for the improvement of their time, and for the\nright use of their abilities. They may inquire, Shall we have no\namusement or recreation? Shall we work, work, work, without any\nvariation?6\nA change from physical labor that has taxed the strength severely\nmay be very necessary for a time, that they may again engage in\nlabor, putting forth exertion with greater success. But entire rest\nmay not be necessary or even be attended with the best results so far\nas their physical strength is concerned. They need not, even when\nweary with one kind of labor, trifle away their precious moments.\nThey may then seek to do something not so exhausting but which [508]\nwill be a blessing to their mother and sisters. In lightening their\ncares by taking upon themselves the roughest burdens they have to\nbear, they can find that amusement which springs from principle and\nwhich will yield them true happiness, and their time will not be spent\nin trifling or in selfish indulgence. Their time may be ever employed\nto advantage, and they be constantly refreshed with variation, and\nyet be redeeming the time so that every moment will tell with good\naccount to someone.7\nMany claim that it is necessary for the preservation of physical\nhealth to indulge in selfish amusement. It is true that change is\nrequired for the best development of the body, for mind and body\nare refreshed and invigorated by change; but this object is not gained\nby indulgence in foolish amusements, to the neglect of daily duties\nwhich the youth should be required to do.8\nA Program for Students That God Blessed \u2014We are to edu-\ncate the youth to exercise equally the mental and the physical powers.\n400 The Adventist Home\nThe healthful exercise of the whole being will give an education that\nis broad and comprehensive.\nWe had stern work to do in Australia in educating parents and\nyouth along these lines; but we persevered in our efforts until the\nlesson was learned that in order to have an education that was com-\nplete, the time of study must be divided between the gaining of book\nknowledge and the securing of a knowledge of practical work.\nPart of each day was spent in useful work, the students learning\nhow to clear the land, how to cultivate the soil and to build houses\nin time that would otherwise have been spent in playing games and\nseeking amusement. And the Lord blessed the students who thus[509]\ndevoted their time to learning lessons of usefulness.9\nGod has provided useful employments for the development of\nhealth, and these useful employments will also qualify students to\nbe a help to themselves and to others.10\nIn the place of providing diversions that merely amuse, arrange-\nments should be made for exercises that will be productive of good.11\nMissionary Activity Is an Ideal Exercise \u2014There are plenty\nof necessary, useful things to do in our world that would make the\npleasure amusement exercise almost wholly unnecessary. Brain,\nbone, and muscle will acquire solidity and strength in using them to\na purpose, doing good, hard thinking, and devising plans which shall\ntrain them to develop powers of intellect and strength of the physical\norgans, which will be putting into practical use their God-given\ntalents with which they may glorify God.12\nIt is our duty ever to seek to do good in the use of the muscles\nand brain God has given to youth, that they may be useful to others,\nmaking their labors lighter, soothing the sorrowing, lifting up the\ndiscouraged, speaking words of comfort to the hopeless, turning\nthe minds of the students from fun and frolic which often carries\nthem beyond the dignity of manhood and womanhood to shame and\ndisgrace. The Lord would have the mind elevated, seeking higher,\nnobler channels of usefulness.13\nThe same power of exercise of mind and muscle might invent\nways and means of altogether a higher class of exercise, in doing\nmissionary work which would make them laborers together with\nGod, and would be educating for higher usefulness in the present life,\nin doing useful work, which is a most essential branch in education....[510]\nRecreation that Yields Enduring Satisfactions 401\nIs not this the work that every youth should be seeking to do,\nworking in Christ\u2019s lines? You have Christ\u2019s help. The ideas of the\nstudents will broaden. They will be far reaching, and the powers of\nusefulness, even in your student\u2019s life, will be continually growing.\nThe arms, the hands, which God has given, are to be used in doing\ngood which shall bear the signet of heaven, that you can at last hear\nthe \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant.\u201d14\nA Prescription for Invalids\u2014I have been instructed that as the\nsick are encouraged to leave their rooms and spend time in the open\nair, tending the flowers or doing some other light, pleasant work,\ntheir minds will be called from self to something more health giving.\nOpen-air exercise should be prescribed as a beneficial, life-giving\nnecessity.15\nWe can but be cheerful as we listen to the music of the happy\nbirds and feast our eyes upon flourishing fields and gardens. We\nshould invite our minds to be interested in all the glorious things\nGod has provided for us with a liberal hand. And in reflecting upon\nthese rich tokens of His love and care, we may forget infirmities, be\ncheerful, and make melody in our hearts unto the Lord.16\nFor years I have from time to time been shown that the sick\nshould be taught that it is wrong to suspend all physical labor in\norder to regain health. In thus doing the will becomes dormant, the\nblood moves sluggishly through the system and constantly grows\nmore impure. Where the patient is in danger of imagining his case\nworse than it really is, indolence will be sure to produce the most [511]\nunhappy results. Well-regulated labor gives the invalid the idea that\nhe is not totally useless in the world, that he is at least of some\nbenefit. This will afford him satisfaction, give him courage, and\nimpart to him vigor, which vain mental amusements can never do.17\nGod\u2019s Provision for Finding True Pleasures \u2014God has pro-\nvided for everyone pleasure that may be enjoyed by rich and poor\nalike\u2014the pleasure found in cultivating pureness of thought and\nunselfishness of action, the pleasure that comes from speaking sym-\npathizing words and doing kindly deeds. From those who perform\nsuch service, the light of Christ shines to brighten lives darkened by\nmany sorrows.18\n402 The Adventist Home\n1Fundamentals of Christian Education, 418.\n2Ibid., 418, 419.\n3Education, 212.\n4The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 27, 1893.\n5Fundamentals of Christian Education, 417, 418.\n6Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 337.\n7Testimonies for the Church 3:223.\n8The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 27, 1893.\n9Letter 84, 1909.\n10The Review and Herald, October 25, 1898.\n11Pamphlet Recreation, 47.\n12Notebook Leaflets from the Elmshaven Library V ol. 1, Education, 97.\n13Ibid., 98.\n14Ibid., 97, 98.\n15Medical Ministry, 234.\n16The Health Reformer, July, 1871.\n17Testimonies for the Church 1:555.\n18Testimonies for the Church 9:57.\nChapter 82\u2014How the Christian Chooses His [512]\nRecreation\nChristian Recreation Versus Worldly Amusement\u2014There is\na distinction between recreation and amusement. Recreation, when\ntrue to its name, re-creation, tends to strengthen and build up. Call-\ning us aside from our ordinary cares and occupations, it affords\nrefreshment for mind and body and thus enables us to return with\nnew vigor to the earnest work of life.\nAmusement, on the other hand, is sought for the sake of pleasure\nand is often carried to excess; it absorbs the energies that are required\nfor useful work and thus proves a hindrance to life\u2019s true success.1\nBetween the associations of the followers of Christ for Christian\nrecreation and worldly gatherings for pleasure and amusement will\nexist a marked contrast. Instead of prayer and the mentioning of\nChrist and sacred things will be heard from the lips of worldlings\nthe silly laugh and the trifling conversation. Their idea is to have a\ngeneral high time. Their amusements commence in folly and end in\nvanity.2\nThere is great need of temperance in amusements, as in every\nother pursuit. And the character of these amusements should be care-\nfully and thoroughly considered. Every youth should ask himself,\nWhat influence will these amusements have on physical, mental, and\nmoral health? Will my mind become so infatuated as to forget God?\nShall I cease to have His glory before me?3\nA Rule by Which Lawful Pleasures May Be Recognized \u2014 [513]\nLet us never lose sight of the fact that Jesus is a wellspring of joy.\nHe does not delight in the misery of human beings, but loves to see\nthem happy.\nChristians have many sources of happiness at their command,\nand they may tell with unerring accuracy what pleasures are lawful\nand right. They may enjoy such recreations as will not dissipate the\nmind or debase the soul, such as will not disappoint and leave a sad\nafter-influence to destroy self-respect or bar the way to usefulness.\n403\n404 The Adventist Home\nIf they can take Jesus with them and maintain a prayerful spirit, they\nare perfectly safe.4\nAny amusement in which you can engage asking the blessing\nof God upon it in faith will not be dangerous. But any amusement\nwhich disqualifies you for secret prayer, for devotion at the altar\nof prayer, or for taking part in the prayer meeting is not safe, but\ndangerous.5\nAmusements That Unfit for Ordinary Duties\u2014We are of that\nclass who believe that it is our privilege every day of our lives to\nglorify God upon the earth, that we are not to live in this world\nmerely for our own amusement, merely to please ourselves. We are\nhere to benefit humanity and to be a blessing to society; and if we let\nour minds run in that low channel that many who are seeking only\nvanity and folly permit their minds to run in, how can we be a benefit\nto our race and generation? How can we be a blessing to society\naround us? We cannot innocently indulge in any amusement which\nwill unfit us for the more faithful discharge of ordinary duties.6\nThe welfare of the soul should not be endangered by the grati-\nfication of any selfish desire, and we should shun any amusement\nwhich so fascinates the mind that the ordinary duties of life seem\ntame and uninteresting. By indulgence in such pleasure the mind[514]\nbecomes confirmed in a wrong direction, and Satan so perverts the\nthoughts that wrong is made to appear as right. Then restraint and\nsubmission to parents, such as Christ rendered to His parents, seem\nunbearable.7\nObjectionable Social Gatherings Depicted\u2014There are many\nthings which are right in themselves, but which, perverted by Satan,\nprove a snare to the unwary.8\nAs ordinarily conducted, parties of pleasure ... are a hindrance\nto real growth, either of mind or of character. Frivolous associations,\nhabits of extravagance, of pleasure seeking, and too often of dissipa-\ntion are formed that shape the whole life for evil. In place of such\namusements parents and teachers can do much to supply diversions\nwholesome and life giving.9\nThere has been a class of social gatherings in\u2014\u2014, ... parties\nof pleasure that have been a disgrace to our institutions and to the\nchurch. They encourage pride of dress, pride of appearance, self-\ngratification, hilarity, and trifling. Satan is entertained as an honored\nHow the Christian Chooses His Recreation 405\nguest, and he takes possession of those who patronize these gather-\nings.\nA view of one such company was presented to me, where were\nassembled those who profess to believe the truth. One was seated\nat the instrument of music, and such songs were poured forth as\nmade the watching angels weep. There was mirth, there was coarse\nlaughter, there was abundance of enthusiasm and a kind of inspira-\ntion; but the joy was such as Satan only is able to create. This is\nan enthusiasm and infatuation of which all who love God will be\nashamed. It prepares the participants for unholy thought and action.\nI have reason to think that some who were engaged in that scene [515]\nheartily repented of the shameful performance.\nMany such gatherings have been presented to me. I have seen\nthe gaiety, the display in dress, the personal adornment. All want\nto be thought brilliant, and give themselves up to hilarity, foolish\njesting, cheap, coarse flattery, and uproarious laughter. The eyes\nsparkle, the cheek is flushed, conscience sleeps. With eating and\ndrinking and merrymaking, they do their best to forget God. The\nscene of pleasure is their paradise. And Heaven is looking on, seeing\nand hearing all.10\nGatherings for amusement confuse faith and make the motive\nmixed and uncertain. The Lord accepts no divided heart. He wants\nthe whole man.11\nFew Popular Amusements Are Safe \u2014Many of the amuse-\nments popular in the world today, even with those who claim to\nbe Christians, tend to the same end as did those of the heathen.\nThere are indeed few among them that Satan does not turn to ac-\ncount in destroying souls. Through the drama he has worked for ages\nto excite passion and glorify vice. The opera, with its fascinating\ndisplay and bewildering music, the masquerade, the dance, the card\ntable, Satan employs to break down the barriers of principle and\nopen the door to sensual indulgence. In every gathering for pleasure\nwhere pride is fostered or appetite indulged, where one is led to\nforget God and lose sight of eternal interests, there Satan is binding\nhis chains about the soul.12\nThe true Christian will not desire to enter any place of amusement\nor engage in any diversion upon which he cannot ask the blessing\nof God. He will not be found at the theater, the billiard hall, or the\n406 The Adventist Home\nbowling saloon. He will not unite with the gay waltzers or indulge in\nany other bewitching pleasure that will banish Christ from the mind.[516]\nTo those who plead for these diversions we answer, We cannot\nindulge in them in the name of Jesus of Nazareth. The blessing of\nGod would not be invoked upon the hour spent at the theater or in\nthe dance. No Christian would wish to meet death in such a place.\nNo one would wish to be found there when Christ shall come.13\nThe Theater the Hotbed of Immorality \u2014Among the most\ndangerous resorts for pleasure is the theater. Instead of being a school\nfor morality and virtue, as is so often claimed, it is the very hotbed of\nimmorality. Vicious habits and sinful propensities are strengthened\nand confirmed by these entertainments. Low songs, lewd gestures,\nexpressions, and attitudes deprave the imagination and debase the\nmorals. Every youth who habitually attends such exhibitions will\nbe corrupted in principle. There is no influence in our land more\npowerful to poison the imagination, to destroy religious impressions,\nand to blunt the relish for the tranquil pleasures and sober realities of\nlife than theatrical amusements. The love for these scenes increases\nwith every indulgence as the desire for intoxicating drink strengthens\nwith its use. The only safe course is to shun the theater, the circus,\nand every other questionable place of amusement.14\nDancing\u2014a School of Depravity\u2014In many religious families\ndancing and card playing are made a parlor pastime. It is urged that\nthese are quiet home amusements, which may be safely enjoyed\nunder the parental eye. But a love for these exciting pleasures is thus\ncultivated, and that which was considered harmless at home will not[517]\nlong be regarded dangerous abroad. It is yet to be ascertained that\nthere is any good to be obtained from these amusements. They do\nnot give vigor to the body nor rest to the mind. They do not implant\nin the soul one virtuous or holy sentiment. On the contrary, they\ndestroy all relish for serious thought and for religious services. It is\ntrue that there is a wide contrast between the better class of select\nparties and the promiscuous and degraded assemblies of the low\ndance house. Yet all are steps in the path of dissipation.15\nDavid\u2019s Dancing Not a Precedent\u2014David\u2019s dancing in rever-\nent joy before God has been cited by pleasure lovers in justification\nof the fashionable modern dance, but there is no ground for such\nan argument. In our day dancing is associated with folly and mid-\nHow the Christian Chooses His Recreation 407\nnight reveling. Health and morals are sacrificed to pleasure. By\nthe frequenters of the ballroom God is not an object of thought and\nreverence; prayer or the song of praise would be felt to be out of\nplace in their assemblies. This test should be decisive. Amusements\nthat have a tendency to weaken the love for sacred things and lessen\nour joy in the service of God are not to be sought by Christians.\nThe music and dancing in joyful praise to God at the removal of the\nark had not the faintest resemblance to the dissipation of modern\ndancing. The one tended to the remembrance of God and exalted\nHis holy name. The other is a device of Satan to cause men to forget\nGod and to dishonor Him.16\nCard Playing\u2014a Prelude to Crime\u2014Card playing should be\nprohibited. The associations and tendencies are dangerous. The\nprince of the powers of darkness presides in the gaming room and\nwherever there is card playing. Evil angels are familiar guests in [518]\nthese places. There is nothing in such amusements beneficial to\nsoul or body. There is nothing to strengthen the intellect, nothing\nto store it with valuable ideas for future use. The conversation is\nupon trivial and degrading subjects.... Expertness in handling cards\nwill soon lead to a desire to put this knowledge and tact to some use\nfor personal benefit. A small sum is staked, and then a larger, until\na thirst for gaming is acquired, which leads to certain ruin. How\nmany has this pernicious amusement led to every sinful practice,\nto poverty, to prison, to murder, and to the gallows! And yet many\nparents do not see the terrible gulf of ruin that is yawning for our\nyouth.17\nThe Fear of Being Singular \u2014Professed Christians who are\nsuperficial in character and religious experience are used by the\ntempter as his decoys. This class are always ready for the gatherings\nfor pleasure or sport, and their influence attracts others. Young men\nand women who have tried to be Bible Christians are persuaded\nto join the party, and they are drawn into the ring. They do not\nprayerfully consult the divine standard to learn what Christ has\nsaid in regard to the fruit to be borne on the Christian tree. They\ndo not discern that these entertainments are really Satan\u2019s banquet,\nprepared to keep souls from accepting the call to the marriage supper\nof the Lamb and preventing them from receiving the white robe\nof character, which is the righteousness of Christ. They become\n408 The Adventist Home\nconfused as to what it is right for them as Christians to do. They do\nnot want to be thought singular, and naturally incline to follow the\nexample of others. Thus they come under the influence of those who\nhave never had the divine touch on heart or mind.18\nAvoid the First Step Toward Indulgence \u2014You may see no[519]\nreal danger in taking the first step in frivolity and pleasure seeking\nand think that when you desire to change your course, you will be\nable to do right as easily as before you yielded yourselves to do\nwrong. But this is a mistake. By the choice of evil companions\nmany have been led step by step from the path of virtue into depths\nof disobedience and dissipation to which at one time they would\nhave thought it impossible for them to sink.19\nA Clear Declaration of Christian Principles\u2014If you truly be-\nlong to Christ, you will have opportunities for witnessing for Him.\nYou will be invited to attend places of amusement, and then it will\nbe that you will have an opportunity to testify to your Lord. If you\nare true to Christ then, you will not try to form excuses for your\nnonattendance, but will plainly and modestly declare that you are\na child of God, and your principles would not allow you to be in a\nplace, even for one occasion, where you could not invite the presence\nof your Lord.20\nIt is God\u2019s purpose to manifest through His people the principles\nof His kingdom. That in life and character they may reveal these\nprinciples, He desires to separate them from the customs, habits,\nand practices of the world....\nWonderful scenes are opening before us; and at this time a living\ntestimony is to be borne in the lives of God\u2019s professed people so\nthat the world may see that in this age, when evil reigns on every\nside, there is yet a people who are laying aside their will and are\nseeking to do God\u2019s will\u2014a people in whose hearts and lives God\u2019s\nlaw is written.\nGod expects those who bear the name of Christ to represent\nHim. Their thoughts are to be pure, their words noble and uplifting.[520]\nThe religion of Christ is to be interwoven with all that they do and\nsay.... God desires His people to show by their lives the advantage\nof Christianity over worldliness, to show that they are working on a\nhigh, holy plane.21\nHow the Christian Chooses His Recreation 409\n1Education, 207.\n2The Review and Herald, May 25, 1886.\n3Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 333, 334.\n4The Review and Herald, August 19, 1884.\n5Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 337.\n6Ibid., 336.\n7The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 27, 1893.\n8Letter 144, 1906.\n9Education, 211.\n10Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 339, 340.\n11Ibid., 345.\n12Patriarchs and Prophets, 459, 460.\n13The Review and Herald, February 28, 1882.\n14Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 334, 335.\n15The Review and Herald, February 28, 1882.\n16Patriarchs and Prophets, 707.\n17Testimonies for the Church 4:652.\n18Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 340, 341.\n19Ibid., 224.\n20The Youth\u2019s Instructor, May 4, 1893.\n21Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 321-324.\nChapter 83\u2014The Lure of Pleasure[521]\nThe Natural Heart Seeks Pleasure \u2014The natural mind leans\ntoward pleasure and self-gratification. It is Satan\u2019s policy to man-\nufacture an abundance of this. He seeks to fill the minds of men\nwith a desire for worldly amusement, that they may have no time to\nask themselves the question, How is it with my soul? The love of\npleasure is infectious. Given up to this, the mind hurries from one\npoint to another, ever seeking for some amusement.1\nWorldly pleasures are infatuating; and for their momentary en-\njoyment many sacrifice the friendship of Heaven, with the peace,\nlove, and joy that it affords. But these chosen objects of delight soon\nbecome disgusting, unsatisfying.2\nMillions Flock to Places of Amusement \u2014In this age of the\nworld there is an unprecedented rage for pleasure. Dissipation and\nreckless extravagance everywhere prevail. The multitudes are eager\nfor amusement. The mind becomes trifling and frivolous because\nit is not accustomed to meditation or disciplined to study. Ignorant\nsentimentalism is current. God requires that every soul shall be\ncultivated, refined, elevated, and ennobled. But too often every valu-\nable attainment is neglected for fashionable display and superficial\npleasure.3\nThe exciting amusements of our time keep the minds of men\nand women, but more especially the youth, in a fever of excitement,\nwhich is telling upon their stock of vitality in a far greater degree\nthan all their studies and physical labors, and have a tendency to\ndwarf the intellect and corrupt the morals.4\nThe youth are swept away by the popular current. Those who[522]\nlearn to love amusement for its own sake open the door to a flood of\ntemptations. They give themselves up to social gaiety and thought-\nless mirth. They are led on from one form of dissipation to another,\nuntil they lose both the desire and the capacity for a life of useful-\nness. Their religious aspirations are chilled; their spiritual life is\n410\nLure of Pleasure 411\ndarkened. All the nobler faculties of the soul, all that link man with\nthe spiritual world, are debased.5\nAmong Pleasure Lovers Are Many Church Members \u2014\nMany are eagerly participating in worldly, demoralizing amusements\nwhich God\u2019s word forbids. Thus they sever their connection with\nGod and rank themselves with the pleasure lovers of the world. The\nsins that destroyed the antediluvians and the cities of the plain exist\ntoday\u2014not merely in heathen lands, not only among popular profes-\nsors of Christianity, but with some who profess to be looking for the\ncoming of the Son of man. If God should present these sins before\nyou as they appear in His sight, you would be filled with shame and\nterror.6\nThe desire for excitement and pleasing entertainment is a temp-\ntation and a snare to God\u2019s people and especially to the young.\nSatan is constantly preparing inducements to attract minds from the\nsolemn work of preparation for scenes just in the future. Through the\nagency of worldlings he keeps up a continual excitement to induce\nthe unwary to join in worldly pleasures. There are shows, lectures,\nand an endless variety of entertainments that are calculated to lead\nto a love of the world; and through this union with the world, faith\nis weakened.7\nSatan, a Skillful Charmer \u2014The young generally conduct [523]\nthemselves as though the precious hours of probation, while mercy\nlingers, were one grand holiday and they were placed in this world\nmerely for their own amusement, to be gratified with a continued\nround of excitement. Satan has been making special efforts to lead\nthem to find happiness in worldly amusements and to justify them-\nselves by endeavoring to show that these amusements are harmless,\ninnocent, and even important for health.8\nHe [Satan] presents the path of holiness as difficult, while the\npaths of worldly pleasure are strewn with flowers. In false and\nflattering colors he arrays the world with its pleasures before the\nyouth. But the pleasures of earth will soon come to an end, and that\nwhich is sown must also be reaped.9\nHe is in every sense of the word a deceiver, a skillful charmer.\nHe has many finely woven nets, which appear innocent, but which\nare skillfully prepared to entangle the young and unwary.10\n412 The Adventist Home\nEducation Is Dwarfed by the Love of Pleasure \u2014Parents\nmake a mistake in rushing their children into society at an early\nage, fearing that they will not know anything unless they attend\nparties and mingle with those who are lovers of pleasure. Even\nwhile they are at school, they allow their children to attend parties\nand mingle in society. This is a great mistake. In this way children\nlearn evil much faster than they do the sciences, and their minds\nare filled with useless things, while their passion for amusement is\ndeveloped to such an extent that it is impossible for them to obtain\na knowledge of even the common branches of education. Their\nattention is divided between education and a love of pleasure, and\nas the love of pleasure predominates, their intellectual advancement[524]\nis slow.11\nLike Israel of old, the pleasure lovers eat and drink and rise up to\nplay. There is mirth and carousing, hilarity and glee. In all this the\nyouth follow the example of the authors of the books placed in their\nhands for study. The greatest evil of it all is the permanent effect\nthat these things have upon the character.12\nGod\u2019s Last Message Regarded With Indifference \u2014As the\ntime of their probation was closing, the antediluvians gave them-\nselves up to exciting amusements and festivities. Those who pos-\nsessed influence and power were bent on keeping the minds of the\npeople engrossed with mirth and pleasure, lest any should be im-\npressed by the last solemn warning. Do we not see the same repeated\nin our day? While God\u2019s servants are giving the message that the\nend of all things is at hand, the world is absorbed in amusements\nand pleasure seeking. There is a constant round of excitement that\ncauses indifference to God and prevents the people from being im-\npressed by the truths which alone can save them from the coming\ndestruction.13\nSabbathkeepers Will Be Tested and Proved\u2014Young Sabbath-\nkeepers who have yielded to the influence of the world will have to\nbe tested and proved. The perils of the last days are upon us, and a\ntrial is before the young which many have not anticipated. They will\nbe brought into distressing perplexity, and the genuineness of their\nfaith will be proved. They profess to be looking for the Son of man,\nyet some of them have been a miserable example to unbelievers.\nThey have not been willing to give up the world, but have united with\nLure of Pleasure 413\nthe world in attending picnics [Note: The simple outdoor gathering [525]\nof families or church members is not referred to here, but that in\nwhich church members \u201cunited with the world\u201d in a carnival type of\ncommunity gathering quite common then.] and other gatherings for\npleasure, flattering themselves that they were engaging in innocent\namusement. Yet it is just such indulgences that separate them from\nGod and make them children of the world....\nGod does not own the pleasure seeker as His follower. Those\nonly who are self-denying and who live lives of sobriety, humility,\nand holiness are true followers of Jesus. And such cannot enjoy the\nfrivolous, empty conversation of the lover of the world.14\nThe All-Important Consideration\u2014Let none begin to believe\nthat amusements are essential and that a careless disregard of the\nHoly Spirit during hours of selfish pleasure is to be looked upon as\na light matter. God will not be mocked. Let every young man, every\nyoung woman, consider: \u201cAm I prepared today for my life to close?\nHave I the heart preparation that fits me to do the work which the\nLord has given me to do?\u201d15\n1Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 337.\n2The Review and Herald, January 29, 1884.\n3The Review and Herald, December 6, 1881.\n4The Health Reformer, December, 1872.\n5Testimonies for the Church 9:90.\n6Ibid., 5:218.\n7Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 325.\n8Testimonies for the Church 1:501.\n9The Youth\u2019s Instructor, January 1, 1907.\n10Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 325.\n11The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 27, 1893.\n12Testimonies for the Church 8:66.\n13Patriarchs and Prophets, 103.\n14Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 327, 328.\n15The Youth\u2019s Instructor, August 14, 1906.\nChapter 84\u2014Directing Juvenile Thinking[526]\nRegarding Recreation\nStandards Are Being Lowered\u2014Christian parents are giving\nway to the world-loving propensities of their children. They open\nthe door to amusements which from principle they once prohibited.1\nEven among Christian parents there has been too much sanction-\ning of the love of amusements. Parents have received the world\u2019s\nmaxim, have conformed to the general opinion that it was necessary\nthat the early life of children and youth should be frittered away\nin idleness, in selfish amusements, and in foolish indulgences. In\nthis way a taste has been created for exciting pleasure, and children\nand youth have trained their minds so that they delight in exciting\ndisplays; and they have a positive dislike for the sober, useful duties\nof life. They live lives more after the order of the brute creation.\nThey have no thoughts of God or of eternal realities, but flit like\nbutterflies in their season. They do not act like sensible beings whose\nlives are capable of measuring with the life of God, and who are\naccountable to Him for every hour of their time.2\nMothers to Invent and Direct Amusements\u2014Instead of send-\ning her children from her presence, that she may not be troubled\nwith their noise and be annoyed with the numerous attentions they\nwould desire, she will feel that her time cannot be better employed\nthan in soothing and diverting their restless, active minds with some\namusement or light, happy employment. The mother will be amply[527]\nrepaid for the efforts she may make and the time she may spend to\ninvent amusement for her children.\nYoung children love society. They cannot, as a general thing,\nenjoy themselves alone; and the mother should feel that, in most\ncases, the place for her children when they are in the house is in the\nroom she occupies. She can then have a general oversight of them\nand be prepared to set little differences right, when appealed to by\nthem, and correct wrong habits or the manifestation of selfishness\nor passion, and can give their minds a turn in the right direction.\n414\nDirecting Juvenile Thinking Regarding Recreation 415\nThat which children enjoy they think mother can be pleased with,\nand it is perfectly natural for them to consult mother in little matters\nof perplexity. And the mother should not wound the heart of her\nsensitive child by treating the matter with indifference or by refusing\nto be troubled with such small matters. That which may be small to\nthe mother is large to them. And a word of direction or caution, at\nthe right time, will often prove of great value.3\nDo Not Deny Innocent Pleasures \u2014For lack of time and\nthought many a mother refuses her children some innocent plea-\nsure, while busy fingers and weary eyes are diligently engaged on\nwork designed only for adornment, something that, at best, will serve\nonly to encourage vanity and extravagance in their young hearts. As\nthe children approach manhood and womanhood, these lessons bear\nfruit in pride and moral worthlessness. The mother grieves over her\nchildren\u2019s faults but does not realize that the harvest she is reaping\nis from seed which she herself planted.\nSome mothers are not uniform in the treatment of their children.\nAt times they indulge them to their injury, and again they refuse [528]\nsome innocent gratification that would make the childish heart very\nhappy. In this they do not imitate Christ; He loved the children; He\ncomprehended their feelings and sympathized with them in their\npleasures and their trials.4\nHow Mrs. White Restrained Her Children \u2014When the chil-\ndren will beg that they may go to this company or join that party\nof amusement, say to them: \u201cI cannot let you go, children; sit right\ndown here, and I will tell you why. I am doing up work for eternity\nand for God. God has given you to me and entrusted you to my care.\nI am standing in the place of God to you, my children; therefore I\nmust watch you as one who must give an account in the day of God.\nDo you want your mother\u2019s name written in the books of heaven\nas one who failed to do her duty to her children, as one who let\nthe enemy come in and preoccupy the ground that I ought to have\noccupied? Children, I am going to tell you which is the right way,\nand then if you choose to turn away from your mother and go into\nthe paths of wickedness, your mother will stand clear, but you will\nhave to suffer for your own sins.\u201d\nThis is the way I did with my children, and before I would get\nthrough, they would be weeping, and they would say, \u201cWon\u2019t you\n416 The Adventist Home\npray for us?\u201d Well, I never refused to pray for them. I knelt by their\nside and prayed with them. Then I have gone away and have pleaded\nwith God until the sun was up in the heavens, the whole night long,\nthat the spell of the enemy might be broken, and I have had the\nvictory. Although it cost me a night\u2019s labor, yet I felt richly paid\nwhen my children would hang about my neck and say, \u201cOh, Mother,\nwe are so glad that you did not let us go when we wanted to. Now\nwe see that it would have been wrong.\u201d\nParents, this is the way you must work, as though you meant it.[529]\nYou must make a business of this work if you expect to save your\nchildren in the kingdom of God.5\nProblems of the Perplexing Teen Ages \u2014In the present state\nof society it is no easy task for parents to restrain their children and\ninstruct them according to the Bible rule of right. Children often\nbecome impatient under restraint and wish to have their own way\nand to go and come as they please. Especially from the age of ten to\neighteen they are inclined to feel that there can be no harm in going\nto worldly gatherings of young associates. But the experienced\nChristian parents can see danger. They are acquainted with the\npeculiar temperaments of their children and know the influence of\nthese things upon their minds; and from a desire for their salvation,\nthey should keep them back from these exciting amusements.6\nVigilance Is Especially Needed After Conversion\u2014When the\nchildren decide for themselves to leave the pleasures of the world\nand to become Christ\u2019s disciples, what a burden is lifted from the\nhearts of careful, faithful parents! Yet even then the labors of the\nparents must not cease. These youth have just commenced in earnest\nthe warfare against sin and against the evils of the natural heart,\nand they need in a special sense the counsel and watchcare of their\nparents.7\nThe Secret of Guarding the Children From Worldly Attrac-\ntions\u2014How many parents are lamenting the fact that they cannot\nkeep their children at home, that they have no love for home! At\nan early age they have a desire for the company of strangers; and\nas soon as they are old enough, they break away from that which[530]\nappears to them to be bondage and unreasonable restraint and will\nneither heed a mother\u2019s prayers nor a father\u2019s counsels. Investigation\nwould generally reveal that the sin lay at the door of the parents.\nDirecting Juvenile Thinking Regarding Recreation 417\nThey have not made home what it ought to be\u2014attractive, pleasant,\nradiant with the sunshine of kind words, pleasant looks, and true\nlove.\nThe secret of saving your children lies in making your home\nlovely and attractive. Indulgence in parents will not bind the children\nto God nor to home; but a firm, godly influence to properly train and\neducate the mind would save many children from ruin.8\nIt is the duty of parents to watch the going out and the coming in\nof their children. They should encourage them and present induce-\nments before them which will attract them at home and lead them\nto see that their parents are interested for them. They should make\nhome pleasant and cheerful.9\n1Manuscript 119, 1899.\n2The Youth\u2019s Instructor, January July 20, 1893.\n3A Solemn Appeal, 136, 137.\n4The Ministry of Healing, 389, 390.\n5Manuscript 13, 1888.\n6Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 327.\n7Ibid.\n8The Review and Herald, December 9, 1884.\n9Testimonies for the Church 1:400, 401.\n418 The Adventist Home\nSection 18\u2014Thou Shalt be Recompensed [531]\nChapter 85\u2014The Reward Here and Hereafter[532]\n[533]\nA Rich Reward Awaits Faithful Parents\u2014If parents give their\nchildren the proper education, they themselves will be made happy\nby seeing the fruit of their careful training in the Christlike character\nof their children. They are doing God the highest service by pre-\nsenting to the world well-ordered, well-disciplined families, who\nnot only fear the Lord, but honor and glorify Him by their influence\nupon other families; and they will receive their reward.1\nBelieving parents, you have a responsible work before you to\nguide the footsteps of your children, even in their religious expe-\nrience. When they truly love God, they will bless and reverence\nyou for the care which you have manifested for them, and for your\nfaithfulness in restraining their desires and subduing their wills.2\nThere is a reward when the seed of truth is early sown in the\nheart and carefully tended.3\nParents should labor with reference to the future harvest. While\nthey sow in tears, amid many discouragements, it should be with\nearnest prayer. They may see the promise of but a late and scanty\nharvest, yet that should not prevent the sowing. They should sow\nbeside all waters, embracing every opportunity both to improve\nthemselves and to benefit their children. Such seed sowing will not\nbe in vain. At the harvest time many faithful parents will return with\njoy, bringing their sheaves with them.4\nGive your children intellectual culture and moral training. Fortify[534]\ntheir young minds with firm, pure principles. While you have op-\nportunity, lay the foundation for a noble manhood and womanhood.\nYour labor will be rewarded a thousandfold.5\nParents Will Be Revered by Children Fitted for Heaven\u2014In\nthe word of God we find a beautiful description of a happy home\nand the woman who presides over it: \u201cHer children arise up, and\ncall her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.\u201d What greater\ncommendation can be desired by the mistress of a home than that\nwhich is here expressed?6\n420\nReward Here and Hereafter 421\nIf she [the true wife and mother] looks to God for her strength\nand comfort, and in His wisdom and fear seeks to do her daily duty,\nshe will bind her husband to her heart and see her children coming\nto maturity honorable men and women, having moral stamina to\nfollow the example of their mother.7\nThe great stimulus to the toiling, burdened mother should be that\nevery child who is trained aright, and who has the inward adorning,\nthe ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, will have a fitness for heaven\nand will shine in the courts of the Lord.8\nThe Joys of Heaven to Begin in the Home\u2014Heaven and earth\nare no wider apart today than when shepherds listened to the angels\u2019\nsong. Humanity is still as much the object of heaven\u2019s solicitude as\nwhen common men of common occupations met angels at noonday\nand talked with the heavenly messengers in the vineyards and the\nfields. To us in the common walks of life heaven may be very near.\nAngels from the courts above will attend the steps of those who\ncome and go at God\u2019s command.9\nThe life on earth is the beginning of the life in heaven; education [535]\non earth is an initiation into the principles of heaven; the lifework\nhere is a training for the lifework there. What we now are, in char-\nacter and holy service is the sure foreshadowing of what we shall\nbe.10\nThe service rendered in sincerity of heart has great recompense.\n\u201cThy Father which seeth in secret Himself shall reward thee openly.\u201d\nBy the life we live through the grace of Christ, the character is\nformed. The original loveliness begins to be restored to the soul.\nThe attributes of the character of Christ are imparted, and the image\nof the Divine begins to shine forth. The faces of men and women\nwho walk and work with God express the peace of heaven. They\nare surrounded with the atmosphere of heaven. For these souls the\nkingdom of God has begun. They have Christ\u2019s joy, the joy of being\na blessing to humanity. They have the honor of being accepted for\nthe Master\u2019s use; they are trusted to do His work in His name.11\nAll to Be Fitted for the Society of Heaven\u2014God desires that\nheaven\u2019s plan shall be carried out, and heaven\u2019s divine order and har-\nmony prevail, in every family, in every church, in every institution.\nDid this love leaven society, we should see the outworking of no-\nble principles in Christian refinement and courtesy and in Christian\n422 The Adventist Home\ncharity toward the purchase of the blood of Christ. Spiritual trans-\nformation would be seen in all our families, in our institutions, in\nour churches. When this transformation takes place, these agencies\nwill become instrumentalities by which God will impart heaven\u2019s\nlight to the world and thus, through divine discipline and training,\nfit men and women for the society of heaven.12\nReward at the Last Great Day\u2014In your work for your children[536]\ntake hold of the mighty power of God. Commit your children to the\nLord in prayer. Work earnestly and untiringly for them. God will\nhear your prayers and will draw them to Himself. Then, at the last\ngreat day, you can bring them to God, saying, \u201cHere am I, and the\nchildren whom Thou hast given me.\u201d13\nWhen Samuel shall receive the crown of glory, he will wave it\nin honor before the throne and gladly acknowledge that the faithful\nlessons of his mother, through the merits of Christ, have crowned\nhim with immortal glory.14\nThe work of wise parents will never be appreciated by the world,\nbut when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened, their\nwork will appear as God views it and will be rewarded before men\nand angels. It will be seen that one child who has been brought up in\na faithful way has been a light in the world. It cost tears and anxiety\nand sleepless nights to oversee the character building of this child,\nbut the work was done wisely, and the parents hear the \u201cWell done\u201d\nof the Master.15\nTitle to Admission to the King\u2019s Palace \u2014Let the youth and\nthe little children be taught to choose for themselves that royal robe\nwoven in heaven\u2019s loom, the \u201cfine linen, clean and white\u201d which all\nthe holy ones of earth will wear. This robe, Christ\u2019s own spotless\ncharacter, is freely offered to every human being. But all who receive\nit will receive and wear it here.\nLet the children be taught that as they open their minds to pure,\nloving thoughts and do loving and helpful deeds, they are clothing\nthemselves with His beautiful garment of character. This apparel\nwill make them beautiful and beloved here and will hereafter be their[537]\ntitle of admission to the palace of the King. His promise is:\n\u201cThey shall walk with Me in white: for they are worthy.\u201d16\nA Divine Welcome to the Redeemed\u2014I saw a very great num-\nber of angels bring from the city glorious crowns\u2014a crown for every\nReward Here and Hereafter 423\nsaint, with his name written thereon. As Jesus called for the crowns,\nangels presented them to Him, and with His own right hand the\nlovely Jesus placed the crowns on the heads of the saints. In the\nsame manner the angels brought the harps, and Jesus presented them\nalso to the saints. The commanding angels first struck the note, and\nthen every voice was raised in grateful, happy praise; and every hand\nskillfully swept over the strings of the harp, sending forth melodious\nmusic in rich and perfect strains.\nThen I saw Jesus lead the redeemed company to the gate of the\ncity. He laid hold of the gate and swung it back on its glittering\nhinges and bade the nations that had kept the truth enter in. Within\nthe city there was everything to feast the eye. Rich glory they beheld\neverywhere. Then Jesus looked upon His redeemed saints; their\ncountenances were radiant with glory; and as He fixed His loving\neyes upon them, He said, with His rich, musical voice, \u201cI behold\nthe travail of My soul, and am satisfied. This rich glory is yours to\nenjoy eternally. Your sorrows are ended. There shall be no more\ndeath, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more\npain.\u201d I saw the redeemed host bow and cast their glittering crowns\nat the feet of Jesus; and then, as His lovely hand raised them up,\nthey touched their golden harps and filled all heaven with their rich\nmusic and songs to the Lamb....\nLanguage is altogether too feeble to attempt a description of [538]\nheaven. As the scene rises before me, I am lost in amazement.\nCarried away with the surpassing splendor and excellent glory, I lay\ndown the pen and exclaim, \u201cOh, what love! what wondrous love!\u201d\nThe most exalted language fails to describe the glory of heaven or\nthe matchless depths of a Saviour\u2019s love.17\n1The Review and Herald, November 17, 1896.\n2Testimonies for the Church 1:403.\n3Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 144.\n4The Review and Herald, August 30, 1881.\n5Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 131.\n6The Health Reformer, December, 1877.\n7The Signs of the Times, November 29, 1877.\n8Testimonies for the Church 3:566.\n9The Desire of Ages, 48.\n10Education, 307.\n11The Desire of Ages, 312.\n424 The Adventist Home\n12Testimonies for the Church 8:140.\n13Manuscript 114, 1903.\n14Good Health, March 1, 1880, par. 7.\n15The Signs of the Times, July 13, 1888.\n16Education, 249.\n17Early Writings, 288, 289.\nChapter 86\u2014Life In the Eden Home [539]\nEden to Be Restored \u2014The Garden of Eden remained upon\nthe earth long after man had become an outcast from its pleasant\npaths. The fallen race were long permitted to gaze upon the home of\ninnocence, their entrance barred only by the watching angels. At the\ncherubim-guarded gate of Paradise the divine glory was revealed.\nHither came Adam and his sons to worship God. Here they renewed\ntheir vows of obedience to that law the transgression of which had\nbanished them from Eden. When the tide of iniquity overspread the\nworld, and the wickedness of men determined their destruction by a\nflood of waters, the hand that had planted Eden withdrew it from the\nearth. But in the final restitution, when there shall be \u201ca new heaven\nand a new earth,\u201d it is to be restored more gloriously adorned than at\nthe beginning.\nThen they that have kept God\u2019s commandments shall breathe\nin immortal vigor beneath the tree of life; and through unending\nages the inhabitants of sinless worlds shall behold, in that garden of\ndelight, a sample of the perfect work of God\u2019s creation, untouched\nby the curse of sin\u2014a sample of what the whole earth would have\nbecome had man but fulfilled the Creator\u2019s glorious plan.1\nThe great plan of redemption results in fully bringing back the\nworld into God\u2019s favor. All that was lost by sin is restored. Not\nonly man but the earth is redeemed, to be the eternal abode of the\nobedient. For six thousand years Satan has struggled to maintain\npossession of the earth. Now God\u2019s original purpose in its creation is\naccomplished. \u201cThe saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, [540]\nand possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.\u201d2\n\u201cThe Redemption of the Purchased Possession.\u201d \u2014God\u2019s\noriginal purpose in the creation of the earth is fulfilled as it is made\nthe eternal abode of the redeemed. \u201cThe righteous shall inherit the\nland, and dwell therein for ever.\u201d The time has come to which holy\nmen have looked with longing since the flaming sword barred the\nfirst pair from Eden\u2014the time for \u201cthe redemption of the purchased\n425\n426 The Adventist Home\npossession.\u201d The earth originally given to man as his kingdom, be-\ntrayed by him into the hands of Satan, and so long held by the mighty\nfoe, has been brought back by the great plan of redemption.3\nAll that was lost by the first Adam will be restored by the sec-\nond. The prophet says, \u201cO Tower of the flock, the strong hold of\nthe daughter of Zion, unto Thee shall it come, even the first domin-\nion.\u201d And Paul points forward to the \u201credemption of the purchased\npossession.\u201d\nGod created the earth to be the abode of holy, happy beings. That\npurpose will be fulfilled when, renewed by the power of God and\nfreed from sin and sorrow, it shall become the eternal home of the\nredeemed.4\nAdam Restored to His Eden Home\u2014After his expulsion from\nEden Adam\u2019s life on earth was filled with sorrow. Every dying\nleaf, every victim of sacrifice, every blight upon the fair face of\nnature, every stain upon man\u2019s purity, were fresh reminders of his sin.\nTerrible was the agony of remorse as he beheld iniquity abounding\nand, in answer to his warnings, met the reproaches cast upon himself\nas the cause of sin. With patient humility he bore for nearly a\nthousand years the penalty of transgression. Faithfully did he repent[541]\nof his sin and trust in the merits of the promised Saviour, and he\ndied in the hope of a resurrection. The Son of God redeemed man\u2019s\nfailure and fall; and now, through the work of the atonement, Adam\nis reinstated in his first dominion.\nTransported with joy, he beholds the trees that were once his\ndelight\u2014the very trees whose fruit he himself had gathered in the\ndays of his innocence and joy. He sees the vines that his own hands\nhave trained, the very flowers that he once loved to care for. His mind\ngrasps the reality of the scene; he comprehends that this is indeed\nEden restored, more lovely now than when he was banished from\nit. The Saviour leads him to the tree of life and plucks the glorious\nfruit and bids him eat. He looks about him and beholds a multitude\nof his family redeemed, standing in the Paradise of God. Then he\ncasts his glittering crown at the feet of Jesus and, falling upon His\nbreast, embraces the Redeemer. He touches the golden harp, and the\nvaults of heaven echo the triumphant song, \u201cWorthy, worthy, worthy\nis the Lamb that was slain, and lives again!\u201d The family of Adam\nLife In the Eden Home 427\ntake up the strain and cast their crowns at the Saviour\u2019s feet as they\nbow before Him in adoration.\nThis reunion is witnessed by the angels who wept at the fall of\nAdam and rejoiced when Jesus, after His resurrection, ascended to\nheaven, having opened the grave for all who should believe on His\nname. Now they behold the work of redemption accomplished, and\nthey unite their voices in the song of praise.5\nMansions Prepared for Earth\u2019s Pilgrims\u2014A fear of making\nthe future inheritance seem too material has led many to spiritualize\naway the very truths which lead us to look upon it as our home.\nChrist assured His disciples that He went to prepare mansions for [542]\nthem in the Father\u2019s house. Those who accept the teachings of\nGod\u2019s word will not be wholly ignorant concerning the heavenly\nabode.... Human language is inadequate to describe the reward of\nthe righteous. It will be known only to those who behold it. No\nfinite mind can comprehend the glory of the Paradise of God.\nIn the Bible the inheritance of the saved is called a country. There\nthe heavenly Shepherd leads His flock to fountains of living waters.\nThe tree of life yields its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree\nare for the service of the nations. There are ever-flowing streams,\nclear as crystal, and beside them waving trees cast their shadows\nupon the paths prepared for the ransomed of the Lord. There the\nwidespreading plains swell into hills of beauty, and the mountains\nof God rear their lofty summits. On those peaceful plains, beside\nthose living streams, God\u2019s people, so long pilgrims and wanderers,\nshall find a home.6\nThere are homes for the pilgrims of earth. There are robes for\nthe righteous, with crowns of glory and palms of victory. All that\nhas perplexed us in the providences of God will in the world to\ncome be made plain. The things hard to be understood will then find\nexplanation. The mysteries of grace will unfold before us. Where\nour finite minds discovered only confusion and broken promises, we\nshall see the most perfect and beautiful harmony. We shall know\nthat infinite love ordered the experiences that seemed most trying.\nAs we realize the tender care of Him who makes all things work\ntogether for our good, we shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and full\nof glory....\n428 The Adventist Home\nWe are homeward bound. He who loved us so much as to die\nfor us hath builded for us a city. The New Jerusalem is our place of\nrest. There will be no sadness in the City of God. No wail of sorrow,[543]\nno dirge of crushed hopes and buried affections, will evermore be\nheard. Soon the garments of heaviness will be changed for the\nwedding garment. Soon we shall witness the coronation of our King.\nThose whose lives have been hidden with Christ, those who on this\nearth have fought the good fight of faith, will shine forth with the\nRedeemer\u2019s glory in the kingdom of God.7\nPrivileges of the Redeemed\u2014Heaven is a good place. I long to\nbe there and behold my lovely Jesus, who gave His life for me, and\nbe changed into His glorious image. Oh, for language to express the\nglory of the bright world to come! I thirst for the living streams that\nmake glad the city of our God.\nThe Lord has given me a view of other worlds. Wings were\ngiven me, and an angel attended me from the city to a place that was\nbright and glorious. The grass of the place was living green, and\nthe birds there warbled a sweet song. The inhabitants of the place\nwere of all sizes; they were noble, majestic, and lovely. They bore\nthe express image of Jesus, and their countenances beamed with\nholy joy, expressive of the freedom and happiness of the place. I\nasked one of them why they were so much more lovely than those\non the earth. The reply was, \u201cWe have lived in strict obedience to\nthe commandments of God, and have not fallen by disobedience,\nlike those on the earth.\u201d ... I begged of my attending angel to let me\nremain in that place. I could not bear the thought of coming back to\nthis dark world again. Then the angel said, \u201cYou must go back, and\nif you are faithful, you, with the 144,000, shall have the privilege of\nvisiting all the worlds and viewing the handiwork of God.\u201d8\nThe United Family of Heaven and Earth \u2014There the re-[544]\ndeemed shall \u201cknow, even as also they are known.\u201d The loves and\nsympathies which God Himself has planted in the soul shall there\nfind truest and sweetest exercise. The pure communion with holy be-\nings, the harmonious social life with the blessed angels and with the\nfaithful ones of all ages who have washed their robes and made them\nwhite in the blood of the Lamb, the sacred ties that bind together\n\u201cthe whole family in heaven and earth\u201d\u2014these help to constitute the\nhappiness of the redeemed.9\nLife In the Eden Home 429\nThe nations of the saved will know no other law than the law of\nheaven. All will be a happy, united family, clothed with the garments\nof praise and thanksgiving. Over the scene the morning stars will\nsing together, and the sons of God will shout for joy, while God and\nChrist will unite in proclaiming, \u201cThere shall be no more sin, neither\nshall there be any more death.\u201d10\nFrom that scene of heavenly joy [the ascension of Christ] there\ncomes back to us on earth the echo of Christ\u2019s own wonderful words,\n\u201cI ascend unto My Father, and your Father; and to My God, and your\nGod.\u201d The family of heaven and the family of earth are one. For us\nour Lord ascended, and for us He lives. \u201cWherefore He is able also\nto save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing\nHe ever liveth to make intercession for them.\u201d11\nThough Delayed, the Promise Is Sure\u2014Long have we waited\nfor our Saviour\u2019s return. But none the less sure is the promise. Soon\nwe shall be in our promised home. There Jesus will lead us beside\nthe living stream flowing from the throne of God and will explain\nto us the dark providences through which on this earth He brought\nus in order to perfect our characters. There we shall behold with [545]\nundimmed vision the beauties of Eden restored. Casting at the feet\nof the Redeemer the crowns that He has placed on our heads and\ntouching our golden harps, we shall fill all heaven with praise to\nHim that sitteth on the throne.12\nLet all that is beautiful in our earthly home remind us of the\ncrystal river and green fields, the waving trees and the living foun-\ntains, the shining city and the white-robed singers, of our heavenly\nhome\u2014that world of beauty which no artist can picture, no mortal\ntongue describe. \u201cEye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have\nentered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared\nfor them that love Him.\u201d13\n1Patriarchs and Prophets, 62.\n2Ibid., 342.\n3The Signs of the Times, December 29, 1909.\n4The Review and Herald, October 22, 1908.\n5The Great Controversy, 647, 648.\n6The Review and Herald, October 22, 1908.\n7Testimonies for the Church 9:286, 287.\n8Early Writings, 39, 40.\n430 The Adventist Home\n9The Great Controversy, 677.\n10Prophets and Kings, 732, 733.\n11The Desire of Ages, 835.\n12Testimonies for the Church 8:254.\n13The Review and Herald, July 11, 1882.\nChapter 87\u2014Pen Pictures of the New Earth [546]\nVisions of Future Glory \u2014With Jesus at our head we all de-\nscended from the city down to this earth, on a great and mighty\nmountain, which could not bear Jesus up, and it parted asunder, and\nthere was a mighty plain. Then we looked up and saw the great city,\nwith twelve foundations and twelve gates, three on each side, and\nan angel at each gate. We all cried out, \u201cThe city, the great city, it\u2019s\ncoming, it\u2019s coming down from God out of heaven!\u201d And it came\nand settled on the place where we stood. Then we began to look at\nthe glorious things outside of the city. There I saw most glorious\nhouses, that had the appearance of silver, supported by four pillars\nset with pearls most glorious to behold. These were to be inhabited\nby the saints. In each was a golden shelf. I saw many of the saints\ngo into the houses, take off their glittering crowns and lay them on\nthe shelf, then go out into the field by the houses to do something\nwith the earth; not as we have to do with the earth here\u2014no, no. A\nglorious light shone all about their heads, and they were continually\nshouting and offering praises to God.\nI saw another field full of all kinds of flowers, and as I plucked\nthem, I cried out, \u201cThey will never fade!\u201d Next I saw a field of\ntall grass, most glorious to behold; it was living green and had a\nreflection of silver and gold as it waved proudly to the glory of King\nJesus. Then we entered a field full of all kinds of beasts\u2014the lion,\nthe lamb, the leopard, and the wolf, all together in perfect union. We\npassed through the midst of them, and they followed on peaceably\nafter.\nThen we entered a wood, not like the dark woods we have here\u2014 [547]\nno, no; but light, and all over glorious; the branches of the trees\nmoved to and fro, and we all cried out, \u201cWe will dwell safely in the\nwilderness and sleep in the woods.\u201d1\nGraduate Work in the Hereafter\u2014Do you think we shall not\nlearn anything there? We have not the slightest idea of what will then\nbe opened before us. With Christ we shall walk beside the living\n431\n432 The Adventist Home\nwaters. He will unfold to us the beauty and glory of nature. He will\nreveal what He is to us and what we are to Him. Truth we cannot\nknow now because of finite limitations, we shall know hereafter.2\nThe Christian family is to be a training school from which chil-\ndren are to graduate to a higher school in the mansions of God.3\nHeaven is a school; its field of study, the universe; its teacher,\nthe Infinite One. A branch of this school was established in Eden;\nand, the plan of redemption accomplished, education will again be\ntaken up in the Eden school....\nBetween the school established in Eden at the beginning and\nthe school of the hereafter there lies the whole compass of this\nworld\u2019s history\u2014the history of human transgression and suffering,\nof divine sacrifice, and of victory over death and sin.... Restored to\nHis presence, man will again, as at the beginning, be taught of God:\n\u201cMy people shall know My name: ... they shall know in that day\nthat I am He that doth speak: behold, it is I.\u201d ...\nThere, when the veil that darkens our vision shall be removed\nand our eyes shall behold that world of beauty of which we now\ncatch glimpses through the microscope; when we look on the glories[548]\nof the heavens, now scanned afar through the telescope; when, the\nblight of sin removed, the whole earth shall appear \u201cin the beauty of\nthe Lord our God,\u201d what a field will be open to our study!4\nHeavenly Knowledge Will Be Progressive\u2014All the treasures\nof the universe will be open to the study of God\u2019s redeemed. Un-\nfettered by mortality, they wing their tireless flight to worlds afar\u2014\nworlds that thrilled with sorrow at the spectacle of human woe and\nrang with songs of gladness at the tidings of a ransomed soul. With\nunutterable delight the children of earth enter into the joy and the\nwisdom of unfallen beings. They share the treasures of knowledge\nand understanding gained through the ages upon ages in contempla-\ntion of God\u2019s handiwork. With undimmed vision they gaze upon the\nglory of creation\u2014suns and stars and systems, all in their appointed\norder circling the throne of Deity. Upon all things, from the least to\nthe greatest, the Creator\u2019s name is written, and in all are the riches\nof His power displayed.\nAnd the years of eternity, as they roll, will bring richer and still\nmore glorious revelations of God and of Christ. As knowledge is\nprogressive, so will love, reverence, and happiness increase. The\nPen Pictures of the New Earth 433\nmore men learn of God, the greater will be their admiration of His\ncharacter.5\nSocial Life\u2014There we shall know even as also we are known.\nThere the loves and sympathies that God has planted in the soul\nwill find truest and sweetest exercise. The pure communion with\nholy beings, the harmonious social life with the blessed angels and\nwith the faithful ones of all ages, the sacred fellowship that binds\ntogether \u201cthe whole family in heaven and earth\u201d\u2014all are among the [549]\nexperiences of the hereafter.6\nOccupations in the New Earth \u2014In the earth made new the\nredeemed will engage in the occupations and pleasures that brought\nhappiness to Adam and Eve in the beginning. The Eden life will\nbe lived, the life in garden and field. \u201cThey shall build houses, and\ninhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of\nthem. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant,\nand another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of My people,\nand Mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.\u201d7\nThere every power will be developed, every capability increased.\nThe grandest enterprises will be carried forward, the loftiest aspira-\ntions will be reached, the highest ambitions realized. And still there\nwill arise new heights to surmount, new wonders to admire, new\ntruths to comprehend, fresh objects to call forth the powers of body\nand mind and soul.8\nOn the Verge of Fulfillment\u2014We are living in a most solemn\nperiod of this earth\u2019s history. There is never time to sin; it is always\nperilous to continue in transgression, but in a special sense is this\ntrue at the present time. We are now upon the very borders of the\neternal world and stand in a more solemn relation to time and to\neternity than ever before. Now let every person search his own heart\nand plead for the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness to expel\nall spiritual darkness and cleanse from defilement.9\nTo us who are standing on the very verge of their fulfillment, of\nwhat deep moment, what living interest, are these delineations of the\nthings to come\u2014events for which, since our first parents turned their [550]\nsteps from Eden, God\u2019s children have watched and waited, longed\nand prayed!\nFellow pilgrim, we are still amid the shadows and turmoil of\nearthly activities, but soon our Saviour is to appear to bring deliv-\n434 The Adventist Home\nerance and rest. Let us by faith behold the blessed hereafter, as\npictured by the hand of God.10\nAn Appeal for Personal Preparation\u2014I urge you to prepare\nfor the coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven. Day by day cast the\nlove of the world out of your hearts. Understand by experience what\nit means to have fellowship with Christ. Prepare for the judgment,\nthat when Christ shall come to be admired in all them that believe,\nyou may be among those who will meet Him in peace. In that day\nthe redeemed will shine forth in the glory of the Father and the Son.\nThe angels, touching their golden harps, will welcome the King and\nHis trophies of victory\u2014those who have been washed and made\nwhite in the blood of the Lamb. A song of triumph shall peal forth,\nfilling all heaven. Christ has conquered. He enters the heavenly\ncourts, accompanied by His redeemed ones, the witnesses that His\nmission of suffering and sacrifice has not been in vain.11\n1Early Writings, 17, 18.\n2Counsels to Teachers, Parents, and Students, 162.\n3The Review and Herald, March 30, 1897.\n4Education, 301-303.\n5The Great Controversy, 677, 678.\n6Education, 306.\n7Prophets and Kings, 730, 731.\n8Education, 307.\n9Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 147.\n10Prophets and Kings, 731, 732.\n11Testimonies for the Church 9:285, 286.",
