teachings, ex-\nperiences, and enterprises of the newly established remnant church,\nvolume 2 is devoted almost entirely to the personal piety of its mem-\nbers. During the thirteen years paralleled by the fourteen testimony\npamphlets now forming volume 1, the publishing work was solidi-\nfied, the church was organized, its system of finance was established,\nand it had launched into a great health program. When the closing\narticle was written, literature was pouring in a steady stream from its\npresses at the Review and Herald publishing plant at Battle Creek,\nMichigan, and, near by, the newly established sanitarium was in full\noperation. The dark hours of the Civil War years were in the past,\nand for the church it was a day of opportunity. The task before it\nwas to hold the ground gained and to enlarge its borders. Vital to the\ncontinued success of the church was the integrity of its individual\nmembers.\nEarly in 1868, as explained in an article now found near the close\nof volume 1, Ellen G. White began to publish, for the benefit of the\nchurch as a whole, certain personal testimonies which up to that time\nhad not been distributed generally. Of these personal testimonies\nshe stated: \u201cThey all contain more or less reproof and instruction\nwhich apply to hundreds or thousands of others in similar condition.\nThese should have the light which God has seen fit to give which\nmeets their cases.\u201d\u2014V ol. 1, p. 631.\nSuch instruction addressed personally to individual church mem-\nbers through the three-year period of February, 1868, to May, 1871,\ncomprises almost the entire content of Testimonies Nos. 15-20, now\nembodied in this volume 2. The instruction is pointed and practical,\ndealing with almost every phase of personal experience and religious\ninterests, from gossip, the indulgence of appetite, and the marriage[6]\nrelationship to misdirected zeal, avariciousness, and fanaticism.\nvi\nTimes of Volume Two vii\nAt the beginning of the period of time covered by volume 2 Elder\nand Mrs. White were in partial retirement in Greenville, Michigan,\ndue to the condition of Elder White\u2019s health. They soon resumed\ntheir activity in traveling and holding meetings with the believers in\nstates adjacent to michigan. In November, 1868, they returned to\nBattle Creek to make their home there.\nTwo months earlier, in September of 1868, a camp meeting was\nheld in Wright, Michigan. This gathering, the first of its kind, proved\nsuch a great blessing to those who attended that the following years\nwitnessed the establishment of camp meetings as a regular part of the\nprogram for the state conferences. Elder and Mrs. White\u2019s presence\nwas called for, and so it came that the summer months in succeeding\nyears were largely spent by them in these annual gatherings. In\nthe latter part of volume 2 may be found counsel regarding such\n\u201cconvocations.\u201d\nDuring the three-year period covered by volume 2 there was en-\ncouraging advance in the cause of present truth. The Health Institute\nat Battle Creek, having passed through a discouraging depression,\nnow emerged into a period of prosperity. In the latter part of 1868\nElders J. N. Loughborough and D. T. Bourdeau lighted the torch\nof Seventh-day Adventism on the Pacific Coast. The same year\na company of fifty Sabbathkeeping Adventists in Europe entered\ninto correspondence with the General Conference brethren in Battle\nCreek, and the next year sent a representative across the ocean to\nplead for missionaries to be sent to them.\nBut, with all these gains and advance moves, the adversary con-\ntinued to work earnestly to lower the spirituality of church members,\nto cause them to love the world and its attractions, to leaven the\nchurch with the spirit of criticism, to dry up the springs of benevo-\nlence, and especially to bring the youth into his ranks. Against these [7]\ndangerous trends Mrs. White, as God\u2019s messenger, was faithfully\nand earnestly delivering her messages by voice and pen, calling the\nmembers of the church to God\u2019s standard of integrity and righteous-\nness.\nOn some occasions Mrs. White was given revelations pertaining\nto the experience of a number of individuals in one church. Having\ndelivered these individual testimonies in meeting, she afterward\nviii Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwrote out the instruction and sent it to the church concerned. A\nnumber of such communications are found in volume 2.\nThe thoughtful reader of this 711-page volume must be im-\npressed not only with the great diversity of subjects covered, but also\nwith the vast amount of writing devoted to such personal testimonies\nwritten during this brief time. Yet it should be noted that what was\npublished represented only a portion of what Mrs. White wrote\nduring this period.\nA few weeks before the appearance of No. 15 elder white had\npenned a note for the Review and Herald, asking that those to whom\noral testimony had been given by Mrs. White should patiently wait\nuntil they might receive written copies. Of Mrs. White\u2019s diligence\nand persistence in this work, he said:\n\u201cIn this branch of her labor she has about two months\u2019 work\non hand. On her eastern tour she improved all her spare time in\nwriting such testimonies. She even wrote many of them in meeting\nwhile others were preaching and speaking. Since her return she\nhas injured her health and strength in confining herself too closely\nto this work. She usually writes from twenty to forty pages each\nday.\u201d\u2014The Review and Herald, March 3, 1868.\nWe may well imagine Mrs. White\u2019s relief on the issuance of\nTestimony No. 15 and her anticipation of a much-needed rest, but ten\ndays later she was again plunged into the task of delivering the many\nmessages entrusted to her. On Friday evening, June 12, she was at\nbattle creek speaking \u201cTo the young generally,\u201d and \u201chad addressed[8]\nseveral personally,\u201d until nearly ten o\u2019clock, when, as reported by\nElder White:\n\u201cWhile speaking from the platform in front of the pulpit, in\nthe most solemn and impressive manner, the power of God came\nupon her, and in an instant she fell upon the carpet in vision. Many\nwitnessed this manifestation for the first time, with astonishment,\nand with perfect satisfaction that it was the work of God. The vision\nlasted twenty minutes.\u201d\u2014The Review and Herald, June 16, 1868.\nBy actual count 120 pages ofTestimonies volume 2 are definitely\nstated to have been written setting forth counsel given in this vision\nof June 12, 1868, for the church or for individuals. Many more pages\nwere written setting forth views given that same year at Pilot Grove,\nIowa, October 2, and at Adams Center, New York, October 25.\nTimes of Volume Two ix\nThese many visions led Mrs White to write almost incessantly.\nIn giving a report of their traveling by boat up the Mississippi river\nin 1870, Elder White comments:\n\u201cMrs. White is writing. Poor woman! This almost eternal\nwriting for this one and that one, when she should rest and enjoy the\nbeautiful scenery and the pleasant society, seems too bad, but God\nblesses and sustains, and we must be reconciled.\u201d\u2014The Review and\nHerald, July 5, 1870.\nWhat a blessing these many testimonies addressed at first person-\nally to individuals have been to the church. What church member, as\nhe has read these earnest counsels and warnings, has not discovered\nthat the problems, the temptations, and the privileges of Seventh-day\nAdventists of earlier years are his problems, temptations, and privi-\nleges today. We treasure these messages especially because Ellen\nG. White herself states in her introduction which opens volume 2:\n\u201cThere is no more direct and forcible way of presenting what the\nLord has shown me.\u201d\nThe Trustees of the\nEllen G. White Publications.\nx Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nNumber Fifteen\u2014Testimony for the [9]\nChurch\nIntroduction\nMy brethren and sisters will hardly expect this number of my\nTestimonies so soon. But I had many personal testimonies on hand,\nsome of which are given in the following pages. And I know of no\nbetter way to present my views of general dangers and errors, and\nthe duty of all who love God and keep His commandments, than\nby giving these testimonies. Perhaps there is no more direct and\nforcible way of presenting what the Lord has shown me.\nIt seemed important that No. 14 should reach you several days\nbefore the General Conference. Therefore that number was hastened\nthrough the press before I could find time to prepare important matter\ndesigned for it. In fact, there was not room for this matter in No. 14.\nTherefore, having on hand matter sufficient for No. 15, I present it\nto you with the prayer that the blessing of God will attend it for the\ngood of His dear people.\n12\nChapter 1\u2014Sketch of Experience [10]\nFrom February 7, 1868, to May 20, 1868\nAfter we had reached our home, and ceased to feel the inspiring\ninfluence of journeying and laboring, we felt most sensibly the\nwearing labors of our eastern tour. Many were urging me by letters\nto write what I had related to them of what the Lord had shown me\nconcerning them. And there were many others to whom I had not\nspoken whose cases were as important and urgent. But in my weary\ncondition the task of so much writing seemed more than I could\nendure. A feeling of discouragement came over me, and I sank into\na feeble state and remained so several days, frequently fainting. In\nthis state of body and mind I called in question my duty to write so\nmuch, to so many persons, some of them very unworthy. It seemed\nto me that there was certainly a mistake in this matter somewhere.\nOn the evening of February 5 Brother Andrews spoke to the\npeople in our house of worship. But most of that evening I was in\na fainting, breathless condition, supported by my husband. When\nBrother Andrews returned from the meeting, they had a special\nseason of prayer for me, and I found some relief. That night I slept\nwell, and in the morning, though feeble, felt wonderfully relieved\nand encouraged. I had dreamed that a person brought to me a web of\nwhite cloth, and bade me cut it into garments for persons of all sizes\nand all descriptions of character and circumstances in life. I was\ntold to cut them out and hang them up all ready to be made when\ncalled for. I had the impression that many for whom I was required\nto cut garments were unworthy. I inquired if that was the last piece\nof cloth I should have to cut, and was told that it was not; that as\nsoon as I had finished this one, there were others for me to take hold [11]\nof. I felt discouraged at the amount of work before me, and stated\nthat I had been engaged in cutting garments for others for more than\ntwenty years, and my labors had not been appreciated, neither did\nI see that my work had accomplished much good. I spoke to the\n13\n14 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nperson who brought the cloth to me, of one woman in particular, for\nwhom he had told me to cut a garment. I stated that she would not\nprize the garment, and that it would be a loss of time and material to\npresent it to her. She was very poor, of inferior intellect, and untidy\nin her habits, and would soon soil it.\nThe person replied: \u201cCut out the garments. That is your duty.\nThe loss is not yours, but mine. God sees not as man sees. He lays\nout the work that He would have done, and you do not know which\nwill prosper, this or that. It will be found that many such poor souls\nwill go into the kingdom, while others, who are favored with all the\nblessings of life, having good intellects and pleasant surroundings,\ngiving them all the advantages of improvement, will be left out. It\nwill be seen that these poor souls have lived up to the feeble light\nwhich they had, and have improved by the limited means within\ntheir reach, and lived much more acceptably than some others who\nhave enjoyed full light and ample means for improvement.\u201d\nI then held up my hands, calloused as they were with long use\nof the shears, and stated that I could but shrink at the thought of\npursuing this kind of labor. The person again repeated:\n\u201cCut out the garments. Your release has not yet come.\u201d\nWith feelings of great weariness I arose to engage in the work.\nBefore me lay new, polished shears, which I commenced using.\nAt once my feelings of weariness and discouragement left me; the\nshears seemed to cut with hardly an effort on my part, and I cut out[12]\ngarment after garment with comparative ease.\nWith the encouragement which this dream gave me, I at once\ndecided to accompany my husband and Brother Andrews to Gratiot,\nSaginaw, and Tuscola Counties, and trust in the Lord to give me\nstrength to labor. So, on the 7th of February, we left home, and rode\nfifty-five miles to our appointment at Alma. Here I labored as usual,\nwith a comfortable degree of freedom and strength. The friends\nin Gratiot County seemed interested to hear, but many of them\nare far behind on the health reform and in the work of preparation\ngenerally. There seemed to be among this people a want of the\norder and efficiency necessary to prosperity in the work and spirit of\nthe message. Brother Andrews, however, visited them three weeks\nlater and enjoyed a good season with them. I will not pass over a\nmatter of encouragement to me, that a very pointed testimony which\nSketch of Experience 15\nI had written to one family was received with profit to the persons\naddressed. We still feel a deep interest in that family and ardently\ndesire that they may enjoy prosperity in the Lord, and although we\nfeel some discouragement as to the cause in Gratiot County we shall\nbe anxious to help the brethren when they feel anxious to be helped.\nAt the Alma meeting there were brethren present from St.\nCharles and Tittabawassee, Saginaw County, who urged us to visit\nthem. We had not designed to enter this county at present, but to\nvisit Tuscola County if the way opened. Not hearing from Tuscola,\nwe decided to visit Tittabawassee, and meantime write to Tuscola\nCounty and inquire if we were wanted there. At Tittabawassee we\nwere happily disappointed to find a large house of worship, recently\nbuilt by our people, well filled with Sabbathkeepers. The brethren\nseemed ready for our testimony, and we enjoyed freedom. A great\nand good work had been done in this place through the faithful labors\nof Brother A. Much bitter opposition and persecution had followed, [13]\nbut this seemed to melt away with those who came to hear, and our\nlabors seemed to make a good impression upon all. I attended eleven\nmeetings in this place in one week, spoke several times from one to\ntwo hours, and took part in the other meetings. At one meeting an\neffort was made to induce certain ones who observe the Sabbath to\nmove forward and take up the cross. The duty before most of these\nwas baptism. In my last vision I saw places where the truth would\nbe preached and bring out churches which we should visit. This was\none of those places. I felt a peculiar interest for this people. The\ncases of certain ones in the congregation opened before me, and a\nspirit of labor for them came upon me which I could not throw off.\nFor about three hours I labored for them, most of the time appealing\nto them with feelings of the deepest solicitude. All took the cross\non that occasion and came forward for prayers, and nearly all spoke.\nThe next day fifteen were baptized.\nNo one can visit this people without being impressed with the\nvalue of Brother A\u2019s faithful labors in this cause. His work is to\nenter places where the truth has not been proclaimed, and I hope our\npeople will cease their efforts to draw him from his specific work.\nIn the spirit of humility he can go forth, leaning upon the arm of the\nLord, and rescue many souls from the powers of darkness. May the\nblessing of God still be with him.\n16 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nAs our series of meetings in this place was near its close, Brother\nSpooner of Tuscola came for us to visit that county. We sent ap-\npointments by him as he returned on Monday, and we followed on\nThursday after the baptism. At Vassar we held our meetings Sab-\nbath and first day at the union schoolhouse. This was a free place\nin which to speak, and we saw good fruit of our labors. First-day\nafternoon about thirty backsliders, and children who had made no\nprofession, came forward. This was a very interesting and profitable[14]\nmeeting. Some were drawing back from the cause, for whom we\nespecially felt to labor. But the time was short, and it seemed to\nme that we should leave the work unfinished. But our appointments\nwere out for St. Charles and Alma, and to meet them we must close\nour labors in Vassar on Monday.\nThat night what I had seen in vision concerning certain persons\nin Tuscola County was revived in a dream, and I was still more\nimpressed that my work for that people was not done. Yet I saw no\nother way only to go on to our appointments. Tuesday we journeyed\nthirty-two miles to St. Charles and stopped for the night with Brother\nGriggs. Here I wrote fifteen pages of testimony, and attended meet-\ning in the evening. Wednesday morning we decided to return to\nTuscola if Brother Andrews would fill the appointment at Alma. To\nthis he agreed. That morning I wrote fifteen pages more, attended\na meeting and spoke one hour, and we rode thirty-three miles with\nBrother and Sister Griggs to Brother Spooner\u2019s in Tuscola. Thurs-\nday morning we went to Watrousville, a distance of sixteen miles. I\nwrote sixteen pages, and attended an evening meeting, in which I\ngave a very pointed testimony to one present. The next morning I\nwrote twelve pages before breakfast, and returned to Tuscola, and\nwrote eight pages more.\nSabbath my husband spoke in the forenoon, and I followed for\ntwo hours before taking food. The meeting was then closed for\na few moments, and I took a little food, and afterward spoke in a\nsocial meeting for one hour, bearing pointed testimonies for several\npresent. These testimonies were generally received with feelings\nof humility and gratitude. I cannot, however, say that all were so\nreceived.\nThe next morning, as we were about to leave for the house of\nworship to engage in the arduous labors of the day, a sister for whom\nSketch of Experience 17\nI had a testimony that she lacked discretion and caution, and did not [15]\nfully control her words and actions, came in with her husband and\nmanifested feelings of great unreconciliation and agitation. She com-\nmenced to talk and to weep. She murmured a little, and confessed a\nlittle, and justified self considerably. She had a wrong idea of many\nthings I had stated to her. Her pride was touched as I brought out her\nfaults in so public a manner. Here was evidently the main difficulty.\nBut why should she feel thus? The brethren and sisters knew these\nthings were so, therefore I was not informing them of anything new.\nBut I doubt not that it was new to the sister herself. She did not\nknow herself, and could not properly judge of her own words and\nacts. This is in a degree true of nearly all, hence the necessity of\nfaithful reproofs in the church and the cultivation by all its members\nof love for the plain testimony.\nHer husband seemed to feel unreconciled to my bringing out her\nfaults before the church and stated that if Sister White had followed\nthe directions of our Lord in Matthew 18:15-17 he should not have\nfelt hurt: \u201cMoreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go\nand tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear\nthee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then\ntake with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three\nwitnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect\nto hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the\nchurch, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.\u201d\nMy husband then stated that he should understand that these\nwords of our Lord had reference to cases of personal trespass, and\ncould not be applied in the case of this sister. She had not trespassed\nagainst Sister White. But that which had been reproved publicly was\npublic wrongs which threatened the prosperity of the church and\nthe cause. Here, said my husband, is a text applicable to the case:\n1 Timothy 5:20 : \u201cThem that sin rebuke before all, that others also\nmay fear.\u201d\nThe brother acknowledged his error like a Christian and seemed [16]\nreconciled to the matter. It was evident that since the meeting of\nSabbath afternoon they had got many things about the matter won-\nderfully magnified and wrong. It was therefore proposed that the\nwritten testimony be read. When this was done, the sister who\nwas reproved by it, inquired: \u201cIs that what you stated yesterday?\u201d I\n18 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nreplied that it was. She seemed surprised and quite reconciled to the\nwritten testimony. This I gave her, without reserving a copy. Here\nI did wrong. But I had such tender regard for her and her husband,\nand such ardent desires and hopes for their prosperity, that, in this\ncase, I broke over an established custom.\nAlready meeting time was passing, and we hastened one mile and\na half to the waiting congregation. The reader may judge whether\nthe scene of that morning was well adapted to aid us in the collection\nof thought and nerve necessary to stand before the people. But\nwho thinks of this? Some may, and show a little mercy, while\nthe impulsive and careless will come with their burdens and trials,\ngenerally just before we are to speak, or when perfectly exhausted by\nspeaking. My husband, however, summoned all his energies, and by\nrequest spoke with freedom on the law and the gospel. I had received\nan invitation to speak in the afternoon in the new house of worship\nrecently built and dedicated by the Methodists. This commodious\nbuilding was crowded, and many were obliged to stand. I spoke with\nfreedom for about an hour and a half upon the first of the two great\ncommandments repeated by our Lord, and was surprised to learn\nthat it was the same from which the Methodist minister had spoken\nin the forenoon. He and his people were present to hear what I had\nto say.\nIn the evening we had a precious interview at Brother Spooner\u2019s\nwith Brethren Miller, Hatch, and Haskell, and Sisters Sturges, Bliss,\nHarrison, and Malin. We now felt that our work for the present was[17]\ndone in Tuscola County. We became very much interested in this\ndear people, yet feared that the sister referred to, for whom I had\na testimony, would let Satan take advantage of her and cause them\ntrouble. I felt an earnest desire that she might view the matter in\nits true light. The course she had been pursuing was destroying her\ninfluence in the church and outside of it. But now, if she would\nreceive the needed reproof, and humbly seek to improve by it, the\nchurch would take her anew into their hearts, and the people would\nthink more of her Christianity. And what is better still, she could\nenjoy the approving smiles of her dear Redeemer. Would she fully\nreceive the testimony? was my anxious inquiry. I feared that she\nwould not and that the hearts of the brethren in that county would\nbe saddened on her account.\nSketch of Experience 19\nAfter returning home, I sent to her for a copy of the testimony,\nand on the 15th of April received the following, dated at Denmark,\nApril 11, 1868: \u201cSister White: Yours of the 23d ult. Is at hand. Am\nsorry I cannot comply with your request.\u201d\nI shall still cherish the tenderest feelings of regard for this family,\nand shall be happy to help them when I can. It is true that such\ntreatment from those for whom I give my life casts a shade of\nsadness over me; but my course has been so plainly marked out for\nme that I cannot let such things keep me from the path of duty. As\nI returned from the post office with the above note, feeling rather\ndepressed in spirit, I took the Bible, and opened it with the prayer\nthat I might find comfort and support therein, and my eye rested\ndirectly upon the following words of the prophet: \u201cThou therefore\ngird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command\nthee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before\nthem. For, behold, I have made thee this day a defensed city, and an\niron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings [18]\nof Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and\nagainst the people of the land. And they shall fight against thee; but\nthey shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord,\nto deliver thee.\u201d Jeremiah 1:17-19.\nWe returned home from this tour just before a great fall of rain\nwhich carried off the snow. This storm prevented the next Sabbath\nmeeting, and I immediately commenced to prepare matter for Tes-\ntimony No. 14. We also had the privilege of caring for our dear\nBrother King, whom we brought to our home with a terrible injury\nupon the head and face. We took him to our house to die, for we\ncould not think it possible for one with the skull so terribly broken\nin to recover. But with the blessing of God upon a very gentle use\nof water, a very spare diet till the danger of fever was past, and\nwell-ventilated rooms day and night, in three weeks he was able\nto return to his home and attend to his farming interests. He did\nnot take one grain of medicine from first to last. Although he was\nconsiderably reduced by loss of blood from his wounds and by spare\ndiet, yet when he could take a more liberal amount of food he came\nup rapidly.\nAbout this time we commenced labor for our brethren and friends\nnear Greenville. As is the case in many places, our brethren needed\n20 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nhelp. There were some who kept the Sabbath, yet did not belong to\nthe church, and also some who had given up the Sabbath, who needed\nhelp. We felt disposed to help these poor souls, but the past course\nand present position of leading members of the church in relation to\nthese persons made it almost impossible for us to approach them. In\nlaboring with the erring, some of our brethren had been too rigid,\ntoo cutting in remarks. And when some were disposed to reject\ntheir counsel and separate from them, they would say: \u201cWell, if they\nwant to go off, let them go.\u201d While such a lack of the compassion,\nand long-suffering, and tenderness of Jesus was manifested by His[19]\nprofessed followers, these poor, erring, inexperienced souls, buffeted\nby Satan, were certain to make shipwreck of faith. However great\nmay be the wrongs and sins of the erring, our brethren must learn to\nmanifest not only the tenderness of the Great Shepherd, but also His\nundying care and love for the poor, straying sheep. Our ministers toil\nand lecture week after week, and rejoice that a few souls embrace\nthe truth; and yet brethren of a prompt, decided turn of mind may,\nin five minutes, destroy their work by indulging the feelings which\nprompt words like these: \u201cWell, if they want to leave us, let them\ngo.\u201d\nWe found that we could do nothing for the scattered sheep near us\nuntil we had first corrected the wrongs in many of the members of the\nchurch. They had let these poor souls wander. They felt no burden\nfor them. In fact, they seemed shut up to themselves, and were dying\na spiritual death for want of spiritual exercise. They still loved the\ngeneral cause, and were ready to help sustain it. They would take\ngood care of the servants of God. But there was a decided want of\ncare for widows, orphans, and the feeble of the flock. Besides some\ninterest for the cause in general, there was but little apparent interest\nfor any only their own families. With so narrow a religion they were\ndying a spiritual death.\nThere were some who kept the Sabbath, attended meeting, and\npaid systematic benevolence, yet were out of the church. And it is\ntrue that they were not fit to belong to any church. But while leading\nchurch members stood as some in that church did, giving them little\nor no encouragement, it was almost impossible for them to arise\nin the strength of God and do better. As we began to labor with\nthe church, and teach them that they must have a spirit of labor for\nSketch of Experience 21\nthe erring, much that I had seen relative to the cause in that place,\nopened before me, and I wrote out pointed testimonies not only for\nthose who had erred greatly and were out of the church, but for those [20]\nmembers in the church who had erred greatly in not going in search\nof the lost sheep. And I was never more disappointed in the manner\nin which these testimonies were received. When those who had been\ngreatly in fault were reproved by most pointed testimonies, read to\nthem publicly, they received them, and confessed with tears. But\nsome of those in the church, who claimed to be the fast friends of\nthe cause and the Testimonies, could hardly think it possible that\nthey had been as wrong as the testimonies declared them to be.\nWhen told that they were self-caring, shut up to themselves and\nfamilies; that they had failed to care for others, had been exclusive,\nand had left precious souls to perish; that they were in danger of\nbeing overbearing and self-righteous, they were brought into a state\nof great agitation and trial.\nBut this experience was just what they needed to teach them for-\nbearance toward others in a similar state of trial. There are many who\nfeel sure that they will have no trial respecting the Testimonies, and\ncontinue to feel so till they are tested. They think it strange that any\ncan doubt. They are severe with those who manifest doubts, and cut\nand slash, to show their zeal for the Testimonies, manifesting more\nself-righteousness than humility. But when the Lord reproves them\nfor their wrongs, they find themselves as weak as water. Then they\ncan hardly endure the trial. These things should teach them humility,\nself-abasement, tenderness, and undying love for the erring.\nIt seems to me that the Lord is giving the erring, the weak and\ntrembling, and even those who have apostatized from the truth, a\nspecial call to come fully into the fold. But there are but few in our\nchurches who feel that this is the case. And there are still fewer who\nstand where they can help such. There are more who stand directly\nin the way of these poor souls. Very many have an exacting spirit.\nThey require them to come to just such and such terms before they [21]\nwill reach to them the helping hand. Thus they hold them off at\narms\u2019 length. They have not learned that they have a special duty\nto go and search for these lost sheep. They must not wait till these\ncome to them. Read the touching parable of the lost sheep. Luke\n15:1-7 : \u201cThen drew near unto Him all the publicans and sinners\n22 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nfor to hear Him. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying,\nThis Man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them. And He spake\nthis parable unto them, saying, What man of you, having an hundred\nsheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in\nthe wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? And\nwhen he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And\nwhen he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbors,\nsaying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which\nwas lost. I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one\nsinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons,\nwhich need no repentance.\u201d\nThe Pharisees murmured because Jesus received publicans and\ncommon sinners, and ate with them. In their self-righteousness\nthey despised these poor sinners who gladly heard the words of\nJesus. To rebuke this spirit in the scribes and Pharisees, and leave an\nimpressive lesson for all, the Lord gave the parable of the lost sheep.\nNotice in particular the following points:\nThe ninety and nine sheep are left, and diligent search is made\nfor the one that is lost. The entire effort is made for this unfortunate\nsheep. So should the effort of the church be directed in behalf of\nthose members who are straying from the fold of Christ. And have\nthey wandered far away, do not wait till they return before you try to\nhelp them, but go in search of them.\nWhen the lost sheep was found, it was borne home with joy, and[22]\nmuch rejoicing followed. This illustrates the blessed, joyful work\nof laboring for the erring. The church that engages successfully in\nthis work is a happy church. That man or that woman whose soul\nis drawn out in compassion and love for the erring, and who labors\nto bring them to the fold of the Great Shepherd, is engaged in a\nblessed work. And, oh, what a soul-enrapturing thought, that when\none sinner is thus reclaimed, there is more joy in heaven than over\nninety and nine just persons! Selfish, exclusive, exacting souls who\nseem to fear to help those in error, as though they would become\npolluted by so doing, do not taste of the sweets of this missionary\nwork; they do not feel that blessedness which fills all heaven with\nrejoicing upon the rescue of one who has gone astray. They are shut\nup to their narrow views and feelings, and are becoming as dry and\nunfruitful as the mountains of Gilboa, upon which there was neither\nSketch of Experience 23\ndew nor rain. Let a strong man be shut away from labor, and he\nbecomes feeble. That church or those persons who shut themselves\naway from bearing burdens for others, who shut themselves up to\nthemselves, will soon suffer spiritual feebleness. It is labor that\nkeeps the strong man strong. And spiritual labor, toil and burden\nbearing, is what will give strength to the church of Christ.\nSabbath and first day, April 18, 19, we enjoyed a good season\nwith our people at Greenville. Brethren A and B were with us. My\nhusband baptized eight. The 25th and 26th we were with the church\nin Wright. This dear people are ever ready to welcome us. Here my\nhusband baptized eight.\nMay 2 we met a large congregation at the house of worship\nat Monterey. My husband spoke with clearness and force upon\nthe parable of the lost sheep. The word was greatly blessed to the\npeople. Some who had strayed were out of the church, and there [23]\nwas no spirit of labor to help them. In fact, the stiff, stern, unfeeling\nposition of some in the church was calculated to prevent their return,\nshould they be disposed thus to do. The subject touched the hearts\nof all, and all manifested a desire to get right. On first day we spoke\nthree times in Allegan to good congregations. Our appointment\nwas out to meet with the church at Battle Creek the 9th, but we\nfelt that our work in Monterey was but just commenced, and we\ntherefore decided to return to Monterey and labor with that church\nanother week. The good work moved on, exceeding our expectations.\nThe house was filled, and we never before witnessed such a work in\nMonterey in so short a time. First day, fifty came forward for prayers.\nBrethren felt deeply for the lost sheep, and confessed their coldness\nand indifference, and took a good stand. Brethren G. T. Lay and\nS. Rummery gave good testimonies, and were joyfully received by\ntheir brethren. Fourteen were baptized, one of them a man near the\nmiddle age of life, who had felt opposed to the truth. The work\nmoved on with solemnity, confessions, and much weeping, carrying\nall before it. Thus closed the arduous labors of the Conference year.\nAnd still we felt that the good work in Monterey was by no means\nfinished. We have made arrangements to return and spend several\nweeks in Allegan County.\nThe Conference just past has been a season of deepest interest.\nThe labors of my husband have been very great during its numerous\n24 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nsessions, and he must have rest. Our labors for the past year are\nregarded favorably by our people, and there was manifested to us\nat the Conference, sympathy, tender care, and benevolence. With\nthem we have enjoyed great freedom, and we part, enjoying mutual\nconfidence and love.\nChapter 2\u2014Doing for Christ [24]\nFrom what has been shown me, Sabbathkeepers are growing\nmore selfish as they increase in riches. Their love for Christ and\nHis people is decreasing. They do not see the wants of the needy,\nnor feel their sufferings and sorrows. They do not realize that in\nneglecting the poor and the suffering they neglect Christ, and that\nin relieving the wants and sufferings of the poor as far as possible,\nthey minister to Jesus.\nChrist says to His redeemed people: \u201cCome, ye blessed of My\nFather, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation\nof the world: for I was an hungered, and ye gave Me meat; I was\nthirsty, and ye gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took Me in:\nnaked, and ye clothed Me: I was sick, and ye visited Me: I was in\nprison, and ye came unto Me.\n\u201cThen shall the righteous answer Him, saying, Lord, when saw\nwe Thee an hungered, and fed Thee? or thirsty, and gave Thee drink?\nWhen saw we Thee a stranger, and took Thee in? or naked, and\nclothed Thee? Or when saw we Thee sick, or in prison, and came\nunto Thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I\nsay unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of\nthese My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\u201d\nTo become a toiler, to continue patiently in well-doing which\ncalls for self-denying labor, is a glorious work, which Heaven smiles\nupon. Faithful work is more acceptable to God than the most zeal-\nous and thought-to-be holiest worship. It is working together with\nChrist that is true worship. Prayers, exhortation, and talk are cheap\nfruits, which are frequently tied on; but fruits that are manifested in\ngood works, in caring for the needy, the fatherless, and widows, are\ngenuine fruits, and grow naturally upon a good tree.\nPure religion and undefiled before the Father is this: \u201cTo visit [25]\nthe fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself\nunspotted from the world.\u201d Good deeds are the fruit that Christ\nrequires us to bear: kind words, deeds of benevolence, of tender\n25\n26 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nregard for the poor, the needy, the afflicted. When hearts sympathize\nwith hearts burdened with discouragement and grief, when the hand\ndispenses to the needy, when the naked are clothed, the stranger\nmade welcome to a seat in your parlor and a place in your heart,\nangels are coming very near, and an answering strain is responded\nto in heaven. Every act of justice, mercy, and benevolence makes\nmelody in heaven. The Father from His throne beholds those who\ndo these acts of mercy, and numbers them with His most precious\ntreasures. \u201cAnd they shall be Mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that\nday when I make up My jewels.\u201d Every merciful act to the needy,\nthe suffering, is regarded as though done to Jesus. When you succor\nthe poor, sympathize with the afflicted and oppressed, and befriend\nthe orphan, you bring yourselves into a closer relationship to Jesus.\n\u201cThen shall He say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from\nMe, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his\nangels: for I was an hungered, and ye gave Me no meat: I was thirsty,\nand ye gave Me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me not in:\nnaked, and ye clothed Me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited Me\nnot. Then shall they also answer Him, saying, Lord, when saw we\nThee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in\nprison, and did not minister unto Thee? Then shall He answer them,\nsaying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of\nthe least of these, ye did it not to Me. And these shall go away into\neverlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.\u201d Matthew\n25:41-46.\nJesus here identifies Himself with His suffering people. It was I[26]\nwho was hungry and thirsty. It was I who was a stranger. It was I who\nwas naked. It was I who was sick. It was I who was in prison. When\nyou were enjoying the food from your bountifully spread tables, I\nwas famishing in the hovel or street not far from you. When you\nclosed your doors against Me, while your well-furnished rooms were\nunoccupied, I had not where to lay My head. Your wardrobes were\nfilled with an abundant supply of changeable suits of apparel, upon\nwhich means had been needlessly squandered, which you might\nhave given to the needy. I was destitute of comfortable apparel.\nWhen you were enjoying health, I was sick. Misfortune cast Me into\nprison and bound Me with fetters, bowing down My spirit, depriving\nMe of freedom and hope, while you roamed free. What a oneness\nDoing for Christ 27\nJesus here expresses as existing between Himself and His suffering\ndisciples! He makes their case His own. He identifies Himself as\nbeing in person the very sufferer. Mark, selfish Christian: every\nneglect of the needy poor, the orphan, the fatherless, is a neglect of\nJesus in their person.\nI am acquainted with persons who make a high profession, whose\nhearts are so encased in self-love and selfishness that they cannot\nappreciate what I am writing. They have all their lives thought and\nlived only for self. To make a sacrifice to do others good, to dis-\nadvantage themselves to advantage others, is out of the question\nwith them. They have not the least idea that God requires this of\nthem. Self is their idol. Precious weeks, months, and years pass into\neternity, but they have no record in heaven of kindly acts, of sacri-\nficing for others\u2019 good, of feeding the hungry, clothing the naked,\nor taking in the stranger. This entertaining strangers at a venture is\nnot agreeable. If they knew that all who sought to share their bounty\nwere worthy, then they might be induced to do something in this\ndirection. But there is virtue in venturing something. Perchance we\nmay entertain angels.\nThere are orphans that should be cared for; but some will not [27]\nventure to undertake this, for it would bring them more work than\nthey care to do, leaving them but little time to please themselves.\nBut when the King shall make investigation, these do-nothing, il-\nliberal, selfish souls will learn that heaven is for those who have\nbeen workers, those who have denied themselves for Christ\u2019s sake.\nNo provisions have been made for those who have ever taken such\nspecial care in loving and looking out for themselves. The terrible\npunishment which the King threatens those on His left hand, in this\ncase, is not because of their great crimes. They are not condemned\nfor the things which they did do, but for that which they did not do.\nYou did not those things which Heaven assigned you to do. You\npleased yourself, and can take your portion with self-pleasers.\nTo my sisters I would say: Be daughters of benevolence. The\nSon of man came to seek and to save that which was lost. You may\nhave thought that if you could find a child without fault, you would\ntake it, and care for it; but to perplex your mind with an erring child,\nto unlearn it many things and teach it anew, to teach it self-control, is\na work which you refuse to undertake. To teach the ignorant, to pity\n28 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nand to reform those who have ever been learning evil, is no slight\ntask; but Heaven has placed just such ones in your way. They are\nblessings in disguise.\nYears ago I was shown that God\u2019s people would be tested upon\nthis point of making homes for the homeless; that there would be\nmany without homes in consequence of their believing the truth.\nOpposition and persecution would deprive believers of their homes,\nand it was the duty of those who had homes to open a wide door\nto those who had not. I have been shown more recently that God\nwould specially test His professed people in reference to this matter.\nChrist for our sakes became poor that we through His poverty might\nbe made rich. He made a sacrifice that He might provide a home[28]\nfor pilgrims and strangers in the world seeking for a better country,\neven an heavenly. Shall those who are subjects of His grace, who are\nexpecting to be heirs of immortality, refuse, or even feel reluctant, to\nshare their homes with the homeless and needy? Shall we, who are\ndisciples of Jesus, refuse strangers an entrance to our doors because\nthey can claim no acquaintance with the inmates?\nHas the injunction of the apostle no force in this age: \u201cBe not\nforgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained\nangels unawares\u201d? I am daily pained with exhibitions of selfishness\namong our people. There is an alarming absence of love and care\nfor those who are entitled to it. Our heavenly Father lays blessings\ndisguised in our pathway, but some will not touch these for fear they\nwill detract from their enjoyment. Angels are waiting to see if we\nembrace opportunities within our reach of doing good\u2014waiting to\nsee if we will bless others, that they in their turn may bless us. The\nLord Himself has made us to differ,\u2014some poor, some rich, some\nafflicted,\u2014that all may have an opportunity to develop character.\nThe poor are purposely permitted to be thus of God, that we may be\ntested and proved, and develop what is in our hearts.\nI have heard many excuse themselves from inviting to their\nhomes and hearts the saints of God. \u201cWhy, I have nothing prepared,\nI have nothing cooked; they must go to some other place.\u201d And at\nthat place there may be some other excuse invented for not receiving\nthose who need hospitality, and the feelings of the visitors are deeply\ngrieved, and they leave with unpleasant impressions in regard to the\nhospitality of these professed brethren and sisters. If you have no\nDoing for Christ 29\nbread, sister, imitate the case brought to view in the Bible. Go to\nyour neighbor and say: \u201cFriend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of\nmine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before [29]\nhim.\u201d We have not an example of this lack of bread ever being made\nan excuse to refuse entrance to an applicant. When Elijah came to\nthe widow of Sarepta, she shared her morsel with the prophet of\nGod, and he wrought a miracle, and caused that in that act of making\na home for his servant, and sharing her morsel with him, she herself\nwas sustained, and her life and that of her son preserved. Thus will\nit prove in the case of many, if they do this cheerfully, for the glory\nof God.\nSome plead their poor health\u2014they would love to do if they had\nstrength. Such have so long shut themselves up to themselves, and\nthought so much of their own poor feelings, and talked so much of\ntheir sufferings, trials, and afflictions, that it is their present truth.\nThey can think of no one but self, however much others may be\nin need of sympathy and assistance. You who are suffering with\npoor health, there is a remedy for you. If thou clothe the naked,\nand bring the poor that are cast out to thy house, and deal thy bread\nto the hungry, \u201cthen shall thy light break forth as the morning, and\nthine health shall spring forth speedily.\u201d Doing good is an excellent\nremedy for disease. Those who engage in the work are invited to\ncall upon God, and He has pledged Himself to answer them. Their\nsoul shall be satisfied in drought, and they shall be like a watered\ngarden, whose waters fail not.\nWake up, brethren and sisters. Do not be afraid of good works.\n\u201cLet us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap,\nif we faint not.\u201d Do not wait to be told your duty. Open your eyes\nand see who are around you; make yourselves acquainted with the\nhelpless, afflicted, and needy. Hide not yourselves from them, and\nseek not to shut out their needs. Who gives the proofs mentioned\nin James, of possessing pure religion, untainted with selfishness or\ncorruption? Who are anxious to do all in their power to aid in the\ngreat plan of salvation?\nI am acquainted with a widow who has two small children to sup- [30]\nport, wholly by the use of her needle. She looks pale and careworn.\nAll through the hard winter she has struggled to sustain herself and\nher children. She has received a little help, but who would feel any\n30 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nlack if a still greater interest were manifested in this case? Here are\nher two boys, aged about nine and eleven years, who need homes.\nWho are willing to give them homes for Christ\u2019s sake? The mother\nshould be released from this care and close confinement to her needle.\nThese boys are in a village, their only guardian their hard-working\nmother. They need to be taught how to work as their age will admit.\nThey need to be patiently, kindly, lovingly instructed. Some may\nsay: \u201cOh, yes, I would take them and teach them how to work.\u201d\nBut they should not lose sight of other things which these children\nneed besides being taught to work. They need to be instructed how\nthey shall develop good Christian character. They want love and\naffection, they need to be fitted to become useful here, and finally\nto be prepared for heaven. Disrobe yourselves of selfishness, and\nsee if there are not many whom you can help and bless with your\nhomes, your sympathy, your love, and in pointing them to the Lamb\nof God, who taketh away the sins of the world. Do you wish to make\nany sacrifice to save souls? Jesus, the dear Saviour, is preparing a\nhome for you; and why will not you in your turn prepare a home\nfor those who need it, and in thus doing imitate the example of your\nMaster? If you are not willing to do this, when you shall feel that\nyou need a habitation in the heavens, none will be awarded you. For\nChrist declares: \u201cInasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of\nthese, ye did it not to Me.\u201d You that have been selfish, studying your\nown ease and advantage all your life, your hours of probation are\nfast closing. What are you doing to redeem your life of selfishness\nand uselessness? Wake up! wake up!\nAs you regard your eternal interest, arouse yourselves, and begin[31]\nto sow good seed. That which you sow, you shall also reap. The\nharvest is coming\u2014the great reaping time, when we shall reap what\nwe have sown. There will be no failure in the crop; the harvest is\nsure. Now is the sowing time. Now make efforts to be rich in good\nworks, \u201cready to distribute, willing to communicate,\u201d laying up in\nstore for yourselves a good foundation against the time to come,\nthat ye \u201cmay lay hold on eternal life.\u201d I implore you, my brethren\nin every place, rid yourselves of your icy coldness. Encourage in\nyourselves a love of hospitality, a love to help those who need help.\nYou may say you have been taken in and have bestowed your\nmeans upon those unworthy of your charity, and therefore have\nDoing for Christ 31\nbecome discouraged in trying to help the needy. I present Jesus\nbefore you. He came to save fallen man, to bring salvation to\nHis own nation; but they would not accept Him. They treated His\nmercy with insult and contempt, and at length they put to death\nHim who came for the purpose of giving them life. Did our Lord\nturn from the fallen race because of this? Though your efforts for\ngood have been unsuccessful ninety-nine times, and you received\nonly insult, reproach, and hate, yet if the one-hundredth time proves\na success, and one soul is saved, oh, what a victory is achieved!\nOne soul wrenched from Satan\u2019s grasp, one soul benefited, one soul\nencouraged. This will a thousand times repay you for all your efforts.\nTo you will Jesus say: \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the\nleast of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\u201d Should we not\ngladly do all we can to imitate the life of our divine Lord? Many\nshrink at the idea of making any sacrifice for others\u2019 good. They\nare not willing to suffer for the sake of helping others. They flatter\nthemselves that it is not required of them to disadvantage themselves\nfor the benefit of others. To such we say: Jesus is our example.\nWhen the request was made for the two sons of Zebedee to sit [32]\nthe one on His right hand and the other on His left in His kingdom,\nJesus answered: \u201cYe know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of\nthe cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that\nI am baptized with? They say unto Him, We are able. And He saith\nunto them, Ye shall drink indeed of My cup, and be baptized with the\nbaptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on My right hand, and on\nMy left, is not Mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it\nis prepared of My Father.\u201d How many can answer: We can drink of\nthe cup; we can be baptized with the baptism; and make the answer\nunderstandingly? How many imitate the great Exemplar? All who\nhave professed to be followers of Christ have, in taking this step,\npledged themselves to walk even as He walked. Yet the course of\nmany who make high professions of the truth shows that they make\nbut little reference to the Pattern in conforming their lives thereto.\nThey shape their course to meet their own imperfect standard. They\ndo not imitate the self-denial of Christ or His life of sacrifice for\nothers\u2019 good.\nThe poor, the homeless, and the widows are among us. I heard a\nwealthy farmer describe the situation of a poor widow among them.\n32 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nHe lamented her straitened circumstances, and then said: \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow how she is going to get along this cold winter. She has close\ntimes now.\u201d Such have forgotten the pattern, and by their acts say:\n\u201cNay, Lord, we cannot drink of the cup of self-denial, humiliation,\nand sacrifice which You drank of, nor be baptized with the suffering\nwhich You were baptized with. We cannot live to do others good.\nIt is our business to take care of ourselves.\u201d Who should know how\nthe widow should get along unless it be those who have well-filled\ngranaries? The means for her to get along are at hand. And dare\nthose whom God has made His stewards, to whom He has entrusted[33]\nmeans, withhold from the needy disciples of Christ? If so, they\nwithhold from Jesus. Do you expect the Lord to rain down grain\nfrom heaven to supply the needy? Has He not rather placed it in\nyour hands, to help and bless them through you? Has He not made\nyou His instrument in this good work to prove you, and to give you\nthe privilege of laying up a treasure in heaven?\nFatherless and motherless children are thrown into the arms of\nthe church, and Christ says to His followers: Take these destitute\nchildren, bring them up for Me, and ye shall receive your wages. I\nhave seen much selfishness exhibited in these things. Unless there is\nsome special evidence that they themselves are to be benefited by\nadopting into their family those who need homes, some turn away\nand answer: No. They do not seem to know or care whether such\nare saved or lost. That, they think, is not their business. With Cain\nthey say: \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d They are not willing to be\nput to inconvenience or to make any sacrifice for the orphans, and\nthey indifferently thrust such ones into the arms of the world, who\nare sometimes more willing to receive them than are these professed\nChristians. In the day of God, inquiry will be made for those whom\nHeaven gave them the opportunity of saving. But they wished to be\nexcused, and would not engage in the good work unless they could\nmake it a matter of profit to them. I have been shown that those who\nrefuse these opportunities for doing good will hear from Jesus: \u201cAs\nye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me.\u201d Please\nread Isaiah 58:\n\u201cIs it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict\nhis soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread\nsackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an\nDoing for Christ 33\nacceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the fast that I have chosen?\nto loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to\nlet the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to [34]\ndeal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are\ncast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover\nhim; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? Then shall\nthy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring\nforth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory\nof the Lord shall be thy rearward. Then shalt thou call, and the Lord\nshall answer; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here I am. If thou take\naway from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger,\nand speaking vanity; and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry,\nand satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity,\nand thy darkness be as the noonday: and the Lord shall guide thee\ncontinually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones:\nand thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water,\nwhose waters fail not.\u201d\nThis is the special work now before us. All our praying and\nabstinence from food will avail nothing unless we resolutely lay\nhold of this work. Sacred obligations are resting upon us. Our duty\nis plainly stated. The Lord has spoken to us by His prophet. The\nthoughts of the Lord and His ways are not what blind, selfish mortals\nbelieve they are or wish them to be. The Lord looks on the heart.\nIf selfishness dwells there, He knows it. We may seek to conceal\nour true character from our brethren and sisters, but God knows.\nNothing can be hid from Him.\nThe fast which God can accept is described. It is to deal thy\nbread to the hungry and to bring the poor which are cast out to thy\nhouse. Wait not for them to come to you. The labor rests not on\nthem to hunt you up and entreat of you a home for themselves. You\nare to search for them and bring them to your house. You are to draw\nout your soul after them. You are with one hand to reach up and by\nfaith take hold of the mighty arm which brings salvation, while with\nthe other hand of love you reach the oppressed and relieve them. It [35]\nis impossible for you to fasten upon the arm of God with one hand\nwhile the other is employed in ministering to your own pleasure.\nIf you engage in this work of mercy and love, will the work prove\ntoo hard for you? Will you fail and be crushed under the burden, and\n34 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nyour family be deprived of your assistance and influence? Oh, no;\nGod has carefully removed all doubts upon this question, by a pledge\nto you on condition of your obedience. This promise covers all that\nthe most exacting, the most hesitating, could crave. \u201cThen shall thy\nlight break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth\nspeedily.\u201d Only believe that He is faithful that hath promised. God\ncan renew the physical strength. And more, He says He will do it.\nAnd the promise does not end here. \u201cThy righteousness shall go\nbefore thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward.\u201d God will\nbuild a fortification around thee. The promise does not stop even\nhere. \u201cThen shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry,\nand He shall say, Here I am.\u201d If ye put down oppression and remove\nthe speaking of vanity, if ye draw out your soul to the hungry, \u201cthen\nshall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday:\nand the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in\ndrought [famine], and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a\nwatered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.\u201d\nRead Isaiah 58, ye who claim to be children of the light. Espe-\ncially do you read it again and again who have felt so reluctant to\ninconvenience yourselves by favoring the needy. You whose hearts\nand houses are too narrow to make a home for the homeless, read it;\nyou who can see orphans and widows oppressed by the iron hand\nof poverty and bowed down by hardhearted worldlings, read it. Are\nyou afraid that an influence will be introduced into your family that\nwill cost you more labor, read it. Your fears may be groundless, and[36]\na blessing may come, known and realized by you every day. But\nif otherwise, if extra labor is called for, you can draw upon One\nwho has promised: \u201cThen shall thy light break forth as the morning,\nand thine health shall spring forth speedily.\u201d The reason why God\u2019s\npeople are not more spiritually minded and have not more faith, I\nhave been shown, is because they are narrowed up with selfishness.\nThe prophet is addressing Sabbathkeepers, not sinners, not unbe-\nlievers, but those who make great pretensions to godliness. It is\nnot the abundance of your meetings that God accepts. It is not the\nnumerous prayers, but the rightdoing, doing the right thing and at\nthe right time. It is to be less self-caring and more benevolent. Our\nsouls must expand. Then God will make them like a watered garden,\nwhose waters fail not.\nDoing for Christ 35\nRead Isaiah 1: \u201cAnd when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide\nMine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not\nhear: your hands are full of blood. Wash you, make you clean; put\naway the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes; cease to do\nevil; learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge\nthe fatherless, plead for the widow. Come now, and let us reason\ntogether, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall\nbe as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be\nas wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the\nland: but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword:\nfor the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\u201d\nThe gold mentioned by Christ, the True Witness, which all must\nhave, has been shown me to be faith and love combined, and love\ntakes the precedence of faith. Satan is constantly at work to remove\nthese precious gifts from the hearts of God\u2019s people. All are engaged\nin playing the game of life. Satan is well aware that if he can remove\nlove and faith, and supply their place with selfishness and unbelief, [37]\nall the remaining precious traits will soon be skillfully removed by\nhis deceitful hand, and the game will be lost.\nMy dear brethren, will you allow Satan to accomplish his pur-\npose? Will you submit to lose the game in which you desire to win\neverlasting life? If God has ever spoken by me, you will just as\nsurely be overcome by Satan, instead of being overcomers, as the\nthrone of God stands sure, unless you are entirely transformed. Love\nand faith must be won back. Will you engage in this conflict anew\nand win back the precious gifts of which you are nearly destitute?\nYou will have to make efforts more earnest, more persevering and\nuntiring, than you have ever yet made. It is not merely to pray or fast,\nbut it is to be obedient, to divest yourselves of selfishness, and keep\nthe fast which God has chosen, which He will accept. Many may\nfeel grieved because I have spoken plainly; but this I shall continue\nto do, if God lays the burden upon me.\nGod requires that those who occupy responsible positions should\nbe consecrated to the work; for if they move wrong, the people feel\nat liberty to follow in their footsteps. If the people are wrong, and\nthe leaders lift not their voice against the wrong, they sanction the\nsame, and the sin is charged upon them as well as the offenders.\n36 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nThose who occupy responsible positions should be men of piety,\nwho continually feel the burden of the work resting upon them.\n* * * * *\nChapter 3\u2014Selling the Birthright\nDear Brother D,\nI have been designing to write to you for some time, but our\nlabors have been so constant and wearing that I have had no time\nnor strength to do so. In my last vision your case was shown me.\nYou were in a critical condition. You knew the truth, you understood [38]\nyour duty, and you had rejoiced in the light of the truth; but because\nit interfered with your worldly pursuits, you were about to sacrifice\ntruth and duty to your own convenience. You were looking at your\nown present pecuniary advantage and losing sight of the eternal\nweight of glory. You were about to make an immense sacrifice for\nthe flattering prospect of present gain. You were just upon the point\nof selling your birthright for a mess of pottage. Had you turned from\nthe truth for earthly gain, it would not have been a sin of ignorance\non your part, but a willful transgression.\nEsau lusted for a favorite dish, and sacrificed his birthright to\ngratify appetite. After his lustful appetite had been gratified he saw\nhis folly, but found no space for repentance though he sought it\ncarefully and with tears. There are very many who are like Esau. He\nrepresents a class who have a special, valuable blessing within their\nreach,\u2014the immortal inheritance, life that is as enduring as the life\nof God, the Creator of the universe, happiness immeasurable, and\nan eternal weight of glory,\u2014but who have so long indulged their\nappetites, passions, and inclinations, that their power to discern and\nappreciate the value of eternal things is weakened.\nEsau had a special, strong desire for a particular article of food,\nand he had so long gratified self that he did not feel the necessity\nof turning from the tempting, coveted dish. He thought upon it,\nmaking no special effort to restrain his appetite, until the power of\nappetite bore down every other consideration and controlled him,\nand he imagined that he would suffer great inconvenience, and even\ndeath, if he could not have that particular dish. The more he thought\nupon it, the more his desire strengthened, until his birthright, which\n37\n38 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwas sacred, lost its value and its sacredness. He thought, If I now\nsell it, I can easily buy it back. He bartered it away for a favorite[39]\ndish, flattering himself that he could dispose of it at will and buy\nit back at pleasure. But when he sought to buy it back, even at\na great sacrifice on his part, he was not able to do so. He then\nbitterly repented his rashness, his folly, his madness. He looked\nthe matter over on every side. He sought for repentance carefully\nand with tears, but it was all in vain. He had despised the blessing,\nand the Lord removed it from him forever. You have thought that\nif you should sacrifice the truth now, and go on in a course of\nopen transgression and disobedience, you would not break over all\nrestraint and become reckless, and if you should be disappointed in\nyour hopes and expectations of worldly gain you could again interest\nyourself in the truth and become a candidate for everlasting life.\nBut you have deceived yourself in this matter. Had you sacrificed\nthe truth for worldly gain, it would have been at the expense of life\neverlasting.\nUnder the parable of a great supper, our Saviour shows that many\nwill choose the world above Himself, and will, as the result, lose\nheaven. The gracious invitation of our Saviour was slighted. He\nhad been to the trouble and expense to make great preparation at an\nimmense sacrifice. Then he sent his invitation; but \u201cthey all with\none consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have\nbought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray\nthee have me excused. And another said, I have bought five yoke\nof oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused. And\nanother said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.\u201d\nThe Lord then turns from the wealthy and world-loving, whose lands\nand oxen and wives were of so great value in their estimation as to\noutweigh the advantages they would gain by accepting the gracious\ninvitation he had given them to eat of his supper. The master of\nthe house is angry, and turns from those who have thus insulted his\nbounty offered them, and he invites a class who are not full, who[40]\nare not in possession of lands and houses, but who are poor and\nhungry, who are maimed and halt and blind, and who will appreciate\nthe bounties provided, and in return will render the master sincere\ngratitude, unfeigned love and devotion.\nSelling the Birthright 39\nStill there is room. The command is then given: \u201cGo out into the\nhighways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house\nmay be filled. For I say unto you, that none of those men which\nwere bidden shall taste of my supper.\u201d Here is a class rejected of\nGod because they despised the invitation of the Master. The Lord\ndeclared to Eli: \u201cThem that honor Me I will honor, and they that\ndespise Me shall be lightly esteemed.\u201d Says Christ: \u201cIf any man\nserve Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there shall also My\nservant be: if any man serve Me, him will My Father honor.\u201d God\nwill not be trifled with. If those who have the light reject it, or neglect\nto follow it out, it will become darkness to them.\nAn immense sacrifice was made on the part of God\u2019s dear Son,\nthat He might have power to rescue fallen man and exalt him to His\nown right hand, make him an heir of the world and a possessor of the\neternal weight of glory. Language fails to express the value of the\nimmortal inheritance. The glory, riches, and honor offered by the Son\nof God are of such infinite value that it is beyond the power of men\nor even angels to give any just idea of their worth, their excellence,\ntheir magnificence. If men, plunged in sin and degradation, refuse\nthese heavenly benefits, refuse a life of obedience, trample upon\nthe gracious invitations of mercy, and choose the paltry things of\nearth because they are seen, and it is convenient for their present\nenjoyment to pursue a course of sin, Jesus will carry out the figure\nin the parable; such shall not taste of His glory, but the invitation\nwill be extended to another class.\nThose who choose to make excuses and continue in sin and [41]\nconformity to the world will be left to their idols. There will be a\nday when they will not beg to be excused, when not one will wish\nto be excused. When Christ shall come in His glory and the glory of\nHis Father, with all the heavenly angels surrounding Him, escorting\nHim on His way with voices of triumph, while strains of the most\nenchanting music fall upon the ear, all will then be interested; there\nwill not be one indifferent spectator. Speculations will not then\nengross the soul. The miser\u2019s piles of gold, which have feasted his\neyes, are no more attractive. The palaces which the proud men of\nearth have erected, and which have been their idols, are turned from\nwith loathing and disgust. No one pleads his lands, his oxen, his\nwife that he has just married, as a reason why he should be excused\n40 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nfrom sharing the glory that bursts upon his astonished vision. All\nwant a share, but know that it is not for them.\nIn earnest, agonizing prayer they call for God to pass them not\nby. The kings, the mighty men, the lofty, the proud, the mean\nman, alike bow together under a pressure of woe, desolation, misery\ninexpressible; heart-anguished prayers are wrung from their lips.\nMercy! mercy! Save us from the wrath of an offended God! A\nvoice answers them with terrible distinctness, sternness, and majesty:\n\u201cBecause I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out My hand,\nand no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all My counsel, and\nwould none of My reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will\nmock when your fear cometh.\u201d\nThen kings and nobles, the mighty man, and the poor man, and\nthe mean man, alike, cry there most bitterly. They who in the days of\ntheir prosperity despised Christ and the humble ones who followed\nin His footsteps, men who would not humble their dignity to bow\nto Christ, who hated His despised cross, are now prostrate in the\nmire of the earth. Their greatness has all at once left them, and they[42]\ndo not hesitate to bow to the earth at the feet of the saints. They\nthen realize with terrible bitterness that they are eating the fruit\nof their own way, and are filled with their own devices. In their\nsupposed wisdom they turned away from the high, eternal reward,\nrejected the heavenly inducement, for earthly gain. The glitter and\ntinsel of earth fascinated them, and in their supposed wisdom they\nbecame fools. They exulted in their worldly prosperity as though\ntheir worldly advantages were so great that they could through them\nbe recommended to God, and thus secure heaven.\nMoney was power among the foolish of earth, and money was\ntheir god; but their very prosperity has destroyed them. They be-\ncame fools in the eyes of God and His heavenly angels, while men of\nworldly ambition thought them wise. Now their supposed wisdom\nis all foolishness, and their prosperity their destruction. Again ring\nforth shrieks of fearful, heart-rending anguish: \u201cRocks and moun-\ntains, fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the\nthrone, and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of His\nwrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?\u201d To the caves of the\nearth they flee as a covert, but these fail to be such then.\nSelling the Birthright 41\nDear brother, life or death is before you. Do you know why your\nsteps have faltered? why you did not persevere with courage and\nfirmness? You have a violated conscience. Your business career\nhas not been straightforward. You have something to do here. Your\nfather did not look upon business principles in the correct light. You\nregard them as do worldlings in general, but not as God regards\nthem. \u201cThou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d Have you done\nthis? \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and\nwith all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind.\u201d\nIf this commandment is obeyed, it prepares the heart to obey the [43]\nsecond, which is like unto it: \u201cLove thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d All the\nTen Commandments are embodied in the two specified. The first\nincludes the first four commandments, which show the duty of man\nto his Creator. The second embraces the last six, which show the\nduty of man to his fellow man. On these two commandments hang\nall the law and the prophets. They are two great arms sustaining all\nten of the commandments, the first four and the last six. These must\nbe strictly obeyed.\n\u201cIf thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.\u201d Very\nmany who profess to be Christ\u2019s disciples will apparently pass along\nsmoothly in this world, and will be regarded as upright, godly men,\nwhen they have a plague spot at the core, which taints their whole\ncharacter and corrupts their religious experience. \u201cThou shalt love\nthy neighbor as thyself.\u201d This forbids us to take advantage of our\nfellow men in order to advantage ourselves. We are forbidden to\nwrong our neighbor in anything. We should not view the matter\nfrom the worldling\u2019s standpoint. To deal with our fellow men in\nevery instance just as we should wish them to deal with us is a rule\nwhich we should apply to ourselves practically. God\u2019s laws are to be\nobeyed to the letter. In all our intercourse and deal with our fellow\nmen, whether believers or unbelievers, this rule is to be applied:\n\u201cLove thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d\nHere many who profess to be Christians will not bear the mea-\nsurement of God; when weighed in the balances of the sanctuary,\nthey will be found wanting. Dear brother, \u201ccome out from among\nthem, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean\nthing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye\nshall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\u201d What\n42 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\na promise is this! But we are not to lose sight of the fact that it is\nbased upon obedience to the command. God calls you to separate\nfrom the world. You are not to follow their practices, nor conform to[44]\nthem in your course of action in any respect. \u201cBut be ye transformed\nby the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good,\nand acceptable, and perfect, will of God.\u201d\nGod calls for separation from the world. Will you obey? Will\nyou come out from among them, and remain separate and distinct\nfrom them? \u201cFor what fellowship hath righteousness with unrigh-\nteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?\u201d You\ncannot mingle with worldlings, and partake of their spirit, and follow\ntheir example, and be at the same time a child of God. The Creator\nof the universe addresses you as an affectionate Father. If you sep-\narate from the world in your affections, and remain free from its\ncontamination, escaping the corruption that is in the world through\nlust, God will be your Father, He will adopt you into His family, and\nyou will be His heir. In place of the world, He will give you, for a\nlife of obedience, the kingdom under the whole heavens. He will\ngive you an eternal weight of glory and a life that is as enduring as\neternity.\nYour heavenly Father proposes to make you a member of the\nroyal family, that through His exceeding great and precious promises\nyou may be a partaker of the divine nature, having escaped the\ncorruption that is in the world through lust. The more you partake of\nthe character of the pure, sinless angels, and of Christ your Redeemer,\nthe more vividly will you bear the impress of the divine, and the\nmore faint will be the resemblance to the world. The world and\nChrist are at variance, because the world will not be in union with\nChrist. The world will also be at variance with Christ\u2019s followers. In\nthe prayer of our Saviour to His Father, He says: \u201cI have given them\nThy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of\nthe world, even as I am not of the world.\u201d\nYour calling is a high, an elevated one, to glorify God in your[45]\nbody and spirit, which are His. You are not to measure yourself by\nothers. The word of God has presented you an unerring pattern, a\nfaultless example. You have dreaded the cross. It is an inconvenient\ninstrument to lift, and because it is covered with reproach and shame,\nyou have shunned it. You need to carry out the health reform in\nSelling the Birthright 43\nyour life; to deny yourself, and eat and drink to the glory of God.\nAbstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul. You need to\npractice temperance in all things. Here is a cross which you have\nshunned. To confine yourself to a simple diet, which will preserve\nyou in the best condition of health, is a task to you. Had you lived up\nto the light which Heaven has permitted to shine upon your pathway,\nmuch suffering might have been saved your family. Your own course\nof action has brought the sure result. While you continue in this\ncourse, God will not come into your family and especially bless\nyou and work a miracle to save your family from suffering. A plain\ndiet, free from spices and flesh meats and grease of all kinds, would\nprove a blessing to you and would save your wife a great amount of\nsuffering, grief, and despondency.\nYou have not pursued a course which would assure to you the\nblessing of God. If you would have His blessing attend you, and His\npresence abide in your family, you must obey Him, doing His will\nirrespective of losses or gains or your own pleasure. You are not to\nconsult your desires, nor the approbation of worldlings who know\nnot God and seek not to glorify Him. If you walk contrary unto God,\nHe will walk contrary unto you. If you have other gods before the\nLord, your heart will be turned away from serving the only true and\nliving God, who requires the whole heart, the undivided affections.\nAll the heart, all the soul, all the mind, and all the strength, does\nGod require. He will accept of nothing short of this. No separation [46]\nis allowed here; no half-hearted work will be accepted.\nIn order to render to God perfect service, you must have clear\nconceptions of His requirements. You should use the most simple\nfood, prepared in the most simple manner, that the fine nerves of the\nbrain be not weakened, benumbed, or paralyzed, making it impossi-\nble for you to discern sacred things, and to value the atonement, the\ncleansing blood of Christ, as of priceless worth. \u201cKnow ye not that\nthey which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run,\nthat ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is\ntemperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown;\nbut we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so\nfight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body,\nand bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have\npreached to others, I myself should be a castaway.\u201d\n44 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nIf men, for no higher object than a wreath or perishable crown\nas a reward of their ambition, subjected themselves to temperance\nin all things, how much more should those be willing to practice\nself-denial who profess to be seeking, not only a crown of immortal\nglory, but a life which is to endure as long as the throne of Jehovah,\nand riches that are eternal, honors which are imperishable, an eternal\nweight of glory. Will not the inducements presented before those\nwho are running in the Christian race lead them to practice self-\ndenial and temperance in all things, that they may keep their animal\npropensities in subjection, keep under the body, and control the\nappetite and lustful passions? Then can they be partakers of the\ndivine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world\nthrough lust.\nIf the exceeding precious and glorious reward promised will not\nlead us to welcome greater privations and endure greater self-denial\nthan are cheerfully borne by worldly men who are seeking merely a[47]\nbauble of earth, a perishable laurel which brings honors from a few of\nthe worldly, and hate from more, we are unworthy of everlasting life.\nIn the earnestness and intensity of our zeal, perseverance, courage,\nenergy, self-denial, and sacrifice we should as much excel those who\nare engaged in any other enterprise as the object we are seeking to\nattain is of higher value than theirs. The treasure we are seeking\nis imperishable, eternal, immortal, all overglorious; while that of\nwhich the worldling is in pursuit, endures but a day; it is fading,\nperishable, fleeting as the morning cloud.\nThe cross, the cross; lift it, Brother D, and in the act of raising\nit you will be astonished to find that it raises you, it supports you.\nIn adversity, privation, and sorrow it will be a strength and a staff to\nyou. You will find it all hung with mercy, compassion, sympathy,\nand inexpressible love. It will prove to you a pledge of immortality.\nMay you be able to say with Paul: \u201cGod forbid that I should glory,\nsave in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is\ncrucified unto me, and I unto the world.\u201d\nThe Spirit of the Lord has been striving with your wife for some\ntime. If you would yield all to God, she would have strength to\ntake her position to seek to live out the truth. If you choose to turn\nfrom the truth, you will not go down alone; you will not only lose\nyour own soul, but will be the means of turning others out of the\nSelling the Birthright 45\nway, and the blood of souls will be on your garments. Had you\nmaintained your integrity, your mother, your brother E, and one who\nnow hovers over the brink of the grave, might now be enjoying the\nconsolation of the Spirit of God and have a good experience in the\ntruth. Ever bear in mind that we are accountable for the influence\nwe exert. Our influence gathers with Christ or scatters abroad. We\nare either helping souls in the narrow path of holiness or we are a\nhindrance, a stumbling block to them, turning them out of the way. [48]\nYou, my much-esteemed brother, have no time to lose. Be in earnest\nto redeem the time, because the days are evil. Your associates, those\nwhose company you have chosen, have been a hindrance to you.\nCome out from among them, and be separate. Draw near to God,\nand come into closer union with His people. Let your interest and\nyour affections center in Christ and His followers. Love those best\nwho love Christ most. Sever the links which have bound you to\nthose who love not God and the truth. What communion hath light\nwith darkness? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?\nYou are in imminent danger of making shipwreck of faith. You\nneed all the strength which you can obtain from the people of God,\nthose who possess hope, courage, and faith. But do not neglect\nprayer, secret prayer. Be instant in prayer; encourage a spirit of true\ndevotion. In your business career you have a work to do. Just what, I\nam unable to tell you; but something is wrong. Search carefully. We\nare doing up work for eternity. All our acts, all our words, are to be\nweighed in the balances of the sanctuary. A just and impartial God\nis to determine all our cases, every event of our life history. \u201cHe that\nis faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that\nis unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\u201d\nLet nothing obstruct your progress in the way to everlasting life.\nYour eternal interest is at stake. There must be a thorough work\nwrought in you. You must be fully converted, or you will fail of\nheaven. But Jesus invites you to make Him your strength, your\nsupport. He will be to you a present help in every time of need. He\nwill be to you as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. Let it\nnot be your great anxiety to succeed in this world, but let the burden\nof your soul be: How shall I secure the better world? what have I to\ndo to be saved? In saving your own soul, you save others. In lifting [49]\nyourself, you lift others. In fastening your grasp upon the truth and\n46 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nupon the throne of God, you aid others to fix their trembling faith\nupon His promises and His eternal throne. The position you must\ncome into is to value salvation dearer than earthly gain, to count\neverything but loss that you may win Christ. The consecration on\nyour part must be entire. God will admit of no reserve, of no divided\nsacrifice; you can cherish no idol. You must die to self and to the\nworld. Renew your consecration to God daily. Everlasting life is\nworth a lifelong, persevering, untiring effort.\nI was shown that your brother had been convinced of the truth for\nsome time, but influences had held him back. His wife had hindered\nhim from obeying his convictions. But in her affliction she sought\nthe Lord, and He was found of her. Then she felt an anxiety that\nher husband should embrace the truth; she repented that she had\nopposed him, that her pride and love of the world had so long kept\nhim from receiving the truth. Like a weary child in search of rest\nbut unable to obtain it, she at length complied with the gracious\ninvitation: \u201cCome unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden,\nand I will give you rest.\u201d Her weary, burdened soul sought her Lord,\nand with repentance, humiliation, and earnest prayer she cast her\nburden upon the great Burden Bearer, and in Him found rest; she\nreceived the evidence that her humiliation and earnest repentance\nwere accepted of God, and that for Christ\u2019s sake He had forgiven\nher sins.\nI was shown, Brother D, that you have but a short time to work.\nDo up your work thoroughly, redeem the time. In your business\ntransactions let not a blot tarnish your Christian character. Keep your\ngarments unspotted from the world. Watch and pray, lest you enter\ninto temptation. Temptations may be all around you, but you are not\ncompelled to enter into them. You may obtain strength from Christ[50]\nto stand unsullied amid the pollutions of this corrupt age. \u201cWhereby\nare given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by\nthese ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the\ncorruption that is in the world through lust.\u201d Keep the eye steadily\nfixed upon Christ, upon the divine image. Imitate His spotless life,\nand you will be a partaker of His glory, and with Him inherit the\nkingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\n* * * * *\nChapter 4\u2014Evilspeaking\nBrother F has had the cause of God at heart, but he has felt too\ndeeply, and has taken on many burdens which he should not have\nborne. He has suffered in health in this way. He has sometimes\nviewed matters in a strong light, and has been too earnest and anxious\nto have all see them just as he did; and because they were backward\nin doing so, he has felt nearly crushed. He feels to the depths, and is\nin danger of urging his views of things too strongly.\nSister F wants to be a Christian, but she has not cultivated discre-\ntion and true courtesy. She is of a very sanguine turn of mind, ardent\nand self-confident. She shows the rough part of her character, and\nhas not appeared to advantage. She has moved from impulse, acting\njust as she felt, and sometimes her feelings have been much excited\nand strong. She has strong likes and dislikes, and has permitted\nthis unfortunate trait in her character to develop itself, greatly to the\ndetriment of her own spiritual advancement and to the injury of the\nchurch. She has talked too much and unwisely, just as she felt. This\nhas had a strong influence upon her husband, and has at times led\nhim to move from excitement of feeling, when if he had waited and [51]\nlooked at matters calmly and weighed them properly, it would have\nbeen better for himself and for the church. Nothing is gained by\nmoving hurriedly, moving from impulse, or from strong feeling.\nSister F moves from impulse, and finds fault, and has had too\nmuch to say against her brethren and sisters. This will cause con-\nfusion in any church. If she could control her own spirit, a great\nvictory would be gained. If she would seek the heavenly adorning,\neven the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which God, the Creator\nof the heavens and the earth, calls of great price, she would then be a\nreal help to the church. If she would cherish the spirit of Christ, and\nbecome a peacemaker, her own soul would flourish, and she would\nbe a blessing to the church wherever she might be located. Unless\nshe is converted and an entire change is wrought in her, unless she\neducates herself to be slow to speak and slow to wrath, and cultivates\n47\n48 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ntrue Christian courtesy, her influence will prove injurious, and the\nhappiness of others connected with her will suffer. She manifests\nan independence which is a damage to her and alienates her friends.\nThis independence has caused her much trouble and has wounded\nher best friends.\nIf those who had means were close in their deal with her husband,\nand did not favor him more than worldlings in business transactions,\nshe has felt and talked, and aroused feelings of dissatisfaction where\nnone previously existed. This is a selfish world at best. Many of\nthose who profess the truth are not sanctified by it, and may not\nhave a heart to make even a trifling variation in the prices of produce\nwhen dealing with a poor brother, sooner than they would with an\nable worldling. They do not love their neighbors as themselves. It\nwould be more pleasing to God were there less selfishness and more\ndisinterested benevolence.\nAs Sister F has seen a selfish spirit manifest in deal, she has\ncommitted a greater sin by feeling and talking in regard to the matter[52]\nas she has. She has erred in expecting too much. The tongue has\nbeen truly an unruly member, a world of iniquity, set on fire of\nhell, untamed and untamable. Sister F has had a spirit of retaliation,\nmanifesting by her deportment that she was offended. This was all\nwrong. She has cherished bitter feelings, which are foreign to the\nspirit of Christ. Anger, resentment, and all kinds of unkind tempers\nare indulged by speaking against those with whom we are displeased,\nand by reciting the errors and failings and sins of neighbors. The\nlustful desires are gratified.\nSister F, if you are grieved because your neighbors or friends\nare doing wrong to their own hurt, if they are overtaken in fault,\nfollow the Bible rule. \u201cTell him his fault between thee and him\nalone.\u201d As you go to the one you suppose to be in error, see that you\nspeak in a meek and lowly spirit; for the wrath of man worketh not\nthe righteousness of God. The erring can be restored in no other\nway than in the spirit of meekness, gentleness, and tender love. Be\ncareful in your manner. Avoid anything in look or gesture, word or\ntone, that savors of pride or self-sufficiency. Guard yourself against\na word or look that would exalt yourself, or place your goodness\nand righteousness in contrast with their failings. Beware of the most\ndistant approach to disdain, overbearing, or contempt. With care\nEvilspeaking 49\navoid every appearance of anger; and though you use plainness of\nspeech, let there be no reproach, no railing accusation, no token of\nwarmth but that of earnest love. Above all, let there be no shadow\nof hate or ill will, no bitterness or sourness of expression. Nothing\nbut kindness and gentleness can flow from a heart of love. Yet all\nthese precious fruits need not hinder you from speaking in the most\nserious, solemn manner, as though angels were directing their eyes\nupon you, and you were acting in reference to the coming judgment. [53]\nBear in mind that the success of reproof depends greatly upon the\nspirit in which it is given. Do not neglect earnest prayer that you\nmay possess a lowly mind, and that angels of God may go before\nyou to work upon the hearts you are trying to reach, and so soften\nthem by heavenly impressions that your efforts may avail. If any\ngood is accomplished, take no credit to yourself. God alone should\nbe exalted. God alone has done it all.\nYou have excused yourself for speaking evil of your brother or\nsister or neighbor to others before going to him and taking the steps\nwhich God has absolutely commanded. You say: \u201cWhy, I did not\nspeak to anyone until I was so burdened that I could not refrain.\u201d\nWhat burdened you? Was it not a plain neglect of your own duty, of\na thus saith the Lord? You were under the guilt of sin because you\ndid not go and tell the offender his fault between you and him alone.\nIf you did not do this, if you disobeyed God, how could you be\notherwise than burdened unless your heart was hardened while you\nwere trampling the command of God underfoot, and in your heart\nhating your brother or neighbor? And what way have you found to\nunburden yourself? God reproves you for a sin of omission in not\ntelling your brother his fault, and you excuse and comfort yourself\nby a sin of commission by telling your brother\u2019s faults to another\nperson! Is this the right way to purchase ease\u2014by committing sin?\nAll your efforts to save the erring may be unavailing. They may\nrepay you evil for good. They may be enraged rather than convinced.\nWhat if they hear to no good purpose, and pursue the evil course they\nhave begun? This will frequently occur. Sometimes the mildest and\ntenderest reproof will have no good effect. In that case the blessing\nyou wanted another to receive by pursuing a course of righteousness,\nceasing to do evil and learning to do well, will return into your own\nbosom. If the erring persist in sin, treat them kindly, and leave them [54]\n50 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwith your heavenly Father. You have delivered your soul; their sin\nno longer rests upon you; you are not now partaker of their sin. But\nif they perish, their blood is upon their own head.\nDear friend, an entire transformation must take place in you,\nor you will be weighed in the balance and found wanting. The\nchurch at -----, especially talking women, have a lesson to learn. \u201cIf\nany man [or woman] among you seem to be religious, and bridleth\nnot his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man\u2019s religion is\nvain.\u201d Many will be weighed in the balance and found wanting in\nthis matter of so great importance. Where are the Christians who\nwalk by this rule? who will take God\u2019s part against the evilspeaker?\nwho will please God, and set a watch, a continual watch, before the\nmouth, and keep the door of the lips? Speak evil of no man. Hear\nevil of no man. If there be no hearers, there will be no speakers of\nevil. If anyone speaks evil in your presence, check him. Refuse to\nhear him, though his manner be ever so soft and his accents mild.\nHe may profess attachment, and yet throw out covert hints and stab\nthe character in the dark.\nResolutely refuse to hear, though the whisperer complains of\nbeing burdened till he speak. Burdened indeed! with a cursed\nsecret which separateth very friends. Go, burdened ones, and free\nyourselves from your burden in God\u2019s appointed way. First go tell\nyour brother his fault between you and him alone. If this fail, next\ntake with you one or two friends, and tell him in their presence. If\nthese steps fail, then tell it to the church. Not an unbeliever is to be\nmade acquainted with the slightest particular of the matter. Telling it\nto the church is the last step to be taken. Publish it not to the enemies\nof our faith. They have no right to the knowledge of church matters,\nlest the weakness and errors of Christ\u2019s followers be exposed.\nThose who are preparing for the coming of Christ should be[55]\nsober and watch unto prayer, for our adversary, the devil, goeth\nabout like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour; whom we\nare to resist steadfast in the faith. \u201cHe that will love life, and see\ngood days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that\nthey speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek\npeace, and ensue it. For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous,\nand His ears are open unto their prayers.\u201d\nEvilspeaking 51\n* * * * *\nChapter 5\u2014Selfishness and World Loving\nDear Brother and Sister G,\nI have for some time designed to write to you. As the light\nwhich the Lord has given me came distinctly before me, some things\npressed themselves forcibly upon my mind while standing before the\npeople at -----. I had hoped that you would stay to another meeting,\nand that the labor there commenced could have been continued. But\nI am sorry to see that when our brethren attend a Conference, they do\nnot generally feel the importance of first preparing for the meeting.\nInstead of consecrating themselves to God before they come, they\nwait till they get to the meeting to have the work done for them\nthere. They bring home along with them, and the things that they\nhave left behind are considered of more value and importance than a\npreparation of heart for His coming. Therefore nearly all leave no\nbetter than when they came. Such meetings are attended with great\nexpense, and if those who come are not profited, there is a loss to\nthem, and they make the labor exceedingly hard for those who feel\nthe burden of the work upon them. Our people left that Conference\ntoo soon. We might have seen a more special work from God had\nall remained and engaged in the work.\nSister G, I have a message to you. You are far from the king-[56]\ndom. You love this world, and this love has made you cold, selfish,\nexacting, and penurious. The great object of interest with you is the\npowerful, mighty dollar. How little you know how God looks upon\none in your condition. You are in a terrible deception. You are con-\nformed to the world instead of being transformed by the renewing of\nyour mind. Selfishness and self-love are exemplified in your life to\na great degree. You have not overcome this unhappy defect in your\ncharacter. If this is not remedied, you will lose heaven, and your\nhappiness here will be greatly marred. This has been the case al-\nready. The dark cloud which has followed you, overshadowing your\nlife, will grow larger and blacker until your whole sky is clouded.\n52\nSelfishness and World Loving 53\nYou may turn to the right, and there will be no light, and to the left,\nand you cannot discover a ray.\nYou make trouble for yourself where there is no trouble, because\nyou are not right. You are unconsecrated. Your complaining, penuri-\nous spirit makes you unhappy and displeases God. During your life\nyou have been looking out for yourself, seeking to make yourself\nhappy. It is poor work, unprofitable business. The more you invest\nhere the heavier will be the loss. The less stock you take in this\nbusiness of serving yourself the greater will be the saving on your\npart. You are a stranger to disinterested, unselfish love, and while\nyou see no special sin in the absence of this precious trait you will\nnot be diligent to cultivate it.\nYou loved your husband and married him. You knew that when\nyou married him you covenanted to become a mother to his children.\nBut I saw a lack in you in this matter. You are sadly deficient. You\ndo not love the children of your husband, and unless there is an\nentire change, a thorough reformation in you, and in your manner of\ngovernment, these precious jewels are ruined. Love, manifestation\nof affection, is not a part of your discipline. Shall I tell you the truth [57]\nand become your enemy by so doing? You are too thoroughly selfish\nto love the children of another. I was shown that the fruit of your\nunion would not be prospered and blessed with strength, life, and\nhealth, and God\u2019s spirit would leave you to yourself, unless you are\nthoroughly proved and tested, and right up those things in which you\nare so deficient. As your selfishness withers and blights the young\nhearts around you, so will the curse of God wither and blight the\npledges of your selfish love and union. And if you continue your\nselfish course, God will come still closer to you and remove your\nidols one after another from before your face until you shall humble\nyour proud, selfish, unsubdued heart before Him.\nI saw that you would have a fearful account to render in the day\nof God because of your unfulfilled trust. You are making the lives of\nthose dear children very bitter, especially the daughter\u2019s. Where is\nthe affection, the loving caress, the patient forbearance? Hatred lives\nin your unsanctified heart more than love. Censure leaps from your\nlips more than praise and encouragement. Your manners, your harsh\nways, your unsympathizing nature, are to that sensitive daughter like\n54 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ndesolating hail upon a tender plant; it bends to every blast until its\nlife is crushed out, and it lies bruised and broken.\nYour administration is drying up the channel of love, hopefulness,\nand joy in your children. A settled sadness is expressed in the\ncountenance of the girl, but, instead of awakening sympathy and\ntenderness in you, this arouses impatience and positive dislike. You\ncan change this expression to animation and cheerfulness if you\nchoose. \u201cDoes not God see? Does He take no knowledge?\u201d were the\nwords of the angel. He will visit for these things. You voluntarily\ntook upon you this responsibility, but Satan has taken advantage\nof your unhappy, unlovable, and unloving disposition, your self-\nlove, your closeness, your selfishness, and it now appears in all its[58]\ndeformity, uncorrected, unsubdued, girding you about as with iron\nbands. Children read the countenance of the mother; they understand\nwhether love or dislike is there expressed. You know not the work\nyou are doing. Does not the little sad face, the heaving sigh welling\nup from a pressed heart in its yearning call for love, awaken pity?\nNo, not in you. It places the child at a still greater distance from you\nand increases your dislike.\nI saw that the father had not taken the course that a father should.\nGod is not pleased with his position. Another has stolen the father\u2019s\nheart from the blood of his blood and bone of his bone. Brother\nG, you have been very deficient in discernment. As the head of\nthe house, you should have taken your position and not permitted\nthings to go as they have gone. You have seen that things were not\nright and have sometimes felt anxious, but fear of displeasing your\npresent wife and making unhappy discord in your family has led you\nto remain silent when you should have spoken. You are not clear\nin the matter. Your children have no mother to plead for them, to\nshelter them from censure by her judicious words.\nYour children, and all other children who have lost the one in\nwhose breasts maternal love has flowed, have met with a loss that\ncan never be supplied. But when one ventures to stand in the place\nof mother to the little stricken flock, a double care and burden rests\nupon her, to be even more loving if possible, more forbearing of\ncensure and threatening than their own mother could have been, and\nin this way supply the loss which the little flock have sustained. You,\nBrother G, have been like a man asleep. Take your children to your\nSelfishness and World Loving 55\nheart, encircle them with your sheltering arms, love them tenderly.\nIf you fail to do this, \u201cFound wanting\u201d will be written against you.\nThere is a work for you both to do. Forever cease your murmur- [59]\nings. Brother G, suffer not the close, penurious, selfish spirit of your\nwife to control your actions. You have been drinking in the same\nspirit, and you have both robbed God. The plea of poverty is upon\nyou lips, but Heaven knows it is false; yet your words will be all\ntrue; you will be poor indeed, if you continue to cherish the love\nof the world as you have done. \u201cWill a man rob God? Yet ye have\nrobbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed Thee? In tithes\nand offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse.\u201d Wipe off this curse as\nfast as possible.\nBrother G, as God\u2019s steward, look to Him. It is He to whom\nyou are to give account of your stewardship, not to your wife. It is\nGod\u2019s means that you are handling. He has only lent it you a little\nwhile to prove you, to try you, to see if you will be \u201crich in good\nworks, ready to distribute, willing to communicate,\u201d laying up in\nstore for yourselves a good foundation against the time to come,\nthat ye may lay hold on eternal life. God will require His own with\nusury. May He help you to prepare for the judgment. Let self be\ncrucified. Let the precious graces of the Spirit live in your hearts.\nTurn out the world with its corrupting lust. \u201cLove not the world,\nneither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world,\nthe love of the Father is not in him.\u201d If your profession is as high as\nheaven, and yet you are selfish and world-loving, you can have no\npart in the kingdom with the sanctified, the pure and holy. \u201cWhere\nyour treasure is, there will your heart be also.\u201d If your treasure is in\nheaven, your heart will be there. You will talk of heaven, eternal life,\nthe immortal crown. If you lay up your treasure on earth, you will\nbe talking of earthly things, worrying about losses and gains. \u201cWhat\nshall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his\nown soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d\nThere is light and salvation for you if you will only feel that you [60]\nmust have it or perish. Jesus can save to the uttermost. But, Sister\nG, if God has ever spoken by me, you are terribly deceived in regard\nto yourself, and must have a thorough conversion, or you will never\nbe one of that number who have come up through great tribulation,\n56 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nhaving washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the\nLamb.\n* * * * *\nChapter 6\u2014Flesh Meats and Stimulants\nDear Brother and Sister H,\nI recollected your countenances as being among several that I\nhad seen who need a work accomplished for them before they can\nbe sanctified through the truth. You embraced the truth because you\nsaw it to be truth, but it has not yet taken hold of you. You have not\nrealized its sanctifying influence upon the life. The light has been\nshining upon your pathway in regard to health reform and the duty\nresting upon God\u2019s people in these last days to exercise temperance\nin all things. You, I saw, were among the number who would be\nbackward to see the light and correct your manner of eating, drinking,\nand working. As the light of truth is received and followed out, it\nwill work an entire reformation in the life and character of all those\nwho are sanctified through it.\nYour business is of a character that is not friendly to an advance\nin the divine life, but is one that will hinder the growth of grace and\nthe knowledge of the truth. It has a tendency to lower, to debase\nthe man, to make him more animal in his propensities. The higher\npowers of the mind are overpowered by the lower. The brutish part\nof your nature governs the spiritual. Those who profess to be fitting\nfor translation should not become butchers.\nYour family have partaken largely of flesh meats, and the animal\npropensities have been strengthened, while the intellectual have been [61]\nweakened. We are composed of what we eat, and if we subsist largely\nupon the flesh of dead animals we shall partake of their nature. You\nhave encouraged the grosser part of your organism, while the more\nrefined has been weakened. You have repeatedly said in defense\nof your indulgence of meat eating: \u201cHowever injurious it may be\nto others, it does not injure me, for I have used it all my life.\u201d But\nyou know not how well you might have been if you had abstained\nfrom the use of flesh meats. As a family, you are far from being\nfree from disease. You have used the fat of animals, which God in\nHis word expressly forbids: \u201cIt shall be a perpetual statute for your\n57\n58 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ngenerations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor\nblood.\u201d \u201cMoreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be\nof fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. Whatsoever soul it be\nthat eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from\nhis people.\u201d\nYou have flesh, but it is not good material. You are worse off\nfor this amount of flesh. If you should each come down to a more\nspare diet, which would take from you twenty-five or thirty pounds\nof your gross flesh, you would be much less liable to disease. The\neating of flesh meats has made a poor quality of blood and flesh.\nYour systems are in a state of inflammation, prepared to take on\ndisease. You are liable to acute attacks of disease and to sudden\ndeath because you do not possess the strength of constitution to rally\nand resist disease. There will come a time when the strength and\nhealth you have flattered yourself you possessed will prove to be\nweakness. It is not the chief end of man to glorify his stomach. You\nhave animal wants to be supplied; but because of this necessity shall\nman become all animal?\nYou have set for your children a table of unwholesome food,\ncooked in an unhealthful manner. You have placed flesh meats\nbefore them, and what is the result? Are they refined, intellectual,\nobedient, conscientious, and religiously inclined? You know this is[62]\nnot the case, but entirely the contrary. Your manner of living has\nstrengthened the animal of your nature and weakened the spiritual.\nYou have transmitted to your children a miserable legacy, a depraved\nnature rendered still more depraved by your gross habits of eating\nand drinking. Your table has completed the work of making them\nwhat they are. The sin lies at your door. You know that they are not\nreligiously inclined, that they will not submit to restraint, but are\ninclined to disobedience and to disrespect your authority. Your eldest\nson especially is corrupt, partaking to a great degree of the animal.\nScarcely a trace of the divine can be seen in his organism. You\nhave brought up your children to indulge their appetite when they\nplease and as they please. Your example has taught them that they\nlive to eat, that the gratification of appetite is about all that is worth\nliving for. There is a work for you to do, Brother H. You have been\nlike a man asleep or paralyzed. It is time that you make a mighty\neffort to save the younger members of your family. The influence\nFlesh Meats and Stimulants 59\nof your eldest son is only evil over them. Correct your table. A\ndepraved, stimulating diet is strengthening the animal passions of\nyour children. Of all the families I am acquainted with, yours most\nneeds to dispense with flesh meats and grease, and learn to cook\nhygienically.\nSister H is a woman whose blood is corrupt. Her system is full\nof scrofulous humors from the eating of flesh meats. The use of\nswine\u2019s flesh in your family has imparted a bad quality of blood.\nSister H needs to confine herself strictly to a diet of grains, fruits,\nand vegetables, cooked without flesh or grease of any kind. It will\ntake quite a length of time of strictly healthful diet to place you in\nbetter conditions of health, where you will be rightly related to life.\nIt is impossible for those who make free use of flesh meats to have\nan unclouded brain and an active intellect.\nWe advise you to change your habits of living; but while you [63]\ndo this we caution you to move understandingly. I am acquainted\nwith families who have changed from a meat diet to one that is\nimpoverished. Their food is so poorly prepared that the stomach\nloathes it; and such have told me that the health reform did not agree\nwith them, that they were decreasing in physical strength. Here\nis one reason why some have not been successful in their efforts\nto simplify their food. They have a poverty-stricken diet. Food is\nprepared without painstaking, and there is a continual sameness.\nThere should not be many kinds at any one meal, but all meals\nshould not be composed of the same kinds of food without variation.\nFood should be prepared with simplicity, yet with a nicety which\nwill invite the appetite. You should keep grease out of your food. It\ndefiles any preparation of food you may make. Eat largely of fruits\nand vegetables.\nAfter they have reduced their physical strength by a reduced\nquantity and a poor quality of food, some conclude that their former\nway of living is the best. The system must be nourished. Yet we\ndo not hesitate to say that flesh meat is not necessary for health or\nstrength. If used it is because a depraved appetite craves it. Its use\nexcites the animal propensities to increased activity and strengthens\nthe animal passions. When the animal propensities are increased,\nthe intellectual and moral powers are decreased. The use of the flesh\n60 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nof animals tends to cause a grossness of body and benumbs the fine\nsensibilities of the mind.\nWill the people who are preparing to become holy, pure, and\nrefined, that they may be introduced into the society of heavenly\nangels, continue to take the life of God\u2019s creatures and subsist on\ntheir flesh and enjoy it as a luxury? From what the Lord has shown\nme, this order of things will be changed, and God\u2019s peculiar people\nwill exercise temperance in all things. Those who subsist largely\nupon flesh cannot avoid eating the meat of animals which are to a[64]\ngreater or less degree diseased. The process of fitting animals for\nmarket produces in them disease; and fitted in as healthful manner\nas they can be, they become heated and diseased by driving before\nthey reach the market. The fluids and flesh of these diseased animals\nare received directly into the blood, and pass into the circulation\nof the human body, becoming fluids and flesh of the same. Thus\nhumors are introduced into the system. And if the person already\nhas impure blood, it is greatly aggravated by the eating of the flesh\nof these animals. The liability to take disease is increased tenfold by\nmeat eating. The intellectual, the moral, and the physical powers are\ndepreciated by the habitual use of flesh meats. Meat eating deranges\nthe system, beclouds the intellect, and blunts the moral sensibilities.\nWe say to you, dear brother and sister, your safest course is to let\nmeat alone.\nThe use of tea and coffee is also injurious to the system. To a\ncertain extent, tea produces intoxication. It enters into the circulation\nand gradually impairs the energy of body and mind. It stimulates,\nexcites, and quickens the motion of the living machinery, forcing\nit to unnatural action, and thus gives the tea drinker the impression\nthat it is doing him great service, imparting to him strength. This is a\nmistake. Tea draws upon the strength of the nerves and leaves them\ngreatly weakened. When its influence is gone and the increased\naction caused by its use is abated, then what is the result? Languor\nand debility corresponding to the artificial vivacity the tea imparted.\nWhen the system is already overtaxed and needs rest, the use of\ntea spurs up nature by stimulation to perform unwonted, unnatural\naction, and thereby lessens her power to perform and her ability\nto endure; and her powers give out long before Heaven designed\nthey should. Tea is poisonous to the system. Christians should let\nFlesh Meats and Stimulants 61\nit alone. The influence of coffee is in a degree the same as tea, but [65]\nthe effect upon the system is still worse. Its influence is exciting,\nand just in the degree that it elevates above par it will exhaust and\nbring prostration below par. Tea and coffee drinkers carry the marks\nupon their faces. The skin becomes sallow and assumes a lifeless\nappearance. The glow of health is not seen upon the countenance.\nTea and coffee do not nourish the system. The relief obtained\nfrom them is sudden, before the stomach has time to digest them.\nThis shows that what the users of these stimulants call strength is\nonly received by exciting the nerves of the stomach, which con-\nvey the irritation to the brain, and this in turn is aroused to impart\nincreased action to the heart and short-lived energy to the entire\nsystem. All this is false strength that we are the worse for having.\nThey do not give a particle of natural strength.\nThe second effect of tea drinking is headache, wakefulness,\npalpitation of the heart, indigestion, trembling of the nerves, with\nmany other evils. \u201cI beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies\nof God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable\nunto God, which is your reasonable service.\u201d God calls for a living\nsacrifice, not a dead or dying one. When we realize the requirements\nof God, we shall see that He requires us to be temperate in all things.\nThe end of our creation is to glorify God in our bodies and spirits,\nwhich are His. How can we do this when we indulge the appetite to\nthe injury of the physical and moral powers? God requires that we\npresent our bodies a living sacrifice. Then the duty is enjoined on us\nto preserve that body in the very best condition of health, that we\nmay comply with His requirements. \u201cWhether therefore ye eat, or\ndrink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\u201d\nYou have a work to do to set your house in order. Cleanse\nyourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holi- [66]\nness in the fear of God. You should make earnest efforts to discover\nyour errors, and in the fear of God, relying upon His strength, put\nthem away. Dear brother and sister, you need to reform in the mat-\nter of order. You should cultivate a love for neatness and strict\ncleanliness. God is a God of order. He will not sanction slack and\ndisorderly habits in any of His people. In your dress, in your house,\nin all things, manifest taste and order. We are looked upon as a\npeculiar people. The dress reform is a striking contrast to the fashion\n62 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nof the world. Those who adopt this dress should manifest good taste\nand order and strict cleanliness in all their attire. The dress should\nnot be adopted unless it is made right and arranged neatly. For we\nshould seek not to disgust unbelievers by carelessness and slackness\nin our apparel, but should dress modestly, with reference to health\nand neatness, that our dress may commend itself to the judgment of\ncandid minds.\nYou need clear, energetic minds, in order to appreciate the ex-\nalted character of the truth, to value the atonement, and to place the\nright estimate upon eternal things. If you pursue a wrong course,\nand indulge in wrong habits of eating, and thereby weaken the intel-\nlectual powers, you will not place that high estimate upon salvation\nand eternal life which will inspire you to conform your life to the life\nof Christ; you will not make those earnest, self-sacrificing efforts\nfor entire conformity to the will of God, which His word requires,\nand which are necessary to give you a moral fitness for the finishing\ntouch of immortality.\n* * * * *\nChapter 7\u2014Neglect of Health Reform\nDear Brother and Sister I,\nThe Lord has shown some things in regard to you which I feel it\na duty to write. You were among the number who were presented [67]\nbefore me as backward in health reform. Light has shone upon the\npathway in which the people of God are traveling, yet all do not\nwalk in the light and follow as fast as the providence of God marks\nout and opens the way before them. Until they do this, they will\nbe in darkness. If God has spoken to His people, He designs that\nthey shall hear and obey His voice. Last Sabbath, as I was speaking,\nyour pale faces rose distinctly before me as I had been shown them.\nI saw your condition of health and the ailments you have suffered\nunder so long. I was shown that you have not lived healthfully. Your\nappetites have been unhealthy, and you have gratified the taste at\nthe expense of the stomach. You have taken into your stomachs\narticles which it is impossible to convert into good blood. This has\nlaid a heavy tax on the liver, for the reason that the digestive organs\nare deranged. You both have diseased livers. The health reform\nwould be a great benefit to you both if you would strictly carry it out.\nThis you have failed to do. Your appetites are morbid, and because\nyou do not relish a plain, simple diet, composed of unbolted wheat\nflour, vegetables and fruits prepared without spices or grease, you\nare continually transgressing the laws which God has established\nin your system. While you do this you must suffer the penalty, for\nto every transgression is affixed a penalty. Yet you wonder at your\ncontinued poor health.\nBe assured that God will not work a miracle to save you from\nthe result of your own course of action. You have not had a liberal\nsupply of air. Brother I has labored in his store, closely applying\nhimself to his business and allowing himself but a limited amount of\nair and exercise. His circulation is depressed. He breathes only from\nthe top of his lungs. It is seldom that he exercises the abdominal\nmuscles in the act of breathing. Stomach, liver, lungs, and brain are\n63\n64 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nsuffering for the want of deep, full inspirations of air, which would[68]\nelectrify the blood and impart to it a bright, lively color, and which\nalone can keep it pure and give tone and vigor to every part of the\nliving machinery.\nYou, my dear brother and sister, can have a much better condition\nof health than you now enjoy, and can avoid very many ill turns, if\nyou will simply exercise temperance in all things\u2014temperance in\nlabor, temperance in eating and drinking. Hot drinks are debilitating\nto the stomach. Cheese should never be introduced into the stomach.\nFine-flour bread cannot impart to the system the nourishment that\nyou will find in the unbolted wheat bread. The common use of\nbolted wheat bread cannot keep the system in a healthy condition.\nYou both have inactive livers. The use of fine flour aggravates the\ndifficulties under which you are laboring.\nThere is no treatment which can relieve you of your present\ndifficulties while you eat and drink as you do. You can do that\nfor yourselves which the most experienced physician can never do.\nRegulate your diet. In order to gratify the taste, you frequently place\na severe tax upon your digestive organs by receiving into the stomach\nfood which is not the most healthful, and at times in immoderate\nquantities. This wearies the stomach and unfits it for the reception\nof even the most healthful food. You keep your stomachs constantly\ndebilitated because of your wrong habits of eating. Your food is\nmade too rich. It is not prepared in a simple, natural manner, but is\ntotally unfitted for the stomach when you have prepared it to suit\nyour taste. Nature is burdened, and endeavors to resist your efforts\nto cripple her. Chills and fevers are the result of those attempts to rid\nherself of the burden you lay upon her. You have to suffer the penalty\nof nature\u2019s violated laws. God has established laws in your system\nwhich you cannot violate without suffering the punishment. You[69]\nhave consulted taste without reference to health. You have made\nsome changes, but have merely taken the first steps in reform diet.\nGod requires of us temperance in all things. \u201cWhether therefore ye\neat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\u201d\nOf all the families I am acquainted with, none need the benefit\nof the health reform more than yours. You groan under pains and\nprostrations which you cannot account for, and you try to submit\nwith as good a grace as you can, thinking affliction is your lot and\nNeglect of Health Reform 65\nProvidence has thus ordained it. If you could have your eyes opened\nand could see the steps taken in your lifetime to walk right into your\npresent condition of poor health you would be astonished at your\nblindness in not seeing the real state of the case before. You have\ncreated unnatural appetites, and do not derive half that enjoyment\nfrom your food which you would if you had not used your appetites\nwrongfully. You have perverted nature, and have been suffering the\nconsequences, and painful has it been.\nNature bears abuse as long as she can without resisting, then\nshe arouses and makes a mighty effort to rid herself of the encum-\nbrances and evil treatment she has suffered. Then come headache,\nchills, fevers, nervousness, paralysis, and other evils too numerous\nto mention. A wrong course of eating or drinking destroys health,\nand with it the sweetness of life. Oh, how many times have you\npurchased what you called a good meal at the expense of a fevered\nsystem, loss of appetite, and loss of sleep! Inability to enjoy food, a\nsleepless night, hours of suffering\u2014all for a meal in which taste was\ngratified! Thousands have indulged their perverted appetites, have\neaten a good meal, as they called it, and as the result, have brought\non a fever, or some other acute disease, and certain death. That was\nenjoyment purchased at immense cost. Yet many have done this,\nand these self-murderers have been eulogized by their friends and [70]\nthe minister, and carried directly to heaven at their death. What\na thought! Gluttons in heaven! No, no; such will never enter the\npearly gates of the golden city of God. Such will never be exalted\nto the right hand of Jesus the precious Saviour, the suffering Man\nof Calvary, whose life was one of constant self-denial and sacrifice.\nThere is a place appointed for all such among the unworthy, who\ncan have no part in the better life, the immortal inheritance.\nGod requires all men to render their bodies to Him a living\nsacrifice, not a dead or a dying sacrifice, a sacrifice which their own\ncourse of action is debilitating, filling with impurities and disease.\nGod calls for a living sacrifice. The body, He tells us, is the temple\nof the Holy Ghost, the habitation of His Spirit, and He requires all\nwho bear His image to take care of their bodies for the purpose of\nHis service and His glory. \u201cYe are not your own,\u201d says the inspired\napostle, \u201cye are bought with a price;\u201d wherefore \u201cglorify God in your\nbody, and in your spirit, which are God\u2019s.\u201d In order to do this, add to\n66 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nvirtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance\npatience. It is a duty to know how to preserve the body in the very\nbest condition of health, and it is a sacred duty to live up to the light\nwhich God has graciously given. If we close our eyes to the light\nfor fear we shall see our wrongs, which we are unwilling to forsake,\nour sins are not lessened but increased. If light is turned from in one\ncase, it will be disregarded in another. It is just as much sin to violate\nthe laws of our being as to break one of the Ten Commandments,\nfor we cannot do either without breaking God\u2019s law. We cannot\nlove the Lord with all our heart, mind, soul, and strength while we\nare loving our appetites, our tastes, a great deal better than we love\nthe Lord. We are daily lessening our strength to glorify God, when\nHe requires all our strength, all our mind. By our wrong habits\nwe are lessening our hold on life, and yet professing to be Christ\u2019s[71]\nfollowers, preparing for the finishing touch of immortality.\nMy brother and sister, you have a work to do which no one can\ndo for you. Awake from your lethargy, and Christ shall give you life.\nChange your course of living, your eating, your drinking, and your\nworking. While you pursue the course you have been following for\nyears, you cannot clearly discern sacred and eternal things. Your\nsensibilities are blunted and your intellect beclouded. You have not\nbeen growing in grace and in the knowledge of the truth as was\nyour privilege. You have not been increasing in spirituality, but\ngrowing more and more darkened. You have made too much haste to\nacquire property, and have been in danger of overreaching, looking\nout for your own interest and not regarding the interest of others as\nyou would like to have them regard yours. You have encouraged\nselfishness in yourselves, which must be overcome. Closely examine\nyour own hearts, and in your lives imitate the unerring Pattern, and\nall will be well with you. Preserve a clear conscience before God.\nIn all you do glorify His name. Divest yourselves of selfishness and\nselfish love.\n\u201cBe not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the\nrenewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and\nacceptable, and perfect, will of God.\u201d The customs and practices\nof men are not to be your criterion. However trying may be your\ncircumstances, never allow yourselves to overreach. Satan is at hand\nto tempt you to do this, and he will not let you rest in this matter.\nNeglect of Health Reform 67\nIt is possible for a merchant to be a Christian and preserve his\nintegrity before God. But in order to do this, constant watchfulness\nis necessary and earnest supplication before God to be kept from\nthe evil tendency of this degenerate age to advantage self at others\u2019\ndisadvantage. You are in a hard place to advance in the divine life.\nYou have a principle, but you do not hang all your weight upon God. [72]\nYou trust too much in your own feeble strength. You have great need\nof divine aid, of a power not to be found in yourself. There is One\nto whom you can go for counsel, whose wisdom is infinite. He has\ninvited you to come to Him, for He will supply your need. If by faith\nyou cast all your care upon Him who marks the falling of a sparrow,\nyou will not trust in vain. If you will rest upon His sure promises,\nand maintain your integrity, angels of God will be round about you.\nMaintain good works in faith before God; then will your steps be\nordered by the Lord, and His prospering hand will not be removed\nfrom you.\nIf you should be left to mark out your own course, you would\nmake poor work of the matter, and would speedily make shipwreck\nof faith. Take all your cares and burdens to the Burden Bearer.\nBut suffer not a blot to tarnish your Christian character. Never,\nnever for the sake of gain stamp your life record in heaven, which is\nviewed by all the angelic host, and by your self-denying Redeemer,\nwith avarice, penuriousness, selfishness, or false dealing. Such a\ncourse might bring you profit so far as this world views the matter;\nbut, viewed in the light of heaven, it would prove an immense, an\nirreparable loss. \u201cThe Lord seeth not as man seeth.\u201d In trusting in\nGod continually there is safety, there will not be a constant fear of\nfuture evil. This borrowed care and anxiety will cease. We have a\nheavenly Father who careth for His children, and will and does make\nHis grace sufficient in every time of need. When we take into our\nown hands the management of things that concern us, and depend\nupon our own wisdom for success, we may well have anxiety and\nanticipate danger and loss, for it will most certainly come upon us.\nFull and entire consecration to God is required of us. While the\nRedeemer of sinful mortals was laboring and suffering for us, He\ndenied Himself, and His whole life was one continued scene of toil [73]\nand privation. Had He chosen to do so, He could have passed His\ndays on earth in ease and plenty, and appropriated to Himself all the\n68 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\npleasures and enjoyments of this life. But He did not; He considered\nnot His own convenience. He lived not to gratify Himself, but to\ndo good and to save others from suffering, to help those who most\nneeded help. He endured to the end. The chastisement of our peace\nwas upon Him, and He hath borne the iniquity of us all. The bitter\ncup was apportioned to us to drink. Our sins mingled it. But our dear\nSaviour took the cup from our lips and drank it Himself, and in its\nstead He presents to us a cup of mercy, blessing, and salvation. Oh,\nwhat an immense sacrifice was this for the fallen race! What love,\nwhat wondrous and matchless love! After all this manifestation of\nsuffering to show His love, shall we shrink from the small trials we\nhave to bear? Can we love Christ, and refuse to lift the cross? Can\nwe love to be with Him in glory, and not follow Him even from the\njudgment hall to Calvary? If Christ be in us the hope of glory, we\nshall walk even as He walked; we shall imitate His life of sacrifice\nto bless others; we shall drink of the cup, and be baptized with the\nbaptism; we shall welcome a life of devotion, trial, and self-denial,\nfor Christ\u2019s sake. Heaven will be cheap enough whatever sacrifice\nwe may make to obtain it.\n* * * * *\nChapter 8\u2014Love for the Erring\nI was shown that while Sister J and Brother and Sister K have\nseen wrongs in others, they have not made efforts to correct those\nwrongs and help those whom they ought to have helped. They have\nleft them too much alone, and held them off at arms\u2019 length, and\nfelt that it was of no use to try to do anything for them. This is\nwrong. They commit an error in so doing. Christ said: \u201cI came not [74]\nto call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\u201d The Lord would\nhave us help those who most need help. While you have seen the\nerrors and wrongs in others, you have shut yourselves too much\nto yourselves, and have been too selfish in your enjoyment of the\ntruth. God does not approve this being satisfied with the truth and\nmaking no sacrifice to aid and strengthen those who need strength.\nWe are not all organized alike, and many have not been educated\naright. Their education has been deficient. Some have had a quick\ntemper transmitted to them, and their education in childhood has not\ntaught them self-control. With this fiery temper, envy and jealousy\nare frequently united. Others are faulty in other respects. Some are\ndishonest in deal, overreaching in trade. Others are arbitrary in their\nfamilies, loving to rule. Their lives are far from being correct. Their\neducation was all wrong. They were not told the sin of yielding\nto the control of these evil traits; therefore sin does not appear to\nthem so exceedingly sinful. Others, whose education has not been\nso faulty, who have had better training, have developed a much\nless objectionable character. The Christian life of all is very much\naffected for good or for evil by their previous education.\nJesus, our Advocate, is acquainted with all the circumstances\nwith which we are surrounded and deals with us according to the\nlight we have had and the circumstances in which we are placed.\nSome have a much better organization than others. While some\nare continually harassed, afflicted, and in trouble because of their\nunhappy traits of character, having to war with internal foes and the\ncorruption of their nature, others have not half so much to battle\n69\n70 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nagainst. They pass along almost free from the difficulties which their\nbrethren and sisters who are not so favorably organized are laboring\nunder. In very many cases they do not labor half so hard to overcome[75]\nand live the life of a Christian as do some of those unfortunate ones\nI have mentioned. The latter appear to disadvantage almost every\ntime, while the former appear much better because it is natural for\nthem so to do. They may not labor half as hard to watch and keep the\nbody under, yet at the same time they compare their lives with the\nlives of others who are unfortunately organized and badly educated,\nand flatter themselves with the contrast. They talk of the failings,\nerrors, and wrongs of the unfortunate, but do not feel that they have\nany burden in the matter, farther than to dwell upon those wrongs\nand shun those who are guilty of them.\nThe prominent position which you as a family occupy in the\nchurch makes it highly necessary for you to be burden bearers. Not\nthat you are to take burdens for those who are able to bear their\nown and also to aid others; but you should help those who stand\nmost in need of help, those who are less favorably situated, who\nare erring and faulty, and who may have injured you and tried your\npatience to the utmost. It is just such ones that Jesus pities, because\nSatan has more power over them and is constantly taking advantage\nof their weak points and driving his arrows to wound them where\nthey are least protected. Jesus exercises His power and mercy for\njust such pitiable cases. When He asked who loved most, Simon\nanswered: \u201cHe to whom he forgave most.\u201d Thus it will be. Jesus did\nnot shun the weak, unfortunate, and helpless, but He helped such as\nneeded help. He did not confine His visits and labors to a class more\nintelligent and less faulty, to the neglect of the unfortunate. He did\nnot inquire whether it was agreeable for Him to be a companion of\nthe poorest, the most needy. These are the ones whose company He\nsought, the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\nThis is the work you have neglected. You have shunned dis-\nagreeable responsibilities and have not gone to the erring and visited[76]\nthem, and manifested an interest and love for them, and made your-\nselves familiar with them. You have not had a spirit of Christlike\nforgiveness. You have marked out just such a course that all must\ncome up to before you could throw over them your mantle of charity.\nLove for the Erring 71\nYou are not required to cloak sin, but to exercise that pitying love\nfor the erring which Christ has exercised toward you.\nYou are placed under the most favorable circumstances for the\ndevelopment of good Christian characters. You are not where you\nfeel pinching want, or where your souls are galled and distressed\nwith the conduct of disobedient, rebellious children. In your family\nthere is no dissenting voice. You have all that heart can wish. Yet,\nnotwithstanding your favorable surroundings, you have faults and\nerrors, and much to overcome in order to be free from spiritual pride,\nselfishness, a hasty spirit, jealousy, and evil surmisings.\nBrother K has not the sin of evilspeaking to repent of, as very\nmany have, but he lacks a willingness to help those who most need\nhelp. He is selfish. He loves his home, loves quiet, rest, freedom\nfrom care, perplexities, and trials; therefore he pleases himself too\nmuch. He does not bear the burdens which Heaven has assigned\nhim. He shuns disagreeable responsibilities, and shuts himself up\ntoo much to his love of quietness. He has been quite liberal with\nmeans, but when it is necessary to deny self to do some needed\ngood, when real sacrifice on his part is called for, he has but little\nexperience, and must gain it.\nHe fears that he will be blamed if he ventures to help the erring.\n\u201cWe then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak,\nand not to please ourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbor\nfor his good to edification. For even Christ pleased not Himself; but,\nas it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on\nMe.\u201d All who are partakers of this great salvation have something to [77]\ndo to help those who are hanging on the skirts of Zion. They should\nnot cut off their hold and thrust them away without making an effort\nto help them to overcome and prepare for the judgment. No, indeed!\nWhile these are bleating around the fold, they should be encouraged\nand strengthened by all the aid which it is in our power to bestow.\nYou as a family have too rigid rules and set ideas which cannot be\nmade to fit every case. You lack love, gentleness, tenderness, and\npity for those who do not move as fast as they should. This spirit has\nprevailed to such an extent that you are withering spiritually instead\nof flourishing in the Lord. Your interest, and efforts, and anxieties\nare for your family and your relatives. But you have not entertained\nthe idea of reaching out for others around you, overcoming your\n72 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nreluctance to exert an influence outside of a special circle. You\nidolize yours, and shut yourselves within yourselves. That the Lord\nmay save me and mine is the great burden. This spirit will have to die\nbefore you can flourish in the Lord and make spiritual advancement,\nbefore the church can grow and souls be added unto them of such as\nshall be saved.\nYou are all narrowed up as to labor for others, and must change\nyour base of operations. Your relatives are no dearer in the sight\nof God than any other poor souls who need salvation. We must put\nself and selfishness under our feet, and exemplify in our lives the\nspirit of self-sacrifice and disinterested benevolence manifested by\nJesus when He was upon earth. All should have an interest for their\nrelatives, but should not allow themselves to be shut up to them as\nthough they were the only ones whom Jesus came to save.\nChapter 9\u2014Everyday Religion [78]\nBrother and Sister L,\nI was shown that you have a work to do to set your house in\norder. Brother L, you have not properly represented the truth; you\nhave loved the truth, but it has not had that sanctifying influence\nupon your life which it must have if you would be fitted for the\nsociety of heavenly angels in the kingdom of glory. You are a rough\nstick and need much hewing and need to remain in the workshop of\nGod until the rough edges are removed, the uneven surface made\nsmooth, and you are pronounced fit for the building.\nYou should be careful not to introduce the subjects of present\ntruth everywhere. You can do more in living the truth than in talking\nit to others. You can do very much by example. You need to be very\ncircumspect in your business transactions, to carry out in them the\nprinciples of your faith. Be faithful in deal, thorough in labor, ever\nbearing in mind that it is not your employer\u2019s eye alone that is to\ninspect your work, but that the eye of God is upon all the transactions\nof your life. Angels of God are viewing your work, and it should\nbe a part of your religion to have every piece of work marked with\ntruth and faithfulness. \u201cHe that is faithful in that which is least is\nfaithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also\nin much.\u201d God wants to make you right, holy, and true.\nYou do not speak wisely and judiciously to your wife and chil-\ndren. You should cultivate kindness and gentleness. Your children\nhave not had the best influence and example before them. They\nshould not control you, but you them, not harshly, not overbearingly,\nbut with firmness and steadiness of purpose.\nSister L, you have a great battle before you in order to overcome. [79]\nYou have let self keep the victory. Your stubborn will is the greatest\nenemy you have. You have an unsubdued temper, and do not control\nyour tongue. The lack of self-control has been a great injury to\nyourself and to your family. Happiness, quietude, and peace have\nabode in your dwelling but a short period at a time. If your will\n73\n74 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nis crossed you are easily irritated, and then you speak and act as\nthough a demon had possession of you. Angels turn from the scene\nof discord where angry words are exchanged. Many times have\nyou driven the precious, heavenly angels from your family by the\nindulgence of passion.\nLike begets like. The same spirit which you manifest has been\nreflected upon you again. Your children have seen so little affection,\ntenderness, and gentleness that they have had nothing to win them to\nthe truth or inspire them with respect for your authority. They have\nso long partaken of the evil fruits borne by you that their disposition\nis bitterness. They are not altogether corrupt; there are left beneath\nthe uncultivated exterior, good impulses, which might be reached\nand brought to the surface. If your religious life had been more even,\nexemplifying the life of Christ, things would be different in your\nfamily. \u201cWhatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\u201d Just\nsuch as the seed you sow will be the harvest which you will gather.\nIf gentle words were the order of the day in your dwelling, such fruit\nwould you receive.\nA heavy responsibility rests upon you. In view of this, how\ncareful should you be in all your words and acts. What kind of\nseed are you sowing in the hearts of your children? The reaping\ntime\u2014oh! remember, the reaping time is not far distant. Sow no\nfoul seed. Satan is ready to do that work. Sow only clean, pure seed.\nYou, my dear sister, have been jealous, envious, and fault-finding.\nYou have thought you were neglected and despised. You have been[80]\ntoo much neglected, but you have a work to do for yourself which\nno one can do for you. It will require effort, perseverance, and\nearnestness to obtain the victory over long-established habits which\nhave become as second nature. We have the tenderest feelings for\nyou, with all your errors and faults; and while we shall take the\nliberty to tell you your faults, we pledge ourselves to help you in\nevery way we can.\nI was shown that you do not possess that filial love which you\nshould. The evil in your nature is exercised in a most unnatural\nway. You are not tender and respectful to your parents. Whatever\nmay be their faults, you have no excuse for the course you have\npursued toward them. It has been most unfeeling and disrespectful.\nAngels turned from you in sadness, repeating these words: \u201cThat\nEveryday Religion 75\nwhich ye sow ye shall also reap.\u201d Should time continue, you would\nreceive from your children the same treatment which your parents\nhave received from you. You have not studied how you could best\nmake your parents happy, and then sacrificed your wishes and your\npleasure to this end. Their days upon earth are few at most, and will\nbe full of care and trouble even if you do all you can to smooth their\npassage to the grave. \u201cHonor thy father and thy mother: that thy days\nmay be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\u201d This\nis the first commandment with promise. It is binding upon childhood\nand youth, upon the middle-aged and the aged. There is no period\nin life when children are excused from honoring their parents. This\nsolemn obligation is binding upon every son and daughter, and is\none of the conditions to their prolonging their lives upon the land\nwhich the Lord will give the faithful. This is not a subject unworthy\nof notice, but a matter of vital importance. The promise is upon\ncondition of obedience. If you obey you shall live long in the land\nwhich the Lord your God gives you. If you disobey you shall not [81]\nprolong your life in that land.\nHere, my sister, is a subject for your prayerful consideration\nand earnest meditation. Closely examine your own heart as in the\nlight of eternity. Hide nothing from your examination. Search, oh!\nsearch, as for your life, and condemn yourself, pass judgment upon\nyourself, and then by faith claim the cleansing blood of Christ to\nremove the stains from your Christian character. Do not flatter or\nexcuse yourself. Deal truly with your own soul. And then as you\nview yourself a sinner, fall, all broken, at the foot of the cross. Jesus\nwill receive you, all polluted as you are, and will wash you in His\nblood, and cleanse you from all pollution, and make you fit for the\nsociety of heavenly angels, in a pure, harmonious heaven. There is\nno jar, no discord, there. All is health, happiness, and joy.\nSister L, you have not been indifferent to your salvation. You\nhave, at times, made earnest efforts, and have humbled yourself\nbefore the church and before God; but you have not received that\nencouragement which you needed, and which Jesus would have\nfreely given you had He been upon earth. Love is wanting in the\nchurch. Love for the erring is covered up with selfishness. There is\na great lack of this precious grace among God\u2019s people. You have\nthought that the people of God were indifferent to you, and your\n76 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nsoul has rebelled against it. They have not felt right nor talked right.\nThey have not pursued a right course. They are not justified in this.\nHeaven frowns upon it. Jesus pities you, and He invites you, weary,\nand heavy-laden, to come to Him and learn of Him who is meek\nand lowly in heart, and you shall find rest to your soul. The yoke\nof Christ is easy, and His burden is light. When perplexed, worried,\nand annoyed, flee to the Burden Bearer; tell it all to Jesus. Your\nbrethren and sisters may not appreciate your efforts, and may never[82]\nknow how hard you do try to obtain the victory; yet this should\nnot discourage you. If Jesus knows, if He is acquainted with your\nsincere efforts, be satisfied.\nThere must be a thorough reformation in your life, a transforma-\ntion by the renewing of your mind. God requires His people to help\nyou because you need help, and you should be humble enough to\nbe helped by them. When tempted to give loose rein to the unruly\nmember, oh! bear in mind that the recording angel is noting every\nword. All are written in the book, and, unless washed away by the\nblood of Christ, you must meet them again. You now have a spotted\nrecord in heaven. Sincere repentance before God will be accepted.\nWhen about to speak passionately, close your mouth. Don\u2019t utter\na word. Pray before you speak, and heavenly angels will come to\nyour assistance and drive back the evil angels, who would lead you\nto dishonor God, reproach His cause, and weaken your own soul.\nEspecially have you a work to do to confess with humiliation\nyour disrespectful course toward your parents. There is no reason for\nthis unnatural manifestation toward them. It is purely a satanic spirit,\nand you have indulged in it because your mother has not sanctioned\nyour course. Your feelings amount not only to positive dislike,\ndecided disrespect, but to hatred, malice, envy, jealousy, which are\nmanifested in your actions, causing them suffering and privation.\nYou do not feel like making them happy, or even comfortable. Your\nfeelings are changeable. Sometimes your heart softens, then it closes\nfirmly as you see some fault in them, and the angels cannot impress\nit with one emotion of love. An evil demon controls you, and you\nare hateful and hating. God has marked your disrespectful words,\nyour unkind acts to your parents, whom He has commanded you to\nhonor, and if you fail to see this great sin, and repent of it, you will[83]\ngrow darker until you will be left to your evil ways.\nEveryday Religion 77\nThe Lord is ready to help all who need help and feel that need.\nIf you see your poverty and wretchedness before God, and earnestly\ntake hold of His strength, He will help, and bless, and impart to you\nstrength, that by your good works you may lead others to glorify our\nFather who is in heaven. Will you see yourself? Will you submit\nyour will and ways to God? Will you seek for pure and undefiled\nreligion before God? Oh, what will it avail you to pass along in this\nwretched condition! You have no happiness yourself in this way\nof living, and those around you have no happiness in your society.\nSurely you make for yourself a great amount of misery; and such a\nlife as you have led is not worth much. Why not, then, be reconciled\nto God? Die to self and be converted, that Jesus may heal you. He\nwants to save you, if you will consent to be saved in His appointed\nway. May the Lord help you to see and correct every error is my\nprayer.\nBrother L, you should be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to\nwrath. Be careful of your words. Let not Satan make you a stumbling\nblock to others. There is a failure in your business transactions. You\nslight your work. You get through with it as soon as you can, thinking\nthat it will do, when it is not well done. You lack thoroughness. You\nshould cultivate taste and order in all you do. That which is worth\ndoing at all is worth doing well. If you lack faithfulness in your\nbusiness life you will lack in your religious life, and in the day of\nGod the balances of the sanctuary will reveal the fact that you are\nwanting. This lack is a reproach to your faith. Unbelievers charge\nit to dishonesty, and say: \u201cIf it is such men that keep the Sabbath, I\ndon\u2019t choose to be of that sort.\u201d\nAs men prove your work and find it deficient in durability, nicety,\nand order, they say you are a cheat, and many hard speeches have [84]\nbeen made over it. Many oaths have been uttered over your work,\nand God has been blasphemed. You do not mean to be dishonest,\nbut there is a slackness in your jobs. You think your employers are\ntoo particular, that you know what will answer as well as they; and\nhence this slack, loose, unfinished style attends your labor to a great\nextent. You should improve in this matter. You should be honorable\nin all your labor, and close up your work in a manner that will bear\nthe inspection of God. Scorn to slight any job. Be faithful in that\nwhich is least.\n78 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nTry to help your wife in the conflict before her. Be careful of\nyour words, cultivate refinement of manners, courtesy, gentleness,\nand you will be rewarded for so doing.\n* * * * *\nChapter 10\u2014Reform at Home\nBrother M,\nFrom what was shown me, there is a great work to be accom-\nplished for you before you can be accepted in the sight of God.\nSelf is too prominent. You possess a hasty, passionate temper, and\nare arbitrary and overbearing in your family. Sister M is slack and\nuntidy in her house. She has not the elements of order and neatness\nin her organization. Yet she can improve in these things. Brother\nM, you censure your wife, you are dictatorial, and do not have that\nlove which you should have. She dreads your oppressive spirit, but\ndoes not do what she might to correct her wrong habits, which make\nhome distasteful and disagreeable.\nBrother M, you have not taken a judicious course with your fam-\nily. Your children do not love you. They have more hatred than love.\nYour wife does not love you. You do not take a course to be loved.\nYou are an extremist. You are severe, exacting, arbitrary, to your\nchildren. You talk the truth to them, but do not carry its principles\ninto your everyday life. You are not patient, forbearing, and forgiv- [85]\ning. You have so long indulged your own spirit, you are so ready\nto fly into a passion if provoked, that it looks exceedingly doubtful\nwhether you will make efforts sufficient to meet the mind of Christ.\nYou do not possess the power of endurance, forbearance, gentleness,\nand love. These Christian graces must be possessed by you before\nyou can be truly a Christian. You reserve your encouraging words,\nyour kindly acts, for those who are not entitled to them as much as\nyour own wife and children. Cultivate kind words, pleasant looks,\npraise, and approbation for your own family, for this will materially\naffect your happiness. Never let censure or fretful words escape your\nlips. Subdue this desire to rule and to place your iron heel wherever\nyou can. You possess a most disagreeable spirit, a close spirit. With\nsome you are selfish and stingy; for others whom you wish to think\nhighly of you, you would sacrifice anything, even the very things\nyour own family need. You are liberal in these cases that you may\n79\n80 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nhave the praise and esteem of men. If you could purchase heaven\nby a great sacrifice for those to whom you choose to be liberal, you\nwould certainly obtain it. You do not object to being put to the\ngreatest inconvenience to advantage others, if in so doing you can\nexalt yourself. In these things you tithe mint and rue, while you\nneglect the weightier matters, justice and the love of God.\nYou are not just in your family. You have a work to do there.\nMake your wife comfortable and happy first; then consider the\ncondition of your children. Provide them with comfortable food and\nclothing. Then if you can, without limiting your wife and children,\nhelp those who most need help, and bestow your favors where they\nwill be appreciated; it will be praiseworthy for you to be liberal.\nBut your first and most sacred duty is to your family. They should\nnot be robbed for others to be favored. Let your benevolence, your\nliberality, be seen in your own family. Give them tangible proofs of[86]\nyour affection, interest, care, and love. This has much to do with\nyour happiness. Cease finding fault and scolding your wife, for this\nonly makes it much harder for you and makes a hell for her.\nAngels of God will not abide in your family until there is a\ndifferent order of things. It is not your means that is wanted. Yet\nwhen reproved you have thought it was your means that the church\nwanted. You are deceived here. You have been too liberal with your\nmeans, for the very reason that you have thought this was to obtain\nsalvation for you and buy you a position in the church. No, indeed! it\nis you that is wanted, not the little means you possess. If you would\nbe transformed by the renewing of your mind and be converted, deal\ntruly with your own soul. It is all that the church require. You have\ndeceived yourself. If any man seemeth to be religious, and bridleth\nnot his tongue, that man\u2019s religion is vain. Treat your family in a\nmanner that Heaven can approve, and so that peace may be in your\ndwelling. There needs to be everything done for your family. Your\nchildren have had your bad example before them; you have blamed,\nand censured, and manifested a passionate spirit at home, while you\nwould, at the same time, address the throne of grace, attend meeting,\nand bear testimony in favor of the truth. These exhibitions have led\nyour children to despise you and the truth you profess. They have no\nconfidence in your Christianity. They believe you to be a hypocrite,\nand it is true that you are a sadly deceived man. You can no more\nReform at Home 81\nenter heaven without a thorough change than could Simon Magus,\nwho thought that the Holy Ghost could be bought with money. Your\nfamily have seen your overreaching spirit, your readiness to take\nadvantage of others, your penurious spirit toward those with whom\nyou sometimes deal, and they despise you for it; yet they will too [87]\nsurely follow in your footsteps of wrongdoing.\nYour deal is not what it should be. It is difficult for you to deal\njustly and to love mercy. You have dishonored the cause of God by\nyour life. You have contended for the truth, but not in a right spirit.\nYou have hindered souls from embracing the truth who otherwise\nwould have done so. They have excused themselves by pointing to\nthe errors and wrongs of professed Sabbathkeepers, saying: \u201cThey\nare no better than I; they will lie, cheat, exaggerate, get angry,\nand boastingly talk of their own praise; such a religion as this I\ndo not want.\u201d Thus the unconsecrated lives of these shortcoming\nSabbathkeepers make them stumbling blocks to sinners.\nThe work now before you must commence in your family. You\nhave tried hard to improve outwardly; but the work has been too\nmuch on the surface, an outside work and not a work of the heart.\nSet your heart in order, humble yourself before God, and implore His\ngrace to help you. Do not, like the hypocritical Pharisees, do things\nto make you appear devotional and righteous in the eyes of others.\nBreak your heart before God, and know that it is impossible for you\nto deceive the holy angels. Your words and acts are all open to their\ninspection. Your motives and the intents and purposes of your heart\nstand revealed to their gaze. The most secret things are not hid from\nthem. Oh, then, rend your heart, and be not overanxious to make\nyour brethren think you are right when you are not! Be circumspect\nin your family. You are watching to see others\u2019 wrongs, but do this\nno more. The work you have now to do is to overcome your own\nwrongs, to battle with your strong internal foes. Deal justly with the\nwidow and the fatherless. Do not throw over your acts the flimsy\ncovering of deception, to influence those whom you greatly wish\nwould think you right, while your motives and acts will not bear the\nconstruction you would have put upon them.\nCease all contention, and try to be a peacemaker. Love not in [88]\nword, but in deed and in truth. Your works are to bear the inspection\nof the judgment. Will you deal truly with your own soul? Do not\n82 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ndeceive yourself. Oh, remember that God is not mocked! Those who\npossess everlasting life will have all they can do to set their houses\nin order. They must commence at their own hearts and follow up\nthe work until victories, earnest victories, are gained. Self must die,\nand Christ must live in you and be in you a well of water springing\nup into everlasting life. You now have precious hours of probation\ngranted you to form a right character even at your advanced age.\nYou now have a period allotted you in which to redeem the time.\nYou cannot in your own strength put away your errors and wrongs;\nthey have been increasing upon you for years, because you have not\nseen them in their hideousness and in the strength of God resolutely\nput them away. By living faith you must lay hold on an arm that\nis mighty to save. Humble your poor, proud, self-righteous heart\nbefore God; get low, very low, all broken in your sinfulness at His\nfeet. Devote yourself to the work of preparation. Rest not until you\ncan truly say: My Redeemer liveth, and, because He lives, I shall\nlive also.\nIf you lose heaven, you lose everything; if you gain heaven, you\ngain everything. Do not make a mistake in this matter, I implore\nyou. Eternal interests are here involved. Be thorough. May the God\nof all grace so enlighten your understanding that you may discern\neternal things, that by the light of truth your own errors, which are\nmany, may be discovered to you just as they are, that you may make\nthe necessary effort to put them away, and in the place of this evil,\nbitter fruit may bring forth fruit which is precious unto eternal life.\n\u201cBy their fruits ye shall know them.\u201d Every tree is known by its fruit.\nWhat kind of fruit shall henceforth be found upon this tree? The[89]\nfruit you bear will determine whether you are a good tree, or one of\nwhich Christ shall say to his angel: \u201cCut it down; why cumbereth it\nthe ground?\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 11\u2014A Violated Conscience\nDear Brother N,\nI feel compelled by a sense of duty to address you a few lines. I\nhave been shown some things in regard to your case which I dare\nnot withhold. I was shown that Satan took advantage of you because\nyour wife did not embrace the truth. You were thrown into the\nsociety of a corrupt woman, one whose steps take hold on hell. She\nprofessed great sympathy for you because of the opposition you\nreceived from your wife. Like the serpent in Eden, she made her\nmanners fascinating. She cast the impression on your mind that you\nwere an abused man; that your wife did not appreciate your feelings\nand reciprocate your affections; that a mistake had been made in\nyour marriage relation; until you imagined the marriage vows of\nlifelong constancy to her whom you had taken as your wife, to be\nas galling chains. You went for sympathy to this apparent angel\nin speech. You poured into her ears that which should have been\nentrusted alone to your wife whom you had vowed to love, honor,\nand cherish as long as you both should live. You forgot to watch and\npray always lest you should enter into temptation. Your soul was\nmarred by a crime. You stamped your life record in heaven with a\nfearful blot. Yet deep humiliation and repentance before God will\nbe acceptable to Him. The blood of Christ can avail to wash these\nsins away.\nYou have fallen, terribly fallen. Satan lured you on into his\nnet, and then left you to disentangle yourself as best you could.\nYou have been harassed and perplexed, and fearfully tempted. A [90]\nguilty conscience troubles you. You distrust yourself and imagine\nthat everyone else distrusts you. You are jealous of yourself and\nimagine that jealousy exists in other hearts toward you. You have\nnot confidence in yourself and imagine that your brethren have not\nconfidence in you. Satan often presents the past before you and\ntells you that it is of no use for you to try to live out the truth, the\nway is too strait for you. You have been overcome; now Satan takes\n83\n84 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nadvantage of your sinful course to make you believe that you are\npast redemption. You are on Satan\u2019s battlefield engaged in a severe\nconflict. The barrier which is thrown around every family circle,\nand which makes it sacred, you have broken down. And now Satan\nharasses you almost constantly. You are not at rest. You are not\nat peace, and you seek to make your brethren responsible for your\nconflicting feelings and doubts and jealousies; you feel that they\nare at fault, that they do not give you attention. The trouble is with\nyourself. You want your own way, and do not rend your heart before\nGod, and with brokenness and contrition cast yourself all broken,\nsinful, and polluted, upon His mercy. Your efforts to save yourself,\nif persisted in, will result in your certain ruin.\nCease your jealousies and your faultfinding. Turn your attention\nto your own case and by humble repentance, relying alone upon\nthe blood of Christ, save your own soul. Make thorough work for\neternity. If you turn from the truth you are a ruined man, your family\nis ruined. After the fortifications preserving sacred the privacy and\nprivileges of the family relation have been once broken down, it is\ndifficult to build them up; but in the strength of God, and in His\nstrength alone, you can do this. Truth, sacred truth, is your anchor,\nwhich will save you from drifting in the downward current to crime\nand destruction.\nA conscience once violated is greatly weakened. It needs the[91]\nstrength of constant watchfulness and unceasing prayer. You are\nstanding in a slippery place. You need all the strength that the truth\ncan give to fortify you and save you from making entire shipwreck.\nLife and death are before you; which will you choose? Had you seen\nthe necessity of being firmly settled upon principle, not moving from\nimpulse, and not being easily discouraged, but prepared to endure\nhardness, you would not have been overcome as you have been.\nYou have moved from impulse. You have not, like our faultless\nPattern, been willing to endure the contradiction of sinners against\nyourself. We are exhorted to remember Him who endured this, lest\nwe become weary and faint in our minds. You have been weak as a\nchild, having no power of endurance. You have not felt the necessity\nof being established, strengthened, settled, grounded, and built up in\nthe faith.\nViolated Conscience 85\nYou have felt that it might be your duty to teach the truth to\nothers instead of being taught yourself. But you must be willing to\nbe a learner, to receive the truth from others, and must cease your\nfaultfinding, your jealousies, your complaining, and in meekness\nreceive the engrafted word which is able to save your soul. It rests\nwith you whether you will have happiness or misery. You have\nonce yielded to temptation and cannot now trust your own strength.\nSatan has great power over your mind, and you will have nothing\nto hold you when you break from the restraining influence of the\ntruth. This has been as a safeguard to you to restrain you from crime\nand iniquity. Your only hope is to seek for thorough conversion and\nredeem the past by your well-ordered life and godly conversation.\nYou have moved from impulse. Excitement has been agreeable\nto your organization. Your only hope now is to sincerely repent\nof your past transgressions of God\u2019s law and purify your soul by\nobeying the truth. Cultivate purity of thought and purity of life. The [92]\ngrace of God will be your strength to restrain your passions and curb\nyour appetites. Earnest prayer and watching thereunto will bring the\nHoly Spirit to your aid to perfect the work and make you like your\nunerring Pattern.\nIf you choose to throw off the sacred, restraining influence of\nthe truth, Satan will lead you captive at his will. You will be in\ndanger of giving scope to your appetites and passions, giving loose\nrein to lusts, to evil and abominable desires. Instead of bearing\nin your countenance a calm serenity under trial and affliction, like\nfaithful Enoch, having your face radiant with hope and that peace\nwhich passeth understanding, you will stamp your countenance with\ncarnal thoughts, with lustful desires. You will bear the impress of\nthe satanic instead of the divine.\n\u201cWhereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious\npromises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine na-\nture, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through\nlust.\u201d It is now your privilege, by humble confession and sincere\nrepentance, to take words and return unto the Lord. The precious\nblood of Christ can cleanse you from all impurity, remove all your\ndefilement, and make you perfect in Him. The mercies of Christ are\nstill within your reach if you will accept them. For the sake of your\nwronged wife, and your children, the fruit of your own body, cease\n86 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nto do evil, and learn to do well. That which you sow, you shall also\nreap. If you sow to the flesh you shall of the flesh reap corruption.\nIf you sow to the Spirit you shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.\nYou must overcome your sensitiveness and faultfinding. You\nare jealous that others do not give you all the attention you think\nyou should have. The experience founded in feeling, and savoring\nof fanaticism, you must not adhere to. It is unsafe. Move from\nprinciple, from thorough understanding. Search the Scriptures, and[93]\nbe able to give to every man that asketh you the reasons of the hope\nwhich is in you, with meekness and fear. Let self-exaltation die.\n\u201cCleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-\nminded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be\nturned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.\u201d When harassed with\ntemptations and evil thoughts, there is but One to whom you can\nflee for relief and succor. Flee to Him in your weakness. When near\nHim, Satan\u2019s arrows are broken and cannot harm you. Your trials\nand temptations borne in God will purify and humble, but will not\ndestroy or endanger you.\n* * * * *\nChapter 12\u2014Warnings and Reproofs\nDear Brother O,\nI was shown that you were enshrouded in darkness, which was\nnot relieved by rays of light from Jesus. You did not seem sensible\nof your danger, but were in a state of listless indifference, unfeeling\nand unconcerned. I inquired the cause of this much-to-be-dreaded\ncondition, and was pointed back for years, and shown that you\nhad not, since you embraced the truth, been sanctified through it.\nYou have gratified your appetite and your lustful passions to the\ndestruction of your own spirituality. I was shown that God had given\nlight through the gifts placed in the church, which would instruct,\ncounsel, guide, reprove, and warn. These testimonies which you\nhave professed to believe were from God, you have not regarded to\nlive them out. To disregard light is to reject it. The rejection of light\nleaves men captives bound about by chains of darkness and unbelief.\nI was shown that you have increased your family without re-\nalizing the responsibility you were bringing upon yourself. It has\nbeen impossible for you to do justice to your companion or to your\nchildren. Your first wife ought not to have died, but you brought [94]\nupon her cares and burdens which ended in the sacrifice of her life.\nYour present wife has a hard lot; her vitality is nearly exhausted. By\nincreasing your family so rapidly, you have been kept in a state of\npoverty, and the mother, engaged in rearing the young members of\nthe family, has not had a fair chance for her life. She has nursed her\nchildren under the most unfavorable circumstances, when heated\nover the cookstove. She could not instruct them as she should, nor\nregulate their habits of eating and working. The result of eating\nfood not the most healthful, and otherwise violating the laws which\nGod has established in our being, has brought disease and premature\ndeath upon your elder children. Disease has been transmitted to your\noffspring, and the free use of flesh meats has increased the difficulty.\nThe eating of pork has aroused and strengthened a most deadly hu-\nmor which was in the system. Your offspring are robbed of vitality\n87\n88 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nbefore they are born. You have not added to virtue knowledge, and\nyour children have not been taught how to preserve themselves in\nthe best condition of health. Never should one morsel of swine\u2019s\nflesh be placed upon your table.\nYour children have come up, instead of being brought up and\neducated to the end that they might become Christians. In many\nrespects your cattle have received better treatment than your children.\nYou have not done your duty to your children, but have left them to\ngrow up in ignorance. You have not realized the responsibility you\ntook upon yourself in bringing into the world so numerous a flock,\nthat you were in a great measure accountable for their salvation.\nYou cannot throw off this responsibility. You have robbed your\nchildren of their rights by not interesting yourself in their education\nand instructing them patiently and faithfully in regard to forming\ncharacters for heaven. Your course has done much to destroy their\nconfidence in you. You are exacting, overbearing, tyrannical; you\nfret, and scold, and censure, and by so doing wean their affections[95]\nfrom you. You treat them as though they had no just rights, as though\nthey were machines to turn in your hands according to your pleasure.\nYou provoke them to wrath, and often discourage them. You do not\ngive them love and affection. Love begets love, affection begets\naffection. The spirit which you manifest toward your children will\nbe reflected upon you.\nYou are in a critical condition, and have no true sense of it. It\nis impossible for an intemperate man to be a patient man. First\ntemperance, then patience. You have so long lived for self, and\nfollowed the imagination of your own heart, that you cannot discern\nsacred things. Your lustful appetite and passions have controlled you.\nThe higher order of mental organs has been weakened and controlled\nby the lower, baser organs. The animal propensities have been\ngaining strength. When reason is left to be controlled by appetite,\nthe high sense of sacred things is impaired. The mind is debased,\nthe affections are unsanctified, and the words and acts testify what\nis in the heart. God has been displeased and dishonored by your\nconversation and your deportment. Your words have not been select\nand well chosen; low, vulgar conversation comes naturally to your\nlips, even in the presence of children and youth. Your influence in\nthis respect has been bad.\nWarnings and Reproofs 89\nYour example has not been right, and you have stood directly in\nthe way of your own children, and the children of Sabbathkeepers,\nseeking the Lord. Your course, in this respect, cannot be too severely\ncensured. \u201cOut of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\nA good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth\ngood things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth\nevil things. But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall\nspeak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For\nby thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be [96]\ncondemned.\u201d Your heart needs to be purified, cleansed, sanctified,\nthrough obedience to the truth. Nothing can save you but a thor-\nough conversion\u2014a true sense of your sinful ways and a thorough\ntransformation by the renewing of your mind.\nYou have been very zealous to plead the necessity of not denying\nour faith by our works, and have made your faith an excuse for\nnot granting your children an opportunity to obtain an education\nin even the common branches. Knowledge in regard to yourself\nis what you need, and you will yet have to see the necessity of\nobtaining it. Knowledge is what your children need but do not\nhave the privilege of obtaining. With this great lack they cannot\nbecome useful members of society, and they will be deficient in their\nreligious education. A weighty responsibility rests at your door. You\nare shortening the life of your wife. How can she glorify God in her\nbody and spirit, which are His?\nGod has given you light and knowledge, which you have pro-\nfessed to believe came direct from Him, instructing you to deny\nappetite. You know that the use of swine\u2019s flesh is contrary to His\nexpress command, given not because He wished to especially show\nHis authority, but because it would be injurious to those who should\neat it. Its use would cause the blood to become impure, so that\nscrofula and other humors would corrupt the system, and the whole\norganism would suffer. Especially would the fine, sensitive nerves\nof the brain become enfeebled and so beclouded that sacred things\nwould not be discerned, but be placed upon the low level with com-\nmon things. Light showing that disease is caused by using this gross\narticle of food has come just as soon as God\u2019s people could bear it.\nHave you heeded the light?\n90 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nYou have gone directly contrary to the light which God has been\npleased to give in regard to the use of tobacco. The gratification of[97]\nappetite has eclipsed the light given of Heaven, and you have made\na God of this hurtful indulgence. It is your idol. You have bowed\nto this instead of God, at the same time professing great faith in the\nvisions, but acting entirely contrary to them. For years you have not\nadvanced one step in the divine life, but have been growing weaker\nand weaker, darker and darker. You have felt sadly afflicted over the\ncourse of Brother P in opposing the truth as he has done. You have\nascribed the weak, discouraged state of the church to his opposition.\nIt is true that he has been a great hindrance to the advancement of\nthe cause of God in -----. But the course you have pursued, while\nprofessing to know the truth and to have an experience in the cause\nof God, has been a greater hindrance than his course. If you had\nstood in the counsel of God and been sanctified through the truth\nwhich you professed to believe, Brother P would not have had all\nthe doubts he has had. Your position as a defender of the visions has\nbeen a stumbling block to those who were unbelieving. I was shown\nthat your brother tried to stand up under the heavy burdens which\nthe sad condition of the church brought upon him until he nearly\nfell under the weight he was bearing, and left for his life. I saw that\nGod\u2019s care was over Brother and Sister R, and if their faith remained\nunwavering they would yet see the salvation of God in their own\nhouse and in the church.\nI was shown the case of dear Brother and Sister S. They had\nbeen passing through the dark waters, and the billows had nearly\ngone over their heads; yet God loved them, and if they would only\ntrust their ways to Him He would bring them forth from the furnace\nof affliction purified. Brother S has looked upon the dark side, and\ndoubted whether he was a child of God\u2014doubted his salvation. I\nsaw that he should not labor too hard to believe, but should trust in\nGod as a child would confide in its parents. He worries too much\u2014[98]\nhe worries himself out of the arms of Jesus, and gives the enemy\na chance to tempt and annoy him. God knows the feebleness of\nthe body and of the mind, and will require no more of him than\nHe will give him strength to perform. He has tried to be faithful\nand true to his profession. He has failed in his life in a number of\nthings, all ignorantly. In regard to the discipline of his children, he\nWarnings and Reproofs 91\nhas considered it his duty to be strict, and has carried this discipline\ntoo far. He has treated small offenses with too great severity. This\nhas had an influence to wean, in a degree, the affection of the son\nfrom the father. During his sickness Brother S has had a diseased\nimagination. His nervous system has been all deranged, and he has\nthought that his children did not feel for him and love him as they\nshould; but this was the result of disease. Satan wished to destroy\nhim and dishearten and discourage his poor children. But God has\nnot laid this to his charge. His children have greater burdens to\nbear than many that are older than they, and they deserve careful\ndiscipline, judicious training, mingled with sympathy, love, and\ngreat tenderness.\nThe mother has had especial strength and wisdom from God\nto encourage and help her husband, and to do much in binding\nher children to her heart and strengthening their affection for their\nparents and for one another. I saw that angels of mercy were hovering\nover this family, although prospects looked so dark and foreboding.\nThose who have had bowels of compassion for Brother S will never\nhave cause to regret it, for he is a child of God, beloved of Him.\nThe depressed state of the church has been very detrimental to his\nhealth. I saw him looking on the dark side, distrustful of himself,\nand looking down into the grave. He must not dwell on these things,\nbut look to Jesus, a pattern that is unerring. He must encourage\ncheerfulness and courage in the Lord\u2014talk faith, talk hope; rest in\nGod, and not feel that a severe, taxing effort is required on his part. [99]\nAll that God requires is simple trust\u2014to drop into His arms with\nall his weakness, and brokenness, and imperfection, and Jesus will\nhelp the helpless, and strengthen and build up those who feel that\nthey are very weakness itself. God will be glorified in his affliction,\nthrough the patience, faith, and submission exemplified by him. Oh!\nthis will prove the power of the truth we profess; it is consolation\nwhen we need it; it is support when every prop of an earthly nature,\nwhich has been a measurable support, is removed.\nI was also shown the case of Brother T. He has placed himself\nin a condition of bondage to which God did not call him. God is\nnot pleased when aged fathers give their stewardship into the hands\nof unconsecrated children, even though these profess the truth. But\nwhen the means which the Lord has entrusted to His people is placed\n92 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nin the hands of unbelieving children who are enemies to God, He\nis dishonored; for that which should be retained in the ranks of the\nLord is placed in the enemy\u2019s ranks.\nAgain, Brother T has acted the part of a deceiver. He has used\ntobacco, but would have his brethren think that he did not use it. I\nsaw that this sin has prevented his advancement in the divine life.\nHe has a work to do, at his advanced age, to abstain from fleshly\nlusts which war against the soul. He has loved the truth, and has\nsuffered for the truth\u2019s sake. Now he should so estimate the eternal\nreward, the treasure in the heavens, the immortal inheritance, the\ncrown of glory that is unfading, that he can cheerfully sacrifice the\ngratification of depraved appetite, let the consequence or suffering\nbe ever so great, in order to accomplish the work of purification of\nthe flesh and of the spirit.\nI was then shown his daughter-in-law. She is beloved of God, but\nheld in servile bondage, fearing, trembling, desponding, doubting,\nand very nervous. This sister should not feel that she must yield[100]\nher will to a godless youth who has less years upon his head than\nherself. She should remember that her marriage does not destroy\nher individuality. God has claims upon her higher than any earthly\nclaim. Christ has bought her with His own blood. She is not her\nown. She fails to put her entire trust in God, and submits to yield\nher convictions, her conscience, to an overbearing, tyrannical man,\nfired up by Satan whenever his satanic majesty can work effectually\nthrough him to intimidate this trembling, shrinking soul. She has\nso many times been thrown into agitation that her nervous system\nis shattered, and she is merely a wreck. Is it the will of the Lord\nthat this sister should be in this state and God be robbed of her\nservice? No. Her marriage was a deception of the devil. Yet now\nshe should make the best of it, treat her husband with tenderness,\nand make him as happy as she can without violating her conscience;\nfor if he remains in his rebellion, this world is all the heaven he will\nhave. But to deprive herself of the privilege of meetings, to gratify\nan overbearing husband possessing the spirit of the dragon, is not\naccording to God\u2019s will. He wants this trembling soul to flee to\nHim. He will be a covert to her. He will be like the shadow of a\ngreat rock in a weary land. Only have faith, trust in God and He will\nstrengthen and bless. All three of her children are susceptible to the\nWarnings and Reproofs 93\ninfluences of the truth and Spirit of God. Could these children be as\nfavorably situated as are many Sabbathkeeping children, all would\nbe converted and enlist in the army of the Lord.\nI was then shown a young girl of the same place, who had de-\nparted from God and was enshrouded in darkness. Said the angel:\n\u201cShe did run well for a season; what did hinder her?\u201d I was pointed\nback and saw that it was a change of surroundings. She was asso-\nciating with youth like herself, who were filled with hilarity and\nglee, pride, and love of the world. Had she regarded the words of [101]\nChrist, she need not have yielded to the enemy. Watch ye and pray,\nlest ye enter into temptation.\u201d Temptation may be all around us, but\nthis does not make it necessary that we should enter into temptation.\nThe truth is worth everything. Its influence tends not to degrade,\nbut to elevate, refine, purify, and exalt to immortality and the throne\nof God. Said the angel: \u201cWill ye have Christ, or the world?\u201d Satan\npresents the world with its most alluring, flattering charms to poor\nmortals, and they gaze upon it, and its glitter and tinsel eclipse the\nglory of heaven and that life which is as enduring as the throne\nof God. A life of peace, happiness, joy unspeakable, which shall\nknow nothing of sorrow, sadness, pain, nor death, is sacrificed for a\nshort lifetime of sin. All who will turn from the pleasures of earth,\nand with Moses choose rather to suffer affliction with the people\nof God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, esteeming\nthe reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of the world,\nwill, with faithful Moses, receive the unfading crown of immortality\nand the far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\nThe mother of this girl has at different times been susceptible\nto the influence of the truth, but she has soon lost the impression\nthrough indecision. She lacks decision of character, is too vacillat-\ning, and is affected too much by unbelievers. She must encourage\ndecision, fortitude, steadiness of purpose, which will not be swerved\nto the right or left by circumstances. She must not be in a state of\nsuch vacillation. If she does not reform in this respect she will be\neasily ensnared and taken captive by Satan at his will. She will have\nto possess perseverance and firmness in the work of overcoming, or\nshe will be overcome and lose her soul. The work of salvation is not\nchild\u2019s play, to be taken hold of at will and let alone at pleasure. It\nis the steady purpose, the untiring effort, that will gain the victory [102]\n94 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nat last. It is he who endureth to the end that shall be saved. It is\nthey who patiently continue in well-doing that shall have eternal\nlife and the immortal reward. If this dear sister had been true to\nher convictions, and had possessed steadiness of purpose, she might\nhave exerted a saving influence in her family, over her husband,\nand she might have been a special help to her daughter. All who\nare engaged in this warfare with Satan and his host have a close\nwork before them. They must not be as impressible as wax, that the\nfire can melt into any form. They must endure hardness as faithful\nsoldiers, stand at their post, and be true every time.\nGod\u2019s Spirit is striving with this entire family. He will save them\nif they are willing to be saved in His appointed way. Now is the\nhour of probation. Now is the day of salvation. Now, now, is God\u2019s\ntime. In Christ\u2019s stead we beseech them to become reconciled to\nGod while they may, and in humility, with fear and trembling, work\nout their salvation. I was shown that it was the work of Satan to keep\nthe church in a state of insensibility, that the youth may be secured in\nhis own ranks. I saw that the youth were susceptible of the influence\nof the truth. If the parents would consecrate themselves to God and\nlabor with interest for the conversion of their children, God would\nreveal Himself to them and magnify His name among them.\nI was then shown the case of Brother U, that Satan had been\nfastening his bands about him and leading him away from God and\nhis brethren. Brother V has had an influence to greatly darken this\nbrother\u2019s understanding with his unbelief. I was pointed back and\nshown that the wisest course was not pursued in this brother\u2019s case.\nThere was not sufficient reason why he should have been left out\nof the church. He should have been encouraged, even urged, to\nunite with his brethren in church capacity. He was in a more fit\nstate to come into the church than several who were united with\nit. He did not understand things clearly, and the enemy used this[103]\nmisunderstanding to his injury. God, who sees hearts, has been\nbetter pleased with the life and deportment of Brother U than with\nthe lives of some who were united with the church. It is the Lord\u2019s\nwill that he should come close to his brethren, that he may be a\nstrength to them and they a strength to him.\nThe wife of Brother U can be reached by the truth. In many\nrespects her deportment is not as questionable as that of some who\nWarnings and Reproofs 95\nprofess to believe all the truth. Yet she must not look at the failures\nand wrongs of those who profess better things, but earnestly inquire:\nWhat is truth? She can exert an influence for good in connection\nwith her companion. These souls, sanctified through the truth, can\nin the strength of God be pillars in the church and have a saving\ninfluence upon others. These dear souls are accountable to God for\nthe influence they exert. They either gather with Christ or scatter\nabroad. God requires the weight of their influence in His cause on\nthe side of truth. Jesus has bought them by His own blood. They\nare not their own, for they have been bought with a price. Therefore\nthe work is before them to glorify God in their bodies and spirits,\nwhich are His. We are doing work for eternity. It is of the highest\nimportance that every hour be employed in the service of God, and\nthus to secure a treasure in heaven.\nI was shown your case, Brother V , in connection with the church\nat -----, two years ago. The vision related to the past, present, and\nfuture. As we travel and I stand before the people in different places,\nthe Spirit of the Lord brings before me clearly the cases I have been\nshown, reviving the matter previously given me. I was shown you\nas receiving the Sabbath, while you stood opposed to important\ntruths connected with the Sabbath. You were not fortified with all\nthe truth. I then saw your mind directed in the channel of unbelief, [104]\nof doubt and distrust, and seeking to obtain those things which were\ncalculated to strengthen unbelief and darkness. Instead of searching\nfor evidence to strengthen faith, you took the opposite course, and\nSatan directed your mind in a course to suit his own purposes. You\nlove to combat, and when you enter the field of battle you know not\nwhen to lay down your arms. You love to argue, and have indulged\nin this until it has led you from the light, led you from the truth and\nfrom God, to where you have been enshrouded in darkness, and\nunbelief has taken possession of your mind. You have been blinded\nby Satan.\nLike faithless Thomas, you have considered it a virtue to doubt\nunless you could have unmistakable evidence, removing from your\nmind all cause for doubt. Did Jesus commend the unbelieving\nThomas while granting him the evidence which he declared he\nwould have before he believed? Jesus said unto him: \u201cBe not faith-\nless, but believing.\u201d Thomas answered: \u201cMy Lord and my God.\u201d\n96 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nHe is now compelled to believe; there is no room to doubt. Jesus\nthen said: \u201cThomas, because thou hast seen Me, thou hast believed:\nblessed are they that havenot seen, and yet have believed.\u201d You were\nrepresented to me as uniting with the rebel leader and his host to\nannoy, perplex, dishearten, discourage, and overthrow those who\nare battling for the right, who are standing under the bloodstained\nbanner of Prince Immanuel. Your influence, I was shown, has turned\nsouls from keeping the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. You\nhave employed your talents and your skill to manufacture weapons\nto place in the hands of the enemies of God, to fight those who are\ntrying to obey God in keeping His commandments. While angels\nhave been commissioned to strengthen the things that remain, to\nwithstand and counteract your influence, they have looked with the\ndeepest grief upon your work to dishearten and destroy. You have[105]\ncaused pure, sinless, holy angels to weep.\nThose who are living amid the perils of the last days, days which\nare characterized by the masses turning from the truth of God to\nfables, will have close work to turn from the fables which are pre-\npared for them on every hand, and have an appetite to feast upon\nunpopular truth. Those who turn from these fables to truth are de-\nspised, hated, and persecuted by those who are presenting fables\nto the people for their reception. Satan is at war with the remnant\nwho are endeavoring to keep the commandments of God and the\ntestimony of Jesus. Evil angels are commissioned to employ men as\ntheir agents upon the earth. These can the most successfully exert\nan influence to make Satan\u2019s attacks effective against the remnant\nwhom God calls \u201ca chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy\nnation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of\nHim who hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.\u201d\nThis, Satan is determined to hinder. He will employ everyone who\nwill engage in his service to hinder the chosen people of God from\nshowing forth the praises of Him who has called them from darkness\ninto His marvelous light. To hide, to cover up this light, to cause\npeople to distrust it, to disbelieve it, is the work of the great rebel\nand his host. While Jesus is purifying His people unto Himself,\nredeeming them from all iniquity, Satan will employ his forces to\nhinder the work and prevent the perfection of the saints. He does not\nexert his power upon those who are all covered up with deception\nWarnings and Reproofs 97\nand walled in by fables and error, and who make no effort to receive\nand obey the truth. He knows he is sure of them; but those who are\nseeking for truth, that they may obey it in the love of it, are the ones\nwho excite his malice and stir his ire. He can never weaken them\nwhile they keep close to Jesus; therefore he is pleased when he can\nlead them in a course of disobedience.\nWhen we sin against God, there is a disposition to fall behind [106]\nJesus a day\u2019s journey; we seek to separate from His company because\nit is distasteful, for every ray of light from His divine presence points\nto the sin of which we have been guilty. Satan exults over the sins\nwhich he has induced souls to commit, and he makes the most of\nall these failures and sins. He rehearses them to the angels of God,\nand taunts them with these weaknesses and failures. He is in every\nsense an accuser of the brethren, and exults over every sin and wrong\nwhich God\u2019s people are beguiled to commit. You, Brother V , have\nbeen engaged in this same work to quite an extent. You have taken\nwhat appeared to you like wrongs, weaknesses, and errors in the\nranks of Sabbathkeeping Adventists, and have brought them to the\nnotice of the enemies of our faith who were warring against that\ncompany unto whom angels of heaven were ministering, and whose\ncause Jesus, their Advocate, was pleading before His Father. He\ncries, \u201cSpare them, Father, spare them, they are the purchase of My\nblood,\u201d and lifts to His Father His wounded hands. You have been\nguilty before God of a great sin. You have been taking advantage of\nthose things which grieve, which bring anguish upon the people of\nGod as they see some of their numbers unconsecrated and frequently\novercome by Satan. Instead of aiding these erring souls to get right,\nyou have triumphantly made their errors conspicuous to those who\nhated them because they professed to keep the commandments of\nGod and the faith of Jesus. You have made it very hard for those\nwho were engaged in the work of saving the erring, hunting up the\nlost sheep of the house of Israel.\nBecause of Israel\u2019s disobedience and departure from God, they\nwere allowed to be brought into close places and to suffer adversity;\ntheir enemies were permitted to make war with them, to humble\nthem and lead them to seek God in their trouble and distress. \u201cThen\ncame Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.\u201d This took place [107]\nimmediately after the children of Israel had given themselves up\n98 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nto their rebellious murmurings and to unjust, unreasonable com-\nplaints against their leaders whom God had qualified and appointed\nto lead them through the wilderness to the land of Canaan. The Lord\ndirected their course where there was no water, to prove them, to\nsee if, after receiving so many evidences of His power, they had\nlearned to turn to Him in their affliction, and had repented of their\npast rebellious murmurings against Him. They had charged Moses\nand Aaron with selfish motives in bringing them from Egypt to kill\nthem and their children with hunger, that they might be enriched\nwith their possessions. In doing this the Israelites ascribed to man\nthat which they had received unmistakable evidence was from God\nalone, whose power is unlimited. These wonderful manifestations\nof the power of God He would have them ascribe to Him alone, and\nmagnify His name upon the earth. The Lord brought them over the\nsame ground of trial repeatedly to prove whether they had yet learned\nHis dealings and repented of their sinful disobedience and rebellious\nmurmurings. In Rephidim, when the people thirsted for water, they\nwere again proud, and showed that they still possessed an evil heart\nof unbelief, of murmuring, of rebellion, which revealed the fact that\nit would not yet be safe to establish them in the land of Canaan.\nIf they would not glorify God in their trials and adversity, in their\ntravels through the wilderness to the Canaan in prospect, while God\nwas continually giving them unmistakable evidence of His power\nand glory, and His care for them, they would not magnify His name\nand glorify Him when established in the land of Canaan, surrounded\nwith blessings and prosperity. Because the people thirsted for water,\nthey were provoked, so that Moses feared for his life.\nWhen Israel was assailed by the Amalekites, Moses gave Joshua\ndirections to fight with their enemies while he would stand with[108]\nthe rod of God in his hand, with his hand raised toward heaven in\nthe sight of the people, showing to rebellious, murmuring Israel\nthat their strength and power was in God. He was their might and\nthe source of their strength. There was no power in that rod; God\nwrought through Moses. Moses had to receive all his strength from\nabove. When he held up his hands, Israel prevailed; when he let\ndown his hands, Amalek prevailed. When Moses became weary,\npreparations were needful to keep his weary hands continually raised\ntoward heaven. Aaron and Hur prepared a seat for Moses, and then\nWarnings and Reproofs 99\nboth engaged in holding up his weary hands until the going down of\nthe sun. These men thus showed to Israel their duty to sustain Moses\nin his arduous work while he should receive the word from God to\nspeak to them. This act was also to show Israel that God alone held\ntheir destiny in His hands, that He was their acknowledged leader.\n\u201cAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book,\nand rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the\nremembrance of Amalek from under heaven.... For he said, Because\nthe Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalek from\ngeneration to generation.\u201d Remember what Amalek did unto thee by\nthe way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt; how he met thee by\nthe way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble\nbehind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.\nTherefore it shall be, when the Lord thy God hath given thee rest\nfrom all thine enemies round about, in the land which the Lord thy\nGod giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot\nout the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not\nforget it.\u201d\nAs the angel of God presented these facts in the travels and\nexperience of the children of Israel, I was deeply impressed with the\nespecial regard of God for His people. Notwithstanding their errors, [109]\ntheir disobedience, and their rebellion, they were still God\u2019s chosen\npeople. He had especially honored them by coming down from His\nholy habitation upon Mount Sinai and, in majesty and glory and\nawful grandeur, speaking the Ten Commandments in the audience\nof all the people and writing them with His own finger on the tables\nof stone. The Lord says of His people Israel: \u201cFor thou art an holy\npeople unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee\nto be a special people unto Himself, above all people that are upon\nthe face of the earth. The Lord did not set His love upon you, nor\nchoose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for\nye were the fewest of all people: but because the Lord loved you,\nand because He would keep the oath which He had sworn unto your\nfathers.\u201d\nI was shown that those who are trying to obey God and purify\ntheir souls through obedience to the truth are God\u2019s chosen people,\nHis modern Israel. God says of them, through Peter: \u201cBut ye are\na chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar\n100 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\npeople; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath\ncalled you out of darkness into His marvelous light.\u201d As it was a\ncrime for Amalek to take advantage of the children of Israel in their\nweakness and weariness, to annoy, perplex, and discourage them,\nso it was no small sin for you to be closely watching to discover the\nweakness, the haltings, the errors and sins of God\u2019s afflicted people,\nand expose the same to their enemies. You were doing Satan\u2019s work,\nnot the work of God. Many of the Sabbathkeeping Adventists in\n----- have been very weak. They have been miserable representatives\nof the truth. They have not been an honor to the cause of present\ntruth, and the cause would have been better off without them. You\nhave taken the unconsecrated lives of Sabbathkeepers as an excuse\nfor your occupying a position of doubt and unbelief. It has also\nstrengthened your unbelief to see that some of these unconsecrated [110]\nones were professing strong faith in the visions, vindicating them\nwhen opposed, and defending them with warmth, while, at the same\ntime that they professed so much zeal, they were disregarding the\nteachings given through vision and were going directly contrary to\nthem. In this respect they were stumbling blocks to Brother U, and\nwere bringing the visions into disrepute by their course of action.\nBrother V , I was shown that you had a proud heart, and when\nyou thought your writings were slighted at the Review office, your\npride was touched, and you commenced a warfare which has been\nlike Saul\u2019s kicking against the pricks. You have joined hands with\nthose who turn the truth of God into a lie. You have strengthened\nthe hands of sinners and opposed the counsel of God against your\nown soul. You have been warring against that of which you had no\nknowledge. You have not known what work you were doing. I saw\nyour wife wrestling with God in prayer, her faith firmly grasping\nyou and at the same time fixed upon the throne, pleading the never-\nfailing promises of God. Her heart has ached as she has seen you\npersisting in your warfare against the truth. I was shown that you\nwere doing this ignorantly, blinded by Satan. While engaged in this\nwarfare you were not increasing in spirituality and devotion to God.\nYou had not the witness that your ways pleased God. You had a\nzeal, but not according to knowledge. You had no experience in my\ncalling, had scarcely seen me, and had no knowledge of my work.\nWarnings and Reproofs 101\nBrother V , you possess qualifications which would make you of\nspecial service in the church at -----, or in any other church, were\nyour talents devoted to the upbuilding of the cause of God. I saw\nthat your children were now in a state to be impressed with the\ntruth, and Jesus was pleading for you, Brother V: \u201cSpare him a little\nlonger.\u201d I was shown that if you were converted to the truth, you [111]\nwould make a pillar in the church, and could honor God by your\ninfluence, sanctified through the truth.\nI saw angels of mercy hovering about Brother V . I was shown\nthat he was greatly deceived in the moral worth and standing before\nGod of that class who have withdrawn from the body. A few honest\nones are among them; these will be rescued; but the most of them\nhave long been unconsecrated in heart, and the close testimonies\nhave been in their way, a yoke of bondage to them. They have\nthrown off the yoke and retained their corrupt ways. God calls upon\nyou to separate from them. Cut loose from these whose delight it is\nto war against the truth of God. A little from this, true character will\nbe developed. They are of that class who love and make a lie.\nIf your whole interest is in the truth and the preparatory work for\nthis time you will be sanctified through the truth and receive a fitness\nfor immortality. You are in danger of being too exacting with your\nchildren and not as patient as is necessary. The thorough work of\npreparation must go on with all who profess the truth, until we stand\nbefore the throne of God without fault, without a spot, or wrinkle,\nor any such thing. God will cleanse you if you will submit to the\npurifying process.\n102 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nNumber Sixteen\u2014Testimony for the [112]\nChurch\nChapter 13\u2014Object of Personal Testimonies\nDear Brethren and Sisters,\nThe Lord has again manifested Himself to me. June 12, 1868,\nwhile speaking to the brethren in the house of worship at Battle\nCreek, Michigan, the Spirit of God came upon me, and in an instant\nI was in vision. The view was extensive. I had commenced to write\nthe fifth volume of Spiritual Gifts; but as I had testimonies of a\npractical nature which you should have immediately, I left that work\nto prepare this little pamphlet.\nIn this last vision I was shown that which fully justifies my\ncourse in publishing personal testimonies. When the Lord singles\nout individual cases and specifies their wrongs, others, who have\nnot been shown in vision, frequently take it for granted that they are\nright, or nearly so. If one is reproved for a special wrong, brethren\nand sisters should carefully examine themselves to see wherein they\nhave failed and wherein they have been guilty of the same sin. They\nshould possess the spirit of humble confession. If others think them\nright, it does not make them so. God looks at the heart. He is proving\nand testing souls in this manner. In rebuking the wrongs of one,\nHe designs to correct many. But if they fail to take the reproof to\nthemselves, and flatter themselves that God passes over their errors[113]\nbecause He does not especially single them out, they deceive their\nown souls and will be shut up in darkness and be left to their own\nways to follow the imagination of their own hearts.\nMany are dealing falsely with their own souls and are in a great\ndeception in regard to their true condition before God. He employs\nways and means to best serve His purpose and to prove what is in\nthe hearts of His professed followers. He makes plain the wrongs\nof some that others may thus be warned, and fear, and shun those\nerrors. By self-examination they may find that they are doing the\nsame things which God condemns in others. If they really desire\nto serve God, and fear to offend Him, they will not wait for their\nsins to be specified before they make confession and with humble\n104\nObject of Personal Testimonies 105\nrepentance return unto the Lord. They will forsake the things which\nhave displeased God, according to the light given to others. If, on\nthe contrary, those who are not right see that they are guilty of the\nvery sins that have been reproved in others, yet continue in the same\nunconsecrated course because they have not been specially named,\nthey endanger their own souls, and will be led captive by Satan at\nhis will.\n* * * * *\nChapter 14\u2014Moving to Battle Creek\nIn the vision given me June 12, 1868, I was shown that a great\nwork might be accomplished in bringing souls to the knowledge\nof the truth, were proper exertions made. In every town, city, and\nvillage there are persons who would embrace the truth if it were\nbrought before them in a judicious manner. Missionaries are needed\namong us, self-sacrificing missionaries, who, like our great Exem-\nplar, would not please themselves, but live to do others good.\nI was shown that as a people we are deficient. Our works are not[114]\nin accordance with our faith. Our faith testifies that we are living\nunder the proclamation of the most solemn and important message\nthat was ever given to mortals. Yet in full view of this fact, our\nefforts, our zeal, our spirit of self-sacrifice, do not compare with the\ncharacter of the work. We should awake from the dead, and Christ\nwill give us life.\nWith many of our brethren and sisters there is a strong incli-\nnation to live in Battle Creek. Families have been coming from\nall directions to reside there, and many more have their faces set\nthat way. Some who have come to Battle Creek held offices in the\nlittle churches from which they moved, and their help and strength\nwere needed there. When such arrive at Battle Creek, and meet with\nthe numerous Sabbathkeepers there, they frequently feel that their\ntestimonies are not needed, and their talent is therefore buried.\nSome choose Battle Creek because of the religious privileges\nit affords, yet wonder that their spirituality decreases after their\nsojourn there a few months. Is there not a cause? The object of\nmany has been to advantage themselves pecuniarily\u2014to engage in\nbusiness which will yield them greater profits. Their expectations in\nthis particular may be realized, while they have dearth of soul and\nbecome dwarfed in spiritual things. They take no special burden\nupon themselves because they think they would be out of place.\nThey do not know where to take hold to labor in so large a church,\nand therefore become idlers in their Master\u2019s vineyard. All who\n106\nMoving to Battle Creek 107\npursue this course only increase the labor of those who have the\nburden of the work in the church. They are as so many dead weights.\nThere are many in Battle Creek who are fast becoming withered\nbranches.\nSome who have been workers, and who have an experience in the\ncause of present truth, move to Battle Creek and lay off their burden.\nInstead of feeling the necessity of double energy, watchfulness, [115]\nprayer, and diligent performance of duty, they do scarcely anything\nat all. Those who have burdens to bear in the office, and have not\ntime for duties aside from their work, are obliged to fill responsible\npositions in the church and to perform important, taxing labor which\nif they do not do will remain undone because these others will not\ntake the burden.\nBrethren who wish to change their location, who have the glory\nof God in view, and feel that individual responsibility rests upon\nthem to do others good, to benefit and save souls for whom Christ\nwithheld not His precious life, should move into towns and villages\nwhere there is but little or no light and where they can be of real\nservice and bless others with their labor and experience. Missionaries\nare wanted to go into towns and villages and raise the standard of\ntruth, that God may have His witnesses scattered all over the land,\nthat the light of truth may penetrate where it has not yet reached,\nand the standard of truth be raised where it is not yet known. The\nbrethren should not flock together because it is more agreeable to\nthem, but should seek to fulfill their high calling to do others good,\nto be instrumental in the salvation of at least one soul. But more\nmay be saved than one.\nThe sole object of this work should not be merely to increase our\nreward in heaven. Some are selfish in this respect. In view of what\nChrist has done for us, and what He has suffered for sinners, we\nshould, out of pure, disinterested love for souls, imitate His example\nby sacrificing our own pleasure and convenience for their good. The\njoy set before Christ, which sustained Him in all His sufferings, was\nthe salvation of poor sinners. This should be our joy and the spur\nof our ambition in the cause of our Master. In so doing we please\nGod and manifest our love and devotion to Him as His servants.\nHe first loved us, and withheld not from us His beloved Son, but\ngave Him from His bosom to die that we might have life. Love, true [116]\n108 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nlove for our fellow men, evinces love to God. We may make a high\nprofession, yet without this love it is nothing. Our faith may lead\nus to even give our bodies to be burned, yet without self-sacrificing\nlove, such as lived in the bosom of Jesus and was exemplified in His\nlife, we are as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.\nThere are families that receive spiritual strength by moving to\nBattle Creek. It is just the place to help some, while it is the wrong\nplace for others. Brother and Sister A are a sample of the class who\nmay be benefited in moving to this place. The Lord directed them\nto take this course. Battle Creek was just the place to benefit them,\nand has proved a blessing to the entire family. They have, in coming\nhere, gained strength to plant their feet firmly upon the platform of\ntruth, and if they continue in the path of humble obedience they may\nrejoice for the help they have received in Battle Creek.\n* * * * *\nChapter 15\u2014Caution to Ministers\nIn the vision given me June 12, 1868, I was deeply impressed\nwith the great work to be accomplished to prepare a people for the\ncoming of the Son of man. I saw that the harvest is great, but the\nlaborers are few. Many who are at the present time in the field,\nlaboring to save souls, are feeble. They have borne heavy burdens,\nwhich have tried and worn them. Yet, I was shown that with some\nof our ministers there has been too great an expenditure of strength\nwhich was not actually required. Some pray too long and too loud,\nwhich greatly exhausts their feeble strength and needlessly expends\ntheir vitality; others frequently make their discourses one third or one\nhalf longer than they should. In so doing they become excessively [117]\nweary, the interest of the people decreases before the discourse\ncloses, and much is lost to them, for they cannot retain it. One\nhalf that was said would have been better than more. Although all\nthe matter may be important, the success would be much greater\nwere the praying and talking less lengthy. The result would be\nreached without so great weariness. They are needlessly using up\ntheir strength and vitality, which, for the good of the cause, it is so\nnecessary to retain. It is the long-protracted effort, after laboring to\nthe point of weariness, which wears and breaks.\nI saw that it was this extra labor, when the system was exhausted,\nthat consumed the life of dear Brother Sperry and brought him pre-\nmaturely to the grave. Had he worked with reference to health he\nmight have lived to labor until the present time. It was, also, this\nextra labor that exhausted the life force of our dear Brother Cranson\nand caused his life of usefulness to be extinguished.\nMuch singing, as well as protracted praying and talking, is ex-\ntremely wearing. In most cases our ministers should not continue\ntheir efforts longer than one hour. They should leave preliminaries\nand come to the subject at once, and should study to close the dis-\ncourse while the interest is the greatest. They should not continue\nthe effort until their hearers desire them to cease speaking. Much\n109\n110 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nof this extra labor is lost upon the people, who are often too weary\nto be benefited by what they may hear; and who can tell how great\nis the loss sustained by the ministers who thus labor? In the end\nnothing is gained by this draft upon the vitality.\nFrequently the strength is exhausted at the commencement of\na protracted effort. And at the very time when there is much to be\ngained or lost, the devoted minister of Christ, who has an interest,\na will to labor, cannot command the strength. He has used it up in\nsinging, in lengthy prayers and protracted preaching, and the victory[118]\nis lost for want of earnest, well-directed labor at the right time. The\ngolden moment is lost. The impressions made were not followed\nup. It would have been better had no interest been awakened; for\nwhen convictions have been once resisted and overcome, it is very\ndifficult to impress the mind again with the truth.\nI was shown that if our ministers would exercise care to preserve\ntheir strength, instead of needlessly expending it, their judicious,\nwell-directed labor would accomplish more in a year than could\nbe accomplished by long talking, praying, and singing, which are\nso wearisome and exhausting. In the latter case, the people are\nfrequently deprived of labor which they much need at the right time,\nfor the laborer is in need of rest and will endanger his health and life\nif he continues his effort.\nOur dear Brethren Matteson and D. T. Bourdeau have made\na mistake here, and should reform in their manner of labor. They\nshould speak short and pray short. They should come to the point\nat once and stop short of exhaustion in their labors. They can both\naccomplish more good by doing this, and at the same time preserve\nstrength to continue the labors which they love, without breaking\ndown entirely.\n* * * * *\nChapter 16\u2014Look to Jesus\nIn the vision given me June 12, 1868, I was shown the danger\nof the people of God in looking to Brother and Sister White and\nthinking that they must come to them with their burdens and seek\ncounsel of them. This ought not so to be. They are invited by their\ncompassionate, loving Saviour to come unto Him, when weary and\nheavy-laden, and He will relieve them. In Him they will find rest.\nIn taking their perplexities and trials to Jesus, they will find the\npromise in regard to them fulfilled. When in their distress they feel [119]\nthe relief which is found alone in Jesus they obtain an experience\nwhich is of the highest value to them. Brother and Sister White are\nstriving for purity of life, striving to bring forth fruit unto holiness;\nyet they are only erring mortals. Many come to us with the inquiry:\nShall I do this? Shall I engage in that enterprise? Or, in regard to\ndress, Shall I wear this or that article? I answer them: You profess\nto be disciples of Christ. Study your Bibles. Read carefully and\nprayerfully the life of our dear Saviour when He dwelt among men\nupon the earth. Imitate His life, and you will not be found straying\nfrom the narrow path. We utterly refuse to be conscience for you. If\nwe tell you just what to do, you will look to us to guide you, instead\nof going directly to Jesus for yourselves. Your experience will be\nfounded in us. You must have an experience for yourselves, which\nshall be founded in God. Then can you stand amid the perils of the\nlast days and be purified and not consumed by the fire of affliction\nthrough which all the saints must pass in order to have the impurities\nremoved from their character preparatory to receiving the finishing\ntouch of immortality.\nMany of our dear brethren and sisters think that they cannot have\na large gathering unless Brother and Sister White attend. In many\nplaces they realize that something must be done to move the people\nto more earnestness and decided action in the work and cause of\ntruth. They have had ministers to labor among them, yet they realize\nthat a greater work must be done, and look to Brother and Sister\n111\n112 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nWhite to do it. This, I saw, was not as God would have it. In the\nfirst place, there is a deficiency with some of our ministers. They\nlack thoroughness. They do not take on the burden of the work\nand reach out to lift just where the people need help. They do not\npossess discernment to see and feel just where the people need to be\ncorrected, reproved, built up, and strengthened. Some of them labor[120]\nweeks and months in a place, and there is actually more to do when\nthey leave than when they commenced. Systematic benevolence is\ndragging. It is one part of the minister\u2019s labor to keep up this branch\nof the work; but, because this is not agreeable, some neglect their\nduty. They talk the truth from the word of God, but do not impress\nthe people with the necessity of obedience. Therefore many are\nhearers, but not doers. The people feel the deficiency. Things are\nnot set in order among them, and they look to Brother and Sister\nWhite to make up the deficiency.\nSome of our ministering brethren have glided along without\nsettling deep into the work and getting hold of the hearts of the\npeople. They have excused themselves with the thought that Brother\nand Sister White would bring up the things that were lacking; that\nthey were specially adapted to the work. These men have labored,\nbut not in the right way. They have not borne the burden. They\nhave not helped where help was needed. They have not corrected\ndeficiencies which needed to be corrected. They have not entered,\nwhole heart, and soul, and energies, into the wants of the people.\nTime has passed, and they have nothing to show for it. The burden of\ntheir deficiencies falls back on us. And they encourage the people to\nlook to us, presenting the idea that nothing will accomplish the work\nbut our special testimony. God is not pleased with this. Ministers\nshould take greater responsibilities and not entertain the thought that\nthey cannot bear that message which will help the people where they\nneed help. If they cannot do this, they should tarry in Jerusalem till\nthey are endowed with power from on high. They should not engage\nin a work which they cannot perform. They should go forth weeping,\nbearing precious seed, and return from their effort rejoicing, bringing\ntheir sheaves with them.\nMinisters should impress upon the people the necessity of\nindividual effort. No church can flourish unless its members are[121]\nworkers. The people must lift where the ministers lift. I saw that\nLook to Jesus 113\nnothing lasting can be accomplished for churches in different places\nunless they are aroused to feel that a responsibility rests upon them.\nEvery member of the body should feel that the salvation of his own\nsoul depends upon his own individual effort. Souls cannot be saved\nwithout exertion. The minister cannot save the people. He can be a\nchannel through which God will impart light to His people; but after\nthe light is given, it is left with the people to appropriate that light,\nand, in their turn, let it shine forth to others. The people should feel\nthat an individual responsibility rests upon them, not only to save\ntheir own souls, but to earnestly engage in the salvation of those who\nremain in darkness. Instead of looking to Brother and Sister White\nto help them out of their darkness, they should be earnestly engaged\nin helping themselves. If they should begin to hunt up those worse\noff than themselves, and should try to help them, they would help\nthemselves into the light sooner than in any other way. If the people\nlean upon Brother and Sister White, and trust in them, God will\nhumble them among you or remove them from you. You must look\nto God and trust in Him. Lean upon Him, and He will not forsake\nyou. He will not leave you to perish. Precious is the word of God.\n\u201cSearch the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life.\u201d\nThese are the words of Christ. The words of inspiration, carefully\nand prayerfully studied and practically obeyed, will thoroughly fur-\nnish you unto all good works. Ministers and people must look to\nGod.\nWe are living in an evil age. The perils of the last days thicken\naround us. Because iniquity abounds, the love of many waxes cold.\nEnoch walked with God three hundred years. Now the shortness of\ntime seems to be urged as a motive to seek righteousness. Should\nit be necessary that the terrors of the day of God be held before us [122]\nin order to compel us to right action? Enoch\u2019s case is before us.\nHundreds of years he walked with God. He lived in a corrupt age,\nwhen moral pollution was teeming all around him; yet he trained\nhis mind to devotion, to love purity. His conversation was upon\nheavenly things. He educated his mind to run in this channel, and he\nbore the impress of the divine. His countenance was lighted up with\nthe light which shineth in the face of Jesus. Enoch had temptations\nas well as we. He was surrounded with society no more friendly to\nrighteousness than is that which surrounds us. The atmosphere he\n114 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nbreathed was tainted with sin and corruption, the same as ours; yet he\nlived a life of holiness. He was unsullied with the prevailing sins of\nthe age in which he lived. So may we remain pure and uncorrupted.\nHe was a representative of the saints who live amid the perils and\ncorruptions of the last days. For his faithful obedience to God he\nwas translated. So, also, the faithful, who are alive and remain, will\nbe translated. They will be removed from a sinful and corrupt world\nto the pure joys of heaven.\nThe course of God\u2019s people should be upward and onward to\nvictory. A greater than Joshua is leading on the armies of Israel.\nOne is in our midst, even the Captain of our salvation, who has said\nfor our encouragement: \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end\nof the world.\u201d \u201cBe of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d He\nwill lead us on to certain victory. What God promises, He is able at\nany time to perform. And the work He gives His people to do, He is\nable to accomplish by them. If we live a life of perfect obedience,\nHis promises will be fulfilled toward us.\nGod requires His people to shine as lights in the world. It is not\nmerely the ministers who are required to do this, but every disciple\nof Christ. Their conversation should be heavenly. And while they[123]\nenjoy communion with God they will wish to have intercourse with\ntheir fellow men in order to express by their words and acts the love\nof God which animates their hearts. In this way they will be lights in\nthe world, and the light transmitted through them will not go out or\nbe taken away. It will indeed become darkness to those who will not\nwalk in it, but it will shine with increasing brightness on the path of\nthose who will obey and walk in the light.\nThe spirit, wisdom, and goodness of God, revealed in His word,\nare to be exemplified by the disciples of Christ, and are thus to\ncondemn the world. God requires of His people according to the\ngrace and truth given them. All His righteous demands must be fully\nmet. Accountable beings must walk in the light that shines upon\nthem. If they fail to do this, their light becomes darkness, and their\ndarkness is great in the same degree as their light was abundant.\nAccumulated light has shone upon God\u2019s people; but many have\nneglected to follow the light, and for this reason they are in a state\nof great spiritual weakness.\nLook to Jesus 115\nIt is not for lack of knowledge that God\u2019s people are now perish-\ning. They will not be condemned because they do not know the way,\nthe truth, and the life. The truth that has reached their understanding,\nthe light which has shone on the soul, but which has been neglected\nor refused, will condemn them. Those who never had the light to\nreject will not be in condemnation. What more could have been\ndone for God\u2019s vineyard than has been done? Light, precious light,\nshines upon God\u2019s people; but it will not save them unless they con-\nsent to be saved by it, fully live up to it, and transmit it to others in\ndarkness. God calls upon His people to act. It is an individual work\nof confessing and forsaking sins and returning unto the Lord that is\nneeded. One cannot do this work for another. Religious knowledge\nhas accumulated, and this has increased corresponding obligations. [124]\nGreat light has been shining upon the church, and by it they are\ncondemned because they refuse to walk in it. If they were blind\nthey would be without sin. But they have seen light and have heard\nmuch truth, yet are not wise and holy. Many have for years made\nno advancement in knowledge and true holiness. They are spiritual\ndwarfs. Instead of going forward to perfection, they are going back\nto the darkness and bondage of Egypt. Their minds are not exercised\nunto godliness and true holiness.\nWill the Israel of God awake? Will all who profess godliness\nseek to put away every wrong, to confess to God every secret sin, and\nafflict the soul before Him? Will they, with great humility, investigate\nthe motives of every action, and know that the eye of God reads\nall, searches out every hidden thing? Let the work be thorough, the\nconsecration to God entire. He calls for a full surrender of all that\nwe have and are. Ministers and people need a new conversion, a\ntransformation of the mind, without which we are not savors of life\nunto life, but of death unto death. Great privileges belong to the\npeople of God. Great light has been given them, that they may attain\nto their high calling in Christ Jesus; yet they are not what God would\nhave them to be and what He designs they shall be.\n* * * * *\nChapter 17\u2014Separation From the World\nDear Brethren and Sisters,\nGod designed that the light of the church should increase and\ngrow brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. Precious promises\nare made to God\u2019s people upon condition of obedience. If, like\nCaleb and Joshua, you had wholly followed the Lord, He would\nhave magnified His power in your midst. Sinners would have been\nconverted, and backsliders reclaimed, by your influence; and even[125]\nthe enemies of our faith, although they might oppose and speak\nagainst the truth, could but admit that God was with you.\nMany of the professed, peculiar people of God are so conformed\nto the world that their peculiar character is not discerned, and it is\ndifficult to distinguish \u201cbetween him that serveth God and him that\nserveth Him not.\u201d God would do great things for His people if they\nwould come out from the world and be separate. If they would submit\nto be led by Him, He would make them a praise in all the earth. Says\nthe True Witness: \u201cI know thy works.\u201d Angels of God who minister\nunto those who shall be heirs of salvation are acquainted with the\ncondition of all and understand just the measure of faith possessed by\neach individual. The unbelief, pride, covetousness, and love of the\nworld, which have existed in the hearts of God\u2019s professed people,\nhave grieved the sinless angels. As they have seen that grievous and\npresumptuous sins exist in the hearts of many professed followers\nof Christ, and that God has been dishonored by their inconsistent,\ncrooked course, they have been caused to weep. And yet those most\nat fault, those who cause the greatest feebleness in the church and\nbring a stain upon their holy profession, do not seem to be alarmed\nor convicted, but seem to feel that they are flourishing in the Lord.\nMany believe that they are on the right foundation, that they\nhave the truth; they rejoice in its clearness and boast of the powerful\narguments in proof of the correctness of our position. Such reckon\nthemselves among the chosen, peculiar people of God, yet they\nexperience not His presence and power to save them from yielding\n116\nSeparation From the World 117\nto temptation and folly. These profess to know God, yet in works\ndeny Him. How great is their darkness! The love of the world with\nmany, the deceitfulness of riches with others, have choked the word, [126]\nand they have become unfruitful.\nI was shown that the church at ----- have partaken of the spirit of\nthe world and become lukewarm to an alarming extent. When efforts\nare made to set things in order in the church and bring the people\nup to the position God would have them occupy, a class will be\naffected by the labor, and will make earnest efforts to press through\nthe darkness to the light. But many do not persevere in their efforts\nlong enough to realize the sanctifying influence of the truth upon\ntheir hearts and lives. The cares of the world engross the mind to\nthat degree that self-examination and secret prayer are neglected.\nThe armor is laid off and Satan has free access to them, benumbing\ntheir sensibilities and causing them to be unsuspicious of his wiles.\nSome do not manifest a desire to know their true state and es-\ncape from Satan\u2019s snares. They are sickly and dying. They are\noccasionally warmed by the fire of others, yet are so nearly chilled\nby formality, pride, and the influence of the world that they have no\nsense of their need of help.\nThere are many who are deficient in spirituality and the Christian\ngraces. A weight of solemn responsibility should daily rest upon\nthem as they view the perilous times in which we live and the\ncorrupting influences which are teeming around us. Their only hope\nof being partakers of the divine nature is to escape the corruption that\nis in the world. These brethren need a deep and thorough experience\nin the things of God, and this can only be obtained by an effort on\ntheir part. Their position requires them to possess earnestness and\nunabated diligence, so as not to be found sleeping at their post. Satan\nand his angels sleep not.\nChrist\u2019s followers should be instruments of righteousness, work-\nmen, living stones, emitting light, that they may encourage the\npresence of heavenly angels. They are required to be channels, as [127]\nit were, through which the spirit of truth and righteousness shall\nflow. Many have partaken so largely of the spirit and influence of\nthe world that they act like the world. They have their likes and dis-\nlikes, and discern not excellence of character. Their conduct is not\ngoverned by the pure principles of Christianity; therefore they think\n118 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nonly of themselves, their pleasure and enjoyment, to the disregard\nof others. They are not sanctified through the truth, therefore realize\nnot the oneness of Christ\u2019s followers the world over. Those who are\nmost loved of God are those who possess the least self-confidence\nand are adorned with a meek and quiet spirit; whose lives are pure\nand unselfish, and whose hearts are inclined, through the abundant\nmeasure of the spirit of Christ, to obedience, justice, purity, and true\nholiness.\nIf all were devoted to God, a precious light would shine forth\nfrom them, which would have a direct influence upon all who are\nbrought in contact with them. But all need a work done for them.\nSome are far from God, variable and unstable as water; they have\nno idea of sacrifice. When they desire any special indulgence or\npleasure, or any article of dress, they do not consider whether or not\nthey can do without the article, or deny themselves the pleasure, and\nmake a freewill offering to God. How many have considered that\nthey were required to make some sacrifice? Although it may be of\nless value than that of the wealthy man who possesses his thousands,\nyet that which really costs self-denial would be a precious sacrifice,\nan offering to God. It would be a sweet-smelling savor, and come\nup from his altar like sweet incense.\nThe youth are not authorized to do just as they please with their\nmeans, regardless of the requirements of God. With David they\nshould say: \u201cNeither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my\nGod of that which doth cost me nothing.\u201d Quite an amount of means\nhas been expended to multiply copies of their pictures. Could all\nenumerate the amount given to the artist for this purpose, it would[128]\nswell to quite a large sum. And this is merely one way in which\nmeans is squandered, invested for self-gratification, from which no\nprofit is received. By this outlay, they are not clothed or fed, the\nwidow and the fatherless are not relieved, the hungry are not fed, the\nnaked are not clothed.\nWhile money is spent lavishly in self-gratification, stinted offer-\nings are brought to God almost unwillingly. How much of the wages\nearned by the young finds its way into the treasury of God to aid in\nthe advancement of the work of saving souls? They give a mite each\nweek and feel that they do much. But they have no sense that they\nare just as much stewards of God over their little as are the wealthy\nSeparation From the World 119\nover their larger possessions. God has been robbed and themselves\nindulged, their pleasure consulted, their taste gratified, without a\nthought that He would make close investigation of how they have\nused His goods. While such unhesitatingly gratify their supposed\nwants and withhold from God the offering they ought to make, He\nwill no more accept the little pittance they hand into the treasury\nthan He accepted the offering of Ananias and his wife Sapphira, who\npurposed to rob Him in their offerings.\nAs a general thing, the young among us are allied to the world.\nBut few maintain a special warfare against the internal foe, few have\nan earnest, anxious desire to know and do the will of God. But few\nhunger and thirst after righteousness, and few know anything of the\nSpirit of God as a reprover or comforter. Where are the missionaries?\nWhere are the self-denying, self-sacrificing ones? Where are the\ncross bearers? Self and self-interest have swallowed up high and\nnoble principles. Things of eternal moment bear with no special\nweight upon the mind. God requires them individually to come up\nto the point to make an entire surrender. \u201cYe cannot serve God and [129]\nmammon.\u201d You cannot serve self and at the same time be servants of\nChrist. You must die to self, die to your love of pleasure, and learn\nto inquire: Will God be pleased with the objects for which I purpose\nto spend this means? Shall I glorify Him?\nWe are commanded, whether we eat, or drink, or whatsoever we\ndo, to do all to the glory of God. How many have conscientiously\nmoved from principle rather than from impulse, and obeyed this\ncommand to the letter? How many of the youthful disciples in -----\nhave made God their trust and portion, and have earnestly sought to\nknow and do His will? There are many who are servants of Christ in\nname, but who are not so in deed. Where religious principle governs,\nthe danger of committing great errors is small; for selfishness, which\nalways blinds and deceives, is subordinate. The sincere desire to\ndo others good so predominates that self is forgotten. To have\nfirm religious principles is an inestimable treasure. It is the purest,\nhighest, and most elevated influence mortals can possess. Such have\nan anchor. Every act is well considered, lest its effect be injurious\nto another and lead away from Christ. The constant inquiry of the\nmind is: Lord, how shall I best serve Thee, and glorify Thy name in\nthe earth? How shall I conduct my life to make Thy name a praise\n120 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nin the earth, and lead others to love, serve, and honor Thee? Let me\nonly desire and choose Thy will. Let the words and example of my\nRedeemer be the light and strength of my heart. While I follow and\ntrust in Him, He will not leave me to perish. He will be my crown\nof rejoicing.\nIf we mistake the wisdom of man for the wisdom of God we are\nled astray by the foolishness of man\u2019s wisdom. Here is the great\ndanger of many in -----. They have not an experience for them-\nselves. They have not been in the habit of prayerfully considering\nfor themselves, with unprejudiced, unbiased judgment, questions[130]\nand subjects that are new and that are ever liable to arise. They\nwait to see what others will think. If these dissent, that is all that is\nneeded to convince them that the subject under consideration is of\nno account whatever. Although this class is large, it does not change\nthe fact that they are inexperienced and weak-minded through long\nyielding to the enemy, and will always be as sickly as babes, walk-\ning by others\u2019 light, living on others\u2019 experience, feeling as others\nfeel, and acting as others act. They act as though they had not an\nindividuality. Their identity is submerged in others; they are merely\nshadows of those whom they think about right. Unless these become\nsensible of their wavering character and correct it, they will all fail\nof everlasting life; they will be unable to cope with the perils of the\nlast days. They will possess no stamina to resist the devil, for they\ndo not know that it is he. Someone must be at their side to inform\nthem whether a foe or a friend is approaching. They are not spiritual,\ntherefore spiritual things are not discerned. They are not wise in\nthose things which relate to the kingdom of God. Neither young\nnor old are excusable in trusting to another to have an experience\nfor them. Said the angel: \u201cCursed be the man that trusteth in man,\nand maketh flesh his arm.\u201d A noble self-reliance is needed in the\nChristian experience and warfare.\nMen, women, and youth, God requires you to possess moral\ncourage, steadiness of purpose, fortitude and perseverance, minds\nthat cannot take the assertions of another, but which will investigate\nfor themselves before receiving or rejecting, that will study and\nweigh evidence, and take it to the Lord in prayer. \u201cIf any of you\nlack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and\nupbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\u201d Now the condition: \u201cBut\nSeparation From the World 121\nlet him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like\na wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that [131]\nman think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.\u201d This petition\nfor wisdom is not to be a meaningless prayer, out of mind as soon\nas finished. It is a prayer that expresses the strong, earnest desire of\nthe heart, arising from a conscious lack of wisdom to determine the\nwill of God.\nAfter the prayer is made, if the answer is not realized immedi-\nately, do not weary of waiting and become unstable. Waver not.\nCling to the promise, \u201cFaithful is He that calleth you, who also will\ndo it.\u201d Like the importunate widow, urge your case, being firm in\nyour purpose. Is the object important and of great consequence to\nyou? It certainly is. Then waver not, for your faith may be tried.\nIf the thing you desire is valuable, it is worthy of a strong, earnest\neffort. You have the promise; watch and pray. Be steadfast and the\nprayer will be answered; for is it not God who has promised? If it\ncosts you something to obtain it you will prize it the more when\nobtained. You are plainly told that if you waver you need not think\nthat you shall receive anything of the Lord. A caution is here given\nnot to become weary, but to rest firmly upon the promise. If you ask,\nHe will give you liberally and upbraid not.\nHere is where many make a mistake. They waver from their\npurpose, and their faith fails. This is the reason they receive nothing\nof the Lord, who is our Source of strength. None need go in darkness,\nstumbling along like a blind man; for the Lord has provided light if\nthey will accept it in His appointed way, and not choose their own\nway. He requires of all a diligent performance of everyday duties.\nEspecially is this required of all who are engaged in the solemn,\nimportant work in the office of publication, both of those upon whom\nrest the more weighty responsibilities of the work, and of those who\nbear the least responsibilities. This can be done only by looking to [132]\nGod for ability to enable them faithfully to perform what is right in\nthe sight of Heaven, doing all things as though governed by unselfish\nmotives, as if the eye of God were visible to all, looking upon all,\nand investigating the acts of all.\nThe sin which is indulged to the greatest extent, and which\nseparates us from God and produces so many contagious spiritual\ndisorders, is selfishness. There can be no returning to the Lord\n122 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nexcept by self-denial. Of ourselves we can do nothing; but, through\nGod strengthening us, we can live to do good to others, and in this\nway shun the evil of selfishness. We need not go to heathen lands to\nmanifest our desire to devote all to God in a useful, unselfish life.\nWe should do this in the home circle, in the church, among those\nwith whom we associate and with whom we do business. Right in\nthe common walks of life is where self is to be denied and kept in\nsubordination. Paul could say: \u201cI die daily.\u201d It is the daily dying to\nself in the little transactions of life that makes us overcomers. We\nshould forget self in the desire to do good to others. With many there\nis a decided lack of love for others. Instead of faithfully performing\ntheir duty, they seek rather their own pleasure.\nGod positively enjoins upon all His followers a duty to bless\nothers with their influence and means, and to seek that wisdom of\nHim which will enable them to do all in their power to elevate the\nthoughts and affections of those who come within their influence. In\ndoing for others, a sweet satisfaction will be experienced, an inward\npeace which will be a sufficient reward. When actuated by a high\nand noble desire to do others good, they will find true happiness in\na faithful discharge of life\u2019s manifold duties. This will bring more\nthan an earthly reward; for every faithful, unselfish performance of\nduty is noticed by the angels and shines in the life record. In heaven\nnone will think of self, nor seek their own pleasure; but all, from[133]\npure, genuine love, will seek the happiness of the heavenly beings\naround them. If we wish to enjoy heavenly society in the earth made\nnew, we must be governed by heavenly principles here.\nEvery act of our lives affects others for good or evil. Our influ-\nence is tending upward or downward; it is felt, acted upon, and to a\ngreater or less degree reproduced by others. If by our example we aid\nothers in the development of good principles, we give them power\nto do good. In their turn they exert the same beneficial influence\nupon others, and thus hundreds and thousands are affected by our\nunconscious influence. If we by acts strengthen or force into activity\nthe evil powers possessed by those around us, we share their sin,\nand will have to render an account for the good we might have done\nthem and did not do, because we made not God our strength, our\nguide, our counselor.\nSeparation From the World 123\n* * * * *\nChapter 18\u2014True Love\nTrue love is not a strong, fiery, impetuous passion. On the con-\ntrary, it is calm and deep in its nature. It looks beyond mere externals\nand is attracted by qualities alone. It is wise and discriminating, and\nits devotion is real and abiding. God tests and proves us by the\ncommon occurrences of life. It is the little things which reveal the\nchapters of the heart. It is the little attentions, the numerous small\nincidents and simple courtesies of life, that make up the sum of life\u2019s\nhappiness; and it is the neglect of kindly, encouraging, affectionate\nwords, and the little courtesies of life, which helps compose the sum\nof life\u2019s wretchedness. It will be found at last that the denial of self\nfor the good and happiness of those around us constitutes a large\nshare of the life record in heaven. And the fact will also be revealed\nthat the care of self, irrespective of the good and happiness of others,[134]\nis not beneath the notice of our heavenly Father.\nBrother B, the Lord is working for you, and will bless and\nstrengthen you in the course of right. You understand the theory of\ntruth, and should be obtaining all the knowledge you can of God\u2019s\nwill and work, that you may be prepared to fill a more responsible\nposition if He, seeing you can glorify His name best in so doing,\nshould require it of you. But you have yet an experience to gain.\nYou are too impulsive, too easily affected by circumstances. God is\nwilling to strengthen, stablish, settle you, if you will earnestly and\nhumbly seek wisdom of Him who is unerring, and who has promised\nthat you shall not seek in vain.\nIn teaching the truth to others, you are in danger of talking too\nstrong, in a manner not in keeping with your short experience. You\ntake in things at a glance, and can see the bearing of subjects readily.\nAll are not organized as you are, and cannot do this. You will not\nbe prepared to patiently, calmly wait for those to weigh evidence\nwho cannot see as readily as you do. You will be in danger of urging\nothers too much to see at once as you see and feel all that zeal\nand necessity of action that you feel. If your expectations are not\n124\nTrue Love 125\nrealized, you will be in danger of becoming discouraged and restless,\nand wishing a change. You must shun a disposition to censure, to\nbear down. Keep clear of everything that savors of a denunciatory\nspirit. It is not pleasing to God for this spirit to be found in any of\nHis servants of long experience. It is proper for a youth, if graced\nwith humility and the inward adorning, to manifest ardor and zeal;\nbut when a rash zeal and a denunciatory spirit are manifested by a\nyouth who has but a few years of experience, it is most unbecoming\nand positively disgusting. Nothing can destroy his influence as soon\nas this. Mildness, gentleness, forbearance, long-suffering, being not [135]\neasily provoked, bearing all things, hoping all things, enduring all\nthings\u2014these are the fruit growing upon the precious tree of love,\nwhich is of heavenly growth. This tree, if nourished, will prove to be\nan evergreen. Its branches will not decay, its leaves will not wither.\nIt is immortal, eternal, watered continually by the dews of heaven.\nLove is power. Intellectual and moral strength are involved in\nthis principle, and cannot be separated from it. The power of wealth\nhas a tendency to corrupt and destroy; the power of force is strong\nto do hurt; but the excellence and value of pure love consist in its\nefficiency to do good, and to do nothing else than good. Whatsoever\nis done out of pure love, be it ever so little or contemptible in the\nsight of men, is wholly fruitful; for God regards more with how much\nlove one worketh than the amount he doeth. Love is of God. The\nunconverted heart cannot originate nor produce this plant of heavenly\ngrowth, which lives and flourishes only where Christ reigns.\nLove cannot live without action, and every act increases,\nstrengthens, and extends it. Love will gain the victory when ar-\ngument and authority are powerless. Love works not for profit nor\nreward; yet God has ordained that great gain shall be the certain\nresult of every labor of love. It is diffusive in its nature and quiet in\nits operation, yet strong and mighty in its purpose to overcome great\nevils. It is melting and transforming in its influence, and will take\nhold of the lives of the sinful and affect their hearts when every other\nmeans has proved unsuccessful. Wherever the power of intellect, of\nauthority, or of force is employed, and love is not manifestly present,\nthe affections and will of those whom we seek to reach assume a\ndefensive, repelling position, and their strength of resistance is in-\ncreased. Jesus was the Prince of Peace. He came into the world to\n126 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nbring resistance and authority into subjection to Himself. Wisdom\nand strength He could command, but the means He employed with[136]\nwhich to overcome evil were the wisdom and strength of love. Suffer\nnothing to divide your interest from your present work until God\nshall see fit to give you another piece of work in the same field.\nSeek not for happiness, for it is never to be found by seeking for it.\nGo about your duty. Let faithfulness mark all your doings, and be\nclothed with humility.\n\u201cWhatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even\nso to them.\u201d Blessed results would appear as the fruit of such a\ncourse. \u201cWith what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you\nagain.\u201d Here are strong motives which should constrain us to love\none another with a pure heart, fervently. Christ is our example. He\nwent about doing good. He lived to bless others. Love beautified and\nennobled all His actions. We are not commanded to do to ourselves\nwhat we wish others to do unto us; we are to do unto others what\nwe wish them to do to us under like circumstances. The measure\nwe mete is always measured to us again. Pure love is simple in\nits operations, and is distinct from any other principle of action.\nThe love of influence and the desire for the esteem of others may\nproduce a well-ordered life and frequently a blameless conversation.\nSelf-respect may lead us to avoid the appearance of evil. A selfish\nheart may perform generous actions, acknowledge the present truth,\nand express humility and affection in an outward manner, yet the\nmotives may be deceptive and impure; the actions that flow from\nsuch a heart may be destitute of the savor of life and the fruits of\ntrue holiness, being destitute of the principles of pure love. Love\nshould be cherished and cultivated, for its influence is divine.\nChapter 19\u2014Amusements at the Institute [137]\nWhen the amusements were introduced into the Institute, some in\n----- manifested their superficial character. They were well pleased\nand gratified; their frivolous turn of mind was just suited. The\nthings recommended for invalids they thought good for themselves;\nand Dr. C is not accountable for all the results accruing from the\ncounsel given to his patients. Those in different churches abroad,\nwho were unconsecrated, seized upon the first semblance of an\nexcuse to engage in pleasure, hilarity, and folly. As soon as it was\nknown that the physicians at the Institute had recommended plays\nand amusements in order to divert the minds of the patients from\nthemselves into a more cheerful train of thought, it went like fire\nin the stubble; the young in ----- and other churches thought that\nthey had need of just such things, and the armor of righteousness\nwas laid off by many. As they were no longer held in by bit and\nbridle, they engaged in these things with as much earnestness and\nperseverance as though everlasting life depended upon their zeal\nin this direction. Here was an opportunity to discern between the\nconscientious followers of Christ and those who were self-deceived.\nSome had not the cause of God at heart. They had not the work\nof true holiness wrought in the soul. They had failed to make God\ntheir trust, and were unstable, and only needed a wave to raise them\nfrom their feet and toss them to and fro. Such showed that they\npossessed but little stability and moral independence. They had not\nan experience for themselves, and therefore walked in the sparks of\nothers\u2019 kindling. They had not Christ in their hearts to confess to the\nworld. They professed to be His followers, but earthly and temporal [138]\nthings held their frivolous, selfish hearts in subjection.\nThere were others who did not seem to possess anxiety in regard\nto the amusement question. They felt such confidence that God\nwould make all right that their peace of mind was not disturbed. They\ndecided that a prescription for invalids was not for them, therefore\nthey would not be troubled. Whatever others in the church or in the\n127\n128 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nworld might do was nothing to them; for, said they, whom have we\nto follow but Christ? He has left us a command to walk even as He\nwalked. We must live as seeing Him who is invisible, and do what\nwe do heartily, as to the Lord and not unto men.\nWhen such things arise, character is developed. Moral worth\ncan then be truly estimated. It is not difficult to ascertain where\nthose are to be found who profess godliness, yet have their pleasure\nand happiness in this world. Their affections are not upon things\nabove, but upon things on the earth, where Satan reigns. They walk\nin darkness, and cannot love and enjoy heavenly things because they\ncannot discern them. They are alienated from the life of Christ,\nhaving their understanding darkened. The things of the Spirit are\nfoolishness unto them. Their pursuits are according to the course\nof this world, and their interests and prospects are joined with the\nworld and with earthly things. If such can pass along bearing the\nname of Christians, yet serving both God and mammon, they are\nsatisfied. But things will occur to reveal the hearts of these, who are\nonly a burden and a curse to the church.\nThe spirit existing in the church is such as to lead away from\nGod and the path of holiness. Many of the church have ascribed\ntheir state of spiritual blindness to the influence growing out of the\nprinciples taught at the Institute. This is not entirely correct. Had\nthe church stood in the counsel of God, the Institute would have\nbeen controlled. The light of the church would have been diffused\nto that branch of the work, and the errors would not have existed[139]\nthere that did. It was the moral darkness of the church that had the\ngreatest influence to create the moral darkness and spiritual death in\nthe Institute. Had the church been in a healthy condition, she could\nhave sent a vitalizing, healthful current to this arm of the body. But\nthe church was sickly and did not enjoy the favor of God nor the light\nof His countenance. A sickly, deathly influence was circulated all\nthrough the living body until the disease was apparent everywhere.\nDear Brother D has not understood the condition of his own\nheart. Selfishness has found a lodgment there, and peace, healthful,\ncalm peace, has departed. What you all lack is the element of love\u2014\nlove to God and love to your neighbor. The life that you now live\nyou do not live by faith in the Son of God. There is a lack of firm\ntrust, a fearfulness to resign all into the hands of God, as though He\nAmusements at the Institute 129\ncould not keep that which is committed to His trust. You are afraid\nsome evil is designed which will do you harm unless you assume the\ndefensive and commence a warfare in your own favor. The children\nof God are wise and powerful according to their reliance upon His\nwisdom and power. They are strong and happy according to their\nseparation from the wisdom and help of man.\nDaniel and his companions were captives in a strange land, but\nGod suffered not the envy and hatred of their enemies to prevail\nagainst them. The righteous have ever obtained help from above.\nHow often have the enemies of God united their strength and wisdom\nto destroy the character and influence of a few simple persons who\ntrusted in God. But because the Lord was for them, none could\nprevail against them. Only let the followers of Christ be united, and\nthey will prevail. Let them be separated from their idols and from\nthe world, and the world will not separate them from God. Christ is\nour present, all-sufficient Saviour. In Him all fullness dwells. It is [140]\nthe privilege of Christians to know indeed that Christ is in them of a\ntruth. \u201cThis is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.\u201d\nAll things are possible to him that believeth; and whatsoever things\nwe desire when we pray, if we believe that we receive them we shall\nhave them. This faith will penetrate the darkest cloud and bring rays\nof light and hope to the drooping, desponding soul. It is the absence\nof this faith and trust which brings perplexity, distressing fears, and\nsurmisings of evil. God will do great things for His people when\nthey put their entire trust in Him. \u201cGodliness with contentment is\ngreat gain.\u201d Pure and undefiled religion will be exemplified in the\nlife. Christ will prove a never-failing source of strength, a present\nhelp in every time of trouble.\n* * * * *\nChapter 20\u2014Neglect of Hannah More\nIn the case of Sister Hannah More, I was shown that the neglect\nof her was the neglect of Jesus in her person. Had the Son of God\ncome in the humble, unpretending manner in which He journeyed\nfrom place to place when He was upon earth, He would have met\nwith no better reception. It is the deep principle of love that dwelt in\nthe bosom of the humble Man of Calvary that is needed. Had the\nchurch lived in the light, they would have appreciated this humble\nmissionary whose whole being was aglow to be engaged in her\nMaster\u2019s service. Her very earnest interest was misconstrued. Her\nexternals were not just such as would meet the approval of the eye\nof taste and fashion, for familiarity with strict economy and poverty\nhad left its impress upon her apparel. Her hard-earned means had\nbeen exhausted as fast as obtained to benefit others, to get light to[141]\nthose whom she hoped to lead to the cross of truth.\nEven the professed church of Christ, with their exalted privileges\nand high professions, discerned not the image of Christ in this self-\ndenying child of God because they were so far removed from Christ\nthemselves that they reflected not His image. They judged by the\nexternal appearance and took no special pains to discern the inward\nadorning. Here was a woman whose resources of knowledge and\ngenuine experience in the mysteries of godliness exceeded those of\nanyone residing at -----, and whose manner of address to the youth\nand children was pleasing, instructive, and salutary. She was not\nharsh, but correct and sympathetic, and would have proved one of the\nmost useful laborers in the field as an instructor of the youth and an\nintelligent, useful companion and counselor to mothers. She could\nreach hearts by her earnest, matter-of-fact presentation of incidents\nin her religious life, which she had devoted to the service of her\nRedeemer. Had the church emerged from darkness and deception\ninto the clear light, their hearts would have been drawn out after\nthe lonely stranger. Her prayers, her tears, her distress, at seeing no\nway of usefulness open to her, have been seen and heard in heaven.\n130\nNeglect of Hannah More 131\nThe Lord offered to His people talented help; but they were rich and\nincreased with goods, and had need of nothing. They turned from\nand rejected a most precious blessing of which they will yet feel the\nneed. Had Elder E stood in the clear light of God and been imbued\nwith His Spirit when this servant of Jesus, lonely, homeless, and\nthirsting for a work to do for her Master, was brought to his notice,\nspirit would have answered to spirit, as face answereth to face in\na mirror; his heart would have been drawn out after this disciple\nof Christ, and he would have understood her. Thus also with the\nchurch. They had been in such spiritual blindness they had lost the [142]\nsound of the voice of the True Shepherd and were following the\nvoice of a stranger, who was leading them from the fold of Christ.\nMany look upon the great work to be accomplished for God\u2019s\npeople, and their prayers go up to Him for help in the great harvest.\nBut, if help does not come in just the manner they expect, they will\nnot receive it, but turn from it as the Jewish nation turned from Christ\nbecause disappointed in the manner of His appearing. Too much\npoverty and humility marked His advent, and in their pride they\nrefused Him who came to give them life. In this God would have\nthe church humble their hearts and see the great need of correcting\ntheir ways before Him, lest He visit them in judgment. Many who\nprofess godliness make the external adorning far more important\nthan the inward adorning. Had the church all humbled themselves\nbefore the Lord and corrected their past errors so fully as to meet His\nmind, they would not be so deficient in estimating moral excellence\nof character.\nThe light of Sister Hannah More has gone out, whereas it might\nnow be burning brightly to illuminate the pathway of many who are\nwalking in the dark paths of error and rebellion. God calls upon\nthe church to arouse from their slumber and with deep earnestness\ninquire into the cause of this self-deception among professors whose\nnames are on the church book. Satan is deluding and cheating them\nin the great concern of salvation. Nothing is more treacherous than\nthe deceitfulness of sin. It is the god of this world that deludes,\nand blinds, and leads to destruction. Satan does not enter with his\narray of temptations at once. He disguises these temptations with\na semblance of good; he mingles some little improvement with the\nfolly and amusements, and deceived souls urge as an excuse for\n132 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nengaging in them that great good is to be derived. This is only the\ndeceptive part; Satan\u2019s hellish arts are masked. Beguiled souls take[143]\none step, then are prepared for the next. It is much more pleasant\nto follow the inclination of their own hearts than to stand on the\ndefensive and resist the first insinuation of the wily foe, and thus\nshut out his incomings. Oh, how Satan watches to see his bait taken\nso readily and to see souls walking in the very path he has prepared!\nHe does not want them to give up praying and maintaining a form of\nreligious duties, for while they do this he can make them more useful\nin his service. He unites his sophistry and deceptive snares with\ntheir experience and profession, and thus wonderfully advances his\ncause. The hypocritical Pharisees prayed and fasted, and observed\nthe forms of godliness, while they were corrupt at heart. Satan stands\nby to taunt Christ and His angels with insults, saying: \u201cI have them!\nI have them! I have prepared my deception for them. Your blood is\nworthless here. Your intercessions and power and wonderful works\nmay as well cease; I have them! They are mine! Notwithstanding\ntheir high profession as subjects of Christ, notwithstanding they\nonce enjoyed the illumination of His presence, I will secure them to\nmyself in the very face of heaven, which they are talking about. It is\nsuch subjects as these that I can use to decoy others.\u201d\nSolomon says, \u201cHe that trusteth in his own heart is a fool;\u201d\nand there are hundreds of such to be found among professors of\ngodliness. Says the apostle: \u201cWe are not ignorant of his devices.\u201d\nOh, what art, what skill, what cunning, is exercised to lead the\nprofessed followers of Christ to a union with the world by seeking\nfor happiness in the amusements of the world, under the delusion\nthat some good is to be gained! And thus the unguarded walk right\ninto the net, flattering themselves that there is no evil in the way.\nThe affections and sympathies of such are wrought upon, and this\nlays a slim foundation upon which they build their confidence that[144]\nthey are the children of God. They compare themselves with others\nand settle down satisfied that they are even better than many true\nChristians. But where is the deep love of Christ shining forth in their\nlives, its bright rays blessing others? Where is their Bible? and how\nmuch is it studied? Where are their thoughts? Are they upon heaven\nand heavenly things? It is not natural for their minds to go forth in\nthat direction. The study of God\u2019s word is uninteresting to them.\nNeglect of Hannah More 133\nIt does not possess that which excites and fevers the mind, and the\nnatural, unrenewed heart prefers some other book to the word of\nGod. Their attention is engrossed in self. They have no deep, earnest\nlongings for the influence of the Spirit of God upon the mind and\nheart. God is not in all their thoughts.\nHow can I endure the thought that most of the youth in this age\nwill come short of everlasting life! Oh, that the sound of instrumental\nmusic might cease and they no more while away so much precious\ntime in pleasing their own fancy. Oh, that they would devote less\ntime to dress and vain conversation, and send forth their earnest,\nagonizing prayers to God for a sound experience. There is great\nnecessity for close self-examination in the light of God\u2019s word; let\neach one raise the inquiry: \u201cAm I sound, or am I rotten at heart?\nAm I renewed in Christ, or am I still carnal at heart, with a new\ndress put on the outside?\u201d Rein yourself up to the great tribunal,\nand in the light of God examine to see if there be any secret sin that\nyou are cherishing, any idol that you have not sacrificed. Pray, yes,\npray as you have never prayed before, that you may not be deluded\nby Satan\u2019s devices, that you may not be given up to a heedless,\ncareless, vain spirit, and attend to religious duties to quiet your own\nconscience.\nIt is inappropriate for Christians in any age of the world to be [145]\nlovers of pleasure, but how much more so now when the scenes of\nthis earth\u2019s history are so soon to close. Surely the foundation of\nyour hope of everlasting life cannot be laid too sure. The welfare\nof your soul and your eternal happiness depend upon whether your\nfoundation is built upon Christ. While others are panting after earthly\nenjoyments, be ye panting after the unmistakable assurance of the\nlove of God, earnestly, fervently crying: Who will show me how\nto make my calling and election sure? One of the signs of the last\ndays is, that professed Christians are lovers of pleasure more than\nlovers of God. Deal truly with your own soul. Search carefully.\nHow few, after a faithful examination, can look up to heaven and\nsay: \u201cI am not one of those thus described! I am not a lover of\npleasure more than a lover of God!\u201d How few can say: \u201cI am dead\nto the world; the life I now live is by faith in the Son of God! My\nlife is hid with Christ in God, and when He who is my life shall\nappear, then shall I also appear with Him in glory.\u201d The love and\n134 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ngrace of God! Oh, precious grace! more valuable than fine gold. It\nelevates and ennobles the spirit beyond all other principles, and sets\nthe affections upon heaven. While those around us may be vain and\nengaged in pleasure-seeking and folly, our conversation is in heaven,\nwhence we look for the Saviour; the soul is reaching out after God\nfor pardon and peace, for righteousness and true holiness. Converse\nwith God and contemplation of things above transform the soul into\nthe likeness of Christ.\n* * * * *\nChapter 21\u2014Prayer for the Sick\nIn the case of Sister F, there needed to be a great work accom-\nplished. Those who united in praying for her needed a work done\nfor them. Had God answered their prayers, it would have proved [146]\ntheir ruin. In such cases of affliction, where Satan has control of the\nmind, before engaging in prayer there should be the closest self-ex-\namination to discover if there are not sins which need to be repented\nof, confessed, and forsaken. Deep humility of soul before God is\nnecessary, and firm, humble reliance upon the merits of the blood\nof Christ alone. Fasting and prayer will accomplish nothing while\nthe heart is estranged from God by a wrong course of action. \u201cIs not\nthis the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to\nundo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that\nye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and\nthat thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou\nseest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself\nfrom thine own flesh?\u201d \u201cThen shalt thou call, and the Lord shall\nanswer; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here I am. If thou take\naway from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger,\nand speaking vanity; and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry,\nand satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity,\nand thy darkness be as the noonday: and the Lord shall guide thee\ncontinually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones:\nand thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water,\nwhose waters fail not.\u201d\nIt is heartwork that the Lord requires, good works springing from\na heart filled with love. All should carefully and prayerfully con-\nsider the above scriptures, and investigate their motives and actions.\nThe promise of God to us is on condition of obedience, compliance\nwith all His requirements. \u201cCry aloud,\u201d saith the prophet Isaiah,\n\u201cspare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their\ntransgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. Yet they seek Me\ndaily, and delight to know My ways, as a nation that did righteous-\n135\n136 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of Me\nthe ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.[147]\nWherefore have we fasted, say they, and Thou seest not? wherefore\nhave we afflicted our soul, and Thou takest no knowledge?\u201d\nA people are here addressed who make high profession, who\nare in the habit of praying, and who delight in religious exercises;\nyet there is a lack. They realize that their prayers are not answered;\ntheir zealous, earnest efforts are not observed in heaven, and they\nearnestly inquire why the Lord makes them no returns. It is not\nbecause there is any neglect on the part of God. The difficulty is\nwith the people. While professing godliness, they do not bear fruit to\nthe glory of God; their works are not what they should be. They are\nliving in neglect of positive duties. Unless these are performed, God\ncannot answer their prayers according to His glory. In the case of\noffering prayer for Sister F, there was confusion of sentiment. Some\nwere fanatical and moved from impulse. They possessed a zeal, but\nnot according to knowledge. Some looked at the great thing to be\naccomplished in this case and began to triumph before the victory\nwas gained. There was much of the Jehu spirit manifested: \u201cCome\nwith me, and see my zeal for the Lord.\u201d In place of this self-confident\nassurance, the case should have been presented to God with a spirit\nof humbleness and distrustfulness of self, and with a broken and a\ncontrite heart.\nI was shown that in case of sickness, where the way is clear for\nthe offering up of prayer for the sick, the case should be committed\nto the Lord in calm faith, not with a storm of excitement. He alone\nis acquainted with the past life of the individual and knows what\nhis future will be. He who is acquainted with the hearts of all men\nknows whether the person, if raised up, would glorify His name or\ndishonor Him by backsliding and apostasy. All that we are required\nto do is to ask God to raise the sick up if in accordance with His\nwill, believing that He hears the reasons which we present and the[148]\nfervent prayers offered. If the Lord sees it will best honor Him, He\nwill answer our prayers. But to urge recovery without submission to\nHis will is not right.\nWhat God promises He is able at any time to perform, and the\nwork which He gives His people to do He is able to accomplish by\nthem. If they will live according to every word He has spoken, every\nPrayer for the Sick 137\ngood word and promise will be fulfilled unto them. But if they come\nshort of perfect obedience, the great and precious promises are afar\noff, and they cannot reach the fulfillment.\nAll that can be done in praying for the sick is to earnestly impor-\ntune God in their behalf, and in perfect confidence rest the matter in\nHis hands. If we regard iniquity in our hearts the Lord will not hear\nus. He can do what He will with His own. He will glorify Himself\nby working in and through them who wholly follow Him, so that it\nshall be known that it is the Lord and that their works are wrought\nin God. Said Christ: \u201cIf any man serve Me, him will My Father\nhonor.\u201d When we come to Him we should pray that we may enter\ninto and accomplish His purpose, and that our desires and interests\nmay be lost in His. We should acknowledge our acceptance of His\nwill, not praying Him to concede to ours. It is better for us that\nGod does not always answer our prayers just when we desire, and in\njust the manner we wish. He will do more and better for us than to\naccomplish all our wishes, for our wisdom is folly.\nWe have united in earnest prayer around the sickbed of men,\nwomen, and children, and have felt that they were given back to us\nfrom the dead in answer to our earnest prayers. In these prayers\nwe thought we must be positive and, if we exercised faith, that we\nmust ask for nothing less than life. We dared not say, \u201cIf it will\nglorify God,\u201d fearing it would admit a semblance of doubt. We have\nanxiously watched those who have been given back, as it were, from [149]\nthe dead. We have seen some of these, especially youth, raised\nto health, and they have forgotten God, become dissolute in life,\ncausing sorrow and anguish to parents and friends, and have become\na shame to those who feared to pray. They lived not to honor and\nglorify God, but to curse Him with their lives of vice.\nWe no longer mark out a way nor seek to bring the Lord to our\nwishes. If the life of the sick can glorify Him, we pray that they may\nlive; nevertheless, not as we will but as He will. Our faith can be just\nas firm, and more reliable, by committing the desire to the all-wise\nGod, and, without feverish anxiety, in perfect confidence, trusting\nall to Him. We have the promise. We know that He hears us if we\nask according to His will. Our petitions must not take the form of\na command, but of intercession for Him to do the things we desire\nof Him. When the church are united, they will have strength and\n138 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\npower; but when part of them are united to the world, and many are\ngiven to covetousness, which God abhors, He can do but little for\nthem. Unbelief and sin shut them away from God. We are so weak\nthat we cannot bear much spiritual prosperity, lest we take the glory,\nand accredit goodness and righteousness to ourselves as the reason\nof the signal blessing of God, when it was all because of the great\nmercy and lovingkindness of our compassionate heavenly Father,\nand not because any good was found in us.\nWe should ever exert an influence which will be sanctifying on\nthose around us. This saving, ennobling influence has been very\nfeeble at -----. Many have mingled with the world and partaken\nof its spirit and influence, and its friendship has separated them\nfrom God. Jesus has passed a day\u2019s journey in advance of them.\nThey can no longer hear His voice of counsel and warning, and\nthey follow their own wisdom and judgment. They follow a course\nwhich appears right in their own eyes, but which afterward proves\nto be folly. God will not allow His work to be mixed with worldly[150]\npolicy. Shrewd, calculating men of the world are not the men to\ntake leading positions in this most solemn, sacred work. They must\neither be converted, or engage in that calling which is appropriate\nto their world-loving inclinations, and which does not involve such\neternal consequences. God will never enter into partnership with\nworldlings. Christ gives everyone his choice: Will you have Me or\nthe world? Will you suffer reproach and shame, be peculiar, and\nzealous of good works, even if hated of the world, and take My\nname, or will you choose the esteem, the honor, the applause and\nprofits the world has to give, and have no part in Me? \u201cYe cannot\nserve God and mammon.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 22\u2014Courage in the Minister\nDear Brother G,\nI have been shown that you were greatly deficient in your duties\nas a minister. You lack essential qualifications. You do not possess a\nmissionary spirit. You have not a disposition to sacrifice your ease\nand pleasure to save souls. There are men, women, and youth to be\nbrought to Christ who would embrace the truth could they have the\nlight presented to them. In your own vicinity there are those who\nhave an ear to hear.\nI saw you seeking to instruct some; but at the very time when you\nneeded perseverance, courage, and energy, you became fainthearted,\ndistrustful, discouraged, and dropped the work. You desired your\nown ease, and allowed an interest which might have increased, to\ngo down. There might have been an ingathering of souls; but the\ngolden opportunity passed for that time, because of your lack of\nenergy. I saw that unless you decide to gird on the whole armor,\nand are willing to endure hardness as a good soldier of the cross of\nChrist, and feel that you can spend and be spent to bring souls to [151]\nChrist, you should give up your profession as a minister and choose\nsome other calling.\nYour soul is not sanctified to the work. You do not take the\nburden of the work upon you. You choose an easier lot than that\nwhich is appointed to the minister of Christ. He counted not His\nlife dear unto Himself. He pleased not Himself, but lived for others\u2019\ngood. He made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Himself\nthe form of a servant. It is not enough to be able to present the\narguments of our position before the people. The minister of Christ\nmust possess an undying love for souls, a spirit of self-denial, of\nself-sacrifice. He should be willing to give his life, if need be, to the\nwork of saving his fellow men, for whom Christ died.\nYou need a conversion to the work of God. You need wisdom\nand judgment to apply yourself to the work and direct your labor.\nYour labors are not required among the churches. You should go\n139\n140 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nout in new places and prove your work. Go with a spirit to labor to\nconvert souls to the truth. If you feel the worth of souls, the least\nindication for good will rejoice your heart, and you will persevere,\nalthough there may be labor and weariness in the effort. After you\nhave once agitated the subject of truth, do not leave that place if there\nis the least indication for good. Do you expect a harvest without\nlabor? Do you expect that Satan will readily allow his subjects to\npass from his ranks to the ranks of Christ? He will make every effort\nto keep them bound in fetters of darkness under his black banner.\nCan you expect to be victorious in winning souls to Christ without\nearnest effort, when you have such a foe to face and battle?\nYou must have more courage, more zeal, and put forth greater\nefforts, or you will have to decide that you have mistaken your\ncalling. An easily discouraged minister does injury to the cause\nhe desires to promote, and injustice to himself. All who profess to\nbe ministers of Christ should learn wisdom by studying the history[152]\nof the Man of Nazareth, and also the history of Martin Luther and\nthe lives of other Reformers. Their labors were arduous, but they\nendured hardness as faithful soldiers of the cross of Christ. You\nshould not shun responsibilities. With modesty, you should be\nwilling to be advised, to be instructed. After you have received\ncounsel from the wise, the judicious, there is yet a Counselor whose\nwisdom is unerring. Fail not to present your case before Him and\nentreat His direction. He has promised that if you lack wisdom and\nask of Him, He will give it to you liberally and upbraid not. The\nsacred, solemn work in which we are engaged calls for wholehearted,\nthoroughly converted men, whose lives are interwoven with the life\nof Christ. They draw sap and nourishment from the living Vine,\nand flourish in the Lord. Although they feel the magnitude of the\nwork, and are led to exclaim, \u201cWho is sufficient for these things?\u201d\nyet they will not shrink from labor and toil, but will labor earnestly\nand unselfishly to save souls. If the undershepherds are faithful in\nall their duty, they will enter into the joy of their Lord and have the\nsatisfaction of seeing souls saved in heaven through their faithful\nefforts.\n* * * * *\nChapter 23\u2014Closeness in Deal\nDear Brother H,\nI have been waiting for an opportunity to write you, but have\nbeen hindered. After my last vision I felt it to be my duty to speed-\nily lay before you what the Lord was pleased to present to me. I\nwas pointed back and shown that for years in the past, even before\nyour marriage, there had been in you a disposition to overreach in\ntrade. You possessed a spirit of acquisitiveness, a disposition for\nclose dealing, which was detrimental to your spiritual advancement\nand greatly injured your influence. Your father\u2019s family viewed [153]\nthese matters from the world\u2019s standpoint rather than from the high,\nexalted standard quoted by our divine Lord: \u201cThou shalt love the\nLord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all\nthy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d\nIn this you have failed. To deal in any way closely and unjustly is\ndispleasing to God. He will not pass over errors and sins in this\ndirection without thorough confession and forsaking.\nI was pointed far back and shown the loose manner in which you\nregarded these things. The Lord marked the transaction of carrying\nto market that load of animals that were so inferior that they could not\nbe profitable to keep, therefore were prepared for food and carried\nto market to be bought and introduced into the human stomach.\nOne of these was placed upon our table for some time to feed our\nlarge family in the days of our poverty. You were not the only one\nto be blamed in this. Others of your family were alike guilty. It\nmatters not whether it was designed that they should be bought and\neaten by us or by worldlings. It is the principle of the thing which\ndispleased God; you transgressed His command. You did not love\nyour neighbor as you did yourself, for you would be unwilling to\nhave the same thing done to you. You would consider yourself\ninsulted. An avaricious spirit led to this departure from Christian\nprinciples, and caused you to descend to a species of trading which\nadvantaged yourself at others\u2019 disadvantage.\n141\n142 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nWhen the meat-eating question was presented before me five\nyears ago, showing how little the people knew what they were eating\nfor food in the shape of flesh meats, this transaction of yours was\nshown. The effect of eating the meat of these unhealthy animals is\ndiseased blood, sickness, and fevers. Many instances of the kind\nwere shown me as being acted over daily by worldlings. You, my\ndear brother, have not seen this wrong on your part as the Lord sees\nit. You have never felt that it was a great sin on your part. Many[154]\nthings of like character have taken place in your life, which you will\nfind that the recording angel has faithfully chronicled, and which\nyou will meet again, unless by repentance and confession you make\nthese wrongs right.\nI was bidden to wait and see. I was directed to speak plainly, give\ngeneral principles, and leave you to make the application yourself.\nI was shown that God would not frequently point out the wrongs\ncommitted by His people, but would cause to be given in their\nhearing general principles, close, pointed truths, and all should be\nopen to conviction to see, to feel, and understand whether or not\nthey are condemned. You have not dealt closely and faithfully with\nyour own soul. Said the angel: \u201cI will prove him, I will test him, I\nwill walk contrary unto him, until he acknowledges the hand of God\nin thus dealing with him.\u201d\nI saw that while in ----- those connected with your family did not\nmove right. You manifested a close spirit, savoring of overreaching\nand dishonesty. You could have had no influence for good in that\nplace until you had redeemed the past by an entire change of conduct\nin dealing with your fellow men. Your light was darkness to the\npeople, and your influence while there was a great detriment to the\ncause of present truth. You brought reproach upon the truth, and\nyour close dealing caused your name to be a byword among the\npeople. You frequently fell below the standard of many worldlings\nin regard to honorable dealing. Elder I can do no good in -----. His\nwords are as water spilled upon the ground, for the reason that he\nwas connected with you and took part in this close trading. In many\nrespects he became like a worldling in business transactions. He was\nclose and was fast becoming selfish. His course in many things was\ncalculated to destroy his influence and was not becoming a minister\nof Christ. Said the angel in the vision given at Rochester, New York,[155]\nCloseness in Deal 143\nin 1866: \u201cMy hand shall bring adversity. He may gather, but I will\nscatter until he redeems the past and makes clean work for eternity.\u201d\nEvery true Christian should feel above condescending to the low,\nbartering, trading spirit of worldlings.\nYou are not a miser; you love to be benevolent, free, open-\nhearted, and openhanded; but that which is wrong in you is the spirit\nmentioned in this letter, of not loving your neighbor as yourself; it\nis the neglect of seeing your wrongs and making them right when\nthe clear, forcible light of truth has told you too plainly your duty.\nYou are a lover of hospitality, and God will not give you over to be\ndeceived by the great deceiver of mankind, but will come directly to\nyou and show you where you err that you may retrace your steps.\nHe now calls upon you to redeem the past, and to come up upon a\nhigher plane of action, and let your life record be unspotted with\navarice or selfish love of gain.\nYour judgment in worldly things will become foolishness unless\nyou dedicate all to God. You and your wife are not devotional.\nYour spirituality is not what God would have it to be. Paralysis\nseems to be upon you; yet you are both capable of exerting a strong\ninfluence for God and for His truth, if you adorn your profession\nwith well-ordered lives and godly conversation. You frequently get\nin too great a hurry, and then become impatient and fretful, and order\nyour help in a hurried manner. This is detrimental to your spiritual\nadvancement.\nTime is short, and you have no time to delay the preparation\nof heart necessary to labor earnestly and faithfully for your own\nsoul, and for the salvation of your friends and neighbors, and all\nwho come under your influence. Ever aim to so live in the light\nthat your influence can be sanctifying upon those with whom you\nare associated in a business capacity or in common intercourse. [156]\nThere is fullness in Jesus. You can obtain strength from Him which\nwill qualify you to walk even as He walked, but there must be no\nseparation of affections from Him. He requires the entire man, the\nsoul, body, and spirit. When you do all on your part which He\nrequires, He will work for you, and bless and strengthen you by His\nrich grace.\n* * * * *\nChapter 24\u2014Oppressing the Hireling\nDear Brother J,\nA great solemnity has rested upon my mind since the vision\ngiven Friday evening, June 12, 1868. I was shown that you do not\nknow yourself. You have not felt reconciled to the testimony given\nin your case and have not made thorough work to reform. I was\nreferred to Isaiah: \u201cIs not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose\nthe bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the\noppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy\nbread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to\nthy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that\nthou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?\u201d If you do these things,\nthe blessings promised will be given.\nYou may raise the inquiry, \u201cWherefore have we fasted,\u201d \u201cand\nThou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and Thou\ntakest no knowledge?\u201d God has given reasons why your prayers\nwere not answered. You have thought that you had found reasons in\nothers and have charged the fault upon them. But I saw that there\nare sufficient reasons in yourself. You have a work to do to set your\nown heart in order. You should realize that the work must begin\nwith yourself. You have oppressed the destitute and have benefited\nyourself by taking advantage of their necessities. In regard to means,[157]\nyou have been close and dealt unjustly. You have not possessed\nthat kind, noble, and generous spirit which should ever characterize\nthe life of a follower of Christ. You have oppressed the hireling in\nher wages. You saw a poorly clad, hard-working person who you\nknew was conscientious and God-fearing; yet you took advantage\nof her because you could do so. I saw that the neglect of seeing\nand understanding her wants, and the small wages paid her, are all\nwritten in heaven as done to Jesus in the person of one of His saints.\nAs you have done this unto the least of Christ\u2019s disciples, you have\ndone it unto Him. Heaven has regarded all your closeness to those\nwho have served in your house, and it will stand faithfully chronicled\n144\nOppressing the Hireling 145\nagainst you unless it is repented of and restitution made. One wrong\nmove does more harm than can be undone in years; if the wrongdoer\ncould see the extent of the evil, it would wring from his soul cries of\nanguish. You are selfish in regard to means. In the case of Brother\nK the angel of God pointed to you and said: \u201cInasmuch as ye have\ndone this to one of Christ\u2019s disciples, ye have done it to Jesus in His\nperson.\u201d\nThe cases I have mentioned are not the only ones. I would\nyou could see these things as Heaven has opened them before me.\nThere is a sad deception upon minds. It is the religion of Christ\nthat you need. He pleased not Himself, but lived to benefit others.\nYou have a work to do, and should lose no time in humbling your\nheart before God, and by humble confessions remove the blots from\nyour Christian character. Then can you engage in the solemn work\nof laboring for the salvation of others without making so many\nmistakes.\nWhat has your time amounted to, spent as it has been spent while\nengaged in a work which God did not set you about? Impressions\nhave been made on minds, and experiences gained, which it will\nrequire much labor for them to efface. Souls will wander in darkness, [158]\nperplexity, and unbelief, and some will never recover. With fasting\nand earnest prayer, with deep heart searching, stern self-examination,\nlay bare the soul; let no act escape your critical examination. Then,\nwith self dead and your life hid with Christ in God, offer your humble\npetitions. If you regard iniquity in your heart, the Lord will not hear\nyou. If He had heard your prayers, you would have been exalted.\nSatan has stood by, prepared to make the most of the advantage he\nhas gained.\nOh, how important it is that faithfulness in little things charac-\nterize our lives, that true integrity mark all our course of action, and\nthat we ever bear in mind that angels of God are taking cognizance\nof every act! That which we mete to others shall be meted to us\nagain. A fearfulness should ever attend you lest you should deal\nunjustly, selfishly. By sickness and adversity the Lord will remove\nfrom us much more than we obtain by grinding the face of the poor.\nA just God truly estimates all our motives and actions.\nI was shown Brother and Sister L. The love of the world has\nso eaten out true godliness and benumbed the powers of the mind\n146 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthat the truth fails to have a transforming influence upon the life\nand character. The love of the world has closed their hearts to\ncompassion and to a consideration of the wants of others; its spirit\nhas separated them from God. Brother and sister, you have a work\nto do to get from beneath the rubbish of the world; you need to make\nearnest efforts to overcome your love of the world, your selfishness,\nand your penuriousness. These are sins which are cursing God\u2019s\npeople. I was pointed back to the community in which you lived\nprevious to your moving to -----. You were close and exacting in deal\nthere, taking advantage every time that you could well do so. I tried\nto find in your lives acts of noble self-sacrifice and benevolence, but\ncould not, they were so rare. Your light has shone before others in[159]\nsuch a manner that they have felt disgusted with you and your faith.\nThe truth has been reproached by your closeness and overreaching\nin deal. May God help you to see all, and to have that hatred for\nthis evil that He has. Let your light so shine that others by seeing\nyour good works may be led to glorify your Father who is in heaven.\nGod has been displeased with your course, for it has been marked by\nself-interest. He is still displeased with it, and will deal with you in\njudgment, unless you rid yourself of this spirit of littleness, and seek\nto be sanctified through the truth. Faith without works is dead, being\nalone. Faith will never save you unless it is justified by works. God\nrequires of you to be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing\nto communicate, laying up in store for yourselves a good foundation\nagainst the time to come, that you may lay hold on eternal life.\nI was shown that you have oppressed hirelings in their wages.\nYou have taken advantage of circumstances and secured your help\nat the lowest figure. This has not been pleasing to God. You should\nhave paid your help liberally, all that they earned. God sees and\nknows. The Searcher of hearts is acquainted with the thoughts, the\nintents and purposes of the heart. Every dollar that has been gained\nby you in this way, if retained, will be scattered through adversity\nand affliction. The world, the world, the world, has been the order of\nthe day with you. The salvation of the soul has become secondary.\nOh, that you could see, in the light of eternity, just how God views\nthese things. You would be alarmed and would not rest until you\nhad made restitution.\nOppressing the Hireling 147\nYou had light upon health reform, but you did not receive and\nlive up to it. You gratified the appetite and taught your boy a sad\nlesson by indulging him in eating when and what he chose. In your\nlove for the world you continued to work upon the high-pressure\nplan. The hand of God was removed, and you were left to your [160]\nown weakness. Then you both tottered over the brink of the grave,\nyet you failed to learn the lesson in many things which God would\nhave you learn. You retained your love for the world. Your selfish\nlove for gain, your small, close dealing, was not put away. You did\nnot appreciate the sympathy, kind care, and watchful tenderness of\nthe one who had the care of you in your sickness. If you had, it\nwould have led you to manifest a spirit of noble benevolence above\nany cheap dealing with her who had been true to you. You have\nground the face of the poor; you have dealt unjustly. \u201cThere is that\nscattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more\nthan is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.\u201d\nIt seemed to me, as these things were presented before me, that\nSatan had possessed such power to blind minds through a love of the\nworld, that even professed Christians forgot, or lost all sense of the\nfact that God lives and that His angels are making a record of all the\ndoings of the children of men; that every mean act, every small deal,\nis placed upon the life record. Every day bears its burden of record\nof unfulfilled duties, of neglect, of selfishness, of deception, of fraud,\nof overreaching. What an amount of evil works is accumulating for\nthe final judgment! When Christ shall come, \u201cHis reward is with\nHim, and His work before Him,\u201d to render to every man according\nas his works have been. What a revelation will then be made! What\nconfusion of face to some as the acts of their lives are revealed upon\nthe pages of history!\n\u201cHearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor\nof this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which He hath\npromised to them that love Him? But ye have despised the poor.\u201d\n\u201cWhat doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith,\nand have not works? can faith save him? If a brother or sister be\nnaked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, [161]\nDepart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give\nthem not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it\nprofit? Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.\u201d You\n148 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nmay believe all the truth; yet if its principles are not carried out in\nyour lives, your profession will not save you. Satan believes and\ntrembles. He works. He knows his time is short, and he has come\ndown in great power to do his evil works according to his faith. But\nGod\u2019s professed people do not support their faith by their works.\nThey believe in the shortness of time, yet grasp just as eagerly after\nthis world\u2019s goods as though the world were to stand a thousand\nyears as it now is.\nSelfishness marks the course of many. \u201cBut whoso hath this\nworld\u2019s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his\nbowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in\nhim? My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but\nin deed and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth,\nand shall assure our hearts before Him. For if our heart condemn\nus, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved,\nif our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.\nAnd whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His\ncommandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.\u201d\nDivest yourselves of selfishness and make thorough work for\neternity. Redeem the past and do not represent the holy truth you\nprofess where you now live as you have where you have lived\nhitherto. Let your light so shine that others by seeing your good\nworks may be led to glorify our Father in heaven. Stand upon\nthe elevated platform of eternal truth. Regulate all your business\ntransactions in this life in strict accordance with the word of God.\nChapter 25\u2014Combativeness Reproved [162]\nDear Brother M,\nWhen we met you at -----, we were anxious to help you, and\nwe feared you would not receive the help there which you needed.\nI proposed your coming to our place and associating with us, and\nothers of God\u2019s dear children, that you might be learning the lessons\nso important for you to learn before you could be strong to endure\nthe temptations and perils of these last days. I recollected your\ncountenance as that of one whom the Lord had shown me had been\nstruggling for the mastery over powerful evil habits, which were\nleading not only to the destruction of your body but to your eternal\ndestruction hereafter. You have gained victories, but you have still\ngreat victories to gain; you have battles to fight with internal foes\nwhich, unless overcome, will greatly mar your own happiness and\nthat of all who associate with you.\nThe evil traits in your character must be overcome. You must\ntake hold of the work with earnest, humble prayer to God, feeling\nyour helplessness without His special grace. The belief of the truth\nhas already wrought a reformation in your life, yet this reform is not\nas thorough as it must be in order for you to meet the measurement\nof God. You love the truth, but it must take a deeper hold of your\nlife and influence your words and all your deportment. You have\na great lesson to learn, and should lose no time in learning it. You\nhave not educated yourself to self-control. Here is a special victory\nfor you to gain. In your organization are more of the elements of\nwar than of peace. You need to cultivate courtesy and true Christian\npoliteness. \u201cIn honor preferring one another.\u201d \u201cLet nothing be done\nthrough strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem\nother better than themselves.\u201d\nYour combativeness is large, and you stand braced, prepared [163]\nto rebut everything where you have a chance. You do not labor to\nsee how near you can make your ideas and views harmonize with\nthose of others, but you stand all ready to differ if there is a possible\n149\n150 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nchance for you to do so. This injures your own soul, retards your\nspiritual advancement, and not only grieves and wounds those who\nwould be your sincere friends, but sometimes disgusts them, so that\nyour society is not agreeable and pleasant, but annoying. It is as\nnatural as your breath for you to consider the views and opinions of\nothers inferior to yours. You often greatly err here, for you have not\nall that wisdom and knowledge for which you give yourself credit.\nYou often set your opinions up above men and women who have had\nmany more years of experience than yourself, and who are far better\nqualified to direct and give words of wise judgment than yourself.\nBut you have not seen these disagreeable besetments, and therefore\nhave not realized the ill and bitter fruit they have produced. You\nhave long indulged a spirit of contention, of war. Your peculiar turn\nof mind leads you to exult in opposites.\nYour education has been deplorable; it has not been favorable\nto your now having a correct religious experience. You have had\nalmost everything to unlearn and learn anew. You possess a hasty\ntemper, which grieves your friends and the holy angels, and wounds\nyour own soul. This is all contrary to the spirit of truth and true\nholiness. You must learn to cultivate modesty in speaking. Self\nmust be subdued and kept in subjection. A Christian will not pursue\na course of bickering and contention with even the most wicked\nand unbelieving. How wrong to indulge this spirit with those who\nbelieve the truth and who are seeking for peace, love, and harmony!\nSays Paul: \u201cBe at peace among yourselves.\u201d This spirit of contention\nis opposed to all the principles of heaven. In Christ\u2019s Sermon on[164]\nthe Mount He says: \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be\ncalled the children of God.\u201d \u201cBlessed are the meek: for they shall\ninherit the earth.\u201d You will have trouble wherever you go, unless\nyou learn the lesson God designs you to learn. You should be less\nconfident and forward in your own opinion, and possess a teachable\nspirit, that of a learner. \u201cHe that is slow to anger is better than the\nmighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.\u201d \u201cHe\nthat is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of\nspirit exalteth folly.\u201d Says James: \u201cWherefore, my beloved brethren,\nlet every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: for the\nwrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.\u201d\nCombativeness Reproved 151\nA spirit of self-confidence is in keeping with your experience.\nHad you a more thorough experience in the things of God you would\nrealize that the fruits you bear are bad. They contain no nourishment,\nbut fill all who partake of them with bitterness. You must overcome\nyour overbearing, dictatorial spirit. I have strong hope, my dear\nbrother, that you, who have shown that you have moral courage to\nface an enemy in yourself, and fortitude to battle with the foe of\nappetite and strong evil habits which girded you about as with iron\nbands, will go to work right here and gain the victory. You have\npossessed a reckless spirit, have felt that no one cared specially for\nyou, that almost everybody was your enemy, and that it was of no\nconsequence what became of you.\nThe truth found you miserable. You saw in it a power that would\nexalt you and impart to you the force and strength that you had\nnot. You grasped the rays of light that shone upon you; and if\nyou will now yield yourself fully to the influence of the truth, it\nwill thoroughly convert and sanctify you, and prepare you for the\nfinishing touch of immortality. You possess many good traits of\ncharacter; you have a liberal heart. God wants you to be right, just [165]\nright. You are unwilling to be dictated to or directed. You want to do\nall the dictating yourself. But you must possess a humble, teachable\nspirit, and be affable, patient, long-suffering, full of gentleness and\nmercy.\nWe have an interest for you, and want to help you. I pray you\nto receive these lines with a right spirit, and let them suitably affect\nyour heart and life.\nResponse\nSister White,\nThe testimony I received yesterday I look upon as a well-merited\nrebuke for which I feel truly thankful to you. I earnestly hope to be\nan overcomer. I am fully sensible of the magnitude of the work I\nhave to do, yet I trust that by God\u2019s assisting grace I shall be able to\nconquer.\n* * * * *\nChapter 26\u2014Burden Bearers in the Church\nDear Brother and Sister N,\nJune 12, 1868, I was shown some things in reference to you.\nYou have a work to do but see it not; you have not been burden\nbearers. You should feel greater interest in the work and cause of\nGod than you do. You are so blinded by the love of the world\nthat you do not see how great an influence the world has over you.\nYou do not feel that a special weight of responsibility rests upon\nyou, nor do you realize the importance of the time and the work to\nbe accomplished. You are like persons asleep. Unity is strength.\nThere is great feebleness in the church because there are in it so\nmany backward ones who take no burdens. You are not workers\nwith Christ. The spirit of the world is shutting from your hearts\nimpressions which the truth should make.\nIt is important that all now come up to the work and act as though\nthey were living men, laboring for the salvation of souls who are\nperishing. If all in the church would come up to the help of the Lord,[166]\nwe would see such a revival of His work as we have not hitherto\nwitnessed. God requires this of you and of each member of the\nchurch. It is not left with you to decide whether it is best for you to\nobey the call of God. Obedience is required; and unless you obey\nyou will stand on worse than neutral ground. Unless you are favored\nwith the blessing of God you have His curse. He requires you to\nbe willing and obedient, and says that you shall eat the good of the\nland. A bitter curse is pronounced on those who come not to the\nhelp of the Lord. \u201cCurse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse\nye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help\nof the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty.\u201d Satan and\nhis angels are in the field to oppose every advance step that God\u2019s\npeople take, therefore the help of everyone is required.\nBrother and Sister N, the influence of unbelieving friends affects\nyou more than you are aware of. They bring you no strength, but\ndarkness and unbelief. You have an individual work in the vineyard\n152\nBurden Bearers in the Church 153\nof the Lord. You have thought and cared too much for yourselves.\nSet your hearts in order, and then be in earnest. Inquire: \u201cLord, what\nwilt Thou have me to do?\u201d God requires of you an earnest reaching\nout after Him. He bids you search your own hearts diligently to\ndiscover all there that prevents your bringing forth much fruit, and\nthat which will remain. The reason you possess no more of the Spirit\nof God is that you do not cheerfully bear the cross of Christ. In the\nlast vision I saw that you were deceived in regard to the strength of\nyour love for this world. The cares of this life and the deceitfulness\nof riches choke the word, and you become unfruitful. God requires\nus to bear much fruit. He will not give commands without giving\nwith them power for their performance. He will not do our part of\nthe work, neither does He require that we do His. It is God that\nworketh in us, but we must work out our own salvation with fear [167]\nand trembling. \u201cFaith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.\u201d\nFaith must be sustained by works; the doers of the work are justified\nbefore God. You displease God in talking of your poverty, while\nyou have abundance. All that you possess belongs to Him, yet He\nhas seen fit to make you a steward of it for a short time, He is testing\nand proving you. How will you bear the test? He will require His\nown with usury.\nYou have fixed your eyes upon what you have given to different\nenterprises, and it looks large to you. But had you done very much\nmore, had your hearts expanded, and your hands dispensed to the\ncause of God and to the needy, you would have done no more than\nyour duty, and you would have been far happier. The Lord calls\nupon you to bring your offering to the altar, and not hold it within\nreach merely, but lay it on the altar. The altar sanctifies the gift when\nit is placed upon it, and not before.\nYou are not as separate from the world as God requires you to be,\nbut you do not see and understand your danger. You are led astray\nby your love of the world. You both need to take a deeper draught at\nthe Fountain of truth. Unless you do come into a different condition\nwhere you can honor God with your influence and your substance,\nHis curse will come upon you. You may gather, but He will scatter.\nInstead of your health springing forth speedily, you will become like\na withered branch. The Lord calls for workers\u2014men who can and\nwill feel for the salvation of souls, and who will sacrifice anything\n154 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthat they may be saved. No one else can do this work for you; the\nofferings of others, if ever so liberal, cannot take the place of yours.\nIt is a surrender to God which you have to make, which no other\none can make for you. It is only the Spirit\u2019s power, working through\nmighty faith, that can make you able to successfully resist the many[168]\nsnares Satan has laid for your feet. The words and example of your\nRedeemer will be the light and strength of your heart. If you follow\nand trust in Him, He will not leave you to perish. You fear too\nmuch the displeasure of those who do not love and serve God. Why\nshould you wish to keep the friendship of your Lord\u2019s enemies or be\ninfluenced by their opinions? \u201cKnow ye not that the friendship of\nthe world is enmity with God?\u201d If the heart were right, there would\nbe a more decided separation from the world.\nThe Lord would have done a great and good work in this vicinity\nlast spring had all felt the need of this work and come up to the\nhelp of the Lord. There was not unity of action. All did not feel\nthe necessity of the work and engage in it heartily. There was not a\nsurrendering of all to God. You were shown me as being troubled\nand perplexed, a mist of darkness gathering over you. You were\nquestioning and were not in a position to receive strength yourselves\nnor to impart it to others. It is a solemn, fearful time. There is no\ntime now for cherishing idols, no place for concord with Belial or for\nfriendship with the world. Those whom God accepts and sanctifies\nto Himself are called to be diligent and faithful in His service, being\nset apart and devoted to Him. It is not a form of godliness, nor a\nname upon the church records, that constitutes \u201ca living stone\u201d in\nthe spiritual building. It is being renewed in knowledge and true\nholiness, being crucified to the world and made alive in Christ, that\nunites the soul to God. The followers of Christ have one leading\nobject in view, one great work: the salvation of their fellow men.\nEvery other interest should be inferior to this; it should engage the\nmost earnest effort and the deepest interest.\nGod first requires the heart, the affections. He requires His\nfollowers to love and serve Him with all their heart, with all their\nsoul, with all their strength.\nHis commandments and grace are adapted to our necessities,[169]\nand without them we cannot be saved, do what we may. Acceptable\nobedience He requires. The offering of goods, or any service, will\nBurden Bearers in the Church 155\nnot be accepted without the heart. The will must be brought into\nsubjection. The Lord requires of you a greater consecration to Him\nand a greater separation from the spirit and influence of the world.\n\u201cBut ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy\nnation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of\nHim who hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.\u201d\nChrist has called you to be His followers, to imitate His life of self-\nsacrifice and self-denial, to be interested in the great work of the\nredemption of the fallen race. You have no just sense of the work that\nGod requires you to perform. Christ is your pattern. That in which\nyou are deficient is love. This pure and holy principle distinguishes\nthe character and conduct of Christians from those of worldlings.\nDivine love has a powerful, purifying influence. It is to be found\nonly in renewed hearts, and naturally flows out to their fellow men.\n\u201cLove one another,\u201d says our Saviour, \u201cas I have loved you.\nGreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for\nhis friends.\u201d Christ has given us an example of pure, disinterested\nlove. You have not as yet seen your deficiency in this respect, and\nyour great need of this heavenly attainment, without which all your\ngood purposes, and your zeal, even if it be of that nature that you\ncould give your goods to feed the poor and your body to be burned,\nis nothing. You need that charity which suffereth long, is not easily\nprovoked, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,\nendureth all things. Without the spirit of love, no one can be like\nChrist. With this living principle in the soul, no one can be like the\nworld.\nThe conduct of Christians is like that of their Lord. He erected [170]\nthe standard, and it is left for us to say whether or not we will rally\naround it. Our Lord and Saviour laid aside His dominion, His riches\nand glory, and sought after us, that He might save us from misery\nand make us like Himself. He humbled Himself and took our nature\nthat we might be able to learn of Him and, imitating His life of\nbenevolence and self-denial, follow Him step by step to heaven. You\ncannot equal the copy; but you can resemble it and, according to\nyour ability, do likewise. \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all\nthy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with\nall thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d Such love must dwell in\nyour hearts, that you will be ready to give the treasures and honors\n156 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nof this world if thereby you may influence one soul to engage in the\nservice of Christ.\nGod bids you with one hand, faith, take hold of His mighty arm,\nand with the other hand, love, reach perishing souls. Christ is the\nway, the truth, and the life. Follow Him. Walk not after the flesh,\nbut after the Spirit. Walk even as He walked. This is the will of God,\neven your sanctification. The work you have to perform is to do the\nwill of Him who sustains your life for His glory. If you labor for\nyourselves, it can profit you nothing. To labor for others\u2019 good, to\nbe less self-caring and more in earnest to devote all to God, will be\nacceptable to Him and be returned by His rich grace.\nGod has not apportioned you your lot to merely watch over and\ncare for yourselves. You are required to minister to, and watch over,\nothers, and in this exercise you will manifest those evils in your\ncharacter which need correcting, and will strengthen those weak\npoints that need strengthening. This is the part of the work we have\nto perform; not impatiently, fretfully, unwillingly, but cheerfully,\ngladly, in order to reach Christian perfection. To remove from us\neverything which is not exactly agreeable is not imitating Christ.\nYou should be very jealous for the honor of God. How circumspectly[171]\nshould you walk, where now your course is not as it should be. If you\ncould see the pure angels with their bright, searching eyes intently\nfixed on you, watching to record how the Christian glorifies his\nMaster; or could you observe the exulting, sneering triumph of the\nevil angels, as they trace out every crooked way, and then quote\nScripture which is violated, and compare the life with this Scripture\nwhich you profess to follow but from which you swerve, you would\nbe astonished and alarmed for yourselves. It takes the entire man to\nmake a valiant Christian. Oh, what blind, shortsighted creatures we\nare! How little do we discern sacred things, and how feebly do we\ncomprehend the riches of His grace!\nOne thing I wish to impress upon your minds. You have the\nspecial mediums of Satan closely connected with you, and their\npower and influence have a manifest effect upon you, because you\ndo not remain near enough to God to ensure the special aid of angels\nthat excel in strength. Your union is altogether too strong with your\nLord\u2019s enemies, and you perceive not that you are in danger of\nmaking shipwreck of your faith. If you encourage, in the least, the\nBurden Bearers in the Church 157\ntemptations of Satan, you place yourself upon his battleground, and\nthen the conflict will be long and sore before you obtain the victory\nand triumph in the name of Jesus, who has conquered him.\nSatan has great advantages. He possessed the wonderful intel-\nlectual power of an angel, of which few form any just idea. Satan\nwas conscious of his power, or he would not have engaged in a\nconflict with the mighty God, the everlasting Father, and the Prince\nof Peace. Satan closely watches events, and when he finds one who\nhas a specially strong spirit of opposition to the truth of God he\nwill even reveal to him unfulfilled events, that he may more firmly\nsecure himself a seat in his heart. He who did not hesitate to brave a\nconflict with Him who holds creation as in His hand, has malignity [172]\nto persecute and deceive. He holds mortals in his snare at the present\ntime. During his experience of nearly six thousand years he has lost\nnone of his skill and shrewdness. All this time he has been a close\nobserver of all that concerns our race.\nThose who have bitterly opposed the truth of God, Satan uses as\nhis mediums. To such he will appear in the assumed person and garb\nof another, it may be a friend of the medium. He will increase their\nfaith by using the words of this friend and relating circumstances\nwhich are about to take place or which really have taken place and of\nwhich the medium knew nothing. Sometimes previous to a death or\nan accident he gives a dream or, personating another, converses with\nthe medium, even imparting knowledge by means of his suggestions.\nBut it is wisdom from beneath and not from above. The wisdom\ntaught by Satan is opposed to the truth, unless, to serve his purpose,\nhe apparently clothes himself with the light which enshrouds angels.\nTo a certain class of minds he will come sanctioning a part of what\nChrist\u2019s followers believe to be truth, while he warns them to reject\nthe other part as dangerous and fatal error.\nSatan is a master workman. His infernal wisdom he employs\nwith good success. He is ready and able to teach those who reject\nthe counsel of God against their own souls. The bait which he has\nfound will avail in bringing souls into his net, that he may fasten his\nhellish grasp upon them, he will clothe with every possible good and\nmake as attractive as possible. All who are thus ensnared will learn\nat a dreadful expense the folly of selling heaven and immortality\nfor a deception that is fatal in its consequences. Our adversary, the\n158 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ndevil, is not void of wisdom or strength. He goeth about like a\nroaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. He will work \u201cwith all\npower and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of[173]\nunrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the\nlove of the truth, that they might be saved.\u201d Because they rejected\nthe truth, \u201cGod shall send them strong delusion, that they should\nbelieve a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the\ntruth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\u201d We have a powerful,\ndeceptive foe with whom to contend, and our only safety is in Him\nwho is to come, who will consume this archdeceiver with the spirit\nof His mouth, and destroy with the brightness of His coming.\nI commend this to you in the fear of God, and implore you to\narise from the dead, and Christ shall give you life.\n* * * * *\nChapter 27\u2014Pride in the Young\nDear Sister O,\nIt was my intention to have some conversation with you before\nleaving -----, but I was prevented by many things. I do not write with\nvery hopeful feelings that this letter will make any special change\nin your course of conduct so far as your religious experience is\nconcerned.\nI have felt very sad in regard to you. In the meetings held in\n-----, I dwelt upon general principles, and sought to reach hearts\nby bearing a testimony which I hoped would effect a change in\nyour religious life. I have tried to write, as given in Testimony No.\n12, in regard to the dangers of the young. That view was given in\nRochester. There I was shown that a mistake had been made in your\ninstruction from your childhood up. Your parents had thought, and\nhad talked it in your hearing, that you were a natural Christian. Your\nsisters had a love for you which savored of idolatry more than of\nsanctification. Your parents have had an unsanctified love for their\nchildren, which has blinded their eyes to their defects. At times,\nwhen they have been somewhat aroused, this has been different. [174]\nBut you have been petted and praised until your eternal interest is\nendangered.\nI saw that you do not know yourself. You have a self-righ-\nteousness which fastens you in deception in regard to your spiritual\nattainments. At times you have felt something of the influences of\nthe Spirit of God. But to the transformation by the renewing of the\nmind you are a stranger. \u201cBe not conformed to this world: but be\nye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove\nwhat is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.\u201d You\nhave not had this experience, therefore have no anchor. You are not\na Christian, and yet it has been talked to you all your life that you\nwere a natural Christian. You have taken it for granted that you were\nall right, when you were very far from being accepted of God. This\ndeception has grown with your growth, and strengthened with your\n159\n160 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nstrength, and threatens to prove your ruin. Your parents have felt\njealous for their children, and if reports of supposed slights have\nbeen brought to them by their children, they have felt interested and\naroused at once, and have sympathized with them, and stood directly\nin the way of their spiritual good.\nYou and your sister P have had a great amount of pride, which\nwill be as stubble in the day of God. Self-love and self-pride, pride\nof dress and appearance, have prevailed. Selfishness has kept you\nfrom good. You both must have a thorough conversion, a thorough\nrenewing of the mind, a thorough transformation, or you will have\nno part in the kingdom of God. Your appearance, your good looks,\nyour dress, will not bring you into favor with God. It is moral worth\nthat the great I AM notices. There is no real beauty of person or of\ncharacter out of Christ, no real perfection of manners or deportment\nwithout the sanctifying graces of the spirit of humility, sympathy,\nand true holiness.\nI have been shown that souls will be lost through your influence[175]\nand example. You have had light and privileges, and for them you\nwill have to render an account. You are not naturally religious or\ndevotional, but have to make special effort to keep your minds upon\nreligious things. Self is prominent with you. Your self-esteem is very\nlarge; but remember that Heaven looks at moral worth, and estimates\nthe character as precious and valuable by the inward adorning, the\nornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of\ngreat price. Costly array, outward adorning, personal attractions, all\nsink into insignificance in comparison with this valuable attainment,\na meek and quiet spirit. Your love for your own enjoyment and\ngratification, your lack of consecration and of devotion, have been\ndetrimental to many. Those who were backslidden you could not\nbenefit, for your lives were like the worldlings\u2019 in general.\nThose who visit ----- carry away the impression made by you\nand other of the youth who do not enjoy experimental religion, that\nthere is no reality in religion. Pride is strengthened in them; love\nof show, love of lightness and of pleasure are increased, and sacred\nthings are not discerned. They receive the impression that they have\nbeen too conscientious, too particular. For if those who live right at\nthe center of the great work are influenced so little by the solemn\ntruths so often presented, why should they be so particular? Why\nPride in the Young 161\nshould they be afraid of enjoying themselves, when this seemed to\nbe the aim of those who were of longer experience in -----?\nThe influence of the youth in ----- extends as far as they are\nknown, and their unconsecrated lives are proverbial; and none have\nhad more influence in the wrong direction than you. You have\ndishonored your profession and been miserable representatives of\nthe truth. Says the True Witness: \u201cI know thy works, that thou art\nneither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because [176]\nthou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out\nof My mouth.\u201d Were you cold, there would be some hope that you\nwould be converted; but where self-righteousness girds one about,\ninstead of the righteousness of Christ, the deception is so difficult to\nbe seen, and the self-righteousness so hard to be put away, that the\ncase is the most difficult to reach. An unconverted, godless sinner\nstands in a more favorable condition than such.\nYou are a stumbling block to sinners. Your lack of consecration\nis marked. You are scattering from Christ instead of gathering with\nHim. If God will help me to tear off your self-righteous garments, I\nwill have hope that you may yet redeem the time and lead exemplary\nlives. You have been frequently aroused, but as often have sunk\nback into your former do-nothing, self-righteous condition, having a\nname to live while you are dead. Your pride threatens to be your ruin.\nGod has spoken to you upon this point. If you make no reformation,\naffliction will come upon you, and your joy be turned to heaviness,\nuntil you humble your hearts under the hand of God. Your prayers\nGod does not accept. They come from hearts filled with pride and\nselfishness. You, my dear sister, are vain; you have lived an aimless\nlife, when, had you been humble and lived to bless others, you\nwould have been a blessing to yourself and to all around you. May\nGod forgive your parents and sisters for the part they have acted in\nmaking you what you are\u2014just that which God cannot accept, just\nthat which, if you remain the same, will be stubble for the fire to\nconsume in the day of God.\nWhen I was shown in regard to the spirit of selfishness existing\nin those who were working in the office, that there were some who\nwere merely working for wages, as though engaged in any common\nenterprise, you were both among the number. You were both selfish\nand self-caring. Your anxiety was to please yourselves and to obtain [177]\n162 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nhigher wages. This spirit has, to quite an extent, cursed the office,\nand Heaven frowns upon it. Many have been too eager to grasp\nmeans. All this is wrong. A worldly spirit has come in, and Christ\nhas been shut out. May God pity His people. And I hope you will\nbe converted.\nYou have possessed a spirit of levity, and have been vain and\ntrifling in your conversation. Oh, how seldom has Jesus been men-\ntioned! His redeeming love has not called forth gratitude and praise,\nand expressions calculated to magnify His name and His undying,\nself-sacrificing love. What has been the theme for your conversation?\nWhat thoughts have been dwelt upon with the greatest pleasure? In\ntruth it can be said that Jesus and His life of sacrifice, His exceeding\nprecious grace and the redemption He has so dearly earned for you,\nare scarcely in all your thoughts; but trifling things occupy the mind.\nTo please yourselves, to accomplish objects in life which suit your\npleasure, this is the burden of the mind. I can but wish you had not\nprofessed to be risen with Christ, for you have not complied with\nthe requirement. \u201cIf ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things\nwhich are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set\nyour affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are\ndead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.\u201d Ask yourselves the\nquestions: Have I complied with the requirements here laid down\nby the inspired apostle? Have I evidenced by my life, my death to\nthe world, that my life is hid with Christ in God? Am I submerged\nin Christ? Do I draw sustenance and support from Him who has\npromised to be to me a present help in every time of need? You have\na formal religion, but have not a special sense of your weakness,\nyour corruption, and your vileness by nature.\n\u201cA natural Christian!\u201d This deceptive idea has served many as[178]\na garment of self-righteousness, and has led many to a supposed\nhope in Christ, who had no experimental knowledge of Him, of His\nexperience, His trials, His life of self-denial and self-sacrifice. Their\nrighteousness which they count upon so much is only as filthy rags.\nSays Christ, the beloved Teacher: \u201cWhosoever will come after Me,\nlet him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\u201d Yes,\nfollow Him through evil as well as through good report. Follow Him\nin befriending the most needy and friendless. Follow Him in being\nforgetful of self, abundant in acts of self-denial and self-sacrifice to\nPride in the Young 163\ndo others good; when reviled, reviling not again; manifesting love\nand compassion for the fallen race. He counted not His life dear, but\ngave it up for us all. Follow Him from the lowly manger to the cross.\nHe was our example. He tells you that if you would be His disciple\nyou must take the cross, the despised cross, and follow Him. Can ye\ndrink of the cup? Can ye be baptized with the baptism?\nYour actions testify that you are strangers to Christ. \u201cDoth a\nfountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? Can\nthe fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so\ncan no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. Who is a wise man\nand endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good\nconversation his works with meekness of wisdom. But if ye have\nbitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against\nthe truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly,\nsensual, devilish. For where envying and strife is, there is confusion\nand every evil work. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure,\nthen peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and\ngood fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit\nof righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\u201d\nHere are enumerated the fruits which are marked evidences\nthat one who has been walking in the vigor of life has met with a [179]\nchange\u2014a change so marked as to be represented by death. From\nliving, active life, to death! What a striking figure! None need be\ndeceived here. If this transformation has not been experienced by\nyou, rest not. Seek the Lord with all your hearts. Make this the\nall-important business of your lives.\nYou have an account to render for the good you might have done\nduring your life, had you been in the position in which God required\nyou to be, and which He has made ample provision that you might\noccupy. But you have failed to glorify God upon the earth, and\nto save souls around you, because you did not avail yourselves of\nthat grace and strength, wisdom and knowledge, which Christ has\nprovided for you. You knew His will, but did it not. There will have\nto be a most manifest reformation in you both, or you will never\nhear from Jesus: \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant.\u201d\nIn the evening of June 12, after reading the foregoing to the\nchurch, I was shown that while you are careless, proud, selfish,\nand indifferent to the salvation of souls, death is doing its work.\n164 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nOne after another is leaving you, and passing to the grave. What\nhas been your influence over those who assembled in your social\ngatherings? What has been said or done to lead souls to Christ?\nHave you been instant in season, out of season, to do your whole\nduty? Are you ready to meet at the bar of God those with whom you\nhave mingled in your social gatherings, especially that class who\nhave been thrown under your influence and who have died out of\nChrist? Are you prepared to say that your skirts are clear of their\nblood? I will mention one case, that of Q. Will no reproach fall\nupon you from her, upon you who were surrounded with good home\ninfluences, you who had every favorable opportunity to develop\ngood Christian characters, but who have felt no burden for souls?\nPride, vanity, and love of pleasure were fostered by you, and you[180]\nacted your part in disgracing your profession and leading this poor\nsoul, who had been tossed about and buffeted by Satan, to doubt the\nreality of the truth and the genuineness of the Christian religion.\nYour frivolous conversation, in common with that of other of the\nyoung people, was disgusting. There was nothing noble and elevated\nin the turn your minds took. It was common chitchat and gossip, the\nsilly, vain laugh, the jesting, and the joking. Angels have written\nthe scenes you have acted over and over again. Notwithstanding the\nmost solemn appeals have been made to you, and you have been\nreproved, rebuked, and warned, you are more censurable than other\nyouth. You have had longer experience and greater knowledge of\nthe truth. You have lived the longest at -----. You were among the\nfirst to profess to believe the truth and to be Christ\u2019s followers, and\nyour course of vanity and pride has done more toward shaping the\nexperience of the youth in that place than has that of any of the\nothers. Those who have been converted to the truth you have taken\nby the hand, as it were, and united to the world.\nGreat guilt rests upon you and also upon your parents, who have\nflattered your pride and folly. They have sympathized with you\nwhen reproved, and have given you to understand that they thought\nit uncalled for. You, Sister O, have thought yourself handsome.\nYour parents have flattered you. You have sought acquaintance with\nunbelievers. Aside from your profession, your actions have been\nunbecoming a prudent, modest girl. But when it is taken into the\naccount that you profess to be a follower of the meek and lowly\nPride in the Young 165\nJesus, you have disgraced your profession. O my sister, did you\nthink those clerks could not see through the gloss you threw about\nyou? Did you think they were so captivated with your pretty face that\nthey could not see beneath the surface and read your true, superficial\ncharacter? When you placed upon your head the adorning borrowed [181]\nfrom Sister R\u2019s store, and then displayed yourself as if on exhibition\nbefore those clerks, did you think this was not discerned? Did you\nforget that angels of God were in attendance, and that their pure\neyes were reading your thoughts, the intents and purposes of the\nheart, and taking cognizance of every act, and delineating your true,\nfrivolous character? While you were engrossed with your small talk\nto the clerk with whom you were fascinated, because he flattered\nyour vanity, could you have stood before the looking glass you\nwould have seen the gestures, the whisperings, among those who\nwere observing you, and laughing because you were making such\na foolish show. You were bringing a stain upon the cause of truth.\nCould you have entered that store unobserved a short time after you\nstepped out, and have heard the conversation after you had lingered\nas long as decency would permit, you would have learned some\nthings you never thought of before. You would have been wounded\nand humbled to learn how you were viewed by even frivolous clerks.\nThe very one who flattered you to your face joined in the laugh and\nsport of his companions upon your vain course.\nYou might have an influence for good in ----- and honor your\nRedeemer. But instead of this you have made yourself the speech\nof flattering clerks and beardless youth. This unbecoming course\nhas been remarked by very many, and those who have noticed these\ninconsistencies, even though they may be unbelievers and profess\nrespect for you, despise you in their hearts. You are following in the\nfootsteps of S, and unless your parents awake and open their eyes to\nyour folly, they will share in your guilt. Sin is upon them and upon\nyour sisters for the course they have taken in fostering your pride\nand flattering your vanity. If you and your sisters were in a saved\nstate, you would all feel the perilous condition of the unsaved. The\nday will come, unless a great change is wrought in you, when you [182]\nwill hear from many lips. \u201cI associated with these Christians, yet\nthey never told me of my danger. They never warned me. I thought\nthat if I was in danger of being lost, they would not rest day or night\n166 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwithout arousing me to see my lost condition. Now I am lost. If I\nhad been in their place and had seen one in a similar condition, I\nwould not have rested until I had made them sensible of their state\nand pointed them to the only One who can save them.\u201d You have\nbeen good and pleasing servants of Satan while you have professed\nto be servants of Christ.\nSister O, you have been so exalted by the esteem you have had\nof yourself that you have had no just sense of the estimate observers\nhave placed upon your shallowness of character. They count you a\ncoquette, and you have justly earned this reputation. It would have\nbeen much more profitable for you to have heeded the exhortation\nof the apostle: \u201cWhose adorning let it not be that outward adorning;\n... but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not\ncorruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is\nin the sight of God of great price.\u201d\nYour parents have greatly failed in the education of their children.\nThey have suffered them to be released from burdens which it was\nhighly important for them to bear. Because they chose to please\nthemselves, they were permitted to remain in bed, dozing away the\nsweetest and loveliest hours of the morning, while their indulgent\nparents were up, toiling with life\u2019s burdens. These children have\nnot learned to resist their inclinations, to wrestle against their own\ndesires; they have not learned to endure hardness. They have been\nexcused in a great measure from home burdens, and this has been an\ninjury to them. They have never learned the act of self-denial or self-\nsacrifice. They would not submit to apply themselves to a task which\ndid not meet their taste. Their education is greatly deficient. Yet[183]\npride\u2014vain, vaunting pride\u2014fills their hearts. Sister O has thought\nherself superior to her associates, that they were not worthy of much\nattention and courtesy from her. With this she has a stubborn will\nto do about as she pleases regardless of the wishes, conveniences,\nand necessities of others. Her disposition is an unhappy one, which,\nunless entirely overcome, will cause many a shadow to darken her\npathway and embitter the lives of her best friends.\n* * * * *\nChapter 28\u2014Worldliness in the Church\nDear Brethren and Sisters in -----,\nJune 12, 1868, I was shown that the love of the world was to\na great extent taking the place of love to God. You are situated\nin a pleasant country, one that is favorable to worldly prosperity.\nThis places you where you are in constant danger of having your\ninterest swallowed up in the world, in laying up treasure upon the\nearth. Your hearts will be where your treasure is. You are situated\nwhere there are temptations to be plunging deeper and deeper into\nthe world, to be continually accumulating; and while you are thus\nengaged, the mind becomes engrossed with the cares of this life\nto such an extent as to shut out true godliness. But few realize the\ndeceitfulness of riches. Those who are anxious to acquire means\nare so bent upon this one object as to make the religion of Christ a\nsecondary matter. Spiritual things are not valued and are not sought\nafter, for the love of gain has eclipsed the heavenly treasure. If the\nprize of eternal life were to be valued by the zeal, perseverance,\nand earnestness exhibited by those who profess to be Christians,\nit would not be half as valuable as earthly possessions. Compare\nthe earnest effort made to obtain the things of this earth with the\nlanguid, weak, inefficient effort to gain spirituality and a heavenly [184]\ntreasure. No wonder that we experience so little of the illuminating\ninfluence from the heavenly sanctuary. Our desires are not in that\ndirection; they are mostly confined to earthly pursuits, seeking for\nworldly things, and neglecting the eternal. Prosperity is blinding\nthe eyes and deceiving the soul. God may speak, but the rubbish of\nearth prevents His voice from being heard.\nOur aged father T has his affections upon the things of this earth\nwhen they should be removed and he be ripening up for heaven. The\nlife that he now lives he should live by faith in the Son of God; his\naffections should be on the better land. He should have less and\nless interest in the perishable treasures of earth, while eternal things,\nwhich are of the greatest consequence, should engage his whole\n167\n168 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ninterest. The days of his probation are nearly ended. Oh, how little\ntime remains to devote to God! His energies are worn, his mind\nbroken, and at best his services must be weak; yet if given heartily\nand fully, they are wholly acceptable. With your age, Brother T, has\ncome an increase of selfishness and a more firm, earnest love for the\ntreasures of this poor world.\nSister T loves this world. She is naturally selfish. She has\nsuffered much with bodily infirmities. God permitted this affliction\nto come upon her, and yet would not permit Satan to take her life.\nGod designed through the furnace of affliction to loosen her grasp\nupon earthly treasures. Through suffering alone could this be done.\nShe is one of those whose systems have been poisoned by drugs.\nBy taking these she has ignorantly made herself what she is; yet\nGod did not suffer her life to be taken, but lengthened her years of\nprobation and suffering that she might become sanctified through the\ntruth, be purified, made white and tried, and, through the furnace of\naffliction, lose her dross, and become more precious than fine gold,\neven than the golden wedge of Ophir. Love of the world has become[185]\nso deeply rooted in the hearts of this brother and sister that it will\nrequire a severe trial to remove it. Dear brother and sister, you lack\ndevotion to God. You are insane in regard to worldly things. The\nworld has power to conform your mind to it, while the spiritual and\nheavenly do not bear with sufficient weight to transform the mind.\nMen and women in ----- who profess to be Christ\u2019s followers,\nwhy do you not follow Him? Why do you exhibit such insanity\nto acquire an earthly treasure, which misfortune can so easily re-\nmove, and neglect the riches of heaven, the immortal, imperishable\ntreasure?\nI was shown the case of Brother U\u2019s wife. She has a desire to\ndo right, but has failings which cause herself and her friends much\ntrouble. She talks too much. She lacks experience in the things of\nGod, and unless she is converted and transformed by the renewing of\nthe mind, she will be unable to stand amid the perils of the last days.\nHeart work is needed. Then the tongue will be sanctified. There\nis much talking which is sinful and should be avoided. She should\nset a strict watch before the door of her lips and keep her tongue as\nwith a bridle, that her words may not work wickedness. She should\ncease talking of others\u2019 faults, dwelling upon others\u2019 peculiarities,\nWorldliness in the Church 169\nand discovering others\u2019 infirmities. Such conversation is censurable\nin any person. It is unprofitable and positively sinful. It tends only\nto evil. The enemy knows that if this course is pursued by Christ\u2019s\nprofessed followers, it is opening a door for him to work.\nI saw that when sisters who are given to talk get together, Satan\nis generally present, for he finds employment. He stands by to excite\nthe mind and make the most of the advantage he has gained. He\nknows that all this gossip, and tale-bearing, and revealing of secrets,\nand dissecting of character, separate the soul from God. It is death\nto spirituality and a calm religious influence. Sister U sins greatly [186]\nwith her tongue. She ought by her words to have an influence for\ngood, but she frequently talks at random. Sometimes her words put\na different construction upon things than they will bear. Sometimes\nthere is exaggeration. Then there is misstatement. There is no\nintention to misstate, but the habit of much talking and talking upon\nthings that are unprofitable has been so long cherished that she has\nbecome careless and reckless in her words, and frequently does not\nknow what she is stating herself. This destroys any influence for\ngood she might have. It is time there was an entire reform in this\nrespect. Her society has not been prized as it would have been had\nshe not indulged in this sinful talking.\nChristians should be careful in regard to their words. They should\nnever carry unfavorable reports from one of their friends to another,\nespecially if they are aware that there is a lack of union between\nthem. It is cruel to hint and insinuate, as though you knew a great\ndeal in regard to this friend or that acquaintance of which others\nare ignorant. Such hints go further, and create more unfavorable\nimpressions, than to frankly relate the facts in an unexaggerated\nmanner. What harm has not the church of Christ suffered from these\nthings! The inconsistent, unguarded course of her members has\nmade her weak as water. Confidence has been betrayed by members\nof the same church, and yet the guilty did not design to do mischief.\nLack of wisdom in the selection of subjects of conversation has done\nmuch harm. The conversation should be upon spiritual and divine\nthings; but it has been otherwise. If the association with Christian\nfriends is chiefly devoted to the improvement of the mind and heart,\nthere will be no after regrets, and they can look back on the interview\nwith a pleasant satisfaction. But if the hours are spent in levity and\n170 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nvain talking, and the precious time is employed in dissecting the\nlives and character of others, the friendly intercourse will prove a[187]\nsource of evil, and your influence will be a savor of death unto death.\nI cannot distinctly call to mind all the persons in your church who\nwere shown me; but I saw that many had a great work to perform.\nThere is too much talking by nearly all, and too little meditation\nand prayer. With many there is too much selfishness. The mind\nis devoted to self and not to the good of others. Satan\u2019s power is\nupon you in a great degree. Yet there are precious lights among you,\nand those who are seeking to walk according to the will of God.\nPride and the love of the world are the snares which are so great a\nhindrance to spirituality and a growth in grace.\nThis world is not the Christian\u2019s heaven, but merely the workshop\nof God, where we are to be fitted up to unite with sinless angels\nin a holy heaven. We should be constantly training the mind to\nnoble, unselfish thoughts. This education is necessary to so bring\ninto exercise the powers which God has given us that His name shall\nbest be glorified upon the earth. We are accountable for all the noble\nqualities which God has given us, and to put these faculties to a use\nHe never designed we should is showing base ingratitude to Him.\nThe service of God demands all the powers of our being, and we fail\nof meeting the design of God unless we bring these powers to a high\nstate of cultivation, and educate the mind to love to contemplate\nheavenly things, and strengthen and ennoble the energies of the soul\nby right actions, operating to the glory of God.\nWomen professing godliness generally fail to train the mind.\nThey leave it uncontrolled, to go where it will. This is a great\nmistake. Many seem to have no mental power. They have not\neducated the mind to think; and because they have not done this,\nthey suppose they cannot. Meditation and prayer are necessary to a\ngrowth in grace. Why there is no more stability among women is\nbecause of so little mental culture, so little reflection. Leaving the[188]\nmind in a state of inaction, they lean upon others to do the brainwork,\nto plan, and think, and remember for them, and thus grow more and\nmore inefficient. Some need to discipline the mind by exercise.\nThey should force it to think. While they depend upon someone\nto think for them, to solve their difficulties, and they refuse to tax\nthe mind with thought, the inability to remember, to look ahead\nWorldliness in the Church 171\nand discriminate, will continue. Efforts must be made by every\nindividual to educate the mind.\nI was shown that Brother V should seek for more spirituality.\nYou do not possess that calm trust in God which He requires you to\nhave. You do not train the mind to run in the channel of spirituality.\nYou indulge in too much vain, unnecessary talk, which injures your\nown soul and injures your influence. You must encourage calmness\nand fortitude of mind. You are easily excited; you have strong\nfeelings, and express in strong terms your likes and dislikes. You\nneed more good religion to have a soothing influence upon you. You\nhave been invited to learn of Christ, who is meek and lowly of heart.\nPrecious lesson! If well learned, it will transform the whole life.\nLightness and cheap talk are injurious to your spiritual advancement.\nYou should seek after perfection of character and let your influence\ntell for God in your words and acts. You need to earnestly seek\nthe Lord and to take a deeper draught at the fountain of truth, that\nits influence may sanctify your life. Your mind is too much on the\nworld. You should have your interest in the better life than this.\nYou have no time to lose; make haste and improve the few hours of\nprobation.\nYour wife has had too much pride and selfishness. God has been\nbringing her through the furnace of affliction to remove these spots\nfrom her character. She must be very careful that the fire of affliction\ndoes not kindle upon her in vain. It should remove the dross and [189]\nbring her nearer to God, making her more spiritual. Her love of\nthe world must die. Love of self must be overcome and her will\nswallowed up in the will of God.\nI was shown that love of the world has to a great extent shut\nJesus from the church. God calls for a change, a surrender of all to\nHim. Unless the mind is educated to dwell upon religious themes,\nit will be weak and feeble in this direction. But while dwelling\nupon worldly enterprises, it will be strong; for in this direction it has\nbeen cultivated, and has strengthened with exercise. The reason it\nis so difficult for men and women to live religious lives is because\nthey do not exercise the mind unto godliness. It is trained to run\nin an opposite direction. Unless the mind is constantly exercised\nin obtaining spiritual knowledge and in seeking to understand the\nmystery of godliness, it is incapable of appreciating eternal things\n172 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nbecause it has no experience in that direction. This is the reason why\nnearly all consider it uphill business to serve the Lord.\nWhen the heart is divided, dwelling principally upon things of\nthe world, and but little upon the things of God, there can be no\nspecial increase of spiritual strength. Worldly enterprises claim the\nlarger share of the mind, calling into exercise its powers; therefore in\nthis direction there is strength and power to claim more and more of\nthe interest and affections, while less and less is reserved to devote\nto God. It is impossible for the soul to flourish while prayer is not a\nspecial exercise of the mind. Family or public prayer alone is not\nsufficient. Secret prayer is very important; in solitude the soul is laid\nbare to the inspecting eye of God, and every motive is scrutinized.\nSecret prayer! How precious! The soul communing with God!\nSecret prayer is to be heard only by the prayer-hearing God. No\ncurious ear is to receive the burden of such petitions. In secret prayer[190]\nthe soul is free from surrounding influences, free from excitement.\nCalmly, yet fervently, will it reach out after God. Secret prayer is\nfrequently perverted, and its sweet designs lost, by loud vocal prayer.\nInstead of the calm, quiet trust and faith in God, the soul drawn out in\nlow, humble tones, the voice is raised to a loud pitch, and excitement\nis encouraged, and secret prayer loses its softening, sacred influence.\nThere is a storm of feeling, a storm of words, making it impossible\nto discern the still, small voice that speaks to the soul while engaged\nin its secret, true, heartfelt devotion. Secret prayer, properly carried\nout, is productive of great good. But prayer which is made public to\nthe entire family and neighborhood is not secret prayer, even though\nthought to be, and divine strength is not received from it. Sweet\nand abiding will be the influence emanating from Him who seeth\nin secret, whose ear is open to answer the prayer arising from the\nheart. By calm, simple faith the soul holds communion with God\nand gathers to itself divine rays of light to strengthen and sustain it\nto endure the conflicts of Satan. God is our tower of strength.\nJesus has left us word: \u201cWatch ye therefore: for ye know not\nwhen the Master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or\nat the cockcrowing, or in the morning: lest coming suddenly He\nfind you sleeping. And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.\u201d\nWe are waiting and watching for the return of the Master, who is to\nbring the morning, lest coming suddenly He find us sleeping. What\nWorldliness in the Church 173\ntime is here referred to? Not to the revelation of Christ in the clouds\nof heaven to find a people asleep. No; but to His return from His\nministration in the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary, when\nHe lays off His priestly attire and clothes Himself with garments of\nvengeance, and when the mandate goes forth: \u201cHe that is unjust, let\nhim be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and\nhe that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let [191]\nhim be holy still.\u201d\nWhen Jesus ceases to plead for man, the cases of all are forever\ndecided. This is the time of reckoning with His servants. To those\nwho have neglected the preparation of purity and holiness, which\nfits them to be waiting ones to welcome their Lord, the sun sets in\ngloom and darkness, and rises not again. Probation closes; Christ\u2019s\nintercessions cease in heaven. This time finally comes suddenly\nupon all, and those who have neglected to purify their souls by\nobeying the truth are found sleeping. They became weary of waiting\nand watching; they became indifferent in regard to the coming of\ntheir Master. They longed not for His appearing, and thought there\nwas no need of such continued, persevering watching. They had\nbeen disappointed in their expectations and might be again. They\nconcluded that there was time enough yet to arouse. They would be\nsure not to lose the opportunity of securing an earthly treasure. It\nwould be safe to get all of this world they could. And in securing\nthis object, they lost all anxiety and interest in the appearing of the\nMaster. They became indifferent and careless, as though His coming\nwere yet in the distance. But while their interest was buried up in\ntheir worldly gains, the work closed in the heavenly sanctuary, and\nthey were unprepared.\nIf such had only known that the work of Christ in the heavenly\nsanctuary would close so soon, how differently would they have\nconducted themselves, how earnestly would they have watched! The\nMaster, anticipating all this, gives them timely warning in the com-\nmand to watch. He distinctly states the suddenness of His coming.\nHe does not measure the time, lest we shall neglect a momentary\npreparation, and in our indolence look ahead to the time when we\nthink He will come, and defer the preparation. \u201cWatch ye therefore:\nfor ye know not.\u201d Yet this foretold uncertainty, and suddenness at [192]\nlast, fails to rouse us from stupidity to earnest wakefulness, and to\n174 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nquicken our watchfulness for our expected Master. Those not found\nwaiting and watching are finally surprised in their unfaithfulness.\nThe Master comes, and instead of their being ready to open unto\nHim immediately, they are locked in worldly slumber, and are lost\nat last.\nA company was presented before me in contrast to the one de-\nscribed. They were waiting and watching. Their eyes were directed\nheavenward, and the words of their Master were upon their lips:\n\u201cWhat I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.\u201d \u201cWatch ye therefore:\nfor ye know not when the Master of the house cometh, at even, or\nat midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: lest coming\nsuddenly He find you sleeping.\u201d The Lord intimates a delay before\nthe morning finally dawns. But He would not have them give way to\nweariness, nor relax their earnest watchfulness, because the morning\ndoes not open upon them as soon as they expected. The waiting ones\nwere represented to me as looking upward. They were encouraging\none another by repeating these words: \u201cThe first and second watches\nare past. We are in the third watch, waiting and watching for the\nMaster\u2019s return. There remains but a little period of watching now.\u201d\nI saw some becoming weary; their eyes were directed downward,\nand they were engrossed with earthly things, and were unfaithful in\nwatching. They were saying: \u201cIn the first watch we expected our\nMaster, but were disappointed. We thought surely He would come\nin the second watch, but that passed, and He came not. We may be\nagain disappointed. We need not be so particular. He may not come\nin the following watch. We are in the third watch, and now we think\nit best to lay up our treasure on the earth, that we may be secure\nagainst want.\u201d Many were sleeping, stupefied with the cares of this\nlife and allured by the deceitfulness of riches from their waiting,\nwatching position.\nAngels were represented to me as looking on with intense interest[193]\nto mark the appearance of the weary yet faithful watchers, lest they\nbe too sorely tried, and sink under the toil and hardships made doubly\nsevere because their brethren had been diverted from their watch, and\nbecome drunk with worldly cares and beguiled by worldly prosperity.\nThese heavenly angels grieved that those who were once watching\nshould, by their indolence and unfaithfulness, increase the trial and\nWorldliness in the Church 175\nburdens of those who were earnestly and perseveringly endeavoring\nto maintain their waiting, watching position.\nI saw that it was impossible to have the affections and interests\nengrossed in worldly cares, to be increasing earthly possessions,\nand yet be in a waiting, watching position, as our Saviour has com-\nmanded. Said the angel: \u201cThey can secure but one world. In order to\nacquire the heavenly treasure, they must sacrifice the earthly. They\ncannot have both worlds.\u201d I saw how necessary a continuance of\nfaithfulness in watching was in order to escape the delusive snares\nof Satan. He leads those who should be waiting and watching, to\ntake an advance step toward the world; they have no intention of\ngoing further, but that one step removed them that much further\nfrom Jesus, and made it easier to take the next; and thus step after\nstep is taken toward the world, until all the difference between them\nand the world is a profession, a name only. They have lost their\npeculiar, holy character, and there is nothing except their profession\nto distinguish them from the lovers of the world around them.\nI saw that watch after watch was in the past. Because of this,\nshould there be a lack of vigilance? Oh, no! There is the greater\nnecessity of unceasing watchfulness, for now the moments are fewer\nthan before the passing of the first watch. Now the period of waiting\nis necessarily shorter than at first. If we watched with unabated\nvigilance then, how much more need of double watchfulness in the [194]\nsecond watch. The passing of the second watch has brought us to\nthe third, and now it is inexcusable to abate our watchfulness. The\nthird watch calls for threefold earnestness. To become impatient now\nwould be to lose all our earnest, persevering watching heretofore.\nThe long night of gloom is trying; but the morning is deferred in\nmercy, because if the Master should come, so many would be found\nunready. God\u2019s unwillingness to have His people perish has been\nthe reason for so long delay. But the coming of the morning to\nthe faithful, and of the night to the unfaithful, is right upon us. By\nwaiting and watching, God\u2019s people are to manifest their peculiar\ncharacter, their separation from the world. By our watching position\nwe are to show that we are truly strangers and pilgrims upon the\nearth. The difference between those who love the world and those\nwho love Christ is so plain as to be unmistakable. While worldlings\nare all earnestness and ambition to secure earthly treasure, God\u2019s\n176 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\npeople are not conformed to the world, but show by their earnest,\nwatching, waiting position that they are transformed; that their home\nis not in this world, but that they are seeking a better country, even a\nheavenly.\nI hope, my dear brethren and sisters, that you will not pass your\neye over these words without thoroughly considering their import.\nAs the men of Galilee stood looking steadfastly toward heaven, to\ncatch, if possible, a glimpse of their ascending Saviour, two men in\nwhite apparel, heavenly angels commissioned to comfort them for\nthe loss of the presence of their Saviour, stood by them and inquired:\n\u201cYe men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same\nJesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like\nmanner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.\u201d\nGod designs that His people shall fix their eyes heavenward,\nlooking for the glorious appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus\nChrist. While the attention of worldlings is turned to various enter-[195]\nprises, ours should be to the heavens; our faith should reach further\nand further into the glorious mysteries of the heavenly treasure,\ndrawing the precious, divine rays of light from the heavenly sanctu-\nary to shine in our hearts, as they shine upon the face of Jesus. The\nscoffers mock the waiting, watching ones, and inquire: \u201cWhere is\nthe promise of His coming? You have been disappointed. Engage\nnow with us, and you will prosper in worldly things. Get gain, get\nmoney, and be honored of the world.\u201d The waiting ones look upward\nand answer: \u201cWe are watching.\u201d And by turning from earthly plea-\nsure and worldly fame, and from the deceitfulness of riches, they\nshow themselves to be in that position. By watching they become\nstrong; they overcome sloth and selfishness and love of ease. Afflic-\ntion\u2019s fire kindles upon them, and the waiting time seems long. They\nsometimes grieve, and faith falters; but they rally again, overcome\ntheir fears and doubts, and while their eyes are directed heavenward,\nsay to their adversaries: \u201cI am watching, I am waiting the return of\nmy Lord. I will glory in tribulation, in affliction, in necessities.\u201d\nThe desire of our Lord is that we should be watching, so that\nwhen He cometh and knocketh we may open to Him immediately. A\nblessing is pronounced upon those servants whom He finds watching.\n\u201cHe shall gird Himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and\nwill come forth and serve them.\u201d Who among us in these last days\nWorldliness in the Church 177\nwill be thus specially honored by the Master of assemblies? Are we\nprepared without delay to open to Him immediately and welcome\nHim in? Watch, watch, watch. Nearly all have ceased their watching\nand waiting; we are not ready to open to Him immediately. The\nlove of the world has so occupied our thoughts that our eyes are\nnot turned upward, but downward to the earth. We are hurrying\nabout, engaging with zeal and earnestness in different enterprises,\nbut God is forgotten, and the heavenly treasure is not valued. We are [196]\nnot in a waiting, watching position. The love of the world and the\ndeceitfulness of riches eclipse our faith, and we do not long for, and\nlove, the appearing of our Saviour. We try too hard to take care of\nself ourselves. We are uneasy and greatly lack a firm trust in God.\nMany worry and work, contrive and plan, fearing they may suffer\nneed. They cannot afford time to pray or to attend religious meetings\nand, in their care for themselves, leave no chance for God to care for\nthem. And the Lord does not do much for them, for they give Him\nno opportunity. They do too much for themselves, and believe and\ntrust in God too little.\nThe love of the world has a terrible hold upon the people whom\nthe Lord has commanded to watch and pray always, lest coming\nsuddenly He find them sleeping. \u201cLove not the world, neither the\nthings that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love\nof the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of\nthe flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the\nFather, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust\nthereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.\u201d\nI have been shown that God\u2019s people who profess to believe\npresent truth are not in a waiting, watching position. They are\nincreasing in riches and are laying up their treasures upon the earth.\nThey are becoming rich in worldly things, but not rich toward God.\nThey do not believe in the shortness of time; they do not believe\nthat the end of all things is at hand, that Christ is at the door. They\nmay profess much faith; but they deceive their own souls, for they\nwill act out all the faith that they really possess. Their works show\nthe character of their faith and testify to those around them that\nthe coming of Christ is not to be in this generation. According to\ntheir faith will be their works. Their preparations are being made to\nremain in this world. They are adding house to house, and land to [197]\n178 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nland, and are citizens of this world.\nThe condition of poor Lazarus feeding upon the crumbs from\nthe rich man\u2019s table is preferable to that of these professors. If they\npossessed genuine faith, instead of increasing their treasures upon\nthe earth they would be selling off, freeing themselves from the\ncumbersome things of earth and transferring their treasure before\nthem to heaven. Then their interest and hearts will be there, for the\nheart of man will be where his greatest treasure is. Most of those\nwho profess to believe the truth testify that that which they value the\nmost is in this world. For this they have care, wearing anxiety, and\nlabor. To preserve and add to their treasure is the study of their lives.\nThey have transferred so little to heaven, have taken so little stock\nin the heavenly treasure, that their minds are not specially attracted\nto that better country. They have taken large stock in the enterprises\nof this earth, and these investments, like the magnet, draw down\ntheir minds from the heavenly and imperishable to the earthly and\ncorruptible. \u201cWhere your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\u201d\nSelfishness girds many about as with iron bands. It is \u201cmy\nfarm,\u201d \u201cmy goods,\u201d \u201cmy trade,\u201d \u201cmy merchandise.\u201d Even the claims\nof common humanity are disregarded by them. Men and women\nprofessing to be waiting and loving the appearing of their Lord\nare shut up to self. The noble, the godlike, they have parted with.\nThe love of the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,\nthe pride of life, have so fastened upon them that they are blinded.\nThey are corrupted by the world and discern it not. They talk of\nlove to God, but their fruits show not the love they express. They\nrob Him in tithes and offerings, and the withering curse of God is\nupon them. The truth has been illuminating their pathway on every\nside. God has wrought wonderfully in the salvation of souls in their\nown households, but where are their offerings, presented to Him in\ngrateful thanks for all His tokens of mercy to them? Many of them[198]\nare as unthankful as the brute creation. The sacrifice for man was\ninfinite, beyond the comprehension of the strongest intellect, yet\nmen who claim to be partakers of these heavenly benefits, which\nwere brought to them at so great a cost, are too thoroughly selfish to\nmake any real sacrifice for God. Their minds are upon the world, the\nworld, the world. In the forty-ninth psalm we read: \u201cThey that trust\nin their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;\nWorldliness in the Church 179\nnone of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God\na ransom for him (for the redemption of their soul is precious, and\nit ceaseth forever).\u201d If all would bear in mind, and could in a small\ndegree appreciate, the immense sacrifice made by Christ, they would\nfeel rebuked for their fearfulness and their supreme selfishness. \u201cOur\nGod shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before\nHim, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him. He shall\ncall to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that He may judge\nHis people. Gather My saints together unto Me; those that have\nmade a covenant with Me by sacrifice.\u201d Because of selfishness and\nlove of the world, God is forgotten, and many have barrenness of\nsoul, and cry: \u201cMy leanness, my leanness.\u201d The Lord has lent means\nto His people to prove them, to test the depth of their professed love\nfor Him. Some would let go of Him and give up their heavenly\ntreasure rather than to decrease their earthly possessions and make a\ncovenant with Him by sacrifice. He calls for them to sacrifice; but\nthe love of the world closes their ears, and they will not hear.\nI looked to see who of those who professed to be looking for\nChrist\u2019s coming possessed a willingness to sacrifice offerings to God\nof their abundance. I could see a few humble poor ones who, like\nthe poor widow, were stinting themselves and casting in their mite.\nEvery such offering is accounted of God as precious treasure. But [199]\nthose who are acquiring means, and adding to their possessions, are\nfar behind. They do comparatively nothing to what they might. They\nare withholding, and robbing God, for they are fearful they shall\ncome to want. They dare not trust God. This is one of the reasons\nthat, as a people, we are so sickly and so many are falling into their\ngraves. The covetous are among us. Lovers of the world, also those\nwho have stinted the laborer in his hire, are among us. Men who\nhad none of this world, who were poor and dependent on their labor,\nhave been dealt with closely and unjustly. The lover of the world,\nwith a hard face and harder heart, has grudgingly paid over the small\nsum earned by hard toil. Just so they are dealing with their Master,\nwhose servants they profess to be. Just in this grudging manner do\nthey put into the treasury of God. The man in the parable had not\nwhere to bestow his goods, and the Lord cut short his unprofitable\nlife. So will He deal with many. How difficult, in this corrupt age,\nto keep from growing worldly and selfish. How easy to become\n180 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nungrateful to the Giver of all our mercies. Great watchfulness is\nneeded, and much prayer, to keep the soul with all diligence. \u201cTake\nye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.\u201d\nNumber Seventeen\u2014Testimony for the [200]\nChurch\nChapter 29\u2014The Sufferings of Christ\nIn order to fully realize the value of salvation, it is necessary\nto understand what it cost. In consequence of limited ideas of the\nsufferings of Christ, many place a low estimate upon the great work\nof the atonement. The glorious plan of man\u2019s salvation was brought\nabout through the infinite love of God the Father. In this divine\nplan is seen the most marvelous manifestation of the love of God\nto the fallen race. Such love as is manifested in the gift of God\u2019s\nbeloved Son amazed the holy angels. \u201cGod so loved the world, that\nHe gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him\nshould not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d This Saviour was the\nbrightness of His Father\u2019s glory and the express image of His person.\nHe possessed divine majesty, perfection, and excellence. He was\nequal with God. \u201cIt pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness\ndwell.\u201d \u201cWho, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to\nbe equal with God: but made Himself of no reputation, and took\nupon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of\nmen: and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself,\nand became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\u201d\nChrist consented to die in the sinner\u2019s stead, that man, by a life[201]\nof obedience, might escape the penalty of the law of God. His death\ndid not make the law of none effect; it did not slay the law, lessen\nits holy claims, nor detract from its sacred dignity. The death of\nChrist proclaimed the justice of His Father\u2019s law in punishing the\ntransgressor, in that He consented to suffer the penalty of the law\nHimself in order to save fallen man from its curse. The death of\nGod\u2019s beloved Son on the cross shows the immutability of the law of\nGod. His death magnifies the law and makes it honorable, and gives\nevidence to man of its changeless character. From His own divine\nlips are heard the words: \u201cThink not that I am come to destroy the\nlaw, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.\u201d The\ndeath of Christ justified the claims of the law.\n182\nSufferings of Christ 183\nIn Christ were united the human and the divine. His mission was\nto reconcile God and man, to unite the finite with the infinite. This\nwas the only way in which fallen men could be exalted through the\nmerits of the blood of Christ to be partakers of the divine nature.\nTaking human nature fitted Christ to understand man\u2019s trials and\nsorrows, and all the temptations wherewith he is beset. Angels who\nwere unacquainted with sin could not sympathize with man in his\npeculiar trials. Christ condescended to take man\u2019s nature and was\ntempted in all points like as we, that He might know how to succor\nall who should be tempted.\nAs the human was upon Him, He felt His need of strength from\nHis Father. He had select places of prayer. He loved to hold commu-\nnion with His Father in the solitude of the mountain. In this exercise\nHis holy, human soul was strengthened for the duties and trials of\nthe day. Our Saviour identifies Himself with our needs and weak-\nnesses, in that He became a suppliant, a nightly petitioner, seeking\nfrom His Father fresh supplies of strength, to come forth invigorated\nand refreshed, braced for duty and trial. He is our example in all [202]\nthings. He is a brother in our infirmities, but not in possessing like\npassions. As the sinless One, His nature recoiled from evil. He\nendured struggles and torture of soul in a world of sin. His humanity\nmade prayer a necessity and privilege. He required all the stronger\ndivine support and comfort which His Father was ready to impart to\nHim, to Him who had, for the benefit of man, left the joys of heaven\nand chosen His home in a cold and thankless world. Christ found\ncomfort and joy in communion with His Father. Here He could\nunburden His heart of the sorrows that were crushing Him. He was\na man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.\nThrough the day He labored earnestly to do good to others,\nto save men from destruction. He healed the sick, comforted the\nmourning, and brought cheerfulness and hope to the despairing. He\nbrought the dead to life. After His work was finished for the day, He\nwent forth, evening after evening, away from the confusion of the\ncity, and His form was bowed in some retired grove in supplication\nto His Father. At times the bright beams of the moon shone upon\nHis bowed form. And then again the clouds and darkness shut away\nall light. The dew and frost of night rested upon His head and beard\nwhile in the attitude of a suppliant. He frequently continued His\n184 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\npetitions through the entire night. He is our example. If we could\nremember this, and imitate Him, we would be much stronger in God.\nIf the Saviour of men, with His divine strength, felt the need\nof prayer, how much more should feeble, sinful mortals feel the\nnecessity of prayer\u2014fervent, constant prayer! When Christ was the\nmost fiercely beset by temptation, He ate nothing. He committed\nHimself to God and, through earnest prayer and perfect submission\nto the will of His Father, came off conqueror. Those who profess\nthe truth for these last days, above every other class of professed[203]\nChristians, should imitate the great Exemplar in prayer.\n\u201cIt is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the\nservant as his lord.\u201d Our tables are frequently spread with luxuries\nneither healthful nor necessary, because we love these things more\nthan we love self-denial, freedom from disease, and soundness of\nmind. Jesus sought earnestly for strength from His Father. This\nthe divine Son of God considered of more value, even for Himself,\nthan to sit at the most luxurious table. He has given us evidence\nthat prayer is essential in order to receive strength to contend with\nthe powers of darkness, and to do the work allotted us. Our own\nstrength is weakness, but that which God gives is mighty and will\nmake everyone who obtains it more than conqueror.\nAs the Son of God bowed in the attitude of prayer in the Garden\nof Gethsemane, the agony of His spirit forced from His pores sweat\nlike great drops of blood. It was here that the horror of great darkness\nsurrounded Him. The sins of the world were upon Him. He was\nsuffering in man\u2019s stead as a transgressor of His Father\u2019s law. Here\nwas the scene of temptation. The divine light of God was receding\nfrom His vision, and He was passing into the hands of the powers of\ndarkness. In His soul anguish He lay prostrate on the cold earth. He\nwas realizing His Father\u2019s frown. He had taken the cup of suffering\nfrom the lips of guilty man, and proposed to drink it Himself, and in\nits place give to man the cup of blessing. The wrath that would have\nfallen upon man was now falling upon Christ. It was here that the\nmysterious cup trembled in His hand.\nJesus had often resorted to Gethsemane with His disciples for\nmeditation and prayer. They were all well acquainted with this sacred\nretreat. Even Judas knew where to lead the murderous throng, that\nhe might betray Jesus into their hands. Never before had the Saviour[204]\nSufferings of Christ 185\nvisited the spot with a heart so full of sorrow. It was not bodily\nsuffering from which the Son of God shrank, and which wrung from\nHis lips, in the presence of His disciples, these mournful words:\n\u201cMy soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.\u201d \u201cTarry ye here,\u201d\nsaid He, \u201cand watch with Me.\u201d\nLeaving His disciples within hearing of His voice, He went a\nlittle distance from them and fell on His face and prayed. His soul\nwas agonized, and He pleaded: \u201cO My Father, if it be possible, let\nthis cup pass from Me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\u201d\nThe sins of a lost world were upon Him and overwhelming Him.\nIt was a sense of His Father\u2019s frown, in consequence of sin, which\nrent His heart with such piercing agony and forced from His brow\ngreat drops of blood, which, rolling down His pale cheeks, fell to\nthe ground, moistening the earth.\nRising from His prostrate position, He came to His disciples and\nfound them sleeping. He said unto Peter: \u201cWhat, could ye not watch\nwith Me one hour? Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation:\nthe spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\u201d At the most\nimportant time\u2014the time when Jesus had made a special request\nfor them to watch with Him\u2014the disciples were found sleeping. He\nknew that severe conflicts and terrible temptations were before them.\nHe had taken them with Him that they might be a strength to Him,\nand that the events they should witness that night, and the lessons\nof instruction they should receive, might be indelibly printed upon\ntheir memories. This was necessary that their faith might not fail,\nbut be strengthened for the test just before them.\nBut instead of watching with Christ, they were burdened with\nsorrow, and fell asleep. Even the ardent Peter, who, only a few hours\nbefore, had declared that he would suffer and, if need be, die for\nhis Lord, was asleep. At the most critical moment, when the Son [205]\nof God was in need of their sympathy and heartfelt prayers, they\nwere found asleep. They lost much by thus sleeping. Our Saviour\ndesigned to fortify them for the severe test of their faith to which\nthey would soon be subjected. If they had spent that mournful period\nin watching with the dear Saviour, and in prayer to God, Peter would\nnot have been left to his own feeble strength to deny his Lord in the\ntime of trial.\n186 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nThe Son of God went away the second time, and prayed, saying:\n\u201cO My Father, if this cup may not pass away from Me, except I drink\nit, Thy will be done.\u201d And again He came to His disciples and found\nthem sleeping. Their eyes were heavy. By these sleeping disciples\nis represented a sleeping church, when the day of God\u2019s visitation\nis nigh. It is a time of clouds and thick darkness, when to be found\nasleep is most perilous.\nJesus has left us this warning: \u201cWatch ye therefore: for ye know\nnot when the Master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight,\nor at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: lest coming suddenly\nHe find you sleeping.\u201d The church of God is required to fulfill her\nnight watch, however perilous, whether long or short. Sorrow is\nno excuse for her to be less watchful. Tribulation should not lead\nto carelessness, but to double vigilance. Christ has directed the\nchurch by His own example to the Source of their strength in times\nof need, distress, and peril. The attitude of watching is to designate\nthe church as God\u2019s people indeed. By this sign the waiting ones are\ndistinguished from the world and show that they are pilgrims and\nstrangers upon the earth.\nAgain the Saviour turned sadly from His sleeping disciples, and\nprayed the third time, saying the same words. Then He came to\nthem and said: \u201cSleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour\nis at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\u201d\nHow cruel for the disciples to permit sleep to close their eyes, and\nslumber to chain their senses, while their divine Lord was enduring[206]\nsuch inexpressible mental anguish! If they had remained watching\nthey would not have lost their faith as they beheld the Son of God\ndying upon the cross. This important night watch should have been\nsignalized by noble mental struggles and prayers, which would have\nbrought them strength to witness the unspeakable agony of the Son\nof God. It would have prepared them, as they should behold His\nsufferings upon the cross, to understand something of the nature\nof the overpowering anguish which He endured in the Garden of\nGethsemane. And they would have been better able to recall the\nwords He had spoken to them in reference to His sufferings, death,\nand resurrection; and, amid the gloom of that terrible, trying hour,\nsome rays of hope would have lighted up the darkness and sustained\ntheir faith.\nSufferings of Christ 187\nChrist had told them before that these things would take place,\nbut they did not understand Him. The scene of His sufferings was to\nbe a fiery ordeal to His disciples, hence the necessity of watchfulness\nand prayer. Their faith needed to be sustained by an unseen strength\nas they should experience the triumph of the powers of darkness.\nWe can have but faint conceptions of the inexpressible anguish of\nGod\u2019s dear Son in Gethsemane, as He realized His separation from\nHis Father in consequence of bearing man\u2019s sin. He became sin for\nthe fallen race. The sense of the withdrawal of His Father\u2019s love\npressed from His anguished soul these mournful words: \u201cMy soul is\nexceeding sorrowful, even unto death.\u201d \u201cIf it be possible, let this cup\npass from Me.\u201d Then with entire submission to His Father\u2019s will, He\nadds: \u201cNevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\u201d\nThe divine Son of God was fainting, dying. The Father sent\na messenger from His presence to strengthen the divine Sufferer\nand brace Him to tread His bloodstained path. Could mortals have [207]\nviewed the amazement and the sorrow of the angelic host as they\nwatched in silent grief the Father separating His beams of light, love,\nand glory from the beloved Son of His bosom, they would better\nunderstand how offensive sin is in His sight. The sword of justice\nwas now to awake against His dear Son. He was betrayed by a kiss\ninto the hands of His enemies, and hurried to the judgment hall of\nan earthly court, there to be derided and condemned to death by\nsinful mortals. There the glorious Son of God was \u201cwounded for our\ntransgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities.\u201d He bore insult,\nmockery, and shameful abuse, until \u201cHis visage was so marred more\nthan any man, and His form more than the sons of men.\u201d\nWho can comprehend the love here displayed! The angelic host\nbeheld with wonder and with grief Him who had been the Majesty\nof heaven, and who had worn the crown of glory, now wearing the\ncrown of thorns, a bleeding victim to the rage of an infuriated mob,\nfired to insane madness by the wrath of Satan. Behold the patient\nSufferer! Upon His head is the thorny crown. His lifeblood flows\nfrom every lacerated vein. All this in consequence of sin! Nothing\ncould have induced Christ to leave His honor and majesty in heaven,\nand come to a sinful world, to be neglected, despised, and rejected\nby those He came to save, and finally to suffer upon the cross, but\neternal, redeeming love, which will ever remain a mystery.\n188 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nWonder, O heavens, and be astonished, O earth! Behold the\noppressor and the oppressed! A vast multitude enclose the Saviour of\nthe world. Mockings and jeerings are mingled with the coarse oaths\nof blasphemy. His lowly birth and humble life are commented upon\nby unfeeling wretches. His claim to be the Son of God is ridiculed by\nthe chief priests and elders, and vulgar jests and insulting derision\nare passed from lip to lip. Satan was having full control of the\nminds of his servants. In order to do this effectually, he commences[208]\nwith the chief priests and elders, and imbues them with religious\nfrenzy. They are actuated by the same satanic spirit which moves\nthe most vile and hardened wretches. There is a corrupt harmony in\nthe feelings of all, from the hypocritical priests and elders down to\nthe most debased. Christ, the precious Son of God, was led forth,\nand the cross was laid upon His shoulders. At every step was left\nblood which flowed from His wounds. Thronged by an immense\ncrowd of bitter enemies and unfeeling spectators, He is led away to\nthe crucifixion. \u201cHe was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He\nopened not His mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter,\nand as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His\nmouth.\u201d\nHis sorrowing disciples follow Him at a distance, behind the\nmurderous throng. He is nailed to the cross, and hangs suspended\nbetween the heavens and the earth. Their hearts are bursting with\nanguish as their beloved Teacher is suffering as a criminal. Close to\nthe cross are the blind, bigoted, faithless priests and elders, taunting,\nmocking, and jeering: \u201cThou that destroyest the temple, and buildest\nit in three days, save Thyself. If Thou be the Son of God, come down\nfrom the cross. Likewise also the chief priests mocking Him, with\nthe scribes and elders, said, He saved others; Himself He cannot\nsave. If He be the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the\ncross, and we will believe Him. He trusted in God; let Him deliver\nHim now, if He will have Him: for He said, I am the Son of God.\u201d\nNot one word did Jesus answer to all this. While the nails were\nbeing driven through His hands, and the sweat drops of agony were\nforced from His pores, from the pale, quivering lips of the innocent\nSufferer a prayer of pardoning love was breathed for His murderers:\n\u201cFather, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\u201d All heaven[209]\nwas gazing with profound interest upon the scene. The glorious\nSufferings of Christ 189\nRedeemer of a lost world was suffering the penalty of man\u2019s trans-\ngression of the Father\u2019s law. He was about to ransom His people\nwith His own blood. He was paying the just claims of God\u2019s holy\nlaw. This was the means through which an end was to be finally\nmade of sin and Satan, and his host to be vanquished.\nOh, was there ever suffering and sorrow like that endured by the\ndying Saviour! It was the sense of His Father\u2019s displeasure which\nmade His cup so bitter. It was not bodily suffering which so quickly\nended the life of Christ upon the cross. It was the crushing weight of\nthe sins of the world, and a sense of His Father\u2019s wrath. The Father\u2019s\nglory and sustaining presence had left Him, and despair pressed its\ncrushing weight of darkness upon Him and forced from His pale\nand quivering lips the anguished cry: \u201cMy God, My God, why hast\nThou forsaken Me?\u201d\nJesus had united with the Father in making the world. Amid\nthe agonizing sufferings of the Son of God, blind and deluded men\nalone remain unfeeling. The chief priests and elders revile God\u2019s\ndear Son while in His expiring agonies. Yet inanimate nature groans\nin sympathy with her bleeding, dying Author. The earth trembles.\nThe sun refuses to behold the scene. The heavens gather blackness.\nAngels have witnessed the scene of suffering until they can look no\nlonger, and hide their faces from the horrid sight. Christ is dying! He\nis in despair! His Father\u2019s approving smile is removed, and angels\nare not permitted to lighten the gloom of the terrible hour. They can\nonly behold in amazement their loved Commander, the Majesty of\nheaven, suffering the penalty of man\u2019s transgression of the Father\u2019s\nlaw.\nEven doubts assailed the dying Son of God. He could not see\nthrough the portals of the tomb. Bright hope did not present to Him [210]\nHis coming forth from the tomb a conqueror and His Father\u2019s accep-\ntance of His sacrifice. The sin of the world, with all its terribleness,\nwas felt to the utmost by the Son of God. The displeasure of the\nFather for sin, and its penalty, which is death, were all that He could\nrealize through this amazing darkness. He was tempted to fear that\nsin was so offensive in the sight of His Father that He could not be\nreconciled to His Son. The fierce temptation that His own Father\nhad forever left Him caused that piercing cry from the cross: \u201cMy\nGod, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\u201d\n190 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nChrist felt much as sinners will feel when the vials of God\u2019s\nwrath shall be poured out upon them. Black despair, like the pall\nof death, will gather about their guilty souls, and then they will\nrealize to the fullest extent the sinfulness of sin. Salvation has been\npurchased for them by the suffering and death of the Son of God. It\nmight be theirs, if they would accept of it willingly, gladly; but none\nare compelled to yield obedience to the law of God. If they refuse\nthe heavenly benefit and choose the pleasures and deceitfulness of\nsin, they have their choice, and at the end receive their wages, which\nis the wrath of God and eternal death. They will be forever separated\nfrom the presence of Jesus, whose sacrifice they had despised. They\nwill have lost a life of happiness and sacrificed eternal glory for the\npleasures of sin for a season.\nFaith and hope trembled in the expiring agonies of Christ because\nGod had removed the assurance He had heretofore given His beloved\nSon of His approbation and acceptance. The Redeemer of the world\nthen relied upon the evidences which had hitherto strengthened Him,\nthat His Father accepted His labors and was pleased with His work.\nIn His dying agony, as He yields up His precious life, He has by\nfaith alone to trust in Him whom it has ever been His joy to obey.\nHe is not cheered with clear, bright rays of hope on the right hand[211]\nnor on the left. All is enshrouded in oppressive gloom. Amid the\nawful darkness which is felt by sympathizing nature, the Redeemer\ndrains the mysterious cup even to its dregs. Denied even bright hope\nand confidence in the triumph which will be His in the future, He\ncries with a loud voice: \u201cFather, into Thy hands I commend My\nspirit.\u201d He is acquainted with the character of His Father, with His\njustice, His mercy, and His great love, and in submission He drops\ninto His hands. Amid the convulsions of nature are heard by the\namazed spectators the dying words of the Man of Calvary.\nNature sympathized with the suffering of its Author. The heaving\nearth, the rent rocks, proclaimed that it was the Son of God who\ndied. There was a mighty earthquake. The veil of the temple was\nrent in twain. Terror seized the executioners and spectators as they\nbeheld the sun veiled in darkness, and felt the earth shake beneath\nthem, and saw and heard the rending of the rocks. The mocking\nand jeering of the chief priests and elders were hushed as Christ\ncommended His spirit into the hands of His Father. The astonished\nSufferings of Christ 191\nthrong began to withdraw and grope their way in the darkness to\nthe city. They smote upon their breasts as they went and in terror,\nspeaking scarcely above a whisper, said among themselves: \u201cIt is an\ninnocent person that has been murdered. What if, indeed, He is, as\nHe asserted, the Son of God?\u201d\nJesus did not yield up His life till He had accomplished the work\nwhich He came to do, and exclaimed with His departing breath: \u201cIt\nis finished.\u201d Satan was then defeated. He knew that his kingdom\nwas lost. Angels rejoiced as the words were uttered: \u201cIt is finished.\u201d\nThe great plan of redemption, which was dependent on the death of\nChrist, had been thus far carried out. And there was joy in heaven\nthat the sons of Adam could, through a life of obedience, be finally\nexalted to the throne of God. Oh, what love! What amazing love! [212]\nthat brought the Son of God to earth to be made sin for us, that we\nmight be reconciled to God, and elevated to a life with Him in His\nmansions in glory. Oh, what is man, that such a price should be paid\nfor his redemption!\nWhen men and women can more fully comprehend the magni-\ntude of the great sacrifice which was made by the Majesty of heaven\nin dying in man\u2019s stead, then will the plan of salvation be magnified,\nand reflections of Calvary will awaken tender, sacred, and lively\nemotions in the Christian\u2019s heart. Praises to God and the Lamb\nwill be in their hearts and upon their lips. Pride and self-esteem\ncannot flourish in the hearts that keep fresh in memory the scenes\nof Calvary. This world will appear of but little value to those who\nappreciate the great price of man\u2019s redemption, the precious blood of\nGod\u2019s dear Son. All the riches of the world are not of sufficient value\nto redeem one perishing soul. Who can measure the love Christ felt\nfor a lost world as He hung upon the cross, suffering for the sins of\nguilty men? This love was immeasurable, infinite.\nChrist has shown that His love was stronger than death. He\nwas accomplishing man\u2019s salvation; and although He had the most\nfearful conflict with the powers of darkness, yet, amid it all, His love\ngrew stronger and stronger. He endured the hiding of His Father\u2019s\ncountenance, until He was led to exclaim in the bitterness of His\nsoul: \u201cMy God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\u201d His arm\nbrought salvation. The price was paid to purchase the redemption of\n192 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nman, when, in the last soul struggle, the blessed words were uttered\nwhich seemed to resound through creation: \u201cIt is finished.\u201d\nMany who profess to be Christians become excited over worldly\nenterprises, and their interest is awakened for new and exciting\namusements, while they are coldhearted, and appear as if frozen,\nin the cause of God. Here is a theme, poor formalist, which is\nof sufficient importance to excite you. Eternal interests are here[213]\ninvolved. Upon this theme it is sin to be calm and unimpassioned.\nThe scenes of Calvary call for the deepest emotion. Upon this subject\nyou will be excusable if you manifest enthusiasm. That Christ, so\nexcellent, so innocent, should suffer such a painful death, bearing\nthe weight of the sins of the world, our thoughts and imaginations\ncan never fully comprehend. The length, the breadth, the height, the\ndepth, of such amazing love we cannot fathom. The contemplation\nof the matchless depths of a Saviour\u2019s love should fill the mind, touch\nand melt the soul, refine and elevate the affections, and completely\ntransform the whole character. The language of the apostle is: \u201cI\ndetermined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ,\nand Him crucified.\u201d We also may look toward Calvary and exclaim:\n\u201cGod forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus\nChrist, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the\nworld.\u201d\nConsidering at what an immense cost our salvation has been pur-\nchased, what will be the fate of those who neglect so great salvation?\nWhat will be the punishment of those who profess to be followers of\nChrist, yet fail to bow in humble obedience to the claims of their Re-\ndeemer, and who do not take the cross as humble disciples of Christ\nand follow Him from the manger to Calvary? \u201cHe that gathereth not\nwith Me,\u201d says Christ, \u201cscattereth abroad.\u201d\nSome have limited views of the atonement. They think that\nChrist suffered only a small portion of the penalty of the law of\nGod; they suppose that, while the wrath of God was felt by His\ndear Son, he had, through all His painful sufferings, the evidence\nof His Father\u2019s love and acceptance; that the portals of the tomb\nbefore Him were illuminated with bright hope, and that He had\nthe abiding evidence of His future glory. Here is a great mistake.\nChrist\u2019s keenest anguish was a sense of His Father\u2019s displeasure.\nHis mental agony because of this was of such intensity that man can[214]\nSufferings of Christ 193\nhave but faint conception of it.\nWith many the story of the condescension, humiliation, and\nsacrifice of our divine Lord awakens no deeper interest, and stirs\nthe soul and affects the life no more, than does the history of the\ndeath of the martyrs of Jesus. Many have suffered death by slow\ntortures; others have suffered death by crucifixion. In what does\nthe death of God\u2019s dear Son differ from these? It is true He died\nupon the cross a most cruel death; yet others, for His dear sake, have\nsuffered equally, so far as bodily torture is concerned. Why, then,\nwas the suffering of Christ more dreadful than that of other persons\nwho have yielded their lives for His sake? If the sufferings of Christ\nconsisted in physical pain alone, then His death was no more painful\nthan that of some of the martyrs.\nBut bodily pain was but a small part of the agony of God\u2019s dear\nSon. The sins of the world were upon Him, also the sense of His\nFather\u2019s wrath as He suffered the penalty of the law transgressed.\nIt was these that crushed His divine soul. It was the hiding of His\nFather\u2019s face\u2014a sense that His own dear Father had forsaken Him\u2014\nwhich brought despair. The separation that sin makes between God\nand man was fully realized and keenly felt by the innocent, suffering\nMan of Calvary. He was oppressed by the powers of darkness. He\nhad not one ray of light to brighten the future. And He was struggling\nwith the power of Satan, who was declaring that he had Christ in\nhis power, that he was superior in strength to the Son of God, that\nthe Father had disowned His Son, and that He was no longer in the\nfavor of God any more than himself. If He was indeed still in favor\nwith God, why need He die? God could save Him from death.\nChrist yielded not in the least degree to the torturing foe, even in\nHis bitterest anguish. Legions of evil angels were all about the Son [215]\nof God, yet the holy angels were bidden not to break their ranks and\nengage in conflict with the taunting, reviling foe. Heavenly angels\nwere not permitted to minister unto the anguished spirit of the Son of\nGod. It was in this terrible hour of darkness, the face of His Father\nhidden, legions of evil angels enshrouding Him, the sins of the world\nupon Him, that the words were wrenched from His lips: \u201cMy God,\nMy God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\u201d\nThe death of the martyrs can bear no comparison with the agony\nendured by the Son of God. We should take broader and deeper\n194 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nviews of the life, sufferings, and death of God\u2019s dear Son. When the\natonement is viewed correctly, the salvation of souls will be felt to\nbe of infinite value. In comparison with the enterprise of everlasting\nlife, every other sinks into insignificance. But how have the counsels\nof this loving Saviour been despised! The heart has been devoted\nto the world, and selfish interests have closed the door against the\nSon of God. Hollow hypocrisy and pride, selfishness and gain, envy,\nmalice, and passion, have so filled the hearts of many that Christ can\nhave no room.\nHe was eternally rich, yet for our sakes He became poor, that\nwe through His poverty might be made rich. He was clothed with\nlight and glory, and was surrounded with hosts of heavenly angels\nwaiting to execute His commands. Yet He put on our nature and\ncame to sojourn among sinful mortals. Here is love that no language\ncan express. It passes knowledge. Great is the mystery of godliness.\nOur souls should be enlivened, elevated, and enraptured with the\ntheme of the love of the Father and the Son to man. The followers\nof Christ should here learn to reflect in some degree that mysterious\nlove preparatory to joining all the redeemed in ascribing \u201cblessing,\nand honor, and glory, and power, ... unto Him that sitteth upon the\nthrone, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.\u201d\nChapter 30\u2014Warnings to the Church [216]\nDear Brethren In -----,\nYou are not standing in the light, as God would have you. I was\npointed back to the ingathering of souls at ----- last spring, and was\nshown that your minds were not prepared for that work. You did\nnot expect or believe that such a work would then be accomplished\namong you. But the work was carried on, notwithstanding your\nunbelief, and without the co-operation of many among you.\nWhen you had such evidences that God was waiting to be gra-\ncious to His people, that mercy\u2019s voice was inviting sinners and\nbacksliders to the cross of Christ, why did you not unite with those\nwho had the burden of the work upon them? Why did you not come\nup to the help of the Lord? Some of you seemed benumbed, stu-\npefied, and amazed, and were unprepared to participate fully in the\nwork. Many assented to it, but their hearts were not in it. This was a\ngreat evidence of the lukewarm condition of the church.\nYour worldliness does not incline you to throw wide open the\ndoor of your hard hearts at the knock of Jesus, who is seeking an\nentrance there. The Lord of glory, who has redeemed you by His\nown blood, waited at your doors for admittance; but you did not\nthrow them open wide and welcome Him in. Some opened the door\nslightly and permitted a little light from His presence to enter, but\ndid not welcome the heavenly Visitor. There was not room for Jesus.\nThe place which should have been reserved for Him was occupied\nwith other things. Jesus entreated you: \u201cIf any man hear My voice,\nand open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him,\nand he with Me.\u201d There was a work for you to do to open the door.\nFor a time you felt inclined to hear and open the door; but even [217]\nthis inclination departed, and you failed to secure the communion\nwith the heavenly Guest which it was your privilege to have. Some,\nhowever, opened the door and heartily welcomed their Saviour.\nJesus will not force open the door. You must open it yourselves\nand show that you desire His presence by giving Him a sincere\n195\n196 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwelcome. If all had made thorough work in clearing away the world\u2019s\nrubbish and preparing a place for Jesus, He would have entered and\nabode with you, and would have done a great work through you for\nthe salvation of others. But notwithstanding you were unprepared for\nthe work, it commenced among you in mighty power. Backsliders\nwere reclaimed, sinners were converted, and the sound went out\ninto the region round about. The community was stirred. Had the\nchurch come up to the help of the Lord, and had the way been fully\nopened for further labor, a work would have been accomplished in\n----- and ----- and the region round about, such as you have never\nwitnessed. But the minds of the brethren were not aroused, and\nthey were in a great degree indifferent to the matter. Some who had\never been seeking their own interest could not think of having their\nminds drawn away from themselves on this occasion, even though\nthe salvation of souls might be at stake.\nThe Lord had laid upon us the burden. We were willing to give\nyou all there was of us for a time, if you would come up with us\nto the help of the Lord. But in this there was a decided failure.\nGreat ingratitude was shown for the manifestations of the power of\nGod among you. Had you received the tokens of God\u2019s mercy and\nloving-kindness as you should, with thankful hearts, and united your\ninterest to work with the Spirit of God, you would not be in your\npresent condition. But since that precious work was done among\nyou, you have been going down and withering spiritually.\nThe parable of the lost sheep you do not yet understand. You[218]\nhave not learned the lesson the divine Teacher designed you should.\nYou have been dull scholars. Read the parable in Luke 15: \u201cWhat\nman of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth\nnot leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that\nwhich is lost, until he find it? And when he hath found it, he layeth\nit on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth\ntogether his friends and neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with\nme; for I have found my sheep which was lost.\u201d\nHere were the cases of several who had backslidden, who had\nbeen in darkness, and who had strayed from the fold. But especially\nwas the case of Brother A prominent. All the efforts were not made\nwhich should have been made in wisdom to prevent his straying\nfrom the fold; and after he had strayed, diligent efforts were not put\nWarnings to the Church 197\nforth to bring him back. There was more gossiping over his case\nthan sincere sorrow for him. All these things kept him from the\nfold and caused his heart to be separated farther and farther from his\nbrethren, making his rescue still more difficult. How different was\nthis course from that pursued by the shepherd in the parable, when\nin pursuit of the lost sheep. The whole ninety and nine were left in\nthe wilderness to care for themselves, exposed to dangers; yet the\nlone sheep, separated from the flock, was in greater danger, and to\nsecure the one, the ninety and nine were left.\nSome of the church had no special anxiety to have Brother A\nreturn. They cared not enough to unbend from their dignity and\npride and make special efforts to help him to the light. They stood\nback on their dignity and said: \u201cWe will not go after him; let him\ncome to us.\u201d Viewing the feelings of his brethren toward him as he\ndid, it was impossible for him to do this. Had they regarded the\nlesson taught by Christ, they would have been willing to yield their [219]\ndignity and pride, and go after the wandering ones. They would\nhave wept over them, prayed for them, implored them to be faithful\nto God and the truth, and to abide with the church. But the feeling\nof many was: \u201cIf he wants to go, let him go.\u201d\nWhen the Lord sent His servants to do for these wanderers the\nwork which you ought to have done, and even when you had evi-\ndence that the Lord was giving a message of mercy to these poor\nstraying ones, you were unprepared to give up your ideas. You did\nnot feel like leaving the ninety and nine, and searching after the\nlost sheep till it was found, and you did not do it. And when the\nsheep was found, and brought back to the fold with rejoicing, did\nyou rejoice? We tried to arouse you. We tried to call you together,\nas the shepherd called his neighbors and friends, to have you rejoice\nwith us; but you seemed unwilling. You felt that the sheep had done\na great wrong in leaving the fold, and instead of rejoicing that he\nhad returned, you were anxious to make him feel that he should be\nvery sorry for leaving, and should come back just according to your\nideas. And since his return, you have had a feeling of jealousy in\nregard to him. You have kept watching to see if all was right. Some\nhave not been exactly satisfied; they have felt an unwillingness to\nhave things just as they are.\n198 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nYou are unacquainted with yourselves. Some possess selfishness,\nwhich leads to the narrowing up of their influence and efforts. There\nis more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety\nand nine just persons who need no repentance. Had the church\nbeen prepared to appreciate the work the Lord was doing among\nthem, they would since that ingathering have been growing stronger\nand stronger. But instead of all throwing their whole soul into the\nwork, and feeling a special, sincere interest to do all in their power\nto follow up the work after we left it, they acted very much as if\nthe work did not specially concern them, and as though they were[220]\nonly spectators, ready to distrust and find fault wherever there was\nopportunity.\nI was shown the case of Brother B. He feels unhappy. He is\ndissatisfied with his brethren. His mind has been exercised for some\ntime that it was his duty to carry the message. He has the ability, and,\nas far as his knowledge of the truth is concerned, he is capable; but\nhe lacks culture. He has not learned to control himself. It requires\ngreat wisdom to deal with minds, and he is not qualified for this\nwork. He understands the theory, but has not educated himself in\nforbearance, patience, gentleness, kindness, and true courteousness.\nIf anything arises which does not meet his mind, he does not stop\nto consider whether it is wisdom to take notice of it, or to let it pass\nuntil it shall be fully considered. He braces himself at once for battle.\nHe is harsh, severe, denunciatory, and if things do not meet his mind,\nhe raises disturbance at once.\nHe possesses in his organization the elements of war rather than\nof sweet peace and harmony. He has not wisdom to give to all their\nportion of meat in due season. \u201cAnd of some have compassion,\nmaking a difference: and others save with fear, pulling them out of\nthe fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.\u201d Brother B has\nbut little knowledge of making this difference. He is rough in his\nmanners, and indiscreet in his dealing with souls. This disqualifies\nhim for making a wise, careful shepherd. A shepherd must have\nnoble generosity, courage, fortitude, love, and tenderness combined.\nBrother B will be in danger of tearing down more than he can\nbuild up. He has not brought all his powers in subjection to the will\nof God. He has not been transformed by the renewing of his mind.\nHe is self-sufficient, and does not rely wholly upon the grace of God;\nWarnings to the Church 199\nhis works are not wrought in God. To be a shepherd is to occupy\na very important, responsible position; to feed the flock of God is [221]\nan exalted and sacred work. Brother B, the Lord does not regard\nyou fit to be an overseer of His flock. Had you been learning the\nlesson of self-government in your religious experience, and had you\nfelt the necessity of elevating your mind and purifying your heart\nby the sanctification of the Spirit, and of bringing all your powers\ninto subjection to the will of God, seeking humility and meekness,\nyou might now be in a position to do good and to exert an influence\nwhich would be elevating and saving.\nBrother and Sister B, you have a work to do for yourselves which\nno one can do for you. You are inclined to murmur and complain.\nYou have something to do to subdue your natural feelings. Live for\nGod yourselves, knowing that you have not to answer for the wrongs\nof others. I saw, Brother B, that you would certainly be overcome\nby Satan, and make utter shipwreck of faith, unless you stop your\nfaultfinding, and seek pure and undefiled religion before God. You\nneed to be elevated in your thoughts and conversation; you need a\nthorough conversion.\nLife or death is before you. You should solemnly consider that\nyou are dealing with the great God, and should ever remember that\nHe is not a child, to be trifled with. You cannot engage in His service\nat will and let it alone at pleasure. Your inmost soul needs to be\nconverted. All who, like you, my brother, have failed to grow in\nthe grace of God, and to perfect holiness in His name, will, in these\ndays of peril and trial, meet with great loss. Their foundation will\nprove to be sliding sand instead of the Rock Christ Jesus.\nYou move by impulse. You feel unreconciled to your brethren\nbecause you are not sent out to preach the truth. You are not fit for\nthis trust. More than one efficient preacher would be required to\nfollow in your wake to bind up the wounds and bruises which your\nharsh dealing would make. God is not pleased with you, and I fear [222]\nthat you will fail of everlasting life.\nYou have no time to lose. Make mighty efforts to rescue yourself\nfrom Satan\u2019s snare. You need to learn of Jesus, who is meek and\nlowly of heart, and then you will obtain rest. Oh, what a work you\nhave to do to perfect holiness in the fear of God, and be prepared for\nthe society of the pure and holy angels. You need to humble your\n200 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nheart before God, and seek meekness and righteousness, that you\nmay be hid in the day of the Lord\u2019s fierce anger.\nBrother B, the Lord let His blessing rest upon you last spring; but\nyou did not see the relation which watchfulness and prayer sustain\nto a progress in the divine life. You have neglected these duties,\nand the result is that darkness has enshrouded you. You have been\nin a state of uncertainty and distrust, and have frequently chosen\nthe society of those who are in darkness, those whom Satan uses\nto scatter from Christ. You could live among the most corrupt, and\nremain unstained, unsullied, if God in His providence thus directed\nyou. But it is dangerous for those who wish to honor God to find\ntheir pleasure and entertainment with companions who fear Him not.\nSatan ever surrounds such with great darkness; and if those who\nprofess Christ go unbidden into this darkness, they tempt the devil\nto tempt them. If, in order to do good and glorify His name, the\nLord requires us to go among infernal spirits, where is the blackest\ndarkness, He will encircle us with His angels and keep us unsullied.\nBut if we seek the company of sinners, and are pleased with their\ncoarse jests, and entertained and amused with their stories, sports,\nand ribaldry, the pure and holy angels remove their protection and\nleave us to the darkness we have chosen.\nBrother B, I wish to alarm you; I wish to arouse you to action. I\nwish to entreat of you to seek God while He invites you to come to\nHim that you may have life. Watch, pray, work,\u201d are the Christian\u2019s[223]\nwatchwords. Satan is vigilant in his efforts; his perseverance is\nuntiring, his zeal earnest and unabated. He does not wait for his\nprey to come to him; he seeks for it. To wrench souls from the\nhand of Christ is his determined purpose; yet professed Christians\nare asleep in their blindness, insane in their pursuits. God is not in\ntheir thoughts. A vigilant foe is upon their track; yet they are in no\ndanger while they make God their trust. But unless they do this,\ntheir strength will be weakness, and they will be overcome by Satan.\nBrother B, it is dangerous for you to yield to doubts. You must\nnot permit yourself to go any further in the direction in which you\nhave been going. You are in constant danger. Satan is on your track,\nsuggesting doubts and causing unbelief. Had you stood clear in the\ncounsel of God you could have had an influence for good over those\nwho love your society now.\nWarnings to the Church 201\nPoor Brother C felt the influence of the Spirit of God, but was\ndeficient in experience. He did not fully turn from his old habits.\nHe failed to make God his strength continually, and his feet slipped.\nThere is no concord between Christ and Belial. You might have\nhelped him, had you been connected with Heaven as you should have\nbeen. But your course of inactivity, your manner of conversation,\nyour influence, have strengthened him in his backsliding and quieted\nthe voice of conscience within him. Your course has not been a\nreproof to him in his downward track. You could do good, were\nyou living for God. Your strength is utter weakness, your wisdom\nfoolishness; but you do not realize it. You have been too well\nsatisfied with a theory, a correct form of doctrine, but have not felt\nthe necessity of the power of God; you have neglected the spiritual\npart of religion. Your whole being should cry out for the Spirit of\nGod\u2014the life and power of religion in the soul, which would lead\nto the crucifixion of self and a firm trust in your Redeemer.\nYou are in terrible darkness, and unless you arise in the name of [224]\nGod, and break asunder the fetters of Satan, and assert your freedom,\nyou will make shipwreck of the faith. So great is the unwillingness\nof the Lord to leave you, and such is His love toward you, that\nnotwithstanding your life has not been in accordance with His will,\nand your works and ways have been offensive to Him, the Majesty\nof heaven condescends to beg the privilege of making you a visit and\nleaving you His blessing: \u201cBehold, I stand at the door, and knock.\u201d\nThe mansions in glory are His, and the joy of that heavenly abode;\nyet He humbles Himself to seek an entrance at the door of your heart,\nthat He may bless you with His light and make you to rejoice in His\nglory. His work is to seek and to save that which is lost and ready to\nperish. He wishes to redeem as many as He can from sin and death,\nthat He may elevate them to His throne and give them everlasting\nlife.\nBrother B, be entreated to arise and cast aside your doubts. What\nmakes you inclined to doubt? It is your life of departure from God,\nyour life of unconsecration, your jesting and joking. Your lack of\nsobriety is endangering your eternal interests. Christ is inviting you\nto turn from these follies to Him. You are not growing in grace and\nin the knowledge of the truth. You are not an honor to the cause.\nYou are not becoming elevated, but are sinking lower and lower in\n202 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthe scale. You are not forming a character for heaven and everlasting\nlife.\nYou are pleasing yourself, passing away time in frivolity which\nshould be spent with your family, teaching your children the ways\nand works of God. The hours that you spend in company that does\nyou only harm should be devoted to prayer and the study of God\u2019s\nword. You should feel that a responsibility rests upon you, as head of\nyour family, to bring up your children in the nurture and admonition\nof the Lord. What account will you render to God for misspent time?\nWhat influence are you having over those who have not the fear of[225]\nGod before them? \u201cLet your light so shine before men, that they may\nsee your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d\nMay God anoint your eyes that you may see your peril. I feel deeply\nfor you. My heart yearns over you. I long to see you coming up to\nthe high standard that it is your privilege to attain. You can do good.\nYour influence, if exerted on the right side, will tell. Brother B, your\nfootsteps are in the downward path. \u201cTurn ye, turn ye,\u201d \u201cfor why\nwill ye die?\u201d\nIf you much longer pursue the course you are now following, you\nwill become infidel in regard to the truth and in regard to the word\nof God. Watch and pray always. Dedicate yourself unreservedly to\nthe Lord, and it will not then be difficult to serve Him. You have\na divided heart. This is the reason that darkness, instead of light,\nencircles you. The last message of mercy is now going forth. It is a\ntoken of the long-suffering and compassion of God. Come, is the\ninvitation now given. Come, for all things are now ready. This is\nmercy\u2019s last call. Next will come the vengeance of an offended God.\nBrother B, encourage simplicity, love, forbearance, and sweet\nunion with your brethren. But do not, oh, do not sell everlasting\nlife so cheaply. If you go from the truth you will never know real\nhappiness; you will be miserable indeed. Heaven is worth making\nany and every sacrifice for. Break the bands of Satan. Jesus now\ninvites you; will you listen to His voice? You must take a higher\nstand than you have hitherto done. Make it your first business to\ngain the kingdom of heaven and the righteousness of Christ. Live\nfor God and heaven, and the eternal reward will be yours at the end\nof the race.\nWarnings to the Church 203\n* * * * *\nChapter 31\u2014Contemplating Marriage\nI was pointed back to last May, when the Lord visited -----,\nand was shown the case of Brother D. He was not prepared to\ntake part in that work. His mind and heart were elsewhere. He[226]\nwas contemplating marriage and could not listen to the invitation\nof Jesus: \u201cCome; for all things are now ready.\u201d His contemplated\nmarriage engrossed his attention. He had no time or inclination\nto open the door of his heart to the gracious Visitor. Had he done\nthis, Christ would have given him good counsel, which, if heeded,\nwould have been of priceless value to him. He would have presented\nbefore him in its true light his danger of yielding to the dictates of\na wayward inclination and setting aside the glory of God and the\ndecisions of sober reason. He would have charged him to beware\nhow he trod in the footsteps of those who had fallen and been ruined.\nBut this brother did not consider that God had claims upon him; that\nhe should make no move without consulting Him who had bought\nhim. We are instructed that whatever we do, we should do all to His\nglory.\nDid you, Brother D, as a disciple, a learner, of Christ, go to\nHim in humble, sincere prayer and commit your ways to him? You\nfailed to do this. You did not investigate all your motives and move\nwith carefulness lest you should bring a reproach upon the cause\nof Christ, your Redeemer. You did not consider whether this move\nwould have an effect to increase your spiritual sensibility, quicken\nyour zeal, and strengthen your steadfastness in the truth and your\nefforts to deny self. You were ignorant of your own heart. The work\nof God was seen in the church, but you had no longings for the\ndivine Spirit. The things of heaven were insipid to you. You were\ninfatuated by your new hopes of uniting your interests with those of\nanother. You did not consider that a marriage alliance would vitally\naffect your interest for life, short though that life must be.\nYou should have felt that with your own evil heart to subdue you\ncould not be brought in connection with an influence which would\n204\nContemplating Marriage 205\nmake it more difficult for you to overcome self, make your path [227]\nupward to heaven more rugged. You have now made your religious\nprogress tenfold more difficult than when you stood alone. It is true\nyou were lonely, for you had lost a precious jewel. But if you had\ncounseled with your brethren, and committed your ways to the Lord,\nHe would have opened the way for you to have connected yourself\nwith one who could have been a help to you instead of a hindrance.\nIf you will now humbly turn to the Lord with all your heart, He\nwill pity and help you. But you are just where you are shorn of\nyour strength, and are prepared to compromise your faith and your\nallegiance to God to please your new wife. God pity you, for ruin\nis before you unless you arouse like a true soldier of Christ and\nengage anew in the warfare for everlasting life. Your only safety is\nin keeping with your brethren, and obtaining all the strength you\ncan from them to remain in the truth. You are about to sacrifice the\ntruth for the sake of peace and happiness here. You are selling your\nsoul at a cheap market. It is now your duty to do all you can to make\nyour wife happy, and yet not to sacrifice the principles of truth. You\nshould exercise forbearance, patience, and true courtesy. By thus\ndoing, you can show the power of true grace and the influence of the\ntruth.\nI was shown that the love of money is a snare to you. Money,\nindependent of the opportunity it furnishes for doing good, blessing\nthe needy, and advancing the cause of God, is really of but little\nvalue. The little you possess is a snare to you, and unless you use it\nas a wise and faithful steward in the service of your Master, it will\nyield you little else but misery. You are close and penurious. You\nneed to cultivate a noble, liberal spirit and separate your affections\nfrom the world or you will be overcome. The deceitfulness of riches\nwill so corrupt your soul that the good will be overcome by evil.\nSelfishness and love of gain will triumph.\nIf you, my dear brother, are saved, it will indeed be a miracle [228]\nof mercy. The love of the world is increasing upon you. Carefully\nconsider the words of Christ: \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with\nall thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the\nfirst and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou\nshalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments\nhang all the law and the prophets.\u201d My brother, you have obeyed\n206 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nneither the first nor the second of these commandments. You would\nnot hesitate to reach out and advantage yourself, although you knew\nit would greatly disadvantage your neighbor. You look to your own\nselfish interest, and say: \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d\nYou are not laying up treasure in heaven and becoming rich\ntoward God. Self and selfish interests are eating out true godliness\nfrom your soul. You are bowing to the god of this world. Your\nheart is alienated from God. An inspired writer says: \u201cThe path of\nthe just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the\nperfect day.\u201d The steps of a Christian may at times appear feeble and\nfaltering, yet in his conscious weakness he leans upon the Mighty\nOne for support. He is sustained, and makes sure progress onward\nand upward toward perfection. He gains new victories daily, and\ncomes nearer and nearer to the standard of perfect holiness. His eye\nis not downward to the earth, but upward, ever keeping in view the\nheavenly Pattern.\nBrother D, the glitter and tinsel of the corruptible things of earth\nhave eclipsed the charms of heaven, and made eternal life of but\nlittle value to you. As a servant of Christ, I entreat you to awake\nthat you may see yourself as you are. The profits you will obtain\nin the course you are now pursuing will be eternal loss. You will\nfind at last that you have made a terrible mistake which can never be\nremedied.\nYou can now face rightabout, heed the call of mercy, and live.[229]\nRejoice that your probation has not ended, that you may now, by\npatient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, honor, immortality,\nand eternal life. Rejoice that she who has been your faithful com-\npanion for years shall rise again, that mortality will be swallowed\nup of life. Look forward to the morning of the resurrection, when\nshe who shared your joys and sorrows for more than a score of years\nwill come forth from her prison house. Will you have her look for\nyou, her companion, in vain? Will you be missing then, as her voice\nis raised in triumph and victory: \u201cO death, where is thy sting? O\ngrave, where is thy victory?\u201d Oh, that day will bring honor to the\nsaints! No shame, no reproach, no suffering then; but peace, joy, and\nimmortal praise upon every redeemed tongue! Oh, that God would\nspeak to your heart and impress you with the value of eternal life.\nAnd may you be led, my brother, to ever possess a spirit of noble\nContemplating Marriage 207\ngenerosity, that you may discharge the duties of your stewardship\nwith faithfulness, having an eye single to the glory of God, that the\nMaster may say to you: \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant:\n... enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 32\u2014Danger of Riches\nI was shown that some are deceived in regard to themselves.\nThey look to those who have much property, and feel that these are\nthe only ones who have a love of the world, and who are in any\nspecial danger of covetousness. But this is not the case. Those who\nhave means are constantly in danger, and are accountable for all the\ntalents of means which the Master has entrusted to their care. But\nthose who have little of this world are frequently self-caring, and do[230]\nnot do that which is in their power to do, and which God requires\nthem to do. They frequently have opportunities to do good, but they\nhave so long cared for self, and studied self-interest, that they think\nthere is no other way for them to do.\nI was shown that Brother and Sister E are in danger of having\ntheir thoughts centered too much upon themselves; especially is\nSister E at fault here. She has almost supreme love for herself. You,\nmy sister, are poorly prepared to stand amid the perils of the day\nof God. You do not imitate the true Pattern, Jesus. There was not\none selfish act in His whole life. You have a work to do for yourself\nwhich no one can do for you. Divest yourself of selfishness, and\nlearn the mind and will of God. Study to show yourself approved\nunto God. You are impulsive, and are naturally irritable and peevish.\nYou work far beyond your strength. There is no virtue in this, for\nGod does not require it. A selfish disposition is at the bottom of\nthis. Your motives are not praiseworthy. You shun responsibility\nand caretaking, and have felt that you should be favored. It is to be\nregretted that from your childhood you have been petted and favored,\nand your will left unsubdued. Now, at a more advanced age, you\nhave the work to do which should have been done in your childhood.\nYour husband has yielded to your wishes and indulged your whims,\nto your injury.\nSelfishness, which manifests itself in a variety of ways according\nto circumstances and the peculiar organization of individuals, must\ndie. If you had children, and your mind were compelled to be called\n208\nDanger of Riches 209\naway from yourself to care for them, to instruct them, and be an\nexample to them, it would be an advantage to you. You have called\nforth in your home the attention and forbearance which are required\nto be exercised toward children. This attention you require and will\nhave. But you have not thought it any part of your duty to care for,\nor seek to advantage, others. You are willful and very set to carry [231]\nout your own plans. When everything is smooth in your pathway,\nyou manifest the fruits we expect to see borne by a Christian; but\nwhen your path is crossed, the result is the opposite. Like a spoiled\nchild which deserves chastisement, you have a spell of perverse\nwillfulness. When two compose a family, as in your case, and there\nare no children to call into exercise patience, forbearance, and true\nlove, there is need of constant watchfulness lest selfishness obtain the\nsupremacy, lest you yourselves become the center, and you require\nattention, care, and interest, which you feel under no obligation\nto bestow upon others. The care of children in a family makes it\nnecessary that a large portion of the time be spent at home, giving\nopportunity for the culture of mind and heart in connection with the\nordinary cares of domestic life.\nYou neglect to keep your heart, and neglect to do good with\nthe means which God has given you. Your influence could benefit\ndid you feel that anything was required of you toward those who\nneed help, who need encouraging and strengthening. But you have\nso long studied your pleasure that you are disqualified to benefit\nthose around you. You need to discipline yourself in order that\nyour affections and thoughts may be brought into subjection. Take\ntime for self-examination, that you may bring all your powers in\nsubjection to the mind and will of God. You are shut up to self. It is\nthe privilege of every true Christian to exert an influence for good\nover everyone with whom he associates.\nYou, my sister, will be rewarded according as your works have\nbeen. Closely investigate your motives, and candidly decide whether\nyou are rich in good works. I was pointed back to last spring,\nwhen the Lord was doing a good work in ----- and vicinity. Angels\nof mercy were hovering over His people, and hearts which knew\nnot God and the truth were deeply stirred. The Lord would have\ncarried forward the work He so graciously commenced, had the [232]\nbrethren been in working order. You had so long consulted your own\n210 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwishes, and caused everything to bend to your convenience, that the\npossibility that you might be inconvenienced led you to close the\ndoor which you might have opened to advance the cause.\nYou acted your part, and some others felt to draw back, fearing\nthe expense and calculating that they would lose time in attending\nmeetings if the effort should be made. Christian zeal was lacking.\nA world was before us lying in wickedness, exposed to the wrath\nof God, and poor souls were held by the prince of darkness; and\nyet those who ought to be awake and engaged in the noblest of\nall enterprises, the salvation of perishing souls, had not interest\nenough to call into action every means they could employ to hedge\nup the path to destruction and to turn the footsteps of the faltering\nones into the path of life. Eternal life should engage the deepest\ninterest of every Christian. To be a co-worker with Christ and the\nheavenly angels in the great plan of salvation! What work can bear\nany comparison with this! From every soul saved there comes to\nGod a revenue of glory to be reflected upon the one saved and also\nupon the one instrumental in his salvation.\n* * * * *\nChapter 33\u2014Christian Zeal\nThere is a noisy zeal, without aim or purpose, which is not\naccording to knowledge, which is blind in its operations and de-\nstructive in its results. This is not Christian zeal. Christian zeal is\ncontrolled by principle and is not spasmodic. It is earnest, deep, and\nstrong, engaging the whole soul and arousing to exercise the moral\nsensibilities. The salvation of souls and the interests of the kingdom\nof God are matters of the highest importance. What object is there\nthat calls for greater earnestness than the salvation of souls and the\nglory of God? There are considerations here which cannot be lightly\nregarded. They are as weighty as eternity. Eternal destinies are at [233]\nstake. Men and women are deciding for weal or woe. Christian zeal\nwill not exhaust itself in talk, but will feel and act with vigor and\nefficiency. Yet Christian zeal will not act for the sake of being seen.\nHumility will characterize every effort and be seen in every work.\nChristian zeal will lead to earnest prayer and humiliation, and to\nfaithfulness in home duties. In the family circle will be seen the\ngentleness and love, benevolence and compassion, which are ever\nthe fruits of Christian zeal.\nI was shown that you must make an advance move. Your treasure\nin heaven, Sister E, is not large. You are not rich toward God. May\nthe Lord open your eyes to see and your heart to feel, and cause you\nto manifest Christian zeal. Oh, how few feel the worth of souls! How\nfew are willing to sacrifice to bring souls to the knowledge of Christ!\nThere is much talking, much professed love for perishing souls; but\ntalk is cheap stuff. It is earnest Christian zeal that is wanted\u2014a zeal\nthat will be manifested by doing something. All must now work\nfor themselves, and when they have Jesus in their hearts they will\nconfess Him to others. No more could a soul who possesses Christ\nbe hindered from confessing Him than could the waters of Niagara\nbe stopped from flowing over the falls.\nI was shown that Brother F is buried in the rubbish of the world.\nHe cannot afford time to serve God, not even to earnestly study and\n211\n212 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\npray to know what the Lord would have him do. His talent is buried\nin the earth. The cares of this life have swallowed up his interest in\neternal things. The kingdom of God and the righteousness of Christ\nare secondary. He loves business; but I saw that unless he changes\nhis course, the hand of God will be against him. He may gather, but\nGod will scatter. He could do good. But many have the idea that\nif their life is a working, business life, they can do nothing for the\nsalvation of souls, nothing to advance the cause of their Redeemer.\nThey say they cannot do things by the halves, and therefore turn[234]\nfrom religious duties and religious exercises, and bury themselves up\nin the world. They make their business primary, and forget God, and\nHe is displeased with them. If any are engaged in business where\nthey cannot advance in the divine life and perfect holiness in the fear\nof God, they should change to a business in which they can have\nJesus with them every hour.\nBrother F, you do not honor your profession. Your zeal is a\nworldly zeal, your interest a worldly interest. You are dying spiritu-\nally. You understand not your perilous condition. The love of the\nworld is swallowing up your religion. You must awake; you must\nseek God and repent of your backslidings. In contrition take words\nand return to the Lord. Your religious duties have become merely\na form. You do not enjoy religion; for this enjoyment is dependent\nupon willing obedience. The willing and obedient shall eat the good\nof the land. You do not possess a bright evidence that you will dwell\nwith God in His kingdom. You occasionally engage in the outward\nperformance of religious duties, but your heart is not in the exercise.\nYou occasionally drop a word of warning to sinners, or a word in\nfavor of the truth; but it is a reluctant service, as though rendered\nto a taskmaster, instead of the cheerful service of filial affection. If\nyour heart is aglow with Christian zeal, the most arduous duties will\nbe pleasant and easy.\nWhy the Christian life is so difficult to many is that they have a\ndivided heart. They are double-minded, which makes them unstable\nin all their ways. Were they richly imbued with Christian zeal, which\nis ever the result of consecration to God, instead of the mournful\ncry, \u201cMy leanness, my leanness,\u201d the language of the soul would be:\n\u201cHear what the Lord has done for me.\u201d Even if you are saved, which\nis very doubtful, in the course you are pursuing, how limited will\nChristian Zeal 213\nbe the good you have accomplished. Not a soul will be saved by\nyour instrumentality. Will the Master say to you: \u201cWell done, thou [235]\ngood and faithful servant\u201d? What have you been doing faithfully?\nHard work in the business and cares of this life. Will this bring from\nthe lips of Christ the gracious words: \u201cWell done, thou good and\nfaithful servant\u201d?\nMy brother, Jesus loves you, and He invites you to face\nrightabout, and take your eyes from the earth, and fix them upon\nthe mark for the prize of your high calling, which is in Christ Jesus.\nCease lightness and trifling. Let a solemn weight of the time in\nwhich we live be borne by you till the war is over. Go to work; if\nconsecrated to God, your influence will tell.\nMost of the family of Brother G are in the downward road. H\nlives an aimless life. She is full of folly, vanity, and pride. Her\ninfluence does not tend to ennoble, does not lead to goodness and\nholiness. She does not like the restraint which religion imposes;\ntherefore she will not yield her heart to its sacred sway. She loves\nself, loves pleasure, and is seeking for her own enjoyment. Sad,\nsad indeed will be the result, unless she now turns square about and\nseeks for genuine godliness. She might exert a softening, ennobling,\nand elevating influence over her brothers. God loves these children,\nbut they are not Christians. If they would try to live humble Christian\nlives, they could become children of the light and workers for God;\nthey could be missionaries in their own family and among their\nassociates.\n* * * * *\nChapter 34\u2014Responsibilities of the Young\nIf the youth could only see how much good it is in their power to\naccomplish, if they would make God their strength and wisdom, they\nwould no longer pursue a course of careless indifference toward Him;\nthey would no longer be swayed by the influence of those who are\nunconsecrated. Instead of feeling that an individual responsibility\nrests upon them to put forth efforts to do others good, and lead[236]\nothers to righteousness, they give themselves up to seek their own\namusement. They are useless members of society, and live as aimless\nlives as do the butterflies. The young may have a knowledge of the\ntruth, and believe it, but not live it. Such possess a dead faith. Their\nhearts are not reached so as to affect their conduct and character\nin the sight of God, and they are no nearer doing His will than are\nunbelievers. Their hearts do not conform to the will of God; they\nare at enmity with Him. Those who are devoted to amusements,\nand who love the society of pleasure seekers, have an aversion to\nreligious exercises. Will the Master say to these youth who profess\nHis name, Well done, good and faithful servants, unless they are\ngood and faithful?\nThe young are in great danger. Great evil results from their\nlight reading. Much time is lost which should be spent in useful\nemployment. Some would even deprive themselves of sleep to finish\nsome ridiculous love story. The world is flooded with novels of\nevery description. Some are not of as dangerous a character as\nothers. Some are immoral, low, and vulgar; others are clothed with\nmore refinement; but all are pernicious in their influence. Oh, that\nthe young would reflect upon the influence which exciting stories\nhave upon the mind! Can you, after such reading, open the word of\nGod and read the words of life with interest? Do you not find the\nbook of God uninteresting? The charm of that love story is upon the\nmind, destroying its healthy tone, and making it impossible for you\nto fix your mind upon the important, solemn truths which concern\nyour eternal interest. You sin against your parents in devoting to\n214\nResponsibilities of the Young 215\nsuch a poor purpose the time which belongs to them, and you sin\nagainst God in thus using the time which should be spent in devotion\nto Him.\nIt is the duty of the youth to encourage sobriety. Lightness,\njesting, and joking will result in barrenness of soul and the loss of\nthe favor of God. Many of you think you do not exert a bad influence\nupon others, and thus feel in a measure satisfied; but do you exert [237]\nan influence for good? Do you seek in your conversation and acts to\nlead others to the Saviour, or, if they profess Christ, to lead them to\na closer walk with Him?\nThe young should cultivate a spirit of devotion and piety. They\ncannot glorify God unless they constantly aim to attain unto the\nfullness of the stature of Christ\u2014perfection in Christ Jesus. Let\nthe Christian graces be and abound in you. Give to your Saviour\nyour best and holiest affections. Render entire obedience to His\nwill. He will accept nothing short of this. Be not moved from your\nsteadfastness by the jeers and scoffs of those whose minds are given\nto vanity. Follow your Saviour through evil as well as good report;\ncount it all joy, and a sacred honor, to bear the cross of Christ. Jesus\nloves you. He died for you. Unless you seek to serve Him with your\nundivided affections, you will fail to perfect holiness in His fear, and\nyou will be compelled to hear at last the fearful word, Depart.\n* * * * *\nChapter 35\u2014Servants of Mammon\nThe case of Brother I is fearful. This world is his god; he\nworships money. He has not heeded the warning given him years\nago and overcome his love of the world while in the exercise of all\nhis faculties. The dollars which he has since accumulated have been\nlike so many cords to entangle his soul and bind him to the world.\nAs he has gained in property he has become more greedy for gain.\nAll the powers of his being are devoted to the one object, securing\nmoney. This has been the burden of his thoughts, the anxiety of his\nlife. He has turned all the powers of his being in this one direction\nuntil, to all intents and purposes, he is a worshiper of mammon.\nUpon this subject he is insane. His example before his family is\nleading them to think that property is to be valued before heaven and\nimmortality. He has for years been educating his mind to acquire[238]\nproperty. He is sacrificing his eternal interest for treasures upon the\nearth. He believes the truth, he loves the principles of truth, and\nloves to see others prospering in the truth; but he has made himself\nso thoroughly a slave to mammon that he feels bound to serve this\nmaster as long as he shall live. But the longer he lives the more\ndevoted will he become to his love of gain, unless he tears away\nfrom this terrible god, money. It will be like tearing out his vitals,\nbut it must be done if he values heaven.\nHe needs the censure of none, but the pity of all. His life has been\na terrible mistake. He has suffered imaginary pecuniary want, while\nsurrounded with plenty. Satan has taken possession of his mind and,\nexciting his organ of acquisitiveness, has made him insane upon this\nsubject. The higher, nobler powers of his being have been brought\nvery much into subjection to this close, selfish propensity. His only\nhope is in breaking the bands of Satan and overcoming this evil\nin his character. He has tried to do this by doing something after\nhis conscience has been wrought upon, but this is not sufficient.\nThis merely making a mighty effort and parting with a little of his\nmammon, and feeling all the time that he is parting with his soul, is\n216\nServants of Mammon 217\nnot the fruit of true religion. He must train his mind to good works.\nHe must brace against his propensity to acquire. He must weave\ngood works into all his life. He must cultivate a love for doing good,\nand get above the little, penurious spirit which he has fostered.\nIn trading with the merchants at -----, Brother and Sister I do\nnot take a course which is pleasing to God. They will dicker to get\nthings as cheap as they possibly can, and linger over a difference\nof a few pennies, and talk in regard to it as though money was their\nall\u2014their god. If they could only be brought back, unobserved, to\nhear the remarks that are made after they leave, they would get a\nclearer idea of the influence of penuriousness. Our faith is brought\ninto disrepute, and God is blasphemed by some on account of this [239]\nclose, penny dealing. Angels turn away in disgust. Everything in\nheaven is noble and elevated. All seek the interest and happiness of\nothers. No one devotes himself to looking out and caring for self. It\nis the chief joy of all holy beings to witness the joy and happiness of\nthose around them.\nWhen these angels come to minister to those who shall be heirs of\nsalvation, and witness the exhibition of selfishness, of covetousness,\nof overreaching, and benefiting self at others\u2019 disadvantage, they\nturn away in grief. When they see those who claim to be heirs to an\nimmortal inheritance so penurious in dealing with those who do not\nprofess any higher ambition than to be laying up treasures on earth,\nthey turn away in shame; for holy truth is reproached.\nIn no way could the Lord be better glorified and the truth more\nhighly honored than for unbelievers to see that the truth has wrought\na great and good work upon the lives of naturally covetous and\npenurious men. If it could be seen that the faith of such had an\ninfluence to mold their characters, to change them from close, selfish,\noverreaching, money-loving men to men who love to do good, who\nseek opportunities to use their means to bless those who need to\nbe blessed, who visit the widow and fatherless in their affliction,\nand who keep themselves unspotted from the world, it would be\nan evidence that their religion was genuine. Such would let their\nlight so shine that others seeing their good works would be led to\nglorify their Father which is in heaven. This fruit would be unto\nholiness, and they would be living representatives of Christ upon the\nearth. Sinners would be convicted that there is in the truth a power\n218 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nto which they are strangers. Those who profess to be waiting and\nwatching for the appearing of their Lord should not disgrace their\nprofession by bantering in deal and standing for the last penny. Such\nfruit does not grow upon the Christian tree.\nBrother I, the Lord is not willing that you should perish, but[240]\nwould rather that you should take hold of His strength and make\npeace with Him by a conformity of your will to His divine will. If a\nfaithful picture of your course in money getting could be presented\nbefore you, you would be terrified. You would be disgusted with\nyour closeness, your penuriousness, your love of money. You would\nmake it the effort of your life to obtain the transforming grace of\nGod, which would make you a new man. The means which came\nto you from relatives was a curse to you. It only increased your\nmoney-loving propensity, and was an additional weight to sink you\nto perdition.\n\u201cThe love of money is the root of all evil.\u201d When men employ\ntheir powers of mind and body in obtaining riches, and are content\nwith the pleasure of laying up wealth which they can never use,\nand which will prove an injury to their children, they abuse the\npowers which God has given them. They show that their characters\nhave been made sordid by the absorbing pursuit of gain. Instead\nof realizing happiness, they are miserable. They have shut up their\nsouls to the wants of the needy, and have given evidence that they\nhad no compassion for the suffering.\nMy brother, your heart is not callous to the wants and necessities\nof others. You have generous impulses, and you love to accom-\nmodate. Frequently you will readily do a kind act for a brother or\na neighbor; but you make money your god, and are in danger of\nvaluing heaven less than you value your money. In money getting\nthere is always danger unless the grace of God is the ruling principle\nof the soul. When Christians are controlled by the principles of\nheaven, they will dispense with one hand, while the other gains.\nThis is the only rational and healthy position a Christian can occupy\nwhile having and still making money. We would ask Brother I: What[241]\nare you going to do with your money? You are God\u2019s steward. You\npossess talents of means and can do much good with them. You can\ndeposit in the bank of heaven by being rich in good works. Bless\nothers with your life. \u201cLay not up for yourselves treasures upon\nServants of Mammon 219\nearth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break\nthrough and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,\nwhere neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not\nbreak through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your\nheart be also.\u201d\nRemember that the treasures laid up in heaven are not lost. They\nare secured to yourselves by a judicious use of the means of which\nHeaven has made you stewards. \u201cCharge them that are rich in this\nworld,\u201d says the apostle, \u201cthat they be not high-minded, nor trust\nin uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all\nthings to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works,\nready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for\nthemselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they\nmay lay hold on eternal life.\u201d\nThere is danger, Brother I, of your life\u2019s being lost, and the gifts\nwhich God has bestowed upon you being surrendered to the devil,\nand you led captive by him at his will. Can you bear the thought?\nCan you for this short life choose to serve self, and love your money,\nand then part with it all, and have no title to heaven, no right to\nthe life which is eternal? You have a mighty struggle before you\nto separate your affections from this earth\u2019s treasure. Where your\ntreasure is, there your heart will be also. Watch, pray, work, are the\nChristian\u2019s watchwords. Arouse yourself, I implore you. Seek for\nthose things which are enduring. The things of this earth must soon\npass away. Are you ready to exchange worlds? Are you forming\na character for everlasting life? If lost at last, you will know what [242]\nproved your ruin\u2014the love of money. You will cry in bitter anguish:\n\u201cOh, the deceitfulness of riches! I have lost my soul. I sold it for\nmoney. My soul and body I bartered for gain. I sacrificed heaven,\nfearing that I should have to sacrifice my money to obtain it.\u201d From\nthe Master will be heard: Take ye the unprofitable servant, bind\nhim hand and foot, and cast him into outer darkness. We hope this\nwill not be your fate. We hope you will remove your treasure to\nheaven, and transfer your affections, and fasten them upon God and\nthe immortal treasure.\nI have seen that the entire family were in danger of partaking, in\na degree, of the father\u2019s spirit. Sister I, you have already partaken\nof this spirit. God help you to see it and make an entire change.\n220 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nCultivate a love for doing good; seek to be rich in good works. In\nmany things you can do more than you do. You have an individual\nresponsibility before God. You have a duty to do, from which you\ncannot be excused. Maintain a close walk with God; pray without\nceasing. You will have close work if you save your soul. Seek to\nhave a counteracting influence in your family. Take your stand nobly\nfor God. Your organization is unlike your husband\u2019s, and you will\nbe condemned of God unless you act for yourself. Make diligent\nwork in saving your own soul, and in exerting an influence to save\nyour family. Let your example show that your treasure is in heaven,\nthat you have invested all in a better home and a better life, which\nare eternal. Train your mind to value heavenly things, to be elevated,\nto love God, and to manifest a willing obedience to His will.\nYou may be tested; you may be proved to see how strong your\naffection is for the things of this world. You may be made to under-\nstand a page of your heart with which you are now unacquainted.\nGod knows your trials as you view the state of your husband and\nchildren, who so greatly lack saving faith. Much more depends[243]\nupon you than you realize. You should put the armor on. Spend\nnot your precious strength in exhaustive labor which another can do.\nEncourage your daughter to engage in useful employment and to aid\nyou in bearing the burdens of life. She needs discipline. Her mind\nis vain. She needs to render all to God; then she can be useful and\nplease her Redeemer.\nMy sister, work less, and pray and meditate more. Eternal in-\nterests should be primary with you. God forbid that your children\nshould be molded into money lovers. True refinement and gentleness\nof manners can never be found in a home where selfishness reigns.\nThe truly refined always have brains and hearts, always have consid-\neration for others. True refinement does not find satisfaction in the\nadornment and display of the body. True refinement and nobility of\nsoul will be seen in efforts to bless and elevate others. The weight\nof eternal things rests very lightly upon your children. May God\narouse them before it shall be too late, and they exclaim in anguish:\n\u201cThe harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.\u201d\nBrother J, your case was presented before me. You occupy a\nresponsible position. You are entrusted with talents of money and\nof influence. To every man is given a work\u2014something todo, not\nServants of Mammon 221\nmerely to engage his brain, bone, and muscle in common labor; it\nmeans more than this. You are acquainted with this work from a\nworldly point of view, and have some experience in it in a religious\ncapacity. But for a few years past you have been losing time, and\nnow you will have to work fast to redeem the past. To possess talents\nis not enough; you must so use them as to advantage not merely\nyourself but Him who bestowed them. All that you have is a loan\nfrom your Lord. He will require it again at your hand with interest.\nChrist has a right to your services. You have become His servant [244]\nby grace. You are not to serve your own interest, but the interest of\nHim who has employed you. As a professed Christian you are under\nobligations to God. It is not your own property that is entrusted to\nyou for investment. Had it been so, you might have consulted your\nown pleasure in regard to its use. The capital is the Lord\u2019s, and\nyou are responsible for its use or abuse. There are ways in which\nthis capital can be so invested\u2014put out to the exchangers\u2014that it\nshall be earning the Lord something. If it is allowed to be buried in\nthe earth, neither the Lord nor you will be benefited, and you will\nlose all that was entrusted to you. May God help you, my brother,\nto realize your true position as God\u2019s hired servant. By His own\nsuffering and death He has paid the wages to secure your willing\nservice and ready obedience.\nDuring the trials of the past few years, you have suffered in mind,\nand have felt it a relief to turn your attention more fully to the things\nof the world, to the work of acquiring property. God, in His great\nlove and mercy to you, has again gathered you into His fold. New\nduties and responsibilities are now laid upon you. You have a strong\nlove for this world. You have been laying up treasures upon the\nearth. Jesus now invites you to transfer your treasure to heaven; for\nwhere your treasure is, there will your heart be also. In all your deal\nwith your brethren and with unbelievers, guard yourself. Be true to\nyour profession, and maintain true nobleness of soul, which shall be\na credit to the truth which you profess.\nYou occupy a position where others are looking to you. You\npossess more than ordinary intellect. You are a man of quick percep-\ntions, and you feel deeply. Some of your brethren have not moved in\nwisdom. They have watched you, and have felt over your case, and\nhave wished to see you more liberal with your means. They have\n222 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nmade themselves unhappy over your case. All this is needless in\nthem. These very ones lack in many things, and if they are faithful[245]\nin the humble service the Master requires of them they will have all\nthat they can do. They cannot afford to waste their time in anxiously\nfearing lest their neighbor, who has a larger work entrusted to him,\nshall fail to do his work well. While they are so interested in the case\nof another, their own work is neglected, and they are really slothful\nservants. They were anxious to do their neighbor\u2019s work instead of\nthat committed to themselves to do.\nThey think that if they only had the five talents to handle, they\ncould do much better than the one to whom these talents were\nentrusted. But the Master knew better than they. None need mourn\nthat they cannot glorify God by talents He never gave them and for\nwhich they are not responsible. They need not say: \u201cIf I were in\nanother\u2019s position in life I would do a great amount of good with my\ncapital.\u201d God requires no more of them than to improve upon what\nthey have, as stewards of His grace.\nThe one talent, the humblest service, if wholly consecrated, and\nexercised to promote the glory of God, will be as acceptable as the\nimprovement of the weightiest talent. The varied trusts are propor-\ntioned to our varied capabilities. To every man is given according\nto his ability. None should slight his work, considering it so small\nthat he need not be particular to do it well. If he does this he trifles\nwith his moral responsibilities and despises the day of small things.\nHeaven apportions to all their work, and it should be their ambition\nto do this work well, according to their capabilities. God requires\nthat all, the weakest as well as the strongest, fulfill their appointed\nwork. The interest expected will be in proportion to the amount\nentrusted.\nEach should diligently and interestedly attend to his own work,\nleaving others to their own Master, to stand or fall. There are too\nmany busybodies in -----, too many who are interested in watching[246]\ntheir brethren, and for this reason are constantly weak. They will\nbear testimony in meeting, and because they have not Jesus in their\nhearts to confess, they will try to impress upon their brethren their\nduty. These poor souls do not know their own duty, and yet they\ntake the responsibility of enlightening others in regard to their duty.\nIf such would attend to their own work, and obtain the grace of God\nServants of Mammon 223\nin their hearts, there would be a power in the church which is now\nlacking.\nBrother J, you can do good. You possess good judgment, and\nGod is leading you out of darkness into the light. Use your talents\nto the glory of God. Put them out to the exchangers, that when\nthe Master comes He may receive His own with usury. Break your\ntendrils from the valueless things of earth, and elevate them to\nentwine about God. The salvation of souls is of greater consequence\nthan the whole world. One soul saved, to live throughout the ages of\neternity, to praise God and the Lamb, is of more value than millions\nin money. Wealth sinks into insignificance when compared with the\nworth of souls for whom Christ died. You are a cautious man and\nwill not move rashly. Sacrifice for the truth, and become rich toward\nGod. May the Lord help you to move as fast as you should and place\nthe right estimate upon eternal things.\nYour children need a deeper work of grace in their hearts. They\nneed to encourage sobriety and solidity of character. If consecrated\nto God, they can do good and exert an influence which will be saving\nupon their companions.\nLet not the poor feel that there is nothing that they can do, be-\ncause they have not the wealth of their brethren. They can sacrifice\nin many ways. They can deny self. They can live devoted lives,\nand in their words and acts they can honor their Redeemer. The\nsisters especially can exert a strong influence if they will cease their [247]\ngossiping and devote their time to watchfulness and prayer. They\ncan honor God. They can let their light so shine that others, by\nseeing their good works, will be led to glorify our Father which is in\nheaven.\nAs an illustration of the failure on your part to come up to the\nwork of God, as was your privilege, I was referred to these words:\n\u201cCurse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly the\ninhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the Lord,\nto the help of the Lord against the mighty.\u201d Judges 5:23. What had\nMeroz done? Nothing. And this was their sin. They came not up to\nthe help of the Lord against the mighty.\n* * * * *\nChapter 36\u2014Sentimentalism and Matchmaking\nDear Sister K,\nIn the vision given me last June I was shown that you possess a\nfirmness of character, a determination of purpose, savoring some-\nwhat of stubbornness. You are unwilling to be led, yet you feel\nanxious to know and do the will of God. You have been deceived in\nyourself; you have not understood your own heart. You have thought\nthat your will was in subjection to the will of God, but in this you\nhave not judged aright. You have met with trials and have permitted\nyour mind to dwell upon disappointed hopes. For some years back\nyour life has taken a peculiar turn. There has seemed to be a spirit\nof unrest with you. You have not been happy, although there has\nbeen nothing in your surroundings which need to have cast so dark a\nshadow. You have not disciplined your mind to dwell upon cheerful\nsubjects. You are capable of exerting a strong influence in favor of\ntruth if you will only train your mind to run in the right channel.\nAll your words and acts should be such as to honor your Redeemer,\nexalt His love, and magnify His charms.\nYou have fallen into the sad error which is so prevalent in this[248]\ndegenerate age, especially with women. You are too fond of the other\nsex. You love their society; your attention to them is flattering, and\nyou encourage, or permit, a familiarity which does not always accord\nwith the exhortation of the apostle, to \u201cabstain from all appearance\nof evil.\u201d\nYou do not really understand yourself. You are walking in dark-\nness. You have had something to do with matchmaking. This is\nmost uncertain business; for you do not know the heart and may\nmake very bad work, thereby aiding the great rebel in his work of\nmatchmaking. He is busily engaged in influencing those who are\nwholly unsuited to each other to unite their interests. He exults in\nthis work, for by it he can produce more misery and hopeless woe to\nthe human family than by exercising his skill in any other direction.\n224\nSentimentalism and Matchmaking 225\nYou have written many letters, which has greatly taxed you.\nThese letters have dwelt somewhat upon the subjects of our faith\nand hope; but mixed with this have been close inquiries and guesses\nin regard to whether this one or that one was about to marry, and\nsuggestions relative to marriage. You seem to know considerable\nabout anticipated marriages, and write and talk upon these things.\nThis only causes dearth to your soul. \u201cOut of the abundance of\nthe heart the mouth speaketh.\u201d You have done great injustice to\nyourself in permitting your mind and conversation to dwell upon\nlove and marriage. You have not been happy, because you have\nbeen seeking after happiness. This is not profitable business. When\nyou seek earnestly to do your duty, and arouse yourself to minister\nunto others, then you will find rest of spirit. Your mind dwells upon\nyourself. It needs to be drawn away from yourself by seeking to\nlighten the cares of others; and in making them happy, you will find\nhappiness and cheerfulness of spirit.\nYou have a diseased imagination. You have thought yourself [249]\ndiseased, but this has been more imaginary than real. You have\nbeen untrue to yourself. You have conversed with young men, and\npermitted a freedom in your presence which should only be permitted\nin a brother. I was shown that your influence at ----- was not what it\nmight have been. You permitted your mind to take a low level. You\ncould chat, and laugh, and talk cheap talk unworthy of a Christian.\nYour deportment was not as it should have been. You appeared like\na person without a backbone. You were half reclining upon others,\nwhich is a wrong position for a lady to occupy in the presence of\nothers. If you had only thought so, you could have walked as well,\nand sat as erect, as many others. The condition of your mind leads\nto indolence and to a dread of exercise, when this exercise would\nprove one of the greatest means of your recovery. You will never\nrecover unless you lay aside this listless, dreamy condition of mind\nand arouse yourself to do, to work while the day lasts. Do, as well\nas imagine and plan. Turn your mind away from romantic projects.\nYou mingle with your religion a romantic, lovesick sentimentalism,\nwhich does not elevate, but only lowers. It is not yourself alone who\nis affected; others are injured by your example and influence.\nYou are naturally devotional. If you would train your mind to\ndwell upon elevated themes which have nothing to do with yourself,\n226 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nbut are of a heavenly nature, you could yet be of use. But much of\nyour life has been wasted in dreaming of doing some great work in\nthe future, while the present duty, small though it may appear to you,\nhas been neglected. You have been unfaithful. The Lord will not\ncommit to your trust any larger work until the work now before you\nhas been seen and performed with a ready, cheerful will. Unless the\nheart is put into the work, it will drag heavily, whatever that work\nmay be. The Lord tests our ability by first giving us small duties to[250]\nperform. If we turn from these with dissatisfaction and murmuring,\nno more will be entrusted to us until we cheerfully take hold of these\nsmall duties and do them well; then greater responsibilities will be\ncommitted to us.\nYou have been entrusted with talents not to be squandered, but\nto be put out to the exchangers, that at the Master\u2019s coming He may\nreceive His own with usury. God has not distributed these talents\nindiscriminately. He has dispensed these sacred trusts according to\nthe known capacity of His servants. \u201cTo every man his work.\u201d He\ngives impartially, and expects a corresponding return. If all do their\nduty according to the measure of their responsibility, the amount\nentrusted to them, be it large or small, will be doubled. Their fidelity\nis tested and proved, and their faithfulness is positive evidence of\ntheir wise stewardship, and of their worthiness to be entrusted with\nthe true riches, even the gift of everlasting life.\nAt the conference in New York, October, 1868, I was shown\nmany who are now doing nothing, who might be accomplishing\ngood. There was presented before me a class who are conscious\nthat they possess generous impulses, devotional feelings, and a love\nof doing good; yet at the same time they are doing nothing. They\npossess a self-complacent feeling, flattering themselves that if they\nhad an opportunity, or were circumstanced more favorably, they\ncould and would do a great and good work; but they are waiting the\nopportunity. They despise the narrow mind of the poor niggard who\ngrudges the small pittance to the needy. They see that he lives for\nself, that he will not be called from himself to do good to others, to\nbless them with the talents of influence and of means which have\nbeen committed to him to use, not to abuse, nor to permit to rust,\nor lie buried in the earth. Those who give themselves up to their\nstinginess and selfishness are accountable for their niggardly acts and\nSentimentalism and Matchmaking 227\nare responsible for the talents they abuse. But more responsible are [251]\nthose who have generous impulses and are naturally quick to discern\nspiritual things, if they remain inactive, waiting an opportunity they\nsuppose has not come, yet contrasting their readiness to do with\nthe unwillingness of the niggard, and reflecting that their condition\nis more favorable than that of their mean-souled neighbors. Such\ndeceive themselves. The mere possession of qualities which are\nnot used only increases their responsibility; and if they keep their\nMaster\u2019s talents unimproved, or hoarded, their condition is no better\nthan that of their neighbors for whom their souls feel such contempt.\nTo them it will be said: Ye knew your Master\u2019s will, yet did it not.\nHad you trained your mind to dwell upon elevated subjects, med-\nitating upon heavenly themes, you could have done much good. You\ncould have had an influence upon the minds of others, to turn their\nselfish thoughts and world-loving dispositions into the channel of\nspirituality. Were your affections and thoughts brought into subjec-\ntion to the will of Christ, you would be capable of doing good. Your\nimagination is diseased because you have permitted it to run in a\nforbidden channel, to become dreamy. Daydreaming and romantic\ncastle-building have unfitted you for usefulness. You have lived in\nan imaginary world; you have been an imaginary martyr and an\nimaginary Christian.\nThere is much of this low sentimentalism mingled with the reli-\ngious experience of the young in this age of the world. My sister,\nGod requires you to be transformed. Elevate your affections, I im-\nplore you. Devote your mental and physical powers to the service of\nyour Redeemer, who has bought you. Sanctify your thoughts and\nfeelings that all your works may be wrought in God.\nYou have been in a sad deception. God would have you inves-\ntigate closely every thought and purpose of your heart. Deal truly [252]\nwith your own soul. Had your affections been centered upon God\nas He requires, you would not have passed through the trials you\nhave. There is a restlessness of spirit with you which will not be\nrelieved until your thoughts are changed; until daydreaming and\ncastle-building cease, and you do the work of the present.\nIn your letter writing, leave matchmaking and guessing about the\nmarriages of your friends. The marriage relation is holy, but in this\ndegenerate age it covers vileness of every description. It is abused,\n228 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nand has become a crime which now constitutes one of the signs of\nthe last days, even as marriages, managed as they were previous\nto the Flood, were then a crime. Satan is constantly busy to hurry\ninexperienced youth into a marriage alliance. But the less we glory\nin the marriages which are now taking place, the better. When the\nsacred nature and the claims of marriage are understood, it will even\nnow be approved of Heaven, and the result will be happiness to both\nparties, and God will be glorified. May the Lord enable you to do\nthe work before you to do.\nI am about to write upon this wrong, deceptive work which is\ncarried on under the cover of religion. The lust of the flesh has\ncontrol of men and women. The mind has been depraved through a\nperversion of the thoughts and feelings, and yet the deceptive power\nof Satan has so blinded their eyes that poor, deceived souls flatter\nthemselves that they are spiritually minded, especially consecrated,\nwhen their religious experience is composed of lovesick sentimen-\ntalism more than of purity, true goodness, and humility of soul;\nthe mind is not drawn out of self, is not exercised and elevated by\nblessing others, by doing good works. \u201cPure religion and undefiled\nbefore God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows\nin their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.\u201d\nTrue religion ennobles the mind, refines the taste, sanctifies the judg-\nment, and makes its possessor partaker of the purity and influences [253]\nof heaven; it brings angels near, and separates more and more from\nthe spirit and influence of the world.\nBattle Creek, Michigan.\n* * * * *\nChapter 37\u2014Severity in Family Government\nBrother L,\nLast June I was shown that there is a work before you to correct\nyour ways. You do not see yourself. Your life has been a mistake.\nYou do not pursue a wise and merciful course in your family. You\nare exacting. If you continue to pursue the course that you have been\npursuing toward your wife and children, her days will be shortened,\nand your children will fear, but not love, you. You feel that your\ncourse is in Christian wisdom, but in this you deceive yourself.\nYou have peculiar views in regard to managing your family. You\nexercise an independent, arbitrary power which permits no liberty\nof will around you. You think yourself sufficient to be head in your\nfamily, and feel that your head is sufficient to move every member,\nas a machine is moved in the hands of the workmen. You dictate and\nassume authority. This displeases Heaven and grieves the pitying\nangels. You have conducted yourself in your family as though you\nalone were capable of self-government. It has offended you that\nyour wife should venture to oppose your opinion or question your\ndecisions.\nAfter much long-suffering on her part, and patient waiting upon\nyour whims, she has rebelled against unjust authority, and has be-\ncome nervous and distracted, and shown contempt for your course.\nYou have made the most of these manifestations on her part, and\nhave charged her with sin and being led by the spirit of the devil,\nwhen you were the one at fault. You drove her almost to desperation,\nand afterward taunted her with it. How easy it would have been for [254]\nyou to have made her life cheerful and pleasant. But it has been the\nopposite of this.\nYou have been rather indolent. You have not been ambitious to\nexercise the strength the Lord has given you. This is your capital. A\njudicious use of this strength, and persevering, industrious habits,\nwould have enabled you to obtain the comforts of life. You have\nerred, and thought it was pride which led your wife to desire to\n229\n230 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nhave things more comfortable around her. She has been stinted and\ndealt closely with by you. She needs a more generous diet, a more\nplentiful supply of food upon her table; and in her house she needs\nthings as comfortable and convenient as you can make them, things\nto make her work as easy as possible. But you have viewed matters\nfrom a wrong standpoint. You have thought that almost anything\nwhich could be eaten was good enough, if you could live upon it and\nretain strength. You have pleaded the necessity of spare diet to your\nfeeble wife. But she cannot make good blood or flesh upon the diet\nto which you could confine yourself, and flourish. Some persons\ncannot subsist upon the same food upon which others can do well,\neven though it be prepared in the same manner.\nYou are in danger of becoming an extremist. Your system could\nconvert a very coarse, poor diet into good blood. Your blood-making\norgans are in good condition. But your wife requires a more select\ndiet. Let her eat the same food which your system could convert\ninto good blood, and her system could not appropriate it. She lacks\nvitality, and needs a generous, strengthening diet. She should have a\ngood supply of fruit, and not be confined to the same things from\nday to day. She has a slender hold of life. She is diseased, and the\nwants of her system are far different from those of a healthy person.\nBrother L, you possess considerable dignity, but have you earned[255]\nthat dignity? Oh, no! You have assumed it. You have loved your\nease. You and hard work have not agreed. Had you not been slothful\nin business, you could have had many of the comforts of life which\nyou cannot now command. You have wronged your wife and your\nchildren by your indolent habits. Hours which should have been\noccupied in earnest labor have been passed away by you in talking\nand reading, and taking your ease.\nYou are just as accountable for your capital of strength as the\nwealthy man is for his riches. Both of you are stewards. To each is\ncommitted a work. You are not to abuse your strength, but to use\nit to acquire that with which you may liberally supply the wants\nof your family, and have wherewith to render to God by aiding in\nthe cause of present truth. You have been aware of the existence of\npride, and show, and vanity in -----, and have felt determined that\nyour example should not countenance this pride and extravagance.\nIn your effort to do this, your sin has been as great on the other side.\nSeverity in Family Government 231\nYou have been greatly at fault in your religious experience. You\nhave stood to one side as a looker-on, as a spectator, watching the\ndeficiencies and faults of others, and building yourself up because\nyou see wrongs in them. You have been careful, and upright in\ndeal, and as you have seen slackness in this respect in others who\nmake a high profession, you have contrasted their wrong with your\nprinciples in reference to deal, and have said in your heart, \u201cI am\nbetter than they,\u201d while at the same time you were standing off from\nthe church, watching and finding fault, yet doing nothing, not coming\nup to the help of the Lord, to remedy the evil. You had a standard by\nwhich you measured others. If they failed to meet your idea, your\nsympathy was not with them, and you had a self-complacent feeling\nin regard to yourself.\nYou have been exacting in your religious experience. Should [256]\nGod deal with you as you would have dealt with those you supposed\nin error in the church, and as you have dealt with your own family,\nyour condition would be bad indeed. But a merciful God, who is of\ntender pity, whose loving-kindness changeth not, has been forgiving,\nand has not cast you aside nor cut you off for your transgressions,\nyour numerous errors and backsliding. Oh, no! He has loved you\nstill.\nHave you really considered that \u201cwith what measure ye mete, it\nshall be measured to you again\u201d? You have seen pride, and vanity,\nand a world-loving spirit in some who profess to be Christians in ---\n--. This is a great evil; and because this spirit is indulged, angels are\ngrieved. Those who thus follow the example of the unconsecrated\nare exerting an influence to scatter from Christ, and are gathering in\ntheir garments the blood of souls. If they continue the same course\nthey will lose their own souls, and will know one day what it is to\nfeel the terrible weight of other souls who have been led astray by\ntheir unconsecration, while professing to be governed by religious\nprinciples.\nYou have just reason to be grieved with the pride and lack of\nsimplicity in those who profess better things. But you have watched\nothers, and talked of their errors and wrongs, and neglected your own\nsoul. You are not accountable for any of the sins of your brethren,\nunless your example has caused them to stumble, caused their feet\nto be diverted from the narrow path. You have a great and solemn\n232 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwork before you to control and subdue yourself, to become meek and\nlowly of heart, to educate yourself to be tenderhearted, pitiful in your\nfamily, and to possess that nobleness of spirit and true generosity of\nsoul which despises everything niggardly.\nYou have thought that there was too much work put upon the\nmeetinghouse, and have remarked upon the unnecessary expense.\nIt is needless in you to have these special conscientious scruples.[257]\nThere is nothing in that house which is prepared with too much care,\nneatness, or order. The work is none too nice. The arrangement is\nnot extravagant. Do those who are ready to complain of this house of\nworship consider for whom it was built? that it was made especially\nto be the house of God; to be dedicated to Him; to be a place\nwhere the people assemble to meet God? Many act as though the\nCreator of the heavens and the earth, He who has made everything\nthat is lovely and beautiful in our world, would be pleased to see a\nhouse erected for Him without order or beauty. Some build large,\nconvenient houses for themselves, but cannot afford to spend much\nupon a house which they are to dedicate to God. Every dollar of\nthe means in their hands is the Lord\u2019s. He has lent it to them for\na little while, to use to His glory; yet they hand out this means for\nthe advancement of the cause of God as though every dollar thus\nexpended were a total loss.\nGod would not have His people expend means extravagantly for\nshow or ornament, but He would have them observe neatness, order,\ntaste, and plain beauty in preparing a house for Him in which He is\nto meet with His people. Those who build a house for God should\nmanifest as much greater interest, care, and taste in its arrangement\nas the object for which it is prepared is higher and more holy than\nthat for which common dwelling houses are prepared.\nThe Lord reads the intents and purposes of men. Those who\nhave exalted views of His character will feel it their highest pleasure\nto have everything which has any connection with Him of the very\nbest work and displaying the very best taste. But those who can\ngrudgingly build a poorer house to dedicate to God than they would\naccept to live in themselves show their lack of reverence for God\nand for sacred things. Their work shows that their own temporal\nconcerns are of more value in their eyes than matters of a spiritual\nnature. Eternal things are made secondary. It is not considered[258]\nSeverity in Family Government 233\nessential to have good and convenient things to use in the service of\nGod, but they are considered highly essential in the concerns of this\nlife. Men will reveal the true moral tone of the principles of their\nhearts.\nMany of our people have become narrowed in their views. Order,\nneatness, taste, and convenience are termed pride and love of the\nworld. A mistake is made here. Vain pride, which is exhibited in\ngaudy trappings and needless ornaments, is not pleasing to God. But\nHe who created for man a beautiful world, and planted a lovely gar-\nden in Eden with every variety of trees for fruit and beauty, and who\ndecorated the earth with most lovely flowers of every description\nand hue, has given tangible proofs that He is pleased with the beau-\ntiful. Yet He will accept the most humble offering from the poorest,\nweakest child, if he has no better to present. It is the sincerity of the\nsoul that the Lord accepts. The man who has God enshrined in his\nheart, exalted above all, will be led to a thorough submission of his\nwill to God, and will make an entire surrender of himself to His rule\nand reign.\nShortsighted mortals do not comprehend the ways and works of\nGod. Their eyes are not directed upward to Him as they should be.\nThey do not have exalted views of eternal things. They only look at\nthese things with a clouded vision. They take no special delight in\ncontemplating the love of God, the glory and splendor of heaven, the\nexalted character of the holy angels, the majesty and inexpressible\nloveliness of Jesus, our Redeemer. They have so long kept earthly\nthings before their vision that eternal scenes are vague and indistinct\nto them. They have limited views of God, heaven, and eternity.\nSacred things are brought down upon a level with common;\ntherefore in their dealing with God they manifest the same close,\npenurious spirit as in dealing with their fellow men. Their offerings [259]\nto the Lord are lame, sick, or deficient. They carry on the same rob-\nbery with Him that they have with their fellow men. Their minds do\nnot reach up to an exalted moral standard, but remain on a low level;\nthey are constantly breathing the impure miasma of the lowlands of\nearth.\nBrother L, you rule with a rod of iron in your family. You are\nsevere in the government of your children. You will not gain their\nlove by this course of management. You are not tender, loving,\n234 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\naffectionate, and courteous to your wife; but are harsh, and bear\ndown upon her, blaming and censuring her. A well-regulated, or-\nderly family is a pleasing sight to God and ministering angels. You\nmust learn how to make a home orderly, comfortable, and pleasant.\nThen adorn that home with becoming dignity, and the spirit will be\nreceived by the children; and order, regularity, and obedience will\nbe more readily secured by both of you.\nBrother L, have you considered what a child is, and whither it\nis going? Your children are the younger members of the Lord\u2019s\nfamily\u2014brothers and sisters entrusted to your care by your heavenly\nFather for you to train and educate for heaven. When you are han-\ndling them so roughly as you have frequently done, do you consider\nthat God will call you to account for this dealing? You should not\nuse your children thus roughly. A child is not a horse or a dog to be\nordered about according to your imperious will, or to be controlled\nunder all circumstances by a stick or whip, or by blows with the\nhand. Some children are so vicious in their tempers that the infliction\nof pain is necessary, but very many cases are made much worse by\nthis manner of discipline.\nYou should control yourself. Never correct your children while\nimpatient or fretful, or while under the influence of passion. Punish\nthem in love, manifesting the unwillingness you feel to cause them\npain. Never raise your hand to give them a blow unless you can[260]\nwith a clear conscience bow before God and ask His blessing upon\nthe correction you are about to give. Encourage love in the hearts\nof your children. Present before them high and correct motives for\nself-restraint. Do not give them the impression that they must submit\nto control because it is your arbitrary will; because they are weak,\nand you are strong; because you are the father, they the children. If\nyou wish to ruin your family, continue to govern by brute force, and\nyou will surely succeed.\nYour wife is tenderhearted and easily agitated. She feels your\nharshness of discipline, and it leads her to the opposite extreme. She\nseeks to counteract your severity, and you charge this as a great lack\nin her of doing her duty and controlling her children. You think\nher indulgent, overfond, and tender. You cannot help her in this\nrespect until you correct yourself and manifest that parental tender-\nness which you should in your family. It is your wrong management\nSeverity in Family Government 235\nwhich leads your wife to be lax in her discipline. You must have\nyour nature softened. You need to be refined by the influences of the\nSpirit of God. You need a thorough conversion; then you can work\nfrom the right standpoint. You need to let love into your soul and\npermit it to occupy the place of self-dignity; self must die.\nYour wife needs tenderness and love. The Lord loves her. She\nis much nearer the kingdom of heaven than you. But she is dying\nby inches, and you are the one who is slowly taking her life. You\ncan make her life happy if you will. You can encourage her to lean\nupon your large affections, to confide in you and love you. You are\nweaning her heart from you. She shrinks from opening to you all the\nemotions of her soul, for you have treated her feelings with contempt;\nyou have ridiculed her fears and pompously advanced your opinion\nas though there were no appeal from that. Her respect for you will [261]\nsurely die if you continue the course you have commenced; and\nwhen respect is gone, love does not long abide.\nI implore you to turn rightabout and humble yourself to confess\nthat you have wronged your wife. She is not perfect. She has faults,\nbut she sincerely desires to serve God and to patiently endure your\ncourse toward her and your children. You are quick to detect your\nwife\u2019s errors, and when you can pick a flaw you will. She is weak;\nyet with her weaker strength she glorifies God better than you do\nwith your stronger powers.\nBattle Creek,\nJanuary 17, 1869.\n* * * * *\nChapter 38\u2014A Birthday Letter\nMy Dear Son,\nI write this for your nineteenth birthday. It has been a pleasure\nto have you with us a few weeks in the past. You are about to leave\nus, yet our prayers shall follow you.\nAnother year of your life closes today. How can you look back\nupon it? Have you made advancement in the divine life? Have you\nincreased in spirituality? Have you crucified self, with the affections\nand lusts? Have you an increased interest in the study of God\u2019s\nword? Have you gained decided victories over your own failings\nand waywardness? Oh, what has been the record of your life for the\nyear which has now passed into eternity, never to be recalled?\nAs you enter upon a new year, let it be with an earnest resolve\nto have your course onward and upward. Let your life be more\nelevated and exalted than it has hitherto been. Make it your aim not\nto seek your own interest and pleasure, but to advance the cause\nof your Redeemer. Remain not in a position where you ever need\nhelp yourself, and where others have to guard you to keep you in the[262]\nnarrow way. You may be strong to exert a sanctifying influence upon\nothers. You may be where your soul\u2019s interest will be awakened to\ndo good to others, to comfort the sorrowful, strengthen the weak,\nand to bear your testimony for Christ whenever opportunity offers.\nAim to honor God in everything, always and everywhere. Carry your\nreligion into everything. Be thorough in whatever you undertake.\nYou have not experienced the saving power of God as it is your\nprivilege, because you have not made it the great aim of your life\nto glorify Christ. Let every purpose you form, every work in which\nyou engage, and every pleasure you enjoy, be to the glory of God.\nLet this be the language of your heart: I am thine, O God, to live for\nThee, to work for Thee, and to suffer for Thee.\nMany profess to be on the Lord\u2019s side, but they are not; the\nweight of all their actions is on Satan\u2019s side. By what means shall\nwe determine whose side we are on? Who has the heart? With whom\n236\nBirthday Letter 237\nare our thoughts? Upon whom do we love to converse? Who has our\nwarmest affections and our best energies? If we are on the Lord\u2019s\nside, our thoughts are with Him, and our sweetest thoughts are of\nHim. We have no friendship with the world; we have consecrated\nall that we have and are to Him. We long to bear His image, breathe\nHis Spirit, do His will, and please Him in all things.\nYou should pursue so decided a course that none need to be\nmistaken in you. You cannot exert an influence upon the world\nwithout decision. Your resolutions may be good and sincere, but\nthey will prove a failure unless you make God your strength and\nmove forward with a firm determination of purpose. You should\nthrow your whole heart into the cause and work of God. You should\nbe in earnest to obtain an experience in the Christian life. You should\nexemplify Christ in your life.\nYou cannot serve God and mammon. You are either wholly on [263]\nthe Lord\u2019s side or on the side of the enemy. \u201cHe that is not with Me\nis against Me; and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad.\u201d\nSome persons make their religious life a failure because they are\nalways wavering and do not have determination. They are frequently\nconvicted and come almost up to the point of surrendering all for\nGod; but, failing to meet the point, they fall back again. While in\nthis state the conscience is hardening and becoming less and less\nsusceptible to the impressions of the Spirit of God. His Spirit has\nwarned, has convicted, and has been disregarded, until it is nearly\ngrieved away. God will not be trifled with. He shows duty clearly,\nand if there is a neglect to follow the light, it becomes darkness.\nGod bids you become a worker with Him in His vineyard. Com-\nmence just where you are. Come to the cross and there renounce\nself, the world, and every idol. Take Jesus into your heart fully. You\nare in a hard place to preserve consecration and to exert an influence\nwhich shall lead others from sin and pleasure and folly to the narrow\nway, cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in.\nMake an entire surrender to God; yield up everything unre-\nservedly, and thus seek for that peace which passes understanding.\nYou cannot draw nourishment from Christ unless you are in Him. If\nnot in Him, you are a branch that is withered. You do not feel your\nwant of purity and true holiness. You should feel an earnest desire\nfor the Holy Spirit and should pray earnestly to obtain it. You cannot\n238 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nexpect the blessing of God without seeking for it. If you used the\nmeans within your reach you would experience a growth in grace\nand would rise to a higher life.\nIt is not natural for you to love spiritual things; but you can ac-\nquire that love by exercising your mind, the strength of your being, in\nthat direction. The power of doing is what you need. True education[264]\nis the power of using our faculties so as to achieve beneficial results.\nWhy is it that religion occupies so little of our attention, while the\nworld has the strength of brain, bone, and muscle? It is because the\nwhole force of our being is bent in that direction. We have trained\nourselves to engage with earnestness and power in worldly business,\nuntil it is easy for the mind to take that turn. This is why Christians\nfind a religious life so hard and a worldly life so easy. The faculties\nhave been trained to exert their force in that direction. In religious\nlife there has been an assent to the truths of God\u2019s word, but not a\npractical illustration of them in the life.\nTo cultivate religious thoughts and devotional feelings is not\nmade a part of education. These should influence and control the\nentire being. The habit of doing right is wanting. There is spasmodic\naction under favorable influences, but to think naturally and readily\nupon divine things is not the ruling principle of the mind.\nThere is no need of being spiritual dwarfs if the mind is con-\ntinually exercised in spiritual things. But merely praying for this,\nand about this, will not meet the necessities of the case. You must\nhabituate the mind to concentration upon spiritual things. Exercise\nwill bring strength. Many professed Christians are in a fair way to\nlose both worlds. To be half a Christian and half a worldly man\nmakes you about one-hundredth part a Christian and all the rest\nworldly.\nSpiritual living is what God requires, yet thousands are crying\nout: \u201cI don\u2019t know what is the matter; I have no spiritual strength,\nI do not enjoy the Spirit of God.\u201d Yet the same ones will become\nactive and talkative, and even eloquent, when talking upon worldly\nmatters. Listen to such ones in meeting. About a dozen words\nare spoken in hardly an audible voice. They are men and women\nof the world. They have cultivated worldly propensities until their[265]\nfaculties have become strong in that direction. Yet they are as weak\nas babes in regard to spiritual things, when they should be strong and\nBirthday Letter 239\nintelligent. They do not love to dwell upon the mystery of godliness.\nThey know not the language of heaven and are not educating their\nminds so as to be prepared to sing the songs of heaven or to delight\nin the spiritual exercises which will there engage the attention of all.\nProfessed Christians, worldly Christians, are unacquainted with\nheavenly things. They will never be brought to the gates of the New\nJerusalem to engage in exercises which have not hitherto specially\ninterested them. They have not trained their minds to delight in\ndevotion and in meditation upon things of God and heaven. How,\nthen, can they engage in the services of heaven? how delight in the\nspiritual, the pure, the holy in heaven, when it was not a special\ndelight to them upon earth? The very atmosphere there will be\npurity itself. But they are unacquainted with it all. When in the\nworld, pursuing their worldly vocations, they knew just where to\ntake hold and just what to do. The lower order of faculties being in so\nconstant exercise, grew, while the higher, nobler powers of the mind,\nnot being strengthened by use, are incapable of awaking at once to\nspiritual exercises. Spiritual things are not discerned, because they\nare viewed with world-loving eyes, which cannot estimate the value\nand glory of the divine above the temporal.\nThe mind must be educated and disciplined to love purity. A love\nfor spiritual things should be encouraged; yea, must be encouraged,\nif you would grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth. Desires\nfor goodness and true holiness are right so far as they go; but if you\nstop here, they will avail nothing. Good purposes are right, but will\nprove of no avail unless resolutely carried out. Many will be lost\nwhile hoping and desiring to be Christians; but they made no earnest [266]\neffort, therefore they will be weighed in the balances and found\nwanting. The will must be exercised in the right direction. I will\nbe a wholehearted Christian. I will know the length and breadth,\nthe height and depth, of perfect love. Listen to the words of Jesus:\n\u201cBlessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for\nthey shall be filled.\u201d Ample provisions are made by Christ to satisfy\nthe soul that hungers and thirsts for righteousness.\nThe pure element of love will expand the soul for higher attain-\nments, for increased knowledge of divine things, so that it will not\nbe satisfied short of the fullness. Most professed Christians have no\nsense of the spiritual strength they might obtain were they as ambi-\n240 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ntious, zealous, and persevering to gain a knowledge of divine things\nas they are to obtain the paltry, perishable things of this life. The\nmasses professing to be Christians have been satisfied to be spiritual\ndwarfs. They have no disposition to make it their object to seek first\nthe kingdom of God and His righteousness; hence godliness is a\nhidden mystery to them, they cannot understand it. They know not\nChrist by experimental knowledge.\nLet those men and women who are satisfied with their dwarfed,\ncrippled condition in divine things be suddenly transported to heaven\nand for an instant witness the high, the holy state of perfection that\never abides there,\u2014every soul filled with love; every countenance\nbeaming with joy; enchanting music in melodious strains rising in\nhonor of God and the Lamb; and ceaseless streams of light flowing\nupon the saints from the face of Him who sitteth upon the throne, and\nfrom the Lamb; and let them realize that there is higher and greater\njoy yet to experience, for the more they receive of the enjoyment of\nGod, the more is their capacity increased to rise higher in eternal\nenjoyment, and thus continue to receive new and greater supplies[267]\nfrom the ceaseless sources of glory and bliss inexpressible,\u2014could\nsuch persons, I ask, mingle with the heavenly throng, participate\nin their songs, and endure the pure, exalted, transporting glory that\nemanates from God and the Lamb? Oh, no! their probation was\nlengthened for years that they might learn the language of heaven,\nthat they might become \u201cpartakers of the divine nature, having es-\ncaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.\u201d But they had\na selfish business of their own to engage the powers of their minds\nand the energies of their beings. They could not afford to serve God\nunreservedly and make this a business. Worldly enterprises must\ncome first and take the best of their powers, and a transient thought is\ndevoted to God. Are such to be transformed after the final decision:\n\u201cHe that is holy, let him be holy still,\u201d \u201che which is filthy, let him be\nfilthy still\u201d? Such a time is coming.\nThose who have trained the mind to delight in spiritual exercises\nare the ones who can be translated and not be overwhelmed with\nthe purity and transcendent glory of heaven. You may have a good\nknowledge of the arts, you may have an acquaintance with the\nsciences, you may excel in music and in penmanship, your manners\nmay please your associates, but what have these things to do with\nBirthday Letter 241\na preparation for heaven? What have they to do to prepare you to\nstand before the tribunal of God?\nBe not deceived. God is not mocked. Nothing but holiness will\nprepare you for heaven. It is sincere, experimental piety alone that\ncan give you a pure, elevated character and enable you to enter into\nthe presence of God, who dwelleth in light unapproachable. The\nheavenly character must be acquired on earth, or it can never be\nacquired at all. Then begin at once. Flatter not yourself that a time\nwill come when you can make an earnest effort easier than now.\nEvery day increases your distance from God. Prepare for eternity [268]\nwith such zeal as you have not yet manifested. Educate your mind\nto love the Bible, to love the prayer meeting, to love the hour of\nmeditation, and, above all, the hour when the soul communes with\nGod. Become heavenly-minded if you would unite with the heavenly\nchoir in the mansions above.\nA new year of your life now commences. A new page is turned\nin the book of the recording angel. What will be the record upon\nits pages? Shall it be blotted with neglect of God, with unfulfilled\nduties? God forbid. Let a record be stamped there which you will\nnot be ashamed to have revealed to the gaze of men and angels.\nGreenville, Michigan,\nJuly 27, 1868.\n* * * * *\nChapter 39\u2014Deceitfulness of Riches\nDear Sister M,\nWhen the Lord showed me your case, I was pointed back many\nyears in the past, when you became a believer in the near coming of\nChrist. You looked for, and loved, His appearing.\nYour husband was naturally an affectionate, noble-minded man;\nbut he relied upon his own strength, which was weakness. He did\nnot feel the need of making God his strength. Intoxicating drink\nbenumbed his brain and finally paralyzed the higher powers of his\nmind. His godlike manhood was sacrificed to gratify his thirst for\nstrong drink.\nYou suffered opposition and abuse, yet God was your source\nof strength. While you trusted in Him, He sustained you. In all\nyour trials you were not permitted to be overwhelmed. How often\nhave the heavenly angels strengthened you when desponding, by\npresenting vividly to your mind passages of Scripture expressing\nthe never-failing love of God, and giving evidence that His loving-\nkindness changeth not! Your soul trusted in God. It was your meat[269]\nand drink to do the will of your heavenly Father. At times you had a\nfirm trust in the promises of God, and then, again, your faith would\nbe tried to the utmost. God\u2019s dealings seemed mysterious, yet most\nof the time you had the evidence that He looked upon your affliction\nand would not cause your burdens to be greater than you could bear.\nThe Master saw that you needed a fitness for His heavenly king-\ndom. He did not leave you in the furnace for the fire of affliction to\nconsume. As a refiner and purifier of silver, He kept His eye upon\nyou, watching the process of purification until He should discern\nHis image reflected in you. Although you have often felt affliction\u2019s\nflame kindling upon you, and at times have thought it would con-\nsume you, yet the loving-kindness of God has been just as great\ntoward you at these times as when you were free in spirit and tri-\numphing in Him. The furnace was to purify and refine, but not to\nconsume and destroy.\n242\nDeceitfulness of Riches 243\nI saw you struggling with poverty, seeking to support yourself\nand your children. Many times you knew not what to do; the future\nlooked dark and uncertain. In your distress you cried unto the Lord,\nand He comforted and helped you, and hopeful rays of light shone\naround you. How precious was God to you at such times! how sweet\nHis comforting love! You felt that you had a precious treasure laid\nup in heaven. As you viewed the reward of the afflicted children of\nGod, what a consolation to feel that you could claim Him as your\nFather!\nYour case was, in reality, worse than if you had been widowed.\nYour heart was agonized by the wicked course pursued by your\nhusband. But his persecutions, his threats and violence, did not lead\nyou to trust in your own wisdom, and forget God. Far from this; you\nsensibly felt your weakness and that you were incapable of carrying\nyour burdens, and in your conscious weakness you were relieved [270]\nby bringing your heavy burdens to Jesus, the great Burden Bearer.\nHow you cherished every ray of light from His presence! and how\nstrong you often felt in His strength! When a storm of persecution\nand cruelty unexpectedly burst upon you, the Lord did not suffer you\nto be overwhelmed; but in those times of trial you realized strength,\ncalmness, and peace, which were a marvel to you.\nWhen railing accusations and taunts more cruel than spears and\narrows have fallen upon you, the influence of the Spirit of God\nupon your heart has led you to speak calmly, dispassionately. It\nwas not in nature to do this. It was the fruit of the Spirit of God.\nIt was the grace of God which strengthened your faith amid all the\nheartsicknesses of hope deferred. Grace fortified you for the warfare\nand hardships, and brought you through conqueror. Grace taught\nyou to pray, to love and trust, notwithstanding your unfavorable\nsurroundings. As you repeatedly realized that your prayers were\nanswered in a special manner, you did not feel that it was because of\nany merit in yourself, but because of your great need. Your necessity\nwas God\u2019s opportunity. Your life in those days of trial was to trust\nin God. And the manifestations of His special deliverance when in\nmost trying places were like the oasis in the desert to the faint and\nweary traveler.\nThe Lord did not leave you to perish. He frequently raised\nup friends to aid you when you least expected it. Angels of God\n244 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nministered unto you, as step by step they led you up the rugged\npathway. You were pressed by poverty, but this was the least of\nthe difficulties with which you had to contend. When N exercised\nhis power to abuse and harm you, you felt that the cup you had to\ndrink was bitter indeed; and when he degraded himself to pursue a\ncourse of iniquity, and you were outraged and insulted in your own\nhouse, he made a gulf between himself and you which could never[271]\nbe passed. Then in your sore distress and perplexity the Lord raised\nyou up friends. He did not leave you alone; but His strength was\nimparted, and you could say: \u201cThe Lord is my helper.\u201d\nThrough all your trials, which have never been fully revealed to\nothers, you have had a never-failing Friend, who has said: \u201cI am\nwith you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d While upon the\nearth, He was ever touched with human woe. Although He is now\nascended to His Father, and is adored by angels who quickly obey\nHis commands, His heart, which loved, pitied, and sympathized,\nknows no change. It remains a heart of unchangeable tenderness\nstill. That same Jesus was acquainted with all your trials, and did\nnot leave you alone to struggle with temptations, battle with evil,\nand be finally crushed with burdens and sorrow. Through His angels\nHe whispered to you: \u201c\u2018Fear not, for I am with thee.\u2019 \u2018I am He\nthat liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore.\u2019\nI know your sorrows; I have endured them. I am acquainted with\nyour struggles; I have experienced them. I know your temptations;\nI have encountered them. I have seen your tears; I also have wept.\nYour earthly hopes are crushed; but let the eye of faith be uplifted\nand penetrate the veil, and there anchor your hopes. The everlasting\nassurance shall be yours that you have a Friend that sticketh closer\nthan a brother.\u201d\nO my dear sister, if you could only see, as I have seen, the ways\nand works of God manifested all through your perplexities and trials\nin the former part of your experience, when pressed by the hand of\npoverty, you could never forget Him, but your love would increase,\nand your zeal to promote His glory be untiring.\nIn consequence of your afflictions and peculiar trials, your health\nfailed. The friends of the cause of God were but few, and many[272]\nof them were poor; and you could see but little to hope for on the\nright hand or on the left. You looked upon your children and your\nDeceitfulness of Riches 245\ndestitute, helpless condition, and your heart well-nigh fainted. At\nthis time, through the influence of Adventists who had united with\nthe Shakers, and in whom you had confidence because they had been\nyour friends in time of need, you were induced to go among that sect\nfor a time. But the angels of God did not leave you. They ministered\nunto you and were as a wall of fire round about you. Especially\ndid the holy angels protect you from the deceptive influences which\nprevail among that people. The Shakers believed that you would\nunite your interest with theirs; and they thought that if they could\ninduce you to become one of them, you would be a great help to their\ncause; for you would make an ardent member of their society. They\nwould have given you a high position among them. Some of the\nShakers had received spiritual manifestations, telling them that you\nwere designed of God to be a prominent member of their society;\nbut that you were one who should not be urged; that kindness would\nhave a powerful influence where force or pressure would cause a\nfailure of their hopes.\nMagnetism was exercised among them in a powerful manner.\nThrough this power they flattered themselves that you would be\nbrought to view things in the same light in which they viewed them.\nYou were not aware of all the arts and deception used to bring about\ntheir purpose. The Lord preserved you. There seemed to be a circle\nof light round about you, proceeding from the ministering angels, so\nthat the darkness which prevailed about you did not cloud the circle\nof light. The Lord opened the way for you to leave that deceived\ncommunity, and you left unharmed, the principles of your faith as\npure as when you went among them.\nYour diseased arm was a great affliction. You had turned to the [273]\nright and to the left for help. You had consented to have a woman\ntry her boasted skill upon you. This woman was a special agent\nof Satan. Through her experiments, you nearly lost your life. The\npoison introduced into your system was sufficient to kill a person\nof the most robust constitution. Here again God interposed, or your\nlife would have been sacrificed.\nEvery means you had resorted to for the recovery of health had\nfailed. Not only your arm, but your entire system, was diseased.\nYour lungs were affected, and you were fast going down to death.\nAt this time you felt that God alone could deliver. You could do one\n246 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthing more; you could follow the direction of the apostle in the fifth\nchapter of James. You there made a covenant with God, that if He\nwould spare your life to minister still to the wants of your children,\nyou would be for the Lord, and Him only would you serve; you\nwould dedicate your life to His glory; you would use your strength\nto advance His cause and to do good in the earth. Angels recorded\nthe promise there made to God.\nWe came to you in your great affliction and claimed the promise\nof God in your behalf. We dared not look to appearances; for in so\ndoing we should be like Peter, whom the Lord bade come to Him\non the water. He should have kept his eye lifted upward to Jesus;\nbut he looked down at the troubled waves, and his faith failed. We\ncalmly and firmly grasped the promises of God alone, irrespective\nof appearances, and by faith claimed the blessing. I was especially\nshown that God wrought in a wonderful manner, and you were\npreserved by a miracle of mercy, to be a living monument of His\nhealing power, to testify of His wondrous works to the children of\nmen.\nAt the time you felt such a decided change, your captivity was\nturned, and joy and gladness in the place of doubt and distress filled[274]\nyour heart. The praise of God was in your heart and upon your\nlips. \u201cOh, what hath the Lord wrought!\u201d was the sentiment of your\nsoul. The Lord heard the prayers of His servants, and raised you up\nto still live and endure trials, to watch and wait for His appearing,\nand to glorify His name. Poverty and care pressed heavily upon\nyou. As dark clouds at times enshrouded you, you could not forbear\ninquiring: \u201cO God, hast Thou forsaken me?\u201d But you were not\nforsaken, although you could see no way open before you. The\nLord would have you trust in His love and mercy amid clouds and\ndarkness, as well as in the sunshine. At times the clouds would\npart, and beams of light would shine through to strengthen your\ndesponding heart and increase your wavering confidence, and you\nwould again fix your trembling faith upon the sure promises of your\nheavenly Father. You would involuntarily cry out: \u201cO God, I will\nbelieve; I will trust in Thee. Thou hast hitherto been my helper, and\nThou wilt not leave me now.\u201d\nAs victory was gained by you, and light again shone upon you,\nyou could not find language to express your sincere gratitude to your\nDeceitfulness of Riches 247\ngracious heavenly Father; and you thought you never again would\ndoubt His love nor distrust His care. You did not seek for ease. You\ndid not consider hard labor a burden if the way would only open that\nyou might care for your children and shield them from the iniquity\nprevailing in this age of the world. It was the burden of your heart\nthat you might see them turning to the Lord. You pleaded before\nGod for your children with strong cries and tears. Their conversion\nyou so much desired. Sometimes your heart would despond and\nfaint, and you would fear that your prayers would not be answered;\nthen again you would consecrate your children to God afresh, and\nyour yearning heart would lay them anew upon the altar.\nWhen they went into the army, your prayers followed them. They [275]\nwere wonderfully preserved from harm. They called it good luck;\nbut a mother\u2019s prayers from an anxious, burdened soul, as she felt\nthe peril of her children and the danger of their being cut off in their\nyouth without hope in God, had much to do with their preservation.\nHow many prayers were lodged in heaven that these sons might be\npreserved to obey God, to devote their lives to His glory! In your\nanxiety for your children you pleaded with God to return them to\nyou again, and you would seek more earnestly to lead them in the\npath of holiness. You thought you would labor more faithfully than\nyou had ever done.\nThe Lord suffered you to be schooled in adversity and affliction,\nthat you might obtain an experience which would be valuable to\nyourself and others. In the days of your poverty and trial you loved\nthe Lord, and you loved religious privileges. The nearness of Christ\u2019s\ncoming was your consolation. It was a living hope to you that you\nwould soon find rest from labor, and the end of all your trials; when\nyou would find that you had not labored nor suffered too much; for\nthe apostle Paul declares: \u201cOur light affliction, which is but for a\nmoment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of\nglory.\u201d\nTo meet with the people of God seemed to you almost like visit-\ning heaven. Obstacles did not deter you. You could suffer weariness\nand hunger for temporal food, but you could not be deprived of\nspiritual food. You earnestly sought for the grace of God, and you\ndid not seek in vain. Communion with the people of God was the\nrichest blessing you could enjoy.\n248 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nIn your Christian experience your soul abhorred vanity, pride,\nand extravagant show. When you have witnessed the expenditure of\nmeans among professed Christians to make a display and to foster\npride, your heart and lips have said: \u201cOh, if I only had the means[276]\nhandled by those who are unfaithful in their stewardship, I would\nfeel it one of the greatest privileges to help the needy and to aid in\nthe advancement of the cause of God!\u201d\nYou often realized the presence of God while you sought in\nyour humble way to enlighten others in regard to the truth for these\nlast days. You had experienced the truth for yourself. That which\nyou had seen, and heard, and experienced, and testified unto, you\nknew was no fiction. You delighted to present before others, in\nprivate conversation, the wonderful way in which God had led His\npeople. You recounted His dealings with such an assurance as to\nstrike conviction to the hearts of those who listened to you. You\ntalked as though you had a knowledge of the things whereof you\naffirmed. When speaking to others in regard to the present truth,\nyou longed for greater opportunities and a more extended influence,\nthat you might bring to the notice of many in darkness the light\nwhich had lightened your pathway. At times you looked at your\npoverty, your limited influence, and your best endeavors, frequently\nmisinterpreted by the professed friends of the cause of truth, and\nyou were nearly discouraged.\nSometimes in your unsettled state you erred in judgment, and\nthere were those who should have possessed that charity which\nthinketh no evil, who watched, and surmised evil, and made the\nmost of the errors they thought they saw in you. But the love and\ntender pity of Jesus were not withdrawn; they were your support\namid the trials and persecutions of your life. The kingdom of heaven\nand the righteousness of Christ were primary with you. Your life\nwas marred with imperfections, because it is human to err; but from\nwhat the Lord has been pleased to show me of your discouraging\nsurroundings in the days of your poverty and trial, I know of no one\nwho would have pursued a course more free from mistakes than you[277]\ndid, were they situated as you were, in poverty and embarrassing\ntrials. It is easy for those who are spared the severe trials to which\nothers are subjected, to look on and question, and surmise evil and\nfind fault. Some are more ready to censure others for pursuing a\nDeceitfulness of Riches 249\ncertain course than to take the responsibility of saying what should\nbe done, or of pointing out a more correct way.\nYou became confused. You knew not where to trust. There\nwere but few Sabbathkeepers in ----- and vicinity who exerted a\nsaving influence. Some who professed the faith were no honor to the\ncause of present truth. They did not gather with Christ, but scattered\nabroad. They could talk loud and long; yet their hearts were not\nin the work. They were not sanctified by the truth they professed.\nThese, not having root in themselves, gave up the faith. Had they\ndone this at an earlier period, it would have been better for the cause\nof truth. In consequence of these things, Satan took advantage of\nyou and prepared the way for your backsliding.\nMy attention was called to your desire to possess means. The\nsentiment of your heart was: \u201cOh, if I only had means, I would\nnot squander it! I would set an example to those who are close\nand penurious. I would show them the great blessing there is to be\nreceived in doing good.\u201d Your soul abhorred covetousness. As you\nhave seen those who possessed abundance of this world\u2019s goods shut\ntheir hearts to the cry of the needy you have said: \u201cGod will visit\nthem; He will reward them according to their works.\u201d As you have\nseen the wealthy walking in their pride, their hearts girt about with\nselfishness, as with iron bands, you have felt that they were poorer\nthan yourself, although you were in want and suffering. When you\nhave seen these purse-proud men bearing themselves loftily because\nmoney has power, you have felt pity for them, and in no case would\nyou have been induced to change places with them. Yet you desired [278]\nmeans that you might so use it as to be a rebuke to the covetous.\nThe Lord said to His angel who had hitherto ministered unto\nyou: \u201cI have proved her in poverty and affliction, and she has not\nseparated herself from Me, nor rebelled against Me. I will now\nprove her with prosperity. I will reveal to her a page of the human\nheart with which she is unacquainted. I will show her that money\nis the most dangerous foe she has ever met. I will reveal to her the\ndeceitfulness of riches; that they are a snare, even to those who feel\nthat they are secure from selfishness, and proof against exaltation,\nextravagance, pride, and love of the praise of men.\u201d\nI was then shown that a way was opened for you to improve your\ncondition in life and at length to obtain the means which you had\n250 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthought you would use with wisdom and to the glory of God. How\nanxiously did your ministering angel watch the new trial to see how\nyou would stand the test. As means came into your hands, I saw\nyou gradually and almost imperceptibly separating from God. The\nmeans entrusted to you were expended for your own convenience, to\nsurround yourself with the good things of this life. I saw the angels\nlooking upon you with yearning sadness, their faces half averted,\nloath to leave you. Yet their presence was not perceived by you, and\nyour course was pursued without reference to your angel guard.\nThe business and cares of your new position claimed your time\nand attention, and your duty to God was not considered. Jesus had\npurchased you by His own blood. You were not your own. Your\ntime, your strength, and the means you handled all belonged to your\nRedeemer. He had been your constant Friend, your strength and\nsupport when every other friend had proved a broken reed. You have\nrepaid the love and bounty of God with ingratitude and forgetfulness.\nYour only safety was in implicit trust in Christ, your Saviour.[279]\nThere was no safety for you away from the cross. How weak human\nstrength seemed in this instance! Oh, how evident that there is no\nreal strength but that which God imparts to those who trust in Him!\nOne petition offered up to God in faith has more power than a wealth\nof human intellect.\nIn your prosperity you did not carry out the resolves you had\nmade in adversity. The deceitfulness of riches turned you from your\npurposes. Cares increased upon you. Your influence became ex-\ntended. As the afflicted realized relief from suffering, they glorified\nyou, and you learned to love praise from the lips of poor mortals.\nYou were in a popular city, and thought it necessary for the success\nof your business, as well as to retain your influence, for your sur-\nroundings to be somewhat in accordance with your business. But\nyou carried things too far. You were swayed too much by the opin-\nions and judgment of others. You expended means needlessly, only\nto gratify the lust of the eye and the pride of life. You forgot that you\nwere handling your Lord\u2019s money. When means were expended by\nyou which would only encourage vanity, you did not consider that\nthe recording angel was making a record which you would blush to\nmeet again. Said the angel, pointing to you: \u201cYou glorified yourself,\nDeceitfulness of Riches 251\nbut did not magnify God.\u201d You even gloried in the fact that it was in\nyour power to purchase these things.\nA large sum has been expended in needless things which could\nonly answer for show and encourage vanity and pride that will cause\nyou remorse and shame. If you had borne in mind the claims Heaven\nhas upon you and had made a right disposition of the means entrusted\nto your care, by helping the needy and advancing the cause of present\ntruth, you would have been laying up treasure in heaven and would\nhave been rich toward God. Consider how much means you have [280]\ninvested where no one has been really benefited, no one fed or\nclothed, and no one helped to see the error of his ways that he might\nturn to Christ and live.\nYou have made large investments in uncertain enterprises. Satan\nblinded your eyes so that you could not see that these enterprises\nwould yield you no returns. The enterprise of securing eternal life\ndid not awaken your interest. Here you could have expended means,\nand run no risks, met no disappointments, and in the end would\nhave received immense profits. Here you could have invested in\nthe never-failing bank of heaven. Here you could have bestowed\nyour treasures where no thief approacheth nor rust corrupteth. This\nenterprise is eternal and is as much nobler than any earthly enterprise\nas the heavens are higher than the earth.\nYour children were not disciples of Christ. They were in friend-\nship with the world, and their natural hearts desired to be like\nworldlings. The lust of the eye and the pride of life controlled\nthem and have influenced you to a certain extent. You have sought\nmore earnestly to please and gratify your children than to please and\nglorify God. You have forgotten the claims of God upon you, and\nthe wants of His cause. Selfishness has led you to expend money in\nornaments for the gratification of yourself and your children. You\ndid not think that this money was not yours; that it was only lent\nyou to test and prove you, to see if you would shun the evils you had\nmarked in others. God made you His steward, and when He cometh\nand reckoneth with His servants, what account can you give of your\nstewardship?\nYour faith and simple trust in God began to wane as soon as\nmeans flowed in upon you. You did not depart from God all at\nonce. Your backsliding was gradual. You ceased the morning and\n252 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nevening devotions because it was not always convenient. Your son\u2019s[281]\nwife caused you trials of a peculiar, aggravating character, which\nhad considerable to do in discouraging you from continuing family\ndevotions. Your house became a prayerless house. Your business\nwas made primary, and the Lord and His truth were made secondary.\nLook back to the days of your earlier experience; would these trials\nthen have driven you from family prayer?\nHere, in the neglect of vocal prayer, you lost an influence in\nyour house which you could have retained. It was your duty to\nacknowledge God in your family, irrespective of consequences. Your\npetitions should have been offered to God morning and evening. You\nshould have been as priest of the household, confessing your sins\nand the sins of your children. Had you been faithful, God, who had\nbeen your guide, would not have left you to your own wisdom.\nMeans were expended needlessly for show. Over this sin in\nothers you had felt deeply grieved. And while thus using means,\nyou were robbing God. Then the Lord said: \u201cI will scatter. I will\npermit her for a time to walk in the way of her own choosing. I\nwill blind judgment, and remove wisdom. I will show her that her\nstrength is weakness, and her wisdom foolishness. I will humble\nher, and open her eyes to see how far she has departed from Me. If\nshe will not then turn unto Me with her whole heart, and in all her\nways acknowledge Me, My hand shall scatter, and the pride of the\nmother and of the children shall be brought down, and poverty shall\nagain be their lot. My name shall be exalted. The loftiness of man\nshall be brought down, and the pride of man shall be laid low.\u201d\nThe above view was given December 25, 1865, in the city of\nRochester, New York. Last June I was shown that the Lord was\ndealing with you in love, that He now invited you to turn to Him that\nyou might live. I was shown that for years you have felt that you\nwere in a backslidden state. If you had been consecrated to God you[282]\nmight have done a good and great work in letting your light shine to\nothers. To everyone there is given a work to do for the Master. To\neach of His servants are committed special gifts, or talents. \u201cUnto\none he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every\nman according to his several ability.\u201d Every servant has some trust\nfor which he is responsible; and the varied trusts are proportioned to\nour varied capabilities. In dispensing His gifts, God has not dealt\nDeceitfulness of Riches 253\nwith partiality. He has distributed the talents according to the known\npowers of His servants, and He expects corresponding returns.\nIn your earlier experience the Lord imparted to you talents of\ninfluence, but did not give you talents of means, and therefore did\nnot expect you in your poverty to bestow that which you had not\nto give. Like the widow, you did give what you could, although,\nhad you considered your own circumstances, you would have felt\nexcused from doing even as much as you did. In your sickness, God\ndid not require from you that active energy of which disease had\ndeprived you. Though you were restricted in your influence and in\nyour means, yet God accepted your efforts to do good and to advance\nHis cause according to what you had, not according to what you had\nnot. The Lord does not despise the humblest offering bestowed with\nreadiness and sincerity.\nYou possess an ardent temperament. Earnestness in a good\ncause is praiseworthy. In your former trials and perplexity, you were\nobtaining an experience which was to be of advantage to others.\nYou were zealous in the service of God. You loved to present the\nevidences of our position to those who did not believe present truth.\nYou could speak with assurance, for these things were a reality to\nyou. The truth was a part of your being; and those who listened\nto your earnest appeals had not a doubt of your honesty, but were [283]\nconvinced that these things were so.\nIn the providence of God your influence has been extended; in\naddition to this, God has seen fit to prove you by giving you talents\nof means. You are thereby laid under double responsibility. When\nyour condition in life began to improve, you said: \u201cAs soon as I can\nget me a home, I will then donate to the cause of God.\u201d But when\nyou had a home you saw so many improvements to make to have\neverything about you convenient and pleasant that you forgot the\nLord and His claims upon you, and were less inclined to help the\ncause of God than in the days of your poverty and affliction.\nYou were seeking friendship with the world, and separating\nfurther and further from God. You forgot the exhortation of Christ:\n\u201cTake heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged\nwith surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that\nday come upon you unawares.\u201d \u201cLet him that thinketh he standeth\ntake heed lest he fall.\u201d\n254 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nThere are three watchwords in the Christian life, which must be\nheeded if we would not have Satan steal a march upon us; namely,\nWatch, pray, work. Prayer and watching thereunto are necessary\nfor advancement in the divine life. Never was there a time in your\nhistory more important than the present. Your only safety is to live\nlike a watchman. Watch and pray always. Oh, what a preventive\nagainst yielding to temptation and falling into the snares of the\nworld! How earnestly should you have been at work the past few\nyears, when your influence was extensive.\nDear sister, the praise of men and the flattery current in the world\nhave had greater influence upon you than you have been aware of.\nYou have not been improving your talents\u2014putting them out to\nthe exchangers. You are naturally affectionate and generous. These[284]\ntraits of character have been exercised to a degree, but not as much as\nGod requires. Merely possessing these excellent gifts is not enough;\nGod requires them to be kept in constant exercise; for through them\nHe blesses those who need to be helped, and carries forward His\nwork for the salvation of man.\nThe Lord will not depend upon niggardly souls to take care of the\nworthy poor nor to sustain His cause. Such are too narrow-minded;\nthey would grudge the smallest pittance to the needy in their distress.\nThey would also want the cause narrowed down to meet their limited\nideas. To save means would be the prominent idea with them. Their\nmoney would be more valuable to them than precious souls for\nwhom Christ died. The lives of such, so far as God and heaven are\nconcerned, are worse than a blank. God will not trust His important\nwork with them.\n\u201cCurse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly\nthe inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the\nLord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty.\u201d What had Meroz\ndone? Nothing. This was their sin. The curse of God came upon\nthem for what they had not done. The man with a selfish, narrow\nmind is responsible for his niggardliness, but those who have kindly\naffections, generous impulses, and a love for souls are laid under\nweighty responsibilities; for if they allow these talents to remain\nunemployed and to waste they are classed with unfaithful servants.\nThe mere possession of these gifts is not enough. Those who have\nDeceitfulness of Riches 255\nthem should realize that their obligations and responsibilities are\nincreased.\nThe Master will require each of His stewards to give an account\nof his stewardship, to show what he has gained with the talents\nentrusted to him. Those to whom rewards are given will impute no\nmerit to themselves for their diligent trading; they will give all the [285]\nglory to God. They speak of that which was delivered to them, as\n\u201cThy pound,\u201d not their own. When they speak of their gain, they\nare careful to state whence it came. The capital was advanced by\nthe Master. They have traded upon it successfully, and return the\nprincipal and interest to the Giver. He rewards their efforts as if the\nmerit belonged to them, when they owe all to the grace and mercy\nof the bountiful Giver. His words of unqualified approval fall upon\ntheir ears: \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast\nbeen faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many\nthings: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d\nTo you, my sister, are committed talents of influence and talents\nof money; and your responsibility is great. You should move cau-\ntiously and in the fear of God. Your wisdom is weakness, but the\nwisdom from above is strong. The Lord designs to enlighten your\ndarkness and again give you a glimpse of the heavenly treasure, that\nyou may have some sense of the comparative value of both worlds,\nand then leave you to choose between this world and the eternal\ninheritance. I saw that there was yet opportunity to return to the\nfold. Jesus has redeemed you by His own blood, and He requires\nyou to employ your talents in His service. You have not become\nhardened to the influence of the Holy Spirit. When the truth of God\nis presented, it meets a response in your heart.\nI saw that you should study every move. You should do nothing\nrashly. Let God be your counselor. He loves your children, and it\nis right that you should love them; but it is not right to give them\nthe place in your affections that the Lord claims. They have kind\nimpulses and generous purposes. They possess noble traits of char-\nacter. If they would only see their need of a Saviour, and bow at the\nfoot of the cross, they might exert an influence for good. They are\nnow lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. They now stand in [286]\nthe enemy\u2019s ranks, under the black banner of Satan. Jesus invites\n256 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthem to come to Him, to leave the ranks of the enemy, and to stand\nunder the bloodstained banner of the cross of Christ.\nThis will look to them like a work they cannot perform, for it will\nrequire too much self-denial. They have no experimental knowledge\nof the way. Those who have engaged in their country\u2019s warfare, and\nbeen subjected to the hardships, toils, and perils of a soldier\u2019s life,\nshould be the last to hesitate and manifest cowardice in this great\nwarfare for everlasting life. In this case they will be fighting for\na crown of life and an immortal inheritance. Their wages will be\nsure, and when the war is over their gain will be everlasting life,\nhappiness unalloyed, and an eternal weight of glory.\nSatan will oppose every effort they may make. He will present\nthe world before them in its most attractive light, as he did to the\nSaviour of the world when he tempted Him forty days in the wilder-\nness. Christ overcame all the temptations of Satan, and so may your\nchildren. They are serving a hard master. The wages of sin is death.\nThey cannot afford to sin. They will find it expensive business. They\nwill meet with eternal loss in the end. They will lose the mansions\nJesus has gone to prepare for those who love Him, and will lose\nthat life which measures with the life of God. And this is not all.\nThey must suffer the wrath of an offended God for having withheld\nfrom Him their service and given all their efforts to His worst enemy.\nYour children have not yet had the clear light, and condemnation\nonly follows the rejection of light.\nIf professed Christians were all sincere and earnest in their efforts\nto promote the glory of God, what a stir would be made in the\nenemy\u2019s ranks. Satan is earnest and sincere in his work. He does not\nwant souls saved. He does not want his power upon them broken.[287]\nSatan does not merely pretend. He is in earnest. He beholds Christ\ninviting souls to come to Him that they may have life, and he is\nearnest and zealous in his efforts to prevent them from accepting\nthe invitation. He will leave no means untried to prevent them from\nleaving his ranks and standing in the ranks of Christ. Why cannot the\nprofessed followers of Jesus do as much for Him as His enemies do\nagainst Him? Why not do all they can? Satan does all he can to keep\nsouls from Christ. He was once an honored angel in heaven, and\nalthough he has lost his holiness, he has not lost his power. He exerts\nhis power with terrible effect. He does not wait for his prey to come\nDeceitfulness of Riches 257\nto him. He hunts for it. He goes to and fro in the earth like a roaring\nlion, seeking whom he may devour. He does not always wear the\nferocious look of the lion, but when he can work to better effect he\ntransforms himself into an angel of light. He can readily exchange\nthe roar of the lion for the most persuasive arguments or for the\nsoftest whisper. He has legions of angels to aid him in his work.\nHe often conceals his snares, and allures by pleasing deception. He\ncharms and deludes many by flattering their vanity. Through his\nagents he presents the pleasures of the world in an attractive light,\nand strews the path to hell with tempting flowers, and thus souls\nare charmed and ruined. After every advance step in the downward\nroad, Satan has some special temptation to lead them still further on\nthe wrong track.\nIf your children were controlled by religious principles, they\nwould be fortified against the vice and corruption surrounding them\nin this degenerate age. God will be to them a tower of strength, if\nthey will put their trust in Him. \u201cLet him take hold of My strength,\nthat he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with\nMe.\u201d The Lord will be the guide of their youth if they will believe\nand trust in Him.\nMy dear sister, the Lord has been very merciful to you and your [288]\nfamily. You are laid under obligation to your heavenly Father to\npraise and glorify His holy name upon the earth. In order to continue\nin His love, you should labor constantly for humbleness of mind and\nthat meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great price.\nYour strength in God will increase while you consecrate all to Him;\nso that you can say with confidence: \u201cWho shall separate us from\nthe love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or\nfamine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?\u201d \u201cFor I am persuaded, that\nneither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor\nthings present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any\nother creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God,\nwhich is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 40\u2014Self-Deceived Youth\nBrother O,\nI have been shown in vision the dangers of youth. Your case\nwas presented before me. I saw that you had not adorned your\nprofession. You might have done good, and your example might\nhave been a blessing to the youth with whom you have associated;\nbut, alas! your inmost soul has not been converted to God. If you\nhad taken the course a consistent Christian should, your relatives\nand friends would have been influenced by your godly course to\nfollow in your footsteps. My brother, your heart is not right with\nGod; your thoughts are not elevated; you permit your mind to run\nin a wrong channel. Your morals have not taken a pure, elevated\ntone. Your habits have been such as to injure your physical health\nand have been death to spirituality. You cannot prosper in religious\nthings until you are converted.\nWhen you realize the transforming influence of the power of[289]\nGod upon your heart, it will be seen in your life. You have lacked a\nreligious experience, but it is not too late for you now to seek God\nwith earnest, heartfelt cries: \u201cWhat shall I do to be saved?\u201d You can\nnever be a true Christian until you are thoroughly converted. You\nhave been a lover of pleasure more than a lover of God. You have\nbeen seeking after pleasure, but have you found real enjoyment in\nthis course? You have sought to make yourself agreeable to young,\ninexperienced girls. You have had your mind so much upon them\nthat you could not direct it upward to God and heaven. \u201cCleanse\nyour hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.\u201d\nThis exhortation is applicable to you. You need to learn the ways,\nthe will and works of God. You need pure and undefiled religion;\nyou need to cultivate devotional feelings. Cease to do evil, and learn\nto do well. The blessing of God cannot rest upon you until you\nbecome more like Christ.\nI am pained as I see the lack of godliness with the young. Satan\ntakes the mind and turns it in a channel which is corrupt. A self-\n258\nSelf-Deceived Youth 259\ndeception is upon many of the young. They think they are Christians,\nbut they have never been converted. Until this work shall be wrought\nin them, they will not understand the mystery of godliness. There\nis no peace to the wicked. God requires truth and sincerity of heart.\nHe sees and pities you, and all the youth who are eagerly following\nchildish toys and wasting short, precious time for things of no value.\nChrist has bought you at a dear price, and offers you grace and glory\nif you will receive it; but you turn from the precious promise of the\ngift of everlasting life, to the meager and unsatisfactory pleasures of\nearth.\nYour labor in this direction will bring no profit, but great loss.\nThe wages of sin is death. Life and heaven are before you, but you [290]\nseem not to know their value. You have not meditated upon the\nprecious things of heaven. If the inestimable love of Christ be turned\nfrom, if heaven and glory and everlasting life be considered of little\nvalue, what motive can we present to move? what inducement to\ncharm? Will foolish sports and a round of exciting pleasures attract\nthe mind, and separate from God, and deaden the heart to His fear?\nOh, I beg of you who have so little interest in holy things, to\nclosely investigate your own heart. What plea will you make before\nGod for your worldly, unconsecrated life? In that dread day you will\nhave no plea to make. You will be speechless. Think, oh, think, in\nyour pleasure-seeking hours, that all these things have an end. Did\nyou have correct views of life, endless life with God, how quickly\nwould you turn from a life of pleasure and sin. How quickly would\nyou change your mind, your course, and your company, and turn\nthe strength of your affection to God and heavenly things. How\nresolutely would you scorn to yield to temptations which have de-\nceived and captivated you. How zealous would be your efforts for\nthe blessed life; how earnest and persevering your prayers to God\nfor His grace to abide upon you, for His power to sustain you and\nhelp you resist the devil. How diligent would you be to improve\nevery religious privilege to learn the ways and will of God. How\ncareful would you be in meditating upon the law of God, and in\ncomparing your life with its claims. How fearful would you be lest\nyou sin in word or deed, and how earnest to grow in grace and true\nholiness. Your conversation would not be on trifling things, but in\nheaven. Then glorious and eternal things would open before you,\n260 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nand you would not rest until you should increase more and more\nin spirituality. But earthly things claim your attention, and God is\nforgotten. I implore you to face rightabout, and to seek the Lord,[291]\nthat He may be found of you; call upon Him while He is near.\n* * * * *\nChapter 41\u2014True Conversion\nDear Brother P ,\nWhile at ----- one year ago, we labored for your interest. I had\nbeen shown your dangers, and we were desirous of saving you; but\nwe see you have not had strength to carry out the resolutions there\nmade. I am troubled over the matter, and fear that I was not as\nfaithful as I should have been in bringing before you all I knew of\nyour case. Some things I withheld from you. While in Battle Creek\nin June, I was again shown that you were not making any advance,\nand that the reason you were not is that you have not made a clean\ntrack behind you. You do not enjoy religion. You have departed from\nGod and righteousness. You have been seeking happiness in the\nwrong way, in forbidden pleasures; and you have not moral courage\nto confess and forsake your sins that you may find mercy.\nYou did not view sin as heinous in the sight of God, and put it\naway; you failed to make thorough work; and when the enemy came\nin with his temptations, you did not resist him. Had you seen how\noffensive sin was in the sight of God, you would not have so readily\nyielded to temptation. You were not so thoroughly converted as to\nabhor your life of sin and folly. Sin yet seemed pleasant to you, and\nyou were loath to yield up its delusive pleasures. Your inmost soul\nwas not converted, and you soon lost that which you had gained.\nPersonal vanity in your case, as well as in that of many others,\nhas been a special hindrance to you. You have ever had a love of\npraise. This has been a snare to you. Your professed friends have\nshown a special pleasure in your society, and this has gratified you. [292]\nWeak-minded, sympathetic women have praised you and appeared\ncharmed with your society; and you have felt a fascinating power\nupon you in their company. You did not realize, while spending in\npleasure seeking those hours which belonged to your family, that\nSatan was weaving his net about your feet.\nSatan has temptations laid for every step of your life. You have\nnot been as economical of means as you should have been. You\n261\n262 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nhate stinginess. This is all right; but you go to the opposite extreme,\nand your course has been marked with prodigality. Christ taught\nHis disciples a lesson in feeding the five thousand. He wrought a\ngreat miracle and fed that vast multitude with five loaves and two\nsmall fishes. After all had been satisfied, He did not then regard the\nfragments indifferently, as if it were beneath His dignity to notice\nthem. He who had power to work so notable a miracle, and to give\nfood to so large a company, said to His disciples: \u201cGather up the\nfragments that remain, that nothing be lost.\u201d This is a lesson to us\nall, and one which we should not disregard.\nYou have a great work before you, and you cannot afford to\nwaste another moment without taking hold of it. Brother P, I am\nalarmed for you; but I know that God loves you still, although your\ncourse has been wayward. If He did not have a special love for you\nHe would not present your dangers before me as He has. You have\nengaged in jesting and sporting with men and women who have not\nthe fear of God before them. Weak-headed and unprincipled women\nhave retained you in their presence, and you were like a charmed\nbird. You seemed fascinated by these superficial persons. Angels of\nGod were upon your track and have faithfully recorded every wrong\nact, every instance of departure from virtue\u2019s path.\nYes, every act, however secret you may have thought you were in\nits committal, has been open to God, to Christ, and to the holy angels.[293]\nA book is written of all the doings of the children of men. Not an\nitem of this record can be concealed. There is only one provision\nmade for the transgressor. Faithful repentance and confession of sin,\nand faith in the cleansing blood of Christ, will bring forgiveness,\nand pardon will be written against his name.\nO my brother, had you made thorough work one year ago, the\npast precious year need not have been to you worse than a blank.\nYou knew your Master\u2019s will, but did it not. You are in a perilous\ncondition. Your sensibilities have been blunted to spiritual things;\nyou have a violated conscience. Your influence is not to gather, but\nto scatter. You have no special interest in religious exercises. You\nare not a happy man. Your wife would unite her interest with the\npeople of God if you would get out of her way. She needs your help.\nWill you take hold of this work together?\nTrue Conversion 263\nLast June I saw that your only hope of breaking the chain of your\nbondage was a removal from your associates. You had yielded to\nSatan\u2019s temptations until you were a weak man. You were a lover\nof pleasure more than a lover of God, and were fast traveling the\ndownward path. I have been disappointed that you have continued\nin the same indifferent state in which you have been for years. You\nhave known and experienced the love of God; and it has been your\ndelight to do His will. You have delighted in the study of the word of\nGod. You have been punctual at the prayer meetings. Your testimony\nhas been from a heart which felt the quickening influences of the\nlove of Christ. But you have lost your first love.\nGod now calls upon you to repent, to be zealous in the work.\nYour eternal happiness will be determined by the course you now\npursue. Can you reject the invitations of mercy now offered? Can\nyou choose your own way? Will you cherish pride and vanity, and\nlose your soul at last? The word of God plainly tells us that few [294]\nwill be saved, and that the greater number of those, even, who are\ncalled will prove themselves unworthy of everlasting life. They will\nhave no part in heaven, but will have their portion with Satan, and\nexperience the second death.\nMen and women may escape this doom if they will. It is true that\nSatan is the great originator of sin; yet this does not excuse any man\nfor sinning; for he cannot force men to do evil. He tempts them to\nit, and makes sin look enticing and pleasant; but he has to leave it to\ntheir own wills whether they will do it or not. He does not force men\nto become intoxicated, neither does he force them to remain away\nfrom religious meetings; but he presents temptations in a manner to\nallure to evil, and man is a free moral agent to accept or refuse.\nConversion is a work that most do not appreciate. It is not a\nsmall matter to transform an earthly, sin-loving mind and bring it\nto understand the unspeakable love of Christ, the charms of His\ngrace, and the excellency of God, so that the soul shall be imbued\nwith divine love and captivated with the heavenly mysteries. When\nhe understands these things, his former life appears disgusting and\nhateful. He hates sin, and, breaking his heart before God, he em-\nbraces Christ as the life and joy of the soul. He renounces his former\npleasures. He has a new mind, new affections, new interest, new\nwill; his sorrows, and desires, and love are all new. The lust of the\n264 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nflesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, which have heretofore\nbeen preferred before Christ, are now turned from, and Christ is the\ncharm of his life, the crown of his rejoicing. Heaven, which once\npossessed no charms, is now viewed in its riches and glory; and he\ncontemplates it as his future home, where he shall see, love, and\npraise the One who hath redeemed him by His precious blood.\nThe works of holiness, which appeared wearisome, are now his[295]\ndelight. The word of God, which was dull and uninteresting, is\nnow chosen as his study, the man of his counsel. It is as a letter\nwritten to him from God, bearing the inscription of the Eternal.\nHis thoughts, his words, and his deeds are brought to this rule and\ntested. He trembles at the commands and threatenings which it\ncontains, while he firmly grasps its promises and strengthens his\nsoul by appropriating them to himself. The society of the most godly\nis now chosen by him, and the wicked, whose company he once\nloved, he no longer delights in. He weeps over those sins in them at\nwhich he once laughed. Self-love and vanity are renounced, and he\nlives unto God, and is rich in good works. This is the sanctification\nwhich God requires. Nothing short of this will He accept.\nI beg of you, my brother, to search your heart diligently and\ninquire: \u201cWhat road am I traveling, and where will it end?\u201d You\nhave reason to rejoice that your life has not been cut off while you\nhave no certain hope of eternal life. God forbid that you should\nlonger neglect this work, and so perish in your sins. Do not flatter\nyour soul with false hopes. You see no way to get hold again but\none so humble that you cannot consent to accept it. Christ presents\nto you, even to you, my erring brother, a message of mercy: \u201cCome;\nfor all things are now ready.\u201d God is ready to accept you and to\npardon all your transgressions, if you will but come. Though you\nhave been a prodigal, and have separated from God and stayed away\nfrom Him so long, He will meet you even now. Yes; the Majesty of\nheaven invites you to come to Him, that you may have life. Christ is\nready to cleanse you from sin when you lay hold upon Him. What\nprofit have you found in serving sin? what profit in serving the flesh\nand the devil? Is it not poor wages you receive? Oh! turn ye, turn\nye; for why will ye die?\nYou have had many convictions, many pangs of conscience. You[296]\nhave had so many purposes and made so many promises, and yet you\nTrue Conversion 265\nlinger and will not come to Christ that you may have life. Oh, that\nyour heart may be impressed with a sense of this time, that you may\nnow turn and live! Cannot you hear the voice of the True Shepherd\nin this message? How can you disobey? Trifle not with God, lest\nHe leave you to your own crooked ways. It is life or death with you.\nWhich will you choose? It is a fearful thing to contend with God\nand resist His pleadings. You may have the love of God burning\nupon the altar of your heart as you once felt it. You may commune\nwith God as you have done in times past. If you will make a clean\ntrack behind you you may again experience the riches of His grace,\nand your countenance again express His love.\nIt is not required of you to confess to those who know not your\nsin and errors. It is not your duty to publish a confession which\nwill lead unbelievers to triumph; but to those to whom it is proper,\nwho will take no advantage of your wrong, confess according to the\nword of God, and let them pray for you, and God will accept your\nwork, and will heal you. For your soul\u2019s sake, be entreated to make\nthorough work for eternity. Lay aside your pride, your vanity, and\nmake straight work. Come back again to the fold. The Shepherd is\nwaiting to receive you. Repent, and do your first works, and again\ncome into favor with God.\n* * * * *\nChapter 42\u2014Duties of the Husband and the Wife\nBrother R,\nLast June your case was presented before me in vision. But I\nhave been so constantly pressed with labor that I could not possibly\nwrite out the things shown me in regard to individual cases. I wish\nto write what I have to write, before I hear any account of matters in[297]\nregard to your case; for Satan might suggest doubts to your mind.\nThis is his work.\nI was pointed back to your past life and was shown that God\nhad been very merciful to you in enlightening your eyes to see His\ntruth, in rescuing you from your perilous condition of doubt and\nuncertainty, and in establishing your faith and settling your mind\nupon the eternal truths of His word. He established your feet upon\nthe Rock. For a season you felt grateful and humble, but for some\ntime you have been separating yourself from God. When you were\nlittle in your own eyes, then you were beloved of God.\nMusic has been a snare to you. You are troubled with self-\nesteem; it is natural for you to have exalted ideas of your own ability.\nTeaching music has been an injury to you. Many women have\nconfided their family difficulties to you. This has also been an injury\nto you. It has exalted you and led you to still greater self-esteem.\nIn your own family you have occupied a dignified and rather\nhaughty position. There are defects in your wife, of which you are\naware. They have led to bad results. She is not naturally a house-\nkeeper. Her education in this direction must be acquired. She has\nimproved some, and should apply herself earnestly to make greater\nimprovement. She lacks order, taste, and neatness in housekeeping\nand also in dress. It would be pleasing to God if she should train\nher mind upon these things wherein she lacks. She does not have\ngood government in her family. She is too yielding, and fails to\nmaintain her decisions. She is swayed by the desires and claims of\nher children, and yields her judgment to theirs. Instead of trying\nto improve in these respects, as it is her duty to do, she is glad\n266\nDuties of the Husband and the Wife 267\nof an opportunity or an excuse to release herself from home cares\nand responsibilities, and permits others to perform the duties in her\nfamily that she should educate herself to love to do. She cannot [298]\nperform her part as a wife and mother until she shall educate herself\nin this direction. She lacks confidence in herself. She is timid and\nretiring, and distrustful of herself. She has a very poor opinion of\nwhat she does, and this discourages her from doing more. She needs\nencouragement; she needs words of tenderness and affection. She\nhas a good spirit. She is meek and quiet, and the Lord loves her; yet\nshe should make thorough efforts to correct these evils which tend\nto make her family unhappy. Practice in these things will give her\nconfidence in her own ability to perform her duties aright.\nYou and your wife are opposite in your organizations. You love\norder and neatness, and have a nice taste, and quite good government.\nAs a husband, you are rather stiff and stern. You fail to take a\ncourse to encourage confidence and familiarity in your wife. Her\ndeficiencies have led you to regard her as inferior to yourself, and\nhave also caused her to feel that you thus regard her. God esteems\nher more highly than yourself; for your ways are crooked before\nHim. For the sake of her husband and children, and for other reasons,\nshe should seek to correct her deficiencies and to improve in those\nthings wherein she now fails. She can do it if she will try hard\nenough.\nGod is displeased with disorder, slackness, and a lack of thor-\noughness, in anyone. These deficiencies are serious evils and tend to\nwean the affections of the husband from the wife when the husband\nloves order, well-disciplined children, and a well-regulated house.\nA wife and mother cannot make home agreeable and happy unless\nshe possesses a love for order, preserves her dignity, and has good\ngovernment; therefore all who fail on these points should begin at\nonce to educate themselves in this direction and cultivate the very\nthings wherein is their greatest lack. Discipline will do much for [299]\nthose who are lacking in these essential qualifications. Sister R gives\nup to these failings, and thinks that she cannot do otherwise than she\ndoes. After she has made a trial, and fails to see decided improve-\nment in herself, she is discouraged. This must not be. The happiness\nof herself and her family depend upon her arousing herself, and\nworking with earnestness and zeal to make a decided reformation in\n268 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthese things. She must put on confidence and decision; put on the\nwoman. Her nature is to shrink from anything untried. No one can\nbe more ready and willing than she to do, where she thinks she can\nsucceed. If she fails in her new effort, she must try, try again. She\ncan earn the respect of her husband and children.\nI was shown that self-exaltation has caused Brother R to stumble.\nHe has exercised a certain dignity, savoring of severity, in his family\nand toward his wife. This has shut her from him. She felt that she\ncould not approach him, and has been in her married life, more like\na child fearing a stern, dignified father, than like a wife. She has\nloved, respected, and idolized her husband notwithstanding his lack\nof encouraging her confidence. My brother, you should pursue a\ncourse that would encourage your timid, shrinking wife to lean upon\nyour large affections, and this would give you a chance, in a delicate,\naffectionate manner, to correct the errors existing in her, as far as\nyou are capable of so doing, and to inspire her with confidence in\nherself.\nI was shown that you had not possessed that love for your wife\nthat you should. Satan has taken advantage of her defects and your\nerrors, to work for the destruction of your family. You have suffered\nshame of your wife to come into your heart, and your respect has\ngrown less and less for her whom you vowed to love and cherish\nuntil death should part you.\nDanger of Confiding Family Troubles[300]\nOctober 25, 1868, your case was again presented before me.\nI was shown that evil thoughts and unlawful desires have led to\nimproper acts and to a violation of the commandments of God. You\nhave dishonored yourself, your wife, and the cause of God. You\ncould have exerted an influence for good in the cause of God. But\nthe pursuance of a wrong course in matters that you thought were of\nlittle consequence has led to greater evils.\nBrother R, you are now in danger of making total shipwreck of\nyour faith. You have sinned greatly. But your sin in seeking to cover\nup, and blind the eyes of those who have suspected you of wrong,\nhas been tenfold greater. All have not acted as prudently and with\nas much love and care as the Lord would have been pleased to have\nDuties of the Husband and the Wife 269\nthem, in order to redeem you. But when you tried to put on an air of\ninjured innocence, did you think that God could not see your wrong\ncourse? Did you think that He who made man out of the dust of the\nground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, could not\ndiscern the intents and purposes of the heart? You have thought that\nif you should confess your sin you would lose your honor\u2014your life,\nas it were. You thought that your brethren would have no confidence\nin you. You have not viewed matters in the right light. It is a shame\nto sin, but always an honor to confess sin.\nAngels of God have kept a faithful record of every act, however\nsecret you may have thought you were in its committal. God discerns\nthe purposes of man and all his works. Every man will be rewarded\naccording as his works have been, whether good or evil. That which\na man sows will he also reap. There will be no failure in the crop.\nThe harvest is sure and plentiful. You have tried to blind your [301]\nbrethren in regard to your course. How could you do so, when you\nknew that you were guilty in the sight of God? If you value your\nsoul\u2019s salvation, make thorough work for eternity.\nYou will have to make a clean track behind you by thorough\nconfession. You need a thorough conversion\u2014a transformation\nof self by the renewing of your mind. Your self-esteem must be\novercome. You must learn to esteem others better than yourself.\nYour exalted opinion of your own acquirements must be given up,\nand you must obtain a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of\nGod of great price.\nYou have possessed a spirit which has led you from the path\nof rectitude, and now you are troubled. Doubts, and fears, and\ndespair seize you. There is but one way out, and that is by the way\nof confession. Your only hope is in falling on the Rock and being\nbroken to pieces; if you do not, it will surely fall upon you and grind\nyou to powder. You can now right your wrongs; you can now redeem\nthe past. By a life of goodness and true humility you can yet walk\nwith acceptance before God in your family. May the Lord help you,\nin view of the judgment, to work as for your life. Dear brother, I feel\ndeeply interested for you. You have been walking in darkness for\nsome time. You have not arrived at your present state of darkness all\nat once. You have been leaving the light gradually. You first became\n270 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nexalted, and then, as you felt sufficient in your own strength, the\nLord removed His strength from you.\nYou have been interested in music. This has given incautious,\nunwise women opportunity, and they have confided their troubles to\nyou. This has gratified your pride, but it has been a snare to you. It\nhas opened a door for the suggestions of Satan. You have not done\nas you should. You had no right to hear in families that which has\nbeen spoken to you. These communications have corrupted your[302]\nmind, increased your self-esteem, and led to evil thoughts. You have\npermitted yourself to be a confessor to some sentimental women\nwho desired sympathy and wished to lean upon others. Had they\npossessed sound judgment and stood self-reliant, having an aim\nin life, loving to do others good, they would not have been in a\ncondition where they needed to come to anyone for sympathy.\nYou know not the deceptions of the human heart. You know not\nthe devices of Satan. Some who have drawn largely upon your sym-\npathy have a sickly, diseased imagination, are lovesick, sentimental,\never eager to create a sensation and make a great ado. Some are\ndissatisfied with their married life. There is not enough romance in it.\nNovel reading has perverted all the good sense they ever had. They\nlive in an imaginary world. Their imagination creates a husband for\nthemselves such as exists only in romances found in novels. They\ntalk of unrequited love. They are never contented or happy, because\ntheir imagination pictures to them a life that is unreal. When they\nface the reality, come down to the simplicity of real life, and take up\nlife\u2019s burdens in their families, as is woman\u2019s lot, then they will find\ncontentment and happiness.\nYou have cherished thoughts that were not right. These thoughts\nhave borne fruit. \u201cOut of the abundance of the heart the mouth\nspeaketh.\u201d Your words are not always chaste, pure, and elevated.\n\u201cLet no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.\u201d Guile is\ntoo often found in your mouth\u2014low expressions that proceed from\na heart cherishing corrupt thoughts and evil desires.\nFor some time your feet have been turned from the path of rec-\ntitude and purity. You know that your course has been displeasing\nto God, that you are transgressing His holy law; you know that[303]\nthese things cannot be hid. God will not permit His people to be\ndeceived in your case. Your great sin is in enlisting the sympathies\nDuties of the Husband and the Wife 271\nof those who do not understand your crooked course, and by thus\ndoing dividing the judgment of the people who profess the truth.\nWe pity you. My heart aches for you. I see nothing before you but\nperdition, nothing but utter shipwreck of faith.\nWill you cover your sins and brave the matter out? God says\nyou shall not prosper. But he that confesseth and forsaketh his sins\nshall find mercy. Will you choose death? Will you shut the kingdom\nof heaven against yourself because you will not yield your wicked\npride? Your only hope is in confessing your backslidings. God has\nlet light shine upon your pathway. Will you choose your own course\nof corruption? Will you cast the truth behind you because it will not\nsustain you in a course of iniquity? Oh, be entreated to \u201crend your\nheart, and not your garments.\u201d Make thorough work for eternity.\nGod will be merciful to you. He will be entreated in your behalf. He\nwill not despise a broken and contrite spirit. Will you turn? Will you\nlive? Your soul is worth saving; it is precious. We wish to help you.\nI saw that you are not happy. You are not at rest. You feel\ndistressed, and yet you refuse to take the only course that will bring\nyou relief and hope. He that confesseth and forsaketh his sins shall\nfind mercy. Your condition is deplorable, and you are greatly injuring\nthe cause of God. Your influence will destroy others besides yourself.\nIf you refuse to come to God and confess your backslidings that\nHe may heal you, there is nothing to be hoped for you or your poor\nfamily in the future. Misery will follow upon the steps of sin. God\u2019s\nhand will be against you, and He will leave you to be controlled\nby Satan, to be led captive by him at his will. You know not to\nwhat lengths you may go. You will be like a man at sea without an [304]\nanchor. The truth of God is an anchor. You are breaking away from\nthat anchor. Your eternal interests are being sacrificed to the lust\nof the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. You are on\nthe point of breaking the bonds which would save you from utter\ndestruction. In seeking to save your life by concealing your wrongs,\nyou are losing it. If you now humble yourself before God, confess\nyour wrongs, and return to Him with full purpose of heart, yours can\nyet be a happy family. If you will not do this, but choose your own\nway, your happiness is at an end.\nYou have a great work to do. You have been too slack in your\ndeportment. Your words have not been elevated, chaste, and pure.\n272 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nYou have been separating from the divine, and cultivating the baser\npassions. The intellectual and noble powers of your mind have been\nbrought into subjection to the animal passions. You have not pursued\na right course for some time. You have not abstained from every\nappearance of evil. It is not safe for you to pursue this course any\nlonger.\nYou have not loved your wife as you should. She is a good\nwoman. She has seen, in a small measure, your danger. But you\nhave closed your ears to her cautions. You have thought her jealous,\nbut this is not her nature. She loves you, and will bear with you,\nand forgive and love you, notwithstanding the deep wrong you have\ndone her, if you will only press to the light and make clean work\nof the past. You must have a thorough conversion. Unless you do,\nall your past efforts to obey the truth will not save you nor cover\nup your past wrongs. Jesus requires of you a thorough reformation;\nthen He will help, and bless, and love you, and blot out your sins\nwith His own most precious blood. You can redeem the past. You\ncan correct your ways and yet be an honor to the cause of God. You\ncan do good when you take hold of the strength of God and in His[305]\nname work\u2014work for your own salvation and for the good of others.\nYours can yet be a happy family. Your wife needs your help.\nShe is like a clinging vine; she wants to lean upon your strength.\nYou can help her and lead her along. You should never censure her.\nNever reprove her if her efforts are not what you think they should\nbe. Rather encourage her by words of tenderness and love. You\ncan help your wife to preserve her dignity and self-respect. Never\npraise the work or acts of others before her to make her feel her\ndeficiencies. You have been harsh and unfeeling in this respect. You\nhave shown greater courtesy to your hired help than to her and have\nplaced them ahead of her in the house.\nGod loves your wife. She has suffered, but He has noticed\nall, marked all, and will not hold you guiltless for the wounds you\nhave caused. It is neither wealth nor intellect that gives happiness.\nIt is moral worth. True goodness is accounted of Heaven as true\ngreatness. The condition of the moral affections determines the\nworth of the man. A person may have property and intellect, and\nyet be valueless, because the glowing fire of goodness has never\nburned upon the altar of his heart, because his conscience has been\nDuties of the Husband and the Wife 273\nseared, blackened, and crisped with selfishness and sin. When the\nlust of the flesh controls the man, and the evil passions of the carnal\nnature are permitted to rule, skepticism in regard to the realities of\nthe Christian religion is encouraged, and doubts are expressed as\nthough it were a special virtue to doubt.\nThe life of Solomon might have been remarkable until its close\nif virtue had been preserved. But he surrendered this special grace\nto lustful passion. In his youth he looked to God for guidance\nand trusted in Him, and God chose for him and gave him wisdom\nthat astonished the world. His power and wisdom were extolled [306]\nthroughout the land. But his love of women was his sin. This\npassion he did not control in his manhood, and it proved a snare\nto him. His wives led him into idolatry, and when he began to\ndescend the declivity of life, the wisdom that God had given him\nwas removed; he lost his firmness of character and became more like\nthe giddy youth, wavering between right and wrong. Yielding his\nprinciples, he placed himself in the current of evil, and thus separated\nhimself from God, the foundation and source of his strength. He had\nmoved from principle. Wisdom had been more precious to him than\nthe gold of Ophir. But, alas! lustful passions gained the victory. He\nwas deceived and ruined by women. What a lesson for watchfulness!\nWhat a testimony to the need of strength from God to the very last!\nIn the battle with inward corruptions and outward temptations,\neven the wise and powerful Solomon was vanquished. It is not safe\nto permit the least departure from the strictest integrity. \u201cAbstain\nfrom all appearance of evil.\u201d When a woman relates her family\ntroubles, or complains of her husband, to another man, she violates\nher marriage vows; she dishonors her husband and breaks down\nthe wall erected to preserve the sanctity of the marriage relation;\nshe throws wide open the door and invites Satan to enter with his\ninsidious temptations. This is just as Satan would have it. If a\nwoman comes to a Christian brother with a tale of her woes, her\ndisappointments and trials, he should ever advise her, if she must\nconfide her troubles to someone, to select sisters for her confidants,\nand then there will be no appearance of evil whereby the cause of\nGod may suffer reproach.\nRemember Solomon. Among many nations there was no king\nlike him, beloved of his God. But he fell. He was led from God and\n274 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nbecame corrupt through the indulgence of lustful passions. This is\nthe prevailing sin of this age, and its progress is fearful. Professed[307]\nSabbathkeepers are not clean. There are those who profess to believe\nthe truth who are corrupt at heart. God will prove them, and their\nfolly and sin shall be made manifest. None but the pure and lowly\ncan dwell in His presence. \u201cWho shall ascend into the hill of the\nLord? or who shall stand in His holy place? He that hath clean\nhands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity,\nnor sworn deceitfully.\u201d \u201cLord, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle?\nwho shall dwell in Thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and\nworketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. He that\nbackbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor\ntaketh up a reproach against his neighbor. In whose eyes a vile\nperson is contemned; but he honoreth them that fear the Lord. He\nthat sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. He that putteth not\nout his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He\nthat doeth these things shall never be moved.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 43\u2014Letter to an Orphan Boy\nDear Friend,\nIn the last vision given me, I saw that you had faults to correct.\nIt is necessary for you to see these before you will make the required\neffort to correct them. You have much to learn before you can form\na good, Christian character which God can approve. From your\nchildhood you have been a wayward boy, disposed to have your own\nway and to follow your own mind. You have not loved to yield your\nwishes and will to those who have had the care of you. This is the\nexperience you must obtain.\nYour danger is increased by the spirit of independence and self-\nconfidence\u2014connected, as of course it must be, with inexperience\u2014\nwhich young men of your age are apt to assume when they have not [308]\ntheir own dear parents to watch over them and stir the tender chords\nof affection in the soul. You feel that it is time for you to think and\nact for yourself. \u201cI am a young man, and no longer a child. I am\ncapable of discriminating between right and wrong. I have rights,\nand I will stand for them. I am capable of forming my own plans of\naction. Who has authority to interfere with me?\u201d These have been\nsome of your thoughts, and you are encouraged in them by youth\nwho are about your age.\nYou feel that you may assert your liberty and act like a man.\nThese feelings and thoughts lead to wrong action. You have not\na submissive spirit. Wise is that young man and highly blest who\nfeels it to be his duty, if he has parents, to look up to them, and\nif he has not, who regards his guardian, or those with whom he\nlives, as counselors, as comforters, and in some respects as his\nrulers, and who allows the restraints of his home to abide upon him.\nIndependence of one kind is praiseworthy. To desire to bear your\nown weight, and not to eat the bread of dependence, is right. It is a\nnoble, generous ambition that dictates the wish to be self-supporting.\nIndustrious habits and frugality are necessary.\n275\n276 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nYou have been placed in unfavorable circumstances for the de-\nvelopment of a good Christian character; but you are now placed\nwhere you may build up a reputation, or blast it. The latter we do\nnot believe you will do. But you are not secure from temptation. In\none single hour you may take a course which will afterward cost\nyou bitter tears of repentance. By yielding to temptation, you may\nestrange hearts from you, lose the respect and esteem you have been\nacquiring from those around you, and also stain your Christian char-\nacter. You have the lesson of submission to learn. You consider it\nbeneath you to do duties about the house\u2014chores and little errands.\nYou have a positive dislike for these little requirements; but you[309]\nshould cultivate a love for these very things to which you are so\naverse. Until you do this, you will not be acceptable help anywhere.\nWhen engaged in these necessary small things, you are doing more\nreal service than when engaged in large business and in laborious\nwork.\nI have a case now in mind of one who was presented before me\nin vision who neglected these little things and could not interest\nhimself in small duties, seeking to lighten the work of those indoors;\nit was too small business. He now has a family, but he still possesses\nthe same unwillingness to engage in these small yet important du-\nties. The result is, great care rests upon his wife. She has to do\nmany things, or they will be left undone; and the amount of care\nwhich comes upon her because of her husband\u2019s lack is breaking her\nconstitution. He cannot now overcome this evil as easily as he could\nin his youth. He neglects the little duties and fails to keep everything\nup tidy and nice, therefore cannot make a successful farmer. \u201cHe\nthat is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he\nthat is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\u201d\nNaaman the Syrian consulted the prophet of God as to how\nhe could be cured of a loathsome disease, the leprosy. He was\nbidden to go and bathe in Jordan seven times. Why did he not\nimmediately follow the directions of Elisha, the prophet of God?\nWhy did he refuse to do as the prophet commanded? He went to\nhis servants, murmuring. In his mortification and disappointment\nhe became passionate, and in a rage refused to follow the humble\ncourse marked out by the prophet of God. \u201cI thought,\u201d said he, \u201che\nwill surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the\nLetter to an Orphan Boy 277\nLord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the\nleper. Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than\nall the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So [310]\nhe turned and went away in a rage.\u201d His servant said: \u201cMy father,\nif the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not\nhave done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash\n[merely], and be clean?\u201d Yes, this great man considered it beneath\nhis dignity to go to the humble river Jordan, and wash. The rivers\nhe mentioned and desired were beautified by surrounding trees and\ngroves, and idols were placed in these groves. Many flocked to these\nrivers to worship their idol gods; therefore it would have cost him no\nhumility. But it was following the specified directions of the prophet\nwhich would humble his proud and lofty spirit. Willing obedience\nwould bring the desired result. He washed, and was made whole.\nYour case is similar in some respects to Naaman\u2019s. You do\nnot consider that in order to perfect a Christian character you must\ncondescend to be faithful in the littles. Although the things you are\ncalled to do may be of small account in your eyes, yet they are duties\nwhich you will have to do just as long as you live. A neglect of these\nthings will make a great deficiency in your character. You, my dear\nboy, should educate yourself to faithfulness in small things. You\ncannot please God unless you do this. You cannot gain love and\naffection unless you do just as you are bidden, with willingness and\npleasure. If you wish those with whom you live to love you, you\nmust show love and respect for them.\nIt is your duty to do all in your power to lighten the cares of the\nsister with whom you live. You see her, pale and feeble, cooking for\na large family. Every extra job she has to perform wears upon her\nand lessens her vitality. She has no young hands and feet to perform\nlittle errands. They received you into their family, as they told you\nand us at the time, expressly to do these things. Now if you neglect\nto do the very things they think will help them most, and choose to\nfollow your will in an independent course of your own choosing, [311]\nyou must lose your place, and they must have one that will do the\nvery things you consider too small for you to do. You are now doing\nlarger and heavier work than your strength will admit. You love to\ndo the work of a man. You have a set will of your own which must\nbe given up. You must die to self, crucify self, gain the victory over\n278 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nself. You cannot be a true follower of Christ unless you take hold of\nthis work resolutely.\nI saw that you do not naturally possess reverence and respect\nfor those older than yourself. You should be faithful in the little\nerrands and duties you are required to perform, and not go mur-\nmuringly about them as though they were a drug. You cannot see\nhow unpleasant and unlovely you make yourself. You cannot thus\nbe happy yourself, nor make those around you happy. You should\nbear in mind that God requires of you, as His servant, to be faithful,\npatient, kind, affectionate, obedient, and respectful. You cannot\nattain to Christian perfection unless you possess perfect control of\nyour own spirit. You allow feelings to arise in your heart which are\nsinful, which are a great injury to you, and which tend to encourage\na hard, defiant spirit, unlike the spirit of Christ, whose life you are\ncommanded to imitate.\nMy dear boy, commence anew, determined by God\u2019s help to\nfollow the things which are true, lovely, and of good report. Let\nthe fear of God, united with love and affection for all around you,\nbe seen in all your actions. Be faithful and thorough; rid yourself\nof everything like slackness. Have a place for everything, and put\neverything in its place. Be accommodating, kind, cheerful, and\nagreeable. Then you can win your way into the hearts of those with\nwhom you associate. One thing ever bear in mind: No young man\ncan be possessed of a right spirit who does not respect women and\nseek to lighten their cares. It is the worst sign that can be found in a[312]\nyoung man to consider it beneath him to lighten the labor of women.\nSuch a man is marked. No woman would commit the keeping of\nher life to such a man; for he will never make a tender, careful,\nconsiderate husband.\nThe boy is the type of the man. I entreat of you to face rightabout.\nDo everything that needs to be done in the shape of small duties,\ndisagreeable though they may be. Then you will have the approval\nof those around you, and, what is to be more highly prized, you will\nhave the approval of God. You cannot be a Christian unless you are\na faithful servant in that which is least. If you pray, and strive to do\nyour best to perform every duty, God will bless and help you. When\nJesus comes to take His faithful ones to Himself, do you wish to have\nHim say to you: \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant\u201d? Do\nLetter to an Orphan Boy 279\nyou desire to have all imperfections removed from your character,\nthat you may be found without fault before the throne of God? If so,\nyou have a work to do for yourself which no one else can do for you.\nYou have an individual responsibility before God. You can walk in\nthe light, and daily receive strength from God to overcome every\nimperfection, and finally be among the faithful, true, and holy in the\nkingdom of God. Yield not to temptation. Satan will annoy you and\nseek to control your mind, that he may lead you into sin. \u201cResist\nthe devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and He will\ndraw nigh to you.\u201d\nRemember that the eye of God is ever upon you. When you\nanswer disrespectfully, God sees and hears you. The time is coming\nwhen all shall be judged according to the deeds done in the body.\nYou will have a part to act in the judgment. Jesus will either receive\nor reject you. Flee to Him for strength and grace. He desires to help\nyou, to be the guide of your youth, and to so strengthen you that\nyou can bless others with your influence. God loves you and will [313]\nsave you if you come in His appointed way; but if you rebel and\nchoose your own course, it will be to your eternal loss. Pray much,\nfor prayer is one of the most essential duties. Without it you cannot\nmaintain a Christian walk. It elevates, strengthens, and ennobles; it\nis the soul talking with God.\nDo not think you can cease your efforts or vigilance for a mo-\nment; you cannot. Study God\u2019s word diligently, that you may not\nbe ignorant of Satan\u2019s devices, and that you may learn the way of\nsalvation more perfectly. Your will must be submerged in God\u2019s\nwill. Seek not your own pleasure, but that of those around you; and\nin so doing you cannot but be happy. Come to Jesus with all your\nneeds and wants, and in simple confidence crave His blessing. Trust\nin God, and seek to move from principle, strengthened and ennobled\nby high resolves and a determination of purpose found only in God.\nYou should not be easily provoked. Let not your heart become\nselfish, but let it expand with love. You have a work to do which\nyou must not neglect. Endure hardship as a good soldier. Jesus is\nacquainted with every conflict, every trial, and every pang of anguish.\nHe will help you; for He was tempted in all points like as we are, yet\nHe sinned not. Go to Him, dear boy, with your burdens. Take no one\ninto your confidence, and tell no one your difficulties, but us. Make\n280 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nJesus your Burden Bearer, and seek a more thorough experience in\nreligious things. God help and bless you, is my sincere prayer.\nMy tenderest sympathies are aroused for orphans. You indeed\nhave no home. The grave has taken your father and your mother,\nand the home of your childhood others inhabit. You cannot have as\ndistinct recollections of your godly father as of your mother. You\nremember that you sometimes grieved her. You had not learned\nsubmission; you have yet but partially learned the lesson. But the[314]\nprayers of your parents, that you may be among those who love and\nfear God, have found a lodgment in heaven.\nOh, this is a cold and selfish world! Your relatives, who should\nhave loved and befriended you for your parents\u2019 sake if not for your\nown, have shut themselves up in their selfishness, and have no special\ninterest for you. But God will be nearer and dearer to you than any\nof your earthly relatives can be. He will be your friend and will never\nleave you. He is a father to the fatherless. His friendship will prove\nsweet peace to you and will help you to bear your great loss with\nfortitude. Seek to make God your father, and you will never want\na friend. You will be exposed to trials; yet be steadfast, and strive\nto adorn your profession. You will need grace to stand, but God\u2019s\npitying eye is upon you. Pray much and earnestly, believing that God\nwill help you. Guard against irritability and petulance, and a spirit\nof tantalizing. Forbearance is a virtue which you need to encourage.\nSeek for piety of heart. Be a consistent Christian. Possess a love of\npurity and humble simplicity, and let these be interwoven with your\nlife.\nBy educating yourself to fear God, and to love all around you,\nyours can be a useful, happy life, and your example can be such as\nto lead others to choose the humble path of holiness. Have moral\ncourage at all times to do right and to honor your Redeemer. I\nimplore you, dear boy, to seek true holiness.\n* * * * *\nChapter 44\u2014The Unruly Member\nDear Sister S,\nSome things have been shown me in reference to you. You have\nnot a sense of your true state. You need a deep and thorough work\nof grace in your heart. You need to set your heart and your house in\norder. Your example in your family is not worthy of imitation. You [315]\ncome up to a low standard, but fail to reach the standard elevated\nby our divine Lord. You love to visit and talk, and you say many\nthings unbecoming a Christian. Your statements are exaggerated\nand frequently come far from the truth. Your words and acts will\njudge you in the last day. By them you will be justified or by them\ncondemned. Your education has not been of an ennobling character,\ntherefore there is the greatest necessity of your now training and ed-\nucating yourself to purity of thought and action. Train your thoughts\nso that it will be easy for them to dwell upon pure and holy things.\nCultivate a love for spirituality and true godliness.\nYour conversation is often of a low order. You are deceiving\nyour own soul, and this delusion will prove fatal unless you arouse\nto see yourself as you are and turn unto God with true humbleness\nof mind. You are inclined to be deceptive. Your son has not an\nexperimental knowledge of God or of the sacred claims of truth. He\nis flattered by his parents that he is a Christian, but he is a most\nmiserable representative of Sabbathkeeping Christians. God forbid\nthat we acknowledge such as being Christlike. You do not discipline\nyour boy. He is self-willed and bigoted. He has but very little\nsense of true courtesy or even common politeness. He is rough and\nuncultivated, unloving and unlovable. You represent to others that\nhe is a Christian, and by so doing you disgrace the cause of Christ.\nThis boy is in a fair way of becoming an educated hypocrite. He has\nno control over himself, yet you flatter him that he is a Christian.\nThe work of reform must commence with you. You should be-\ncome chaste in conversation, and a keeper at home, loving home\nduties, loving your husband and child. You should study to econo-\n281\n282 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nmize your time so as not to overtax your strength. The light burden\nof home duties which you have to perform you can bear without[316]\novertaxation if you exercise perseverance and proper diligence. But\nyou have a work to do to control the tongue. It is a little member and\nboasteth great things, but it needs the bridle of grace and the bit of\nself-control to keep it from running at random. Your conversation is\nof a low order, and you indulge in much cheap talk. \u201cLet no corrupt\ncommunication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good\nto the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.\u201d\nMay the Lord convict you of these things as you read these\nlines. I entreat of you to put on the meek dignity of a wife and\nmother. There is a responsibility resting upon the father. Your\nefforts should be united to control your son, who is fast traveling the\nroad to perdition. You should earnestly seek for the inward adorning,\neven the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight\nof God of great price. With patience, grace, and sweet humility you\ncan teach your poor, deceived boy the first principles of Christianity,\nand true politeness, or Christian courtesy. You are frequently hasty\nand boisterous. Oh, how important that you see the work to be done\nfor you, before it shall be forever too late! Now Jesus invites you\nto come to Him, and to learn of Him, for He is meek and lowly of\nheart. The promise He has given you is sure, that you will find rest\nin Him. You have a great work to do. Deceive not your own souls,\nbut examine yourselves as in the light of eternity. It is impossible\nfor you to be saved as you are.\nSister S, your husband might be of some use in the church if your\ninfluence were what it ought to be. But your example and influence\ndisqualify him to exert a sanctifying influence in the church. Home\ninfluences more than counteract his efforts for good. You are wholly\nunqualified to be the wife of an elder of the church. God calls upon\nyou to reform. Your husband has a work to do to set his heart and[317]\nhouse in order. When he is converted, then can he strengthen his\nbrethren.\nAs a family, you need to be sanctified through the truth. Dear\nsister, will you see the work to be done for you and take hold of it\nwithout delay, that your influence may be saving? Work out your\nsalvation with fear and trembling. Walk in wisdom toward them\nthat are without, redeeming the time. \u201cLet your speech be alway\nUnruly Member 283\nwith grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to\nanswer every man.\u201d \u201cWhatsoever things are true, whatsoever things\nare honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,\nwhatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if\nthere be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.\u201d\nThere are enough profitable subjects upon which to meditate and\nconverse. The conversation of the Christian should be in heaven,\nwhence we look for the Saviour. Meditation upon heavenly things is\nprofitable, and will ever be accompanied with the peace and comfort\nof the Holy Spirit. Our calling is holy, our profession exalted. God is\npurifying unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. He\nis sitting as a refiner and purifier of silver. When the dross and tin are\nremoved, then His image will be perfectly reflected in us. Then the\nprayer of Christ for His disciples will be answered in us: \u201cSanctify\nthem through Thy truth: Thy word is truth.\u201d When the truth has a\nsanctifying influence upon our hearts and lives, we can render to\nGod acceptable service and can glorify Him upon the earth, being\npartakers of the divine nature and having escaped the corruption that\nis in the world through lust.\nOh, how many will be found unready when the Master shall\ncome to reckon with His servants! Many have meager ideas of what\nconstitutes a Christian. Self-righteousness will then be of no avail. [318]\nOnly those can stand the test who shall be found having on the\nrighteousness of Christ, who are imbued with His spirit, and walk\neven as He walked, in purity of heart and life. The conversation\nmust be holy, and then the words will be seasoned with grace.\nMay the Lord help you as a family to get right, to be elevated in\nlife, and in all your acts to honor your profession.\n* * * * *\nChapter 45\u2014Comfort in Affliction\nDear Sister T,\nI have learned of your affliction, and hasten to pen a few lines.\nMy dear sister, I have the very best of evidence that the Lord loves\nyou. In the last view given me, I was shown your case among others.\nI saw that you had been affected in the past with the course of error\nwhich others had pursued; but while strictly conscientious, and ever\nanxious to know the right, you were extremely sensitive and viewed\nyour case as worse than it was.\nYou have been afflicted with disease for quite a length of time.\nYou are a nervous dyspeptic. The brain is closely connected with the\nstomach, and its power has so often been called to aid the weakened\ndigestive organs that it is in its turn weakened, depressed, congested.\nWhile in this state, your mind is gloomy, naturally dwelling upon the\ndark side, imagining that the frown of God is upon you. You have\nthought that your life has been useless, that it has been filled with\nerrors and wrong moves. Dear sister, your diseased state of health\nleads you to this despondency and discouragement. God has not left\nyou; His love is yet toward you. I saw that you should trust in Him\nas a child trusts itself in the arms of its mother. God is merciful and\nkind, and full of tender pity and compassion. He has not turned His\nface from you.\nYou are extremely sensitive. You feel deeply and have not pos-[319]\nsessed the power to throw off care, perplexity, and discouragement\nof mind. I saw that God would be to you a very present help if you\nwould only trust yourself with Him; but you worry yourself out of\nthe arms of your dear, loving Saviour. \u201cHe that spared not His own\nSon, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him\nalso freely give us all things?\u201d What a precious promise is this! We\nmay claim much of our kind heavenly Father. Great blessings are in\nreserve for us. We may believe in God, we may trust Him, and by\nso doing glorify His name. Even if we are overcome of the enemy,\nwe are not cast off, not forsaken and rejected of God. No; Christ is\n284\nComfort in Affliction 285\nat the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. \u201cIf\nany man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the\nrighteous.\u201d\nI want to say, my sister, you need not cast away your confidence.\nPoor, trembling soul, rest in the promises of God. In so doing, the\nenemy\u2019s fetters will be broken, his suggestions will be powerless.\nHeed not the whisperings of the enemy. Go free, oppressed soul.\nBe of good courage. Say to your poor, desponding heart: \u201cHope\nthou in God: for I shall yet praise Him, who is the health of my\ncountenance, and my God.\u201d I know that God loves you. Put your\ntrust in Him. Think not of those things which bring sadness and\ndistress; turn from every disagreeable thought and think of precious\nJesus. Dwell upon His power to save, His undying, matchless love\nfor you, even you. I know that the Lord loves you. If you cannot\nrely upon your own faith, rely upon the faith of others. We believe\nand hope for you. God accepts our faith in your behalf.\nYou have tried to do right, and God is pitiful and compassionate\nto you. Be cheerful, and bid adieu to gloom and doubts. In indulging\nthese doubts, you dishonor God. There is peace in believing, and\njoy in the Holy Ghost. Believing brings peace, and trusting in God [320]\nbrings joy. Believe, believe! my soul says, believe. Rest in God.\nHe is able to keep that which you have committed to His trust. He\nwill bring you off more than conqueror through Him who hath loved\nyou. May the Lord bless you and strengthen your trembling faith, is\nour prayer. We commit these few lines to you, trusting they may do\nyou good.\n* * * * *\nChapter 46\u2014A Self-Caring, Dictatorial Spirit\nDear Brother U,\nI was shown in the last vision that you would need to watch\nyourself with jealous care, or your peculiar temperament would\ncontrol you. You erred while engaged in praying for Sister V , and\ntook upon yourself the same dictatorial, overbearing spirit which\nhas been the curse of your life. You bore down on Brother W\nwhen, considering your failures in the past, you should have been\nunassuming and modest. It will be very difficult for you to overcome\nthe habit of watching others, and noticing little things, and speaking\nout in a decided, censuring manner. All this you have nothing to\ndo with. Just as sure as you are overcome in a small degree in this\ndirection, the door is open for a greater failure. There is no safety for\nyou but in constantly controlling yourself and possessing your soul\nin patience. You cannot accomplish any great work, but, if right,\nmay do a little good in the cause of God. But your influence need\nnot injure; if you are guarded and sanctified to God, you may be\nable to speak a peaceful word of comfort and to bear testimony to\nthe great riches of God and the undying love of Jesus.\nLet your heart be softened and melted under the divine influence\nof the Spirit of God. You should not talk so much about yourself,\nfor this will strengthen no one. You should not make yourself a[321]\ncenter, and imagine that you must be constantly caring for yourself\nand leading others to care for you. Get your mind off from yourself\ninto a more healthy channel. Talk of Jesus, and let self go; let it be\nsubmerged in Christ, and let this be the language of your heart: \u201cI\nlive; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.\u201d Jesus will be to you a present\nhelp in every time of need. He will not leave you to battle with the\npowers of darkness alone. Oh, no; He has laid help upon One that is\nmighty to save to the uttermost.\nBe not self-caring. Overcome your notions, your little peculiar-\nities, and seek only to represent Jesus. When talking or praying\nin meeting, do not be too lengthy. You have failed here. You can\n286\nSelf-Caring, Dictatorial Spirit 287\nremedy this. Lengthy speaking and praying is injurious to yourself\nand is no benefit to those who hear. You will have close work to be\nan overcomer. Yet you can do it if you engage in the work calmly.\nHere you need to guard yourself. You are uneasy, hurried, nervous.\nThis you may also overcome.\nYou have an earnest, anxious desire to do right and meet the\napproval of God. Continue your earnest, persevering efforts, and be\nnot discouraged. Be patient. Never censure. Never let the enemy\nbeguile you from your watch. Watch as well as pray. After you pray,\nwatch thereunto. The effort is your own; no one can do this work for\nyou. Take hold of the strength of God, and as fast as you see your\nerrors in the past, redeem the time.\n* * * * *\nChapter 47\u2014A Forgetful Hearer\nDear Brother Y,\nIn the last view given I was shown that you do not understand\nyourself. You have a work to do for yourself which no one can do\nfor you. Your experience in the truth is short, and you have not been[322]\nthoroughly converted. You place a higher estimate upon yourself\nthan you will bear. I was pointed back to your past life. Your mind\nhas not been elevated, but has dwelt upon subjects not calculated to\nlead to purity of action. You have had habits which were corrupt,\nand which have tainted your morals. You have been too familiar\nwith the other sex, and have not possessed modesty of deportment.\nYou would be well suited were there greater familiarity encouraged\nbetween men and women, much after Dr. A\u2019s theory. Your influence\nat ----- was not good. You were not a proper person for that place;\nyour light and trifling conversation disqualified you to exert a good\ninfluence. The character of your music was not such as to encourage\nelevated thoughts or feelings, but rather to degenerate.\nFor some weeks in the past your influence has been improving;\nbut you lack firmness of principle. You are deficient in many things,\nand in some things you must know where you fail. The follies of\nyour youth have left their impress upon you; you can never recover\nwhat you have lost through impure habits. These things have so\nbenumbed your sensibilities that sacred things are not clearly dis-\ncerned. You cannot, with your present experience, resist temptation.\nYou cannot endure trials. You are not sanctified through the truth.\nYou have taken hold of the truth, but it has not taken hold upon you\nto transform you by the renewing of your mind. You are a self-de-\nceived man. Oh, do not, I entreat you, remain deceived in regard\nto your true condition! You have not felt deep conviction because\nof your sins, and in humility sought the Lord with anguish of heart\nthat your transgressions might be blotted out. You could not see\nthat your ways were so sinful before God. Therefore the work of\nreformation has not been wrought in your soul.\n288\nForgetful Hearer 289\nYou have clothed yourself with a self-righteous garment to cover [323]\nup the deformity of sin; but this is not the remedy. You know not\nwhat true conversion is. The old man is not dead in you. You have a\nform of godliness, but not the cleansing power of God. You can and\ndo talk and write smoothly, and as far as your words go, they may\npossibly be correct; but the true language of the heart is not spoken.\nYou are enough acquainted with yourself to know this. Your case is\nperilous; yet God pities you, and will save you if you fall all broken\nat His feet, feeling your impurity and vileness, your rottenness of\nsoul, without the transforming power of God.\nMy brother, I do not wish to discourage you, but to lead you to\ninvestigate your motives and acts as in the light of eternity. Break\naway from Satan\u2019s snare. Do not, I beg of you, lead any person to\nthink of you in a more elevated light than you can bear, for when\nthis deception shall be removed, and your true self appear as you\nare, there will be a reaction. You do have convictions of the Spirit\nof God and feel the force of truth when you listen to it; but these\nsacred, softening impressions wear away, and you are a forgetful\nhearer. You are not established, strengthened, and settled in the truth.\nYou have thought it best for your interest to adopt the truth, but you\nhave not yet experienced its sanctifying influence. Now we would\nentreat of you, be not deceived, God is not mocked. It is not too late\nfor you to become a Christian; but do not move by impulse. Weigh\nevery move well, and deceive not your own soul.\n* * * * *\nChapter 48\u2014Remedy for Sentimentalism\nDear Sister B,\nIn the vision given me June 12 I was shown your case. You are\nin a sad state, not so much because of actual disease, although you\nare not well, but because of imaginary inability to labor. Several[324]\nyears ago I was shown that you suffered your mind to dwell too\nmuch upon the boys. You have frequently made them the theme of\nconversation, and your mind has run in a channel not profitable to\nyour spiritual advancement. You have fallen into a train of thinking\nwhich has led to evil results. You have injured and abused your own\nbody, and brought upon yourself an imbecile state of mind. You\nhave indulged in a lovesick train of thought and feeling until you\nare almost ruined, soul and body. Your indisposition to exercise is\nvery bad for you. Useful employment in bearing home burdens, and\nengaging in useful labor, would overcome this sickly, sentimental\nstate of feeling sooner than any other means.\nYou have been sympathized with too much. To relieve you from\nall responsibility has been a very great mistake. Nearly all your\nthoughts are now upon yourself. You are fretful, and your mind\ndwells upon sad things, and pictures your condition as very bad, and\nyou are even settling it in your mind that you can never get well\nunless you are married. In your present state of mind you are not\nfit to marry. There is no one who would wish you in your present\nhelpless, useless condition. If one should fancy he loved you, he\nwould be worthless; for no sensible man could think for a moment\nof placing his affections upon so useless an object.\nThe sad, gloomy state of your mind, which leads you to weep\nand feel that life is not desirable, is the result of allowing your\nthoughts to run in an impure channel, upon forbidden subjects,\nwhile you indulge habits that are steadily and surely undermining\nyour constitution and preparing you for premature decay. It would\nhave been far better for you had you never gone to -----. Your stay\nthere injured you. You dwelt upon your infirmities, and mingled in\n290\nRemedy for Sentimentalism 291\nsociety which was corrupting in its influence. Miss C was a corrupt,\nevil-minded woman. Her association with you increased the evil [325]\nwhich was already upon you. \u201cEvil communications corrupt good\nmanners.\u201d At the present time your condition is not acceptable in\nthe sight of God; yet you imagine that you have no desire to live.\nBut should you be taken at your expressed wish, and your life cease,\nyour case would be hopeless indeed. You are neither prepared for\nthis world nor the next.\nYou imagine that you cannot walk, or ride, or even exercise, and\nyou settle into a cold, dead apathy. You are a grief and anxiety to\nyour indulgent parents, and no comfort to yourself. You can rally,\nyou can work, you can shake off this terrible indifference. Your\nmother needs your aid; your father needs the comfort you can give\nhim; your brothers need a kindly care from their elder sister; your\nsisters need your instruction. But here you sit upon the stool of\nindolence, dreaming of unrequited love. For your own soul\u2019s sake,\nhave done with this folly. Read your Bible as you have never read\nit before. Engage in home duties, and lighten the cares of your\noverburdened, overworked parents. You may not be able to do a\ngreat amount at first, but every day increase the task you set yourself.\nThis is the surest remedy for a diseased mind and an abused body.\nIf you possess earnestness and steadiness of purpose, your mind\nwill come back, in a degree, to dwelling upon more healthful, pure\nsubjects. Self-indulgence has degenerated by degrees into such a\nwantonness of will as knows not how to please itself. Instead of\nregulating your actions by reason and principle, you suffer yourself\nto be guided by every slight and momentary impulse. This makes\nyou appear variable and inconstant. It is vain for others to seek to\nplease you, for you could not please yourself, even if all your wishes\nwere indulged. You are a capricious child and have become sick of\nyourself through very selfishness.\nThis wretched state is the result of unwise sympathy and flattery. [326]\nYou have had a very good mind, but it has become unbalanced by\nbeing directed in a wrong channel. You now amount to little else\nthan a blank in society. This need not be. You can do for yourself\nthat which no one else can do for you. You have duties to perform,\nbut you have so long yielded to a helpless condition that you imagine\n292 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nyou cannot do them. The will is at fault; you have the power, but not\nthe will.\nYou are pining for love. Jesus calls for your affections; if you will\ndevote them to Him, He will rid you of all this sickly, sentimental,\nimpure love, found in the pages of a novel. In Jesus you may love\nwith fervor, with earnestness. This love may increase in depth and\nexpand without limit, and not endanger health of body or strength of\nmind. You need love to God and to your neighbor. You must awake,\nyou must shake off this deception which is upon you, and seek pure\nlove.\nYour only hope of this life and the better life is to seek earnestly\nfor the true religion of Jesus. You have not a religious experience.\nYou need to be converted. Your listless, indolent, selfish sadness\nwill then give place to cheerfulness, which will be beneficial to body\nand mind. Love to God will ensure love to your neighbor, and you\nwill engage in the duties of life with a deep, unselfish interest. Pure\nprinciples should underlie your actions. Inward peace will bring\neven your thoughts into a healthful channel. Devote yourself to God,\nor you will never gain the better life.\nYou have duties to perform to your parents. You should not be\ndiscouraged if you become weary at first. It will not prove a lasting\ninjury. Your parents frequently become exceedingly weary. It will\nnot be half so injurious to you to become very weary in useful labor\nas for your mind to be dwelling upon yourself, fostering ailments\nand yielding to despondency. A faithful fulfillment of home duties,\nfilling the position you can occupy to the best advantage, be it ever[327]\nso simple and humble, is truly elevating. This divine influence is\nneeded. In this there is peace and sacred joy. It possesses healing\npower. It will secretly and insensibly soothe the wounds of the soul,\nand even the sufferings of the body. Peace of mind, which comes\nfrom pure and holy motives and actions, will give free and vigorous\nspring to all the organs of the body.\nInward peace and a conscience void of offense toward God will\nquicken and invigorate the intellect like dew distilled upon the tender\nplants. The will is then rightly directed and controlled, and is more\ndecided, and yet free from perverseness. The meditations are pleas-\ning because they are sanctified. The serenity of mind which you\nmay possess will bless all with whom you associate. This peace and\nRemedy for Sentimentalism 293\ncalmness will, in time, become natural, and will reflect its precious\nrays upon all around you, to be again reflected upon you. The more\nyou taste this heavenly peace and quietude of mind, the more it will\nincrease. It is an animated, living pleasure which does not throw\nall the moral energies into a stupor, but awakens them to increased\nactivity. Perfect peace is an attribute of heaven which angels possess.\nMay God help you to become a possessor of this peace.\n* * * * *\nChapter 49\u2014Duty to Orphans\nDear Brother and Sister D,\nYour late visit and conversation with us have suggested many\nthoughts, of which I cannot forbear placing a few upon paper. I\nwas very sorry that E had not carried himself correctly at all times;\nyet, when you consider, you cannot expect perfection in youth at\nhis age. Children have faults, and they need a great deal of patient\ninstruction.\nThat he should have feelings not always correct is no more than[328]\ncan be expected of a boy of his age. You must remember that he has\nno father or mother, no one to whom he can confide his feelings, his\nsorrows, and his temptations. Every person feels that he must have\nsome sympathizer. This boy has been tossed about here and there,\nfrom pillar to post, and he may have many errors, many careless\nways, with considerable independence, and he may lack reverence.\nBut he is quite enterprising, and with right instruction and kind\ntreatment, I have the fullest confidence that he would not disappoint\nour hopes, but would fully repay all the labor expended on him.\nConsidering his disadvantages, I think he is a very good boy.\nWhen we entreated you to take him we did it because we fully\nbelieved it was your duty and that in doing so you would be blessed.\nWe did not expect that you would do this merely to be benefited by\nthe help that you would receive from the boy, but to benefit him, to\ndo a duty to the orphan\u2014a duty which every true Christian should\nbe seeking and anxiously watching to perform; a duty, a sacrificing\nduty, which we believed it would do you good to take up, if you\ndid it cheerfully, with a view to being the instrument in the hands\nof God of saving a soul from the snares of Satan, of saving a son\nwhose father devoted his precious life to pointing souls to the Lamb\nof God who taketh away the sin of the world.\nFrom what was shown me, Sabbathkeeping Adventists have but\na feeble sense of how large a place the world and selfishness hold in\ntheir hearts. If you have a desire to do good and glorify God, there\n294\nDuty to Orphans 295\nare many ways in which you can do it. But you have not felt that this\nwas the result of true religion. This is the fruit which every good\ntree will produce. You have not felt that it was required of you to be\ninterested in others, to make their cases your own, and to manifest\nan unselfish interest for the very ones who stand most in need of [329]\nhelp. You have not reached out to help the most needy, the most\nhelpless. Had you children of your own to call into exercise care,\naffection, and love, you would not be so much shut up to yourselves\nand to your own interests. If those who have no children, and whom\nGod has made stewards of means, would expand their hearts to care\nfor children who need love, care, and affection, and assistance with\nthis world\u2019s goods, they would be far happier than they are today.\nSo long as youth who have not a father\u2019s pitying care nor a mother\u2019s\ntender love are exposed to the corrupting influences of these last\ndays, it is somebody\u2019s duty to supply the place of father and mother\nto some of them. Learn to give them love, affection, and sympathy.\nAll who profess to have a Father in heaven, who they hope will care\nfor them and finally take them to the home He has prepared for them,\nought to feel a solemn obligation resting upon them to be friends to\nthe friendless and fathers to the orphans, to aid the widows, and be\nof some practical use in this world by benefiting humanity. Many\nhave not viewed these things in a right light. If they live merely for\nthemselves, they will have no greater strength than this calls for.\nThe youth who are growing up among us are not cared for as they\nshould be. Some of the brethren must have duties which they are not\nwilling and ready to see and perform. The fear of inconveniencing\nthemselves is a sufficient excuse for many. The day of God will\nreveal unfulfilled duties\u2014souls lost because the selfish would not\ntake pains to interest themselves in their behalf.\nI was shown that should professed Christians cultivate more\naffection and kind regard in caring for others, they would be repaid\nfourfold. God marks. He knows for what object we live, and whether\nour living is put to the very best account for poor, fallen humanity, [330]\nor whether our eyes are eclipsed to everything but our own interest,\nand to everyone but our own poor selves. I entreat you, in behalf\nof Christ, in behalf of your own souls, and in behalf of the youth,\nnot to think so lightly of this matter as many do. It is a grave, a\nserious thing, and affects your interest in the kingdom of Christ,\n296 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ninasmuch as the salvation of precious souls is involved. Why is it\nnot a duty which God enjoins upon you who are able, to expend\nsomething for the benefit of the homeless, even though they may\nbe ignorant and undisciplined? Shall you study to labor only in\nthe direction where you will receive the most selfish pleasure and\nprofit? It is not meet for you to neglect the divine favor that Heaven\noffers you if you will care for those who need your care, and thus\nlet God knock in vain at your door. He stands there in the person\nof the poor, the homeless orphans, and the afflicted widows, who\nneed love, sympathy, affection, and encouragement. If you do it not\nunto one of these, you would not do it unto Christ were He upon the\nearth.\nCall to mind your former wretchedness, your spiritual blindness,\nand the darkness which enshrouded you before Christ, a tender,\nloving Saviour, came to your aid and reached you where you were.\nIf you let these seasons pass without giving tangible proofs of your\ngratitude for this wonderful and amazing love which a compas-\nsionate Saviour exercised toward you, who were aliens from the\ncommonwealth of Israel, there is reason to fear that still greater\ndarkness and misery will come upon you. Now is your sowing time.\nYou will reap that which you sow. Avail yourselves while you may\nof every privilege of doing good. These privileges improved are as a\npassing shower, which will water and revive you. Lay hold of every\nopportunity within your reach of doing good. Idle hands will reap\na small harvest. For what do older persons live but to care for the[331]\nyoung and help the helpless? God has committed them to us who\nare older and have experience, and He will call us to account if our\nduties in this direction are neglected. What though our labor may\nnot be appreciated! what though it prove a failure many times, and a\nsuccess but once! This once will outweigh all the discouragements\npreviously borne.\nBut few have a true sense of what is comprised in the word\nChristian. It is to be Christlike, to do others good, to be divested of\nall selfishness, and to have our lives marked with acts of disinterested\nbenevolence. Our Redeemer throws souls into the arms of the church,\nfor them to care for unselfishly and train for heaven, and thus be\nco-workers with Him. But the church too often thrusts them away,\nupon the devil\u2019s battlefield. One member will say, \u201cIt is not my\nDuty to Orphans 297\nduty,\u201d and then bring up some trifling excuse. \u201cWell,\u201d says another,\n\u201cneither is it my duty;\u201d and finally it is nobody\u2019s duty, and the soul is\nleft uncared for to perish. It is the duty of every Christian to engage\nin this self-denying, self-sacrificing enterprise. Cannot God return\ninto their granaries and increase their flocks, so that instead of loss\nthere shall be increase? \u201cThere is that scattereth, and yet increaseth;\nand there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to\npoverty.\u201d\nBut every man\u2019s work is to be tested, and brought into judgment,\nand he be rewarded as his works have been. \u201cHonor the Lord with thy\nsubstance, and with the first fruits of all thine increase: so shall thy\nbarns be filled with plenty.\u201d \u201cIs not this the fast that I have chosen?\nto loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to\nlet the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to\ndeal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are\ncast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover\nhim; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?\u201d Read [332]\nthe next verse, and notice the rich reward promised to those who\ndo this. \u201cThen shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine\nhealth shall spring forth speedily.\u201d Here is an abundantly precious\npromise for all who will interest themselves in the cases of those\nwho need help. How can God come in and bless and prosper those\nwho have no special care for anyone except themselves, and who do\nnot use that which He has entrusted to them, to glorify His name on\nthe earth?\nSister Hannah More is dead, and died a martyr to the selfishness\nof a people who profess to be seeking for glory, honor, immortality,\nand eternal life. Exiled from believers during the past cold winter,\nthis self-sacrificing missionary died because no heart was bountiful\nenough to receive her. I blame no one. I am not judge. But when\nthe Judge of all the earth shall make investigation, somebody will be\nfound to blame. We are all narrowed up and consumed in our own\nselfishness. May God tear away this cursed covering and give us\nbowels of mercy, hearts of flesh, tenderness and compassion, is my\nprayer, offered from an oppressed, anguished soul. I am sure that a\nwork must be done for us or we shall be found wanting in the day of\nGod.\n298 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nIn regard to E, do not, I entreat of you, forget that he is a child,\nwith only a child\u2019s experience. Do not measure him, a poor, weak,\nfeeble boy, with yourselves and expect of him accordingly. I fully\nbelieve that it is in your power to do the right thing by this orphan.\nYou can present inducements to him so that he will not feel that his\ntask is cheerless, unrelieved by a ray of encouragement. You, my\nbrother and sister, can enjoy yourselves in each other\u2019s confidence,\nyou can sympathize with each other, interest and amuse each other,\nand tell your trials and burdens to each other. You have something to\ncheer you, while he is alone. He is a thinking boy, but has no one to[333]\nconfide in or to give him a cheering word amid his discouragements\nand severe trials, which I know he has as well as those more advanced\nin years.\nIf you shut yourselves up to each other, it is selfish love, unat-\ntended with Heaven\u2019s blessing. I have strong hope that you will love\nthe orphan for Christ\u2019s sake, that you will feel that your possessions\nare but worthless unless employed in doing good. Do good; be rich\nin good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, laying\nup in store for yourselves a good foundation against the time to come\nthat you may lay hold on eternal life. None will reap the reward of\neverlasting life but the self-sacrificing. A dying father and mother\nleft their jewels to the care of the church to be instructed in the things\nof God and fitted for heaven. When these parents shall look about\nfor their dear ones, and one is found missing because of neglect,\nwhat will the church answer? It is in a great degree responsible for\nthe salvation of these orphan children.\nIn all probability you have failed to gain the boy\u2019s confidence\nand affection by not giving him more tangible proofs of your love\nby holding out some inducements. If you could not expend money\nyou could at least in some way encourage him by letting him know\nyou were not indifferent to his case. That the love and affection\nis to be all on one side is a mistake. How much affection have\nyou educated yourselves to manifest? You are too much shut up to\nyourselves, and do not feel the necessity of surrounding yourselves\nwith an atmosphere of tenderness and gentleness, which comes from\ntrue nobility of soul. Brother and Sister F left their children to the\ncare of the church. They had plenty of wealthy relatives who wanted\nthe children; but they were unbelievers, and if allowed to have the\nDuty to Orphans 299\ncare, or become the guardians, of the children, would lead their\nhearts away from the truth into error, and endanger their salvation. [334]\nBecause these relatives were not allowed to take the children, they\nwere dissatisfied, and have done nothing for them. The confidence of\nthe parents in the church should be considered, and not be forgotten\nbecause of selfishness.\nWe have the deepest interest for these children. One has already\ndeveloped a beautiful Christian character and married a minister of\nthe gospel. And now, in return for the care and burdens borne for\nher, she is a true burden bearer in the church. She is sought unto\nfor advice and counsel by the less experienced, and they seek not in\nvain. She possesses true Christian humility, with becoming dignity,\nwhich can but inspire respect and confidence in all who know her.\nThese children are as near to me as my own. I shall not lose sight of\nthem, nor cease my care for them. I love them sincerely, tenderly,\naffectionately.\n* * * * *\nChapter 50\u2014Appeal to Ministers\nOctober 2, 1868, I was shown the great and solemn work before\nus of warning the world of the coming judgment. Our example, if in\naccordance with the truth we profess, will save a few, and condemn\nthe many, leaving them without excuse in the day when the cases of\nall will be decided. The righteous are to be prepared for everlasting\nlife, and sinners, who will not become acquainted with the will and\nways of God, are appointed to destruction.\nNot all who preach the truth to others are sanctified by it. Some\nhave but faint views of the sacred character of the work. They fail to\ntrust in God and to have all their works wrought in Him. Their inmost\nsouls have not been converted. They have not in their daily life\nexperienced the mystery of godliness. They are handling immortal\ntruths, weighty as eternity, but are not careful and earnest to have[335]\nthese truths inwrought in their souls, made a part of themselves, so\nthat they shall influence them in all they do. They are not so wedded\nto the principles which these truths inculcate that it is impossible to\nseparate any part of the truth from them.\nSanctification of heart and life is alone acceptable with God.\nSaid the angel, as he pointed to the ministers who are not right:\n\u201cCleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-\nminded.\u201d \u201cBe ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.\u201d God calls\nfor integrity of soul; for truth in the inward parts, transforming the\nentire man by the renewing of the mind through the influences of\nthe divine Spirit. Not all the ministers are devoted to the work; not\nall have put their hearts into it. They move as listlessly as though\na temporal millennium were allowed them in which to work for\nsouls. They shun burdens and responsibilities, care and privations.\nSelf-denial, suffering, and weariness are not pleasant nor convenient.\nIt is the study of some to save themselves from wearing labor. They\nstudy their own convenience and how to please themselves, their\nwives, and their children; and the work upon which they have entered\nis nearly lost sight of.\n300\nAppeal to Ministers 301\nGod calls for humiliation of soul and humble confessions from\nthe ministers whose works have not been wrought in Him. I was\ncited to men who engage in worldly enterprises. They know that if\nthey would gain their object they must suffer fatigue. They sacrifice\nease and love of home, and endure privations; they are persevering,\nenergetic, and ardent. Our ministers do not all manifest half the zeal\nshown by those who are securing earthly gain. They are not as intent\nupon their purpose, nor as earnest in their efforts; they are not as\npersevering, and are not as willing to deny themselves, as those who\nengage in worldly pursuits.\nCompare these two enterprises. One is certain, eternal, enduring\nas the life of God; the other is a thing of this life, changeable, [336]\nperishable, and if men succeed in their ambitious pursuits, that\nwhich they gain frequently stings like an adder, and drowns them in\nperdition. Oh, why should there be so great a contrast in the efforts\nof those who are engaged\u2014the one class in a worldly enterprise,\nthe other in a heavenly? the one laboring for a treasure here that is\nperishable, and in the effort suffering much pain for that which is\nfrequently a source of great evil, the other putting forth efforts for\nthe salvation of precious souls, which will be approved of Heaven\nand rewarded with heavenly riches. There are no risks to run here,\nno losses to be sustained, the profits are sure and immense.\nThose who are in Christ\u2019s stead beseeching souls to be reconciled\nto God should by precept and example manifest an undying interest\nto save souls. Their earnestness, perseverance, self-denial, and spirit\nof sacrifice should as far exceed the diligence and earnestness of\nthose securing earthly gain as the soul is more valuable than the\ntrash of earth and the subject more elevated than earthly enterprises.\nAll worldly enterprises are of trifling importance compared with\nthe work of saving souls. Earthly things are not enduring, although\nthey cost so much. But one soul saved will shine in the kingdom of\nheaven throughout eternal ages.\nSome of the ministers are asleep, and the people are also asleep;\nbut Satan is wide awake. There is but little sacrificing for God or the\ntruth. Ministers must set the example. In their labors they should\nshow that they esteem eternal things of infinite value and earthly\nthings as nothing in comparison. There are ministers preaching\npresent truth who must be converted. Their understanding must be\n302 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ninvigorated, their hearts purified, their affections centered in God.\nThey should present the truth in a manner which will arouse the\nintellect to appreciate its excellence, purity, and sacredness. In\norder to do this, they should keep before their minds objects which\nare elevated and which have a purifying, quickening, and exalting[337]\ninfluence upon the mind. They must have the purifying fire of truth\nburning upon the altar of their hearts, to influence and characterize\ntheir lives; then, go where they will, amid darkness and gloom, they\nwill illuminate those in darkness with the light dwelling in them and\nshining round about them.\nMinisters must be imbued with the same spirit as was their Mas-\nter when He was upon earth. He went about doing good, blessing\nothers with His influence. He was a man of sorrows and acquainted\nwith grief. Ministers should have clear conceptions of eternal things\nand of God\u2019s claims upon them; then they can impress others and\nexcite in them a love for contemplating heavenly things.\nMinisters should become Bible students. Are the truths which\nthey handle mighty? Then they should seek to handle them skillfully.\nTheir ideas should be clear and strong, and their spirits fervent, or\nthey will weaken the force of the truth which they handle. By\ntamely presenting the truth, merely repeating the theory without\nbeing stirred by it themselves, they can never convert men. If they\nshould live as long as did Noah, their efforts would be without\neffect. Their love for souls must be intense and their zeal fervent. A\nlistless, unfeeling manner of presenting the truth will never arouse\nmen and women from their deathlike slumber. They must show by\ntheir manners, by their acts and words, and by their preaching and\npraying, that they believe that Christ is at the door. Men and women\nare in the last hours of probation, and yet are careless and stupid, and\nministers have no power to arouse them; they are asleep themselves.\nSleeping preachers preaching to a sleeping people!\nA great work must be accomplished for ministers in order for\nthem to make the preaching of the truth a success. The word of\nGod should be thoroughly studied. All other reading is inferior to[338]\nthis. A careful study of the Bible will not necessarily exclude all\nother reading of a religious nature; but if the word of God is studied\nprayerfully, all reading which will have a tendency to divert the\nmind from it will be excluded. If we study the word of God with an\nAppeal to Ministers 303\ninterest, and pray to understand it, new beauties will be seen in every\nline. God will reveal precious truth so clearly that the mind will\nderive sincere pleasure and have a continual feast as its comforting\nand sublime truths are unfolded.\nVisiting from house to house forms an important part of the\nminister\u2019s labors. He should aim to converse with all the members\nof the family, whether they profess the truth or not. It is his duty to\nascertain the spiritual condition of all; and he should live so near\nto God that he can counsel, exhort, and reprove, carefully and in\nwisdom. He should have the grace of God in his own heart and\nthe glory of God constantly in view. All lightness and trifling is\npositively forbidden in the word of God. His conversation should\nbe in heaven, his words seasoned with grace. All flattery should\nbe put away, for it is Satan\u2019s work to flatter. Poor, weak, fallen\nmen generally think enough of themselves and need no help in this\ndirection. Flattering your ministers is out of place. It perverts the\nmind and does not lead to meekness and humility; yet men and\nwomen love to be praised, and it is too frequently the case that\nministers love it. Their vanity is gratified by it, but it has proved a\ncurse to many. Reproof is more to be prized than flattery.\nNot all who are preaching the truth realize that their testimony\nand example are deciding the destiny of souls. If they are unfaithful\nin their mission, and become careless in their work, souls will be\nlost as the result. If they are self-sacrificing and faithful in the work\nwhich the Master has given them to do, they will be instrumental\nin the salvation of many. Some permit trifles to divert them from [339]\nthe work. Bad roads, rainy weather, or little matters at home are\nsufficient excuses for them to leave the work of laboring for souls.\nAnd frequently this is done at the most important time in the work.\nWhen an interest has been raised and the minds of the people are\nagitated, the interest is left to die out because the minister chooses a\nmore pleasant and easy field. Those who pursue this course show\nplainly that they do not have the burden of the work upon them. They\nwish to be carried by the people. They are not willing to endure the\nprivations and hardships which are ever the lot of a true shepherd.\nSome have no experience in taking hold of the work as though\nit was of vital importance. They do not enter upon it with that zeal\nand earnestness which would show that they are doing work which\n304 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwill have to bear the test of the judgment. They work too much in\ntheir own strength. They do not make God their trust, and therefore\nerrors and imperfections mark all their efforts. They do not give the\nLord an opportunity to do anything for them. They do not walk by\nfaith, but by sight. They will go no faster or further than they can\nsee. They do not seem to understand that venturing something for\nthe truth\u2019s sake has any part in their religious experience.\nSome go from their homes to labor in the gospel field, but do\nnot act as though the truths which they speak were a reality to them.\nTheir actions show that they have not experienced the saving power\nof the truth themselves. When out of the desk, they appear to have\nno burden of the truth. They labor sometimes apparently to profit,\nbut more frequently to no profit. Such feel as much entitled to the\nwages they receive as though they had earned them; notwithstanding\ntheir unconsecration has cost more labor, anxiety, and pain of heart\nto those laborers who have the burden of the work upon them than[340]\nall their efforts have done good. Such are not profitable workmen.\nBut they will have to bear this responsibility themselves.\nIt is often the case that ministers are inclined to visit almost\nentirely among the churches, devoting their time and strength where\ntheir labor will do no good. Frequently the churches are in advance\nof the ministers who labor among them, and would be in a more\nprosperous condition if those ministers would keep out of their way\nand give them an opportunity to work. The effort of such ministers to\nbuild up the churches only tears them down. The theory of the truth\nis presented over and over again, but it is not accompanied by the\nvitalizing power of God. They manifest a listless indifference; the\nspirit is contagious, and the churches lose their interest and burden\nfor the salvation of others. Thus by their preaching and example the\nministers lull the people to carnal security. If they would leave the\nchurches, go out into new fields, and labor to raise up churches, they\nwould understand their ability and what it costs to bring souls out\nto take their position upon the truth. And they would then realize\nhow careful they should be that their example and influence might\nnever discourage or weaken those whom it had required so much\nhard, prayerful labor to convert to the truth. \u201cLet every man prove\nhis own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and\nnot in another.\u201d\nAppeal to Ministers 305\nThe churches give of their means to sustain the ministers in their\nlabors. What have they to encourage them in their liberality? Some\nministers labor from month to month and accomplish so little that\nthe churches become disheartened; they cannot see that anything is\nbeing done to convert souls to the truth nor to make those who are\nchurch members more spiritual or fervent in their love to God and\nHis truth. Those who are handling sacred things should be wholly\nconsecrated to the work. They should possess an unselfish interest\nin it and a fervent love for perishing souls. If they do not have this [341]\nthey have mistaken their mission and should cease their labor of\nteaching others, for they do more harm than they can possibly do\ngood. Some ministers display themselves, but do not feed the flock\nthat are perishing for meat in due season.\nThere is a disposition with some to shrink from opposition. They\nfear to go into new places because of the darkness and the conflicts\nthey expect to meet. This is cowardice. The people must be met\nwhere they are. They need stirring appeals and practical, as well\nas doctrinal, discourses. Precept backed up by example will have a\npowerful influence.\nA faithful shepherd will not study his own ease and convenience,\nbut will labor for the interest of the sheep. In this great work he will\nforget self; in his search for the lost sheep he will not realize that he\nhimself is weary, cold, and hungry. He has but one object in view: to\nsave the lost and wandering sheep at whatever expense it may be to\nhimself. His wages will not influence him in his labor nor turn him\nfrom his duty. He has received his commission from the Majesty of\nheaven, and he expects his reward when the work entrusted to him\nis done.\nThose who engage in the business of schoolteaching prepare for\nthe work. They qualify themselves by attending school and interest-\ning their minds in study. They are not allowed to teach children and\nyouth in the sciences unless they are capable of instructing them.\nUpon applying for a situation as teacher, they have to pass an ex-\namination before competent persons. It is an important work to\ndeal with young minds and instruct them correctly in the sciences.\nBut of how much greater importance is the work of the ministry!\nYet many engage in the important business of interesting men and\nwomen to enter the school of Christ, where they are to learn how\n306 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthey may form characters for heaven, who need to become students\nthemselves. Some who enter the ministry do not feel the burden\nof the work upon them. They have received incorrect ideas of the[342]\nqualifications of a minister. They have thought that it required but\nlittle close study in the sciences or in the word of God to make a\nminister. Some who are teaching present truth are not acquainted\nwith their Bibles. They are so deficient in Bible knowledge that\nit is difficult for them to quote a text of Scripture correctly from\nmemory. By blundering along in the awkward manner they do, they\nsin against God. They mangle the scripture, and make the Bible say\nthings that are not written therein.\nSome who have all their lives been led by feeling have thought\nthat an education or a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures was of\nno consequence if they only had the Spirit. But God never sends His\nSpirit to sanction ignorance. Those who have not knowledge, and\nwho are so situated that it is impossible for them to obtain it, the\nLord may, and does, pity and bless, and sometimes condescends to\nmake His strength perfect in their weakness. But He makes it the\nduty of such to study His word. A lack of knowledge in the sciences\nis no excuse for a neglect of Bible study; for the words of inspiration\nare so plain that the unlearned may understand them.\nOf all men upon the face of the earth, those who are handling\nsolemn truths for these perilous times should understand their Bibles\nand become acquainted with the evidences of our faith. Unless\nthey possess a knowledge of the word of life they have no right to\nundertake to instruct others in the way to life. Ministers should give\nall diligence to add to their \u201cfaith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;\nand to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and\nto patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to\nbrotherly kindness charity.\u201d Some of our ministers graduate when\nthey have scarcely learned the first principles of the doctrine of\nChrist. Those who are ambassadors for Christ, who stand in His\nstead, beseeching souls to be reconciled to God, should be qualified[343]\nto present our faith intelligently and be able to give the reasons\nof their hope with meekness and fear. Said Christ: \u201cSearch the\nScriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are\nthey which testify of Me.\u201d\nAppeal to Ministers 307\nMinisters who teach unpopular truth will be beset by men who\nare urged on by Satan and who, like their master, can quote Scripture\nreadily; and shall the servants of God be unequal to the servants\nof Satan in handling the words of Inspiration? They should, like\nChrist, meet scripture with scripture. Oh, that those who minister\nin holy things would awake, and, like the noble Bereans, search the\nScriptures daily! Brethren in the ministry, I entreat of you to study\nthe Scriptures with humble prayer for an understanding heart, that\nyou may teach the way of life more perfectly. Your counsel, prayers,\nand example must be a savor of life unto life, or you are unqualified\nto point out the way of life to others.\nThe Master requires all His servants to improve upon the talents\nHe has committed to them. But how much more will He require of\nthose who profess to understand the way to life, and who take upon\nthemselves the responsibility of guiding others therein. The apostle\nPaul exhorted Timothy: \u201cThou therefore, my son, be strong in the\ngrace that is in Christ Jesus. And the things that thou hast heard of\nme among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men,\nwho shall be able to teach others also.\u201d\nThe glorious results that attended the ministry of the chosen\ndisciples of Christ were the effects of bearing about in their bodies\nthe dying of the Lord Jesus. Some of those who testified of Christ\nwere unlearned and ignorant men; but grace and truth reigned in\ntheir hearts, inspiring and purifying their lives, and controlling their\nactions. They were living representatives of the mind and spirit of [344]\nChrist. They were living epistles, known and read of all men. They\nwere hated and persecuted by all who would not receive the truth\nthey preached, and who despised the cross of Christ.\nWicked men will not oppose a form of godliness nor reject a\npopular ministry which presents no cross for them to bear. The\nnatural heart will raise no serious objection to a religion in which\nthere is nothing to make the transgressor of the law tremble or\nbring to bear upon the heart and conscience the terrible realities of\na judgment to come. It is the demonstration of the Spirit and the\npower of God which raises opposition and leads the natural heart to\nrebel. The truth that saves the soul must not only come from God;\nbut His Spirit must attend its communication to others, else it falls\npowerless before opposing influences. Oh, that the truth would fall\n308 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nfrom the lips of God\u2019s servants with such power as to burn its way\nto the hearts of the people!\nMinisters must be endued with power from on high. When the\ntruth in its simplicity and strength, as it is in Jesus, is brought to bear\nagainst the spirit of the world, condemning its exciting pleasures\nand corrupting charms, it will then be plainly seen that there is\nno concord between Christ and Belial. The natural heart cannot\ndiscern the things of the Spirit of God. An unconsecrated minister,\npresenting the truth in an unimpassioned manner, his own soul\nunmoved by the truths he speaks to others, will do only harm. Every\neffort he makes only lowers the standard.\nSelfish interest must be swallowed up in deep anxiety for the\nsalvation of souls. Some ministers have labored, not because they\ndared not do otherwise, not because the woe was upon them, but\nhaving in view the wages they were to receive. Said the angel:\n\u201cWho is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought?\nneither do ye kindle fire on Mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure\nin you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at[345]\nyour hand.\u201d\nIt is entirely wrong to buy every errand that is done for the Lord.\nThe treasury of the Lord has been drained by those who have been\nonly an injury to the cause. If ministers give themselves wholly to\nthe work of God, and devote all their energies to building up His\ncause, they will have no lack. As regards temporal things, they have\na better portion than their Lord and better than His chosen disciples\nwhom He sent forth to save perishing man. Our great Exemplar,\nwho was in the brightness of His Father\u2019s glory, was despised and\nrejected of men. Reproach and falsehood followed Him. His chosen\ndisciples were living examples of the life and spirit of their Master.\nThey were honored with stripes and imprisonment; and it was finally\ntheir portion to seal their ministry with their blood.\nWhen ministers are so interested in the work that they love it as\na part of their existence, then they can say: \u201cWho shall separate us\nfrom the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution,\nor famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For Thy\nsake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for\nthe slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors\nthrough Him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death,\nAppeal to Ministers 309\nnor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,\nnor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature,\nshall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ\nJesus our Lord.\u201d\n\u201cThe elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder,\nand a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the\nglory that shall be revealed: feed the flock of God which is among\nyou, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly;\nnot for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over\nGod\u2019s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. And when the\nChief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that [346]\nfadeth not away.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 51\u2014Moral Pollution\nI have been shown that we live amid the perils of the last days.\nBecause iniquity abounds, the love of many waxes cold. The word\n\u201cmany\u201d refers to the professed followers of Christ. They are affected\nby the prevailing iniquity and backslide from God, but it is not nec-\nessary that they should be thus affected. The cause of this declension\nis that they do not stand clear from this iniquity. The fact that their\nlove to God is waxing cold because iniquity abounds shows that they\nare, in some sense, partakers in this iniquity, or it would not affect\ntheir love for God and their zeal and fervor in His cause.\nA terrible picture of the condition of the world has been presented\nbefore me. Immorality abounds everywhere. Licentiousness is the\nspecial sin of this age. Never did vice lift its deformed head with\nsuch boldness as now. The people seem to be benumbed, and the\nlovers of virtue and true goodness are nearly discouraged by its\nboldness, strength, and prevalence. The iniquity which abounds is\nnot merely confined to the unbeliever and the scoffer. Would that this\nwere the case, but it is not. Many men and women who profess the\nreligion of Christ are guilty. Even some who profess to be looking\nfor His appearing are no more prepared for that event than Satan\nhimself. They are not cleansing themselves from all pollution. They\nhave so long served their lust that it is natural for their thoughts to be\nimpure and their imaginations corrupt. It is as impossible to cause\ntheir minds to dwell upon pure and holy things as it would be to turn\nthe course of Niagara and send its waters pouring up the falls.\nYouth and children of both sexes engage in moral pollution,[347]\nand practice this disgusting, soul-and-body-destroying vice. Many\nprofessed Christians are so benumbed by the same practice that their\nmoral sensibilities cannot be aroused to understand that it is sin, and\nthat if continued its sure results will be utter shipwreck of body and\nmind. Man, the noblest being upon the earth, formed in the image of\nGod, transforms himself into a beast! He makes himself gross and\ncorrupt. Every Christian will have to learn to restrain his passions\n310\nMoral Pollution 311\nand be controlled by principle. Unless he does this he is unworthy\nof the Christian name.\nSome who make a high profession do not understand the sin of\nself-abuse and its sure results. Long-established habit has blinded\ntheir understanding. They do not realize the exceeding sinfulness\nof this degrading sin, which is enervating the system and destroy-\ning their brain nerve power. Moral principle is exceedingly weak\nwhen it conflicts with established habit. Solemn messages from\nheaven cannot forcibly impress the heart that is not fortified against\nthe indulgence of this degrading vice. The sensitive nerves of the\nbrain have lost their healthy tone by morbid excitation to gratify an\nunnatural desire for sensual indulgence. The brain nerves which\ncommunicate with the entire system are the only medium through\nwhich Heaven can communicate to man and affect his inmost life.\nWhatever disturbs the circulation of the electric currents in the ner-\nvous system lessens the strength of the vital powers, and the result is\na deadening of the sensibilities of the mind. In consideration of these\nfacts, how important that ministers and people who profess godliness\nshould stand forth clear and untainted from this soul-debasing vice!\nMy soul has been bowed down with anguish as I have been shown\nthe weak condition of God\u2019s professed people. Iniquity abounds, [348]\nand the love of many waxes cold. There are but few professed\nChristians who regard this matter in the right light and who hold\nproper government over themselves when public opinion and custom\ndo not condemn them. How few restrain their passions because they\nfeel under moral obligation to do so and because the fear of God\nis before their eyes! The higher faculties of man are enslaved by\nappetite and corrupt passions.\nSome will acknowledge the evil of sinful indulgences, yet will\nexcuse themselves by saying that they cannot overcome their pas-\nsions. This is a terrible admission for any person to make who names\nChrist. \u201cLet everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from\niniquity.\u201d Why is this weakness? It is because the animal propensi-\nties have been strengthened by exercise until they have gained the\nascendancy over the higher powers. Men and women lack principle.\nThey are dying spiritually because they have so long pampered their\nnatural appetites that their power of self-government seems gone.\nThe lower passions of their nature have taken the reins, and that\n312 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwhich should be the governing power has become the servant of\ncorrupt passion. The soul is held in lowest bondage. Sensuality has\nquenched the desire for holiness and withered spiritual prosperity.\nMy soul mourns for the youth who are forming characters in\nthis degenerate age. I tremble for their parents also; for I have been\nshown that as a general thing they do not understand their obligations\nto train up their children in the way they should go. Custom and\nfashion are consulted, and the children soon learn to be swayed by\nthese and are corrupted; while their indulgent parents are themselves\nbenumbed and asleep to their danger. But very few of the youth are\nfree from corrupt habits. They are excused from physical exercise\nto a great degree for fear they will overwork. The parents bear[349]\nburdens themselves which their children should bear. Overwork\nis bad, but the result of indolence is more to be dreaded. Idleness\nleads to the indulgence of corrupt habits. Industry does not weary\nand exhaust one-fifth part as much as the pernicious habit of self-\nabuse. If simple, well-regulated labor exhausts your children, be\nassured, parents, there is something, aside from their labor, which is\nenervating their systems and producing a sense of constant weariness.\nGive your children physical labor, which will call into exercise the\nnerves and muscles. The weariness attending such labor will lessen\ntheir inclination to indulge in vicious habits. Idleness is a curse. It\nproduces licentious habits.\nMany cases have been presented before me, and as I have had a\nview of their inner lives, my soul has been sick and disgusted with\nthe rotten-heartedness of human beings who profess godliness and\ntalk of translation to heaven. I have frequently asked myself: Whom\ncan I trust? Who is free from iniquity?\nMy husband and I once attended a meeting where our sympathies\nwere enlisted for a brother who was a great sufferer with the phthisic.\nHe was pale and emaciated. He requested the prayers of the people\nof God. He said that his family were sick and that he had lost a\nchild. He spoke with feeling of his bereavement. He said that he\nhad been waiting for some time to see Brother and Sister White. He\nhad believed that if they would pray for him he would be healed.\nAfter the meeting closed, the brethren called our attention to the\ncase. They said that the church was assisting them; that his wife was\nsick, and his child had died. The brethren had met at his house, and\nMoral Pollution 313\nunited in praying for the afflicted family. We were much worn, and\nhad the burden of labor upon us during the meeting, and wished to\nbe excused.\nI had resolved not to engage in prayer for anyone unless the [350]\nSpirit of the Lord should dictate in the matter. I had been shown\nthat there was so much iniquity abounding, even among professed\nSabbathkeepers, that I did not wish to unite in prayer for those of\nwhose history I had no knowledge. I stated my reason. I was assured\nby the brethren that, as far as they knew, he was a worthy brother. I\nconversed a few words with the one who had solicited our prayers\nthat he might be healed, but I could not feel free. He wept, and said\nthat he had waited for us to come, and he felt assured that if we\nwould pray for him he would be restored to health. We told him\nthat we were unacquainted with his life, that we would rather those\nwho knew him would pray for him. He importuned us so earnestly\nthat we decided to consider his case and present it before the Lord\nthat night; and if the way seemed clear, we would comply with his\nrequest.\nThat night we bowed in prayer and presented his case before the\nLord. We entreated that we might know the will of God concerning\nhim. All we desired was that God might be glorified. Would the\nLord have us pray for this afflicted man? We left the burden with the\nLord and retired to rest. In a dream the case of that man was clearly\npresented. His course from his childhood up was shown, and that if\nwe should pray the Lord would not hear us; for he regarded iniquity\nin his heart. The next morning the man came for us to pray for him.\nWe took him aside and told him we were sorry to be compelled to\nrefuse his request. I related my dream, which he acknowledged was\ntrue. He had practiced self-abuse from his boyhood up, and he had\ncontinued the practice during his married life, but said he would try\nto break himself of it.\nThis man had a long-established habit to overcome. He was\nin the middle age of life. His moral principles were so weak that\nwhen brought in conflict with long-established indulgence they were [351]\novercome. The baser passions had gained the ascendancy over the\nhigher nature. I asked him in regard to health reform. He said he\ncould not live it. His wife would throw graham flour out of doors\nif it were brought into the house. This family had been helped by\n314 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthe church. Prayer had also been offered in their behalf. Their child\nhad died, the wife was sick, and the husband and father would leave\nhis case upon us for us to bring before a pure and holy God, that He\nmight work a miracle and make him well. The moral sensibilities of\nthis man were benumbed.\nWhen the young adopt vile practices while the spirit is tender,\nthey will never obtain force to fully and correctly develop physical,\nintellectual, and moral character. Here was a man debasing himself\ndaily, and yet daring to venture into the presence of God and ask\nan increase of strength which he had vilely squandered, and which,\nif granted, he would consume upon his lust. What forbearance has\nGod! If He should deal with man according to his corrupt ways,\nwho could live in His sight? What if we had been less cautious and\ncarried the case of this man before God while he was practicing\niniquity, would the Lord have heard? would He have answered?\n\u201cFor Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither\nshall evil dwell with Thee. The foolish shall not stand in Thy sight:\nThou hatest all workers of iniquity.\u201d \u201cIf I regard iniquity in my heart,\nthe Lord will not hear me.\u201d\nThis is not a solitary case. Even the marriage relation was not\nsufficient to preserve this man from the corrupt habits of his youth. I\nwish I could be convinced that such cases as the one I have presented\nare rare, but I know they are frequent. Children born to parents\nwho are controlled by corrupt passions are worthless. What can be\nexpected of such children but that they will sink lower in the scale\nthan their parents? What can be expected of the rising generation?[352]\nThousands are devoid of principle. These very ones are transmitting\nto their offspring their own miserable, corrupt passions. What a\nlegacy! Thousands drag out their unprincipled lives, tainting their\nassociates, and perpetuating their debased passions by transmitting\nthem to their children. They take the responsibility of giving to them\nthe stamp of their own characters.\nI come again to Christians. If all who profess to obey the law of\nGod were free from iniquity, my soul would be relieved; but they\nare not. Even some who profess to keep all the commandments\nof God are guilty of the sin of adultery. What can I say to arouse\ntheir benumbed sensibilities? Moral principle, strictly carried out,\nbecomes the only safeguard of the soul. If ever there was a time\nMoral Pollution 315\nwhen the diet should be of the most simple kind, it is now. Meat\nshould not be placed before our children. Its influence is to excite\nand strengthen the lower passions, and has a tendency to deaden the\nmoral powers. Grains and fruits prepared free from grease, and in\nas natural a condition as possible, should be the food for the tables\nof all who claim to be preparing for translation to heaven. The\nless feverish the diet, the more easily can the passions be controlled.\nGratification of taste should not be consulted irrespective of physical,\nintellectual, or moral health.\nIndulgence of the baser passions will lead very many to shut\ntheir eyes to the light, for they fear that they will see sins which they\nare unwilling to forsake. All may see if they will. If they choose\ndarkness rather than light, their criminality will be none the less.\nWhy do not men and women read, and become intelligent upon\nthese things which so decidedly affect their physical, intellectual,\nand moral strength? God has given you a habitation to care for and\npreserve in the best condition for His service and glory. Your bodies\nare not your own. \u201cWhat? know ye not that your body is the temple [353]\nof the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are\nnot your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God\nin your body, and in your spirit, which are God\u2019s.\u201d \u201cKnow ye not\nthat ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in\nyou? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy;\nfor the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\u201d\n316 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nNumber Eighteen\u2014Testimony for the [354]\nChurch\nChapter 52\u2014Christian Temperance\n[Delivered in Battle Creek, March 6, 1869, and reported by U.\nSmith.]\n\u201cKnow ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost\nwhich is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?\nFor ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body,\nand in your spirit, which are God\u2019s.\u201d 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20.\nWe are not our own. We have been purchased with a dear price,\neven the sufferings and death of the Son of God. If we could under-\nstand this, and fully realize it, we would feel a great responsibility\nresting upon us to keep ourselves in the very best condition of health,\nthat we might render to God perfect service. But when we take any\ncourse which expends our vitality, decreases our strength, or be-\nclouds the intellect we sin against God. In pursuing this course we\nare not glorifying Him in our bodies and spirits which are His, but\nare committing a great wrong in His sight.\nHas Jesus given Himself for us? Has a dear price been paid to\nredeem us? And is it so, that we are not our own? Is it true that all\nthe powers of our being, our bodies, our spirits, all that we have, and\nall we are, belong to God? It certainly is. And when we realize this,\nwhat obligation does it lay us under to God to preserve ourselves in\nthat condition that we may honor Him upon the earth in our bodies\nand in our spirits which are His.\nWe believe without a doubt that Christ is soon coming. This is[355]\nnot a fable to us; it is a reality. We have no doubt, neither have we\nhad a doubt for years, that the doctrines we hold today are present\ntruth, and that we are nearing the judgment. We are preparing to\nmeet Him who, escorted by a retinue of holy angels, is to appear in\nthe clouds of heaven to give the faithful and the just the finishing\ntouch of immortality. When He comes He is not to cleanse us of our\nsins, to remove from us the defects in our characters, or to cure us\nof the infirmities of our tempers and dispositions. If wrought for us\nat all, this work will all be accomplished before that time. When\n318\nChristian Temperance 319\nthe Lord comes, those who are holy will be holy still. Those who\nhave preserved their bodies and spirits in holiness, in sanctification\nand honor, will then receive the finishing touch of immortality. But\nthose who are unjust, unsanctified, and filthy will remain so forever.\nNo work will then be done for them to remove their defects and give\nthem holy characters. The Refiner does not then sit to pursue His\nrefining process and remove their sins and their corruption. This is\nall to be done in these hours of probation. It is now that this work is\nto be accomplished for us.\nWe embrace the truth of God with our different faculties, and\nas we come under the influence of that truth, it will accomplish the\nwork for us which is necessary to give us a moral fitness for the\nkingdom of glory and for the society of the heavenly angels. We\nare now in God\u2019s workshop. Many of us are rough stones from the\nquarry. But as we lay hold upon the truth of God, its influence affects\nus. It elevates us and removes from us every imperfection and sin,\nof what ever nature. Thus we are prepared to see the King in His\nbeauty and finally to unite with the pure and heavenly angels in the\nkingdom of glory. It is here that this work is to be accomplished for [356]\nus, here that our bodies and spirits are to be fitted for immortality.\nWe are in a world that is opposed to righteousness and purity\nof character, and to a growth in grace. Wherever we look we see\ncorruption and defilement, deformity and sin. And what is the work\nthat we are to undertake here just previous to receiving immortality?\nIt is to preserve our bodies holy, our spirits pure, that we may stand\nforth unstained amid the corruptions teeming around us in these last\ndays. And if this work is accomplished we need to engage in it at\nonce, heartily and understandingly. Selfishness should not come in\nhere to influence us. The Spirit of God should have perfect control\nof us, influencing us in all our actions. If we have a right hold on\nHeaven, a right hold of the power that is from above, we shall feel\nthe sanctifying influence of the Spirit of God upon our hearts.\nWhen we have tried to present the health reform to our brethren\nand sisters, and have spoken to them of the importance of eating and\ndrinking and doing all that they do to the glory of God, many by their\nactions have said: \u201cIt is nobody\u2019s business whether I eat this or that.\nWhatever we do we are to bear the consequences ourselves.\u201d Dear\nfriends, you are greatly mistaken. You are not the only sufferers\n320 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nfrom a wrong course. The society you are in bears the consequences\nof your wrongs, in a great degree, as well as yourselves. If you suffer\nfrom your intemperance in eating or drinking, we that are around you\nor associated with you are also affected by your infirmities. We have\nto suffer on account of your wrong course. If it has an influence to\nlessen your powers of mind or body, we feel it when in your society,\nand are affected by it. If, instead of having a buoyancy of spirit, you\nare gloomy, you cast a shadow upon the spirits of all around you.\nIf we are sad and depressed, and in trouble, you could, if in a right\ncondition of health, have a clear brain to show us the way out and[357]\nspeak a comforting word to us. But if your brain is so benumbed by\nyour wrong course of living that you cannot give us the right counsel,\ndo we not meet with a loss? Does not your influence seriously affect\nus? We may have a good degree of confidence in our own judgment,\nyet we want to have counselors; for \u201cin the multitude of counselors\nthere is safety.\u201d We desire that our course should look consistent to\nthose we love, and we wish to seek their counsel and have them able\nto give it with a clear brain. But what care we for your judgment, if\nyour brain nerve power has been taxed to the utmost, and the vitality\nwithdrawn from the brain to take care of the improper food placed in\nyour stomachs, or of an enormous quantity of even healthful food?\nWhat care we for the judgment of such persons? They see through a\nmass of undigested food. Therefore your course of living affects us.\nIt is impossible for you to pursue any wrong course without causing\nothers to suffer.\n\u201cKnow ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one\nreceiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that\nstriveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it\nto obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore\nso run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the\nair: but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest\nthat by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should\nbe a castaway.\u201d Those who engaged in running the race to obtain\nthat laurel which was considered a special honor were temperate\nin all things so that their muscles, their brains, and every part of\nthem might be in the very best condition to run. If they were not\ntemperate in all things they would not have that elasticity that they\nChristian Temperance 321\nwould have if they were. If temperate, they could run that race more\nsuccessfully; they were more sure of receiving the crown.\nBut notwithstanding all their temperance,\u2014all their efforts to [358]\nsubject themselves to a careful diet in order to be in the best condi-\ntion,\u2014those who ran the earthly race only ran at a venture. They\nmight do the very best they could, and yet after all not receive the\ntoken of honor; for another might be a little in advance of them, and\ntake the prize. Only one received the prize. But in the heavenly\nrace we can all run and all receive the prize. There is no uncertainty,\nno risk, in the matter. We must put on the heavenly graces, and,\nwith the eye directed upward to the crown of immortality, keep the\nPattern ever before us. He was a man of sorrows and acquainted\nwith grief. The humble, self-denying life of our divine Lord we are\nto keep constantly in view. And then as we seek to imitate Him,\nkeeping our eye upon the mark of the prize, we can run this race\nwith certainty, knowing that if we do the very best we can, we shall\ncertainly secure the prize.\nMen would subject themselves to self-denial and discipline in\norder to run and obtain a corruptible crown, one that would perish in\na day, and which was only a token of honor from mortals here. But\nwe are to run the race, at the end of which is a crown of immortality\nand everlasting life. Yes, a far more exceeding and eternal weight of\nglory will be awarded to us as the prize when the race is run. \u201cWe,\u201d\nsays the apostle, \u201can incorruptible.\u201d And if those who engaged in this\nrace here upon the earth for a temporal crown could be temperate\nin all things, cannot we, who have in view an incorruptible crown,\nan eternal weight of glory, and a life which measures with the life\nof God? When we have this great inducement before us, cannot we\n\u201crun with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus\nthe Author and Finisher of our faith\u201d? He has pointed out the way\nfor us, and marked it all along by His own footsteps. It is the path [359]\nthat He traveled, and we may, with Him, experience the self-denial\nand the suffering, and walk in this pathway imprinted by His own\nblood.\n\u201cI therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one\nthat beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into\nsubjection.\u201d There is work here for every man, woman, and child\nto do. Satan is constantly seeking to gain control of your bodies\n322 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nand spirits. But Christ has bought you, and you are His property.\nAnd now it is for you to work in union with Christ, in union with\nthe holy angels that minister unto you. It is for you to keep the\nbody under and bring it into subjection. Unless you do this you will\ncertainly lose everlasting life and the crown of immortality. And yet\nsome will say: \u201cWhat business is it to anybody what I eat or what I\ndrink?\u201d I have shown you what relation your course has to others.\nYou have seen that it has much to do with the influence you exert in\nyour families. It has much to do with molding the characters of your\nchildren.\nAs I said before, we live in a corrupt age. It is a time when Satan\nseems to have almost perfect control over minds that are not fully\nconsecrated to God. Therefore there is a very great responsibility\nresting upon parents and guardians who have children to bring up.\nParents have taken the responsibility of bringing these children into\nexistence; and now what is their duty? Is it to let them come up\njust as they may, and just as they will? Let me tell you, a weighty\nresponsibility rests upon these parents. \u201cWhether therefore ye eat,\nor drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\u201d Do you\ndo this when you prepare food for your tables and call your family\nto partake of it? Are you placing before your children only the food\nthat you know will make the very best blood? Is it that food that\nwill preserve their systems in the least feverish condition? Is it that\nwhich will place them in the very best relation to life and health? Is[360]\nthis the food that you are studying to place before your children? Or\ndo you, regardless of their future good, provide for them unhealthful,\nstimulating, irritating food?\nLet me tell you that children are born to evil. Satan seems to have\ncontrol of them. He takes possession of their young minds, and they\nare corrupted. Why do fathers and mothers act as though a lethargy\nwere upon them? They do not mistrust that Satan is sowing evil\nseed in their families. They are as blind and careless and reckless\nin regard to these things as it is possible for them to be. Why do\nthey not awake, and read and study upon these subjects? Says the\napostle: \u201cAdd to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to\nknowledge temperance; and to temperance patience,\u201d etc. Here is a\nwork which rests upon every one who professes to follow Christ; it\nis to live upon the plan of addition.\nChristian Temperance 323\nChapter after chapter has been opened to me. I can select family\nafter family of children in this house, every one of whom is as\ncorrupt as hell itself. Some of them profess to be followers of Christ,\nand you, their parents, are as indifferent as though you had had a\nshock of paralysis.\nI have said that some of you are selfish. You have not understood\nwhat I have meant. You have studied what food would taste best.\nTaste and pleasure, instead of the glory of God, and a desire to\nadvance in the divine life, and to perfect holiness in the fear of\nGod, have ruled. You have consulted your own pleasure, your own\nappetite; and while you have been doing this, Satan has been gaining\na march upon you and, as is generally the case, has frustrated your\nefforts every time.\nSome of you fathers have taken your children to the physician\nto see what was the matter with them. I could have told you in two\nminutes what was the trouble. Your children are corrupt. Satan has [361]\nobtained control of them. He has come right in past you, while you,\nwho are as God to them, to guard them, were at ease, stupefied, and\nasleep. God has commanded you to bring them up in the fear and\nnurture of the Lord. But Satan has passed right in before you and\nhas woven strong bands around them. And yet you sleep on. May\nHeaven pity you and your children, for every one of you needs His\npity.\nHad you taken your position upon the health reform; had you\nadded to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge\ntemperance, things might have been different. But you have been\nonly partially aroused by the iniquity and corruption that is in your\nhouses. You have opened your eyes a little and then composed\nyourself to sleep again. Do you think angels can come into your\ndwellings? Do you think your children are susceptible of holy\ninfluences with these things among you? I can count family after\nfamily that are almost entirely under the control of Satan. I know\nthese things are true, and I want the people to arouse before it shall\nbe eternally too late, and the blood of souls, even the blood of the\nsouls of their own children, be found upon their garments.\nThe minds of some of these children are so weakened that they\nhave but one half or one third of the brilliancy of intellect that they\nmight have had had they been virtuous and pure. They have thrown it\n324 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\naway in self-abuse. Right here in this church, corruption is teeming\non every hand. Now and then there is a sing, or some gathering for\npleasure. Every time I hear of these, I feel like clothing myself in\nsackcloth. \u201cOh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain\nof tears!\u201d \u201cSpare Thy people, O Lord.\u201d I feel distressed. I have an\nagony of soul that is beyond anything that I can describe to you.\nYou are asleep. Would the lightning and thunder of Sinai arouse this[362]\nchurch? Would they arouse you, fathers and mothers, to commence\nthe work of reformation in your own houses? You should be teaching\nyour children. You should be instructing them how to shun the vices\nand corruptions of this age. Instead of this, many are studying how\nto get something good to eat. You place upon your tables butter,\neggs, and meat, and your children partake of them. They are fed\nwith the very things that will excite their animal passions, and then\nyou come to meeting and ask God to bless and save your children.\nHow high do your prayers go? You have a work to do first. When\nyou have done all for your children which God has left for you to\ndo then you can with confidence claim the special help that God has\npromised to give you.\nYou should study temperance in all things. You must study it\nin what you eat and in what you drink. And yet you say: \u201cIt is\nnobody\u2019s business what I eat, or what I drink, or what I place upon\nmy table.\u201d It is somebody\u2019s business, unless you take your children\nand shut them up, or go into the wilderness where you will not be\na burden upon others, and where your unruly, vicious children will\nnot corrupt the society in which they mingle.\nMany who have adopted the health reform have left off every-\nthing hurtful, but does it follow that because they have left off these\nthings they can eat just as much as they please? They sit down to\nthe table, and instead of considering how much they should eat, they\ngive themselves up to appetite and eat to great excess. And the\nstomach has all it can do, or all it should do, the rest of that day, to\nworry away with the burden imposed upon it. All the food that is\nput into the stomach, from which the system cannot derive benefit,\nis a burden to nature in her work. It hinders the living machine. The\nsystem is clogged and cannot successfully carry on its work. The[363]\nvital organs are unnecessarily taxed, and the brain nerve power is\nChristian Temperance 325\ncalled to the stomach to help the digestive organs carry on their work\nof disposing of an amount of food which does the system no good.\nThus the power of the brain is lessened by drawing so heavily\nupon it to help the stomach get along with its heavy burden. And\nafter it has accomplished the task, what are the sensations experi-\nenced as the result of this unnecessary expenditure of vital force?\nA feeling of goneness, a faintness, as though you must eat more.\nPerhaps this feeling comes just before mealtime. What is the cause\nof this? Nature has worried along with her work and is so thoroughly\nexhausted in consequence that you have this sensation of goneness.\nAnd you think that the stomach says, \u201cMore food,\u201d when, in its\nfaintness, it is distinctly saying, \u201cGive me rest.\u201d\nThe stomach needs rest to gather up its exhausted energies for\nanother work. But, instead of allowing it any period of rest, you\nthink it needs more food, and so heap another load upon nature, and\nrefuse it the needed rest. It is like a man laboring in the field all\nthrough the early part of the day until he is weary. He comes in at\nnoon and says that he is weary and exhausted, but you tell him to go\nto work again and he will obtain relief. This is the way you treat the\nstomach. It is thoroughly exhausted. But instead of letting it rest,\nyou give it more food, and then call the vitality from other parts of\nthe system to the stomach to assist in the work of digestion.\nMany of you have at times felt a numbness around the brain.\nYou have felt disinclined to take hold of any labor which required\neither mental or physical exertion, until you have rested from the\nsense of this burden imposed upon your system. Then, again, there\nis this sense of goneness. But you say it is more food that is wanted,\nand place a double load upon the stomach for it to care for. Even if [364]\nyou are strict in the quality of your food, do you glorify God in your\nbodies and spirits, which are His, by partaking of such a quantity of\nfood? Those who place so much food upon the stomach, and thus\nload down nature, could not appreciate the truth should they hear it\ndwelt upon. They could not arouse the benumbed sensibilities of the\nbrain to realize the value of the atonement and the great sacrifice that\nhas been made for fallen man. It is impossible for such to appreciate\nthe great, the precious, and the exceedingly rich reward that is in\nreserve for the faithful overcomers. The animal part of our nature\nshould never be left to govern the moral and intellectual.\n326 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nAnd what influence does overeating have upon the stomach? It\nbecomes debilitated, the digestive organs are weakened, and disease,\nwith all its train of evils, is brought on as the result. If persons\nwere diseased before, they thus increase the difficulties upon them\nand lessen their vitality every day they live. They call their vital\npowers into unnecessary action to take care of the food that they\nplace in their stomachs. What a terrible condition is this to be in!\nWe know something of dyspepsia by experience. We have had it\nin our family, and we feel that it is a disease much to be dreaded.\nWhen a person becomes a thorough dyspeptic, he is a great sufferer,\nmentally and physically; and his friends must also suffer, unless they\nare as unfeeling as brutes. And yet will you say: \u201cIt is none of your\nbusiness what I eat or what course I pursue\u201d? Does anybody around\ndyspeptics suffer? Just take a course that will irritate them in any\nway. How natural to be fretful! They feel bad, and it appears to them\nthat their children are very bad. They cannot speak calmly to them,\nnor, without especial grace, act calmly in their families. All around\nthem are affected by the disease upon them; all have to suffer the\nconsequences of their infirmity. They cast a dark shadow. Then, do[365]\nnot your habits of eating and drinking affect others? They certainly\ndo. And you should be very careful to preserve yourself in the best\ncondition of health that you may render to God perfect service and\ndo your duty in society and to your family.\nBut even health reformers can err in the quantity of food. They\ncan eat immoderately of a healthy quality of food. Some in this\nhouse err in the quality. They have never taken their position upon\nhealth reform. They have chosen to eat and drink what they pleased\nand when they pleased. They are injuring their systems in this way.\nNot only this, but they are injuring their families by placing upon\ntheir tables a feverish diet which will increase the animal passions\nof their children and lead them to care but little for heavenly things.\nThe parents are thus strengthening the animal, and lessening the\nspiritual, powers of their children. What a heavy penalty will they\nhave to pay in the end! And then they wonder that their children are\nso weak morally!\nParents have not given their children the right education. Fre-\nquently they manifest the same imperfections which are seen in the\nchildren. They eat improperly, and this calls their nervous energies\nChristian Temperance 327\nto the stomach, and they have no vitality to expend in other direc-\ntions. They cannot properly control their children because of their\nown impatience, neither can they teach them the right way. Perhaps\nthey take hold of them roughly and give them an impatient blow.\nI have said that to shake a child would shake two evil spirits in,\nwhile it would shake one out. If a child is wrong, to shake it only\nmakes it worse. It will not subdue it. When the system is not in a\nright condition, when the circulation is broken up, and the nervous\npower has all that it can do to take care of a bad quality of food,\nor too great a quantity even of that which is good, parents have not\nself-command. They cannot reason from cause to effect. Here is the [366]\nreason why\u2014in every move they make in their families they create\nmore trouble than they cure. They do not seem to understand and\nreason from cause to effect, and they go to work like blind men.\nThey seem to act as though it would especially glorify God for them\nto move like wild men, and if anything wrong should occur in their\nfamilies, to put it down with roughness and violence.\nWho are our children? They are only our younger brothers and\nsisters in the family that God acknowledges as His. We are dealing\nwith the members of the Lord\u2019s family. And while the care of them\nis committed to us, how careful should we be that we bring them\nup for the Lord, so that when the Master comes we can say: \u201cHere,\nLord, are we, and the children that Thou hast given us.\u201d Shall we\nthen be able to say: We have tried to do our work, and we have tried\nto do it well\u201d?\nI have seen mothers of large families, who could not see the work\nthat lay right in their pathway, just before them in their own families.\nThey wanted to be missionaries and do some great work. They were\nlooking out for themselves some high position, but neglecting to\ntake care of the very work at home which the Lord had left for them\nto do. How important that the brain be clear! How important that\nthe body be as free as possible from disease, in order that we may do\nthe work which Heaven has left for us to do, and perform it in such a\nmanner that the Master can say: \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful\nservant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee\nruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d My\nsisters, do not despise the few things which the Lord has left for\nyou to do. Let each day\u2019s actions be such that in the day of final\n328 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nsettlement of accounts you will not be ashamed to meet the record\nmade by the recording angel.\nBut what about an impoverished diet? I have spoken of the[367]\nimportance of the quantity and quality of food being in strict accor-\ndance with the laws of health. But we would not recommend an\nimpoverished diet. I have been shown that many take a wrong view\nof the health reform and adopt too poor a diet. They subsist upon a\ncheap, poor quality of food, prepared without care or reference to\nthe nourishment of the system. It is important that the food should\nbe prepared with care, that the appetite, when not perverted, can\nrelish it. Because we from principle discard the use of meat, butter,\nmince pies, spices, lard, and that which irritates the stomach and\ndestroys health, the idea should never be given that it is of but little\nconsequence what we eat.\nThere are some who go to extremes. They must eat just such an\namount and just such a quality, and confine themselves to two or\nthree things. They allow only a few things to be placed before them\nor their families to eat. In eating a small amount of food, and that\nnot of the best quality, they do not take into the stomach that which\nwill suitably nourish the system. Poor food cannot be converted\ninto good blood. An impoverished diet will impoverish the blood.\nI will mention the case of Sister A. That case was presented to\nme to show an extreme. Two classes were presented before me:\nFirst, those who were not living up to the light which God had given\nthem. They started in the reform because somebody else did. They\ndid not understand the system for themselves. There are many of\nyou who profess the truth, who have received it because somebody\nelse did, and for your life you could not give the reason. This is\nwhy you are as weak as water. Instead of weighing your motives in\nthe light of eternity, instead of having a practical knowledge of the\nprinciples underlying all your actions, instead of having dug down\nto the bottom and built upon a right foundation for yourself, you\nare walking in the sparks kindled by somebody else. And you will[368]\nfail in this, as you have failed in the health reform. Now, if you had\nmoved from principle you would not have done this.\nSome cannot be impressed with the necessity of eating and drink-\ning to the glory of God. The indulgence of appetite affects them\nin all the relations of life. It is seen in their family, in their church,\nChristian Temperance 329\nin the prayer meeting, and in the conduct of their children. It has\nbeen the curse of their lives. You cannot make them understand\nthe truths for these last days. God has bountifully provided for the\nsustenance and happiness of all His creatures; and if His laws were\nnever violated, and all acted in harmony with the divine will, health,\npeace, and happiness, instead of misery and continual evil, would\nbe experienced.\nAnother class who have taken hold of the health reform are very\nsevere. They take a position, and stand stubbornly in that position,\nand carry nearly everything over the mark. Sister A was one of\nthese. She was not sympathizing, loving, and affectionate like our\ndivine Lord. Justice was nearly all she could see. She carried matters\nfurther than Dr. Trall. Her patients had to even leave her because\nthey could not get enough to eat. Her impoverished diet gave her\nimpoverished blood.\nFlesh meats will depreciate the blood. Cook meat with spices,\nand eat it with rich cakes and pies, and you have a bad quality of\nblood. The system is too heavily taxed in disposing of this kind of\nfood. The mince pies and the pickles, which should never find a\nplace in any human stomach, will give a miserable quality of blood.\nAnd a poor quality of food, cooked in an improper manner, and\ninsufficient in quantity, cannot make good blood. Flesh meats and\nrich food, and an impoverished diet, will produce the same results.\nNow in regard to milk and sugar: I know of persons who have\nbecome frightened at the health reform, and said they would have [369]\nnothing to do with it, because it has spoken against a free use of\nthese things. Changes should be made with great care, and we\nshould move cautiously and wisely. We want to take that course\nwhich will recommend itself to the intelligent men and women of the\nland. Large quantities of milk and sugar eaten together are injurious.\nThey impart impurities to the system. Animals from which milk\nis obtained are not always healthy. They may be diseased. A cow\nmay be apparently well in the morning, and die before night. Then\nshe was diseased in the morning, and her milk was diseased; but\nyou did not know it. The animal creation is diseased. Flesh meats\nare diseased. Could we know that animals were in perfect health,\nI would recommend that people eat flesh meats sooner than large\nquantities of milk and sugar. It would not do the injury that milk\n330 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nand sugar do. Sugar clogs the system. It hinders the working of the\nliving machine.\nThere was one case in Montcalm County, Michigan, to which I\nwill refer. The individual was a noble man. He stood six feet and\nwas of fine appearance. I was called to visit him in his sickness. I\nhad previously conversed with him in regard to his manner of living.\n\u201cI do not like the looks of your eyes,\u201d said I. He was eating large\nquantities of sugar. I asked him why he did this. He said that he\nhad left off meat, and did not know what would supply its place as\nwell as sugar. His food did not satisfy him, simply because his wife\ndid not know how to cook. Some of you send your daughters, who\nhave nearly grown to womanhood, to school to learn the sciences\nbefore they know how to cook, when this should be made of the\nfirst importance. Here was a woman who did not know how to\ncook; she had not learned how to prepare healthful food. The wife\nand mother was deficient in this important branch of education;\nand as the result, poorly cooked food not being sufficient to sustain\nthe demands of the system, sugar was eaten immoderately, which[370]\nbrought on a diseased condition of the entire system. This man\u2019s life\nwas sacrificed unnecessarily to bad cooking. When I went to see the\nsick man I tried to tell them as well as I could how to manage, and\nsoon he began slowly to improve. But he imprudently exercised his\nstrength when not able, ate a small amount not of the right quality,\nand was taken down again. This time there was no help for him. His\nsystem appeared to be a living mass of corruption. He died a victim\nto poor cooking. He tried to make sugar supply the place of good\ncooking, and it only made matters worse.\nI frequently sit down to the tables of the brethren and sisters, and\nsee that they use a great amount of milk and sugar. These clog the\nsystem, irritate the digestive organs, and affect the brain. Anything\nthat hinders the active motion of the living machinery affects the\nbrain very directly. And from the light given me, sugar, when\nlargely used, is more injurious than meat. These changes should be\nmade cautiously, and the subject should be treated in a manner not\ncalculated to disgust and prejudice those whom we would teach and\nhelp.\nOur sisters often do not know how to cook. To such I would say:\nI would go to the very best cook that could be found in the country,\nChristian Temperance 331\nand remain there if necessary for weeks, until I had become mistress\nof the art, an intelligent, skillful cook. I would pursue this course if\nI were forty years old. It is your duty to know how to cook, and it is\nyour duty to teach your daughters to cook. When you are teaching\nthem the art of cookery you are building around them a barrier that\nwill preserve them from the folly and vice which they may otherwise\nbe tempted to engage in. I prize my seamstress, I value my copyist;\nbut my cook, who knows well how to prepare the food to sustain life\nand nourish brain, bone, and muscle, fills the most important place\namong the helpers in my family.\nMothers, there is nothing that leads to such evils as to lift the [371]\nburdens from your daughters, and give them nothing special to do,\nand let them choose their own employment, perhaps a little crochet\nor some other fancywork to busy themselves. Let them have exercise\nof the limbs and muscles. If it wearies them, what then? Are you\nnot wearied in your work? Will weariness hurt your children, unless\noverworked, more than it hurts you? No, indeed. They can recover\nfrom their weariness in a good night\u2019s rest and be prepared to engage\nin labor the next day. It is a sin to let them grow up in idleness. The\nsin and ruin of Sodom was abundance of bread and idleness.\nWe want to work from the right standpoint. We want to act like\nmen and women that are to be brought into judgment. And when we\nadopt the health reform we should adopt it from a sense of duty, not\nbecause somebody else has adopted it. I have not changed my course\na particle since I adopted the health reform. I have not taken one step\nback since the light from heaven upon this subject first shone upon\nmy pathway. I broke away from everything at once,\u2014from meat and\nbutter, and from three meals,\u2014and that while engaged in exhaustive\nbrain labor, writing from early morning till sundown. I came down\nto two meals a day without changing my labor. I have been a great\nsufferer from disease, having had five shocks of paralysis. I have\nbeen with my left arm bound to my side for months because the pain\nin my heart was so great. When making these changes in my diet, I\nrefused to yield to taste and let that govern me. Shall that stand in the\nway of my securing greater strength, that I may therewith glorify my\nLord? Shall that stand in my way for a moment? Never! I suffered\nkeen hunger. I was a great meat eater. But when faint, I placed my\narms across my stomach and said: \u201cI will not taste a morsel. I will\n332 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\neat simple food, or I will not eat at all.\u201d Bread was distasteful to[372]\nme. I could seldom eat a piece as large as a dollar. Some things in\nthe reform I could get along with very well, but when I came to the\nbread I was especially set against it. When I made these changes I\nhad a special battle to fight. The first two or three meals, I could not\neat. I said to my stomach: \u201cYou may wait until you can eat bread.\u201d\nIn a little while I could eat bread, and graham bread, too. This I\ncould not eat before; but now it tastes good, and I have had no loss\nof appetite.\nWhen writing Spiritual Gifts, volumes three and four, I would\nbecome exhausted by excessive labor. I then saw that I must change\nmy course of life, and by resting a few days I came out all right\nagain. I left off these things from principle. I took my stand on\nhealth reform from principle. And since that time, brethren, you\nhave not heard me advance an extreme view of health reform that I\nhave had to take back. I have advanced nothing but what I stand to\ntoday. I recommend to you a healthful, nourishing diet.\nI do not regard it a great privation to discontinue the use of those\nthings which leave a bad smell in the breath and a bad taste in the\nmouth. Is it self-denial to leave these things and get into a condition\nwhere everything is as sweet as honey; where no bad taste is left in\nthe mouth and no feeling of goneness in the stomach? These I used\nto have much of the time. I have fainted away with my child in my\narms again and again. I have none of this now, and shall I call this\na privation when I can stand before you as I do this day? There is\nnot one woman in a hundred that could endure the amount of labor\nthat I do. I moved out from principle, not from impulse. I moved\nbecause I believed Heaven would approve of the course I was taking\nto bring myself into the very best condition of health, that I might\nglorify God in my body and spirit, which are His.\nWe can have a variety of good, wholesome food, cooked in a[373]\nhealthful manner, so that it can be made palatable to all. And if you,\nmy sisters, do not know how to cook, I advise you to learn. It is\nof vital importance to you to know how to cook. There are more\nsouls lost from poor cooking than you have any idea of. It produces\nsickness, disease, and bad tempers; the system becomes deranged,\nand heavenly things cannot be discerned. There is more religion in a\nloaf of good bread than many of you think. There is more religion in\nChristian Temperance 333\ngood cooking than you have any idea of. We want you to learn what\ngood religion is, and to carry it out in your families. When I have\nbeen from home sometimes, I have known that the bread upon the\ntable, and the food generally, would hurt me; but I would be obliged\nto eat a little to sustain life. It is a sin in the sight of Heaven to have\nsuch food. I have suffered for want of proper food. For a dyspeptic\nstomach, you may place upon your tables fruits of different kinds,\nbut not too many at one meal. In this way you may have a variety,\nand it will taste good, and after you have eaten your meals you will\nfeel well.\nI am astonished to learn that, after all the light that has been\ngiven in this place, many of you eat between meals! You should\nnever let a morsel pass your lips between your regular meals. Eat\nwhat you ought, but eat it at one meal, and then wait until the next.\nI eat enough to satisfy the wants of nature; but when I get up from\nthe table, my appetite is just as good as when I sat down. And\nwhen the next meal comes, I am ready to take my portion, and no\nmore. Should I eat a double amount now and then, because it tastes\ngood, how could I bow down and ask God to help me in my work\nof writing, when I could not get an idea on account of my gluttony?\nCould I ask God to take care of that unreasonable load upon my\nstomach? That would be dishonoring Him. That would be asking\nto consume upon my lust. Now I eat just what I think is right, and [374]\nthen I can ask Him to give me strength to perform the work that He\nhas given me to do. And I have known that Heaven has heard and\nanswered my prayer when I have offered this petition.\nAgain, when we eat immoderately, we sin against our own bod-\nies. Upon the Sabbath, in the house of God, gluttons will sit and\nsleep under the burning truths of God\u2019s word. They can neither keep\ntheir eyes open, nor comprehend the solemn discourses given. Do\nyou think that such are glorifying God in their bodies and spirits,\nwhich are His? No; they dishonor Him. And the dyspeptic\u2014what\nhas made him dyspeptic is taking this course. Instead of observing\nregularity, he has let appetite control him, and has eaten between\nmeals. Perhaps, if his habits are sedentary, he has not had the vital-\nizing air of heaven to help in the work of digestion; he may not have\nhad sufficient exercise for his health.\n334 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nSome of you feel as though you would like to have somebody\ntell you how much to eat. This is not the way it should be. We are to\nact from a moral and religious standpoint. We are to be temperate\nin all things, because an incorruptible crown, a heavenly treasure,\nis before us. And now I wish to say to my brethren and sisters, I\nwould have moral courage to take my position and to govern myself.\nI would not want to put that on someone else. You eat too much, and\nthen you are sorry, and so you keep thinking upon what you eat and\ndrink. Just eat that which is for the best, and go right away, feeling\nclear in the sight of Heaven, and not having remorse of conscience.\nWe do not believe in removing temptations entirely away from either\nchildren or grown persons. We all have a warfare before us and must\nstand in a position to resist the temptations of Satan, and we want to\nknow that we possess the power in ourselves to do this.\nAnd while we would caution you not to overeat, even of the best[375]\nquality of food, we would also caution those that are extremists not\nto raise a false standard and then endeavor to bring everybody to it.\nThere are some who are starting out as health reformers who are not\nfit to engage in any other enterprise, and who have not sense enough\nto take care of their own families, or keep their proper place in the\nchurch. And what do they do? Why, they fall back as health reform\nphysicians, as though they could make that a success. They assume\nthe responsibilities of their practice, and take the lives of men and\nwomen into their hands, when they really know nothing about the\nbusiness.\nMy voice shall be raised against novices undertaking to treat\ndisease professedly according to the principles of health reform.\nGod forbid that we should be the subjects for them to experiment\nupon! We are too few. It is altogether too inglorious a warfare for us\nto die in. God deliver us from such danger! We do not need such\nteachers and physicians. Let those try to treat disease who know\nsomething about the human system. The heavenly Physician was\nfull of compassion. This spirit is needed by those who deal with\nthe sick. Some who undertake to become physicians are bigoted,\nselfish, and mulish. You cannot teach them anything. It may be they\nhave never done anything worth doing. They may not have made life\na success. They know nothing really worth knowing, and yet they\nChristian Temperance 335\nhave started up to practice the health reform. We cannot afford to let\nsuch persons kill off this one and that one. No; we cannot afford it!\nWe want to be just right every time. We want to bring our people\nup to the right position on the health reform. \u201cLet us,\u201d says the\napostle, \u201ccleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,\nperfecting holiness in the fear of God.\u201d We must be right in order\nto stand in the last days. We need clear brains and sound minds in\nsound bodies. We should begin to work in earnest for our children, [376]\nfor every member of our families. Shall we take hold and work from\nthe right standpoint? Jesus is coming; and if we pursue a course to\nblind ourselves to the soul-elevating truths of these last days, how\ncan we be sanctified through the truth? How can we be prepared for\nimmortality? May the Lord help us that we may commence to work\nhere as never before.\nWe have spoken of having a series of meetings in this place,\nand of taking hold to labor for the people. But we dare not put our\narms under to lift you. We want you to commence this work of\nreformation in your own houses. We want those that have been in\nthe background to come up. You must begin to work. And when\nwe see that you have commenced to labor for yourselves, we will\ncome in and lift. We hope to reform your children, that they may be\nconverted to Christ, and that the spirit of reformation may spread\nall through your midst. But when you appear twice dead, and ready\nto be plucked up by the roots, we dare not undertake the work. We\nwould rather go to an unbelieving congregation where there are\nhearts to receive the truth. The burden of the truth is upon us. There\nare enough to hear the truth; and we long to be where we can speak\nit to them. Will you help us by going to work for yourselves?\nMay the Lord help you to feel as you never felt before. May\nHe help you to die to self, and get the spirit of reformation in your\nhomes, that the angels of God may come into your midst to minister\nunto you, and that you may be fitted for translation to heaven.\nChapter 53\u2014Extremes in Health Reform[377]\nAt the time of the yearly conference at Adams Center, New York,\nOctober 25, 1868, I was shown that the brethren in ----- were in\ngreat perplexity and distress because of the course pursued by B\nand C. Those who have the cause of God at heart cannot but feel\njealous for its prosperity. I was shown that these men were not\nreliable. They were extremists and would run the health reform into\nthe ground. They were not pursuing a course which would tend to\ncorrect or reform those who were intemperate in their diet; but their\ninfluence would disgust believers and unbelievers, and would drive\nthem further from reform, instead of bringing them nearer to it.\nOur views differ widely from those of the world in general.\nThey are not popular. The masses will reject any theory, however\nreasonable it may be, if it lays a restriction upon the appetite. The\ntaste is consulted instead of reason and health. All who leave the\ncommon track of custom, and advocate reform, will be opposed,\naccounted mad, insane, radical, let them pursue ever so consistent\na course. But when men who advocate reform carry the matter to\nextremes, and are inconsistent in their course of action, people are\nnot to blame if they do become disgusted with the health reform.\nThese extremists do more injury in a few months than they can undo\nin their whole lives. By them the entire theory of our faith is brought\ninto disrepute, and they can never bring those who witness such\nexhibitions of so-called health reform to think that there is anything\ngood in it. These men are doing a work which Satan loves to see go\non.\nThose who advocate unpopular truth should be most consistent\nin their lives, and should be extremely careful to shun everything\nlike extremes. They should not labor to see how far they can take\ntheir position from other men; but, otherwise, to see how near they[378]\ncan come to those whom they wish to reform, that they may help\nthem to the position which they themselves so highly prize. If they\nfeel thus, they will pursue a course which will recommend the truth\n336\nExtremes in Health Reform 337\nthey advocate to the good judgment of candid, sensible men and\nwomen. These will be compelled to acknowledge that there is a\nconsistency in the subject of health reform.\nI was shown the course of B in his own family. He has been\nsevere and overbearing. He adopted the health reform as advocated\nby Brother C, and, like him, took extreme views of the subject; and\nnot having a well-balanced mind, he has made terrible blunders,\nthe results of which time will not efface. Aided by items gathered\nfrom books, he commenced to carry out the theory he had heard\nadvocated by Brother C, and, like him, made a point of bringing all\nup to the standard he had erected. He brought his own family to his\nrigid rules, but failed to control his own animal propensities. He\nfailed to bring himself to the mark, and to keep his body under. If\nhe had had a correct knowledge of the system of health reform he\nwould have known that his wife was not in a condition to give birth\nto healthy children. His own unsubdued passions had borne sway\nwithout reasoning from cause to effect.\nBefore the birth of his children he did not treat his wife as a\nwoman in her condition should be treated. He carried out his rigid\nrules for her, according to Brother C\u2019s ideas, which proved a great\ninjury to her. He did not provide the quality and quantity of food that\nwas necessary to nourish two lives instead of one. Another life was\ndependent upon her, and her system did not receive the nutritious,\nwholesome food necessary to sustain her strength. There was a lack\nin the quantity and in the quality. Her system required changes, a\nvariety and quality of food that was more nourishing. Her children\nwere born with feeble digestive powers and impoverished blood.\nFrom the food the mother was compelled to receive, she could not [379]\nfurnish a good quality of blood, and therefore gave birth to children\nfilled with humors.\nThe course pursued by the husband, the father of these children,\ndeserves the severest censure. His wife suffered for want of whole-\nsome, nutritious food. She did not have sufficient food or clothing\nto make her comfortable. She has borne a burden which has been\ngalling to bear. He became God, conscience, and will to her. There\nare natures which will rebel against this assumed authority. They\nwill not submit to such surveillance. They become weary of the\npressure and rise above it. But it was not so in this case. She has\n338 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nendured his being conscience for her and tried to feel that it was for\nthe best. But outraged nature could not be so easily subdued. Her\ndemands were earnest. The cravings of nature for something more\nnourishing led her to use entreaty, but without effect. Her wants\nwere few, but they were not considered. Two children have been\nsacrificed to his blind errors and ignorant bigotry. Should men of\nintelligent minds treat dumb animals as he has treated his wife in\nregard to food, the community would take the matter into their own\nhands and bring them to justice.\nIn the first place, B should not have committed so great a crime\nas to bring into being children that reason must teach him would\nbe diseased because they must receive a miserable legacy from\ntheir parents. They must have a bad inheritance transmitted to them.\nTheir blood must be filled with scrofulous humors from both parents,\nespecially the father, whose habits have been such as to corrupt the\nblood and enervate his whole system. Not only must these poor\nchildren receive a scrofulous tendency in a double sense, but what\nis worse, they will bear the mental and moral deficiencies of the\nfather, and the lack of noble independence, moral courage, and\nforce in the mother. The world is already cursed by the increase of\npersons of this stamp, who must fall lower in the scale of physical,\nmental, and moral strength than their parents; for their condition[380]\nand surroundings are not even as favorable as were those of their\nparents.\nB is not capable of taking care of a family. He cannot sustain\none as it ought to be sustained, and should never have had one. His\nmarriage was all a mistake. He has made a life of misery for his\nwife, and has accumulated misery by having children born to them.\nSome of them exist, and that is about all.\nThose professing to be Christians should not enter the marriage\nrelation until the matter has been carefully and prayerfully consid-\nered from an elevated standpoint to see if God can be glorified by the\nunion. Then they should duly consider the result of every privilege\nof the marriage relation, and sanctified principle should be the basis\nof every action. Before increasing their family, they should take into\nconsideration whether God would be glorified or dishonored by their\nbringing children into the world. They should seek to glorify God by\ntheir union from the first, and during every year of their married life.\nExtremes in Health Reform 339\nThey should calmly consider what provision can be made for their\nchildren. They have no right to bring children into the world to be a\nburden to others. Have they a business that they can rely upon to sus-\ntain a family so that they need not become a burden to others? If they\nhave not, they commit a crime in bringing children into the world\nto suffer for want of proper care, food, and clothing. In this fast,\ncorrupt age these things are not considered. Lustful passion bears\nsway and will not submit to control, although feebleness, misery,\nand death are the result of its reign. Women are forced to a life of\nhardship, pain, and suffering because of the uncontrollable passions\nof men who bear the name of husband\u2014more rightly could they be\ncalled brutes. Mothers drag out a miserable existence, with children\nin their arms nearly all the time, managing every way to put bread [381]\ninto their mouths and clothes upon their backs. Such accumulated\nmisery fills the world.\nThere is but little real, genuine, devoted, pure love. This precious\narticle is very rare. Passion is termed love. Many a woman has\nhad her fine and tender sensibilities outraged, because the marriage\nrelation allowed him whom she called husband to be brutal in his\ntreatment of her. His love she found to be of so base a quality that\nshe became disgusted.\nVery many families are living in a most unhappy state because\nthe husband and father allows the animal in his nature to predominate\nover the intellectual and moral. The result is that a sense of languor\nand depression is frequently felt, but the cause is seldom divined\nas being the result of their own improper course of action. We are\nunder solemn obligations to God to keep the spirit pure and the body\nhealthy, that we may be a benefit to humanity, and render to God\nperfect service. The apostle utters these words of warning: \u201cLet not\nsin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in\nthe lusts thereof.\u201d He urges us onward by telling us that \u201cevery man\nthat striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.\u201d He exhorts\nall who call themselves Christians to present their bodies\u201d a living\nsacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.\u201d He says: \u201cI keep under my\nbody, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I\nhave preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.\u201d\nIt is an error generally committed to make no difference in the life\nof a woman previous to the birth of her children. At this important\n340 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nperiod the labor of the mother should be lightened. Great changes\nare going on in her system. It requires a greater amount of blood,\nand therefore an increase of food of the most nourishing quality to\nconvert into blood. Unless she has an abundant supply of nutritious\nfood, she cannot retain her physical strength, and her offspring is[382]\nrobbed of vitality. Her clothing also demands attention. Care should\nbe taken to protect the body from a sense of chilliness. She should\nnot call vitality unnecessarily to the surface to supply the want of\nsufficient clothing. If the mother is deprived of an abundance of\nwholesome, nutritious food, she will lack in the quantity and quality\nof blood. Her circulation will be poor, and her child will lack in\nthe very same things. There will be an inability in the offspring to\nappropriate food which it can convert into good blood to nourish\nthe system. The prosperity of mother and child depends much upon\ngood, warm clothing and a supply of nourishing food. The extra\ndraft upon the vitality of the mother must be considered and provided\nfor.\nBut, on the other hand, the idea that women, because of their\nspecial condition, may let the appetite run riot, is a mistake based\non custom, but not on sound sense. The appetite of women in this\ncondition may be variable, fitful, and difficult to gratify; and custom\nallows her to have anything she may fancy, without consulting reason\nas to whether such food can supply nutrition for her body and for the\ngrowth of her child. The food should be nutritious, but should not\nbe of an exciting quality. Custom says that if she wants flesh meats,\npickles, spiced food, or mince pies, let her have them; appetite alone\nis to be consulted. This is a great mistake, and does much harm. The\nharm cannot be estimated. If ever there is need of simplicity of diet\nand special care as to the quality of food eaten, it is in this important\nperiod.\nWomen who possess principle, and who are well instructed, will\nnot depart from simplicity of diet at this time of all others. They\nwill consider that another life is dependent upon them, and will be\ncareful in all their habits, and especially in diet. They should not\neat that which is innutritious and exciting, simply because it tastes[383]\ngood. There are too many counselors ready to persuade them to do\nthings which reason would tell them they ought not to do.\nExtremes in Health Reform 341\nDiseased children are born because of the gratification of appetite\nby the parents. The system did not demand the variety of food\nupon which the mind dwelt. Because once in the mind it must be\nin the stomach, is a great error, which Christian women should\nreject. Imagination should not be allowed to control the wants of the\nsystem. Those who allow the taste to rule, will suffer the penalty of\ntransgressing the laws of their being. And the matter does not end\nhere; their innocent offspring also will be sufferers.\nThe blood-making organs cannot convert spices, mince pies,\npickles, and diseased flesh meats into good blood. And if so much\nfood is taken into the stomach that the digestive organs are compelled\nto overwork in order to dispose of it and to free the system from\nirritating substances, the mother does injustice to herself and lays\nthe foundation of disease in her offspring. If she chooses to eat as\nshe pleases, and what she may fancy, irrespective of consequences,\nshe will bear the penalty, but not alone. Her innocent child must\nsuffer because of her indiscretion.\nGreat care should be exercised to have the surroundings of the\nmother pleasant and happy. The husband and father is under special\nresponsibility to do all in his power to lighten the burden of the wife\nand mother. He should bear, as much as possible, the burden of her\ncondition. He should be affable, courteous, kind, and tender, and\nspecially attentive to all her wants. Not half the care is taken of some\nwomen while they are bearing children that is taken of animals in\nthe stable.\nB has been very deficient. While in her best condition of health,\nhis wife was not provided with a plenty of wholesome food and with\nproper clothing. Then, when she needed extra clothing and extra [384]\nfood, and that of a simple yet nutritious quality, it was not allowed\nher. Her system craved material to convert into blood, but he would\nnot provide it. A moderate amount of milk and sugar, and a little salt,\nwhite bread raised with yeast for a change, graham flour prepared\nin a variety of ways by other hands than her own, plain cake with\nraisins, rice pudding with raisins, prunes, and figs, occasionally,\nand many other dishes I might mention, would have answered the\ndemand of appetite. If he could not obtain some of these things, a\nlittle domestic wine would have done her no injury; it would have\nbeen better for her to have it than to do without it. In some cases,\n342 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\neven a small amount of the least hurtful meat would do less injury\nthan to suffer strong cravings for it.\nI was shown that both B and C have dishonored the cause of\nGod. They have brought upon it a stain which will never be fully\nwiped out. I was shown the family of our dear Brother D. If this\nbrother had received proper help at the right time, every member of\nhis family would have been alive today. It is a wonder that the laws\nof the land have not been enforced in this instance of maltreatment.\nThat family were perishing for food, the plainest, simplest food.\nThey were starving in a land of plenty. A novice was practicing\nupon them. The young man did not die of disease, but of hunger.\nFood would have strengthened the system and kept the machinery\nin motion.\nIn cases of severe fever, abstinence from food for a short time\nwill lessen the fever and make the use of water more effectual. But\nthe acting physician needs to understand the real condition of the\npatient and not allow him to be restricted in diet for a great length\nof time until his system becomes enfeebled. While the fever is\nraging, food may irritate and excite the blood; but as soon as the\nstrength of the fever is broken, nourishment should be given in a\ncareful, judicious manner. If food is withheld too long, the stomach\u2019s\ncraving for it will create fever, which will be relieved by a proper[385]\nallowance of food of a right quality. It gives nature something to\nwork upon. If there is a great desire expressed for food, even during\nthe fever to gratify that desire with a moderate amount of simple food\nwould be less injurious than for the patient to be denied. When he\ncan get his mind upon nothing else, nature will not be overburdened\nwith a small portion of simple food.\nThose who take the lives of others in their hands must be men\nwho have been marked as making life a success. They must be\nmen of judgment and wisdom, men who can sympathize and feel\nto the depths, men whose whole being is stirred when they witness\nsuffering. Some men who have been unsuccessful in every other\nenterprise in life take up the business of a physician. They take\nthe lives of men and women in their hands, when they have had\nno experience. They read a plan which somebody has followed\nwith success, and adopt it, and then practice upon those who have\nconfidence in them, actually destroying the last spark of life; yet\nExtremes in Health Reform 343\nafter all they do not learn anything, but will go on just as sanguine\nin the next case, observing the same rigid treatment. Some persons\nmay have a power of constitution sufficient to withstand the terrible\ntax imposed upon them, and live. Then the novices take the glory to\nthemselves, when none is due them. Everything is due to God and\nto a powerful constitution.\nBrother C has been occupying an unworthy position in standing\nas a prop for B. He has been mind for him, and has stood by to\nsustain and back him up. These two men are fanatics on the subject\nof health reform. Brother C knows much less than he thinks he does.\nHe is deceived in himself. He is selfish and bigoted in carrying out\nhis views; he is not teachable. He has not had a subdued will. He\nis not a man of humble mind. Such a man has no business to be a\nphysician. He may have gained some little knowledge by reading,\nbut this is not enough. Experience is necessary. Our people are too [386]\nfew to be sacrificed so cheaply and ingloriously as to submit to being\nexperimented upon by such men. Altogether too many precious ones\nwould fall a sacrifice to their rigid views and notions before they\nwould give up, confess their errors, and learn wisdom by experience.\nBrother C is too set and willful, and too unteachable for the Lord\nto use to do any special work in His cause. He is too stubborn to\nlet a few sacrificed lives change his course. He would maintain his\nviews and notions all the more earnestly. These men will yet learn to\ntheir sorrow that they might better be teachable, and not drive their\nextreme views, whatever the result may be. The community will be\njust as well off, and a little safer upon the whole, if both these men\nobtain employment in some other business where life and health\nwill not be endangered by their course of action.\nIt is a great responsibility to take the life of a human being in\nhand. And to have that precious life sacrificed through mismanage-\nment is dreadful. The case of Brother D\u2019s family is terrible. These\nmen may excuse their course; but that will not save the cause of God\nfrom reproach, nor bring back that son who suffered and died for\nthe want of food. A little good wine and food would have brought\nhim up from a bed of death and given him back to his family. The\nfather also would soon have been numbered with the dead if the\nsame course had been continued which had been pursued toward the\n344 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nson, but the presence and timely counsel of a doctor from the Health\nInstitute saved him.\nIt is time that something was done to prevent novices from taking\nthe field and advocating health reform. Their works and words can be\nspared; for they do more injury than the wisest and most intelligent\nmen, with the best influence they can exert, can counteract. It is\nimpossible for the best qualified advocates of health reform to fully[387]\nrelieve the minds of the public from the prejudice received through\nthe wrong course of these extremists and to place the great subject\nof health reform upon a right basis in the community where these\nmen have figured. The door is also closed in a great measure, so that\nunbelievers cannot be reached by the present truth upon the Sabbath\nand the soon coming of our Saviour. The most precious truths are\ncast aside by the people as unworthy of a hearing. These men are\nreferred to as representatives of health reformers and Sabbathkeepers\nin general. A great responsibility rests upon those who have thus\nproved a stumbling block to unbelievers.\nBrother C needs a thorough conversion. He does not see himself.\nIf he possessed less self-esteem and more humility of mind, his\nknowledge could be put to a practical use. He has a work to do for\nhimself which no one else can do for him. He will not yield his\nviews or judgment to any man living, unless compelled to do so. He\nhas traits of character which are most unfortunate and which should\nbe overcome. He is more accountable than B, and his case is worse\nthan his; for he possesses more intellect and knowledge. B has been\nthe shadow of his mind.\nBrother C has a set will; his likes and dislikes are very strong.\nIf he starts on a wrong track, and follows the bent of his mind, not\nmoving in wisdom, and his error is presented before him, even if\nhe knows he is not right, he is so reluctant to acknowledge that he\nhas been in error and has pursued a wrong course that he will frame\nsome kind of excuse to make others believe that he is, after all, about\nright. This is the reason why he has been left to follow his own\njudgment and wisdom, which are foolishness.\nIn his father\u2019s family he has not been a blessing, but a cause of\nanxiety and sorrow. His will was not subdued in childhood. He had[388]\nsuch a reluctance to acknowledge frankly that he had made mistakes\nand done wrong that, to get out of the difficulty, he would set the\nExtremes in Health Reform 345\npowers of his mind at work to invent some excuse that he flattered\nhimself was not a direct lie, rather than humble himself sufficiently\nto confess his wrong. This habit has been brought with him into his\nreligious experience. He has a peculiar faculty of turning away a\npoint by pleading forgetfulness, when, many times, he chooses to\nforget.\nHis relatives and friends might have been brought into the truth\nhad he been what God would have him to be. But his set ways have\nmade him disagreeable. He has used the truth as a subject to quarrel\nover. In spite of his father\u2019s opposition he has talked Bible subjects\nin his father\u2019s family, and has used the most objectionable subjects\nto quarrel over, instead of seeking in all humbleness of mind, and\nwith an undying love for souls, to win to the truth and bring to the\nlight.\nWhen he has pursued a wrong course, evidently unbecoming a\ndisciple of the meek and lowly Jesus, and has known that his words\nand acts were not in accordance with the sanctifying influence of\ntruth, he has mulishly stood in his own defense, until his honesty\nhas been questioned. He has made the most precious truth for these\nlast days disgusting to his friends and relatives; he has proved a\nstumbling block to them. His evasions, his bigotry, and the extreme\nviews he has taken have turned more souls away from the truth than\nhis best endeavors have brought into it.\nHis combativeness, firmness, and self-esteem are large. He\ncannot bless any church with his influence until he is converted. He\ncan see the faults of others, and will question the course of this one\nand that one if they do not fully endorse what he may present; but if\nanyone receives what he advocates, he cannot and will not see their\nfaults and errors. This is not right. He may be correct upon many\npoints, but he has not the mind which dwelt in Christ. When he can [389]\nsee himself as he is, and will correct the defects in his character,\nthen he will be in a position to let his light so shine before men, that\nthey, by seeing his good works, may be led to glorify our Father who\nis in heaven. His light has shone in such a manner that men have\npronounced it darkness and turned from it in disgust. Self must die,\nand he must possess a teachable spirit, or he will be left to follow\nhis own ways and be filled with his own doings.\n346 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\n\u201cAnd the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto\nall men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that\noppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance\nto the acknowledging of the truth.\u201d \u201cTo speak evil of no man, to be\nno brawlers [not talking the truth in a boasting, triumphant manner],\nbut gentle, showing all meekness unto all men.\u201d \u201cBut sanctify the\nLord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to\nevery man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with\nmeekness and fear.\u201d\nBrother C wants his mind to control others, and unless he can\nhave this privilege he is dissatisfied. He is not a peacemaker. His\ncourse will cause more confusion and distrust in a church than any\nten persons can counteract. His peculiar temperament is such that he\nwill be picking flaws, and finding fault with all but himself. He will\nnot prosper until he learns the lesson that he ought to have learned\nyears ago, humbleness of mind. At his age he will learn this lesson\nat much cost to self. All his life he has been trying to build himself\nup, to save himself, to preserve his own life; and he has lost his labor\nevery time.\nWhat Brother C needs is to have the deceptive gloss taken from\nhis eyes, that he may look, with eyes enlightened by the Spirit of\nGod, into his own heart, and test and weigh every motive, and not\nlet Satan put a false coloring upon his course of action. His position[390]\nis extremely perilous. He will soon turn decidedly to the right, or he\nwill go on deceiving others and deceiving himself. He needs to have\nhis inmost soul converted, and to be subdued and transformed by the\nrenewing of his mind. Then he can do good. But he can never come\ninto the light until he encourages a spirit of humble confession and\ntakes hold with decision to right his wrongs and, as far as he can, to\ndo away the reproach he has brought upon the cause of God.\n* * * * *\nChapter 54\u2014Sensuality in the Young\nDear Brother and Sister E,\nIt has been some time since I have taken my pen to write anything\nexcept urgent letters which could not be delayed. I have had a\ndiscouraging weight upon my spirits for months, which has nearly\ncrushed me. That which discourages me the most is the fear that\nall I may write will do no more good than has our earnest, anxious,\nwearing labor in ----- the past winter and spring. The hopeless view I\nhave taken of matters and things at that place has kept my pen nearly\nstill and my voice nearly silent. My hands have been weakened and\nmy heart depressed, to see nothing gained by the protracted effort\nthere. I am nearly hopeless in regard to our efforts\u2019 being successful\nto awaken the sensibilities of our Sabbathkeeping people to see the\nelevated position which God requires them to occupy. They do not\nview religious things from an elevated standpoint. This is just your\ncondition.\nThe Lord has given me a view of some of the corruptions ev-\nerywhere existing. Wickedness, crime, and sensuality exist even\nin high places. Even in the churches professing to keep God\u2019s\ncommandments there are sinners and hypocrites. It is sin, not trial\nand suffering, which separates God from His people and renders\nthe soul incapable of enjoying and glorifying Him. It is sin that [391]\nis destroying souls. Sin and vice exist in Sabbathkeeping families.\nMoral pollution has done more than every other evil to cause the\nrace to degenerate. It is practiced to an alarming extent and brings\non disease of almost every description. Even very small children,\ninfants, being born with natural irritability of the sexual organs, find\nmomentary relief in handling them, which only increases the irrita-\ntion, and leads to a repetition of the act, until a habit is established\nwhich increases with their growth. These children, generally puny\nand dwarfed, are prescribed for by physicians and drugged; but the\nevil is not removed. The cause still exists.\n347\n348 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nParents do not generally suspect that their children understand\nanything about this vice. In very many cases the parents are the\nreal sinners. They have abused their marriage privileges, and by\nindulgence have strengthened their animal passions. And as these\nhave strengthened, the moral and intellectual faculties have become\nweak. The spiritual has been overborne by the brutish. Children are\nborn with the animal propensities largely developed, the parents\u2019\nown stamp of character having been given to them. The unnatural\naction of the sensitive organs produces irritation. They are easily\nexcited, and momentary relief is experienced in exercising them. But\nthe evil constantly increases. The drain upon the system is sensibly\nfelt. The brain force is weakened, and memory becomes deficient.\nChildren born to these parents will almost invariably take naturally\nto the disgusting habits of secret vice. The marriage covenant is\nsacred, but what an amount of lust and crime it covers! Those who\nfeel at liberty, because married, to degrade their bodies by beastly\nindulgence of the animal passions, will have their degraded course\nperpetuated in their children. The sins of the parents will be visited\nupon their children because the parents have given them the stamp\nof their own lustful propensities.\nThose who have become fully established in this soul-and-body-[392]\ndestroying vice can seldom rest until their burden of secret evil is\nimparted to those with whom they associate. Curiosity is at once\naroused, and the knowledge of vice is passed from youth to youth,\nfrom child to child, until there is scarcely one to be found ignorant\nof the practice of this degrading sin.\nYour children have practiced self-abuse until the draft upon the\nbrain has been so great, especially in the case of your eldest son, that\ntheir minds have been seriously injured. The brilliancy of youthful\nintellect is dimmed. The moral and intellectual powers have become\nweakened, while the baser part of their nature has been gaining the\nascendancy. For this reason your son turns with loathing from re-\nligious things. He has been losing his power of self-restraint, and\nhas less and less reverence for sacred things, and less respect for\nanything of a spiritual character. You have charged this to your sur-\nroundings, but you have not known the real cause. Your son can be\nsaid to bear the impress of the satanic instead of the divine. He loves\nSensuality in the Young 349\nsin and evil rather than true goodness, purity, and righteousness. It\nis a deplorable picture.\nThe effect of such debasing habits is not the same upon all\nminds. There are some children who have the moral powers largely\ndeveloped, who, by associating with children that practice self-abuse,\nbecome initiated into this vice. The effect upon such will be too\nfrequently to make them melancholy, irritable, and jealous; yet such\nmay not lose their respect for religious worship, and may not show\nspecial infidelity in regard to spiritual things. They will at times\nsuffer keenly from feelings of remorse, and will feel degraded in\ntheir own eyes, and lose their self-respect.\nBrother and sister, you are not clear before God. You have\nfailed to do your duty at home, in your own family. You have not\ncontrolled your children. You have greatly failed to know and do [393]\nthe will of God, and His blessing has not rested upon your family.\nBrother E, you have been selfish. You have had large self-esteem.\nYou have thought that you possessed a good degree of humility, but\nyou have not understood yourself. Your ways are not right before\nGod. Your influence and example have not been in accordance with\nyour profession. You have much fault to find with others; you see\ndeviations from the right in them, but you are blind to the same in\nyourself.\nSister E has been far from God. Her heart has not been subdued\nby grace. Her love of the world, and of the things that are in the\nworld, has closed her heart to the love of God. The love of dress\nand appearance has kept her from good, and led her to place her\nmind and affections upon these frivolous things. Unbelief has been\nstrengthening in her heart, and she has had less and less love for\nthe truth, and could see but little attraction in the simplicity of true\ngodliness. She has not encouraged a growth of Christian graces.\nShe has not loved humility or devotion. She has taken the errors of\nthose who professed to be devoted to the truth, and made their lack\nof spirituality, their errors, and their sins an excuse for her world-\nloving disposition. She has watched the course of those who were\nconnected with the -----, and who were forward to take upon them\nthe burdens of the church, and has offset her failures to their wrongs,\nsaying that she was no worse than they. Such and such individuals\nin good standing did this or that, and she had as good a right as they.\n350 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nSuch and such ones did not live the health reform any better than\nshe; they purchased and ate meat, and they were in high standing in\nthe church, and she was excusable, of course, with such an example,\nif she did the same.\nThis is not the only case where neglect to follow the light which\nthe Lord has given has been shielded behind the faults of others. It\nis to the shame of men and women of intelligence that they have no[394]\nhigher standard than that of imperfect human beings. The course\nof those around them, however imperfect, is considered by some a\nsufficient excuse for them to follow in the same path. Many will\nbe swayed by the influence of some leading brother. If he departs\nfrom the counsel of God his example is at once gladly seized by\nthe unconsecrated, who now feel that they are free from restraint.\nThey now have an excuse; and their unconsecrated hearts glory in\nthe opportunity of indulging their desires and taking a step nearer\nthe fellowship with the spirit of the world, where they can enjoy\nits pleasures and gratify their appetite. They therefore place upon\ntheir tables those things which are not the most healthful, and from\nwhich they have been taught to abstain, that they may preserve to\nthemselves a better condition of health.\nThere has been a war in the hearts of some ever since the health\nreform was first introduced. They have felt the same rebellion as\ndid the children of Israel when their appetites were restricted on\ntheir journey from Egypt to Canaan. Professed followers of Christ,\nwho have all their lives consulted their own pleasure and their own\ninterests, their own ease and their own appetites, are not prepared to\nchange their course of action and live for the glory of God, imitating\nthe self-sacrificing life of their unerring Pattern. A perfect example\nhas been given for Christians to imitate. The words and works of\nChrist\u2019s followers are the channel through which the pure principles\nof truth and holiness are conveyed to the world. His followers are\nthe salt of the earth, the light of the world.\nSister E, you cannot realize the many blessings you have lost by\nmaking the failings of others a balm to soothe your conscience for a\nneglect of your duty. You have been measuring yourself by others.\nTheir crooked paths, their failings, have been your textbook. But\ntheir errors, their follies and sins, do not make your disobedience to[395]\nGod less sinful. We regret that those who should be a strength to\nSensuality in the Young 351\nyou in your efforts to overcome your love of self, your pride of heart,\nyour vanity and love of the approbation of worldlings, have been\nonly a hindrance by their own lack of spirituality and true godliness.\nWe cannot tell you how much we regret that those who should be\nself-denying Christians are so far from coming up to the standard.\nThose who should be steadfast, abounding in the work of God, are\nweakened by Satan because they remain at such a distance from\nGod. They fail to obtain the power of His grace, through which they\nmight overcome the infirmities of their nature, and, by obtaining\nsignal victories in God, show those of weaker faith the way, the truth,\nand the life.\nThat which has caused us the greatest discouragement has been\nto see those in ----- who have had years of experience in the cause\nand work of God, shorn of their strength by their own unfaithfulness.\nThey are outgeneraled by the enemy in nearly every attack. God\nwould have made these persons strong, like faithful sentinels at their\npost, to guard the fort, had they walked in the light He had given\nthem and remained steadfast to duty, seeking to know and do the\nwhole will of God. Satan will, no doubt, through his delusions\ndeceive these delinquent souls, and make them believe that they are\nabout right after all. They have committed no grievous, outbreaking\nsins, and they must, after all, be on the true foundation, and God\nwill accept their works. They see no special sins to repent of, no sins\nwhich call for special humiliation, humble confession, and rending\nof heart. The delusion upon such is strong indeed when they mistake\nthe form of godliness for the power thereof, and flatter themselves\nthat they are rich and have need of nothing. The curse of Meroz rests\nupon them: \u201cCurse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye\nbitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of [396]\nthe Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty.\u201d\nMy sister, excuse not your defects because others are wrong.\nIn the day of God you will not dare to plead as an excuse for your\nneglect to form a character for heaven, that others did not manifest\ndevotion and spirituality. The same lack which you discovered in\nothers was in yourself. And the fact that others were sinners makes\nyour sins nonetheless grievous. Both they and you, if you continue\nin your present state of unfitness, will be separated from Christ,\nand will with Satan and his angels be punished with everlasting\n352 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ndestruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His\npower.\nThe Lord made ample provision for you, that if you would seek\nHim, and follow the light He would give you, you should not fall\nby the way. The word of God was given to you as a lamp to your\nfeet, a light to your path. If you stumble, it will be because you have\nnot consulted your guide, the word of God, and made that precious\nword the rule of your life. God has not given you as a pattern the\nlife of any human being, however good and apparently blameless\nhis life may be. If you do as others do, and act as others act, you\nwill at last be left outside the Holy City, with a vast multitude who\nhave done just as you have done, followed a pattern the Lord did not\nleave them, and who are lost just as you will be lost.\nThat which others have done, or may do in the future, will\nnot lessen your responsibility or guilt. A pattern has been given\nyou, a faultless life characterized by self-denial and disinterested\nbenevolence. If you turn from this correct, this perfect pattern, and\ntake an incorrect one, which has been clearly represented in the\nword of God as one that you should shun, your course of action will\nreceive its merited reward; your life will be a failure.\nOne of the greatest reasons for the declension of the church at\n----- is their measuring themselves by themselves and comparing[397]\nthemselves among themselves. There are but few who have the\nliving principle in the soul and who serve God with an eye single\nto His glory. Many at ----- will not consent to be saved in God\u2019s\nappointed way. They will not take the trouble to work out their own\nsalvation with fear and trembling. The latter they do not experience;\nand, rather than be at the trouble of obtaining an experience through\nindividual effort, they will run the risk of leaning upon others and\ntrusting in their experience. They cannot consent to watch and pray,\nto live for God and Him only. It is more pleasant to live in obedience\nto self.\nThe church at ----- are filled with their own backslidings, and\nthey need not dream of prosperity until those who name the name\nof Christ are careful to depart from all iniquity, until they learn to\nrefuse the evil and choose the good. We are required to watch and\npray without ceasing; for a snare is set in our path, and we shall find\nsome device of Satan when and where we least expect it. If at that\nSensuality in the Young 353\nparticular time we are not watching unto prayer we shall be taken\nby the enemy and meet with decided loss.\nWhat a responsibility has rested upon you as parents! How little\nhave you felt the weight of this burden! Pride of heart, love of show,\nand the indulgence of appetite have occupied your minds. These\nthings have been first with you, and the incoming of the foe has\nnot been perceived. He has planted his standard in your house and\nstamped his detestable image upon the characters of your children.\nBut you were so blinded by the god of this world, so deadened to\nspiritual and divine things, that you could not discern the advantage\nwhich Satan had gained nor his workings right in your family.\nYou have brought children into the world who have had no voice\nin regard to their existence. You have made yourselves responsible\nin a great measure for their future happiness, their eternal well-being. [398]\nThe burden is upon you, whether you are sensible of it or not, to train\nthese children for God, to watch with jealous care the first approach\nof the wily foe and be prepared to raise a standard against him. Build\na fortification of prayer and faith about your children, and exercise\ndiligent watching thereunto. You are not secure a moment against\nthe attacks of Satan. You have no time to rest from watchful, earnest\nlabor. You should not sleep a moment at your post. This is a most\nimportant warfare. Eternal consequences are involved. It is life or\ndeath with you and your family. Your only safety is to break your\nhearts before God and seek the kingdom of heaven as little children.\nYou cannot be victors in this warfare if you continue to pursue the\ncourse you have pursued. You are not very near the kingdom of\nheaven.\nSome who have not professed Christ are nearer the kingdom\nof God than are very many professed Sabbathkeepers in -----. You\nhave not kept yourselves in the love of God and taught your children\nthe fear of the Lord. You have not taught them the truth diligently,\nwhen you rose up, and when you sat down, when you went out,\nand when you came in. You have not restrained them. You look\nto other children and solace yourselves by saying: \u201cMy children\nare no worse than they.\u201d This may be true, but does the neglect of\nothers to do their duty lessen the force of the requirements which\nGod has especially enjoined upon you as parents? He has placed\nupon you the responsibility to bring these children up for Him, and\n354 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ntheir salvation depends in a great degree upon the education they\nreceive in their childhood. This responsibility others cannot take; it\nis yours, solely yours, as parents. You may bring to your aid all the\nhelps you can to assist in the solemn and important work; but after\nyou have done this, there is a power above every human agency, that\nwill work with you through the means which it is your privilege to[399]\nuse. God will come to your aid, and upon His power you can rely.\nThis power is infinite. Human agencies may not prove successful,\nbut God can make them fruitful by working in and through them.\nYou have a work to do to set your house in order. Pure, sinless\nangels cannot delight to come into a dwelling where so much iniquity\nis practiced. You are asleep at your post. Things of minor importance\nhave occupied your minds to the exclusion of more weighty matters.\nIt should be the first business of your life to seek the kingdom of\nheaven and its righteousness; then you have the promise that all\nthings shall be added. Here is where you have failed in your family.\nHad you been agonizing that you and yours might enter in at the\nstrait gate, you would have earnestly gathered every ray of light that\nthe Lord has permitted to shine upon your pathway, and would have\ncherished and walked in it.\nYou have not regarded the light that the Lord has graciously\ngiven you upon the health reform. You have felt to rise up against it.\nYou have seen no importance in it, no reason why you should receive\nit. You have not felt willing to restrict your appetite. You could not\nsee the wisdom of God in giving light in regard to the restriction of\nappetite. All that you could discern was the inconvenience attending\nthe denial of the taste. The Lord has let His light shine upon us in\nthese last days, that the gloom and darkness which have been gather-\ning in past generations because of sinful indulgences might in some\ndegree be dispelled, and that the train of evils which have resulted\nbecause of intemperate eating and drinking might be lessened.\nThe Lord in wisdom designed to bring His people into a position\nwhere they would be separate from the world in spirit and practice,\nthat their children might not so readily be led into idolatry and\nbecome tainted with the prevailing corruptions of this age. It is[400]\nGod\u2019s design that believing parents and their children should stand\nforth as living representatives of Christ, candidates for everlasting\nlife. All who are partakers of the divine nature will escape the\nSensuality in the Young 355\ncorruption that is in the world through lust. It is impossible for\nthose who indulge the appetite to attain to Christian perfection. You\ncannot arouse the moral sensibilities of your children while you are\nnot careful in the selection of their food. The tables that parents\nusually prepare for their children are a snare to them. Their diet is\nnot simple, and is not prepared in a healthful manner. The food is\nfrequently rich and fever-producing, having a tendency to irritate\nand excite the tender coats of the stomach. The animal propensities\nare strengthened and bear sway, while the moral and intellectual\npowers are weakened and become servants to the baser passions.\nYou should study to prepare a simple yet nutritious diet. Flesh meats,\nand rich cakes and pies prepared with spices of any kind, are not the\nmost healthful and nourishing diet. Eggs should not be placed upon\nyour table. [See Appendix.] They are an injury to your children.\nFruits and grains, prepared in the most simple form, are the most\nhealthful, and will impart the greatest amount of nourishment to the\nbody, and, at the same time, not impair the intellect.\nRegularity in eating is very important for health of body and\nserenity of mind. Your children should eat only at the regular meal-\ntime. They should not be allowed to digress from this established\nrule. When you, Sister E, absent yourself from home, you can-\nnot control these important matters. Already your eldest son has\nenervated his entire system and laid the foundation for permanent\ndisease. Your second child is fast following in his steps, and not one\nof your children is safe from this evil.\nYou may be unable to obtain the truth from your children in [401]\nregard to their habits. Those who practice secret vice will lie and de-\nceive. Your children may deceive you, for you are not in a condition\nwhere you can know if they attempt to lead you astray. You have so\nlong been blinded by the enemy that you have scarcely a ray of light\nto discern darkness. There is a great, a solemn, and an important\nwork for you to do at once, to set your own hearts and house in\norder. Your only safe course is to take right hold of this work. Do\nnot deceive yourselves into the belief that, after all, this matter is\nplaced before you in an exaggerated light. I have not colored the\npicture. I have stated facts which will bear the test of the judgment.\nAwake! awake! I beseech you, before it shall be too late for wrongs\nto be righted, and you and your children perish in the general ruin.\n356 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nTake hold of the solemn work, and bring to your aid every ray of\nlight you can gather that has shone upon your pathway and that you\nhave not cherished, and, together with the aid of the light now shin-\ning, commence an investigation of your life and character as if you\nwere before the tribunal of God. \u201cAbstain from fleshly lusts, which\nwar against the soul,\u201d is the exhortation of the apostle. Vice and\ncorruption abound on every hand, and unless you have more than\nhuman strength to rely upon to stand against so powerful a current\nof evil, you will be overcome and borne down with the current to\nperdition. Without holiness no man shall see God.\nThe Lord is proving and testing His people. Angels of God are\nwatching the development of character and weighing moral worth.\nProbation is almost ended, and you are unready. Oh, that the word\nof warning might burn into your souls! Get ready! get ready! Work\nwhile the day lasts, for the night cometh when no man can work.\nThe mandate will go forth: He that is holy, let him be holy still;\nand he that is filthy, let him be filthy still. The destiny of all will be\ndecided. A few, yes, only a few, of the vast number who people the[402]\nearth will be saved unto life eternal, while the masses who have not\nperfected their souls in obeying the truth will be appointed to the\nsecond death. O Saviour, save the purchase of Thy blood! is the cry\nof my anguished heart.\nI greatly fear for you and for many who profess to believe the\ntruth in -----. Oh, search, search diligently your own hearts, and\nmake thorough work for the judgment! I am pained at heart when\nI call to mind how many children of Sabbathkeeping parents are\nruining soul and body with secret vice. Near you is a family who\nreveal their evil habits in their bodies as well as their minds. These\nchildren are on the direct road to perdition. They are debased them-\nselves, and have instructed many others in this vice. The eldest boy\nis dwarfed, physically and mentally, by indulging in its practice.\nWhat little intellect he has left is of a low order. If he continues\nin this vicious practice he will eventually become idiotic. Every\nindulgence of children who have attained their growth is a terrible\nevil and will produce terrible results, enervating the system and\nweakening the intellect. But in those who indulge this corrupting\nvice before attaining their growth, the evil effects are more plainly\nmarked, and recovery from its effects is more nearly hopeless. The\nSensuality in the Young 357\nframe is weak and stunted; the muscles are flabby; the eyes become\nsmall, and appear at times swollen; the memory is treacherous, and\nbecomes sievelike; and inability to concentrate the thoughts upon\nstudy increases.\nTo the parents of these children I would say: You have brought\nchildren into the world to be only a curse to society. They are unruly,\npassionate, quarrelsome, and vicious. Their influence upon others\nis corrupting. They bear the stamp of the father\u2019s character, of his\nbase passions. His hasty, violent temper is reflected in them. These\nparents should long ago have removed to the country, thus separating\nthemselves and children from the society of those whom they could [403]\nnot benefit, but would only harm. Steady industry upon a farm would\nhave proved a blessing to these children, and constant employment,\nas their strength could bear, would have given them less opportunity\nto corrupt their own bodies by self-abuse, and would have prevented\nthem from instructing a large number in this hellish practice. Labor\nis a great blessing to all children, especially to that class whose\nminds are naturally inclined to vice and depravity.\nThese children have communicated more knowledge of vice in\n----- than all the united efforts of ministers and people professing\ngodliness can counteract. Many who have learned of your children\nwill go to perdition rather than control their passions and cease the\nindulgence of this sin. One corrupt mind can sow more evil seed in a\nshort period of time than many can root out in a whole lifetime. Your\nchildren are a byword in the mouths of blasphemers of the truth.\nThese are the children of Sabbathkeepers, but they are worse than\nthe children of worldlings in general. They possess less refinement,\nless self-respect. Brother F has been no honor to the cause of God.\nHis impetuous temper and general influence have not had a tendency\nto elevate, but to bring down to a low level. The cause of God has\nbeen brought into disrepute by his lack of judgment and refinement.\nIt would have been far better for the cause of truth had this family\nremoved long ago to a less important post, where they would have\nbeen more secluded and their influence less felt. Their children\nhave lived in the light of truth and have had privileges that but few\nchildren have had; yet all this time they have not been benefited,\nbut have been growing more and more hardened in depravity. Their\nremoval would be a blessing to the church and to society, and to the\n358 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nentire family. Steady employment upon land would be a blessing to\nfather and children if they would profit by the advantages of farm\nlife.\nI saw that the family of Brother G need a great work done for[404]\nthem. H and I have gone to great lengths in this crime of self-abuse;\nespecially is this true of H, who has gone so far in the practice of\nthis sin that his intellect is affected, his eye-sight is weakened, and\ndisease is fastening itself upon him. Satan has almost full control\nof this poor boy\u2019s mind, but his parents are not awake to see the\nevil and its results. His mind is debased, his conscience hardened,\nhis moral sensibilities benumbed, and he will be a ready victim for\nevil associates to lead into sin and crime. Brother and Sister G,\narouse yourselves, I beg of you. You have not received the light of\nhealth reform and acted upon it. If you had restricted your appetites\nyou would have been saved much extra labor and expense; and,\nwhat is of vastly more consequence, you would have preserved to\nyourselves a better condition of physical health and a greater degree\nof intellectual strength to appreciate eternal truths; you would have\na clearer brain to weigh the evidences of truth and would be better\nprepared to give to others a reason of the hope that is in you. Your\nfood is not of that simple, healthful quality which will make the\nbest kind of blood. Foul blood will surely becloud the moral and\nintellectual powers, and arouse and strengthen the baser passions of\nyour nature. Neither of you can afford a feverish diet, for it is at the\nexpense of the health of the body and the prosperity of your own\nsouls and the souls of your children.\nYou place upon your table food which taxes the digestive organs,\nexcites the animal passions, and weakens the moral and intellectual\nfaculties. Rich food and flesh meats are no benefit to you. Could you\nknow just the nature of the meat you eat, could you see the animals\nwhen living from which the flesh is taken when dead, you would\nturn with loathing from your flesh meats. The very animals whose\nflesh you eat are frequently so diseased that, if left alone, they would\ndie of themselves; but while the breath of life is in them, they are[405]\nkilled and brought to market. You take directly into your system\nhumors and poison of the worst kind, and yet you realize it not. You\nlove to indulge appetite. You have this lesson to learn: Whether\nSensuality in the Young 359\ntherefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of\nGod.\u201d\nI entreat you, for Christ\u2019s sake, to set your house and hearts in\norder. Let the truth of heavenly origin elevate and sanctify you, soul,\nbody, and spirit. \u201cAbstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the\nsoul.\u201d Brother G, your eating has a tendency to strengthen the baser\npassions. You do not control your body as it is your duty to do in\norder to perfect holiness in the fear of God. Temperance in eating\nmust be practiced before you can be a patient man. Remember that\nyou have given to your children, in a great degree, the stamp of your\nown character. You should guard yourself, and not be harsh, severe,\nor impatient. Deal with them decidedly, yet patiently, lovingly,\npityingly, as Jesus has dealt with you. Be careful how you censure.\nBear with your children, yet restrain them. This you have neglected\ntoo much. You have not corrected them in the right manner, not\nhaving perfect control of your own spirit. A great work must be\ndone for you both.\nBrother G, if you had gone on from strength to strength, fol-\nlowing in the light the Lord has given, He would now have chosen\nyou as an instrument of righteousness. You have talents; you have\nability; you can work for God\u2019s glory; but you have not made an\nentire surrender of yourself to God. Oh, that you would even now\nseek meekness, seek the righteousness of Christ, that you might be\nhid in the day of the Lord\u2019s fierce anger!\nMy dear brother and sister, you should take hold unitedly and\nperseveringly to right your mismanagement of your children. Sister\nG has been too indulgent; yet unitedly and in love you can do much, [406]\neven now, to bind your children to your hearts and instruct them\nin the good and right way. You have a work to do in setting your\nown hearts and house in order. You should cultivate harmonious\naction. The transforming influence of the Spirit of God can do a\ngreat work for you both, and will unite your hearts and efforts in the\nwork of reform in your own family. All repining, murmuring, and\nhasty irritability should cease. Its effects are to weaken you both and\nto destroy the influence you must exert if you succeed in training\nyour children for heaven.\nSatan now has the field. Your poor children are his captives; he\nhas control of their minds and causes them to take a low turn. Their\n360 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nmoral sensibilities seem paralyzed. They have practiced self-abuse\nand gloried in their iniquities. Such boys are capable of poisoning\nan entire neighborhood or community, and their pernicious influence\nwill endanger all who are brought in contact with them in school\ncapacity. Your children are corrupt in body and in mind. Vice has\nplaced its marks upon your elder children. They are tainted, deeply\ntainted, with sin. The animal propensities predominate, while the\nmoral and intellectual faculties are very weak. The baser passions\nhave gained strength by exercise, while conscience has become hard-\nened and seared. This is the influence which vice will have upon the\nmental powers. Those who give themselves up to work the ruin of\ntheir own bodies and minds do not stop here. Eventually they will\nbe found ready for crime in almost any form, for their consciences\nare seared. Parents have not been half aroused to realize their re-\nsponsibility in becoming parents. They are remiss in their duty.\nThey do not teach their children the sinfulness of these dangerous,\nvirtue-destroying habits. Until parents arouse, there is no hope for\ntheir children.\nI might mention the cases of many others, but will forbear, except[407]\nin a few instances. J is a dangerous associate. He is a subject of this\nvice. His influence is bad. The grace of God has no influence upon\nhis heart. He has a good intellect, and his father has trusted much\nto this to balance him; but mental power alone is not a guarantee\nof virtuous superiority. The absence of religious principle makes\nhim corrupt at heart and sly in his wrongdoing. His influence is\npernicious everywhere. He is infidel in his principles and glories in\nhis skepticism. When with those of his own age, or those younger\nthan himself, he talks knowingly of religious things and jests and\nsneers at truth and the Bible. This pretended knowledge has an\ninfluence to corrupt minds and lead young men to feel ashamed of\nthe truth. Such companions should be wholly avoided, for this is\nthe only sure course of safety. Young girls are enamored with the\nsociety of this young man; even some who profess to be Christians\nprefer such society.\nK is a boy who can be molded if surrounded by correct influences.\nHe needs a right example. If the young who profess Christ would\nhonor Him in their lives, they could exert an influence which would\ncounteract the pernicious influence of such youth as J. But the young\nSensuality in the Young 361\ngenerally have no more religion than those who have never named\nthe name of Christ. They do not depart from iniquity. A smart,\nintelligent boy, like J, can have a powerful influence for evil. If\nthis intelligence were controlled by virtue and rectitude, it would be\npowerful for good; but if it is swayed by depravity, its evil influence\nupon his associates cannot be estimated, and it will assuredly sink\nhim in perdition. A good intellect corrupted makes a very bad heart.\nA brilliant intellect sanctified by the Spirit of God exerts a hidden\npower and diffuses light and purity upon all with whom the happy\npossessor associates.\nIf a boy of such mental abilities as J would surrender his heart to\nChrist, it would be his salvation. By means of pure religion his intel- [408]\nlect would be brought into a healthy channel; his mental and moral\npowers would become vigorous and harmonious; the conscience,\nilluminated by divine grace, would be quick and pure, controlling\nthe will and desires, and leading to frankness and uprightness in\nevery act of life. Without the principles of religion, this boy will\nbe cunning, artful, sly, in an evil course, and will poison all with\nwhom he associates. I warn all the youth to beware of this young\nman if he continues to slight religion and the Bible. You cannot be\ntoo guarded in his society.\nBy associating with those boys who do not exert a right influence,\nL is also being corrupted. J and K are not profitable associates for\nhim, for he is easily influenced in the wrong direction. ----- is not the\nbest place for him. His habits are not pure; self-abuse is practiced by\nhim. Because of this and his love for the company of evil associates,\nthose desires which help to form a virtuous character and to secure\nheaven at last will be weakened. The young who desire immortality\nmust stop where they are and not allow an impure thought or act.\nImpure thoughts lead to impure actions. If Christ be the theme of\ncontemplation, the thoughts will be widely separated from every\nsubject which will lead to impure acts. The mind will strengthen by\ndwelling upon elevating subjects. If trained to run in the channel of\npurity and holiness, it will become healthy and vigorous. If trained\nto dwell upon spiritual themes, it will naturally take that turn. But\nthis attraction of the thoughts to heavenly things cannot be gained\nwithout the exercise of faith in God and an earnest, humble reliance\n362 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nupon Him for that strength and grace which will be sufficient for\nevery emergency.\nPurity of life and a character molded after the divine Pattern are\nnot obtained without earnest effort and fixed principles. A vacillating\nperson will not succeed in attaining Christian perfection. Such will[409]\nbe weighed in the balances and found wanting. Like a roaring\nlion, Satan is seeking for his prey. He tries his wiles upon every\nunsuspecting youth; there is safety only in Christ. It is through His\ngrace alone that Satan can be successfully repulsed. Satan tells the\nyoung that there is time enough yet, that they may indulge in sin and\nvice this once and never again; but that one indulgence will poison\ntheir whole life. Do not once venture on forbidden ground. In this\nperilous day of evil, when allurements to vice and corruption are on\nevery hand, let the earnest, heartfelt cry of the young be raised to\nheaven: \u201cWherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?\u201d And\nmay his ears be open and his heart inclined to obey the instruction\ngiven in the answer: \u201cBy taking heed thereto according to Thy word.\u201d\nThe only safety for the youth in this age of pollution is to make God\ntheir trust. Without divine help they will be unable to control human\npassions and appetites. In Christ is the very help needed, but how\nfew will come to Him for that help. Said Jesus when upon the earth:\n\u201cYe will not come to Me, that ye might have life.\u201d In Christ all can\nconquer. You can say with the apostle: \u201cNay, in all these things we\nare more than conquerors through Him that loved us.\u201d Again: \u201cBut I\nkeep under my body, and bring it into subjection.\u201d\nI have written out quite fully the case of Brother E and family\nbecause this one illustrates the true state of many families, and God\nwould have these families take this as though written specially for\ntheir benefit. There are many more cases I might designate, but I\nhave named enough already. Young girls are not as a general thing\nclear of the crime of self-abuse. They practice it, and, as the result,\ntheir constitutions are being ruined. Some who are just entering\nwomanhood are in danger of paralysis of the brain. Already the\nmoral and intellectual powers are weakened and benumbed, while\nthe animal passions are gaining the ascendancy and corrupting body[410]\nand soul. The youth, whether male or female, cannot be Christians\nunless they entirely cease to practice this hellish, soul-and-body-\ndestroying vice.\nSensuality in the Young 363\nMany of the young are eager for books. They read everything\nthey can obtain. Exciting love stories and impure pictures have a\ncorrupting influence. Novels are eagerly perused by many, and,\nas the result, their imagination becomes defiled. In the cars, pho-\ntographs of females in a state of nudity are frequently circulated for\nsale. These disgusting pictures are also found in daguerrean saloons,\nand are hung upon the walls of those who deal in engravings. This is\nan age when corruption is teeming everywhere. The lust of the eye\nand corrupt passions are aroused by beholding and by reading. The\nheart is corrupted through the imagination. The mind takes pleasure\nin contemplating scenes which awaken the lower and baser passions.\nThese vile images, seen through defiled imagination, corrupt the\nmorals and prepare the deluded, infatuated beings to give loose rein\nto lustful passions. Then follow sins and crimes which drag beings\nformed in the image of God down to a level with the beasts, sinking\nthem at last in perdition. Avoid reading and seeing things which\nwill suggest impure thoughts. Cultivate the moral and intellectual\npowers. Let not these noble powers become enfeebled and perverted\nby much reading of even storybooks. I know of strong minds that\nhave been unbalanced and partially benumbed, or paralyzed, by\nintemperance in reading.\nI appeal to parents to control the reading of their children. Much\nreading does them only harm. Especially do not permit upon your\ntables the magazines and newspapers wherein are found love stories.\nIt is impossible for the youth to possess a healthy tone of mind and\ncorrect religious principles unless they enjoy the perusal of the word\nof God. This book contains the most interesting history, points out [411]\nthe way of salvation through Christ, and is their guide to a higher and\nbetter life. They would all pronounce it the most interesting book\nthey ever perused, if their imagination had not become perverted by\nexciting stories of a fictitious character. You who are looking for\nyour Lord to come the second time to change your mortal bodies,\nand to fashion them like unto His most glorious body, must come\nup upon a higher plane of action. You must work from a higher\nstandpoint than you have hitherto done, or you will not be of that\nnumber who will receive the finishing touch of immortality.\n* * * * *\nChapter 55\u2014True Love at Home\nBrother M,\nAt Adams Center I was shown that you greatly lacked an un-\nselfish spirit while at the Institute; you did not exert the influence\nthat you should. You might have let your light shine there, but you\ndid not. You often neglected your duty for amusements. You failed\nto take care and to bear responsibility. You do not enjoy active exer-\ncise. You love your ease; you and hard work are at variance. This is\nselfish. You allowed the property of the Institute to run down and\nbe destroyed, when it was your business to see that it was kept up,\nand that everything was in order, and preserved with greater interest\nand care than if it were your own. You were an unfaithful steward.\nEvery time you permitted yourself to engage in amusements, playing\ncroquet or anything of the kind, you were using time for which you\nwere paid and which did not belong to you. You would be just as\nexcusable should you take money which you had not earned and\nappropriate it to yourself.\nBrethren Loughborough, Andrews, Aldrich, and others did not\nknow you. They estimated you too highly. You could not fill the[412]\nplace they employed you to fill. They erred in judgment when they\npaid you so high a price for your labor. You did not earn the money\nthat you received. You were very slow and lacked greatly in energy.\nYou were not enough interested and awake to see and do, and things\nwere terribly neglected by you.\nMy brother, you are far from God; you are in a state of backslid-\ning. You do not possess noble moral courage. You yield to your own\ndesires instead of denying self. In seeking after happiness, you have\nattended places of amusement which God does not approve, and in\nso doing have weakened your own soul. My brother, you have much\nto learn. You indulge your appetite by eating more food than your\nsystem can convert into good blood. It is sin to be intemperate in\nthe quantity of food eaten, even if the quality is unobjectionable.\nMany feel that, if they do not eat meat and the grosser articles of\n364\nTrue Love at Home 365\nfood, they may eat of simple food until they cannot well eat more.\nThis is a mistake. Many professed health reformers are nothing less\nthan gluttons. They lay upon the digestive organs so great a burden\nthat the vitality of the system is exhausted in the effort to dispose\nof it. It also has a depressing influence upon the intellect, for the\nbrain nerve power is called upon to assist the stomach in its work.\nOvereating, even of the simplest food, benumbs the sensitive nerves\nof the brain and weakens its vitality. Overeating has a worse effect\nupon the system than overworking; the energies of the soul are more\neffectually prostrated by intemperate eating than by intemperate\nworking.\nThe digestive organs should never be burdened with a quantity or\nquality of food which it will tax the system to appropriate. All that\nis taken into the stomach above what the system can use to convert\ninto good blood, clogs the machinery; for it cannot be made into\neither flesh or blood, and its presence burdens the liver and produces [413]\na morbid condition of the system. The stomach is overworked in its\nefforts to dispose of it, and then there is a sense of languor, which\nis interpreted to mean hunger; and without allowing the digestive\norgans time to rest from their severe labor, to recruit their energies,\nanother immoderate amount is taken into the stomach, to set the\nweary machinery again in motion. The system receives less nour-\nishment from too great a quantity of food, even of the right quality,\nthan from a moderate quantity taken at regular periods.\nMy brother, your brain is benumbed. A man who disposes of\nthe quantity of food that you do should be a laboring man. Exercise\nis important to digestion and to a healthy condition of body and\nmind. You need physical exercise. You move and act as if you were\nwooden, as though you had no elasticity. Healthy, active exercise\nis what you need. This will invigorate the mind. Neither study nor\nviolent exercise should be engaged in immediately after a full meal;\nthis would be a violation of the laws of the system. Immediately\nafter eating there is a strong draft upon the nervous energy. The brain\nforce is called into active exercise to assist the stomach; therefore,\nwhen the mind or body is taxed heavily after eating, the process of\ndigestion is hindered. The vitality of the system, which is needed to\ncarry on the work in one direction, is called away and set to work in\nanother.\n366 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nYou need to exercise temperance in all things. Cultivate the\nhigher powers of the mind, and there will be less strength of growth\nof the animal. It is impossible for you to increase in spiritual strength\nwhile your appetite and passions are not under perfect control. Says\nthe inspired apostle: \u201cI keep under my body, and bring it into sub-\njection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I\nmyself should be a castaway.\u201d\nMy brother, arouse yourself, I pray you, and let the work of[414]\nthe Spirit of God reach deeper than the external; let it reach down\nto the deep springs of every action. It is principle that is wanted,\nfirm principle, and vigor of action in spiritual as well as temporal\nthings. Your efforts lack earnestness. Oh, how many are low in the\nscale of spirituality because they will not deny their appetite! The\nbrain nerve energy is benumbed and almost paralyzed by overeating.\nWhen such go to the house of God upon the Sabbath, they cannot\nhold their eyes open. The most earnest appeals fail to arouse their\nleaden, insensible intellects. The truth may be presented with deep\nfeeling, but it does not awaken the moral sensibilities or enlighten\nthe understanding. Have such studied to glorify God in all things?\nIt is impossible to have clear conceptions of eternal things unless\nthe mind is trained to dwell upon elevated themes. All the passions\nmust be brought under perfect subjection to the moral powers. When\nmen and women profess strong faith and earnest spirituality, I know\nthat their profession is false if they have not brought all their passions\nunder control. God requires this. The reason why such spiritual\ndarkness prevails is that the mind is content to take a low level and\nis not directed upward in a pure, holy, and heavenly channel.\nI saw in regard to your family, Brother M, that you were not\nhappy. Your wife has been disappointed, and you have been disap-\npointed. Your wife expected to find in you a person of more noble,\nrefined organization. She has been very unhappy. She has a large\namount of pride. Her family connections upon her mother\u2019s side\nare naturally conscientious, yet proud and aristocratic. She partakes\nlargely of these traits of character. She is not demonstrative. It is not\nnatural for her to make advances and manifest affection. She looks\nupon the manifestation of affection between husband and wife as\nweak and childish. She has felt that if she encouraged affection, it\nwould not be answered by fine, elevated love, but by the lower order[415]\nTrue Love at Home 367\nof passions; that these would be strengthened, but not pure, deep,\nholy love.\nYour wife should make strong efforts to come out of her retired,\ndignified reserve, and cultivate simplicity in all her actions. And\nwhen the higher order of faculties is aroused in you, and strengthened\nby exercise, you will better understand the wants of women; you\nwill understand that the soul craves love of a higher, purer order than\nexists in the low order of animal passions. These passions have been\nstrengthened in you by encouragement and exercise. If now in the\nfear of God you keep your body under, and seek to meet your wife\nwith pure, elevated love, the wants of her nature will be met. Take\nher to your heart; esteem her highly.\nYou have been exalted and have taken a position above your\nwife. You have not understood yourself. You have had a high\nappreciation of your religious experience and advancement in the\ndivine life. These things have hindered, instead of helping, your\nwife. She feared for you, feared that you did not really understand\nyourself, and that you would go too fast. Your union has not been\nhappy. You have been unsuited to each other. Your wife has a timid,\nfearful, shrinking nature. You have utterly failed to understand her.\nShe hesitates and fears to move out because she is afraid of going\ntoo fast. She needs confidence in herself and should encourage\nindependence.\nBrother M, you fail to encourage the confidence of your wife.\nYou are lacking in courteousness and in constant, kindly regard\nfor her. You sometimes manifest love, but it is a selfish love. It\nis not principle with you, reaching down deep and underlying all\nyour actions. It is not an unselfish love, which prompts a continual\nforethought for her and a care to have her in your society, showing\nher that you prefer her company above all others. You have sought [416]\nfor your own amusement, leaving her at home lonely and often\nsad. You pursued this course before moving to this place and have\ncontinued to do so since in a less degree for want of opportunity or\nexcuse.\nYour wife would scorn to let you know that she marked the\ndeficiencies in you. She has a fear of you. Had you possessed\ngenuine love, which such a nature as hers requires, you would have\nfound an answering chord in her heart. You are too cold and stiff.\n368 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nYou have at times manifested affection, but it has not awakened love\nin return because you have not been courteous and attentive, and\nmanifested a kind regard for your wife by consulting her happiness.\nYou have too many times felt at liberty to saunter off in pursuit of\nyour own pleasure without consulting her pleasure or happiness at\nall.\nTrue, pure love is precious. It is heavenly in its influence. It is\ndeep and abiding. It is not spasmodic in its manifestations. It is not\na selfish passion. It bears fruit. It will lead to a constant effort to\nmake your wife happy. If you have this love, it will come natural to\nmake this effort. It will not appear to be forced. If you go out for a\nwalk or to attend a meeting, it will be as natural as your breath to\nchoose your wife to accompany you and to seek to make her happy\nin your society. You regard her spiritual attainments as inferior to\nyour own, but I saw that God was better pleased with her spirit than\nwith that possessed by yourself. You are not worthy of your wife.\nShe is too good for you. She is a frail, sensitive plant; she needs to\nbe cared for tenderly. She earnestly desires to do the will of God.\nBut she has a proud spirit, and is timid, shrinking from reproach. It\nis as death to her to be the subject of observation or remark. Let your\nwife be loved, honored, and cherished, in fulfillment of the marriage\nvow, and she will come out of that reticent, diffident position which\nis natural to her.\nOnly let a woman realize that she is appreciated by her husband[417]\nand is precious to him, not merely because she is useful and con-\nvenient in his house, but because she is a part of himself, and she\nwill respond to his affection and reflect the love bestowed upon her.\nLet your wife be the object of your special and hearty attention.\nWhen you feel as God would have you, you will feel lost without\nthe society of your wife. You think her faith not worth having, yet it\nwill bring answers sooner than the faith which you possess.\nBrother M, you fail to understand the heart of a woman. You\ndo not reason from cause to effect. You know that your wife is\nnot so cheerful and happy as you wish to see her, but you do not\ninvestigate the cause. You do not analyze your deportment to see\nif the difficulty does not exist in yourself. Love your wife. She is\nhungering for deep, true, elevating love. Let her have tangible proof\nthat her care and interest for you, shown in her attention to your\nTrue Love at Home 369\ncomfort, is appreciated and returned. Seek her opinion and approval\nin whatever you engage in. Respect her judgment. Do not feel that\nyou know all that is worth knowing.\nA house with love in it, where love is expressed in words and\nlooks and deeds, is a place where angels love to manifest their\npresence, and hallow the scene by rays of light from glory. There\nthe humble household duties have a charm in them. None of life\u2019s\nduties will be unpleasant to your wife under such circumstances.\nShe will perform them with cheerfulness of spirit and will be like\na sunbeam to all around her, and she will be making melody in her\nheart to the Lord. At present she feels that she has not your heart\u2019s\naffections. You have given her occasion to feel thus. You perform\nthe necessary duties devolving upon you as head of the family, but\nthere is a lack. There is a serious lack of love\u2019s precious influence\nwhich leads to kindly attentions. Love should be seen in the looks\nand manners, and heard in the tones of the voice.\nYour wife does not venture to open her heart to you; for as soon [418]\nas she utters a sentiment differing from you, you repel it. You talk\nso strong that she has no courage to say another word. You are\nnot one in heart. You take a position above her and maintain a\nbearing as though her judgment and opinion were of no account.\nYou consider your spiritual attainments far in advance of hers. My\nbrother, you do not know yourself. God looks at the heart, not at the\nwords or profession. The externals do not weigh with God as with\nmen. A humble heart and a contrite spirit God values. Our Saviour\nis acquainted with the life conflicts of every soul. He judgeth not\naccording to appearances, but righteously.\nYour spirit is strong. When you take a position you do not\nweigh the matter well and consider what must be the effect of your\nmaintaining your views and in an independent manner weaving them\ninto your prayers and conversation, when you know that your wife\ndoes not hold the same views that you do. Instead of respecting the\nfeelings of your wife, and kindly avoiding, as a gentleman would,\nthose subjects upon which you know you differ, you have been\nforward to dwell upon objectionable points, and have manifested a\npersistency in expressing your views regardless of any around you.\nYou have felt that others had no right to see matters differently from\nyourself. These fruits do not grow upon the Christian tree.\n370 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nIn the case of Sister N, you did not view things in their true\nlight. If she had been healed in answer to the prayers of yourself\nand others, it would have proved the ruin of more than two or three\nof you. A wise God had oversight of this matter. He could read the\nmotives and purposes of the heart.\nYour wife has just as much right to her opinion as you have to\nyours. Her marriage relation does not destroy her identity. She has\nan individual responsibility. You will not feel clear till you take[419]\nthings out of her way and manifest toward her a more charitable,\nChristlike spirit of forbearance, and regard others in the light in\nwhich you wish to be regarded. You have yet to learn to \u201clet nothing\nbe done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each\nesteem other better than themselves.\u201d \u201cBe kindly affectioned one\nto another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another; not\nslothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\u201d\nConducting Social Meetings\nI was shown, Brother M, that you need a great work done for you\nbefore you can exert an influence in the church to correct their errors\nor bring them up. You do not possess that humbleness of mind that\ncan reach the hearts of God\u2019s people. You are exalted. You need to\nexamine your motives and your actions to see if your eye is single\nto the glory of God. Neither Brother O nor you is exactly fitted to\nmeet the wants of the youth and the church generally. You do not\ncome right down in simplicity to understand the best manner to help\nthem. It does not have the best influence for you and Brother O to\nleave your seats and take your position upon the platform in front\nof the people. When you occupy that position, you feel that you\nmust say or do something in accordance with the position you have\ntaken. Instead of getting up and speaking a few words to the point,\nyou frequently make lengthy remarks, which really hurt the spirit of\nthe meeting. Many feel relieved when you sit down. Were you in a\ncountry place where there were but few to improve the time, such\nlengthy remarks would be more appropriate.\nThe work of the Lord is a great work, and wise men are needed\nto engage in it. Men are wanted who can adapt themselves to the\nwants of the people. If you expect to help the people you must not[420]\nTrue Love at Home 371\ntake your position above them, but right down among them. This\nis Brother O\u2019s great fault. He is too stiff. It is not natural for him\nto use simplicity. He does not reason from cause to effect. He will\nnot win affection and love. He does not come right down to the\nunderstanding of the children and speak in a touching manner which\nwill melt its way to the heart. He stands up and talks to the children\nin a wise way, but it does them no good. His remarks are generally\nlengthy and wearisome. Sometimes if but one fourth were said that\nis said, a much better impression would be left on the mind.\nThose who instruct children should avoid tedious remarks. Short\nremarks and to the point will have a happy influence. If much is\nto be said, make up for briefness by frequency. A few words of\ninterest now and then will be more beneficial than to have it all\nat once. Long speeches burden the small minds of children. Too\nmuch talk will lead them to loathe even spiritual instruction, just\nas overeating burdens the stomach and lessens the appetite, leading\neven to a loathing of food. The minds of the people may be glutted\nwith too much speechifying. Labor for the church, but especially\nfor the youth, should be line upon line, precept upon precept, here\na little, and there a little. Give minds time to digest the truths you\nfeed them. Children must be drawn toward heaven, not rashly, but\nvery gently.\nBattle Creek, Michigan,\nOctober 2, 1868.\nChapter 56\u2014Importance of Self-Government[421]\nDear Brother P ,\nI have several times attempted to write to you, but have as often\nbeen hindered. I will delay no longer. I have felt for a few days past\nespecially anxious in regard to you. Last June some things were\nshown me in regard to you. I was carried back in the past and shown\nyour unsettled, roving life. You were without God. Yours has been\na hard, reckless life. Yet I saw that God had in mercy spared your\nlife many times when it seemed that no human power or wisdom\ncould preserve it. You now stand a miracle of mercy. When your\nlife has been in imminent peril, Christ, your Advocate, has pleaded\nin your behalf: \u201cFather, spare his life a little longer. He has been an\nunfruitful tree, which has cumbered the ground; yet cut it not down.\nI will patiently wait a little longer, and see if it will not bear fruit. I\nwill impress his heart with the truth. I will convict him of sin.\u201d\nI was shown that the Lord opened the way for you to obey and\nserve Him. Your steps were directed West, where your surroundings\nwould be more favorable to a growth in grace, and where it would be\nless difficult for you to form a character for heaven. You came into\nour family and were received into our hearts. This was all ordered of\nthe Lord. You had not the experience which was necessary in order\nto live a life that God would approve. You were situated where in\na few short months you could obtain more light and a more correct\nknowledge of present truth than you could have obtained in years if\nyou had remained East.\nOur compassionate High Priest was acquainted with your weak-\nness and your errors and did not leave you in your inexperience to\nbattle with the great foe amid unfavorable surroundings. Had you\nremained in ----- you would not have retained the truth. The opposi-[422]\ntion you would have received would have raised your combativeness,\nand you would have dishonored the truth by a hasty spirit; and then,\nas obstacles arose in your Christian journey, you would have become\ndiscouraged and yielded the truth. You have much to be thankful\n372\nImportance of Self-Government 373\nfor. Your heart should be filled with gratitude to your loving Saviour\nfor His mercy to you, to you who have so long abused His love.\nI was shown that you were a rough stone from the quarry, which\nneeded much hewing, squaring, and polishing before it could fill a\nplace in the heavenly building. Some of this work has been done\nfor you; but, oh, there is a much greater work yet to be done! You\nhave had a very unhappy spirit. You have seen the rough side of\nlife. You have not had much happiness; but you were the one who\nstood in your own light, debarring yourself from good. In your youth\nyou encouraged a spirit of discontent; you would not be ruled; you\nchose to walk in your own way, irrespective of others\u2019 judgment or\ncounsel. You would not submit to be controlled by your stepfather,\nbecause you wanted to follow your own way. He did not understand\nthe best way to manage you, and you were determined not to respect\nhis authority. As soon as he would speak to you, you would place\nyourself upon the defensive. Your combativeness was large, and\nyou would battle everything and everybody that crossed your plans.\nEven when suggestions were made of a better course to pursue in\nyour plans and labors, you would fly in an instant. You thought\nyou were censured, thought you were blamed, and felt grieved with\nthose who were your true friends. Your imagination was diseased.\nYou thought that everybody was against you and that your lot was\nexceedingly hard. It has been hard, but you have made it so.\nYour course toward your stepfather was unbecoming. He did\nnot deserve to be treated by you as he was. He had faults and had [423]\ncommitted errors, but while you were awake to see these in an\naggravated light you did not see your own errors. In the providence\nof God your wife was prostrated by disease. She was a proud-\nspirited woman; but she repented of her sins, and her repentance was\naccepted of God.\nYour way has been hedged up, on the right hand and on the\nleft, to hinder your progress to perdition. The Lord has brought\nyour unruly, untamable spirit to submit to Him. By a mixture of\njudgment and mercy you have been brought to repentance. Like\nJonah, you fled from present duty to sea. God hedged up your way\nby the visitations of His providence. You could not prosper or be\nhappy, because you could not leave yourself behind. You took self\nand sin with you. You cherished a discontented, restless spirit and\n374 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwould not do the duties in your path. You wanted a change, some\nlarger work. You became roving in disposition.\nThe eye of the dear Saviour has been upon you, or you would\nhave been left in your unsettled state, and in your sins, to become\nabandoned in character and miserable in circumstances. While in\nthe land of strangers and in the hour of sickness, you have sadly felt\nyour forlorn, desolate condition. You have passed long nights and\nweary days of restlessness and pain, away from your mother and\nsisters, with none but stranger hands to do a kindly office for you,\nand no Christian hope to sustain you.\nYou were seeking after happiness, but did not obtain it. You\nhad neglected the advice of your mother and her entreaties not to\nviolate the commands of God. At times this neglect has caused you\nbitterness of spirit. But I cannot enter into every particular, for I am\nnot strong. I will dwell upon the most essential things shown me.\nI saw that a work is before you which you do not comprehend. It\nis to die to self, to crucify self. You have a quick, impetuous temper,[424]\nwhich you must subdue. You possess noble traits of character, which\nwill secure you friends if your hasty spirit does not wound. You\nhave a strong attachment for those who manifest an interest for you.\nWhen you comprehend things aright you are conscientious; but you\noften move from impulse, without stopping to reflect.\nYou pass your judgment upon individuals, and comment upon\ntheir ways and manners, when you do not understand their position or\ntheir work. You view things from your standpoint and then are ready\nto question or condemn the course they pursue, without candidly\nviewing matters on all sides. You have no knowledge of the duties\nof others and should not feel responsible for their acts, but do your\nduty, leaving others with the Lord. Possess your spirit in patience,\npreserve peace and calmness of mind, and be thankful.\nI saw that the Lord had given you light and experience, that you\nmight see the sinfulness of a hasty spirit and control your passions.\nSo surely as you fail to do this, just so surely you will fail of ever-\nlasting life. You must overcome this disease of the imagination. You\nare extremely sensitive, and if a word is spoken favoring an opposite\ncourse from that which you have been pursuing, you are hurt. You\nfeel that you are blamed, and that you must defend yourself, save\nyour life; and in your earnest effort to save your life, you lose it. You\nImportance of Self-Government 375\nhave a work to do to die to self and to cultivate a spirit of forbearance\nand patience. Get over the idea that you are not used right, that you\nare wronged, that somebody wants to crowd or harm you. You see\nthrough false eyes. Satan leads you to take these distorted views of\nthings.\nDear Brother P, at Adams Center your case was again shown me.\nI saw that you had ever failed to exercise true self-government. You\nhave made efforts; but these efforts have only reached the external,\nthey have not touched the spring of action. Your hasty temper often [425]\ncauses you sincere and painful regret and self-condemnation. This\npassionate spirit, unless subdued, will increase to a peevish, fault-\nfinding spirit; indeed, this is already upon you in a degree. You will\nbe ready to resent everything. If jostled upon the sidewalk, you will\nbe offended, and a word of complaint will spring to your lips. When\ndriving in the street, if full half the road is not given you, you will\nfeel stirred in a moment. If asked to put yourself out of your course\nto accommodate others, you will chafe and fret, and feel that your\ndignity is imposed upon. You will show to all your besetting sin.\nYour very countenance will indicate an impatient spirit, and your\nmouth will seem always ready to utter an angry word. In this habit,\nas in tobacco using, total abstinence is the only sure remedy. An\nentire change must take place in you. You frequently feel that you\nmust be more guarded. You resolutely say, \u201cI will be more calm and\npatient;\u201d but in doing this you only touch the evil on the outside;\nyou consent to retain the lion and watch him. You must go further\nthan this. Strength of principle alone can dislodge this destroying\nfoe and bring peace and happiness.\nYou have repeatedly said: \u201cI can\u2019t keep my temper.\u201d \u201cI have to\nspeak.\u201d You lack a meek, humble spirit. Self is all alive, and you\nstand guard continually to preserve it from mortification or insult.\nSays the apostle: \u201cFor ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ\nin God.\u201d Those who are dead to self will not feel so readily and will\nnot be prepared to resist everything which may irritate. Dead men\ncannot feel. You are not dead. If you were, and your life were hid in\nChrist, a thousand things which you now notice, and which afflict\nyou, would be passed by as unworthy of notice; you would then be\ngrasping the eternal and would be above the petty trials of this life.\n\u201cThe tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity.\u201d \u201cThe discretion of a [426]\n376 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nman deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgres-\nsion.\u201d \u201cHe that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that\nis hasty of spirit exalteth folly.\u201d \u201cHe that is slow to anger is better\nthan the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a\ncity.\u201d \u201cWherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to\nhear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: for the wrath of man worketh\nnot the righteousness of God.\u201d \u201cHe that hath knowledge spareth his\nwords: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.\u201d Margin,\n\u201ca cool spirit.\u201d\nOur great Exemplar was exalted to be equal with God. He was\nhigh commander in heaven. All the holy angels delighted to bow\nbefore Him. \u201cAnd again, when He bringeth in the First-begotten\ninto the world, He saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him.\u201d\nJesus took upon Himself our nature, laid aside His glory, majesty,\nand riches to perform his mission, to save that which was lost. He\ncame not to be ministered unto, but to minister unto others. Jesus,\nwhen reviled, abused, and insulted, did not retaliate. \u201cWho, when\nHe was reviled, reviled not again.\u201d When the cruelty of man caused\nHim to suffer painful stripes and wounds, He threatened not, but\ncommitted Himself to Him who judgeth righteously. The apostle\nPaul exhorted his Philippian brethren: \u201cLet this mind be in you,\nwhich was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God,\nthought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made Himself of\nno reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was\nmade in the likeness of men.\u201d Is the servant greater than his master?\nChrist has given us His life as a pattern, and we dishonor Him when\nwe become jealous of every slight, and are ready to resent every\ninjury, supposed or real. It is not an evidence of a noble mind to\nbe prepared to defend self, to preserve our own dignity. We would\nbetter suffer wrongfully a hundred times than wound the soul by a[427]\nspirit of retaliation, or by giving vent to wrath. There is strength to\nbe obtained of God. He can help. He can give grace and heavenly\nwisdom. If you ask in faith, you will receive; but you must watch\nunto prayer. Watch, pray, work, should be your watchword.\nYour wife might be a blessing if she would only take upon her\nthe responsibility that it is her duty to take. But she has shunned\nresponsibility all her life, and now is in danger of being influenced,\ninstead of influencing you. Instead of having a softening, elevating\nImportance of Self-Government 377\ninfluence upon you, there is danger of her thinking as you think,\nand acting as you act, without reaching down deep to be guided by\nprinciple in all her actions. You sympathize with each other, and,\nunfortunately, help each other to view matters incorrectly. She can\nexert an influence for good, but she possesses a spirit which savors\nof spiritual indolence and sloth. She is reluctant to engage in any\ngood work if it is not pleasant and agreeable. What was the sin of\nMeroz? Doing nothing. It was not because of great crimes that they\nwere condemned, but because they did not come up to the help of\nthe Lord.\nI was shown that your wife does not understand herself. She\nshunned caretaking in her youth and is not disposed to engage in it\neven now. She is inclined to lean upon others, rather than upon her\nown powers. She has not encouraged a noble independence. She\nshould, for years back, have been educating herself to bear burdens.\nShe is not in health. She is predisposed to torpidity of the liver and\nis not inclined to exercise. She has not the faculty of setting herself\nto work unless she sees that she must. She eats nearly double the\namount which she ought to eat. All that she takes into her stomach,\nabove that which her system can convert into good blood, becomes\nwaste matter, to burden nature in the disposal of it. Her system is [428]\nclogged with a mass of matter which hinders her in her work, clogs\nthe machinery, and weakens the life forces.\nTaking more food into the system than it can convert into good\nblood causes a depraved quality of blood and taxes the vitality to a\nmuch greater degree than labor or physical exercise. This overeating\ncauses a dull stupor. The brain nerves are called upon to aid the\ndigestive organs, and are thus constantly overtaxed, weakened, and\nbenumbed. This leaves a sense of dullness in the head, and makes\nyour wife liable to a shock of paralysis any day. What she requires\nis not encouragement to cease exercise. There would be nothing so\ndangerous for her as to remain where her physical powers would\nnot be called into active exercise. Physical exercise is very essential.\nThis will strengthen her body and mind. When she awakes to the\nresponsibility of her position, and sees the benefit which will result\nfrom her seeking to have an aim in life, she will not be so disposed\nto sink down in indolence and to shun hardships. She does not put\nher heart into what she does; therefore she moves about too much\n378 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nlike a machine, feeling that labor is a burden. She cannot, while she\nfeels thus, realize that new life and vigor which it is her privilege\nto have. She lacks spirit and energy. She is too much inclined to\nbe lost in dullness and leaden insensibility. The heavy torpor she\nfeels can only be overcome by a spare diet, perfect control over her\nappetite and all her passions, and by calling her will to aid her in\ntaking exercise. She wants the will to electrify the nerve power so\nthat she may resist indolence.\nSister P, you never can be of use in the world unless your pur-\nposes are strong enough to enable you to overcome this unwilling-\nness to take care and bear burdens. As you daily exercise the forces\nwithin you, the task will grow less difficult, until it will become\nsecond nature for you to do duty, to be careful and diligent. You\ncan accustom yourself to think, when you lay less burden upon your[429]\nstomach. This burden taxes the brain.\nYou should also have an aim, a purpose, in life. Where there is\nno purpose, there is a disposition to indolence, but where there is\na sufficiently important object in view, all the powers of the mind\nwill come into spontaneous activity. In order to make life a success,\nthe thoughts must be steadily fixed upon the object of life, and\nnot left to wander off and be occupied with unimportant things,\nor to be satisfied with idle musing, which is the fruit of shunning\nresponsibility. Castle-building depraves the mind.\nTake up present duty. Do it with a will, with all the heart. You\nshould resolve to do something which will require an effort of the\nmental as well as the physical powers. Your heart should be in your\npresent labor. The duty now before you is the very work which\nHeaven wishes you to do. To dream of a work far off, and imagine\nand plan in regard to the future, will prove unprofitable, and will\nunfit you for the work, small though it may be, which Heaven now\nplaces before you. It should not be your study to do some great\nwork, but to do cheerfully and well the work which you see to do\ntoday. Talents are entrusted to your care, to be doubled. You are\nresponsible for their proper use or their abuse. You are not to aspire\nafter great things in order to do great service, but to do your little\nwork. Improve your talents, even though they are few, and let a\nsense of your responsibility to God for their right use rest upon you.\nImportance of Self-Government 379\nYou need not expect to avoid pain and weariness in the toils and\ntrials of life. The Son of God was partaker of the human frame. He\nwas frequently wearied in body and spirit. Said He: \u201cI must work\nthe works of Him that sent Me, while it is day: the night cometh,\nwhen no man can work.\u201d You should cease your far-off dreaming,\nand bring your mind to present duties, and cheerfully perform them.\nThis world is not the Christian\u2019s heaven. It is merely the fitting- [430]\nup place. It is the scene of our life battles, our conflicts and sorrows;\nand it is important that we all have a firm grasp of the better world,\nwhere will be found, when the warfare is ended, peace, joy, and\nbliss, to be enjoyed forever. I saw that you would both be in greater\ndanger of making shipwreck of faith were you united, because you\nwould look upon matters in a false light. You both have a great work\nto do for yourselves, but you are in danger of blinding your eyes to\neach other\u2019s faults.\nSister P should be guarded so as not to stir up the hasty spirit of\nher husband by relating her supposed grievances to him to obtain\nsympathy. He views things in a strong light and feels deeply over\nmatters which are not worthy of notice. She will have to learn this\nand understand that it is wisdom to be silent. She needs the power of\nendurance. It is much easier to throw a thing into the mind than to\nget it out when once it is there. It is easier to dwell upon a supposed\nwrong than to pacify or control the feelings when once aroused.\nBrother P has qualities which would be excellent if they were\nrefined by the elevating influences of pure religion. He can be useful.\nSincere piety alone can qualify him to perform his duties well in\nthis world and give him a fitness for heaven. A heavenly character\nmust be acquired upon earth, my brother, or you will never possess\nit; therefore you should engage at once in the work which you have\nto do. You should labor earnestly to obtain a fitness for heaven. Live\nfor heaven. Live by faith.\nBrother P, you are a rough stone; but the hand of a skillful\nworkman is upon you. Will you let Him hew and square you, and\npolish you for that building which is coming together without the\nsound of ax or hammer? Not a blow is to be struck after probation\ncloses. You must now, in the hours of probation, overcome your [431]\nimpetuous temper, or be separated from God at last.\n380 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nJesus loves you both and will save you if you will be saved in\nHis own appointed way. You may have experimental religion if you\nreally hunger and thirst for it. Go to God in faith and humility, and\nask, and you will receive; but remember that the disciple is not above\nhis Master nor the servant greater than his Lord. You need to cherish\nthat humility and humbleness of mind which dwelt in Christ.\nBattle Creek, Michigan,\nFebruary 9, 1869.\n* * * * *\nChapter 57\u2014Industry and Economy\nDear Brother and Sister R,\nI have been seeking an opportunity to write to you, but have\nbeen sick, and unable to write to anyone. But I will try to write a\nfew lines this morning.\nAs I was shown the duties resting upon God\u2019s people in regard\nto the poor, especially the widows and orphans, I was shown that my\nhusband and I were in danger of taking upon us burdens which God\nhas not laid upon us, and thereby lessening our courage and strength\nby increasing our cares and anxiety. I saw that my husband went\nfarther in your case than it was his duty to go. His interest in you led\nhim to take a burden which carried him beyond his duty, and which\nhas been no benefit to you, but has encouraged in you a disposition\nto depend upon your brethren. You look to them to help and favor\nyou, while you do not labor as hard as they, nor economize at all\ntimes as they feel it their duty to do.\nI was shown that you, my brother and sister, have much to learn.\nYou have not lived within your means. You have not learned to\neconomize. If you earn high wages, you do not know how to make\nit go as far as possible. You consult taste or appetite instead of\nprudence. At times you expend money for a quality of food in which [432]\nyour brethren cannot afford to indulge. Dollars slip from your pocket\nvery easily.\nSister R is in poor health. She indulges her appetite and places\ntoo heavy a tax upon her stomach. She burdens it by overeating and\nby placing in it a quality of food not best calculated to nourish her\nsystem. Her food is taken in immoderate quantities, and she takes\nbut little exercise; thus the system is severely taxed. According to\nthe light which the Lord has given us, simple food is the best to\nensure health and strength. Exercise is necessary to her health.\nSelf-denial is a lesson which you both have yet to learn. Restrict\nyour appetite, Brother R. God has given you a capital of strength.\nThis is of more value to you than money and should be more highly\n381\n382 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nprized. Strength cannot be purchased with gold or silver, houses or\nlands. It is a great possession that you have. God requires you to\nmake a judicious use of the capital of strength with which He has\nblessed you. You are just as much His steward as is the man who\nhas a capital of money. It is as wrong for you to fail to use your\nstrength to the best advantage as it is for a rich man to covetously\nretain his riches because it is agreeable to do so. You do not make\nthe exertion that you should to support your family. You can and do\nwork if work is conveniently prepared to hand, but you do not exert\nyourself to set yourself to work feeling that it is a duty to use your\ntime and strength to the very best advantage and in the fear of God.\nYou have been in a business which would at times yield you\nlarge profits at once. After you have earned means you have not\nstudied to economize in reference to a time when means could not\nbe earned so easily, but have expended much for imaginary wants.\nHad you and your wife understood it to be a duty that God enjoined\nupon you to deny your taste and your desires, and make provision\nfor the future instead of living merely for the present, you could now\nhave had a competency and your family have had the comforts of[433]\nlife. You have a lesson to learn which you should not be backward\nin learning. It is to make a little go the longest way.\nSister R has leaned too heavily upon her husband. She has been\nall her life too dependent upon others for sympathy, thinking of\nherself, making herself a center. She has been petted too much, and\nhas not learned to be self-reliant. She has not been the help to her\nhusband that she might have been in temporal or spiritual things.\nShe must learn to bear bodily infirmities and not dwell upon them as\nshe does. She must fight the battles of life for herself; an individual\nresponsibility rests upon her.\nSister R, your life has been a mistake. You have indulged in\nreading anything and everything. Your mind has not been benefited\nby so much reading. Your nerves have been excited while hurriedly\nchasing through the story. If your children interrupt you while thus\nemployed, you speak fretfully, impatiently. You do not have self-\ncontrol, and therefore fail to hold your children with a firm, steady\nhand. You move from impulse. You pet and indulge them, and\nthen fret and scold, and are severe. This variable manner is very\nIndustry and Economy 383\ndetrimental to them. They need a firm, steady hand; for they are\nwayward. They need regular, wise, judicious discipline.\nYou might save yourself much perplexity if you would put on\nthe woman and move from principle, not from impulse. You have\nimagined that your husband must be with you, that you could not\nstay alone. You should see that his duty is to labor to sustain his\nfamily. You should bring yourself to deny your desires and wishes,\nand not lead him to feel that he must accommodate himself to you.\nYou have a part to act in bearing the burdens of life. You must put\non courage and fortitude. Be a woman, not a capricious child. You\nhave been petted and have had your burdens borne for you too long.\nIt is now your duty to seek to deny your wishes and desires, and act [434]\nfrom principle, for the present and future good of your family. You\nare not well; but if you should cultivate a contented, cheerful mind,\nit would help you to a better hold on this life, and also on the life to\ncome.\nBrother R, it is your duty to make a careful, judicious use of the\ncapital of strength which God has given you.\nSister R, your brain is wearied and taxed by reading. You should\ndeny your propensity for crowding your mind with everything it\ncan devour. Your lifetime has not been spent in the best manner.\nYou have not benefited yourself, nor those around you. You have\nleaned on your mother more than has been for your good. If you\nhad depended more upon the powers within yourself, if you had\nbeen more self-reliant, you would have been happier. Now you\nshould bear your own burdens as well as you can, and encourage\nyour husband to bear his in doing his work.\nIf you had denied your taste for reading and seeking to please\nyourself, had devoted more time to prudent physical exercise, and\nhad eaten carefully of proper, healthful food, you would have\navoided much suffering. A part of this suffering has been imag-\ninary. If you had braced your mind to resist the disposition to yield\nto infirmities, you would not have had nervous spasms. Your mind\nshould be drawn away from yourself to household duties, keeping\nyour house with order, neatness, and taste. Much reading, and per-\nmitting your mind to be diverted with small things, has led to a\nneglect of your children and your household duties. These are the\nvery duties which God has given you to perform.\n384 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nYou have had much sympathy for yourself. You have called your\nmind to yourself and have dwelt upon your poor feelings. My sister,\neat less. Engage in physical labor, and devote your mind to spiritual\nthings. Keep your mind from dwelling upon yourself. Cultivate\na contented, cheerful spirit. You talk too much upon unimportant[435]\nthings. You gain no spiritual strength from this. If the strength\nspent in talking were devoted to prayer, you would receive spiritual\nstrength and would make melody in your heart to God.\nYou have been controlled by feeling, not by duty and principle.\nYou have given up to homesick feelings and injured your health by\nindulging a spirit of unrest. Your habits of life are not healthful. You\nneed to reform. Neither of you is willing to work as others work, or\nto eat as your brethren eat. If it is in your power to get things, you\nhave them. It is your duty to economize.\nIn contrast with your case was presented that of Sister S. She\nis in feeble health, and has two children to support with her needle\nat the very low prices which are paid for her work. For years she\nreceived scarcely a farthing of help. She suffered with ill health, yet\nshe carried her own burdens. Here was an object of charity indeed.\nNow look at your case. A man with a small family and a good capital\nof strength, yet constantly involved in debt and leaning upon others.\nThis is all wrong. You have lessons to learn. With Sister S, economy\nis the battle of life. Here you are with a man\u2019s strong energies, and\nyet are not self-sustaining. You have a work to do. You should have\nuniformity of diet. Live at all times as simply as your brethren live.\nLive out the health reform.\nJesus wrought a miracle and fed five thousand, and then He\ntaught an important lesson of economy: \u201cGather up the fragments\nthat remain, that nothing be lost.\u201d Duties, important duties, rest upon\nyou. \u201cOwe no man anything.\u201d Were you infirm, were you unable\nto labor, then your brethren would be in duty bound to help you.\nAs it is, all you needed from your brethren when you changed your\nlocation was a start. If you felt as ambitious as you should, and you\nand your wife would agree to live within your means, you could be\nfree from embarrassment. You will have to labor for small wages[436]\nas well as for large. Industry and economy would have placed your\nfamily, ere this, in a much more favorable condition. God wants you\nIndustry and Economy 385\nto be a faithful steward of your strength. He wants you to use it to\nplace your family above want and dependence.\nBattle Creek, Michigan,\nMarch 22, 1869.\n* * * * *\nChapter 58\u2014Stirring Up Opposition\nDear Sister T,\nI have been shown that there has been a fault in your religious\nlife. You have possessed too much of a combative spirit. While it\nis your privilege to think and act for yourself, you have carried the\nmatter too far. You have had more independence than humility. You\nhave pursued a course to irritate rather than to pacify. It has been\nnecessary for you to possess firmness in order to stand in defense of\nthe truth; yet you have frequently erred in not possessing that meek\nand quiet spirit which God esteems of great price. In your family\nyou have met with opposition and a manifest disrelish of the truth,\nbut you have failed to meet these trials in the best manner. You have\ntalked too much and been too positive. You have mingled too little\nlove and tenderness with your efforts for your family, especially for\nyour husband. You are in danger of carrying points to extremes,\noverdoing the matter, and hurting instead of healing. Wherever you\ncan yield your judgment and not sacrifice the principles of truth,\nit is best for you to do so, even if you think you are right. You\nhave a responsibility, an identity, which cannot be merged in your\nhusband. Yet there is a bond which makes you one, and in many\nthings, if you were more yielding, it would be far better for your\nhusband, your children, and yourself. You are too exacting. You do[437]\nnot seek to win those who differ with you. You are quick to discern\nwhen you have the advantage, and you make the most of it. If you\npossessed more forbearance mingled with sweet love, and if you\nshould for Christ\u2019s sake pass over many things without taking them\nup and pressing them home, thus creating uncomfortable feelings,\nthe influence would be better, more saving. You need love, tender\npity, and affection.\nYou see the truth, and then you mark out how this one and that\none should practice it; and if they fail to come up to the mark you set,\nyou feel to draw off from them. You cannot fellowship them, and\nlove dies out of your heart for them, when in reality they are just as\n386\nStirring Up Opposition 387\nnear right as you are. You make yourself enemies when you might\nhave friends. You are ardent and positive in your temperament, and\nwhen you see points of truth, you carry matters to extremes. You\nthus repulse persons, instead of winning and binding them to your\nheart. You look upon the objectionable features in the character\nof those with whom you associate, and dwell upon their seeming\ninconsistencies and wrongs, overlooking their redeeming traits. I\nwas referred to this scripture: \u201cFinally, brethren, whatsoever things\nare true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,\nwhatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever\nthings are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any\npraise, think on these things.\u201d Here, dear sister, you may meditate\nand speculate with profit. Dwell upon the good qualities of those\nwith whom you associate, and see as little as possible of their errors\nand failings. You possess too much of a spirit of war, and throw\nthings into confusion and strife. You must change your life and\ncharacter if you are ever classed with those who hear the words:\n\u201cBlessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children\nof God.\u201d Let nothing but kind, loving words fall from your lips [438]\nconcerning the members of your family or of the church.\nYou need to open your heart to love, to that love which dwelt\nin the bosom of Jesus. Should your Saviour deal with you as you\nwould deal with those with whom you differ, you would certainly\nbe in a distressed condition. Your case would be nearly hopeless.\nBut I thank the Lord that we have a merciful high priest who can be\ntouched with the feeling of our infirmities. You have been tried with\nothers, and have pursued a course toward them that Heaven does not\napprove. You have a work to do to let the softening influence of the\ngrace of God into your heart; seek meekness, seek righteousness.\nYou are zealous for the truth. You love it and wish to invest\nsomething in it. This is all right, but be careful that the precepts\nyou give to others are backed up with example. You must seek for\npeace. You can do this and not sacrifice one principle of truth. You\nhave stormed and fought your way through, and now you need to\nsoften your influence, to sweeten, to soothe, instead of stirring up\nopposition. You have possessed a large share of self-confidence\nand self-esteem, and have been self-exalted. Now you need to exalt\n388 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nJesus and imitate the harmless life of Him whom peace everywhere\nfollowed.\nYou, my sister, will prove a trial to God\u2019s people unless you are\nwilling to learn, willing to be counseled. You must not continue to\nfeel that you know it all. You have much yet to learn before you can\nbe perfect before God. The sweetest and best lesson to be learned\nwill be that of humility. \u201cLearn of Me,\u201d says the humble Nazarene;\n\u201cfor I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your\nsouls.\u201d This lesson of meekness, forbearance, patience, and love you\nhave yet to learn and practice. You can be a blessing. You can help\nsuch as need help; but you must lay down your measuring tape, for[439]\nthat is not for you to use. One who is unerring in judgment, who\nunderstands the weakness of our fallen, corrupt natures, holds the\nstandard Himself. He weighs in the balances of the sanctuary, and\nHis just measure we shall all accept.\nYou err in your course toward your husband. You need to culti-\nvate more gentleness and deference toward him. You are exacting.\nYou carry matters to extremes and do harm to your own soul and to\nthe truth. You make the truth repulsive and cause souls to be afraid\nof it. Let love soften your words and give tone to your actions, and\nyou will find a change in those with whom you associate. There\nwill be peace, union, and harmony, instead of strife, jealousy, and\ndiscord. Let love and tenderness be exercised, especially in your\nfamily, and you will receive a blessing.\n* * * * *\nChapter 59\u2014An Appeal to the Church\nOctober 2, 1868, I was shown the state of God\u2019s professed people.\nMany of them were in great darkness, yet seemed to be insensible of\ntheir true condition. The sensibilities of a large number seemed to be\nbenumbed in regard to spiritual and eternal things, while their minds\nseemed all awake to their worldly interests. Many were cherishing\nidols in their hearts and were practicing iniquity which separated\nthem from God and caused them to be bodies of darkness. I saw but\nfew who stood in the light, having discernment and spirituality to\ndiscover these stumbling blocks and remove them out of the way.\nMen who stand in very responsible positions at the heart of the work\nare asleep. Satan has paralyzed them in order that his plans and\ndevices may not be discerned, while he is active to ensnare, deceive,\nand destroy.\nSome who occupy the position of watchmen to warn the people [440]\nof danger have given up their watch and recline at ease. They are\nunfaithful sentinels. They remain inactive, while their wily foe\nenters the fort and works successfully by their side to tear down\nwhat God has commanded to be built up. They see that Satan is\ndeceiving the inexperienced and unsuspecting; yet they take it all\nquietly, as though they had no special interest, as though these things\ndid not concern them. They apprehend no special danger; they see\nno cause to raise an alarm. To them everything seems to be going\nwell, and they see no necessity of raising the faithful, trumpet notes\nof warning which they hear borne by the plain testimonies, to show\nthe people their transgressions and the house of Israel their sins.\nThese reproofs and warnings disturb the quiet of these sleepy, ease-\nloving sentinels, and they are not pleased. They say in heart, if not\nin words: \u201cThis is all uncalled for. It is too severe, too harsh. These\nmen are unnecessarily disturbed and excited, and seem unwilling\nto give us any rest or quietude \u2018Ye take too much upon you, seeing\nall the congregation are holy, every one of them.\u2019 They are not\nwilling that we should have any comfort, peace, or happiness. It is\n389\n390 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nactive labor, toil, and unceasing vigilance alone which will satisfy\nthese unreasonable, hard-to-be-suited watchmen. Why don\u2019t they\nprophesy smooth things, and cry: Peace, peace? Then everything\nwould move on smoothly.\u201d\nThese are the true feelings of many of our people. And Satan\nexults at his success in controlling the minds of so many who profess\nto be Christians. He has deceived them, benumbed their sensibilities,\nand planted his hellish banner right in their midst, and they are so\ncompletely deceived that they know not that it is he. The people have\nnot erected graven images, yet their sin is no less in the sight of God.\nThey worship mammon. They love worldly gain. Some will make\nany sacrifice of conscience to obtain their object. God\u2019s professed\npeople are selfish and self-caring. They love the things of this world,[441]\nand have fellowship with the works of darkness. They have pleasure\nin unrighteousness. They have not love toward God nor love for\ntheir neighbors. They are idolaters, and are worse, far worse, in the\nsight of God than the heathen, graven-image worshipers who have\nno knowledge of a better way.\nChrist\u2019s followers are required to come out from the world, and\nbe separate, and touch not the unclean, and they have the promise\nof being the sons and daughters of the Most High, members of the\nroyal family. But if the conditions are not complied with on their\npart, they will not, cannot, realize the fulfillment of the promise.\nA profession of Christianity is nothing in the sight of God; but\ntrue, humble, willing obedience to His requirements designates the\nchildren of His adoption, the recipients of His grace, the partakers\nof His great salvation. Such will be peculiar, a spectacle unto the\nworld, to angels, and to men. Their peculiar, holy character will be\ndiscernible, and will distinctly separate them from the world, from\nits affections and lust.\nI saw that but few among us answer to this description. Their\nlove to God is in word, not in deed and in truth. Their course of\naction, their works, testify of them that they are not children of the\nlight but of darkness. Their works have not been wrought in God,\nbut in selfishness, in unrighteousness. Their hearts are strangers to\nHis renewing grace. They have not experienced the transforming\npower which leads them to walk even as Christ walked. Those who\nare living branches of the heavenly Vine will partake of the sap and\nAppeal to the Church 391\nnourishment of the Vine. They will not be withered and fruitless\nbranches, but will show life and vigor, and will flourish and bear\nfruit to the glory of God. They will be careful to depart from all\niniquity and to perfect holiness in the fear of God.\nLike ancient Israel the church has dishonored her God by\ndeparting from the light, neglecting her duties, and abusing her [442]\nhigh and exalted privilege of being peculiar and holy in character.\nHer members have violated their covenant to live for God and Him\nonly. They have joined with the selfish and world-loving. Pride,\nthe love of pleasure, and sin have been cherished, and Christ has\ndeparted. His Spirit has been quenched in the church. Satan works\nside by side with professed Christians; yet they are so destitute of\nspiritual discernment that they do not detect him. They have not\nthe burden of the work. The solemn truths they profess to believe\nare not a reality to them. They have not genuine faith. Men and\nwomen will act out all the faith which they in reality possess. By\ntheir fruits ye shall know them. Not their profession, but the fruit\nthey bear, shows the character of the tree. Many have a form of\ngodliness, their names are upon the church records; but they have a\nspotted record in heaven. The recording angel has faithfully written\ntheir deeds. Every selfish act, every wrong word, every unfulfilled\nduty, and every secret sin, with every artful dissembling, is faithfully\nchronicled in the book of records kept by the recording angel.\nVery many who profess to be servants of Christ are none of His.\nThey are deceiving their souls to their own destruction. While they\nprofess to be servants of Christ, they are not living in obedience to\nHis will. \u201cKnow ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants\nto obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto\ndeath, or of obedience unto righteousness?\u201d Many, while professing\nto be servants of Christ, are obeying another master, working daily\nagainst the Master whom they profess to serve. \u201cNo man can serve\ntwo masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or\nelse he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve\nGod and mammon.\u201d\nEarthly and selfish interests engage the soul, mind, and strength [443]\nof God\u2019s professed followers. To all intents and purposes they are\nservants of mammon. They have not experienced a crucifixion to\nthe world, with its affections and lusts. But few among the many\n392 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwho profess to be Christ\u2019s followers can say in the language of the\napostle: \u201cGod forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord\nJesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the\nworld.\u201d \u201cI am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but\nChrist liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live\nby the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for\nme.\u201d If willing obedience and true love characterize the lives of the\npeople of God, their light will shine with a holy brightness to the\nworld.\nThe words which Christ addressed to His disciples were designed\nfor all who should believe on His name: \u201cYe are the salt of the earth:\nbut if the salt have lost his savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is\nthenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden\nunderfoot of men.\u201d A profession of godliness without the living\nprinciple is as utterly valueless as salt without its saving properties.\nAn unprincipled professed Christian is a byword, a reproach to\nChrist, a dishonor to His name. \u201cYe are the light of the world. A city\nthat is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle,\nand put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light\nunto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men,\nthat they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which\nis in heaven.\u201d\nThe good works of God\u2019s people have a more powerful influence\nthan words. By their virtuous life and unselfish acts the beholder is\nled to desire the same righteousness which produced so good fruit.\nHe is charmed with that power from God which transforms selfish\nhuman beings into the divine image, and God is honored, His name\nglorified. But the Lord is dishonored and His cause reproached by[444]\nHis people\u2019s being in bondage to the world. They are in friendship\nwith the world, the enemies of God. Their only hope of salvation\nis to separate from the world and zealously maintain their separate,\nholy, and peculiar character. Oh! why will not God\u2019s people comply\nwith the conditions laid down in His word? If they would do this\nthey would not fail to realize the excellent blessings freely given of\nGod to the humble and obedient.\nI was amazed as I beheld the terrible darkness of many of the\nmembers of our churches. The lack of true godliness was such that\nthey were bodies of darkness and death, instead of being the light of\nAppeal to the Church 393\nthe world. Many professed to love God, but in works denied Him.\nThey did not love, serve, nor obey Him. Their own selfish interests\nwere primary. With a large number there seemed to be an alarming\nlack of principle. They were swayed by unconsecrated influence and\nseemed to have no root in themselves. I inquired what these things\nmeant. Why was there such a destitution of spirituality, so few who\nhad a living experience in religious things? I was referred to the\nwords of the prophet: \u201cSon of man, these men have set up their idols\nin their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before\ntheir face: should I be inquired of at all by them? Therefore speak\nunto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Every man\nof the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth\nthe stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to\nthe prophet; I the Lord will answer him that cometh according to\nthe multitude of his idols; that I may take the house of Israel in their\nown heart, because they are all estranged from Me through their\nidols.\u201d\nThe people of God were represented to me as in a backslidden\nstate. They have not an eye single to the glory of God. Their own\nglory is prominent. They seek to glorify themselves and yet call [445]\nthemselves Christians. Holiness of heart and purity of life was the\ngreat subject of the teachings of Christ. In His Sermon on the Mount,\nafter specifying what must be done in order to be blessed, and what\nmust not be done, He says: \u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your\nFather which is in heaven is perfect.\u201d\nPerfection, holiness, nothing short of this, would give them\nsuccess in carrying out the principles He had given them. Without\nthis holiness the human heart is selfish, sinful, and vicious. Holiness\nwill lead its possessor to be fruitful and abound in all good works.\nHe will never become weary in well-doing, neither will he look for\npromotion in this world. He will look forward for promotion to the\ntime when the Majesty of heaven shall exalt the sanctified ones to\nHis throne. Then shall He say unto them: \u201cCome, ye blessed of My\nFather, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation\nof the world.\u201d The Lord then enumerates the works of self-denial\nand mercy, compassion and righteousness, which they had wrought.\nHoliness of heart will produce right actions. It is the absence of\nspirituality, of holiness, which leads to unrighteous acts, to envy,\n394 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nhatred, jealousy, evil surmisings, and every hateful and abominable\nsin.\nI have tried in the fear of God to set before His people their\ndanger and their sins, and have endeavored, to the best of my feeble\npowers, to arouse them. I have stated startling things, which, if they\nhad believed, would have caused them distress and terror, and led\nthem to zeal in repenting of their sins and iniquities. I have stated\nbefore them that, from what was shown me, but a small number\nof those now professing to believe the truth would eventually be\nsaved\u2014not because they could not be saved, but because they would\nnot be saved in God\u2019s own appointed way. The way marked out by\nour divine Lord is too narrow and the gate too strait to admit them\nwhile grasping the world or while cherishing selfishness or sin of[446]\nany kind. There is no room for these things; and yet there are but few\nwho will consent to part with them, that they may pass the narrow\nway and enter the strait gate.\nThe words of Christ are plain: \u201cStrive [agonize] to enter in at the\nstrait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall\nnot be able.\u201d Not all professed Christians are Christians at heart.\nThere are sinners in Zion now, as there were anciently. Isaiah speaks\nof them in referring to the day of God: \u201cThe sinners in Zion are\nafraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us\nshall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with\neverlasting burnings? He that walketh righteously, and speaketh\nuprightly, he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his\nhands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of\nblood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; he shall dwell on high:\nhis place of defense shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be\ngiven him; his waters shall be sure.\u201d\nThere are hypocrites now who will tremble when they obtain a\nview of themselves. Their own vileness will terrify them in that day\nwhich is soon to come upon us, a day when \u201cthe Lord cometh out\nof His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.\u201d\nOh, that terror might now lay hold upon them, that they might have\na vivid sense of their condition and arouse while there is mercy and\nhope, confess their sins, and humble their souls greatly before God,\nthat He might pardon their transgressions and heal their backslidings!\nThe people of God are unready for the fearful, trying scenes before\nAppeal to the Church 395\nus, unready to stand pure from evil and lust amid the perils and\ncorruptions of this degenerate age. They have not on the armor\nof righteousness, and are unprepared to war against the prevailing\niniquity. Many are not obeying the commandments of God, yet they [447]\nprofess so to do. If they would be faithful to obey all the statutes of\nGod they would have a power which would carry conviction to the\nhearts of the unbelieving.\nI have sought to do my duty. I have pointed out the special sins\nof some. I was shown that in the wisdom of God the sins and errors\nof all would not be revealed. All would have sufficient light to see\ntheir sins and errors, if they desired to do so and earnestly wished\nto put them away, and to perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord.\nThey could see what sins God marked and reproved in others. If\nthese were cherished by themselves, they should know that they\nwere abhorred of God and were separated from Him; and that unless\nthey earnestly and zealously set about the work of putting them away\nthey would be left in darkness. God is too pure to behold iniquity.\nA sin is just as grievous in His sight in one case as in another. No\nexception will be made by an impartial God. All who are guilty are\naddressed in these individual testimonies, although their names may\nnot be attached to the special testimony borne; and if individuals\npass over and cover up their own sins because their names are not\nespecially called, they will not be prospered of God. They cannot\nadvance in the divine life, but will become darker and darker, until\nthe light of heaven will be entirely withdrawn.\nThose who profess godliness, yet are not sanctified by the truth\nwhich they profess, will not change materially their course of ac-\ntion, which they know is hateful before God, because they are not\nsubjected to the trial of being reproved individually for their sins.\nThey see, by the testimonies of others, their own case faithfully\npointed out before them. They are cherishing the same evil. By\ncontinuing their course of sin, they are violating their consciences,\nhardening their hearts, and stiffening their necks, just the same as\nthough the testimony had been borne directly to them. In passing\non and refusing to put away their sins and correct their wrongs by [448]\nhumble confession, repentance, and humiliation, they choose their\nown way, and are given up to the same, and are finally led captive by\nSatan at his will. They may become quite bold because they are able\n396 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nto conceal their sins from others and because the judgments of God\ndo not come in a visible manner upon them. They may be appar-\nently prosperous in this world. They may deceive poor, shortsighted\nmortals and be regarded as patterns of piety while in their sins. But\nGod cannot be deceived. \u201cBecause sentence against an evil work is\nnot executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully\nset in them to do evil. Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and\nhis days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with\nthem that fear God, which fear before Him: but it shall not be well\nwith the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a\nshadow; because he feareth not before God.\u201d Although the life of a\nsinner may be prolonged upon the earth, yet not in the earth made\nnew. He shall be of that number whom David mentions in his psalm:\n\u201cFor yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt\ndiligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek shall\ninherit the earth.\u201d\nMercy and truth are promised to the humble and penitent, but\njudgments are prepared for the sinful and rebellious. \u201cJustice and\njudgment are the habitation of Thy throne.\u201d A wicked and adulterous\npeople will not escape the wrath of God and the punishment they\nhave justly earned. Man has fallen; and it will be the work of a\nlifetime, be it longer or shorter, to recover from that fall, and regain,\nthrough Christ, the image of the divine, which he lost by sin and\ncontinued transgression. God requires a thorough transformation\nof soul, body, and spirit in order to regain the estate lost through\nAdam. The Lord mercifully sends rays of light to show man his true\ncondition. If he will not walk in the light he manifests a pleasure[449]\nin darkness. He will not come to the light lest his deeds shall be\nreproved.\nThe case of N. Fuller has caused me much grief and anguish of\nspirit. That he should yield himself to the control of Satan to work\nwickedness as he has done is terrible. I believe that God designed\nthat this case of hypocrisy and villainy should be brought to light\nin the manner it has been, that it might prove a warning to others.\nHere is a man who was acquainted with the teachings of the Bible,\nand who had listened to testimonies borne by me in his presence\nagainst the very sins which he was practicing. More than once\nhe had heard me speak decidedly in regard to the prevailing sins\nAppeal to the Church 397\nof this generation, that corruption was teeming everywhere, that\nbase passions controlled men and women generally, that among the\nmasses crimes of the darkest dye were continually practiced, and\nthey were reeking in their own corruption. The nominal churches\nare filled with fornication and adultery, crime and murder, the result\nof base, lustful passion; but these things are kept covered. Ministers\nin high places are guilty; yet a cloak of godliness covers their dark\ndeeds, and they pass on from year to year in their course of hypocrisy.\nThe sins of the nominal churches have reached unto heaven, and the\nhonest in heart will be brought to the light and come out of them.\nFrom the light that God has given me, fornication and adultery\nare estimated by a large number of the first-day Adventists as sins\nwhich God winks at. These sins are practiced to a great extent.\nThey do not acknowledge the claims of God\u2019s law upon them. They\nhave broken the commandments of the great Jehovah and zealously\nteach their hearers to do the same, declaring that the law of God is\nabolished and has no claims upon them. In accordance with this free\nstate of things, sin does not appear so exceedingly sinful; \u201cfor by the\nlaw is the knowledge of sin.\u201d We may expect to find in this company [450]\nmen who will deceive, and lie, and give loose rein to lustful passions.\nBut men and women who acknowledge the Ten Commandments\nbinding, who observe the fourth commandment of the Decalogue,\nshould carry out in their lives the principles of all ten of the precepts\ngiven in awful grandeur from Sinai.\nSeventh-day Adventists, who profess to be looking for and loving\nthe appearing of Christ, should not follow the course of worldlings.\nThese are no criterion for commandment keepers. Neither should\nthey pattern after first-day Adventists, who refuse to acknowledge\nthe claims of the law of God and trample it under their feet. This\nclass should be no criterion for them. Commandment-keeping Ad-\nventists occupy a peculiar, exalted position. John viewed them in\nholy vision and thus described them: \u201cHere are they that keep the\ncommandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d\nThe Lord made a special covenant with ancient Israel: \u201cNow\ntherefore, if ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant,\nthen ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me above all people: for all\nthe earth is Mine: and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and\nan holy nation.\u201d He addresses His commandment-keeping people\n398 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nin these last days: \u201cBut ye are a chosen generation, a royal priest-\nhood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth\nthe praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His\nmarvelous light.\u201d \u201cDearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and\npilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.\u201d\nNot all who profess to keep the commandments of God possess\ntheir bodies in sanctification and honor. The most solemn message\never committed to mortals has been entrusted to this people, and they\ncan have a powerful influence if they will be sanctified by it. They[451]\nprofess to be standing upon the elevated platform of eternal truth,\nkeeping all of God\u2019s commandments; therefore, if they indulge in\nsin, if they commit fornication and adultery, their crime is of tenfold\ngreater magnitude than is that of the classes I have named, who do\nnot acknowledge the law of God as binding upon them. In a peculiar\nsense do those who profess to keep God\u2019s law dishonor Him and\nreproach the truth by transgressing its precepts.\nIt was the prevalence of this very sin, fornication, among an-\ncient Israel, which brought upon them the signal manifestation of\nGod\u2019s displeasure. His judgments then followed close upon their\nheinous sin; thousands fell, and their polluted bodies were left in\nthe wilderness. \u201cBut with many of them God was not well pleased:\nfor they were overthrown in the wilderness. Now these things were\nour examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as\nthey also lusted. Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as\nit is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to\nplay. Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them commit-\nted, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. Neither let us\ntempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed\nof serpents. Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured,\nand were destroyed of the destroyer. Now all these things happened\nunto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition,\nupon whom the ends of the world are come. Wherefore let him that\nthinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.\u201d\nSeventh-day Adventists, above all other people in the world,\nshould be patterns of piety, holy in heart and in conversation. I\nrelated in the presence of N. Fuller that the people whom God\nhad chosen as His peculiar treasure were required to be elevated,\nrefined, sanctified, partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the\nAppeal to the Church 399\ncorruption that is in the world through lust. Should they who make [452]\nso high a profession indulge in sin and iniquity, their guilt would be\nvery great. The Lord reproves the sins of one, that others may take\nwarning and fear.\nWarnings and reproofs are not given to the erring among Seventh-\nday Adventists because their lives are more blameworthy than are the\nlives of professed Christians of the nominal churches, nor because\ntheir example or their acts are worse than those of the Adventists who\nwill not yield obedience to the claims of God\u2019s law, but because they\nhave great light, and have by their profession taken their position\nas God\u2019s special, chosen people, having the law of God written\nin their hearts. They signify their loyalty to the God of heaven\nby yielding obedience to the laws of His government. They are\nGod\u2019s representatives upon the earth. Any sin in them separates\nthem from God and, in a special manner, dishonors His name by\ngiving the enemies of His holy law occasion to reproach His cause\nand His people, whom He has called \u201ca chosen generation, a royal\npriesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people,\u201d that they should show\nforth the praises of Him that hath called them out of darkness into\nHis marvelous light.\nThe people who are at war with the law of the great Jehovah, who\nconsider it a special virtue to talk, write, and act the most bitter and\nhateful things to show their contempt of that law, may make exalted\nprofession of love to God, and apparently have much religious zeal,\nas did the Jewish chief priests and elders; yet, in the day of God,\n\u201cFound wanting\u201d will be said of them by the Majesty of heaven.\n\u201cBy the law is the knowledge of sin.\u201d The mirror which would\ndiscover to them the defects in their characters, they are infuriated\nagainst, because it points out their sins. Leading Adventists who\nhave rejected the light are fired with madness against God\u2019s holy\nlaw, as the Jewish nation were against the Son of God. They are in a\nterrible deception, deceiving others and being deceived themselves. [453]\nThey will not come to the light, lest their deeds should be reproved.\nSuch will not be taught. But the Lord reproves and corrects the\npeople who profess to keep His law. He points out their sins and\nlays open their iniquity because He wishes to separate all sin and\nwickedness from them, that they may perfect holiness in His fear\nand be prepared to die in the Lord or to be translated to heaven.\n400 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nGod rebukes, reproves, and corrects them, that they may be refined,\nsanctified, elevated, and finally exalted to His own throne.\nElder Fuller has heard the testimony borne in public, that the\nprofessed people of God were not all holy, that some were corrupt.\nGod sought to elevate them, but they refused to come up upon a\nhigh plane of action. The corrupt animal passions bore sway, and\nthe moral and intellectual powers were overborne and made their\nservants. Those who do not control their base passions cannot appre-\nciate the atonement or place a right value upon the soul. Salvation is\nnot experienced or understood by them. The gratification of animal\npassion is the highest ambition of their lives. God will accept noth-\ning but purity and holiness; one spot, one wrinkle, one defect in the\ncharacter, will forever debar them from heaven, with all its glories\nand treasures.\nAmple provisions have been made for all who sincerely,\nearnestly, and thoughtfully set about the work of perfecting holiness\nin the fear of God. Strength, grace, and glory have been provided\nthrough Christ, to be brought by ministering angels to the heirs of\nsalvation. None are so low, so corrupt and vile, that they cannot find\nin Jesus, who died for them, strength, purity, and righteousness, if\nthey will put away their sins, cease their course of iniquity, and turn\nwith full purpose of heart to the living God. He is waiting to strip\nthem of their garments, stained and polluted by sin, and to put upon\nthem the white, bright robes of righteousness; and He bids them\nlive and not die. In Him they may flourish. Their branches will not[454]\nwither nor be fruitless. If they abide in Him, they can draw sap and\nnourishment from Him, be imbued with His Spirit, walk even as He\nwalked, overcome as He overcame, and be exalted to His own right\nhand.\nElder Fuller has been warned. The warnings given to others\ncondemned him. The sins reproved in others reproved him and\ngave him sufficient light to see how God regarded crimes of such a\ncharacter as he was committing, yet he would not turn from his evil\ncourse. He continued to pursue his fearful, impious work, corrupting\nthe bodies and souls of his flock. Satan had strengthened the lustful\npassions which this man did not subdue, and engaged them in his\ncause to lead souls to death.\nAppeal to the Church 401\nWhile he professed to keep the law of God, he was, in a most\nwanton manner, violating its plain precepts. He has given himself\nup to the gratification of sensual pleasure. He has sold himself\nto work wickedness. What will be the wages of such a man? The\nindignation and wrath of God will punish him for sin. The vengeance\nof God will be aroused against all those whose lustful passions have\nbeen concealed under a ministerial cloak. While professing to be a\nshepherd of the flock, he was leading the flock to certain ruin. These\ndreadful results are the fruits of the carnal mind, which \u201cis enmity\nagainst God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed\ncan be.\u201d\nI was referred to this scripture: \u201cLet not sin therefore reign\nin your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.\nNeither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness\nunto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from\nthe dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto\nGod.\u201d Professed Christians, if no further light is given you than\nthat contained in this text, you will be without excuse if you suffer\nyourselves to be controlled by base passions.\nThe word of God is sufficient to enlighten the most beclouded [455]\nmind and may be understood by those who have any desire to under-\nstand it. But notwithstanding all this, some who profess to make the\nword of God their study are found living in direct opposition to its\nplainest teachings. Then, to leave men and women without excuse,\nGod gives plain and pointed testimonies, bringing them back to the\nword that they have neglected to follow. Yet those who serve their\nown lusts turn from all this light. They will not cease their course of\nsin, but continue to take pleasure in unrighteousness in the face of\nthe threatenings and vengeance of God against those who do such\nthings.\nI have long been designing to speak to my sisters and tell them\nthat, from what the Lord has been pleased to show me from time\nto time, there is a great fault among them. They are not careful to\nabstain from all appearance of evil. They are not all circumspect in\ntheir deportment, as becometh women professing godliness. Their\nwords are not as select and well chosen as those of women who have\nreceived the grace of God should be. They are too familiar with their\n402 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nbrethren. They linger around them, incline toward them, and seem\nto choose their society. They are highly gratified with their attention.\nFrom the light which the Lord has given me, our sisters should\npursue a very different course. They should be more reserved, mani-\nfest less boldness, and encourage in themselves \u201cshamefacedness\nand sobriety.\u201d Both brethren and sisters indulge in too much jovial\ntalk when in each other\u2019s society. Women professing godliness in-\ndulge in much jesting, joking, and laughing. This is unbecoming\nand grieves the Spirit of God. These exhibitions reveal a lack of true\nChristian refinement. They do not strengthen the soul in God, but\nbring great darkness; they drive away the pure, refined, heavenly\nangels and bring those who engage in these wrongs down to a low\nlevel.\nOur sisters should encourage true meekness; they should not be[456]\nforward, talkative, and bold, but modest and unassuming, slow to\nspeak. They may cherish courteousness. To be kind, tender, pitiful,\nforgiving, and humble, would be becoming and well pleasing to God.\nIf they occupy this position they will not be burdened with undue\nattention from gentlemen in the church or out. All will feel that there\nis a sacred circle of purity around these God-fearing women, which\nshields them from any unwarrantable liberties.\nWith some women professing godliness, there is a careless,\ncoarse freedom of manner which leads to wrong and evil. But those\ngodly women whose minds and hearts are occupied in meditating\nupon themes which strengthen purity of life, and which elevate\nthe soul to commune with God, will not be easily led astray from\nthe path of rectitude and virtue. Such will be fortified against the\nsophistry of Satan; they will be prepared to withstand his seductive\narts.\nVainglory, the fashion of the world, the desire of the eye, and the\nlust of the flesh are connected with the fall of the unfortunate. That\nwhich is pleasing to the natural heart and carnal mind is cherished.\nIf the lust of the flesh had been rooted out of their hearts they would\nnot be so weak. If our sisters would feel the necessity of purifying\ntheir thoughts, and never suffer in themselves a carelessness of\ndeportment which leads to improper acts, they need not in the least\nstain their purity. If they viewed the matter as God has presented it\nto me, they would have such an abhorrence of impure acts that they\nAppeal to the Church 403\nwould not be found among those who fall through the temptations\nof Satan, no matter whom he might select as the medium.\nA preacher may be dealing in sacred, holy things, and yet not\nbe holy in heart. He may give himself to Satan to work wickedness\nand to corrupt the souls and bodies of his flock. Yet if the minds of [457]\nwomen and youth professing to love and fear God were fortified with\nHis Spirit, if they had trained their minds to purity of thought and\neducated themselves to avoid all appearance of evil, they would be\nsafe from any improper advances and be secure from the corruption\nprevailing around them. The apostle Paul wrote concerning himself:\n\u201cBut I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by\nany means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a\ncastaway.\u201d\nIf a minister of the gospel does not control his baser passions,\nif he fails to follow the example of the apostle and so dishonors his\nprofession and faith as to even name the indulgence of sin, our sisters\nwho profess godliness should not for an instant flatter themselves\nthat sin or crime loses its sinfulness in the least because their minister\ndares to engage in it. The fact that men who are in responsible places\nshow themselves to be familiar with sin should not lessen the guilt\nand enormity of the sin in the minds of any. Sin should appear just\nas sinful, just as abhorrent, as it had been heretofore regarded; and\nthe minds of the pure and elevated should abhor and shun the one\nwho indulges in sin, as they would flee from a serpent whose sting\nwas deadly.\nIf the sisters were elevated and possessed purity of heart, any\ncorrupt advances, even from their minister, would be repulsed with\nsuch positiveness as would never need a repetition. Minds must be\nterribly befogged by Satan when they can listen to the voice of the\nseducer because he is a minister, and therefore break God\u2019s plain\nand positive commands and flatter themselves that they commit no\nsin. Have we not the words of John: \u201cHe that saith, I know Him,\nand keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not\nin him\u201d? What saith the law? \u201cThou shalt not commit adultery.\u201d\nWhen a man professing to keep God\u2019s holy law, and ministering\nin sacred things, takes advantage of the confidence his position [458]\ngives him and seeks to indulge his base passions, this fact should\nof itself be sufficient to enable a woman professing godliness to see\n404 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthat, although his profession is as exalted as the heavens, an impure\nproposal coming from him is from Satan disguised as an angel of\nlight. I cannot believe that the word of God is abiding in the hearts\nof those who so readily yield up their innocency and virtue upon the\naltar of lustful passions.\nMy sisters, avoid even the appearance of evil. In this fast age,\nreeking with corruption, you are not safe unless you stand guarded.\nVirtue and modesty are rare. I appeal to you as followers of Christ,\nmaking an exalted profession, to cherish the precious, priceless gem\nof modesty. This will guard virtue. If you have any hope of being\nfinally exalted to join the company of the pure, sinless angels, and to\nlive in an atmosphere where there is not the least taint of sin, cherish\nmodesty and virtue. Nothing but purity, sacred purity, will stand the\ngrand review, abide the day of God, and be received into a pure and\nholy heaven.\nThe slightest insinuations, from whatever source they may come,\ninviting you to indulge in sin or to allow the least unwarrantable\nliberty with your persons, should be resented as the worst of insults\nto your dignified womanhood. The kiss upon your cheek, at an\nimproper time and place, should lead you to repel the emissary of\nSatan with disgust. If it is from one in high places who is dealing\nin sacred things, the sin is of tenfold greater magnitude, and should\nlead a God-fearing woman or youth to recoil with horror, not only\nfrom the sin he would have you commit, but from the hypocrisy and\nvillainy of one whom the people respect and honor as God\u2019s servant.\nHe is handling sacred things, yet hiding his baseness of heart under\na ministerial cloak. Be afraid of anything like this familiarity. Be\nsure that the least approach to it is evidence of a lascivious mind and[459]\na lustful eye. If the least encouragement is given in this direction, if\nany of the liberties mentioned are tolerated, no better evidence can be\ngiven that your mind is not pure and chaste as it should be, and that\nsin and crime have charms for you. You lower the standard of your\ndignified, virtuous womanhood, and give unmistakable evidence\nthat a low, brutal, common passion and lust has been suffered to\nremain alive in your heart and has never been crucified.\nAs I have been shown the dangers of those who profess better\nthings, and the sins that exist among them,\u2014a class who are not\nsuspected of being in any danger from these polluting sins,\u2014I have\nAppeal to the Church 405\nbeen led to inquire: Who, O Lord, shall stand when Thou appearest?\nOnly those who have clean hands and pure hearts shall abide the day\nof His coming.\nI feel impelled by the Spirit of the Lord to urge my sisters who\nprofess godliness to cherish modesty of deportment and a becoming\nreserve, with shamefacedness and sobriety. The liberties taken in\nthis age of corruption should be no criterion for Christ\u2019s followers.\nThese fashionable exhibitions of familiarity should not exist among\nChristians fitting for immortality. If lasciviousness, pollution, adul-\ntery, crime, and murder are the order of the day among those who\nknow not the truth, and who refuse to be controlled by the principles\nof God\u2019s word, how important that the class professing to be follow-\ners of Christ, closely allied to God and angels, should show them\na better and nobler way. How important that by their chastity and\nvirtue they stand in marked contrast to that class who are controlled\nby brute passions.\nI have inquired: When will the youthful sisters act with propri-\nety? I know there will be no decided change for the better until\nparents feel the importance of greater carefulness in educating their\nchildren correctly. Teach them to act with reserve and modesty.\nEducate them for usefulness, to be helps, to minister to others rather [460]\nthan to be waited upon and be ministered unto.\nSatan controls the minds of the youth in general. Your daughters\nare not taught self-denial and self-control. They are petted, and their\npride is fostered. They are allowed to have their own way until they\nbecome headstrong and self-willed, and you are put to your wit\u2019s\nend to know what course to pursue to save them from ruin. Satan is\nleading them on to be a proverb in the mouth of unbelievers because\nof their boldness, their lack of reserve and womanly modesty. The\nyoung boys are likewise left to have their own way. They have\nscarcely entered their teens before they are by the side of little girls\nof their own age, accompanying them home and making love to\nthem. And the parents are so completely in bondage through their\nown indulgence and mistaken love for their children that they dare\nnot pursue a decided course to make a change and restrain their\ntoo-fast children in this fast age.\nWith many young ladies the boys are the theme of conversation;\nwith the young men, it is the girls. \u201cOut of the abundance of the\n406 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nheart the mouth speaketh.\u201d They talk of those subjects upon which\ntheir minds mostly run. The recording angel is writing the words of\nthese professed Christian boys and girls. How will they be confused\nand ashamed when they meet them again in the day of God! Many\nchildren are pious hypocrites. The youth who have not made a\nprofession of religion stumble over these hypocritical ones and are\nhardened against any effort that may be made by those interested in\ntheir salvation.\nThere ought to be picked men at the heart of the work, men who\nin every emergency can be relied upon to keep the fort, men who are\nunselfish, abounding in generosity and all good works, whose lives\nare hid in God, and who consider the better life of more value than\nfood and clothing. \u201cIs not the life more than meat, and the body than[461]\nraiment?\u201d God calls for faithful sentinels right at the heart of the\nwork, who will love souls for whom Christ died, and who will bear\nthe burden for perishing souls, looking forward to that recompense\nof reward which will be theirs when they enter into the joy of their\nLord and behold souls saved through their instrumentality to live\nas long as God shall live, and be happy, eternally happy, in His\nglorious kingdom. Oh, that we could arouse fathers and mothers to\na sense of their duty! Oh, that they would feel deeply the weight\nof responsibility resting upon them! Then they might forestall the\nenemy and gain precious victories for Jesus. Parents are not clear in\nthis matter. They should closely investigate their lives, analyze their\nthoughts and motives, and see if they have been circumspect in their\ncourse of action. They should watch closely to see if their example\nin conversation and deportment has been such as they would wish\ntheir children to imitate. Purity and virtue should shine out in their\nwords and acts before their children.\nI have been shown families where the husband and father has\nnot preserved that reserve, that dignified, godlike manhood, which\nis befitting a follower of Christ. He has failed to perform the kind,\ntender, courteous acts due to his wife, whom he has promised before\nGod and angels to love, respect, and honor while they both shall\nlive. The girl employed to do the work has been free and somewhat\nforward to dress his hair and to be affectionately attentive, and he\nis pleased, foolishly pleased. In his love and attention to his wife\nhe is not as demonstrative as he once was. Be sure that Satan is at\nAppeal to the Church 407\nwork here. Respect your hired help, treat them kindly, considerately,\nbut go no further. Let your deportment be such that there will be no\nadvances to familiarity from them. If you have words of kindness\nand acts of courtesy to give, it is always safe to give them to your\nwife. It will be a great blessing to her, and will bring happiness to [462]\nher heart, to be reflected upon you again.\nI have been shown also that the wife has let her sympathies and\ninterest and affection go out to other men, who may be members\nof the family. She makes these her confidants, shows a preference\nfor their society, and relates to them her troubles and perhaps her\nprivate family matters.\nThis is all wrong. Satan is at the bottom of it; and unless you are\nalarmed and stop just where you are, he will lead you to ruin. You\ncannot observe too great caution and encourage too much reserve in\nthis matter. If you have tender, loving words and kindly attentions to\nbestow, let them be given to him whom you have promised before\nGod and angels to love, respect, and honor while you both shall\nlive. Oh, how many lives are made bitter by the breaking down of\nthe walls which enclose the privacies of every family and which are\ncalculated to preserve its purity and sanctity! A third person is taken\ninto the confidence of the wife, and her private family matters are\nlaid open before the special friend. This is the device of Satan to\nestrange the hearts of the husband and wife. Oh, that this would\ncease! what a world of trouble would be saved! Lock within your\nown hearts the knowledge of each other\u2019s faults. Tell your troubles\nalone to God. He can give you right counsel and sure consolation,\nwhich will be pure, having no bitterness in it.\nI am acquainted with a number of women who have thought\ntheir marriage a misfortune. They have read novels until their imag-\ninations have become diseased, and they live in a world of their\nown creating. They think themselves women of sensitive minds, of\nsuperior, refined organizations, and imagine that their husbands are\nnot so refined, that they do not possess these superior qualities, and\ntherefore cannot appreciate their own supposed virtue and refined\norganizations. Consequently these women think themselves great\nsufferers, martyrs. They have talked of this and thought upon it until [463]\nthey are nearly maniacs upon this subject. They imagine their worth\nsuperior to that of other mortals, and it is not agreeable to their fine\n408 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nsensibilities to associate with common humanity. These women\nare making themselves fools; and their husbands are in danger of\nthinking that they do possess a superior order of mind.\nFrom what the Lord has shown me, the women of this class have\nhad their imaginations perverted by novel reading, daydreaming,\nand castle-building, living in an imaginary world. They do not bring\ntheir own ideas down to the common, useful duties of life. They\ndo not take up the life burdens which lie in their path, and seek to\nmake a happy, cheerful home for their husbands. They rest their\nwhole weight upon them, not bearing their own burden. They expect\nothers to anticipate their wants and do for them, while they are at\nliberty to find fault and to question as they please. These women\nhave a lovesick sentimentalism, constantly thinking they are not\nappreciated, that their husbands do not give them all the attention\nthey deserve. They imagine themselves martyrs.\nThe truth of the matter is, if they would show themselves useful\ntheir value might be appreciated; but when they pursue a course to\nconstantly draw upon others for sympathy and attention, while they\nfeel under no obligation to give the same in return, passing along\nreserved, cold, and unapproachable, bearing no burden for others\nand having no feeling for their woes, there can be in their lives but\nlittle that is valuable. These women have educated themselves to\nthink and act as though it was a great condescension in them to marry\nthe men they did, and that therefore their fine organizations would\nnever be fully appreciated. They have viewed things all wrong. They\nare unworthy of their husbands. They are a constant tax upon their\ncare and patience, when they might be helps, lifting the burdens of[464]\nlife with them, instead of dreaming over unreal life found in novels\nand love romances. May the Lord pity the men who are bound to\nsuch useless machines, fit only to be waited upon, to breathe, eat,\nand dress.\nThese women who suppose they possess such sensitive, refined\norganizations make very useless wives and mothers. It is frequently\nthe case that they withdraw their affections from their husbands, who\nare useful, practical men, and show much attention to other men,\nand with their lovesick sentimentalism draw upon the sympathies\nof others, tell them their trials, their troubles, their aspirations to do\nsome elevated work, and reveal the fact that their married life is a\nAppeal to the Church 409\ndisappointment, a hindrance to their doing the work they had hoped\nto do.\nOh, what wretchedness exists in families that might be happy!\nThese women are a curse to themselves and a curse to their husbands.\nIn supposing themselves to be angels, they make themselves fools,\nand are nothing but heavy burdens. The common duties of life which\nthe Lord has left for them to do, they leave right in their path, and are\nrestless and complaining, always looking for an easy, more exalted,\nand more agreeable work. Supposing themselves to be angels, they\nare found human after all. They are fretful, peevish, dissatisfied,\njealous of their husbands because the larger portion of their time\nis not spent waiting upon them. They complain of being neglected\nwhen their husbands are doing the very work they ought to do. Satan\nfinds easy access to this class. They have no real love for anyone\nbut themselves. Yet Satan tells them that if such a one were their\nhusband, they would be happy indeed. They are easy victims to the\ndevice of Satan, being readily led to dishonor their own husbands\nand to transgress the law of God.\nI would say to women of this description: You can make or\ndestroy your own happiness. You can make your position happy [465]\nor unbearable. The course which you pursue will create happiness\nor misery for yourself. Have these persons never thought that their\nhusbands must tire of them in their uselessness, their peevishness,\ntheir faultfinding, their passionate fits of weeping while imagining\ntheir case so pitiful? Their irritable, peevish disposition is indeed\nweaning from them the affections of their husbands and driving\nthem to seek for sympathy, and peace, and comfort elsewhere than at\nhome. A poisonous atmosphere is in their dwelling, and home is to\nthem anything but a place of rest, peace, or happiness. The husband\nis subject to Satan\u2019s temptation, and his affections are placed on\nforbidden objects, and he is lured on to crime and finally lost.\nGreat is the work and mission of women, especially those who\nare wives and mothers. They can be a blessing to all around them.\nThey can have a powerful influence for good if they will let their\nlight so shine that others may be led to glorify our heavenly Father.\nWomen may have a transforming influence if they will only consent\nto yield their way and their will to God, and let Him control their\nmind, affections, and being. They can have an influence which will\n410 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ntend to refine and elevate those with whom they associate. But this\nclass are generally unconscious of the power they possess. They\nexert an unconscious influence which seems to work out naturally\nfrom a sanctified life, a renewed heart. It is the fruit that grows\nnaturally upon the good tree of divine planting. Self is forgotten,\nmerged in the life of Christ. To be rich in good works is as natural\nas their breath. They live to do others good and yet are ready to say:\nWe are unprofitable servants.\nGod has assigned woman her mission; and if she, in her humble\nway, yet to the best of her ability, makes a heaven of her home,\nfaithfully and lovingly performing her duties to her husband and\nchildren, continually seeking to let a holy light shine from her useful,[466]\npure, and virtuous life to brighten all around her, she is doing the\nwork left her of the Master, and will hear from His divine lips the\nwords: Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy\nof thy Lord. These women who are doing with ready willingness\nwhat their hands find to do, with cheerfulness of spirit aiding their\nhusbands to bear their burdens, and training their children for God,\nare missionaries in the highest sense. They are engaged in an impor-\ntant branch of the great work to be done on earth to prepare mortals\nfor a higher life, and they will receive their reward. Children are to\nbe trained for heaven and fitted to shine in the courts of the Lord\u2019s\nkingdom. When parents, especially mothers, have a true sense of the\nimportant, responsible work which God has left for them to do, they\nwill not be so much engaged in the business which concerns their\nneighbors, with which they have nothing to do. They will not go\nfrom house to house to engage in fashionable gossip, dwelling upon\nthe faults, wrongs, and inconsistencies of their neighbors. They will\nfeel so great a burden of care for their own children that they can\nfind no time to take up a reproach against their neighbor. Gossipers\nand news carriers are a terrible curse to neighborhoods and churches.\nTwo thirds of all the church trials arise from this source.\nGod requires all to do with faithfulness the duties of today. This\nis much neglected by the larger share of professed Christians. Es-\npecially is present duty lost sight of by the class I have mentioned,\nwho imagine that they are of a finer order of beings than their fellow\nmortals around them. The fact that their minds turn in this channel\nis proof that they are of an inferior order, narrow, conceited, and\nAppeal to the Church 411\nselfish. They feel high above the lowly and humble poor, such as\nJesus says He has called. They are forever trying to secure position,\nto gain applause, to obtain credit for doing some great work that\nothers cannot do. But it disturbs the fine grain of their refined organ-\nism to associate with the humble, the unfortunate. They mistake the [467]\nreason altogether. The reason why they shun any of these duties not\nso agreeable is found in their supreme selfishness. Dear self is the\ncenter of all their actions and motives.\nI was pointed to the Majesty of heaven. When He whom angels\nworshiped, He who was rich in honor, splendor, and glory, came\nto the earth, and found Himself in fashion as a man, He did not\nplead His refined nature as an excuse to hold Himself aloof from\nthe unfortunate. In His work He was found among the afflicted, the\npoor, distressed, and needy ones. Christ was the embodiment of\nrefinement and purity; His was an exalted life and character; yet in\nHis labor He was found not among men of high-sounding titles, not\namong the most honorable of this world, but with the despised and\nneedy. I came, says the divine Teacher, \u201cto save that which was lost.\u201d\nYes; the Majesty of heaven was ever found working to help those\nwho most needed help. May the example of Christ put to shame the\nexcuses of that class who are so attracted to their poor selves that\nthey consider it beneath their refined taste and their high calling to\nhelp the most helpless. Such have taken a position higher than their\nLord, and in the end will be astonished to find themselves lower than\nthe lowest of that class whom their refined, sensitive natures were\nshocked to mingle with and work for. True, it may not always be\nagreeable to unite with the Master and become co-workers with Him\nin helping the very class who stand most in need of help; but this is\nthe work which Christ humbled Himself to do. Is the servant greater\nthan his Lord? He has given the example, and enjoins upon us to\ncopy it. It may be disagreeable, yet duty demands that just such a\nwork be performed.\nFaithful and picked men are needed at the head of the work.\nThose who have not had an experience in bearing burdens, and who\ndo not wish to have that experience, should not, on any account, live\nthere. Men are wanted who will watch for souls as they that must [468]\ngive an account. Fathers and mothers in Israel are wanted at this\nimportant post. Let the selfish and self-caring, the stingy, covetous\n412 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nsouls, find a location where their miserable traits of character will\nnot be so conspicuous. The more isolated such ones are, the better\nfor the cause of God. I appeal to the people of God, wherever they\nmay be found: Awake to your duty. Take it to heart that we are really\nliving amid the perils of the last days.\nI hope that the case of N. Fuller will awaken you, fathers and\nmothers, to see the necessity of thorough work in your houses,\namong yourselves and your children, that not one of you may be so\ndeluded by Satan as to regard sin as this poor, much-to-be-pitied man\nhas done. Those who have participated with him in crime would\nnever have been left to be deceived and ruined had they possessed a\nhigh sense of virtue and purity, and cherished a constant and lively\nhorror of sin and iniquity. While living under and proclaiming the\nmost solemn message ever borne to mortals, presenting the law of\nGod as a test of character and as the seal of the living God, they are\ntransgressing its holy precepts. The consciences of those who do\nthis have become seared and terribly hardened. They have resisted\nthe influences of the Spirit of God until they can use sacred truth\nas a cloak to hide the deformity of their corrupted souls. This man\nhas been terribly deluded by Satan. He has been serving vicious\npassions while professing to be consecrated to the work of God,\nministering in sacred things. He has considered himself in health\nwhile there was no soundness in him.\nI have felt deeply as I have seen the powerful influence of animal\npassions in controlling men and women of no ordinary intelligence\nand ability. They would be capable of engaging in a good work,\nof exerting a powerful influence, were they not enslaved by base\npassions. My confidence in humanity has been terribly shaken. I[469]\nhave been shown that persons of apparently good deportment, not\ntaking unwarrantable liberties with the other sex, were guilty of\npracticing secret vice nearly every day of their lives. They have\nnot refrained from this terrible sin even while most solemn meet-\nings have been in session. They have listened to the most solemn,\nimpressive discourses upon the judgment, which seemed to bring\nthem before the tribunal of God, causing them to fear and quake;\nyet hardly an hour would elapse before they would be engaged in\ntheir favorite, bewitching sin, polluting their own bodies. They were\nsuch slaves to this awful crime that they seemed devoid of power to\nAppeal to the Church 413\ncontrol their passions. We have labored for some earnestly, we have\nentreated, we have wept and prayed over them; yet we have known\nthat right amid all our earnest effort and distress the force of sinful\nhabit has obtained the mastery, and these sins have been committed.\nThrough severe attacks of sickness or by powerful conviction\nthe consciences of some of the guilty have been aroused and have so\nscourged them that it has led to confession of these things with deep\nhumiliation. Others are equally guilty. They have practiced this sin\nnearly their whole lifetime and, in their broken-down constitutions\nand sievelike memories, are reaping the result of this pernicious\nhabit; yet they are too proud to confess. They are secretive, and\nhave not shown compunctions of conscience for this great sin. My\nconfidence in the Christian experience of such is very small. They\nseem to be insensible to the influence of the Spirit of God. The\nsacred and common are alike to them. The common practice of a\nvice so degrading as the polluting of their own bodies has not led\nto bitter tears and heartfelt repentance. They feel that their sin is\nagainst themselves alone. Here they mistake. Are they diseased in\nbody or mind, others are made to feel, others suffer. The imagination\nis at fault, the memory is deficient, mistakes are made, and there is [470]\na deficiency everywhere which seriously affects those with whom\nthey live and who associate with them. Mortification and regret are\nfelt because these things are known by others.\nI have mentioned these cases to illustrate the power of this soul-\nand-body-destroying vice. The entire mind is given up to low pas-\nsion. The moral and intellectual faculties are over-borne by the baser\npowers. The body is enervated, the brain weakened. The material\ndeposited there to nourish the system is squandered. The drain upon\nthe system is great. The fine nerves of the brain, being excited to\nunnatural action, become benumbed and in a measure paralyzed.\nThe moral and intellectual powers are weakening, while the animal\npassions are strengthening and being more largely developed by\nexercise. The appetite for unhealthful food clamors for indulgence.\nWhen persons are addicted to the habit of self-abuse, it is impossible\nto arouse their moral sensibilities to appreciate eternal things or to\ndelight in spiritual exercises. Impure thoughts seize and control\nthe imagination and fascinate the mind, and next follows an almost\nuncontrollable desire for the performance of impure actions. If the\n414 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nmind were educated to contemplate elevating subjects, the imagina-\ntion trained to reflect upon pure and holy things, it would be fortified\nagainst this terrible, debasing, soul-and-body-destroying indulgence.\nIt would, by training, become accustomed to linger upon the high,\nthe heavenly, the pure, and the sacred, and could not be attracted to\nthis base, corrupt, and vile indulgence.\nWhat can we say of those who are living right in the blazing light\nof truth, yet daily practicing and following in a course of sin and\ncrime? Forbidden, exciting pleasures have a charm for them and hold\nand control their entire being. Such take pleasure in unrighteousness\nand iniquity, and must perish outside of the city of God, with every\nabominable thing.\nI have sought to arouse parents to their duty, yet they sleep on.[471]\nYour children are practicing secret vice, and they deceive you. You\nhave such implicit confidence in them that you think them too good\nand innocent to be capable of secretly practicing iniquity. Parents\nfondle and pet their children, and indulge them in pride, but do not\nrestrain them with firmness and decision. They are so much afraid\nof their willful, stubborn spirits that they fear to come in contact\nwith them; the sin of negligence, which was marked against Eli, will\nbe their sin. The exhortation of Peter is of the highest value to all\nwho are striving for immortality. He addresses those of like precious\nfaith:\n\u201cSimon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them\nthat have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteous-\nness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: Grace and peace be\nmultiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our\nLord, according as His divine power hath given unto us all things\nthat pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him\nthat hath called us to glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us\nexceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be\npartakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that\nis in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence,\nadd to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge\ntemperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;\nand to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness char-\nity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that\nye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our\nAppeal to the Church 415\nLord Jesus Christ. But he that lacketh these things is blind, and\ncannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his\nold sins. Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your\ncalling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never\nfall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into [472]\nthe everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\u201d\nWe are in a world where light and knowledge abound, yet many\nclaiming to be of like precious faith are willingly ignorant. Light\nis all around them, yet they do not appropriate it to themselves.\nParents do not see the necessity of informing themselves, obtaining\nknowledge, and putting it to a practical use in their married life. If\nthey followed out the exhortation of the apostle, and lived upon the\nplan of addition, they would not be unfruitful in the knowledge of\nour Lord Jesus Christ. But many do not understand the work of\nsanctification. They seem to think they have attained to it, when\nthey have learned only the first lessons in addition. Sanctification is\na progressive work; it is not attained to in an hour or a day, and then\nmaintained without any special effort on our part.\nMany parents do not obtain the knowledge that they should in the\nmarried life. They are not guarded lest Satan take advantage of them\nand control their minds and their lives. They do not see that God\nrequires them to control their married lives from any excesses. But\nvery few feel it to be a religious duty to govern their passions. They\nhave united themselves in marriage to the object of their choice, and\ntherefore reason that marriage sanctifies the indulgence of the baser\npassions. Even men and women professing godliness give loose rein\nto their lustful passions, and have no thought that God holds them\naccountable for the expenditure of vital energy, which weakens their\nhold on life and enervates the entire system.\nThe marriage covenant covers sins of the darkest hue. Men\nand women professing godliness debase their own bodies through\nthe indulgence of the corrupt passions, and thus lower themselves\nbeneath the brute creation. They abuse the powers which God has\ngiven them to be preserved in sanctification and honor. Health and [473]\nlife are sacrificed upon the altar of base passion. The higher, nobler\npowers are brought into subjection to the animal propensities. Those\nwho thus sin are not acquainted with the result of their course. Could\nall see the amount of suffering which they bring upon themselves by\n416 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ntheir own sinful indulgence, they would be alarmed, and some, at\nleast, would shun the course of sin which brings such dreaded wages.\nSo miserable an existence is entailed upon a large class that death\nwould to them be preferable to life; and many do die prematurely,\ntheir lives sacrificed in the inglorious work of excessive indulgence\nof the animal passions. Yet because they are married they think they\ncommit no sin.\nMen and women, you will one day learn what is lust and the\nresult of its gratification. Passion of just as base a quality may be\nfound in the marriage relation as outside of it. The apostle Paul\nexhorts husbands to love their wives \u201ceven as Christ also loved the\nchurch, and gave Himself for it.\u201d \u201cSo ought men to love their wives\nas their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no\nman ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it,\neven as the Lord the church.\u201d It is not pure love which actuates a\nman to make his wife an instrument to minister to his lust. It is the\nanimal passions which clamor for indulgence. How few men show\ntheir love in the manner specified by the apostle: \u201cEven as Christ\nalso loved the church, and gave Himself for it; that He might [not\npollute it, but] sanctify and cleanse it; ... that it should be holy and\nwithout blemish.\u201d This is the quality of love in the marriage relation\nwhich God recognizes as holy. Love is a pure and holy principle; but\nlustful passion will not admit of restraint, and will not be dictated\nto or controlled by reason. It is blind to consequences; it will not\nreason from cause to effect. Many women are suffering from great\ndebility and settled disease because the laws of their being have\nbeen disregarded; nature\u2019s laws have been trampled upon. The brain[474]\nnerve power is squandered by men and women, being called into\nunnatural action to gratify base passions; and this hideous monster,\nbase, low passion, assumes the delicate name of love.\nMany professed Christians who passed before me seemed des-\ntitute of moral restraint. They were more animal than divine. In\nfact, they were about all animal. Men of this type degrade the wife\nwhom they have promised to nourish and cherish. She is made an\ninstrument to minister to the gratification of low, lustful propensities.\nAnd very many women submit to become slaves to lustful passion;\nthey do not possess their bodies in sanctification and honor. The\nwife does not retain the dignity and self-respect which she possessed\nAppeal to the Church 417\nprevious to marriage. This holy institution should have preserved\nand increased her womanly respect and holy dignity; but her chaste,\ndignified, godlike womanhood has been consumed upon the altar\nof base passion; it has been sacrificed to please her husband. She\nsoon loses respect for the husband, who does not regard the laws to\nwhich the brute creation yield obedience. The married life becomes\na galling yoke; for love dies out, and frequently distrust, jealousy,\nand hate take its place.\nNo man can truly love his wife when she will patiently submit\nto become his slave and minister to his depraved passions. In her\npassive submission, she loses the value she once possessed in his\neyes. He sees her dragged down from everything elevating, to a\nlow level; and soon he suspects that she will as tamely submit to be\ndegraded by another as by himself. He doubts her constancy and\npurity, tires of her, and seeks new objects to arouse and intensify his\nhellish passions. The law of God is not regarded. These men are\nworse than brutes; they are demons in human form. They are unac-\nquainted with the elevating, ennobling principles of true, sanctified\nlove.\nThe wife also becomes jealous of the husband and suspects that [475]\nif opportunity should offer he would just as readily pay his addresses\nto another as to her. She sees that he is not controlled by conscience\nor the fear of God; all these sanctified barriers are broken down\nby lustful passions; all that is god-like in the husband is made the\nservant of low, brutish lust.\nThe world is filled with men and women of this order; and neat,\ntasty, yea, expensive houses contain a hell within. Imagine, if you\ncan, what must be the offspring of such parents. Will not the children\nsink still lower in the scale? The parents give the stamp of character\nto their children. Therefore children that are born of these parents\ninherit from them qualities of mind which are of a low, base order.\nAnd Satan nourishes anything tending to corruption. The matter\nnow to be settled is: Shall the wife feel bound to yield implicitly\nto the demands of her husband, when she sees that nothing but\nbase passions control him, and when her reason and judgment are\nconvinced that she does it to the injury of her body, which God has\nenjoined upon her to possess in sanctification and honor, to preserve\nas a living sacrifice to God?\n418 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nIt is not pure, holy love which leads the wife to gratify the animal\npropensities of her husband at the expense of health and life. If she\npossesses true love and wisdom, she will seek to divert his mind\nfrom the gratification of lustful passions to high and spiritual themes\nby dwelling upon interesting spiritual subjects. It may be necessary\nto humbly and affectionately urge, even at the risk of his displeasure,\nthat she cannot debase her body by yielding to sexual excess. She\nshould, in a tender, kind manner, remind him that God has the\nfirst and highest claim upon her entire being, and that she cannot\ndisregard this claim, for she will be held accountable in the great\nday of God. \u201cWhat? know ye not that your body is the temple of the\nHoly Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not[476]\nyour own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in\nyour body, and in your spirit, which are God\u2019s.\u201d \u201cYe are bought with\na price; be not ye the servants of men.\u201d\nIf she will elevate her affections, and in sanctification and honor\npreserve her refined, womanly dignity, woman can do much by her\njudicious influence to sanctify her husband, and thus fulfill her high\nmission. In so doing, she can save both her husband and herself, thus\nperforming a double work. In this matter, so delicate and so difficult\nto manage, much wisdom and patience are necessary, as well as\nmoral courage and fortitude. Strength and grace can be found in\nprayer. Sincere love is to be the ruling principle of the heart. Love to\nGod and love to the husband can alone be the right ground of action.\nLet the wife decide that it is the husband\u2019s prerogative to have\nfull control of her body, and to mold her mind to suit his in every\nrespect, to run in the same channel as his own, and she yields her\nindividuality; her identity is lost, merged in that of her husband. She\nis a mere machine for his will to move and control, a creature of\nhis pleasure. He thinks for her, decides for her, and acts for her.\nShe dishonors God in occupying this passive position. She has a\nresponsibility before God which it is her duty to preserve.\nWhen the wife yields her body and mind to the control of her\nhusband, being passive to his will in all things, sacrificing her con-\nscience, her dignity, and even her identity, she loses the opportunity\nof exerting that mighty influence for good which she should possess\nto elevate her husband. She could soften his stern nature, and her\nsanctifying influence could be exerted in a manner to refine and\nAppeal to the Church 419\npurify, leading him to strive earnestly to govern his passions and\nbe more spiritually minded, that they might be partakers together\nof the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the [477]\nworld through lust. The power of influence can be great to lead the\nmind to high and noble themes, above the low, sensual indulgences\nfor which the heart unrenewed by grace naturally seeks. If the wife\nfeels that in order to please her husband she must come down to his\nstandard, when animal passion is the principal basis of his love and\ncontrols his actions, she displeases God; for she fails to exert a sanc-\ntifying influence upon her husband. If she feels that she must submit\nto his animal passions without a word of remonstrance, she does\nnot understand her duty to him nor to her God. Sexual excess will\neffectually destroy a love for devotional exercises, will take from\nthe brain the substance needed to nourish the system, and will most\neffectively exhaust the vitality. No woman should aid her husband in\nthis work of self-destruction. She will not do it if she is enlightened\nand has true love for him.\nThe more the animal passions are indulged, the stronger do they\nbecome, and the more violent will be their clamors for indulgence.\nLet God-fearing men and women awake to their duty. Many pro-\nfessed Christians are suffering with paralysis of nerve and brain\nbecause of their intemperance in this direction. Rottenness is in the\nbones and marrow of many who are regarded as good men, who\npray and weep, and who stand in high places, but whose polluted\ncarcasses will never pass the portals of the heavenly city.\nOh, that I could make all understand their obligation to God\nto preserve the mental and physical organism in the best condition\nto render perfect service to their Maker! Let the Christian wife\nrefrain, both in word and act, from exciting the animal passions of\nher husband. Many have no strength at all to waste in this direction.\nFrom their youth up they have weakened the brain and sapped the\nconstitution by the gratification of animal passions. Self-denial and\ntemperance should be the watchword in their married life; then the [478]\nchildren born to them will not be so liable to have the moral and\nintellectual organs weak, and the animal strong. Vice in children is\nalmost universal. Is there not a cause? Who have given them the\nstamp of character? May the Lord open the eyes of all to see that\nthey are standing in slippery places!\n420 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nFrom the picture that has been presented before me of the cor-\nruption of men and women professing godliness, I have feared that\nI should altogether lose confidence in humanity. I have seen that a\nfearful stupor is upon nearly all. It is almost impossible to arouse\nthe very ones who should be awakened, so as to have any just sense\nof the power which Satan holds over minds. They are not aware\nof the corruption teeming all around them. Satan has blinded their\nminds and lulled them to carnal security. The failures in our efforts\nto bring others up to understand the great dangers that beset souls\nhave sometimes led me to fear that my ideas of the depravity of\nthe human heart were exaggerated. But when facts are brought to\nus showing the sad deformity of one who has dared to minister in\nsacred things while corrupt at heart, one whose sin-stained hands\nhave profaned the vessels of the Lord, I am sure that I have not\ndrawn the picture any too strong.\nI have been bearing a very strong testimony, both in writing\nand in speaking, hoping to awaken God\u2019s people to understand that\nthey have fallen upon perilous times. I have felt sick at heart at\nthe indifference manifested by those who should understand the\nworkings of Satan, and who ought to be awake and guarded. I\nhave seen that Satan is leading the minds of even those who profess\nthe truth to indulge in the terrible sin of fornication. The mind of\na man or woman does not come down in a moment from purity\nand holiness to depravity, corruption, and crime. It takes time to\ntransform the human to the divine, or to degrade those formed in\nthe image of God to the brutal or the satanic. By beholding we[479]\nbecome changed. Though formed in the image of his Maker, man\ncan so educate his mind that sin which he once loathed will become\npleasant to him. As he ceases to watch and pray, he ceases to guard\nthe citadel, the heart, and engages in sin and crime. The mind is\ndebased, and it is impossible to elevate it from corruption while it\nis being educated to enslave the moral and intellectual powers, and\nbring them in subjection to grosser passions. Constant war against\nthe carnal mind must be maintained; and we must be aided by the\nrefining influence of the grace of God, which will attract the mind\nupward and habituate it to meditate upon pure and holy things.\nThe body is not kept under by many professed Sabbathkeepers.\nSome have embraced the Sabbath whose minds have ever been\nAppeal to the Church 421\ndepraved. And when they embraced the truth they did not feel the\nnecessity of turning square about and changing their whole course\nof action. They have been for years following the inclinations of an\nunregenerate heart, and have been swayed by the corrupt passions\nof their carnal natures, which had defaced the image of God in them\nand defiled everything they touched; therefore their entire future\nlife would be all too short, at the longest, to climb Peter\u2019s ladder of\nChristian perfection, preparatory to their entering into the kingdom\nof God. But there are not many who feel that they cannot be saved\nby a profession of the truth, unless they become sanctified through\nthe truth in answer to the prayer of our divine Lord to His Father:\n\u201cSanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth.\u201d\nMen and women who profess to be disciples of Christ and to\nkeep all the commandments of God will have to feel in their daily\nlives the true spirit of agonizing to enter in at the strait gate. The\nagonizing ones are the only ones who will urge their passage through\nthe strait gate and narrow way that lead to life eternal, to fullness of [480]\njoy and pleasures forevermore. Those who merely seek to enter in\nwill never be able. The entire Christian life of many will be spent in\nno greater effort than that of seeking, and their only reward will be\nto find it an utter impossibility for them to enter in at that strait gate.\nI have been surprised to see how many families are blinded\nby Satan so that they have no sense of his workings, his wiles\nand deceptions, practiced in their very midst. Parents seem to be\nstupefied by the paralyzing influence of the evil one, and yet think\nthey are all right. I have been shown that Satan seeks to debase the\nminds of those who unite in marriage, that he may stamp his own\nhateful image upon their children. Because they have entered into\nthe marriage relation, many think that they may permit themselves\nto be controlled by animal passions. They are led on by Satan,\nwho deceives them and leads them to pervert this sacred institution.\nHe is well pleased with the low level which their minds take; for\nhe has much to gain in this direction. He knows that if he can\nexcite the baser passions, and keep them in the ascendancy, he has\nnothing to be troubled about in their Christian experience; for the\nmoral and intellectual faculties will be subordinate, while the animal\npropensities will predominate and keep in the ascendancy; and these\n422 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nbaser passions will be strengthened by exercise, while the nobler\nqualities will become weaker and weaker.\nHe can mold their posterity much more readily than he could the\nparents, for he can so control the minds of the parents that through\nthem he may give his own stamp of character to their children.\nThus many children are born with the animal passions largely in\nthe ascendancy, while the moral faculties are but feebly developed.\nThese children need the most careful culture to bring out, strengthen,\nand develop the moral and intellectual powers, that these may take\nthe lead. But the workings of Satan are not perceived; his wiles are\nnot understood. Children are not trained for God. Their moral and[481]\nreligious education is neglected. The animal passions are constantly\nstrengthened, while the moral faculties become enfeebled.\nSome children begin to practice self-pollution in their infancy;\nand as they increase in years, the lustful passions grow with their\ngrowth and strengthen with their strength. Their minds are not at\nrest. Girls desire the society of boys, and boys that of the girls. Their\ndeportment is not reserved and modest. They are bold and forward,\nand take indecent liberties. The habit of self-abuse has debased their\nminds and tainted their souls. Vile thoughts, and the reading of\nnovels, love stories, and vile books excite their imagination, and just\nsuch suit their depraved minds. They do not love work, and when\nengaged in labor they complain of fatigue; their backs ache; their\nheads ache. Is there not sufficient cause? Are they fatigued because\nof their labor? No, no! Yet the parents indulge these children in\ntheir complaints, and release them from labor and responsibility.\nThis is the very worst thing that they can do for them. They are thus\nremoving almost the only barrier that prevents Satan from having\nfree access to their weakened minds. Useful labor would in some\nmeasure be a safeguard from his decided control of them.\nWe have some knowledge of Satan\u2019s manner of working and\nhow well he succeeds in it. From what has been shown me, he\nhas paralyzed the minds of parents. They are slow to suspect that\ntheir own children can be wrong and sinful. Some of these children\nprofess to be Christians, and parents sleep on, fearing no danger,\nwhile the minds and bodies of their children are becoming wrecked.\nSome parents do not even take care to keep their children with them\nwhen in the house of God. Young girls attend meetings and take\nAppeal to the Church 423\ntheir seats, it may be, with their parents, but more frequently back in\nthe congregation. They are in the habit of making an excuse to leave [482]\nthe house. Boys understand this, and go out before or after the exit\nof the girls, and then, as the meeting closes, they accompany them\nhome. Parents are none the wiser for this. Again, excuses are made\nto walk, and boys and girls assemble in the fair grounds, or some\nother secluded place, and there play and have a regular high time,\nwith no experienced eye upon them to caution them. They imitate\nmen and women of advanced age.\nThis is a fast age. Little boys and girls commence paying atten-\ntions to one another when they should both be in the nursery, taking\nlessons in modesty of deportment. What is the effect of this common\nmixing up? Does it increase chastity in the youth who thus gather\ntogether? No, indeed! it increases the first lustful passions; after\nsuch meetings the youth are crazed by the devil and give themselves\nup to their vile practices.\nParents are asleep and know not that Satan has planted his hellish\nbanner right in their households. What, I was led to inquire, will\nbecome of the youth in this corrupt age? I repeat, Parents are asleep.\nThe children are infatuated with a lovesick sentimentalism, and the\ntruth has no power to correct the wrong. What can be done to stay\nthe tide of evil? Parents can do much if they will. If a young girl\njust entering her teens is accosted with familiarity by a boy of her\nown age, or older, she should be taught to so resent this that no such\nadvances will ever be repeated. When a girl\u2019s company is frequently\nsought by boys or young men, something is wrong. That young girl\nneeds a mother to show her her place, to restrain her, and teach her\nwhat belongs to a girl of her age.\nThe corrupting doctrine which has prevailed, that, as viewed\nfrom a health standpoint, the sexes must mingle together, has done its\nmischievous work. When parents and guardians manifest one tithe [483]\nof the shrewdness which Satan possesses, then can this association\nof sexes be nearer harmless. As it is, Satan is most successful in his\neffort to bewitch the minds of the youth; and the mingling of boys\nand girls only increases the evil twentyfold. Let boys and girls be\nkept employed in useful labor. If they are tired, they will have less\ninclination to corrupt their own bodies. There is nothing to be hoped\nfor in the case of the young, unless there is an entire change in the\n424 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nminds of those who are older. Vice is stamped upon the features of\nboys and girls, and yet what is done to stay the progress of this evil?\nBoys and young men are allowed and encouraged to take liberties\nby immodest advances of girls and young women. May God arouse\nfathers and mothers to work earnestly to change this terrible state of\nthings, is my prayer.\nI have been looking over the Testimonies given for Sabbathkeep-\ners and I am astonished at the mercy of God and His care for His\npeople in giving them so many warnings, pointing out their dangers,\nand presenting before them the exalted position which He would\nhave them occupy. If they would keep themselves in His love and\nseparate from the world, He would cause His special blessings to rest\nupon them and His light to shine round about them. Their influence\nfor good might be felt in every branch of the work and in every part\nof the gospel field. But if they fail to meet the mind of God, if they\ncontinue to have so little sense of the exalted character of the work\nas they have had in the past, their influence and example will prove\na terrible curse. They will do harm and only harm. The blood of\nprecious souls will be found upon their garments.\nTestimonies of warning have been repeated. I inquire: Who have\nheeded them? Who have been zealous in repenting of their sins and\nidolatry, and have been earnestly pressing toward the mark for the\nprize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus? Who have shown[484]\nthe inward work of God, leading to self-denial and humble self-\nsacrifice? Who that have been warned have so separated themselves\nfrom the world, from its affections and lusts, that they have shown a\ndaily growth in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour\nJesus Christ? Whom do we find among the active ones, that feel\nthe burden for the church? Whom do we see that God is especially\nusing, working by and through them to elevate the standard, and to\nbring the church up to it, that they may prove the Lord and see if He\nwill not pour them out a blessing?\nI have waited anxiously, hoping that God would put His Spirit\nupon some and use them as instruments of righteousness to awaken\nand set in order His church. I have almost despaired as I have seen,\nyear after year, a greater departure from that simplicity which God\nhas shown me should characterize the life of His followers. There\nhas been less and less interest in, and devotion to, the cause of God.\nAppeal to the Church 425\nI ask: Wherein have those who profess confidence in theTestimonies\nsought to live according to the light given in them? Wherein have\nthey regarded the warnings given? Wherein have they heeded the\ninstructions they have received?\nI saw that great changes must be wrought in the hearts and lives\nof very many before God can work in them by His power for the\nsalvation of others. They must be renewed after the image of God,\nin righteousness and true holiness. Then the love of the world, the\nlove of self, and every ambition of life calculated to exalt self will\nbe changed by the grace of God and employed in the special work\nof saving souls for whom Christ died. Humility will take the place\nof pride, and haughty self-esteem will be exchanged for meekness.\nEvery power of the heart will be controlled by disinterested love\nfor all mankind. Satan, I saw, will arouse when they in earnest\ncommence the work of reformation in themselves. He knows that [485]\nthese persons, if consecrated to God, could prove the strength of His\npromises and realize a power working with them that the adversary\nwould not be able to gainsay or resist. They would realize the life of\nGod in the soul.\nOne family in particular have needed all the benefits they could\nreceive from the reform in diet, yet these very ones have been com-\npletely backslidden. Meat and butter have been used by them quite\nfreely, and spices have not been entirely discarded. This family\ncould have received great benefit from a nourishing, well-regulated\ndiet. The head of the family needed plain, nutritious food. His habits\nwere sedentary, and his blood moved sluggishly through the system.\nHe could not, like others, have the benefit of healthful exercise;\ntherefore his food should have been of the right quality and quantity.\nThere has not been in this family the right management in regard\nto diet; there has been irregularity. There should have been a spec-\nified time for each meal, and the food should have been prepared\nin a simple form and free from grease; but pains should have been\ntaken to have it nutritious, healthful, and inviting. In this family,\nas also in many others, a special parade has been made for visitors,\nmany dishes prepared and frequently made too rich, so that those\nseated at the table would be tempted to eat to excess. Then in the\nabsence of company there was a great reaction, a falling off in the\npreparations brought on the table. The diet was spare and lacked\n426 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nnourishment. It was considered not so much matter \u201cjust for our-\nselves.\u201d The meals were frequently picked up, and the regular time\nfor eating not regarded. Every member of the family was injured\nby such management. It is a sin for any of our sisters to make such\ngreat preparations for visitors, and wrong their own families by a\nspare diet which will fail to nourish the system.\nThe brother referred to felt a lack in his system; he was not\nnourished, and he thought that meat would give him the needed[486]\nstrength. Had he been suitably cared for, his table spread at the right\ntime with food of a nourishing quality, all the demands of nature\nwould have been abundantly supplied. The butter and meat stimulate.\nThese have injured the stomach and perverted the taste. The sensitive\nnerves of the brain have been benumbed, and the animal appetite\nstrengthened at the expense of the moral and intellectual faculties.\nThese higher powers, which should control, have been growing\nweaker, so that eternal things have not been discerned. Paralysis has\nbenumbed the spiritual and devotional. Satan has triumphed to see\nhow easily he can come in through the appetite and control men and\nwomen of intelligence, calculated by the Creator to do a good and\ngreat work.\nThe case above referred to is not an isolated one; if it were, I\nwould not introduce it here. When Satan takes possession of the\nmind, how soon the light and instruction that the Lord has graciously\ngiven, fade away and have no force! How many frame excuses and\nmake necessities which have no existence, to bear them up in their\ncourse of wrong in setting aside the light and trampling it underfoot!\nI speak with assurance. The greatest objection to health reform is\nthat this people do not live it out; and yet they will gravely say they\ncannot live the health reform and preserve their strength.\nWe find in every such instance a good reason why they cannot\nlive out the health reform. They do not live it out, and have never\nfollowed it strictly, therefore they cannot be benefited by it. Some\nfall into the error that because they discard meat they have no need to\nsupply its place with the best fruits and vegetables, prepared in their\nmost natural state, free from grease and spices. If they would only\nskillfully arrange the bounties with which the Creator has surrounded\nthem, parents and children with a clear conscience unitedly engaging\nin the work, they would enjoy simple food, and would then be able[487]\nAppeal to the Church 427\nto speak understandingly of health reform. Those who have not been\nconverted to health reform, and have never fully adopted it, are not\njudges of its benefits. Those who digress occasionally to gratify the\ntaste in eating a fattened turkey or other flesh meats, pervert their\nappetites, and are not the ones to judge of the benefits of the system\nof health reform. They are controlled by taste, not by principle.\nI have a well-set table on all occasions. I make no change\nfor visitors, whether believers or unbelievers. I intend never to be\nsurprised by an unreadiness to entertain at my table from one to half\na dozen extra who may chance to come in. I have enough simple,\nhealthful food ready to satisfy hunger and nourish the system. If\nany want more than this, they are at liberty to find it elsewhere. No\nbutter or flesh meats of any kind come on my table. Cake is seldom\nfound there. I generally have an ample supply of fruits, good bread,\nand vegetables. Our table is always well patronized, and all who\npartake of the food do well, and improve upon it. All sit down with\nno epicurean appetite, and eat with a relish the bounties supplied by\nour Creator.\nA wonderful indifference has been manifested upon this impor-\ntant subject by those right at the heart of the work. The lack of\nstability in regard to the principles of health reform is a true index of\ntheir character and their spiritual strength. They are deficient in thor-\noughness in their Christian experience. Conscience is not regarded.\nThe basis or cause of every right action existing and operating in the\nrenewed heart secures obedience without external or selfish motives.\nThe spirit of truth and a good conscience are sufficient to inspire and\nregulate the motives and conduct of those who learn of Christ and\nare like Him. Those who have no strength of religious principle in\nthemselves are easily swayed, by the example of others, in a wrong\ndirection. Those who have never learned their duty from God, and [488]\nacquainted themselves with His purposes concerning them, are not\nreliable in times of severe conflict with the powers of darkness. They\nare swayed by external and present appearances. Worldly men are\ngoverned by worldly principles; they can appreciate no other. But\nChristians should not be governed by these principles. They should\nnot seek to strengthen themselves in the performance of duty by any\nother consideration than a love to obey every requirement of God as\nfound in His word and dictated by an enlightened conscience.\n428 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nIn the renewed heart there will be a fixed principle to obey the\nwill of God, because there is a love for what is just, and good,\nand holy. There will be no hesitating, conferring with the taste,\nor studying of convenience, or moving in a certain course because\nothers do so. Everyone should live for himself. The minds of all\nwho are renewed by grace will be an open medium, continually\nreceiving light, grace, and truth from above, and transmitting the\nsame to others. Their works are fruitful. Their fruit is unto holiness,\nand the end everlasting life.\nBut very few have an experimental knowledge of the sanctifying\ninfluence of the truths which they profess. Their obedience and\ndevotion have not been in accordance with their light and privileges.\nThey have no real sense of the obligation resting upon them to walk\nas children of the light, and not as children of darkness. If the light\nthat has been given to these had been given Sodom and Gomorrah,\nthey would have repented in sackcloth and ashes, and would have\nescaped the signal wrath of God. It will be more tolerable for Sodom\nand Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for those who have been\nprivileged with the clear light, and have had a vast amount of labor,\nbut have not profited by it. They have neglected the great salvation\nwhich God in mercy was willing to bestow. They were so blinded[489]\nby the devil that they verily thought themselves rich and in the favor\nof God, when the True Witness declares them to be wretched, and\nmiserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\n* * * * *\nChapter 60\u2014A Cross in Accepting the Truth\nDear Sister U,\nI am somewhat acquainted with your peculiar temperament, your\ncaution, your fears, your lack of hope and confidence. I sympathize\nwith you in your sufferings of mind, as you cannot see everything\nin regard to our position and faith as clearly as you could wish. We\nknow you to be strictly conscientious, and have not a doubt that,\ncould you have the privilege of hearing on all points of present\ntruth, and of weighing the evidences for yourself, you would be\nestablished, strengthened, settled, so that opposition or reproach\nwould not move you from the sure foundation. As you have not\nhad the privilege, as many others have, of attending meetings and\nexperiencing for yourself the evidences attending the presentation\nof the truth we hold sacred, we feel the more solicitous for you. Our\nhearts are drawn out after you, and our love toward you is sincere and\nfervent. We fear that amid the perils of these last days you may make\nshipwreck. Be not grieved with me for thus writing. You cannot\nhave a full sense, as I have, of the wiles and sophistry of Satan. His\ndeceptions are many; his snares are carefully and cunningly prepared\nto entangle the unwary and unsuspecting. We want you to escape\nhis wiles; we want you to be fully on the Lord\u2019s side, loving, and\nwaiting and earnestly longing for, the appearing of our Saviour in\nthe clouds of heaven.\nSince your first efforts to keep the Sabbath, many things have\narisen to discourage you; yet we hope that these things will not divert [490]\nyour mind from the important truths for these last days. Although\nthe advocates of the truth do not all do as they should, because they\nare unsanctified by the truths they profess, the truth is the same; its\nluster is undimmed. Although these may stand between the truth and\nthose who have not fully taken hold upon it, and their dark shadow\nmay appear for a time to cloud its bright luster, yet it does not in\nreality; the truth of heavenly origin is undimmed. Its purity and\nexalted character are changeless. It lives; for it is immortal.\n429\n430 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nMy beloved sister, cling to the truth. Obtain an experience for\nyourself. You have an individuality. You are accountable only for\nthe manner in which you, independent of all others, use the light that\nshines upon your pathway. The lack of consecration in others will be\nno excuse for you. The fact that they pervert the truth by their wrong\ncourse of action, because they are unsanctified by it, will not render\nyou less responsible. A solemn obligation rests upon you to exalt\nthe standard of truth, to bear it aloft. Even if the standard-bearer\nfaints and falls, do not leave the precious standard to trail in the dust.\nSeize it, and bear it aloft, even at the peril of your good name, your\nworldly honor, and your life, if required. My much-respected sister,\nI entreat you to look up. Cling fast to your heavenly Father\u2019s hand.\nJesus, our Advocate, lives to make intercession for us. Whoever may\ndeny the faith by their unholy lives, it does not change the truth into\na lie. \u201cNevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this\nseal, The Lord knoweth them that are His.\u201d \u201cWatch ye and pray, lest\nye enter into temptation.\u201d At times I fear that your feet will slide,\nthat you will refuse to walk in the humble, straight, and narrow way\nwhich leads to eternal life in the kingdom of glory.\nI present before you the life of self-denial, humility, and sacrifice\nof our divine Lord. The Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, left[491]\nHis riches, His splendor, His honor and glory, and, in order to save\nsinful man, condescended to a life of humility, poverty, and shame;\n\u201cwho for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising\nthe shame.\u201d Oh, why are we so sensitive to trial and reproach, to\nshame and suffering, when our Lord has given us such an example?\nWho would wish to enter into the joy of their Lord while they were\nunwilling to partake of His sufferings? What! the servant unwilling\nto bear the humility and shame and reproach which the Master bore\nunselfishly for him! the servant shrinking from a life of humility and\nsacrifice which is for his own eternal happiness, by which he may\nfinally obtain an exceedingly great, an eternal reward! The language\nof my heart is: Let me be a partaker with Christ of His sufferings,\nthat I may finally share with Him the glory.\nThe truth of God has never been popular with the world. The\nnatural heart is ever averse to the truth. I thank God that we must\nrenounce the love of the world, and pride of heart, and everything\nwhich tends to idolatry, in order to be followers of the Man of Cal-\nCross in Accepting the Truth 431\nvary. Those who obey the truth will never be loved and honored by\nthe world. From the lips of the divine Teacher, as He walked in hu-\nmility among the children of men, were heard the words: Whosoever\nwill be My disciple, let him take up his cross, and follow Me. Yes,\nfollow our Exemplar. Was He seeking for praise and honor of men?\nOh, no! Shall we then seek for honor or praise from worldlings?\nThose who have no love for God will not love the children of\nGod. Listen to the words of heavenly instruction: \u201cWoe unto you,\nwhen all men shall speak well of you.\u201d \u201cBlessed are ye, when men\nshall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company,\nand shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son\nof man\u2019s sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold,\nyour reward is great in heaven.\u201d \u201cBut woe unto you that are rich! for [492]\nye have received your consolation.\u201d In the Gospel of John we again\nfind the words of Christ: \u201cThese things I command you, that ye love\none another. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated Me before\nit hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own:\nbut because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the\nworld, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I\nsaid unto you, The servant is not greater than his Lord. If they have\npersecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept My\nsaying, they will keep yours also.\u201d \u201cI have given them Thy word;\nand the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world,\neven as I am not of the world. I pray not that Thou shouldest take\nthem out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the\nevil. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\u201d\nIn First John we read: \u201cLove not the world, neither the things that\nare in the world.\u201d In Paul\u2019s Epistle to the Romans he beseeches them,\nby the mercies of God, that they present their bodies a living sacri-\nfice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is their reasonable service.\n\u201cAnd be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the\nrenewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and ac-\nceptable, and perfect, will of God.\u201d And James declares: \u201cKnow ye\nnot that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever\ntherefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\u201d\nI entreat you to carefully consider the instructions in Paul\u2019s\nEpistle to the Galatians: \u201cFor do I now persuade men, or God? or\ndo I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be\n432 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthe servant of Christ.\u201d I fear that you are in great danger of making\nshipwreck of faith. You consider that you have sacrifices to make to\nobey the truth. We believe that you have made some sacrifices, but\nhad you been more thorough in this work, your feet would not now[493]\nbe stumbling, your faith wavering. I do not refer now to sacrifice\nof means, but to what comes closer than this, to that which would\ncause you a more painful conflict than to give your means, to that\nwhich touches self especially. You have not yielded your pride, your\nlove of the approbation of an unbelieving world. You love to have\nmen speak well of you.\nYou have not received and practiced the truth in its simplicity.\nYou have, I fear, felt somewhat as though you were condescending\nto receive the unpopular truth as advocated by Sabbathkeeping Ad-\nventists. You have sought, to quite a degree, to retain the spirit of\nthe world and yet adopt the truth. This cannot be. Christ will accept\nof nothing but the whole heart, the entire affections. The friendship\nof the world is enmity with God. When you desire to so live as to\nshun reproach, you are seeking a position above your suffering Lord;\nand while engaged in this, you are separating from your Father in\nheaven, exchanging His love for that which is not worth obtaining.\nI have felt pressed in spirit in regard to you, my sister, and also\nyour husband. As I have taken my pen to write, your cases have\nbeen clearly brought before me. I am fully aware of your dangers, of\nyour state of perplexity and doubt. Everything has been unfavorable\nfor you, Sister U, since you have sought to obey the law of God. But\nnothing has been as great a hindrance to you both as your pride. You\nare both fond of display; this has no part in good, humble religion.\nI saw that you both had a fiery ordeal to pass, that you would be\ntested and proved. In this conflict, Satan would strive hard to blind\nyour eyes to your eternal interest, and would present the advantages\nof the present time, this little, short life which is so uncertain. You\nwould see charms in this life, and unless you parted with your love\nof show and the favor of the world you could not retain the love of[494]\nGod. Jesus was presented to me, pointing to the charms of heaven,\nseeking to attract your eyes from the world, and saying: \u201cWhich\nwill ye choose, Me, or the world? You cannot have Me and the love\nof the world, too. Will you sacrifice Him who died for you for the\nCross in Accepting the Truth 433\npride of life, for the treasures of the world? Choose between Me and\nthe world; the world has no part in Me.\u201d\nI saw your feet faltering, your faith wavering. Doubt and unbelief\nwere enclosing you about, and the light of Jesus was departing.\nVanity is one of the strongest principles of our depraved natures, and\nSatan will constantly appeal to it with success. Persons have not\nbeen wanting who were ready to aid Satan in his work\u2014to flatter\nyou, to present your ability and the influence you could have in\nsociety, to urge that it would be a great pity for you to unite your\ninterests with a people of humble faith and mingle in a class of\nsociety, as they regard it, beneath you. It has seemed to you that\nyou were making a great sacrifice for the truth. It is true that the\nmasses who possess influence do not choose to sacrifice their worldly\nambition, to separate their affections from the world, and turn their\nfootsteps into the narrow, humble path traveled by the suffering Man\nof Calvary. They consider their talents and influence too precious\nto be devoted to the cause of God, too precious to be given back to\nglorify the Giver who lent them these talents to be improved upon\nand returned to Him, both principal and interest. For the temporal\nadvantages they hope to gain they will sacrifice the eternal. For the\nflattery of men they will turn from the approval of the Lord, the\nMaker of the heavens and the earth, and will forfeit all right to the\nhonor which cometh from above. How few know what is for their\nbest interest! You do not appreciate this. Jesus, through a life of\nunexampled suffering and an ignominious death, has opened a way\nwhereby man may follow in His footsteps, and finally be exalted to [495]\nHis throne, and receive the reward of immortality and eternal life.\nFor a life of obedience he will receive an immortal inheritance, a\ntreasure undefiled that fadeth not away.\nIn the First Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians we read: \u201cFor\nthe preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but\nunto us which are saved it is the power of God. For it is written, I\nwill destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the\nunderstanding of the prudent.\u201d \u201cFor ye see your calling, brethren,\nhow that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not\nmany noble, are called: but God hath chosen the foolish things of the\nworld to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of\nthe world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things\n434 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nof the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea,\nand things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: that no\nflesh should glory in His presence.\u201d You have the example of Christ,\nHis unpretending life without display or grandeur. Is the servant\nabove his Lord?\nDear sister, you have a good mind and can do good. You can be\nas an anchor to your husband and a strength to many others. But if\nyou stand halting between two opinions, unreconciled to the humble\nwork of God, your influence in connection with your husband\u2019s will\nbe exerted in a wrong direction. How reads the word of God? Turn\nfrom the opinions of men to the law and to the testimony. Shut\nout every worldly consideration. Make your decision for eternity.\nWeigh evidence in this important time. We surely need not expect\nto escape trial and persecution in following our Saviour; for this is\nthe salary of those who follow Him. He plainly declares that we\nshall suffer persecution. Our earthly interests must be subservient to\nthe eternal. Listen to the words of Christ: \u201cThen Peter began to say\nunto Him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed Thee. And Jesus [496]\nanswered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath\nleft house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or\nchildren, or lands, for My sake, and the gospel\u2019s, but he shall receive\nan hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters,\nand mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the\nworld to come eternal life.\u201d Eternal interests are here involved.\nDo not flatter yourselves that if you should yield the truth all\nobstacles to your acquiring property would be removed. Satan tells\nyou this; it is his sophistry. If God\u2019s blessing rests upon you because\nyou surrender all to Him, you will prosper. If you turn from God, He\nwill turn from you. His hand can scatter faster than you can gather.\n\u201cWhat is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose\nhis own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d\nYou, my dear sister, need a thorough conversion to the truth,\nwhich shall slay self. Cannot you trust in God? Please read Matthew\n10:25-40. Please read also, with a prayerful heart, Matthew 6:24-34.\nLet these words impress your heart: \u201cTake no thought for your life,\nwhat ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,\nwhat ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body\nthan raiment?\u201d The better life is here referred to. By the body is\nCross in Accepting the Truth 435\nmeant the inward adorning, which makes sinful mortals, possessing\nthe meekness and righteousness of Christ, valuable in His sight,\nas was Enoch, and entitles them to receive the finishing touch of\nimmortality. Our Saviour refers us to the fowls of the air, which sow\nnot, neither reap, nor gather into barns, yet their heavenly Father\nfeedeth them. Then He says: \u201cAre ye not much better than they? ...\nAnd why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field,\nhow they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto\nyou, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of [497]\nthese.\u201d These lilies, in their simplicity and innocence, meet the mind\nof God better than Solomon in his costly decorations yet destitute of\nthe heavenly adorning. \u201cWherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the\nfield, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall He\nnot much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?\u201d Can you not trust in\nyour heavenly Father? Can you not rest upon His gracious promise?\n\u201cSeek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all\nthese things shall be added unto you.\u201d Precious promise! Can we\nnot rely upon it? Can we not have implicit trust, knowing that He\nis faithful who hath promised? I entreat you to let your trembling\nfaith again grasp the promises of God. Bear your whole weight upon\nthem with unwavering faith; for they will not, they cannot, fail.\n436 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nNumber Nineteen\u2014Testimony for the [498]\nChurch\nChapter 61\u2014Address to Ministers\nDear Brethren,\nOctober 25, 1868, I was shown that not all who profess to be\ncalled to teach the truth are qualified for this sacred work. Some\nare far from meeting the mind and will of God. Some indulge in\nslothfulness in temporal things, and their religious life is marked\nwith spiritual sloth. Where there is a lack of persevering energy and\nclose application in temporal matters and business transactions, the\nsame deficiency will be apparent in spiritual things.\nSome of you are heads of families, and your example and influ-\nence are molding the characters of your children. Your example will\nbe followed by them in a greater or less degree, and your lack of\nthoroughness is setting a bad example for others. But your deficien-\ncies are more sensibly felt, with more weighty results, in the cause\nand work of God. Your families have felt this deficiency and suf-\nfered on account of it; they have lacked many things which diligent\nindustry and perseverance might have supplied. But this deficiency\nhas been seen and felt in the cause and work of God in as much\ngreater degree as His cause and work is of higher importance than\nthe things pertaining to this life.\nThe influence of some ministers is not good. They have not\ncarefully guarded their moments, thus giving the people an example[499]\nof industry. They spend in indolence moments and hours which, once\npassed into eternity with their record of results, can never be recalled.\nSome are naturally indolent, which makes it difficult for them to\nmake a success of any enterprise they undertake. This deficiency\nhas been seen and felt all through their religious experience. Those\nat fault are not alone the losers; others are made to suffer by their\ndeficiencies. At this late period, many have lessons to learn which\nshould have been learned at a much earlier date.\nSome are not close Bible students. They are disinclined to apply\nthemselves diligently to the study of God\u2019s word. In consequence of\nthis neglect they have labored at great disadvantage and have not, in\n438\nAddress to Ministers 439\ntheir ministerial efforts, accomplished one tenth of the work which\nthey might have done had they seen the necessity of closely applying\ntheir minds to the study of the word. They might have become so\nfamiliar with the Scriptures, so fortified with Bible arguments, that\nthey could meet opponents and so present the reasons of our faith\nthat the truth would triumph and silence their opposition.\nThose who minister in the word must have as thorough a knowl-\nedge of that word as it is possible for them to obtain. They must\nbe continually searching, praying, and learning, or the people of\nGod will advance in the knowledge of His word and will, and leave\nthese professed teachers far behind. Who will instruct the people\nwhen they are in advance of their teachers? All the efforts of such\nministers are fruitless. There is need that the people teach them the\nword of God more perfectly before they are capable of instructing\nothers.\nSome might now have been thorough workmen had they made\na good use of their time, feeling that they would have to give an\naccount to God for their misspent moments. They have displeased\nGod because they have not been industrious. Self-gratification, self-\nlove, and selfish love of ease have kept some from good, withheld [500]\nthem from obtaining a knowledge of the Scriptures that they might\nbe thoroughly furnished unto all good works. Some do not appreciate\nthe value of time and have idled away in bed the hours that might\nhave been employed in the study of the Bible. There are a few\nsubjects that they have dwelt upon the most, with which they are\nfamiliar, and upon these they can speak with acceptance; but they\nhave in a great degree rested the matter here. They have not felt\naltogether satisfied with themselves, and have at times realized their\ndeficiencies; yet they have not been sufficiently awakened to the\ncrime of neglecting to become acquainted with the word of God,\nwhich they profess to teach. On account of their ignorance the\npeople are disappointed; they do not receive the intelligence which\nthey might obtain from them and which they expect to obtain from\nministers of Christ.\nBy rising early and economizing their moments, ministers can\nfind time for a close investigation of the Scriptures. They must have\nperseverance, and not be thwarted in their object, but persistently\nemploy their time in a study of the word, bringing to their aid the\n440 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ntruths which other minds, through wearing labor, have brought out\nfor them, and with diligent, persevering effort, prepared to their hand.\nThere are ministers who have been laboring for years, teaching the\ntruth to others, while they themselves are not familiar with the strong\npoints of our position. I beg of such to have done with their idleness.\nIt is a continual curse to them. God requires them to make every\nmoment fruitful of some good to themselves or to others. \u201cNot\nslothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\u201d \u201cHe also\nthat is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.\u201d\nIt is important for ministers of Christ to see the necessity of self-\nculture, in order to adorn their profession and maintain a becoming\ndignity. Without mental training they will certainly fail in everything[501]\nthey undertake. I have been shown that there is a decided lack with\nsome who preach the word. God is not pleased with their ways and\nideas. Their haphazard manner of quoting Scripture is a disgrace to\ntheir profession. They claim to be teachers of the word, and yet fail\nto repeat Scripture correctly. Those who give themselves wholly to\nthe preaching of the word should not be guilty of quoting one text\nincorrectly. God requires thoroughness of all His servants.\nThe religion of Christ will be exemplified by its possessor in\nthe life, in the conversation, in the works. Its strong principles will\nprove an anchor. Those who are teachers of the word should be pat-\nterns of piety, ensamples to the flock. Their example should rebuke\nidleness, slothfulness, lack of industry and economy. The principles\nof religion exact diligence, industry, economy, and honesty. \u201cGive\nan account of thy stewardship\u201d will soon be heard by all. Brethren,\nwhat account could you render if the Master should now appear?\nYou are unready. You would as surely be reckoned with the slothful\nservants as they exist. Precious moments are yet left you. I entreat\nyou to redeem the time.\nPaul exhorted Timothy: \u201cStudy to show thyself approved unto\nGod, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the\nword of truth.\u201d \u201cBut foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing\nthat they do gender strifes. And the servant of the Lord must not\nstrive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness\ninstructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will\ngive them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; and that\nAddress to Ministers 441\nthey may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are\ntaken captive by him at his will.\u201d\nIn order to accomplish the work which God requires of them,\nministers need to be qualified for their position. The apostle Paul, [502]\nin his letter to the Colossians, speaks thus concerning his ministry:\n\u201cWhereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of\nGod which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God; even\nthe mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations,\nbut now is made manifest to His saints: to whom God would make\nknown what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the\nGentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: whom we\npreach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom;\nthat we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: whereunto I\nalso labor, striving according to His working, which worketh in me\nmightily.\u201d\nNo less sacred appreciation of and devotion to the work of the\nministry does God require of His servants who are living so near the\nend of all things. He cannot accept the work of laborers unless they\nrealize in their own hearts the life and power of the truth which they\npresent to others. He will not accept of anything short of earnest,\nactive, zealous heart labor. Vigilance and fruitfulness are required\nfor this great work. God wants unselfish workmen, those who will\nlabor with disinterested benevolence and give their undivided interest\nto the work.\nBrethren, you lack devotion and consecration to the work. Your\nhearts are selfish. The deficiencies in you must be supplied, or you\nwill erelong meet with a fatal disappointment\u2014you will lose heaven.\nGod does not lightly regard a neglect of the faithful performance of\nthe work which He has left His servants to do. Enduring energy and\na constant reliance upon God are lacking in many who are laboring\nin the ministry. The result of this lack brings great burdens upon the\nfew who possess these qualities, and they are necessitated to make\nup the deficiencies so apparent in those who might be able workmen\nif they would become so. There are a few who are working day and [503]\nnight, depriving themselves of rest and social enjoyments, taxing the\nbrain to the utmost, each performing the labor of three men, wearing\naway their valuable lives to do the work that others might do, but\nneglect. Some are too lazy to perform their part; many ministers are\n442 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ncarefully preserving themselves by shunning burdens, remaining in\na state of inefficiency, and accomplishing next to nothing. Therefore\nthose who realize the worth of souls, who appreciate the sacredness\nof the work and feel that it must go forward, are doing extra labor,\nmaking superhuman efforts, and using up their brain power to keep\nthe work moving. Were the interest in the work and the devotion to\nit equally divided, were all who profess to be ministers diligently\ndevoting their interest wholly to the cause, not saving themselves,\nthe few earnest, God-fearing workmen who are fast wearing away\ntheir lives would be relieved of this high pressure upon them, and\ntheir strength might be preserved so that, when actually required, it\nwould tell with double power, and produce far greater results than\ncan now be seen while under the pressure of overwhelming care and\nanxiety. The Lord is not pleased with this inequality.\nMany who profess to be called of God to minister in word and\ndoctrine do not feel that they have no right to claim to be teachers\nunless they are thoroughly furnished by earnest, diligent study of\nthe word of God. Some have neglected to obtain a knowledge of\nthe simple branches of education. Some cannot even read correctly;\nsome misquote the Scriptures; and some, by their apparent lack of\nqualification for the work they are trying to do, injure the cause of\nGod and bring the truth into disrepute. These do not see the necessity\nof cultivating the intellect, of especially encouraging refinement\nwithout affectation, and of seeking to attain to the true elevation of\nChristian character. The certain and effectual means of attaining this\nis the surrender of the soul to God. He will direct the intellect and[504]\naffections so that they will center upon the divine and eternal, and\nthen will they possess energy without rashness, for all the powers\nof the mind and of the whole being will be elevated, refined, and\ndirected in the loftiest, holiest channel. From the lips of the heavenly\nTeacher were heard the words: \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God\nwith all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind,\nand with all thy strength.\u201d When this submission to God is made,\ntrue humility will grace every action, while at the same time those\nwho are thus allied to God and His heavenly angels will possess a\nbecoming dignity savoring of heaven.\nThe Lord requires His servants to be energetic. It is not pleasing\nto Him to see them listless and indolent. They profess to have the\nAddress to Ministers 443\nevidence that God has especially selected them to teach the people\nthe way to life; yet frequently their conversation is not profitable, and\nthey show that they have not the burden of the work upon them. Their\nown souls are not energized by the mighty truths which they present\nto others. Some preach these truths, of such weighty importance, in\nso listless a manner that they cannot affect the people. \u201cWhatsoever\nthy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.\u201d Men whom God has\ncalled must be trained to put forth effort, to work earnestly and with\nuntiring zeal for Him, to pull souls out of the fire. When ministers\nfeel the power of the truth in their own souls, thrilling their own\nbeing, then will they possess power to affect hearts, and show that\nthey firmly believe the truths they preach to others. They should\nkeep before the mind the worth of souls, and the matchless depths\nof a Saviour\u2019s love. This will awaken the soul so that with David\nthey may say: \u201cMy heart was hot within me, while I was musing the\nfire burned.\u201d\nPaul exhorted Timothy: \u201cLet no man despise thy youth; but be\nthou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, [505]\nin spirit, in faith, in purity. Till I come, give attendance to reading, to\nexhortation, to doctrine.\u201d \u201cMeditate upon these things; give thyself\nwholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. Take heed unto\nthyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this\nthou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.\u201d What a weight\nof importance is here attached to the Christian life of the minister\nof God! What a necessity for his faithful study of the word, that he\nhimself may be sanctified by the truth and may be qualified to teach\nothers.\nBrethren, you are required to exemplify the truth in your life.\nBut those who think that they have a work to do to teach others the\ntruth are not all converted, and sanctified by the truth. Some have\nerroneous ideas of what constitutes a Christian and of the means\nthrough which a firm religious experience is obtained; much less do\nthey understand the qualifications that God requires His ministers\nto possess. These men are unsanctified. They have occasionally\na flight of feeling, which gives them the impression that they are\nindeed children of God. This dependence upon impressions is one of\nthe special deceptions of Satan. Those who are thus exercised make\ntheir religion a matter of circumstance. Firm principle is wanting.\n444 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nNone are living Christians unless they have a daily experience in the\nthings of God and daily practice self-denial, cheerfully bearing the\ncross and following Christ. Every living Christian will advance daily\nin the divine life. As he advances toward perfection, he experiences\na conversion to God every day; and this conversion is not completed\nuntil he attains to perfection of Christian character, a full preparation\nfor the finishing touch of immortality.\nGod should be the highest object of our thoughts. Meditating\nupon Him and pleading with Him, elevate the soul and quicken the\naffections. A neglect of meditation and prayer will surely result in[506]\na declension in religious interests. Then will be seen carelessness\nand slothfulness. Religion is not merely an emotion, a feeling.\nIt is a principle which is interwoven with all the daily duties and\ntransactions of life. Nothing will be entertained, no business engaged\nin, which will prevent the accompaniment of this principle. To retain\npure and undefiled religion, it is necessary to be workers, persevering\nin effort. We must do something ourselves. No one else can do our\nwork. None but ourselves can work out our salvation with fear and\ntrembling. This is the very work which the Lord has left for us to\ndo.\nSome ministers who profess to be called of God have the blood\nof souls on their garments. They are surrounded with backsliders\nand sinners, and yet feel no burden for their souls; they manifest an\nindifference in regard to their salvation. Some are so nearly asleep\nthat they seem to have no sense of the work of a gospel minister.\nThey do not consider that as spiritual physicians they are required to\nhave skill in administering to souls diseased with sin. The work of\nwarning sinners, of weeping over them and pleading with them, has\nbeen neglected until many souls are past all cure. Some have died in\ntheir sins, and will in the judgment confront with reproaches of their\nguilt those who might have saved them, but who did not. Unfaithful\nministers, what a retribution awaits you!\nThe ministers of Christ need a new anointing, that they may\nmore clearly discern sacred things, and have clear conceptions of the\nholy, blameless character which they themselves must form in order\nto be ensamples to the flock. Nothing that we can do of ourselves\nwill bring us up to the high standard where God can accept us as His\nambassadors. Only a firm reliance upon God, and a strong and active\nAddress to Ministers 445\nfaith, will accomplish the work that He requires to be wrought in us.\nGod calls for working men. It is continuance in well-doing that will [507]\nform characters for heaven. In plainness, in faithfulness and love,\nwe must appeal to the people to prepare for the day of God. Some\nwill need to be entreated with earnestness before they will be moved.\nLet the labor be characterized by meekness and humility, yet by an\nearnestness that will make them understand that these things are a\nreality, and that life and death are for them to choose. The salvation\nof the soul is not a matter to be trifled with. The deportment of the\nlaborer for God should be serious and characterized by simplicity and\ntrue Christian politeness, yet he should be fearfully in earnest in the\nwork which the Master has left him to do. Decided perseverance in a\ncourse of righteousness, disciplining the mind by religious exercises\nto love devotion and heavenly things, will bring the greatest amount\nof happiness.\nIf we make God our trust, we have it in our power to control the\nmind in these things. Through continued exercise it will become\nstrong to battle with internal foes and to subdue self, until there is a\ncomplete transformation, and the passions, appetites, and will are\nbrought into perfect subjection. Then there will be daily piety at\nhome and abroad, and when we engage in labor for souls, a power\nwill attend our efforts. The humble Christian will have seasons\nof devotion which are not spasmodic, fitful, or superstitious, but\ncalm and tranquil, deep, constant, and earnest. The love of God,\nthe practice of holiness, will be pleasant when there is a perfect\nsurrender to God.\nThe reason why ministers of Christ are no more successful in\ntheir labors is that they are not unselfishly devoted to the work. The\ninterest of some is divided; they are double-minded. The cares of\nthis life engage their attention, and they do not realize how sacred is\nthe work of the minister. Such may complain of darkness, of great\nunbelief, of infidelity. The reason for this is, they are not right with\nGod; they do not see the importance of making a full and entire\nconsecration to Him. They serve God a little, but themselves more. [508]\nThey pray but little.\nThe Majesty of heaven, while engaged in His earthly ministry,\nprayed much to His Father. He was frequently bowed all night\nin prayer. His spirit was often sorrowful as He felt the powers\n446 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nof the darkness of this world, and He left the busy city and the\nnoisy throng, to seek a retired place to make His intercessions.\nThe Mount of Olives was the favorite resort of the Son of God for\nHis devotions. Frequently after the multitude had left Him for the\nretirement of the night, He rested not, though weary with the labors\nof the day. In the Gospel of John we read: \u201cAnd every man went\nunto his own house. Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives.\u201d While\nthe city was hushed in silence, and the disciples had returned to their\nhomes to obtain refreshment in sleep, Jesus slept not. His divine\npleadings were ascending to His Father from the Mount of Olives\nthat His disciples might be kept from the evil influences which they\nwould daily encounter in the world, and that His own soul might\nbe strengthened and braced for the duties and trials of the coming\nday. All night, while His followers were sleeping, was their divine\nTeacher praying. The dew and frost of night fell upon His head\nbowed in prayer. His example is left for His followers.\nThe Majesty of heaven, while engaged in His mission, was often\nin earnest prayer. He did not always visit Olivet, for His disciples\nhad learned His favorite retreat, and often followed Him. He chose\nthe stillness of night, when there would be no interruption. Jesus\ncould heal the sick and raise the dead. He was Himself a source of\nblessing and strength. He commanded even the tempests, and they\nobeyed Him. He was unsullied with corruption, a stranger to sin; yet\nHe prayed, and that often with strong crying and tears. He prayed\nfor His disciples and for Himself, thus identifying Himself with our\nneeds, our weaknesses, and our failings, which are so common with[509]\nhumanity. He was a mighty petitioner, not possessing the passions\nof our human, fallen natures, but compassed with like infirmities,\ntempted in all points even as we are. Jesus endured agony which\nrequired help and support from His Father.\nChrist is our example. Are the ministers of Christ tempted and\nfiercely buffeted by Satan? so also was He who knew no sin. He\nturned to His Father in these hours of distress. He came to earth that\nHe might provide a way whereby we could find grace and strength\nto help in every time of need, by following His example in frequent,\nearnest prayer. If the ministers of Christ will imitate this pattern,\nthey will be imbued with His spirit, and angels will minister unto\nthem.\nAddress to Ministers 447\nAngels ministered to Jesus, yet their presence did not make\nHis life one of ease and freedom from severe conflict and fierce\ntemptations. He was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without\nsin. If ministers, while engaged in the work which the Master has\nappointed them to do, have trials and perplexities and temptations,\nshould they be discouraged, when they know that there is One who\nhas endured all these before them? Should they cast away their\nconfidence because they do not realize all that they expect from their\nlabors? Christ labored earnestly for His own nation; but His efforts\nwere despised by the very ones He came to save, and they put to\ndeath Him who came to give them life.\nThere is a sufficient number of ministers, but a great lack of\nlaborers. Laborers, co-workers with God, have a sense of the sa-\ncredness of the work and of the severe conflicts they must meet in\norder to carry it forward successfully. Laborers will not faint and\ndespond in view of the labor, arduous though it may be. In the\nEpistle to the Romans Paul says: \u201cTherefore being justified by faith,\nwe have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom\nalso we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and\nrejoice in hope of the glory of God. And not only so, but we glory [510]\nin tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and\npatience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not\nashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by\nthe Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\u201d In Him are all the treasures\nof wisdom and knowledge. We are without excuse if we fail to\navail ourselves of the ample provisions made for us that we might\nbe wanting in nothing. Shrinking from hardships, complaining un-\nder tribulation, makes the servants of God weak and inefficient in\nbearing responsibilities and burdens.\nAll who stand unshrinkingly in the forefront of the battle must\nfeel the special warfare of Satan against them. As they realize his\nattacks, they will flee to the Stronghold. They feel their need of\nspecial strength from God, and they labor in His strength; therefore\nthe victories they gain do not exalt them, but lead them in faith to lean\nmore securely upon the Mighty One. Deep and fervent gratitude to\nGod is awakened in their hearts, and they are joyful in the tribulation\nwhich they experience while pressed by the enemy. These willing\n448 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nservants are gaining an experience and forming a character which\nwill do honor to the cause of God.\nThe present is a season of solemn privilege and sacred trust to\nthe servants of God. If these trusts are faithfully kept, great will be\nthe reward of the faithful servant when the Master shall say: \u201cGive\nan account of thy stewardship.\u201d The earnest toil, the unselfish work,\nthe patient, persevering effort, will be rewarded abundantly; Jesus\nwill say: Henceforth I call you not servants, but friends, guests. The\napproval of the Master is not given because of the greatness of the\nwork performed, because many things have been gained, but because\nof the fidelity in even a few things. It is not the great results we\nattain, but the motives from which we act, that weigh with God. He[511]\nprizes goodness and faithfulness more than the greatness of the work\naccomplished.\nI have been shown that many are in the greatest danger of failing\nto perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord. Ministers are in danger\nof losing their own souls. Some who have preached to others will\nthemselves be cast away because they have not perfected a Christian\ncharacter. In their labor they do not save souls, and fail even to\nsave their own. They do not see the importance of self-knowledge\nand self-control. They do not watch and pray, lest they enter into\ntemptation. If they would watch, they would become acquainted\nwith their weak points, where they are most likely to be assailed\nby temptation. With watchfulness and prayer their weakest points\ncan be so guarded as to become their strongest points, and they can\nencounter temptation without being overcome. Every follower of\nChrist should daily examine himself, that he may become perfectly\nacquainted with his own conduct. There is with nearly all a neglect\nof self-examination. This neglect is positively dangerous in one\nwho professes to be a mouthpiece for God, occupying the fearful,\nresponsible position of receiving the words from God to give to\nHis people. The daily conduct of such a person has great influence\nupon others. If he has any success in labor, he brings his converts to\nhis own low standard, and it is seldom that they rise higher. Their\nminister\u2019s ways, his words, his gestures and manners, his faith, and\nhis piety, are considered a sample of those of all Sabbathkeeping\nAdventists; and if they pattern after him who has taught them the\ntruth, they think they are doing all their duty.\nAddress to Ministers 449\nThere is much in the conduct of a minister that he can improve.\nMany see and feel their lack, yet they seem to be ignorant of the\ninfluence they exert. They are conscious of their actions as they per-\nform them, but suffer them to pass from their memory, and therefore [512]\ndo not reform. If ministers would make the actions of each day a\nsubject of careful thought and deliberate review, with the object to\nbecome acquainted with their own habits of life, they would better\nknow themselves. By a close scrutiny of their daily life under all\ncircumstances they would know their own motives, the principles\nwhich actuate them. This daily review of our acts, to see whether\nconscience approves or condemns, is necessary for all who wish\nto arrive at the perfection of Christian character. Many acts which\npass for good works, even deeds of benevolence, will, when closely\ninvestigated, be found to be prompted by wrong motives. Many\nreceive applause for virtues which they do not possess. The Searcher\nof hearts inspects motives, and often the deeds which are highly\napplauded by men are recorded by Him as springing from selfish\nmotives and base hypocrisy. Every act of our lives, whether excellent\nand praiseworthy or deserving of censure, is judged by the Searcher\nof hearts according to the motives which prompted it.\nEven some ministers who are advocating the law of God have but\nlittle knowledge of themselves. They do not meditate, and investigate\ntheir motives. They do not see their errors and sins, because they do\nnot, in sincerity and earnestness, take a view of their life, their acts,\nand their character, separate and as a whole, and compare them with\nthe sacred and holy law of God. The claims of God\u2019s law are not\nreally understood by them, and they are daily living in transgression\nof the spirit of that law which they profess to revere. \u201cBy the law,\u201d\nsays Paul, \u201cis the knowledge of sin.\u201d \u201cI had not known sin, but by\nthe law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou\nshalt not covet.\u201d Some who labor in word and doctrine have not a\npractical understanding of the law of God and its holy claims, or\nof the atonement of Christ. They themselves need to be converted\nbefore they can convert sinners.\nThe faithful mirror which would reveal the defects in the\ncharacter is neglected; therefore deformity and sin exist, and are [513]\napparent to others, if not understood by those who are in fault. The\nhateful sin of selfishness exists to a great degree, even in some who\n450 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nprofess to be devoted to the work of God. If they would compare\ntheir character with His requirements, especially with the great stan-\ndard, His holy, just, and good law, they would ascertain, if earnest,\nhonest searchers, that they are fearfully wanting. But some are not\nwilling to look far enough or deep enough to see the depravity of\ntheir own hearts. They are wanting in very many respects; yet they\nremain in willing ignorance of their guilt, and are so intent upon\ncaring for their own interests that God has no care for them.\nSome are not naturally devotional, and therefore should encour-\nage and cultivate a habit of close examination of their own lives and\nmotives, and should especially cherish a love for religious exercises\nand for secret prayer. They are often heard talking of doubts and\nunbelief, and dwelling upon the wonderful struggles they have had\nwith infidel feelings. They dwell upon discouraging influences as\nso affecting their faith, hope, and courage in the truth and in the\nultimate success of the work and cause in which they are engaged, as\nto make it a special virtue to be found on the side of the doubting. At\ntimes they seem to really enjoy hovering about the infidel\u2019s position\nand strengthening their unbelief with every circumstance they can\ngather as an excuse for their darkness. To such we would say: You\nwould better come down at once and leave the walls of Zion until\nyou become converted men and good Christians. Before you take\nthe responsibility of becoming ministers you are required of God\nto separate yourselves from the love of this world. The reward of\nthose who continue in this doubting position will be that given to\nthe fearful and unbelieving.\nBut what is the reason of these doubts, this darkness and\nunbelief? I answer: These men are not right with God. They are not[514]\ndealing honestly and truly with their own souls. They have neglected\nto cultivate personal piety. They have not separated themselves from\nall selfishness and from sin and sinners. They have failed to study\nthe self-denying, self-sacrificing life of our Lord and have failed\nto imitate His example of purity, devotion, and self-sacrifice. The\nsin which easily besets has been strengthened by indulgence. By\ntheir own negligence and sin they have separated themselves from\nthe company of the divine Teacher, and He is a day\u2019s journey in\nadvance of them. They have for their company, the indolent, slothful,\nbacksliding, unbelieving, irreverent, unthankful, unholy, and their\nAddress to Ministers 451\nattendants, the evil angels. What marvel that such are in darkness, or\nthat they have doubts of doctrine? \u201cIf any man will do His will, he\nshall know of the doctrine.\u201d He shall know of a certainty in regard to\nthis matter. This promise should put to flight all doubts and question-\nings. It is separation from Christ that brings doubts. He is followed\nby the earnest, honest, true, faithful, humble, meek, and pure, whom\nholy angels, clothed with the panoply of heaven, are sanctifying,\nenlightening, purifying, and guarding; for they are heaven bound.\nNo greater evidence need be asked that a person is at a great\ndistance from Jesus, and living in neglect of secret prayer, neglecting\npersonal piety, than the fact that he thus talks doubts and unbelief\nbecause his surroundings are not favorable. Such persons have not\nthe pure, true, undefiled religion of Christ. They have a spurious\narticle which the refining process will utterly consume as dross. As\nsoon as God proves them, and tests their faith, they waver, they stand\nfeebly, swaying first one way, then the other. They have not the\ngenuine article that Paul possessed, that could glory in tribulation\nbecause \u201ctribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience;\nand experience, hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; because the [515]\nlove of God is shed abroad in our hearts.\u201d They have a religion of\ncircumstance. If all around them are strong in faith and courage in\nthe ultimate success of the third angel\u2019s message, and no special\ninfluence is brought to bear against them, they then appear to have\nsome faith. But as soon as adversity seems to come upon the cause,\nand the work drags heavily, and the help of everyone is needed,\nthese poor souls, though they may be professed ministers of the\ngospel, expect everything to come to nought. These hinder instead\nof helping.\nIf apostasy arises, and rebellion is manifested, you do not hear\nthem say, in words of encouragement and lofty cheer: Brethren,\nfaint not; be of good courage. \u201cNevertheless the foundation of God\nstandeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are\nHis.\u201d Men who are thus affected by circumstances should remain\nat their homes and employ their physical and mental strength in a\nless responsible position where they will not be liable to meet such\nstrong opposition. If everything moves smoothly, they may pass for\nvery good, devotional men. But these are not the ones whom the\nMaster will send to do His work, for this is opposed by those who\n452 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nare emissaries of Satan. Satan also, and his host of evil angels, will\nbe arrayed against them. God has made provision for the men whom\nHe has called to do His work, that they may come off conquerors\nin every contest. Those who follow His directions will never meet\nwith defeat.\nThe Lord, speaking through Paul, Ephesians 6:10-18, tells us\nhow to fortify ourselves against Satan and his emissaries: \u201cFinally,\nmy brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might.\nPut on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against\nthe wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood,\nbut against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the\ndarkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.\nWherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be[516]\nable to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand\ntherefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the\nbreastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the preparation\nof the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith\nye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take\nthe helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the\nword of God: praying always with all prayer and supplication in the\nSpirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication\nfor all saints.\u201d\nWe are engaged in an exalted, sacred work. Those who profess\nto be called to teach the truth to those who sit in darkness should\nnot be bodies of unbelief and darkness themselves. They should live\nnear to God, where they can be all light in the Lord. The reason\nwhy they are not so is that they are not obeying the word of God\nthemselves; therefore doubts and discouragements are expressed,\nwhen only words of faith and holy cheer should be heard.\nIt is religion that ministers need; a daily conversion to God, an\nundivided, unselfish interest in His cause and work. There should be\nself-abasement, and a putting away of all jealousy, evil surmising,\nenvy, hatred, malice, and unbelief. An entire transformation is\nneeded. Some have lost sight of our pattern, the suffering Man of\nCalvary. In His service we need not expect ease, honor, and greatness\nin this life; for He, the Majesty of heaven, did not receive it. \u201cHe is\ndespised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with\ngrief.\u201d \u201cHe was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for\nAddress to Ministers 453\nour iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and\nwith His stripes we are healed.\u201d With this example before us, will\nwe choose to shun the cross, and to be swayed by circumstances?\nShall our zeal, our fervor, be kindled only when we are surrounded\nby those who are awake and zealous in the work and cause of God?\nCan we not stand in God, let our surroundings be ever so un- [517]\npleasant and discouraging? \u201cWhat shall we then say to these things?\nIf God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His own\nSon, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him\nalso freely give us all things? Who shall lay anything to the charge\nof God\u2019s elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth?\nIt is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at\nthe right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who\nshall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or dis-\ntress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?\nAs it is written, For Thy sake we are killed all the day long; we\nare accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things\nwe are more than conquerors through Him that loved us. For I am\npersuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,\nnor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor\ndepth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the\nlove of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d\nMany ministers have not an undivided interest in the work of\nGod. They have invested but little in His cause, and because they\nhave taken so little stock in the advancement of the truth they are\neasily tempted in regard to it and moved from it. They are not\nestablished, strengthened, settled. He who understands well his\nown character, who is acquainted with the sin which most easily\nbesets him, and the temptations that will be most likely to overcome\nhim, should not expose himself needlessly and invite temptation by\nplacing himself upon the enemy\u2019s ground. If duty calls him where\ncircumstances are not favorable, he will have special help from God,\nand thus go fully girded for a conflict with the enemy. Self-knowl-\nedge will save many from falling into grievous temptations, and\nprevent many an inglorious defeat. In order to become acquainted\nwith ourselves, it is essential that we faithfully investigate the mo-\ntives and principles of our conduct, comparing our actions with the [518]\n454 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nstandard of duty revealed in God\u2019s word. Ministers should encourage\nand cultivate benevolence.\nI was shown that some who have been engaged in our office\nof publication, in our Health Institute, and in the ministry have\nlabored simply for wages. There are exceptions; not all are guilty in\nthis respect, but few have seemed to realize that they must give an\naccount of their stewardship. Means that had been consecrated to\nGod to advance His cause has been squandered. Families in poverty,\nwho had experienced the sanctifying influences of the truth and who\ntherefore prized it and felt grateful to God for it, have thought that\nthey could and should deprive themselves of even the necessaries\nof life in order to bring in their offerings to the treasury of the Lord.\nSome have deprived themselves of articles of clothing which they\nreally needed to make them comfortable. Others have sold their\nonly cow and have dedicated to God the means thus received. In the\nsincerity of their souls, with many tears of gratitude because it was\ntheir privilege to do this for the cause of God, they have bowed before\nthe Lord with their offering and have invoked His blessing upon it\nas they sent it forth, praying that it might be the means of bringing\nthe knowledge of the truth to souls in darkness. The means thus\ndedicated has not always been appropriated as the self-sacrificing\ndonors designed. Covetous, selfish men, having no spirit of self-\ndenial or self-sacrifice themselves, have handled unfaithfully means\nthus brought into the treasury; and they have robbed the treasury of\nGod by receiving means which they had not justly earned. Their\nunconsecrated, reckless management has squandered and scattered\nmeans that had been consecrated to God with prayers and tears.\nI was shown that the recording angel makes a faithful record\nof every offering dedicated to God and put into the treasury, and\nalso of the final result of the means thus bestowed. The eye of God [519]\ntakes cognizance of every farthing devoted to His cause, and of the\nwillingness or reluctance of the giver. The motive in giving is also\nchronicled. Those self-sacrificing, consecrated ones who render\nback to God the things that are His, as He requires of them, will\nbe rewarded according to their works. Even though the means thus\nconsecrated be misapplied, so that it does not accomplish the object\nwhich the donor had in view,\u2014the glory of God and the salvation of\nAddress to Ministers 455\nsouls,\u2014those who made the sacrifice in sincerity of soul, with an\neye single to the glory of God, will not lose their reward.\nThose who have made a wrong use of means dedicated to God\nwill be required to give an account of their stewardship. Some have\nselfishly grasped means because of their love of gain. Others have\nnot a tender conscience; it has become seared through long-cher-\nished selfishness. They view sacred and eternal things from a low\nstandpoint. Through their long continuance in a wrong course their\nmoral sensibilities seem paralyzed. It seems impossible to elevate\ntheir views and feelings to the exalted standard clearly brought to\nview in the word of God. Unless there is a thorough transformation\nby the renewing of the mind, this class will find no place in heaven.\nThose who have pursued a course of selfishness and wrong, not\nregarding even the treasury of God as sacred, could not appreciate\nthe purity and holiness of the sanctified in the kingdom of heaven,\nor the value of the rich glory, the eternal reward, reserved for the\nfaithful overcomers. Their minds have so long run in a low, self-\nish channel that they cannot appreciate eternal things. They do not\nvalue salvation. It seems impossible to elevate their minds to rightly\nestimate the plan of salvation or the value of the atonement. Selfish\ninterests have engrossed the entire being; like a loadstone they hold\nthe mind and affections, binding them down to a low level. Some of\nthese persons will never attain to perfection of Christian character [520]\nbecause they do not see the value and necessity of such a character.\nTheir minds cannot be elevated so that they will be charmed with\nholiness. Self-love and selfish interests have so warped the character\nthat they cannot be made to distinguish the sacred and eternal from\nthe common. God\u2019s cause and His treasury are no more sacred to\nthem than common business or means devoted to worldly purposes.\nDuties in this direction are binding upon all who profess to be\nfollowers of Christ. God\u2019s law specifies their duty to their fellow\nmen: \u201cThou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d By a disregard\nof justice, mercy, and benevolence to their neighbor, some have\nso hardened the heart that they can go still further, and even rob\nGod without compunctions of conscience. Do such close their eyes\nand their understanding to the fact that God knows, that He reads\ntheir every action and the motive which impelled them to it? His\nreward is with Him, and His work before Him, to give to every man\n456 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\naccording as his work shall be. Every good and every wrong act,\nand its influence upon others, is traced out by the Searcher of hearts,\nto whom every secret is revealed. And the reward will be according\nto the motives which prompted the action.\nNotwithstanding the repeated warnings and reproofs which the\nLord has sent them, those who have occupied responsible positions\nhave followed their own ways and been guided by their own unsanc-\ntified judgment, and, in consequence, the cause of God has suffered,\nand souls have been turned from the truth. All who are thus guilty\nwill have a fearful record to meet in the day of final retribution. If\nthey are ever saved, it will be by no common effort on their part; their\npast life must be seen by them and redeemed. If this work be entered\nupon with sincerity, and followed with perseverance and untiring\nearnestness, it will be wholly successful; but many will not succeed[521]\nbecause the earnestness with which they commence the work dies\ndown to listlessness and carelessness. Their efforts are right at first,\nas they have some sense of their condition; but they seek to forget\nthe past, and pass over it without taking up the stumbling blocks\nand making thorough work. Their repentance is not genuine sorrow\nthat through their influence God has been dishonored and souls for\nwhom Christ died have been lost. They make spasmodic efforts and\nshow great feeling; but the fact that the efforts cease, that this feeling\nsoon passes off and is succeeded by listless indifference, evinces\nthat God was not fully in the work. The feelings were for a time\nwrought upon; but the work did not reach deep enough to change\nthe principles which governed their actions. They are as liable to be\nled again into the same wrong course as they were at first; for they\nhave not strength to withstand the wiles of Satan, but are subject to\nhis devices.\nThe life of a true Christian is ever onward. There is no stand-\ning still nor going back. It is your privilege to be \u201cfilled with the\nknowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;\nthat ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruit-\nful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;\nstrengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, unto\nall patience and long-suffering with joyfulness; giving thanks unto\nthe Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheri-\ntance of the saints in light.\u201d\nAddress to Ministers 457\nI entreat all, especially those who minister in word and doctrine,\nto make an unreserved surrender to God. Consecrate your lives to\nHim, and be indeed ensamples to the flock. Be no longer content\nto remain dwarfs in spiritual things. Let your aim be nothing short\nof perfection of Christian character. Let your lives be unselfish and [522]\nblameless, that they may ever be a living rebuke to those who are\nselfish and whose affections seem to be upon their earthly treasure.\nGod grant that you may be strengthened according to the riches of\nHis glory, \u201cwith might by His Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may\ndwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in\nlove, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth,\nand length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ,\nwhich passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fullness\nof God.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 62\u2014Exercise and Air\nIn the creation of man the Lord designed that he should be active\nand useful. Yet many live in this world as useless machines, as\nthough they hardly existed. They brighten the path of none, they are\na blessing to none. They live only to burden others. So far as their\ninfluence on the side of right is concerned, they are mere ciphers;\nbut they tell with weight upon the wrong side. Search the lives\nof such closely, and scarcely an act of disinterested benevolence\ncan be found. When they die, their memory dies with them. Their\nnames soon perish; for they cannot live, even in the affections of\ntheir friends, by means of true goodness and virtuous acts. With\nsuch persons life has been a mistake. They have not been faithful\nstewards. They have forgotten that their Creator has claims upon\nthem and that He designs them to be active in doing good and in\nblessing others with their influence. Selfish interests attract the mind\nand lead to forgetfulness of God and of the purpose of their Creator.\nAll who profess to be followers of Jesus should feel that a duty\nrests upon them to preserve their bodies in the best condition of[523]\nhealth, that their minds may be clear to comprehend heavenly things.\nThe mind needs to be controlled, for it has a most powerful influence\nupon the health. The imagination often misleads, and when indulged,\nbrings severe forms of disease upon the afflicted. Many die of\ndiseases which are mostly imaginary. I am acquainted with several\nwho have brought upon themselves actual disease by the influence\nof the imagination.\nOne sister was carried by her husband from chair to bed, and\nfrom room to room, because she thought that she was too feeble to\nwalk. But as the case was afterward presented to me, she could have\nwalked as well as myself if she had thought so. Had an accident\noccurred,\u2014had the house taken fire, or one of her children been in\nimminent danger of losing life by a fall,\u2014this woman would have\nbeen aroused by the force of circumstances, and would have walked\nquite readily and briskly. She could walk, so far as physical strength\n458\nExercise and Air 459\nwas concerned; but diseased imagination led her to conclude that\nshe could not, and she did not arouse the power of the will to resist\nthis deception. The imagination said: You cannot walk, and you had\nbetter not try. Sit still; your limbs are so weak that you cannot stand.\nHad this sister exerted her will power and aroused her benumbed\nand dormant energies, this deception would have been exposed. In\nconsequence of yielding to the imagination, she probably thinks, to\nthis day, that when she was so helpless she was so of necessity; but\nthis was purely a freak of the imagination, which sometimes plays\nstrange tricks upon diseased mortals.\nSome are so afraid of air that they will muffle up their heads\nand bodies until they look like mummies. They sit in the house,\ngenerally inactive, fearing they shall weary themselves and get sick\nif they exercise either indoors or out in the open air. They could\ntake habitual exercise in the open air every pleasant day, if they only [524]\nthought so. Continued inactivity is one of the greatest causes of\ndebility of body and feebleness of mind. Many are sick who ought\nto be in very good health and thus in possession of one of the richest\nblessings they could enjoy.\nI have been shown that many who are apparently feeble, and are\never complaining, are not so badly off as they imagine themselves to\nbe. Some of these have a powerful will, which, exercised in the right\ndirection, would be a potent means of controlling the imagination\nand thus resisting disease. But it is too frequently the case that the\nwill is exercised in a wrong direction and stubbornly refuses to yield\nto reason. That will has settled the matter; invalids they are, and the\nattention due to invalids they will have, irrespective of the judgment\nof others.\nI have been shown mothers who are governed by a diseased\nimagination, the influence of which is felt upon husband and chil-\ndren. The windows must be kept closed because the mother feels\nthe air. If she is at all chilly, and a change is made in her clothing,\nshe thinks her children must be treated in the same manner, and thus\nthe entire family are robbed of physical stamina. All are affected\nby one mind, physically and mentally injured through the diseased\nimagination of one woman, who considers herself a criterion for the\nwhole family. The body is clothed in accordance with the caprices of\na diseased imagination and smothered under an amount of wrappings\n460 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwhich debilitates the system. The skin cannot perform its office; the\nstudied habit of shunning the air and avoiding exercise, closes the\npores,\u2014the little mouths through which the body breathes,\u2014mak-\ning it impossible to throw off impurities through that channel. The\nburden of labor is thrown upon the liver, lungs, kidneys, etc., and\nthese internal organs are compelled to do the work of the skin. Thus\npersons bring disease upon themselves by their wrong habits; yet, in\nthe face of light and knowledge, they will adhere to their own course.[525]\nThey reason thus: \u201cHave we not tried the matter? and do we not\nunderstand it by experience?\u201d But the experience of a person whose\nimagination is at fault should not have much weight with anyone.\nThe season most to be dreaded by one going among these invalids\nis winter. It is winter indeed, not only outdoors, but in, to those who\nare compelled to live in the same house and sleep in the same room.\nThese victims of a diseased imagination shut themselves indoors\nand close the windows, for the air affects their lungs and their heads.\nImagination is active; they expect to take cold, and they will have\nit. No amount of reasoning can make them believe that they do\nnot understand the philosophy of the whole matter. Have they not\nproved it? they will argue. It is true that they have proved one side\nof the question,\u2014by persisting in their own course,\u2014and yet they\ndo take cold if in the least exposed. Tender as babies, they cannot\nendure anything; yet they live on, and continue to close the windows\nand doors, and hover over the stove, and enjoy their misery. They\nhave surely proved that their course has not made them well, but\nhas increased their difficulties. Why will not such allow reason to\ninfluence the judgment and control the imagination? Why not now\ntry an opposite course, and in a judicious manner obtain exercise\nand air out of doors, instead of remaining in the house from day to\nday, more like a bundle of drygoods than an active being?\nThe chief if not the only reason why many become invalids is\nthat the blood does not circulate freely, and the changes in the vital\nfluid, which are necessary to life and health, do not take place. They\nhave not given their bodies exercise nor their lungs food, which\nis pure, fresh air; therefore it is impossible for the blood to be\nvitalized, and it pursues its course sluggishly through the system.\nThe more we exercise, the better will be the circulation of the blood.\nMore people die for want of exercise than through overfatigue; very[526]\nExercise and Air 461\nmany more rust out than wear out. Those who accustom themselves\nto proper exercise in the open air will generally have a good and\nvigorous circulation. We are more dependent upon the air we breathe\nthan upon the food we eat. Men and women, young and old, who\ndesire health, and who would enjoy active life, should remember\nthat they cannot have these without a good circulation. Whatever\ntheir business and inclinations, they should make up their minds to\nexercise in the open air as much as they can. They should feel it a\nreligious duty to overcome the conditions of health which have kept\nthem confined indoors, deprived of exercise in the open air.\nSome invalids become willful in the matter and refuse to be\nconvinced of the great importance of daily outdoor exercise, whereby\nthey may obtain a supply of pure air. For fear of taking cold, they\npersist, from year to year, in having their own way and living in an\natmosphere almost destitute of vitality. It is impossible for this class\nto have a healthy circulation. The entire system suffers for want\nof exercise and pure air. The skin becomes debilitated and more\nsensitive to any change in the atmosphere. Additional clothing is put\non, and the heat of the room increased. The next day they require a\nlittle more heat and a little more clothing in order to feel perfectly\nwarm, and thus they humor every changing feeling until they have\nbut little vitality to endure any cold. Some may inquire: \u201cWhat shall\nwe do? Would you have us remain cold?\u201d If you add clothing, let it\nbe but little, and exercise, if possible, to regain the heat you need.\nIf you positively cannot engage in active exercise, warm yourselves\nby the fire; but as soon as you are warm, lay off your extra clothing\nand remove from the fire. If those who can, would engage in some\nactive employment to take the mind from themselves, they would\ngenerally forget that they were chilly and would not receive harm.\nYou should lower the temperature of your room as soon as you have [527]\nregained your natural warmth. For invalids who have feeble lungs,\nnothing can be worse than an overheated atmosphere.\nInvalids too often deprive themselves of sunlight. This is one of\nnature\u2019s most healing agents. It is a very simple, therefore not a fash-\nionable remedy, to enjoy the rays of God\u2019s sunlight and beautify our\nhomes with its presence. Fashion takes the greatest care to exclude\nthe light of the sun from parlors and sleeping rooms by dropping\ncurtains and closing shutters, as though its rays were ruinous to life\n462 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nand health. It is not God who has brought upon us the many woes\nto which mortals are heirs. Our own folly has led us to deprive\nourselves of things that are precious, of blessings which God has\nprovided and which, if properly used, are of inestimable value for\nthe recovery of health. If you would have your homes sweet and\ninviting, make them bright with air and sunshine. Remove your\nheavy curtains, open the windows, throw back the blinds, and enjoy\nthe rich sunlight, even if it be at the expense of the colors of your\ncarpets. The precious sunlight may fade your carpets, but it will\ngive a healthful color to the cheeks of your children. If you have\nGod\u2019s presence and possess earnest, loving hearts, a humble home\nmade bright with air and sunlight, and cheerful with the welcome of\nunselfish hospitality, will be to your family, and to the weary traveler,\na heaven below.\nMany have been taught from childhood that night air is posi-\ntively injurious to health and therefore must be excluded from their\nrooms. To their own injury they close the windows and doors of their\nsleeping apartments to protect themselves from the night air which\nthey say is so dangerous to health. In this they are deceived. In the\ncool of the evening it may be necessary to guard from chilliness by\nextra clothing, but they should give their lungs air.\nOn an autumn evening we were once traveling in a crowded car,\nwhere the atmosphere was rendered very impure by the mingling[528]\nof so many breaths. The exhalations from lungs and bodies caused\na most sickening sensation to come over me. I raised my window\nand was enjoying the fresh air, when a lady, in earnest, imploring\ntones, cried out: \u201cDo put down that window. You will take cold and\nbe sick, for the night air is so unhealthy.\u201d I replied: \u201cMadam, we\nhave no other air, in this car or out of it, but night air. If you refuse\nto breathe night air, then you must stop breathing. God has provided\nfor His creatures air to breathe for the day, and the same, made a\nlittle cooler, for the night. In the night it is not possible for you to\nbreathe anything but night air. The question is: Shall the night air\nwe breathe be pure, or is it improved after it has been breathed over\nand over? Is it for our health to breathe the polluted night air of this\ncar? The exhalations thrown off by the lungs and bodies of men\nsteeped in tobacco and alcohol, pollute the air and endanger health;\nand yet nearly all the passengers sit as indifferent as though inhaling\nExercise and Air 463\nthe purest atmosphere. God has wisely provided for us, that in the\nnight we should breathe night air, and in the day, the air of the day.\nIf we fail to answer the plan of God, and the blood becomes impure,\nour wrong habits have made it thus. But the air of night, breathed in\nthe night, will not of itself poison the current of human life.\u201d Many\nare suffering from disease because they refuse to receive into their\nrooms at night the pure night air. The free, pure air of heaven is one\nof the richest blessings we can enjoy.\nAnother precious blessing is proper exercise. There are many\nindolent, inactive ones who are disinclined to physical labor or\nexercise because it wearies them. What if it does weary them? The\nreason why they become weary is that they do not strengthen their\nmuscles by exercise, therefore they feel the least exertion. Invalid\nwomen and girls are better pleased to busy themselves with light\nemployment, as crocheting, or embroidering, or making tatting, [529]\nthan to engage in physical labor. If invalids would recover health,\nthey should not discontinue physical exercise; for they will thus\nincrease muscular weakness and general debility. Bind up the arm\nand permit it to remain useless, even for a few weeks, then free it\nfrom its bondage, and you will discover that it is weaker than the one\nyou have been using moderately during the same time. Inactivity\nproduces the same effect upon the whole muscular system. The\nblood is not enabled to expel the impurities as it would if active\ncirculation were induced by exercise.\nWhen the weather will permit, all who can possibly do so ought\nto walk in the open air every day, summer and winter. But the\nclothing should be suitable for the exercise, and the feet should be\nwell protected. A walk, even in winter, would be more beneficial\nto the health than all the medicine the doctors may prescribe. For\nthose who can walk, walking is preferable to riding. The muscles\nand veins are enabled better to perform their work. There will be\nincreased vitality, which is so necessary to health. The lungs will\nhave needful action, for it is impossible to go out in the bracing air\nof a winter\u2019s morning without inflating the lungs.\nRiches and idleness are thought by some to be blessings indeed.\nBut when some persons have acquired wealth, or inherited it un-\nexpectedly, their active habits have been broken up, their time is\nunemployed, they live at ease, and their usefulness seems at an end;\n464 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthey become restless, anxious, and unhappy, and their lives soon\nclose. Those who are always busy, and go cheerfully about the per-\nformance of their daily tasks, are the most happy and healthy. The\nrest and composure of night brings to their wearied frames unbroken\nslumber. The Lord knew what was for man\u2019s happiness when He\ngave him work to do. The sentence that man must toil for his bread,\nand the promise of future happiness and glory, came from the same[530]\nthrone. Both are blessings. Women of fashion are worthless for\nall the good ends of human life. They possess but little force of\ncharacter, have but little moral will or physical energy. Their highest\naim is to be admired. They die prematurely and are not missed, for\nthey have blessed no one.\nExercise will aid the work of digestion. To walk out after a meal,\nhold the head erect, put back the shoulders, and exercise moderately,\nwill be a great benefit. The mind will be diverted from self to the\nbeauties of nature. The less the attention is called to the stomach\nafter a meal, the better. If you are in constant fear that your food will\nhurt you, it most assuredly will. Forget self, and think of something\ncheerful.\nMany labor under the mistaken idea that if they have taken cold,\nthey must carefully exclude the outside air and increase the temper-\nature of their room until it is excessively hot. The system may be\nderanged, the pores closed by waste matter, and the internal organs\nsuffering more or less inflammation, because the blood has been\nchilled back from the surface and thrown upon them. At this time,\nof all others, the lungs should not be deprived of pure, fresh air. If\npure air is ever necessary, it is when any part of the system, as the\nlungs or stomach, is diseased. Judicious exercise would induce the\nblood to the surface, and thus relieve the internal organs. Brisk, yet\nnot violent exercise in the open air, with cheerfulness of spirits, will\npromote the circulation, giving a healthful glow to the skin, and\nsending the blood, vitalized by the pure air, to the extremities. The\ndiseased stomach will find relief by exercise. Physicians frequently\nadvise invalids to visit foreign countries, to go to the springs, or to\nride upon the ocean, in order to regain health; when, in nine cases\nout of ten, if they would eat temperately and engage in healthful\nexercise with a cheerful spirit, they would regain health and save\ntime and money. Exercise, and a free and abundant use of the air[531]\nExercise and Air 465\nand sunlight,\u2014blessings which Heaven has freely bestowed upon\nall,\u2014would give life and strength to the emaciated invalid.\nA large class of women are content to hover over the stove,\nbreathing impure air for one half or three fourths of the time, until\nthe brain is heated and half benumbed. They should go out and\nexercise every day, even though some things indoors have to be\nneglected. They need the cool air to quiet their distracted brains.\nThey need not go to their neighbors to gossip, but should make\nit their object to do some good, working to the end of benefiting\nothers. Then they will be an example to others and receive real\nbenefit themselves.\nPerfect health depends upon perfect circulation. Special attention\nshould be given to the extremities, that they may be as thoroughly\nclothed as the chest and the region over the heart, where is the\ngreatest amount of heat. Parents who dress their children with the\nextremities naked, or nearly so, are sacrificing the health and lives\nof their children to fashion. If these parts are not so warm as the\nbody, the circulation is not equalized. When the extremities, which\nare remote from the vital organs, are not properly clad, the blood\nis driven to the head, causing headache or nosebleed; or there is a\nsense of fullness about the chest, producing cough or palpitation\nof the heart, on account of too much blood in that locality; or the\nstomach has too much blood, causing indigestion.\nIn order to follow the fashions, mothers dress their children\nwith limbs nearly naked; and the blood is chilled back from its\nnatural course and thrown upon the internal organs, breaking up the\ncirculation and producing disease. The limbs were not formed by\nour Creator to endure exposure, as was the face. The Lord provided\nthe face with an immense circulation, because it must be exposed.\nHe provided, also, large veins and nerves for the limbs and feet,\nto contain a large amount of the current of human life, that the [532]\nlimbs might be uniformly as warm as the body. They should be so\nthoroughly clothed as to induce the blood to the extremities. Satan\ninvented the fashions which leave the limbs exposed, chilling back\nthe life current from its original course. And parents bow at the\nshrine of fashion and so clothe their children that the nerves and\nveins become contracted and do not answer the purpose that God\ndesigned they should. The result is, habitually cold feet and hands.\n466 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nThose parents who follow fashion instead of reason will have an\naccount to render to God for thus robbing their children of health.\nEven life itself is frequently sacrificed to the God of fashion.\nChildren who are clothed according to fashion cannot endure\nexposure in the open air unless the weather is mild. Therefore parents\nand children remain in ill-ventilated rooms, fearing the atmosphere\nout of doors; and well they may, with their fashionable style of\nclothing. If they would clothe themselves sensibly, and have moral\ncourage to take their position on the side of right, they would not\nendanger health by going out summer and winter, and exercising\nfreely in the open air. But if left undisturbed to their own course,\nmany would soon complete the sacrifice of their own lives and\nthose of their children. And those who are compelled to have the\ncare of them become sufferers. The invalid who is controlled by\nimagination is to be dreaded. All who live in the house with her\nbecome enfeebled. The husband loses his nervous energy, and\nbecomes diseased because, a considerable part of the time, he is\nrobbed by his wife of the vital air of heaven. But the poor children,\nwho think that mother knows best what is right, are the greatest\nsufferers. The mother\u2019s wrong course has enfeebled herself, and, if\nchilly, she bundles up in more wrappings, and provides the same for\nthe children, thinking that they also must be chilly. The doors and[533]\nwindows are closed, and the temperature of the room increased. The\nchildren are frequently puny and weakly, and do not possess a high\ndegree of moral worth. Husband and children are thus shut up for the\nwinter, slaves to the notions of a woman controlled by imagination,\nand sometimes having a set will. The members of such a family\nare daily martyrs. They are sacrificing health to the caprice of an\nimaginative, complaining, murmuring woman. They are deprived,\nin a great measure, of air, which will invigorate them and give them\nenergy and vitality.\nThose who do not use their limbs every day will realize a weak-\nness when they do attempt to exercise. The veins and muscles are\nnot in a condition to perform their work and keep all the living ma-\nchinery in healthful action, each organ in the system doing its part.\nThe limbs will strengthen with use. Moderate exercise every day\nwill impart strength to the muscles, which without exercise become\nflabby and enfeebled. By active exercise in the open air every day,\nExercise and Air 467\nthe liver, kidneys, and lungs also will be strengthened to perform\ntheir work. Bring to your aid the power of the will, which will resist\ncold and will give energy to the nervous system. In a short time you\nwill so realize the benefit of exercise and pure air that you would\nnot live without these blessings. Your lungs, deprived of air, will be\nlike a hungry person deprived of food. Indeed, we can live longer\nwithout food than without air, which is the food that God has pro-\nvided for the lungs. Therefore do not regard it as an enemy, but as a\nprecious blessing from God.\nIf invalids allow themselves to encourage a diseased imagina-\ntion, they will not only waste their own energies, but the vitality of\nthose who have the care of them. I advise invalid sisters who have\naccustomed themselves to a great amount of clothing, to lay it off\ngradually. Some of you live merely to eat and breathe, and fail to [534]\nanswer the purpose for which you were created. You should have\nan exalted aim in life and seek to be useful and efficient in your\nown families and to become useful members of society. You should\nnot require the attention of the family to be centered upon you, nor\nshould you draw largely upon the sympathies of others. Do your\npart in giving love and sympathy to the unfortunate, remembering\nthat they have woes and trials peculiar to themselves. See if you\ncannot, by words of sympathy and love, lighten their burdens. In\nblessing others, you will realize a blessing yourselves.\nThose who, so far as it is possible, engage in the work of doing\ngood to others by giving practical demonstration of their interest in\nthem are not only relieving the ills of human life in helping them\nbear their burdens, but are at the same time contributing largely\nto their own health of soul and body. Doing good is a work that\nbenefits both giver and receiver. If you forget self in your interest\nfor others, you gain a victory over your infirmities. The satisfaction\nyou will realize in doing good will aid you greatly in the recovery\nof the healthy tone of the imagination. The pleasure of doing good\nanimates the mind and vibrates through the whole body. While\nthe faces of benevolent men are lighted up with cheerfulness, and\ntheir countenances express the moral elevation of the mind, those\nof selfish, stingy men are dejected, cast down, and gloomy. Their\nmoral defects are seen in their countenances. Selfishness and self-\nlove stamp their own image upon the outward man. That person\n468 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwho is actuated by true disinterested benevolence is a partaker of\nthe divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world\nthrough lust; while the selfish and avaricious have cherished their\nselfishness until it has withered their social sympathies, and their\ncountenances reflect the image of the fallen foe, rather than that of\npurity and holiness.\nInvalids, I advise you to venture something. Arouse your will[535]\npower, and at least make a trial of this matter. Withdraw your\nthoughts and affections from yourselves. Walk out by faith. Are\nyou inclined to center your thoughts upon yourselves, fearing to\nexercise, and fearing that if you expose yourself to the air you will\nlose your life; resist these thoughts and feelings. Do not yield to\nyour diseased imagination. If you fail in the trial, you can but die.\nAnd what if you do die? One life might better be lost than many\nsacrificed. The whims and notions which you cherish are not only\ndestroying your own life, but injuring those whose lives are more\nvaluable than yours. But the course we recommend will not deprive\nyou of life or injure you. You will derive benefit from it. You need\nnot be rash or reckless; commence moderately at first to have more\nair and exercise, and continue your reform until you become useful,\na blessing to your families and to all around you. Let your judgment\nbe convinced that exercise, sunlight, and air are the blessings which\nHeaven has provided to make the sick well and to keep in health\nthose who are not sick. God does not deprive you of these free,\nHeaven-bestowed blessings, but you have punished yourselves by\nclosing your doors against them. Properly used, these simple yet\npowerful agents will assist nature to overcome real difficulties, if\nsuch exist, and will give healthy tone to the mind and vigor to the\nbody.\nIn this age of the world, when vice and fashion control men and\nwomen, Christians should possess virtuous characters and a large\nshare of good common sense. If this were the case, countenances\nwhich are now clouded, bearing the marks of disease and depravity,\nwould be hopeful and cheerful, lighted up by true goodness and a\nclear conscience.\nThe do-nothing system is the greatest curse that has befallen our\nrace. Children so unfortunate as to be brought up and educated by\nmothers who do not possess true moral worth, but who have diseased\nExercise and Air 469\nimaginations and suffer imaginary ailments, need the sympathy,\npatient instruction, and tender care of all who can help them. The [536]\nwants of these children are not met, and their education is such as\nto unfit them for useful members of society while they live, and to\nbring them to an untimely grave. If their lives are protracted, they\nwill never forget the lessons taught them by the mother. The errors\nof her life have been impressed upon them by her words and her\nactions, and in many cases they will follow in her footsteps. Her\nmantle falls like a dark pall upon her poor children. Her inconsistent\ncourse has given the stamp of her character to their lives, and they\ncannot readily overcome the education of their childhood.\nThe tenderest earthly tie is that between the mother and her child.\nThe child is more readily impressed by the life and example of the\nmother than by that of the father; for a stronger and more tender\nbond of union unites them. Mothers have a heavy responsibility. If\nI could impress upon them the work which they can do in molding\nthe minds of their children I should be happy.\nIf parents themselves would obtain knowledge, and feel the im-\nportance of putting it to a practical use in the education of their dear\nchildren, we should see a different order of things among youth and\nchildren. The children need to be instructed in regard to their own\nbodies. There are but few youth who have any definite knowledge\nof the mysteries of human life. They know but little about the liv-\ning machinery. Says David: \u201cI will praise Thee; for I am fearfully\nand wonderfully made.\u201d Teach your children to study from cause\nto effect; show them that if they violate the laws of their being they\nmust pay the penalty by suffering disease. If in your effort you can\nsee no special improvement, be not discouraged; patiently instruct,\nline upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little.\nIf by this means you have succeeded in forgetting yourself, you\nhave taken one step in the right direction. Press on until the victory\nis gained. Continue to teach your children in regard to their own [537]\nbodies and how to take care of them. Recklessness in regard to\nbodily health tends to recklessness in moral character.\nDo not neglect to teach your children how to cook. In so do-\ning, you impart to them principles which they must have in their\nreligious education. In giving your children lessons in physiology,\nand teaching them how to cook with simplicity and yet with skill,\n470 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nyou are laying the foundation for the most useful branches of educa-\ntion. Skill is required to make good light bread. There is religion in\ngood cooking, and I question the religion of that class who are too\nignorant and too careless to learn to cook.\nWe see sallow complexions and groaning dyspeptics wherever\nwe go. When we sit at the tables, and eat the food cooked in the same\nmanner as it has been for months, and perhaps years, I wonder that\nthese persons are alive. Bread and biscuit are yellow with saleratus.\nThis resort to saleratus was to save a little care; in consequence\nof forgetfulness, the bread is often allowed to become sour before\nbaking, and to remedy the evil a large portion of saleratus is added,\nwhich only makes it totally unfit for the human stomach. Saleratus\nin any form should not be introduced into the stomach, for the effect\nis fearful. It eats the coatings of the stomach, causes inflammation,\nand frequently poisons the entire system. Some plead: \u201cI cannot\nmake good bread or gems unless I use soda, or saleratus.\u201d You surely\ncan if you become a scholar, and will learn. Is not the health of your\nfamily of sufficient value to inspire you with ambition to learn how\nto cook and how to eat?\nThat which we eat cannot be converted into good blood unless it\nis of a proper quality, simple and nutritious. The stomach can never\nconvert sour bread into sweet. Food poorly prepared is not nutritious\nand cannot make good blood. These things which fret and derange\nthe stomach will have a benumbing influence upon the finer feelings[538]\nof the heart. Many who adopt the health reform complain that it does\nnot agree with them; but, after sitting at their tables, I come to the\ndecision that it is not the health reform that is at fault, but the poorly\nprepared food. Health reformers, above all others, should be careful\nto shun extremes. The body must have sufficient nourishment. We\ncannot subsist upon air merely; neither can we retain health unless\nwe have nourishing food. Food should be prepared in good order so\nthat it is palatable. Mothers should be practical physiologists, that\nthey may teach their children to know themselves and to possess\nmoral courage to carry out correct principles in defiance of the\nhealth-and-life-destroying fashions. To needlessly transgress the\nlaws of our being is a violation of the law of God.\nPoor cookery is slowly wearing away the life energies of thou-\nsands. It is dangerous to health and life to eat at some tables the\nExercise and Air 471\nheavy, sour bread and the other food prepared in keeping with it.\nMothers, instead of seeking to give your daughters a musical educa-\ntion, instruct them in these useful branches which have the closest\nconnection with life and health. Teach them all the mysteries of\ncooking. Show them that this is a part of their education and es-\nsential for them in order to become Christians. Unless the food is\nprepared in a wholesome, palatable manner, it cannot be converted\ninto good blood to build up the wasting tissues. Your daughters may\nlove music, and this may be all right; it may add to the happiness\nof the family; but the knowledge of music without the knowledge\nof cookery is not worth much. When your daughters have families\nof their own, an understanding of music and fancy work will not\nprovide for the table a well-cooked dinner, prepared with nicety,\nso that they will not blush to place it before their most-esteemed\nfriends. Mothers, yours is a sacred work. May God help you to\ntake it up with His glory in view and work earnestly, patiently, and [539]\nlovingly for the present and future good of your children, having an\neye single to the glory of God.\n* * * * *\nChapter 63\u2014Selfishness Rebuked\nDear Brother A,\nSince the Illinois camp meeting, your case has pressed with\nweight upon my mind. As I recall some things shown me in regard\nto ministers, especially yourself, I am exceedingly distressed. At\nthe meeting in Illinois I spoke especially upon the qualifications\nof a gospel minister. When I presented before the people the qual-\nifications of a minister bearing the solemn message for these last\ndays, much that I said applied to you, and I expected to hear some\nacknowledgment from you. Previous to my speaking, your wife\ntalked with Sister Hall in regard to your discouragements. She said\nyou did not know as it was your duty to preach; you had been un-\nsettled in regard to your duty, and were discouraged, and did not\nenter into the work as you would if you felt settled. Sister Hall\nintimated to me that if I had a word of encouragement for you, your\nwife would be glad to have me say it. I told Sister Hall that I had not\na word of encouragement to speak, and that if you were unsettled\nyou would better wait until you knew your duty for yourself. I then\nspoke upon the qualifications of a minister of Christ; and, if I had\nfully performed my duty, I should have spoken definitely to you\nwhile in the stand. The presence of unbelievers was the only reason\nwhich deterred me.\nIn Minnesota I was again burdened in regard to the course of our\nministers, by seeing Brother B and talking with him in regard to his\ndefects which stood right in the way of his work for the salvation of\nsouls. His course in caring for the things of this life again brought[540]\nyour case so distinctly before me that, had I been as well as usual,\nI should have written to you before I left the campground. We had\nno period of rest, but came directly to Wisconsin. I was sick, yet\nGod strengthened me to do my duty before the people. As I stood\nbefore the public I recognized countenances that I had no knowledge\nof ever having seen before. Again your case, in connection with\nothers, came distinctly before me. This was the vicinity where your\n472\nSelfishness Rebuked 473\ninfluence had been a blighting curse rather than a blessing. It was\nalso a place where much good might have been accomplished, even\nby you. Had you been consecrated to God, and unselfishly working\nfor the salvation of souls for whom Christ died, your labors would\nhave been wholly successful. You understood the arguments of our\nposition. The reasons of our faith, brought before the minds of those\nwho have not been enlightened in regard to them, make a decided\nimpression if minds are not filled with prejudice so that they will not\nreceive the evidences given. I saw some of the very best material to\nmake excellent Sabbathkeeping Christians in the vicinity of ----- and\n-----; but while some were charmed with the beautiful chain of truth,\nand were about ready to decide upon it, you left the field without\ncompleting the work you had undertaken. This was worse than if\nyou had never entered it. That interest can never be raised again.\nFor years light has been given upon this point, showing the\nnecessity of following up an interest that has been raised, and in\nno case leaving it until all have decided that lean toward the truth\nand have experienced the conversion necessary for baptism and\nunited with some church or formed one themselves. There are no\ncircumstances of sufficient importance to call a minister from an\ninterest created by the presentation of truth. Even sickness and death\nare of less consequence than the salvation of souls for whom Christ\nmade so immense a sacrifice. Those who feel the importance of the [541]\ntruth, and the value of souls for whom Christ died, will not leave an\ninterest among the people for any consideration. They will say: Let\nthe dead bury their dead. Home interests, lands and houses, should\nnot have the least power to attract from the field of labor. If ministers\nallow these temporal things to divert them from the work, the only\ncourse for them to pursue is to leave all, possess no lands or temporal\ninterests which will have an influence to draw them from the solemn\nwork of these last days. One soul is of more value than the entire\nworld. How can men who profess to have given themselves to the\nsacred work of saving souls, allow their small temporal possessions\nto engross their minds and hearts, and keep them from the high\ncalling they profess to have received from God?\nI saw, Brother A, that your influence in the vicinity of -----\nand ----- has done great injury to the cause of God. I knew what\nthat influence was while you were at Battle Creek last. As I have\n474 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nbeen writing out important matter for ministers, your case has been\nbrought before me, and I intended ere this to have written you; but\nit was impossible. For three nights I have slept but little. Your case\nhas been upon my mind almost constantly. I was mentally writing\nto you in my sleep, and also when awake. When I recognized\nin the congregation the very individuals that had been injured by\nyour influence, I should have brought the matter out, had you been\npresent. Not one word from any mortal was intimated to me in regard\nto your course. I felt compelled to speak to one or two in reference\nto the matter, stating to them that I recollected their countenances\nin connection with some things shown me in regard to you. Then,\nvery reluctantly, facts were related to me confirming all I had stated\nto them. I have said only what I believed I should say in the fear of\nGod, discharging my duty as His servant.\nTwo years ago I saw that you and your wife were both very[542]\nselfish, grasping persons. Your own selfish interests were dearer to\nyou than souls for whom Christ died. I was shown that you were not\ngenerally successful in your labors. You have the ability to present\nthe truth; you have an investigating mind; and if it were not for\nthe many defects in your Christian character, you could accomplish\ngood. But, for many reasons, you have not made the preaching of\nthe truth a success. One of the greatest curses of your life, Brother\nA, has been your supreme selfishness. You have been figuring for\nyour own advantage. You both have made yourselves the center of\nsympathy and attention. When you go to a place and enter a family,\nyou throw your whole weight upon them, let them cook for you and\nwait upon you; and neither of you seeks to do as much work as you\nmake. The family may be toiling hard, bearing their own burdens\nand yours; but you are both so selfish that you cannot see that they\nare worn and that you are both physically better able than they to\nperform the labor which they do for you. Brother A, you are too\nindolent to please God. When wood or water is needed, you do\nnot know it, and you let these be brought by those who are already\noverworked, and frequently by females, when these little errands,\nthese courtesies of life, are what you need to perform for the benefit\nof your health. You are full of flesh and blood, and do not exercise\nhalf enough for your own good. The indolence you manifest, and the\nSelfishness Rebuked 475\ndisposition to grasp everything whereby you may be advantaged, has\nbeen a reproach to the truth and a stumbling block to unbelievers.\nYour wife, as well as you, loves her ease. Your time has been\nspent in bed when you were able to be up actively showing a special\ninterest in the family you were burdening. You have thought that,\nbecause you were a minister, they should consider your presence\na favor, and should wait upon you, and favor you, while you had\nnothing to do but to care for your own selfish interests. The im- [543]\npressions which you have given have been very bad. You both have\nbeen considered representatives of ministers and their wives who are\nengaged in presenting to the world the Sabbath and the soon coming\nof our Lord.\nThose who are acquainted with your course will say that your\nprofession, your teachings, and your life do not agree. They see\nthat your fruits are not good, and decide that you do not believe\nthe things you teach to others. They conclude that all ministers\nare like yourself, and that sacred and eternal truths are, after all, a\ndeception. Who will be responsible for such impressions and such\ndeplorable results? May you see the heavy weight that rests upon\nyou in consequence of your selfishness, which is a curse to yourself\nand to all around you.\nAgain, Brother A, you are troubled with feelings and impres-\nsions which are the natural fruit of selfishness. You imagine that\nothers do not appreciate your labors. You think yourself capable of\naccomplishing a large work, but excuse your failure to do it, because\nothers do not give you room and credit according to your ability.\nYou are jealous of others and have hindered the progress of the cause\nin Illinois and Wisconsin, doing but little yourself, and hindering\nthose who would work if you were out of their way. Your sensitive-\nness and jealousy have weakened the hands of those who would set\nthings in order and bring up these conferences. If any improvement\nis seen in these states, you incline to think that it is attributable in a\ngreat measure to yourself, when it is a fact that if things were left\nto your dictation, they would speedily go into the ground. In your\npreaching you are generally too dry and formal. You do not weave\nin the practical with the doctrinal. You talk too long and weary the\npeople. Instead of dwelling only upon that portion of your subject\nthat you can fully make plain to the understanding of all, you go\n476 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nway around and come down to minute particulars that do not help[544]\nthe subject and might as well be passed over. When so much matter\nnot really necessary is brought in, the hearer loses the chain of the\nargument and cannot keep the subject in mind. When a minister gets\nthe ears of the people, he should go from point to point, as far as\npossible leaving these points unincumbered with a mass of words\nand petty details. He should leave his ideas before the people as\ndistinct as mileposts. To cover over the important, vital points with\nan array of words, dragging in everything which has some distant\nrelationship to the subject, destroys the force of it and obscures the\nbeautiful, connected chain of truth. You are slow and tedious in your\npreaching, as well as in everything else you undertake. You need,\nif ever a man did, to be energized by the Spirit of truth. You need\nChrist formed within you the hope of glory. You need religion, the\ngenuine article.\nI was referred to the following words of inspiration: \u201cWho is a\nwise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out\nof a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.\u201d \u201cBut\nthe wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle,\nand easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without\npartiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness\nis sown in peace of them that make peace.\u201d Men whom God has\ncalled to the work of saving souls will feel a burden for the people.\nSelfish interests will be swallowed up in their deep concern for the\nsalvation of souls for whom Christ died. They will feel the force of\nthe exhortation of Peter: \u201cThe elders which are among you I exhort,\nwho am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and\nalso a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: Feed the flock\nof God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by\nconstraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;\nneither as being lords over God\u2019s heritage, but being ensamples\nto the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall[545]\nreceive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.\u201d\nYou are naturally stubborn. Jealousy and stubbornness are the\nnatural fruits of selfishness. You have made some improvement;\nbut I saw so much yet to be done, I saw so clearly the wretched\ninfluence of your selfish, unconsecrated life, that I fear you will\nnever see just how hateful these traits of character are before God.\nSelfishness Rebuked 477\nI fear that you will not realize this sufficiently to put them away\nand become like your self-denying Redeemer, pure and unselfish,\nyour life characterized by disinterested benevolence. Your influence\nand example are such as to cause some who love the truth and\nwork of God, and who value our faith, to lose their spirit of self-\nsacrifice and their interest in the cause of present truth. Your selfish,\ncovetous course begets the same spirit in them; and your disposition\nto grasp and advantage yourself, while professing to be a minister of\nrighteousness, has closed the hearts of very many against giving of\ntheir means to advance the cause of truth. If ministers set the people\nan example of selfishness, that example will tell upon the cause of\nGod with tenfold greater power than all their preaching can.\nGod has been dishonored by your littleness. Your deal has sa-\nvored of dishonesty. You have not made a clean track behind you,\nand until there is an entire transformation in your life, you will be a\nliving curse to any church where you reside. You work for wages,\nand would not kindle a fire upon the altar of God, or shut the doors,\nfor nought. When you set the people an example of self-sacrifice and\nof devotion to the cause of God, making the truth and the salvation\nof the soul primary, then your influence will bring others into the\nsame position of self-sacrifice and devotion, to make the kingdom of\nheaven and the righteousness of Christ first. You feel authorized to\nadvantage yourself from the cause. Your brethren, from the liberality\nof their souls, favor and help you in various ways, and you receive it [546]\nas a matter of course, as your due. And if any are not perfectly free\nwith you, and do not favor you, you are jealous, and do not scruple\nto let them understand that you are not appreciated, and that they\nare selfish. You frequently refer to others who have done thus and\nso by you, as examples that they should imitate. These who have\nespecially favored you have gone beyond their duty. You have not\nearned their confidence or their liberalities. You have had no heavy\nburdens to bear in this cause, and you have cast on others many more\nburdens than you have lifted; yet you have been gaining in property,\nand obtaining the good things of this life, and you regard it all as\nyour right. Though you have received your weekly wages, you have\nnot always been satisfied. Notwithstanding the pay you received,\nyou have been managing continually to advantage yourself. The\n478 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ncause of God has paid you, whether you had much or little to show\nfor your labor. You have not earned the means you have received.\nYour wife has been petted by her parents and by her husband\nuntil she is of but very little use. You have both seen others burdened\nwith care and have not lifted the burdens with them. Your wife has\nlain as a helpless weight upon families, greatly to her own injury\nand to theirs, when, in point of health, she was better able to do\nthan some who were bearing her burdens and yours. Yet she did\nnot think of this. Neither of you could see the facts in the case and\nfeel for others. Some from whom you have received help in care\nfor yourselves and your child were not able, financially, to do what\nthey did; but they thought they were ministering to self-sacrificing\nservants of Christ; therefore they denied themselves and endured\ninconvenience and trouble, to bear burdens that you were better able\nto bear for yourselves than they were to bear them for you.\nYour wife has been reluctant to take up her life burdens. She\nwants a higher calling, and neglects the duties of today. Neither of[547]\nyou obeys the commandment of God: Love thy neighbor as thyself.\nSelf and selfishness shut out the needs of your neighbors from you.\nYour small, mercenary spirit is contagious. Your example has done\nmore to encourage love of the world, and a close, penurious spirit,\nthan anything else which has occurred in Wisconsin and Illinois.\nHad you done nothing but attend to your temporal interests, the\ncause of God in these two states would have been in a far better\ncondition than it is in today. The success you have had does not\ncome up to the injury you have done. The cause of God is prostrated.\nYour sensitiveness and jealousy have been an example for others.\nWe met this spirit in Illinois and in Wisconsin. The state of the\nchurches in ----- and vicinity has been deplorable. The lack of\nlove and union, the surmising, jealousy, and stubbornness, apparent\nin these churches, have been shaped very much by your traits of\ncharacter. The position which you occupied after the fanaticism at\n-----, standing back upon your dignity, splitting hairs, dividing the\nmatter with the fanatical and with those whom God had sent with\na special message, stood directly in the way of others\u2019 seeing and\ncorrecting their wrongs. Your course at that time, in failing to take\nhold and work on the right side to correct that blasting fanaticism,\ngave shape to the discouraging state of things which has grown out\nSelfishness Rebuked 479\nof that dark reign of fanaticism. Brethren C and D, and the entire\nchurch at -----, and the people at -----, were not brought out upon\ncorrect positions, as they might have been had you been humble and\nteachable, working in union with the servants of God.\nWhen a man who professes to be a teacher, a leader, ventures in\nthe course which you have pursued because of your stubbornness,\nhe will have a heavy weight of responsibility to bear for the souls\nwho have stumbled over him to perdition. A minister cannot be\ntoo careful of his influence. Stubbornness, jealousy, and selfishness\nshould have no part in his being; for if they are indulged, he will [548]\nruin more souls than he can save. If he does not overcome these\ndangerous elements in his character, it would be better for him to\nhave nothing to do with the cause of God. The indulgence of these\ntraits, which may not appear very bad to him, will place souls beyond\nhis reach and beyond the reach of others. If such ministers would\nlet things entirely alone, the souls susceptible to the influence of\nthe Spirit of God might be reached by those who can give them\nan example worthy of imitation, in accordance with the truth they\nteach. By a consistent life the minister will retain the confidence of\nthe seekers after truth, until he can help them to fasten their grasp\nfirmly upon the Rock of Ages; and afterward, if they are tempted,\nthat influence will enable him to warn, exhort, reprove, and counsel\nthem with success.\nAbove all other men, ministers of Christ, bearing the solemn truth\nfor these last days, should be free from selfishness. Benevolence\nshould dwell naturally with them. They should be ashamed of acts\ntoward their brethren which bear the marks of selfishness. They\nshould be patterns of piety, living epistles, known and read of all\nmen. Their fruits should be unto holiness. The spirit which they\npossess should be the opposite of that manifested by worldlings.\nBy accepting divine truth they become servants of God, and are no\nmore children of darkness and servants of the world. Christ has\nchosen them out of the world. The worldling understands not the\nmystery of godliness, therefore he is unacquainted with the motives\nwhich actuate them. Yet the spirit and life which is in them, which\nis manifested in their heavenly conversation, their self-denying, self-\nsacrificing, blameless life, has a convincing power that will lead\nunbelievers into all truth, lead them to obedience to Christ. They\n480 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nare living examples because they are like Christ. They are the light\nof the world, the salt of the earth, and their influence upon others\nis saving. They are Christ\u2019s representatives upon the earth. Their[549]\nobjects and desires are not inspired by earthly things, neither can they\nlabor for gain nor enjoy a selfish love for it. Eternal considerations\nare sufficient to overbalance every earthly attraction. A genuine\nChristian will labor only to please God, having an eye single to His\nglory and enjoying the reward of doing His will.\nMinisters especially should know the character and works of\nChrist, that they may imitate Him; for the character and works of a\ntrue Christian are like His. He laid aside His glory, His dominion,\nHis riches, and sought after those who were perishing in sin. He\nhumbled Himself to our necessities, that He might exalt us to heaven.\nSacrifice, self-denial, and disinterested benevolence characterized\nHis life. He is our pattern. Have you, Brother A, imitated the\nPattern? I answer: No. He is a perfect and holy example, given\nfor us to imitate. We cannot equal the pattern; but we shall not be\napproved of God if we do not copy it and, according to the ability\nwhich God has given, resemble it. Love for souls for whom Christ\ndied will lead to a denial of self and a willingness to make any\nsacrifice in order to be co-workers with Christ in the salvation of\nsouls.\nThe work of God\u2019s chosen servants will be fruitful if wrought\nin Him. Their words and works are the channels through which\nthe pure principles of truth and holiness are conveyed to the world.\nTheir exemplary lives make them the light of the world and the salt\nof the earth. The servants of God should, with the hand of faith,\nlay hold of the mighty arm and gather the divine rays of light from\nabove, while, with the hand of love, they reach after perishing souls.\nDiligence is necessary for this work. Indolence will permit souls\nwho might be saved, to drift beyond reach. God wants in His service\nministers who are awake, who are energetic and persevering, who\nare faithful watchmen upon Zion\u2019s walls, listening to hear the words[550]\nfrom the divine Teacher and faithfully proclaiming the same to the\npeople.\nYou are very much like Meroz. You are quite diligent when that\nwhich you do will bring some advantage to yourself, but there is\nno motive for special diligence unless you are to be benefited. You\nSelfishness Rebuked 481\nare decidedly a lazy man. You can eat your rations regularly, but\nyou have no special love for physical labor. No man can fill his\nposition as a minister unless he is industrious, diligent in business,\nand faithful in the performance of all the social and public duties\nof life. God has chosen us, as His servants, to His work, which\nrequires persevering energy. We are not to become pets and shun\ntoil, hardship, and conflicts.\nI was referred to the following words of inspiration: \u201cFor we\npreach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your\nservants for Jesus\u2019 sake. For God, who commanded the light to shine\nout of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the\nknowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we\nhave this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power\nmay be of God, and not of us. We are troubled on every side, yet\nnot distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but\nnot forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about\nin the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus\nmight be made manifest in our body.\u201d The sufficiency of the apostle\nwas not in himself, but in the presence and power of the Holy Spirit,\nwhose gracious influences filled his soul, bringing every thought\ninto subjection and obedience to Christ. His ministry was fruitful.\nThe first great commandment is: \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy\nGod with all thy heart.\u201d \u201cAnd the second is like, namely this, Thou\nshalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d On these two commandments\nthe whole interest and duty of moral beings hang. Those who do [551]\ntheir duty to others as they would that others should do to them are\nbrought into a position where God can reveal Himself to them. They\nwill be approved of Him. They are made perfect in love, and their\nlabors and prayers will not be in vain. They are continually receiving\ngrace and truth from the Fountainhead, and as freely transmitting to\nothers the divine light and salvation they receive. In them is fulfilled\nthe language of the Scripture: \u201cYe have your fruit unto holiness, and\nthe end everlasting life.\u201d\nSelfishness is abomination in the sight of God and holy angels.\nBecause of this sin many fail to attain the good which they are\ncapable of enjoying. They look with selfish eyes on their own things,\nand do not love and seek the interest of others as they do their\nown. They reverse God\u2019s order. Instead of doing for others what\n482 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthey wish others to do for them, they do for themselves what they\ndesire others to do for them, and do to others what they are most\nunwilling to have returned to them. Here is where you need to learn.\nLove is of God. You have not the love which dwelt in the bosom\nof Christ. The unconsecrated heart cannot originate, or produce,\nthis plant of heavenly origin, which, in order to flourish, must be\nwatered constantly with the dew of heaven. It can flourish only in\nthe heart where Christ reigns. This love cannot live and flourish\nwithout action; and it cannot act without increasing in fervency, and\nextending and diffusing its nature to others. This principle you have\ngreatly lacked, and thus all has been dark where its presence would\nhave made all light.\nMy brother, you need an entire transformation, a thorough con-\nversion. Without this you are only a blind leader. Your influence\ndoes not increase the love and union of those with whom you are.\nInstead of building up, you have a scattering influence. You have\ncursed the West with your deficiencies. While you are so deficient in\nthe grace of God, and so given to selfishness, you cannot bring up the[552]\nchurch to the position which God requires them to occupy. \u201cWhereof\nI am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which\nis given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God; even the mystery\nwhich hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is\nmade manifest to His saints: to whom God would make known what\nis the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which\nis Christ in you, the hope of glory: whom we preach, warning every\nman, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present\nevery man perfect in Christ Jesus: whereunto I also labor, striving\naccording to His working, which worketh in me mightily.\u201d\nGod\u2019s ministers must have the truth in their hearts in order to\nsuccessfully present it to others. They must be sanctified by the\ntruths they preach or they will be only stumbling blocks to sinners.\nThose who are called of God to minister in holy things are called to\nbe pure in heart and holy in life. \u201cBe ye clean, that bear the vessels\nof the Lord.\u201d If God pronounces a woe upon those who are called\nto preach the truth and refuse to obey, a heavier woe rests upon\nthose who take upon them this sacred work without clean hands and\npure hearts. As there are woes for those who preach the truth while\nthey are unsanctified in heart and life, so there are woes for those\nSelfishness Rebuked 483\nwho receive and maintain the unsanctified in the position which\nthey cannot fill. If the Spirit of God has not sanctified and made\npure and clean the hands and heart of those who minister in sacred\nthings, they will speak according to their own imperfect, deficient\nexperience, and their counsels will lead astray from God those who\nlook to them and trust in their judgment and experience. May God\nhelp ministers to heed the exhortation of Paul to the Corinthians:\n\u201cExamine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own\nselves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in\nyou, except ye be reprobates?\u201d There is a work for you to do, my\nbrother, if you gain eternal life. May God help you to do this work [553]\nthoroughly, that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.\nChicago, Illinois, Massasoit House,\nJuly 6, 1870.\n* * * * *\nChapter 64\u2014Fanaticism and Ignorance\nBrother E,\nWhile in Rochester, New York, December 25, 1865, before\nvisiting the State of Maine, I saw some things in relation to the\nperplexing and discouraging conditions of the cause in that state. I\nwas shown that quite a number who were thinking it their duty to\nteach the word of God publicly had mistaken their work. They had\nno call to devote themselves to this solemn, responsible work. They\nwere not qualified for the work of the ministry, for they could not\ninstruct others properly.\nThe experience of some had been obtained among a class of\nreligious fanatics who had no true sense of the exalted character of\nthe work. The religious experience of this class of professed Sev-\nenth-day Adventists was not reliable. They had not firm principles\nunderlying all their actions. They were self-confident, and boast-\nful. Their religion did not consist in righteous acts, true humility\nof soul, and sincere devotion to God, but in impulse, in noise and\nconfusion, spiced with eccentricities and oddities. They had not felt,\nneither could they feel, the necessity of being clothed with Christ\u2019s\nrighteousness. They had a righteousness of their own, which was\nas filthy rags, and which God can in no case accept. These persons\nhad no love for union and harmony of action. They delighted in\ndisorder. Confusion, distraction, and diversity of opinion were their\nchoice. They were ungovernable, unsubdued, unregenerated, and\nunconsecrated, and this element of confusion suited their undisci-\nplined minds. They were a curse to the cause of God and brought[554]\nthe name of Seventh-day Adventists into disrepute.\nThese persons had not experienced the work of reformation, or\nsanctification through the truth. They were coarse and uncultivated.\nThey had never tasted of the sweet, pure refinement of the world to\ncome. They had never experienced, neither had their hearts been\nawed by, the mystery of godliness. They placed divine and eternal\nthings upon a level with common things, and would talk of heaven\n484\nFanaticism and Ignorance 485\nand the coming of Jesus as they would of a horse. They had a\nsuperficial knowledge or theory of the truth, but further than this\nthey were ignorant. Its principles had not taken hold of their lives and\nled them to an abhorrence of self. They had never viewed themselves\nin the light in which Paul viewed himself, which led him to see the\nmoral defects in his character. They had never been slain by the\nlaw of God, and had not separated themselves from their impurities\nand defilement. It is the favorite occupation of some of this class to\nengage in trifling conversation and levity. This habit they contracted,\nand indulged upon occasions which should have been characterized\nby solemn meditation and devotion. In doing this, they manifested\na lack of true dignity and refinement, and forfeited the esteem of\nsensible persons who had no knowledge of the truth. This class\nthrew themselves into a current of temptation and kept where the\nenemy led them successfully, and he has so easily controlled their\nminds and corrupted their entire experience that in all probability\nthey will be unable to recover themselves out of his snare and obtain\na healthful experience.\nThe fires of the day of God will consume the stubble and chaff,\nand there will be nothing left of any who continue in the ungodly\ncourse which they have so long loved. This class have a disrelish for\nthe society of those whom God is truly with. Their religious experi-\nence is of so low an order that they have no part nor lot in a rational, [555]\nintelligent religious experience; therefore they have despised the\nsociety of those whom God leads and is teaching. Sarcasm and irony\nis the stronghold of some peculiar minds of this class. They are bold\nand insolent, and do not regard good manners. They have no care to\ndiscriminate and render honor to whom honor is due. They manifest\na proud, rebellious, defiant spirit against those who differ from their\nopinions. Their boisterous manners and wrong course lead the true\nservant of God to feel that they have resisted the efforts made for\nthem, and he becomes disheartened in reference to laboring any\nfurther in their behalf. They engage in a contemptible triumph of\nexactly the same nature as that which Satan and evil angels engage\nin over the souls whom they secure. They have Satan and evil angels\non their side to exult with them. The cases of the persons in whom\nthis cast of character is peculiarly and strikingly developed are hope-\nless. They are incased in self-righteousness, and everything like\n486 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nrefinement and elevation of character with which they are brought\nin contact is termed by them pride and lack of humility. Coarseness\nand ignorance are regarded as humility.\nWith this class you have obtained a large share of your religious\nexperience; therefore you are not qualified for the work of teach-\ning the most solemn, refined, elevating, and withal the most testing\nmessage to mortals. You may reach a class of minds, but the more\nintelligent portion of the community will be driven further off by\nyour labors. You have not a sufficient knowledge of even the com-\nmon branches of education to be an instructor of men and women\nwho have a wily devil on the other hand to suggest and devise ways\nand means to lead them from the truth.\nThe teachers of the common schools are required to be masters of\ntheir business. They are closely examined to ascertain if children can\nproperly be trusted to their care. By investigation the thoroughness[556]\nof their qualifications is tested according to the importance of the\nposition which they are required to occupy. I saw that God\u2019s work is\nof as much more exalted character, and of as much higher interest,\nas the eternal is above the temporal. A mistake made here cannot be\nrepaired. It is of infinite importance that all who go forth to teach the\ntruth should be qualified for their work. No less strict investigation\nshould be instituted in reference to their ability to teach the truth than\nin the case of those who teach our schools. God\u2019s work has been\nbelittled by the slack, loose course pursued by professed ministers\nof Christ.\nI was shown that ministers must be sanctified and holy, and must\nhave a knowledge of the word of God. They should be familiar with\nBible arguments and prepared to give a reason of their hope, or they\nshould cease their labors and engage in a calling where deficiency\nwill not involve such tremendous consequences. Ministers of the\npopular denominations of the day are acceptable preachers if they\ncan speak upon a few simple points of the Bible; but the ministers\nwho are spreading unpopular truth for these last days, who have to\nmeet men of learning, men of strong minds, and opposers of every\ntype, should know what they are about. They should not take upon\nthemselves the responsibility of teaching the truth unless they are\nqualified for the work. Before engaging in, or devoting themselves\nto, the work they should become Bible students. If they have not an\nFanaticism and Ignorance 487\neducation so that they can speak in public with acceptance, and do\njustice to the truth, and honor the Lord whom they profess to serve,\nthey should wait till they are fitted for the position.\nBrother E, you cannot fill the position of a minister of Christ. I\nsaw that you lacked a correct religious experience. You have not\na knowledge of yourself. You cannot even read correctly, or use\nlanguage which would commend the truth to the understanding of [557]\nan intelligent community. You lack discrimination. You would not\nknow when it was proper to speak or wise to keep silent. You have\nso long thought, with the peculiar class I have mentioned, that you\nknew it all, that you will not see your deficiencies when they are\npresented before you. You possess a large share of self-esteem,\nand your experience has been characterized by self-confidence and\nboastfulness.\nYou are not teachable, therefore the cause of God would not\nprosper in your hands. You would fail to recognize a defeat when\nyou met with one. The cause of God would be brought into disrepute\nand dishonor by your labors, and you would fail to discover the fact.\nA certain class may be convinced by you of the truth; but more\nwould be turned away and placed where they could not be reached\nby proper, judicious labor. Interwoven with your experience are\nthings that will prove detrimental to the truth. God cannot accept\nyou as a representative of the truth.\nYour manners have not been refined and elevated. Your deport-\nment has not been pleasing to God. Your words have been careless.\nYou lack piety and devotion. You have not obtained an experience\nin the spiritual life. You fail to understand how to rightly divide\nthe word of life, giving to each his portion of meat in due season.\nYou have preferred to contend and contest points when you were\nentirely out of your place and could but meet with defeat. This is\nthe spirit of the class in Maine whom I have mentioned. It is their\ndelight to engage in contest and brave it through. You would not\nmanifest meekness in instructing those who oppose themselves. You\nwill ever be crippled, in a degree, by your unfortunate experience.\nYou lack self-culture and meekness. You have important lessons to\nlearn before you can become an unassuming, acceptable follower of\nChrist, even in a private capacity.\nChapter 65\u2014An Indulged Daughter[558]\nDear Friend F ,\nI was shown that you were in danger of being under the full\ncontrol of the great adversary of souls. Your experience at ----- was\nnot good for you. Your stay at ----- hurt you; you became proud and\nvain. Persons were not wanting who unwisely petted and praised\nyou until you became vain, pert, and saucy. You have been opposed\nto restraint, have been headstrong, willful, and stubborn, and have\nmade your parents much trouble. They have erred. Your father has\nunwisely petted you. You have taken advantage of this and have\nbecome deceptive. You have received approbation which you did\nnot deserve.\nYou had your own head very much at ----- and took liberties\nthat should not have been allowed for a moment. When you or\nyour sisters were reproved you felt insulted and reported the matter\nto your mother as though you had been abused. You exaggerated,\nand she was nervous and easily excited and irritated if she thought\nher position and dignity were not respected. She was displeased\nthat anyone should dictate to her children, and she did not conceal\nher displeasure. She spoke improperly to those who should have\ncommanded her respect. Your mother showed great lack of wisdom\nin taking your part and censuring those whom she should have\nthanked rather than blamed. She hurt you and did a work for you\nthat she can never fully repair. You triumphed because you thought\nyourself secure from censure, thought that you could do as you\npleased. Your mother\u2019s eye was not always upon you; and if it had\nbeen, she could not have discerned your evil tendencies.\nAt school you had a good and noble teacher, yet you felt indig-\nnant because you were restrained. You thought that because you\nwere the daughter of G your teacher should show a preference for[559]\nyou and should not take the liberty to correct and reprove you. Your\nsisters also partook of the same spirit. You carried your complaints\nto your parents; they heard your version of matters and sympathized\n488\nIndulged Daughter 489\nwith you more or less, and their feelings were stirred by your ex-\naggerated reports. They injured you. You had not been as strictly\ndisciplined as you should have been. Yet you were offended because\nyou could not have your own way, but were compelled to yield to\nthe decided, thorough manner of Brother H\u2019s instructions. While\nin school, you were sometimes troublesome, impudent, and defiant,\nand greatly lacked modesty and decorum. You were bold, selfish,\nand self-exalted, and needed firm discipline at home as well as at\nschool.\nYour mind is impure. You were relieved from care and labor\naltogether too long. Household duties would have been one of the\nrichest blessings that you could have had. Weariness would not\nhave injured you one tenth as much as have your lascivious thoughts\nand conduct. You have received incorrect ideas in regard to girls\u2019\nand boys\u2019 associating together, and it has been very congenial to\nyour mind to be in the company of the boys. You are not pure in\nheart and mind. You have been injured by reading love stories and\nromances, and your mind has been fascinated by impure thoughts.\nYour imagination has become corrupt, until you seem to have no\npower to control your thoughts. Satan leads you captive as he pleases.\nYou are not happy. You do not love God or His people. You have a\nbitter spirit toward those who see your true character. You seem to\nblame them for the view they take of your case, but you are the one\nto blame. Your conduct has been such as to call forth cautions and\nwarnings. You have only yourself to censure in this.\nYou are a dangerous associate, and have done much harm by\nyour influence in -----. You have led instead of being led. You have [560]\ndishonored God and are accountable to Him for the work of evil\nwhich you have wrought by your influence. Your conduct has not\nbeen chaste, modest, or becoming. You have not had the fear of\nGod before your eyes. You have so often dissembled in order to\naccomplish your plans that you bear a violated conscience. My dear\ngirl, unless you stop just where you are, ruin is surely before you.\nCease your daydreaming, your castle-building. Stop your thoughts\nfrom running in the channel of folly and corruption. You cannot\nsafely associate with the boys. A tide of temptation is roused and\nsurges in your breast, having a tendency to uproot principle, female\n490 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nvirtue, and true modesty. If you go on in your willful, headstrong\ncourse, what will be your fate?\nA new year has dawned upon us. What have you determined to\ndo? What have you resolved shall be the record borne up to God by\nthe ministering angels of your work from day to day? What words\nthat you have uttered will appear in the page of the book of records?\nWhat thoughts will the Searcher of hearts find cherished by you?\nHe is a discerner of the thoughts, of the intents and purposes of the\nheart. You have a fearful record of the past year, which is laid open\nto the view of the Majesty of heaven and the myriads of pure, sinless\nangels. Your thoughts and acts, your desperate and unsanctified\nfeelings, may have been concealed from mortals; but remember, the\nmost trivial acts of your life are open to the view of God. You have\na spotted record in heaven. The sins you have committed are all\nregistered there.\nGod\u2019s frown is upon you, and yet you appear destitute of feeling;\nyou do not realize your lost and undone condition. At times you do\nhave feelings of remorse; but your proud, independent spirit soon\nrises above this, and you stifle the voice of conscience. You are\nnot happy, yet you imagine that if you could have your own way\nunrestrained you would be happy. Poor child! you occupy a position[561]\nsimilar to that of Eve in Eden. She imagined that she would be\nhighly exalted if she could only eat of the fruit of the tree which God\nhad forbidden her even to touch, lest she die. She ate, and lost all\nthe glories of Eden.\nYou should control your thoughts. This will not be an easy task;\nyou cannot accomplish it without close and even severe effort. Yet\nGod requires this of you; it is a duty resting upon every accountable\nbeing. You are responsible to God for your thoughts. If you indulge\nin vain imaginations, permitting your mind to dwell upon impure\nsubjects, you are, in a degree, as guilty before God as if your thoughts\nwere carried into action. All that prevents the action is the lack of\nopportunity. Day and night dreaming and castle-building are bad and\nexceedingly dangerous habits. When once established, it is next to\nimpossible to break up such habits, and direct the thoughts to pure,\nholy, elevated themes. You will have to become a faithful sentinel\nover your eyes, ears, and all your senses if you would control your\nmind and prevent vain and corrupt thoughts from staining your soul.\nIndulged Daughter 491\nThe power of grace alone can accomplish this most desirable work.\nYou are weak in this direction.\nYou have become wayward, bold, and daring. The grace of\nGod has no place in your heart. In the strength of God alone can\nyou bring yourself where you can be a recipient of His grace, an\ninstrument of righteousness. Not only does God require you to\ncontrol your thoughts, but also your passions and affections. Your\nsalvation depends upon your governing yourself in these things.\nPassion and affection are powerful agents. If misapplied, if set in\noperation through wrong motives, if misplaced, they are powerful to\naccomplish your ruin and leave you a miserable wreck, without God\nand without hope.\nThe imagination must be positively and persistently controlled if [562]\nthe passions and affections are made subject to reason, conscience,\nand character. You are in danger, for you are just upon the point\nof sacrificing your eternal interests at the altar of passion. Passion\nis obtaining positive control of your entire being\u2014passion of what\nquality? of a base, destructive nature. By yielding to it, you will\nembitter the lives of your parents, bring sadness and shame to your\nsisters, sacrifice your own character, and forfeit heaven and a glo-\nrious immortal life. Are you ready to do this? I appeal to you to\nstop where you are. Advance not another step in your headstrong,\nwanton course; for before you are misery and death. Unless you\nexercise self-control in regard to your passions and affections, you\nwill surely bring yourself into disrepute with all around you, and\nwill bring upon your character disgrace which will last while you\nlive.\nYou are disobedient to your parents, pert, unthankful, and un-\nholy. These miserable traits are the fruits of a corrupt tree. You are\nforward. You love the boys, and love to make them the theme of\nyour conversation. \u201cOut of the abundance of the heart the mouth\nspeaketh.\u201d Habits have become powerful to control you; and you\nhave learned to deceive in order to carry out your purposes and\naccomplish your desires.\nI do not consider your case hopeless; if I did, my pen would not\nbe tracing these lines. In the strength of God you can redeem the\npast. Your name is already a byword in -----; but you can change\nthis by using the powers which God has given you. You may even\n492 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nnow gain a moral excellence so that your name may be associated\nwith things pure and holy. You can be elevated. God has provided\nfor you the necessary helps. He has invited you to come to Him,\nand has promised to bear your burdens and give you rest of soul.\n\u201cLearn of Me,\u201d says the divine Teacher, \u201cfor I am meek and lowly\nin heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\u201d You have long\nbeen above this lowliness and meekness. You will have to learn[563]\nthis important lesson of the divine Teacher before you can find the\nrest promised. You have thought so much of yourself, of your own\nsmartness, that it has led you to such affectation and vanity as to\nmake you almost a fool. You have a deceitful tongue, which has\nindulged in misrepresentation and falsehood. Oh, my dear girl, if\nyou could only arouse, if your slumbering, deadened conscience\ncould be awakened, and you could cherish a habitual impression\nof the presence of God, and keep yourself subject to the control of\nan enlightened, wakeful conscience, you would be happy yourself\nand a blessing to your parents, whose hearts you now wound. You\ncould be an instrument of righteousness to your associates. You\nneed a thorough conversion, and without it you are in the gall of\nbitterness and in the bonds of iniquity. You may imagine yourself\nfree when following the lead of your own wayward, pernicious mind;\nbut you are in the most degrading bondage. Without the principles\nof religion, you may consider yourself an object of envy; but all\nwho are good and virtuous will regard your character with pity and\nyour course with abhorrence. You can become a partaker of the\ndivine nature if you will escape the corruption that is in the world\nthrough lust; or by being a partaker of it, you may sink down in this\ncorruption and bear the impress of the satanic.\nYou have younger sisters whom you can bless with your in-\nfluence. You can reflect a sweet, precious light in your father\u2019s\nfamily and make his heart glad; or you can be a dark shadow, a\ncloud, a storm which shall desolate. Your passion for reading is\nof such a character that if indulged it will pervert the imagination\nand will prove your ruin. Unless you restrain your thoughts, your\nreading, and your words, your imagination will become hopelessly\ndiseased. Read your Bible attentively, prayerfully, and be guided by\nits teachings. This is your safety.\nKeep clear of the boys. In their society your temptations become[564]\nIndulged Daughter 493\nearnest and powerful. Put marriage out of your girl\u2019s head. You are\nin no sense fit for this. You need years of experience before you\ncan be qualified to understand the duties, and take up the burdens,\nof married life. Positively guard your thoughts, your passions, and\nyour affections. Do not degrade these to minister to lust. Elevate\nthem to purity, devote them to God.\nYou may become a prudent, modest, virtuous girl, but not with-\nout earnest effort. You must watch, you must pray, you must medi-\ntate, you must investigate your motives and your actions. Closely\nanalyze your feelings and your acts. Would you, in the presence\nof your father, perform an impure action? No, indeed. But you do\nthis in the presence of your heavenly Father, who is so much more\nexalted, so holy, so pure. Yes; you corrupt your own body in the\npresence of the pure, sinless angels, and in the presence of Christ;\nand you continue to do this irrespective of conscience, irrespective\nof the light and warnings given you.\nRemember, a record is made of all your acts. You must meet\nagain the most secret things of your life. You will be judged accord-\ning to the deeds done in the body. Are you prepared for this? You\nare injuring yourself physically and morally. God has enjoined upon\nyou to preserve your body holy. \u201cKnow ye not that your body is the\ntemple of the Holy Ghost, ... and ye are not your own? For ye are\nbought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your\nspirit, which are God\u2019s.\u201d Will not God judge you for debasing to\nlust the passions and affections when He claims the wealth of your\naffections and your entire being to be devoted to His service?\nAgain I warn you as one who must meet these lines in that day\nwhen the case of everyone shall be decided. Yield yourself to Christ [565]\nwithout delay; He alone, by the power of His grace, can redeem you\nfrom ruin. He alone can bring your moral and mental powers into\na state of health. Your heart may be warm with the love of God;\nyour understanding, clear and mature; your conscience, illuminated,\nquick, and pure; your will, upright and sanctified, subject to the\ncontrol of the Spirit of God. You can make yourself what you\nchoose. If you will now face rightabout, cease to do evil and learn\nto do well, then you will be happy indeed; you will be successful in\nthe battles of life, and rise to glory and honor in the better life than\nthis. \u201cChoose you this day whom ye will serve.\u201d\n494 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\n* * * * *\nChapter 66\u2014To a Minister\u2019s Wife\nDear Sister I,\nYesterday I had some time for reflection, and now have a few\nthoughts that I wish to present to you. I could not readily answer\nyour question concerning your duty to travel with your husband. I\nhad not yet learned the result of your accompanying him; therefore I\ncould not speak as understandingly as if I had been acquainted with\nthe influence you had exerted. I cannot give counsel in the dark. I\nmust know that my counsel is correct in the light. Great advantage\nis taken of my words, therefore I must move very cautiously. After\ncareful reflection, seeking to call up things which have been shown\nme in your case, I am prepared to write to you.\nFrom the letters you have written to me in regard to Brother\nJ, I fear that you are prejudiced and have some jealousy. I hope\nthis is not the case, but fear that it is. You and your husband are\nvery sensitive and naturally jealous, therefore you need to guard\nyourselves in this direction. We do not feel that Brother J sees all\nthings clearly. We think his wife is far from right and has great [566]\ninfluence over him; yet we hope that if all move in wisdom toward\nhim, he will recover himself from the snare of Satan and see all\nthings clearly.\nDear sister, we are determined to be impartial and not have our\nwords or acts in any way influenced by hearsay. We have no pets.\nMay the Lord give us heavenly wisdom, that we may deal righteously\nand impartially, and thus meet the mind of His Spirit. We do not\nwant our works wrought in self. We do not want personal feelings.\nIf we think we are not specially considered, or if we see, or imagine\nthat we see, positive neglect, we want the spirit of our forgiving\nMaster. The people who professed to be His followers received Him\nnot, because His face was toward Jerusalem, and He gave no special\nindication that He was to tarry with them. They did not open their\ndoors to the heavenly Guest, and did not urge His abiding with them,\nalthough they beheld Him weary with His journey, and the night\n495\n496 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwas drawing on. They gave no sign that they really desired Jesus.\nThe disciples knew that He designed to tarry there that night, and\nthey felt so keenly the slight thus given to their Lord that they were\nangry, and prayed Jesus to show proper resentment and call down\nfire from heaven to consume those who had thus abused Him. But\nHe rebuked their indignation and zeal for His honor, and told them\nthat He came, not to visit with judgment, but to show mercy.\nThis lesson of our Saviour\u2019s is for you and for me. No resentment\nmust come into our hearts. When reviled, we must not revile again.\nO jealousy and evil surmising, what mischief have ye wrought! how\nhave ye turned friendship and love into bitterness and hatred! We\nmust be less proud, less sensitive, have less self-love, and be dead\nto self-interest. Our interest must be submerged in Christ and we\nbe able to say: \u201cI live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.\u201d Christ has\ntold us how to make everything easy and happy as we pass along:[567]\n\u201cCome unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will\ngive you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am\nmeek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\u201d The\ngreat difficulty is, there is so little meekness and lowliness that the\nyoke galls and the burden is heavy. When we possess true meekness\nand lowliness we are so lost in Christ that we do not take neglect\nor slights to heart; we are deaf to reproach and blind to scorn and\ninsult.\nSister I, as the peculiarities of your case come clearly before me,\nI see a serious objection to your traveling. You do not take upon\nyourself the burdens that you should. You call forth sympathy from\nothers, but do not give in return. You lay your whole weight where\nyou are, and too frequently are waited upon when those who bear\ntheir own burden and yours also are no more able to do this than\nyourself. You are too helpless for your own good, and the influence\nis not such as that of a minister\u2019s wife should be. You need more\nphysical labor than you have; and from what has been shown me,\nI think that you would be more in the line of your duty engaging\ncheerfully in the work of educating your daughter and encouraging\na love of domestic duties. You did not receive the education in this\ndirection that you should have had in your girlhood, and this has\nmade your life more unhappy than it would otherwise have been.\nYou do not love physical labor; and when journeying, you fill the bill\nTo a Minister\u2019s Wife 497\nof an invalid, and fail to be helpful and do what you can to lighten\nthe burdens you make. You fail to realize that frequently the very\nones who wait on you are no more able to perform the extra task\nthan you are. You lean on others, and lay your whole weight upon\nthem. I have no evidence that God has called you to do a special\nwork in traveling.\nYou have an education to obtain that you do not yet possess.\nWho can so well instruct the child as the mother? Who can so well [568]\nlearn the defects in her own organization and in her child\u2019s as the\nmother while in the performance of the duties which Heaven has\nallotted her? The fact that you do not love this work is no evidence\nthat it is not the work which the Lord has assigned you. You have\nnot sufficient physical or mental strength to make it an object for\nyou to travel. You wish to be ministered unto, instead of ministering\nto others. You are not helpful enough to offset the burden you are to\nyour husband and to those around you.\nThose who cannot wisely manage their own child or children\nare not qualified to act wisely in church matters or to deal with wiry\nminds subject to Satan\u2019s special temptations. If they can cheerfully\nand lovingly perform the part required of them as parents, then they\ncan better understand how to bear burdens in the church. Dear sister,\nI advise you to make a good wife to your husband and a good home\nfor him. Rely upon your own resources, and lean less heavily upon\nhim. Arouse yourself to do the very work which the Lord would\nhave you do. You are inclined to be anxious to do some great work,\nto fill some large mission, and neglect the small duties right in your\npath, which are just as necessary to be accomplished as the larger.\nYou walk over these and aspire to a larger work. Let your ambition\nbe aroused to be useful, to be a workman in the world instead of a\nspectator.\nMy dear sister, I speak plainly; for I dare not do otherwise. I\nplead with you to take up life\u2019s burdens instead of shunning them.\nHelp your husband by helping yourself. The ideas which you both\nhold of the dignity to be maintained by the minister are not in accor-\ndance with the example of our Lord. The minister of Christ should\npossess sobriety, meekness, love, long-suffering, forbearance, pity,\nand courtesy. He should be circumspect, elevated in thought and\nconversation, and of blameless deportment. This is gospel dignity. [569]\n498 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nBut if a minister comes to a family where he can wait on himself,\nhe should do so by all means; and he should by his example en-\ncourage industry by engaging in physical labor when he has not a\nmultiplicity of other duties and burdens. He will not detract from his\ndignity, and will better relate himself to health and life, by engaging\nin useful labor. The circulation of the blood will be better equalized.\nPhysical labor, a diversion from mental, will draw the blood from\nthe brain. It is essential for your husband to have more physical\nlabor in order to relieve the brain. Digestion will be promoted by\nphysical exercise. If he would spend a part of every day in physical\nexercise, when not positively urged by a protracted effort in a course\nof meetings, it would be an advantage to him, and would not detract\nfrom ministerial dignity. The example would be in accordance with\nthat of our divine Master.\nWe love you, and want you to be successful in your efforts in\nstriving for the better life.\nSteamer \u201cKeokuk,\u201d Mississippi River,\nSeptember 30, 1869.\n* * * * *\nChapter 67\u2014Unfaithfulness in Stewardship\nDear Brother K,\nA few things which are pressing upon my mind I feel a duty to\nwrite to Brother L and you. I have related the substance of the matter\nbefore you; but as my mind is still burdened, I will write.\nI was shown that with you,I and mine have come to be first. You\nhave had so great a care for yourself that the Lord has had no room\nto work for you. You have given Him no chance. He has, in a great\nmeasure, given Brother L and yourself up to work according to your\nown judgment, that you might be convinced that your wisdom is\nfoolishness. You have not worked for the interest of the widow and [570]\nfatherless, as the Lord has especially enjoined upon His followers;\nneither have you made the cases of the Lord\u2019s poor your own, by\ntaking a special interest in them, nor have you sought to glorify\nGod and magnify His name; therefore the Lord has suffered you and\nBrother L to pursue a course of your own choosing. He has permitted\nyou to look out for yourselves. Your own selfish interests have been\nthe foundation of your actions, and you will reap the harvest which\nyou yourselves have sown. I saw that you would verily receive the\nreward that sooner or later follows the serving of your own selfish\ninterest. \u201cGive an account of thy stewardship,\u201d must be heard by\nyou. You are accountable to God for the work entrusted to you,\nwhich you have shamefully neglected in order to serve yourselves.\nHad you been seeking to show yourselves approved unto God,\nseeking the kingdom of heaven and the righteousness of Christ, you\nwould have been doing the works of Christ. The poor, the widows,\nthe fatherless, would have called forth from you the tenderest pity\nand sympathy; you would have been interested in them and treated\nthem as you would wish your wife and children treated were they\nleft dependent and afflicted to the cold mercies of the world or of\nunfeeling, heartless professed Christians. There has been on your\npart a sad, unfeeling, heartless neglect of the unfortunate. You have\n499\n500 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nserved your own interest, irrespective of their great need. God cannot\nbless you until you see your sin in regard to these things.\nI saw that the Lord\u2019s work has not been more sacred in your eyes\nthan your own business. Eternal things have not been discerned.\nThe Lord has sent warnings and reproofs to arouse you to a sense of\nyour duty by letting you know what is expected of you, but you have\nnot regarded these warnings. You have not realized that you were\ndealing with God. You have robbed God and served yourselves.\nThere are many who in good faith have sent in to the office[571]\nmeans which they had to make a sacrifice to obtain. Some, both\nmen and women, have worked very hard, and consecrated to the\nLord the means obtained by hard labor and the closest economy,\nand have sent it to the office to advance the cause. Poor widows\nhave sent nearly their whole dependence, trusting in God to take\ncare of them, and the means has been consecrated with prayers and\ntears, yet sent with joyfulness, they feeling that they were aiding in\nthe great work of saving souls. Poor families have sold their only\ncow, denying themselves and their little children of milk, feeling that\nthey were making a sacrifice for God. They have put their means\ninto the office in good faith. Selfishness and mismanagement have\nhelped to squander this means. God holds those accountable who\nhave had the handling of it. \u201cGive an account of thy stewardship,\u201d\nwill soon be heard. May the Lord help you to free yourselves from\nevery blemish.\nBattle Creek, Michigan,\nJanuary 17, 1870.\n* * * * *\nChapter 68\u2014Mistaken Sensitiveness\nDear Sister M,\nYour case is upon my mind, and I cannot forbear to commit to\nwriting my convictions from what I have seen in regard to you. I am\nsatisfied that you are wandering in mist and darkness. You do not\nsee things in the right light. You blind your eyes in regard to your\nown case by excusing yourself thus: \u201cI would not have done this or\nthat if it had not been for certain influences of others which led me\nto that course of action.\u201d\nYou are continually finding fault with circumstances, which is\nnothing less than finding fault with providences. You are continually [572]\ncasting about for somebody or something to answer the place of a\nscapegoat, upon which you can lay the blame of having brought\nyou into a position to feel and speak unworthy of a Christian. In-\nstead of simply censuring yourself for your defects, you censure the\ncircumstances and occasions which led you to develop the traits in\nyour character which lie dormant or hid beneath the surface unless\nsomething arises to disturb and arouse them to life and action. Then\nthey appear in all their deformity and strength.\nYou deceive yourself with the idea that these unamiable traits do\nnot exist, until you are brought into positions which make you act\nand speak in a manner that reveals them to all. You are not willing to\nsee and confess that it is your carnal nature which has not yet been\ntransformed and brought into subjection to Christ. You have not yet\ncrucified self.\nYou sometimes pass along days and weeks without developing\nthe spirit of evil which I have named impatience, and a dictatorial\nspirit, a desire to control your husband. Your loving to rule and to\nbring others to your ideas has nearly ruined yourself and him. You\nlove to suggest and to dictate to others. You love to have them feel\nand see that you have the very best light, and are especially led of\nGod. If they do not, you begin to surmise, to become jealous, to feel\na spirit of unrest; you are dissatisfied and exceedingly unhappy.\n501\n502 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nNothing so readily arouses the evil traits in your character as\nto dispute your wisdom and judgment in exercising your authority.\nYour strong, overbearing spirit, which has appeared to slumber, is\nroused to its fullest energy. Self then controls you, and you are\nno more governed by candid reason and calm judgment than is an\ninsane person. Self in all its strength wrestles for the mastery, and\nit will take the firmest mind to hold you in restraint. After your\nfit of insanity has gone by, then you can bear to have your course\nquestioned. But you stand ready to justify yourself by the plea that[573]\nyou are so sensitive; you feel so deeply; you suffer so much. I saw\nthat all this will not excuse you in the sight of God. You mistake\npride for sensitiveness. Self is prominent. When self is crucified,\nthen this sensitiveness, or pride, will die; until then you are not a\nChristian. To be a Christian is to be Christlike, to possess humility\nand a meek and quiet spirit that will bear contradiction without\nbeing enraged or becoming insane. If the deceptive covering which\nis about you could be rent asunder, so that you could see yourself as\nGod sees you, you would no longer seek to justify self, but would\nfall all broken upon Christ, the only One who can remove the defects\nin your character and then bind you up.\n* * * * *\nChapter 69\u2014Convocations\nGod gave direction to the Israelites to assemble before Him\nat set periods, in the place which He should choose, and observe\nspecial days wherein no unnecessary work was to be done, but the\ntime was to be devoted to a consideration of the blessings which\nHe had bestowed upon them. At these special seasons they were\nto bring gifts, freewill offerings, and thank offerings unto the Lord,\naccording as He had blessed them. The manservant and maidservant,\nthe stranger, the fatherless and widow, were directed to rejoice that\nGod had by His own wonderful power brought them from servile\nbondage to the enjoyment of freedom. And they were commanded\nnot to appear before the Lord empty. They were to bring tokens\nof their gratitude to God for His continual mercies and blessings\nbestowed upon them. These offerings were varied according to\nthe estimate which the donors placed upon the blessings they were\nprivileged to enjoy. Thus the characters of the people were plainly [574]\ndeveloped. Those who placed a high value upon the blessings which\nGod bestowed upon them brought offerings in accordance with\ntheir appreciation of these blessings. Those whose moral powers\nwere stupefied and benumbed by selfishness and idolatrous love of\nthe favors received, rather than inspired by fervent love for their\nbountiful Benefactor, brought meager offerings. Thus their hearts\nwere revealed. Besides these special religious feast days of gladness\nand rejoicing, the yearly Passover was to be commemorated by the\nJewish nation. The Lord covenanted that if they were faithful in the\nobservance of His requirements, He would bless them in all their\nincrease and in all the work of their hands.\nGod requires no less of His people in these last days, in sacrifices\nand offerings, than He did of the Jewish nation. Those whom He has\nblessed with a competency, and even the widow and the fatherless,\nshould not be unmindful of His blessings. Especially should those\nwhom God has prospered render to Him the things that are His.\nThey should appear before Him with a spirit of self-sacrifice and\n503\n504 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nbring their offerings in accordance with the blessings which He\nhas bestowed upon them. But many whom God prospers manifest\nbase ingratitude to Him. If His blessings rest upon them, and He\nincreases their substance, they make these bounties as cords to bind\nthem to the love of their possessions; they allow worldly business to\ntake possession of their affections and their entire being, and neglect\ndevotion and religious privileges. They cannot afford to leave their\nbusiness cares and come before God even once a year. They turn\nthe blessings of God into a curse. They serve their own temporal\ninterests to the neglect of God\u2019s requirements.\nMen who possess thousands remain at home year after year,\nengrossed in their worldly cares and interests, and feeling that they\ncannot afford to make the small sacrifice of attending the yearly[575]\ngatherings to worship God. He has blessed them in basket and in\nstore, and surrounded them with His benefits on the right hand and\non the left, yet they withhold from Him the small offerings He has\nrequired of them. They love to serve themselves. Their souls will be\nlike the unrefreshed desert without the dew or rain of heaven. The\nLord has brought to them the precious blessing of His grace. He has\ndelivered them from the slavery of sin and the bondage of error, and\nhas opened to their darkened understandings the glorious light of\npresent truth. And shall these evidences of God\u2019s love and mercy\ncall forth no gratitude in return? Will those who profess to believe\nthat the end of all things is at hand be blind to their own spiritual\ninterest and live for this world and this life alone? Do they expect\nthat their eternal interest will take care of itself? Spiritual strength\nwill not come without an effort on their part.\nMany who profess to be looking for the appearing of our Lord\nare anxious, burdened seekers for worldly gain. They are blind to\ntheir eternal interest. They labor for that which satisfieth not. They\nspend their money for that which is not bread. They strive to content\nthemselves with the treasures they have laid up on the earth, which\nmust perish. And they neglect the preparation for eternity, which\nshould be the first and only real work of life.\nLet all who possibly can, attend these yearly gatherings. All\nshould feel that God requires this of them. If they do not avail\nthemselves of the privileges which He has provided that they may\nbecome strong in Him and in the power of His grace, they will grow\nConvocations 505\nweaker and weaker, and have less and less desire to consecrate all\nto God. Come, brethren and sisters, to these sacred convocation\nmeetings, to find Jesus. He will come up to the feast. He will be\npresent, and He will do for you that which you most need to have\ndone. Your farms should not be considered of greater value than the [576]\nhigher interests of the soul. All the treasures which you possess, be\nthey ever so valuable, would not be rich enough to buy you peace\nand hope, which would be infinite gain, if it cost you all you have\nand the toils and sufferings of a lifetime. A strong, clear sense of\neternal things, and a heart willing to yield all to Christ, are blessings\nof more value than all the riches and pleasures and glories of this\nworld.\nThese camp meetings are of importance. They cost something.\nThe servants of God are wearing out their lives to help the people,\nwhile many of them appear as if they did not want help. For fear of\nlosing a little of this world\u2019s gain, some let these precious privileges\ncome and go as though they were of but little importance. Let all\nwho profess to believe the truth respect every privilege that God\noffers them to obtain clearer views of His truth, of His requirements,\nand of the necessary preparation for His coming. A calm, cheerful,\nobedient trust in God is what He requires.\nYou need not weary yourselves with busy anxieties and needless\ncares. Work on for the day, faithfully doing the work which God\u2019s\nprovidence assigns you, and He will have a care for you. Jesus will\ndeepen and widen your blessings. You must make efforts if you have\nsalvation at last. Come to these meetings prepared to work. Leave\nyour home cares, and come to find Jesus, and He will be found of\nyou. Come with your offerings as God has blessed you. Show your\ngratitude to your Creator, the Giver of all your benefits, by a freewill\noffering. Let none who are able come empty-handed. \u201cBring ye all\nthe tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in Mine house,\nand prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not\nopen you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that\nthere shall not be room enough to receive it.\u201d\n506 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nNumber Twenty\u2014Testimony for the [577]\nChurch\nChapter 70\u2014Social Meetings\nI recently received a letter from a brother whom I highly respect,\nmaking inquiries in regard to how meetings should be conducted.\nHe inquires if there should be many prayers offered in succession,\nand then a relief of a few moments, and quite a number of prayers\nagain.\nFrom the light I have had upon the subject I have decided that\nGod does not require us, as we assemble for His worship, to make\nthese seasons tedious and wearisome by remaining bowed quite a\nlength of time, listening to several long prayers. Those in feeble\nhealth cannot endure this taxation without extreme weariness and\nexhaustion. The body becomes weary by remaining bowed down\nso long; and what is worse still, the mind becomes so wearied by\nthe continuous exercise of prayer that no spiritual refreshment is\nrealized, and the meeting is to them worse than a loss. They have\nbecome wearied mentally and physically, and they have obtained no\nspiritual strength.\nMeetings for conference and prayer should not be made tedious.\nIf possible, all should be prompt to the hour appointed; and if there\nare dilatory ones, who are half an hour or even fifteen minutes\nbehind the time, there should be no waiting. If there are but two\npresent, they can claim the promise. The meeting should open at the[578]\nappointed hour if possible, be there few or many present. Formality\nand cold stiffness should be laid aside, and all should be prompt\nto duty. Upon common occasions there should not be prayer of\nmore than ten minutes\u2019 duration. After there has been a change of\nposition, and the exercise of singing or exhortation has relieved the\nsameness, then, if any feel the burden of prayer, let them pray.\nAll should feel it a Christian duty to pray short. Tell the Lord just\nwhat you want, without going all over the world. In private prayer\nall have the privilege of praying as long as they desire and of being\nas explicit as they please. They can pray for all their relatives and\nfriends. The closet is the place to tell all their private difficulties,\n508\nSocial Meetings 509\nand trials, and temptations. A common meeting to worship God is\nnot the place to open the privacies of the heart.\nWhat is the object of assembling together? Is it to inform God,\nto instruct Him by telling Him all we know in prayer? We meet\ntogether to edify one another by an interchange of thoughts and\nfeelings, to gather strength, and light, and courage by becoming\nacquainted with one another\u2019s hopes and aspirations; and by our\nearnest, heartfelt prayers, offered up in faith, we receive refreshment\nand vigor from the Source of our strength. These meetings should\nbe most precious seasons and should be made interesting to all who\nhave any relish for religious things.\nThere are some, I fear, who do not take their troubles to God in\nprivate prayer, but reserve them for the prayer meeting, and there do\nup their praying for several days. Such may be named conference\nand prayer meeting killers. They emit no light; they edify no one.\nTheir cold, frozen prayers and long, backslidden testimonies cast\na shadow. All are glad when they get through, and it is almost\nimpossible to throw off the chill and darkness which their prayers\nand exhortations bring into the meeting. From the light which I have [579]\nreceived, our meetings should be spiritual and social, and not too\nlong. Reserve, pride, vanity, and fear of man should be left at home.\nLittle differences and prejudices should not be taken with us to these\nmeetings. As in a united family, simplicity, meekness, confidence,\nand love should exist in the hearts of brethren and sisters who meet\nto be refreshed and invigorated by bringing their lights together.\n\u201cYe are the light of the world,\u201d says the heavenly Teacher. All\nhave not the same experience in their religious life. But those of\ndiverse exercises come together and with simplicity and humbleness\nof mind talk out their experience. All who are pursuing the onward\nChristian course should have, and will have, an experience that is\nliving, that is new and interesting. A living experience is made up of\ndaily trials, conflicts, and temptations, strong efforts and victories,\nand great peace and joy gained through Jesus. A simple relation\nof such experiences gives light, strength, and knowledge that will\naid others in their advancement in the divine life. The worship of\nGod should be both interesting and instructive to those who have\nany love for divine and heavenly things.\n510 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nJesus, the heavenly Teacher, did not hold Himself aloof from\nthe children of men; but in order to benefit them He came from\nheaven to earth, where they were, that the purity and holiness of\nHis life might shine upon the pathway of all and light the way to\nheaven. The Redeemer of the world sought to make His lessons\nof instruction plain and simple, that all might comprehend them.\nHe generally chose the open air for His discourses. No walls could\nenclose the multitude which followed Him; but He had special\nreasons for resorting to the groves and the seaside to give His lessons\nof instruction. He could there have a commanding view of the\nlandscape and make use of objects and scenes with which those\nin humble life were familiar, to illustrate the important truths He[580]\nmade known to them. With His lessons of instruction He associated\nthe works of God in nature. The birds which were caroling forth\ntheir songs without a care, the flowers of the valley glowing in their\nbeauty, the lily that reposed in its purity upon the bosom of the\nlake, the lofty trees, the cultivated land, the waving grain, the barren\nsoil, the tree that bore no fruit, the everlasting hills, the bubbling\nstream, the setting sun, tinting and gilding the heavens\u2014all these\nHe employed to impress His hearers with divine truth. He connected\nthe works of God\u2019s finger in the heavens and upon the earth with the\nwords of life He wished to impress upon their minds, that, as they\nshould look upon the wonderful works of God in nature, His lessons\nmight be fresh in their memories.\nIn all His efforts Christ sought to make His teachings interesting.\nHe knew that a tired, hungry throng could not receive spiritual\nbenefit, and He did not forget their bodily needs. Upon one occasion\nHe wrought a miracle to feed five thousand who had gathered to\nlisten to the words of life which fell from His lips. Jesus regarded His\nsurroundings when giving His precious truth to the multitude. The\nscenery was such as would attract the eye and awaken admiration in\nthe breasts of the lovers of the beautiful. He could extol the wisdom\nof God in His creative works, and could bind up His sacred lessons\nby directing their minds through nature up to nature\u2019s God.\nThus the landscape, the trees, the birds, the flowers of the valley,\nthe hills, the lake, and the beautiful heavens were associated in\ntheir minds with sacred truths which would make them hallowed in\nSocial Meetings 511\nmemory as they should look upon them after Christ\u2019s ascension to\nheaven.\nWhen Christ taught the people, He did not devote the time to\nprayer. He did not enforce upon them, as did the Pharisees, long,\ntedious ceremonies and prayers. He taught His disciples how to pray: [581]\n\u201cAnd when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for\nthey love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of\nthe streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They\nhave their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet,\nand when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in\nsecret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\nBut when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for\nthey think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not\nye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye\nhave need of, before ye ask Him. After this manner therefore pray\nye.\u201d\nChrist impressed upon His disciples the idea that their prayers\nshould be short, expressing just what they wanted, and no more.\nHe gives the length and substance of their prayers, expressing their\ndesires for temporal and spiritual blessings, and their gratitude for the\nsame. How comprehensive this sample prayer! It covers the actual\nneed of all. One or two minutes is long enough for any ordinary\nprayer. There may be instances where prayer is in a special manner\nindited by the Spirit of God, where supplication is made in the Spirit.\nThe yearning soul becomes agonized and groans after God. The\nspirit wrestles as did Jacob and will not be at rest without special\nmanifestations of the power of God. This is as God would have it.\nBut many offer prayer in a dry, sermonizing manner. These pray\nto men, not to God. If they were praying to God, and really under-\nstood what they were doing, they would be alarmed at their audacity;\nfor they deliver a discourse to the Lord in the mode of prayer, as\nthough the Creator of the universe needed special information upon\ngeneral questions in relation to things transpiring in the world. All\nsuch prayers are as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. They are\nmade no account of in heaven. Angels of God are wearied with\nthem, as well as mortals who are compelled to listen to them. [582]\nJesus was often found in prayer. He resorted to the lonely groves\nor to the mountains to make His requests known to His Father.\n512 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nWhen the business and cares of the day were ended, and the weary\nwere seeking rest, Jesus devoted the time to prayer. We would not\ndiscourage prayer, for there is far too little praying and watching\nthereunto. And there is still less praying with the Spirit and the\nunderstanding also. Fervent and effectual prayer is always in place,\nand will never weary. Such prayer interests and refreshes all who\nhave a love for devotion.\nSecret prayer is neglected, and this is why many offer such long,\ntedious, backslidden prayers when they assemble to worship God.\nThey go over in their prayers a week of neglected duties, and pray\nround and round, hoping to make up for their neglect and pacify their\ncondemned consciences, which are scourging them. They hope to\npray themselves into the favor of God. But frequently these prayers\nresult in bringing other minds down to their own low level in spiritual\ndarkness. If Christians would take home the teachings of Christ in\nregard to watching and praying, they would become more intelligent\nin their worship of God.\n* * * * *\nChapter 71\u2014How Shall We keep the Sabbath?\nGod is merciful. His requirements are reasonable, in accordance\nwith the goodness and benevolence of His character. The object of\nthe Sabbath was that all mankind might be benefited. Man was not\nmade to fit the Sabbath; for the Sabbath was made after the creation\nof man, to meet his necessities. After God had made the world in\nsix days, He rested and sanctified and blessed the day upon which\nHe rested from all His work which He had created and made. He [583]\nset apart that special day for man to rest from his labor, that, as\nhe should look upon the earth beneath and the heavens above, he\nmight reflect that God made all these in six days and rested upon the\nseventh; and that, as he should behold the tangible proofs of God\u2019s\ninfinite wisdom, his heart might be filled with love and reverence\nfor his Maker.\nIn order to keep the Sabbath holy, it is not necessary that we\nenclose ourselves in walls, shut away from the beautiful scenes of\nnature and from the free, invigorating air of heaven. We should in\nno case allow burdens and business transactions to divert our minds\nupon the Sabbath of the Lord, which He has sanctified. We should\nnot allow our minds to dwell upon things of a worldly character\neven. But the mind cannot be refreshed, enlivened, and elevated by\nbeing confined nearly all the Sabbath hours within walls, listening\nto long sermons and tedious, formal prayers. The Sabbath of the\nLord is put to a wrong use if thus celebrated. The object for which\nit was instituted is not attained. The Sabbath was made for man,\nto be a blessing to him by calling his mind from secular labor to\ncontemplate the goodness and glory of God. It is necessary that the\npeople of God assemble to talk of Him, to interchange thoughts and\nideas in regard to the truths contained in His word, and to devote a\nportion of time to appropriate prayer. But these seasons, even upon\nthe Sabbath, should not be made tedious by their length and lack of\ninterest.\n513\n514 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nDuring a portion of the day, all should have an opportunity to be\nout of doors. How can children receive a more correct knowledge\nof God, and their minds be better impressed, than in spending a\nportion of their time out of doors, not in play, but in company with\ntheir parents? Let their young minds be associated with God in\nthe beautiful scenery of nature, let their attention be called to the\ntokens of His love to man in His created works, and they will be[584]\nattracted and interested. They will not be in danger of associating the\ncharacter of God with everything that is stern and severe; but as they\nview the beautiful things which He has created for the happiness of\nman, they will be led to regard Him as a tender, loving Father. They\nwill see that His prohibitions and injunctions are not made merely\nto show His power and authority, but that He has the happiness of\nHis children in view. As the character of God puts on the aspect\nof love, benevolence, beauty, and attraction, they are drawn to love\nHim. You can direct their minds to the lovely birds making the\nair musical with their happy songs, to the spires of grass, and the\ngloriously tinted flowers in their perfection perfuming the air. All\nthese proclaim the love and skill of the heavenly Artist, and show\nforth the glory of God.\nParents, why not make use of the precious lessons which God\nhas given us in the book of nature, to give our children a correct\nidea of His character? Those who sacrifice simplicity to fashion,\nand shut themselves away from the beauties of nature, cannot be\nspiritually minded. They cannot understand the skill and power of\nGod as revealed in His created works; therefore their hearts do not\nquicken and throb with new love and interest, and they are not filled\nwith awe and reverence as they see God in nature.\nAll who love God should do what they can to make the Sabbath\na delight, holy and honorable. They cannot do this by seeking their\nown pleasure in sinful, forbidden amusements. Yet they can do\nmuch to exalt the Sabbath in their families and make it the most\ninteresting day of the week. We should devote time to interesting\nour children. A change will have a happy influence upon them. We\ncan walk out with them in the open air; we can sit with them in\nthe groves and in the bright sunshine, and give their restless minds\nsomething to feed upon by conversing with them upon the works of[585]\nHow Shall We keep the Sabbath? 515\nGod, and can inspire them with love and reverence by calling their\nattention to the beautiful objects in nature.\nThe Sabbath should be made so interesting to our families that its\nweekly return will be hailed with joy. In no better way can parents\nexalt and honor the Sabbath than by devising means to impart proper\ninstruction to their families and interesting them in spiritual things,\ngiving them correct views of the character of God and what He\nrequires of us in order to perfect Christian characters and attain to\neternal life. Parents, make the Sabbath a delight, that your children\nmay look forward to it and have a welcome in their hearts for it.\n* * * * *\nChapter 72\u2014Christian Recreation\n[Reported as spoken before a company of about two hundred\nwho were enjoying a season of recreation at Goguac Lake, near\nBattle Creek, Michigan, May, 1870.]\nI have been thinking what a contrast would be seen between\nour gathering here today and such gatherings as they are generally\nconducted by unbelievers. Instead of prayer, and the mention of\nChrist and religious things, would be heard silly laughter and trifling\nconversation. Their object would be to have a general high time. It\nwould commence in folly and end in vanity. We want to have these\ngatherings so conducted, and to so conduct ourselves, that we can\nreturn to our homes with a conscience void of offense toward God\nand man; a consciousness that we have not wounded nor injured in\nany manner those with whom we have associated, or had an injurious\ninfluence over them.\nHere is where very many fail. They do not consider that they are[586]\naccountable for the influence they daily exert; that they must render\nan account to God for the impressions they make, and the influence\nthey cast, in all their associations in life. If this influence is such as\nshall have a tendency to draw the minds of others away from God\nand attract them into the channel of vanity and folly, leading them\nto seek their own pleasure in amusements and foolish indulgences,\nthey must give an account for this. And if these persons are men and\nwomen of influence, if their position is such that their example will\naffect others, then a greater sin will rest upon them for neglecting to\nregulate their conduct by the Bible standard.\nThe occasion we are enjoying today is just according to my ideas\nof recreation. I have tried to give my views upon this subject, but\nthey are better illustrated than expressed. I was on this ground about\none year ago when there was a gathering similar to this. Nearly\neverything passed off very pleasantly then, but still some things\nwere objectionable. Considerable jesting and joking were indulged\n516\nChristian Recreation 517\nin by some. All were not Sabbathkeepers, and an influence was\nmanifest that was not as pleasant as we could wish.\nBut I believe that, while we are seeking to refresh our spirits and\ninvigorate our bodies, we are required of God to use all our powers\nat all times to the best purpose. We may associate together as we\ndo here today, and do all to the glory of God. We can and should\nconduct our recreations in such a manner that we shall be fitted for\nthe more successful discharge of the duties devolving upon us, and\nthat our influence shall be more beneficial upon those with whom\nwe associate. Especially should it be the case upon an occasion like\nthis, which should be of good cheer to us all. We can return to our\nhomes improved in mind and refreshed in body, and prepared to\nengage in the work anew, with better hope and better courage.\nWe believe that it is our privilege every day of our lives to glorify [587]\nGod upon the earth; that we are not to live in this world merely for\nour own amusement, merely to please ourselves. We are here to\nbenefit humanity, to be a blessing to society. And if we should let\nour minds run in that low channel in which many who are seeking\nonly vanity and folly permit their minds to run, how could we be a\nblessing to society, a benefit to our race and generation? We cannot\ninnocently indulge in any amusement which will unfit us for the\nmore faithful discharge of ordinary life duties.\nWe want to seek the elevated and lovely. We want to direct the\nmind away from those things that are superficial and of no impor-\ntance, that have no solidity. What we desire is, to be gathering new\nstrength from all that we engage in. From all these gatherings for\nthe purpose of recreation, from all these pleasant associations, we\nwant to be gathering new strength to become better men and women.\nFrom every source possible we want to gather new courage, new\nstrength, new power, that we may elevate our lives to purity and\nholiness, and not come down upon the low level of this world. We\nhear many who profess the religion of Christ speak often like this:\n\u201cWe must all come down upon a level.\u201d There is no such thing as\nChristians coming down upon a level. To embrace the truth of God\nand the religion of the Bible is not coming down, it is coming up\nupon an elevated level, a higher standpoint, where we may commune\nwith God.\n518 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nFor this very reason Christ humbled Himself to take upon Him\nour nature, that by His own humiliation and suffering and sacrifice\nHe might become a steppingstone to fallen men, that they might\nclimb up upon His merits, and that through His excellence and virtue\ntheir efforts to keep God\u2019s law might be accepted of Him. There is\nno such thing here as coming down upon a level. We are seeking to\nplant our feet upon the elevated and exalted platform of eternal truth.[588]\nWe are seeking to become more like the heavenly angels, more pure\nin heart, more sinless, harmless, and undefiled.\nWe are seeking for purity and holiness of life, that we may at\nlast be fitted for the heavenly society in the kingdom of glory; and\nthe only means to attain this elevation of Christian character is\nthrough Jesus Christ. There is no other way for the exaltation of the\nhuman family. Some talk of the humiliation they endure and the\nsacrifice they make, because they adopt the truth of heavenly origin!\nIt is true that the world do not accept the truth; unbelievers do not\nreceive it. They may talk of those that have embraced the truth and\nsought the Saviour, and represent them as leaving everything, giving\nup everything, and making a sacrifice of everything that is worth\nretaining. But do not tell me this. I know better. My experience\nproves it to be otherwise. You need not tell me that we have to give\nup our dearest treasures and receive no equivalent. No, indeed! That\nCreator who planted the beautiful Eden for our first parents, and\nwho has planted for us the lovely trees and flowers, and provided\neverything that is beautiful and glorious in nature for the human race\nto enjoy, designed that they should enjoy it. Then do not think that\nGod wishes us to yield up everything which it is for our happiness\nhere to retain. He requires us to give up only that which it would not\nbe for our good and happiness to retain.\nThat God who has planted these noble trees and clothed them\nwith their rich foliage, who has given us the brilliant and beautiful\nshades of the flowers, and whose lovely handiwork we see in all the\nrealm of nature, does not design to make us unhappy; He does not\ndesign that we shall have no taste for, and take no pleasure in, these\nthings. It is His design that we shall enjoy them and be happy in the\ncharms of nature, which are of His own creating.\nIt is right that we should choose such places as this grove for[589]\nseasons of relaxation and recreation. But while we are here it is not\nChristian Recreation 519\nto devote our attention to ourselves merely, and fritter away precious\ntime in amusements which will encourage a disrelish for sacred\nthings. We have not come here to indulge in jesting and joking, in\nfoolish talk and senseless laughter. We here behold the beauties of\nnature. And what then? Shall we fall down and worship them? No,\nindeed. But as we behold these works of nature we should let the\nmind be carried up higher, to nature\u2019s God; let it be elevated to the\nCreator of the universe, and then adore the Creator who has made\nall these beautiful things for our benefit and happiness.\nMany delight in lovely paintings and are ready to worship the\ntalent which can produce a beautiful drawing, but where do those\nwho devote their lives to this work obtain their designs? where\ndo the artists get their ideas of things to put upon canvass? From\nnature\u2019s beautiful scenery\u2014from nature, only from nature. Individ-\nuals devote the entire strength of their being, and bestow all their\naffections, upon their tastes in this direction. Many withdraw their\nminds from the beauties and glories of nature that our Creator has\nprepared for them to enjoy, and devote all the powers of their being\nto perfection of art; yet all these things are only imperfect copies\nfrom nature. Art can never attain the perfection seen in nature.\nThe Maker of all the beautiful things of nature is forgotten. I\nhave seen many who would go into ecstasies over a picture of a\nsunset, while at the same time they could have the privilege of\nseeing an actual and glorious sunset almost every evening in the\nyear. They can see the beautiful tints in which nature\u2019s invisible\nMaster Artist has with divine skill painted glorious scenes on the\nshifting canvass of the heavens, and yet they carelessly turn from\nthe Heaven-wrought picture to paintings of art, traced by imperfect\nfingers, and almost fall down and worship them. What is the reason [590]\nof this? It is because the enemy is almost constantly seeking to\ndivert the mind from God. When we present God and the religion of\nChrist, will they receive them? No, indeed. They cannot accept of\nChrist. What! they make the sacrifice they would have to make to\nreceive Him? Not at all! But what is required? Simply the heart\u2019s\nbest and holiest affections for Him who left the glory of the Father\nand came down to die for a race of rebels. He left His riches, His\nmajesty, and His high command, and took upon Himself our nature,\nthat He might make a way of escape\u2014to do what? to humiliate you?\n520 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nto degrade you? No, indeed. To make a way of escape for you from\nhopeless misery, to elevate you at last to His own right hand in His\nkingdom. For this the great, the immense, sacrifice was made. And\nwho can realize this great sacrifice? Who can appreciate it? None\nbut those who understand the mystery of godliness, who have tasted\nthe powers of the world to come, who have drunk from the cup of\nsalvation that has been presented to us. This cup of salvation the\nLord offers us, while with His own lips He drained, in our stead, the\nbitter cup which our sins had prepared, and which was apportioned\nfor us to drink. Yet we talk as though Christ, who has made such\na sacrifice, and manifested such love for us, would deprive us of\neverything that is worth having.\nOf what good would He deprive us? He would deprive us of the\nprivilege of giving up to the natural passions of the carnal heart. We\ncannot get angry just when we please, and retain a clear conscience\nand the approval of God. But are we not willing to give this up?\nWill the indulgence of corrupt passions make us any happier? It is\nbecause it will not that restrictions are laid upon us in this respect. It\nwill not add to our enjoyment to get angry and cultivate a perverse\ntemper. It is not for our happiness to follow the leadings of the\nnatural heart. And shall we be made better by indulging them?[591]\nNo; they will cast a shadow in our households and throw a pall\nover our happiness. Giving way to the natural appetites will only\ninjure the constitution and tear the system to pieces. Therefore God\nwould have us restrict the appetite, control the passions, and hold in\nsubjection the entire man. And He has promised to give us strength\nif we will engage in this work.\nThe sin of Adam and Eve caused a fearful separation between\nGod and man. And Christ steps in between fallen man and God,\nand says to man: \u201cYou may yet come to the Father; there is a plan\ndevised through which God can be reconciled to man, and man\nto God; through a mediator you can approach God.\u201d And now He\nstands to mediate for you. He is the great High Priest who is pleading\nin your behalf; and you are to come and present your case to the\nFather through Jesus Christ. Thus you can find access to God; and\nthough you sin, your case is not hopeless. \u201cIf any man sin, we have\nan advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.\u201d\nChristian Recreation 521\nI thank God that we have a Saviour. And there is no way whereby\nwe can be exalted, except through Christ. Then let no one think that\nit is a great humiliation on his part to accept of Christ; for when we\ntake that step we take hold of the golden cord that links finite man\nwith the infinite God; we take the first step toward true exaltation,\nthat we may be fitted for the society of pure and heavenly angels in\nthe kingdom of glory.\nBe not discouraged; be not fainthearted. Although you may have\ntemptations, although you may be beset by the wily foe, yet if you\nhave the fear of God before you, angels that excel in strength will be\nsent to your help, and you can be more than a match for the powers\nof darkness. Jesus lives. He died to make a way of escape for the\nfallen race, and He lives today to make intercession for us, that we [592]\nmay be exalted to His own right hand. Hope in God. The world\nis traveling the broad way; and as you travel in the narrow way,\nand have to contend with principalities and powers, and to meet the\nopposition of foes, remember that provision has been made for you.\nHelp has been laid upon One that is mighty, and through Him you\ncan conquer.\nCome out from among them, and be separate, saith the Lord,\nand I will receive you, and ye shall be sons and daughters of the\nLord Almighty. What a promise is this! It is a pledge to you that\nyou shall become members of the royal family, heirs of the heavenly\nkingdom. If a person is honored by, or becomes connected with, any\nof the monarchs of earth, how it goes the rounds of the periodicals\nof the day and excites the envy of those who think themselves less\nfortunate. But here is One who is King over all, the monarch of the\nuniverse, the Originator of every good thing; and He says to us: I\nwill make you My sons and daughters; I will unite you to Myself;\nyou shall become members of the royal family and children of the\nheavenly King.\nSays Paul: \u201cHaving therefore these promises, dearly beloved,\nlet us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,\nperfecting holiness in the fear of God.\u201d Why should we not do\nthis, when we have such an inducement, the privilege of becoming\nchildren of the Most High, the privilege of calling the God of heaven\nour Father? Is not that enough? And do you call this depriving you\nof everything that is worth having? Is this giving up everything that\n522 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nis worth possessing? Let me be united to God and holy angels, for\nthis is my highest ambition. You may have all the possessions of\nthis world; but I must have Jesus; I must have a right to the immortal\ninheritance, the eternal substance. Let me enjoy the beauties of the\nkingdom of God. Let me delight in the paintings which His own\nfingers have colored. I may enjoy them. You may enjoy them. We[593]\nmay not worship them, but through them we may be directed to Him\nand behold His glory who made all these things for our enjoyment.\nAgain I say: Be of good courage. Trust in the Lord. Let not the\nenemy rob you of the promises. If you have separated yourselves\nfrom the world, God has said that He will be your Father, and you\nshall be His sons and daughters. Is not that enough? What greater\ninducement could be presented before you? Is there any great object\nin being a butterfly and having no substance or aim in life? Oh! let\nme stand on the platform of eternal truth. Give me immortal worth.\nLet me grasp the golden chain that is let down from heaven to earth,\nand let it draw me up to God and glory. This is my ambition; this\nis my aim. If others have no higher object than dress, if they can\ndelight in outward display and satisfy their souls with bows and\nribbons and fantastic things, let them enjoy these. But let me have\nthe inward adorning. Let me be clothed with that meek and quiet\nspirit which is in the sight of God of great price. And I recommend\nit to you, young gentlemen and ladies, for it is more precious in His\nsight than the gold of Ophir. It is this which makes a man more\nprecious than fine gold, even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.\nMy sisters, and you young people, it will make you more precious\nin the sight of Heaven than fine gold, yea, than the golden wedge\nof Ophir. I recommend to you Jesus, my blessed Saviour. I adore\nHim; I magnify Him. Oh, that I had an immortal tongue, that I\ncould praise Him as I desire! that I could stand before the assembled\nuniverse and speak in praise of His matchless charms!\nAnd while I adore and magnify Him, I want you to magnify\nHim with me. Praise the Lord even when you fall into darkness.\nPraise Him even in temptation. \u201cRejoice in the Lord alway,\u201d says\nthe apostle; \u201cand again I say, Rejoice.\u201d Will that bring gloom and\ndarkness into your families? No, indeed; it will bring a sunbeam.[594]\nYou will thus gather rays of eternal light from the throne of glory\nand scatter them around you. Let me exhort you to engage in this\nChristian Recreation 523\nwork, scatter this light and life around you, not only in your own\npath, but in the paths of those with whom you associate. Let it be\nyour object to make those around you better, to elevate them, to\npoint them to heaven and glory, and lead them to seek, above all\nearthly things, the eternal substance, the immortal inheritance, the\nriches which are imperishable.\n* * * * *\nChapter 73\u2014An Impressive Dream\nWhile at Battle Creek in August, 1868, I dreamed of being with a\nlarge body of people. A portion of this assembly started out prepared\nto journey. We had heavily loaded wagons. As we journeyed, the\nroad seemed to ascend. On one side of this road was a deep precipice;\non the other was a high, smooth, white wall, like the hard finish\nupon plastered rooms.\nAs we journeyed on, the road grew narrower and steeper. In\nsome places it seemed so very narrow that we concluded that we\ncould no longer travel with the loaded wagons. We then loosed them\nfrom the horses, took a portion of the luggage from the wagons and\nplaced it upon the horses, and journeyed on horseback.\nAs we progressed, the path still continued to grow narrow. We\nwere obliged to press close to the wall, to save ourselves from falling\noff the narrow road down the steep precipice. As we did this, the\nluggage on the horses pressed against the wall and caused us to sway\ntoward the precipice. We feared that we should fall and be dashed in\npieces on the rocks. We then cut the luggage from the horses, and it\nfell over the precipice. We continued on horseback, greatly fearing,\nas we came to the narrower places in the road, that we should lose[595]\nour balance and fall. At such times a hand seemed to take the bridle\nand guide us over the perilous way.\nAs the path grew more narrow, we decided that we could no\nlonger go with safety on horseback, and we left the horses and went\non foot, in single file, one following in the footsteps of another. At\nthis point small cords were let down from the top of the pure white\nwall; these we eagerly grasped, to aid us in keeping our balance\nupon the path. As we traveled, the cord moved along with us. The\npath finally became so narrow that we concluded that we could travel\nmore safely without our shoes, so we slipped them from our feet and\nwent on some distance without them. Soon it was decided that we\ncould travel more safely without our stockings; these were removed,\nand we journeyed on with bare feet.\n524\nImpressive Dream 525\nWe then thought of those who had not accustomed themselves\nto privations and hardships. Where were such now? They were not\nin the company. At every change some were left behind, and those\nonly remained who had accustomed themselves to endure hardships.\nThe privations of the way only made these more eager to press on to\nthe end.\nOur danger of falling from the pathway increased. We pressed\nclose to the white wall, yet could not place our feet fully upon the\npath, for it was too narrow. We then suspended nearly our whole\nweight upon the cords, exclaiming: \u201cWe have hold from above!\nWe have hold from above!\u201d The same words were uttered by all\nthe company in the narrow pathway. As we heard the sounds of\nmirth and revelry that seemed to come from the abyss below, we\nshuddered. We heard the profane oath, the vulgar jest, and low,\nvile songs. We heard the war song and the dance song. We heard\ninstrumental music and loud laughter, mingled with cursing and\ncries of anguish and bitter wailing, and were more anxious than ever [596]\nto keep upon the narrow, difficult pathway. Much of the time we\nwere compelled to suspend our whole weight upon the cords, which\nincreased in size as we progressed.\nI noticed that the beautiful white wall was stained with blood. It\ncaused a feeling of regret to see the wall thus stained. This feeling,\nhowever, lasted but for a moment, as I soon thought that it was all as\nit should be. Those who are following after will know that others\nhave passed the narrow, difficult way before them, and will conclude\nthat if others were able to pursue their onward course, they can do\nthe same. And as the blood shall be pressed from their aching feet,\nthey will not faint with discouragement; but, seeing the blood upon\nthe wall, they will know that others have endured the same pain.\nAt length we came to a large chasm, at which our path ended.\nThere was nothing now to guide the feet, nothing upon which to\nrest them. Our whole reliance must be upon the cords, which had\nincreased in size until they were as large as our bodies. Here we\nwere for a time thrown into perplexity and distress. We inquired in\nfearful whispers: \u201cTo what is the cord attached?\u201d My husband was\njust before me. Large drops of sweat were falling from his brow,\nthe veins in his neck and temples were increased to double their\nusual size, and suppressed, agonizing groans came from his lips.\n526 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nThe sweat was dropping from my face, and I felt such anguish as I\nhad never felt before. A fearful struggle was before us. Should we\nfail here, all the difficulties of our journey had been experienced for\nnought.\nBefore us, on the other side of the chasm, was a beautiful field\nof green grass, about six inches high. I could not see the sun; but\nbright, soft beams of light, resembling fine gold and silver, were\nresting upon this field. Nothing I had seen upon earth could compare\nin beauty and glory with this field. But could we succeed in reaching\nit? was the anxious inquiry. Should the cord break, we must perish.\nAgain, in whispered anguish, the words were breathed: \u201cWhat[597]\nholds the cord?\u201d For a moment we hesitated to venture. Then we\nexclaimed: \u201cOur only hope is to trust wholly to the cord. It has been\nour dependence all the difficult way. It will not fail us now.\u201d Still we\nwere hesitating and distressed. The words were then spoken: \u201cGod\nholds the cord. We need not fear.\u201d These words were then repeated\nby those behind us, accompanied with: \u201cHe will not fail us now. He\nhas brought us thus far in safety.\u201d\nMy husband then swung himself over the fearful abyss into the\nbeautiful field beyond. I immediately followed. And, oh, what a\nsense of relief and gratitude to God we felt! I heard voices raised in\ntriumphant praise to God. I was happy, perfectly happy.\nI awoke, and found that from the anxiety I had experienced in\npassing over the difficult route, every nerve in my body seemed to\nbe in a tremor. This dream needs no comment. It made such an\nimpression upon my mind that probably every item in it will be vivid\nbefore me while my memory shall continue.\n* * * * *\nChapter 74\u2014Our Camp Meetings\nThere can be no influence so detrimental to a camp meeting,\nor any other gathering for religious worship, as much visiting and\ncareless conversation. Frequently men and women assemble in com-\npanies, and engage in conversation upon common subjects which\ndo not relate to the meeting. Some have brought their farms with\nthem, others have brought their houses, and are laying their plans for\nbuilding. Some are dissecting the characters of others and have no\ntime or disposition to search their own hearts, to discover the defects\nin their own characters, that they may correct their wrongs and per- [598]\nfect holiness in the fear of God. If all who profess to be followers of\nChrist would improve the time out of meeting in conversing upon the\ntruth, in dwelling upon the Christian\u2019s hope, in searching their own\nhearts, and in earnest prayer before God, pleading for His blessing,\na much greater work would be accomplished than we have yet seen.\nUnbelievers, who falsely accuse those who believe the truth, would\nbe convinced because of their \u201cgood conversation in Christ.\u201d Our\nwords and actions are the fruit we bear; \u201cwherefore by their fruits\nye shall know them.\u201d\nGod gave direction to the Israelites to assemble before Him at\nset periods in the place which He should choose, and observe special\ndays, wherein no unnecessary work was to be done, but the time\nwas to be devoted to a consideration of the blessings which He\nhad bestowed upon them. At these special seasons the manservant\nand maidservant, the stranger, the fatherless and widow\u2014all were\ndirected to rejoice that God had by His own wonderful power brought\nthem from servile bondage to the enjoyment of freedom. And they\nwere commanded not to appear before the Lord empty-handed. They\nwere to bring tokens of their gratitude to God for His continual\nmercies and blessings bestowed upon them; they were to bring\ngifts, freewill offerings and thank offerings unto the Lord, as He\nhad blessed them. These offerings were varied according to the\ndonor\u2019s estimate of the blessings which he was privileged to enjoy.\n527\n528 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nThus the characters of the people were plainly developed. Those\nwho placed a high value upon the blessings which God bestowed\nupon them brought offerings in accordance with this appreciation\nof His blessings. Those whose moral powers were stupefied and\nbenumbed by selfishness and idolatrous love of the favors received,\nrather than inspired by fervent love for their bountiful Benefactor,\nbrought meager offerings. Thus their hearts were revealed. Besides[599]\nthese special religious feast days of gladness and rejoicing, the\nyearly Passover was to be commemorated by the Jewish nation. The\nLord covenanted that, if they were faithful in the observance of His\nrequirements, He would bless them in all their increase, and in all\nthe works of their hands.\nGod requires no less of His people in these last days, in sacrifices\nand offerings, than He did of the Jewish nation. Those whom He has\nblessed with a competency, and even the widow and the fatherless,\nshould not be unmindful of His blessings. Especially should those\nwhom He has prospered render to Him the things that are His. They\nshould appear before Him with a spirit of self-sacrifice and bring\ntheir offerings in accordance with the blessings He has bestowed\nupon them. But many whom God prospers manifest base ingratitude\nto Him. If His blessings rest upon them, and He increases their\nsubstance, they use these bounties as cords to bind them to the love\nof their possessions; they allow worldly business to take possession\nof their affections and of their entire being, and neglect devotion and\nreligious privileges. They cannot afford to leave their business cares\nand come before God even once a year. They turn the blessings\nof God into a curse by serving their own temporal interests to the\nneglect of His requirements.\nMen who possess thousands remain at home year after year,\nengrossed in their worldly cares and interests, and feel that they\ncannot afford to make the small sacrifice of attending the yearly\ngatherings to worship God. He has blessed them in basket and in\nstore, and surrounded them with His benefits on the right hand and\non the left; yet they withhold from Him the small offerings which\nHe requires of them. They love to serve themselves. Their souls will\nbe like the unrefreshed desert, without the dew or rain of heaven.\nThe Lord has brought to them the precious blessing of His grace;\nHe has delivered them from the slavery of sin and the bondage of[600]\nOur Camp Meetings 529\nerror, and has opened to their darkened understandings the glorious\nlight of present truth. And shall these evidences of His love and\nmercy call forth no gratitude in return? Will those who profess to\nbelieve that the end of all things is at hand be blind to their own\nspiritual interests, and live for this world and this life alone? Do\nthey expect their eternal interest to take care of itself? They cannot\nobtain spiritual strength without an effort on their part.\nMany who profess to be looking for the appearing of our Lord\nare anxious, burdened seekers for worldly gain. They are blind\nto their eternal interest. They labor for that which satisfieth not;\nthey spend their money for that which is not bread. They strive\nto content themselves with the treasures they have laid up upon\nthe earth, which must perish, and they neglect the preparation for\neternity, which should be the first and only real work of their lives.\nLet all who possibly can, attend these yearly gatherings. All\nshould feel that God requires this of them. If they do not avail\nthemselves of the privileges which He has provided for them to\nbecome strong in Him and in the power of His grace, they will grow\nweaker and weaker, and have less and less desire to consecrate all\nto Him. Come, brethren and sisters, to these sacred convocation\nmeetings, to find Jesus. He will come up to the feast; He will be\npresent, and will do for you that which you need most to have done.\nYour farms should not be considered of greater value than the higher\ninterests of the soul. All the treasures you possess, be they ever\nso valuable, would not be rich enough to buy you peace and hope,\nwhich would be infinite gain at the cost of all you have and the toils\nand sufferings of a lifetime. A strong, clear sense of eternal things,\nand a heart willing to yield all to Christ, are blessings of more value\nthan all the riches and pleasures and glories of this world.\nThese camp meetings are of importance. They cost something. [601]\nThe servants of God are wearing out their lives to help the people,\nwhile many of them appear as if they did not want help. For fear of\nlosing a little of this world\u2019s gain, some let these precious privileges\ncome and go as though they were of but very little importance. Let\nall who profess to believe the truth respect every privilege that God\noffers them to obtain clearer views of His truth and His requirements,\nand the necessary preparation for His coming. A calm, cheerful, and\nobedient trust in God is what He requires.\n530 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nYou need not weary yourselves with busy anxieties and needless\ncares. Work on for the day, faithfully doing the work which God\u2019s\nprovidence assigns you, and He will have a care for you. Jesus will\ndeepen and widen your blessings. You must make efforts if you have\nsalvation at last. Come to these meetings prepared to work. Leave\nyour home cares, and come to find Jesus, and He will be found of\nyou. Come with your offerings as God has blessed you. Show your\ngratitude to your Creator, the Giver of all your benefits, by a freewill\noffering. Let none who are able to give come empty-handed. \u201cBring\nye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in Mine\nhouse, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will\nnot open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing,\nthat there shall not be room enough to receive it.\nThe object of a camp meeting is to lead all to separate from\nbusiness cares and burdens, and devote a few days exclusively to\nseeking the Lord. We should occupy the time in self-examination,\nclose searching of heart, penitential confession of sins, and renewing\nour vows to the Most High. If any come to these meetings for less\nworthy objects, we hope the character of the meetings will be such\nas to bring their minds to the proper objects.\nSome are sufferers through extra labor in preparing for camp[602]\nmeeting. They are liberal-souled people, and want nothing done\nwith stinginess. Some make large provisions and are thoroughly\nwearied out when they come to the meeting, and as soon as they are\nreleased from the pressure of work, exhausted nature causes them\nto feel that she has been abused. Some of these persons may never\nhave attended a camp meeting before and are not informed in regard\nto what preparations they are required to make. They lose some\nof the precious meetings they had purposed to attend. Now these\nmistake in making so great preparation. Nothing should be taken to\ncamp meeting except the most healthful articles, cooked in a simple\nmanner, free from all spices and grease.\nI am convinced that none need to make themselves sick preparing\nfor camp meeting, if they observe the laws of health in their cooking.\nIf they make no cake or pies, but cook simple graham bread, and\ndepend on fruit, canned or dried, they need not get sick in preparing\nfor the meeting, and they need not be sick while at the meeting.\nNone should go through the entire meeting without some warm\nOur Camp Meetings 531\nfood. There are always cookstoves upon the ground, where this may\nbe obtained.\nBrethren and sisters must not be sick upon the encampment. If\nthey clothe themselves properly in the chill of morning and night,\nand are particular to vary their clothing according to the changing\nweather, so as to preserve proper circulation, and strictly observe\nregularity in sleeping and in eating of simple food, taking nothing\nbetween meals, they need not be sick. They may be well during\nthe meeting, their minds may be clear and able to appreciate the\ntruth, and they may return to their homes refreshed in body and\nspirit. Those who have been engaged in hard labor from day to day\nnow cease their exercise; therefore they should not eat their average\namount of food. If they do, their stomachs will be overtaxed. We\nwish to have the brain power especially vigorous at these meetings [603]\nand in the most healthy condition to hear the truth, appreciate it,\nand retain it, that all may practice it after their return from the\nmeeting. If the stomach is burdened with too much food, even\nof a simple character, the brain force is called to the aid of the\ndigestive organs. There is a benumbed sensation upon the brain.\nIt is almost impossible to keep the eyes open. The very truths\nwhich should be heard, understood, and practiced are entirely lost\nthrough indisposition, or because the brain is almost paralyzed in\nconsequence of the amount of food eaten.\nI would advise all to take something warm into the stomach\nevery morning at least. You can do this without much labor. You\ncan make graham gruel. If the graham flour is too coarse, sift it, and\nwhile the gruel is hot, add milk. This will make a most palatable\nand healthful dish for the campground. And if your bread is dry,\ncrumb it into the gruel, and it will be enjoyed. I do not approve\nof eating much cold food, for the reason that the vitality must be\ndrawn from the system to warm the food until it becomes of the\nsame temperature as the stomach before the work of digestion can\nbe carried on. Another very simple yet wholesome dish is beans\nboiled or baked. Dilute a portion of them with water, add milk or\ncream, and make a broth; the bread can be used as in graham gruel.\nI am gratified to see the progress that many have made in the\nhealth reform, yet am sorry to see so many behind. If any become\nsick upon our encampments, inquiry should be made as to the cause,\n532 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nand note should be taken of the case. I am not willing that the\nreputation of our camp meetings should suffer by their being reported\nas the cause of making people sick. If a proper course be pursued\nat these important gatherings, they can be made a blessing to the\nbodily health as well as to the health of the soul.\nChapter 75\u2014A Solemn Dream [604]\nOn the night of April 30, 1871, I retired to rest much depressed\nin spirits. For three months I had been in a state of great discourage-\nment. I had frequently prayed in anguish of spirit for relief. I had\nimplored help and strength from God, that I might rise above the\nheavy discouragements that were paralyzing my faith and hope, and\nunfitting me for usefulness. That night I had a dream which made a\nvery happy impression upon my mind. I dreamed that I was attend-\ning an important meeting at which a large company were assembled.\nMany were bowed before God in earnest prayer, and they seemed to\nbe burdened. They were importuning the Lord for special light. A\nfew seemed to be in agony of spirit; their feelings were intense; with\ntears they were crying aloud for help and light. Our most prominent\nbrethren were engaged in this most impressive scene. Brother A\nwas prostrated upon the floor, apparently in deep distress. His wife\nwas sitting among a company of indifferent scorners. She looked\nas though she desired all to understand that she scorned those who\nwere thus humiliating themselves.\nI dreamed that the Spirit of the Lord came upon me, and I arose\namid cries and prayers, and said: The Spirit of the Lord God is upon\nme. I feel urged to say to you that you must commence to work\nindividually for yourselves. You are looking to God and desiring\nHim to do the work for you which He has left for you to do. If\nyou will do the work for yourselves which you know that you ought\nto do, then God will help you when you need help. You have left\nundone the very things which God has left for you to do. You have\nbeen calling upon God to do your work. Had you followed the\nlight which He has given you, then He would cause more light to\nshine upon you; but while you neglect the counsels, warnings, and\nreproofs that have been given, how can you expect God to give you [605]\nmore light and blessings to neglect and despise? God is not as man;\nHe will not be trifled with.\n533\n534 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nI took the precious Bible and surrounded it with the several\nTestimonies for the Church, given for the people of God. Here, said\nI, the cases of nearly all are met. The sins they are to shun are pointed\nout. The counsel that they desire can be found here, given for other\ncases situated similarly to themselves. God has been pleased to give\nyou line upon line and precept upon precept. But there are not many\nof you that really know what is contained in the Testimonies. You\nare not familiar with the Scriptures. If you had made God\u2019s word\nyour study, with a desire to reach the Bible standard and attain to\nChristian perfection, you would not have needed the Testimonies.\nIt is because you have neglected to acquaint yourselves with God\u2019s\ninspired Book that He has sought to reach you by simple, direct\ntestimonies, calling your attention to the words of inspiration which\nyou had neglected to obey, and urging you to fashion your lives in\naccordance with its pure and elevated teachings.\nThe Lord designs to warn you, to reprove, to counsel, through the\ntestimonies given, and to impress your minds with the importance\nof the truth of His word. The written testimonies are not to give new\nlight, but to impress vividly upon the heart the truths of inspiration\nalready revealed. Man\u2019s duty to God and to his fellow man has been\ndistinctly specified in God\u2019s word; yet but few of you are obedient\nto the light given. Additional truth is not brought out; but God has\nthrough the Testimonies simplified the great truths already given and\nin His own chosen way brought them before the people to awaken\nand impress the mind with them, that all may be left without excuse.\nPride, self-love, selfishness, hatred, envy, and jealousy have\nbeclouded the perceptive powers, and the truth, which would make[606]\nyou wise unto salvation, has lost its power to charm and control the\nmind. The very essential principles of godliness are not understood\nbecause there is not a hungering and thirsting for Bible knowledge,\npurity of heart, and holiness of life. The Testimonies are not to\nbelittle the word of God, but to exalt it and attract minds to it, that\nthe beautiful simplicity of truth may impress all.\nI said further: As the word of God is walled in with these books\nand pamphlets, so has God walled you in with reproofs, counsel,\nwarnings, and encouragements. Here you are crying before God, in\nthe anguish of your souls, for more light. I am authorized from God\nto tell you that not another ray of light through the Testimonies will\nSolemn Dream 535\nshine upon your pathway until you make a practical use of the light\nalready given. The Lord has walled you about with light; but you\nhave not appreciated the light; you have trampled upon it. While\nsome have despised the light, others have neglected it, or followed it\nbut indifferently. A few have set their hearts to obey the light which\nGod has been pleased to give them.\nSome that have received special warnings through testimony\nhave forgotten in a few weeks the reproof given. The testimonies to\nsome have been several times repeated, but they have not thought\nthem of sufficient importance to be carefully heeded. They have\nbeen to them like idle tales. Had they regarded the light given they\nwould have avoided losses and trials which they think are hard and\nsevere. They have only themselves to censure. They have placed\nupon their own necks a yoke which they find grievous to be borne. It\nis not the yoke which Christ has bound upon them. God\u2019s care and\nlove were exercised in their behalf; but their selfish, evil, unbelieving\nsouls could not discern His goodness and mercy. They rush on in\ntheir own wisdom until, overwhelmed with trials and confused with\nperplexity, they are ensnared by Satan. When you gather up the [607]\nrays of light which God has given in the past, then will He give an\nincrease of light.\nI referred them to ancient Israel. God gave them His law, but they\nwould not obey it. He then gave them ceremonies and ordinances,\nthat, in the performance of these, God might be kept in remem-\nbrance. They were so prone to forget Him and His claims upon\nthem that it was necessary to keep their minds stirred up to realize\ntheir obligations to obey and honor their Creator. Had they been\nobedient, and loved to keep God\u2019s commandments, the multitude of\nceremonies and ordinances would not have been required.\nIf the people who now profess to be God\u2019s peculiar treasure\nwould obey His requirements, as specified in His word, special testi-\nmonies would not be given to awaken them to their duty and impress\nupon them their sinfulness and their fearful danger in neglecting to\nobey the word of God. Consciences have been blunted because light\nhas been set aside, neglected, and despised. And God will remove\nthese testimonies from the people, and will deprive them of strength,\nand humble them.\n536 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nI dreamed that, as I was speaking, the power of God fell upon\nme in a most remarkable manner, and I was deprived of all strength,\nyet I had no vision. I thought that my husband stood up before the\npeople and exclaimed: \u201cThis is the wonderful power of God. He\nhas made the testimonies a powerful means of reaching souls, and\nHe will work yet more mightily through them than He has hitherto\ndone. Who will be on the Lord\u2019s side?\u201d\nI dreamed that quite a number instantly sprang to their feet and\nresponded to the call. Others sat sullen, some manifested scorn and\nderision, and a few seemed wholly unmoved. One stood by my side\nand said: \u201cGod has raised you up and has given you words to speak\nto the people and to reach hearts as He has given to no other one. He\nhas shaped your testimonies to meet cases that are in need of help.[608]\nYou must be unmoved by scorn, derision, reproach, and censure. In\norder to be God\u2019s special instrument, you should lean to no one, but\nhang upon Him alone, and, like the clinging vine, let your tendrils\nentwine about Him. He will make you a means through which to\ncommunicate His light to the people. You must daily gather strength\nfrom God in order to be fortified, that your surroundings may not\ndim or eclipse the light that He has permitted to shine upon His\npeople through you. It is Satan\u2019s special object to prevent this light\nfrom coming to the people of God, who so greatly need it amid the\nperils of these last days.\n\u201cYour success is in your simplicity. As soon as you depart from\nthis, and fashion your testimony to meet the minds of any, your\npower is gone. Almost everything in this age is glossed and unreal.\nThe world abounds in testimonies given to please and charm for the\nmoment, and to exalt self. Your testimony is of a different character.\nIt is to come down to the minutiae of life, keeping the feeble faith\nfrom dying, and pressing home upon believers the necessity of\nshining as lights in the world.\n\u201cGod has given you your testimony, to set before the backslider\nand the sinner his true condition and the immense loss he is sus-\ntaining by continuing a life of sin. God has impressed this upon\nyou by opening it before your vision as He has to no other one now\nliving, and according to the light He has given you will He hold you\nresponsible. \u2018Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith\nSolemn Dream 537\nthe Lord of hosts.\u2019 Lift up your voice like a trumpet, and show My\npeople their transgressions, and the house of Israel their sins.\u201d\nThis dream had a powerful influence upon me. When I awoke,\nmy depression was gone, my spirits were cheerful, and I realized\ngreat peace. Infirmities that had unfitted me for labor were removed,\nand I realized a strength and vigor to which I had for months been a [609]\nstranger. It seemed to me that angels of God had been commissioned\nto bring me relief. Unspeakable gratitude filled my heart for this\ngreat change from despondency to light and happiness. I knew\nthat help had come from God. This manifestation appeared to me\nlike a miracle of God\u2019s mercy, and I will not be ungrateful for His\nloving-kindness.\n* * * * *\nChapter 76\u2014Manners and Dress of Ministers\n[Reported as spoken before the General Conference of 1871.]\nEphesians 3:6, 7 : \u201cThat the Gentiles should be fellow heirs,\nand of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ by the\ngospel: whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the\ngrace of God given unto me by the effectual working of His power.\u201d\n\u201cWhereof I was made a minister,\u201d not merely to present the truth\nto the people, but to carry it out in the life.\n\u201cAnd to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery,\nwhich from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God.\u201d Verse\n9. This does not refer merely to the words that roll off the tongue;\nit is not merely to be eloquent in speaking and praying; but it is to\nmake known Christ, to have Christ in us, and make Him known to\nthose that hear.\n\u201cWhom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man\nin all wisdom,\u201d not as novices, not in ignorance, \u201cthat we may\npresent every man perfect in Christ Jesus: whereunto I also labor,\nstriving according to His working, which worketh in me mightily.\u201d\nColossians 1:28, 29. It is the work of God, the grace from God,\nrealized and felt, gracing the life and actions, which is to make a\nsensible impression upon those that hear.\nBut it is not this only. There are other things to be considered, in[610]\nwhich some have been negligent, but which are of consequence, in\nthe light in which they have been presented before me. Impressions\nare made upon the people by the deportment of the speaker in the\ndesk, by his attitude, and by his manner of speaking. If these things\nare as God would have them, the impression they make will be in\nfavor of the truth; especially will that class be favorably impressed\nwho have been listening to fables. It is important that the minister\u2019s\nmanner be modest and dignified, in keeping with the holy, elevating\ntruth he teaches, that a favorable impression may be made upon\nthose who are not naturally inclined to religion.\n538\nManners and Dress of Ministers 539\nCarefulness in dress is an important item. There has been a lack\nhere with ministers who believe present truth. The dress of some has\nbeen even untidy. Not only has there been a lack of taste and order\nin arranging the dress in a becoming manner upon the person, and\nin having the color suitable and becoming for a minister of Christ,\nbut the apparel of some has been even slovenly. Some ministers\nwear a vest of a light color, while their pants are dark, or a dark vest\nand light pants, with no taste or orderly arrangement of the dress\nupon the person when they come before the people. These things\nare preaching to the people. The minister gives them an example\nof order, and sets before them the propriety of neatness and taste in\ntheir apparel, or he gives them lessons in slackness and lack of taste\nwhich they will be in danger of following.\nBlack or dark material is more becoming to a minister in the\ndesk and will make a better impression upon the people than would\nbe made by a combination of two or three different colors in his\napparel.\nI was pointed back to the children of Israel anciently, and was\nshown that God had given specific directions in regard to the material\nand style of dress to be worn by those who ministered before Him.\nThe God of heaven, whose arm moves the world, who sustains us [611]\nand gives us life and health, has given us evidence that He may be\nhonored or dishonored by the apparel of those who officiate before\nHim. He gave special directions to Moses in regard to everything\nconnected with His service. He gave instruction even in regard to\nthe arrangement of their houses and specified the dress which those\nshould wear who were to minister in His service. They were to\nmaintain order in everything and especially to preserve cleanliness.\nRead the directions that were given to Moses to be made known\nto the children of Israel as God was about to come down upon the\nmount to speak in their hearing His holy law. What did He command\nMoses to have the people do? To be ready against the third day;\nfor on the third day, said He, the Lord will come down upon the\nmount in the sight of all the people. They were to set bounds about\nthe mount. \u201cAnd the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people,\nand sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their\nclothes.\u201d That great and mighty God who created the beautiful Eden\nand everything lovely in it is a God of order, and He wants order\n540 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nand cleanliness with His people. That mighty God directed Moses\nto tell the people to wash their clothes lest there should be impurity\nin their clothing and about their persons as they came up before the\nLord. And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and\nthey washed their clothes, according to the command of God.\nAnd to show how careful they were to be in regard to cleanliness,\nMoses was to put a laver between the tent of the congregation and\nthe altar, \u201cand put water there, to wash withal.\u201d And Moses and\nAaron, and Aaron\u2019s sons that ministered before the Lord, were to\nwash their hands and their feet thereat when they went into the tent\nof the congregation, and when they went in before the Lord.\nThis was the commandment of the great and mighty God. There[612]\nwas to be nothing slack and untidy about those who appeared before\nHim when they came into His holy presence. And why was this?\nWhat was the object of all this carefulness? Was it merely to recom-\nmend the people to God? Was it merely to gain His approbation?\nThe reason that was given me was this, that a right impression might\nbe made upon the people. If those who ministered in sacred office\nshould fail to manifest care, and reverence for God, in their apparel\nand their deportment, the people would lose their awe and their rev-\nerence for God and His sacred service. If the priests showed great\nreverence for God by being very careful and very particular as they\ncame into His presence, it gave the people an exalted idea of God\nand His requirements. It showed them that God was holy, that His\nwork was sacred, and that everything in connection with His work\nmust be holy; that it must be free from everything like impurity and\nuncleanness; and that all defilement must be put away from those\nwho approach nigh to God.\nFrom the light that has been given me, there has been a care-\nlessness in this respect. I might speak of it as Paul presents it. It\nis carried out in will-worship and neglecting of the body. But this\nvoluntary humility, this will-worship and neglecting of the body, is\nnot the humility that savors of heaven. That humility will be partic-\nular to have the person and actions and apparel of all who preach\nthe holy truth of God, right and perfectly proper, so that every item\nconnected with us will recommend our holy religion. The very dress\nwill be a recommendation of the truth to unbelievers. It will be a\nsermon in itself.\nManners and Dress of Ministers 541\nBut things that are wrong often transpire in the sacred desk. One\nminister conversing with another in the desk before the congregation,\nlaughing and appearing to have no burden of the work, or lacking a\nsolemn sense of his sacred calling, dishonors the truth and brings [613]\nthe sacred down upon the low level of common things. The example\ntends to remove the fear of God from the people and to detract\nfrom the sacred dignity of the gospel which Christ died to magnify.\nAccording to the light that has been given me, it would be pleasing\nto God for ministers to bow down as soon as they step into the\npulpit, and solemnly ask help from God. What impression would\nthat make? There would be solemnity and awe upon the people.\nTheir minister is communing with God; he is committing himself\nto God before he dares to stand before the people. Solemnity rests\nupon the people, and angels of God are brought very near. Ministers\nshould look to God the first thing as they come into the desk, thus\nsaying to all: God is the source of my strength.\nA minister who is negligent in his apparel often wounds those\nof good taste and refined sensibilities. Those who are faulty in this\nrespect should correct their errors and be more circumspect. The loss\nof some souls at last will be traced to the untidiness of the minister.\nThe first appearance affected the people unfavorably because they\ncould not in any way link his appearance with the truths he presented.\nHis dress was against him; and the impression given was that the\npeople whom he represented were a careless set who cared nothing\nabout their dress, and his hearers did not want anything to do with\nsuch a class of people.\nHere, according to the light that has been given me, there has\nbeen a manifest neglect among our people. Ministers sometimes\nstand in the desk with their hair in disorder, looking as if it had\nbeen untouched by comb and brush for a week. God is dishonored\nwhen those who engage in His sacred service are so neglectful\nof their appearance. Anciently the priests were required to have\ntheir garments in a particular style to do service in the holy place\nand minister in the priest\u2019s office. They were to have garments\nin accordance with their work, and God distinctly specified what [614]\nthese should be. The laver was placed between the altar and the\ncongregation, that before they came into the presence of God, in the\nsight of the congregation, they might wash their hands and their feet.\n542 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nWhat impression was this to make upon the people? It was to show\nthem that every particle of dust must be put away before they could\ngo into the presence of God; for He was so high and holy that unless\nthey did comply with these conditions, death would follow.\nBut look at the style of dress worn by some of our ministers at\nthe present day. Some who minister in sacred things so arrange their\ndress upon their persons that, to some extent at least, it destroys the\ninfluence of their labor. There is an apparent lack of taste in color\nand neatness of fit. What is the impression given by such a manner\nof dress? It is that the work in which they are engaged is considered\nno more sacred or elevated than common labor, as plowing in the\nfield. The minister by his example brings down sacred things upon\na level with common things.\nThe influence of such preachers is not pleasing to God. If any\nare brought out to receive the truth from their labors, they frequently\nimitate their preachers and come down to the same low level with\nthem. It will be more difficult to remodel these and bring them into\na right position, and teach them true order and love for discipline,\nthan to labor to convert to the truth men and women who have never\nheard it. The Lord requires His ministers to be pure and holy, to\nrightly represent the principles of truth in their own lives, and by\ntheir example to bring others up upon a high level.\nGod requires all who profess to be His chosen people, though\nthey are not teachers of the truth, to be careful to preserve personal\ncleanliness and purity, also cleanliness and order in their houses and\nupon their premises. We are examples to the world, living epistles[615]\nknown and read of all men. God requires all who profess godliness,\nand especially those who teach the truth to others, to abstain from\nall appearance of evil.\nFrom the light I have had, the ministry is a sacred and exalted\noffice, and those who accept this position should have Christ in\ntheir hearts and manifest an earnest desire to represent Him worthily\nbefore the people in all their acts, in their dress, in their speaking, and\neven in their manner of speaking. They should speak with reverence.\nSome destroy the solemn impression they may have made upon the\npeople, by raising their voices to a very high pitch and hallooing and\nscreaming out the truth. When presented in this manner, truth loses\nmuch of its sweetness, its force and solemnity. But if the voice is\nManners and Dress of Ministers 543\ntoned right, if it has solemnity, and is so modulated as to be even\npathetic, it will produce a much better impression. This was the\ntone in which Christ taught His disciples. He impressed them with\nsolemnity; He spoke in a pathetic manner. But this loud hallooing\u2014\nwhat does it do? It does not give the people any more exalted views\nof the truth and does not impress them any more deeply. It only\ncauses a disagreeable sensation to the hearers and wears out the\nvocal organs of the speaker. The tones of the voice have much to do\nin affecting the hearts of those that hear.\nMany who might be useful men are using up their vital force and\ndestroying their lungs and vocal organs by their manner of speaking.\nSome ministers have acquired a habit of hurriedly rattling off what\nthey have to say as though they had a lesson to repeat and were\nhastening through it as fast as possible. This is not the best manner of\nspeaking. By using proper care, every minister can educate himself\nto speak distinctly and impressively, not to hurriedly crowd the\nwords together without taking time to breathe. He should speak in\na moderate manner, that the people may get the ideas fixed in their [616]\nminds as he passes along. But when the matter is rushed through so\nrapidly, the people cannot get the points in their minds, and they do\nnot have time to receive the impression that it is important for them\nto have; nor is there time for the truth to affect them as it otherwise\nwould.\nSpeaking from the throat, letting the words come out from the\nupper extremity of the vocal organs, all the time fretting and irritat-\ning them, is not the best way to preserve health or to increase the\nefficiency of those organs. You should take a full inspiration and\nlet the action come from the abdominal muscles. Let the lungs be\nonly the channel, but do not depend upon them to do the work. If\nyou let your words come from deep down, exercising the abdominal\nmuscles, you can speak to thousands with just as much ease as you\ncan speak to ten.\nSome of our preachers are killing themselves by long, tedious\npraying and loud speaking, when a lower tone would make a better\nimpression and save their own strength. Now, while you go on\nregardless of the laws of life and health, and follow the impulse of\nthe moment, do not charge it upon God if you break down. Many\nof you waste time and strength in long preliminaries and excuses\n544 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nas you commence to speak. Instead of apologizing because you are\nabout to address the people, you should commence your labor as\nthough God had something for you to say to them. Some use up\nnearly half an hour in making apologies; thus the time is frittered\naway, and when they get to their subject, where they are desirous\nto fasten the points of truth, the people are wearied out and cannot\nsee their force or be impressed with them. You should make the\nessential points of present truth as distinct as mileposts so that the\npeople will understand them. They will then see the arguments you\nwant to present and the positions you want to sustain.\nThere is another class that address the people in a whining tone.[617]\nTheir hearts are not softened by the Spirit of God, and they think\nthey must make an impression by the appearance of humility. Such\na course does not exalt the gospel ministry, but brings it down and\ndegrades it. Ministers should present the truth warm from glory.\nThey should speak in such a manner as rightly to represent Christ\nand preserve the dignity becoming His ministers.\nThe long prayers made by some ministers have been a great\nfailure. Praying to great length, as some do, is all out of place. They\ninjure the throat and vocal organs, and then they talk of breaking\ndown by their hard labor. They injure themselves when it is not\ncalled for. Many feel that praying injures their vocal organs more\nthan talking. This is in consequence of the unnatural position of\nthe body, and the manner of holding the head. They can stand and\ntalk, and not feel injured. The position in prayer should be perfectly\nnatural. Long praying wearies, and is not in accordance with the\ngospel of Christ. Half or even quarter of an hour is altogether too\nlong. A few minutes\u2019 time is long enough to bring your case before\nGod and tell Him what you want; and you can take the people with\nyou and not weary them out and lessen their interest in devotion\nand prayer. They may be refreshed and strengthened, instead of\nexhausted.\nA mistake has been made by many in their religious exercises\nin long praying and long preaching, upon a high key, with a forced\nvoice, in an unnatural strain and an unnatural tone. The minister has\nneedlessly wearied himself and really distressed the people by hard,\nlabored exercise, which is all unnecessary. Ministers should speak\nin a manner to reach and impress the people. The teachings of Christ\nManners and Dress of Ministers 545\nwere impressive and solemn; His voice was melodious. And should\nnot we, as well as Christ, study to have melody in our voices? He\nhad a mighty influence, for He was the Son of God. We are so far [618]\nbeneath Him and so far deficient, that, do the very best we can, our\nefforts will be poor. We cannot gain and possess the influence that\nHe had; but why should we not educate ourselves to come just as\nnear to the Pattern as it is possible for us to do, that we may have the\ngreatest possible influence upon the people? Our words, our actions,\nour deportment, our dress, everything, should preach. Not only with\nour words should we speak to the people, but everything pertaining\nto our person should be a sermon to them, that right impressions\nmay be made upon them, and that the truth spoken may be taken\nby them to their homes. Thus our faith will stand in a better light\nbefore the community.\nI never realized more than I do today the exalted character of the\nwork, its sacredness and holiness, and the importance of our being\nfitted for it. I see the need in myself. I must have a new fitting up,\na holy unction, or I cannot go any further to instruct others. I must\nknow that I am walking with God. I must know that I understand\nthe mystery of godliness. I must know that the grace of God is in\nmy own heart, that my own life is in accordance with His will, that I\nam walking in His footsteps. Then my words will be true and my\nactions right.\nBut there is another point that I had almost forgotten. It is the\ninfluence which the preacher should exert in his ministry. His work is\nnot merely to stand in the desk. It is but just begun there. He should\nenter the different families, and carry Christ there, carry his sermons\nthere, carry them out in his actions and his words. As he visits a\nfamily he should inquire into their condition. Is he the shepherd of\nthe flock? The work of a shepherd is not all done in the desk. He\nshould talk with all the members of the flock, with the parents to\nlearn their standing, and with the children to learn theirs. A minister\nshould feed the flock over which God has made him overseer. It [619]\nwould be agreeable to go into the house and study; but if you do\nthis to the neglect of the work which God has commissioned you\nto perform, you do wrong. Never enter a family without inviting\nthem together, and bowing down and praying with them before you\nleave. Inquire into the health of their souls. What does a skillful\n546 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nphysician do? He inquires into the particulars of the case, then seeks\nto administer remedies. Just so the physician of the soul should\ninquire into the spiritual maladies with which the members of his\nflock are afflicted, then go to work to administer the proper remedies,\nand ask the Great Physician to come to his aid. Give them the help\nthat they need. Such ministers will receive all that respect and honor\nwhich is due them as ministers of Christ. And in doing for others\ntheir own souls will be kept alive. They must be drawing strength\nfrom God in order to impart strength to those to whom they shall\nminister.\nMay the Lord help us to seek Him with all the heart; I want to\nknow that I daily gather the divine rays from glory, that emanate\nfrom the throne of God and shine from the face of Jesus Christ, and\nscatter them in the pathway around me. I want to be all light in the\nLord.\n* * * * *\nChapter 77\u2014Love of Gain\nDear Brother B,\nI have twice commenced a testimony to you, but have been un-\nable to complete it for want of time. I must delay no longer, for I feel\nsadly burdened over your case. I have written a testimony for several\nof the ministers, and as their cases recur to my mind, I fully realize\nthat their condition is deplorable. Your case is not an exception.\nThe love of gain, the love of money, is becoming prominent with\nmany of our ministers who profess to be representatives of Christ.\nThe example of some of these is such that the people are becoming [620]\ndiscouraged.\nSome of our ministers are standing directly in the way of the\nadvancement of the work of God, and the people who look to them\nfor an example are backsliding from God. About two years ago\nI was shown the dangers of our ministers and the result of their\ncourse upon the cause of God. I have spoken in general terms in\nreference to these things, but those most at fault are the last to apply\nthe testimonies to themselves. Some are so blinded by their own\nselfish interest that they lose sight of the exalted character of the\nwork of God.\nBrother B, your life has been almost a failure. You had talents\nof influence, but you have not improved them to the best account.\nYou have failed in your family; you have let things go at loose ends\nthere, and the same deficiencies are felt in the church. The Lord\nhas given you light in regard to your neglect of duty in your family\nand the course which you should pursue to redeem the past. Your\ndeficiencies were pointed out, but you did not feel the sinfulness of\nbringing children into the world to come up without proper training.\nYou have excused their errors, their sins, and their wayward, reckless\ncourse, and have flattered yourself that they would come out right\nby and by.\nEli exactly represents your case. You have occasionally remon-\nstrated with your children, saying: Why do ye so wickedly? but\n547\n548 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nyou have not exercised your authority as a father, as a priest of the\nhousehold, to command and have your words as law in your family.\nYour own, and also your wife\u2019s, mistaken fondness for your children\nhas led you to neglect the solemn obligation devolving upon you as\nparents.\nA double obligation rested upon you, Brother B, as a minister\nof God, to rule well your own house and bring your children into\nsubjection. But you have been pleased with their aptness and have[621]\nexcused their faults. Sin in them did not appear very sinful. You have\ndispleased God and nearly ruined your children by your neglect of\nduty, and you have continued this neglect after the Lord had reproved\nand counseled you. The injury done to the cause of God by your\ninfluence as a family in the different places where you have lived\nhas been greater than the good that you have accomplished. You\nhave been blinded and deceived by Satan in regard to your family.\nYou and your wife have made your children your equals. They\nhave done about as they pleased. This has been a sad drawback to\nyou in your work as a minister of Christ, and the neglect of your\nduty to bring your children into subjection has led to a still greater\nevil, which threatens to destroy your usefulness. You have been\napparently serving the cause of God, while you have been serving\nyourself more. The cause of God has languished; but you have\nbeen earnestly figuring and planning how to advantage yourself, and\nsouls have been lost through your neglect of duty. Had you, during\nyour ministry, occupied a position to build up this work, had you\nset an example by serving the cause of God irrespective of your\nown interest, and become worn through your devotion to it, your\ncourse would be more excusable, though even then it would not be\napproved of God. But when your deficiencies have been so apparent\nin some things, and the cause of God has suffered greatly because of\nthe example you have given by your neglect of duty in your family,\nit is grievous in the sight of God for you to be professedly serving\nthe cause, yet making your own selfish interests prominent.\nIn your labors you have frequently aroused an interest, and at the\nvery point when you could work to the best advantage have allowed\nhome interests to draw you away from the work of God. In many\ncases you have not perseveringly continued your efforts until you\nwere satisfied that all had decided for or against the truth. It is not[622]\nLove of Gain 549\nwise generalship to commence a warfare against the power of Satan\nand ingloriously leave the field at the height of the conflict, thus\ngiving the enemy opportunity to bind more securely those who were\nupon the point of leaving his ranks and taking their position on the\nside of Christ. That interest, once broken, can never again be raised.\nA few may be reached, but the greater portion can never be affected\nand their hearts softened by the presentation of the truth.\nElder C lost his influence and the power of the truth by engaging\nin speculations, and that out of his brethren. This was peculiarly\noffensive to God in a minister of Christ. But you have done the\nsame. You have made Elder C\u2019s course an excuse for your love\nof traffic. You have justified your course of advantaging yourself,\nbecause other ministers have pursued this course. Other ministers\nare no criterion for you. If they injure their influence, and deprive\nthemselves of the approbation of God and the confidence of their\nbrethren, their course should be shunned. Christ is your example,\nand you have no excuse for taking the course of erring men for\nexample unless their lives are in accordance with the life of Christ.\nYour influence will be death to the cause of God if you continue to\npursue the course that you have pursued for a few years past. Your\ntrafficking and trading, and gathering up from your brethren means\nthat you have not earned, is a great sin in the sight of God.\nSome have really deprived themselves of means necessary for\nthe comfort of their families, and some of even the necessaries of life,\nto help you, and you have received it. Paul writes to his Philippian\nbrethren: \u201cLet this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.\u201d\n\u201cLook not every man on his own things, but every man also on the\nthings of others.\u201d He also writes to his Corinthian brethren: \u201cLet\nno man seek his own, but every man another\u2019s wealth.\u201d Again, he\nmournfully says: \u201cFor all seek their own, not the things which are [623]\nJesus Christ\u2019s.\u201d\nThe spirit which you cherish, of looking out for your selfish\ninterest, is increasing upon you, and your conversation has been\nwith covetousness. Paul admonishes his Hebrew brethren: \u201cLet your\nconversation be without covetousness; and be content with such\nthings as ye have: for He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor\nforsake thee.\u201d You are sacrificing your reputation and your influence\nto an avaricious spirit. God\u2019s precious cause is reproached because\n550 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nof this spirit that has taken hold of its ministers. You are blinded\nand do not see how peculiarly offensive to God these things are. If\nyou have decided to go in and get all of the world you can, do so;\nbut do not do it under cover of preaching Christ. Your time is either\ndevoted to the cause of God or it is not. Your own interest has been\nparamount. The time that you should devote to the cause of God is\ndevoted too much to your own personal concerns, and you receive,\nfrom the treasury of God, means that you do not earn. You are\nwilling to receive means from those who are not as comfortable as\nyourself. You do not look on their side and have bowels of sympathy\nand compassion. You do not closely investigate to see whether those\nwho help you can afford to do so. Frequently it would be more in\nplace for you to help those from whom you receive help. You need\nto be a transformed man before the work of God can prosper in your\nhands. Your home and farm cares have occupied your mind. You\nhave not given yourself to the work. As an excuse for being so much\nat home, you have said that your children needed your presence\nand care, and that you must be with them in order to carry out the\nlight given you in vision. But, Brother B, have you done this? You\nexcuse yourself by saying that your children are now beyond your\ncontrol, too old for you to command. In this you mistake. None of\nyour children are too old to respect your authority and obey your\ncommands while they have the shelter of your roof. How old were[624]\nEli\u2019s sons? They were married men; and Eli, as a father and a priest\nof God, was required to restrain them.\nBut allowing that the two eldest are now beyond your control,\nthey were not when God sent you the light that you were indulging\nthem to their ruin; that you should discipline them. But you have\nthree younger children who are walking in the way of sinners, dis-\nobedient, unthankful, unholy, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of\nGod. Your youngest son is following in the footsteps of his brother.\nWhat course are you pursuing toward him? Do you train him to\nhabits of industry and usefulness? Are you taking up your fearfully\nneglected work and redeeming the past? Do you tremble at the word\nof God?\nYour neglect at home is wonderful in one that has God\u2019s written\nword and also testimonies borne especially to you, showing your\nneglect. Your boy does as he pleases. You do not restrain him. You\nLove of Gain 551\nhave not educated and trained him to bear his share of the burdens of\nlife. He is a bad boy because of your neglect. His life is a reproach\nto his father. You knew your duty, but you did it not. He has no\nconvictions of the truth. He knows he can have his own way, and\nSatan controls his mind. You have made your children an excuse\nto keep you at home; but, Brother B, the things of this world have\ncome first\nThe cause of God does not lie near your soul, and the example\nyou have given the people of God is not worthy of imitation. In Min-\nnesota they need laborers, not merely ministers who go from place\nto place when it is convenient. God\u2019s cause must have minutemen\nwho will not be hindered from the work of God or the call of duty\nby any selfish or worldly interest. Minnesota is a large field, and\nmany there are susceptible to the influence of the truth. Could the\nchurches be brought into working order, thoroughly disciplined, a [625]\nlight would shine forth from them that would tell all through the\nstate. You might have done tenfold more in Minnesota than you\nhave done. But the world has come in between you and the work of\nGod, and divided your interest. Selfish interest has come into your\nheart, and the power of the truth has been going out. There is need of\na great change in you, that you may be brought into working order.\nYou have accomplished but little real, earnest labor. Yet you have\nbeen in earnest to obtain all the means you could as your right. You\nhave overreached; you have looked out for your own interest, and\nhave advantaged yourself at the disadvantage of others. You have for\nsome time been going in this direction; and unless you are checked,\nyour influence is at an end. Moses Hull went in this direction. His\nconversation was with covetousness, and he gathered all the means\nthat he could obtain. His hold of the truth was not strong enough to\novercome his selfishness.\nWhen B. F. Snook embraced the truth, he was very destitute.\nLiberal souls deprived themselves of conveniences, and even of\nsome of the necessaries of life, to help this minister, whom they\nbelieved to be a faithful servant of Christ. They did all this in good\nfaith, helping him as they would have helped their Saviour. But it\nwas the means of ruining the man. His heart was not right with God;\nhe lacked principle. He was not a truly converted man. The more\nhe received, the greater was his desire for means. He gathered all\n552 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nhe could from his brethren, until he had been helped, through their\nliberalities, to a valuable home; then he apostatized, and became the\nbitterest enemy of the very ones who had been most liberal to him.\nThis man will have to render an account for the means that he has\ntaken from truehearted believers in the truth. He did not rob them,\nbut the treasury of God. We wish him no evil; for \u201cGod shall bring\nevery work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be[626]\ngood, or whether it be evil.\u201d He has walked in the ways of his heart\nand in the sight of his eyes, but for all these things God will bring\nhim into judgment. All the hidden things of darkness will then be\nbrought to light, and the secret counsels of the heart shall be made\nmanifest.\nBrother B, you are not as these men. We would not compare\nyou to them, but we would say: Beware of walking in their footsteps\nand of having your conversation with covetousness. This desire on\nthe part of ministers to obtain means for selfish purposes is a snare\nto them, which, if they continue in, will prove their overthrow. As\nthey get their eyes upon self, their interest in the prosperity of God\u2019s\ncause, and their love for poor souls, become less and less. They\ndo not lose their love for, and interest in, the truth at once. Their\ndeparture from the cause of right is so gradual and imperceptible\nthat it is frequently difficult to tell the time when the change in them\ntook place.\nI think your course highly dangerous. You have not felt the\nnecessity of heeding the light which God has given you, and arousing\nyourself to save your family, acquitting yourself as a father and priest\nof your household. You did not deny the light given, you did not\nrise up against it; but you neglected to carry it out because it was\nnot convenient and agreeable to your feelings to do this. Therefore\nyou were like Meroz. You came not up to the help of the Lord,\nalthough the matter was of so vital consequence as to affect the\neternal interests of your children. You neglected your duty. In this\nrespect you were a slothful servant. You have but little sense of how\nGod regards the neglect of parents to discipline their children. Had\nyou reformed here, you would have seen the necessity of the same\neffort to maintain discipline and order in the church. Your slackness\nin your family has been seen also in your labors in the church. You[627]\ncannot build up the church until you are a transformed man.\nLove of Gain 553\nThe neglect of the light that God has given you has, in a degree,\nmade you captive, subject to Satan\u2019s devices; therefore a door has\nbeen left open for him to gain access to you in other directions and\nmake you a weak man. He sees that he has succeeded in blinding\nyour eyes to the interests of your family by leading you to neglect\nthe light which the Lord has given. Then Satan has beset you in\nanother direction. He has excited your love of traffic, your love of\ngain; and thus your interest has been divided from the cause and\nwork of God. The love of God and the truth is gradually becoming\nof less importance. Souls for whom Christ died are of less value\nto you than your temporal interests. If you continue to pursue this\ncourse, you will soon become jealous, sensitive, and envious, and\nwill go away from the truth, as others have gone.\nYou are anxious to obtain labor in your locality, hoping that\nsomething can be said or done to awaken your children. You have\nneglected your duty. When you take up the long-neglected work\nwhich the Lord has left for you to do; when you, with the spirit of\nChrist, resolutely arouse yourself to set your house in order, then\nyou may hope that God will aid your efforts and impress the hearts\nof your family. While you have made your children an excuse for\nyour remaining at home, you have not done the work for which you\npleaded to stay at home. You have not disciplined your children.\nYour wife is deficient in this respect, therefore there is the greater\nneed that you be in a position to do your duty. Her love is of that\nkind which will lead her to indulge them in doing as they please and\nin choosing their own society, which will lead to their ruin. Your\npresence at home, while you allow your children to do as they please,\nis worse for your family than if you were away from them; and it\nhas a worse influence upon the cause of truth.\nGod calls for earnest, unselfish, disinterested laborers in His [628]\ncause who will keep up the various branches of the work, such as\nobtaining subscribers for the periodicals, teaching them promptness\nin paying their dues, and encouraging brethren to keep up their\nsystematic benevolence. Sacrifice, self-denial, toil, and disinterested\nbenevolence characterized the life of Christ, who is our example\nin all things. The work and character of a true minister will be in\naccordance with the life of Christ. He laid aside His glory, His high\ncommand, His honor, and His riches, and humbled Himself to our\n554 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nnecessities. We cannot equal the example, but we should copy it.\nLove for souls for whom Christ made this great sacrifice should\nstimulate His ministers to exertion, to self-denial and persevering\neffort, that they may be co-workers with Him in the salvation of\nsouls. Then will the works of God\u2019s servants be fruitful, for they\nwill indeed be His instruments. The power of God will be seen upon\nthem in the gracious influences of His Spirit. God would have you\narouse and possess strength to surmount obstacles; be not easily\ndiscouraged; if need be, labor, as did the apostle Paul, in weariness,\nin painfulness, in watching, forgetting infirmities in the deep interest\nfelt for souls for whom Christ died.\nSome of our ministers are taking advantage of the liberalities\nof our brethren to advantage themselves; and in so doing they are\ngradually losing their influence; their example in these things is\ndestroying the confidence of their brethren in them. And they are\neffectually closing the door so that those who really need help and\nare worthy of it cannot obtain it. They also shut the door whereby\nhelp may be expected to sustain the cause. Many of the people\nare becoming disheartened as they see some of the ministers they\nemploy manifesting so little interest for the prosperity of the cause\nof God. They do not see a devotion to the work. The people are\nneglected, and the cause is languishing, because of the lack of well-[629]\ndirected and efficient labor which they have a right to expect from\ntheir ministers.\nIn their disappointment some of the brethren give up to a feeling\nof impatience and desperation, as they see the selfishness and cov-\netousness manifested by their teachers. The people are in advance\nof many of their ministers. If the ministers manifest a spirit of self-\nsacrifice and a love for souls, means will not be withheld from the\ncause. Let the ministers come up to the exalted standard as repre-\nsentatives of Christ and we shall see the glory of God attending the\npresentation of truth, and souls will be constrained to acknowledge\nits clearness and power. The cause of God must be made primary.\nMy brother, you could do a good work. You have a knowledge\nof the truth and could be a great blessing to the cause of present truth\nif you were consecrated and sanctified to the work, having no selfish\ninterest aside from it. God has committed to you a sacred trust,\nprecious talents; and if you are found true to your trust, faithfully\nLove of Gain 555\nimproving your talents, you will not be ashamed when the Master\nshall come, requiring both principal and interest. It is not safe to\nslight, or in any sense disregard, the light which God has been\npleased to give. You have something to do to bring yourself into a\nposition where God can especially work for you.\nThe prosperity of the cause of God in Minnesota is due more\nto the labors of Brother Pierce than to your own efforts. His labors\nhave been a special blessing to that state. He is a man of tender\nconscience. The fear of God is before him. Infirmities have weighed\nheavily upon him, and this has led him to question whether he was in\nthe way of his duty and to fear that God was not favoring his efforts.\nGod loves Brother Pierce. He has but little self-esteem, and he fears\nand doubts and dreads labor; for the thought is constantly upon his\nmind that he is not worthy or capable to help others. If he would [630]\novercome timidity and possess more confidence that God would be\nwith him and strengthen him he would be much more happy and\na greater blessing to others. In the life of Brother Pierce there has\nbeen a failure to read character. He believed others to be as honest\nas himself, and in some cases he has been deceived. He has not the\ndiscernment that some have. You also have failed, in your life, to\nread character. You have spoken peace to those against whom God\nhas declared evil. In his age and feebleness Brother Pierce may be\nimposed upon, yet all should esteem him highly for his work\u2019s sake.\nHe commands the love and tenderest sympathy of his brethren, for\nhe is a conscientious, God-fearing man.\nGod loves Sister Pierce. She is one of the timid, fearing ones,\nconscientious in the performance of her duty; and she will receive\na reward when Jesus comes if she is faithful to the end. She has\nnot made a display of her virtues, she has been retiring, one of the\nmore silent ones; yet her life has been useful; she has blessed many\nby her influence. Sister Pierce has not much self-esteem and self-\nconfidence. She has many fears, yet does not come under the head\nof the fearful and unbelieving, who will find no place in the kingdom\nof God. Those outside of the city are among the most confident,\nboastful, and apparently zealous ones who love in word, but not in\ndeed and in truth. Their hearts are not right with God. His fear is\nnot before them. The fearful and unbelieving, who are punished\nwith the second death, are of that class who are ashamed of Christ\n556 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nin this world. They are afraid to do right and follow Christ, lest they\nshould meet with pecuniary loss. They neglect their duty, to avoid\nreproach and trials, and to escape dangers. Those who dare not do\nright because they will thus expose themselves to trials, persecution,\nloss, and suffering are cowards, and, with idolaters, liars, and all\nsinners, they are ripening for the second death.\nChrist\u2019s Sermon on the Mount declares who are the truly blessed:[631]\n\u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit [those who are not self-exalted, but\ncandid, and of a humble disposition, not too proud to be taught, not\nvain and ambitious for the honors of the world]: for theirs is the\nkingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn [those who are\npenitential, submissive, and who grieve over their failures and errors\nbecause the Spirit of God is grieved]: for they shall be comforted.\nBlessed are the meek [those who are gentle and forgiving, who, when\nreviled, will not revile again, but who manifest a teachable spirit,\nand do not hold themselves in high esteem]: for they shall inherit\nthe earth.\u201d Those who possess the qualifications here enumerated\nwill not only be blessed of God here in this life, but will be crowned\nwith glory, honor, and immortality in His kingdom.\n* * * * *\nChapter 78\u2014The Cause in Vermont\nI have been shown that the disciples of Christ are His repre-\nsentatives upon the earth; and God designs that they shall be lights\nin the moral darkness of this world, dotted all over the country, in\nthe towns, villages, and cities, \u201ca spectacle unto the world, and to\nangels, and to men.\u201d If they obey the teachings of Christ in His\nSermon on the Mount, they will be seeking continually for perfec-\ntion of Christian character, and will be truly the light of the world,\nchannels through which God will communicate His divine will, the\ntruth of heavenly origin, to those who sit in darkness and who have\nno knowledge of the way of life and salvation.\nGod cannot display the knowledge of His will and the wonders\nof His grace among the unbelieving world unless He has witnesses\nscattered all over the earth. It is His plan that those who are partakers [632]\nof this great salvation through Jesus Christ should be His missionar-\nies, bodies of light throughout the world, to be as signs to the people,\nliving epistles, known and read of all men, their faith and works\ntestifying to the near approach of the coming Saviour and showing\nthat they have not received the grace of God in vain. The people\nmust be warned to prepare for the coming judgment. To those who\nhave been listening only to fables, God will give an opportunity to\nhear the sure word of prophecy, whereunto they do well that they\ntake heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place. He will present\nthe sure word of truth to the understanding of all who will take heed;\nall may contrast truth with the fables presented to them by men who\nclaim to understand the word of God and to be qualified to instruct\nthose in darkness.\nIn order to increase the numbers at Bordoville, brethren have\nmoved there, leaving the places from which they came destitute of\nstrength and influence to sustain meetings. This has pleased the\nenemies of God and the truth. Those brethren should have remained\nas faithful witnesses, their good works testifying to the genuineness\n557\n558 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nof their faith by exemplifying in their lives the purity and power of\nthe truth. Their influence would convict and convert, or condemn.\nEvery follower of Jesus has a work to do as a missionary for\nChrist in the family, in the neighborhood, in the town or city where\nhe lives. All who are consecrated to God are channels of light. God\nmakes them instruments of righteousness to communicate to others\nthe light of truth, the riches of His grace. Unbelievers may appear\nindifferent and careless; yet God is impressing and convicting their\nhearts that there is a reality in the truth. But when our brethren leave\nthe field, give up the contest, and allow the cause of God to languish,\nbefore God says, \u201cLet them alone,\u201d they will be only a burden to any\nchurch where they may move. Those whom they leave, who were[633]\nconvicted, frequently quiet their consciences with thinking that, after\nall, they were needlessly anxious; they decide that there is no reality\nin the profession made by Seventh-day Adventists. Satan triumphs\nto see the vine of God\u2019s planting either entirely uprooted or left to\nlanguish. It is not the purpose of God that His people should cluster\ntogether and concentrate their influence in a special locality.\nThe efforts of the Brethren D to encourage brethren to move to\ntheir place were made in good faith, yet not according to the mind\nof God. God\u2019s ways are not as our ways. He seeth not as man seeth.\nTheir object was good; but, in so doing, the purposes of God in\nregard to the salvation of souls could not be carried out.\nGod designs that His people shall be the light of the world, the\nsalt of the earth. The plan of gathering together in large numbers, to\ncompose a large church, has contracted their influence, and narrowed\ndown their sphere of usefulness, and is literally putting their light\nunder a bushel. It is God\u2019s design that the knowledge of the truth\nshould come to all, that none may remain in darkness, ignorant of\nits principles; but that all should be tested upon it and decide for or\nagainst it, that all may be warned and left without excuse. The plan\nof colonizing, or moving from different localities where there is but\nlittle strength or influence, and concentrating the influence of many\nin one locality, is removing the light from places where God would\nhave it shine.\nThe followers of Christ scattered throughout the world do not\nhave a high sense of their responsibility and the obligation resting\nupon them to let their light shine forth to others. If there are but\nCause in Vermont 559\none or two in a place, they can, although few in number, so conduct\nthemselves before the world as to have an influence which will\nimpress the unbeliever with the sincerity of their faith. The followers\nof Jesus are not meeting the mind and will of God if they are content [634]\nto remain in ignorance of His word. All should become Bible\nstudents. Christ commanded His followers: \u201cSearch the Scriptures;\nfor in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which\ntestify of Me.\u201d Peter exhorts us: \u201cBut sanctify the Lord God in your\nhearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that\nasketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and\nfear.\u201d\nMany who profess to believe the truth for these last days will be\nfound wanting. They have neglected the weightier matters. Their\nconversion is superficial, not deep, earnest, and thorough. They\ndo not know why they believe the truth, only because others have\nbelieved it, and they take it for granted that it is the truth. They can\ngive no intelligent reason why they believe. Many have allowed\ntheir minds to be filled with things of minor importance, and their\neternal interest is made secondary. Their own souls are dwarfed and\ncrippled in spiritual growth. Others are not enlightened or edified by\ntheir experience or by the knowledge which it was their privilege and\nduty to obtain. Strength and stability are with truehearted professors.\nChrist and Him crucified should become the theme of our\nthoughts and stir the deepest emotions of our souls. The true fol-\nlowers of Christ will appreciate the great salvation which He has\nwrought for them; and wherever He leads the way, they will follow.\nThey will consider it a privilege to bear whatever burdens Christ may\nlay upon them. It is through the cross alone that we can estimate the\nworth of the human soul. Such is the value of men for whom Christ\ndied that the Father is satisfied with the infinite price which He pays\nfor the salvation of man in yielding up His own Son to die for their\nredemption. What wisdom, mercy, and love in its fullness are here\nmanifested! The worth of man is known only by going to Calvary. [635]\nIn the mystery of the cross of Christ we can place an estimate upon\nman.\nWhat a responsible position, to unite with the Redeemer of the\nworld in the salvation of men! This work calls for self-denial, sac-\nrifice, and benevolence, for perseverance, courage, and faith. But\n560 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthose who minister in word and doctrine have not the fruit of the\ngrace of God in their hearts and lives; they have not faith. This is\nwhy there are so small results from their labor. Many who profess to\nbe ministers of Christ manifest a wonderful submission as they see\nthe unconverted all around them going to perdition. A minister of\nChrist has no right to be at ease and sit down submissively in view\nof the fact that his presentation of the truth is powerless and souls\nare not stirred by it. He should resort to prayer, and should work\nand pray without ceasing. Those who submit to remain destitute\nof spiritual blessings, without earnest wrestling for those blessings,\nconsent to have Satan triumph. Persistent, prevailing faith is neces-\nsary. God\u2019s ministers must come into closer companionship with\nChrist and follow His example in all things, in purity of life, in self-\ndenial, in benevolence, in diligence, in perseverance. They should\nremember that a record will one day appear in evidence against them\nfor the least omission of duty.\nBrother D did not discern that in thus encouraging brethren to\nmove to his place he was bringing burdens upon himself and into\nthe church; he did not see that it would require much time and labor\nto keep them in a condition where they could be a help instead\nof a hindrance. He thought that if he could collect families at his\nplace they would help compose a church and relieve him of care\nand burdens. But it has proved at Bordoville as at Battle Creek;\nthe more the brethren moved there, the heavier were the burdens\nwhich fell upon the laborers who had the cause of God at heart.\nMen and women of varied minds and different organizations could[636]\ncluster together and live in sweet harmony, if they would esteem\nothers better than themselves, if they would love their neighbors as\nthemselves, as Christ enjoined upon them.\nBut it is most difficult to deal with human minds that are not\nunder the special control of the Spirit of God and are exposed to\nthe control of Satan. Selfishness so possesses the hearts of men\nand women, and iniquity is so cherished, even by some professing\ngodliness, that the clustering together of a large company should be\navoided; for they will not thus be the most happy.\nThose whom Brother D really desired to have come to Bordoville\nwere those whom he considered the best of society, capable of\nexerting a good influence. Just such men and women are wanted to\nCause in Vermont 561\nbe stationed over the world as faithful sentinels, that those who are\nwithout God may be convinced that there is a power in the religion of\nChrist. Such men of influence are in truth the salt of the earth. God\nwould not be pleased to have them congregate together and narrow\ndown their sphere of usefulness. Reliable men are very scarce for\nthe reason that the hearts of men are so devoted to their own selfish\ninterests that they know no other.\nIf there could be a number of picked men at the important post\nat Battle Creek, God would be pleased; and if they would make a\nsacrifice of their own selfish interests for the sake of the suffering\ncause, they would only be following in the footsteps of their Re-\ndeemer, who left His glory, His majesty and high command, and\nfor our sakes became poor, that we, through His poverty, might be\nmade rich. Christ sacrificed for man; but man, in his turn, will not\nwillingly and cheerfully sacrifice for Christ. If a number of respon-\nsible, true-hearted, burden-bearing men and women who could be\ndepended upon as minutemen, who would promptly respond to the [637]\ncall for help when help is needed, would move to Battle Creek, God\nwould be glorified. God wants men at Battle Creek who can be\ndepended upon; who will ever be found on the right side in times of\ndanger; who will faithfully war against the enemy, instead of taking\ntheir position with those who trouble the Israel of God, and stand in\ndefense of those who weaken the hands of God\u2019s servants, turning\ntheir weapons against the very ones whom God enjoins upon them\nto sustain. In order to prosper, every church must have men upon\nwhom it can rely in times of peril, men who are as true as steel,\nunselfish men, who have the interest of God\u2019s cause lying nearer\ntheir hearts than anything which concerns their own opinions or their\nworldly interests.\nChurches are not wholly composed of pure, sincere Christians.\nNot all the names that stand registered upon the church books are\nworthy to be there. The life and character of some as compared with\nothers is as gold with worthless dross. It need not be so. Those\nwho are valuable in life and influence have felt the importance of\nfollowing Jesus closely, of making the life of Christ their study and\nexample. This will require effort, meditation, and earnest prayer. It\nrequires exertion to obtain the victory over selfishness and to make\nthe interest of God\u2019s cause primary. Some have made the effort\n562 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nand practiced close discipline of self, and they have gained precious\nvictories. Those who consider their own interest primary, live for\nself. Their character in the sight of God is as worthless dross.\nBrother D has had more than one man should do in working for\nthe interest of the church in his place. If he absented himself for a\nshort time to labor for others, heavier and greater burdens were all\nready to be laid upon him when he returned home. He has permitted\nthem to rest upon his shoulders, and has bowed groaning under the\nload. The Brethren D have been in danger of being too exacting and[638]\nof presenting their own lives and example as a criterion. Self has not\nbeen lost sight of in Christ. These brethren should say little about\nself, but exalt Christ. They should hide behind Jesus and let Him\nalone appear as the perfect pattern which all should seek to copy.\nWhere were the men to be depended upon in times of trial\nand danger? Where were the God-fearing men to rally around the\nstandard when the foe was seeking an advantage? Some who should\nhave been at their post were unfaithful when their help was most\nneeded. Their course showed that they had no special interest in\nthe advancement of the work and cause of God. Some thought that\ntoo much was expected of them; and, instead of cheerfully moving\nforward to do what they could, they sat down in Satan\u2019s easy chair\nand refused to do anything.\nSome were ever jealous. Brother E was of this class. He has a\npeculiar stubbornness in his organization that leads him to persist\nin a wrong course because he thinks it would gratify his brethren\nfor him to change and take an opposite course. At times, when he\nfeels just like it, he is ready to do anything in his power to advance\nthe cause of God. But he loves so well to have his own way that he\nwill let the precious cause of God suffer rather than give up his will\nand his way. Brother E is not a man who can be depended upon.\nHe is subject to the temptations of Satan and is frequently under his\ncontrol. He has a selfish, unsubdued heart. He is fitful, impulsive,\nnow hating, then loving. At times he is kind, at other times jealous,\nenvious, and very selfish. He cannot perfect Christian character until\nhe resists temptation, subdues his own stubborn will, and cherishes a\nspirit of humility, a willingness to see and confess his errors. He has\nbeen, at times, true and earnest. Then a wave would carry him in an\nopposite direction, and he would cherish jealousy, envy, and distrust.\nCause in Vermont 563\nSelf and selfish interest were paramount, he was full of faultfinding,\nand suspicious that others did not appreciate him, but wished to [639]\ninjure him. Brother E needs a thorough conversion. It is not enough\nfor men to profess the truth. They may acknowledge the whole truth,\nand yet know nothing\u2014have no experimental knowledge in their\ndaily life\u2014of the sanctifying influence of the truth upon the heart\nand life, or of the power of true godliness.\nThe truth is holy and powerful, and will effect a thorough ref-\normation in the hearts and lives of those who are sanctified by it.\nBrother E is capable of exerting an influence for good. If he subdues\nself and humbles his heart before God he can become a true bearer\nof the yoke of Christ. He can be a help instead of a hindrance to his\nfamily and to others. He weakens the cause of God in Bordoville\nbecause of the defects in his Christian character. If Brother E lives\naccording to the light he has received, he will work out his salvation\nwith fear and trembling, and, in so doing, will let a bright light\nshine upon the pathway of others and will glorify God. The case of\nBrother E represents that of others in the church who need the same\nwork of transformation in their hearts in order to be right.\nBrother F can be more useful in his life than he now is or has\never been. God has not called him especially to minister in word\nand doctrine. He is not qualified for this position, yet he can do\nerrands for the Lord and be a help in the meetings. If he lives in\nthe light himself he can reflect light to others. He can be a blessing\nto others; he can speak words of comfort and encouragement to\nthe desponding. But in order to do this, he should encourage a\nmore hopeful, cheerful spirit himself, refusing to look upon the dark\nside or to talk unbelief. He should express cheerfulness, hope, and\ncourage in his words and even in the tones of his voice.\nSister G has infirmities, yet she does not make the best of her\ncase. She permits the enemy to control her mind and increase her [640]\ndifficulties by an unsubmissive spirit. She suffers from bodily in-\nfirmities and should have sympathy; but restlessness, peevishness,\ncomplaints, murmuring, and useless regrets do not alleviate her suf-\nferings or bring happiness to her, but only aggravate the difficulty.\nThe world is full of dissatisfied spirits who overlook the happi-\nness and blessings within their reach, and are continually seeking\nfor happiness and satisfaction that they do not realize. They are\n564 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nconstantly on the stretch for some expected, far-off good greater\nthan they possess, and are ever in a state of disappointment. They\ncherish unbelief and ingratitude, in that they overlook the blessings\nright in their pathway. The common, everyday blessings of life are\nunwelcome to them, as was the manna to the children of Israel.\nSister G is addressed by Christ: \u201cCome unto Me, all ye that labor\nand are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon\nyou, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye\nshall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden\nis light.\u201d The words, deportment, and general example of Sister G\nteach a lesson entirely different from that taught by our Lord. She\nloses much in overlooking the present blessings within her grasp\nand uneasily searching for happiness. Her efforts are unrewarded,\nand her fruitless search makes great unhappiness for herself and for\nall who associate with her. Her unrest, her anxious, troubled spirit,\nis expressed in her countenance and casts a shadow. This gloom,\nunbelief, and discontent encourages the temptations of the enemy.\nBy her continual distrust, by borrowing trouble, she casts a shadow\ninstead of shedding a sunbeam.\nBrother G should be patient and forbearing, and carefully shield\nher from unnecessary burdens; for she is not prepared to bear them.\nShe, in her turn, should watch against the incoming foe, should\ntake up her life burdens unmurmuringly and bear them with cheer-\nfulness, sweetening them all with gratitude because they are no[641]\nheavier. Brother G is prone to look upon the dark side. He should\nhold himself in readiness to do the will of God and use to the very\nbest advantage the influence which God has given him. He should\ncheerfully perform the duties of today and not borrow tomorrow\u2019s\ntrouble to make himself miserable over. He has not to perform the\nduties of next week, but the work and duties which the day brings.\nBrother and Sister G should unite their influence in saying: \u201cSuf-\nficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\u201d It is a misfortune to borrow\nthe trouble of next week to embitter the present week. When real\ntrouble comes, God will fit every meek and lowly one to bear it.\nWhen His providence permits it to come, He will provide help to\nendure it. Fretting and murmuring cloud and stain the soul, and shut\nout the bright sunlight from the pathway of others.\nCause in Vermont 565\nBrother G might have pursued a course to help Brother H and at\nthe same time help himself; but selfishness deprived Brother H of\nadvantages, and Brother G himself was disadvantaged through fear\nthat he would advantage others. Brother G has not loved his neighbor\nas himself, and his supreme selfishness in many things has deprived\nhim of good and shut away from him the blessing of God. In the\nend, it does not profit any man to be selfish; for God marks it all\nand will render to every man according to his works. \u201cWhatsoever a\nman soweth, that shall he also reap.\u201d \u201cHe which soweth sparingly\nshall reap also sparingly.\u201d\nI have mentioned these persons to represent the true state of\nmany in the church at Bordoville whose cases are similar. The\nmany congregated at that place have brought burdens and cares upon\nBrother D to keep them straight. Had they been free from jealousy,\nand kept themselves in the love of God, they would have stayed up\nhis hands, comforted his heart, and sent him forth to labor for the\nsalvation of souls, while their prayers would have followed him as [642]\nsharp sickles in the harvest field. Their lack of consecration and\ndevotion to God has weakened their own faith, weakened the hands\nof Brother D, destroyed his courage, and made his labors in the\ngospel field nearly useless. Church trials at home have crippled his\nefforts both at home and abroad, and kept his labors confined, in a\ngreat measure, to the locality of his place. This confining of the labor\nmostly to one locality has a withering influence upon the spiritual\ninterest and zeal of a minister of Christ.\nIn order to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth,\nlaborers must have a varied experience. This will be best acquired\nin extended labor in new fields, in different localities, where they\nwill come in contact with all classes of people and all varieties of\nminds, and where various kinds of labor will be required to meet\nthe wants of many and varied minds. This drives the true laborer to\nGod and the Bible for light, strength, and knowledge, that he may be\nfully qualified to meet the wants of the people. He should heed the\nexhortation given to Timothy: \u201cStudy to show thyself approved unto\nGod, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the\nword of truth.\u201d \u201cWho then is that faithful and wise steward, whom\nhis Lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their\n566 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nportion of meat in due season?\u201d Wisdom is needed to discern the\nmost appropriate subject for the occasion.\nBrother D has not been growing up into a successful workman.\nHe has become dwarfed. His mind has been narrowed down, and his\nspiritual strength has been waning. He should now be a successful\nlaborer, a thorough workman. Instead of giving himself wholly to\nthe work, he has been serving tables. Paul exhorted Timothy: \u201cBe\nthou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity,\nin spirit, in faith, in purity. Till I come, give attendance to reading,\nto exhortation, to doctrine. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which[643]\nwas given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the\npresbytery. Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them;\nthat thy profiting may appear to all. Take heed unto thyself, and unto\nthe doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save\nthyself, and them that hear thee.\u201d\nBrother D is active and willing to do, willing to bear burdens\nthat are not connected with his calling; and he has had his mind\nand time too much engrossed in temporal things. Some ministers\nmaintain a certain dignity not in accordance with the life of Christ,\nand are unwilling to make themselves useful by engaging in physical\nlabor, as occasion may require, to lighten the burdens of those whose\nhospitalities they share, and to relieve them of care. Physical exercise\nwould prove a blessing to them, rather than an injury. In helping\nothers they would advantage themselves. But some go to the other\nextreme. When their time and strength are all required in the work\nand cause of God, they are willing to engage in labor and become\nservants of all, even in temporal things; and they really rob God of\nthe service He requires of them. Thus trivial matters take up precious\ntime which should be devoted to the interests of God\u2019s cause.\nBrother J. N. Andrews has erred here. The time and strength\nwhich he has devoted to correspondence with his brethren, answer-\ning their private letters of inquiry, should have been given to the\nspecial interests of the work of God at large. But few realize the re-\nsponsibilities resting upon the few ministers who bear the burdens in\nthis cause. The brethren frequently call these men from the work to\nattend to their little matters, or to settle some church trial, which they\ncan and should attend to themselves. \u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let\nhim ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not;\nCause in Vermont 567\nand it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.\u201d [644]\nHe must be earnest and persevering. If he is irresolute, doubting\ncontinually whether the Lord will indeed do as He has promised, he\nwill receive nothing.\nMany look to their ministers to bring the light from God to them,\nseeming to think this a cheaper way than to be to the trouble of\ngoing to God for it themselves. Such lose much. If they would\ndaily follow Christ and make Him their guide and counselor, they\nmight obtain a clear knowledge of His will, and thus be gaining\na valuable experience. For want of this very experience, brethren\nprofessing the truth walk in the sparks of others\u2019 kindling; they are\nunacquainted with the Spirit of God and have not a knowledge of\nHis will, and are therefore easily moved from their faith. They are\nunstable, because they trusted in others to obtain an experience for\nthem. Ample provisions have been made for every son and daughter\nof Adam to obtain individually a knowledge of the divine will, to\nperfect Christian character, and to be purified through the truth. God\nis dishonored by that class who profess to be followers of Christ\nand yet have no experimental knowledge of the divine will or of the\nmystery of godliness.\nBrother D has had a multiplicity of home cares. The increase of\nnumbers in the church has not lessened his burdens. The increase\nof numbers in his family has been too heavy a tax upon himself and\nhis family, and these things have been a hindrance to his becoming\na successful laborer. He has become rusty in the work of God\nand needs burnishing. His testimony needs to be vitalized by the\nSpirit and power of God. His brethren in Bordoville, who have not\na special work to do in laboring in word and doctrine, should be\nawake to see where others need help, and should help them. Many\nclose their eyes to the good which they have opportunity to do for\nothers, and by their neglect they lose the blessing which they might\nobtain. Brother D has been left to bear burdens that his brethren [645]\nshould have considered it their duty and privilege to bear.\nOur work in this world is to live for others\u2019 good, to bless others,\nto be hospitable; and frequently it may be only at some inconve-\nnience that we can entertain those who really need our care and the\nbenefit of our society and our homes. Some avoid these necessary\nburdens. But someone must bear them; and because the brethren\n568 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nin general are not lovers of hospitality, and do not share equally\nin these Christian duties, a few who have willing hearts, and who\ncheerfully make the cases of those who need help their own, are\nburdened. A church should take special care to relieve its ministers\nof extra burdens in this direction. The ministers who are actively\nengaged in the cause of God, laboring for the salvation of souls,\nhave continual sacrifices to make.\nBrother D\u2019s testimony needs to be enlivened by the grace of God.\nHe needs a new anointing, that he may be able to comprehend the\nmagnitude of the work and devote his entire being to the advance-\nment of the cause of God. The Lord has work enough to employ\nall His followers. All can show forth His glory if they will. But the\nmajority refuse to do this. They profess faith, but have not works.\nTheir faith is dead, being alone. They shun responsibilities and\nburdens, and will be rewarded as their works have been. Because\nsome will not lift the burdens they could lift, or do the work they\nmight do, the work is too great for the few who will engage in it.\nThey see so much to do that they overtax their strength and are fast\nwearing out.\nGod calls at this time for laborers whose interests are fully iden-\ntified with His work and His cause. The ministers engaged in this\nwork must be energized by the spirit and power of the truths they\npreach, and then they will have an influence. The people will seldom\nrise higher than their minister. A world-loving spirit in him has a[646]\ntremendous influence upon others. The people make his deficiencies\nan excuse to cover their world-loving spirit. They quiet their own\nconsciences, thinking that they may be free to love the things of this\nlife and be indifferent to spiritual things because their ministers are\nso. They deceive their own souls and remain in friendship with the\nworld, which the apostle declares to be enmity with God.\nMinisters should be examples to the flock. They should manifest\nan undying love for souls and the same devotion to the cause which\nthey desire to see in the people. The ministers in Vermont have made\na mistake in their labor. They have passed over the same ground\nagain and again to help the churches, when frequently they needed\nlabor bestowed upon themselves, to bring them into a position where\nGod could bless their labors and make them fruitful. There has not\nCause in Vermont 569\nbeen one efficient, thorough laborer, fully qualified to keep up all\nparts of the work, in Vermont.\nBrother and Sister I are invalids. God does not lay very heavy\nresponsibilities upon them. They need to watch closely, lest they\nnarrow down their influence. They have no children of their own\nto call into exercise parental love and care, and are in danger of\nbecoming narrow, selfish, and notional in their views and feelings.\nAll these things have a bad influence upon the cause of God. They\nshould labor to keep their minds elevated above themselves and\nshould not make themselves a criterion for others. Those who have\nno children of their own to share their thoughts and labor, and to\ncall for the exercise of forbearance, patience, and love, should guard\nthemselves lest their thoughts and labor center upon themselves.\nThey are poorly qualified to instruct parents as to the training of\ntheir children, for they have not had experience in this work. Yet in\nvery many cases those who have no children are the most ready to [647]\ninstruct those who have, when, at the same time, the former make\nchildren of themselves in many respects. They cannot be turned out\nof a certain course, and they require even more patience exercised\ntoward them than children do. It is selfish to have a certain course\nmarked out and pursue this course to the inconvenience of others.\nIt is little things which test the character. It is the unpretend-\ning acts of daily self-denial, with cheerfulness and gentleness, that\nGod smiles upon. We should not live for ourselves, but for oth-\ners. We should be a blessing by our forgetfulness of self and our\nthoughtfulness of others. We should cherish love, forbearance, and\nfortitude.\nVery few realize the benefits of the care, responsibility, and ex-\nperience that children bring to the family. Many have large families\ncoming up without discipline; the parents are neglecting a precious\ntrust and sacred duty, which, if faithfully performed in the fear of\nGod, would obtain, not only for their children, but for themselves, a\nfitness for the kingdom of heaven. But a childless house is a desolate\nplace. The hearts of the inmates are in danger of becoming selfish,\nof cherishing a love for their own ease, and consulting their own\ndesires and conveniences. They gather sympathy to themselves, but\nhave little to bestow upon others. Care and affection for depen-\ndent children removes the roughness from our natures, makes us\n570 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ntender and sympathetic, and has an influence to develop the nobler\nelements of our character. Many are diseased physically, mentally,\nand morally, because their attention is turned almost exclusively to\nthemselves. They might be saved from stagnation by the healthy\nvitality of younger and varying minds, and the restless energy of\nchildren.\nBrother J is aged. No weighty responsibility should now rest\nupon him. He has displeased God in his misapplied love for his\nchildren. He has had too much anxiety to help them pecuniarily[648]\nthat he might not offend them. In order to please, he has injured\nthem. They are not wise and faithful in the management of means,\neven from the worldling\u2019s standpoint. Viewed from a religious\nstandpoint, they are very deficient. They have not conscientious\nscruples in regard to religious things. They do not adorn society\nby their position and influence in the world, nor do they adorn the\ncause of God by pure Christian morals and virtuous acts in the\nservice of Christ. They have not been trained to habits of self-denial\nand self-reliance as their safeguards in life. Here is the great sin\nresting upon parents. They do not discipline their children and do\nnot train them up for God. They do not teach them self-government,\nstability of character, and the necessity of a resolute, well-directed\nwill. Most children, in this age, are left to come up. They are not\ntaught the necessity of developing their physical and mental powers\nfor some good purpose, to bless society with their influence, to be\nwell qualified to adorn the Christian life, and to perfect holiness in\nthe fear of God.\nBrother J has erred in entrusting his property to his children. He\nhas laid upon them responsibilities which they were not qualified\nto bear. He placed his means out of his control and has gathered\nup means from his brethren for his feeble labors. God has not been\nglorified by the course which he has pursued in regard to his property.\nHe has excused a wrong course pursued by his children, which is\nnot in keeping with our faith or the Bible standard. He has virtually\nsaid to the wicked, It shall be well with thee; when God has plainly\ndeclared it shall be ill with him.\nThese errors upon the part of Brother J show a great lack of\nheavenly wisdom and have, in a great degree, disqualified him for\nthe solemn work resting upon the faithful minister of Christ. What\nCause in Vermont 571\ncan Brother J plead before God when the Master shall bid him give\nan account of his stewardship? He has been led by the unconsecrated [649]\nminds of his children and has not felt the necessity of seeking counsel\nand advice from God\u2019s servants who were standing in the light. He\nhas been led by a perverted sympathy and has failed in judgment. He\nhas been moving like a blind man. His course has injured himself\nand the cause of God.\nIt is not preachers merely, to go among the churches and pray and\nexhort occasionally, that Vermont needs. A cry for laborers could\nbe consistently raised among God\u2019s people in Vermont. Earnest,\nzealous workmen are needed to strengthen the things that remain by\nministering to the spiritual wants of the people. The cause of God\neverywhere, especially in Vermont, needs burden bearers. Men go\nover and over the same ground, but accomplish very little, if anything.\nThey have a good visit with their brethren, and this is frequently all\nthat is accomplished; and yet they expect to be remunerated for their\ntime.\nThe case of Brother and Sister K comes before me as I write.\nThey have not practiced caring for others. They have not felt the\nresponsibility resting upon them to be burden bearers. Brother K\nwas shown me among others who have felt that they had a work\nto do for the Lord. Indeed he has, and so have very many others,\nif they will do it. There are thorough workmen in the cause of\nGod, who have an experience in the work and who devote their\ntime and strength to the service of God. These should be liberally\nsustained. But those who are merely starting out to visit the churches\noccasionally\u2014especially those who have no families to provide for\nand who have a competency themselves\u2014should not draw upon the\ntreasury of the Lord.\nNeither Brother nor Sister K has an experience in sacrificing for\nthe truth, in being rich in good works, laying up their treasures in\nheaven. Their sympathy, care, and patience have not been called [650]\ninto exercise by dependent, loving children. They have consulted\ntheir own selfish convenience. Their hearts have not been a well-\nspring sending forth the living streams of tenderness and affection.\nIn blessing others by kindly words of love and acts of mercy and\nbenevolence, they would realize a blessing themselves. They have\nbeen too narrow in their sphere of usefulness. Unless such become\n572 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ntransformed in mind and being, and are renewed by the spirit of\nChrist, they cannot become thorough, efficient workmen in the Re-\ndeemer\u2019s cause. His life is the example for Christians. Self-sacrifice\nand disinterested benevolence should characterize their lives. Self-\ninterest is too prominent. Oh, how little does Brother K know of\nwhat it is to labor for God, to lift the cross of Christ and walk in the\nfootsteps of the self-denying Redeemer!\nA minister of Christ, a teacher of the truth, a true shepherd, is in\none sense a servant of all, anticipating the wants of those who need\nhelp, and knowing how to be useful here and there in the great work\nof saving souls. A man who professes to teach the truth, and goes\njust where he pleases, and works when and how he pleases, yet shuns\nresponsibilities, is not bearing the cross after Christ nor fulfilling the\ncommission of a gospel minister. Few know by experience what it\nis to suffer for Christ\u2019s sake. They desire to be like Christ, but wish\nto avoid poverty and crucifixion. They would gladly be with Him in\nglory, but do not love to come to Him through much self-denial and\ntribulation.\nIt has not cost Brother K hard effort to search out the truth; for\nchosen men of God have prepared arguments to his hand, clear,\nplain, and convincing. Difficult points of present truth have been\nreached by the earnest efforts of a few who were devoted to the work.\nFasting and fervent prayer to God have moved the Lord to unlock\nHis treasuries of truth to their understanding. Wily opponents and\nboasting Goliaths have had to be met, sometimes face to face, but[651]\nmore frequently with the pen. Satan has urged men on to fierce\nopposition, to blind the eyes and darken the understanding of the\npeople. The few who had the interest of the cause and truth of God\nat heart were aroused to its defense. They did not seek for ease, but\nwere willing to venture even their lives for the truth\u2019s sake.\nThese zealous searchers after truth risked their capital of strength\nand their all in the work of defending the truth and spreading the\nlight. Link after link of the precious chain of truth has been searched\nout, until it stands forth in beautiful harmony, uniting in a perfect\nchain. These men of investigating minds have brought out arguments\nand made them so plain that a schoolboy may understand them. How\neasy now for men to become teachers of the truth, while they shun\nself-sacrifice and self-denial.\nCause in Vermont 573\nThese searchers for truth have suffered for it and know what\nit cost. They value it and feel the most intense interest in its ad-\nvancement. Self-denial and the cross lie directly in the pathway of\nevery follower of Christ. The cross is that which crosses the natural\naffections and the will. If the heart is not wholly sanctified to God, if\nthe will and affections and thoughts are not brought into subjection\nto the will of God, there will be a failure to carry out the principles\nof true religion and to exemplify in the life the life of Christ. There\nwill not be a true desire to sacrifice ease and self-love, and the carnal\nmind will not be crucified to work the works of Christ.\nThere is a work to be accomplished for many who live at Bor-\ndoville. I saw that the enemy was busily at work to carry his points.\nMen to whom God has entrusted talents of means have shifted upon\ntheir children the responsibility which Heaven has appointed them\nof being stewards for God. Instead of rendering to God the things\nthat are His, they claim that all they have is their own, as though\nby their own might and power and wisdom they had obtained their [652]\npossessions. Who gave them power and wisdom to obtain earthly\ntreasure? Who watered their lands with the dew of heaven and with\nthe showers of rain? Who gave them the sun to warm the earth and\nawaken into life the things of nature, causing them to flourish for the\nbenefit of man? Men whom God has blessed with His bounties clasp\ntheir arms about their earthly treasure and make these bounties and\nblessings, which God has graciously given them, a curse by filling\ntheir hearts with selfishness and distrust of Him. They accept the\ngoods lent them, yet claim them as their own, forgetting that the\nMaster has any claim upon them, and refusing to yield to Him even\nthe interest that He demands. Riches cause the professed follow-\ners of Christ many perplexities and pierce them through with many\nsorrows because they forget God, and love and worship mammon.\nThey allow worldly treasures to embitter their lives and prevent them\nfrom perfecting Christian character. And, as though this were not\nenough, they transmit to their children, to curse them, that which\nhas proved the bane of their own lives. God has entrusted men with\nmeans to prove them, to see if they are willing to acknowledge Him\nin His gifts, and use them to advance His glory upon the earth.\nThe earth is the Lord\u2019s, and all the treasures it contains. The\ncattle upon a thousand hills are His. All the gold and silver belongs\n574 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nto Him. He has entrusted His treasures to stewards, that with them\nthey may advance His cause and glorify His name. He did not entrust\nthese treasures to men that they might use them to exalt and glorify\nthemselves, and have power to oppress those who were poor in this\nworld\u2019s treasure. God does not receive the offerings of any because\nHe needs them and cannot have glory and riches without them, but\nbecause it is for the interest of His servants to render to God the\nthings which are His. The freewill offerings of the humble, contrite[653]\nheart He will receive, and will reward the giver with the richest\nblessings. He receives them as the sacrifice of grateful obedience.\nHe requires and accepts our gold and silver as an evidence that\nall we have and are belongs to Him. He claims and accepts the\nimprovement of our time and of our talents as the fruit of His love\nexisting in our hearts. To obey is better than sacrifice. Without pure\nlove the most expensive offering is too poor for God to accept.\nMany have their hearts so fixed upon their earthly treasure that\nthey do not discern the advantage of laying up for themselves trea-\nsures in heaven. They do not realize that their freewill offerings to\nGod are not enriching Him, but themselves. Christ counsels us to\nlay up treasures in heaven. For whom? For God, that He may be\nenriched? Oh, no! The treasures of the entire world are His, and\nthe indescribable glory and priceless treasures of heaven are all His\nown, to give to whom He will. \u201cLay up for yourselves treasures in\nheaven.\u201d Men whom God has made stewards are so infatuated by the\nriches of this world that they do not discern that by their selfishness\nand covetousness they are not only robbing the Lord in tithes and\nofferings, but robbing themselves of eternal riches. They could be\ndaily adding to their heavenly treasure by doing the very work that\nthe Lord has left them to do, and which He has entrusted them with\nmeans to carry out. The Master would have them watch for opportu-\nnities to do good and, while they live, apply their means themselves\nto aid in the salvation of their fellow men and in the advancement\nof His cause in its various branches. In so doing they only do that\nwhich God requires of them; they render to God the things that are\nHis. Many willingly close their eyes and hearts, lest they should\nsee and feel the wants of the Lord\u2019s cause, and by helping in its\nadvancement should lessen their increase by detracting from the[654]\ninterest or the principal. Some feel that what they give to advance\nCause in Vermont 575\nthe cause of God is really lost. They consider so many dollars gone\nand feel dissatisfied unless they can immediately replace them so\nthat their earthly treasure may not decrease. They exercise close-\nness and even sharpness in dealing with their brethren and also with\nworldlings. They do not scruple to overreach in deal in order to\nadvantage themselves and gain a few dollars.\nSome, fearing they will suffer loss of earthly treasure, neglect\nprayer and the assembling of themselves together for the worship\nof God, that they may have more time to devote to their farms or\ntheir business. They show by their works which world they place\nthe highest estimate upon. They sacrifice religious privileges, which\nare essential to their spiritual advancement, for the things of this life\nand fail to obtain a knowledge of the divine will. They come short of\nperfecting Christian character and do not meet the measurement of\nGod. They make their temporal, worldly interests first, and rob God\nof the time which they should devote to His service. Such persons\nGod marks, and they will receive a curse rather than a blessing.\nSome place their means beyond their control by putting it into the\nhands of their children. Their secret motive is to place themselves\nin a position where they will not feel responsible to give of their\nproperty to spread the truth. These love in word, but not in deed\nand in truth. They do not realize that it is the Lord\u2019s money they are\nhandling, not their own.\nMany would love to see souls converted if it could be done\nwithout any sacrifice on their part; but if their property is touched,\nthey draw back, for it is of more value to them than the souls of\nmen and women for whom Christ died. If those to whom God has\nentrusted means understood their responsibilities as His stewards,\nthey would retain in their own hands that which God has lent them, [655]\nthat they might faithfully perform the duty devolving upon them\nto do their part in helping carry forward the work of God. If all\ncould comprehend the plan of salvation, and the worth of even one\nsoul purchased by the blood of Christ, they would make every other\ninterest of minor consequence.\nParents should have great fear in entrusting children with the\ntalents of means that God has placed in their hands, unless they\nhave the surest evidence that their children have greater interest in,\nlove for, and devotion to, the cause of God than they themselves\n576 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\npossess, and that these children will be more earnest and zealous\nin forwarding the work of God, and more benevolent in carrying\nforward the various enterprises connected with it which call for\nmeans. But many place their means in the hands of their children,\nthus throwing upon them the responsibility of their own stewardship,\nbecause Satan prompts them to do it. In so doing they effectually\nplace that means in the enemy\u2019s ranks. Satan works the matter to suit\nhis own purpose and keeps from the cause of God the means which\nit needs, that it may be abundantly sustained. The efforts made to\nget the truth before the people are not half as thorough and extensive\nas they should be. Not a fiftieth part is now being done to extend\nthe truth that might be done by scattering publications and bringing\nwithin the sound of the truth all that can be induced to come.\nThe probation of many is closing. Satan is daily gathering his\nharvest of souls. Some are making final decisions against the truth,\nand many are dying without a knowledge of it. Their minds are\nunenlightened, and their sins unrepented of; and yet men professing\ngodliness are hoarding up their earthly treasures and directing their\nefforts to gaining more. They are insensible to the condition of men\nand women who come within the sphere of their influence and who\nare perishing for want of knowledge. Well-directed labor, bestowed[656]\nin love and humility, would do much to enlighten and convert their\nfellow men; but the example of many who might do great good is\nvirtually saying: Your souls are of less value to me than my worldly\ninterests.\nMany love the truth a little, but they love this world more. \u201cBy\ntheir fruits ye shall know them.\u201d Spiritual things are sacrificed for\ntemporal. The fruit that such bear is not unto holiness, and their\nexample will not be such as to convict sinners and convert them\nfrom the error of their ways to the truth. They allow souls to go to\nperdition, when they might save them if they would make as earnest\nefforts in their behalf as they have made to secure the treasures of\nthis life. To obtain more of the things of the world, which they\ndo not really need and which only increase their responsibility and\ncondemnation, many labor on the high-pressure plan, and peril health\nand spiritual enjoyment, and the peace, comfort, and happiness of\ntheir families. They let souls go to perdition around them because\nthey fear that it will require a little of their time and means to save\nCause in Vermont 577\nthem. Money is their god. They decide that it will not pay to sacrifice\ntheir means to save souls.\nThe one to whom is entrusted one talent is not responsible for\nfive, or for two, but for the one. Many neglect to lay up for them-\nselves a treasure in heaven by doing good with the means that God\nhas lent them. They distrust God and have a thousand fears in regard\nto the future. Like the children of Israel they have evil hearts of\nunbelief. God provided this people with abundance, as their needs\nrequired; but they borrowed trouble for the future. They complained\nand murmured in their travels that Moses had led them out to kill\nthem and their children with hunger. Imaginary want closed their\neyes and hearts from seeing the goodness and mercies of God in\ntheir journeyings, and they were ungrateful for all His bounties. So [657]\nalso are the distrustful, professed people of God in this age of unbe-\nlief and degeneracy. They fear that they may come to want, or that\ntheir children may become needy, or that their grandchildren will be\ndestitute. They dare not trust God. They have no genuine faith in\nHim who has entrusted them with the blessings and bounties of life,\nand who has given them talents to use to His glory in advancing His\ncause.\nMany have such a constant care for themselves that they give\nGod no opportunity to care for them. If they should be a little short\nat times, and be brought into strait places, it would be the best thing\nfor their faith. If they would calmly trust in God, and wait for Him to\nwork for them, their necessity would be God\u2019s opportunity; and His\nblessing in their emergency would increase their love for Him and\nlead them to prize their temporal blessings in a higher sense than\nthey have ever done before. Their faith would increase, their hope\nwould brighten, and cheerfulness would take the place of gloom and\ndoubts and murmuring. The faith of very many does not grow for\nwant of exercise.\nThat which is eating out the vitals of God\u2019s people is the love\nof money and friendship with the world. It is the privilege of God\u2019s\npeople to be bright and shining lights in the world, to increase in the\nknowledge of God, and to have a clear understanding of His will.\nBut the cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches choke the\nseed sown in their hearts, and they bear no fruit to His glory. They\nprofess faith, but it is not a living faith because it is not sustained\n578 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nby works. Faith without works is dead, being alone. Those who\nprofess great faith, yet have not works, will not be saved by their\nfaith. Satan believes the truth and trembles, yet this kind of faith\npossesses no virtue. Many who have made a high profession of faith\nare deficient in good works. If they should show their faith by their\nworks they could exert a powerful influence on the side of truth. But[658]\nthey do not improve upon the talents of means lent them of God.\nThose who think to ease their consciences by willing their property\nto their children, or by withholding from God\u2019s cause and suffering\nit to pass into the hands of unbelieving, reckless children for them to\nsquander or hoard up and worship, will have to render an account to\nGod; they are unfaithful stewards of their Lord\u2019s money. They allow\nSatan to outgeneral them through these children, whose minds are\nunder his control. Satan\u2019s purposes are accomplished in many ways,\nwhile the stewards of God seem stupefied and paralyzed; they do\nnot realize their great responsibility and the reckoning which must\nshortly come.\nThose who have property and whose minds are darkened by the\ngod of this world seem to be controlled by Satan in the disposal of\nit. If they have true, believing children, and also children whose\naffections are wholly upon the things of the world, in making a\ntransfer of their means to their children, they generally give a larger\namount to those children who do not love God, and who are serving\nthe enemy of all righteousness, than to those who are serving God.\nThey place in the hands of the unfaithful children the very things\nthat will prove a snare to them and that will be obstacles in the way\nof their making a surrender to God. While they make large presents\nto the unbelieving children they make very stinted gifts to those\nwho are of the same faith with themselves. This very fact should\nstartle the men of means who have pursued this course. They should\nsee that the deceitfulness of riches has perverted their judgment.\nIf they could see the influence operating upon their minds they\nwould understand that Satan had these matters very much according\nto his own purposes and plans. Instead of God\u2019s controlling the\nmind and sanctifying the judgment, it is controlled by exactly the\nopposite power. The ones who have been with them in the faith they[659]\nsometimes even neglect, and are frequently very close and exacting\nin all their deal with them; while they have an open hand to the\nCause in Vermont 579\nunbelieving, world-loving children, who they know will not use the\nmeans they have placed in their hands, to advance the cause of God.\nThe Lord requires that those to whom He has lent talents of means\nmake a right use of them, having the advancement of His cause\nprominent. Every other consideration should be inferior to this.\nThe talents of means, be they five, two, or one, are to be im-\nproved. Those who have a large amount of means are responsible\nfor a large number of talents. But the comparatively poor men are\nnot released from responsibility. Those who have but little of this\nworld are represented as having one talent. Yet they are in just as\ngreat danger of having too great love for that little, and of selfishly\nretaining it from the cause of God, as are the more wealthy. They do\nnot sense their danger. They apply the stirring reproofs addressed\nin the word of God to the lovers of this world, to the rich alone,\nwhile they themselves may be in even greater danger than the more\nwealthy. Whether they have much or little, all are required to put\ntheir talents out to the exchangers, that when the Master comes He\nmay receive His own with usury. They are also required to maintain\na consecration to God and an unselfish interest in His cause and\nwork. Seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,\nthey are to believe His promise that all things shall be added. In\ncomparison with every other consideration the salvation of the souls\nof their fellow men should be primary, but this is not generally the\ncase. If there is a neglect anywhere, it is the cause of God that\nmust suffer. God has lent men talents, not to foster their pride, or\nto excite in them envy, but to be used by them to His glory. He has\nmade these men agents to disperse the means with which to carry\nforward the work of the salvation of men. Christ has given them an\nexample in His life. He left all His heavenly riches and splendor, [660]\nand for our sakes became poor, that we, through His poverty, might\nbe made rich. It is not the plan of God to rain down means from\nheaven in order that His cause may be sustained. He has entrusted,\nor deposited, ample means with men, that there shall be no lack in\nany department of His work. He proves those who profess to love\nHim by placing means in their hands, and then tries them to see if\nthey love the gift better than the Giver. God will reveal, in time, the\ntrue feelings of the heart.\n580 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nIn order to advance the cause of God, means are necessary. God\nhas provided for this necessity by placing an abundance in the hands\nof His agents to use in any department of the work where it may be\nrequired in the labor of saving souls. Every soul saved is a talent\ngained. If truly converted, the one brought to a knowledge of the\ntruth will, in his turn, use the talents of influence and of means which\nGod has given him, in working for the salvation of his fellow men.\nHe will engage with earnestness in the great work of enlightening\nthose who are in darkness and error. He will be instrumental in\nsaving souls. Thus the talents of influence and means are continually\nexchanging and constantly increasing. When the Master comes, the\nfaithful servant is prepared to return Him both principal and interest.\nBy his fruits he can show the increase of talents that he has gained\nto return to the Master. The faithful servant will then have done his\nwork, and the Master, whose reward is with Him to give every man\naccording as his work shall be, will return to that faithful servant\nboth principal and interest.\nIn His word the Lord has plainly revealed His will to those\nwho have riches. But because His direct commands have been\nslighted, He mercifully presents their dangers before them through\nthe Testimonies. He does not give new light, but calls their attention[661]\nto the light that has already been revealed in His word. If those who\nprofess to love the truth are holding on to their riches and, failing to\nobey the word of God, do not seek opportunities to do good with that\nwhich He has entrusted to them, He will come closer and will scatter\ntheir means. He will come near to them with judgments. He will in\nvarious ways scatter their idols. Many losses will be sustained. The\nsouls of the selfish shall be unblest. But \u201cthe liberal soul shall be\nmade fat.\u201d Those who honor God, He will honor.\nThe Lord made a covenant with Israel that, if they would obey\nHis commandments, He would give them rain in due season, the\nland should yield her increase, and the trees of the field should yield\ntheir fruit. He promised that their threshing should reach unto the\nvintage and the vintage unto the sowingtime, and that they should\neat their bread to the full and dwell in their land safely. He would\nmake their enemies to perish. He would not abhor them, but would\nwalk with them and would be their God, and they should be His\npeople. But if they disregarded His requirements, He would deal\nCause in Vermont 581\nwith them entirely contrary to all this. His curse should rest upon\nthem in place of His blessing. He would break their pride of power\nand would make the heavens over them as iron and the earth as brass.\n\u201cYour strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield\nher increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits. And\nif ye walk contrary unto Me,\u201d \u201cthen will I also walk contrary unto\nyou.\u201d\nThose who are selfishly withholding their means need not be\nsurprised if God\u2019s hand scatters. That which should have been\ndevoted to the advancement of the work and cause of God, but\nwhich has been withheld, may be entrusted to a reckless son, and\nhe may squander it. A fine horse, the pride of a vain heart, may be\nfound dead in the stable. Occasionally a cow may die. Losses of\nfruit or other crops may come. God can scatter the means He has [662]\nlent to His stewards, if they refuse to use it to His glory. Some, I saw,\nmay have none of these losses to remind them of their remissness in\nduty, but their cases may be the more hopeless.\nJesus warned the people: \u201cTake heed, and beware of covetous-\nness: for a man\u2019s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things\nwhich he possesseth. And He spake a parable unto them, saying,\nThe ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: and he\nthought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no\nroom where to bestow my fruits? And he said, This will I do: I will\npull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all\nmy fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast\nmuch goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and\nbe merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall\nbe required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou\nhast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not\nrich toward God.\u201d He then addressed His disciples: \u201cTherefore I say\nunto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither\nfor the body, what ye shall put on. The life is more than meat, and\nthe body is more than raiment.\u201d\nThese warnings are given for the benefit of all. Will they improve\nthe warnings given? Will they be benefited? Will they regard these\nstriking illustrations of our Saviour and shun the example of the\nfoolish rich man? He had an abundance; so have many who profess\nto believe the truth, and they are acting over the case of the poor,\n582 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nfoolish rich man. Oh, that they would be wise and feel the obligations\nresting upon them to use the blessings that God has given them in\nblessing others, instead of turning them into a curse. God will say to\nall such, as to the foolish rich man: \u201cThou fool.\u201d\nMen act as though they were bereft of their reason. They are\nburied up in the cares of this life. They have no time to devote to[663]\nGod, no time to serve Him. Work, work, work, is the order of the\nday. All about them are required to labor upon the high-pressure\nplan, to take care of large farms. To tear down and build greater\nis their ambition, that they may have wherewith to bestow their\ngoods. Yet these very men who are weighed down with their riches\npass for Christ\u2019s followers. They have the name of believing that\nChrist is soon to come, that the end of all things is at hand; yet they\nhave no spirit of sacrifice. They are plunging deeper and deeper\ninto the world. They allow themselves but little time to study the\nword of life and to meditate and pray. Neither do they give others\nin their family, or those who serve them, this privilege. Yet these\nmen profess to believe that this world is not their home, that they\nare merely pilgrims and strangers upon the earth, preparing to move\nto a better country. The example and influence of all such is a curse\nto the cause of God. Hollow hypocrisy characterizes their professed\nChristian lives. They love God and the truth just as much as their\nworks show, and no more. A man will act out all the faith he has.\n\u201cBy their fruits ye shall know them.\u201d The heart is where the treasure\nis. Their treasure is upon this earth, and their hearts and interests are\nalso here.\n\u201cWhat doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath\nfaith, and have not works? can faith save him?\u201d \u201cEven so faith, if it\nhath not works, is dead, being alone.\u201d When those who profess the\nfaith show their lives to be consistent with their faith, then we shall\nsee a power attending the presentation of the truth, a power that will\nconvict the sinner and draw souls nigh to Christ.\nA consistent faith is rare among rich men. Genuine faith, sus-\ntained by works, is seldom found. But all who possess this faith will\nbe men who will not lack influence. They will copy after Christ;\nthey will possess that disinterested benevolence, that interest in the[664]\nwork of saving souls, that He had. The followers of Christ should\nvalue souls as He valued them. Their sympathies should be with\nCause in Vermont 583\nthe work of their dear Redeemer, and they should labor to save the\npurchase of His blood, at any sacrifice. What are money, houses,\nand lands in comparison with even one soul?\nChrist made a full and complete sacrifice, a sacrifice sufficient to\nsave every son and daughter of Adam who should show repentance\ntoward God for having transgressed His law, and manifest faith in\nour Lord Jesus Christ. Yet notwithstanding the sacrifice was ample,\nbut few consent to a life of obedience that they may have this great\nsalvation. Few are willing to imitate His amazing privations, to\nendure His sufferings and persecutions, and to share His exhausting\nlabor to bring others to the light. But few will follow His example\nin earnest, frequent prayer to God for strength to endure the trials\nof this life and perform its daily duties. Christ is the Captain of\nour salvation, and by His own sufferings and sacrifice He has given\nan example to all His followers that watchfulness and prayer, and\npersevering effort, were necessary on their part if they would rightly\nrepresent the love which dwelt in His bosom for the fallen race.\nMen of property are dying spiritually because of their neglect to\nuse the means God has placed in their hands to aid in saving their\nfellow men. Some become aroused at times and resolve that they\nwill make to themselves friends with the unrighteous mammon, that\nthey may finally be received into everlasting habitations. But their\nefforts in this direction are not thorough. They commence, but, not\nbeing heartily and thoroughly in earnest in the work, they make a\nfailure. They are not rich in good works. While lingeringly retaining\ntheir love and grasp of their earthly treasures, Satan outgenerals\nthem.\nA flattering prospect may be presented to invest in patent rights or [665]\nsome other supposed brilliant enterprise around which Satan throws\na bewitching enchantment. The prospect of getting more money,\nfast and easily, allures them. They reason that, although they had\nresolved to put this money into the treasury of God, they will use it in\nthis instance, and will greatly increase it, and will then give a larger\nsum to the cause. They can see no possibility of a failure. Away goes\nthe means out of their hands, and they soon learn, to their regret,\nthat they have made a mistake. The brilliant prospects have faded.\nTheir expectations are not realized. They were deceived. Satan\noutgeneraled them. He was more shrewd than they, and he managed\n584 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nto get their means into his ranks and thus deprive the cause of God\nof that which should have been used to sustain it in extending the\ntruth and saving souls for whom Christ died. They lost all they had\ninvested, and robbed God of that which they should have rendered\nto Him.\nSome who have been entrusted with only one talent excuse them-\nselves because they have not as large a number of talents as those to\nwhom are entrusted many talents. Like the unfaithful steward they\nhide the one talent in the earth. They are afraid to render to God\nthat which He has entrusted to them. They engage in worldly enter-\nprises, but invest little, if anything, in the cause of God. They expect\nthat those who have large talents will bear the burden of the work,\nwhile they feel that they are not responsible for its advancement and\nsuccess.\nWhen the master comes to reckon with his servants, the unwise\nservants will acknowledge with confusion: \u201cI knew thee that thou\nart an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering\nwhere thou hast not strewed; and I was afraid [Afraid of what? That\nthe Lord would claim some portion of the small talent entrusted\nto them], and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou[666]\nhast that is thine.\u201d His Lord will answer: \u201cThou wicked and slothful\nservant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather\nwhere I have not strewed; thou oughtest therefore to have put my\nmoney to the exchangers, and then at my coming, I should have\nreceived mine own with usury. Take therefore the talent from him,\nand give it unto him which hath ten talents. For unto everyone that\nhath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that\nhath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. And cast ye\nthe unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping\nand gnashing of teeth.\u201d\nMany who have but little of this world are represented by the\nman with one talent. They are afraid to trust God. They are afraid\nthat He will require something which they claim to be their own.\nThey hide their talent in the earth, fearing to invest it anywhere, lest\nthey will be called to give back the improvements to God. Instead\nof putting the talent out to the exchangers, as God required, they\nbury it, or hide it, where neither God nor man can be benefited by\nit. Many who profess to love the truth are doing this very work.\nCause in Vermont 585\nThey are deceiving their own souls, for Satan has blinded their\neyes. In robbing God, they have robbed themselves more. Because\nof covetousness and an evil heart of unbelief, they have deprived\nthemselves of the heavenly treasure. Because they have but one\ntalent, they are afraid to trust it with God, and so hide it in the\nearth. They feel relieved of responsibility. They love to see the\ntruth progress, but do not think that they are called upon to practice\nself-denial and aid the work by their own individual effort and by\ntheir means, although they have not a large amount.\nAll should do something. The case of the widow who cast in\nher two mites is placed upon record for the benefit of others. Christ\ncommended her for the sacrifice she made and called the attention of [667]\nHis disciples to the act: \u201cVerily I say unto you, That this poor widow\nhath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:\nfor all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did\ncast in all that she had, even all her living.\u201d Christ esteemed her gift\nmore valuable than the large offerings of the most wealthy. They\ngave of their abundance. They would not feel the least privation\nbecause of their offerings. But the widow had deprived herself of\neven the necessaries of life to make her little offering. She could not\nsee how her future wants were to be supplied. She had no husband\nto support her in want. She trusted God for the morrow. The value\nof the gift is not estimated so much by the amount that is given as\nby the proportion and by the motive which prompts the gift. When\nChrist shall come, whose reward is with Him, He will give every\nman according as his work shall be.\nAll, both high and low, rich and poor, have been entrusted by\nthe Master with talents; some more, some less, according to their\nseveral ability. The blessing of God will rest upon the earnest, loving,\ndiligent workers. Their investment will be successful and will secure\nsouls to the kingdom of God and an immortal treasure to themselves.\nAll are moral agents, and all are entrusted with the goods of heaven.\nThe talents are proportioned according to the capabilities possessed\nby each.\nGod gives to every man his work, and He expects returns accord-\ning to the various trusts bestowed. He does not require the increase\nof ten talents from the man to whom He has given only one talent.\nHe does not expect the man of poverty to give alms as the man who\n586 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nhas riches. He does not expect of the feeble and suffering the activity\nand strength which the healthy man has. The one talent, used to the\nbest account, God will accept, \u201caccording to that a man hath, and\nnot according to that he hath not.\u201d\nGod calls us servants, which implies that we are employed by[668]\nHim to do a certain work and bear certain responsibilities. He has\nlent us capital for investment. It is notour property, and we displease\nGod if we hoard up our Lord\u2019s goods or spend them as we please.\nWe are responsible for the use or abuse of that which God has thus\nlent us. If this capital which the Lord has placed in our hands lies\ndormant, or we bury it in the earth, even if it is only one talent, we\nshall be called to an account by the Master. He requires, not ours,\nbut His own with usury.\nEvery talent which returns to the Master will be scrutinized.\nThe doings and trusts of God\u2019s servants will not be considered an\nunimportant matter. Every individual will be dealt with personally\nand will be required to give an account of the talents entrusted to him,\nwhether he has improved or abused them. The reward bestowed will\nbe proportionate to the improvement of the talents. The punishment\nawarded will be according as the talents have been abused.\nThe inquiry of each one should be: What have I of my Lord\u2019s,\nand how shall I use it to His glory? \u201cOccupy,\u201d says Christ, \u201ctill\nI come.\u201d The heavenly Master is on His journey. Our gracious\nopportunity is now. The talents are in our hands. Shall we use\nthem to God\u2019s glory, or shall we abuse them? We may trade with\nthem today, but tomorrow our probation may end and our account\nbe forever fixed.\nIf our talents are invested for the salvation of our fellow men,\nGod will be glorified. Pride and position are made apologies for\nextravagance, vain show, ambition, and profligate selfishness. The\nLord\u2019s talents, lent to man as a precious blessing, will, if abused,\nreflect upon him a terrible curse. Riches may be used by us to\nadvance the cause of God and to relieve the wants of the widow and\nthe fatherless. In so doing, we gather to ourselves rich blessings. Not\nonly shall we receive expressions of gratitude from the recipients\nof our bounties, but the Lord Himself, who has placed the means in[669]\nour hands for this very purpose, will make our souls like a watered\ngarden whose waters fail not. When the reaping time shall come,\nCause in Vermont 587\nwho of us will have the inexpressible joy of seeing the sheaves we\nhave gathered, as a recompense of our fidelity and our unselfish use\nof the talents the Lord has placed in our hands to use for His glory?\nWith many in Vermont there has been a decided failure to come\nup to the requirements of God. Some have fallen into a cold and\nlifeless condition spiritually because they are unfaithful servants.\nThe love of the world has so filled their hearts that they have lost\ntheir relish for heavenly things and have become dwarfs in spiritual\nattainments. The state has been deprived of the right kind of labor.\nBordoville has been the center of attraction. All the large gatherings\nhave been held in one locality, which has been like putting light\nunder a bushel; its rays have not benefited the people of the state at\nlarge. Many are still in darkness who might now be rejoicing in the\nknowledge of the truth. The talents and special efforts have been\ndrawn to one locality. This is not as the Lord would have it. He\ndesigns that the warning, testing message should be given to the\nworld, and that His people, who are the light of the world, should\nbe scattered as witnesses amid the moral darkness of the world; that\ntheir lives, their testimony, and their example may be a savor of life\nunto life or of death unto death.\nThe Brethren D will need to be guarded, that they do not thwart\nthe purposes of God by plans of their own. They are in danger of\nnarrowing down the work of God, which is deep and extended.\nBrother D will be in danger of taking too narrow views of the\nwork. God has given him an experience which will be of value if he\nmakes the right use of it. But there is danger that his peculiarities\nwill shape that experience and that other minds will become affected. [670]\nBrother D\u2019s usefulness as a laborer is not what it otherwise would\nbe if he were not so prone to concentrate the strength of his mind\nupon one idea. He dwells upon incidents and upon thoughts that he\nhas had, and repeats them at length, when they are unimportant to\nothers.\nHis mind was aroused in reference to the subject of his health.\nHe concentrated the strength of his mind on this point. He and\nhis symptoms were the principal subjects of conversation. He was\nparticular to go through with the course he had established in his\nmind; and, when seeking his own accommodation, he failed to\nconsider how inconvenient he made it for others. His mind has been,\n588 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nto a great extent, shut up to his own case. This was the burden\nof his thoughts and the theme of his conversation. In this precise,\nsystematic course he has failed to receive the benefit, in point of\nhealth, that he might have realized if he had been more forgetful of\nhimself and, from day to day, engaged in physical exercise, which\nwould have diverted his mind from himself.\nThe same deficiencies have marked his labor in the gospel field.\nIn speaking to the people, he has many apologies to make and many\npreliminaries to repeat, and the congregation become wearied before\nhe reaches his real subject. As far as possible, ministers should avoid\napologies and preliminaries.\nBrother D is too specific. He dwells upon minutiae. He takes\ntime to explain points which are really unimportant and would be\ntaken for granted without producing proof, for they are self-evident.\nBut the real, vital points should be made as forcible as language\nand proof can make them. They should stand forth as prominent\nas mileposts. He should avoid many words over little particulars,\nwhich will weary the hearer before the important points are reached.\nBrother D has large concentrativeness. When he gets his mind\nin a certain direction, it is difficult for him to place it anywhere else;[671]\nhe lingers tediously upon one point. In conversation he is in danger\nof wearying the listener. His writings lack a free, easy style. The\nhabit of concentrating the mind upon one thing, to the exclusion of\nother things, is a misfortune. This should be understood by him, and\nhe should labor to restrain and control this power of the mind, which\nis too active. Too great activity of one organ of the mind strengthens\nthat organ to the enfeebling of other organs. If Brother D would\nmake a successful laborer in the gospel field, he should educate his\nmind. The large development of this organ impairs his health and\nhis usefulness. There is a lack of harmony in the organization of his\nmind, and his body suffers in consequence.\nIt would be greatly for the interest of Brother D to cultivate\nsimplicity and ease in his writings. He needs to avoid dwelling at\nlength upon any point that is not of vital importance; and even the\nmost essential, manifest truths, those which are of themselves clear\nand plain, may be so covered up with words as to be made cloudy\nand indistinct.\nCause in Vermont 589\nBrother D may be sound upon all points of present truth and\nyet not be qualified in every respect to give the reasons of our hope\nto the French people in writing. He can aid in this work. But the\nmatter should be prepared by more than one or two minds, that it\nmay not bear the stamp of any one\u2019s peculiarities. The truth which\nwas reached and prepared by several minds, and which in God\u2019s time\nwas brought out link after link in a connected chain by the earnest\nsearchers after truth, should be given to the people, and it will be\nadapted to meet the wants of many. Brevity should be studied in\norder to interest the reader. Long, wordy articles are an injury to the\ntruth which the writer aims to present.\nBrother D should have his mind less occupied with himself\nand talk less of himself. He should keep himself out of sight and,\nin conversation, avoid making reference to himself and making [672]\nhis peculiarities of life a pattern for others to imitate. He should\nencourage genuine humility. He is in danger of thinking his life and\nexperience superior to that of others.\nBrother D can be of value to the cause of God if there is a\nharmony in the character of his labors. If he can see and correct the\nimperfections of his peculiar organization, which have a tendency\nto injure his usefulness, God can use him to acceptance. He should\navoid lengthy preaching and long prayers. These are no benefit to\nhimself or to others. Long and violent exercise of the vocal organs\nhas irritated his throat and lungs, and injured his general health,\nmore than his precise round of rules for eating and resting have\nbenefited him. One overexertion or strain of the vocal organs may\nnot soon be recovered from, and may cost the life of the speaker.\nA calm, unhurried, yet earnest, manner of speaking will have a\nbetter influence upon a congregation than to let the feelings become\nexcited and control the voice and manners. As far as possible the\nspeaker should preserve the natural tones of the voice. It is the truth\npresented that affects the heart. If the speaker makes these truths a\nreality, he will, with the aid of the Spirit of God, be able to impress\nthe hearers with the fact that he is in earnest, without straining the\nfine organs of the throat or the lungs.\nBrother D is deeply interested in his domestic life; yet there is\ndanger, in conversation, of his cultivating the habit of concentrating\nhis whole mind upon the things which especially interest him, but\n590 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwhich cannot interest or profit others. He tries to maintain a system\nwhich, in itself, is correct; but here again it will be seen that those\nthings which are useful of themselves may become wearisome and\nburdensome by dwelling too much upon them, and by seeking to\ncarry them out under all circumstances. There is danger of neglecting\nthe weightier matters.\nThe Brethren D should avoid being tedious in their labor. Their[673]\ninfluence has been good in the main. Brother D is naturally a good\nmanager in temporal things. His instruction and example in this\ndirection have helped those who were humble enough to be advised.\nBut the jealousy, distrust, rebellion, complaining, and murmuring\nwhich have existed in the church have been disheartening. These\nbrethren should guard against being too exacting.\nIn order to perfect Christian character, we should not cultivate\nmerely a life of quiet, prayerful abstraction, nor a life of all outward\nzeal and busy excitement, while personal piety is neglected. But the\npresent time requires us to be waiting for the coming of the Lord\nand vigilantly working for the salvation of our fellow men. \u201cNot\nslothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\u201d God will not\naccept the most exalted services unless they are first consecrated by\nthe surrender of the soul to Him and His love. With a certain class of\nminds there is danger of systematizing away the Spirit of God and\nthe vitality of the religion of Christ, and preserving an exact round\nof wearisome duties and ceremonies.\nWe are living in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation,\nand our nice and exact plans cannot always be carried out to the\nadvantage of all. If we stand back upon our dignity we shall fail to\nhelp those who need help the most. The servants of Christ should\naccommodate themselves to the varied conditions of the people.\nThey cannot carry out exact rules if they meet the cases of all. Labor\nwill have to be varied to meet the people where they are. \u201cOf some\nhave compassion, making a difference: and others save with fear,\npulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the\nflesh.\u201d\nThe apostle counsels his Corinthian brethren: \u201cWhether there-\nfore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.[674]\nGive none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to\nthe church of God: even as I please all men in all things, not seeking\nCause in Vermont 591\nmine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.\u201d\n1 Corinthians 10:31-33. \u201cFor though I be free from all men, yet\nhave I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 9:19. \u201cTo the weak became I as weak, that I might gain\nthe weak. I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means\nsave some.\u201d Verse 22 . \u201cWe then that are strong ought to bear the\ninfirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let every one\nof us please his neighbor for his good to edification. For even Christ\npleased not Himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them\nthat reproached Thee fell on Me.\u201d Romans 15:1-3.\nBrother and Sister L of Canada have been gradually losing their\nhold on God and their love for heavenly and divine things as they\nhave been more earnestly grasping for worldly treasures. They have\nbeen relaxing their hold on heaven and fastening it more firmly on\nthis world. A few years ago they loved to have an interest in the\nadvancement of the truth and work of God. More recently their\nlove for gain has increased, and they have not felt interested to do\ntheir part to save their fellow men. Self-denial and benevolence for\nChrist\u2019s sake have not characterized their lives. They have done but\nlittle for the cause of God. What have they been doing with their\ntalents? They have been burying them in the earth, investing them in\nlands. They have not been putting them out to the exchangers, that\nwhen the Master comes, He may receive His own with usury.\nThey have a work to do to set their hearts and house in order,\n\u201cLay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.\u201d Their hearts have been\nupon the things of this life, and eternal considerations have been\nmade secondary. They should work earnestly to get the love of the\nworld out of their hearts and should place their affections upon things [675]\nabove, not upon things on the earth. If God\u2019s servants would bear in\nmind that their work is to do all in their power, with their influence\nand their means, to save souls for whom Christ died, there would be\nmore unselfish effort, and unbelievers would be stirred; they would\nbe convinced that there is a reality in the truth thus presented and\nthus backed up by example.\nBrother and Sister L should have confidence in the work for these\nlast days and should be perfecting Christian character, that they may\nreceive the eternal reward when Jesus comes. Brother L is failing\nin physical and mental vigor. He is becoming incapable of bearing\n592 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nmuch responsibility. He should counsel with his brethren who are\ndiscreet and faithful.\nBrother L is a steward of God. He has been entrusted with means\nand should be awake to his duty and render to God the things that\nare God\u2019s. He should not fail to understand the claims that God\nhas upon him. While he lives, and has his reasoning powers, he\nshould improve the opportunity of appropriating the property that\nGod has entrusted to him, instead of leaving it for others to use and\nappropriate after the close of his life.\nSatan is ever ready to take advantage of the weaknesses and\ninfirmities of men to suit his own purposes. He is a wily adversary,\nand has outgeneraled many whose purposes were good to benefit\nthe cause of God with their means. Some have neglected the work\nthat God has given them to do in appropriating their means. And\nwhile they are negligent in securing to the cause of God the means\nthat He has lent them, Satan comes in and turns that means into his\nown ranks.\nBrother L should move more cautiously. Men who are not of\nour faith obtain means of him upon various pretenses. He trusts\nthem, believing them to be honest. It will be impossible for him\nto get back all the means he has let slip out of his hands into the\nenemy\u2019s ranks. He could make a safe investment of his means by[676]\naiding the cause of God and thus laying up for himself treasures in\nheaven. Frequently he is unable to help when he would because\nhe is crippled and cannot command the means to do so. When the\nLord calls for his means, it is frequently in the hands of those to\nwhom he has lent it, some of whom never design to pay, and others\nfeel no anxiety in the matter. Satan will accomplish his purpose as\nthoroughly through dishonest borrowers as in any other way. All\nthat the adversary of truth and righteousness is working for is to\nprevent the advancement of our Redeemer\u2019s kingdom. He works\nthrough agents to carry out his purposes. If he can prevent means\nfrom going into the treasury of God he is successful in one branch\nof his work. That means which should have been used to aid in the\ngreat plan of saving souls he has retained in his ranks to aid him in\nhis work.\nBrother L should have his business all straight and not left at\nloose ends. It is his privilege to be rich in good works, and to lay up\nCause in Vermont 593\nfor himself a good foundation against the time to come, that he may\nlay hold on eternal life. It is not safe for him to follow his failing\njudgment. He should counsel with experienced brethren, and seek\nwisdom of God, that he may do up his work well. He should now\nbe really in earnest, providing himself \u201cbags which wax not old, a\ntreasure in the heavens that faileth not.\u201d\nBrother M has made a mistake in his domestic life. He has not,\nin words, expressed that affection for his wife that it was his duty to\nexpress. He has failed to cultivate true Christian courtesy and polite-\nness. He has failed to be at all times as kind and considerate of her\nwishes and comfort as was his duty. Her not uniting in faith with him\nhas led to much unhappiness for both. Brother M has not respected\nhis wife\u2019s judgment and counsel as he should. In many respects\nher judgment and discernment are better than his. If consulted, she\ncould, by her clearer perception and keener discernment, help him [677]\nessentially in his business matters, in dealing with his neighbors. He\nshould not stand back upon his dignity, feeling that he understands\nit all himself. If he would be advised by his wife, and by his kindly\nactions would show a regard for her, and a desire to please her, he\nwould be doing nothing less than his duty. If her advice conflicts\nwith his duty to God and His claims upon him, then he can choose\nto differ, and in the most quiet manner possible give as his reason\nthat he cannot sacrifice his faith or his principles. It would be for\nBrother M\u2019s interest in temporal matters to have his wife\u2019s judgment\nand counsel.\nWhile he is harsh, rough, and unaccommodating, he can have no\ninfluence to win his wife to the truth. He should reform. He needs\nto become softened, to be tender, gentle, and loving. He should let\nthe sunshine of cheerfulness and happy contentment into his heart,\nand then let its beams shine into his family. He has brought into his\nfamily those whose influence would prove a curse to his wife rather\nthan a blessing. In so doing, he has brought burdens upon her that\nmight have been avoided. She should be consulted, and her wishes\nregarded, as far as possible without compromising his faith.\nBrother M has chosen his own way, and has had a set will,\nsavoring of stubbornness. He has frequently been unyielding. This\nshould not be. He professes to believe a truth which has a sanctifying,\nsoftening, refining influence; his wife does not. He should show that\n594 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthe truth is exerting a power over his perverse nature, that it makes\nhim patient, kind, forbearing, tender, affectionate, forgiving. The\nbest way for Brother M to be a living missionary in his family is for\nhim to exemplify in his life the life of our dear Redeemer.\nChapter 79\u2014Transferring Earthly Treasure [678]\nDear Brother N,\nI have felt very much burdened over your case since we met you\nat the Tipton camp meeting. I could scarcely refrain from addressing\nyou personally while speaking to the people upon the words of\nChrist: \u201cLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth\nand rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:\nbut lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth\nnor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor\nsteal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\u201d\nI recollected your countenance as one that had been shown me in\nvision some time ago. You were thinking you had a duty to preach\nthe word to others; but your example, as you now are, would hinder\nmore from embracing the truth than your preaching would convert\nto its belief. You profess to believe a most solemn, testing message;\nyet your faith has not been sustained by works. You have the truth\nin theory, but you have not been converted by it. The truth has not\nfully taken hold of your heart and been carried out in your daily life.\nYou need to be converted, transformed by the renewing of your\nmind. When the truth takes hold of your heart, it will work a refor-\nmation in the life. The unbelieving world will then be convinced that\nthere is a power in the truth which has wrought so great a change\nin such a world-loving man as you have been. You love this world.\nYour treasures are here, and your heart is upon your treasures. And\nunless the power of the truth shall separate your affections from your\ngod, which is this world, you will perish with your treasures.\nYou have but little sense of the exalted character of the work for\nthese last days. You have not made sacrifices for the truth. You have\na close, penurious spirit, and have closed your eyes to the wants of\nthe distressed and needy. Your compassion has not been stirred to [679]\nrelieve the wants of the oppressed, neither have you had a heart to aid\nthe cause of God with your means or to distribute to the necessities\nof the suffering. Your heart is on your earthly treasures. Unless you\n595\n596 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\novercome your love of the things of the world you will have no place\nin the kingdom of heaven.\nThe lawyer asked Jesus what he should do that he might inherit\neternal life. Jesus referred him to the commandments of His Father,\ntelling him that obedience to them was necessary for his salvation.\nChrist told him that he knew the commandments, and that if he\nobeyed them, he should have life. Mark his answer: \u201cMaster, all\nthese have I observed from my youth.\u201d Jesus looks upon this de-\nceived young man with pity and love. He is about to reveal to him\nthat there is a failure upon his part to keep, from the heart, the com-\nmandments that he confidently asserted he was obeying. Jesus says\nunto him: \u201cOne thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou\nhast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven:\nand come, take up the cross, and follow Me.\u201d\nJesus calls the attention of this young man directly to the defect\nin his character. He cites His own self-denying, cross-bearing life.\nHe had left everything for the salvation of man, and He entreated the\nyoung man to come and imitate His example, and assured him that\nhe should have treasure in heaven. Did the heart of the young man\nleap with joy at this assurance that he should indeed have treasure in\nheaven? Oh, no! His earthly treasures were his idol; they eclipsed\nthe value of the eternal inheritance. He turns from the cross, turns\nfrom the self-sacrificing life of the Redeemer, to this world. He has\na lingering desire for the heavenly inheritance, yet he reluctantly\nturns from the prospect. It cost a struggle to decide which he should\nchoose, but he finally decided to continue his love for his earthly\ntreasures.\nThis young man had great possessions, and his heart was set upon[680]\nthem. He could not consent to transfer his treasures to heaven by\nwithdrawing his affections from them and doing good with them\u2014\nblessing the widow and fatherless, and thus being rich in good works.\nThe love of this young man for his earthly treasures was stronger\nthan his love for his fellow men and the immortal inheritance. His\nchoice was made. The inducement presented by Christ, of secur-\ning a treasure in heaven, was rejected, for he could not consent to\ncomply with the conditions. The strength of his affection for his\nearthly riches triumphed, and heaven, with all its attractive glory,\nwas sacrificed for the treasures of the world. The young man was\nTransferring Earthly Treasure 597\nvery sorrowful, for he wanted both worlds; but he sacrificed the\nheavenly for the earthly.\nBut few realize the strength of their love for riches until the test\nis brought to bear upon them. Many who profess to be Christ\u2019s\nfollowers then show that they are unprepared for heaven. Their\nworks testify that they love riches more than their neighbor or their\nGod. Like the rich young man, they inquire the way to life; but\nwhen the way is pointed out, and the cost is estimated, and they are\nconvinced that they must sacrifice their earthly riches and become\nrich in good works, they decide that heaven costs too much. The\ngreater the treasures laid up upon the earth, the more difficult it is\nfor the possessor to realize that they are not his own, but lent him to\nuse to God\u2019s glory.\nJesus here improves the opportunity to give His disciples an\nimpressive lesson: \u201cThen said Jesus unto His disciples, Verily I say\nunto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of\nheaven.\u201d \u201cIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,\nthan for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d\nHere the strength of riches is seen. The power of the love of\nriches over the human mind is almost paralyzing. Riches infatuate [681]\nmany, and make them act as though they were bereft of reason. The\nmore they have of this world, the more they desire. Their fears of\ncoming to want, increase with their riches. They have a disposition\nto hoard up means for the future. They are close and selfish, fearing\nthat God will not provide for their future needs. Such persons are\nindeed poor toward God. As their riches have accumulated, they\nhave put their trust in them and have not had faith in God or His\npromises.\nThe poor man who has faith and confidence in God, who trusts\nin His love and care, and who abounds in good works, judiciously\nusing the little he has in blessing others with his means, is rich\ntoward God. He feels that his neighbor has claims upon him that\nhe cannot disregard and yet obey the commandment of God: \u201cThou\nshalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d The poor who are rich toward\nGod consider the salvation of their fellow men of greater importance\nthan all the gold and silver that the world contains.\nChrist points out the way in which those who have worldly riches\nand yet are not rich toward God may secure the true riches. He says:\n598 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nSell that ye have, and give alms, and lay up treasure in heaven. The\nremedy He proposes for the wealthy is a transfer of their affections\nfrom earthly riches to the eternal inheritance. By investing their\nmeans in the cause of God to aid in the salvation of souls, and by\nblessing the needy with their means, they become rich in good works\nand are \u201claying up in store for themselves a good foundation against\nthe time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.\u201d This will\nprove a safe investment. But many show by their works that they\ndare not trust in the bank of heaven. They choose to trust their means\nin the earth rather than send it before them to heaven, that their hearts\nmay be upon their heavenly treasure.\nMy brother, you have a work before you, to strive to overcome\ncovetousness and love of worldly riches, and especially self-confi-[682]\ndence because you have had apparent success in securing the things\nof this world. Poor rich men, professing to serve God, are objects\nof pity. While they profess to know God, in works they deny Him.\nHow great is the darkness of such! They profess faith in the truth,\nbut their works do not correspond with their profession. The love\nof riches makes men selfish, exacting, and overbearing. Wealth is\npower; and frequently the love of it depraves and paralyzes all that\nis noble and godlike in man.\nRiches bring with them great responsibilities. To obtain wealth\nby unjust dealing, by overreaching in trade, by oppressing the widow\nand the fatherless, or by hoarding up riches and neglecting the wants\nof the needy, will eventually bring the just retribution described by\nthe inspired apostle: \u201cGo to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for\nyour miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted,\nand your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered;\nand the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat\nyour flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the\nlast days. Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down\nyour fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries\nof them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of\nSabaoth.\u201d\nThe humblest and poorest of the true disciples of Christ, who\nare rich in good works, are more blessed and more precious in the\nsight of God than the men who boast of their great riches. They are\nTransferring Earthly Treasure 599\nmore honorable in the courts of heaven than the most exalted kings\nand nobles who are not rich toward God.\nThe apostle Paul exhorted Timothy to charge the rich: \u201cCharge\nthem that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor\ntrust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly\nall things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, [683]\nready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for\nthemselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they\nmay lay hold on eternal life.\u201d This admonition is applicable to you,\nBrother N, and to very many who profess to believe the truth for\nthese last days.\nThose who hoard up means or invest largely in lands, while they\ndeprive their families of the comforts of life, act like insane men.\nThey do not allow their families to enjoy the things which God has\nrichly given them. Notwithstanding they have large possessions,\ntheir families are frequently compelled to labor far beyond their\nstrength to save still more means to hoard up. Brain, bone, and\nmuscle are taxed to the utmost to accumulate, and religion and\nChristian duties are neglected. Work, work, work, is the ambition\nfrom morning until night.\nMany do not manifest an earnest desire to learn the will of God\nand to understand His claims upon them. Some who attempt to teach\nthe truth to others do not themselves obey the word of God. The\nmore such teachers the cause of God has, the less prosperous will it\nbe.\nMany to whom God has entrusted riches do not consider that they\nare working against their own eternal interest by selfishly retaining\ntheir riches. The apostle shows them that by becoming rich in good\nworks they are working for themselves. They are laying up in store\nfor themselves, providing in heaven an enduring treasure, that they\nmay lay hold on eternal life. In distributing to the necessities of the\ncause, and helping the needy, they are faithfully doing the work that\nGod has assigned them; and the memorial of their self-denial and\ngenerous, loving acts will be written in the book of heaven. Every\ndeed of righteousness will be immortalized, although the doer may\nnot feel that he has done anything worthy of notice. If the daily walk\nof those who profess the truth were a living example of the life of\nChrist, a light would shine forth from them which would lead others [684]\n600 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nto the Redeemer. In heaven alone will be fully estimated the blessed\nresults, in the salvation of others, of a consistent, harmonious, godly\nlife.\nMy brother, you have much to do in your family to show them\nthat the truth has wrought a good work for you and that it has had a\nsoftening, refining, elevating influence upon your life and character.\nYou profess to believe that we are living in the last days and that we\nare giving the warning, testing message to the world; do you show\nthis by your works? God is testing you, and He will reveal the true\nfeelings of your heart.\nThe Lord has entrusted you with talents of means to use to\nadvance His cause, to bless the needy, and to relieve the destitute.\nYou can do a far greater amount of good with your means than\nyou can do by preaching while you retain your means. Have you\nput your talents of means to the exchangers, that when the Master\ncomes, and shall say, \u201cGive an account of thy stewardship,\u201d you\ncan, without confusion, present to Him the talents doubled, both\nprincipal and interest, because you have not hoarded them, have not\nburied them selfishly in the earth, but have put them to use? Look\nover the history of your past life. How many have you blessed with\nyour means? How many hearts have you made grateful by your\nliberalities? Please read the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah. Have you\nloosed the bands of wickedness? Have you sought to undo the heavy\nburdens, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke? Have\nyou dealt your bread to the hungry, and brought the poor that were\ncast out to your house? Have you covered the naked?\nIf you have been rich in these good works, you may claim the\npromises given in this chapter: \u201cThen shall thy light break forth as\nthe morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy[685]\nrighteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be\nthy rearward. Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou\nshalt cry, and He shall say, Here I am.\u201d \u201cAnd if thou draw out thy\nsoul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light\nrise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday: and the Lord\nshall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and\nmake fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and\nlike a spring of water, whose waters fail not.\u201d But you are not now\nentitled to these promised blessings. You have not been engaged in\nTransferring Earthly Treasure 601\nthis work. Look back over your past life and consider how destitute\nit is of good, noble, generous actions. You have talked the truth, but\nyou have not lived it. Your life has not been elevated and sanctified,\nbut it has been characterized by selfishness and stinginess. You have\nserved self faithfully. It is now high time that you were changing\nyour course and working diligently to secure the heavenly treasure.\nYou have lost much that you can never regain. You have not\nimproved your opportunities for doing good, and your unfaithfulness\nhas been entered upon the books of heaven. The life of Christ was\ncharacterized by self-denial, self-sacrifice, and disinterested benevo-\nlence. You do not take a right view of the preparation necessary for\nthe kingdom of God. Your ideas are altogether too meager. Talk is\ncheap stuff; it does not cost much. Works, fruits, will determine the\ncharacter of the tree. What fruits have you borne? The apostle James\nexhorts his brethren: \u201cWhat doth it profit, my brethren, though a\nman say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? If\na brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one\nof you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled;\nnotwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful\nto the body; What doth it profit?\u201d Your good wishes, my brother,\nwill not supply the need. Works must testify to the sincerity of your [686]\nsympathy and love. How many times have you carried the above\nrepresentation out to the letter?\nYou have a very good estimate of yourself, but you have a work\nto do that no other man can do for you. Your nature must be changed,\nand there must be a transformation of the entire being. You love\nthe truth in word, but not in deed. You love the Lord a little, but\nyour riches more. Would the Master say to you, if He should find\nyou as you are at the present time: \u201cWell done, good and faithful\nservant; ... enter thou into the joy of thy Lord\u201d? What joy is here\nreferred to? \u201cWho for the joy that was set before Him endured the\ncross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the\nthrone of God.\u201d The joy that was set before Jesus was that of seeing\nsouls redeemed by the sacrifice of His glory, His honor, His riches,\nand His own life. The salvation of man was His joy. When all the\nredeemed shall be gathered into the kingdom of God, He will see of\nthe travail of His soul and be satisfied.\n602 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nThose who are co-workers with Christ, partakers with Him of\nHis self-denial and His sacrifice, may be instrumental in bringing\nsouls to Christ, and may see them saved, eternally saved, to praise\nGod, and the Lamb who hath redeemed them.\nPleasanton, Kansas,\nOctober 15, 1870.\n* * * * *\nChapter 80\u2014No Probation After Christ Comes\nBrother O,\nWhile I am writing out the dangers of others, your case presses\nupon my mind. For several months I have been seeking an opportu-\nnity to write to you and to others; but constant labor has hindered\nme from writing out all the testimonies given me for individuals.\nYour case has frequently burdened my mind, but I have not felt [687]\nclear to write to you. I have written out very many testimonies which\nhave been given for others, some of which, in many particulars,\nwould apply to you. The object of publishing the testimonies is that\nthose who are not singled out personally, yet who are as much in\nfault as those who are reproved, may be warned through the reproofs\ngiven to others. I thought it would not be my duty to address you\npersonally. Yet, as I write out individual testimonies to those who\nare in danger of neglecting their duty to the cause of God, and thus\nof sustaining an injury, a loss, to their own souls, I do not feel clear\nto leave your case without writing to you.\nThe last view given me was above two years ago. I was then\ndirected to bring out general principles, in speaking and in writing,\nand at the same time specify the dangers, errors, and sins of some\nindividuals, that all might be warned, reproved, and counseled. I saw\nthat all should search their own hearts and lives closely to see if they\nhad not made the same mistakes for which others were corrected\nand if the warnings given for others did not apply to their own cases.\nIf so, they should feel that the counsel and reproofs were given\nespecially for them and should make as practical an application of\nthem as though they were especially addressed to themselves.\nThose who have a natural love for the world and have been\nremiss in their duty can see their own faults specified in the cases of\nothers who have been reproved. God designs to test the faith of all\nwho claim to be followers of Christ. He will test the sincerity of the\nprayers of all those who claim to earnestly desire to know their duty.\nHe will make duty plain. He will give all an ample opportunity to\n603\n604 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\ndevelop what is in their hearts. The conflict will be close between\nself and the grace of God. Self will strive for the mastery and will\nbe opposed to the work of bringing the life and thoughts, the will\nand affections, into subjection to the will of Christ. Self-denial and[688]\nthe cross stand all along in the pathway to eternal life, and, because\nof this, \u201cfew there be that find it.\u201d\nGod is testing the characters of all. He is proving their love for\nHis cause and for the promulgation of the truth which they profess to\nconsider of inestimable value. The Searcher of hearts is judging, by\nthe fruits they bear, who are truly followers of Christ; who, like their\ndivine Pattern, will renounce the honors and treasures of the world,\nand consent to be of no reputation, preferring the favor of God and\nthe cross of Christ, that they may, in the end, secure the true riches,\nthe treasure laid up in heaven, the recompense of reward\u2014eternal\nglory.\nThose who do not really wish to know themselves will allow\nthe reproofs and warnings to pass to others, and will not discern\nthat their own cases are met, their errors and dangers pointed out.\nEarthly, selfish motives blind the mind and so operate upon the soul\nthat it cannot be renewed in the divine image. Those who do not,\nby their own perverse natures, resist His will, will not be left in\ndarkness, but will be renewed in knowledge and true holiness, and\nwill even glory in the cross of Christ.\nI have been shown that, at the right time, God would press the\nburden upon me to say to individuals, as Nathan said to David:\n\u201cThou art the man.\u201d Many apparently believe the testimonies borne\nto others and, like David, give judgment in reference to them, when\nthey should be closely searching their own hearts, analyzing their\nown lives, and making a practical application of the close reproofs\nand warnings given to others.\nBrother O, I have been shown that your affections are more\nupon your earthly treasure than you are sensible of. You have been\nconfused in your perceptions of duty. And when the Spirit of God\noperates upon your mind and would lead you to do what is according[689]\nto the will and requirements of God, other influences that are not\nin harmony with the work of God for this time hinder you from\nobeying the promptings of the divine will; the result is, your faith\nis not made perfect by works. Your affections should be withdrawn\nNo Probation After Christ Comes 605\nfrom your earthly treasure. At times when, contrary to your wishes\nand calculations, means was passing from you into the enemy\u2019s\nranks, and was thus lost to the cause of God, you have seemed much\nperplexed and troubled. Talents of means have been entrusted to\nyou by the Master for you to improve to His glory. You are His\nsteward and should be very cautious lest you neglect your duty. You\nare naturally a world-loving man and will be inclined to claim as\nyour own the talents of means committed to your care. But, \u201cGive\nan account of thy stewardship\u201d will be heard by you by and by.\nThe children of God are wise when they trust in that wisdom\nalone which comes from above, and when they have no strength but\nthat which is from God. Separation from the friendship and spirit\nof the world is needful for us if we would be united to the Lord and\nabide in him. Our strength and our prosperity consist in our being\nconnected with the Lord, chosen and accepted of Him. There can be\nno union between light and darkness. God intends that His people\nshall be a peculiar people, separate from the world, and be living\nexamples of holiness, that the world may be enlightened, convicted,\nor condemned, according as they treat the light given them. The\ntruth that has been brought before the understanding, the light that\nhas shone upon the soul, will judge and condemn if it be neglected\nor turned from.\nIn this degenerate age, error and darkness are preferred rather\nthan light and truth. The works of many of Christ\u2019s professed follow-\ners will not bear the test when examined by the light that now shines\nupon them. For this cause, many do not come to the light lest it shall [690]\nbe made manifest that their works are not wrought in God. Light\ndiscovers, makes manifest, the evil hidden under darkness. Men of\nthe world and men who are Christ\u2019s servants indeed may be alike\nin outward appearance; but they are servants of two masters whose\ninterests are in decided opposition to each other. The world does\nnot understand or discern the difference; but there is an immense\ndistance, a vast, separation, between them.\nSays Christ: \u201cYe are not of the world, but I have chosen you\nout of the world.\u201d The true followers of Christ cannot enjoy the\nfriendship of the world and at the same time have their life hid with\nChrist. The affections must be withdrawn from the treasures of earth\nand transferred to the heavenly treasure. How difficult was it for the\n606 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nyoung man who had great possessions to withdraw his affections\nfrom his worldly treasure, even with the promise of eternal life\nbefore him as his reward!\nWhen all that we have and are is not consecrated to God, selfish\ninterests close our eyes to the importance of the work, and the means\nthat God calls for is withheld. But He who has lent us this means\nfor the advancement of His cause will frequently withdraw His\nprospering hand and in some way scatter the means thus withheld,\nand it will be lost to its possessor and lost to the cause of God. It is\nnot preserved in this world or in the world to come. God is robbed,\nand Satan triumphs. The Lord would have you closely search your\nown heart, Brother O, and get the love of the world out of it. Die to\nself, and live unto God. Then will you be of that number who are\nthe light of the world.\nI have been shown that you were cherishing erroneous views in\nregard to the future, views savoring of the pernicious sentiments of\nthe Age-to-come. You sometimes talk out these ideas to others. But\nthey are not in harmony with the body. You do not make a right[691]\napplication of Scripture. When Jesus rises up in the most holy place,\nand lays off His mediatorial garments, and clothes Himself with the\ngarments of vengeance in place of the priestly attire, the work for\nsinners will be done. The period of time will then have come when\nthe mandate will go forth: \u201cHe that is unjust, let him be unjust still:\n... and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is\nholy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly; and My\nreward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall\nbe.\u201d\nGod has given His word for all to investigate, that they may learn\nthe way to life. None need err if they will submit to the conditions of\nsalvation laid down in the word of God. Probation is granted to all,\nthat all may form characters for eternal life. An opportunity will be\ngiven to all to decide for life or death. Men will be judged according\nto the measure of light given them. None will be accountable for\ntheir darkness and their errors if the light has not been brought to\nthem. They have not sinned in not accepting what has not been given\nthem. All will be tested before Jesus leaves His position in the most\nholy place. The probation of all closes when the pleading for sinners\nis ended and the garments of vengeance are put on.\nNo Probation After Christ Comes 607\nMany entertain the view that probation is granted after Jesus\nleaves His work as mediator in the most holy apartment. This is\nthe sophistry of Satan. God tests and proves the world by the light\nwhich He is pleased to give them previous to the coming of Christ.\nCharacters are then formed for life or death. But the probation of\nthose who choose to live a life of sin, and neglect the great salvation\noffered, closes when Christ\u2019s ministration ceases just previous to\nHis appearing in the clouds of heaven.\nThose who love the world, and whose minds are carnal and at [692]\nenmity with God, will flatter themselves that a period of probation\nwill be granted after Christ appears in the clouds of heaven. The\ncarnal heart, which is so averse to submission and obedience, will be\ndeceived with this pleasing view. Many will remain in carnal security\nand continue in rebellion against God, flattering themselves that\nthere is then to be a period for repentance of sin and an opportunity\nfor them to accept the truth which now is unpopular and crossing\nto their natural inclination and desires. When they have nothing to\nventure, nothing to lose, by yielding obedience to Christ and the\ntruth, they think they will take their chance for salvation.\nThere are in the Scriptures some things which are hard to be\nunderstood and which, according to the language of Peter, the un-\nlearned and unstable wrest unto their own destruction. We may\nnot, in this life, be able to explain the meaning of every passage of\nScripture; but there are no vital points of practical truth that will\nbe clouded in mystery. When the time shall come, in the provi-\ndence of God, for the world to be tested upon the truth for that time,\nminds will be exercised by His Spirit to search the Scriptures, even\nwith fasting and with prayer, until link after link is searched out and\nunited in a perfect chain. Every fact which immediately concerns\nthe salvation of souls will be made so clear that none need err or\nwalk in darkness.\nAs we have followed down the chain of prophecy, revealed truth\nfor our time has been clearly seen and explained. We are accountable\nfor the privileges that we enjoy and for the light that shines upon\nour pathway. Those who lived in past generations were accountable\nfor the light which was permitted to shine upon them. Their minds\nwere exercised in regard to different points of Scripture which tested\nthem. But they did not understand the truths which we do. They\n608 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nwere not responsible for the light which they did not have. They had\nthe Bible, as we have; but the time for the unfolding of special truth[693]\nin relation to the closing scenes of this earth\u2019s history is during the\nlast generations that shall live upon the earth.\nSpecial truths have been adapted to the conditions of the genera-\ntions as they have existed. The present truth, which is a test to the\npeople of this generation, was not a test to the people of generations\nfar back. If the light which now shines upon us in regard to the Sab-\nbath of the fourth commandment had been given to the generations\nin the past, God would have held them accountable for that light.\nWhen the temple of God was opened in heaven, John saw in\nholy vision a class of people whose attention was arrested and who\nwere looking with reverential awe at the ark, which contained the\nlaw of God. The special test upon the fourth commandment did not\ncome until after the temple of God was opened in heaven.\nThose who died before the light was given upon the law of God\nand the claims of the fourth commandment were not guilty of the sin\nof violating the seventh-day Sabbath. The wisdom and mercy of God\nin dispensing light and knowledge at the proper time, as the people\nneed it, is unsearchable. Previous to His coming to judge the world\nin righteousness, He sends forth a warning to arouse the people and\ncall their attention to their neglect of the fourth commandment, that\nthey may be enlightened, and may repent of their transgression of His\nlaw, and prove their allegiance to the great Lawgiver. He has made\nprovision that all may be holy and happy if they choose. Sufficient\nlight has been given to this generation, that we may learn what our\nduties and privileges are, and enjoy the precious and solemn truths\nin their simplicity and power.\nWe are accountable only for the light that shines upon us. The\ncommandments of God and the testimony of Jesus are testing us. If\nwe are faithful and obedient, God will delight in us, and bless us\nas His own chosen peculiar people. When perfect faith and perfect[694]\nlove and obedience abound, working in the hearts of those who are\nChrist\u2019s followers, they will have a powerful influence. Light will\nemanate from them, dispelling the darkness around them, refining\nand elevating all who come within the sphere of their influence,\nand bringing to a knowledge of the truth all who are willing to be\nenlightened and to follow in the humble path of obedience.\nNo Probation After Christ Comes 609\nThose who possess the carnal mind cannot comprehend the sa-\ncred force of vital truth upon which their salvation depends, because\nthey cherish pride of heart, love of the world, love of ease, selfish-\nness, covetousness, envy, jealousy, lust, hatred, and every evil. If\nthey would overcome these they might be partakers of the divine\nnature. Many leave the plain truths of God\u2019s word and neglect to\nfollow the light that shines clearly upon their pathway; they try to pry\ninto secrets not plainly revealed and conjecture and talk and dispute\nin regard to questions which they are not required to understand, for\nthey have no special reference to their salvation. Thousands have\nbeen beguiled in this way by Satan. They have neglected present\nfaith and present duty which are clear and comprehensive to all who\nhave their reasoning powers; they have dwelt upon doubtful theories\nand scriptures which they could not comprehend, and have erred\nconcerning the faith; they have a mixed faith.\nGod would have all make a practical use of the plain teachings\nof His word in regard to the salvation of man. If they are doers of\nthe word, which is plain and powerful in its simplicity, they will not\nfail to perfect Christian character. They will be sanctified through\nthe truth, and through humble obedience to it will secure everlasting\nlife. God wants servants that are true, not only in word, but in deed.\nTheir fruits will show the genuineness of their faith.\nBrother O, you will be subject to Satan\u2019s temptations if you\ncontinue to cherish your erroneous views. Your faith will be a mixed [695]\nfaith, and you will be in danger of confusing the minds of others.\nGod requires His people to be a unit. Your peculiar views will prove\nan injury to your influence; and if you continue to cherish them and\ntalk them, they will finally serve to separate you from your brethren.\nIf God has light which is necessary for the salvation of His people,\nHe will give it to them as He has given other great and important\ntruths. Here you should let the matter rest. Let God work in His own\nway to accomplish His purposes in His own time and manner. May\nGod enable you to walk in the light as He is in the light.\n* * * * *\nChapter 81\u2014Accountability for Light Received\nI have been shown the case of Brother P. He had been standing\nfor some time resisting the truth. His sin was not that he did not\nreceive that which he sincerely believed to be error, but that he did not\ninvestigate diligently and gain a knowledge of what he was opposing.\nHe took it for granted that Sabbathkeeping Adventists, as a body,\nwere in error. This view was in harmony with his feelings, and he did\nnot see the necessity of finding out for himself by diligently searching\nthe Scriptures with earnest prayer. Had he pursued this course he\nmight now have been far in advance of his present position. He has\nbeen too slow to receive evidence and too neglectful in searching the\nScriptures to see if these things are so. Paul did not consider those\nworthy of commendation who resisted his teachings as long as they\ncould until compelled by overwhelming evidence to decide in favor\nof the doctrine which he taught and which he had received of God.\nPaul and Silas labored in the synagogue of the Jews at Thessa-\nlonica with some success; but the unbelieving Jews were greatly\ndissatisfied, and created a disturbance, and made a great uproar[696]\nagainst them. These devoted apostles were obliged to leave Thes-\nsalonica under the cover of night and go to Berea, where they were\ngladly welcomed. They speak in commendation of the Bereans\nthus: \u201cThese were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that\nthey received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the\nScriptures daily, whether those things were so. Therefore many of\nthem believed.\u201d\nBrother P has failed to see the vital importance of the question.\nHe has not felt the burden pressing him to search diligently, inde-\npendent of any man, to find out what is truth. He has thought too\nmuch of Elder P, and has not felt the necessity of learning of One\nwho is meek and lowly of heart. He has not been teachable, but\nself-confident. Our Saviour has no words of commendation for those\nwho are slow of heart to believe in these last days, any more than\nHe had for doubting Thomas, who boasted that he would not believe\n610\nAccountability for Light Received 611\nupon the evidence which the disciples rehearsed, and which they\ncredited, that Christ had indeed risen and appeared to them. Said\nThomas: \u201cExcept I shall see in His hands the print of the nails,\u201d\n\u201cand thrust my hand into His side, I will not believe.\u201d Christ granted\nThomas the evidence that he had declared he must have; but He\nreprovingly said to him: \u201cBe not faithless, but believing.\u201d Thomas\nacknowledged himself convinced. Jesus said unto him: \u201cThomas,\nbecause thou hast seen Me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that\nhave not seen, and yet have believed.\u201d\nBrother P\u2019s position has made him a weak man. He remained\nfor quite a length of time warring against nearly everything but the\nSabbath. At the same time he was fellowshiping commandment\nbreakers, being still claimed by the Adventists who were in bitter\nopposition to the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. He was in\nno condition to help them because he was in a state of indecision\nhimself. His influence has rather confirmed many in their unbelief. [697]\nWith all the help, evidence, and encouragement that he has had, his\nstanding back has displeased the Lord, while it has strengthened the\nhands of those who were fighting against God by their opposition to\nthe truth.\nBrother P might now be a strong man possessing influence with\nGod\u2019s people in Maine and esteemed highly in love for his works\u2019\nsake. But he inclines to the idea that his backwardness is a special\nvirtue, rather than a sin of which he must repent. He has been very\nslow to learn the lessons which God has intended to teach him. He\nhas not been an apt scholar, and has not had a growth and experi-\nence in present truth, which would qualify him to bear the weight\nof responsibility that he might now bear had he diligently improved\nupon all the light given. I was shown a time when Brother P began\nto make an effort to subdue himself and restrain his appetite; then\nhe could the more easily be patient. He had been easily excited,\npassionate, irritable, depressed in spirit. His eating and drinking had\nvery much to do in keeping him in this state. The lower passions\nbore sway, predominating over the higher powers of the mind. Tem-\nperance would do much for Brother P; and more physical exercise\nand labor is necessary for his health. As he made efforts to control\nhimself, he began to grow, but did not receive that blessing in his\n612 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nefforts to improve that he would have received had they been made\nat an earlier period.\nInstead of gathering with Christ into the truth, he too long drew\nback; he would not advance himself and stood directly in the way\nof the advancement of others, thus scattering abroad. His influence\nhas stood directly in the way of the progress of the work which God\nsent His servants to do.\nBrother P\u2019s ideas of order and organization have been in direct\nopposition to God\u2019s plan of order. There is order in heaven, and it is\nto be imitated by those upon earth who are heirs of salvation. The[698]\nnearer mortals attain to the order and arrangement of heaven, the\nnearer are they brought to that acceptable state before God which\nwill make them subjects of the heavenly kingdom and give them that\nfitness for translation from earth to heaven which Enoch possessed\npreparatory to his translation.\nBrother P should be guarded. There is a lack of order in his\norganization. He has not been in harmony with that restraint, that\ncare and diligence, which are necessary in order to preserve harmony\nand union of action. His experience, his education in religious things\nfor years past, has been a great detriment to his dear children and\nespecially to God\u2019s people. The obligations which Heaven has\nimposed upon a father, and especially upon a minister, he has not\nrealized. A man who has but a feeble sense of his responsibility as\na father to encourage and enforce order, discipline, and obedience\nwill fail as a minister and as a shepherd of the flock. The same lack\nwhich characterizes his management at home in his family will be\nseen in a more public capacity in the church of God. Wrongs will\nexist uncorrected because of the unpleasant results which attend\nreproof and earnest appeal.\nA great reform is needed in Brother P\u2019s family. God is not\npleased with their present state of disorder, their having their own\nway, following their own course of action. This condition of things\nin his family is destined to counteract his influence wherever he is\nknown. It also has the effect to discourage those who have a will to\nhelp him in the support of his family. This lack is an injury to the\ncause. Brother P does not restrain his children. God is not pleased\nwith their disorderly, boisterous ways, their unrefined deportment.\nAll this is the result of, or the curse that follows, the unabridged\nAccountability for Light Received 613\nliberty which Adventists have claimed that it was their blessed priv-\nilege to enjoy. Brother and Sister P have desired the salvation of\ntheir children, but I saw that God would not work a miracle in their [699]\nconversion while there were duties resting upon the parents of which\nthey have but little sense. God has left a work for these parents to\ndo which they have thrown back upon Him to do for them. When\nBrother and Sister P feel the burden that they ought to feel for their\nchildren, they will unite their efforts to establish order, discipline,\nand wholesome restraint in their family.\nBrother P, you have been slothful in bearing the burdens which\nevery father should bear in his family; and, as the result, the burden\nwhich has been left for the mother to bear has been very heavy. You\nhave been too willing to excuse yourself from care and burdens at\nhome and abroad. When, in the fear of God, with solemnity of mind\nin view of the judgment, you resolutely take the burden that Heaven\nhas designed you should take, and when you have done all that you\ncan on your part, then you can pray understandingly, with the Spirit,\nand in faith, for God to do that work for your children which it is\nbeyond the power of man to perform.\nBrother P has not made a judicious use of means. Wise judgment\nhas not influenced him as much as have the voices and desires of\nhis children. He does not place the estimate that he should upon the\nmeans in his hands and expend it cautiously for the most needful\narticles, for the very things he must have for comfort and health.\nThe entire family need to improve in this respect. Many things\nare needed in the family for convenience and comfort. The lack of\nappreciating order and system in the arrangement of family matters\nleads to destructiveness and working to great disadvantage. Every\nmember of the family should realize that a responsibility rests upon\nhim individually to do his part in adding to the comfort, order, and\nregularity of the family. One should not work against another. All\nshould unitedly engage in the good work of encouraging one another;\nthey should exercise gentleness, forbearance, and patience, speak in\nlow, calm tones, shunning confusion, and each doing his utmost to [700]\nlighten the burdens of the mother. Things should no longer be left\nat loose ends, all excusing themselves from duty, leaving others to\ndo that which they can and should do themselves. These things may\nbe trifles; but when all are put together, they make great disorder\n614 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nand bring down the frown of God. It is the neglect of the littles, the\ntrifles, that poisons life\u2019s happiness. A faithful performance of the\nlittles composes the sum of happiness to be realized in this life. He\nthat is faithful in little is faithful also in much. He that is unfaithful\nor unjust in small matters will be in greater matters. Each member\nof the family should understand just the part he is expected to act in\nunion with the others. All, from the child six years old and upward,\nshould understand that it is required of them to bear their share of\nlife\u2019s burdens.\nThere are important lessons for these children to learn, and they\ncan learn them better now than at a later period. God will work\nfor these dear children in union with the wisely directed efforts of\ntheir parents and will bring them to become learners in the school of\nChrist. Jesus would have these children separate from the vanities of\nthe world, leave the pleasures of sin, and choose the path of humble\nobedience. If they will now heed the gracious invitation, accept\nJesus as their Saviour, and follow on to know the Lord, He will\ncleanse them from their sins and impart to them grace and strength.\nDear Brother P, the lessons which you have learned amid the\ndistracting influences that have existed in Maine have been exceed-\ningly injurious to your family. You have not been as circumspect in\nyour conversation as God requires you to be. You have not dwelt\nupon the truth in your family, diligently teaching its principles and\nthe commandments of God unto your children when you rise up and\nwhen you sit down, when you go out and when you come in. You[701]\nhave not appreciated your work as a father or as a minister.\nYou have not zealously performed your duty to your children.\nYou have not devoted sufficient time to family prayer, and you have\nnot required the presence of the entire household. The meaning of\n\u201chusband\u201d is house band. All members of the family center in the\nfather. He is the lawmaker, illustrating in his own manly bearing\nthe sterner virtues, energy, integrity, honesty, patience, courage,\ndiligence, and practical usefulness. The father is in one sense the\npriest of the household, laying upon the altar of God the morning\nand evening sacrifice. The wife and children should be encouraged\nto unite in this offering and also to engage in the song of praise.\nMorning and evening the father, as priest of the household, should\nconfess to God the sins committed by himself and his children\nAccountability for Light Received 615\nthrough the day. Those sins which have come to his knowledge,\nand also those which are secret, of which God\u2019s eye alone has taken\ncognizance, should be confessed. This rule of action, zealously\ncarried out by the father when he is present, or by the mother when\nhe is absent, will result in blessings to the family.\nThe reason why the youth of the present age are not more reli-\ngiously inclined is that their education is defective. True love is not\nexercised toward children when they are allowed to indulge passion,\nor when disobedience of your laws is permitted to go unpunished.\nAs the twig is bent, the tree\u2019s inclined. You love your ease too well.\nYou are not painstaking enough. Constant effort is required, constant\nwatchfulness and earnest, fervent prayer. Keep the mind in a praying\nmood, uplifted to God; be not slothful in business, but fervent in\nspirit, serving the Lord.\nYou have failed in your family to appreciate the sacredness of\nthe Sabbath and to teach it to your children and enjoin upon them [702]\nthe importance of keeping it according to the commandment. Your\nsensibilities are not clear and ready to discern the high standard that\nwe must reach in order to be commandment keepers. But God will\nassist you in your efforts when you take hold of the work earnestly.\nYou should possess perfect control over yourself; then you can have\nbetter success in controlling your children when they are unruly.\nThere is a great work before you to repair past neglects; but you are\nnot required to perform it in your own strength. Ministering angels\nwill aid you in the work. Do not give up the work nor lay aside the\nburden, but take hold of it with a will and repair your long neglect.\nYou must have higher views of God\u2019s claims upon you in regard\nto His holy day. Everything that can possibly be done on the six\ndays which God has given to you, should be done. You should not\nrob God of one hour of holy time. Great blessings are promised to\nthose who place a high estimate upon the Sabbath and realize the\nobligations resting upon them in regard to its observance: \u201cIf thou\nturn away thy foot from the Sabbath [from trampling upon it, setting\nit at nought], from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the\nSabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor\nHim, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure,\nnor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the\nLord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth,\n616 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nand feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of\nthe Lord hath spoken it.\u201d\nWhen the Sabbath commences, we should place a guard upon\nourselves, upon our acts and our words, lest we rob God by appro-\npriating to our own use that time which is strictly the Lord\u2019s. We\nshould not do ourselves, nor suffer our children to do, any manner of\nour own work for a livelihood, or anything which could have been\ndone on the six working days. Friday is the day of preparation. Time\ncan then be devoted to making the necessary preparation for the[703]\nSabbath and to thinking and conversing about it. Nothing which\nwill in the sight of Heaven be regarded as a violation of the holy\nSabbath should be left unsaid or undone, to be said or done upon the\nSabbath. God requires not only that we refrain from physical labor\nupon the Sabbath, but that the mind be disciplined to dwell upon sa-\ncred themes. The fourth commandment is virtually transgressed by\nconversing upon worldly things or by engaging in light and trifling\nconversation. Talking upon anything or everything which may come\ninto the mind is speaking our own words. Every deviation from right\nbrings us into bondage and condemnation.\nBrother P, you should discipline yourself to discern the sacred-\nness of the Sabbath of the fourth commandment and should labor to\nraise the standard in your family and wherever you have, by example,\nlowered it among God\u2019s people. You should counteract the influence\nyou have cast in this respect, by changing your words and actions.\nYou have frequently failed to \u201cremember the Sabbath day, to keep it\nholy;\u201d you have often forgotten, and have spoken your own words\nupon God\u2019s sanctified day. You have been unguarded, and have upon\nthe Sabbath joined with the unconsecrated in conversation upon the\ncommon topics of the day, such as gains and losses, stocks, crops,\nand provisions. In this your example injures your influence. You\nshould reform.\nThose who are not fully converted to the truth frequently let their\nminds run freely upon worldly business, and, although they may rest\nfrom physical toil upon the Sabbath, their tongues speak out what is\nin their minds; hence these words concerning cattle, crops, losses,\nand gains. All this is Sabbath breaking. If the mind is running upon\nworldly matters, the tongue will reveal it, for out of the abundance\nof the heart the mouth speaketh.\nAccountability for Light Received 617\nThe example of ministers especially should be circumspect in [704]\nthis respect. Upon the Sabbath they should conscientiously restrict\nthemselves to conversation upon religious themes\u2014to present truth,\npresent duty, the Christian\u2019s hopes and fears, trials, conflicts, and\nafflictions; to overcoming at last, and the reward to be received.\nMinisters of Jesus should stand as reprovers to those who fail\nto remember the Sabbath to keep it holy. They should kindly and\nsolemnly reprove those who engage in worldly conversation upon\nthe Sabbath and at the same time claim to be Sabbathkeepers. They\nshould encourage devotion to God upon His holy day.\nNone should feel at liberty to spend sanctified time in an un-\nprofitable manner. It is displeasing to God for Sabbathkeepers to\nsleep during much of the Sabbath. They dishonor their Creator in so\ndoing, and, by their example, say that the six days are too precious\nfor them to spend in resting. They must make money, although it\nbe by robbing themselves of needed sleep, which they make up by\nsleeping away holy time. They then excuse themselves by saying:\n\u201cThe Sabbath was given for a day of rest. I will not deprive myself of\nrest to attend meeting, for I need rest.\u201d Such make a wrong use of the\nsanctified day. They should, upon that day especially, interest their\nfamilies in its observance and assemble at the house of prayer with\nthe few or with the many, as the case may be. They should devote\ntheir time and energies to spiritual exercises, that the divine influence\nresting upon the Sabbath may attend them through the week. Of all\nthe days in the week, none are so favorable for devotional thoughts\nand feelings as the Sabbath.\nAll heaven was represented to me as beholding and watching\nupon the Sabbath those who acknowledge the claims of the fourth\ncommandment and are observing the Sabbath. Angels were marking\ntheir interest in, and high regard for, this divine institution. Those [705]\nwho sanctified the Lord God in their hearts by a strictly devotional\nframe of mind, and who sought to improve the sacred hours in\nkeeping the Sabbath to the best of their ability, and to honor God\nby calling the Sabbath a delight\u2014these the angels were specially\nblessing with light and health, and special strength was given them.\nBut, on the other hand, the angels were turning from those who\nfailed to appreciate the sacredness of God\u2019s sanctified day, and\nwere removing from them their light and their strength. I saw them\n618 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\novershadowed with a cloud, desponding, and frequently sad. They\nfelt a lack of the Spirit of God.\nDear Brother P, you should at all times be circumspect in your\nconversation. Has God called you to be a representative of Christ\nupon earth, in His stead beseeching sinners to be reconciled to God?\nThis is a solemn, exalted work. When you cease speaking in the desk,\nthat work is but just begun. You are not released from responsibilities\nwhen out of meeting, but should still maintain your consecration to\nthe work of saving souls. You are to be a living epistle, known and\nread of all men. Ease is not to be consulted. Pleasure is not to be\nthought of. The salvation of souls is the all-important theme. It is to\nthis work that the minister of the gospel of Christ is called. He must\nmaintain good works out of meeting and adorn his profession by his\ngodly conversation and circumspect deportment. Frequently, after\nyour pulpit labor is over and you are seated with company around the\nfireside, you have, by your unconsecrated conversation, counteracted\nyour efforts in the pulpit. You must live out what you preach as duty\nto others, and must take upon yourself, as you never yet have done,\nthe burden of the work, the weight of responsibility which should\nrest upon every minister of Christ. Confirm the labor bestowed in\nthe desk by following it up with private effort. Engage in judicious\nconversation upon present truth, candidly ascertaining the state of[706]\nmind of those present, and in the fear of God making a practical\napplication of important truth to the cases of those with whom you\nare associated. You have failed to be instant in season, out of season,\nto reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine.\nAs a watchman upon the walls of Zion, constant watchfulness\nis necessary. Your vigilance must not abate. Educate yourself to be\nable to appeal to families around the fireside. You can accomplish\neven more in this direction than by your pulpit labors alone. Watch\nfor souls as one that must give an account. Give no occasion for\nunbelievers to charge you with remissness in this duty, by neglecting\nto appeal to them personally. Talk with them faithfully, and beseech\nthem to yield to the truth. \u201cFor we are unto God a sweet savor of\nChrist, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: to the one\nwe are the savor of death unto death, and to the other the savor of\nlife unto life.\u201d As the apostle views the magnitude of the work and\nthe weighty responsibilities resting upon the minister, he exclaims:\nAccountability for Light Received 619\n\u201cAnd who is sufficient for these things? For we are not as many,\nwhich corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in\nthe sight of God speak we in Christ.\u201d\nThose who corrupt the word, handing out wheat and chaff, or\nanything that they may deem gospel, while they oppose the com-\nmandments of God, cannot appreciate the feelings of the apostle\nas he trembled under the weight of the solemn work, and of his\nresponsibility as a minister of Christ, having the destiny of souls\nfor whom Christ died resting upon him. In the estimation of self-\nmade ministers it will take but a small pattern to fill the bill and\nmake a minister. But the apostle placed a high estimate upon the\nqualifications necessary to make a minister.\nThe deportment of a minister while in the desk should be cir-\ncumspect, not careless. He should not be negligent in regard to [707]\nhis attitude. He should possess order and refinement in the highest\nsense. God requires this of those who accept so responsible a work,\nthat of receiving the words from His mouth and speaking them to\nthe people, warning and reproving, correcting and comforting, as\nthe case may require. God\u2019s representatives upon earth should be\nin daily communion with Him. Their words should be select, their\nspeech sound. The haphazard words frequently used by ministers\nwho preach not the gospel in sincerity should be forever discarded.\nI was shown, Brother P, that you were naturally irritable, easily\nprovoked, and that you had lacked patience and forbearance. If your\ncourse was questioned, or you were urged to take your position upon\nthe truth, you felt too much that you would not be hurried. You\nwould not move a step because others desired you to do so. You\nwould take your time. Should your hearers pursue the same course,\nyou would consider them blameworthy. If all should do as you have\ndone, God\u2019s people would require a temporal millennium in which to\nmake the needed preparations for the judgment. God has mercifully\nborne with your backwardness; but it will not answer for others to\nfollow your example, for you are now weak and deficient where you\nmight be strong and well qualified for the work.\nBrother R could effect but little for you. His labors were unwisely\ndirected. He erred in especially interesting himself for those who\nthought they should become teachers. Had he not touched the case\nof a minister in Maine, and had he labored in new fields where\n620 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nthere had been no Adventists, many would have been brought to the\nknowledge of the truth. Brother S has been advancing slowly and\noccupying a position more pleasing to God in regard to patience,\nforbearance, and endurance; and yet there is a much greater work\nto be done for him before he can make a successful minister in the\ncause and advance the work of God.\nBrother R zealously interested himself in your case, but you[708]\nrefused to be helped by him. Time and strength were devoted to you;\nand matters were shaped for your special benefit to remove your\nprejudice and win you to accept the truth, until your indolence and\nunbelief exhausted the patience of Brother R. Then the character\nof his labor changed, and he pressed you to come to a decision\nand move out upon the light and evidence you had received. This\nearnest effort on his part you termed crowding and jamming you.\nYour mulish temperament was manifested; you rose up against this\ndealing and rejected the efforts he made to help you. Here you\ninjured yourself, disheartened Brother R, and displeased God. Your\nfeelings toward Brother R were not Christian. You gloried in your\nresistance of his efforts in your behalf. The Lord blessed the labors\nof Brother R in raising up a people in the State of Maine. This labor\nwas hard and trying, and you did your share in making it so. You did\nnot realize how hard you were making the work for those whom God\nhad sent to present the truth to the people. They were exhausting\ntheir energies to bring the people to the point of decision in regard\nto the truth, while you and others of the ministers stood directly in\ntheir way. God was working through His ministers to draw to the\ntruth, and Satan was working through you and other ministers to\ndiscourage and counteract their labor. The very men who professed\nto be watchmen, and who, if they had stood in the counsel of God,\nwould have been the first to receive the word of warning and give it\nto the people, were among the last to accept the truth. The people\nwere in advance of their teachers. They received the warning even\nbefore the watchmen because the watchmen were unfaithful and\nwere sleeping at their post.\nBrother P, you should have had feelings of brotherly sympathy\nand love for Brother R, for he deserved this from you rather than\none word of censure. You should severely censure your own course[709]\nbecause you were found fighting against God. But you have amused\nAccountability for Light Received 621\nyourself and others at the expense of Brother R by relating his efforts\nfor you and your resistance of his labors, and have enjoyed a hearty\nlaugh over the matter.\nIt becomes every minister of Christ to use sound speech, which\ncannot be condemned. I was shown that a solemn work is to be\naccomplished for the ministers of Christ. This cannot be done with-\nout effort on their part. They must feel that they have a work to do\nin their own cases which no one else can do for them. They must\nseek to gain the qualifications necessary, in order to become able\nministers of Christ, that in the day of God they may stand acquitted,\nfree from the blood of souls, having done all their duty in the fear\nof God. As their reward, the faithful undershepherds will hear from\nthe Chief Shepherd: \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant.\u201d He\nwill then place the crown of glory upon their heads and bid them\nenter into the joy of their Lord. What is that joy? It is beholding\nwith Christ the redeemed saints, reviewing with Him their travail\nfor souls, their self-denial and self-sacrifice, their giving up of ease,\nof worldly gain, and every earthly inducement, and choosing the\nreproach, the suffering, the self-abasement, the wearing labor, and\nthe anguish of spirit as men would oppose the counsel of God against\ntheir own souls; it is calling to remembrance the chastening of their\nsouls before God, their weeping between the porch and the altar, and\ntheir becoming a spectacle unto the world, to angels, and to men.\nAll this is then ended, and the fruits of their labors are seen; souls\nare saved through their efforts in Christ. The ministers who have\nbeen co-workers with Christ enter into the joy of their Lord and are\nsatisfied.\n\u201cLooking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who\nfor the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising [710]\nthe shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\nFor consider Him that endured such contradiction of sinners against\nHimself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. Ye have not yet\nresisted unto blood, striving against sin.\u201d Ministers are too forgetful\nof the Author of their salvation. They think they endure much, when\nthey bear and suffer but little. God will work for ministers if they\nwill let Him work for them. But if they feel that they are all right\nand do not need a thorough conversion, and will not see themselves\n622 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2\nand come up to the measurement of God, He can do better without\ntheir labors than with them.\nGod requires ministers to come up to the standard, to show\nthemselves approved unto God, workmen that need not be ashamed.\nIf they refuse this strict discipline, God will release them and select\nmen who will not rest until they are thoroughly furnished unto all\ngood works. Our hearts are naturally sinful, and slothful in the\nservice of Christ; and we need to be guarded constantly, or we shall\nfail to endure hardness as good soldiers of Christ; and we shall not\nfeel the necessity of aiming vigorous blows against besetting sins,\nbut will readily yield to the suggestions of Satan and raise a standard\nfor ourselves rather than accept the pure and elevated standard that\nGod has raised for us.\nI saw that the Sabbathkeeping ministers of Maine have failed\nto become Bible students. They have not felt the necessity of a\ndiligent study of the word of God for themselves, that they might\nbe thoroughly furnished unto all good works; neither have they\nfelt the necessity of urging the close searching of the Scriptures\nupon their hearers. If there had not been one Seventh-day Adventist\nminister in Maine to oppose the counsel of God, all that has been\naccomplished might have been done with one half the effort that\nhas been made, and the people might have been brought out of\ntheir distracted, confused state into order, and now have been strong[711]\nenough to stand against opposing influences. Many places which\nhave not yet been entered might have been visited and successful\nlabor bestowed, which would have brought many to a knowledge of\nthe truth.\nMuch of the labor which has been spent in Maine has been for\nSeventh-day Adventist ministers, to bring them into a right posi-\ntion. It has required hard labor to counteract the influence which\nthey exerted while opposing the counsel of God against their own\nsouls and standing in the way of sinners. They would not enter\nin themselves, and them that would, they hindered by precept and\nexample. A mistake has been made in entering fields where there are\nAdventists who do not as a general thing feel any necessity of being\nhelped, but who think themselves in a good condition and able to\nteach others. The laborers are few, and their strength must be spent\nto the best possible advantage. Much more can be done in the State\nAccountability for Light Received 623\nof Maine, as a general thing, where there is not one Adventist. New\nfields should be entered; and the time that has hitherto been spent\nin wearing labor for Adventists who have no wish to learn should\nbe devoted to these new fields, to going out into the highways and\nhedges, and working for the conversion of unbelievers. If Adventists\nwill come and hear, let them come. Leave the way open for them to\ncome if they choose.\nAppendix[712]\nPage 400\u2014The admonition in the personal testimony addressed\nto Brother and Sister E, that \u201ceggs should not be placed upon your\ntable,\u201d has by some been given a general application. That this was\nnot intended as a general teaching for families of normal circum-\nstances is made clear not only by the setting of the statement itself,\nbut also by no less than three specific published utterances of Ellen\nG. White which would correct any misapplication of this personal\ntestimony. These are found in Testimonies for the Church 7:135\n(1902), The Ministry of Healing, 320 (1905), and Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:162 (1909). We quote the last two statements:\n\u201cIt is true that persons in full flesh and in whom the animal\npassions are strong need to avoid the use of stimulating foods. Espe-\ncially in families of children who are given to sensual habits, eggs\nshould not be used.\u201d\u2014The Ministry of Healing, 320.\n\u201cWhile warnings have been given regarding the dangers of dis-\nease through butter, and the evil of the free use of eggs by small\nchildren, yet we should not consider it a violation of principle to\nuse eggs from hens that are well cared for and suitably fed. Eggs\ncontain properties that are remedial agencies in counteracting certain\npoisons.\u201d\u2014Testimonies for the Church 9:162.\n624",
