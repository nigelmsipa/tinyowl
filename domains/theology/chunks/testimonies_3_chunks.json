Volume Three\nIn 1872, when the first testimony of volume 3 was written, the\nentire denominational effort of Seventh-day Adventists was in the\nUnited States, and largely concentrated in the central and Northeast-\nern States. There were eighty-six ordained and licensed ministers\npreaching the message and supervising the work. We owned and\noperated one publishing house and one small medical institution,\nboth at Battle Creek, Michigan. For a quarter of a century God had\nled His people as rapidly as they could advance intelligently and in\nunison, first into a clear understanding of the doctrines taught in the\nword, then into a sense of their responsibility to publish the message,\nthen to organization of the church, and then to better ways of living.\nBut there were new experiences and great opportunities for advance\nbefore the church. The counsels of volume 3 pave the way for these.\nThrough the preceding twenty-five critical years, elder James\nWhite had been the leader of the new cause. He had started the\npublishing work, labored tirelessly for church organization, built up\nthe medical work, and had stood at the head in both administrative\nand editorial lines. He had pioneered the way. With his keen business\nforesight and his entire devotion to the growing church, he was\nrecognized as the leader. This being the case, it was but natural\nthat others should fail to see that they should step in and assume\nresponsibility in the various enterprises of the growing denomination.\nThis volume opens with a discussion of this problem and with an\nappeal for burden bearers to shoulder the work at the headquarters,\nrelieving James White, who was breaking under the load. Again and\nagain, through the volume, reference is made to the expanding work,\nthe enlarging responsibilities, and the need of younger men to take\nhold and bear the burdens. The hazards of looking to one man as the\ngreat leader were clearly enunciated.\nThe experiences of this period are akin to that of the eagle\nteaching its young to fly\u2014first bearing the fledgling upon its back[4]\nand then leaving it to develop its strength, but with the parent ever\nvi\nTimes of Volume Three vii\nnear enough to render aid when needed. James White\u2019s own failing\nhealth, his conviction that others should be stepping in to lift the\nburdens, and his frequent calls to duty elsewhere, all tended to sep-\narate him from the administrative interests at Battle Creek. While\nElder and Mrs. White continued to maintain their home midway\nbetween the sanitarium and the publishing house in the headquarters\ncity, we find them often in distant parts. In the summers of 1872 and\n1873 they spent periods of rest in the mountains of Colorado, and\nwere also for some months in California. A still longer period was\nspent by them on the West Coast in 1874, at which time Elder White\nbegan the publication of the Signs of the Times. Thus others were\nforced to assume responsibilities of leadership at the headquarters,\nand the work gained strength.\nThis was a critical period, too, for, during the time when the\nchurch was finding its way in the question of leadership and organi-\nzation, some were inclined to unduly stress individual independence\nand were in danger of repeating the experience of Korah, Dathan, and\nAbiram in rebellion against properly constituted authority. Scattered\nthrough volume 3 are counsels providing a definite steadying influ-\nence through these experiences. Here and there are enumerated in\nmagnificent statements some of the great principles of organization\nand leadership.\nThe three-year period of the times of this volume also marked\nthe close of the first decade in the teaching and practice of health\nreform. Counsel was given to guard against extremes on the one\nhand and indifference on the other. Again and again, in general\narticles and personal testimonies, Ellen White pointed to the great\nprinciples of temperance and right living, and called the people to\nadvance in their new and helpful health reform experience.\nAll this was laying the foundation stones for wider expansion. [5]\nIt was in this period that the believers began to get a glimpse of\nthe entire world as the field of labor. It was a staggering view. It\npresented a challenge. They did not then see the significance of\nthe little church school started in Battle Creek by Goodloe H. Bell,\nan experienced teacher who had accepted Adventism through his\ncontacts at the sanitarium as a patient. It was in the early summer\nof 1872 that he began this schoolwork. A little later that year a\nbeginning was made in laying plans for a more advanced school to\nviii Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ntrain workers. In December, as Testimony No. 22 reached the hands\nof our people, they found that it opened with an appeal for such a\nschool and instruction as to how it should be conducted. \u201cProper\nEducation\u201d Is the title of the thirty-page article setting forth the great\nbasic vision on the training of our youth. How could we compass\nthe world with our message unless we had an educated ministry?\nHow could there be an educated ministry unless we had a school?\nRising to heed the instruction and meet the challenge set forth so\nclearly in this volume in pages 131-160, our forefathers established\nan educational system beginning with Battle Creek College. Its main\nbuilding was dedicated on January 4, 1875.\nOnly a few months before this epic occasion, elder John N.\nAndrews, one of our leading ministers, was sent to Switzerland to\npioneer the heralding of the message in Europe. In the counsels\nof a few months earlier, Ellen White had written of the need of\nmissionaries \u201cto go to other nations to preach the truth in a guarded,\ncareful manner.\u201d\u2014Page 204. With the sailing of Elder Andrews in\nthe autumn of 1874, Seventh-day Adventists began to turn their eyes\nto other lands.\nThe timing of the messages of instruction and counsel which\nhave come to us down through the years is interesting. From the year\n1859, Seventh-day Adventists had made advancement in assuming\ntheir obligations to God as they discerned their stewardship in sys-\ntematic benevolence; but they did not at the outset perceive the full\nobligation of the tithe, the tenth of the income. Now in two articles,\nin the heart of volume 3, the basis of reckoning the tithe obligation[6]\nwas clarified as the messenger of the Lord wrote of a \u201ctenth of the\u201d\n\u201cincome\u201d and of the \u201cnine tenths\u201d which remained. Not until 1879\nwas this broader concept of systematic benevolence to become a part\nof denominational policy, but that step which has done so much to\nassure a steady and much-needed income for a growing work had its\nroots in these counsels of the two chapters, \u201cTithes and Offerings\u201d\nand \u201cSystematic Benevolence,\u201d which were published early in 1875.\nThe fuller concept of true stewardship was discerned as we were\nled to see that the calls for benevolence were designed by God, not\nmerely to raise money, but as a means of developing and perfecting\ncharacter in the giver.\nTimes of Volume Three ix\nAs might be expected, an aggressive evangelistic program led\nto conflict with other religious groups, who often challenged us to\ndebate and argument. Ten years earlier Moses Hull, one of our min-\nisters, had lost his way in placing himself on the enemy\u2019s ground by\nsuch discussions. Now repeated counsels presented guidance as they\npointed out the dangers and the small fruitage of such contentious\nefforts. V olume 3 abounds in such counsels.\nSo the topics of this volume are varied, ranging from counsel to\nthe wealthy farmer and his uneducated wife to instruction for the\nminister and the executive. The general articles fill the larger part of\nthis volume. Here and there are found personal messages, published\nfor the benefit of all, because, as Ellen White wrote, so many of\nthem have to do with experiences \u201cwhich in many respects represent\nthe cases of others.\u201d\nA few outstanding revelations form the basis of the larger part\nof this volume. During this period the outstanding visions were\nless frequent, but more comprehensive. Again and again reference\nis made to the comprehensive visions of December 10, 1871, and\nJanuary 3, 1875. The latter is described by James White in a footnote\non page 570. The circumstances of the first will be described more\nfully here: it was at Bordoville, Vermont, that this vision was given. [7]\nA report of the meeting held at that place, December 9 and 10, was\nsent to the Review by Elder A. C. Bourdeau, in whose house it\nwas held. From it we learn that Mrs. White had labored \u201cespecially\nfor the church.\u201d At one evening meeting \u201cspecial testimonies were\ngiven to individuals present; and as these were endorsed [by those\nspoken to], light and freedom broke in.\u201d Sunday afternoon two sons\nof one of the believers and the wife of one of them came to bid Mrs.\nWhite good-by. They had been \u201cin a backslidden state.\u201d Then elder\nbourdeau gives a vivid picture of what took place:\n\u201cAt this point, Sister White felt the real burden of their cases, and\na special yearning after them for their salvation, and gave them rich\ninstructions. She then kneeled down with them and prayed for them\nwith great earnestness, faith, and tenacity, that they might return unto\nthe Lord. They yielded and prayed, promising to serve the Lord.\nThe Spirit of the Lord drew nearer and nearer. Sister White was free,\nand soon, unexpectedly to all, she was in vision. She remained in\nthis condition fifteen minutes.\nx Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\n\u201cThe news spread, and soon the house was crowded. Sinners\ntrembled, believers wept, and backsliders returned to God. The work\nwas not confined to those present, as we have since learned. Some\nwho had remained at home were powerfully convicted. They saw\nthemselves as they had never done before. The angel of God was\nshaking the place. The shortness of time, the terrors and nearness of\ncoming judgments and the time of trouble, the worldly-mindedness\nof the church, their lack of brotherly love, and their state of unreadi-\nness to meet the Lord, were strongly impressed upon the minds of\nall.\u201d\u2014The Review and Herald, December 26, 1871.\nSuch were the times of volume 3.\nThe Trustees of the Ellen G. White Publications.\nNumber Twenty-One\u2014Testimony for the [8]\n[9]Church\nChapter 1\u2014An Appeal for Burden Bearers\nDear Brethren and Sisters,\nI feel compelled at this time to fulfill a long-neglected duty.\nFor years previous to my husband\u2019s dangerous and protracted\nillness he performed more labor than two men should have done in\nthe same time. He saw no time when he could be relieved from the\npressure of care and obtain mental and physical rest. Through the\ntestimonies he was warned of his danger. I was shown that he was\ndoing too much brain labor. I will here copy a written testimony,\ngiven as far back as August 26, 1855:\n\u201cWhile at Paris, Maine, I was shown that my husband\u2019s health\nwas in a critical condition, that his anxiety of mind had been too\nmuch for his strength. When the present truth was first published,\nhe put forth great exertion and labored with but little encouragement\nor help from his brethren. From the first he has taken burdens upon\nhim which were too taxing for his physical strength.\n\u201cThese burdens, if equally shared, need not have been so wearing.\nWhile my husband took much responsibility, some of his brethren in\nthe ministry were not willing to take any. And those who shunned\nburdens and responsibilities did not realize his burdens, and were not\nas interested in the advancement of the work and cause of God as they\nshould have been. My husband felt this lack and laid his shoulder[10]\nunder burdens that were too heavy and which nearly crushed him.\nAs the result of these extra efforts more souls will be saved, but it is\nthese efforts that have told upon his constitution and deprived him\nof strength. I have been shown that he should in a great measure lay\naside his anxiety; God is willing that he should be released from such\nwearing labor, and that he should spend more time in the study of\nthe Scriptures and in the society of his children, seeking to cultivate\ntheir minds.\n\u201cI saw that it is not our duty to perplex ourselves with individual\ntrials. Such mental labor endured for others\u2019 wrongs should be\navoided. My husband can continue to labor with all his energies, as\n12\nAppeal for Burden Bearers 13\nhe has done, and as the result go down into the grave, and his labors\nbe lost to the cause of God; or he can now be released, while he has\nsome strength left, and last longer, and his labors be more efficient.\u201d\nI will now copy from a testimony given in 1859: \u201cIn my last\nvision I was shown that the Lord would have my husband give\nhimself more to the study of the Scriptures, that he may be qualified\nto labor more effectually in word and doctrine, both in speaking\nand in writing. I saw that in the past we had exhausted our energies\nthrough much anxiety and care to bring the church into a right\nposition. Such wearing labor in various places, bearing the burdens\nof the church, is not required; for the church should bear their own\nburdens. Our work is to instruct them in God\u2019s word, to urge upon\nthem the necessity of experimental religion, and to define as clearly\nas possible the correct position in regard to the truth. God would have\nus raise our voices in the great congregation upon points of present\ntruth which are of vital importance. These should be presented with\nclearness and with decision, and should also be written out, that the\nsilent messengers may bring them before the people everywhere. A\nmore thorough consecration to the essential work is required on our\npart; we must be earnest to live in the light of God\u2019s countenance.\nIf our minds were less occupied with the trials of the church they\nwould be more free to be exercised upon Bible subjects; and a closer [11]\napplication to Bible truth would accustom the mind to run in that\nchannel, and we would thus be better qualified for the important\nwork devolving upon us.\n\u201cI was shown that God did not lay upon us such heavy burdens\nas we have borne in the past. It is our duty to talk to the church and\nshow them the necessity of working for themselves. They have been\ncarried too much. The reason why we should not be required to take\nupon ourselves heavy burdens and engage in perplexing labor is that\nthe Lord has work of another character for us to perform. He would\nnot have us exhaust our physical and mental energies, but hold them\nin reserve, that upon special occasions, whenever help is actually\nneeded, our voices may be heard.\n\u201cI saw that important moves would be made, in which our influ-\nence would be demanded to lead out; that influences would arise,\nand errors would occasionally be brought into the church, and that\nthen our influence would be required. But if exhausted by previ-\n14 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nous labors, we would not possess that calm judgment, discretion,\nand self-control necessary for the important occasion in which God\nwould have us act a prominent part.\n\u201cSatan has crippled our efforts by so affecting the church as to\ncall forth from us almost double labor to cut our way through the\ndarkness and unbelief. These efforts to set things in order in the\nchurches have exhausted our strength, and lassitude and debility have\nfollowed. I saw that we have a work to do, but the adversary of souls\nwill resist every effort that we attempt to make. The people may be\nin a state of backsliding, so that God cannot bless them, and this will\nbe disheartening; but we should not be discouraged. We should do\nour duty in presenting the light, and leave the responsibility with the\npeople.\u201d\nI will here copy from another testimony, written June 6, 1863: \u201cI\nwas shown that our testimony is still needed in the church, that we\nshould labor to save ourselves trials and cares, and that we should[12]\npreserve a devotional frame of mind. It is the duty of those in the\noffice to tax their brains more, and of my husband to tax his less.\nMuch time is spent by him upon various matters which confuse and\nweary his mind, and unfit him for study or for writing, and thus\nprevent his light from shining in the Review as it should.\n\u201cMy husband\u2019s mind should not be crowded and overtaxed. It\nmust have rest, and he must be left free to write and attend to matters\nwhich others cannot do. Those engaged in the office could lift from\nhim a great weight of care if they would dedicate themselves to\nGod and feel a deep interest in the work. No selfish feelings should\nexist among those who labor in the office. It is the work of God\nin which they are engaged, and they are accountable to Him for\ntheir motives and the manner in which this branch of His work is\nperformed. They are required to discipline their minds. Many feel\nthat no blame should be attached to forgetfulness. This is a great\nmistake. Forgetfulness is sin. It leads to many blunders and to much\ndisorder and many wrongs. Things that should be done ought not to\nbe forgotten. The mind must be tasked; it must be disciplined until\nit will remember.\n\u201cMy husband has had much care, and has done many things\nwhich others ought to have done, but which he feared to have them\ndo, lest, in their heedlessness, they should make mistakes not easily\nAppeal for Burden Bearers 15\nremedied, and thus involve losses. This has been a great perplexity\nto his mind. Those who labor in the office should learn. They should\nstudy, and practice, and exercise their own brains; for they have this\nbranch of business alone, while my husband has the responsibility\nof many departments of the work. If a workman makes a failure,\nhe should feel that it rests upon him to repair damages from his\nown purse, and should not allow the office to suffer loss through his\ncarelessness. He should not cease to bear responsibilities, but should\ntry again, avoiding former mistakes. In this way he will learn to take\nthat care which the word of God ever requires, and then he will do\nno more than his duty.\n\u201cMy husband should take time to do those things which his [13]\njudgment tells him would preserve his health. He has thought that\nhe must throw off the burdens and responsibilities which were upon\nhim, and leave the office, or his mind would become a wreck. I\nwas shown that when the Lord released him from his position, he\nwould give him just as clear evidence of his release as he gave him\nwhen He laid the burden of the work upon him. But he has borne\ntoo many burdens, and those laboring with him at the office, and\nalso his ministering brethren, have been too willing that he should\nbear them. They have, as a general thing, stood back from bearing\nburdens, and have sympathized with those who were murmuring\nagainst him, and left him to stand alone while he was bowed down\nbeneath censure, until God has vindicated His own cause. If they\nhad taken their share of the burdens, my husband would have been\nrelieved.\n\u201cI saw that God now requires us to take special care of the health\nHe has given us, for our work is not yet done. Our testimony must\nstill be borne, and will have influence. We should preserve our\nstrength to labor in the cause of God when our labor is needed. We\nshould be careful not to take upon ourselves burdens that others can\nand should bear. We should encourage a cheerful, hopeful, peaceful\nframe of mind; for our health depends upon our so doing. The\nwork that God requires us to do will not prevent our caring for our\nhealth, that we may recover from the effect of overtaxing labor. The\nmore perfect our health, the more perfect will be our labor. When\nwe overtax our strength, and become exhausted, we are liable to\ntake cold, and at such times there is danger of disease assuming a\n16 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ndangerous form. We must not leave the care of ourselves with God,\nwhen He has placed that responsibility upon us.\u201d\nOctober 25, 1869, while at Adams Center, New York, I was\nshown that some ministers among us fail to bear all the responsibil-\nity that God would have them. This lack throws extra labor upon\nthose who are burden bearers, especially upon my husband. Some[14]\nministers fail to move out and venture something in the cause and\nwork of God. Important decisions are to be made; but as mortal\nman cannot see the end from the beginning, some shrink from ven-\nturing and advancing as the providence of God leads. Someone\nmust advance; someone must venture in the fear of God, trusting the\nresult with Him. Those ministers who shun this part of the labor are\nlosing much. They are failing to obtain that experience which God\ndesigned they should have to make them strong, efficient men that\ncan be relied upon in any emergency.\nBrother A, you shrink from running risks. You are not willing to\nventure when you cannot see the way perfectly clear. Yet someone\nmust do this very work; someone must walk by faith, or no advance\nmoves will be made, and nothing will be accomplished. A fear that\nyou will make mistakes and mismoves, and then be blamed, binds\nyou. You excuse yourself from taking responsibility because you\nhave made some mistakes in the past. But you should move accord-\ning to your best judgment, trusting the result with God. Someone\nmust do this, and it is a trying position for anyone. One should\nnot bear all this responsibility alone, but with much reflection and\nearnest prayer, it should be equally shared.\nDuring my husband\u2019s affliction, the Lord tested and proved His\npeople to reveal what was in their hearts; and in so doing He showed\nto them what was undiscovered in themselves that was not according\nto the Spirit of God. The trying circumstances under which we were\nplaced called out from our brethren that which otherwise would\nnever have been revealed. The Lord proved to His people that the\nwisdom of man is foolishness, and that unless they possess firm trust\nand reliance on God, their plans and calculations will prove a failure.\nWe are to learn from all these things. If errors are committed, they\nshould teach and instruct, but not lead to the shunning of burdens\nand responsibilities. Where much is at stake, and where matters\nof vital consequence are to be considered, and important questions\nAppeal for Burden Bearers 17\nsettled, God\u2019s servants should take individual responsibility. They [15]\ncannot lay off the burden and yet do the will of God. Some ministers\nare deficient in the qualifications necessary to build up the churches,\nand they are not willing to wear in the cause of God. They have not\na disposition to give themselves wholly to the work, with their inter-\nest undivided, their zeal unabated, their patience and perseverance\nuntiring. With these qualifications in lively exercise, the churches\nwould be kept in order, and my husband\u2019s labors would not be so\nheavy. All ministers do not constantly bear in mind that the labor\nof all must bear the inspection of the judgment, and that every man\nwill be rewarded as his works have been.\nBrother A, you have a responsibility to bear in regard to the\nHealth Institute. [Later Known as the Battle Creek Sanitarium.]\nYou should ponder, you should reflect. Frequently the time that you\noccupy in reading is the very best time for you to reflect and to study\nwhat must be done to set things in order at the Institute and at the\noffice. My husband takes on these burdens because he sees that the\nwork for these institutions must be done by someone. As others will\nnot lead out, he steps into the gap and supplies the deficiency.\nGod has cautioned and warned my husband in regard to the\npreservation of his strength. I was shown that he was raised up by\nthe Lord, and that he lives as a miracle of mercy\u2014not for the purpose\nof again gathering upon him the burdens under which he once fell,\nbut that the people of God may be benefited by his experience in\nadvancing the general interests of the cause, and in connection with\nthe work the Lord has given me, and the burden He has laid upon\nme to bear.\nBrother A, great care should be exercised by you, especially at\nBattle Creek. In visiting, your conversation should be upon the most\nimportant subjects. Be careful to back up precept by example. This\nis an important post and will require labor. While you are here, you\nshould take time to ponder the many things which need to be done\nand which require solemn reflection, careful attention, and most\nearnest, faithful prayer. You should feel as great an interest in the\nthings relating to the cause, to the work at the Health Institute and at [16]\nthe office of publication, as my husband feels; you should feel that\nthe work is yours. You cannot do the work that God has specially\nqualified my husband to do, neither can he do the work that God\n18 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nhas specially qualified you to do. Yet both of you together, united in\nharmonious labor, you in your office, and my husband in his, can\naccomplish much.\nThe work in which we have a common interest is great; and\nefficient, willing, burden-bearing laborers are few indeed. God will\ngive you strength, my brother, if you will move forward and wait\nupon Him. He will give my husband and myself strength in our\nunited labor, if we do all to His glory, according to our ability and\nstrength to labor. You should be located where you would have a\nmore favorable opportunity to exercise your gift according to the\nability that God has given you. You should lean your whole weight\nupon God and give Him an opportunity to teach, lead, and impress\nyou. You feel a deep interest in the work and cause of God, and you\nshould look to Him for light and guidance. He will give you light.\nBut, as an ambassador of Christ, you are required to be faithful, to\ncorrect wrong in meekness and love, and your efforts will not prove\nunavailing.\nSince my husband has recovered from his feebleness, we have\nlabored earnestly. We have not consulted our own ease or pleasure.\nWe have traveled and labored in camp meetings, and overtaxed\nour strength, so that it has brought upon us debility, without the\nadvantages of rest. During the year 1870 we attended twelve camp\nmeetings. In a number of these meetings, the burden of labor rested\nalmost wholly upon us. We traveled from Minnesota to Maine, and\nto Missouri and Kansas.\nMy husband and I united our efforts to improve the Health Re-\nformer [Now called Good Health.] and make it an interesting and\nprofitable journal, one that would be desired, not only by our people,\nbut by all classes. This was a severe tax upon him. He also made\nvery important improvements in the Review and the Instructor. He[17]\naccomplished the work which should have been shared by three men.\nAnd while all this labor fell upon him in the publishing branch of\nthe work, the business departments at the Health Institute and the\nPublishing Association required the labor of two men to relieve them\nof financial embarrassment.\nUnfaithful men who had been entrusted with the work at the\noffice and at the Institute, had, through selfishness and a lack of\nconsecration, placed matters in the worst possible condition. There\nAppeal for Burden Bearers 19\nwas unsettled business that had to be attended to. My husband\nstepped into the gap and worked with all his energies. He was\nwearing. We could see that he was in danger; but we could not see\nhow he could stop, unless the work in the office should cease. Almost\nevery day some new perplexity would arise, some new difficulty\ncaused by the unfaithfulness of the men who had taken charge of the\nwork. His brain was taxed to the utmost. But the worst perplexities\nare now over, and the work is moving on prosperously.\nAt the General Conference my husband pleaded to be released\nfrom the burdens upon him; but, notwithstanding his pleading, the\nburden of editing the Review and the Reformer was placed upon\nhim, with encouragement that men who would take burdens and\nresponsibilities would be encouraged to settle at Battle Creek. But\nas yet no help has come to lift from him the burdens of the financial\nwork at the office.\nMy husband is fast wearing. We have attended the four Western\ncamp meetings, and our brethren are urging us to attend the Eastern\nmeetings. But we dare not take additional burdens upon us. When\nwe came from the labor of the Western camp meetings in July, 1871,\nwe found a large amount of business that had been left to accumulate\nin my husband\u2019s absence. We have seen no opportunity for rest yet.\nMy husband must be released from the burdens upon him. There are\ntoo many that use his brain instead of using their own. In view of\nthe light which God has been pleased to give us, we plead for you,\nmy brethren, to release my husband. I am not willing to venture the [18]\nconsequences of his going forward and laboring as he has done. He\nserved you faithfully and unselfishly for years, and finally fell under\nthe pressure of the burdens placed upon him. Then his brethren, in\nwhom he had confided, left him. They let him drop into my hands,\nand forsook him. For nearly two years I was his nurse, his attendant,\nhis physician. I do not wish to pass through the experience a second\ntime. Brethren, will you lift the burdens from us, and allow us to\npreserve our strength as God would have us, that the cause at large\nmay be benefited by the efforts we may make in His strength? Or\nwill you leave us to become debilitated so that we will become\nuseless to the cause?\nThe foregoing portion of this appeal was read at the New Hamp-\nshire camp meeting, August, 1871.\n20 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nWhen we returned from Kansas in the autumn of 1870, Brother\nB was at home sick with fever. Sister Van Horn, at this very time,\nwas absent from the office in consequence of fever brought upon her\nby the sudden death of her mother. Brother Smith was also from the\noffice, in Rochester, New York, recovering from a fever. There was\na great amount of unfinished work at the office, yet Brother B left his\npost of duty to gratify his own pleasure. This fact in his experience\nis a sample of the man. Sacred duties rest lightly upon him.\nIt was a great breach of the trust reposed in him to pursue the\ncourse he did. In what marked contrast with this is the life of Christ,\nour Pattern! He was the Son of Jehovah, and the Author of our\nsalvation. He labored and suffered for us. He denied Himself, and\nHis whole life was one continued scene of toil and privation. Had\nHe chosen so to do, He could have passed His days in a world of\nHis own creating, in ease and plenty, and claimed for Himself all the\npleasures and enjoyment the world could give Him. But He did not\nconsider His own convenience. He lived not to please Himself, but\nto do good and lavish His blessings upon others.\nBrother B was sick with fever. His case was critical. In justice\nto the cause of God, I feel compelled to state that his sickness was[19]\nnot the result of unwearied devotion to the interests of the office.\nImprudent exposure on a trip to Chicago, for his own pleasure, was\nthe cause of his long, tedious, suffering sickness. God did not sustain\nhim in leaving the work, when so many who had filled important\npositions in the office were absent. At the very time when he should\nnot have excused himself for an hour, he left his post of duty, and\nGod did not sustain him.\nThere was no period of rest for us, however much we needed\nit. The Review, the Reformer, and the Instructor must be edited.\nMany letters had been laid aside until we should return to examine\nthem. Things were in a sad state at the office. Everything needed\nto be set in order. My husband commenced his labor, and I helped\nhim what I could; but that was but little. He labored unceasingly\nto straighten out perplexing business matters and to improve the\ncondition of our periodicals. He could not depend upon help from\nany of his ministering brethren. His head, heart, and hands were\nfull. He was not encouraged by Brethren A and C, when they\nknew he was standing alone under the burdens at Battle Creek.\nAppeal for Burden Bearers 21\nThey did not stay up his hands. They wrote in a most discouraging\nmanner of their poor health, and that they were in such an exhausted\ncondition that they could not be depended on to accomplish any\nlabor. My husband saw that nothing could be hoped for in that\ndirection. Notwithstanding his double labor through the summer, he\ncould not rest. And, irrespective of his weakness, he reined himself\nup to do the work which others had neglected.\nThe Reformer was about dead. Brother B had urged the extreme\npositions of Dr. Trall. This had influenced the doctor to come out\nin the Reformer stronger than he otherwise would have done, in\ndiscarding milk, sugar, and salt. The position to entirely discontinue\nthe use of these things may be right in its order; but the time had not\ncome to take a general stand upon these points. And those who do\ntake their position, and advocate the entire disuse of milk, butter, and\nsugar, should have their own tables free from these things. Brother B, [20]\neven while taking his stand in the Reformer with Dr. Trall in regard\nto the injurious effects of salt, milk, and sugar, did not practice the\nthings he taught. Upon his own table these things were used daily.\nMany of our people had lost their interest in the Reformer, and\nletters were daily received with this discouraging request: \u201cPlease\ndiscontinue my Reformer.\u201d Letters were received from the West,\nwhere the country is new and fruit scarce, inquiring: \u201cHow do the\nfriends of health reform live at Battle Creek? Do they dispense with\nsalt entirely? If so, we cannot at present adopt the health reform.\nWe can get but little fruit, and we have left off the use of meat, tea,\ncoffee, and tobacco; but we must have something to sustain life.\u201d\nWe had spent some time in the West, and knew the scarcity of\nfruit, and we sympathized with our brethren who were conscien-\ntiously seeking to be in harmony with the body of Sabbathkeeping\nAdventists. They were becoming discouraged, and some were back-\nsliding upon the health reform, fearing that at Battle Creek they were\nradical and fanatical. We could not raise an interest anywhere in\nthe West to obtain subscribers for the Health Reformer. We saw\nthat the writers in the Reformer were going away from the people\nand leaving them behind. If we take positions that conscientious\nChristians, who are indeed reformers, cannot adopt, how can we\nexpect to benefit that class whom we can reach only from a health\nstandpoint?\n22 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nWe must go no faster than we can take those with us whose\nconsciences and intellects are convinced of the truths we advocate.\nWe must meet the people where they are. Some of us have been\nmany years in arriving at our present position in health reform. It is\nslow work to obtain a reform in diet. We have powerful appetites\nto meet; for the world is given to gluttony. If we should allow the\npeople as much time as we have required to come up to the present\nadvanced state in reform, we would be very patient with them, and\nallow them to advance step by step, as we have done, until their[21]\nfeet are firmly established upon the health reform platform. But we\nshould be very cautious not to advance too fast, lest we be obliged\nto retrace our steps. In reforms we would better come one step short\nof the mark than to go one step beyond it. And if there is error at all,\nlet it be on the side next to the people.\nAbove all things, we should not with our pens advocate positions\nthat we do not put to a practical test in our own families, upon\nour own tables. This is dissimulation, a species of hypocrisy. In\nMichigan we can get along better without salt, sugar, and milk than\ncan many who are situated in the Far West or in the far East, where\nthere is a scarcity of fruit. But there are very few families in Battle\nCreek who do not use these articles upon their tables. We know\nthat a free use of these things is positively injurious to health, and,\nin many cases, we think that if they were not used at all, a much\nbetter state of health would be enjoyed. But at present our burden\nis not upon these things. The people are so far behind that we see\nit is all they can bear to have us draw the line upon their injurious\nindulgences and stimulating narcotics. We bear positive testimony\nagainst tobacco, spirituous liquors, snuff, tea, coffee, flesh meats,\nbutter, spices, rich cakes, mince pies, a large amount of salt, and all\nexciting substances used as articles of food.\nIf we come to persons who have not been enlightened in regard\nto health reform, and present our strongest positions at first, there is\ndanger of their becoming discouraged as they see how much they\nhave to give up, so that they will make no effort to reform. We must\nlead the people along patiently and gradually, remembering the hole\nof the pit whence we were digged.\nChapter 2\u2014Unsanctified Ability [22]\nI have been shown that Brother B has serious defects in his\ncharacter, which disqualify him for being closely connected with\nthe work of God where important responsibilities are to be borne.\nHe has sufficient mental ability, but the heart, the affections, have\nnot been sanctified to God; therefore he cannot be relied upon as\nqualified for so important a work as the publication of the truth in\nthe office at Battle Creek. A mistake or a neglect of duty in this\nwork affects the cause of God at large. Brother B has not seen his\nfailings, therefore he does not reform.\nIt is by small things that our characters are formed to habits of\nintegrity. You, my brother, have been disposed to undervalue the\nimportance of the little incidents of everyday life. This is a great\nmistake. Nothing with which we have to do is really small. Every\naction is of some account, either on the side of right or on the side\nof wrong. It is only by exercising principle in small transactions of\nordinary life that we are tested and our characters formed. In the\nvaried circumstances of life we are tested and proved, and thereby\nwe acquire a power to stand the greater and more important tests that\nwe are called to endure, and are qualified to fill still more important\npositions. The mind must be trained through daily tests to habits of\nfidelity, to a sense of the claims of right and duty above inclination\nand pleasure. Minds thus trained do not waver between right and\nwrong, as the reed trembles in the wind; but as soon as matters\ncome before them, they discern at once that principle is involved,\nand they instinctively choose the right without long debating the\nmatter. They are loyal because they have trained themselves in habits\nof faithfulness and truth. By being faithful in that which is least,\nthey acquire strength, and it becomes easy for them to be faithful in\ngreater matters.\nBrother B\u2019s education has not been such as to strengthen those [23]\nhigh moral qualities that would enable him to stand alone in the\nstrength of God in defense of truth, amid the severest opposition, firm\n23\n24 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nas a rock to principle, true to moral character, unmoved by human\npraise or censure or rewards, preferring death rather than a violated\nconscience. Such integrity is needed in the office of publication,\nwhere solemn, sacred truths are going forth, upon which the world\nis to be tested.\nThe work of God calls for men of high moral powers to engage\nin its promulgation. Men are wanted whose hearts are nerved with\nholy fervor, men of strong purpose who are not easily moved, who\ncan lay down every selfish interest and give all for the cross and\nthe crown. The cause of present truth is suffering for men who are\nloyal to a sense of right and duty, whose moral integrity is firm,\nand whose energy is equal to the opening providence of God. Such\nqualifications as these are of more value than untold wealth invested\nin the work and cause of God. Energy, moral integrity, and strong\npurpose for the right are qualities that cannot be supplied with any\namount of gold. Men possessing these qualifications will have\ninfluence everywhere. Their lives will be more powerful than lofty\neloquence. God calls for men of heart, men of mind, men of moral\nintegrity, whom He can make the depositaries of His truth, and who\nwill correctly represent its sacred principles in their daily life.\nIn some respects Brother B has ability that but few have. If his\nheart were sanctified to the work he could fill an important position\nin the office with acceptance to God. He needs to be converted and\nto humble himself as a little child, and seek pure, heart religion, in\norder for his influence in the office, or in the cause of God anywhere,\nto be what it ought to be. As his influence has been, it has injured\nall connected with the office, but more especially the young. His\nposition as foreman gave him influence. He did not conduct himself\nconscientiously in the fear of God. He favored particular ones more\nthan others. He neglected those who, for their faithfulness and\nability, deserved special encouragement, and he brought distress and[24]\nperplexity upon those in whom he should have had a special interest.\nThose who link their affections and interest to one or two, and favor\nthem to the disadvantage of others, should not retain their position in\nthe office for a day. This unsanctified partiality for special ones who\nmay please the fancy, to the neglect of others who are conscientious\nand God-fearing, and in His sight of more value, is offensive to God.\nThat which God values we should value. The ornament of a meek\nUnsanctified Ability 25\nand quiet spirit He regards of higher value than external beauty,\noutward adornment, riches, or worldly honor.\nThe true followers of Christ will not choose intimate friendship\nwith those whose characters have serious defects, and whose exam-\nple as a whole it would not be safe to follow, while it is their privilege\nto associate with persons who observe a conscientious regard for\nduty in business, and in religion. Those who lack principle and\ndevotion generally exert a more positive influence to mold the minds\nof their intimate friends than is exerted by those who seem well\nbalanced and able to control and influence the defective in character,\nthose lacking spirituality and devotion.\nBrother B\u2019s influence, if unsanctified, endangers the souls of\nthose who follow his example. His ready tact and ingenuity are\nadmired, and lead those connected with him to give him credit for\nqualifications that he does not possess. At the office he was reckless\nof his time. If this had affected himself only, it would have been a\nsmall matter; but his position as foreman gave him influence. His\nexample before those in the office, especially the apprentices, was\nnot circumspect and conscientious. If, with his ingenious talent,\nBrother B possessed a high sense of moral obligation, his services\nwould be invaluable to the office. If his principles had been such\nthat nothing could have moved him from the straight line of duty,\nthat no inducement which could have been presented would have\npurchased his consent to a wrong action, his influence would have\nmolded others; but his desires for pleasure allured him from his post [25]\nof duty. If he had stood in the strength of God, unmoved by censure\nor flattery, steady to principle, faithful to his convictions of truth and\njustice, he would have been a superior man and would have won a\ncommanding influence everywhere. Brother B lacks frugality and\neconomy. He lacks the tact which would enable him to adapt himself\nto the opening providence of God and make him a minuteman. He\nloves human praise. He is swayed by circumstances, and is subject\nto temptation, and his integrity cannot be relied upon.\nBrother B\u2019s religious experience was not sound. He moved from\nimpulse, not from principle. His heart was not right with God, and\nhe did not have the fear of God and His glory before him. He acted\nvery much like a man engaged in common business; he had but very\nlittle sense of the sacredness of the work in which he was engaged.\n26 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nHe had not practiced self-denial and economy, therefore he had no\nexperience in this. At times he labored earnestly and manifested\na good interest in the work. Then again he would be careless of\nhis time and spend precious moments in unimportant conversation,\nhindering others from doing their duty and setting them an example\nof recklessness and unfaithfulness. The work of God is sacred and\ncalls for men of lofty integrity. Men are wanted whose sense of\njustice, even in the smallest matters, will not allow them to make\nan entry of their time that is not minute and correct\u2014men who will\nrealize that they are handling means that belongs to God, and who\nwould not unjustly appropriate one cent to their own use; men who\nwill be just as faithful and exact, careful and diligent, in their labor,\nin the absence of their employer as in his presence, proving by their\nfaithfulness that they are not merely men pleasers, eye-servants, but\nare conscientious, faithful, true workmen, doing right, not for human\npraise, but because they love and choose the right from a high sense\nof their obligation to God.\nParents are not thorough in the education of their children. They\ndo not see the necessity of molding their minds by discipline. They\ngive them a superficial education, manifesting greater care for the[26]\nornamental than for that solid education which would so develop\nand direct the faculties as to bring out the energies of the soul, and\ncause the powers of mind to expand and strengthen by exercise. The\nfaculties of the mind need cultivation, that they may be exercised to\nthe glory of God. Careful attention should be given to the culture\nof the intellect, that the various organs of the mind may have equal\nstrength by being brought into exercise, each in its distinctive of-\nfice. If parents allow their children to follow the bent of their own\nminds, their own inclination and pleasure, to the neglect of duty,\ntheir characters will be formed after this pattern, and they will not\nbe competent for any responsible position in life. The desires and\ninclinations of the young should be restrained, their weak points of\ncharacter strengthened, and their overstrong tendencies repressed.\nIf one faculty is suffered to remain dormant, or is turned out of its\nproper course, the purpose of God is not carried out. All the faculties\nshould be well developed. Care should be given to each, for each\nhas a bearing upon the others, and all must be exercised in order that\nthe mind be properly balanced. If one or two organs are cultivated\nUnsanctified Ability 27\nand kept in continual use because it is the choice of your children to\nput the strength of the mind in one direction to the neglect of other\nmental powers, they will come to maturity with unbalanced minds\nand inharmonious characters. They will be apt and strong in one\ndirection, but greatly deficient in other directions just as important.\nThey will not be competent men and women. Their deficiencies will\nbe marked, and will mar the entire character.\nBrother B has cultivated an almost ungovernable propensity for\nsight-seeing and trips of pleasure. Time and means are wasted to\ngratify his desire for pleasure excursions. His selfish love of pleasure\nleads to the neglect of sacred duties. Brother B loves to preach, but he\nhas never taken up this work feeling the woe upon him if he preach\nnot the gospel. He has frequently left work in the office which\ndemanded his care, to comply with calls from some of his brethren [27]\nin other churches. If he had felt the solemnity of the work of God\nfor this time, and gone forth making God his trust, practicing self-\ndenial, and lifting the cross of Christ, he would have accomplished\ngood. But he frequently had so little realization of the holiness of\nthe work, that he would improve the opportunity of visiting other\nchurches in making the occasion a scene of self-gratification, in\nshort, a pleasure trip. What a contrast between his course and that\npursued by the apostles, who went forth burdened with the word of\nlife, and in the demonstration of the Spirit preached Christ crucified!\nThey pointed out the living way through self-denial and the cross.\nThey had fellowship with their Saviour in His sufferings, and their\ngreatest desire was to know Christ Jesus, and Him crucified. They\nconsidered not their own convenience, nor counted their lives dear\nunto themselves. They lived not to enjoy, but to do good, and to save\nsouls for whom Christ died.\nBrother B can present arguments upon doctrinal points, but the\npractical lessons of sanctification, self-denial, and the cross, he has\nnot experienced in himself. He can speak to the ear, but not having\nfelt the sanctifying influence of these truths upon his heart, nor\npracticed them in his life, he fails to urge the truth home upon the\nconscience with a deep sense of its importance and solemnity in\nview of the judgment, when every case must be decided. Brother\nB has not trained his mind, and his deportment out of meeting has\nnot been exemplary. The burden of the work has not seemed to rest\n28 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nupon him, but he has been trifling and boyish, and by his example\nhas lowered the standard of religion. Sacred and common things\nhave been placed on a level.\nBrother B has not been willing to endure the cross; he has not\nbeen willing to follow Christ from the manger to the judgment\nhall and Calvary. He has brought upon himself sore affliction by\nseeking his own pleasure. He has yet to learn that his own strength is\nweakness and his wisdom is folly. If he had felt that he was engaged\nin the work of God, and that he was indebted to One who had given[28]\nhim time and talents, and who required that they be improved to\nHis glory,\u2014had he stood faithfully at his post,\u2014he would not have\nsuffered that long, tedious sickness. His exposure upon that pleasure\ntrip caused him months of suffering and would have caused his death\nhad it not been for the earnest, effectual prayer of faith put up in\nhis behalf by those who felt that he was not prepared to die. Had\nhe died at that time his case would have been far worse than that\nof the unenlightened sinner. But God mercifully heard the prayers\nof His people and gave him a new lease of life, that he might have\nopportunity to repent of his unfaithfulness and to redeem the time.\nHis example had influenced many in Battle Creek in the wrong\ndirection.\nBrother B came up from his sickness, but how little did he or\nhis family feel humbled under the hand of God. The work of the\nSpirit of God, and wisdom from Him, are not manifested that we\nmay be happy and satisfied with ourselves, but that our souls may be\nrenewed in knowledge and true holiness. How much better would it\nhave been for this brother if his affliction had prompted to faithful\nsearching of heart, to discover the imperfections in his character,\nthat he might put them away, and with humble spirit come forth from\nthe furnace as gold purified, reflecting the image of Christ.\nThe sickness that he had brought upon himself, the church helped\nhim bear. His watchers were provided, and his expenses were in\na great measure borne by the church; yet neither he nor his family\nappreciated this generosity and tenderness on the part of the church.\nThey felt that they deserved all that was done for them. As Brother\nB came up from his sickness, he felt wrong toward my husband\nbecause he disapproved his course, which was so censurable. He\nunited with others to injure my husband\u2019s influence, and since he\nUnsanctified Ability 29\nhas left the office he has not felt right. He would poorly stand the\ntest of being proved by God.\nBrother B has not yet learned the lesson that he will have to learn\nif he is saved at last\u2014to deny self, and resist his desire for pleasure. [29]\nHe will have to be brought over the ground again and tried still more\nclosely, because he failed to endure the trials of the past. He has\ndispleased God in justifying self. He has but little experience in the\nfellowship of the sufferings of Christ. He loves display and does\nnot economize his means. The Lord knows. He weighs the inward\nfeelings and intentions of the heart. He understands man. He tests\nour fidelity. He requires that we should love and serve Him with the\nwhole mind, and heart, and strength. The lovers of pleasure may put\non a form of godliness that involves some self-denial even, and they\nmay sacrifice time and money, and yet self not be subdued, and the\nwill not be brought into subjection to the will of God.\nThe influence of the D girls was very bad in Battle Creek. They\nhad not been trained. Their mother had neglected her sacred duty\nand had not restrained her children. She had not brought them up\nin the fear and admonition of the Lord. They had been indulged\nand shielded from bearing responsibilities until they had no relish\nfor the plain, homely duties of life. The mother had educated the\ndaughters to think much of dress, but the inward adorning was not\nexalted before them. These young girls were vain and proud. Their\nminds were impure; their conversation was corrupting; and yet there\nwas a class in Battle Creek who would associate with this stamp of\nminds, and they could not associate with them without coming down\nto their level. These girls were not dealt as severely with as the case\ndemanded. They love the society of young men, and the young men\nare the theme of their meditation and of their conversation. They\nhave corrupted manners, and are headstrong and self-confident.\nThe entire family love display. The mother is not a prudent,\ndignified woman. She is not qualified to bring up children. To dress\nher children to make a show is of greater consequence to her than\nthe inward adorning. She has not disciplined herself. Her will has\nnot been brought into conformity to the will of God. Her heart is\nnot right with God. She is a stranger to the operation of His Spirit [30]\nupon the heart, bringing the desires and affections into conformity\nto the obedience of Christ. She does not possess ennobling qualities\n30 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nof mind and does not discern sacred things. She has let her children\ndo as they pleased. The fearful experience that she has had with two\nof her elder children has not made the deep impression on her mind\nthat the circumstances demanded. She has educated her children\nto love dress, vanity, and folly. She has not disciplined her two\nyounger girls. A D, under a proper influence, would be a worthy\nyoung man; but he has much to learn. He follows inclination rather\nthan duty. He loves to follow his own will and pleasure, and has\nnot a correct knowledge of the duties devolving upon a Christian.\nSelf-gratification, and his own inclination, he would gladly interpret\nto be duty. Self-gratification he has not overcome. He has a work\nto do to clear his spiritual vision, that he may understand what it is\nto be sanctified to God, and learn the high claims of God upon him.\nThe serious defects in his education have affected his life.\nIf, with his good qualifications, Brother B were well balanced\nand a faithful foreman of the office, his labor would be of great\nvalue to the office, and he could earn double wages. But for the past\nyears, considering his deficiency, with his unconsecrated influence,\nthe office could better afford to do without him, even if his services\ncould be had for nothing. Brother and Sister B have not learned\nthe lesson of economy. The gratification of the taste, and the desire\nfor pleasure and display, have had an overpowering influence upon\nthem. Small wages would be of more advantage to them than large,\nfor they would use all as they pass along, were it ever so much.\nThey would enjoy as they go, and then when affliction draws upon\nthem, would be wholly unprepared. Twenty dollars a week would\nbe laid out about the same as twelve. Had Brother and Sister B been\neconomical managers, denying themselves, they could ere this have\nhad a home of their own, and besides this have had means to draw\nupon in case of adversity. But they will not economize as others\nhave done, upon whom they have sometimes been dependent. If[31]\nthey neglect to learn these lessons, their characters will not be found\nperfect in the day of God.\nBrother B has been the object of the great love and condescension\nof Christ, and yet he has never felt that he could imitate the great\nExemplar. He claims, and all his life has sought after, a better portion\nin this life than was given our Lord. He has never felt the depths of\nUnsanctified Ability 31\nignorance and sin from which Christ has proposed to lift him and to\nlink him to His divine nature.\nIt is a fearful thing to minister in sacred things when the heart and\nhands are not holy. To be a co-worker with Christ involves fearful\nresponsibilities; to stand as His representative is no small matter.\nThe fearful realities of the judgment will test every man\u2019s work. The\napostle said, \u201cWe preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord;\u201d\n\u201cfor God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath\nshined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of\nGod in the face of Jesus Christ.\u201d The sufficiency of the apostle was\nnot in himself, but in the gracious influence of the Spirit of Christ,\nwhich filled his soul and brought every thought into subjection to the\nobedience of Christ. The power of truth attending the word preached\nwill be a savor of life unto life or of death unto death. Ministers are\nrequired to be living examples of the mind and spirit of Christ, living\nepistles, known and read of all men. I tremble when I consider that\nthere are some ministers, even among Seventh-day Adventists, who\nare not sanctified by the truths which they preach. Nothing less than\nthe quick and powerful Spirit of God working in the hearts of His\nmessengers to give the knowledge of the glory of God, can gain for\nthem the victory.\nBrother B\u2019s preaching has not been marked by the sanction of\nGod\u2019s Spirit. He can talk fluently and make a point plain, but his\npreaching has lacked spirituality. His appeals have not touched the\nheart with a new tenderness. There has been an array of words,\nbut the hearts of his hearers have not been quickened and melted\nwith a sense of a Saviour\u2019s love. Sinners have not been convicted [32]\nand drawn to Christ by a sense that \u201cJesus of Nazareth passeth by.\u201d\nSinners should have a clear impression given them of the nearness\nand willingness of Christ to give them present salvation. A Saviour\nshould be presented before the people, while the heart of the speaker\nshould be subdued and imbued with His Spirit. The very tones of\nthe voice, the look, the words, should possess an irresistible power\nto move hearts and control minds. Jesus should be found in the heart\nof the minister. If Jesus is in the words and in the tones of the voice,\nif they are mellow with His tender love, it will prove a blessing of\nmore value than all the riches, pleasures, and glories of the earth;\nfor such blessings will not come and go without accomplishing a\n32 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nwork. Convictions will be deepened, impressions will be made, and\nthe question will be raised: \u201cWhat shall I do to be saved?\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 3\u2014Unbalanced Minds\nGod has committed to each of us sacred trusts, for which He\nholds us accountable. It is His purpose that we so educate the mind\nas to be able to exercise the talents He has given us in such a manner\nas to accomplish the greatest good and reflect the glory to the Giver.\nWe are indebted to God for all the qualities of the mind. These\npowers can be cultivated, and so discreetly directed and controlled\nas to accomplish the purpose for which they were given. It is duty\nto so educate the mind as to bring out the energies of the soul and\ndevelop every faculty. When all the faculties are in exercise, the\nintellect will be strengthened, and the purpose for which they were\ngiven will be accomplished.\nMany are not doing the greatest amount of good because they\nexercise the intellect in one direction and neglect to give careful\nattention to those things for which they think they are not adapted.\nSome faculties that are weak are thus allowed to lie dormant because\nthe work that should call them into exercise, and consequently give [33]\nthem strength, is not pleasant. All the powers of the mind should be\nexercised, all the faculties cultivated. Perception, judgment, memory,\nand all the reasoning powers should have equal strength in order that\nminds may be well balanced.\nIf certain faculties are used to the neglect of others, the design of\nGod is not fully carried out in us; for all the faculties have a bearing\nand are dependent, in a great measure, upon one another. One cannot\nbe effectually used without the operation of all, that the balance may\nbe carefully preserved. If all the attention and strength are given\nto one, while others lie dormant, the development is strong in that\none and will lead to extremes, because all the powers have not been\ncultivated. Some minds are dwarfed and not properly balanced. All\nminds are not naturally constituted alike. We have varied minds;\nsome are strong upon certain points and very weak upon others.\nThese deficiencies, so apparent, need not and should not exist. If\n33\n34 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthose who possess them would strengthen the weak points in their\ncharacter by cultivation and exercise they would become strong.\nIt is agreeable, but not most profitable, to exercise those faculties\nwhich are naturally the strongest, while we neglect those that are\nweak, but which need to be strengthened. The feeblest faculties\nshould have careful attention, that all the powers of the intellect\nmay be nicely balanced and all do their part like well-regulated\nmachinery. We are dependent upon God for the preservation of all\nour faculties. Christians are under obligation to Him to so train\nthe mind that all the faculties may be strengthened and more fully\ndeveloped. If we neglect to do this, they will never accomplish the\npurpose for which they were designed. We have no right to neglect\nany one of the powers that God has given us. We see monomaniacs\nall over the country. They are frequently sane upon every subject but\none. The reason of this is that one organ of the mind was specially\nexercised while the others were permitted to lie dormant. The one\nthat was in constant use became worn and diseased, and the man[34]\nbecame a wreck. God was not glorified by his pursuing this course.\nHad he exercised all the organs equally, all would have had a healthy\ndevelopment; all the labor would not have been thrown upon one,\ntherefore no one would have broken down.\nMinisters should be guarded, lest they thwart the purposes of\nGod by plans of their own. They are in danger of narrowing down\nthe work of God, and confining their labor to certain localities, and\nnot cultivating a special interest for the work of God in all its various\ndepartments. There are some who concentrate their minds upon one\nsubject to the exclusion of others which may be of equal importance.\nThey are one-idea men. All the strength of their being is concentrated\non the subject upon which the mind is exercised for the time. Every\nother consideration is lost sight of. This one favorite theme is the\nburden of their thoughts and the theme of their conversation. All\nthe evidence which has a bearing upon that subject is eagerly seized\nand appropriated, and dwelt upon at so great length that minds are\nwearied in following them.\nTime is frequently lost in explaining points which are really\nunimportant, and which would be taken for granted without pro-\nducing proof; for they are self-evident. But the real, vital points\nshould be made as plain and forcible as language and proof can\nUnbalanced Minds 35\nmake them. The power to concentrate the mind upon one subject\nto the exclusion of all others is well in a degree; but the constant\nexercise of this faculty wears upon those organs that are called into\nuse to do this work; it throws too great a tax upon them, and the\nresult is a failure to accomplish the greatest amount of good. The\nprincipal wear comes upon one set of organs, while the others lie\ndormant. The mind cannot thus be healthfully exercised, and, in\nconsequence, life is shortened.\nAll the faculties should bear a part of the labor, working harmo-\nniously, balancing one another. Those who put the whole strength of\ntheir mind into one subject are greatly deficient on other points, for\nthe reason that the faculties are not equally cultivated. The subject [35]\nbefore them enchains their attention, and they are led on and on,\nand go deeper and deeper into the matter. They see knowledge and\nlight as they become interested and absorbed. But there are very few\nminds that can follow them unless they have given the subject the\nsame depth of thought. There is danger of such men plowing, and\nplanting the seed of truth so deep that the tender, precious blade will\nnever find the surface.\nMuch hard labor is often expended that is not called for and that\nwill never be appreciated. If those who have large concentrativeness\ncultivate this faculty to the neglect of others, they cannot have well-\nproportioned minds. They are like machinery in which only one\nset of wheels works at a time. While some wheels are rusting\nfrom inaction, others are wearing from constant use. Men who\ncultivate one or two faculties, and do not exercise all equally, cannot\naccomplish one half the good in the world that God designed they\nshould. They are one-sided men; only half of the power that God has\ngiven them is put to use, while the other half is rusting with inaction.\nIf this class of minds have a special work, requiring thought,\nthey should not exercise all their powers upon that one thing, to\nthe exclusion of every other interest. While they make the subject\nbefore them their principal business, other branches of the work\nshould have a portion of their time. This would be much better for\nthemselves and for the cause generally. One branch of the work\nshould not have exclusive attention to the neglect of all others. In\ntheir writings some need to be constantly guarded, that they do not\nmake points blind that are plain, by covering them up with many\n36 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\narguments which will not be of lively interest to the reader. If they\nlinger tediously upon points, giving every particular which suggests\nitself to the mind, their labor is nearly lost. The interest of the reader\nwill not be deep enough to pursue the subject to its close. The most\nessential points of truth may be made indistinct by giving attention\nto every minute point. Much ground is covered; but the work upon\nwhich so much labor is expended is not calculated to do the greatest[36]\namount of good, by awakening a general interest.\nIn this age, when pleasing fables are drifting upon the surface\nand attracting the mind, truth presented in an easy style, backed up\nwith a few strong proofs, is better than to search and bring forth an\noverwhelming array of evidence; for the point then does not stand\nso distinct in many minds as before the objections and evidences\nwere brought before them. With many, assertions will go further\nthan long arguments. They take many things for granted. Proof does\nnot help the case in the minds of such.\nOpposing Adventists\nOur most bitter opponents are found among the first-day Adven-\ntists. They do not engage in the warfare honorably. They will pursue\nany course, however unreasonable and inconsistent, to cover up the\ntruth and try to make it appear that the law of God is of no force.\nThey flatter themselves that the end will justify the means. Men of\ntheir own number, in whom they had not confidence, will commence\na tirade against the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, and they\nwill give publicity to their statements, however untrue, unjust, and\neven ridiculous, if they can make them bear against the truth which\nthey hate.\nWe should not be moved or disconcerted by this unjust warfare\nfrom unreasonable men. Those who receive, and are pleased with,\nwhat these men speak and write against the truth are not the ones who\nwould be convinced of the truth or who would honor the cause of God\nif they should accept it. Time and strength can be better employed\nthan to dwell at length upon the quibbles of our opponents who deal\nin slander and misrepresentations. While precious time is employed\nin following the crooks and turns of dishonest opponents, the people\nwho are open to conviction are dying for want of knowledge. A train\nUnbalanced Minds 37\nof senseless quibbles of Satan\u2019s own invention is brought before\nminds, while the people are crying for food, for meat in due season.\nIt takes those who have trained their minds to war against the [37]\ntruth to manufacture quibbles. And we are not wise to take them\nfrom their hands, and pass them out to thousands who would never\nhave thought of them had we not published them to the world. This\nis what our opponents want to have done; they want to be brought\nto notice and to have us publish for them. This is especially true\nof some. This is their main object in writing out their falsehoods\nand in misrepresenting the truth and the characters of those who\nlove and advocate the truth. They will die out more speedily to\nbe left unnoticed, to have their errors and falsehoods treated with\nsilent contempt. They do not want to be let alone. Opposition is the\nelement that they love. If it were not for this, they would have but\nlittle influence.\nThe first-day Adventists as a class are the most difficult to reach.\nThey generally reject the truth, as did the Jews. We should, as far\nas possible, go forward as though there were not such a people in\nexistence. They are the elements of confusion, and immoralities exist\namong them to a fearful extent. It would be the greatest calamity\nto have many of their number embrace the truth. They would have\nto unlearn everything and learn anew, or they would cause us great\ntrouble. There are occasions where their glaring misrepresentations\nwill have to be met. When this is the case, it should be done promptly\nand briefly, and we should then pass on to our work. The plan of\nChrist\u2019s teaching should be ours. He was plain and simple, striking\ndirectly at the root of the matter, and the minds of all were met.\nIt is not the best policy to be so very explicit and say all upon a\npoint that can be said, when a few arguments will cover the ground\nand be sufficient for all practical purposes to convince or silence\nopponents. You may remove every prop today and close the mouths\nof objectors so that they can say nothing, and tomorrow they will go\nover the same ground again. Thus it will be, over and over, because\nthey do not love the light and will not come to the light, lest their\ndarkness and error should be removed from them. It is a better plan\nto keep a reserve of arguments than to pour out a depth of knowledge [38]\nupon a subject which would be taken for granted without labored\nargument. Christ\u2019s ministry lasted only three years, and a great work\n38 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nwas done in that short period. In these last days there is a great\nwork to be done in a short time. While many are getting ready to do\nsomething, souls will perish for the light and knowledge.\nIf men who are engaged in presenting and defending the truth\nof the Bible undertake to investigate and show the fallacy and in-\nconsistency of men who dishonestly turn the truth of God into a lie,\nSatan will stir up opponents enough to keep their pens constantly\nemployed, while other branches of the work will be left to suffer.\nWe must have more of the spirit of those men who were engaged\nin building the walls of Jerusalem. We are doing a great work, and\nwe cannot come down. If Satan sees that he can keep men answering\nthe objections of opponents, and thus keep their voices silent, and\nhinder them from doing the most important work for the present\ntime, his object is accomplished.\nThe Sabbath History has been kept from the people too long.\nThey need this precious work, even if they do not have it in all its\nperfection. It never can be prepared in a manner to fully silence\nunreasonable opponents, who are unstable, and who wrest the Scrip-\ntures unto their own destruction. This is a busy world. Men and\nwomen who engage in the business of life have not time to medi-\ntate, or even to read the word of God enough to understand all its\nimportant truths. Long, labored arguments will interest but a few;\nfor the people have to read as they run. You can no more remove the\nobjections to the Sabbath commandment from the minds of first-day\nAdventists than could the Saviour of the world, by His great power\nand miracles, convince the Jews that He was the Messiah, after they\nhad once set themselves to reject Him. Like the obstinate, unbeliev-\ning Jews, they have chosen darkness rather than light, and should\nan angel direct from the courts of heaven speak to them, they would\nsay it was Satan.\nThe world needs labor now. Calls are coming in from every[39]\ndirection like the Macedonian cry: \u201cCome over and help us.\u201d Plain,\npointed arguments, standing our as mileposts, will do more toward\nconvincing minds generally than will a large array of arguments\nwhich cover a great deal of ground, but which none but investigating\nminds will have interest to follow. The Sabbath History should be\ngiven to the people. While one edition is circulating, and the people\nare being benefited by it, greater improvements may be made, until\nUnbalanced Minds 39\neverything possible has been done to bring it to perfection. Our\nsuccess will be in reaching common minds. Those who have talent\nand position are so exalted above the simplicity of the work, and so\nwell satisfied with themselves, that they feel no need of the truth.\nThey are exactly where the Jews were, self-righteous, self-sufficient.\nThey are whole and have no need of a physician.\n* * * * *\nChapter 4\u2014Intimate Friendship With Worldlings\nDecember 10, 1871, I was shown, Brother E, that you and your\nsisters were in a very dangerous condition; and that which makes\nyour position the more dangerous is that you do not realize your true\nstate. I saw you enveloped in darkness. This darkness has not settled\nupon you suddenly. You commenced to enter the mist of darkness\ngradually, and almost imperceptibly, until the darkness is as light to\nyou, yet the cloud is becoming more dense every day. Now and then\nI saw a gleaming of light separating the darkness from you; then\nagain it would close about you, firmer and more dense than before.\nYour singing schools have ever been a snare to you. Neither you\nnor your sisters have a depth of experience that will enable you to\nbe brought in contact with the influences you meet in your singing\nschools, without being affected. It would take stronger minds, with\ngreater decision of character than you three possess, to be brought\ninto the society you are and not be affected. Listen to the words[40]\nof Christ: \u201cYe are the light of the world. A city that is set on an\nhill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under\na bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are\nin the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see\nyour good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d Have\nyour example and influence been of that positive character that has\nimpressed and convicted your associates? I think not. You have been\ninjured. Darkness has settled upon you and dimmed your light so\nthat it has not burned with that luster to dispel the darkness about\nothers. You have been separating further and further from God.\nYou, my brother, have but a faint sense of what you have been\ndoing. You have been standing directly in the way of your sisters\u2019\nadvancement in the divine life. They, more especially F, have been\nentangled with the bewitching, satanic wiles of spiritualism, and if\nshe rids herself of this unholy slime of Satan, which has perverted her\nsense of eternal things, she will have to make a mighty effort. It will\nbe but a hairbreadth escape. You have been blinded, deceived, and\n40\nIntimate Friendship With Worldlings 41\nenchanted yourself. You do not see yourself. You are all very weak,\nwhen you might be strong in the precious, saving truth, strengthened,\nestablished, and settled upon the Rock Christ Jesus. I feel deeply. I\ntremble for you. I see temptations on every hand, and you with so\nlittle power to resist them.\nBrother E, I was shown that you are infatuated; you are deceived\nas to your motives and the real purposes of your heart. I saw you\nin the society of Brother G\u2019s daughter. She has never yielded her\nheart to Christ. I was shown her affected and convicted. But your\ncourse was not of that character to deepen conviction, or to give her\nthe impression that there was special importance attached to these\nmatters. You profess to hold sacred the salvation of the soul, and the\npresent truth. She does not respect the Sabbath from principle. She\nloves the vanity of the world and enjoys the pride and amusements\nof life. But you have been departing so gradually from God, and [41]\nfrom the light, that you do not see the separation which the truth\nnecessarily brings between those who love God and those who are\nlovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. I saw that you were\nattracted to her society. Religious meetings and sacred duties were\nof minor importance, while the presence of a mere child, who has\nno knowledge of the truth or of heavenly things, fascinated you. You\nhave overlooked self-denial and the cross, which lie directly in the\npathway of every disciple of Christ.\nI was shown that if you had been walking in the light you would\nhave taken your position decidedly for the truth. Your example\nwould have shown that you considered the truth you profess of that\nimportance that your affections and heart could go only where the\nimage of Christ was discernible. Christ now says to you: Which will\nyou have, Me or the world? Your decision is to be made here. Will\nyou follow the promptings of an unsanctified heart, turn away from\nself-denial for Christ\u2019s sake, and step over the cross without lifting\nit? Or will you lift that cross, heavy though it may be, and make\nsome sacrifice for the truth\u2019s sake? May God help you to see where\nyou are, that you may place a true estimate upon eternal things. You\nnow have so little spiritual eyesight that the holy and sacred are\nplaced upon a level with the common. You have responsibilities.\nYour influence affects your sisters to a great extent. Your only safety\nis in separation from the world.\n42 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nI was shown you, my brother, taking the young with you to\nscenes of amusement at the time of a religious interest, and also\nengaging in singing schools with worldlings who are all darkness\nand who have evil angels all around them. How does your feeble,\ndim light appear amid this darkness and temptation? Angels of God\ndo not attend you upon these occasions. You are left to go in your\nown strength. Satan is well pleased with your position; for he can\nmake you more efficient in his service than if you did not profess\nto be a Christian keeping all the commandments of God. The True[42]\nWitness addresses the Laodicean church: \u201cI know thy works, that\nthou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then\nbecause thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew\nthee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased\nwith goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art\nwretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel\nthee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and\nwhite raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of\nthy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve,\nthat thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be\nzealous therefore, and repent.\u201d\nYou are blinded and infatuated. You have felt strong when you\nwere weakness itself. You can be strong in the Mighty One. You\ncan be an instrument of righteousness if you are willing to suffer\nfor Christ\u2019s sake. You and your sisters may redeem the time if you\nwill, but it will cost an effort. Your younger sister is linked to one\nwho is not worthy of her affections. There are serious defects in his\ncharacter. He does not have reverence for sacred and holy things;\nhis heart has not been changed by the Spirit of God. He is selfish,\nboastful, and loves pleasure more than duty. He has no experience\nin self-denial and humiliation.\nIn forming friendship, great caution should be exercised lest\nan intimacy be contracted with one whose example it would not\nbe safe to imitate; for the effect of such an intimacy is to lead\naway from God, from devotion, and the love of the truth. It is\npositively dangerous for you to be intimate with friends who have\nnot a religious experience. If either of you, or all three of you, follow\nthe leadings of God\u2019s Spirit, or value your soul\u2019s salvation, you\nwill not choose as your particular and intimate friends those who\nIntimate Friendship With Worldlings 43\ndo not maintain a serious regard for religious things, and who do\nnot live under its practical influence. Eternal considerations should\ncome first with you. Nothing can have a more subtle and positively\ndangerous influence upon the mind, and serve more effectually to [43]\nbanish serious impressions and the convictions of the Spirit of God,\nthan to associate with those who are vain and careless, and whose\nconversation is upon the world and vanity. The more engaging\nthese persons may be in other respects, the more dangerous is their\ninfluence as companions, because they throw around an irreligious\nlife so many pleasing attractions.\nGod has claims upon all three of you which you cannot lightly\nthrow aside. Jesus has bought you with the price of His own blood.\n\u201cYe are not your own, for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify\nGod in your body, and in your spirit, which are God\u2019s.\u201d Have you no\nsacrifice to make for God? Great responsibilities stand before you\neach in everyday life. Your record is daily passing up to God. Great\ndangers lie hidden in your pathway. If I could, I would take you in\nmy arms and bear you safely over them; but this I am not permitted\nto do. You are in the most critical period of your life history. If you\narouse the energies of the soul and direct them to securing things\nof eternal interest, and if you make everything subordinate to this,\nyou will make a success of perfecting Christian character. You may\nall engage in the spiritual warfare against besetting sins, and you\nmay, through Christ, come off victors. But it will be no child\u2019s play.\nIt will be a stern warfare, involving self-denial and cross bearing.\nThe danger is that you will not fully realize your backslidings and\nyour perilous condition. Unless you view life as it is, cast aside the\nbrilliant fancies of imagination, and come down to the sober lessons\nof experience, you will awake when it is too late. You will then\nrealize the terrible mistake you have made.\nYour education has not been of that kind to form solid, substantial\ncharacters, therefore you have to obtain now the education which\nyou should have had years ago. Your mother was too fond of you. A\nmother cannot love her children too well, but she may love unwisely\nand allow her affection to blind her to their best interests. You have\nhad an indulgent, tender mother. She has shielded her children too [44]\nmuch. Her life has been nearly crushed out by the burdens which\n44 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nher children should have taken, and which they could have borne\nbetter than she.\nThe lack of firmness and self-denial in your characters is a seri-\nous drawback in obtaining a genuine religious experience that will\nnot be sliding sand. Firmness and integrity of purpose should be\ncultivated. These qualities are positively necessary to a successful\nChristian life. If you have integrity of soul you will not be swayed\nfrom the right. No motive will be sufficient to move you from the\nstraight line of duty; you will be loyal and true to God. The plead-\nings of affection and love, the yearnings of friendship, will not move\nyou to turn aside from truth and duty; you will not sacrifice duty to\ninclination.\nIf you, my brother, are allured to unite your life interest with a\nyoung, inexperienced girl, who is really deficient in education in\nthe common, practical, daily duties of life, you make a mistake; but\nthis deficiency is small compared with her ignorance in regard to\nher duty to God. She has not been destitute of light; she has had\nreligious privileges, and yet she has not felt her wretched sinfulness\nwithout Christ. If, in your infatuation, you can repeatedly turn from\nthe prayer meeting, where God meets with His people, in order to\nenjoy the society of one who has no love for God and who sees no\nattractions in the religious life, how can you expect God to prosper\nsuch a union? Be not in haste. Early marriages should not be\nencouraged. If either young women or young men have no respect\nfor the claims of God, if they fail to heed the claims which bind them\nto religion, there will be danger that they will not properly regard the\nclaims of the husband or of the wife. The habit of frequently being\nin the society of the one of your choice, and that, too, at the sacrifice\nof religious privileges and of your hours of prayer, is dangerous; you\nsustain a loss that you cannot afford. The habit of sitting up late at\nnight is customary; but it is not pleasing to God, even if you are both\nChristians. These untimely hours injure health, unfit the mind for the[45]\nnext day\u2019s duties, and have an appearance of evil. My brother, I hope\nyou will have self-respect enough to shun this form of courtship.\nIf you have an eye single to the glory of God you will move with\ndeliberate caution. You will not suffer lovesick sentimentalism to so\nblind your vision that you cannot discern the high claims that God\nhas upon you as a Christian.\nIntimate Friendship With Worldlings 45\nDear youth, I address myself to you three. Let it be your aim to\nglorify God and attain His moral likeness. Invite the Spirit of God\nto mold your characters. Now is your golden opportunity to wash\nyour robes of character and make them white in the blood of the\nLamb. I regard this as the turning point in the destiny of each of you.\nWhich will you choose, says Christ, Me or the world? God calls for\nan unconditional surrender of the heart and affections to Him. If you\nlove friends, brothers or sisters, father or mother, houses or lands,\nmore than Me, says Christ, you are not worthy of Me. Religion lays\nthe soul under the greatest obligation to her claims, to walk by her\nprinciples. As the mysterious magnet points to the north, so do the\nclaims of religion point to the glory of God. You are bound by your\nbaptismal vows to honor your Creator and to resolutely deny self\nand crucify your affections and lusts, and bring even your thoughts\ninto obedience to the will of Christ.\nAvoid running into temptation. When temptations surround you,\nand you cannot control the circumstances which expose you to them,\nthen you may claim the promise of God, and with confidence and\nconscious power exclaim: \u201cI can do all things through Christ which\nstrengtheneth me.\u201d There is strength for you all in God. But you will\nnever feel your need of that strength which alone is able to save you,\nunless you feel your weakness and sinfulness. Jesus, your precious\nSaviour, now calls you to take your position firmly upon the platform\nof eternal truth. If you suffer with Him, He will crown you with\nglory in His everlasting kingdom. If you are willing to sacrifice all\nfor Him, then He will be your Saviour. But if you choose your own [46]\nway you will follow on in darkness until it is too late to secure the\neternal reward.\nWhat have you been willing to suffer for the truth\u2019s sake? You\nhave a very short period in which to cultivate the noble traits of\nyour characters. You have all been, to some extent, dissatisfied and\nunhappy. You have had many complaints to make. You have talked\nunbelief and have censured others. Especially is this true of F and\nH. Your hearts have been filled with pride, and even with bitterness\nat times. Your closets have been neglected, and you have not loved\nthe exercises of religious duties. If you had been persevering in your\nefforts to grow up into Christ, your living Head, you would now be\nstrong, and competent to bless others with your influence. If you\n46 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nhad cultivated a steady, uniform, unwavering energy you would now\nbe strong to resist temptation. But these precious qualities can only\nbe gained through a surrender of the soul to the claims of religion.\nThen the motives will be high, and the intellect and affections will\nbe balanced by noble principles. God will work with us if we will\nonly engage in healthy action. We must feel the necessity of uniting\nour human efforts and zealous action with divine power. We can\nstand forth in God, strong to conquer. You, Brother E, have greatly\nfailed in energy of purpose to do and to endure.\nWhat a great mistake is made in the education of children and\nyouth, in favoring, indulging, and petting them. They become selfish\nand inefficient, and lack energy in the little things of life. They\nare not trained to acquire strength of character by the performance\nof everyday duties, lowly though they may be. You neglect to do\nwillingly and cheerfully that which lies directly before you to do,\nand which someone must do. There is a great desire with all of us to\nfind a larger, more exalted work.\nNo one is qualified for great and important work unless he has\nbeen faithful in the performance of little duties. It is by degrees that\nthe character is formed and that the soul is trained to put forth effort\nand energy proportionate to the task which is to be accomplished. If[47]\nwe are creatures of circumstance, we shall surely fail of perfecting\nChristian characters. You must master circumstances, and not allow\ncircumstances to master you. You can find energy at the cross of\nChrist. You can now grow by degrees, and conquer difficulties, and\novercome force of habit. You need to be stimulated by the life-giving\nforce of Jesus. You should be attracted to Christ and clothed with His\ndivine beauty and excellence. Brother G\u2019s daughter has an education\nto gain; she is no more competent for the duties and difficulties of\nlife as a wife than a schoolgirl ten years old.\nReligion should dictate and guide you in all your pursuits, and\nshould hold absolute control over your affections. If you yield\nyourselves unreservedly into the hands of Christ, making His power\nyour strength, then will your moral vision be clear to discern quality\nof character that you may not be deceived by appearances and make\ngreat mistakes in your friendship. Your moral power must be keen\nand sensitive, that it may bear severe tests and not be marred. Your\nIntimate Friendship With Worldlings 47\nintegrity of soul should be so firm that vanity, display, or flattery will\nnot move you.\nOh, it is a great thing to be right with God, the soul in harmony\nwith its Maker, so that, amid the contagion of evil example, which by\nits deceitful appearance would lure the soul from duty, angels may\nbe sent to your rescue! But bear in mind, if you invite temptation,\nyou will not have divine aid to keep you from being overcome. The\nthree worthies endured the fiery furnace, for Jesus walked with them\nin the fiery flame. If they had, of themselves, walked into the fire,\nthey would have been consumed. Thus will it be with you. If you\ndo not walk deliberately into temptation, God will sustain you when\nthe temptation comes.\nChapter 5\u2014The Cause in New York[48]\nWhile in Vermont, December 10, 1871, I was shown some things\nin regard to New York. The cause in that state seemed to be in a\ndeplorable condition. There were but few laborers, and these were\nnot as efficient as their profession of faith in the sacred truths for this\ntime demanded them to be. There are those in the state who minister\nin word and doctrine, who are not thorough workmen. Although\nthey believe the theory of the truth, and have been preaching for\nyears, they will never be competent laborers until they work upon\na different plan. They have spent much time among the churches,\nwhen they are not qualified to benefit them. They themselves are\nnot consecrated to God. They need the spirit of endurance to suffer\nfor Christ\u2019s sake, \u201cto drink of the cup,\u201d and \u201cbe baptized with the\nbaptism,\u201d before they are prepared to help others. Unselfish, devoted\nworkmen are needed, to bring things up in New York to the Bible\nstandard. These men have not been in the line of their duty in\ntraveling among the churches. If God has called them to His work,\nit is to save sinners. They should prove themselves by going out\ninto new fields, that they may know for themselves whether God has\ncommitted to them the work of saving souls.\nHad Brethren Taylor, Saunders, Cottrell, Whitney, and Brother\nand Sister Lindsay labored in new fields, they would now be far\nin advance of what they are. Meeting the opposition of opponents\nwould drive them to their Bibles for arguments to sustain their posi-\ntion, and this would increase their knowledge of the Scriptures and\nwould give them a consciousness of their ability in God to meet op-\nposition in any form. Those who are content to go over and over the\nsame ground among the churches will be deficient in the experience\nthey should have. They will be weak\u2014not strong to will and do and\nsuffer for the truth\u2019s sake. They will be inefficient workmen.\nThose who have the cause of God at heart and feel love for[49]\nprecious souls for whom Christ died, will not seek their own ease\nor pleasure. They will do as Christ has done. They will go forth \u201cto\n48\nCause in New York 49\nseek and to save that which was lost.\u201d He said: \u201cI came not to call\nthe righteous, but sinners to repentance.\u201d\nIf ministers in New York wish to help the church, they can do\nso in no better way than to go out into new fields and labor to bring\nsouls into the truth. When the church see that the ministers are all\naglow with the spirit of the work, that they feel deeply the force of\nthe truth, and are seeking to bring others to the knowledge of it, it\nwill put new life and vigor into them. Their hearts will be stirred to\ndo what they can to aid in the work. There is not a class of people\nin the world who are more willing to sacrifice of their means to\nadvance the cause than are Seventh-day Adventists. If the ministers\ndo not utterly discourage them by their indolence and inefficiency,\nand by their lack of spirituality, they will generally respond to any\nappeal that may be made that commends itself to their judgment\nand consciences. But they want to see fruit. And it is right that the\nbrethren in New York should demand fruit of their ministers. What\nhave they done? What are they doing?\nMinisters in New York should have been far in advance of what\nthey are. But they have not engaged in that kind of labor which\ncalled forth earnest effort and strong opposition. Had they done so\nthey would have been driven to their Bibles and to prayer in order\nto be able to answer their opponents, and in the exercise of their\ntalents would have doubled them. There are ministers in New York\nwho have been preaching for years, but who cannot be depended\nupon to give a course of lectures. They are dwarfed. They have\nnot exercised their minds in the study of the word and in meeting\nopposition, so that they might become strong in God. Had they,\nlike faithful soldiers of the cross of Christ, gone forth \u201cwithout the\ncamp,\u201d depending upon God and their own energies, rather than\nleaning so heavily upon their brethren, they would have obtained [50]\nan experience, and would now be qualified to engage in the work\nwherever their help is most needed. If the ministers generally in\nNew York had left the churches to labor for themselves, and had\nnot stood in their way, both churches and ministers would now be\nfurther advanced in spirituality and in the knowledge of the truth.\nMany of our brethren and sisters in New York have been back-\nsliding upon health reform. There is but a small number of genuine\nhealth reformers in the state. Light and spiritual understanding have\n50 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nbeen given to the brethren in New York. But the truth that has\nreached the understanding, the light that has shone upon the soul,\nwhich has not been appreciated and cherished, will witness against\nthem in the day of God. Truth has been given to save those who\nwould believe and obey. Their condemnation is not because they did\nnot have the light, but because they had the light and did not walk in\nit.\nGod has furnished man with abundant means for the gratification\nof natural appetite. He has spread before him, in the products of the\nearth, a bountiful variety of food that is palatable to the taste and\nnutritious to the system. Of these our benevolent heavenly Father\nsays that we may \u201cfreely eat.\u201d We may enjoy the fruits, the vegeta-\nbles, the grains, without doing violence to the laws of our being.\nThese articles, prepared in the most simple and natural manner, will\nnourish the body, and preserve its natural vigor without the use of\nflesh meats.\nGod created man a little lower than the angels and bestowed upon\nhim attributes that will, if properly used, make him a blessing to the\nworld and cause him to reflect the glory to the Giver. But although\nmade in the image of God, man has, through intemperance, violated\nprinciple and God\u2019s law in his physical nature. Intemperance of any\nkind benumbs the perceptive organs and so weakens the brain-nerve\npower that eternal things are not appreciated, but placed upon a level\nwith the common. The higher powers of the mind, designed for\nelevated purposes, are brought into slavery to the baser passions.[51]\nIf our physical habits are not right, our mental and moral powers\ncannot be strong; for great sympathy exists between the physical and\nthe moral. The apostle Peter understood this and raised his voice of\nwarning to his brethren: \u201cDearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers\nand pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.\u201d\nThere is but little moral power in the professed Christian world.\nWrong habits have been indulged, and physical and moral laws have\nbeen disregarded, until the general standard of virtue and piety is\nexceedingly low. Habits which lower the standard of physical health\nenfeeble mental and moral strength. The indulgence of unnatural\nappetites and passions has a controlling influence upon the nerves of\nthe brain. The animal organs are strengthened, while the moral are\nCause in New York 51\ndepressed. It is impossible for an intemperate man to be a Christian,\nfor his higher powers are brought into slavery to the passions.\nThose who have had the light upon the subjects of eating and\ndressing with simplicity in obedience to physical and moral laws,\nand who turn from the light which points out their duty, will shun\nduty in other things. If they blunt their consciences to avoid the cross\nwhich they will have to take up to be in harmony with natural law,\nthey will, in order to shun reproach, violate the Ten Commandments.\nThere is a decided unwillingness with some to endure the cross and\ndespise the shame. Some will be laughed out of their principles.\nConformity to the world is gaining ground among God\u2019s people, who\nprofess to be pilgrims and strangers, waiting and watching for the\nLord\u2019s appearing. There are many among professed Sabbathkeepers\nin New York who are more firmly wedded to worldly fashions and\nlusts than they are to healthy bodies, sound minds, or sanctified\nhearts.\nGod is testing and proving individuals in New York. He has\npermitted some to have a measure of prosperity, to develop what\nis in their hearts. Pride and love of the world have separated them\nfrom God. The principles of truth are virtually sacrificed, while they\nprofess to love the truth. Christians should wake up and act. Their [52]\ninfluence is telling upon, and molding, the opinions and habits of\nothers. They will have to bear the weighty responsibility of deciding\nby their influence the destiny of souls.\nThe Lord, by close and pointed truths for these last days, is\ncleaving out a people from the world and purifying them unto Him-\nself. Pride and unhealthful fashions, the love of display, the love of\napprobation\u2014all must be left with the world if we would be renewed\nin knowledge after the image of Him who created us. \u201cFor the grace\nof God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us\nthat, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,\nrighteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed\nhope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour\nJesus Christ; who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us\nfrom all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous\nof good works.\u201d\nThe church in ----- need sifting. A thorough conversion is neces-\nsary before they can be in working order. Selfishness, pride, envy,\n52 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nmalice, evil surmising, backbiting, gossiping, and tattling have been\ncherished among them, until the Spirit of God has but little to do\nwith them. While some who profess to know God remain in their\npresent state, their prayers are an abomination in His sight. They do\nnot sustain their faith by their works, and it would have been better\nfor some never to have professed the truth than to have dishonored\ntheir profession as they have. While they profess to be servants of\nChrist, they are servants of the enemy of righteousness; and their\nworks testify of them that they are not acquainted with God and that\ntheir hearts are not in obedience to the will of Christ. They make\nchild\u2019s play of religion; they act like pettish children.\nThe children of God, the world over, are one great brotherhood.\nOur Saviour has clearly defined the spirit and principles which should\ngovern the actions of those who, by their consistent, holy lives,\ndistinguish themselves from the world. Love for one another, and[53]\nsupreme love to their heavenly Father, should be exemplified in\ntheir conversation and works. The present condition of many of the\nchildren of God is like that of a family of ungrateful and quarrelsome\nchildren.\nThere is danger of even ministers in New York being of that class\nwho are ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of\nthe truth. They do not practice what they learn. They are hearers,\nbut not doers. These ministers need an experience in the truth that\nwill enable them to comprehend the elevated character of the work.\nWe are living in a most solemn, important time of this earth\u2019s\nhistory. We are amid the perils of the last days. Important and fearful\nevents are before us. How necessary that all who do fear God and\nlove His law should humble themselves before Him, and be afflicted\nand mourn, and confess the sins that have separated God from His\npeople. That which should excite the greatest alarm, is that we do\nnot feel or understand our condition, our low estate, and that we are\nsatisfied to remain as we are. We should flee to the word of God and\nto prayer, individually seeking the Lord earnestly, that we may find\nHim. We should make this our first business.\nThe members of the church are responsible for the talents com-\nmitted to their trust, and it is impossible for Christians to meet their\nresponsibilities unless they occupy that elevated position that is in\naccordance with the sacred truths which they profess. The light that\nCause in New York 53\nshines upon our pathway makes us responsible to let that light shine\nforth to others in such a manner that they will glorify God.\nRelatives in the Church\nThe advancement of the church in ----- in spiritual things is not\nin proportion to the light which has shone upon their pathway. God\nhas committed to each talents to be improved by putting them out\nto the exchangers, that when the Master comes He may receive His\nown with usury. The church at ----- is largely composed of valuable [54]\nmaterial, but its members fail to reach the high standard which it is\ntheir privilege to attain.\nThe working material in the church is found mostly in branches\nof three families which are connected by marriage. There is more\ntalent in the church, and more material to make good workmen, than\ncan be employed to advantage in that locality. The entire church\nare not growing in spirituality. They are not favorably situated to\ndevelop strength by calling into exercise the talents that God has\ngiven them. There is not room for all to work. One gets in the way\nof another. There is a lack of spiritual strength. If this church were\nless a family church each would feel individual responsibility.\nIf the talent and influence of several of its members should be\nexercised in other churches, where they would be drawn out to help\nwhere help is really needed, they would be obtaining an experience\nof the highest value in spiritual things, and by thus bearing respon-\nsibilities and burdens in the work of God would be a blessing to\nothers. While engaged in helping others, they would be following\nthe example of Christ. He came not to be ministered unto, but to\nminister to others. He pleased not Himself. He made Himself of no\nreputation, but took upon Himself the form of a servant, and spent\nHis life in doing good. He could have spent His days on earth in\nease and plenty, and have appropriated to Himself the enjoyments of\nthis life. But He lived not to enjoy, He lived to do good and to save\nothers from suffering, and His example is for us to follow.\nIf consecrated to God, Brethren I and J could bear greater respon-\nsibilities than they have borne. They have thought that they would\nbe prompt to respond to any call that should be made for means, and\nthat this was the principal burden that they had to bear in the cause\n54 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nof God. But God requires more of them than this. If they had trained\ntheir minds to a more critical study of the word of God, that they\nmight have become laborers in His cause, and had worked for the\nsalvation of sinners as earnestly as they have to obtain the things of[55]\nthis life, they would have developed strength and wisdom to engage\nin the work of God where laborers are greatly needed.\nThese brethren, by remaining in a family community, are being\ndwarfed in mental and spiritual strength. It is not the best policy\nfor children of one, two, or three families that are connected by\nmarriage, to settle within a few miles of one another. The influence\nis not good on the parties. The business of one is the business of all.\nThe perplexities and troubles which every family must experience\nmore or less, and which, as far as possible, should be confined within\nthe limits of the family circle, are extended to family connections,\nand have a bearing upon the religious meetings. There are matters\nwhich should not be known to a third person, however friendly and\nclosely connected he may be. Individuals and families should bear\nthem. But the close relationship of several families, brought into\nconstant intercourse, has a tendency to break down the dignity which\nshould be maintained in every family. In performing the delicate\nduty of reproving and admonishing, there will be danger of injuring\nfeelings, unless it be done with the greatest tenderness and care. The\nbest models of character are liable to errors and mistakes, and great\ncare should be exercised that too much is not made of little things.\nSuch family and church relationship as exists in ----- is very\npleasant to the natural feelings; but it is not the best, all things\nconsidered, for the development of symmetrical Christian characters.\nThe close relationship and the familiar associations with one another,\nwhile united in church capacity, render the influence feeble. That\ndignity, that high regard, confidence, and love that make a prosperous\nchurch is not preserved. All parties would be much happier to be\nseparated and to visit occasionally, and their influence upon one\nanother would be tenfold greater.\nUnited as these families are by marriage, and mingling as they do\nin one another\u2019s society, each is awake to the faults and errors of the\nothers, and feels in duty bound to correct them; and because these\nrelatives are really dear to one another, they are grieved over little[56]\nthings that they would not notice in those not so closely connected.\nCause in New York 55\nKeen sufferings of mind are endured, because feelings will arise with\nsome that they have not been treated impartially and with all that\nconsideration which they deserved. Petty jealousies sometimes arise,\nand molehills become mountains. These little misunderstandings\nand petty variances cause more severe suffering of mind than do\ntrials that come from other sources.\nThese things make these truly conscientious, noble-minded men\nand women feeble to endure, and they are not developing the char-\nacter they might were they differently situated. They are dwarfed in\nmental and spiritual growth, which threatens to destroy their useful-\nness. Their labors and interests are confined mostly to themselves.\nTheir influence is narrowed down when it should be widening and\nbecoming more general, that they may, by being placed in a variety\nof circumstances, bring into exercise the powers which God has\ngiven them, in such a manner as shall contribute most to His glory.\nAll the faculties of the mind are capable of high improvement. The\nenergies of the soul need to be aroused and brought into action for\nthe glory of God.\nLaborers for God\nGod calls for missionaries. There are men of ability in the\nchurch at ----- who will grow in capacity and power as they exercise\ntheir talents in the work and cause of God. If these brethren will\neducate themselves to make the cause of God their first interest, and\nwill sacrifice their pleasure and inclination for the truth\u2019s sake, the\nblessing of God will rest upon them. These brethren, who love the\ntruth, and who have been for years rejoicing because of increasing\nlight upon the Scriptures, should let their light shine forth to those\nwho are in darkness. God will be to them wisdom and power, and\nwill glorify Himself in working with and by those who wholly follow\nHim. \u201cIf any man serve Me, him will My Father honor.\u201d The wisdom\nand power of God will be given to the willing and faithful.\nThe brethren in ----- have been willing to give of their means for [57]\nthe various enterprises, but they have withheld themselves. They\nhave not said: Here am I, Lord; send me. It is not the strength of\nhuman instruments, but the power and wisdom of Him who employs\nthem and works with them that makes men successful in doing the\n56 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nwork that is necessary to be done. By offering our goods to the\nPossessor of heaven and earth while we withhold ourselves, we\ncannot meet His approbation nor secure His blessing. There must\nbe in the hearts of the brethren and sisters in ----- a principle to lay\nall, even themselves, upon the altar of God.\nMen are needed in Battle Creek who can and will take burdens\nand bear responsibilities. The call has been given time and again,\nbut hardly a response has been made. Some would have answered\nthe call if their worldly interests would have been advanced by so\ndoing. But as there was no prospect of increasing their means by\ncoming to Battle Creek, they could see no duty to come. \u201cTo obey\nis better than sacrifice.\u201d And without obedience and unselfish love,\nthe richest offerings are too meager to be presented to the Possessor\nof all things.\nGod calls upon the brethren and sisters in ----- to arise and come\nup to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty.\nThe reason why there is so little strength among those who profess\nthe truth is that they do not exercise the ability that God has given\nthem. Very many have wrapped their talent in a napkin and hid it in\nthe earth. It is by using the talents that they increase. God will test\nand prove His people.\nBrother and Sister I have been faithful burden bearers in the\ncause of God, and now their children should not stand back and let\nthe burdens rest so heavily upon them. It is time that the powers of\nthe less-worn minds of the children should be exercised and they\nwork more especially in the Master\u2019s vineyard.\nSome of the brethren and sisters in New York have felt anxious\nthat Brother and Sister K, especially Sister K, should be encouraged\nto labor among the churches. But this is the wrong place for them to[58]\nprove themselves. If God has indeed laid upon them the burden of\nlabor, it is not for the churches; for these are generally in advance of\nthem. There is a world before Brother and Sister K, a world lying\nin wickedness. Their field is a large one. They have plenty of room\nto try their gifts and test their calling without entering into other\nmen\u2019s labors and building upon a foundation that they have not laid.\nBrother and Sister K have been very slow to obtain an experience in\nself-denial. They have been slow to adopt the health reform in all\nits branches. The churches are in advance of them in the denial of\nCause in New York 57\nappetite. Therefore they cannot be a benefit to the churches in this\ndirection, but rather a hindrance.\nBrother K has not been a blessing to the church in -----, but a\ngreat burden. He has stood directly in the way of their advancement.\nHe has not been in a condition to help when and where they needed\nhelp the most. He has not correctly represented our faith; his conver-\nsation and life have not been unto holiness. He has been far behind,\nand has not been ready or willing to discern the leadings of God\u2019s\nprovidence. He has stood in the way of sinners; he has not been\nin such a position that his influence would recommend our faith to\nunbelievers.\nHis example has been a hindrance to the church and to his un-\nbelieving neighbors. If Brother K had been wholly consecrated to\nGod, his works would have been fruitful, productive of much good.\nBut that which more especially distinguishes God\u2019s people from the\npopular religious bodies is not their profession alone, but their exem-\nplary characters and their principles of unselfish love. The powerful,\npurifying influence of the Spirit of God upon the heart, carried out\nin words and works, separates them from the world and designates\nthem as God\u2019s peculiar people. The character and disposition of\nChrist\u2019s followers will be like their Master\u2019s. He is the pattern, the\nholy and perfect example given for Christians to imitate. His true\nfollowers will love their brethren and be in harmony with them.\nThey will love their neighbors as Christ has given them example and [59]\nwill make any sacrifice if they can by so doing persuade souls to\nleave their sins and be converted to the truth.\nThe truth, deeply rooted in the hearts of believers, will spring\nup and bear fruit unto righteousness. Their words and works are\nthe channels through which the pure principles of truth and holiness\nare conveyed to the world. Especial blessings and privileges are for\nthose who love the truth and walk according to the light they have\nreceived. If they neglect to do this, their light will become darkness.\nWhen the people of God become self-sufficient, the Lord leaves\nthem to their own wisdom. Mercy and truth are promised to the\nhumble in heart, the obedient and faithful.\nBrother K has stood in the way of his children. If he had been\nconsecrated to God, having his heart in the work, and living out the\n58 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ntruth he professed, he would have felt the importance of commanding\nhis household after him, as did faithful Abraham.\nThe lack of harmony and love between the two brothers K is a\nreproach to the cause of God. Both are at fault. Both have a work\nto do in subduing self and cultivating the Christian graces. God is\ndishonored by the dissensions, and I do not go too far when I say\nhatred, that exist between these two natural brothers. Brother A K\nis greatly at fault. He has cherished feelings that have not been in\naccordance with the will of God. He knows the peculiarities of his\nbrother, B K, that he has a fretful, unhappy temperament. Frequently\nhe cannot see good when it lies directly in his path. He sees only evil\nand becomes discouraged very easily. Satan magnifies a molehill\ninto a mountain before him. All things considered, Brother B K has\nin many things pursued a less censurable course than his brother,\nbecause it has been less injurious to the cause of present truth.\nThese natural brothers must be fully reconciled to each other\nbefore they can lift the reproach from the cause of God that their\ndisunion has caused. \u201cIn this the children of God are manifest, and[60]\nthe children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not\nof God, neither he that loveth not his brother.\u201d \u201cHe that saith he is\nin the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.\u201d\nThose who labor for God should be clean vessels, sanctified to the\nMaster\u2019s use. \u201cBe ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.\u201d \u201cIf\na man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he\nthat loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God\nwhom he hath not seen? And this commandment have we from Him,\nThat he who loveth God love his brother also.\u201d\nThe ambassadors of Christ have a responsible and sacred work\nbefore them. They are savors of life unto life, or of death unto death.\nTheir influence decides the destiny of souls for whom Christ died.\nBrother and Sister K both lack experience. Their lives have not been\nunto holiness. They have not had a deep and thorough knowledge of\nthe divine will. They have not been steadily advancing onward and\nupward in the divine life, so that their experience could be of value\nto the church. Their course has burdened the church not a little.\nSister K\u2019s past life has not been of such a character that her\nexperience could be a blessing to others. She has not lived up to\nher convictions of duty. Her conscience has been violated too many\nCause in New York 59\ntimes. She has been a pleasure seeker and has given her life to\nvanity, frivolity, and fashion, in face of the light of truth which has\nshone upon her pathway. She knew the way, but neglected to walk\nin it. The Lord gave Sister K a testimony of warning and reproof.\nShe believed the testimony and separated herself from that class\nwho were lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. Then, as she\nviewed her past life, so full of neglects and wrongs, she gave up to\nunbelief and stolid gloom. Despair spread its dark wings over her.\nHer marriage to Brother K changed the order of things somewhat,\nbut at times since she has been very gloomy and desponding.\nSister K has a good knowledge of the prophecies and can trace\nthem and speak upon them very readily. Some of the brethren and\nsisters have been anxious to urge Brother and Sister K to go out as [61]\nactive laborers. But there is danger of their working from a wrong\nstandpoint. Sister K\u2019s educational advantages have been superior\nto those of many by whom she is surrounded. As she has labored\npublicly, she has depended upon her own strength more than upon\nthe Spirit of God. She has had a spirit of lofty independence and\nhas thought that she was qualified to teach rather than be taught.\nWith her lack of experience in spiritual things she is unprepared to\nlabor among the churches. She has not the discernment and spiritual\nstrength necessary to build them up. If she and her husband engage in\nthis work at all, they should commence by exerting a good influence\nin the church at -----. Their labor should be bestowed where the\nwork most needs to be done.\nThere is work to be done in new fields. Sinners who never have\nheard the warning message need to be warned. Here Brother and\nSister K have ample room to work and prove their calling. No one\nshould hinder them in their efforts in new fields. There are sinners to\nsave in every direction. But some ministers are inclined to go over\nand over the same ground among the churches, when their labors\ncannot help them, and their time is wasted.\nWe wish that all the Lord\u2019s servants were laborers. The work\nof warning souls should not be confined to ministers alone, but\nbrethren who have the truth in their hearts, and who have exerted\na good influence at home, should feel that a responsibility rests\nupon them to devote a part of their time to going out among their\nneighbors and into adjoining towns to be missionaries for God. They\n60 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nshould carry our publications and engage in conversation and, in the\nspirit of Christ, pray with and for those whom they visit. This is the\nwork that will arouse a spirit of investigation and reformation.\nFor years the Lord has been calling the attention of His people\nto health reform. This is one of the great branches of the work of\npreparation for the coming of the Son of man. John the Baptist\nwent forth in the spirit and power of Elijah to prepare the way of[62]\nthe Lord and to turn the people to the wisdom of the just. He was\na representative of those living in these last days to whom God has\nentrusted sacred truths to present before the people to prepare the\nway for the second appearing of Christ. John was a reformer. The\nangel Gabriel, direct from heaven, gave a discourse upon health\nreform to the father and mother of John. He said that he should not\ndrink wine or strong drink, and that he should be filled with the Holy\nGhost from his birth.\nJohn separated himself from friends and from the luxuries of life.\nThe simplicity of his dress, a garment woven of camel\u2019s hair, was a\nstanding rebuke to the extravagance and display of the Jewish priests,\nand of the people generally. His diet, purely vegetable, of locusts\nand wild honey, was a rebuke to the indulgence of appetite and the\ngluttony that everywhere prevailed. The prophet Malachi declares:\n\u201cBehold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the\ngreat and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the heart of the\nfathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers.\u201d\nHere the prophet describes the character of the work. Those who are\nto prepare the way for the second coming of Christ are represented\nby faithful Elijah, as John came in the spirit of Elijah to prepare\nthe way for Christ\u2019s first advent. The great subject of reform is to\nbe agitated, and the public mind is to be stirred. Temperance in all\nthings is to be connected with the message, to turn the people of God\nfrom their idolatry, their gluttony, and their extravagance in dress\nand other things.\nThe self-denial, humility, and temperance required of the righ-\nteous, whom God especially leads and blesses, is to be presented to\nthe people in contrast to the extravagant, health-destroying habits\nof those who live in this degenerate age. God has shown that health\nreform is as closely connected with the third angel\u2019s message as\nthe hand is with the body. There is nowhere to be found so great a\nCause in New York 61\ncause of physical and moral degeneracy as a neglect of this important\nsubject. Those who indulge appetite and passion, and close their\neyes to the light for fear they will see sinful indulgences which they\nare unwilling to forsake, are guilty before God. Whoever turns from [63]\nthe light in one instance hardens his heart to disregard the light upon\nother matters. Whoever violates moral obligations in the matter of\neating and dressing prepares the way to violate the claims of God\nin regard to eternal interests. Our bodies are not our own. God\nhas claims upon us to take care of the habitation. He has given us,\nthat we may present our bodies to Him a living sacrifice, holy and\nacceptable. Our bodies belong to Him who made them, and we are\nin duty bound to become intelligent in regard to the best means of\npreserving them from decay. If we enfeeble the body by self-grat-\nification, by indulging the appetite, and by dressing in accordance\nwith health-destroying fashions, in order to be in harmony with the\nworld, we become enemies of God.\nBrother and Sister K have not appreciated the light upon health\nreform. They have not seen a place for it in connection with the\nthird message. Providence has been leading the people of God out\nfrom the extravagant habits of the world, away from the indulgence\nof appetite and passion, to take their stand upon the platform of\nself-denial and temperance in all things. The people whom God\nis leading will be peculiar. They will not be like the world. But if\nthey follow the leadings of God they will accomplish His purposes,\nand will yield their will to His will. Christ will dwell in the heart.\nThe temple of God will be holy. Your body, says the apostle, is the\ntemple of the Holy Ghost. God does not require His children to deny\nthemselves to the injury of physical strength. He requires them to\nobey natural law, to preserve physical health. Nature\u2019s path is the\nroad He marks out, and it is broad enough for any Christian. God\nhas, with a lavish hand, provided us with rich and varied bounties\nfor our sustenance and enjoyment. But in order for us to enjoy the\nnatural appetite, which will preserve health and prolong life, He\nrestricts the appetite. He says: Beware; restrain, deny, unnatural\nappetite. If we create a perverted appetite, we violate the laws of\nour being and assume the responsibility of abusing our bodies and\nof bringing disease upon ourselves.\nThe spirit and power of Elijah have been stirring hearts to reform [64]\n62 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nand directing them to the wisdom of the just. Brother and Sister K\nhave not been converted to the health reform, notwithstanding the\namount of evidence that God has given upon the subject. Self-denial\nis essential to genuine religion. Those who have not learned to deny\nthemselves are destitute of vital, practical godliness. We cannot\nexpect anything else than that the claims of religion will come in\ncontact with the natural affections and worldly interests. There is\nwork for everyone in the vineyard of the Lord. None should be idle.\nAngels of God are all astir, ascending to heaven and descending to\nearth again with messages of mercy and warning. These heavenly\nmessengers are moving upon minds and hearts. There are men and\nwomen everywhere whose hearts are susceptible of being inspired\nwith the truth. If those who have a knowledge of the truth would\nnow work in unison with the Spirit of God, we would see a great\nwork accomplished.\nNew fields are open in which all can test their calling by exper-\nimental effort in bringing souls out from darkness and error, and\nestablishing them upon the platform of eternal truth. If Brother and\nSister K feel that God has called them to engage in His work, they\nhave enough to do to call sinners to repentance; but in order for God\nto work in and through them, they need a thorough conversion. The\nwork of fitting a people in these last days for the coming of Christ, is\na most sacred, solemn work, and calls for devoted, unselfish laborers.\nThose who have humility, faith, energy, perseverance, and decision\nwill find plenty to do in their Master\u2019s vineyard. There are respon-\nsible duties to be performed, which require earnestness and the\nexertion of all their energies. It is willing service that God accepts.\nIf the truth we profess is of such infinite importance as to decide the\ndestiny of souls, how careful should we be in its presentation.\n\u201cThe path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and\nmore unto the perfect day.\u201d Brother and Sister K, had you walked in\nthe light as it shone upon your pathway, had you been drawing nearer[65]\nto God, steadfastly believing the truth and walking humbly before\nGod in the light He has given, you would now have an experience\nthat would be of inestimable value. Had you improved the talents\nlent you of God, you would have shone as lights in the world. But\nlight becomes darkness to all those who will not walk in it. In order\nto be accepted and blessed of God as our fathers were, we must, like\nCause in New York 63\nthem, be faithful. We must improve our light as the ancient, faithful\nprophets improved theirs. God requires of us according to the grace\nthat He has bestowed upon us, and He will not accept less than He\nclaims. All His righteous demands must be fully met. In order for\nus to discharge our responsibilities, we must stand on that elevated\nground which the order and advancement of holy, sacred truth has\nprepared for us.\nBrother L fails to realize the sanctifying influence of the truth of\nGod upon the heart. He is not as patient, humble, and forbearing as\nhe should be. He is easily stirred; self arises, and he says and does\nmany things without due reflection. He does not at all times exert\na saving influence. If he were imbued with the Spirit of Christ, he\ncould with one hand take hold of the Mighty One, while with the\nhand of faith and love he would reach the poor sinner. Brother L\nneeds the powerful influence of divine love; for this will renew and\nrefine the heart, sanctify the life, and elevate and ennoble the entire\nman. Then his words and works will savor of heaven rather than of\nhis own spirit.\nIf the words of eternal life are sown in the heart, fruit will be\nproduced unto righteousness and peace. A spirit of self-sufficiency\nand self-importance must be overcome by you, my dear brother. You\nshould cultivate a spirit that is willing to be instructed and counseled.\nWhatever others may say or do, you should say: What is that to\nme? Christ has bidden me follow Him. You should cultivate a\nspirit of meekness. You need an experience in genuine godliness,\nand unless you have this, you cannot engage in the work of God\nunderstandingly. Your spirit must soften and be subdued by being [66]\nbrought into obedience to the will of Christ. You should at all times\nmaintain the lowly dignity of a follower of Jesus. Our deportment,\nour words and actions, preach to others. We are living epistles,\nknown and read of all men.\nYou should be careful not to preach the truth from strife or\ncontention, for if you do you will most assuredly turn the battle\nagainst yourself and be found advancing the cause of the enemy\nrather than the truth of God. Every time that you engage in a contest\nit should be from a sense of duty. If you make God your strength\nand subdue yourself, and let the truth bear away the victory, the\ndevices of Satan and his fiery darts will fall upon himself, and you\n64 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nwill be strengthened, kept from error, and guarded from every false\nway. You need to cultivate caution and not rush on in your own\nstrength. The work is important and sacred, and you need great\nwisdom. You should counsel with your brethren who have had\nexperience in the work. But, above everything else, you should\nobtain a thorough knowledge of your own weakness and dangers,\nand should strengthen the weak points in your character, that you\nmay not make shipwreck of faith.\nWe are living amid the perils of the last days, and if we have\na spirit of self-sufficiency and independence we shall be exposed\nto the wiles of Satan and be overcome. Self-importance must be\nput away from you, and you be hid in God, depending alone upon\nHim for strength. The churches do not need your labor. If you are\nconsecrated to God, you can labor in new fields, and God will work\nwith you. Purity of heart and life God will accept. Anything short\nof this, He will not regard. We must suffer with Christ if we would\nreign with Him.\nBrother M could have accomplished good if he had, years ago,\ngiven all for Christ. He has not been sanctified through the truth; his\nheart has not been right with God. He has hid his talent in the earth.\nWhat will he who has put his talents to a wrong use say when the\nMaster shall require him to give account of his stewardship? Brother[67]\nM has not been an honor to the cause of God. It is dangerous\nto contend with the providence of God and to be dissatisfied with\nalmost everything, as though there had been a special arrangement\nof circumstances to tempt and destroy. The work of pruning and\npurifying to fit us for heaven is a great work and will cost us much\nsuffering and trial, because our wills are not subjected to the will of\nChrist. We must go through the furnace till the fires have consumed\nthe dross and we are purified and reflect the divine image. Those who\nfollow their inclinations and are governed by appearances are not\ngood judges of what God is doing. They are filled with discontent.\nThey see failure where there is indeed triumph, a great loss where\nthere is gain; and, like Jacob, they are ready to exclaim, \u201cAll these\nthings are against me,\u201d when the very things whereof they complain\nare all working together for their good.\nNo cross, no crown. How can one be strong in the Lord without\ntrials? To have strength we must have exercise. To have strong\nCause in New York 65\nfaith, we must be placed in circumstances where our faith will be\nexercised. The apostle Paul, just before his martyrdom, exhorted\nTimothy: \u201cBe thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according\nto the power of God.\u201d It is through much tribulation that we are to\nenter the kingdom of God. Our Saviour was tried in every possible\nway, and yet He triumphed in God continually. It is our privilege\nto be strong in the strength of God under all circumstances and to\nglory in the cross of Christ.\n* * * * *\nChapter 6\u2014Experience Not Reliable\nDear Sister N,\nIn the view given me December 10, 1871, I saw that some things\nhad been great hindrances to your recovery of health. Your peculiar\ntraits of character have prevented you from receiving the good you\nmight have received, and from improving in health as you might\nhave improved. You have a special routine to go through and you[68]\nwill not be turned aside from it. You have your ideas, which you\ncarry out, when frequently they are not in harmony with physical\nlaw, but simply with your judgment.\nYou have a strong mind and set will, and you think you under-\nstand your own case better than others can, because you trace your\nfeelings. You are guided by your feelings and are governed by your\nexperience. You have tried this and that plan to your entire satisfac-\ntion, and have decided that your judgment was the best to follow in\nyour own case. But what has been your standard? Answer: Your\nfeelings. Now, my sister, what have your feelings to do with the real\nfacts in the case? But very little. Feelings are a poor criterion, espe-\ncially when under the control of a strong imagination and firm will.\nYou have a very determined mind, and your course is mapped out\nbefore you; but you do not view your case from a correct standpoint.\nYour judgment is not safe to be relied upon when it relates to your\nown case.\nI was shown that you had made some improvement, but not as\nmuch, as fast, or as thorough, as you might, because you take your\ncase into your own hands. For this reason, and that you might feel it\nyour duty to be guided by the judgment of the more experienced, I\nwished you to come to the Health Institute. The physicians of the\nHealth Institute understand disease, its causes and proper treatment,\nbetter than you can; and if you will yield your set ideas willingly,\nand abide by their judgment, there is hope of your recovery. But\nif you refuse to do this, I see no hope of your becoming what you\nmight be with proper treatment.\n66\nExperience Not Reliable 67\nAs I have before stated, you, my sister, rely upon experience.\nYour experience decides you to pursue a certain course. But that\nwhich many term experience is not experience at all; it is simply\nhabit, or mere indulgence, blindly and frequently ignorantly fol-\nlowed, with a firm, set determination, and without intelligent thought\nor inquiry relative to the laws at work in the accomplishment of the\nresult.\nReal experience is a variety of careful experiments made with [69]\nthe mind freed from prejudice and uncontrolled by previously es-\ntablished opinions and habits. The results are marked with careful\nsolicitude and an anxious desire to learn, to improve, and to reform\non every habit that is not in harmony with physical and moral laws.\nThe idea of others\u2019 gainsaying what you have learned by experience\nseems to you to be folly and even cruelty itself. But there are more\nerrors received and firmly retained from false ideas of experience\nthan from any other cause, for the reason that what is generally\ntermed experience is not experience at all; because there has never\nbeen a fair trial by actual experiment and thorough investigation,\nwith a knowledge of the principle involved in the action.\nYour experience was shown to me as not reliable, because op-\nposed to natural law. It is in conflict with the unchangeable principles\nof nature. Superstition, my dear sister, arising from a diseased imag-\nination, arrays you in conflict with science and principle. Which\nshall be yielded? Your strong prejudices and very set ideas in regard\nto what course is best to be pursued relative to yourself have long\nheld you from good. I have understood your case for years, but have\nfelt incompetent to present the matter in so clear a manner that you\ncould see and comprehend it, and put to a practical use the light\ngiven you.\nThere are many invalids today who will ever remain so because\nthey cannot be convinced that their experience is not reliable. The\nbrain is the capital of the body, the seat of all the nervous forces and\nof mental action. The nerves proceeding from the brain control the\nbody. By the brain nerves, mental impressions are conveyed to all\nthe nerves of the body as by telegraph wires; and they control the\nvital action of every part of the system. All the organs of motion are\ngoverned by the communications they receive from the brain.\n68 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nIf your mind is impressed and fixed that a bath will injure you,\nthe mental impression is communicated to all the nerves of the body.\nThe nerves control the circulation of the blood; therefore the blood[70]\nis, through the impression of the mind, confined to the blood vessels,\nand the good effects of the bath are lost. All this is because the\nblood is prevented by the mind and will from flowing readily, and\nfrom coming to the surface to stimulate, arouse, and promote the\ncirculation. For instance, you are impressed that if you bathe you\nwill become chilly. The brain sends this intelligence to the nerves\nof the body, and the blood vessels, held in obedience to your will,\ncannot perform their office and cause a reaction after the bath. There\nis no reason in science or philosophy why an occasional bath, taken\nwith studious care, should do you anything but real good. Especially\nis this the case where there is but little exercise to keep the muscles\nin action and to aid the circulation of the blood through the system.\nBathing frees the skin from the accumulation of impurities which are\nconstantly collecting, and keeps the skin moist and supple, thereby\nincreasing and equalizing the circulation.\nPersons in health should on no account neglect bathing. They\nshould by all means bathe as often as twice a week. Those who\nare not in health have impurities of the blood, and the skin is not\nin a healthy condition. The multitude of pores, or little mouths,\nthrough which the body breathes become clogged and filled with\nwaste matter. The skin needs to be carefully and thoroughly cleansed,\nthat the pores may do their work in freeing the body from impurities;\ntherefore feeble persons who are diseased surely need the advantages\nand blessings of bathing as often as twice a week, and frequently\neven more than this is positively necessary. Whether a person is sick\nor well, respiration is more free and easy if bathing is practiced. By\nit the muscles become more flexible, the mind and body are alike\ninvigorated, the intellect is made brighter, and every faculty becomes\nlivelier. The bath is a soother of the nerves. It promotes general\nperspiration, quickens the circulation, overcomes obstructions in\nthe system, and acts beneficially on the kidneys and urinary organs.\nBathing helps the bowels, stomach, and liver, giving energy and new\nlife to each. It also promotes digestion, and instead of the system\u2019s[71]\nbeing weakened it is strengthened. Instead of increasing the liability\nto cold, a bath, properly taken, fortifies against cold because the\nExperience Not Reliable 69\ncirculation is improved and the uterine organs, which are more or\nless congested, are relieved; for the blood is brought to the surface,\nand a more easy and regular flow of the blood through all the blood\nvessels is obtained.\nExperience is said to be the best teacher. Genuine experience\nis indeed superior to book knowledge. But habits and customs\ngird men and women as with iron bands, and they are generally\njustified by experience, according to the common understanding of\nthe term. Very many have abused precious experience. They have\nclung to their injurious habits, which are decidedly enfeebling to\nphysical, mental, and moral health; and when you seek to instruct\nthem, they sanction their course by referring to their experience. But\ntrue experience is in harmony with natural law and science.\nHere is where we have met the greatest difficulties in religious\nmatters. The plainest facts may be presented, the clearest truths,\nsustained by the word of God, may be brought before the mind; but\nthe ear and heart are closed, and the all-convincing argument is: \u201cmy\nexperience.\u201d Some will say: \u201cThe Lord has blessed me in believing\nand doing as I have; therefore I cannot be in error.\u201d \u201cMy experience\u201d\nis clung to, and the most elevating, sanctifying truths of the Bible are\nrejected for what they are pleased to style experience. Many of the\ngrossest habits are cherished under the plea of experience. Many fail\nto reach that physical, intellectual, and moral improvement which it\nis their privilege and duty to attain, because they will contend for the\nreliability and safety of their experience, although that misjudged\nexperience is opposed to the plainest revealed facts. Men and women\nwhose wrong habits have destroyed their constitution and health will\nbe found recommending their experience as safe for others to follow,\nwhen it is this very experience that has robbed them of vitality and\nhealth. Many examples might be given to show how men and women [72]\nhave been deceived by relying upon their experience.\nThe Lord made man upright in the beginning. He was created\nwith a perfectly balanced mind, the size and strength of all its organs\nbeing perfectly developed. Adam was a perfect type of man. Every\nquality of mind was well proportioned, each having a distinctive\noffice, and yet all dependent one upon another for the full and proper\nuse of any one of them. Adam and Eve were permitted to eat of all\nthe trees in the garden, save one. The Lord said to the holy pair:\n70 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nIn the day that ye eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, ye\nshall surely die. Eve was beguiled by the serpent to believe that God\nwould not do as He said He would. \u201cYe shall not surely die,\u201d said the\nserpent. Eve ate and imagined that she felt the sensations of a new\nand more exalted life. She bore the fruit to her husband, and that\nwhich had an overpowering influence upon him was her experience.\nThe serpent had said that she should not die, and she felt no ill effects\nfrom the fruit, nothing which could be interpreted to mean death,\nbut, just as the serpent had said, a pleasurable sensation which she\nimagined was as the angels felt. Her experience stood arrayed against\nthe positive command of Jehovah, and Adam permitted himself to be\nseduced by the experience of his wife. Thus it is with the religious\nworld generally. God\u2019s express commands are transgressed, and\nbecause \u201csentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,\ntherefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.\u201d\nIn the face of the most positive commands of God, men and\nwomen will follow their own inclinations and then dare to pray\nover the matter, to prevail upon God to consent to allow them to\ngo contrary to His expressed will. The Lord is not pleased with\nsuch prayers. Satan comes to the side of such persons, as he did\nto Eve in Eden, and impresses them, and they have an exercise of\nmind, and this they relate as a most wonderful experience which the\nLord has given them. A true experience will be in perfect harmony\nwith natural and divine law. False experience will array itself against[73]\nscience and the principles of Jehovah. The religious world is covered\nwith a pall of moral darkness. Superstition and bigotry control the\nminds of men and women, and blind their judgment so that they\ndo not discern their duty to their fellow men and their duty to yield\nunquestioned obedience to the will of God.\nBalaam inquired of God if he might curse Israel, because in so\ndoing he had the promise of great reward. And God said, \u201cThou\nshalt not go;\u201d but he was urged by the messengers, and greater\ninducements were presented. Balaam had been shown the will of\nthe Lord in this matter, but he was so eager for the reward that he\nventured to ask God the second time. The Lord permitted Balaam\nto go. Then he had a wonderful experience, but who would wish\nto be guided by such an experience? There are those who would\nunderstand their duty clearly if it were in harmony with their natural\nExperience Not Reliable 71\ninclinations. Circumstances and reason may clearly indicate their\nduty; but when against their natural inclination, these evidences are\nfrequently set aside. Then these persons will presume to go to God\nto learn their duty. But God will not be trifled with. He will permit\nsuch persons to follow the desires of their own hearts. Psalm 81:11,\n12: \u201cBut My people would not hearken to My voice.\u201d \u201cSo I gave\nthem up unto their own hearts\u2019 lust: and they walked in their own\ncounsels.\u201d\nThose who desire to follow a course which pleases their fancy\nare in danger of being left to follow their own inclinations, suppos-\ning them to be the leadings of God\u2019s Spirit. The duty of some is\nindicated sufficiently clear by circumstances and facts; but, through\nthe solicitations of friends, in harmony with their own inclinations,\nthey swerve from the path of duty and pass over the clear evidences\nin the case; then, with apparent conscientiousness, they pray long\nand earnestly for light. They have earnest feeling in the matter, and\nthey interpret this to be the Spirit of God. But they are deceived.\nThis course grieves the Spirit of God. They had light and in the\nvery reason of things should have understood their duty; but a few [74]\npleasing inducements balance their minds in the wrong direction,\nand they urge these before the Lord and press their case, and the\nLord allows them to have their own way. They have so strong an\ninclination to follow their own course that He permits them to do so\nand to suffer the results. These imagine that they have a wonderful\nexperience.\nMy dear sister, firmness is a strong and controlling influence in\nyour mind. You have acquired strength to stand up and brace against\nopposition, and carry through difficult and perplexing enterprises.\nYou do not love contention. You are highly sensitive and feel deeply.\nYou are strictly conscientious, and your judgment must be convinced\nbefore you will yield to the opinions of others. Had your physical\nhealth been unimpaired, you would have made an eminently useful\nwoman. You have long been diseased, and this has affected your\nimagination so that your thoughts have been concentrated upon\nyourself, and the imagination has affected the body. Your habits\nhave not been good in many respects. Your food has not been of\nthe right quantity or quality. You have eaten too largely and of a\npoor quality of food which could not be converted into good blood.\n72 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nYou have educated the stomach to this kind of diet. This, your\njudgment has taught you, was the best, because you realized the\nleast disturbance from it. But this was not a correct experience.\nYour stomach was not receiving that vigor that it should from your\nfood. Taken in a liquid state your food would not give healthful\nvigor or tone to the system. But when you change this habit, and\neat more solids and less liquids, your stomach will feel disturbed.\nNotwithstanding this you should not yield the point; you should\neducate your stomach to bear a more solid diet. You have worn\ntoo great an amount of clothing and have debilitated the skin by so\ndoing. You have not given your body a chance to breathe. The pores\nof the skin, or little mouths through which the body breathes, have\nbecome closed, and the system has been filled with impurities.\nYour habit of riding out in the open air and sunshine has been[75]\nvery beneficial. Your life out of doors has sustained you so that\nyou have the measure of physical strength that you now enjoy. But\nyou have neglected other exercise which was even more essential\nthan this. You have depended upon your carriage to go even a short\ndistance. You have thought that if you walked even a little way it\nwould injure you, and you have felt weary in doing so. But in this\nyour experience is not reliable.\nThe same power of motion which you exercise in getting in and\nout of a carriage, and in going up and down stairs, could just as\nwell be exercised in walking and in performing the ordinary and\nnecessary duties of life. You have been very helpless in regard to\ndomestic duties. You have not felt that you could have the care of\nyour husband\u2019s clothes or of his food. Now, my sister, this inability\nexists more in your imagination than in your inability to perform.\nYou think it will weary and tax you to do this and that; and it does.\nBut you have strength that if put to a practical and economical use\nwould accomplish much good and make you far more useful and\nhappy. You have so great a dread of becoming helpless that you\ndo not exercise the strength with which the Lord has blessed you.\nIn many things you have helped your husband. At the same time\nyou have taxed his patience and strength. When he has thought that\nyou could change some of your habits and improve, you have felt\nthat he did not understand your case. Your friends have felt that\nyou might be more useful in your home and not so helpless. This\nExperience Not Reliable 73\nhas grieved you. You thought they did not understand. Some have\nunwisely pressed their opinion of your case upon you, and this, too,\nhas grieved you. You have felt that God, in answer to prayer, would\nhelp you, and you have many times been helped in this way. But you\nhave not gained that physical strength which it was your privilege\nto enjoy, because you have not performed your part. You have not\nworked in full union with the Spirit of God.\nThe Lord has given you a work to do which He does not propose [76]\nto do for you. You should move out from principle, in harmony with\nnatural law, irrespective of feeling. You should begin to act upon\nthe light that God has given you. You may not be able to do this\nall at once, but you can do much by moving out gradually in faith,\nbelieving that God will be your helper, that He will strengthen you.\nYou could exercise in walking and in performing duties requiring\nlight labor in your family, and not be so dependent upon others.\nThe consciousness that you can do will give you increased strength.\nIf your hands were more employed and your brain less exercised\nin planning for others, your physical and mental strength would\nincrease. Your brain is not idle, but there is not corresponding labor\non the part of the other organs of the body. Exercise, to be of decided\nadvantage to you, should be systematized and brought to bear upon\nthe debilitated organs that they may become strengthened by use.\nThe movement cure is a great advantage to a class of patients who\nare too feeble to exercise. But for all who are sick to rely upon\nit, making it their dependence, while they neglect to exercise their\nmuscles themselves, is a great mistake.\nThousands are sick and dying around us who might get well and\nlive if they would; but their imagination holds them. They fear that\nthey will be made worse if they labor or exercise, when this is just\nthe change they need to make them well. Without this they never\ncan improve. They should exercise the power of the will, rise above\ntheir aches and debility, engage in useful employment, and forget\nthat they have aching backs, sides, lungs, and heads. Neglecting\nto exercise the entire body, or a portion of it, will bring on morbid\nconditions. Inaction of any of the organs of the body will be followed\nby a decrease in size and strength of the muscles, and will cause the\nblood to flow sluggishly through the blood vessels.\n74 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nIf there are duties to be done in your domestic life, you do not\nthink it possible that you could do them, but you depend upon others.\nSometimes it is exceedingly inconvenient for you to obtain the help[77]\nyou need. You frequently expend double the strength required to\nperform the task, in planning and searching for someone to do\nthe work for you. If you would only bring your mind to do these\nlittle acts and family duties yourself, you would be blessed and\nstrengthened in it, and your influence in the cause of God would be\nfar greater. God made Adam and Eve in Paradise, and surrounded\nthem with everything that was useful and lovely. He planted for them\na beautiful garden. No herb nor flower nor tree was wanting which\nmight be for use or ornament. The Creator of man knew that the\nworkmanship of His hands could not be happy without employment.\nParadise delighted their souls, but this was not enough; they must\nhave labor to call into exercise the wonderful organs of the body.\nThe Lord had made the organs for use. Had happiness consisted in\ndoing nothing, man, in his state of holy innocence, would have been\nleft unemployed. But He who formed man knew what would be for\nhis best happiness, and He no sooner made him than He gave him\nhis appointed work. In order to be happy, he must labor.\nGod has given us all something to do. In the discharge of the\nvarious duties which we are to perform, which lie in our pathway,\nour lives will be made useful, and we shall be blessed. Not only\nwill the organs of the body be strengthened by exercise, but the\nmind also will acquire strength and knowledge through the action\nof those organs. The exercise of one muscle, while others are left\nwith nothing to do, will not strengthen the inactive ones any more\nthan the continual exercise of one of the organs of the mind will\ndevelop and strengthen the organs not brought into use. Each faculty\nof the mind and each muscle has its distinctive office, and all require\nto be exercised in order to become properly developed and retain\nhealthful vigor. Each organ and muscle has its work to do in the\nliving organism. Every wheel in the machinery must be a living,\nactive, working wheel. Nature\u2019s fine and wonderful works need to\nbe kept in active motion in order to accomplish the object for which[78]\nthey were designed. Each faculty has a bearing upon the others, and\nall need to be exercised in order to be properly developed. If one\nmuscle of the body is exercised more than another, the one used will\nExperience Not Reliable 75\nbecome much the larger, and will destroy the harmony and beauty\nof the development of the system. A variety of exercise will call into\nuse all the muscles of the body.\nThose who are feeble and indolent should not yield to their incli-\nnation to be inactive, thus depriving themselves of air and sunlight,\nbut should practice exercising out of doors in walking or working in\nthe garden. They will become very much fatigued, but this will not\ninjure them. You, my sister, will experience weariness, yet it will\nnot hurt you; your rest will be sweeter after it. Inaction weakens the\norgans that are not exercised. And when these organs are used, pain\nand weariness are experienced, because the muscles have become\nfeeble. It is not good policy to give up the use of certain muscles\nbecause pain is felt when they are exercised. The pain is frequently\ncaused by the effort of nature to give life and vigor to those parts that\nhave become partially lifeless through inaction. The motion of these\nlong-disused muscles will cause pain, because nature is awakening\nthem to life.\nWalking, in all cases where it is possible, is the best remedy for\ndiseased bodies, because in this exercise all the organs of the body\nare brought into use. Many who depend upon the movement cure\ncould accomplish more for themselves by muscular exercise than the\nmovements can do for them. In some cases want of exercise causes\nthe bowels and muscles to become enfeebled and shrunken, and\nthese organs that have enfeebled for want of use will be strengthened\nby exercise. There is no exercise that can take the place of walking.\nBy it the circulation of the blood is greatly improved.\nThe active use of the limbs will be of the greatest advantage\nto you, Sister N. You have had many notions, and have been very\nsanguine, which has been to your injury. While you fear to trust\nyourself in the hands of the physicians, and think that you understand [79]\nyour case better than they do, you cannot be benefited, but only\nharmed, by their treatment of your case. Unless physicians can\nobtain the confidence of their patients, they can never help them. If\nyou prescribe for yourself, and think you know what treatment you\nshould have, better than the physicians do, you cannot be benefited.\nYou must yield your will and ideas, and not rein yourself up to resist\ntheir judgment and advice in your case.\n76 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nMay the Lord help you, my sister, to have not only faith but\ncorresponding works.\n* * * * *\nChapter 7\u2014Faithfulness in Home Duties\nDear Sister O,\nI think you are not happy. In seeking for some great work to do,\nyou overlook present duties lying directly in your path. You are not\nhappy, because you are looking above the little everyday duties of\nlife for some higher and greater work to do. You are restless, uneasy,\nand dissatisfied. You love to dictate better than you love to perform.\nYou love better to tell others what to do than with ready cheerfulness\nto take hold and do yourself.\nYou could have made your father\u2019s home more happy had you\nstudied your inclination less and the happiness of others more. When\nengaged in the common, ordinary duties of life you fail to put your\nheart into your labor. Your mind is reaching forward and beyond to\na work more agreeable, higher, or more honorable. Somebody must\ndo these very things that you take no pleasure in and even dislike.\nThese plain, simple duties, if done with willingness and faithfulness,\nwill give you an education which it is necessary for you to obtain\nin order to have a love for household duties. Here is an experience\nthat is highly essential for you to gain, but you do not love it. You\nmurmur at your lot, thus making those around you unhappy and\nmeeting with a great loss yourself. You may never be called to do a\nwork which will bring you before the public. But all the work we [80]\ndo that is necessary to be done, be it washing dishes, setting tables,\nwaiting upon the sick, cooking, or washing, is of moral importance;\nand until you can cheerfully and happily take up these duties you\nare not fitted for greater and higher duties. The humble tasks before\nus are to be taken up by someone; and those who do them should\nfeel that they are doing a necessary and honorable work, and that\nin their mission, humble though it may be, they are doing the work\nof God just as surely as was Gabriel when sent to the prophets. All\nare working in their order in their respective spheres. Woman in\nher home, doing the simple duties of life that must be done, can\nand should exhibit faithfulness, obedience, and love as sincere as\n77\n78 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nangels in their sphere. Conformity to the will of God makes any\nwork honorable that must be done.\nWhat you need is love and affection. Your character needs to be\nmolded. Your worrying must be laid aside, and in place of this you\nmust cherish gentleness and love. Deny self. We were not created\nangels, but lower than the angels; yet our work is important. We are\nnot in heaven, but upon the earth. When we are in heaven, then we\nshall be qualified to do the lofty and elevating work of heaven. It is\nhere in this world that we must be tested and proved. We should be\narmed for conflict and for duty.\nThe highest duty that devolves upon youth is in their own homes,\nblessing father and mother, brothers and sisters, by affection and\ntrue interest. Here they can show self-denial and self-forgetfulness\nin caring and doing for others. Never will woman be degraded by\nthis work. It is the most sacred, elevated office that she can fill.\nWhat an influence a sister may have over brothers! If she is right\nshe may determine the character of her brothers. Her prayers, her\ngentleness, and her affection may do much in a household. My\nsister, these noble qualities can never be communicated to other\nminds unless they first exist in your own. That contentment of mind,\nthat affection, gentleness, and sunniness of temper which will reach\nevery heart, will reflect upon you what your heart gives forth to[81]\nothers. If Christ does not reign in the heart, there will be discontent\nand moral deformity. Selfishness will require of others that which we\nare unwilling to give them. If Christ is not in the heart, the character\nwill be unlovely.\nIt is not a great work and great battles alone which try the soul\nand demand courage. Everyday life brings its perplexities, trials,\nand discouragements. It is the humble work which frequently draws\nupon the patience and the fortitude. Self-reliance and resolution will\nbe necessary to meet and conquer all difficulties. Secure the Lord to\nstand with you, in every place to be your consolation and comfort.\nA meek and quiet spirit you much need, and without it you cannot\nhave happiness. May God help you, my sister, to seek meekness and\nrighteousness. It is the Spirit of God that you need. If you are willing\nto be anything or nothing, God will help and strengthen and bless\nyou. But if you neglect the little duties you will never be entrusted\nwith greater.\nFaithfulness in Home Duties 79\n* * * * *\nChapter 8\u2014Pride and Vain Thoughts\nDear Children P and Q,\nYou are deceived in regard to yourselves. You are not Christians.\nTo be true Christians is to be Christlike. You are far from the mark\nin this respect; but I hope that you will not be deceived until it is too\nlate for you to form characters for heaven.\nYour example has not been good. You have not come to the point\nto obey the words of Christ: \u201cIf any man will come after Me, let\nhim deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\u201d Here are\nlessons that you have not learned. The denial of self has not been\na part of your education. You have neglected to study the words of\nlife. \u201cSearch the Scriptures,\u201d said the heavenly Teacher. He knew\nthat this was necessary for all in order for them to become Christ\u2019s\ntrue followers. You love to read storybooks, but do not find the word\nof God interesting. You should restrict your reading to the word\nof God and to books that are of a spiritual and useful character. In[82]\nso doing you will close a door against temptation, and you will be\nblessed.\nHad you improved the light that has been given in Battle Creek,\nyou would now be far in advance of what you are in the divine life.\nBoth of you are vain and proud. You have not felt that you must\ngive an account of your stewardship. You are accountable to God\nfor all your privileges and for all the means which pass through your\nhands. You have sought your own pleasure and selfish gratification\nat the expense of conscience and the approval of God. You do not\nact like servants of Christ, who are responsible to the Saviour who\nhas bought you with His own precious blood. \u201cKnow ye not, that\nto whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are\nto whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto\nrighteousness? But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of\nsin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which\nwas delivered you. Being then made free from sin, ye became the\nservants of righteousness.\u201d\n80\nPride and Vain Thoughts 81\nYou are professedly the servants of Christ. Do you then yield to\nHim ready and willing obedience? Do you earnestly inquire how\nyou shall best please Him who has called you to be soldiers of the\ncross of Christ? Do you both lift the cross and glory in it? Answer\nthese questions to God. All your acts, however secret you may think\nthey have been, are open to your heavenly Father. Nothing is hidden,\nnothing covered. All your acts and the motives which prompt them\nare open to His sight. He has full knowledge of all your words and\nthoughts. It is your duty to control your thoughts. You will have\nto war against a vain imagination. You may think that there can be\nno sin in permitting your thoughts to run as they naturally would\nwithout restraint. But this is not so. You are responsible to God for\nthe indulgence of vain thoughts; for from vain imaginations arises\nthe committal of sins, the actual doing of those things upon which\nthe mind has dwelt. Govern your thoughts, and it will then be much\neasier to govern your actions. Your thoughts need to be sanctified. [83]\nPaul writes to the Corinthians: \u201cCasting down imaginations, and\nevery high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God,\nand bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.\u201d\nWhen you come into this position, the work of consecration will be\nbetter understood by you both. Your thoughts will be pure, chaste,\nand elevated; your actions pure and sinless. Your bodies will be\npreserved in sanctification and honor, that you may present them \u201ca\nliving sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable\nservice.\u201d You are required to deny self in little as well as in greater\nthings. You should make an entire surrender to God; you are not\napproved of Him in your present state.\nYou have had an unsanctified influence over the youth in -----.\nYour love of show leads to an expenditure of means which is wrong.\nYou do not realize the claims that the Lord has upon you. You have\nnot become acquainted with the sweet results of self-denial. Its fruits\nare sacred. To serve yourselves and to please yourselves has been\nthe order of your lives. To spend your means to gratify pride has\nbeen your practice. Oh, how much better it would have been for you\nto have restrained your desires and made some sacrifice for the truth\nof God, and by thus denying the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh,\nand the pride of life have had something to put into the treasury of\nGod! Instead of purchasing frivolous things, put your little into the\n82 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nbank of heaven, that when the Master comes you may receive both\nprincipal and interest.\nHave you both studied how much you could do to honor your\nRedeemer upon the earth? Oh, no! You have been pleased to honor\nyourselves and to receive honor of others, but to study to show\nyourselves approved of God has not been the burden of your lives.\nReligion, pure and undefiled, with its strong principles, would prove\nto you an anchor. In order to answer life\u2019s great ends you must avoid\nthe example of those who are seeking for their own pleasure and\nenjoyment, and who have not the fear of God before them. God\nhas made provisions for you that are ample. He has provided that if[84]\nyou comply with the conditions laid down in His word, and separate\nfrom the world, you may receive strength from Him to repress every\ndebasing influence and to develop that which is noble, good, and\nelevating. Christ will be in you \u201ca well of water springing up into\neverlasting life.\u201d The will, the intellect, and every emotion, when\ncontrolled by religion, have a transforming power.\n\u201cWhether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all\nto the glory of God.\u201d Here is a principle which lies at the foundation\nof every act, thought, and motive; the consecration of the entire\nbeing, both physical and mental, to the control of the Spirit of God.\nThe unsanctified will and passions must be crucified. This may be\nregarded as a close and severe work. Yet it must be done, or you\nwill hear the terrible sentence from the mouth of Jesus: \u201cDepart.\u201d\nYou can do all things through Christ, who strengtheneth you. You\nare of that age when the will, the appetite, and the passions clamor\nfor indulgence. God has implanted these in your nature for high and\nholy purposes. It is not necessary that they should become a curse to\nyou by being debased. They will become this only when you refuse\nto submit to the control of reason and conscience. Restrain, deny,\nare words and works with which you are not familiar by experience.\nTemptations have swayed you. Unsanctified minds fail to receive\nthat strength and comfort that God has provided for them. They are\nrestless and possess a strong desire for something new, something\nto gratify, to please and excite the mind; and this is called pleasure.\nSatan has alluring charms to engage the interest and excite the\nimagination of the youth in particular, that he may fasten them in his\nsnare. You are building upon the sand. You need to cry earnestly:\nPride and Vain Thoughts 83\n\u201cO Lord, my inmost soul convert.\u201d You can have an influence for\ngood over other young people, or you can have an influence for evil.\nMay the God of peace sanctify you wholly, soul, body and spirit.\nChapter 9\u2014The Work at Battle Creek[85]\nIn a vision given me at Bordoville, Vermont, December 10, 1871,\nI was shown that the position of my husband has been a very difficult\none. A pressure of care and labor has been upon him. His brethren\nin the ministry have not had these burdens to bear, and they have\nnot appreciated his labors. The constant pressure upon him has\ntaxed him mentally and physically. I was shown that his relation to\nthe people of God was similar, in some respects, to that of Moses\nto Israel. There were murmurers against Moses, when in adverse\ncircumstances, and there have been murmurers against him.\nThere has been no one in the ranks of Sabbathkeepers who would\ndo as my husband has done. He has devoted his interest almost\nentirely to the building up of the cause of God, regardless of his own\npersonal interests and at the sacrifice of social enjoyment with his\nfamily. In his devotion to the cause he has frequently endangered\nhis health and life. He has been so much pressed with the burden of\nthis work that he has not had suitable time for study, meditation, and\nprayer. God has not required him to be in this position, even for the\ninterest and progress of the publishing work at Battle Creek. There\nare other branches of the work, other interests of the cause, that have\nbeen neglected through his devotion to this one. God has given us\nboth a testimony which will reach hearts. He has opened before me\nmany channels of light, not only for my benefit, but for the benefit of\nHis people at large. He has also given my husband great light upon\nBible subjects, not for himself alone, but for others. I saw that these\nthings should be written and talked out, and that new light would\ncontinue to shine upon the word.\nI saw that we could accomplish tenfold more to build up the cause\nby laboring among the people of God, bearing a varied testimony to\nmeet the wants of the cause in different places and under different\ncircumstances, than we could to remain at Battle Creek. Our gifts\nare needed in the same field in writing and in speaking. While my[86]\nhusband is overburdened, as he has been, with an accumulation of\n84\nWork at Battle Creek 85\ncares and financial matters, his mind cannot be as fruitful in the\nword as it otherwise would be. And he is liable to be assailed by the\nenemy; for he is in a position where there is a constant pressure, and\nmen and women will be tempted, as were the Israelites, to complain\nand murmur against him who stands in the most responsible position\nin the cause and work of God.\nWhile standing under these burdens that no one else would ven-\nture to take, my husband has sometimes, under the pressure of care,\nspoken without due consideration and with apparent severity. He\nhas sometimes censured those in the office because they did not take\ncare. And when needless mistakes have occurred, he has felt that\nindignation for the cause of God was justifiable in him. This course\nhas not always been attended with the best results. It has sometimes\nresulted in a neglect on the part of those reproved to do the very\nthings they should have done; for they feared they would not do\nthem right; and would then be blamed for it. Just as far as this has\nbeen the case, the burden has fallen heavier upon my husband.\nThe better way would have been for him to be away from the\noffice more than he has been, and leave the work with others to do.\nAnd if, after patient and fair trial, they proved themselves unfaithful,\nor not capacitated for the work, they should have been discharged,\nand left to engage in business where their blunders and mistakes\nwould affect their own personal interests and not the cause of God.\nThere were those who stood at the head of the business of the\nPublishing Association who were, to say the very least, unfaith-\nful. And had those in particular who were associated with them as\ntrustees been aware and their eyes not blinded and their sensibilities\nnot paralyzed, these men would have been separated from the work\nlong before they were.\nWhen my husband recovered from his long and severe sickness,\nhe took hold of the work confused and embarrassed as it was left by\nunfaithful men. He labored with all the resolution and strength of [87]\nmind and body that he possessed to bring the work up and to redeem\nit from the disgraceful perplexity into which it had been brought by\nthose who had their own interests prominent and who did not feel\nthat it was a sacred work in which they were engaged. God\u2019s hand\nhas been reached out in judgment over these unfaithful ones. Their\n86 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ncourse and the result should prove a warning to others not to do as\nthey have done.\nThe experience of my husband during the period of his sickness\nwas unfortunate for him. He had worked in this cause with interest\nand devotion as no other man had done. He had ventured and taken\nadvance positions as Providence had led, regardless of censure or\npraise. He had stood alone and battled through physical and mental\nsufferings, not regarding his own interests, while those whom God\ndesigned should stand by his side left him when he most needed their\nhelp. He had not only been left to battle and struggle without their\nhelp and sympathy, but frequently he had to meet their opposition\nand murmurings\u2014murmurings against one who was doing tenfold\nmore than any of them to build up the cause of God. All these things\nhave had their influence; they have molded the mind that was once\nfree from suspicion, trustful, and confiding, and caused him to lose\nconfidence in his brethren. Those who have acted a part in bringing\nabout this work will, in a great degree, be responsible for the result.\nGod would have led them if they had earnestly and devotedly served\nHim.\nI was shown that my husband had given his brethren unmistak-\nable evidences of his interest in, and devotion to, the work of God.\nAfter he had spent years of his life in privation and unceasing toil\nto establish the publishing interests upon a sure basis he gave away\nto the people of God that which was his own and which he could\njust as well have kept and received the profits from had he chosen\nso to do. By this act he showed the people that he was not seeking\nto advantage himself, but to promote the cause of God.\nWhen sickness came upon my husband, many acted in the same[88]\nunfeeling manner toward him that the Pharisees did toward the un-\nfortunate and oppressed. The Pharisees would tell the suffering\nones that their afflictions were on account of their sins, and that the\njudgments of God had come upon them. By so doing they would\nincrease their weight of suffering. When my husband fell under his\nweight of care, there were those who were merciless.\nWhen he began to recover, so that in his feebleness and poverty\nhe commenced to labor some, he asked those who then stood at\nthe head of matters at the office for 40 per cent discount on a one-\nhundred dollar order for books. He was willing to pay sixty dollars\nWork at Battle Creek 87\nfor the books which he knew cost the Association only fifty dollars.\nHe asked this special discount in view of his past labors and sacrifices\nin favor of the publishing department, but was denied this small\nfavor. He was coolly told that they could give him but 25 per cent\ndiscount. My husband thought this very hard, yet he tried to bear it\nin a Christian manner. God in heaven marked the unjust decision,\nand from that time took the case in His own hands, and has returned\nthe blessings removed, as He did to faithful Job. From the time of\nthat heartless decision, He has been working for His servant, and has\nraised him above his former health of body, clearness and strength\nof mind, and freedom of spirit. And since that time my husband has\nhad the pleasure of passing out with his own hands thousands of\ndollars\u2019 worth of our publications without price. God will not utterly\nforget nor forever forsake those who have been faithful, even if they\nsometimes commit errors.\nMy husband has had a zeal for God and for the truth, and at\ntimes this zeal has led him to overlabor to the injury of physical and\nmental strength. But the Lord has not regarded this as so great a sin\nas the neglect and unfaithfulness of His servants in reproving wrongs.\nThose who praised the unfaithful and flattered the unconsecrated\nwere sharers in their sin of neglect and unfaithfulness.\nGod has selected my husband and given him special qualifica- [89]\ntions, natural ability, and an experience to lead out His people in\nthe advance work. But there have been murmurers among Sabbath-\nkeeping Adventists as there were among ancient Israel, and these\njealous, suspicious ones, by their suggestions and insinuations, have\ngiven occasion to the enemies of our faith to distrust my husband\u2019s\nhonesty. These jealous ones of the same faith have placed matters\nbefore unbelievers in a false light, and the impressions made stand\nin the way of many embracing the truth. They regard my husband\nas a schemer, a selfish, avaricious man, and they are afraid of him\nand of the truth held by us as a people.\nWhen the appetite of ancient Israel was restricted, or when any\nclose requirement was brought to bear upon them, they reflected\nupon Moses, that he was arbitrary, that he wished to rule them, and\nto be altogether a prince over them, when he was only an instrument\nin God\u2019s hand to bring His people into a position of submission and\nobedience to God\u2019s voice.\n88 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nModern Israel have murmured and become jealous of my hus-\nband because he has pleaded for the cause of God. He has encour-\naged liberality, he has rebuked those who loved this world, and has\ncensured selfishness. He has pleaded for donations to the cause of\nGod and, to encourage liberality in his brethren, has led off by liberal\ndonations himself; but by many murmuring, jealous ones even this\nhas been interpreted that he wished to be personally benefited by\nthe means of his brethren and that he had enriched himself at the\nexpense of the cause of God; when the facts in the case are that\nGod has entrusted means in his hands to raise him above want so\nthat he need not be dependent upon the mercies of a changeable,\nmurmuring, jealous people. Because we have not selfishly studied\nour own interest, but have cared for the widow and the fatherless,\nGod has in His providence worked in our behalf and blessed us with\nprosperity and an abundance.\nMoses sacrificed a prospective kingdom, a life of worldly honor\nand luxury in kingly courts, choosing rather to suffer affliction with[90]\nthe people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season,\nfor he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than all the\ntreasures of Egypt. Had we chosen a life of ease and freedom from\nlabor and care we might have done so. But this was not our choice.\nWe chose active labor in the cause of God, an itinerant life, with all\nits hardships, privations, and exposure, to a life of indolence. We\nhave not lived for ourselves, to please ourselves, but we have tried\nto live for God, to please and glorify Him. We have not made it an\nobject to labor for property; but God has fulfilled His promise in\ngiving us a hundredfold in this life. He may prove us by removing it\nfrom us. If so, we pray for submission to humbly bear the test.\nWhile He has committed to our trust talents of money and influ-\nence, we will try to invest them in His cause, that should fires con-\nsume and adversity diminish, we can have the pleasure of knowing\nthat some of our treasure is where fires cannot consume or adversity\nsweep away. The cause of God is a sure bank that can never fail,\nand the investment of our time, our interest, and our means in it is a\ntreasure in the heavens that faileth not.\nI was shown that my husband has had threefold the care he should\nhave had. He has felt tried that Brethren R and S did not help him\nbear his responsibilities, and has felt grieved because they did not\nWork at Battle Creek 89\nhelp him in the business matters in connection with the Institute and\nthe Publishing Association. There has been a continual advancement\nin the work of publishing ever since the unfaithful were separated\nfrom it. And as the work increased, there should have been men to\nshare the responsibilities; but some who could have done this had\nno desire, because it would not increase their possessions as much\nas some more lucrative business.\nThere is not that talent in our office that there should be. The\nwork demands the choicest and most select persons to engage in it.\nWith the present state of things in the office my husband will still feel\nthe pressure that he has felt, but which he should no longer bear. It is\nonly by a miracle of God\u2019s mercy that he has stood under the burden [91]\nso long. But there are now many things to be considered. By his\npersevering care and devotion to the work he has shown what may\nbe done in the publishing department. Men with unselfish interests\ncombined with sanctified judgment may make the work at the office\na success. My husband has so long borne the burden alone that it\nhas told fearfully upon his strength, and there is a positive necessity\nfor a change. He must be relieved from care to a great degree, and\nyet he can work in the cause of God in speaking and writing.\nWhen we returned from Kansas in the autumn of 1870, both\nof us should have had a period of rest. Weeks of freedom from\ncare were necessary to bring up our exhausted energies. But when\nwe found the important post at Battle Creek nearly deserted, we\nfelt compelled to take hold of the work with double energies, and\nlabored beyond our strength. I was shown that my husband should\nstand there no longer unless there are men who will feel the wants\nof the cause and bear the burdens of the work, while he shall simply\nact as a counselor. He must lay the burden down, for God has an\nimportant work for him to do in writing and speaking the truth.\nOur influence in laboring in the wide field will tell more for the\nupbuilding of the cause of God. There is a great amount of prejudice\nin many minds. False statements have placed us in a wrong position\nbefore the people, and this stands in the way of many embracing the\ntruth. If they are made to believe that those who occupy responsible\npositions in the work at Battle Creek are designing and fanatical they\nconclude that the entire work is wrong and that our views of Bible\ntruth must be incorrect, and they fear to investigate and receive the\n90 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ntruth. But we are not to go forth to call the people to look to us; we\nare not generally to speak of ourselves and vindicate our characters;\nbut we are to speak the truth, exalt the truth, speak of Jesus, exalt\nJesus, and this, attended by the power of God, will remove prejudice\nand disarm opposition.\nBrethren R and S love to write; so does my husband. And God[92]\nhas let His light shine upon His word, and has led him into a field\nof rich thought that would be a blessing to the people of God at\nlarge. While he has borne a triple burden, some of his ministering\nbrethren have let the responsibility drop heavily upon him, consoling\nthemselves with the thought that God had placed Brother White at\nthe head of the work and qualified him for it, and that the Lord had\nnot fitted them for the position; therefore they have not taken the\nresponsibility and borne the burdens which they might have borne.\nThere should be men who would feel the same interest that my\nhusband has felt. There never has been a more important period in\nthe history of Seventh-day Adventists than the present. Instead of\nthe publishing work diminishing, the demand for our publications\nis greatly increasing. There will be more to do instead of less. My\nhusband has been murmured against so much, he has contended with\njealousy and falsehood so long, and has seen so little faithfulness in\nmen, that he has become suspicious of almost everyone, even of his\nown brethren in the ministry. The ministering brethren have felt this,\nand for fear that they should not move wisely, in many instances\nhave not moved at all. But the time has come when these men must\nlabor unitedly to lift the burdens. The ministering brethren lack faith\nand confidence in God. They believe the truth, and in the fear of\nGod they should unite their efforts, and bear the burdens of this work\nwhich God has laid upon them.\nIf, after one has done the best he can in his judgment, another\nthinks he can see where he could have improved the matter, he should\nkindly and patiently give the brother the benefit of his judgment,\nbut should not censure him nor question his integrity of purpose\nany sooner than he himself would wish to be suspected or unjustly\ncensured. If the brother who feels the cause of God at heart sees\nthat, in his earnest efforts to do, he has made a failure, he will feel\ndeeply over the matter; for he will be inclined to distrust himself\nand to lose confidence in his own judgment. Nothing will so weaken\nWork at Battle Creek 91\nhis courage and godlike manhood as to realize his mistakes in the\nwork that God has appointed him to do, a work which he loves better [93]\nthan his life. How unjust, then, for his brethren who discover his\nerrors to keep pressing the thorn deeper and deeper into his heart,\nto make him feel more intensely, when with every thrust they are\nweakening his faith and courage, and his confidence in himself to\nwork successfully in the upbuilding of the cause of God.\nFrequently the truth and facts are to be plainly spoken to the\nerring, to make them see and feel their error that they may reform.\nBut this should ever be done with pitying tenderness, not with harsh-\nness or severity, but considering one\u2019s own weakness, lest he also\nbe tempted. When the one at fault sees and acknowledges his error,\nthen, instead of grieving him, and seeking to make him feel more\ndeeply, comfort should be given. In the sermon of Christ upon the\nmount He said: \u201cJudge not, that ye be not judged. For with what\njudgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye\nmete, it shall be measured to you again.\u201d Our Saviour reproved for\nrash judgment. \u201cWhy beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother\u2019s\neye; ... and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?\u201d It is frequently the\ncase that while one is quick to discern the errors of his brethren, he\nmay be in greater faults himself, but be blind to them.\nAll who are followers of Christ should deal with one another\nexactly as we wish the Lord to deal with us in our errors and weak-\nnesses, for we are all erring and need His pity and forgiveness. Jesus\nconsented to take human nature, that He might know how to pity,\nand how to plead with His Father in behalf of sinful, erring mortals.\nHe volunteered to become man\u2019s Advocate, and He humiliated Him-\nself to become acquainted with the temptations wherewith man was\nbeset, that He might succor those who should be tempted, and be a\ntender and faithful high priest.\nFrequently there is necessity for plainly rebuking sin and reprov-\ning wrong. But ministers who are working for the salvation of their\nfellow men should not be pitiless toward the errors of one another, [94]\nnor make prominent the defects in their organizations. They should\nnot expose or reprove their weaknesses. They should inquire if such\na course, pursued by another toward themselves, would bring about\nthe desired effect; would it increase their love for, and confidence\nin, the one who thus made prominent their mistakes? Especially\n92 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nshould the mistakes of ministers who are engaged in the work of\nGod be kept within as small a circle as possible, for there are many\nweak ones who will take advantage if they are aware that those who\nminister in word and doctrine have weaknesses like other men. And\nit is a most cruel thing for the faults of a minister to be exposed to\nunbelievers, if that minister is counted worthy to labor in the future\nfor the salvation of souls. No good can come of this exposure, but\nonly harm. The Lord frowns upon this course, for it is undermining\nthe confidence of the people in those whom He accepts to carry\nforward His work. The character of every fellow laborer should be\njealously guarded by brother ministers. Saith God: \u201cTouch not Mine\nanointed, and do My prophets no harm.\u201d Love and confidence should\nbe cherished. A lack of this love and confidence in one minister for\nanother does not increase the happiness of the one thus deficient, but\nas he makes his brother unhappy he is unhappy himself. There is\ngreater power in love than was ever found in censure. Love will melt\nits way through barriers, while censure will close up every avenue\nof the soul.\nMy husband must have a change. Losses may occur at the office\nof publication for want of his long experience, but the loss of money\ncannot bear any comparison to the health and life of God\u2019s servant.\nThe income of means may not be as large for want of economical\nmanagers; but if my husband should fail again, it would dishearten\nhis brethren and weaken their hands. Means cannot come in as an\nequivalent.\nThere is much to be done. Missionaries should be in the field who\nare willing, if need be, to go to foreign countries to present the truth\nbefore those who sit in darkness. But there is little disposition among\nyoung men to consecrate themselves to God and to devote their[95]\ntalents to His service. They are too willing to shun responsibilities\nand burdens. They are not obtaining the experience in burden bearing\nor the knowledge of the Scriptures that they should have to fit them\nfor the work that God would accept at their hands. It is the duty\nof all to see how much they can do for the Master who has died\nfor them. But many are seeking to do just as little as possible and\nare cherishing the faint hope of getting into heaven at last. It is\ntheir privilege to have stars in their crown because of souls saved\nthrough their instrumentality. But alas! indolence and spiritual sloth\nWork at Battle Creek 93\nprevail everywhere. Selfishness and pride occupy a large place in\ntheir hearts, and there is but little room for heavenly things.\nIn the prayer that Christ taught His disciples was the request:\nForgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against\nus. We cannot repeat this prayer from the heart and dare to be\nunforgiving, for we ask the Lord to forgive our trespasses against\nHim in the same manner that we forgive those who trespass against\nus. But few realize the true import of this prayer. If those who are\nunforgiving did comprehend the depth of its meaning they would\nnot dare to repeat it and ask God to deal with them as they deal\nwith their fellow mortals. And yet this spirit of hardness and lack of\nforgiveness exists even among brethren to a fearful extent. Brother\nis exacting with brother.\nPeculiar Trials\nThe position that my husband has so long occupied in the cause\nand work of God has been one of peculiar trials. His adaptation to\nbusiness and his clear foresight have led his ministering brethren\nto drop responsibilities upon him which they should have borne\nthemselves. This has made his burdens very great. And while his\nbrethren have not taken their share of the burdens, they have lost a\nvaluable experience which it was their privilege to obtain had they\nexercised their minds in the direction of caretaking, of seeing and [96]\nfeeling what must be done for the upbuilding of the cause.\nGreat trials have been brought upon my husband by his minis-\ntering brethren\u2019s not standing by him when he most needed their\nhelp. The disappointment he has repeatedly felt when those whom\nhe depended upon failed him in times of greatest need has nearly\ndestroyed his power to hope and believe in the constancy of his\nministering brethren. His spirits have been so wounded that he has\nfelt justified in being grieved, and he has allowed his mind to dwell\nupon discouragements. This channel of darkness God would have\nhim close, for he is in danger of making shipwreck here. When his\nmind becomes depressed, it is natural for him to bring up the past\nand dwell upon his past sufferings; and unreconciliation takes hold\nupon his spirits, that God has suffered him to be so beset with trials\nunnecessarily brought upon him.\n94 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nThe Spirit of God has been grieved because he has not fully\ncommitted his ways to God and trusted himself entirely in His hands,\nnot allowing his mind to run in the channel of doubt and unbelief\nin regard to the integrity of his brethren. In talking doubts and\ndiscouragements he has not remedied the evil, but has weakened\nhis own powers and given Satan advantage to annoy and distress\nhim. He has erred in talking out his discouragements and dwelling\nupon the unpleasant features of his experience. In thus talking he\nscatters darkness but not light. He has at times laid a weight of\ndiscouragement upon his brethren, which did not bring to him the\nleast help, but only weakened their hands. He should make it a rule\nnot to talk unbelief or discouragement, or dwell upon his grievances.\nHis brethren generally have loved and pitied him, and have excused\nthis in him, knowing the pressure of care upon him, and his devotion\nto the cause of God.\nMy husband has labored untiringly to bring the publishing in-\nterest up to its present state of prosperity. I saw that he had had\nmore sympathy and love from his brethren than he has thought he\nhad. They eagerly search the paper to find something from his pen.\nIf there is a tone of cheerfulness in his writings, if he speaks en-[97]\ncouragingly, their hearts are lightened, and some even weep with\ntender feelings of joy. But if gloom and sadness are expressed, the\ncountenances of his brethren and sisters, as they read, grow sad, and\nthe spirit which characterizes his writings is reflected upon them.\nThe Lord is seeking to teach my husband to have a spirit of\nforgiveness, and forgetfulness of the dark passages in his experience.\nThe remembrance of the unpleasant past only saddens the present,\nand he lives over again the unpleasant portion of his life\u2019s history.\nIn so doing he is clinging to the darkness and is pressing the thorn\ndeeper into his spirit. This is my husband\u2019s infirmity, and it is\ndispleasing to God. This brings darkness and not light. He may feel\napparent relief for the time in expressing his feelings; but it only\nmakes more acute the sense of how great his sufferings and trials\nhave been, until the whole becomes magnified in his imagination,\nand the errors of his brethren, who have aided in bringing these\ntrials upon him, look so grievous that their wrongs seem to him past\nendurance.\nWork at Battle Creek 95\nMy husband has cherished this darkness so long by living over\nthe unhappy past that he has but little power to control his mind\nwhen dwelling upon these things. Circumstances and events which\nonce he would not have minded, magnify before him into grievous\nwrongs on the part of his brethren. He has become so sensitive to\nthe wrongs under which he has suffered that it is necessary that he\nshould be as little as possible in the vicinity of Battle Creek, where\nmany of the unpleasant circumstances occurred. God will heal his\nwounded spirit, if he will let Him. But in doing this, he will have to\nbury the past. He should not talk of it, or write of it.\nIt is positively displeasing to God for my husband to recount\nhis difficulties and his peculiar grievances of the past. If he had\nlooked upon these things in the light that they were not done to\nhim, but to the Lord, whose instrument he is, then he would have\nreceived a great reward. But he has taken the murmurings of his\nbrethren as though done to himself and has felt called upon to make\nall understand the wrong and wickedness of thus complaining of [98]\nhim when he did not deserve their censure and abuse.\nHad my husband felt that he could leave this matter all with the\nLord, and that their murmurings and their neglect were against the\nMaster instead of the servant in the Master\u2019s service, he would not\nhave felt so aggrieved, and it would not have hurt him. He should\nhave left it with the Lord, whose servant he is, to fight his battles for\nhim and vindicate his cause. Then he would have finally received a\nprecious reward for all his sufferings for Christ\u2019s sake.\nI saw that my husband should not dwell upon the painful facts\nin our experience. Neither should he write his grievances, but keep\nas far from them as he can. The Lord will heal the wounds of the\npast if he will turn his attention away from them. \u201cFor our light\naffliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more\nexceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the\nthings which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the\nthings which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen\nare eternal.\u201d When confessions are made by his brethren who have\nbeen wrong, he should accept the confessions and generously, nobly,\nseek to encourage those who have been deceived by the enemy. He\nshould cultivate a forgiving spirit and should not dwell upon the\nmistakes and errors of others, for in so doing he not only weakens\n96 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nhis own soul, but tortures the minds of his brethren who have erred,\nwhen they may have done all that they can do by confession to\ncorrect their past errors. If God sees it necessary that any portion\nof their past course should be presented before them, that they may\nunderstand how to shun errors in future, He will do this work; but\nmy husband should not trust himself to do it, for it awakens past\nscenes of suffering that the Lord would have him forget.\nChapter 10\u2014Parables of the Lost [99]\nThe Lost Sheep\nI was referred to the parable of the lost sheep. The ninety and\nnine sheep are left in the wilderness, and search is instituted for the\none that has strayed. When the lost sheep is found, the shepherd\nelevates it to his shoulder and returns with rejoicing. He does not\nreturn murmuring and censuring the poor lost sheep for having made\nhim so much trouble, but his return with the burden of the sheep is\nwith rejoicing.\nAnd a still greater demonstration of joy is demanded. Friends\nand neighbors are called to rejoice with the finder, \u201cfor I have found\nmy sheep which was lost.\u201d The finding was the theme of rejoicing;\nthe straying was not dwelt upon; for the joy of finding overbalanced\nthe sorrow of the loss and the care, the perplexity and the peril,\nincurred in searching for the lost sheep and restoring it to safety. \u201cI\nsay unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner\nthat repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which\nneed no repentance.\u201d\nThe Lost Silver\nThe lost piece of silver is designed to represent the erring, stray-\ning sinner. The carefulness of the woman to find the lost silver is\nto teach the followers of Christ a lesson in regard to their duty to\nthe erring ones who are straying from the path of right. The woman\nlighted the candle to increase her light, and then swept the house,\nand sought diligently till she found it.\nHere is clearly defined the duty of Christians toward those who\nneed help because of their straying from God. The erring ones are\nnot to be left in darkness and error, but every available means is\nto be used to bring them again to the light. The candle is lighted;\nand, with earnest prayer for heavenly light to meet the cases of those\nenshrouded in darkness and unbelief, the word of God is searched\n97\n98 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nfor clear points of truth, that Christians may be so fortified with\narguments from the word of God, with its reproofs, threatenings, and\nencouragements, that the erring ones may be reached. Indifference[100]\nor neglect will meet the frown of God.\nWhen the woman found the silver, she called her friends and\nher neighbors together, saying: \u201cRejoice with me; for I have found\nthe piece which I had lost. Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in\nthe presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.\u201d If\nthe angels of God rejoice over the erring who see and confess their\nwrongs and return to the fellowship of their brethren, how much\nmore should the followers of Christ, who are themselves erring, and\nwho every day need the forgiveness of God and of their brethren,\nfeel joy over the return of a brother or a sister who has been deceived\nby the sophistry of Satan and has taken a wrong course and suffered\nbecause of it.\nInstead of holding the erring off, their brethren should meet them\nwhere they are. Instead of finding fault with them because they are\nin the dark, they should light their own lamp by obtaining more\ndivine grace and a clearer knowledge of the Scriptures, that they\nmay dispel the darkness of those in error by the light that they bring\nto them. And when they succeed, and the erring feel their error\nand submit to follow the light, they should be received gladly, and\nnot with a spirit of murmuring or an effort to impress upon them\ntheir exceeding sinfulness, which had called forth extra exertion,\nanxiety, and wearisome labor. If the pure angels of God hail the\nevent with joy, how much more should their brethren rejoice, who\nhave themselves needed sympathy, love, and help when they have\nerred and in their darkness have not known how to help themselves.\nThe Prodigal Son\nMy attention was called to the parable of the prodigal son. He\nmade a request that his father should give him his portion of the\nestate. He desired to separate his interest from that of his father, and\nto manage his share as best suited his own inclination. His father[101]\ncomplied with the request, and the son selfishly withdrew from his\nfather, that he might not be troubled with his counsel or reproofs.\nParables of the Lost 99\nThe son thought he should be happy when he could use his\nportion according to his own pleasure, without being annoyed by\nadvice or restraint. He did not wish to be troubled with mutual\nobligation. If he shared his father\u2019s estate, his father had claims upon\nhim as a son. But he did not feel under any obligation to his generous\nfather, and he braced his selfish, rebellious spirit with the thought\nthat a portion of his father\u2019s property belonged to him. He requested\nhis share, when rightfully he could claim nothing and should have\nhad nothing.\nAfter his selfish heart had received the treasure, of which he\nwas so undeserving, he went his way at a distance from his father,\nthat he might even forget that he had a father. He despised restraint\nand was fully determined to have pleasure in any way and manner\nthat he chose. After he had, by his sinful indulgences, spent all\nthat his father had given him, the land was visited by a famine, and\nhe felt pinching want. He then began to regret his sinful course of\nextravagant pleasure, for he was destitute and needed the means that\nhe had squandered. He was obliged to come down from his life of\nsinful indulgence to the low business of feeding swine.\nAfter he had come as low as he could he thought of the kindness\nand love of his father. He then felt the need of a father. He had\nbrought upon himself his position of friendlessness and want. His\nown disobedience and sin had resulted in his separating himself\nfrom his father. He thought of the privileges and bounties that the\nhired servants of his father\u2019s house freely enjoyed, while he who had\nalienated himself from his father\u2019s house was perishing with hunger.\nHumiliated through adversity, he decided to return to his father by\nhumble confession. He was a beggar, destitute of comfortable or\neven decent clothing. He was wretched in consequence of privation\nand was emaciated with hunger.\nWhile the son was at a distance from his home, his father saw the [102]\nwanderer, and his first thought was of that rebellious son who had left\nhim years before to follow a course of unrestrained sin. The paternal\nfeeling was stirred. Notwithstanding all the marks of his degradation\nthe father discerned his own image. He did not wait for his son to\ncome all the distance to him, but hastened to meet him. He did not\nreproach his son, but with the tenderest pity and compassion, that,\nin consequence of his course of sin, he had brought upon himself so\n100 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nmuch suffering, the father hastened to give him proofs of his love\nand tokens of his forgiveness.\nAlthough his son was emaciated and his countenance plainly\nindicated the dissolute life he had passed, although he was clothed\nwith beggar\u2019s rags and his naked feet were soiled with the dust of\ntravel, the father\u2019s tenderest pity was excited as the son fell prostrate\nin humility before him. He did not stand back upon his dignity; he\nwas not exacting. He did not array before his son his past course of\nwrong and sin, to make him feel how low he had sunk. He lifted\nhim up and kissed him. He took the rebellious son to his breast and\nwrapped his own rich robe about the nearly naked form. He took him\nto his heart with such warmth, and evinced such pity, that if the son\nhad ever doubted the goodness and love of his father, he could do\nso no longer. If he had a sense of his sin when he decided to return\nto his father\u2019s house, he had a much deeper sense of his ungrateful\ncourse when he was thus received. His heart, before subdued, was\nnow broken because he had grieved that father\u2019s love.\nThe penitent, trembling son, who had greatly feared that he\nwould be disowned, was unprepared for such a reception. He knew\nhe did not deserve it, and he thus acknowledged his sin in leaving\nhis father: \u201cI have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no\nmore worthy to be called thy son.\u201d He begged only to be accounted\nas a hired servant. But the father requested his servants to pay him\nspecial tokens of respect and to clothe him as if he had ever been his\nown obedient son.\nThe father made the return of his son an occasion of special\nrejoicing. The elder son in the field knew not that his brother had[103]\nreturned, but he heard the general demonstrations of joy and inquired\nof the servants what it all meant. It was explained that his brother,\nwhom they had thought dead, had returned, and that his father had\nkilled the fatted calf for him because he had received him again as\nfrom the dead.\nThe brother was then angry and would not go in to see or receive\nhis brother. His indignation was stirred that his unfaithful brother,\nwho had left his father and thrown the heavy responsibility upon\nhim of fulfilling the duties which should have been shared by both,\nshould now be received with such honor. This brother had pursued\na course of wicked profligacy, wasting the means his father had\nParables of the Lost 101\ngiven him, until he was reduced to want, while his brother at home\nhad been faithfully performing the duties of a son; and now this\nprofligate comes to his father\u2019s house and is received with respect\nand honor beyond anything that he himself had ever received.\nThe father entreated his elder son to go and receive his brother\nwith gladness because he was lost and is found; he was dead in sin\nand iniquity, but is alive again; he has come to his moral senses\nand abhors his course of sin. But his elder son pleads: \u201cLo, these\nmany years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy\ncommandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might\nmake merry with my friends: but as soon as this thy son was come,\nwhich hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him\nthe fatted calf.\u201d\nHe assured his son that he was ever with him, and that all he had\nwas his, but that it was right that they should show this demonstration\nof joy, for \u201cthy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost,\nand is found.\u201d The fact that the lost is found, the dead is alive again,\noverbears all other considerations with the father.\nThis parable was given by Christ to represent the manner in\nwhich our heavenly Father receives the erring and repenting. The\nfather is the one sinned against; yet he, in the compassion of his soul,\nfull of pity and forgiveness, meets the prodigal and shows his great [104]\njoy that his son, whom he believed to be dead to all filial affection,\nhas become sensible of his great sin and neglect, and has come back\nto his father, appreciating his love and acknowledging his claims.\nHe knows that the son who has pursued a course of sin and now\nrepents needs his pity and his love. This son has suffered; he has felt\nhis need, and he comes to his father as the only one who can supply\nthis great need.\nThe return of the prodigal son was a source of the greatest joy.\nThe complaints of the elder brother were natural, but not right. Yet\nthis is frequently the course that brother pursues toward brother.\nThere is too much effort to make those in error feel where they have\nerred, and to keep reminding them of their mistakes. Those who have\nerred need pity, they need help, they need sympathy. They suffer\nin their feelings, and are frequently desponding and discouraged.\nAbove everything else, they need free forgiveness.\n102 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\n* * * * *\nChapter 11\u2014Labor Among the Churches\nIn the work done for the church at Battle Creek in the spring of\n1870, there was not all that dependence upon God that the important\noccasion demanded. Brethren R and S did not make God their trust,\nand move in His strength and with His grace, as fully as they should.\nWhen Brother S thinks a person is wrong, he is frequently too\nsevere. He fails to exercise that compassion and consideration that\nhe would have shown toward himself under like circumstances. He\nis also in great danger of misjudging and erring in dealing with\nminds. It is the nicest and most critical work ever given to mortals,\nto deal with minds. Those who engage in this work should have\nclear discernment and good powers of discrimination. True indepen-\ndence of mind is an element entirely different from rashness. That\nquality of independence which leads to a cautious, prayerful, delib-\nerate opinion should not be easily yielded, not until the evidence [105]\nis sufficiently strong to make it certain that we are wrong. This\nindependence will keep the mind calm and unchangeable amid the\nmultitudinous errors which prevail, and will lead those in respon-\nsible positions to look carefully at the evidence on every side, and\nnot be swayed by the influence of others, or by the surroundings, to\nform conclusions without intelligent, thorough knowledge of all the\ncircumstances.\nThe investigation of cases in Battle Creek was very much after\nthe order in which a lawyer criticizes a witness, and there was a\ndecided absence of the Spirit of God. There were a few united in\nthis work who were active and zealous. Some were self-righteous\nand self-sufficient, and their testimonies were relied upon, and their\ninfluence swayed the judgment of Brethren R and S. Because of\nsome trivial deficiency, Sisters T and U were not received as mem-\nbers of the church. Brethren R and S should have had judgment\nand discrimination to see that these objections were not of sufficient\nweight to keep these sisters out of the church. Both of them had\n103\n104 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nbeen long in the faith and had been true to the observance of the\nSabbath for eighteen or twenty years.\nSister V , who brought up these things, should have urged against\nherself more weighty reasons why she should not have become a\nmember of the church. Was she without sin? Were all her ways\nperfect before God? Was she perfect in patience, self-denial, gen-\ntleness, forbearance, and calmness of temper? If she were without\nthe weaknesses of common women, then she could cast the first\nstone. Those sisters who were left out of the church were worthy\nof a place in it; they were beloved of God. But they were dealt\nwith unwisely, without sufficient cause. There were others whose\ncases were handled with no more heavenly wisdom and without even\nsound judgment. Brother S\u2019s judgment and power of discrimination\nhave been perverted for very many years through the influence of\nhis wife, who has been a most effective medium of Satan. If he\nhad possessed the genuine quality of independence he would have\nhad proper self-respect and with becoming dignity would have built[106]\nup his own house. When he has started upon a course designed to\ncommand respect in his family he has generally carried the matter\ntoo far and has been severe and has talked harshly and overbearingly.\nBecoming conscious of this after a time, he would then go to the\nopposite extreme and come down from his independence.\nIn this state of mind he would receive reports from his wife,\ngive up his judgment, and be easily deceived by her intrigues. She\nwould sometimes feign to be a great sufferer and would relate what\nprivations she had endured and what neglect from her brethren, in\nthe absence of her husband. Her prevarications and cunning artifices\nto abuse the mind of her husband have been great. Brother S has not\nfully received the light which the Lord has given him in times past\nin regard to his wife or he would not have been deceived by her as\nhe has been. He has been brought into bondage many times by her\nspirit because his own heart and life have not been fully consecrated\nto God. His feelings kindled against his brethren, and he oppressed\nthem. Self has not been crucified. He should seek earnestly to bring\nall his thoughts and feelings into subjection to the obedience of\nChrist. Faith and self-denial would have been Brother S\u2019s strong\nhelpers. If he had girded on the whole armor of God and chosen no\nLabor Among the Churches 105\nother defense than that which the Spirit of God and the power of\ntruth gives him, he would have been strong in the strength of God.\nBut Brother S is weak in many things. If God required him to\nexpose and condemn a neighbor, to reprove and correct a brother,\nor to resist and destroy his enemies, it would be to him a compara-\ntively natural and easy work. But a warfare against self, subduing\nthe desires and affections of his own heart, and searching out and\ncontrolling the secret motives of the heart, is a more difficult warfare.\nHow unwilling is he to be faithful in such a contest as this! The\nwarfare against self is the greatest battle that was ever fought. The\nyielding of self, surrendering all to the will of God and being clothed\nwith humility, possessing that love that is pure, peaceable, and easy\nto be entreated, full of gentleness and good fruits, is not an easy [107]\nattainment. And yet it is his privilege and his duty to be a perfect\novercomer here. The soul must submit to God before it can be re-\nnewed in knowledge and true holiness. The holy life and character of\nChrist is a faithful example. His confidence in His heavenly Father\nwas unlimited. His obedience and submission were unreserved and\nperfect. He came not to be ministered unto, but to minister to others.\nHe came not to do His own will, but the will of Him that sent Him.\nIn all things He submitted Himself to Him that judgeth righteously.\nFrom the lips of the Saviour of the world were heard these words:\n\u201cI can of Mine own self do nothing.\u201d\nHe became poor, and made Himself of no reputation. He was\nhungry and frequently thirsty, and many times weary in His labors;\nbut He had not where to lay His head. When the cold, damp shades of\nnight gathered about Him, the earth was frequently His bed. Yet He\nblessed those who hated Him. What a life! what an experience! Can\nwe, the professed followers of Christ, cheerfully endure privation\nand suffering as did our Lord, without murmuring? Can we drink of\nthe cup and be baptized with the baptism? If so, we may share with\nHim His glory in His heavenly kingdom. If not, we shall have no\npart with Him.\nBrother S has an experience to gain, without which his work will\ndo positive injury. He is affected too much by what others tell him\nof the erring; he is apt to decide according to the impressions made\nupon his mind, and he deals with severity, when a milder course\nwould be far better. He does not bear in mind his own weakness,\n106 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nand how hard it is for him to have his course questioned, even when\nhe is wrong. When he decides that a brother or sister is wrong he is\ninclined to carry the matter through and press his censure, although\nin doing so he hurts his own soul and endangers the souls of others.\nBrother S should shun church trials and should have nothing\nto do in settling difficulties, if he can possibly avoid it. He has a\nvaluable gift, which is needed in the work of God. But he should[108]\nseparate himself from influences which draw upon his sympathies,\nconfuse his judgment, and lead him to move unwisely. This should\nnot and need not be. He exercises too little faith in God. He dwells\ntoo much upon his bodily infirmities and strengthens unbelief by\ndwelling upon poor feelings. God has strength and wisdom in store\nfor those who seek for it earnestly, in faith believing.\nI was shown that Brother S is a strong man upon some points,\nwhile upon others he is as weak as a child. His course in dealing\nwith the erring has had a scattering influence. He has confidence\nin his ability to labor in setting things in order where he thinks it\nis needed, but he does not view the matter aright. He weaves into\nhis labors his own spirit, and he does not discriminate, but often\ndeals without tenderness. There is such a thing as overdoing the\nmatter in performing strict duty to individuals. \u201cAnd of some have\ncompassion, making a difference: and others save with fear, pulling\nthem out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.\u201d\nDuty, stern duty, has a twin sister, which is kindness. If duty and\nkindness are blended, decided advantage will be gained; but if duty\nis separated from kindness, if tender love is not mingled with duty,\nthere will be a failure, and much harm will be the result. Men and\nwomen will not be driven, but many can be won by kindness and\nlove. Brother S has held aloft the gospel whip, and his own words\nhave frequently been the snap to that whip. This has not had an\ninfluence to spur others to greater zeal and to provoke them to good\nworks, but it has aroused their combativeness to repel his severity.\nIf Brother S had walked in the light, he would not have made so\nmany serious failures. \u201cIf any man walk in the day, he stumbleth\nnot, because he seeth the light of this world. But if a man walk\nin the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.\u201d The\npath of obedience is the path of safety. \u201cHe that walketh uprightly\nwalketh surely.\u201d Walk in the light, and \u201cthen shalt thou walk in thy\nLabor Among the Churches 107\nway safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.\u201d Those who do not walk [109]\nin the light will have a sickly, stunted religion. Brother S should feel\nthe importance of walking in the light, however crucifying to self. It\nis earnest effort, prompted by love for souls, which strengthens the\nheart and develops the graces.\nMy brother, you are naturally independent and self-sufficient.\nYou estimate your ability to do, more highly than it will bear. You\npray for the Lord to humble you and fit you for His work, and when\nHe answers your prayer and puts you under the course of discipline\nnecessary for the accomplishment of the object, you frequently give\nway to doubts and despondency, and think you have reason for\ndiscouragement. When Brother W has cautioned and held you back\nfrom engaging in church difficulties, you have frequently felt that\nhe was restraining you.\nI was shown your labors in Iowa. There was a decided failure\nto gather with Christ. You distracted, confused, and scattered the\npoor sheep. You had a zeal, but it was not according to knowledge.\nYour labors were not in love, but in sternness and severity. You were\nexacting and overbearing. You did not strengthen the sick and bind\nup the lame. Your injudicious harshness pushed some out of the fold\nwho can never be reached and brought back. Words fitly spoken are\nlike apples of gold in pictures of silver. Words unfitly spoken are the\nreverse. Your influence will be like desolating hail.\nYou have felt restless under restraint when Brother W has cau-\ntioned, advised, and reproved you. You have thought that if you\ncould be free and act yourself, you could do a good and great work.\nBut your wife\u2019s influence has greatly injured your usefulness. You\nhave not ruled well your own house; you have failed to command\nyour household after you. You have thought that you understood\nhow to manage your home matters. But how have you been de-\nceived! You have too often followed the promptings of your own\nspirit, which has resulted in perplexities and discouragements, and\nthese have clouded your discernment and weakened you spiritually [110]\nso that your labors have been marked with great imperfection.\nThe labors of Brethren R and S in ----- were premature. These\nbrethren had their past experience with its mistakes before them,\nwhich should have been sufficient to guard them from engaging in\na work that they were not qualified to perform. There was enough\n108 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthat needed to be done. It was a hard place in which to raise up a\nchurch. Opposing influences surrounded them. Every move made\nshould have been with due caution and prayerful consideration.\nThese two brethren had been warned and reproved repeatedly\nfor moving injudiciously, and they should not have taken the respon-\nsibilities upon themselves that they did. Oh, how much better would\nit have been for the cause of God in ----- had they been laboring in\nnew fields! Satan\u2019s seat is in -----, as well as in other wicked cities,\nand he is a wily foe to contend with. There were disorderly elements\namong the Sabbathkeepers in ----- that were hindrances to the cause.\nBut there is a proper time to speak and act, a golden opportunity\nwhich will show the best results of labor put forth.\nIf things had been left to more fully develop before they were\ntouched, there would have been a separation of the disorderly, un-\nconsecrated ones, and there would not have been an opposition party.\nThis should ever be saved if possible. The church might better suffer\nmuch annoyance, and exercise the more patience, than to get in a\nhurry, drive matters, and provoke a combative spirit. Those who\nreally loved the truth for the truth\u2019s sake should have pursued their\ncourse with the glory of God in view and let the light of truth shine\nout before all.\nThey might expect that the elements of confusion and dissatisfac-\ntion among them would make them trouble. Satan would not remain\nquiet and see a company raised up in ----- to vindicate truth and to\ndispel sophistry and error. His ire would be kindled, and he would\ninstitute a war against those who keep the commandments of God\nand have the testimony of Jesus. But this should not have made the[111]\nfaithful believers impatient or discouraged. These things should have\nhad an influence to make the true believer more guarded, watchful,\nand prayerful\u2014more tender, pitiful, and loving to those who were\nmaking so great a mistake in regard to eternal things. As Christ has\nborne, and continues to bear, with our errors, our ingratitude, and\nour feeble love, so should we bear with those who test and try our\npatience. Shall the followers of the self-denying, self-sacrificing\nJesus be unlike their Lord? Christians should have hearts of kindness\nand forbearance.\nLabor Among the Churches 109\nThe Gospel Sower\nThe parable of the gospel sower, which Christ presented before\nHis hearers, contains a lesson that we should study. Those who\npreach present truth and scatter the good seed will realize the same\nresults as the gospel sower. All classes will be affected more or less\nby the presentation of pointed and convincing truth. Some will be\nwayside hearers. They will be affected by the truths spoken; but they\nhave not cultivated the moral powers, they have followed inclination\nrather than duty, and evil habits have hardened their hearts until\nthey have become like the hard, beaten road. These may profess\nto believe the truth; but they will have no just sense of its sacred,\nelevated character. They do not separate from the friendship of the\nlovers of pleasure and corrupt society; but they place themselves\nwhere they are constantly tempted, and may well be represented by\nthe unfenced field. They invite the temptations of the enemy and\nfinally lose the regard they seemed to have for the truth when the\ngood seed was dropped into their hearts.\nSome are stony-ground hearers. They readily receive anything\nnew and exciting. The word of truth they receive with joy. They talk\nearnestly, with ardor and zeal, in reference to their faith and hope,\nand may even administer reproof to those of long experience for\nsome apparent deficiency or for their lack of enthusiasm. But when [112]\nthey are tested and proved by the heat of trial and temptation, when\nthe pruning knife of God is applied, that they may bring forth fruit\nunto perfection, their zeal dies, their voices are silent. No longer do\nthey boast in the strength and power of truth.\nThis class are controlled by feeling. They have not depth and sta-\nbility of character. Principle does not reach down deep, underlying\nthe springs of action. They have in word exalted the truth, but are not\ndoers of it. The seed of truth has not rooted down below the surface.\nThe heart has not been renewed by the transforming influence of\nthe Spirit of God. And when the truth calls for working men and\nwomen, when sacrifices have to be made for the truth\u2019s sake, they\nare somewhere else; and when trials and persecution come, they fall\naway because they have no depth of earth. The truth, plain, pointed,\nand close, is brought to bear upon the heart and reveals the deformity\nof character. Some will not bear this test, but frequently close their\n110 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\neyes to their imperfections; although their consciences tell them that\nthe words spoken by the messengers of God, which bear so closely\nupon their Christian characters, are truth, yet they will not listen to\nthe voice. They are offended because of the word and yield the truth\nrather than submit to be sanctified through it. They flatter themselves\nthat they may get to heaven an easier way.\nStill another class is represented in the parable. Men and women\nwho listen to the word are convinced of the truth and accept it without\nseeing the sinfulness of their hearts. The love of the world holds a\nlarge place in their affections. In deal they love to get the best of the\nbargain. They prevaricate, and by deception and fraud gain means\nwhich will ever prove as a thorn to them; for it will overbalance their\ngood purposes and intentions. The good seed sown in their hearts is\nchoked. Frequently they are so full of care and anxiety, fearing that\nthey will not gain means, or that they will lose what they have gained,\nthat they make their temporal matters primary. They do not nourish\nthe good seed. They do not attend meetings where their hearts can[113]\nbe strengthened by religious privileges. They fear that they will\nmeet with some loss in temporal things. The deceitfulness of riches\nleads them to flatter themselves that it is duty to toil and gain all\nthey can, that they may help the cause of God; and yet the more\nthey increase their earthly riches the less are their hearts inclined to\npart with their treasure, until their hearts are fully turned from the\ntruth they loved. The good seed is choked because overgrown with\nunnecessary worldly cares and needless anxiety\u2014with love for the\nworldly pleasures and honors which riches give.\nThe Wheat and Tares\nIn another parable which Jesus presented to His disciples, He\nlikened the kingdom of heaven to a field wherein a man sowed good\nseed, but in which, while he was sleeping, the enemy sowed tares.\nThe question was asked the householder: \u201cDidst not thou sow good\nseed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said unto\nthem, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt\nthou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest\nwhile ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.\nLet both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I\nLabor Among the Churches 111\nwill say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind\nthem in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.\u201d\nIf faithfulness and vigilance had been preserved, if there had been\nno sleeping or negligence upon the part of any, the enemy would\nnot have had so favorable an opportunity to sow tares among the\nwheat. Satan never sleeps. He is watching, and he improves every\nopportunity to set his agents to scatter error, which finds good soil\nin many unsanctified hearts.\nThe sincere believers of truth are made sad, and their trials and\nsorrows greatly increased, by the elements among them which annoy,\ndishearten, and discourage them in their efforts. But the Lord would\nteach His servants a lesson of great carefulness in all their moves.\n\u201cLet both grow together.\u201d Do not forcibly pull up the tares, lest in [114]\nrooting them up the precious blades will become loosened. Both\nministers and church members should be very cautious, lest they\nget a zeal not according to knowledge. There is danger of doing\ntoo much to cure difficulties in the church, which, if let alone, will\nfrequently work their own cure. It is bad policy to take hold of\nmatters in any church prematurely. We shall have to exercise the\ngreatest care, patience, and self-control to bear these things and not\ngo to work in our own spirit to set them in order.\nThe work done in ----- was premature and caused an untimely\nseparation in that little church. If the servants of God could have felt\nthe force of our Saviour\u2019s lesson in the parable of the wheat and tares,\nthey would not have undertaken the work they did. Before steps are\ntaken which will give even those who are utterly unworthy the least\noccasion to complain of being separated from the church, the matter\nshould always be made a subject of the most careful consideration\nand earnest prayer. Steps were taken in ----- which created an oppo-\nsition party. Some were wayside hearers, others were stony-ground\nhearers, and still others were of that class who received the truth\nwhile the heart had a growth of thorns which choked the good seed\u2014\nthese would never have perfected Christian characters. But there\nwere a few who might have been nourished and strengthened, and\nhave become settled and established in the truth. But the positions\ntaken by Brethren R and S brought a premature crisis, and then there\nwas a lack of wisdom and judgment in managing the faction.\n112 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nIf persons are as deserving of being separated from the church as\nSatan was of being cast out of heaven, they will have sympathizers.\nThere is always a class who are more influenced by individuals\nthan they are by the Spirit of God and sound principles; and, in\ntheir unconsecrated state, these are ever ready to take sides with\nthe wrong and give their pity and sympathy to the very ones who\nleast deserve it. These sympathizers have a powerful influence with\nothers; things are seen in a perverted light, great harm is done, and[115]\nmany souls are ruined. Satan in his rebellion took a third part of\nthe angels. They turned from the Father and from His Son, and\nunited with the instigator of rebellion. With these facts before us we\nshould move with the greatest caution. What can we expect but trial\nand perplexity in our connection with men and women of peculiar\nminds? We must bear this and avoid the necessity of rooting up the\ntares, lest the wheat be rooted up also.\n\u201cIn the world ye shall have tribulation,\u201d says Christ; but in Me\nye shall have peace. The trials to which Christians are subjected in\nsorrow, adversity, and reproach are the means appointed of God to\nseparate the chaff from the wheat. Our pride, selfishness, evil pas-\nsions, and love of worldly pleasure must all be overcome; therefore\nGod sends us afflictions to test and prove us, and show us that these\nevils exist in our characters. We must overcome through His strength\nand grace, that we may be partakers of the divine nature, having\nescaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. \u201cFor our\nlight affliction,\u201d says Paul, \u201cwhich is but for a moment, worketh for\nus a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look\nnot at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen:\nfor the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are\nnot seen are eternal.\u201d Afflictions, crosses, temptations, adversity, and\nour varied trials are God\u2019s workmen to refine us, sanctify us, and fit\nus for the heavenly garner.\nThe harm done to the cause of truth by premature moves can\nnever be fully repaired. The cause of God in ----- has not advanced as\nit might, and will not stand in as favorable a light before the people as\nbefore this work was done. There are frequently persons among us\nwhose influence seems to be but a cipher on the right side. Their lives\nseem to be useless; but let them become rebellious and combative,\nand they become zealous workmen for Satan. This work is more in\nLabor Among the Churches 113\naccordance with the feelings of the natural heart. There is great need\nof self-examination and secret prayer. God has promised wisdom [116]\nto those who ask Him. Missionary labor is frequently entered upon\nby those unprepared for the work. Outward zeal is cultivated, while\nsecret prayer is neglected. When this is the case, much harm is done,\nfor these laborers seek to regulate the consciences of others by their\nown rule. Self-control is much needed. Hasty words stir up strife.\nBrother S is in danger of indulging a spirit of sharp criticism. This\ndoes not become ministers of righteousness.\nBrother S, you have much to learn. You have been inclined to\ncharge your failures and your discouragements to Brother W, but\nclose investigation of your motives and of your course of action\nwould reveal other causes which exist in yourself for these discour-\nagements. Following the inclinations of your own natural heart\nbrings you into bondage. The severe, torturing spirit in which you\nsometimes indulge cuts off your influence. My brother, you have a\nwork to do for yourself which no other person can do for you. Each\nmust give an account of himself to God. He has given us His law\nas a mirror into which we may look and discover the defects in our\ncharacters. We are not to look into this mirror for the purpose of\nseeing our neighbor\u2019s faults reflected, of watching to see if he comes\nup to the standard, but to see the defects in ourselves, that we may\nremove them. Knowledge is not all that we need; we must follow the\nlight. We are not left to choose for ourselves and to obey that which\nis agreeable to us and to disobey when it best suits our convenience.\nObedience is better than sacrifice.\n* * * * *\nChapter 12\u2014To Wealthy Parents\nAt the camp meeting in Vermont, in 1870, I felt urged by the\nSpirit of God to bear a plain testimony relative to the duty of aged\nand wealthy parents in the disposition of their property. I had been\nshown that some men who are shrewd, prudent, and sharp in regard\nto the transaction of business generally, men who are distinguished\nfor promptness and thoroughness, manifest a want of foresight and[117]\npromptness in regard to a proper disposal of their property while\nthey are living. They know not how soon their probation may close;\nyet they pass on from year to year with their business unsettled, and\nfrequently their lives finally close without their having the use of\ntheir reason. Or they may die suddenly, without a moment\u2019s warning,\nand their property be disposed of in a manner that they would not\nhave approved. These are guilty of negligence; they are unfaithful\nstewards.\nChristians who believe the present truth should manifest wisdom\nand foresight. They should not neglect the disposition of their means,\nexpecting a favorable opportunity to adjust their business during a\nlong illness. They should have their business in such a shape that,\nwere they called at any hour to leave it, and should they have no\nvoice in its arrangement, it might be settled as they would have had\nit were they alive. Many families have been dishonestly robbed of\nall their property and have been subjected to poverty because the\nwork that might have been well done in an hour had been neglected.\nThose who make their wills should not spare pains or expense to\nobtain legal advice and to have them drawn up in a manner to stand\nthe test.\nI saw that those who profess to believe the truth should show their\nfaith by their works. They should, with the unrighteous mammon,\nmake friends, that they may finally be received into everlasting\nhabitations. God has made men stewards of means. He has placed\nin their hands the money with which to carry forward the great work\nfor the salvation of souls for whom Christ left His home, His riches,\n114\nTo Wealthy Parents 115\nHis glory, and became poor that He might, by His own humiliation\nand sacrifice, bring many sons and daughters of Adam to God. In\nHis providence the Lord has ordained that the work in His vineyard\nshould be sustained by the means entrusted to the hands of His\nstewards. A neglect on their part to answer the calls of the cause of\nGod in carrying forward His work shows them to be unfaithful and\nslothful servants.\nI had been shown some things in reference to the cause in Ver- [118]\nmont, but more especially at Bordoville and vicinity. The following\nis from Testimony for the church, vol.2, No. 20, page 651:\n\u201cThere is a work to be accomplished for many who live at Bor-\ndoville. I saw that the enemy was busily at work to carry his points.\nMen to whom God has entrusted talents of means have shifted upon\ntheir children the responsibility which Heaven has appointed them\nof being stewards for God. Instead of rendering to God the things\nthat are His, they claim that all they have is their own, as though\nby their own might and power and wisdom they had obtained their\npossessions.\u201d\n\u201cSome place their means beyond their control by putting it into\nthe hands of their children. Their secret motive is to place themselves\nin a position where they will not feel responsible to give of their\nproperty to spread the truth. These love in word, but not in deed\nand in truth. They do not realize that it is the Lord\u2019s money they are\nhandling, not their own.\u201d\n\u201cParents should have great fear in entrusting children with the\ntalents of means that God has placed in their hands, unless they\nhave the surest evidence that their children have greater interest in,\nlove for, and devotion to, the cause of God than they themselves\npossess, and that these children will be more earnest and zealous\nin forwarding the work of God, and more benevolent in carrying\nforward the various enterprises connected with it which call for\nmeans. But many place their means in the hands of their children,\nthus throwing upon them the responsibility of their own stewardship,\nbecause Satan prompts them to do it. In so doing they effectually\nplace that means in the enemy\u2019s ranks. Satan works the matter to\nsuit his own purpose and keeps from the cause of God the means\nwhich it needs, that it may be abundantly sustained.\u201d\n116 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\n\u201cMany who have made a high profession of faith are deficient\nin good works. If they should show their faith by their works they\ncould exert a powerful influence on the side of truth. But they do\nnot improve upon the talents of means lent them of God. Those[119]\nwho think to ease their consciences by willing their property to their\nchildren, or by withholding from God\u2019s cause and suffering it to\npass into the hands of unbelieving, reckless children for them to\nsquander or hoard up and worship, will have to render an account to\nGod; they are unfaithful stewards of their Lord\u2019s money. They allow\nSatan to outgeneral them through these children, whose minds are\nunder his control. Satan\u2019s purposes are accomplished in many ways,\nwhile the stewards of God seem stupefied and paralyzed; they do\nnot realize their great responsibility and the reckoning which must\nshortly come.\u201d\nI was shown that the probation of some in the vicinity of ----- was\nsoon to close, and that it was important that their work be finished\nto God\u2019s acceptance, that in the final settlement they might hear the\n\u201cWell done\u201d from the Master. I was also shown the inconsistency\nof those who profess to believe the truth withholding their means\nfrom the cause of God, that they may leave it for their children.\nMany fathers and mothers are poor in the midst of abundance. They\nabridge, in a degree, their own personal comforts and frequently\ndeny themselves of those things that are necessary for the enjoyment\nof life and health, while they have ample means at their command.\nThey feel forbidden, as it were, to appropriate their means for their\nown comfort or for charitable purposes. They have one object before\nthem, and that is to save property to leave for their children. This\nidea is so prominent, so interwoven with all their actions, that their\nchildren learn to look forward to the time when this property will\nbe theirs. They depend upon it, and this prospect has an important\nbut not a favorable influence upon their characters. Some become\nspendthrifts, others become selfish and avaricious, and still others\ngrow indolent and reckless. Many do not cultivate habits of econ-\nomy; they do not seek to become self-reliant. They are aimless,\nand have but little stability of character. The impressions received\nin childhood and youth are wrought in the texture of character and\nbecome the principle of action in mature life.\nThose who have become acquainted with the principles of the[120]\nTo Wealthy Parents 117\ntruth should closely follow the word of God as their guide. They\nshould render to God the things that are God\u2019s. I was shown that\nseveral in Vermont were making a great mistake in regard to appro-\npriating the means that God had entrusted to their keeping. They\nwere overlooking the claims of God upon all that they have. Their\neyes were blinded by the enemy of righteousness, and they were\ntaking a course which would result disastrously for themselves and\ntheir dear children.\nChildren were influencing their parents to leave their property\nin their hands for them to appropriate according to their judgment.\nWith the light of God\u2019s word, so plain and clear in reference to the\nmoney lent to stewards, and with the warnings and reproofs which\nGod has given through the Testimonies in regard to the disposition\nof means\u2014if, with all this light before them, children either directly\nor indirectly influence their parents to divide their property while\nliving, or to will it mainly to the children to come into their hands\nafter the death of their parents, they take upon themselves fearful\nresponsibilities. Children of aged parents who profess to believe the\ntruth should, in the fear of God, advise and entreat their parents to be\ntrue to their profession of faith, and take a course in regard to their\nmeans which God can approve. Parents should lay up for themselves\ntreasures in heaven by appropriating their means themselves to the\nadvancement of the cause of God. They should not rob themselves\nof heavenly treasure by leaving a surplus of means to those who\nhave enough; for by so doing they not only deprive themselves of\nthe precious privilege of laying up a treasure in the heavens that\nfaileth not, but they rob the treasury of God.\nI stated at the camp meeting that when property is willed princi-\npally to children, while none is appropriated to the cause of God, or,\nif any, a meager pittance unworthy to be mentioned, this property\nwould frequently prove a curse to the children who inherit it. It [121]\nwould be a source of temptation and would open a door through\nwhich they would be in danger of falling into many dangerous and\nhurtful lusts.\nParents should exercise the right that God has given them. He\nentrusted to them the talents He would have them use to His glory.\nThe children were not to become responsible for the talents of the\nfather. While they have sound minds and good judgment, parents\n118 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nshould, with prayerful consideration, and with the help of proper\ncounselors who have experience in the truth and a knowledge of the\ndivine will, make disposition of their property. If they have children\nwho are afflicted or are struggling in poverty, and who will make a\njudicious use of means, they should be considered. But if they have\nunbelieving children who have abundance of this world, and who\nare serving the world, they commit a sin against the Master, who has\nmade them His stewards, by placing means in their hands merely\nbecause they are their children. God\u2019s claims are not to be lightly\nregarded.\nAnd it should be distinctly understood that because parents have\nmade their will, this will not prevent them from giving means to the\ncause of God while they live. This they should do. They should\nhave the satisfaction here, and the reward hereafter, of disposing of\ntheir surplus means while they live. They should do their part to\nadvance the cause of God. They should use the means lent them\nby the Master to carry on the work which needs to be done in His\nvineyard.\nThe love of money lies at the root of nearly all the crimes com-\nmitted in the world. Fathers who selfishly retain their means to\nenrich their children, and who do not see the wants of the cause of\nGod and relieve them, make a terrible mistake. The children whom\nthey think to bless with their means are cursed with it.\nMoney left to children frequently becomes a root of bitterness.\nThey often quarrel over the property left them and in case of a will,\nare seldom all satisfied with the disposition made by the father. And\ninstead of the means left exciting gratitude and reverence for his[122]\nmemory, it creates dissatisfaction, murmuring, envy, and disrespect.\nBrothers and sisters who were at peace with one another are some-\ntimes made at variance, and family dissensions are often the result of\ninherited means. Riches are desirable only as a means of supplying\npresent wants and of doing good to others. But inherited riches of-\ntener become a snare to the possessor than a blessing. Parents should\nnot seek to have their children encounter the temptations to which\nthey expose them in leaving them means which they themselves\nhave made no effort to earn.\nI was shown that some children professing to believe the truth\nwould, in an indirect manner, influence the father to keep his means\nTo Wealthy Parents 119\nfor his children instead of appropriating it to the cause of God while\nhe lives. Those who have influenced their father to shift his steward-\nship upon them little know what they are doing. They are gathering\nupon themselves double responsibility, that of balancing the father\u2019s\nmind so that he did not fulfill the purpose of God in the disposition of\nthe means lent him of God to be used to His glory, and the additional\nresponsibility of becoming stewards of means that should have been\nput out to the exchangers by the father, that the Master could have\nreceived His own with usury.\nMany parents make a great mistake in placing their property\nout of their hands into the hands of their children while they are\nthemselves responsible for the use or abuse of the talent lent them of\nGod. Neither parents nor children are made happier by this transfer\nof property. And the parents, if they live a few years even, generally\nregret this action on their part. Parental love in their children is not\nincreased by this course. The children do not feel increased gratitude\nand obligation to their parents for their liberality. A curse seems to\nlay at the root of the matter, which only crops out in selfishness on\nthe part of the children and unhappiness and miserable feelings of\ncramped dependence on the part of the parents.\nIf parents, while they live, would assist their children to help\nthemselves, it would be better than to leave them a large amount\nat death. Children who are left to rely principally upon their own [123]\nexertions make better men and women, and are better fitted for\npractical life than those children who have depended upon their\nfather\u2019s estate. The children left to depend upon their own resources\ngenerally prize their abilities, improve their privileges, and cultivate\nand direct their faculties to accomplish a purpose in life. They\nfrequently develop characters of industry, frugality, and moral worth,\nwhich lie at the foundation of success in the Christian life. Those\nchildren for whom parents do the most, frequently feel under the\nleast obligation toward them. The errors of which we have spoken\nhave existed in -----. Parents have shifted their stewardship upon\ntheir children.\nAt the camp meeting at -----, 1870, I appealed to those who had\nmeans to use that means in the cause of God as His faithful stewards,\nand not leave this work for their children. It is a work which God\nhas left them to do, and when the Master calls them to account, they\n120 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ncan, as faithful stewards, render to Him that which He has lent them,\nboth principal and interest.\nBrethren X, Y , Z were presented before me. These men were\nmaking a mistake in regard to the appropriation of their means.\nSome of their children were influencing them in this work, and were\ngathering upon their souls responsibilities that they were ill-prepared\nto bear. They were opening a door and inviting the enemy to come\nin with his temptations to harass and destroy them. The two younger\nsons of Brother X were in great danger. They were associating with\nindividuals of a stamp of character which would not elevate, but\nwould debase them. The subtle influence of these associations was\ngaining an imperceptible influence over these young men. The con-\nversation and deportment of evil companions were of that character\nto separate them from the influence of their sisters and their sisters\u2019\nhusbands. While speaking upon this subject at the camp meeting I\nfelt deeply. I knew the persons were before me whom I had seen in\nvision. I urged upon those who heard me the necessity of thorough\nconsecration to God. I called no names, for I was not permitted to\ndo this. I was to dwell upon principles, appeal to the hearts and[124]\nconsciences, and give those who professed to love God and keep\nHis commandments an opportunity to develop character. God would\nsend them warnings and admonitions, and if they really desired to\ndo His will they had an opportunity. Light was given, and then we\nwere to wait and see if they would come to the light.\nI left the camp meeting with a burden of anxiety upon my mind\nin reference to the persons whose danger I had been shown. In a\nfew months news reached us of Brother Y\u2019s death. His property\nwas left to his children. Last December we had an appointment to\nhold meetings in Vermont. My husband was indisposed and could\nnot go. In order to save too great a disappointment, I consented to\ngo to Vermont in company with Sister Hall. I spoke to the people\nwith some freedom, but our conference meetings were not free. I\nknew that the Spirit of the Lord could not have a free course until\nconfessions were made and there was a breaking of heart before\nGod. I could not keep silent. The Spirit of the Lord was upon me,\nand I related briefly the substance of what I have written. I called the\nnames of some present who were standing in the way of the work of\nGod.\nTo Wealthy Parents 121\nThe result of leaving property to children by will, and also of\nparents\u2019 shifting the responsibility of their stewardship upon their\nchildren while the parents were living, had been verified before them.\nCovetousness had led Brother Y\u2019s sons to pursue a wrong course.\nThis was especially true of one of his sons. I labored faithfully,\nrelating the things which I had seen in reference to the church,\nespecially to the sons of Brother Y . One of these brothers, himself a\nfather, was corrupt in heart and life, a reproach to the precious cause\nof present truth; his low standard of morals was corrupting to the\nyouth.\nThe Spirit of the Lord came into the meetings, and humble\nconfessions were made by some, accompanied by tears. After the\nmeeting I had an interview with the younger sons of Brother X. I\npleaded with them, and entreated them for their souls\u2019 sake to turn [125]\nsquare about, break away from the company of those who were\nleading them on to ruin, and seek for the things which make for their\npeace. While pleading for these young men, my heart was drawn\nout after them, and I longed to see them submit to God. I prayed for\nthem, and urged them to pray for themselves. We were gaining the\nvictory; they were yielding. The voice of each was heard in humble,\npenitential prayer, and I felt that indeed the peace of God rested upon\nus. Angels seemed to be all around us, and I was shut up in a vision\nof God\u2019s glory. The state of the cause at ----- was again shown me. I\nsaw that some had backslidden far from God. The youth were in a\nstate of backsliding.\nI was shown that the two younger sons of Brother X were nat-\nurally goodhearted, conscientious young men, but that Satan had\nblinded their perception. Their companions were not all of that class\nwhich would strengthen and improve their morals or increase their\nunderstanding and love for the truth and heavenly things. \u201cOne\nsinner destroyeth much good.\u201d The ridicule and corrupt conversation\nof these companions had had its effect to dispel serious and religious\nimpressions.\nIt is wrong for Christians to associate with those whose morals\nare loose. An intimate, daily intercourse which occupies time with-\nout contributing in any degree to the strength of the intellect or\nmorals is dangerous. If the moral atmosphere surrounding persons\nis not pure and sanctified, but is tainted with corruption, those who\n122 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nbreathe this atmosphere will find that it operates almost insensibly\nupon the intellect and heart to poison and to ruin. It is dangerous\nto be conversant with those whose minds naturally take a low level.\nGradually and imperceptibly those who are naturally conscientious\nand love purity will come to the same level and partake of and sym-\npathize with the imbecility and moral barrenness with which they\nare so constantly brought in contact.\nIt was important that the associations of these young men should\nchange. \u201cEvil communications corrupt good manners.\u201d Satan has[126]\nworked through agents to ruin these young men. Nothing can more\neffectually prevent or banish serious impressions and good desires\nthan association with vain, careless, and corrupt-minded persons.\nWhatever attractions such persons may possess by their wit, sarcasm,\nand fun, the fact that they treat religion with levity and indifference is\nsufficient reason why they should not be associated with. The more\nengaging they are in other respects, the more should their influence\nbe dreaded as companions, because they throw around an irreligious\nlife so many dangerous attractions.\nThese young men should choose for their associates those who\nlove the purity of truth, whose morals are untainted, and whose\nhabits are pure. They must comply with the conditions laid down\nin the word of God, if they would indeed become sons of God,\nmembers of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. \u201cCome\nout from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch\nnot the unclean thing; and I will receive you.\u201d God loves these young\nmen, and if they will follow the leadings of His Spirit, and walk in\nHis counsel, He will be their strength.\nGod has given Brother A Y good abilities, quick perceptions,\nand a good understanding of His word. If his heart were sanctified,\nhe could have an influence for good with his brothers, as well as his\nneighbors and those with whom he associates. But the love of money\nhas taken so firm a hold of his soul, and has been so interwoven\nwith all the transactions of life, that he has become conformed to\nthe world instead of being transformed by the renewing of the mind.\nHis powers have been perverted and debased by sordid love of gain,\nwhich has made him selfish, penurious, and overbearing. Had his\nqualities been put into active use in his Master\u2019s service, rather than\nused to serve his own selfish interests, had his object and aim been\nTo Wealthy Parents 123\nto do good and glorify God, the qualities of mind that God had given\nhim would impart to his character an energy, humility, and efficiency\nwhich could not fail to command respect and would give him an\ninfluence over all with whom he associated.\nI was shown that the property left by the father had indeed been [127]\na root of bitterness to his children. Their peace and happiness, and\ntheir confidence in one another, had been greatly disturbed by it.\nBrother A Y did not need his father\u2019s property. He had enough\ntalents to handle that God had entrusted to his management. If he\nmade a right disposition of that which he had, he would at least be\namong that number who were faithful in that which is least. The\naddition of the stewardship of his father\u2019s property, which he had\ncovetously desired, was a heavier responsibility than he could well\nmanage.\nFor several years the love of money has been rooting out the love\nof humanity and the love of God. And as the means of his father\nwere within his reach, he desired to retain all that was possible in his\nown hands. He pursued a selfish course toward his brothers because\nhe had the advantage and could do so. His brothers have not had\nright feelings. They have felt bitter toward him. He has in deal\nadvantaged himself to the disadvantage of others until his course\nhas reproached the cause of God. He has lost command of himself.\nHis greatest object has been gain, selfish gain. The love of money in\nthe heart was the root of all this evil. I was shown that had he turned\nhis powers to labor in the vineyard of the Lord he would have done\nmuch good, but these qualifications perverted can do a great deal of\nharm.\nThe brothers B have not had the help they ought to have had. A\nB has labored to great disadvantage. He has taken too many burdens\nupon him, which has crippled his labors so that he has not increased\nin spiritual strength and courage as he should. The church, who\nhave the light of truth, and should be strong in God to will and do,\nand to sacrifice, if need be, for the truth\u2019s sake, have been like weak\nchildren. They have required the time and labor of Brother A B\nto settle difficulties which should never have existed. And when\nthese difficulties have arisen because of selfishness and unsanctified\nhearts, they could have been put away in an hour, had there been\nhumility and a spirit of confession.\n124 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nThe brothers B make a mistake in remaining at -----. They[128]\nshould change their location and not see this place oftener than a\nfew times in the year. They would have greater freedom in bearing\ntheir testimony. These brethren have not felt freedom in speaking\nout truth and facts as they have existed. If they had lived elsewhere,\nthey would have been more free from burdens, and their testimony\nwould have had tenfold more weight when they did visit this church.\nWhile Brother A B has been weighed down with petty church trials\nand kept at -----, he should have been laboring abroad. He has\nserved tables until his mind has become clouded, and he does not\ncomprehend the force and power of the truth. He has not been awake\nto the real wants of the cause of God. He has been losing spirituality\nand courage. The work of keeping up systematic benevolence has\nbeen neglected. Some of the brethren, whose whole interest was\nonce in the advancement of the cause of God, have been growing\nselfish and penurious instead of becoming more self-sacrificing and\ntheir love for the truth and devotion to it increasing. They have\nbeen growing less devotional and more like the world. Father C\nis one of this number. He needs a new conversion. Brother C has\nbeen favored with superior privileges, and if these are not improved,\ncondemnation and darkness will follow equal to the light he has\nhad, for the nonimprovement of the talents lent of God for him to\nimprove.\nThe brethren in Vermont have grieved the Spirit of God in allow-\ning their love for the truth and their interest in the work of God to\ndecline.\nBrother D B overtaxed his strength last season while laboring\nin new fields with the tent without suitable help. God does not\nrequire this brother, or any of His servants, to injure their health\nby exposure and taxing labor. The brethren at ----- should have\nfelt an interest that would have been shown by their works. They\ncould have secured help if they had been awake to the interest of the\ncause of God and felt the worth of souls. While Brother D B felt a\ndeep sense of the work of God and the value of souls, which called\nfor continual effort, a large church at ----- by their petty difficulties\nheld Brother A B from helping his brother. These brothers should[129]\ncome up with renewed courage, shake themselves from the trials and\ndiscouragements which have held them at ----- and crippled their\nTo Wealthy Parents 125\ntestimony, and should claim strength from the Mighty One. They\nshould have borne a plain, free testimony to Brother X and Y , and\nurged the truth home, and done what they could to have these men\nmake a proper distribution of their property. Brother A B, in taking\nso many burdens, is lessening his mental and physical strength.\nIf Brother C had been walking in the light for a few years past, he\nwould have felt the value of souls. Had he been cultivating a love for\nthe truth he might have been qualified to teach the truth to others. He\nmight have helped Brother D B in his work with the tent. He might\nat least have taken the burdens of the church at home. If he had\nhad love for his brethren, and been sanctified through the truth, he\ncould have been a peacemaker instead of a stirrer-up of strife, which,\nunited with other difficulties, called Brother A B from his brother\u2019s\nside at a most important time and resulted in Brother D B\u2019s laboring\nfar beyond his strength. And yet, after Brother D B had done all that\nhe could, the work was not accomplished that might have been had\nthere been the interest there should have been in ----- to supply help\nwhen it was so much needed. A fearful responsibility rests upon that\nchurch for their neglect of duty.\nI was shown that Brother X\u2019s course in dividing his property\namong his children was shifting the responsibility upon them which\nhe should not have laid off. He now sees that the result of this\ncourse has brought to him no increase of affection from his children.\nThey have not felt under obligation to their parents for what they\nhave done for them. These children were young and inexperienced.\nThey were not qualified to bear the responsibility laid upon them.\nTheir hearts were unconsecrated, and true friends were looked upon\nby them as designing enemies, while those who would separate\nvery friends were accepted. These agents of Satan were continually\nsuggesting false ideas to the minds of these young men, and the [130]\nhearts of brothers and sisters, father and mother, were at variance.\nFather X made a mistake. Had he confided more in his daugh-\nters\u2019 husbands, who loved the truth in sincerity, and had he been\nmore willing to be helped by the advice of these men of experi-\nence, great mistakes might have been prevented. But this is the way\nthe enemy generally succeeds in managing matters in regard to the\nappropriation of means.\n126 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nThese cases mentioned were designed of God to be developed\nthat all might see the effect of the deceitfulness of riches upon the\nheart. The result in these cases, which is apparent to all, should prove\na warning to fathers and mothers and to ambitious children. The\nword of God defines covetousness as idolatry. It is impossible for\nmen and women to keep the law of God and love money. The heart\u2019s\naffections should be placed upon heavenly things. Our treasure\nshould be laid up in heaven, for where our treasure is, there will our\nheart be also.\nNumber Twenty-Two\u2014Testimony for the [131]\nChurch\nChapter 13\u2014Proper Education\nIt is the nicest work ever assumed by men and women to deal with\nyouthful minds. The greatest care should be taken in the education of\nyouth to so vary the manner of instruction as to call forth the high and\nnoble powers of the mind. Parents and schoolteachers are certainly\ndisqualified to properly educate children if they have not first learned\nthe lesson of self-control, patience, forbearance, gentleness, and love.\nWhat an important position for parents, guardians, and teachers!\nThere are very few who realize the most essential wants of the mind\nand how to direct the developing intellect, the growing thoughts and\nfeelings of youth.\nThere is a time for training children and a time for educating\nyouth, and it is essential that in school both of these be combined\nin a great degree. Children may be trained for the service of sin\nor for the service of righteousness. The early education of youth\nshapes their characters both in their secular and in their religious life.\nSolomon says: \u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go: and when\nhe is old, he will not depart from it.\u201d This language is positive. The\ntraining which Solomon enjoins is to direct, educate, and develop. In\norder for parents and teachers to do this work, they must themselves\nunderstand \u201cthe way\u201d the child should go. This embraces more than\nmerely having a knowledge of books. It takes in everything that\nis good, virtuous, righteous, and holy. It comprehends the practice[132]\nof temperance, godliness, brotherly kindness, and love to God and\nto one another. In order to attain this object, the physical, mental,\nmoral, and religious education of children must have attention.\nThe education of children, at home or at school, should not be\nlike the training of dumb animals; for children have an intelligent\nwill, which should be directed to control all their powers. Dumb\nanimals need to be trained, for they have not reason and intellect. But\nthe human mind must be taught self-control. It must be educated to\nrule the human being, while animals are controlled by a master and\nare trained to be submissive to him. The master is mind, judgment,\n128\nProper Education 129\nand will for his beast. A child may be so trained as to have, like the\nbeast, no will of his own. Even his individuality may be merged\nin the one who superintends his training; his will, to all intents and\npurposes, is subject to the will of the teacher.\nChildren who are thus educated will ever be deficient in moral\nenergy and individual responsibility. They have not been taught to\nmove from reason and principle; their wills have been controlled by\nanother, and the mind has not been called out, that it might expand\nand strengthen by exercise. They have not been directed and disci-\nplined with respect to their peculiar constitutions and capabilities of\nmind, to put forth their strongest powers when required. Teachers\nshould not stop here, but should give special attention to the cultiva-\ntion of the weaker faculties, that all the powers may be brought into\nexercise, and carried forward from one degree of strength to another,\nthat the mind may attain due proportions.\nThere are many families of children who appear to be well trained\nwhile under the training discipline; but when the system which has\nheld them to set rules is broken up, they seem to be incapable\nof thinking, acting, or deciding for themselves. These children\nhave been so long under iron rule, not allowed to think and act for\nthemselves in those things in which it was highly proper that they\nshould, that they have no confidence in themselves to move out upon\ntheir own judgment, having an opinion of their own. And when they [133]\ngo out from their parents to act for themselves, they are easily led\nby others\u2019 judgment in the wrong direction. They have not stability\nof character. They have not been thrown upon their own judgment\nas fast and as far as practicable, and therefore their minds have not\nbeen properly developed and strengthened. They have so long been\nabsolutely controlled by their parents that they rely wholly upon\nthem; their parents are mind and judgment for them.\nOn the other hand, the young should not be left to think and\nact independently of the judgment of their parents and teachers.\nChildren should be taught to respect experienced judgment and to\nbe guided by their parents and teachers. They should be so educated\nthat their minds will be united with the minds of their parents and\nteachers, and so instructed that they can see the propriety of heeding\ntheir counsel. Then when they go forth from the guiding hand of\n130 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ntheir parents and teachers, their characters will not be like the reed\ntrembling in the wind.\nThe severe training of youth, without properly directing them\nto think and act for themselves as their own capacity and turn of\nmind will allow, that by this means they may have growth of thought,\nfeelings of self-respect, and confidence in their own ability to per-\nform, will ever produce a class who are weak in mental and moral\npower. And when they stand in the world to act for themselves they\nwill reveal the fact that they were trained like the animals, and not\neducated. Their wills, instead of being guided, were forced into\nsubjection by the harsh discipline of parents and teachers.\nThose parents and teachers who boast of having complete control\nof the minds and wills of the children under their care would cease\ntheir boastings could they trace out the future lives of the children\nwho are thus brought into subjection by force or through fear. These\nare almost wholly unprepared to share in the stern responsibilities of\nlife. When these youth are no longer under their parents and teachers,\nand are compelled to think and act for themselves, they are almost[134]\nsure to take a wrong course and yield to the power of temptation.\nThey do not make this life a success, and the same deficiencies are\nseen in their religious life. Could the instructors of children and\nyouth have the future result of their mistaken discipline mapped out\nbefore them, they would change their plan of education. That class\nof teachers who are gratified that they have almost complete control\nof the wills of their scholars are not the most successful teachers,\nalthough the appearance for the time being may be flattering.\nGod never designed that one human mind should be under the\ncomplete control of another. And those who make efforts to have\nthe individuality of their pupils merged in themselves, and to be\nmind, will, and conscience for them, assume fearful responsibilities.\nThese scholars may, upon certain occasions, appear like well-drilled\nsoldiers. But when the restraint is removed, there will be seen a\nwant of independent action from firm principle existing in them.\nThose who make it their object to so educate their pupils that they\nmay see and feel that the power lies in themselves to make men and\nwomen of firm principle, qualified for any position in life, are the\nmost useful and permanently successful teachers. Their work may\nnot show to the very best advantage to careless observers, and their\nProper Education 131\nlabors may not be valued as highly as are those of the teacher who\nholds the minds and wills of his scholars by absolute authority; but\nthe future lives of the pupils will show the fruits of the better plan of\neducation.\nThere is danger of both parents and teachers commanding and\ndictating too much, while they fail to come sufficiently into social\nrelation with their children or scholars. They often hold themselves\ntoo much reserved, and exercise their authority in a cold, unsympa-\nthizing manner which cannot win the hearts of their children and\npupils. If they would gather the children close to them, and show that\nthey love them, and would manifest an interest in all their efforts and\neven in their sports, sometimes even being a child among children,\nthey would make the children very happy and would gain their love [135]\nand win their confidence. And the children would sooner respect\nand love the authority of their parents and teachers.\nThe habits and principles of a teacher should be considered of\neven greater importance than his literary qualifications. If he is\na sincere Christian he will feel the necessity of having an equal\ninterest in the physical, mental, moral, and spiritual education of his\nscholars. In order to exert the right influence, he should have perfect\ncontrol over himself, and his own heart should be richly imbued\nwith love for his pupils, which will be seen in his looks, words, and\nacts. He should have firmness of character, and then he can mold\nthe minds of his pupils as well as instruct them in the sciences. The\nearly education of youth generally shapes their characters for life.\nThose who deal with the young should be very careful to call out\nthe qualities of the mind, that they may better know how to direct its\npowers so that they may be exercised to the very best account.\nClose Confinement at School\nThe system of education carried out for generations back has\nbeen destructive to health and even life itself. Many young chil-\ndren have passed five hours each day in schoolrooms not properly\nventilated, nor sufficiently large for the healthful accommodation\nof the scholars. The air of such rooms soon becomes poison to the\nlungs that inhale it. Little children, whose limbs and muscles are not\nstrong, and whose brains are undeveloped, have been kept confined\n132 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nindoors to their injury. Many have but a slight hold on life to begin\nwith. Confinement in school from day to day makes them nervous\nand diseased. Their bodies are dwarfed because of the exhausted\ncondition of the nervous system. And if the lamp of life goes out,\nthe parents and teachers do not consider that they had any direct\ninfluence in quenching the vital spark. When standing by the graves\nof their children, the afflicted parents look upon their bereavement\nas a special dispensation of Providence, when, by inexcusable igno-[136]\nrance, their own course has destroyed the lives of their children. To\nthen charge their death to Providence is blasphemy. God wanted the\nlittle ones to live and be disciplined, that they might have beautiful\ncharacters and glorify Him in this world and praise Him in the better\nworld.\nParents and teachers, in taking the responsibility of training\nthese children, do not feel their accountability before God to become\nacquainted with the physical organism, that they may treat the bodies\nof their children and pupils in a manner to preserve life and health.\nThousands of children die because of the ignorance of parents and\nteachers. Mothers will spend hours over needless work upon their\nown dresses and those of their children to fit them for display, and\nwill then plead that they cannot find time to read up and obtain the\ninformation necessary to take care of the health of their children.\nThey think it less trouble to trust their bodies to the doctors. In order\nto be in accordance with fashion and custom, many parents have\nsacrificed the health and lives of their children.\nTo become acquainted with the wonderful human organism, the\nbones, muscles, stomach, liver, bowels, heart, and pores of the skin,\nand to understand the dependence of one organ upon another for\nthe healthful action of all, is a study in which most mothers take\nno interest. They know nothing of the influence of the body upon\nthe mind and of the mind upon the body. The mind, which allies\nfinite to the infinite, they do not seem to understand. Every organ\nof the body was made to be servant to the mind. The mind is the\ncapital of the body. Children are allowed to eat flesh meats, spices,\nbutter, cheese, pork, rich pastry, and condiments generally. They\nare also allowed to eat irregularly and between meals of unhealthful\nfood. These things do their work of deranging the stomach, exciting\nthe nerves to unnatural action, and enfeebling the intellect. Parents\nProper Education 133\ndo not realize that they are sowing the seed which will bring forth\ndisease and death.\nMany children have been ruined for life by urging the intellect [137]\nand neglecting to strengthen the physical powers. Many have died in\nchildhood because of the course pursued by injudicious parents and\nschoolteachers in forcing their young intellects, by flattery or fear,\nwhen they were too young to see the inside of a schoolroom. Their\nminds have been taxed with lessons when they should not have been\ncalled out, but kept back until the physical constitution was strong\nenough to endure mental effort. Small children should be left as free\nas lambs to run out of doors, to be free and happy, and should be\nallowed the most favorable opportunities to lay the foundation for\nsound constitutions.\nParents should be the only teachers of their children until they\nhave reached eight or ten years of age. As fast as their minds can\ncomprehend it, the parents should open before them God\u2019s great\nbook of nature. The mother should have less love for the artificial\nin her house and in the preparation of her dress for display, and\nshould find time to cultivate, in herself and in her children, a love\nfor the beautiful buds and opening flowers. By calling the attention\nof her children to their different colors and variety of forms, she\ncan make them acquainted with God, who made all the beautiful\nthings which attract and delight them. She can lead their minds up\nto their Creator and awaken in their young hearts a love for their\nheavenly Father, who has manifested so great love for them. Parents\ncan associate God with all His created works. The only schoolroom\nfor children from eight to ten years of age should be in the open\nair amid the opening flowers and nature\u2019s beautiful scenery. And\ntheir only textbook should be the treasures of nature. These lessons,\nimprinted upon the minds of young children amid the pleasant,\nattractive scenes of nature, will not be soon forgotten.\nIn order for children and youth to have health, cheerfulness, vi-\nvacity, and well-developed muscles and brains, they should be much\nin the open air and have well-regulated employment and amusement.\nChildren and youth who are kept at school and confined to books, [138]\ncannot have sound physical constitutions. The exercise of the brain\nin study, without corresponding physical exercise, has a tendency\nto attract the blood to the brain, and the circulation of the blood\n134 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthrough the system becomes unbalanced. The brain has too much\nblood and the extremities too little. There should be rules regulating\ntheir studies to certain hours, and then a portion of their time should\nbe spent in physical labor. And if their habits of eating, dressing,\nand sleeping are in accordance with physical law, they can obtain an\neducation without sacrificing physical and mental health.\nPhysical Decline of the Race\nThe book of Genesis gives quite a definite account of social\nand individual life, and yet we have no record of an infant\u2019s being\nborn blind, deaf, crippled, deformed, or imbecile. There is not an\ninstance upon record of a natural death in infancy, childhood, or\nearly manhood. There is no account of men and women dying of\ndisease. Obituary notices in the book of Genesis run thus: \u201cAnd all\nthe days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and\nhe died.\u201d \u201cAnd all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve\nyears: and he died.\u201d Concerning others, the record states: He lived\nto a good old age; and he died. It was so rare for a son to die before\nthe father that such an occurrence was considered worthy of record:\n\u201cAnd Haran died before his father Terah.\u201d Haran was a father of\nchildren before his death.\nGod endowed man with so great vital force that he has withstood\nthe accumulation of disease brought upon the race in consequence\nof perverted habits, and has continued for six thousand years. This\nfact of itself is enough to evidence to us the strength and electrical\nenergy that God gave to man at his creation. It took more than two\nthousand years of crime and indulgence of base passions to bring\nbodily disease upon the race to any great extent. If Adam, at his\ncreation, had not been endowed with twenty times as much vital\nforce as men now have, the race, with their present habits of living[139]\nin violation of natural law, would have become extinct. At the time\nof Christ\u2019s first advent the race had degenerated so rapidly that an\naccumulation of disease pressed upon that generation, bringing in a\ntide of woe and a weight of misery inexpressible.\nThe wretched condition of the world at the present time has been\npresented before me. Since Adam\u2019s fall the race has been degener-\nating. Some of the reasons for the present deplorable condition of\nProper Education 135\nmen and women, formed in the image of God, were shown me. And\na sense of how much must be done to arrest, even in a degree, the\nphysical, mental, and moral decay, caused my heart to be sick and\nfaint. God did not create the race in its present feeble condition. This\nstate of things is not the work of Providence, but the work of man;\nit has been brought about by wrong habits and abuses, by violating\nthe laws that God has made to govern man\u2019s existence. Through the\ntemptation to indulge appetite, Adam and Eve first fell from their\nhigh, holy, and happy estate. And it is through the same temptation\nthat the race have become enfeebled. They have permitted appetite\nand passion to take the throne, and to bring into subjection reason\nand intellect.\nThe violation of physical law, and the consequence, human suf-\nfering, have so long prevailed that men and women look upon the\npresent state of sickness, suffering, debility, and premature death\nas the appointed lot of humanity. Man came from the hand of his\nCreator perfect and beautiful in form, and so filled with vital force\nthat it was more than a thousand years before his corrupt appetite\nand passions, and general violations of physical law, were sensibly\nfelt upon the race. More recent generations have felt the pressure\nof infirmity and disease still more rapidly and heavily with every\ngeneration. The vital forces have been greatly weakened by the\nindulgence of appetite and lustful passion.\nThe patriarchs from Adam to Noah, with but few exceptions,\nlived nearly a thousand years. Since the days of Noah the length of\nlife has been tapering. Those suffering with disease were brought [140]\nto Christ from every city, town, and village for Him to heal; for\nthey were afflicted with all manner of diseases. And disease has\nbeen steadily on the increase through successive generations since\nthat period. Because of the continued violation of the laws of life,\nmortality has increased to a fearful extent. The years of man have\nbeen shortened, so that the present generation pass to the grave,\neven before the age at which the generations that lived the first few\nthousand years after the creation came upon the stage of action.\nDisease has been transmitted from parents to children, from gen-\neration to generation. Infants in the cradle are miserably afflicted\nbecause of the sins of their parents, which have lessened their vital\nforce. Their wrong habits of eating and dressing, and their general\n136 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ndissipation, are transmitted as an inheritance to their children. Many\nare born insane, deformed, blind, deaf, and a very large class are\ndeficient in intellect. The strange absence of principle which charac-\nterizes this generation, and which is shown in their disregard of the\nlaws of life and health, is astonishing. Ignorance prevails upon this\nsubject, while light is shining all around them. With the majority,\ntheir principal anxiety is, What shall I eat? what shall I drink? and\nwherewithal shall I be clothed? Notwithstanding all that is said and\nwritten in regard to how we should treat our bodies, appetite is the\ngreat law which governs men and women generally.\nThe moral powers are weakened because men and women will\nnot live in obedience to the laws of health and make this great\nsubject a personal duty. Parents bequeath to their offspring their\nown perverted habits, and loathsome diseases corrupt the blood\nand enervate the brain. The majority of men and women remain\nin ignorance of the laws of their being, and indulge appetite and\npassion at the expense of intellect and morals, and seem willing\nto remain in ignorance of the result of their violation of nature\u2019s\nlaws. They indulge the depraved appetite in the use of slow poisons\nwhich corrupt the blood and undermine the nervous forces, and\nin consequence bring upon themselves sickness and death. Their[141]\nfriends call the result of this course the dispensation of Providence.\nIn this they insult Heaven. They rebelled against the laws of nature\nand suffered the punishment for thus abusing her laws. Suffering\nand mortality now prevail everywhere, especially among children.\nHow great is the contrast between this generation and those who\nlived during the first two thousand years!\nImportance of Home Training\nI inquired if this tide of woe could not be prevented and some-\nthing be done to save the youth of this generation from the ruin\nwhich threatens them. I was shown that one great cause of the ex-\nisting deplorable state of things is that parents do not feel under\nobligation to bring up their children to conform to physical law.\nMothers love their children with an idolatrous love and indulge their\nappetite when they know that it will injure their health and thereby\nbring upon them disease and unhappiness. This cruel kindness is\nProper Education 137\nmanifested to a great extent in the present generation. The desires\nof children are gratified at the expense of health and happy tempers\nbecause it is easier for the mother, for the time being, to gratify them\nthan to withhold that for which they clamor.\nThus mothers are sowing the seed that will spring up and bear\nfruit. The children are not educated to deny their appetites and\nrestrict their desires. And they become selfish, exacting, disobedient,\nunthankful, and unholy. Mothers who are doing this work will reap\nwith bitterness the fruit of the seed they have sown. They have\nsinned against Heaven and against their children, and God will hold\nthem accountable.\nHad education for generations back been conducted upon alto-\ngether a different plan, the youth of this generation would not now\nbe so depraved and worthless. The managers and teachers of schools\nshould have been those who understood physiology and who had an\ninterest, not only to educate the youth in the sciences, but to teach [142]\nthem how to preserve health so that they might use their knowledge\nto the best account after they had obtained it. There should have\nbeen connected with the schools, establishments for carrying on\nvarious branches of labor, that the students might have employment\nand the necessary exercise out of school hours.\nThe students\u2019 employment and amusements should have been\nregulated with reference to physical law and should have been\nadapted to preserve to them the healthy tone of all the powers of\nbody and mind. Then a practical knowledge of business could have\nbeen obtained while their literary education was being gained. Stu-\ndents at school should have had their moral sensibilities aroused to\nsee and feel that society has claims upon them and that they should\nlive in obedience to natural law so that they can, by their existence\nand influence, by precept and example, be an advantage and bless-\ning to society. It should be impressed upon the youth that all have\nan influence that is constantly telling upon society to improve and\nelevate or to lower and debase. The first study of the young should\nbe to know themselves and how to keep their bodies in health.\nMany parents keep their children at school nearly the year round.\nThese children go through the routine of study mechanically, but do\nnot retain that which they learn. Many of these constant students\nseem almost destitute of intellectual life. The monotony of continual\n138 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nstudy wearies the mind, and they take but little interest in their\nlessons; and to many the application to books becomes painful.\nThey have not an inward love of thought and an ambition to acquire\nknowledge. They do not encourage in themselves habits of reflection\nand investigation.\nChildren are in great need of proper education in order that they\nmay be of use in the world. But any effort that exalts intellectual\nculture above moral training is misdirected. Instructing, cultivating,\npolishing, and refining youth and children should be the main burden\nwith both parents and teachers. Close reasoners and logical thinkers\nare few for the reason that false influences have checked the devel-[143]\nopment of the intellect. The supposition of parents and teachers that\ncontinual study would strengthen the intellect has proved erroneous,\nfor in many cases it has had the opposite effect.\nIn the early education of children many parents and teachers\nfail to understand that the greatest attention needs to be given to\nthe physical constitution, that a healthy condition of body and brain\nmay be secured. It has been the custom to encourage children\nto attend school when they are mere babies, needing a mother\u2019s\ncare. When of a delicate age they are frequently crowded into ill-\nventilated schoolrooms, where they sit in wrong positions upon\npoorly constructed benches, and as the result the young and tender\nframes of some have become deformed.\nThe disposition and habits of youth will be very likely to be\nmanifested in mature manhood. You may bend a young tree into\nalmost any shape that you choose, and if it remains and grows as you\nhave bent it, it will be a deformed tree and will ever tell of the injury\nand abuse received at your hand. You may, after years of growth, try\nto straighten the tree, but all your efforts will prove unavailing. It\nwill ever be a crooked tree. This is the case with the minds of youth.\nThey should be carefully and tenderly trained in childhood. They\nmay be trained in the right direction or in the wrong, and in their\nfuture lives they will pursue the course in which they were directed\nin youth. The habits formed in youth will grow with the growth\nand strengthen with the strength, and will generally be the same in\nafterlife, only continually growing stronger.\nWe are living in an age when almost everything is superficial.\nThere is but little stability and firmness of character, because the\nProper Education 139\ntraining and education of children from their cradle is superficial.\nTheir characters are built upon sliding sand. Self-denial and self-\ncontrol have not been molded into their characters. They have been\npetted and indulged until they are spoiled for practical life. The love\nof pleasure controls minds, and children are flattered and indulged to\ntheir ruin. Children should be so trained and educated that they will [144]\nexpect temptations and calculate to meet difficulties and dangers.\nThey should be taught to have control over themselves and to nobly\novercome difficulties; and if they do not willfully rush into danger\nand needlessly place themselves in the way of temptation; if they\nshun evil influences and vicious society, and then are unavoidably\ncompelled to be in dangerous company, they will have strength of\ncharacter to stand for the right and preserve principle, and will come\nforth in the strength of God with their morals untainted. If youth\nwho have been properly educated make God their trust, their moral\npowers will stand the most powerful test.\nBut few parents realize that their children are what their example\nand discipline have made them, and that they are responsible for\nthe characters their children develop. If the hearts of Christian\nparents were in obedience to the will of Christ, they would obey the\ninjunction of the heavenly Teacher: \u201cBut seek ye first the kingdom\nof God, and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added\nunto you.\u201d If those who profess to be followers of Christ would\nonly do this, they would give, not only to their children, but to\nthe unbelieving world, examples that would rightly represent the\nreligion of the Bible.\nIf Christian parents lived in obedience to the requirements of\nthe divine Teacher, they would preserve simplicity in eating and in\ndressing, and would live more in accordance with natural law. They\nwould not then devote so much time to artificial life, in making for\nthemselves cares and burdens that Christ has not laid upon them, but\nthat He has positively bid them shun. If the kingdom of God and\nHis righteousness were the first and all-important consideration with\nparents, but little precious time would be lost in needless outward\nornamentation while the minds of their children are almost entirely\nneglected. The precious time devoted by many parents to dressing\ntheir children for display in their scenes of amusement would better,\nfar better, be spent in cultivating their own minds in order that\n140 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthey may be competent to properly instruct their children. It is not[145]\nessential to the salvation or happiness of these parents that they use\nthe precious probationary time that God has lent them, in dressing,\nvisiting, and gossiping.\nMany parents plead that they have so much to do that they have\nno time to improve their minds, to educate their children for practical\nlife, or to teach them how they may become lambs of Christ\u2019s fold.\nNot until the final settlement, when the cases of all will be decided,\nand the acts of our entire lives will be laid open to our view in the\npresence of God and the Lamb and all the holy angels, will parents\nrealize the almost infinite value of their misspent time. Very many\nwill then see that their wrong course has determined the destiny of\ntheir children. Not only have they failed to secure for themselves\nthe words of commendation from the King of glory, \u201cWell done,\nthou good and faithful servant: ... enter thou into the joy of thy\nLord,\u201d but they hear pronounced upon their children the terrible\ndenunciation, \u201cDepart!\u201d This separates their children forever from\nthe joys and glories of heaven, and from the presence of Christ. And\nthey themselves also receive the denunciation: Depart, \u201cthou wicked\nand slothful servant.\u201d Jesus will never say \u201cWell done\u201d to those who\nhave not earned the \u201cWell done\u201d by their faithful lives of self-denial\nand self-sacrifice to do others good and to promote His glory. Those\nwho live principally to please themselves instead of to do others\ngood will meet with infinite loss.\nIf parents could be aroused to a sense of the fearful responsibil-\nity which rests upon them in the work of educating their children,\nmore of their time would be devoted to prayer and less to needless\ndisplay. They would reflect and study and pray earnestly to God\nfor wisdom and divine aid to so train their children that they may\ndevelop characters that God will approve. Their anxiety would not\nbe to know how they can educate their children so that they will be\npraised and honored of the world, but how they can educate them to\nform beautiful characters that God can approve.\nMuch study and earnest prayer for heavenly wisdom are needed[146]\nto know how to deal with youthful minds, for very much depends\nupon the direction parents give to the minds and wills of their chil-\ndren. To balance their minds in the right direction and at the right\ntime is a most important work, for their eternal destiny may depend\nProper Education 141\non the decisions made at some critical moment. How important,\nthen, that the minds of parents be as free as possible from perplexing,\nwearing care in temporal things, that they may think and act with\ncalm consideration, wisdom, and love, and make the salvation of\nthe souls of their children the first and highest consideration! The\ngreat object which parents should seek to attain for their dear chil-\ndren should be the inward adorning. Parents cannot afford to allow\nvisitors and strangers to claim their attention, and by robbing them\nof time, which is life\u2019s great capital, make it impossible for them to\ngive their children each day that patient instruction which they must\nhave to give right direction to their developing minds.\nThis lifetime is too short to be squandered in vain and trifling\ndiversion, in unprofitable visiting, in needless dressing for display,\nor in exciting amusements. We cannot afford to squander the time\ngiven us of God in which to bless others and in which to lay up for\nourselves a treasure in heaven. We have none too much time for the\ndischarge of necessary duties. We should give time to the culture of\nour own hearts and minds in order that we may be qualified for our\nlifework. By neglecting these essential duties and conforming to the\nhabits and customs of fashionable, worldly society, we do ourselves\nand our children a great wrong.\nMothers who have youthful minds to train and the characters of\nchildren to form should not seek the excitement of the world in order\nto be cheerful and happy. They have an important lifework, and they\nand theirs cannot afford to spend time in an unprofitable manner.\nTime is one of the important talents which God has entrusted to\nus and for which He will call us to account. A waste of time is a\nwaste of intellect. The powers of the mind are susceptible of high [147]\ncultivation. It is the duty of mothers to cultivate their minds and\nkeep their hearts pure. They should improve every means within\ntheir reach for their intellectual and moral improvement, that they\nmay be qualified to improve the minds of their children. Those who\nindulge their disposition to be in company will soon feel restless\nunless visiting or entertaining visitors. Such have not the power\nof adaptation to circumstances. The necessary, sacred home du-\nties seem commonplace and uninteresting to them. They have no\nlove for self-examination or self-discipline. The mind hungers for\nthe varying, exciting scenes of worldly life; children are neglected\n142 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nfor the indulgence of inclination; and the recording angel writes:\n\u201cUnprofitable servants.\u201d God designs that our minds should not be\npurposeless, but should accomplish good in this life.\nIf parents would feel that it is a solemn duty enjoined upon them\nof God to educate their children for usefulness in this life; if they\nwould adorn the inner temple of the souls of their sons and daughters\nfor the immortal life, we should see a great change in society for\nthe better. There would not then be manifest so great indifference\nto practical godliness, and it would not be so difficult to arouse the\nmoral sensibilities of children to understand the claims that God\nhas upon them. But parents become more and more careless in the\neducation of their children in the useful branches. Many parents\nallow their children to form wrong habits and to follow their own\ninclination, and fail to impress upon their minds the danger of their\ndoing this and the necessity of their being controlled by principle.\nChildren frequently begin a piece of work with enthusiasm, but,\nbecoming perplexed or wearied with it, they wish to change and take\nhold of something new. Thus they may take hold of several things,\nmeet with a little discouragement, and give them up; and so they\npass from one thing to another, perfecting nothing. Parents should\nnot allow the love of change to control their children. They should\nnot be so much engaged with other things that they will have no[148]\ntime to patiently discipline the developing minds. A few words of\nencouragement, or a little help at the right time, may carry them\nover their trouble and discouragement, and the satisfaction they\nwill derive from seeing the task completed that they undertook will\nstimulate them to greater exertion.\nMany children, for want of words of encouragement and a little\nassistance in their efforts, become disheartened and change from one\nthing to another. And they carry this sad defect with them in mature\nlife. They fail to make a success of anything they engage in, for they\nhave not been taught to persevere under discouraging circumstances.\nThus the entire lifetime of many proves a failure, because they did\nnot have correct discipline when young. The education received in\nchildhood and youth affects their entire business career in mature\nlife, and their religious experience bears a corresponding stamp.\nProper Education 143\nPhysical Labor for Students\nWith the present plan of education a door of temptation is opened\nto the youth. Although they generally have too many hours of study,\nthey have many hours without anything to do. These leisure hours are\nfrequently spent in a reckless manner. The knowledge of bad habits\nis communicated from one to another, and vice is greatly increased.\nVery many young men who have been religiously instructed at home,\nand who go out to the schools comparatively innocent and virtuous,\nbecome corrupt by associating with vicious companions. They lose\nself-respect and sacrifice noble principles. Then they are prepared to\npursue the downward path, for they have so abused their consciences\nthat sin does not appear so exceeding sinful. These evils, which exist\nin the schools that are conducted according to the present plan, might\nbe remedied in a great degree if study and labor could be combined.\nThe same evils exist in the higher schools, only in a greater degree;\nfor many of the youth have educated themselves in vice, and their [149]\nconsciences are seared.\nMany parents overrate the stability and good qualities of their\nchildren. They do not seem to consider that they will be exposed to\nthe deceptive influences of vicious youth. Parents have their fears as\nthey send them some distance away to school, but flatter themselves\nthat, as they have had good examples and religious instruction, they\nwill be true to principle in their high-school life. Many parents\nhave but a faint idea to what extent licentiousness exists in these\ninstitutions of learning. In many cases the parents have labored\nhard and suffered many privations for the cherished object of having\ntheir children obtain a finished education. And after all their efforts,\nmany have the bitter experience of receiving their children from their\ncourse of studies with dissolute habits and ruined constitutions. And\nfrequently they are disrespectful to their parents, unthankful, and\nunholy. These abused parents, who are thus rewarded by ungrateful\nchildren, lament that they sent their children from them to be exposed\nto temptations and come back to them physical, mental, and moral\nwrecks. With disappointed hopes and almost broken hearts they see\ntheir children, of whom they had high hopes, follow in a course of\nvice and drag out a miserable existence.\n144 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nBut there are those of firm principles who answer the expectation\nof parents and teachers. They go through the course of schooling\nwith clear consciences and come forth with good constitutions and\nmorals unstained by corrupting influences. But the number is few.\nSome students put their whole being into their studies and con-\ncentrate their mind upon the object of obtaining an education. They\nwork the brain, but allow the physical powers to remain inactive.\nThe brain is overworked, and the muscles become weak because\nthey are not exercised. When these students graduate, it is evident\nthat they have obtained their education at the expense of life. They\nhave studied day and night, year after year, keeping their minds\ncontinually upon the stretch, while they have failed to sufficiently\nexercise their muscles. They sacrifice all for a knowledge of the[150]\nsciences, and pass to their graves.\nYoung ladies frequently give themselves up to study to the ne-\nglect of other branches of education even more essential for practical\nlife than the study of books. And after having obtained their edu-\ncation, they are often invalids for life. They neglected their health\nby remaining too much indoors, deprived of the pure air of heaven\nand of the God-given sunlight. These young ladies might have come\nfrom their schools in health, had they combined with their studies\nhousehold labor and exercise in the open air.\nHealth is a great treasure. It is the richest possession mortals can\nhave. Wealth, honor, or learning is dearly purchased, if it be at the\nloss of the vigor of health. None of these attainments can secure\nhappiness, if health is wanting. It is a terrible sin to abuse the health\nthat God has given us; for every abuse of health enfeebles us for life\nand makes us losers, even if we gain any amount of education.\nIn many cases parents who are wealthy do not feel the importance\nof giving their children an education in the practical duties of life as\nwell as in the sciences. They do not see the necessity, for the good\nof their children\u2019s minds and morals, and for their future usefulness,\nof giving them a thorough understanding of useful labor. This is due\ntheir children, that, should misfortune come, they could stand forth\nin noble independence, knowing how to use their hands. If they have\na capital of strength they cannot be poor, even if they have not a\ndollar. Many who in youth were in affluent circumstances may be\nrobbed of all their riches and be left with parents and brothers and\nProper Education 145\nsisters dependent upon them for sustenance. Then how important\nthat every youth be educated to labor, that they may be prepared for\nany emergency! Riches are indeed a curse when their possessors\nlet them stand in the way of their sons and daughters\u2019 obtaining a\nknowledge of useful labor, that they may be qualified for practical\nlife.\nThose who are not compelled to labor, frequently do not have [151]\nsufficient active exercise for physical health. Young men, for want\nof having their minds and hands employed in active labor, acquire\nhabits of indolence and frequently obtain what is most to be dreaded,\na street education\u2014lounging about stores, smoking, drinking, and\nplaying cards.\nYoung ladies will read novels, excusing themselves from active\nlabor because they are in delicate health. Their feebleness is the\nresult of their lack of exercising the muscles God has given them.\nThey may think they are too feeble to do housework, but will work\nat crochet and tatting, and preserve the delicate paleness of their\nhands and faces, while their care-burdened mothers toil hard to wash\nand iron their garments. These ladies are not Christians, for they\ntransgress the fifth commandment. They do not honor their parents.\nBut the mother is the one who is most to blame. She has indulged her\ndaughters and excused them from bearing their share of household\nduties, until work has become distasteful to them, and they love and\nenjoy delicate idleness. They eat, and sleep, and read novels, and\ntalk of the fashions, while their lives are useless.\nPoverty, in many cases, is a blessing; for it prevents youth and\nchildren from being ruined by inaction. The physical as well as the\nmental powers should be cultivated and properly developed. The\nfirst and constant care of parents should be to see that their children\nhave firm constitutions, that they may be sound men and women.\nIt is impossible to attain this object without physical exercise. For\ntheir own physical health and moral good, children should be taught\nto work, even if there is no necessity so far as want is concerned.\nIf they would have pure and virtuous characters they must have the\ndiscipline of well-regulated labor, which will bring into exercise all\nthe muscles. The satisfaction that children will have in being useful,\nand in denying themselves to help others, will be the most healthful\n146 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\npleasure they ever enjoyed. Why should the wealthy rob themselves\nand their dear children of this great blessing?\nParents, inaction is the greatest curse that ever came upon youth.[152]\nYour daughters should not be allowed to lie in bed late in the morn-\ning, sleeping away the precious hours lent them of God to be used\nfor the best purpose and for which they will have to give an account\nto Him. The mother does her daughters great injury by bearing the\nburdens that they should share with her for their own present and\nfuture good. The course that many parents pursue in allowing their\nchildren to be indolent and to gratify their desire for reading romance\nis unfitting them for real life. Novel and storybook reading are the\ngreatest evils in which youth can indulge. Novel and love-story read-\ners always fail to make good, practical mothers. They are air-castle\nbuilders, living in an unreal, an imaginary world. They become\nsentimental and have sick fancies. Their artificial life spoils them\nfor anything useful. They are dwarfed in intellect, although they\nmay flatter themselves that they are superior in mind and manners.\nExercise in household labor is of the greatest advantage to young\ngirls.\nPhysical labor will not prevent the cultivation of the intellect.\nFar from it. The advantages gained by physical labor will balance\na person and prevent the mind from being overworked. The toil\nwill come upon the muscles and relieve the wearied brain. There\nare many listless, useless girls who consider it unladylike to engage\nin active labor. But their characters are too transparent to deceive\nsensible persons in regard to their real worthlessness. They simper\nand giggle, and are all affectation. They appear as though they could\nnot speak their words fairly and squarely, but torture all they say with\nlisping and simpering. Are these ladies? They were not born fools,\nbut were educated such. It does not require a frail, helpless, over-\ndressed, simpering thing to make a lady. A sound body is required\nfor a sound intellect. Physical soundness and a practical knowledge\nof all the necessary household duties will never be hindrances to a\nwell-developed intellect; both are highly important for a lady.\nAll the powers of the mind should be called into use and devel-\noped in order for men and women to have well-balanced minds. The[153]\nworld is full of one-sided men and women who have become such\nbecause one set of their faculties was cultivated while others were\nProper Education 147\ndwarfed from inaction. The education of most youth is a failure.\nThey overstudy, while they neglect that which pertains to practical\nbusiness life. Men and women become parents without considering\ntheir responsibilities, and their offspring sink lower in the scale of\nhuman deficiency than they themselves. Thus the race is fast degen-\nerating. The constant application to study, as the schools are now\nconducted, is unfitting youth for practical life. The human mind will\nhave action. If it is not active in the right direction, it will be active\nin the wrong. In order to preserve the balance of the mind, labor and\nstudy should be united in the schools.\nProvision should have been made in past generations for educa-\ntion upon a larger scale. In connection with the schools should have\nbeen agricultural and manufacturing establishments. There should\nalso have been teachers of household labor. And a portion of the\ntime each day should have been devoted to labor, that the physical\nand mental powers might be equally exercised. If schools had been\nestablished upon the plan we have mentioned, there would not now\nbe so many unbalanced minds.\nGod prepared for Adam and Eve a beautiful garden. He pro-\nvided for them everything that their wants required. He planted for\nthem fruit-bearing trees of every variety. With a liberal hand He\nsurrounded them with His bounties. The trees for usefulness and\nbeauty, and the lovely flowers which sprang up spontaneously and\nflourished in rich profusion around them, were to know nothing\nof decay. Adam and Eve were rich indeed. They possessed Eden.\nAdam was Lord in his beautiful domain. None can question the\nfact that he was rich. But God knew that Adam could not be happy\nunless he had employment. Therefore He gave him something to\ndo; he was to dress the garden.\nIf men and women of this degenerate age have a large amount of\nearthly treasure, which, in comparison with that Paradise of beauty [154]\nand wealth given the lordly Adam, is very insignificant, they feel\nthemselves above labor and educate their children to look upon it\nas degrading. Such rich parents, by precept and example, instruct\ntheir children that money makes the gentleman and the lady. But\nour idea of the gentleman and the lady is measured by the intellect\nand the moral worth. God estimates not by dress. The exhortation\nof the inspired apostle Peter is: \u201cWhose adorning let it not be that\n148 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\noutward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of\nputting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in\nthat which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet\nspirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\u201d A meek and quiet\nspirit is exalted above worldly honor or riches.\nThe Lord illustrates how He estimates the worldly wealthy who\nlift up their souls unto vanity because of their earthly possessions,\nby the rich man who tore down his barns and built greater, that he\nmight have room to bestow his goods. Forgetful of God, he failed to\nacknowledge whence all his possessions came. No grateful thanks\nascended to his gracious Benefactor. He congratulated himself thus:\n\u201cSoul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease,\neat, drink, and be merry.\u201d The Master, who had entrusted to him\nearthly riches with which to bless his fellow men and glorify his\nMaker, was justly angry at his ingratitude and said: \u201cThou fool, this\nnight thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things\nbe, which thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for\nhimself, and is not rich toward God.\u201d Here we have an illustration\nof how the infinite God estimates man. An extensive fortune, or\nany degree of wealth, will not secure the favor of God. All these\nbounties and blessings come from Him to prove, test, and develop\nthe character of man.\nMen may have boundless wealth; yet if they are not rich toward\nGod, if they have no interest to secure to themselves the heavenly\ntreasure and divine wisdom, they are counted fools by their Creator,[155]\nand we leave them just where God leaves them. Labor is a blessing.\nIt is impossible for us to enjoy health without labor. All the faculties\nshould be called into use that they may be properly developed and\nthat men and women may have well-balanced minds. If the young\nhad been given a thorough education in the different branches of\nlabor, if they had been taught labor as well as the sciences, their\neducation would have been of greater advantage to them.\nA constant strain upon the brain while the muscles are inactive,\nenfeebles the nerves, and students have an almost uncontrollable\ndesire for change and exciting amusements. And when they are\nreleased, after being confined to study several hours each day, they\nare nearly wild. Many have never been controlled at home. They\nhave been left to follow inclination, and they think that the restraint\nProper Education 149\nof the hours of study is a severe tax upon them; and since they\ndo not have anything to do after study hours, Satan suggests sport\nand mischief for a change. Their influence over other students is\ndemoralizing. Those students who have had the benefits of religious\nteaching at home, and who are ignorant of the vices of society,\nfrequently become the best acquainted with those whose minds have\nbeen cast in an inferior mold, and whose advantages for mental\nculture and religious training have been very limited. And they are\nin danger, by mingling in the society of this class and by breathing an\natmosphere that is not elevating but that tends to lower and degrade\nthe morals, of sinking to the same low level as their companions. It\nis the delight of a large class of students, in their unemployed hours,\nto have a high time. And very many of those who leave their homes\ninnocent and pure become corrupted by their associations at school.\nI have been led to inquire: Must all that is valuable in our youth\nbe sacrificed in order that they may obtain a school education? Had\nthere been agricultural and manufacturing establishments connected\nwith our schools, and had competent teachers been employed to edu-\ncate the youth in the different branches of study and labor, devoting a\nportion of each day to mental improvement and a portion to physical [156]\nlabor, there would now be a more elevated class of youth to come\nupon the stage of action to have influence in molding society. Many\nof the youth who would graduate at such institutions would come\nforth with stability of character. They would have perseverance,\nfortitude, and courage to surmount obstacles, and such principles\nthat they would not be swayed by a wrong influence, however popu-\nlar. There should have been experienced teachers to give lessons to\nyoung ladies in the cooking department. Young girls should have\nbeen instructed to manufacture wearing apparel, to cut, make, and\nmend garments, and thus become educated for the practical duties\nof life.\nFor young men there should be establishments where they could\nlearn different trades which would bring into exercise their muscles\nas well as their mental powers. If the youth can have but a one-sided\neducation, which is of the greater consequence, a knowledge of\nthe sciences,\u2014with all the disadvantages to health and life,\u2014or a\nknowledge of labor for practical life? We unhesitatingly answer:\nThe latter. If one must be neglected, let it be the study of books.\n150 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nThere are very many girls who have married and have families\nwho have but little practical knowledge of the duties devolving upon\na wife and mother. They can read, and play upon an instrument of\nmusic; but they cannot cook. They cannot make good bread, which is\nvery essential to the health of the family. They cannot cut and make\ngarments, for they never learned how. They considered these things\nunessential, and in their married life they are as dependent upon\nsomeone to do these things for them as are their own little children.\nIt is this inexcusable ignorance in regard to the most needful duties\nof life which makes very many unhappy families.\nThe impression that work is degrading to fashionable life has\nlaid thousands in the grave who might have lived. Those who per-\nform only manual labor frequently work to excess without giving\nthemselves periods of rest; while the intellectual class overwork the\nbrain and suffer for want of the healthful vigor the physical labor[157]\ngives. If the intellectual would to some extent share the burden of\nthe laboring class and thus strengthen the muscles, the laboring class\nmight do less and devote a portion of their time to mental and moral\nculture. Those of sedentary and literary habits should take physical\nexercise, even if they have no need to labor so far as means are\nconcerned. Health should be a sufficient inducement to lead them to\nunite physical with mental labor.\nMoral, intellectual, and physical culture should be combined in\norder to have well-developed, well-balanced men and women. Some\nare qualified to exercise greater intellectual strength than others,\nwhile others are inclined to love and enjoy physical labor. Both of\nthese classes should seek to improve where they are deficient, that\nthey may present to God their entire being, a living sacrifice, holy\nand acceptable to Him, which is their reasonable service. The habits\nand customs of fashionable society should not gauge their course\nof action. The inspired apostle Paul adds: \u201cAnd be not conformed\nto this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind,\nthat ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect,\nwill of God.\u201d\nThe minds of thinking men labor too hard. They frequently use\ntheir mental powers prodigally, while there is another class whose\nhighest aim in life is physical labor. The latter class do not exercise\nthe mind. Their muscles are exercised while their brains are robbed\nProper Education 151\nof intellectual strength, just as the minds of thinking men are worked\nwhile their bodies are robbed of strength and vigor by their neglect\nto exercise the muscles. Those who are content to devote their lives\nto physical labor and leave others to do the thinking for them, while\nthey simply carry out what other brains have planned, will have\nstrength of muscle but feeble intellects. Their influence for good is\nsmall in comparison to what it might be if they would use their brains\nas well as their muscles. This class fall more readily if attacked by\ndisease; the system is vitalized by the electrical force of the brain to\nresist disease.\nMen who have good physical powers should educate themselves [158]\nto think as well as to act, and not depend upon others to be brains for\nthem. It is a popular error with a large class to regard work as degrad-\ning. Therefore young men are very anxious to educate themselves to\nbecome teachers, clerks, merchants, lawyers, and to occupy almost\nany position that does not require physical labor. Young women\nregard housework as demeaning. And although the physical exercise\nrequired to perform household labor, if not too severe, is calculated\nto promote health, yet they will seek for an education that will fit\nthem to become teachers or clerks, or will learn some trade which\nwill confine them indoors to sedentary employment. The bloom\nof health fades from their cheeks, and disease fastens upon them,\nbecause they are robbed of physical exercise and their habits are\nperverted generally. All this because it is fashionable! They enjoy\ndelicate life, which is feebleness and decay.\nTrue, there is some excuse for young women not choosing house-\nwork for employment, because those who hire kitchen girls generally\ntreat them as servants. Frequently their employers do not respect\nthem and treat them as though they were unworthy to be members\nof their families. They do not give them the privileges they do the\nseamstress, the copyist, and the teacher of music. But there can be\nno employment more important than that of housework. To cook\nwell, to present healthful food upon the table in an inviting manner,\nrequires intelligence and experience. The one who prepares the food\nthat is to be placed in our stomachs, to be converted into blood to\nnourish the system, occupies a most important and elevated position.\nThe position of copyist, dressmaker, or music teacher cannot equal\nin importance that of the cook.\n152 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nThe foregoing is a statement of what might have been done by\na proper system of education. Time is too short now to accomplish\nthat which might have been done in past generations; but we can\ndo much, even in these last days, to correct the existing evils in the\neducation of youth. And because time is short, we should be in[159]\nearnest and work zealously to give the young that education which\nis consistent with our faith. We are reformers. We desire that our\nchildren should study to the best advantage. In order to do this,\nemployment should be given them which will call the muscles into\nexercise. Daily, systematic labor should constitute a part of the\neducation of the youth, even at this late period. Much can now be\ngained by connecting labor with schools. In following this plan the\nstudents will realize elasticity of spirit and vigor of thought, and\nwill be able to accomplish more mental labor in a given time than\nthey could by study alone. And they can leave school with their\nconstitutions unimpaired and with strength and courage to persevere\nin any position in which the providence of God may place them.\nBecause time is short, we should work with diligence and double\nenergy. Our children may never enter college, but they can obtain\nan education in those essential branches which they can turn to\na practical use and which will give culture to the mind and bring\nits powers into use. Very many youth who have gone through a\ncollege course have not obtained that true education that they can\nput to practical use. They may have the name of having a collegiate\neducation, but in reality they are only educated dunces.\nThere are many young men whose services God would accept\nif they would consecrate themselves to Him unreservedly. If they\nwould exercise those powers of the mind in the service of God which\nthey use in serving themselves and in acquiring property they would\nmake earnest, persevering, successful laborers in the vineyard of\nthe Lord. Many of our young men should turn their attention to\nthe study of the Scriptures, that God may use them in His cause.\nBut they do not become as intelligent in spiritual knowledge as in\ntemporal things; therefore they fail to do the work of God which\nthey could do with acceptance. There are but few to warn sinners\nand win souls to Christ, when there should be many. Our young\nmen generally are wise in worldly matters, but not intelligent in[160]\nregard to the things of the kingdom of God. They might turn their\nProper Education 153\nminds in a heavenly, divine channel and walk in the light, going on\nfrom one degree of light and strength to another until they could\nturn sinners to Christ and point the unbelieving and desponding to a\nbright track heavenward. And when the warfare is ended, they might\nbe welcomed to the joy of their Lord.\nYoung men should not enter upon the work of explaining the\nScriptures and lecturing upon the prophecies when they do not have\na knowledge of the important Bible truths they try to explain to\nothers. They may be deficient in the common branches of education\nand therefore fail to do the amount of good they could do if they had\nhad the advantages of a good school. Ignorance will not increase\nthe humility or spirituality of any professed follower of Christ. The\ntruths of the divine word can be best appreciated by an intellectual\nChristian. Christ can be best glorified by those who serve Him\nintelligently. The great object of education is to enable us to use\nthe powers which God has given us in such a manner as will best\nrepresent the religion of the Bible and promote the glory of God.\nWe are indebted to Him who gave us existence, for all the talents\nwhich have been entrusted to us; and it is a duty we owe to our\nCreator to cultivate and improve upon the talents He has committed\nto our trust. Education will discipline the mind, develop its powers,\nand understandingly direct them, that we may be useful in advancing\nthe glory of God. We need a school where those who are just\nentering the ministry may be taught at least the common branches of\neducation and where they may also learn more perfectly the truths of\nGod\u2019s word for this time. In connection with these schools, lectures\nshould be given upon the prophecies. Those who really have good\nabilities such as God will accept to labor in His vineyard would be\nvery much benefited by only a few months\u2019 instruction at such a\nschool. (161)\nChapter 14\u2014The Health Reform[161]\nDecember 10, 1871, I was again shown that the health reform is\none branch of the great work which is to fit a people for the coming\nof the Lord. It is as closely connected with the third angel\u2019s message\nas the hand is with the body. The law of Ten Commandments has\nbeen lightly regarded by man, but the Lord would not come to punish\nthe transgressors of that law without first sending them a message\nof warning. The third angel proclaims that message. Had men ever\nbeen obedient to the law of Ten Commandments, carrying out in\ntheir lives the principles of those precepts, the curse of disease now\nflooding the world would not be.\nMen and women cannot violate natural law by indulging de-\npraved appetite and lustful passions, and not violate the law of God.\nTherefore He has permitted the light of health reform to shine upon\nus, that we may see our sin in violating the laws which He has estab-\nlished in our being. All our enjoyment or suffering may be traced\nto obedience or transgression of natural law. Our gracious heavenly\nFather sees the deplorable condition of men who, some knowingly\nbut many ignorantly, are living in violation of the laws that He has\nestablished. And in love and pity to the race, He causes the light\nto shine upon health reform. He publishes His law and the penalty\nthat will follow the transgression of it, that all may learn and be\ncareful to live in harmony with natural law. He proclaims His law so\ndistinctly and makes it so prominent that it is like a city set on a hill.\nAll accountable beings can understand it if they will. Idiots will not\nbe responsible. To make plain natural law, and urge the obedience of\nit, is the work that accompanies the third angel\u2019s message to prepare\na people for the coming of the Lord.\nAdam and Eve fell through intemperate appetite. Christ came\nand withstood the fiercest temptation of Satan and, in behalf of the\nrace, overcame appetite, showing that man may overcome. As Adam\nfell through appetite and lost blissful Eden, the children of Adam[162]\n154\nHealth Reform 155\nmay, through Christ, overcome appetite and through temperance in\nall things regain Eden.\nIgnorance is no excuse now for the transgression of law. The light\nshines clearly, and none need be ignorant, for the great God Himself\nis man\u2019s instructor. All are bound by the most sacred obligations to\nGod to heed the sound philosophy and genuine experience which He\nis now giving them in reference to health reform. He designs that the\ngreat subject of health reform shall be agitated and the public mind\ndeeply stirred to investigate; for it is impossible for men and women,\nwith all their sinful, health-destroying, brain-enervating habits, to\ndiscern sacred truth, through which they are to be sanctified, refined,\nelevated, and made fit for the society of heavenly angels in the\nkingdom of glory.\nThe inhabitants of the Noachian world were destroyed because\nthey were corrupted through the indulgence of perverted appetite.\nSodom and Gomorrah were destroyed through the gratification of\nunnatural appetite, which so benumbed the intellect that they could\nnot discern the difference between the sacred claims of God and the\nclamor of appetite. The latter enslaved them, and they became so\nferocious and bold in their detestable abominations that God would\nnot tolerate them upon the earth. God ascribes the wickedness of\nBabylon to her gluttony and drunkenness.\nThe apostle Paul exhorts the church: I beseech you therefore,\nbrethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a liv-\ning sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable\nservice.\u201d Men, then, can make their bodies unholy by sinful indul-\ngences. If unholy, they are unfitted to be spiritual worshipers and\nare not worthy of heaven. If man will cherish the light that God in\nmercy gives him upon health reform, he may be sanctified through\nthe truth and fitted for immortality. But if he disregards that light\nand lives in violation of natural law he must pay the penalty.\nGod created man perfect and holy. But man fell from his holy\nestate because he transgressed God\u2019s law. Since the Fall there has [163]\nbeen a rapid increase of disease, suffering, and death. Yet notwith-\nstanding man has insulted his Creator, God\u2019s love is still extended to\nthe race; and He permits light to shine that man may see that in order\nto live a perfect life he must live in harmony with those natural laws\nwhich govern his being. Therefore it is of the greatest importance\n156 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthat he know how to live so that his powers of body and mind may\nbe exercised to the glory of God.\nIt is impossible for man to present his body a living sacrifice,\nholy, and acceptable to God, while, because it is customary for the\nworld to do so, he is indulging in habits that are lessening physical,\nmental, and moral vigor. The apostle adds: \u201cAnd be not conformed\nto this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind,\nthat ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will\nof God.\u201d Jesus, seated upon the Mount of Olives, gave instruction to\nHis disciples concerning the signs which should precede His coming.\nHe said: \u201cBut as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of\nthe Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the Flood they\nwere eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until\nthe day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not until the Flood\ncame, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son\nof man be.\u201d\nThe same sins exist in our day which brought the wrath of God\nupon the world in the days of Noah. Men and women now carry their\neating and drinking to gluttony and drunkenness. This prevailing\nsin, the indulgence of perverted appetite, inflamed the passions of\nmen in the days of Noah and led to general corruption, until their\nviolence and crimes reached to heaven, and God washed the earth\nof its moral pollution by a flood.\nThe same sins of gluttony and drunkenness benumbed the moral\nsensibilities of the inhabitants of Sodom so that crimes seemed to\nbe the delight of the men and women of that wicked city. Christ\nthus warns the world: \u201cLikewise also as it was in the days of Lot;\nthey did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they[164]\nbuilded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire\nand brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall\nit be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.\u201d\nChrist has here left us a most important lesson. He does not in\nHis teaching encourage indolence. His example was the opposite of\nthis. Christ was an earnest worker. His life was one of self-denial,\ndiligence, perseverance, industry, and economy. He would lay before\nus the danger of making eating and drinking paramount. He reveals\nthe result of giving up to indulgence of appetite. The moral powers\nare enfeebled so that sin does not appear sinful. Crimes are winked\nHealth Reform 157\nat, and base passions control the mind until general corruption roots\nout good principles and impulses, and God is blasphemed. All this is\nthe result of eating and drinking to excess. This is the very condition\nof things which He declares will exist at His second coming.\nWill men and women be warned? Will they cherish the light,\nor will they become slaves to appetite and base passions? Christ\npresents to us something higher to toil for than merely what we shall\neat, and what we shall drink, and wherewithal we shall be clothed.\nEating, drinking, and dressing are carried to such excess that they\nbecome crimes, and are among the marked sins of the last days,\nand constitute a sign of Christ\u2019s soon coming. Time, money, and\nstrength, which are the Lord\u2019s, but which He has entrusted to us,\nare wasted in needless superfluities of dress and luxuries for the\nperverted appetite, which lessen vitality and bring suffering and\ndecay. It is impossible to present our bodies a living sacrifice to God\nwhen they are filled with corruption and disease by our own sinful\nindulgence.\nKnowledge must be gained in regard to how to eat and drink and\ndress so as to preserve health. Sickness is caused by violating the\nlaws of health; it is the result of violating nature\u2019s law. Our first duty,\none which we owe to God, to ourselves, and to our fellow men, is\nto obey the laws of God, which include the laws of health. If we\nare sick we impose a weary tax upon our friends and unfit ourselves [165]\nfor discharging our duties to our families and to our neighbors. And\nwhen premature death is the result of our violation of nature\u2019s law,\nwe bring sorrow and suffering to others; we deprive our neighbors\nof the help we ought to render them in living; we rob our families\nof the comfort and help we might render them, and rob God of the\nservice He claims of us to advance His glory. Then, are we not, in\nthe worst sense, transgressors of God\u2019s law?\nBut God is all-pitiful, gracious, and tender, and when light comes\nto show who have injured their health by sinful indulgences, and\nthey are convinced of sin, and repent and seek pardon, He accepts\nthe poor offering rendered to Him, and receives them. Oh, what\ntender mercy that He does not refuse the remnant of the abused life\nof the suffering, repenting sinner! In His gracious mercy He saves\nthese souls as by fire. But what an inferior, pitiful sacrifice, at best,\nto offer to a pure and holy God! Noble faculties have been paralyzed\n158 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nby wrong habits of sinful indulgence. The aspirations are perverted,\nand the soul and body defaced.\n* * * * *\nChapter 15\u2014The Health Institute\nThe great work of reform must go forward. The Health Insti-\ntute has been established at Battle Creek to relieve the afflicted, to\ndisseminate light, to awaken the spirit of inquiry, and to advance\nreform. This institution is conducted upon principles which are\ndifferent from those of any other hygienic institution in the land.\nMoney is not the great object with its friends and conductors. They\nconduct it from a conscientious, religious standpoint, aiming to carry\nout the principles of Bible hygiene. Most institutions of the kind are\nestablished upon different principles and are conservative, making it\ntheir object to meet the popular class halfway and to so shape their\ncourse that they will receive the greatest patronage and the most\nmoney.\nThe Health Institute at Battle Creek is established upon firm [166]\nreligious principles. Its conductors acknowledge God as the real\nproprietor. Physicians and helpers look to Him for guidance, and\naim to move conscientiously, in His fear. For this reason it stands\nupon a sure basis. When feeble, suffering invalids learn in regard\nto the principles of the directors, superintendent, physicians, and\nhelpers at the Institute that they have the fear of God before them,\nthey will feel safer there than at popular institutions.\nIf those connected with the Health Institute at Battle Creek\nshould descend from the pure, exalted principles of Bible truth\nto imitate the theories and practices of those at the head of other\ninstitutions, where only the diseases of invalids are treated, and that\nmerely for money, the conductors not working from a high, religious\nstandpoint, God\u2019s special blessing would not rest upon the Institute.\nThis institution is designed of God to be one of the greatest aids in\npreparing a people to be perfect before God. In order to attain to this\nperfection, men and women must have physical and mental strength\nto appreciate the elevated truths of God\u2019s word and be brought into\na position where they will discern the imperfections in their moral\ncharacters. They should be in earnest to reform, that they may have\n159\n160 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nfriendship with God. The religion of Christ is not to be placed in the\nbackground and its holy principles laid down to meet the approval\nof any class, however popular. If the standard of truth and holiness\nis lowered, the design of God will not then be carried out in this\ninstitution.\nBut our peculiar faith should not be discussed with patients. Their\nminds should not be unnecessarily excited upon subjects wherein\nwe differ, unless they themselves desire it; and then great caution\nshould be observed not to agitate the mind by urging upon them our\npeculiar faith. The Health Institute is not the place to be forward\nto enter into discussion upon points of our faith wherein we differ\nwith the religious world generally. Prayer meetings are held at the\nInstitute in which all may take part if they choose, but there is an\nabundance to dwell upon in regard to Bible religion without touching[167]\nobjectionable points of difference. Silent influence will do more\nthan open controversy.\nIn exhortation in the prayer meetings some Sabbathkeepers have\nfelt that they must bring in the Sabbath and the third angel\u2019s message\nor they could not have freedom. This is characteristic of narrow\nminds. Patients not acquainted with our faith do not know what\nis meant by the third angel\u2019s message. The introduction of these\nterms without a clear explanation of them does only harm. We must\nmeet the people where they are, and yet we need not sacrifice one\nprinciple of the truth. The prayer meeting will prove a blessing to\npatients, helpers, and physicians. Brief and interesting seasons of\nprayer and social worship will increase the confidence of patients in\ntheir physicians and helpers. The helpers should not be deprived of\nthese meetings by work unless it is positively necessary. They need\nthem and should enjoy them.\nBy thus establishing regular meetings the patients gain confi-\ndence in the Institute and feel more at home. And thus the way is\nprepared for the seed of truth to take root in some hearts. These\nmeetings especially interest some who profess to be Christians and\nmake a favorable impression upon those who do not. Mutual con-\nfidence is increased in one another, and prejudice is weakened and\nin many cases entirely removed. Then there is an anxiety to attend\nthe Sabbath meeting. There, in the house of God, is the place to\nspeak our denominational sentiments. There the minister can dwell\nHealth Institute 161\nwith clearness upon the essential points of present truth and with\nthe spirit of Christ, in love and tenderness, urge home upon all the\nnecessity of obedience to all the requirements of God, and let the\ntruth convict hearts.\nI was shown that a larger work could be accomplished if there\nwere gentlemen physicians of the right stamp of mind who had\nproper culture and a thorough understanding of every part of the work\ndevolving on a physician. The physicians should have a large stock\nof patience, forbearance, kindliness, and pity; for they need these [168]\nqualifications in dealing with suffering invalids, who are diseased\nin body, and many of whom are diseased both in body and in mind.\nIt is not an easy matter to obtain the right class of men and women,\nthose who are fitted for the place and who will work harmoniously,\nzealously, and unselfishly for the benefit of suffering invalids. Men\nare wanted at the Institute who will have the fear of God before them\nand who can minister to sick minds and keep prominent the health\nreform from a religious standpoint.\nThose who engage in this work should be consecrated to God\nand not make it their only object to treat the body merely to cure\ndisease, thus working from the popular physician\u2019s standpoint, but\nto be spiritual fathers, to minister to diseased minds, and point the\nsin-sick soul to the never-failing remedy, the Saviour who died for\nthem. Those who are reduced by disease are sufferers in more than\none sense. They can endure bodily pain far better than they can\nbear mental suffering. Many carry a violated conscience and can be\nreached only by the principles of Bible religion.\nWhen the poor, suffering paralytic was brought to the Saviour,\nthe urgency of the case seemed not to admit of a moment\u2019s delay, for\nalready dissolution was doing its work upon the body. When those\nwho bore him upon his bed saw that they could not come directly\ninto the presence of Christ, they at once tore open the roof and let\ndown the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay. Our Saviour saw and\nunderstood his condition perfectly. He also knew that this wretched\nman had a sickness of the soul far more aggravating than bodily\nsuffering. He knew that the greatest burden he had borne for months\nwas on account of sins. The crowd of people waited with almost\nbreathless silence to see how Christ would treat this case, apparently\n162 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nso hopeless, and were astonished to hear the words which fell from\nHis lips: \u201cSon, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.\u201d\nThese were the most precious words that could fall upon the ear[169]\nof that sick sufferer, for the burden of sin had lain so heavily upon\nhim that he could not find the least relief. Christ lifts the burden\nthat so heavily oppressed him: \u201cBe of good cheer;\u201d I, your Saviour,\ncame to forgive sins. How quickly the pallid countenance of the\nsufferer changes! Hope takes the place of dark despair, and peace\nand joy take the place of distressing doubt and stolid gloom. The\nmind being restored to peace and happiness, the suffering body can\nnow be reached. Next comes from the divine lips: \u201cThy sins be\nforgiven thee;\u201d \u201carise; and walk.\u201d In the effort to obey the will, those\nlifeless, bloodless arms are quickened; a healthful current of blood\nflows through the veins; the leaden color of his flesh disappears, and\nthe ruddy glow of health takes its place. The limbs that for long\nyears have refused to obey the will are now quickened to life, and\nthe healed paralytic grasps his bed and walks through the crowd to\nhis home, glorifying God.\nThis case is for our instruction. Physicians who would be suc-\ncessful in the treatment of disease should know how to minister to\na diseased mind. They can have a powerful influence for good if\nthey make God their trust. Some invalids need to be relieved of\npain before the mind can be reached. After relief has come to the\nbody, the physician can frequently the more successfully appeal to\nthe conscience, and the heart will be more susceptible to the in-\nfluences of the truth. There is danger of those connected with the\nHealth Institute losing sight of the object for which such an institu-\ntion was established by Seventh-day Adventists, and working from\nthe worlding\u2019s standpoint, patterning after other institutions.\nThe Health Institute was not established among us for the pur-\npose of obtaining money, although money is very necessary to carry\nforward the institution successfully. Economy should be exercised\nby all in the expenditure of means, that money be not used need-\nlessly. But there should be sufficient means to invest in all necessary\nconveniences which will make the work of helpers, and especially\nof physicians, as easy as possible. And the directors of the Insti-[170]\ntute should avail themselves of every facility which will aid in the\nsuccessful treatment of patients.\nHealth Institute 163\nPatients should be treated with the greatest sympathy and ten-\nderness. And yet the physicians should be firm and not allow them-\nselves, in their treatment of the sick, to be dictated to by patients.\nFirmness on the part of the physicians is necessary for the good of\nthe patients. But firmness should be mingled with respectful cour-\ntesy. No physician or helper should contend with a patient, or use\nharsh, irritating words, or even words not the most kindly, however\nprovoking the patient may be.\nOne of the great objects of our Health Institute is to direct sin-\nsick souls to the Great Physician, the true healing Fountain, and call\ntheir attention to the necessity of reform from a religious standpoint,\nthat they no longer violate the law of God by sinful indulgences.\nIf the moral sensibilities of invalids can be aroused and they see\nthat they are sinning against their Creator by bringing sickness upon\nthemselves and by the indulgence of appetite and debasing pas-\nsions, when they leave the Health Institute they will not leave their\nprinciples behind, but will take them with them and be genuine\nhealth reformers at home. If the moral sensibilities are aroused,\npatients will have a determination to carry out their convictions of\nconscience; and if they see the truth they will obey it. They will\nhave true, noble independence to practice the truths to which they\nassent. And if the mind is at peace with God, the bodily conditions\nwill be more favorable.\nThe greatest responsibility rests upon the church at Battle Creek\nto live and walk in the light, and to preserve their simplicity and sep-\naration from the world, that their influence may tell with convincing\npower upon strangers to the truth who attend our meetings. If the\nchurch at Battle Creek is a lifeless body, filled with pride, exalted\nabove the simplicity of true godliness, and leaning to the world,\nits influence will be to scatter from Christ and to make the most\nsolemn and essential truths of the Bible of no force. The members of\nthis church have opportunities to be benefited by lectures from the [171]\nphysicians of the Health Institute. They can obtain information upon\nthe great subject of health reform if they desire it. But the church at\nBattle Creek, who make great profession of the truth, are far behind\nother churches who have not been blessed with the advantages they\nhave had. The neglect of the church to live up to the light which they\nhave had upon health reform is a discouragement to the physicians\n164 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nand to the friends of the Health Institute. If the church would mani-\nfest a greater interest in the reforms which God Himself has brought\nto them to fit them for His coming, their influence would be tenfold\nwhat it now is.\nMany who profess to believe the Testimonies live in neglect\nof the light given. The dress reform is treated by some with great\nindifference and by others with contempt, because there is a cross\nattached to it. For this cross I thank God. It is just what we need to\ndistinguish and separate God\u2019s commandment-keeping people from\nthe world. The dress reform answers to us as did the ribbon of blue\nto ancient Israel. The proud, and those who have no love for sacred\ntruth, which will separate them from the world, will show it by their\nworks. God in His providence has given us the light upon health\nreform, that we may understand it in all its bearings, follow the light\nit brings, and by rightly relating ourselves to life have health that we\nmay glorify God and be a blessing to others.\nThe church in general at Battle Creek have not sustained the\nInstitute by their example. They have not honored the light of health\nreform by carrying it out in their families. The sickness that has\nvisited many families in Battle Creek need not have been if they had\nfollowed the light God has given them. Like ancient Israel they have\ndisregarded the light and could see no more necessity of restricting\ntheir appetite than did ancient Israel. The children of Israel would\nhave flesh meats and said, as many now say: We shall die without\nmeat. God gave rebellious Israel flesh, but His curse was with it.\nThousands of them died while the meat they desired was between[172]\ntheir teeth. We have the example of ancient Israel and the warning\nfor us not to do as they did. Their history of unbelief and rebellion\nis left on record as a special warning that we should not follow their\nexample of murmuring at God\u2019s requirements. How can we pass\non so indifferently, choosing our own course, following the sight of\nour own eyes, and departing further and further from God, as did\nthe Hebrews? God cannot do great things for His people because of\ntheir hardness of heart and sinful unbelief.\nGod is no respecter of persons; but in every generation they that\nfear the Lord and work righteousness are accepted of Him; while\nthose who are murmuring, unbelieving, and rebellious will not have\nHis favor nor the blessings promised to those who love the truth\nHealth Institute 165\nand walk in it. Those who have the light and do not follow it, but\ndisregard the requirements of God, will find that their blessings\nwill be changed into curses and their mercies into judgments. God\nwould have us learn humility and obedience as we read the history\nof ancient Israel, who were His chosen and peculiar people, but who\nbrought their own destruction by following their own ways.\nThe religion of the Bible is not detrimental to the health of the\nbody or of the mind. The influence of the Spirit of God is the very\nbest medicine that can be received by a sick man or woman. Heaven\nis all health, and the more deeply the heavenly influences are realized\nthe more sure will be the recovery of the believing invalid. At some\nother health institutions they encourage amusements, plays, and\ndancing to get up an excitement, but are fearful as to the result of\na religious interest. Dr. Jackson\u2019s theory in this respect is not only\nerroneous but dangerous. Yet he has talked this in such a manner\nthat, were his instructions heeded, patients would be led to think\nthat their recovery depended upon their having as few thoughts of\nGod and heaven as possible. It is true that there are persons with\nill-balanced minds who imagine themselves to be very religious and\nwho impose upon themselves fasting and prayer to the injury of [173]\ntheir health. These souls suffer themselves to be deceived. God has\nnot required this of them. They have a pharisaical righteousness,\nwhich springs, not from Christ, but from themselves. They trust to\ntheir own good works for salvation and are seeking to buy heaven\nby meritorious works of their own instead of relying, as every sinner\nshould, alone upon the merits of a crucified and risen Saviour. Christ\nand true godliness, today and forever, will be health to the body and\nstrength to the soul.\nThe cloud which has rested upon our Health Institute is lifting,\nand the blessing of God has attended the efforts made to place it upon\na right basis and to correct the errors of those who through unfaith-\nfulness brought great embarrassment upon it and discouragement\nupon its friends everywhere.\nThose who have assigned to the charitable uses of the Institute\nthe interest, or dividend, of their stock, have done a noble thing,\nwhich will meet its reward. All those who have not made an as-\nsignment, who are able to do so, should, at their first opportunity,\nassign all or a part, as most of the stockholders have done. And as\n166 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthe growing interest and usefulness of this institution demand it, all,\nespecially those who have not done so, should continue to take stock\nin it.\nI saw that there was a large amount of surplus means among our\npeople, a portion of which should be put into the Health Institute. I\nalso saw that there are many worthy poor among our people who are\nsick and suffering, and who have been looking toward the Institute\nfor help, but who are not able to pay the regular prices for board,\ntreatment, etc. The Institute has struggled hard with debts the last\nthree years and could not treat patients to any considerable extent\nwithout full pay. It would please God for all our people who are able\nto do so to take stock liberally in the Institute to place it in a condition\nwhere it can help God\u2019s humble, worthy poor. In connection with\nthis I saw that Christ identifies Himself with suffering humanity, and\nthat what we have the privilege of doing for even the least of His[174]\nchildren, whom He calls His brethren, we do to the Son of God.\n\u201cThen shall the King say unto them on His right hand, Come,\nye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from\nthe foundation of the world: for I was an hungered, and ye gave Me\nmeat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink: I was a stranger, and ye\ntook Me in: naked, and ye clothed Me: I was sick, and ye visited\nMe: I was in prison, and ye came unto Me. Then shall the righteous\nanswer Him, saying, Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered, and\nfed thee? or thirsty, and gave Thee drink? When saw we Thee a\nstranger, and took Thee in? or naked, and clothed Thee? Or when\nsaw we Thee sick, or in prison, and came unto Thee? And the King\nshall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as\nye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have\ndone it unto Me. Then shall He say also unto them on the left hand,\nDepart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the\ndevil and his angels: for I was anhungered, and ye gave Me no meat:\nI was thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took\nMe not in: naked, and ye clothed Me not: sick, and in prison, and\nye visited Me not. Then shall they also answer Him, saying, Lord,\nwhen saw we Thee anhungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked,\nor sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto Thee? Then shall\nHe answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did\nit not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me. And these\nHealth Institute 167\nshall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into\nlife eternal.\u201d\nTo raise the Health Institute from its low state in the autumn\nof 1869 to its present prosperous, hopeful condition has demanded\nsacrifices and exertions of which its friends abroad know but little.\nThen it had a debt of thirteen thousand dollars and had but eight\npaying patients. And what was worse still, the course of former\nmanagers had been such as to so far discourage its friends that they\nhad no heart to furnish means to lift the debt or to recommend the\nsick to patronize the Institute. It was at this discouraging point that [175]\nmy husband decided in his mind that the Institute property must be\nsold to pay the debts, and the balance, after the payment of debts,\nbe refunded to stockholders in proportion to the amount of stock\neach held. But one morning, in prayer at the family altar, the Spirit\nof God came upon him as he was praying for divine guidance in\nmatters pertaining to the Institute, and he exclaimed, while bowed\nupon his knees: \u201cThe Lord will vindicate every word He has spoken\nthrough vision relative to the Health Institute, and it will be raised\nfrom its low estate and prosper gloriously.\u201d\nFrom that point of time we took hold of the work in earnest and\nhave labored side by side for the Institute to counteract the influence\nof selfish men who had brought embarrassment upon it. We have\ngiven of our means, thus setting an example to others. We have\nencouraged economy and industry on the part of all connected with\nthe Institute and have urged that physicians and helpers work hard\nfor small pay until the institute should again be fully established\nin the confidence of our people. We have borne a plain testimony\nagainst the manifestation of selfishness in anyone connected with\nthe Institute and have counseled and reproved wrongs. We knew\nthat the Health Institute would not succeed unless the blessing of\nthe Lord rested upon it. If His blessing attended it, the friends of the\ncause would have confidence that it was the work of God and would\nfeel safe to donate means to make it a living enterprise, that it might\nbe able to accomplish the design of God.\nThe physicians and some of the helpers went to work earnestly.\nThey worked hard under great discouragements. Drs. Ginley, Cham-\nberlain, and Lamson worked with earnestness and energy, for small\npay, to build up this sinking institution. And, thank God, the original\n168 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ndebt has been removed, and large additions for the accommodation\nof patients have been made and paid for. The circulation of the\nHealth Reformer, which lies at the very foundation of the success\nof the Institute, has been doubled, and it has become a live journal.\nConfidence in the Institute has been fully restored in the minds of[176]\nmost of our people, and there have been as many patients at the\nInstitute, nearly the year round, as could well be accommodated and\nproperly treated by our physicians.\nIt is a matter of deep regret that the first managers of the Institute\nshould take a course to nearly overwhelm it in debt and discour-\nagement. But the financial losses which stockholders have felt and\nregretted have been small in comparison to the labor, perplexity,\nand care which my husband and I have borne without pay, and\nwhich physicians and helpers have borne for small wages. We have\ntaken stock in the Institute to the amount of fifteen hundred dollars,\nwhich is \u201cassigned,\u201d but which is a small consideration compared\nwith the wear we have suffered in consequence of former reckless\nmanagers. But as the Institute now stands higher in reputation and\npatronage than ever before, and as the property is worth more than\nall the money that has been invested, and as former errors have been\ncorrected, those who have lost their confidence have no excuse for\ncherishing feelings of prejudice. And if they still manifest a lack of\ninterest, it will be because they choose to cherish prejudice rather\nthan to be led by reason.\nIn the providence of God, Brother A has given his interest and\nenergies to the Health Institute. He has had an unselfish interest to\nadvance the interests of the Institute and has not spared or favored\nhimself. If he depends on God and makes Him his strength and\ncounselor he can be a blessing to physicians, helpers, and patients.\nHe has linked his interest to everything connected with the Institute\nand has been a blessing to others in cheerfully bearing burdens\nwhich were neither few nor light. He has blessed others, and these\nblessings will again be reflected upon him.\nBut Brother A is in danger of taking upon himself burdens which\nothers can and should bear. He should not wear himself out in\ndoing those things which others, whose time is less valuable, can\ndo. He should act as a director and superintendent. He should[177]\npreserve his strength, that with his experienced judgment he can\nHealth Institute 169\ndirect others what to do. This is necessary in order for him to\nmaintain a position of influence in the Institute. His experience in\nmanaging with wisdom and economy is valuable. But he is in danger\nof separating his interest too much from his family, of becoming\ntoo much absorbed in the Institute, and of taking too many burdens\nupon himself, as my husband has done. My husband\u2019s interest\nfor the Health Institute, the Publishing Association, and the cause\ngenerally was so great that he broke down and has been compelled\nto retire from the work for a time, when, had he done less for these\ninstitutions and divided his interest with his family, he would not\nhave had a constant strain in one direction, and would have preserved\nhis strength to continue his labors uninterruptedly. Brother A is\nthe man for the place. But he should not do as my husband has\ndone, even if matters are not in as prosperous a condition as if he\ndevoted his entire energies to them. God does not require either my\nhusband or Brother A to deprive himself of social family enjoyment,\nto divorce himself from home and family, even for the interest of\nthese important institutions.\nDuring the past three or four years several have had an interest\nfor the Health Institute and have made efforts to place it in a better\ncondition. But some have lacked discernment and experience. As\nlong as Brother A acts an unselfish part and clings to God, He will\nbe his helper and his counselor.\nThe physicians of the Health Institute should not feel compelled\nto do work that helpers can do. They should not serve in the bath-\nroom or in the movement room, expending their vitality in doing\nwhat others might do. There should be no lack of helpers to nurse\nthe sick and to watch with the feeble ones who need watchers. The\nphysicians should reserve their strength for the successful perfor-\nmance of their professional duties. They should tell others what to\ndo. If there is a want of those whom they can trust to do these things,\nsuitable persons should be employed and properly instructed, and [178]\nsuitably remunerated for their services.\nNone should be employed as laborers but those who will work\nunselfishly in the interest of the Institute, and such should be well\npaid for their services. There should be a sufficient force, especially\nduring the sickly season of summer, so that none need to overwork.\nThe Health Institute has overcome its embarrassments; and physi-\n170 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ncians and helpers should not be compelled to labor as hard, and\nsuffer such privations, as when it was so heavily embarrassed in\nconsequence of unfaithful men, who managed it almost into the\nground.\nI was shown that the physicians at our Institute should be men\nand women of faith and spirituality. They should make God their\ntrust. There are many who come to the Institute who have, by\ntheir own sinful indulgence, brought upon themselves disease of\nalmost every type. This class do not deserve the sympathy that they\nfrequently require. And it is painful to the physicians to devote time\nand strength to this class, who are debased physically, mentally, and\nmorally. But there is a class who have, through ignorance, lived in\nviolation of nature\u2019s laws. They have worked intemperately and have\neaten intemperately, because it was the custom to do so. Some have\nsuffered many things from many physicians, but have not been made\nbetter, but decidedly worse. At length they are torn from business,\nfrom society, and from their families; and as their last resort they\ncome to the Health Institute with some faint hope that they may find\nrelief. This class need sympathy. They should be treated with the\ngreatest tenderness, and care should be taken to make clear to their\nunderstanding the laws of their being, that they may, by ceasing\nto violate them, and by governing themselves, avoid suffering and\ndisease, the penalty of nature\u2019s violated law.\nDr. B is not the best adapted to fill a position as physician at\nthe Institute. He sees men and women ruined in constitution, who\nare weak in mental and moral power, and he thinks it time lost to\ntreat such cases. This may be so in many cases. But he should not[179]\nbecome discouraged and disgusted with sick and suffering patients.\nHe should not lose his pity, sympathy, and patience, and feel that\nhis life is poorly employed when doing for those who can never\nappreciate the labor they receive, and who will not use their strength,\nif they regain it, to bless society, but will pursue the same course\nof self-gratification that they did in losing health. Dr. B should not\nbecome weary or discouraged. He should remember Christ, who\ncame in direct contact with suffering humanity. Although, in many\ncases, the afflicted had brought disease upon themselves by their\nsinful course in violating natural law, Jesus pitied their weakness,\nand when they came to Him with disease the most loathsome, He\nHealth Institute 171\ndid not stand aloof for fear of contamination; He touched them and\nbade disease give back.\n\u201cAnd as He entered into a certain village, there met Him ten men\nthat were lepers, which stood afar off: and they lifted up their voices,\nand said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. And when He saw them,\nHe said unto them, Go show yourselves unto the priests. And it\ncame to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. And one of\nthem, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud\nvoice glorified God, and fell down on his face at His feet, giving\nHim thanks: and he was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering said,\nWere there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? There are not\nfound that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. And He\nsaid unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.\u201d\nHere is a lesson for us all. These lepers were so corrupted by\ndisease that they had been restricted from society lest they should\ncontaminate others. Their limits had been prescribed by the authori-\nties. Jesus comes within their sight, and in their great suffering they\ncry unto Him who alone has power to relieve them. Jesus bids them\nshow themselves to the priests. They have faith to start on their way,\nbelieving in the power of Christ to heal them. As they go on their\nway they realize that the horrible disease has left them. But only\none has feelings of gratitude, only one feels his deep indebtedness [180]\nto Christ for this great work wrought for him. This one returns prais-\ning God, and in the greatest humiliation falls at the feet of Christ,\nacknowledging with thankfulness the work wrought for him. And\nthis man was a stranger; the other nine were Jews.\nFor the sake of this one man, who would make a right use of the\nblessing of health, Jesus healed the whole ten. The nine passed on\nwithout appreciating the work done, and rendered no grateful thanks\nto Jesus for doing the work.\nThus will the physicians of the Health Institute have their efforts\ntreated. But if, in their labor to help suffering humanity, one out of\ntwenty makes a right use of the benefits received and appreciates\ntheir efforts in his behalf, the physicians should feel grateful and\nsatisfied. If one life out of ten is saved, and one soul out of one\nhundred is saved in the kingdom of God, all connected with the\nInstitute will be amply repaid for all their efforts. All their anxiety\nand care will not be wholly lost. If the King of glory, the Majesty of\n172 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nheaven, worked for suffering humanity, and so few appreciated His\ndivine aid, the physicians and helpers at the Institute should blush to\ncomplain if their feeble efforts are not appreciated by all and seem\nto be thrown away on some.\nI was shown that the nine who did not return to give glory to God\ncorrectly represent some Sabbathkeepers who come to the Health\nInstitute as patients. They receive much attention and should realize\nthe anxiety and discouragements of the physicians, and should be\nthe last to cause them unnecessary care and burdens. Yet I regret\nto say that frequently the patients who are most difficult to manage\nat the Health Institute are those of our faith. They are more free to\nmake complaints than are any other class. Worldlings, and professed\nChristians of other denominations, appreciate the efforts made for\ntheir recovery more than many Sabbathkeepers do. And when they\nreturn to their homes they exert an influence more in favor of the\nHealth Institute than do Sabbathkeepers. And some of those who[181]\nare so free to question, and to complain of the management at the\nInstitute, are those who have been treated at reduced prices.\nThis has been very discouraging to physicians and helpers; but\nthey should remember Christ, their great Pattern, and not become\nweary in well-doing. If one among a large number is grateful and\nexerts a right influence, they should thank God and take courage.\nThat one may be a stranger, and the inquiry may arise: Where are the\nnine? Why do not all Sabbathkeepers give their interest and support\nin favor of the Health Institute? Some Sabbathkeepers have so little\ninterest that, while receiving attention at the Institute free of charge,\nthey will speak disparagingly to patients of the means employed for\nthe recovery of the sick. I wish such to consider their course. The\nLord regards them as He did the nine lepers who returned not to give\nHim glory. Strangers do their duty and appreciate the efforts made\nfor their recovery, while these cast an influence against those who\nhave tried to do them good.\nDr. B needs to cultivate courtesy and kindness lest he shall un-\nnecessarily injure the feelings of the patients. He is frank and open-\nhearted, conscientious, sincere, and ardent. He has a good under-\nstanding of disease, but he should have a more thorough knowledge\nof how to treat the sick. With this knowledge he needs self-cul-\nHealth Institute 173\nture, refinement of manners, and to be more select in his words and\nillustrations in his parlor talks.\nDr. B is highly sensitive and naturally of a quick, impulsive\ntemper. He moves too much upon the spur of the moment. He\nhas made efforts to correct his hasty spirit and to overcome his\ndeficiencies, but he has a still greater effort to make. If he sees\nthings moving wrong he is in too great haste to tell the ones in error\nwhat he thinks, and he does not always use the most appropriate\nwords for the occasion. He sometimes so offends patients that they\nhate him and leave the Institute with hard feelings, to the detriment\nof both themselves and the Institute. It seldom does any good to\ntalk in a censuring manner to patients who are diseased in body and\nmind. But few who have moved in the society of the world, and who [182]\nview things from a worldling\u2019s standpoint, are prepared to have a\nstatement of facts in regard to themselves presented before them.\nThe truth even is not to be spoken at all times. There is a fit time and\nopportunity to speak when words will not offend. The physicians\nshould not be overworked and their nervous systems prostrated, for\nthis condition of body will not be favorable to calm minds, steady\nnerves, and a cheerful, happy spirit. Dr. B has been confined too\nsteadily to the Institute. He should have had change. He should\ngo out of Battle Creek occasionally and rest and visit, not always\nmaking professional visits, but visiting where he can be free and\nwhere his mind will not be anxious about the sick.\nThe privilege of getting away from the Health Institute should\noccasionally be accorded to all the physicians, especially to those\nwho bear burdens and responsibilities. If there is such a scarcity of\nhelp that this cannot be done, more help should be secured. To have\nphysicians overworked, and thus disqualified to perform the duties\nof their profession, is a thing to be dreaded. It should be prevented if\npossible, for its influence is against the interests of the Institute. The\nphysicians should keep well. They must not get sick by overlabor or\nby any imprudence on their part.\nI was shown that Dr. B is too easily discouraged. There will ever\nbe things arising to annoy, perplex, and try the patience of physicians\nand helpers. They must be prepared for this and not become excited\nor unbalanced. They must be calm and kind whatever may occur.\nThey are exerting an influence which will be reflected by the patients\n174 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nin other states and which will be reflected again upon the Health\nInstitute for good or for evil. They should ever consider that they\nare dealing with men and women of diseased minds, who frequently\nview things in a perverted light and yet are confident that they un-\nderstand matters perfectly. Physicians should understand that a soft\nanswer turneth away wrath. Policy must be used in an institution\nwhere the sick are treated, in order to successfully control diseased [183]\nminds and benefit the sick. If physicians can remain calm amid a\ntempest of inconsiderate, passionate words, if they can rule their\nown spirits when provoked and abused, they are indeed conquerors.\n\u201cHe that ruleth his spirit [is better] than he that taketh a city.\u201d To\nsubdue self, and bring the passions under the control of the will, is\nthe greatest conquest that men and women can achieve.\nDr. B is not blind to his peculiar temperament. He sees his\nfailings, and when he feels the pressure upon him he is disposed\nto beat a retreat and turn his back upon the battlefield. But he will\ngain nothing by pursuing this course. He is situated where his\nsurroundings and the pressure of circumstances are developing the\nstrong points in his character, points from which the roughness needs\nto be removed, that he may become refined and elevated. For him\nto flee from the contest will not remove the defects in his character.\nShould he run away from the Institute, he would not in so doing\nremove or overcome the defects in his character. He has a work\nbefore him to overcome these defects if he would be among the\nnumber who are to stand without fault before the throne of God,\nhaving come up through great tribulation, and having washed their\nrobes of character and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\nThe provision has been made for us to wash. The fountain has been\nprepared at infinite expense, and the burden of washing rests upon\nus, who are imperfect before God. The Lord does not propose to\nremove these spots of defilement without our doing anything on our\npart. We must wash our robes in the blood of the Lamb. We may lay\nhold of the merits of the blood of Christ by faith, and through His\ngrace and power we may have strength to overcome our errors, our\nsins, our imperfections of character, and come off victorious, having\nwashed our robes in the blood of the Lamb.\nDr. B should seek to add daily to his stock of knowledge and\nto cultivate courteousness and refinement of manners. In his parlor\nHealth Institute 175\ntalks he is too apt to come down to a low level; they do not have an\ninfluence to elevate. He should bear in mind that he is associated [184]\nwith all classes of minds and that the impressions he gives will\nbe extended to other states and will be reflected upon the Institute.\nTo deal with men and women whose minds as well as bodies are\ndiseased is a nice work. Great wisdom is needed by the physicians\nat the Institute in order to cure the body through the mind. But few\nrealize the power that the mind has over the body. A great deal of the\nsickness which afflicts humanity has its origin in the mind and can\nonly be cured by restoring the mind to health. There are very many\nmore than we imagine who are sick mentally. Heart sickness makes\nmany dyspeptics, for mental trouble has a paralyzing influence upon\nthe digestive organs.\nIn order to reach this class of patients, the physician must have\ndiscernment, patience, kindness, and love. A sore, sick heart, a\ndiscouraged mind, needs mild treatment, and it is through tender\nsympathy that this class of minds can be healed. The physicians\nshould first gain their confidence, and then point them to the all-\nhealing Physician. If their minds can be directed to the Burden\nBearer, and they can have faith that He will have an interest in them,\nthe cure of their diseased bodies and minds will be sure.\nOther health institutions are looking with a jealous eye upon\nthe Health Institute at Battle Creek. They work from the world\u2019s\nstandpoint, while the managers of the Health Institute work from a\nreligious standpoint, acknowledging God as their proprietor. They\ndo not labor selfishly for means alone, but for the sake of Christ\nand humanity. They are seeking to benefit suffering humanity, to\nheal the diseased mind as well as the suffering body, by directing\ninvalids to Christ, the sinner\u2019s Friend. They do not leave religion\nout of the question, but make God their trust and dependence. The\nsick are directed to Jesus. After the physicians have done what they\ncan in behalf of the sick, they ask God to work with their efforts and\nrestore the suffering invalids to health. This He has done in some\ncases in answer to the prayer of faith. And this He will continue to [185]\ndo if they are faithful and put their trust in Him. The Health Institute\nwill be a success, for God sustains it. And if His blessing attends\nthe Institute, it will prosper and will be the means of doing a great\namount of good. Other institutions are aware that a high standard of\n176 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nmoral and religious influence exists at our Institute. They see that its\nconductors are not actuated by selfish, worldly principles, and they\nare jealous in regard to its commanding and leading influence.\n* * * * *\nChapter 16\u2014Danger of Applause\nI have been shown that great caution should be used, even when\nit is necessary to lift a burden of oppression from men and women,\nlest they lean to their own wisdom and fail to make God their only\ndependence. It is not safe to speak in praise of persons or to exalt the\nability of a minister of Christ. In the day of God, very many will be\nweighed in the balance and found wanting because of exaltation. I\nwould warn my brethren and sisters never to flatter persons because\nof their ability, for they cannot bear it. Self is easily exalted, and, in\nconsequence, persons lose their balance. I say again to my brethren\nand sisters: If you would have your souls clean from the blood of\nall men, never flatter, never praise the efforts of poor mortals; for it\nmay prove their ruin. It is unsafe, by our words and actions, to exalt\na brother or sister, however apparently humble may be his or her\ndeportment. If they really possess the meek and lowly spirit which\nGod so highly esteems, help them to retain it. This will not be done\nby censuring them nor by neglecting to properly appreciate their true\nworth. But there are few who can bear praise without being injured.\nSome ministers of ability who are now preaching present truth,\nlove approbation. Applause stimulates them, as the glass of wine [186]\ndoes the inebriate. Place these ministers where they have a small\ncongregation which promises no special excitement and which pro-\nvokes no decided opposition, and they will lose their interest and\nzeal, and appear as languid in the work as the inebriate when he is\ndeprived of his dram. These men will fail to make real, practical\nlaborers until they learn to labor without the excitement of applause.\n* * * * *\n177\nChapter 17\u2014Labor for the Erring\nBrethren C and D failed in some respects in their management\nof church matters at Battle Creek. They moved too much in their\nown spirit and did not make God their whole dependence. They\nfailed of doing their duty by not leading the church to God, the\nFountain of living waters, at which they could supply their want and\nsatisfy their soul hunger. The renewing, sanctifying influence of\nthe Holy Spirit, which would give peace and hope to the troubled\nconscience, and restore health and happiness to the soul, was not\nmade of the highest importance. The good object they had in view\nwas not attained. These brethren had too much of a spirit of cold\ncriticism in the examination of individuals who presented themselves\nfor church membership. The spirit of weeping with those who weep\nand rejoicing with those who rejoice was not in the hearts of these\nministering brethren as it should have been.\nChrist identified Himself with the necessities of His people.\nTheir needs and their sufferings were His. He says: \u201cI was an\nhungered, and ye gave Me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink:\nI was a stranger, and ye took Me in: naked, and ye clothed Me: I\nwas sick, and ye visited Me: I was in prison, and ye came unto Me.\u201d\nGod\u2019s servants should have hearts of tender affection and sincere\nlove for the followers of Christ. They should manifest that deep\ninterest that Christ brings to view in the care of the shepherd for\nthe lost sheep; they should follow the example given by Christ and[187]\nexercise the same compassion and gentleness, and the same tender,\npitying love that He has exercised toward us.\nThe great moral powers of the soul are faith, hope, and love. If\nthese are inactive, a minister may be ever so earnest and zealous,\nbut his labor will not be accepted of God and cannot be productive\nof good to the church. A minister of Christ who bears the solemn\nmessage from God to the people should ever deal justly, love mercy,\nand walk humbly before God. The spirit of Christ in the heart will\nincline every power of the soul to nourish and protect the sheep of\n178\nLabor for the Erring 179\nHis pasture, like a faithful, true shepherd. Love is the golden chain\nwhich binds believing hearts to one another in willing bonds of\nfriendship, tenderness, and faithful constancy, and which binds the\nsoul to God. There is a decided lack of love, compassion, and pitying\ntenderness among brethren. The ministers of Christ are too cold and\nheartless. Their hearts are not all aglow with tender compassion and\nearnest love. The purest and most elevated devotion to God is that\nwhich is manifested in the most earnest desires and efforts to win\nsouls to Christ. The reason ministers who preach present truth are\nnot more successful is that they are deficient, greatly deficient, in\nfaith, hope, and love. There are toils and conflicts, self-denials and\nsecret heart trials, for us all to meet and bear. There will be sorrow\nand tears for our sins; there will be constant struggles and watchings,\nmingled with remorse and shame because of our deficiencies.\nLet not the ministers of the cross of our dear Saviour forget their\nexperience in these things; but let them ever bear in mind that they\nare but men, liable to err, and possessing like passions with their\nbrethren, and that if they help their brethren they must be persevering\nin their efforts to do them good, having their hearts filled with pity\nand love. They must come to the hearts of their brethren and help\nthem where they are weak and need help the most. Those who labor\nin word and doctrine should break their own hard, proud, unbelieving\nhearts if they would witness the same in their brethren. Christ has [188]\ndone all for us because we were helpless; we were bound in chains\nof darkness, sin, and despair, and could therefore do nothing for\nourselves. It is through the exercise of faith, hope, and love that\nwe come nearer and nearer to the standard of perfect holiness. Our\nbrethren feel the same pitying need of help that we have felt. We\nshould not burden them with unnecessary censure, but should let\nthe love of Christ constrain us to be very compassionate and tender,\nthat we can weep over the erring and those who have backslidden\nfrom God. The soul is of infinite value. Its worth can be estimated\nonly by the price paid to ransom it. Calvary! Calvary! Calvary! will\nexplain the true value of the soul.\n* * * * *\nChapter 18\u2014The Sabbath School\nVital godliness is a principle to be cultivated. The power of\nGod can accomplish for us that which all the systems in the world\ncannot effect. The perfection of Christian character depends wholly\nupon the grace and strength found alone in God. Without the power\nof grace upon the heart, assisting our efforts and sanctifying our\nlabors, we shall fail of saving our own souls and of saving the souls\nof others. System and order are highly essential, but none should\nreceive the impression that these will do the work without the grace\nand power of God operating upon the mind and heart. Heart and\nflesh would fail in the round of ceremonies, and in the carrying out\nof our plans, without the power of God to inspire and give courage\nto perform.\nThe Sabbath school at Battle Creek was made the one great\ntheme of interest with Brother E. It absorbed the minds of the young,\nwhile other religious duties were neglected. Frequently, after the\nSabbath school was closed, the superintendent, a number of the\nteachers, and quite a number of scholars would return home to rest.\nThey felt that their burden for the day was ended and that they had[189]\nno further duty. When the bell sounded forth the hour for public\nservice, and the people left their homes for the house of worship,\nthey would meet a large portion of the school passing to their homes.\nAnd however important the meeting, the interest of a large share of\nthe Sabbath school could not be awakened to take any pleasure in\nthe instruction given by the minister upon important Bible subjects.\nWhile many of the children did not attend public service, some that\nremained were not advantaged by the word spoken; for they felt that\nit was a wearisome tax.\nThere should be discipline and order in our Sabbath schools.\nChildren who attend these schools should prize the privileges they\nenjoy and should be required to observe the regulations of the school.\nAnd even greater care should be taken by the parents to see that their\nchildren have their Scripture lessons than is taken to see that their\n180\nSabbath School 181\nday school lessons are prepared. Their Scripture lessons should be\nlearned more perfectly than their lessons in the common schools.\nIf parents and children see no necessity for this interest, then the\nchildren might better remain at home; for the Sabbath school will\nfail to prove a blessing to them. Parents and children should work\nin harmony with superintendent and teachers, thus giving evidence\nthat they appreciate the labor put forth for them. Parents should take\nspecial interest in the religious education of their children, that they\nmay have a more thorough knowledge of the Scriptures.\nThere are many children who plead a lack of time as a reason\nwhy their Sabbath school lessons are not learned, but there are few\nwho could not find time to learn their lessons if they had an interest\nin them. Some devote time to amusement and sight-seeing; others\nto the needless trimming of their dresses for display, thus cultivating\npride and vanity. The precious hours thus prodigally spent are God\u2019s\ntime, for which they must render an account to Him. The hours spent\nin needless ornamentation or in amusements and idle conversation\nwill, with every work, be brought into judgment.\nChapter 19\u2014Laborers in the Office[190]\nThose in the office who profess to believe the truth should show\nthe power of the truth in their lives and prove that they are working\nonward and upward from the basis of principle. They should be\nmolding their lives and characters after the perfect Model. If all could\nlook with a discerning eye into the tremendous realities of eternity,\nwhat a horror of condemnation would seize some in the office who\nnow pass on with seeming indifference, although separated from\neternal scenes by a very small space. Many warnings have been\ngiven, and urged home with intense feeling and earnest prayers,\nevery one of which is faithfully registered in heaven, to balance the\naccount of each in the day of final investigation. The unwearying\nlove of Christ has followed those engaged in His work in the office.\nGod has followed them with blessings and entreaties, yet hating the\nsins and unfaithfulness that cling to them as the leprosy. The deep\nand solemn truths to which those in the office have had the privilege\nof listening should take hold upon their sympathies and lead them\nto a high appreciation of the light that God has given them. If they\nwill walk in the light, it will beautify and ennoble their lives with\nheaven\u2019s own adornment, purity and true goodness.\nA way is opened before everyone in the office to engage from the\nheart directly in the work of Christ and the salvation of souls. Christ\nleft heaven and the bosom of His Father to come to a friendless, lost\nworld to save those who would be saved. He exiled Himself from\nHis Father and exchanged the pure companionship of angels for that\nof fallen humanity, all polluted with sin. With grief and amazement,\nChrist witnesses the coldness, the indifference and neglect, with\nwhich His professed followers in the office treat the light and the\nmessages of warning and of love He has given them. Christ has\nprovided the bread and water of life for all who hunger and thirst.\nThe Lord requires all in the office to labor from high motives.[191]\nIn His own life, Christ has given them an example. All should\nlabor with interest, devotion, and faith for the salvation of souls. If\n182\nLaborers in the Office 183\nall in the office will labor with unselfish purposes, discerning the\nsacredness of the work, the blessing of God will rest upon them. If\nall had cheerfully and gladly taken up their several burdens, the wear\nand perplexity would not have come so heavily upon my husband.\nHow few earnest prayers have been sent up to God in faith for\nthose who worked in the office who were not fully in the truth! Who\nhas felt the worth of the soul for whom Christ died? Who have been\nlaborers in the vineyard of the Lord? I saw that angels were grieved\nwith the trifling frivolities of the professed followers of Christ who\nwere handling sacred things in the office. Some have no more sense\nof the sacredness of the work than if they were engaged in common\nlabor. God now calls for the fruitless cumberers of the ground to\nconsecrate themselves to Him and center their affections and hopes\nin Him.\nThe Lord would have all connected with the office become care-\ntakers and burden bearers. If they are pleasure seekers, if they do\nnot practice self-denial, they are not fit for a place in the office. The\nworkers at the office should feel when they enter it that it is a sacred\nplace, a place where the work of God is being done in the publication\nof a truth which will decide the destiny of souls. This is not felt\nor realized as it should be. There is conversation in the typesetting\ndepartment which diverts the mind from the work. The office is no\nplace for visiting, for a courting spirit, or for amusement or selfish-\nness. All should feel that they are doing work for God. He who sifts\nall motives and reads all hearts is proving, and trying, and sifting His\npeople, especially those who have light and knowledge, and who\nare engaged in His sacred work. God is a searcher of hearts and a\ntrier of the reins, and will accept nothing less than entire devotion to\nthe work and consecration to Himself. All in the office should take\nup their daily duties as if in the presence of God. They should not\nbe satisfied with doing just enough to pass along, and receive their [192]\nwages; but all should work in any place where they can help the\nmost. In Brother White\u2019s absence there are some faithful ones; there\nare others who are eyeservants. If all in the office who profess to\nbe followers of Christ had been faithful in the performance of duty\nin the office, there would have been a great change for the better.\nYoung men and young women have been too much engrossed in\n184 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\neach other\u2019s society, talking, jesting, and joking, and angels of God\nhave been driven from the office.\nMarcus Lichtenstein was a God-fearing youth; but he saw so\nlittle true religious principle in those in the church and those work-\ning in the office that he was perplexed, distressed, disgusted. He\nstumbled over the lack of conscientiousness in keeping the Sabbath\nmanifested by some who yet professed to be commandment keepers.\nMarcus had an exalted regard for the work in the office; but the\nvanity, the trifling, and the lack of principle stumbled him. God had\nraised him up and in His providence connected him with His work in\nthe office. But there is so little known of the mind and will of God by\nsome who work in the office that they looked upon this great work\nof the conversion of Marcus from Judaism as of no great importance.\nHis worth was not appreciated. He was frequently pained with the\ndeportment of F and of others in the office; and when he attempted to\nreprove them, his words were received with contempt that he should\nventure to instruct them. His defective language was an occasion of\njest and amusement with some.\nMarcus felt deeply over the case of F, but he could not see how\nhe could help him. Marcus never would have left the office if the\nyoung men had been true to their profession. If he makes shipwreck\nof faith, his blood will surely be found on the skirts of the young\nwho profess Christ, but who, by their works, their words, and their\ndeportment, state plainly that they are not of Christ, but of the world.\nThis deplorable state of neglect, of indifference and unfaithfulness,\nmust cease; a thorough and permanent change must take place in the\noffice, or those who have had so much light and so great privileges[193]\nshould be dismissed and others take their places, even if they be\nunbelievers. It is a fearful thing to be self-deceived. Said the angel,\npointing to those in the office: \u201cExcept your righteousness shall\nexceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no\ncase enter into the kingdom of heaven.\u201d A profession is not enough.\nThere must be a work inwrought in the soul and carried out in the\nlife.\nThe love of Christ reaches to the very depths of earthly misery\nand woe, or it would not meet the case of the veriest sinner. It also\nreaches to the throne of the Eternal, or man could not be lifted from\nhis degraded condition, and our necessities would not be met, our\nLaborers in the Office 185\ndesires would not be satisfied. Christ has led the way from earth to\nheaven. He forms the connecting link between the two worlds. He\nbrings the love and condescension of God to man, and brings man\nup through His merits to meet the reconciliation of God. Christ is\nthe way, the truth, and the life. It is hard work to follow on, step by\nstep, painfully and slowly, onward and upward, in the path of purity\nand holiness. But Christ has made ample provision to impart new\nvigor and divine strength at every advance step in the divine life.\nThis is the knowledge and experience that the hands in the office all\nwant, and must have, or they daily bring reproach upon the cause of\nChrist.\nBrother G is making a mistake in his life. He puts too high an\nestimate upon himself. He has not commenced to build in a right way\nto make a success of life. He is building at the top, but the foundation\nis not laid right. The foundation must be laid underground, and then\nthe building can go up. He needs a discipline and experience in\nthe everyday duties of life which the sciences will not give; all his\neducation will not give him physical exercise to become inured to\nthe hardships of life.\nFrom what has been shown me, there should be a careful selec-\ntion of help in the office. The young and untried and unconsecrated\nshould not be placed there, for they are exposed to temptations and [194]\nhave not fixed characters. Those who have formed their characters,\nwho have fixed principles, and who have the truth of God in the\nheart will not be a constant source of care and anxiety, but rather\nhelps and blessings. The office of publication is amply able to make\narrangements to secure good helpers, those who have ability and\nprinciple. And the church, in their turn, should not seek to advantage\nthemselves one penny from those who come to the office to labor\nand learn their trade. There are positions where some can earn better\nwages than at the office, but they can never find a position more\nimportant, more honorable, or more exalted than the work of God\nin the office. Those who labor faithfully and unselfishly will be\nrewarded. For them there is a crown of glory prepared, compared\nwith which all earthly honors and pleasures are as the small dust\nof the balance. Especially will those be blessed who have been\nfaithful to God in watching over the spiritual welfare of others in the\noffice. Pecuniary and temporal interests, in comparison with this,\n186 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nsink into insignificance. In one scale is gold dust; in the other, a\nhuman soul of such value that honor, riches, and glory have been\nsacrificed by the Son of God to ransom it from the bondage of sin\nand hopeless despair. The soul is of infinite value and demands the\nutmost attention. Every man who fears God in that office should\nput away childish and vain things, and, with true moral courage,\nstand erect in the dignity of his manhood, shunning low familiarity,\nyet binding heart to heart in the bond of Christian interest and love.\nHearts yearn for sympathy and love, and are as much refreshed and\nstrengthened by them as flowers are by showers and sunshine.\nThe Bible should be read every day. A life of religion, of de-\nvotion to God, is the best shield for the young who are exposed to\ntemptation in their associations while acquiring an education. The\nword of God will give the correct standard of right and wrong, and\nof moral principle. A fixed principle of truth is the only safeguard\nfor youth. Strong purposes and a resolute will close many an open[195]\ndoor to temptation and to influences that are unfavorable to the main-\ntenance of Christian character. A weak, irresolute spirit indulged\nin boyhood and youth will make a life of constant toil and struggle\nbecause decision and firm principle are wanting. Such will ever be\ntrammeled in making a success of this life, and they will be in danger\nof losing the better life. It will be safe to be earnest for the right. The\nfirst consideration should be to honor God, and the second, to be\nfaithful to humanity, performing the duties which each day brings,\nmeeting its trials and bearing its burdens with firmness and a resolute\nheart. Earnest and untiring effort, united with strong purpose and\nentire trust in God, will help in every emergency, will qualify for a\nuseful life in this world, and give a fitness for the immortal life.\n* * * * *\nChapter 20\u2014Love and Duty\nLove has a twin sister, which is duty. Love and duty stand side\nby side. Love exercised while duty is neglected will make children\nheadstrong, willful, perverse, selfish, and disobedient. If stern duty\nis left to stand alone without love to soften and win, it will have a\nsimilar result. Duty and love must be blended in order that children\nmay be properly disciplined.\nAnciently, directions were given to the priests:\u201d And they shall\nteach My people the difference between the holy and profane, and\ncause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. And in\ncontroversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it\naccording to My judgments.\u201d When I say unto the wicked, O wicked\nman, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked\nfrom his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood\nwill I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked\nof his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall\ndie in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.\u201d\nHere the duty of God\u2019s servants is made plain. They cannot [196]\nbe excused from the faithful discharge of their duty to reprove sins\nand wrongs in the people of God, although it may be a disagreeable\ntask and may not be received by the one who is at fault. But in\nmost cases the one reproved would accept the warning and heed\nreproof were it not that others stand in the way. They come in\nas sympathizers and pity the one reproved and feel that they must\nstand in his defense. They do not see that the Lord is displeased\nwith the wrongdoer, because the cause of God has been wounded\nand His name reproached. Souls have been turned aside from the\ntruth and have made shipwreck of faith as the result of the wrong\ncourse pursued by the one in fault; but the servant of God whose\ndiscernment is clouded and whose judgment is swayed by wrong\ninfluences would as soon take his position with the offender whose\ninfluence has done much harm, as with the reprover of wrong and\nof sin, and in so doing he virtually says to the sinner: \u201cDo not be\n187\n188 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ntroubled, do not be cast down; you are about right after all.\u201d These\nsay to the sinner:\u201d It shall be well with thee.\u201d\nGod requires His servants to walk in the light and not cover their\neyes that they may not discern the working of Satan. They should be\nprepared to warn and reprove those who are in danger through his\nsubtlety. Satan is working on the right hand and on the left to obtain\nvantage ground. He rests not. He is persevering. He is vigilant\nand crafty to take advantage of every circumstance and turn it to\nhis account in his warfare against the truth and the interests of the\nkingdom of God. It is a lamentable fact that God\u2019s servants are not\nhalf as much awake to the wiles of Satan as they should be. And\ninstead of resisting the devil that he may flee from them, many are\ninclined to make a compromise with the powers of darkness.\nChapter 21\u2014The Battle Creek Church [197]\nThere are serious objections to having the school located at\nBattle Creek. The church is large, and there are quite a number of\nyouth connected with it. If the influence which one member has over\nanother in so large a church were of an elevating character, leading\nto purity and consecration to God, then the youth coming to Battle\nCreek would have greater advantages than if the school were located\nelsewhere. But if the influences at Battle Creek shall be in the future\nwhat they have been for several years past, I would warn parents\nto keep their children from Battle Creek. There are but few in that\nlarge church who have an influence that will steadily draw souls to\nChrist; while there are many who will, by their example, lead the\nyouth away from God to the love of the world.\nWith many of the church at Battle Creek there is a great lack\nof feeling their responsibility. Those who have practical religion\nwill retain their identity of character under any circumstances. They\nwill not be like the reed trembling in the wind. Those situated at a\ndistance feel that they would be highly favored could they have the\nprivilege of living in Battle Creek, among a strong church, where\ntheir children could be benefited by the Sabbath school and meetings.\nSome of our brethren and sisters in times past have made sacrifices\nto have their children live there. But they have been disappointed\nin almost every case. There were but few in the church to manifest\nan unselfish interest for these youth. The church generally stood\nas pharisaical strangers, aloof from those who needed their help\nthe most. Some of the youth connected with the church, who were\nprofessedly serving God, but loving pleasure and the world more,\nwere ready to make the acquaintance of youthful strangers who came\namong them, and to exert a strong influence over them to lead them\nto the world instead of nearer to God. When these return home, they\nare further from the truth than when they came to Battle Creek.\nMen and women are wanted at the heart of the work who will be [198]\nnursing fathers and mothers in Israel, who will have hearts that can\n189\n190 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ntake in more than merely me and mine. They should have hearts that\nwill glow with love for the dear youth, whether they are members of\ntheir own families or children of their neighbors. They are members\nof God\u2019s great family, for whom Christ had so great an interest that\nHe made every sacrifice that it was possible for Him to make to save\nthem. He left His glory, His majesty, His kingly throne and robes\nof royalty, and became poor, that through His poverty the children\nof men might be made rich. He finally poured out His soul unto\ndeath that He might save the race from hopeless misery. This is\nthe example of disinterested benevolence that Christ has given us to\npattern after.\nIn the special providence of God many youth and also those\nof mature age have been thrown into the arms of the Battle Creek\nchurch for them to bless with the great light God has given them,\nand that, through their disinterested efforts, they might have the\nprecious privilege of bringing them to Christ and to the truth. Christ\ncommissions His angels to minister unto those who are brought\nunder the influence of the truth, to soften their hearts and make them\nsusceptible of the influences of His truth. While God and His angels\nare doing their work, those who profess to be followers of Christ\nseem to be coolly indifferent. They do not work in unison with\nChrist and holy angels. Although they profess to be servants of God\nthey are serving their own interest and loving their own pleasure,\nand souls are perishing around them. These souls can truly say: \u201cNo\nman careth for my soul.\u201d The church have neglected to improve the\nprivileges and blessings within their reach, and through their neglect\nof duty have lost golden opportunities of winning souls to Christ.\nUnbelievers have lived among them for months, and they have\nmade no special efforts to save them. How can the Master regard\nsuch servants? The unbelieving would have responded to efforts\nmade in their behalf if the brethren and sisters had lived up to their\nexalted profession. If they had been seeking an opportunity to work[199]\nfor the interest of their Master, to advance His cause, they would\nhave manifested kindness and love for them, they would have sought\nopportunities to pray with and for them, and would have felt a solemn\nresponsibility resting upon them to show their faith by their works,\nby precept and example. Through their instrumentality these souls\nmight have been saved to be as stars in the crown of their rejoicing.\nBattle Creek Church 191\nBut, in many cases, the golden opportunity has passed never to\nreturn. The souls that were in the valley of decision have taken\ntheir position in the ranks of the enemy and become enemies of God\nand the truth. And the record of the unfaithfulness of the professed\nfollowers of Jesus has gone up to heaven.\nI was shown that if the youth at Battle Creek were true to their\nprofession, they might exert a strong influence for good over their\nfellow youth. But a large share of the youth at Battle Creek need a\nChristian experience. They know not God by experimental knowl-\nedge. They have not individually a personal experience in the Chris-\ntian life, and they must perish with the unbelieving unless they obtain\nthis experience. The youth of this class follow inclination rather\nthan duty. Some do not seek to be governed by principle. They do\nnot agonize to enter in at the strait gate, trembling with fear lest they\nwill not be able. They are confident, boastful, proud, disobedient,\nunthankful, and unholy. Just such a class as this lead souls in the\nbroad road to ruin. If Christ is not in them, they cannot exemplify\nHim in their lives and characters.\nThe church at Battle Creek have had great light. As a people\nthey have been peculiarly favored of God. They have not been left\nin ignorance in regard to the will of God concerning them. They\nmight be far in advance of what they now are, if they had walked\nin the light. They are not that separate, peculiar, and holy people\nthat their faith demands, and that God recognizes and acknowledges\nas children of the light. They are not as obedient and devotional as\ntheir exalted position and sacred obligation as children walking in\nthe light require them to be. The most solemn message of mercy\never given to the world has been entrusted to them. The Lord has [200]\nmade that church the depositaries of His commandments in a sense\nthat no other church is. God did not show them His special favor in\ntrusting to them His sacred truth that they alone might be benefited\nby the light given, but that the light reflected upon them from heaven\nshould shine forth to others and be reflected again to God by those\nwho receive the truth glorifying Him. Many in Battle Creek will\nhave a fearful account to give in the day of God for this sinful neglect\nof duty.\nMany of those who profess to believe the truth in Battle Creek\ncontradict their faith by their works. They are as unbelieving, and\n192 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nas far from fulfilling the requirements of God and from coming up\nto their profession of faith, as was the Jewish church at the time of\nChrist\u2019s first advent. Should Christ make His appearance among\nthem, reproving and rebuking selfishness, pride, and love of the\nfriendship of the world, as He did at His first advent, but few would\nrecognize Him as the Lord of glory. The picture He would present\nbefore them of their neglect of duty they would not receive, but would\ntell Him to His face: \u201cYou are entirely mistaken; we have done this\ngood and great thing, and performed this and that wonderful work,\nand we are entitled to be highly exalted for our good works.\u201d\nThe Jews did not go into darkness all at once. It was a gradual\nwork, until they could not discern the gift of God in sending His\nSon. The church at Battle Creek have had superior advantages,\nand they will be judged by the light and privileges they have had.\nTheir deficiencies, their unbelief, their hardness of heart, and their\nneglect to cherish and follow the light are not less than those of the\nfavored Jews, who refused the blessings they might have accepted,\nand crucified the Son of God. The Jews are now an astonishment\nand reproach to the world.\nThe church at Battle Creek are like Capernaum, which Christ\nrepresents as being exalted unto heaven by the light and privileges\nthat had been given them. If the light and privileges with which\nthey had been blessed had been given to Sodom and Gomorrah, they[201]\nmight have stood unto this day. If the light and knowledge which the\nchurch in Battle Creek have received had been given the nations who\nsit in darkness, they might have been far in advance of that church.\nThe Laodicean church really believed, and enjoyed the blessings\nof the gospel, and thought they were rich in the favor of God, when\nthe True Witness called them poor, naked, blind, and miserable. This\nis the case with the church at Battle Creek and with a large share of\nthose who profess to be God\u2019s commandment-keeping people. The\nLord seeth not as man seeth. His thoughts and ways are not as our\nways.\nThe words and law of God, written in the soul, and exhibited\nin a consecrated, holy life, have a powerful influence to convict the\nworld. Covetousness, which is idolatry, and envy, and love of the\nworld, will be rooted from the hearts of those who are obedient to\nChrist, and it will be their pleasure to deal justly, to love mercy,\nBattle Creek Church 193\nand to walk humbly before God. Oh, how much is comprised in\nthis, walking humbly before God! The law of God, if written in the\nheart, will bring the mind and will into subjection to the obedience\nof Christ.\nOur faith is peculiar. Many who profess to be living under\nthe sound of the last message of mercy are not separated in their\naffections from the world. They bow down before the friendship of\nthe world and sacrifice light and principle to secure its favor. The\napostle describes the favored people of God in these words: \u201cBut\nye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a\npeculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who\nhath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.\u201d\nChapter 22\u2014Missionary Work[202]\nDecember 10, 1871, I was shown that God would accomplish a\ngreat work through the truth if devoted, self-sacrificing men would\ngive themselves unreservedly to the work of presenting it to those\nin darkness. Those who have a knowledge of the precious truth\nand who are consecrated to God should avail themselves of every\nopportunity where there is an opening to press in the truth. Angels\nof God are moving on the hearts and consciences of the people of\nother nations, and honest souls are troubled as they witness the signs\nof the times in the unsettled state of the nations. The inquiry arises\nin their hearts: What will be the end of all these things? While\nGod and angels are at work to impress hearts, the servants of Christ\nseem to be asleep. But few are working in unison with the heavenly\nmessengers. All men and women who are Christians in every sense\nof the word should be workers in the vineyard of the Lord. They\nshould be wide-awake, zealously laboring for the salvation of their\nfellow men, and should imitate the example that the Saviour of the\nworld has given them in His life of self-denial, sacrifice, and faithful,\nearnest labor.\nThere has been but little of the missionary spirit among Sab-\nbathkeeping Adventists. If ministers and people were sufficiently\naroused, they would not rest thus indifferently while God has hon-\nored them by making them the depositaries of His law by printing it\nin their minds and writing it upon their hearts. These truths of vital\nimportance are to test the world; and yet in our own country there\nare cities, villages, and towns that have never heard the warning\nmessage. Young men who feel stirred by the appeals that have been\nmade for help in this great work of advancing the cause of God make\nsome advance moves, but do not get the burden of the work upon\nthem sufficiently to accomplish what they might. They are willing\nto do a small work which does not require special effort. Therefore\nthey do not learn to place their whole dependence upon God and by[203]\n194\nMissionary Work 195\nliving faith draw from the great Fountain and Source of light and\nstrength in order that their efforts may prove wholly successful.\nThose who think that they have a work to do for the Master\nshould not commence their efforts among the churches; they should\ngo out into new fields and prove their gifts. In this way they can test\nthemselves and settle the matter to their own satisfaction, whether\nGod has indeed chosen them for this work. They will feel the\nnecessity of studying the word of God and praying earnestly for\nheavenly wisdom and divine aid. By meeting with opponents who\nbring up objections to the important points of our faith, they will be\nbrought where they will obtain a most valuable experience. They will\nfeel their weakness and be driven to the word of God and to prayer.\nIn this exercise of their gifts they will be learning and improving,\nand gaining confidence, courage, and faith, and will eventually have\na valuable experience.\nThe Brethren H commenced right in this work. In their labor\nthey did not go among the churches, but went out into new fields.\nThey commenced humble. They were little in their own eyes and\nfelt the necessity of their whole dependence being in God. These\nbrothers, especially A H, are now in great danger of becoming self-\nsufficient. When he has discussed with opponents, the truth has\nobtained the victory, and he has begun to feel strong in himself. As\nsoon as he gets above the simplicity of the work, his labors will\nnot benefit the precious cause of God. He should not encourage a\nlove for discussions, but should avoid them whenever he can. These\ncontests with the powers of darkness in debate seldom result the best\nfor the advancement of present truth.\nIf young men who commence to labor in this cause would have\nthe missionary spirit, they would give evidence that God has indeed\ncalled them to the work. But when they do not go out into new places,\nbut are content to go from church to church, they give evidence that\nthe burden of the work is not upon them. The ideas of our young\npreachers are not broad enough. Their zeal is too feeble. Were the [204]\nyoung men awake and devoted to the Lord, they would be diligent\nevery moment of their time and would seek to qualify themselves\nto become laborers in the missionary field rather than to become\ncombatants.\n196 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nYoung men should be qualifying themselves by becoming fa-\nmiliar with other languages, that God may use them as mediums\nto communicate His saving truth to those of other nations. These\nyoung men may obtain a knowledge of other languages even while\nengaged in laboring for sinners. If they are economical of their\ntime they can be improving their minds and qualifying themselves\nfor more extended usefulness. If young women who have borne\nbut little responsibility would devote themselves to God, they could\nqualify themselves for usefulness by studying and becoming familiar\nwith other languages. They could devote themselves to the work of\ntranslating.\nOur publications should be printed in other languages, that for-\neign nations may be reached. Much can be done through the medium\nof the press, but still more can be accomplished if the influence of\nthe labors of the living preacher goes with our publications. Mis-\nsionaries are needed to go to other nations to preach the truth in a\nguarded, careful manner. The cause of present truth can be greatly\nextended by personal effort. The contact of individual mind with\nindividual mind will do more to remove prejudice, if the labor is\ndiscreet, than our publications alone can do. Those who engage in\nthis work should not consult their ease or inclination; neither should\nthey have love for popularity or display.\nWhen the churches see young men possessing zeal to qualify\nthemselves to extend their labors to cities, villages, and towns that\nhave never been aroused to the truth, and missionaries volunteering\nto go to other nations to carry the truth to them, the churches will be\nencouraged and strengthened far more than to themselves receive\nthe labors of inexperienced young men. As they see their ministers\u2019\nhearts all aglow with love and zeal for the truth, and with a desire\nto save souls, the churches will arouse themselves. These generally[205]\nhave the gifts and power within themselves to bless and strengthen\nthemselves, and to gather the sheep and lambs into the fold. They\nneed to be thrown upon their own resources, that all the gifts that\nare lying dormant may thus be called into active service.\nAs churches are established, it should be set before them that\nit is even from among them that men must be taken to carry the\ntruth to others and raise new churches; therefore they must all work,\nand cultivate to the utmost the talents that God has given them, and\nMissionary Work 197\nbe training their minds to engage in the service of their Master. If\nthese messengers are pure in heart and life, if their example is what\nit should be, their labors will be highly successful; for they have a\nmost powerful truth, one that is clear and connected, and that has\nconvincing arguments in its favor. They have God on their side and\nthe angels of God to work with their efforts.\nThe reason there has been so little accomplished by those who\npreach the truth is not wholly because the truth they bear is unpopu-\nlar, but because the men who bear the message are not sanctified by\nthe truths they preach. The Saviour withdraws His smiles, and the\ninspiration of His Spirit is not upon them. The presence and power\nof God to convict the sinner and cleanse from all unrighteousness is\nnot manifest. Sudden destruction is right upon the people, and yet\nthey are not fearfully alarmed. Unconsecrated ministers make the\nwork very hard for those who follow after them and who have the\nburden and spirit of the work upon them.\nThe Lord has moved upon men of other tongues and has brought\nthem under the influence of the truth, that they might be qualified to\nlabor in His cause. He has brought them within reach of the office\nof publication, that its managers might avail themselves of their\nservices if they were awake to the wants of the cause. Publications\nare needed in other languages to raise an interest and the spirit of\ninquiry among other nations.\nIn a most remarkable manner the Lord wrought upon the heart\nof Marcus Lichtenstein and directed the course of this young man [206]\nto Battle Creek, that he might there be brought under the influence\nof the truth and be converted; that he might obtain an experience\nand be united to the office of publication. His education in the\nJewish religion would have qualified him to prepare publications.\nHis knowledge of Hebrew would have been a help to the office\nin the preparation of publications through which access could be\ngained to a class that otherwise could not be reached. It was no\ninferior gift that God gave to the office in Marcus. His deportment\nand conscientiousness were in accordance with the principles of the\nwonderful truths he was beginning to see and appreciate.\nBut the influence of some in the office grieved and discouraged\nMarcus. Those young men who did not esteem him as he deserved,\nand whose Christian life was a contradiction to their profession, were\n198 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthe means that Satan used to separate from the office the gift which\nGod had given to it. He went away perplexed, grieved, discouraged.\nThose who had had years of experience, and who should have had\nthe love of Christ in their hearts, were so far separated from God by\nselfishness, pride, and their own folly that they could not discern the\nspecial work of God in connecting Marcus with the office.\nIf those who are connected with the office had been awake and\nnot spiritually paralyzed, Brother I would long ago have been con-\nnected with the office and might now be prepared to do a good work\nwhich much needs to be done. He should have been engaged in\nteaching young men and women, that they might now be qualified\nto become workers in missionary fields.\nThose engaged in the work have been about two thirds dead\nbecause of yielding to wrong influences. They have been where God\ncould not impress them by His Holy Spirit. And, oh, how my heart\naches as I see that so much time has passed, and that the great work\nthat might have been done is left undone because those in important\npositions have not walked in the light! Satan has stood prepared\nto sympathize with the men in holy office and to tell them that[207]\nGod does not require of them as much zeal and unselfish, devoted\ninterest as Brother White expects; and they settle down carelessly in\nSatan\u2019s easy chair, and the ever-vigilant, persevering foe binds them\nin chains of darkness while they think that they are all right. Satan\nworks on their right hand and on their left, and all around them; and\nthey know it not. They call darkness light, and light darkness.\nIf those in the office of publication are indeed engaged in the\nsacred work of giving the last solemn message of warning to the\nworld, how careful should they be to carry out in their lives the\nprinciples of the truth they are handling. They should have pure\nhearts and clean hands.\nOur people connected with the office have not been awake to im-\nprove the privileges within their reach and to secure all the talent and\ninfluence that God has provided for them. With nearly all connected\nwith the office there is a very great failure to realize the importance\nand sacredness of the work. Pride and selfishness exist to a very\ngreat degree, and angels of God are not attracted to the office as they\nwould be if hearts there were pure and in communion with God.\nThose laboring in the office have not had a vivid sense that the truths\nMissionary Work 199\nthat they were handling were of heavenly origin, designed to accom-\nplish a certain and special work, as did the preaching of Noah before\nthe Flood. As the preaching of Noah warned, tested, and proved the\ninhabitants of the world before the flood of waters destroyed them\nfrom off the face of the earth, so the truth of God for these last days\nis doing a similar work of warning, testing, and proving the world.\nThe publications which go forth from the office bear the signet of\nthe Eternal. They are being scattered all through the land and are\ndeciding the destiny of souls. Men are now greatly needed who can\ntranslate and prepare our publications in other languages so that the\nmessage of warning may go to all nations and test them by the light\nof the truth, that men and women, as they see the light, may turn [208]\nfrom transgression to obedience of the law of God.\nEvery opportunity should be improved to extend the truth to\nother nations. This will be attended with considerable expense, but\nexpense should in no case hinder the performance of this work.\nMeans are of value only as they are used to advance the interest of\nthe kingdom of God. The Lord has lent men means for this very\npurpose, to use in sending the truth to their fellow men. There\nis a great amount of surplus means in the ranks of Seventh-day\nAdventists. And the selfish withholding of it from the cause of God\nis blinding their eyes to the importance of the work of God, making\nit impossible for them to discern the solemnity of the times in which\nwe live, or the value of eternal riches. They do not view Calvary in\nthe right light, and therefore cannot appreciate the worth of the soul\nfor which Christ paid such an infinite price.\nMen will invest means in that which they value the most and\nwhich they think will bring them the greatest profits. When men\nwill run great risks and invest much in worldly enterprises, but are\nunwilling to venture or invest much in the cause of God to send the\ntruth to their fellow men, they evidence that they value their earthly\ntreasure just as much more highly than the heavenly as their works\nshow.\nIf men would lay their earthly treasure upon the altar of God, and\nwould work as zealously to secure the heavenly treasure as they did\nto gain the earthly, they would invest means cheerfully and gladly\nwherever they could see an opportunity to do good and aid the cause\nof their Master. Christ has given them unmistakable evidence of\n200 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nHis love and fidelity to them, and has entrusted them with means to\ntest and prove their fidelity to Him. He left heaven, His riches and\nglory, and for their sakes became poor, that they through His poverty\nmight be made rich. After thus condescending to save man, Christ\nrequires no less of him than that he should deny himself and use the\nmeans He has lent him in saving his fellow men, and by so doing\ngive evidence of his love for his Redeemer and show that he values\nthe salvation brought to him by such an infinite sacrifice.\nNow is the time to use means for God. Now is the time to be rich[209]\nin good works, laying up in store for ourselves a good foundation\nagainst the time to come, that we may lay hold on eternal life.\nOne soul saved in the kingdom of God is of more value than all\nearthly riches. We are answerable to God for the souls of those with\nwhom we are brought in contact, and the closer our connections\nwith our fellow men the greater our responsibility. We are one great\nbrotherhood, and the welfare of our fellow men should be our great\ninterest. We have not one moment to lose. If we have been careless\nin this matter, it is high time we were now in earnest to redeem the\ntime, lest the blood of souls be found on our garments. As children\nof God, none of us are excused from taking a part in the great work\nof Christ in the salvation of our fellow men.\nIt will be a difficult work to overcome prejudice and to convince\nthe unbelieving that our efforts to help them are disinterested. But\nthis should not hinder our labor. There is no precept in the word\nof God that tells us to do good to those only who appreciate and\nrespond to our efforts, and to benefit those only who will thank us\nfor it. God has sent us to work in His vineyard. It is our business\nto do all we can. \u201cIn the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening\nwithhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper,\neither this or that.\u201d We have too little faith. We limit the Holy One\nof Israel. We should be grateful that God condescends to use any of\nus as His instruments. For every earnest prayer put up in faith for\nanything, answers will be returned. They may not come just as we\nhave expected; but they will come, not perhaps as we have devised,\nbut at the very time when we most need them. But, oh, how sinful\nis our unbelief! \u201cIf ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye\nshall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\u201d\nMissionary Work 201\nYoung men who are engaged in this work should not trust too\nmuch to their own abilities. They are inexperienced and should seek\nto learn wisdom from those who have had long experience in the\nwork and who have had opportunities to study character.\nInstead of our ministering brethren laboring among the churches, [210]\nGod designs that we should spread abroad and our missionary labor\nbe extended over as much ground as we can possibly occupy to\nadvantage, going in every direction to raise up new companies. We\nshould ever leave upon the minds of new disciples an impression\nof the importance of our mission. As able men are converted to\nthe truth, they should not require laborers to keep their flagging\nfaith alive; but these men should be impressed with the necessity\nof laboring in the vineyard. As long as churches rely upon laborers\nfrom abroad to strengthen and encourage their faith, they will not\nbecome strong in themselves. They should be instructed that their\nstrength will increase in proportion to their personal efforts. The\nmore closely the New Testament plan is followed in missionary\nlabor, the more successful will be the efforts put forth.\nWe should work as did our divine Teacher, sowing the seeds of\ntruth with care, anxiety, and self-denial. We must have the mind of\nChrist if we would not become weary in well-doing. His was a life\nof continual sacrifice for others\u2019 good. We must follow His example.\nWe must sow the seed of truth and trust in God to quicken it to life.\nThe precious seed may lie dormant for some time, when the grace\nof God may convict the heart and the seed sown be awakened to\nlife and spring up and bear fruit to the glory of God. Missionaries\nin this great work are wanted to labor unselfishly, earnestly, and\nperseveringly as co-workers with Christ and the heavenly angels in\nthe salvation of their fellow men.\nEspecially should our ministers beware of indolence and pride,\nwhich are apt to grow out of a consciousness that we have the truth\nand strong arguments which our opponents cannot meet; and while\nthe truths which we handle are mighty to the pulling down of the\nstrongholds of the powers of darkness, there is danger of neglecting\npersonal piety, purity of heart, and entire consecration to God. There\nis danger of their feeling that they are rich and increased with goods,\nwhile they lack the essential qualifications of Christians. They may\nbe wretched, poor, blind, miserable, and naked. They do not feel the [211]\n202 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nnecessity of living in obedience to Christ every day and every hour.\nSpiritual pride eats out the vitals of religion. In order to preserve\nhumility, it would be well to remember how we appear in the sight of\na holy God, who reads every secret of the soul, and how we should\nappear in the sight of our fellow men if they all knew us as well as\nGod knows us. For this reason, to humble us, we are directed to\nconfess our faults, and improve this opportunity to subdue our pride.\nMinisters should not neglect physical exercise. They should\nseek to make themselves useful and to be a help where they are\ndependent upon the hospitalities of others. They should not allow\nothers to wait upon them, but should rather lighten the burdens of\nthose who, having so great a respect for the gospel ministry, would\nput themselves to great inconvenience to do for them that which they\nshould do for themselves. The poor health of some of our ministers\nis because of their neglect of physical exercise in useful labor.\nAs the matter has resulted, I was shown that it would have been\nbetter had the Brethren J done what they could in the preparation\nof tracts to be circulated among the French. If these works were\nnot prepared in all their perfection, they might better have been\ncirculated, that the French people might have had an opportunity\nto search the evidences of our faith. There are great risks in delay.\nThe French should have had books setting forth the reasons of our\nfaith. The Brethren J were not prepared to do justice to these works,\nfor they needed to be spiritualized and enlivened themselves or the\nbooks prepared would bear the stamp of their minds. They needed\nto be corrected, lest their preaching and writing should be tedious.\nThey needed to educate themselves to come at once to the point and\nmake the essential features of our faith stand forth clearly before the\npeople. The work has been hindered by Satan, and much has been\nlost because these works were not prepared when they should have\nbeen. These brethren can do much good if they are fully devoted to\nthe work and if they will follow the light that God has given them.\nChapter 23\u2014Effect of Discussions [212]\nDecember 10, 1871, I was shown the dangers of Brother K. His\ninfluence upon the cause of God is not what it should be or what it\nmight be. He seems to be in blindness as to the result of his course;\nhe does not discern what kind of wake he leaves behind him. He\ndoes not labor in a manner that God can accept. I saw that he was in\nas great peril as was Moses Hull before he left the truth. He trusted\nin himself. He thought he was of so great value to the cause of\ntruth that the cause could not spare him. Brother K has felt very\nmuch the same. He relies too much on his own strength and wisdom.\nIf he could see his weakness as God sees it he would never flatter\nhimself or feel in the least to triumph. And unless he makes God his\ndependence and strength he will make shipwreck of faith as surely\nas did Moses Hull.\nHe does not in his labors draw strength from God. He depends\nupon an excitement to arouse his ambition. In laboring with a\nfew, where there is no special excitement to stimulate, he loses\nhis courage. When the labor goes hard and he is not borne up by\nthis special excitement, he does not then cling the firmer to God\nand become more earnest to press through the darkness and gain\nthe victory. Brother K, you frequently become childish, weak, and\ninefficient at the very time when you should be strongest. This\nshould evidence to you that your zeal and animation are not always\nfrom the right source.\nI was shown that here is the danger of young ministers who\nengage in discussion. They turn their minds to the study of the word\nto gather the sharp things, and they become sarcastic and, in their\nefforts to meet an opponent, too frequently leave God out of the\nquestion. The excitement of debate lessens their interest in meetings\nwhere this special excitement does not exist. Those who engage in\ndebates are not the most successful laborers and the best adapted to\nbuild up the cause. By some, discussion is coveted, and they prefer\nthis kind of labor above any other. They do not study the Bible with\n203\n204 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nhumility of mind, that they may know how to attain the love of God;[213]\nas Paul says: \u201cThat Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye,\nbeing rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with\nall saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and\nto know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might\nbe filled with all the fullness of God.\u201d\nYoung preachers should avoid discussions, for they do not in-\ncrease spirituality or humbleness of mind. In some cases it may be\nnecessary to meet a proud boaster against the truth of God in open\ndebate; but generally these discussions, either oral or written, result\nin more harm than good. After a discussion the greater responsibility\nrests upon the minister to keep up the interest. He should beware of\nthe reaction which is liable to take place after a religious excitement,\nand not yield to discouragement himself.\nMen who will not admit the claims of God\u2019s law, which are so\nvery plain, will generally take a lawless course; for they have so\nlong taken sides with the great rebel in warring against the law of\nGod, which is the foundation of His government in heaven and earth,\nthat they are trained in this labor. In their warfare they will not open\ntheir eyes or consciences to light. They close their eyes, lest they\nshall become enlightened. Their case is as hopeless as was that of\nthe Jews who would not see the light which Christ brought to them.\nThe wonderful evidences which He gave them of His Messiahship\nin the miracles that He performed, in healing the sick, raising the\ndead, and doing the works which no other man had done or could do,\ninstead of melting and subduing their hearts, and overcoming their\nwicked prejudices, inspired them with satanic hatred and fury such\nas Satan possessed when he was thrust out of heaven. The greater\nlight and evidence they had, the greater was their hatred. They were\ndetermined to extinguish the light by putting Christ to death.\nThe haters of God\u2019s law, which is the foundation of His gov-\nernment in heaven and earth, occupy the same ground as did the\nunbelieving Jews. Their defiant power will follow those who keep[214]\nthe commandments of God, and any amount of light will be rejected\nby them. Their consciences have so long been violated, and their\nhearts have grown so hard by their choosing darkness rather than\nlight, that they feel that it is a virtue in them, in order to gain their\nobject, to bear false witness or stoop to almost any course of equivo-\nEffect of Discussions 205\ncation or deception, as did the Jews in their rejection of Christ. They\nreason that the end justifies the means. They virtually crucify the\nlaw of the Father, as the Jews crucified Christ.\nOur work should be to embrace every opportunity to present\nthe truth in its purity and simplicity where there is any desire or\ninterest to hear the reasons of our faith. Those who have dwelt\nmostly upon the prophecies and the theoretical points of our faith\nshould without delay become Bible students upon practical subjects.\nThey should take a deeper draft at the fountain of divine truth. They\nshould carefully study the life of Christ and His lessons of practical\ngodliness, given for the benefit of all and to be the rule of right living\nfor all who should believe on His name. They should be imbued\nwith the spirit of their great Exemplar and have a high sense of the\nsacred life of a follower of Christ.\nChrist met the case of every class in the subjects and manner\nof His teaching. He dined and lodged with the rich and the poor,\nand made Himself familiar with the interests and occupations of\nmen, that He might gain access to their hearts. The learned and the\nmost intellectual were gratified and charmed with His discourses,\nand yet they were so plain and simple as to be comprehended by\nthe humblest minds. Christ availed Himself of every opportunity\nto give instruction to the people upon those heavenly doctrines and\nprecepts which should be incorporated into their lives and which\nwould distinguish them from all other religionists because of their\nholy, elevated character. These lessons of divine instruction are not\nbrought to bear upon men\u2019s consciences as they should be. These\nsermons of Christ furnish ministers believing present truth with\ndiscourses which will be appropriate on almost any occasion. Here [215]\nis a field of study for the Bible student, in which he cannot be\ninterested without having the spirit of the heavenly Teacher in his\nown heart. Here are subjects which Christ presented to all classes.\nThousands of people of every stamp of character and every grade of\nsociety were attracted and charmed with the matter brought before\nthem.\nSome ministers who have been long in the work of preaching\npresent truth have made great failures in their labors. They have\neducated themselves as combatants. They have studied out argu-\nmentative subjects for the object of discussion, and these subjects\n206 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nwhich they have prepared they love to use. The truth of God is plain,\nclear, and conclusive. It is harmonious and, in contrast with error,\nshines with clearness and beauty. Its consistency commends it to\nthe judgment of every heart that is not filled with prejudice. Our\npreachers present the arguments upon the truth, which have been\nmade ready for them, and, if there are no hindrances, the truth bears\naway the victory. But I was shown that in many cases the poor\ninstrument takes the credit of the victory gained, and the people,\nwho are more earthly than spiritual, praise and honor the instrument,\nwhile the truth of God is not exalted by the victory it gained.\nThose who love to engage in discussion generally lose their\nspirituality. They do not trust in God as they should. They have\nthe theory of the truth prepared to whip an opponent. The feelings\nof their own unsanctified hearts have prepared many sharp, close\nthings to use as a snap to their whip to irritate and provoke their\nopponent. The spirit of Christ has no part in this. While furnished\nwith conclusive arguments, the debater soon thinks that he is strong\nenough to triumph over his opponent, and God is left out of the\nmatter. Some of our ministers have made discussion their principal\nbusiness. When in the midst of the excitement raised by discussion,\nthey seem nerved up and feel strong and talk strong; and in the\nexcitement many things pass with the people as all right, which in\nthemselves are decidedly wrong and a shame to him who was guilty[216]\nof uttering words so unbecoming a Christian minister.\nThese things have a bad influence on ministers who are handling\nsacred, elevated truths, truths which are to prove as a savor of life\nunto life, or of death unto death, to those who hear them. Generally\nthe influence of discussions upon our ministers is to make them\nself-sufficient and exalted in their own estimation. This is not all.\nThose who love to debate are unfitted for being pastors to the flock.\nThey have trained their minds to meet opponents and to say sarcastic\nthings, and they cannot come down to meet hearts that are sorrowing\nand need comforting. They have also dwelt so much upon the\nargumentative that they have neglected the practical subjects that the\nflock of God need. They have but little knowledge of the sermons\nof Christ, which enter into the everyday life of the Christian, and\nthey have but little disposition to study them. They have risen above\nthe simplicity of the work. When they were little in their own eyes,\nEffect of Discussions 207\nGod helped them; angels of God ministered unto them and made\ntheir labors highly successful in convincing men and women of\nthe truth. But in the training of their minds for discussion they\nfrequently become coarse and rough. They lose the interest and\ntender sympathy which should ever attend the efforts of a shepherd\nof Christ.\nDebating ministers are generally disqualified to help the flock\nwhere they most need help. Having neglected practical religion in\ntheir own hearts and lives, they cannot teach it to the flock. Unless\nthere is an excitement, they do not know how to labor; they seem\nshorn of their strength. If they try to speak, they do not seem to\nknow how to present a subject that is proper for the occasion. When\nthey should present a subject which will feed the flock of God, and\nwhich will reach and melt hearts, they go back to some of the old\nstereotyped matter and go through the arranged arguments, which\nare dry and uninteresting. Thus, instead of light and life, they bring\ndarkness to the flock and also to their own souls.\nSome of our ministers fail to cultivate spirituality, but encourage [217]\na show of zeal and a certain activity which rests upon an uncertain\nfoundation. Ministers of calm contemplation, of thought and devo-\ntion, of conscience and faith, combined with activity and zeal, are\nwanted in this age. The two qualities, thought and devotion, activity\nand zeal, should go together.\nDebating ministers are the most unreliable among us, because\nthey cannot be depended upon when the work goes hard. Bring them\ninto a place where there is but little interest, and they manifest a\nwant of courage, zeal, and real interest. They depend as much upon\nbeing enlivened and invigorated by the excitement created by debate\nor opposition as does the inebriate upon his dram. These ministers\nneed to be converted anew. They need to drink deep of the unceasing\nstreams which proceed from the eternal Rock.\nThe eternal welfare of sinners regulated the conduct of Jesus.\nHe went about doing good. Benevolence was the life of His soul.\nHe not only did good to all who came to Him soliciting His mercy,\nbut He perseveringly sought them out. He was never elated with\napplause or dejected by censure or disappointment. When He met\nwith the greatest opposition and the most cruel treatment He was\nof good courage. The most important discourse that Inspiration has\n208 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ngiven us, Christ preached to only one listener. As He sat upon the\nwell to rest, for He was weary, a Samaritan woman came to draw\nwater; He saw an opportunity to reach her mind, and through her\nto reach the minds of the Samaritans, who were in great darkness\nand error. Although weary, He presented the truths of His spiritual\nkingdom, which charmed the heathen woman and filled her with\nadmiration for Christ. She went forth publishing the news: \u201cCome,\nsee a man which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the\nChrist?\u201d This woman\u2019s testimony converted many to a belief in\nChrist. Through her report many came to hear Him for themselves\nand believed because of His own word.\nHowever small may be the number of interested listeners, if the[218]\nheart is reached and the understanding convinced, they can, like the\nSamaritan woman, carry a report which will raise the interest of\nhundreds to investigate for themselves. While laboring in places\nto create an interest, there will be many discouragements; but if at\nfirst there seems to be but little interest, it is no evidence that you\nhave mistaken your duty and place of labor. If the interest steadily\nincreases, and the people move understandingly, not from impulse,\nbut from principle, the interest is much more healthy and durable\nthan it is where a great excitement and interest are created suddenly,\nand the feelings are excited by listening to a debate, a sharp contest\non both sides of the question, for and against the truth. Fierce\nopposition is thus created, positions are taken, and rapid decisions\nmade. A feverish state of things is the result. Calm consideration and\njudgment are wanting. Let this excitement subside, or let reaction\ntake place by indiscreet management, and the interest can never\nbe raised again. The feelings and sympathies of the people were\nstirred; but their consciences were not convicted, their hearts were\nnot broken and humbled before God.\nIn the presentation of unpopular truth, which involves a heavy\ncross, preachers should be careful that every word is as God would\nhave it. Their words should never cut. They should present the\ntruth in humility, with the deepest love for souls and an earnest\ndesire for their salvation, and let the truth cut. They should not defy\nministers of other denominations and seek to provoke a debate. They\nshould not stand in a position like that of Goliath when he defied the\narmies of Israel. Israel did not defy Goliath, but Goliath made his\nEffect of Discussions 209\nproud boasts against God and His people. The defying, the boasting,\nand the railing must come from the opposers of truth, who act the\nGoliath. But none of this spirit should be seen in those whom God\nhas sent forth to proclaim the last message of warning to a doomed\nworld.\nGoliath trusted in his armor. He terrified the armies of Israel\nby his defiant, savage boastings, while he made a most imposing [219]\ndisplay of his armor, which was his strength. David, in his humility\nand zeal for God and his people, proposed to meet this boaster. Saul\nconsented and had his own kingly armor placed upon David. But\nhe would not consent to wear it. He laid off the king\u2019s armor, for\nhe had not proved it. He had proved God and, in trusting in Him,\nhad gained special victories. To put on Saul\u2019s armor would give\nthe impression that he was a warrior, when he was only little David\nwho tended the sheep. He did not mean that any credit be given to\nthe armor of Saul, for his trust was in the Lord God of Israel. He\nselected a few pebbles from the brook, and with his sling and staff,\nhis only weapons, he went forth in the name of the God of Israel to\nmeet the armed warrior.\nGoliath disdained David, for his appearance was that of a mere\nyouth untaught in the tactics of warfare. Goliath railed upon David\nand cursed him by his gods. He felt that it was an insult upon his\ndignity to have a mere stripling, without so much as an armor, come\nto meet him. He made his boast of what he would do to him. David\ndid not become irritated because he was looked upon as so inferior,\nneither did he tremble at his terrible threats, but replied: \u201cThou\ncomest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I\ncome to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies\nof Israel, whom thou hast defied.\u201d David tells Goliath that in the\nname of the Lord he will do to him the very things that Goliath had\nthreatened to do to David. \u201cAnd all this assembly shall know that the\nLord saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the Lord\u2019s,\nand He will give you into our hands.\u201d\nOur ministers should not defy and provoke discussion. Let the\ndefying be on the side of the opposers of God\u2019s truth. I was shown\nthat Brother K and other ministers have acted too much the part of\nGoliath. And then after they have dared and provoked discussion\nthey have trusted in their prepared arguments, as Saul wanted David\n210 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nto trust in his armor. They have not, like humble David, trusted in\nthe God of Israel, and made Him their strength. They have gone\nforth confident and boastful, like Goliath, magnifying themselves[220]\nand not hiding behind Jesus. They knew the truth was strong, and\ntherefore have not humbled their hearts and in faith trusted in God\nto give the truth the victory. They have become elated and lost their\nbalance, and frequently the discussions have not been successful,\nand the result has been an injury to their own souls and to the souls\nof others.\nI was shown that some of our young ministers are getting a\npassion for debating, and that, unless they see their danger, this\nwill prove a snare to them. I was shown that Brother L is in great\ndanger. He is training his mind in the wrong direction. He is in\ndanger of getting above the simplicity of the work. When he gets\non Saul\u2019s armor, if, like David, he has wisdom to lay it off because\nhe has not proved it, he may recover himself before he goes too\nfar. These young preachers should study the practical teachings of\nChrist as well as the theoretical, and learn of Jesus, that they may\nhave His grace, His meekness, His humility and lowliness of mind.\nIf they, like David, are brought into a position where God\u2019s cause\nreally calls for them to meet a defier of Israel, and if they go forth\nin the strength of God, relying wholly upon Him, He will carry\nthem through and cause His truth to triumph gloriously. Christ has\ngiven us an example. \u201cYet Michael the Archangel, when contending\nwith the devil He disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring\nagainst him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.\u201d\nAs soon as a preacher comes down from the position a minister\nshould ever occupy, and descends to the comical to create a laugh\nover his opponent, or when he is sarcastic and sharp, and rails upon\nhim, he does that which the Saviour of the world did not dare to\ndo; for he places himself upon the enemy\u2019s ground. Ministers who\ncontend with opposers of the truth of God do not have to meet men\nmerely, but Satan and his host of evil angels. Satan watches for a\nchance to get the advantage of ministers who are advocating the\ntruth, and when they cease to put their entire trust in God, and their\nwords are not in the spirit and love of Christ, the angels of God[221]\ncannot strengthen and enlighten them. They leave them to their own\nstrength, and evil angels press in their darkness; for this reason the\nEffect of Discussions 211\nopponents of the truth sometimes seem to have the advantage, and\nthe discussion does more harm than real good.\nGod\u2019s servants should come nearer to Him. Brethren K, L, M,\nand N should be seeking to cultivate personal piety, rather than to\nencourage a love of debate. They should be seeking to become\nshepherds to the flock, rather than to be fitting themselves to create\nan excitement by swaying the feelings of the people. These brethren\nare in danger of depending more upon their popularity and their\nsuccess with the people as smart debaters than upon being humble,\nfaithful laborers and meek, devoted followers of Christ, co-workers\nwith Him.\n* * * * *\nChapter 24\u2014Dangers and Duties of Youth\nAddressed to Two Young Men\nLast December I was shown the dangers and temptations of\nyouth. The two younger sons of Father O need to be converted.\nThey need to die daily to self. Paul, the faithful apostle, had a fresh\nexperience daily. He says: \u201cI die daily.\u201d This is exactly the experi-\nence that these young men need. They are in danger of overlooking\npresent duty and of neglecting the education that is essential for\npractical life. They regard education in books as the all-important\nmatter to be attended to in order to make life a success.\nThese young men have duties at home which they overlook.\nThey have not learned to take up the duties and bear the home re-\nsponsibilities which it is their duty to bear. They have a faithful,\npractical mother, who has borne many burdens which her children\nshould not have suffered her to bear. In this they have failed to honor\ntheir mother. They have not shared the burdens of their father as was\ntheir duty, and have neglected to honor him as they should. They fol-[222]\nlow inclination rather than duty. They have pursued a selfish course\nin their lives, in shunning burdens and toil, and have failed to obtain\na valuable experience which they cannot afford to be deprived of if\nthey would make life a success. They have not felt the importance of\nbeing faithful in little things, nor have they felt under obligation to\ntheir parents to be true, thorough, and faithful in the humble, lowly\nduties of life which lie directly in their pathway. They look above\nthe common branches of knowledge, so very necessary for practical\nlife.\nIf these young men would be a blessing anywhere, it should be\nat home. If they yield to inclination, instead of being guided by the\ncautious decision of sober reason, sound judgment, and enlightened\nconscience, they cannot be a blessing to society or to their father\u2019s\nfamily, and their prospects in this world and in the better world\nmay be endangered. Many youth receive the impression that their\n212\nDangers and Duties of Youth 213\nearly life is not designed for caretaking, but to be frittered away in\nidle sport, in jesting, in joking, and in foolish indulgences. While\nengaged in folly and indulgence of the senses, some think of nothing\nbut the momentary gratification connected with it. Their desire\nfor amusement, their love for society and for chatting and laughing,\nincreases by indulgence, and they lose all relish for the sober realities\nof life, and home duties seem uninteresting. There is not enough\nchange to meet their minds, and they become restless, peevish, and\nirritable. These young men should feel it a duty to make home happy\nand cheerful. They should bring sunshine into the dwelling, rather\nthan a shadow by needless repining and unhappy discontent.\nThese young men should remember that they are responsible for\nall the privileges they have enjoyed, that they are accountable for\nthe improvement of their time and must render an exact account for\nthe improvement of their abilities. They may inquire: Shall we have\nno amusement or recreation? Shall we work, work, work, without\nvariation? Any amusement in which they can engage asking the\nblessing of God upon it in faith will not be dangerous. But any [223]\namusement which disqualifies them for secret prayer, for devotion\nat the altar of prayer, or for taking part in the prayer meeting is not\nsafe, but dangerous. A change from physical labor that has taxed the\nstrength severely may be very necessary for a time, that they may\nagain engage in labor, putting forth exertion with greater success.\nBut entire rest may not be necessary, or even be attended with the\nbest results so far as their physical strength is concerned. They\nneed not, even when weary with one kind of labor, trifle away their\nprecious moments. They may then seek to do something not so\nexhausting, but which will be a blessing to their mother and sisters.\nIn lightening their cares by taking upon themselves the roughest\nburdens they have to bear, they can find that amusement which\nsprings from principle and which will yield them true happiness, and\ntheir time will not be spent in trifling or in selfish indulgence. Their\ntime may be ever employed to advantage, and they be constantly\nrefreshed with variation, and yet be redeeming the time, so that every\nmoment will tell with good account to some one.\nYou have thought that it was of the highest importance to obtain\nan education in the sciences. There is no virtue in ignorance, and\nknowledge will not necessarily dwarf Christian growth; but if you\n214 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nseek for it from principle, having the right object before you and\nfeeling your obligation to God to use your faculties to do good to\nothers and promote His glory, knowledge will aid you to accomplish\nthis end; it will help you to bring into exercise the powers which\nGod has given you, and to employ them in His service.\nBut, young men, if you gain ever so much knowledge and yet fail\nto put that knowledge to a practical use you fail of your object. If,\nin obtaining an education, you become so absorbed in your studies\nthat you neglect prayer and religious privileges, and become careless\nand indifferent to the welfare of your souls, if you cease to learn in\nthe school of Christ, you are selling your birthright for a mess of\npottage. The object for which you are obtaining an education should[224]\nnot be lost sight of for a moment. It should be to so develop and\ndirect your faculties that you may be more useful and bless others to\nthe extent of your ability. If by obtaining knowledge you increase\nyour love of yourselves, and your inclination to excuse yourselves\nfrom bearing responsibilities, you are better without an education.\nIf you love and idolize books, and allow them to get between you\nand your duties, so that you feel a reluctance to leave your studies\nand your reading to do essential labor that someone must do, you\nshould restrain your desire to study and cultivate a love for doing\nthose things in which you now take no interest. He that is faithful in\nthat which is least will also be faithful in greater things.\nYou need to cultivate love and affection for your parents and\nfor your brothers and sisters. \u201cBe kindly affectioned one to another\nwith brotherly love; in honor preferring one another; not slothful\nin business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; rejoicing in hope;\npatient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; distributing to the\nnecessity of saints; given to hospitality.\u201d Young men, you cannot\nafford to sacrifice your eternal interests for your school studies. Your\nteachers may stimulate you by applause, and you may be deceived\nby the sophistry of Satan. You may be led on step by step to seek\nto excel and to obtain the approbation of your teachers, but your\nknowledge in the divine life, in experimental religion, will grow less\nand less. Your names will stand registered before the holy, exalted\nangels and before the Creator of the universe and Christ, the Majesty\nof heaven, in a very poor light. Opposite them will be a record of\nsins, of mistakes, failures, neglects, and such ignorance in spiritual\nDangers and Duties of Youth 215\nknowledge that the Father and His Son, Jesus our Advocate, and\nministering angels will be ashamed to own you as children of God.\nIn attending school you are exposed to a variety of temptations\nto which you would not be exposed at home in your father\u2019s house,\nunder the watchcare of God-fearing parents. If while at home you\nprayed by yourselves twice or three times a day for grace to es- [225]\ncape the corruptions that are in the world through lust, you need\nto pray as much more earnestly and constantly when at school, ex-\nposed to temptations and the contaminating influences which prevail\nin schools in this degenerate age, as your surroundings are more\nunfavorable to the formation of Christian character.\nThese young men have not sufficient strength of Christian char-\nacter; especially is this the case with A O. He is not settled, rooted,\nand grounded in the truth. His hold of God has been so slight that he\nhas not been receiving strength and light from above, but has been\ngathering darkness to his own soul. He has heard unbelief talked so\nmuch and has taken so little practical interest in the truth that he is\nnot prepared to give a reason of his hope. He is unstable like a reed\ntrembling in the wind. He is kind at heart, yet loves fun, idleness,\nand the company of his young friends. He has indulged this inclina-\ntion to the sacrifice of his soul\u2019s interest. It is important, my brother,\nthat you avoid mingling too much in the society of irreligious youth.\nThe culture of your mind and heart, in connection with the practical\nduties of life, requires that a large share of your time be spent in\nthe society of those whose conversation and faith will increase your\nfaith and love for the truth.\nYou have tried to throw off the restraint that the belief of the truth\nimposes, but you have not dared to be very bold in your unbelief.\nToo often the levities of the world, and the society of those from\nwhom self-communion and religion are excluded, have been your\nchoice, and you have been, to all intents and purposes, reckoned\nwith that class who bring the truth into contempt. You are not strong\nenough in faith or purpose to be in such society. In order to kill\ntime you have indulged in a spirit of trifling which has done positive\ninjury to you by blunting your conscience. You love approbation. If\nyou gain this in an honorable way, it is not so sinful; but you are in\ndanger of deceiving yourself and others; you need to be guarded on\nthis point and see that you earn all the approval you receive. If you [226]\n216 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nare approved because of your sound principles and moral worth, this\nis your gain. But if you are petted and courted and flattered because\nyou can make bright speeches and apt remarks, and because you are\ncheerful, lively, and witty, and not because of intellectual and moral\nworth, you will be looked upon by sensible, godly men and women\nas an object of pity rather than envy. You should be guarded against\nflattery. Whoever is foolish enough to flatter you cannot be your true\nfriend. Your true friends will caution, entreat, and warn you, and\nreprove your faults.\nYou have opened your mind to dark unbelief. Close it in the\nfear of God. Seek for the evidences, the pillars, of our faith and\nlay hold upon them with firm grasp. You need this confidence in\npresent truth, for it will prove an anchor to you. It will impart to your\ncharacter an energy, efficiency, and noble dignity that will command\nrespect. Encourage habits of industry. You are seriously lacking\nhere. Both you and your brother have brilliant ideas of success, but\nremember that in God is your only hope. Your prospects may at\ntimes look flattering to you, but anticipations which exalt you above\nsimple, humble home duties, and above religious duties, will prove\na failure. You, my dear young friends, need to humble your hearts\nbefore God and be obtaining a rich and valuable experience in the\nChristian life by following on to know the Lord and blessing others\nby daily lives of spotless purity, of noble integrity, of thoroughness\nin the performance of Christian duty and the duties of practical life.\nYou have duties to do at home; you have responsibilities to bear\nwhich you have not yet lifted.\nThat which ye sow ye shall also reap. These young men are now\nsowing the seed. Every act of their lives, every word spoken, is a seed\nfor good or evil. As is the seed, so will be the crop. If they indulge\nhasty, lustful, perverted passions or give up to the gratification of\nappetite or the inclination of their unsanctified hearts; if they foster\npride or wrong principles and cherish habits of unfaithfulness or\ndissipation, they will reap a plentiful harvest of remorse, shame, and[227]\ndespair.\nAngels of God are seeking to lead these young men to cry unto\nthe Lord in sincerity: \u201cBe Thou the guide of my youth.\u201d Angels are\ninviting and seeking to draw them from the snares of Satan. Heaven\nDangers and Duties of Youth 217\nmay be theirs if they will seek to obtain it. A crown of immortal\nglory will be theirs if they will give all for heaven.\n* * * * *\nChapter 25\u2014Self-Caring Ministers\nBrother R, your influence has not been of that character which\nwould do honor to the cause of present truth. Had you been sanctified\nby the truth you preach to others, you would have been of ten times\nmore advantage to the cause of God than you have been. You have\nrelied so much upon creating a sensation that without this you have\nbut little courage. These great excitements and sensational interests\nare your strength and glory and success as a laborer, but these are\nnot pleasing to God. Your labors in this direction are seldom what\nyou flatter yourself that they are.\nClose investigation reveals the fact that there are but very few\nsheaves to be gathered after these specially exciting meetings. Yet,\nfrom all the experience of the past, you have not learned to change\nyour manner of labor. You have been slow to learn how to shape\nyour future labors in such a manner as to shun the errors of the past.\nThe reason of this has been, that, like the inebriate, you love the\nstimulus of these sensational meetings; you long for them as the\ndrunkard longs for a glass of liquor to arouse his flagging energies.\nThese debates, which create an excitement, are mistaken for zeal\nfor God and love for the truth. You have been almost destitute of\nthe Spirit of God to work with your efforts. If you had God with\nyou in all your moves, and if you felt a burden for souls and had the\nwisdom to skillfully manage these exciting seasons to press souls\ninto the kingdom of Christ, you could see fruits of your labors, and\nGod would be glorified. Your soul should be all aglow with the spirit[228]\nof the truth you present to others. After you have labored to convict\nsouls of the claims that the law of God has upon them, teaching them\nrepentance toward God and faith in Christ, then your work is but\njust begun. You too frequently excuse yourself from completing the\nwork and leave a heavy burden for others to take up in finishing the\nwork that you ought to have done. You say that you are not qualified\nto finish up the work. Then the sooner you qualify yourself to bear\nthe burdens of a shepherd, or pastor, of the flock, the better.\n218\nSelf-Caring Ministers 219\nAs a true shepherd you should discipline yourself to deal with\nminds and to give to each of the flock of God his portion of meat\nin due season. You should be careful and study to have a store\nof practical subjects that you have investigated and that you can\nenter into the spirit of and present in a plain, forcible manner to\nthe people at the right time and place as they may need. You have\nnot been thoroughly furnished from the word of Inspiration unto all\ngood works. When the flock have needed spiritual food, you have\nfrequently presented some argumentative subject that was no more\nappropriate for the occasion than an oration upon national affairs. If\nyou would task yourself and educate your mind to a knowledge of\nthe subjects with which the word of God has amply furnished you,\nyou could build up the cause of God by feeding the flock with food\nwhich would be proper and which would give spiritual health and\nstrength as their wants require.\nYou have yet to learn the work of a true shepherd. When you\nunderstand this, the cause and work of God will rest upon you with\nsuch weight that you will not be inclined to jest and joke, and engage\nin light and frivolous conversation. A minister of Christ who has a\nproper burden of the work and a high sense of the exalted character\nand sacredness of his mission will not be inclined to be light and\ntrifling with the lambs of the flock.\nA true shepherd will have an interest in all that relates to the\nwelfare of the flock, feeding, guiding, and defending them. He [229]\nwill carry himself with great wisdom and will manifest a tender\nconsideration for all, being courteous and compassionate to all,\nespecially to the tempted, the afflicted, and the desponding. Instead\nof giving this class the sympathy that their particular cases have\ndemanded and that their infirmities have required, you, my brother,\nhave shunned this class, while you have drawn largely upon others\nfor sympathy. \u201cEven as the Son of man came not to be ministered\nunto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.\u201d \u201cVerily,\nverily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither\nhe that is sent greater than he that sent him.\u201d \u201cBut made Himself of\nno reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was\nmade in the likeness of men.\u201d \u201cWe then that are strong ought to bear\nthe infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let every\none of us please his neighbor for his good to edification. For even\n220 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nChrist pleased not Himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of\nthem that reproached Thee fell on Me.\u201d\nIt is not the work of a gospel minister to lord it over God\u2019s her-\nitage, but in lowliness of mind, with gentleness and long forbearance,\nto exhort, reprove, rebuke, with all long-suffering and doctrine. How\nwill the foregoing scriptures compare with your past life? You have\nbeen cultivating a selfish disposition nearly all your life. You married\na woman of a strong, set will. Her natural disposition was supremely\nselfish. You were both lovers of self, and uniting your interests did\nnot help the case of either, but increased the peril of both. Neither of\nyou were conscientious, and neither had the fear of God before you\nin a high sense. Love of self, self-gratification, has been the ruling\nprinciple. Both of you have had so little consecration to God that\nyou could not benefit each other. You have each wanted your own\nway; each has wanted to be petted and praised and waited upon.\nThe Lord saw your dangers and time and again sent you warnings\nthrough the Testimonies that your eternal interests were endangered\nunless you overcame your love of self, and conformed your will[230]\nto the will of God. Had you heeded the admonitions and warnings\nfrom the Lord, had you turned square about, made an entire change,\nyour wife would not now be in the snare of the enemy, left of God\nto believe the strong delusions of Satan. Had you followed the light\nthat God has given, you would now be a strong and efficient laborer\nin the cause of God, qualified to accomplish tenfold more than you\nare now competent to do. You have become weak because you have\nfailed to cherish the light. You have been able but a small part of\nthe time to discern the voice of the True Shepherd from that of a\nstranger. Your neglect to walk in the light has brought darkness\nupon you, and your conscience, by being often violated, has become\nbenumbed.\nYour wife did not believe and follow the light that the Lord\nin mercy sent her. She despised reproof, and herself closed the\ndoor through which the voice of the Lord was heard to counsel and\nwarn her. Satan was pleased, and there was nothing to hinder him\nfrom insinuating himself into her confidence, and, by his pleasing,\nflattering deceptions, leading her captive at his will.\nThe Lord gave you a testimony that your wife was a hindrance to\nyou in your labors and that you should not have her accompany you\nSelf-Caring Ministers 221\nunless you had the most positive evidence that she was a converted\nwoman, transformed by the renewing of her mind. You then felt that\nyou had an excuse to plead for a home; you made this testimony\nyour excuse and worked accordingly, although you had no need of a\nhome of your own. Your wife had duties to do to her parents which\nshe had neglected all her life. If she had taken up this long-neglected\nduty with a cheerful spirit she would not now be left captive to Satan\nto do his will and to corrupt her heart and soul in his service.\nYour want of a home was imaginary, like many of your supposed\nwants. You obtained the home that your selfishness desired, and you\ncould leave your wife comfortably situated. But God was preparing\na final test for her. The affliction of her mother was of a nature\nwhich would have aroused sympathy in her heart if it had not been [231]\nthoroughly seared, calloused by selfishness. But this providence of\nGod failed to arouse the filial love of the daughter for her suffering\nmother. She had no home cares to stand in her way, no children to\nshare her love and care, and her attention was devoted to her poor\nself.\nThe burden of care that her father had to bear was too much for\nhis age and strength, and he was prostrated with keen sufferings.\nSurely then, if the daughter had a sensitive spot in her heart, she\ncould not help feeling and arousing to a sense of her duty to share\nthe burdens of her sister and her sister\u2019s husband. But she revealed\nby her indifference, and by shunning all the care and burden that she\nwell could, that her heart was well-nigh as unimpressible as a stone.\nTo be close by her parents and yet be so indifferent would tell\nagainst her. She communicated the state of things to her husband.\nBrother R was as selfish as his wife, and he sent an urgent request\nfor her to come to him. How did angels of God, the tender, pitying,\nloving, ministering angels, look upon this act? The daughter left\nstrangers to do those tender offices that she should have cheerfully\nshared with her burdened sister. Angels looked with astonishment\nand grief upon the scene and turned from this selfish woman. Evil\nangels took the places of these, and she was led captive by Satan\nat his will. She was a medium of Satan and so proved to be a great\nhindrance to her husband; his labors were of but little account.\nThe cause of God would have stood higher in ----- if that last\neffort had not been made, for the work was not completed. An\n222 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ninterest was raised, but was left to sink where it could never be raised\nagain. I ask you, Brother R, to compare the scriptures previously\nquoted relative to the work and ministry of Christ with your course of\nconduct through your labors as a gospel minister, but more especially\nin the instance I have mentioned, where duty was too plain for any\nmistake, if the conscience and affections had not become paralyzed\nby a long course of continued idolatry of self.\nBecause of your leaving your parents in their suffering when[232]\nthey needed help, the church was obliged to take this burden and to\nwatch with the suffering members of Christ\u2019s body. In this heartless\nneglect you brought the frown of God upon yourselves. God does\nnot lightly pass by such things. They are recorded by the angels. God\ncannot prosper those who go directly contrary to the plainest duty\nspecified in His word, the duty of children to their parents. Children\nwho feel under no more obligation to their earthly parents than you\nhave done, but can so easily step out from the responsibilities upon\nthem, will not have due respect for their heavenly Father; they will\nnot reverence or respect the claims that God has upon them. If they\ndisrespect and dishonor their earthly parents they will not respect and\nlove their Creator. In neglecting her parents, your wife transgressed\nthe fifth precept of the Decalogue: \u201cHonor thy father and thy mother:\nthat thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God\ngiveth thee.\u201d This is the first commandment with promise. Those\nwho disrespect or dishonor their parents need not expect that the\nblessing of God will attend them. Our parents have claims upon us\nthat we cannot throw off or lightly regard. But children who have\nnot been trained and controlled in childhood, and who have been\npermitted to make themselves the objects of their care, selfishly\nseeking their own ease and avoiding burdens, become heartless and\ndo not respect the claims of their parents, who watched over them in\ntheir infancy.\nBrother R, you have been selfish in these things yourself and\ngreatly deficient in duty. You have required attention and care, but\nyou have not given the same in return. You have been selfish and\nexacting, and have frequently been unreasonable and given your\nwife occasion for trial. Both of you have been unconsecrated and\nastonishingly selfish. You have made but little sacrifice for the truth\u2019s\nsake. You, as well as your wife, have avoided burdens, and have\nSelf-Caring Ministers 223\noccupied a position to be waited upon rather than to try to be as little\nburden as possible.\nMinisters of Christ should feel it a duty binding upon them, if [233]\nthey receive the hospitalities of their brethren or friends, to leave a\nblessing with the family by seeking to encourage and strengthen its\nmembers. They should not neglect the duties of a pastor, as they visit\nfrom house to house. They should become familiar with every mem-\nber of the family, that they may understand the spiritual condition of\nall, and vary their manner of labor to meet the case of each. When\na minister bearing the solemn message of warning to the world re-\nceives the hospitable courtesies of friends and brethren, and neglects\nthe duties of a shepherd of the flock and is careless in his example\nand deportment, engaging with the young in trifling conversation,\nin jesting and joking, and in relating humorous anecdotes to create\nlaughter, he is unworthy of being a gospel minister and needs to be\nconverted before he should be entrusted with the care of the sheep\nand lambs. Ministers who are neglectful of the duties devolving on a\nfaithful pastor give evidence that they are not sanctified by the truths\nthey present to others and should not be sustained as laborers in the\nvineyard of the Lord till they have a high sense of the sacredness of\nthe work of a minister of Christ.\nWhen there are only evening meetings to attend, there is much\ntime that can be used to great advantage in visiting from house\nto house, meeting the people where they are. And if ministers\nof Christ have the graces of the Spirit, if they imitate the great\nExemplar, they will find access to hearts and will win souls to Christ.\nSome ministers bearing the last message of mercy are too distant.\nThey do not improve the opportunities that they have of gaining\nthe confidence of unbelievers, by their exemplary deportment, their\nunselfish interest for the good of others, their kindness, forbearance,\nhumbleness of mind, and their respectful courtesy. These fruits of\nthe Spirit will exert a far greater influence than will the preaching in\nthe desk without individual effort in families. But the preaching of\npointed, testing truths to the people, and corresponding individual\nefforts from house to house to back up pulpit effort, will greatly\nextend the influence for good, and souls will be converted to the\ntruth.\nSome of our ministers carry too light responsibilities, they shun [234]\n224 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nindividual care and burdens; for this reason they do not feel that need\nof help from God that they would if they lifted the burdens that the\nwork of God and our faith require them to lift. When burdens in this\ncause have to be borne, and when those who bear them are brought\ninto strait places, they will feel the need of living near to God, that\nthey may have confidence to commit their ways to Him and in faith\nclaim that help which He alone can give. They will then be daily\nobtaining an experience in faith and trust, which is of the highest\nvalue to gospel ministers. Their work is more solemn and sacred\nthan ministers generally realize. They should carry with them a\nsanctified influence. God requires that those who minister in sacred\nthings should be men who feel jealous for His cause. The burden\nof their work should be the salvation of souls. Brother R, you have\nnot felt as the prophet Joel describes: \u201cLet the priests, the ministers\nof the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say,\nSpare Thy people, O Lord, and give not Thine heritage to reproach.\u201d\n\u201cThey that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and\nweepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with\nrejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\u201d\nBrother R, I was shown in what marked contrast with the require-\nments of God\u2019s word your course of labor has been. You have been\ncareless in your words and in your deportment. The sheep have had\nthe burden to care for the shepherd, to warn, reprove, exhort, and\nweep over the reckless course of their shepherd, who, by accepting\nhis office, acknowledges that he is mouthpiece for God. Yet he cares\nfar more for himself than he does for the poor sheep. You have\nnot felt a burden for souls. You have not gone forth to your labors\nweeping and praying for souls that sinners might be converted. Had\nyou done this you would be sowing seed which would spring up\nafter many days and bear fruit to the glory of God. When there is no\nwork that you can do by the fireside in conversation and prayer with\nfamilies, you should then show industry and economy of time, and[235]\ntrain yourself to bear responsibilities by useful employment.\nYou and your wife might have saved yourselves many ill turns\nand been more cheerful and happy had you sought your ease less\nand combined physical labor with your study. Your muscles were\nmade for use, not to be inactive. God gave to Adam and Eve in Eden\nall that their wants required; yet their heavenly Father knew that\nSelf-Caring Ministers 225\nthey needed employment in order to retain their happiness. If you,\nBrother R, would exercise your muscles in laboring with your hands\nsome portion of each day, combining labor with study, your mind\nwould be better balanced, your thoughts would be of a purer and\nmore elevated character, and your sleep would be more natural and\nhealthful. Your head would be less confused and stupid because of a\ncongested brain. Your thoughts upon sacred truth would be clearer,\nand your moral powers more vigorous. You do not love labor; but\nit is for your good to have more physical exercise daily; for it will\nquicken the sluggish blood to healthful activity, and will carry you\nabove discontent and infirmities.\nYou should not neglect diligent study, but should pray for light\nfrom God that He would open to your understanding the treasures of\nHis word, that you may be thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\nYou will never be in a position where it is not necessary for you\nto watch and pray earnestly in order to overcome your besetments.\nYou will need to be guarded continually to keep self out of sight.\nYou have encouraged a habit of making yourself very prominent,\ndwelling upon your family difficulties and your poor health. In short,\nyourself has been the theme of your conversation and has come in\nbetween you and your Saviour. You should forget self and hide\nbehind Jesus. Let the dear Saviour be magnified, but lose sight of\nself. When you see and feel your weakness you will not see that\nthere is anything in yourself worthy of notice or remark. The people\nhave not only been wearied, but disgusted, with your preliminaries\nbefore you present your subject. Every time that you speak to the [236]\npeople and mention your family trials you lower yourself in their\nestimation and suggest suspicions that you are not all right.\nYou have the example of ministers who have exalted themselves\nand who have coveted praise from the people. They were petted\nand flattered by the indiscreet until they became exalted and self-\nsufficient, and, trusting in their own wisdom, made shipwreck of\nfaith. They thought that they were so popular that they could take\nalmost any course and yet retain their popularity. Here has been\nyour presumption. When the deportment of a minister of Christ\ngives gossiping tongues facts as subject matter to discuss and his\nmorality is seriously questioned, he should not call this jealousy or\nslander. You should be cautious how you encourage a habitual train\n226 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nof thought from which habits are formed that will prove your ruin.\nMark those whose course you should abhor, and then forbear to take\nthe first step in the direction they have traveled.\nYou have been self-sufficient and so blinded and deluded by Sa-\ntan that you could not discern your weakness and many errors. \u201cBut\nthe fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,\ngoodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.\nAnd they that are Christ\u2019s have crucified the flesh with the affections\nand lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Let\nus not be desirous of vainglory, provoking one another, envying one\nanother.\u201d\nI was shown fields of labor. Towns, cities, and villages every-\nwhere should hear the message of warning; for all will be tested\nand proved by the message of present truth. A great work is to be\ndone, but the laborers who enter these fields should be men of sound\njudgment who know how to deal with minds. They should be men\nof patience, kindness, and courtesy who have the fear of God before\nthem.\nYou frequently gain the confidence of the people; but if, by\ncareless deportment or some injudicious move, by severity or an\noverbearing spirit, you then lose their confidence, more harm will\nresult to the cause of God than if no effort had been made. Great[237]\ninjury has been done to the cause of God by ministers moving from\nimpulse. Some are easily stirred and frequently become irritated;\nand, if abused, they retaliate. This is just what Satan exults to\nhave them do. The enemies of truth triumph over this weakness\nin a minister of Christ, for it is a reproach to the cause of present\ntruth. Those who show this weakness of character do not rightly\nrepresent the truth or the ministers of our faith. The indiscretion of\none minister throws a cloud of suspicion upon all and makes the\nlabors of those who follow after him exceedingly difficult.\nBrother R, when you go out to engage in labor in a new field you\nlove to dwell upon the argumentative, because you have educated\nyour mind for this kind of labor. But your labors have not been\none tenth as valuable as they would have been had you qualified\nyourself by practical experience to give the people discourses upon\npractical subjects. You need to become a learner in the school of\nChrist, that you may experience practical godliness. When you\nSelf-Caring Ministers 227\nhave the saving power of truth in your own soul you cannot forbear\nfeeding the flock of God with the same practical truths which have\nmade your own heart joyful in God. The practical and the doctrinal\nshould be combined in order to impress hearts with the importance\nof yielding to the claims of truth after the understanding has been\nconvinced by the weight of evidence. The servants of Christ should\nimitate the example of the Master in the manner of their labor. They\nshould constantly keep before the people, in the best manner to be\ncomprehended by them, the necessity of practical godliness, and\nshould bring them, as did our Saviour in His teachings, to see the\nnecessity of religious principle and righteousness in everyday life.\nThe people are not fed by the ministers of popular churches, and\nsouls are starving for food that will nourish and give spiritual life.\nYour life has not been marked with humbleness of mind and\nmeekness of deportment. You love God in word, but not in deed\nand in truth. Your dignity is easily hurt. Ministers should first feel\nthe sanctifying influence of the truth upon their own hearts and in [238]\ntheir own lives, and then their pulpit efforts will be enforced by\ntheir example out of the desk. Ministers need to be softened and\nsanctified themselves before God can in a special manner work with\ntheir efforts.\nYou have let slip the golden opportunity of gathering a harvest of\nsouls because it was impossible for God to work with your efforts,\nfor your heart was not right with Him. Your spirit was not pure\nbefore Him who is the embodiment of purity and holiness. If you\nregard iniquity in your heart, the Lord will not hear your prayer. Our\nGod is a jealous God. He knoweth the thoughts and the imaginations\nand devices of the heart. You have followed your own judgment\nand made a sad failure when you might have had success. There\nis too much at stake in these efforts, to do the work negligently or\nrecklessly. Souls are being tested upon important, eternal truth, and\nwhat you may say or do will have an influence to balance them in\ndeciding either for or against the truth. When you should have been\nin humility before God, pleading for Him to work with your efforts,\nfeeling the weight of the cause and the value of souls, you have\nchosen the society of young ladies, regardless of the sacred work\nof God and of your office as a minister of the gospel of Christ. You\n228 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nwere standing between the living and the dead; yet you engaged in\nlight and frivolous conversation, in jesting and joking.\nHow can ministering angels be round about you, shedding light\nupon you and imparting strength to you? When you should be\nseeking to find ways and means to enlighten the minds of those in\nerror and darkness you are pleasing yourself and are too selfish to\nengage in a work for which you have no inclination or love. If our\nposition is criticized by those who are investigating, you have but\nlittle patience with them. You frequently give them a short, severe\nreply, as though they had no business to search closely, but must take\nall that is presented as truth, without investigating for themselves. In\nyour ministerial labors you have turned many souls away from the\ntruth by your manner of treating them. You are not always impatient\nand unapproachable; when you feel like it you will take time to[239]\nanswer questions candidly; but frequently you are uncourteous and\nexacting, and are pettish and irritable like a child.\nA concealed golden wedge and a Babylonish garment troubled\nthe entire camp of Israel. The frown of God was brought upon the\npeople because of the sin of one man. Thousands were slain upon\nthe field of battle because God would not bless and prosper a people\namong whom there was even one sinner, one who had transgressed\nHis word. This sinner was not in holy office, yet a jealous God could\nnot go forth to battle with the armies of Israel while these concealed\nsins were in the camp.\nNotwithstanding the apostle\u2019s warning is before us to \u201cabstain\nfrom all appearance of evil,\u201d some persist in pursuing a course\nunbecoming Christians. God requires His people to be holy, to keep\nthemselves separate from the works of darkness, to be pure in heart\nand life, and unspotted from the world. The children of God, by\nfaith in Christ, are His chosen people; and when they stand upon the\nholy ground of Bible truth they will be saved from fellowship with\nthe unfruitful works of darkness.\nBrother R, you have stood directly in the way of the work of God\nand have brought great darkness and discouragement upon His cause.\nYou have been blinded by Satan; you have worked for sympathy\nand have obtained it. Had you stood in the light you could have\ndiscerned the power of Satan at work to deceive and destroy you.\nThe children of God do not eat and drink to please the appetite, but\nSelf-Caring Ministers 229\nto preserve life and strength to do their Master\u2019s will. They clothe\nthemselves for health, not for display or to keep pace with changing\nfashion. The desire of the eye and the pride of life are banished\nfrom their wardrobes and from their houses, from principle. They\nmove from godly sincerity, and their conversation is elevated and\nheavenly.\nGod is very pitiful, for He understands our weaknesses and our [240]\ntemptations; and when we come to Him with broken hearts and\ncontrite spirits, He accepts our repentance, and promises that, as we\ntake hold of His strength to make peace with Him, we shall make\npeace with Him. Oh, what gratitude, what joy, should we feel that\nGod is merciful!\nYou have failed to rely upon the strength of God. You have\ndwelt upon yourself and made yourself the theme of thought and\nconversation. Your trials have been magnified to yourself and others,\nand your mind has been diverted from the truth, from the Pattern\nwhich we are required to copy, to weak Brother R.\nWhen out of the desk you should have felt the worth of souls\nand been seeking opportunities to present the truth to individuals,\nbut you have not felt the responsibility devolving upon a gospel\nminister. Jesus and righteousness have not been your themes, and\nmany opportunities have been lost that, if improved, might have\ndecided more than a score of souls to give all for Christ and the truth.\nBut the burden you would not lift. The pastoral labor involved a\ncross, and you would not engage in it.\nI saw angels of God watching the impressions you make and\nthe fruits you bear out of meeting, and your general influence upon\nbelievers and unbelievers. I saw these angels veil their faces in\nsadness and in sorrow turn reluctantly from you. Frequently you\nwere engaged in matters of minor consequence, and when you had\nefforts to make which required the vigor of all your energies, clear\nthought, and earnest prayer, you followed your own pleasure and\ninclination, and trusted to your own strength and wisdom to meet,\nnot men alone, but principalities and powers, Satan and his angels.\nThis was doing the work of God negligently and placing the truth\nand cause of God in jeopardy, periling the salvation of souls.\nAn entire change must take place in you before you can be\nentrusted with the work of God. You should consider your life a\n230 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nsolemn reality and that it is no idle dream. As a watchman upon the\nwalls of Zion, you are answerable for the souls of the people. You[241]\nshould settle into God. You move without due consideration, from\nimpulse rather than from principle. You have not felt the positive\nnecessity of training your mind, nor of crucifying in yourself the\nold man with the affections and lusts. You need to be balanced by\nthe weight of God\u2019s Spirit, and all your movements regulated by it.\nYou are now uncertain in all you undertake. You do and undo; you\nbuild up and then tear down; you kindle an interest and then from\nlack of consecration and divine wisdom you quench it. You have not\nbeen strengthened, established, and settled. You have had but little\nfaith; you have not lived a life of prayer. You need so much to link\nyour life with God, and then you will not sow to the flesh and reap\ncorruption in the end.\nJesting, joking, and worldly conversation belong to the world.\nChristians who have the peace of God in their hearts will be cheerful\nand happy without indulging in lightness or frivolity. While watching\nunto prayer they will have a serenity and peace which will elevate\nthem above all superfluities. The mystery of godliness, opened to\nthe mind of the minister of Christ, will raise him above earthly and\nsensual enjoyments. He will be a partaker of the divine nature,\nhaving escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. The\ncommunication opened between God and his soul will make him\nfruitful in the knowledge of God\u2019s will and open before him treasures\nof practical subjects that he can present to the people, which will\nnot cause levity or the semblance of a smile, but will solemnize the\nmind, touch the heart, and arouse the moral sensibilities to the sacred\nclaims that God has upon the affections and life. Those who labor\nin word and doctrine should be men of God, pure in heart and life.\nYou are in the greatest danger of bringing reproach upon the\ncause of God. Satan knows your weakness. His angels communicate\nyour weak points to those who are deceived by his lying wonders,\nand they are already counting you as one of their number. Satan\nexults to have you pursue an unwise course because you place\nyourself upon his ground and give him advantage over you. He well[242]\nknows that the indiscretion of men who advocate the law of God\nwill turn souls from the truth. You have not taken upon your soul\nthe burden of the work and labored carefully and earnestly in private\nSelf-Caring Ministers 231\nto favorably impress minds in regard to the truth. You too frequently\nbecome impatient, irritable, and childish, and make yourself enemies\nby your abrupt manners. Unless you are on your guard, you prejudice\nsouls against the truth. Unless you are a transformed man, and will\ncarry out in your life the principles of the sacred truths you present\nin the desk, your labors will amount to but little.\nA weight of responsibility rests upon you. It is the watchman\u2019s\nduty to be ever at his post, watching for souls as one that must give\nan account. If your mind is diverted from the great work and filled\nwith unholy thoughts; if selfish plans and projects rob of sleep, and\nin consequence the mental and physical strength is lessened, you\nsin against your own soul and against God. Your discernment is\nblunted, and sacred things are placed upon a level with the common.\nGod is dishonored, His cause reproached, and the good work you\nmight have done had you made God your trust is marred. Had you\npreserved the vigor of your powers to put the strength of your brain\nand entire being into the important work of God without reserve,\nyou would have realized a much greater work, and it would have\nbeen more perfectly done.\nYour labors have been defective. A master workman engages his\nmen to do for him a very nice and valuable job which requires study\nand much careful thought. As they agree to do the work they know\nthat, in order to accomplish the task aright, all their faculties need\nto be aroused and in the very best condition to put forth their best\nefforts. But one man of the company is ruled by perverse appetite.\nHe loves strong drink. Day after day he gratifies his desire for\nstimulus, and, while under the influence of this stimulus, the brain is\nclouded, the nerves are weakened, and his hands are unsteady. He\ncontinues his labor day after day and nearly ruins the job entrusted [243]\nto him. That man forfeits his wages and does almost irreparable\ninjury to his employer. Through his unfaithfulness he loses the\nconfidence of his master as well as of his fellow workmen. He was\nentrusted with a great responsibility, and in accepting that trust he\nacknowledged that he was competent to do the work according to\nthe directions given by his employer. But through his own love of\nself the appetite was indulged and the consequences risked.\nYour case, Brother R, is similar to this. But the accountability of\na minister of Christ, who is to warn the world of a coming judgment,\n232 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nis as much more important than that of the common workman as\neternal things are of more consequence than temporal. If the minister\nof the gospel yields to his inclination rather than to be guided by\nduty, if he indulges self at the expense of spiritual strength, and as\nthe result moves indiscreetly, souls will rise up in the judgment to\ncondemn him for his unfaithfulness. The blood of souls will be\nfound on his garments. It may seem to the unconsecrated minister a\nsmall thing to be fitful, impulsive, and unconsecrated; to build up,\nand then to tear down; to dishearten, distress, and discourage the\nvery souls that have been converted by the truth he has presented. It\nis a sad thing to lose the confidence of the very ones whom he has\nbeen laboring to save. But the result of an unwise course pursued by\nthe minister will never be fully understood until the minister sees as\nGod seeth.\n* * * * *\nChapter 26\u2014Inordinate Love of Gain\nBrother S,\nI was shown, December 10, 1871, that there are serious defects\nin your character, which, unless seen and overcome, will prove\nyour ruin; and you will not only be weighed in the balances of\nthe sanctuary, and found wanting yourself, but your influence will\ndetermine the destiny of others. You are either gathering with Christ\nor scattering abroad.\nI was shown that you have a deeply rooted love for the world. [244]\nThe love of money is the root of all evil. You flatter yourself that\nyou are about right, when you are not. God seeth not as man seeth.\nHe looks at the heart. His ways are not our ways, nor His thoughts\nour thoughts. Your great care and anxiety is to acquire means. This\nabsorbing passion has been increasing upon you until it is overbal-\nancing your love of the truth. Your soul is being corrupted through\nthe love of money. Your love for the truth and for its advancement is\nvery weak. Your earthly treasures claim and hold your affections.\nYou have a knowledge of the truth; you are not ignorant of the\nclaims of Scripture; you know your Master\u2019s will, for He has plainly\nrevealed it. But your heart is not inclined to follow the light which\nshines upon your pathway. You have a large measure of self-conceit.\nYour love for self is greater than your love for the cause of present\ntruth. Your self-confidence and your self-sufficiency will certainly\nprove your ruin unless you can see your weakness and errors, and\nreform. You are arbitrary. You have a set will of your own to\nmaintain, and although the opinions of others may be correct, and\nyour judgment wrong, yet you are not the man to yield. You hold\nfirmly to your advanced opinion, irrespective of the judgment of\nothers. I wish you could see the danger of continuing the course you\nhave been pursuing. If your eyes could be enlightened by the Spirit\nof God, you would see these things clearly.\nYour wife loves the truth, and she is a practical woman, a woman\nof principle. But you do not appreciate her value. She has worked\n233\n234 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nhard for the common good of the family, but you have not given\nher your confidence. You have not counseled with her as was your\nduty. You keep your matters very much to yourself; you do not love\nto open your heart to your wife and let her know your exercises of\nmind and your real faith and feelings. You are secretive. Your wife\ndoes not hold the honored place in your family that she deserves and\nthat she is capable of filling.\nYou feel that your wife should not interfere with your plans\nand arrangements, and you too frequently set your will and plans[245]\nof operation in opposition to hers. You act as though her identity\nshould be merged in yours. You are not satisfied to have her act as\nthough she had an individuality, an identify of her own. God holds\nher accountable for her individuality. You cannot save her, and she\ncannot save you. She has a conscience of her own by which she\nmust be guided. You are too willing to be conscience for her, and\nsometimes for your children. God has higher claims upon your wife\nthan you can have. She must form a character for herself, and she is\naccountable to God for the character she develops.\nYou have a character to form, and you are accountable to God for\nthe character that you develop. You have a controlling influence and\npossess a dictatorial spirit, which is not in accordance with the will\nof God. You must cease to be so exacting. You have prided yourself\nupon your fine taste and organization. You have nice ideas, but you\nhave not carried this exact and fine perception into your character\nand into your deportment. You have failed to perfect a symmetrical\ncharacter. You have good ideas of order and arrangement, but all\nthese nice qualities of the mind have become blunted by being\nperverted. You have not complied with the conditions laid down\nin the word of God for becoming a son of God. All the promises\nof God are upon conditions. \u201cCome out from among them, and be\nye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I\nwill receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My\nsons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. Having therefore these\npromises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness\nof the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\u201d This\nexperience you have yet to obtain. You love to get into the company\nof unbelievers and hear them talk, and talk yourself. Jesus cannot\nbe glorified with your conversation, and if you had had the spirit of\nInordinate Love of Gain 235\nJesus you could not have been so much in the society of those who\nhad no love for the truth of God.\nYou have felt that there were hindrances to your children\u2019s be- [246]\ncoming Christians, and have felt that others were to blame. But do\nnot deceive yourself in regard to this matter. Your influence as a fa-\nther has been sufficient, if there were nothing else to hinder, to stand\nin their way. Your example and your conversation have been of such\na character that your children could not believe that your course was\nconsistent with your profession. Your conversation with unbelievers\nhas been of such a low order, and so light, so filled with jesting\nand joking, that your influence could never elevate them. Your deal\nwith others has not always been strictly honest. You have not loved\nGod with all your heart, mind, and strength, and your neighbor as\nyourself. If in your power, you would advantage yourself at your\nneighbor\u2019s disadvantage. Every dollar which comes to you in this\nmanner will carry with it a curse which you will feel sooner or later.\nGod marks every act of injustice, be it done to believer or unbeliever,\nand He will not pass it over. Your acquisitive disposition is a snare\nto you. Your deal with your fellow men cannot endure the test of the\njudgment.\nYour Christian character is spotted with avarice. These spots\nwill have to be removed, or you will lose eternal life. We each have\na work to do for the Master; we each have talents to improve. The\nhumblest and poorest of the disciples of Jesus can be a blessing\nto others. They may not realize that they are doing any special\ngood, but, by their unconscious influence, they may start waves of\nblessing which will widen and deepen, and the happy result of their\nwords and consistent deportment they may never know until the final\ndistribution of rewards. They do not feel or know that they are doing\nanything great. They are not required to weary themselves with\nanxieties about success. They have only to go forward, not with\nmany words and vainglorying and boasting, but quietly, faithfully\ndoing the work which God\u2019s providence has assigned them, and they\nwill not lose their reward. Thus will it be in your case. The memorial\nof your life will be written in the book of records; and, if you are\nfinally an overcomer, there will be souls saved through your efforts, [247]\nby your self-denial, your good words and consistent Christian life.\nAnd when the rewards are finally distributed to all as their works\n236 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nhave been, redeemed souls will call you blessed, and the Master will\nsay: \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant,\u201d \u201center thou into the joy\nof thy Lord.\u201d\nThe world is indeed full of hurry, and of pride, selfishness,\navarice, and violence; and it may seem to us that it is a waste of\ntime and breath to be ever in season and out of season, and on all\noccasions to hold ourselves in readiness to speak words that are\ngentle, pure, elevating, chaste, and holy, in the face of the whirlwind\nof confusion, bustle, and strife. And yet words fitly spoken, coming\nfrom sanctified hearts and lips, and sustained by a godly, consistent\nChristian deportment, will be as apples of gold in pictures of silver.\nYou have been as one of the vain talkers and have appeared as one\nof the world. You have sometimes been careless in your words and\nreckless in your conversation and have lowered yourself as a Chris-\ntian in the opinion of unbelievers. You have sometimes spoken of the\ntruth; but your words have not borne that serious, anxious interest\nthat would affect the heart. They have been accompanied with light,\ntrivial remarks that would lead those with whom you converse to\ndecide that your faith is not genuine and that you do not believe\nthe truths you profess. Words in favor of the truth, spoken in the\ncalm self-possession of a right purpose and from a pure heart, will\ndo much to disarm opposition and win souls. But a harsh, selfish,\ndenunciatory spirit will only drive further from the truth and awaken\na spirit of opposition.\nYou are not to wait for great occasions, or to expect extraordinary\nabilities, before you work in earnest for God. You need not have a\nthought of what the world will think of you. If your intercourse with\nthem and your godly conversation are a living testimony to them of\nthe purity and sincerity of your faith, and they are convinced that\nyou desire to benefit them, your words will not be wholly lost upon\nthem, but will be productive of good.\nA servant of Christ, in any department of the Christian service,[248]\nwill by precept and by example have a saving influence upon others.\nThe good seed sown may lie some time in a cold, worldly, selfish\nheart without evidencing that it has taken root; but frequently the\nSpirit of God operates upon that heart and waters it with the dew\nof heaven, and the long-hidden seed springs up and finally bears\nfruit to the glory of God. We know not in our lifework which shall\nInordinate Love of Gain 237\nprosper, this or that. These are not questions for us poor mortals to\nsettle. We are to do our work, leaving the result with God. If you\nwere in darkness and ignorance, you would not be as guilty. But you\nhave had great light, you have heard much truth; but you are not a\ndoer of the word.\nChrist\u2019s life is the pattern for us all. His example of self-denial,\nself-sacrifice, and disinterested benevolence is for us to follow. His\nentire life is an infinite demonstration of His great love and con-\ndescension to save sinful man. \u201cLove one another, as I have loved\nyou,\u201d says Christ. How will our life of self-denial, sacrifice, and\nbenevolence bear comparison with the life of Christ? \u201cYe are,\u201d says\nChrist, addressing His disciples, \u201cthe light of the world.\u201d \u201cYe are the\nsalt of the earth.\u201d If this is our privilege and also our duty, and we\nare bodies of darkness and of unbelief, what a fearful responsibility\nwe assume! We may be channels of light or of darkness. If we\nhave neglected to improve the light that God had given us, and have\nfailed to advance in knowledge and true holiness as the light has\ndirected the way, we are guilty and in darkness according to the light\nand truth we have neglected to improve. In these days of iniquity\nand peril the characters and works of professed Christians will not\ngenerally bear the test nor endure the exposure when examined by\nthe light that now shines upon them. There is no concord between\nChrist and Belial; there is no communion between light and dark-\nness. How, then, can the spirit of Christ and the spirit of the world\nbe in harmony? The Lord our God is a jealous God. He requires the\nsincere affection and unreserved confidence of those who profess to\nlove Him. Says the psalmist: \u201cIf I regard iniquity in my heart, the [249]\nLord will not hear me.\u201d\nYou have stood directly in the way of the salvation of your\nchildren. You lay their indifference to religious things to other\ncauses than the true. Your example is a stumbling block to them.\nThey know by your fruits, by your words and works, that you do not\nbelieve in the near coming of Christ. Some of them do not hesitate\nto make sport of the idea of the near coming of Christ and of the\nshortness of time. They take great satisfaction when you drive a\nsharp bargain. They think that father is keen in a trade and that\nnobody can get the better of him, and they are following in your\nfootsteps. Faith without works is dead, being alone. Money has\n238 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ngiven you power, and you have used that power to take advantage\nof the necessities of others. Your speculations in business life have\nnot been honest, you have not been just with your fellow men. By\nyour trades you have sacrificed your reputation as a Christian and\nas an honest man. By fair trading, means did not come into your\npossession fast enough to satisfy your thirst for gain, and you have\nfrequently made the poor man\u2019s burdens heavier by taking advantage\nof his necessity to increase your property. Look carefully, Brother S.\nYou are making fearful losses for earthly gain. You are losing manly\nintegrity and heavenly virtue, in the hour of temptation. Is this gain\nor loss? Are you richer or poorer for all such increase? To you it is\na fearful loss, for it takes just so much from the treasure you might\nhave been accumulating in heaven.\nEvery opportunity to help a brother in need, or to aid the cause of\nGod in the spread of the truth, is a pearl that you can send beforehand\nand deposit in the bank of heaven for safekeeping. God is testing\nand proving you. He has been giving His blessings to you with a\nlavish hand and is now watching to see what use you are making of\nthem, to see if you will help those who need help and if you will\nfeel the worth of souls and do what you can with the means that\nHe has entrusted to you. Every such opportunity improved adds\nto your heavenly treasure. But love of self has led you to prefer[250]\nearthly possessions even at the sacrifice of the heavenly. You choose\nthe treasures that moth and rust corrupt rather than those which\nare as enduring as eternity. It is your privilege to exercise tender\ncompassion and to bless others; but your eyes are so blinded by\nthe god of this world that you cannot discern this precious gem\u2014\nthe blessing to be received by doing good, by being rich in good\nworks, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, laying up for\nyourself a good foundation against the time to come, that you may\nlay hold on eternal life. You are imperiling your soul by neglecting\nto avail yourself of precious opportunities to secure the heavenly\ntreasure. Are you really richer for your penuriousness, for your\nclose managing? God is proving you, and it is for you to determine\nwhether you will come out gold or valueless dross. Should your\nprobation close tonight, how would your life record stand? Not a\ndollar of what you have gained could you take with you. The curse\nof every unjust act would attend you. Your sharpness in trade, when\nInordinate Love of Gain 239\nviewed in the mirror that God will present before you, will not lead\nto self-congratulation. Covetousness is idolatry.\nYour only hope is to humble your heart before God. \u201cFor what\nshall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his\nown soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d I\nentreat of you: Do not close your eyes to your danger. Do not be\nblind to the higher interests of the soul, to the blessed and glorious\nprospects for the better life. The anxious, burdened seekers for\nworldly gain are blind and insane. They turn from the immortal,\nimperishable treasure, to this world. The glitter and tinsel of this\nworld captivate their senses, and eternal things are not valued. They\nlabor for that which satisfieth not and spend their money for that\nwhich is not bread, when Jesus offers them peace and hope and\ninfinite blessings, for a life of obedience. All the treasures of the\nearth would not be rich enough to buy these precious gifts. Yet\nmany are insane and turn from the heavenly inducement. Christ [251]\nwill keep the names of all who count no sacrifice too costly to be\noffered to Him upon the altar of faith and love. He sacrificed all for\nfallen humanity. The names of the obedient, self-sacrificing, and\nfaithful will be engraved upon the palms of His hands; they will not\nbe spewed from His mouth, but be taken in His lips, and He will\nspecially plead in their behalf before the Father. When the selfish\nand proud are forgotten, they will be remembered; their names will\nbe immortalized. In order to be happy ourselves, we must live to\nmake others happy. It is well for us to yield our possessions, our\ntalents, and our affections in grateful devotion to Christ, and in that\nway find happiness here and immortal glory hereafter.\nThe long night of watching, of toil and hardship, is nearly past.\nChrist is soon to come. Get ready. The angels of God are seeking\nto attract you from yourself and from earthly things. Let them not\nlabor in vain. Faith, living faith, is what you need; faith that works\nby love and purifies the soul. Remember Calvary and the awful, the\ninfinite sacrifice there made for man. Jesus now invites you to come\nto Him just as you are and make Him your strength and everlasting\nFriend.\n240 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nNumber Twenty-Three\u2014Testimony for the [252]\nChurch\nChapter 27\u2014The Laodicean Church\nThe message to the church of the Laodiceans is a startling de-\nnunciation, and is applicable to the people of God at the present\ntime.\n\u201cAnd unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write: These\nthings saith the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning\nof the creation of God; I know thy works, that thou art neither cold\nnor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art\nlukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of My\nmouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods,\nand have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched,\nand miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\u201d\nThe Lord here shows us that the message to be borne to His\npeople by ministers whom He has called to warn the people is not a\npeace-and-safety message. It is not merely theoretical, but practical\nin every particular. The people of God are represented in the message\nto the Laodiceans as in a position of carnal security. They are at\nease, believing themselves to be in an exalted condition of spiritual\nattainments. \u201cBecause thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with\ngoods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art\nwretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\u201d\nWhat greater deception can come upon human minds than a[253]\nconfidence that they are right when they are all wrong! The message\nof the True Witness finds the people of God in a sad deception,\nyet honest in that deception. They know not that their condition is\ndeplorable in the sight of God. While those addressed are flatter-\ning themselves that they are in an exalted spiritual condition, the\nmessage of the True Witness breaks their security by the startling\ndenunciation of their true condition of spiritual blindness, poverty,\nand wretchedness. The testimony, so cutting and severe, cannot be a\nmistake, for it is the True Witness who speaks, and His testimony\nmust be correct.\n242\nLaodicean Church 243\nIt is difficult for those who feel secure in their attainments, and\nwho believe themselves to be rich in spiritual knowledge, to receive\nthe message which declares that they are deceived and in need of\nevery spiritual grace. The unsanctified heart is \u201cdeceitful above\nall things, and desperately wicked.\u201d I was shown that many are\nflattering themselves that they are good Christians, who have not\na ray of light from Jesus. They have not a living experience for\nthemselves in the divine life. They need a deep and thorough work\nof self-abasement before God before they will feel their true need of\nearnest, persevering effort to secure the precious graces of the Spirit.\nGod leads His people on step by step. The Christian life is a\nconstant battle and a march. There is no rest from the warfare. It\nis by constant, unceasing effort that we maintain the victory over\nthe temptations of Satan. As a people we are triumphing in the\nclearness and strength of the truth. We are fully sustained in our\npositions by an overwhelming amount of plain Scriptural testimony.\nBut we are very much wanting in Bible humility, patience, faith,\nlove, self-denial, watchfulness, and the spirit of sacrifice. We need to\ncultivate Bible holiness. Sin prevails among the people of God. The\nplain message of rebuke to the Laodiceans is not received. Many\ncling to their doubts and their darling sins while they are in so great\na deception as to talk and feel that they are in need of nothing. They\nthink the testimony of the Spirit of God in reproof is uncalled for [254]\nor that it does not mean them. Such are in the greatest need of\nthe grace of God and spiritual discernment that they may discover\ntheir deficiency in spiritual knowledge. They lack almost every\nqualification necessary to perfect Christian character. They have not\na practical knowledge of Bible truth, which leads to lowliness of\nlife and a conformity of their will to the will of Christ. They are not\nliving in obedience to all God\u2019s requirements.\nIt is not enough to merely profess to believe the truth. All the\nsoldiers of the cross of Christ virtually obligate themselves to enter\nthe crusade against the adversary of souls, to condemn wrong and\nsustain righteousness. But the message of the True Witness reveals\nthe fact that a terrible deception is upon our people, which makes\nit necessary to come to them with warnings, to break their spiritual\nslumber, and arouse them to decided action.\n244 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nIn my last vision I was shown that even this decided message\nof the True Witness had not accomplished the design of God. The\npeople slumber on in their sins. They continue to declare themselves\nrich and having need of nothing. Many inquire: Why are all these\nreproofs given? Why do the Testimonies continually charge us\nwith backsliding and with grievous sins? We love the truth; we are\nprospering; we are in no need of these testimonies of warning and\nreproof. But let these murmurers see their hearts and compare their\nlives with the practical teachings of the Bible, let them humble their\nsouls before God, let the grace of God illuminate the darkness, and\nthe scales will fall from their eyes, and they will realize their true\nspiritual poverty and wretchedness. They will feel the necessity of\nbuying gold, which is pure faith and love; white raiment, which is a\nspotless character made pure in the blood of their dear Redeemer;\nand eyesalve, which is the grace of God and which will give clear\ndiscernment of spiritual things and detect sin. These attainments are\nmore precious than the gold of Ophir.\nI have been shown that the greatest reason why the people of[255]\nGod are now found in this state of spiritual blindness is that they\nwill not receive correction. Many have despised the reproofs and\nwarnings given them. The True Witness condemns the lukewarm\ncondition of the people of God, which gives Satan great power over\nthem in this waiting, watching time. The selfish, the proud, and\nthe lovers of sin are ever assailed with doubts. Satan has ability to\nsuggest doubts and to devise objections to the pointed testimony\nthat God sends, and many think it a virtue, a mark of intelligence\nin them, to be unbelieving and to question and quibble. Those who\ndesire to doubt will have plenty of room. God does not propose to\nremove all occasion for unbelief. He gives evidence, which must\nbe carefully investigated with a humble mind and a teachable spirit,\nand all should decide from the weight of evidence.\nEternal life is of infinite value and will cost us all that we have.\nI was shown that we do not place a proper estimate upon eternal\nthings. Everything worth possessing, even in this world, must be\nsecured by effort, and sometimes by most painful sacrifice. And this\nis merely to obtain a perishable treasure. Shall we be less willing\nto endure conflict and toil, and to make earnest efforts and great\nsacrifices, to obtain a treasure which is of infinite value, and a life\nLaodicean Church 245\nwhich will measure with that of the Infinite? Can heaven cost us too\nmuch?\nFaith and love are golden treasures, elements that are greatly\nwanting among God\u2019s people. I have been shown that unbelief in\nthe testimonies of warning, encouragement, and reproof is shutting\naway the light from God\u2019s people. Unbelief is closing their eyes so\nthat they are ignorant of their true condition. The True Witness thus\ndescribes their blindness: \u201cAnd knowest not that thou art wretched,\nand miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\u201d\nFaith in the soon coming of Christ is waning. \u201cMy Lord delayeth\nHis coming\u201d is not only said in the heart, but expressed in words\nand most decidedly in works. Stupidity in this watching time is\nsealing the senses of God\u2019s people as to the signs of the times. The [256]\nterrible iniquity which abounds calls for the greatest diligence and\nfor the living testimony, to keep sin out of the church. Faith has been\ndecreasing to a fearful degree, and it is only by exercise that it can\nincrease.\nIn the rise of the third angel\u2019s message those who engaged in\nthe work of God had something to venture; they had sacrifices to\nmake. They started this work in poverty and suffered the greatest\ndeprivations and reproach. They met determined opposition, which\ndrove them to God in their necessity and kept their faith alive. Our\npresent plan of systematic benevolence amply sustains our ministers,\nand there is no want and no call for the exercise of faith as to a\nsupport. Those who start out now to preach the truth have nothing\nto venture. They have no risks to run, no special sacrifices to make.\nThe system of truth is made ready to their hand, and publications\nare provided for them, vindicating the truths they advance.\nSome young men start out with no real sense of the exalted\ncharacter of the work. They have no privations, hardships, or severe\nconflicts to meet, which would call for the exercise of faith. They\ndo not cultivate practical self-denial and cherish a spirit of sacrifice.\nSome are becoming proud and lifted up, and have no real burden of\nthe work upon them. The True Witness speaks to these ministers:\n\u201cBe zealous therefore, and repent.\u201d Some of them are so lifted up\nin pride that they are really a hindrance and a curse to the precious\ncause of God. They do not exert a saving influence upon others.\n246 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nThese men need to be thoroughly converted to God themselves and\nsanctified by the truths they present to others.\nPointed Testimonies in the Church\nVery many feel impatient and jealous because they are frequently\ndisturbed with warnings and reproofs which keep their sins before\nthem. Says the True Witness: \u201cI know thy works.\u201d The motives,\nthe purposes, the unbelief, the suspicions and jealousies may be\nhid from men, but not from Christ. The True Witness comes as a[257]\ncounselor: \u201cI counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that\nthou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed,\nand that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine\neyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke\nand chasten; be zealous therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand at the\ndoor, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I\nwill come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me. To him\nthat overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I\nalso overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.\u201d\nThose who are reproved by the Spirit of God should not rise up\nagainst the humble instrument. It is God, and not an erring mortal,\nwho has spoken to save them from ruin. Those who despise the\nwarning will be left in blindness to become self-deceived. But those\nwho heed it, and zealously go about the work of separating their sins\nfrom them in order to have the needed graces, will be opening the\ndoor of their hearts that the dear Saviour may come in and dwell\nwith them. This class you will ever find in perfect harmony with the\ntestimony of the Spirit of God.\nMinisters who are preaching present truth should not neglect\nthe solemn message to the Laodiceans. The testimony of the True\nWitness is not a smooth message. The Lord does not say to them,\nYou are about right; you have borne chastisement and reproof that\nyou never deserved; you have been unnecessarily discouraged by\nseverity; you are not guilty of the wrongs and sins for which you\nhave been reproved.\nThe True Witness declares that when you suppose you are really\nin a good condition of prosperity you are in need of everything.\nIt is not enough for ministers to present theoretical subjects; they\nLaodicean Church 247\nshould also present those subjects which are practical. They need to\nstudy the practical lessons that Christ gave His disciples and make a\nclose application of the same to their own souls and to the people.\nBecause Christ bears this rebuking testimony, shall we suppose that\nHe is destitute of tender love to His people? Oh, no! He who died to [258]\nredeem man from death, loves with a divine love, and those whom\nHe loves He rebukes. \u201cAs many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.\u201d But\nmany will not receive the message that Heaven in mercy sends them.\nThey cannot endure to be told of their neglect of duty and of their\nwrongs, their selfishness, their pride and love of the world.\nI was shown that God has laid upon my husband and me a special\nwork, to bear a plain testimony to His people, and to cry aloud and\nspare not, to show the people their transgressions and the house\nof Israel their sins. But there is a class who will not receive the\nmessage of reproof, and they raise their hands to shield those whom\nGod would reprove and correct. These are ever found sympathizing\nwith those whom God would make to feel their true poverty.\nThe word of the Lord, spoken through His servants, is received\nby many with questionings and fears. And many will defer their\nobedience to the warning and reproofs given, waiting till every\nshadow of uncertainty is removed from their minds. The unbelief\nthat demands perfect knowledge will never yield to the evidence that\nGod is pleased to give. He requires of His people faith that rests\nupon the weight of evidence, not upon perfect knowledge. Those\nfollowers of Christ who accept the light that God sends them must\nobey the voice of God speaking to them when there are many other\nvoices crying out against it. It requires discernment to distinguish\nthe voice of God.\nThose who will not act when the Lord calls upon them, but who\nwait for more certain evidence and more favorable opportunities,\nwill walk in darkness, for the light will be withdrawn. The evidence\ngiven one day, if rejected, may never be repeated.\nMany are tempted in regard to our work and are calling it in\nquestion. Some, in their tempted condition, charge the difficulties\nand perplexities of the people of God to the testimonies of reproof\nthat we have given them. They think the trouble is with the ones\nwho bear the message of warning, who point out the sins of the [259]\npeople and correct their errors. Many are deceived by the adversary\n248 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nof souls. They think that the labors of Brother and Sister White\nwould be acceptable if they were not continually condemning wrong\nand reproving sin. I was shown that God has laid this work upon\nus, and when we are hindered from meeting with His people and\nfrom bearing our testimony and counteracting the surmisings and\njealousies of the unconsecrated, then Satan presses in his tempta-\ntions very strongly. Those who have been ever on the questioning,\ndoubting side feel at liberty to suggest their doubts and to insinuate\ntheir unbelief. Some have sanctimonious and apparently conscien-\ntious and very pious doubts, which they cautiously drop, but which\nhave tenfold more power to strengthen those who are wrong, and\nto lessen our influence and weaken the confidence of God\u2019s people\nin our work, than if they came out more frankly. These poor souls,\nI saw, were deceived by Satan. They flatter themselves that they\nare all right, that they are in favor with God and are rich in spiritual\ndiscernment, when they are poor, blind, and wretched. They are\ndoing the work of Satan, but think they have a zeal for God.\nSome will not receive the testimony that God has given us to\nbear, flattering themselves that we may be deceived and that they\nmay be right. They think that the people of God are not in need\nof plain dealing and of reproof, but that God is with them. These\ntempted ones, whose souls have ever been at war with the faithful\nreproving of sin, would cry: Speak unto us smooth things. What\ndisposition will these make of the message of the True Witness to\nthe Laodiceans? There can be no deception here. This message must\nbe borne to a lukewarm church by God\u2019s servants. It must arouse\nHis people from their security and dangerous deception in regard\nto their real standing before God. This testimony, if received, will\narouse to action and lead to self-abasement and confession of sins.\nThe True Witness says: \u201cI know thy works, that thou art neither cold\nnor hot.\u201d And again, \u201cAs many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be[260]\nzealous therefore, and repent.\u201d Then comes the promise: \u201cBehold, I\nstand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open\nthe door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with\nMe.\u201d \u201cTo him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My\nthrone, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in\nHis throne.\u201d\nLaodicean Church 249\nThe people of God must see their wrongs and arouse to zealous\nrepentance and a putting away of those sins which have brought them\ninto such a deplorable condition of poverty, blindness, wretchedness,\nand fearful deception. I was shown that the pointed testimony must\nlive in the church. This alone will answer to the message to the\nLaodiceans. Wrongs must be reproved, sin must be called sin, and\niniquity must be met promptly and decidedly, and put away from us\nas a people.\nFighting the Spirit of God\nThose who have a spirit of opposition to the work that for twenty-\nsix years we have been pressed by the Spirit of God to do, and who\nwould break down our testimony, I saw are not fighting against us,\nbut against God, who has laid upon us the burden of a work that He\nhas not given to others. Those who question and quibble, and think\nit a virtue to doubt, and who would discourage; those who have been\nthe means of making our work hard and of weakening our faith,\nhope, and courage have been the ones to surmise evil, to insinuate\nsuspicious charges, and to watch with jealousy for occasion against\nus. They take it for granted that because we have human weaknesses\nit is a positive evidence that we are wrong and that they are right.\nIf they can find a semblance of anything that they can use to injure\nus they do it with a spirit of triumph and are ready to denounce our\nwork of reproving wrong and condemning sin as a harsh, dictatorial\nspirit.\nBut while we do not accept their version of our case as the reason\nfor our afflictions, while we maintain that God has appointed us to a\nmore trying work than He has others, we acknowledge with humility [261]\nof soul and with repentance that our faith and courage have been\nseverely tried and that we have sometimes failed to trust wholly\nin Him who has appointed us our work. When we gather courage\nagain, after sore disappointment and trials, we deeply regret that we\never distrusted God, gave way to human weaknesses, and permitted\ndiscouragement to cloud our faith and lessen our confidence in God.\nI have been shown that God\u2019s ancient servants suffered disappoint-\nments and discouragements as well as we poor mortals. We were in\ngood company; nevertheless this did not excuse us.\n250 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nAs my husband has stood by my side to sustain me in my work\nand has borne a plain testimony in unison with the work of the Spirit\nof God, many have felt that it was he personally who was injuring\nthem, when it was the Lord who laid upon him the burden and who\nwas, through His servant, reproving them and seeking to bring them\nwhere they would repent of their wrongs and have the favor of God.\nThose whom God has chosen for an important work have ever\nbeen received with distrust and suspicion. Anciently, when Elijah\nwas sent with a message from God to the people, they did not heed\nthe warning. They thought him unnecessarily severe. They even\nthought that he must have lost his senses because he denounced\nthem, the favored people of God, as sinners and their crimes as so\naggravated that the judgments of God would awaken against them.\nSatan and his host have ever been arrayed against those who bear\nthe message of warning and who reprove sins. The unconsecrated\nwill also be united with the adversary of souls to make the work of\nGod\u2019s faithful servants as hard as possible.\nIf my husband has been pressed beyond measure and has be-\ncome discouraged and desponding, if we have at times seen nothing\ndesirable in life that we should choose it, this is nothing strange or\nnew. Elijah, one of God\u2019s great and mighty prophets, as he fled for\nhis life from the rage of the infuriated Jezebel, a fugitive, weary and\ntravel-worn, desired to die rather than to live. His bitter disappoint-[262]\nment in regard to Israel\u2019s faithfulness had crushed his spirits, and\nhe felt that he could no longer put confidence in man. In the day of\nJob\u2019s affliction and darkness, he utters these words: \u201cLet the day\nperish wherein I was born.\u201d\nThose who are not accustomed to feel to the very depths, who\nhave not stood under burdens as a cart beneath sheaves, and who\nhave never had their interest identified so closely with the cause and\nwork of God that it seems to be a part of their very being and dearer\nto them than life, cannot appreciate the feelings of my husband any\nmore than Israel could appreciate the feelings of Elijah. We deeply\nregret being disheartened, whatever the circumstances may have\nbeen.\nLaodicean Church 251\nAhab\u2019s Case a Warning\nUnder the perverted rule of Ahab, Israel departed from God and\ncorrupted their ways before Him. \u201cAnd Ahab the son of Omri did\nevil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him. And it\ncame to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the\nsins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the\ndaughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal,\nand worshiped him. And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house\nof Baal, which he had built in Samaria. And Ahab made a grove;\nand Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than\nall the kings of Israel that were before him.\u201d\nAhab was weak in moral power. He did not have a high sense of\nsacred things; he was selfish and unprincipled. His union by mar-\nriage with a woman of decided character and positive temperament,\nwho was devoted to idolatry, made them both special agents of Satan\nto lead the people of God into idolatry and terrible apostasy. The\ndetermined spirit of Jezebel molded the character of Ahab. His self-\nish nature was incapable of appreciating the mercies of God to His\npeople and his obligation to God as the guardian and leader of Israel.\nThe fear of God was daily growing less in Israel. The blasphemous\ntokens of their blind idolatry were to be seen among the Israel of [263]\nGod. There were none who dared to expose their lives by openly\nstanding forth in opposition to the prevailing blasphemous idolatry.\nThe altars of Baal, and the priests of Baal who sacrificed to the sun,\nmoon, and stars, were conspicuous everywhere. They had conse-\ncrated temples and groves wherein the work of men\u2019s hands was\nplaced to be worshiped. The benefits which God gave to this people\ncalled forth from them no gratitude to the Giver. All the bounties\nof heaven,\u2014the running brooks, the streams of living waters, the\ngentle dew, the showers of rain which refreshed the earth and caused\ntheir fields to bring forth abundantly,\u2014these they ascribed to the\nfavor of their gods.\nElijah\u2019s faithful soul was grieved. His indignation was aroused,\nand he was jealous for the glory of God. He saw that Israel was\nplunged into fearful apostasy. And when he called to mind the great\nthings that God had wrought for them, he was overwhelmed with\ngrief and amazement. But all this was forgotten by the majority\n252 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nof the people. He went before the Lord, and, with his soul wrung\nwith anguish, pleaded for Him to save His people if it must be by\njudgments. He pleaded with God to withhold from His ungrateful\npeople dew and rain, the treasures of heaven, that apostate Israel\nmight look in vain to their gods, their idols of gold, wood, and stone,\nthe sun, moon, and stars, to water and enrich the earth, and cause it\nto bring forth plentifully. The Lord told Elijah that He had heard his\nprayer and would withhold dew and rain from His people until they\nshould turn unto Him with repentance.\nAchan\u2019s Sin and Punishment\nGod had specially guarded His people against mingling with the\nidolatrous nations around them, lest their hearts should be deceived\nby the attractive groves and shrines, temples and altars, which were\narranged in the most expensive, alluring manner to pervert the senses\nso that God would be supplanted in the minds of the people.\nThe city of Jericho was devoted to the most extravagant idolatry.[264]\nThe inhabitants were very wealthy, but all the riches that God had\ngiven them they counted as the gift of their gods. They had gold\nand silver in abundance; but, like the people before the Flood, they\nwere corrupt and blasphemous, and insulted and provoked the God\nof heaven by their wicked works. God\u2019s judgments were awakened\nagainst Jericho. It was a stronghold. But the Captain of the Lord\u2019s\nhost Himself came from heaven to lead the armies of heaven in\nan attack upon the city. Angels of God laid hold of the massive\nwalls and brought them to the ground. God had said that the city of\nJericho should be accursed and that all should perish except Rahab\nand her household. These should be saved because of the favor that\nRahab showed the messengers of the Lord. The word of the Lord\nto the people was: \u201cAnd ye, in anywise keep yourselves from the\naccursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of\nthe accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble\nit.\u201d \u201cAnd Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the\nman before the Lord, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he\nshall lay the foundation thereof in his first-born, and in his youngest\nson shall he set up the gates of it.\u201d\nLaodicean Church 253\nGod was very particular in regard to Jericho, lest the people\nshould be charmed with the things that the inhabitants had worshiped\nand their hearts be diverted from God. He guarded His people by\nmost positive commands; yet notwithstanding the solemn injunction\nfrom God by the mouth of Joshua, Achan ventured to transgress. His\ncovetousness led him to take of the treasures that God had forbidden\nhim to touch because the curse of God was upon them. And because\nof this man\u2019s sin the Israel of God were as weak as water before\ntheir enemies.\nJoshua and the elders of Israel were in great affliction. They\nlay before the ark of God in most abject humility because the Lord\nwas wroth with His people. They prayed and wept before God. The\nLord spoke to Joshua: \u201cGet thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon [265]\nthy face? Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed My\ncovenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the\naccursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they\nhave put it even among their own stuff. Therefore the children of\nIsrael could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs\nbefore their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I\nbe with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among\nyou.\u201d\nDuty to Reprove Sin\nI have been shown that God here illustrates how He regards\nsin among those who profess to be His commandment-keeping\npeople. Those whom He has specially honored with witnessing the\nremarkable exhibitions of His power, as did ancient Israel, and who\nwill even then venture to disregard His express directions, will be\nsubjects of His wrath. He would teach His people that disobedience\nand sin are exceedingly offensive to Him and are not to be lightly\nregarded. He shows us that when His people are found in sin they\nshould at once take decided measures to put that sin from them,\nthat His frown may not rest upon them all. But if the sins of the\npeople are passed over by those in responsible positions, His frown\nwill be upon them, and the people of God, as a body, will be held\nresponsible for those sins. In His dealings with His people in the past\nthe Lord shows the necessity of purifying the church from wrongs.\n254 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nOne sinner may diffuse darkness that will exclude the light of God\nfrom the entire congregation. When the people realize that darkness\nis settling upon them, and they do not know the cause, they should\nseek God earnestly, in great humility and self-abasement, until the\nwrongs which grieve His Spirit are searched out and put away.\nThe prejudice which has arisen against us because we have\nreproved the wrongs that God has shown me existed, and the cry\nthat has been raised of harshness and severity, are unjust. God bids\nus speak, and we will not be silent. If wrongs are apparent among[266]\nHis people, and if the servants of God pass on indifferent to them,\nthey virtually sustain and justify the sinner, and are alike guilty and\nwill just as surely receive the displeasure of God; for they will be\nmade responsible for the sins of the guilty. In vision I have been\npointed to many instances where the displeasure of God has been\nincurred by a neglect on the part of His servants to deal with the\nwrongs and sins existing among them. Those who have excused\nthese wrongs have been thought by the people to be very amiable\nand lovely in disposition, simply because they shunned to discharge\na plain Scriptural duty. The task was not agreeable to their feelings;\ntherefore they avoided it.\nThe spirit of hatred which has existed with some because the\nwrongs among God\u2019s people have been reproved has brought blind-\nness and a fearful deception upon their own souls, making it impos-\nsible for them to discriminate between right and wrong. They have\nput out their own spiritual eyesight. They may witness wrongs, but\nthey do not feel as did Joshua and humble themselves because the\ndanger of souls is felt by them.\nThe true people of God, who have the spirit of the work of the\nLord and the salvation of souls at heart, will ever view sin in its\nreal, sinful character. They will always be on the side of faithful\nand plain dealing with sins which easily beset the people of God.\nEspecially in the closing work for the church, in the sealing time of\nthe one hundred and forty-four thousand who are to stand without\nfault before the throne of God, will they feel most deeply the wrongs\nof God\u2019s professed people. This is forcibly set forth by the prophet\u2019s\nillustration of the last work under the figure of the men each having\na slaughter weapon in his hand. One man among them was clothed\nwith linen, with a writer\u2019s inkhorn by his side. \u201cAnd the Lord\nLaodicean Church 255\nsaid unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst\nof Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that\nsigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst\nthereof.\u201d\nWho are standing in the counsel of God at this time? Is it those [267]\nwho virtually excuse wrongs among the professed people of God\nand who murmur in their hearts, if not openly, against those who\nwould reprove sin? Is it those who take their stand against them and\nsympathize with those who commit wrong? No, indeed! Unless\nthey repent, and leave the work of Satan in oppressing those who\nhave the burden of the work and in holding up the hands of sinners\nin Zion, they will never receive the mark of God\u2019s sealing approval.\nThey will fall in the general destruction of the wicked, represented\nby the work of the five men bearing slaughter weapons. Mark this\npoint with care: Those who receive the pure mark of truth, wrought\nin them by the power of the Holy Ghost, represented by a mark\nby the man in linen, are those \u201cthat sigh and that cry for all the\nabominations that be done\u201d in the church. Their love for purity and\nthe honor and glory of God is such, and they have so clear a view of\nthe exceeding sinfulness of sin, that they are represented as being in\nagony, even sighing and crying. Read the ninth chapter of Ezekiel.\nBut the general slaughter of all those who do not thus see the\nwide contrast between sin and righteousness, and do not feel as\nthose do who stand in the counsel of God and receive the mark,\nis described in the order to the five men with slaughter weapons:\n\u201cGo ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare,\nneither have ye pity: slay utterly old and young, both maids, and\nlittle children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom\nis the mark; and begin at My sanctuary.\u201d\nIn the case of Achan\u2019s sin God said to Joshua: \u201cNeither will I\nbe with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among\nyou.\u201d How does this instance compare with the course pursued\nby those who will not raise their voice against sin and wrong, but\nwhose sympathies are ever found with those who trouble the camp\nof Israel with their sins? Said God to Joshua: \u201cThou canst not stand\nbefore thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from\namong you.\u201d He pronounced the punishment which would follow [268]\nthe transgression of His covenant.\n256 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nJoshua then began a diligent search to find out the guilty one. He\ntook Israel by their tribes, then by their families, and next individu-\nally; and Achan was designated as the guilty one. But that the matter\nmight be plain to all Israel, that there should be no occasion given\nthem to murmur and to say that the guiltless was made to suffer,\nJoshua used policy. He knew Achan was the transgressor and that he\nhad concealed his sin and provoked God against His people. Joshua\ndiscreetly induced Achan to make confession of his sin, that God\u2019s\nhonor and justice might be vindicated before Israel. \u201cAnd Joshua\nsaid unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of\nIsrael, and make confession unto Him; and tell me now what thou\nhast done; hide it not from me.\n\u201cAnd Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned\nagainst the Lord God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: When I\nsaw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred\nshekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then\nI coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the\nearth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it. So Joshua sent\nmessengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his\ntent, and the silver under it. And they took them out of the midst\nof the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children\nof Israel, and laid them out before the Lord. And Joshua, and all\nIsrael with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the\ngarment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and\nhis oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he\nhad: and they brought them unto the Valley of Achor. And Joshua\nsaid, Why hast thou troubled us? the Lord shall trouble thee this\nday. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with\nfire, after they had stoned them with stones.\u201d\nThe Lord told Joshua that Achan had not only taken the things\nwhich He had positively charged them not to take, lest they be[269]\naccursed, but he had stolen and had also dissembled. The Lord said\nthat Jericho and all its spoils should be consumed, except the gold\nand silver, which were to be reserved for the treasury of the Lord.\nThe victory of taking Jericho was not obtained through warfare or\nthe exposure of the people. The Captain of the Lord\u2019s host had led\nthe armies of heaven. The battle was the Lord\u2019s; it was He who\nfought the battle. The children of Israel did not strike a blow. The\nLaodicean Church 257\nvictory and glory were the Lord\u2019s, and the spoils were His. He\ndirected all to be consumed except the gold and silver, which He\nreserved for His treasury. Achan understood well the reserve made\nand that the treasures of gold and silver which he coveted were the\nLord\u2019s. He stole from God\u2019s treasury for his own benefit.\nCovetousness Among God\u2019s People\nI saw that many who profess to be keeping the commandments\nof God are appropriating to their own use the means which the Lord\nhas entrusted to them and which should come into His treasury.\nThey rob God in tithes and in offerings. They dissemble and with-\nhold from Him to their own hurt. They bring leanness and poverty\nupon themselves and darkness upon the church because of their\ncovetousness, their dissembling, and their robbing God in tithes and\nin offerings.\nI saw that many souls will sink in darkness because of their\ncovetousness. The plain, straight testimony must live in the church,\nor the curse of God will rest upon His people as surely as it did upon\nancient Israel because of their sins. God holds His people, as a body,\nresponsible for the sins existing in individuals among them. If the\nleaders of the church neglect to diligently search out the sins which\nbring the displeasure of God upon the body, they become responsible\nfor these sins. But to deal with minds is the nicest work in which\nmen ever engaged. All are not fitted to correct the erring. They have\nnot wisdom to deal justly, while loving mercy. They are not inclined\nto see the necessity of mingling love and tender compassion with [270]\nfaithful reproofs. Some are ever needlessly severe, and do not feel\nthe necessity of the injunction of the apostle: \u201cAnd of some have\ncompassion, making a difference: and others save with fear, pulling\nthem out of the fire.\u201d\nThere are many who do not have the discretion of Joshua and\nwho have no special duty to search out wrongs and to deal promptly\nwith the sins existing among them. Let not such hinder those who\nhave the burden of this work upon them; let them not stand in the\nway of those who have this duty to do. Some make it a point to\nquestion and doubt and find fault because others do the work that\nGod has not laid upon them. These stand directly in the way to\n258 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nhinder those upon whom God has laid the burden of reproving and\ncorrecting prevailing sins in order that His frown may be turned\naway from His people. Should a case like Achan\u2019s be among us,\nthere are many who would accuse those who might act the part of\nJoshua in searching out the wrong, of having a wicked, fault-finding\nspirit. God is not to be trifled with and His warnings disregarded\nwith impunity by a perverse people.\nI was shown that the manner of Achan\u2019s confession was similar to\nthe confessions that some among us have made and will make. They\nhide their wrongs and refuse to make a voluntary confession until\nGod searches them out, and then they acknowledge their sins. A few\npersons pass on in a course of wrong until they become hardened.\nThey may even know that the church is burdened, as Achan knew\nthat Israel were made weak before their enemies because of his guilt.\nYet their consciences do not condemn them. They will not relieve the\nchurch by humbling their proud, rebellious hearts before God and\nputting away their wrongs. God\u2019s displeasure is upon His people,\nand He will not manifest His power in the midst of them while sins\nexist among them and are fostered by those in responsible positions.\nThose who work in the fear of God to rid the church of hindrances\nand to correct grievous wrongs, that the people of God may see\nthe necessity of abhorring sin and may prosper in purity, and that[271]\nthe name of God may be glorified, will ever meet with resisting\ninfluences from the unconsecrated. Zephaniah thus describes the\ntrue state of this class and the terrible judgments that will come upon\nthem:\n\u201cAnd it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search\nJerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on\ntheir lees: that say in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither\nwill He do evil.\u201d \u201cThe great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and\nhasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord: the mighty\nman shall cry there bitterly. That day is a day of wrath, a day of\ntrouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of\ndarkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, a day\nof the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the\nhigh towers. And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall\nwalk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord and\ntheir blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.\nLaodicean Church 259\nNeither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the\nday of the Lord\u2019s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the\nfire of His jealousy: for He shall make even a speedy riddance of all\nthem that dwell in the land.\u201d\nConfessions Made Too Late\nWhen a crisis finally comes, as it surely will, and God speaks in\nbehalf of His people, those who have sinned, those who have been a\ncloud of darkness and who have stood directly in the way of God\u2019s\nworking for His people, may become alarmed at the length they have\ngone in murmuring and in bringing discouragement upon the cause;\nand, like Achan, becoming terrified, they may acknowledge that they\nhave sinned. But their confessions are too late and are not of the\nright kind to benefit themselves, although they may relieve the cause\nof God. Such do not make their confessions because of a conviction\nof their true state and a sense of how displeasing their course has\nbeen to God. God may give this class another test, another proving, [272]\nand let them show that they are no better prepared to stand free from\nall rebellion and sin than before their confessions were made. They\nare inclined to be ever on the side of wrong. And when the call is\nmade for those who will be on the Lord\u2019s side to make a decided\nmove to vindicate the right, they will manifest their true position.\nThose who have been nearly all their lives controlled by a spirit as\nforeign to the Spirit of God as was Achan\u2019s will be very passive\nwhen the time comes for decided action on the part of all. They\nwill not claim to be on either side. The power of Satan has so long\nheld them that they seem blinded and have no inclination to stand\nin defense of right. If they do not take a determined course on the\nwrong side, it is not because they have a clear sense of the right, but\nbecause they dare not.\nGod will not be trifled with. It is in the time of conflict that the\ntrue colors should be flung to the breeze. It is then that the standard-\nbearers need to be firm and let their true position be known. It is\nthen that the skill of every true soldier for the right is tested. Shirkers\ncan never wear the laurels of victory. Those who are true and loyal\nwill not conceal the fact, but will put heart and might into the work,\nand venture their all in the struggle, let the battle turn as it will. God\n260 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nis a sin-hating God. And those who encourage the sinner, saying, It\nis well with thee, God will curse.\nConfessions of sin made at the right time to relieve the people\nof God will be accepted of Him. But there are those among us who\nwill make confessions, as did Achan, too late to save themselves.\nGod may prove them and give them another trial, for the sake of\nevidencing to His people that they will not endure one test, one\nproving of God. They are not in harmony with right. They despise\nthe straight testimony that reaches the heart, and would rejoice to\nsee everyone silenced who gives reproof.\nElijah Reproves Ahab[273]\nThe people of Israel had gradually lost their fear and reverence\nfor God until His word through Joshua had no weight with them.\n\u201cIn his [Ahab\u2019s] days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid\nthe foundation thereof in Abiram his first-born, and set up the gates\nthereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the Lord,\nwhich he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.\u201d\nWhile Israel was apostatizing, Elijah remained a loyal and true\nprophet of God. His faithful soul was greatly distressed as he saw\nthat unbelief and infidelity were fast separating the children of Israel\nfrom God, and he prayed that God would save His people. He\nentreated that the Lord would not wholly cast away His sinning\npeople, but that He would by judgments if necessary arouse them to\nrepentance and not permit them to go to still greater lengths in sin\nand thus provoke Him to destroy them as a nation.\nThe message of the Lord came to Elijah to go to Ahab with\nthe denunciations of His judgments because of the sins of Israel.\nElijah traveled day and night until he reached the palace of Ahab.\nHe solicited no admission, and waited not to be formally announced.\nAll unexpectedly to Ahab, Elijah stands before the astonished king\nof Samaria in the coarse garments usually worn by the prophets. He\nmakes no apology for his abrupt appearance, without invitation; but,\nraising his hands to heaven, he solemnly affirms by the living God,\nwho made the heavens and the earth, the judgments which would\ncome upon Israel: \u201cThere shall not be dew nor rain these years, but\naccording to my word.\u201d\nLaodicean Church 261\nThis startling denunciation of God\u2019s judgments because of the\nsins of Israel fell like a thunderbolt upon the apostate king. He\nseemed to be paralyzed with amazement and terror; and before he\ncould recover from his astonishment, Elijah, without waiting to see\nthe effect of his message, disappeared as suddenly as he came. His\nwork was to speak the word of woe from God, and he instantly [274]\nwithdrew. His word had locked up the treasures of heaven, and his\nword was the only key which could open them again.\nThe Lord knew that there was no safety for His servant among\nthe children of Israel. He would not trust him with apostate Israel,\nbut sent him to find an asylum among a heathen nation. He directed\nhim to a woman who was a widow and who was in such poverty that\nshe could barely sustain life with the most meager fare. A heathen\nwoman living up to the best light she had was in a more acceptable\nstate with God than the widows of Israel, who had been blessed with\nspecial privileges and great light, and yet did not live according to\nthe light which God had given them. As the Hebrews had rejected\nlight, they were left in darkness, and God would not trust His servant\namong His people, who had provoked His divine anger.\nNow there is an opportunity for apostate Ahab and pagan Jezebel\nto test the power of their gods and to prove the word of Elijah false.\nJezebel\u2019s prophets are numbered by hundreds. Against them all\nstands Elijah, alone. His word has locked heaven. If Baal can give\ndew and rain, and cause vegetation to flourish; if he can cause the\nbrooks and streams to flow on as usual, independent of the treasures\nof heaven in the showers of rain, then let the king of Israel worship\nhim and the people say that he is God.\nElijah was a man subject to like passions as ourselves. His\nmission to Ahab, and the terrible denunciation to him of the judg-\nments of God, required courage and faith. On his way to Samaria\nthe perpetually flowing streams, the hills covered with verdure, the\nforests of stately, flourishing trees,\u2014everything his eye rested upon\nflourishing in beauty and glory,\u2014would naturally suggest unbelief.\nHow can all these things in nature, now so flourishing, be burned\nwith drought? How can these streams that water the land and that\nhave never been known to cease their flow, become dry? But Elijah\ndid not cherish unbelief. He went forth on his mission at the peril\nof his life. He fully believed that God would humble His apostate [275]\n262 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\npeople and that through the visitation of His judgments He would\nbring them to humiliation and repentance. He ventured everything\nin the mission before him.\nWhen Ahab recovers in a degree from his astonishment at the\nwords of Elijah, the prophet is gone. He makes diligent inquiry for\nhim, but no one has seen him or can give any information respecting\nhim. Ahab informs Jezebel of the word of woe that Elijah has uttered\nin his presence, and her hatred against the prophet is expressed to\nthe priests of Baal. They unite with her in denouncing and cursing\nthe prophet of Jehovah. The news of the prophet\u2019s denunciations\nspread throughout the land, arousing the fears of some and the wrath\nof many.\nAfter a few months the earth, unrefreshed by dew or rain, be-\ncomes dry, and vegetation withers. The streams that have never been\nknown to cease their flow, decrease, and the brooks dry up. Jezebel\u2019s\nprophets offer sacrifices to their gods and call upon them night and\nday to refresh the earth by dew and rain. But the incantations and\ndeceptions formerly practiced by them to deceive the people do\nnot answer the purpose now. The priests have done everything to\nappease the anger of their gods; with a perseverance and zeal worthy\nof a better cause have they lingered around their pagan altars, while\nthe flames of sacrifice burn on all the high places, and the fearful\ncries and entreaties of the priests of Baal are heard night after night\nthrough doomed Samaria. But the clouds do not appear in the heav-\nens to cut off the burning rays of the sun. The word of Elijah stands\nfirm, and nothing that Baal\u2019s priests can do will change it.\nAn entire year passes, and another commences, and yet there is\nno rain. The earth is parched as though a fire had passed over it. The\nflourishing fields are as the scorching desert. The air becomes dry\nand suffocating, and the dust-storm blinds the eyes and nearly stops\nthe breath. The groves of Baal are leafless, and the forest trees give\nno shade, but appear as skeletons. Hunger and thirst are telling upon[276]\nman and beast with fearful mortality.\nAll this evidence of God\u2019s justice and judgment does not awaken\nIsrael to repentance. Jezebel is filled with insane madness. She will\nnot bend nor yield to the God of heaven. Baal\u2019s prophets, Ahab,\nJezebel, and nearly the whole of Israel, charge their calamity upon\nElijah. Ahab has sent to every kingdom and nation in search of\nLaodicean Church 263\nthe strange prophet and has required an oath of the kingdoms and\nnations of Israel that they know nothing in regard to him. Elijah had\nlocked heaven with his word and had taken the key with him, and he\ncould not be found.\nJezebel then decides that as she cannot make Elijah feel her\nmurderous power, she will be revenged by destroying the prophets\nof God in Israel. No one who professed to be a prophet of God\nshall live. This determined, infuriated woman executes her work of\nmadness by slaying the Lord\u2019s prophets. Baal\u2019s priests and nearly\nall Israel are so far deluded that they think that if the prophets of\nGod were slain, the calamity under which they are suffering would\nbe averted.\nBut the second year passes, and the pitiless heavens give no rain.\nDrought and famine are doing their sad work, and yet the apostate\nIsraelites do not humble their proud, sinful hearts before God; but\nthey murmur and complain against the prophet of God who brought\nthis dreadful state of things upon them. Fathers and mothers see\ntheir children perish, with no power to relieve them. And yet the\npeople are in such terrible darkness that they cannot see that the\njustice of God is awakened against them because of their sins and\nthat this terrible calamity is sent in mercy to them to save them from\nfully denying and forsaking the God of their fathers.\nIt cost Israel suffering and great affliction to be brought to that\nrepentance that was necessary in order to recover their lost faith\nand a clear sense of their responsibility to God. Their apostasy was\nmore dreadful than drought or famine. Elijah waited and prayed in\nfaith through the long years of drought and famine that the hearts of [277]\nIsrael, through their affliction, might be turned from their idolatry\nto allegiance to God. But notwithstanding all their sufferings, they\nstood firm in their idolatry and looked upon the prophet of God as\nthe cause of their calamity. And if they could have had Elijah in\ntheir power they would have delivered him to Jezebel, that she might\nsatisfy her revenge by taking his life. Because Elijah dared to utter\nthe word of woe which God bade him, he made himself the object of\ntheir hatred. They could not see God\u2019s hand in the judgments under\nwhich they were suffering because of their sins, but charged them\nto the man Elijah. They abhorred not the sins which had brought\n264 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthem under the chastening rod, but hated the faithful prophet, God\u2019s\ninstrument to denounce their sins and calamity.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass after many days, that the word of the Lord\ncame to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself unto Ahab;\nand I will send rain upon the earth.\u201d Elijah hesitates not to start on\nhis perilous journey. For three years he had been hated, and hunted\nfrom city to city by the mandate of the king, and the whole nation\nhave given their oath that he cannot be found. And now, by the word\nof God, he is to present himself before Ahab.\nDuring the apostasy of all Israel, and while his master is a wor-\nshiper of Baal, the governor of Ahab\u2019s house has proved faithful to\nGod. At the risk of his own life he has preserved the prophets of\nGod by hiding them by fifties in a cave and feeding them. While\nthe servant of Ahab is searching throughout the kingdom for springs\nand brooks of water, Elijah presents himself before him. Obadiah\nreverenced the prophet of God, but as Elijah sends him with a mes-\nsage to the king, he is greatly terrified. He sees danger and death\nto himself and also to Elijah. He pleads earnestly that his life may\nnot be sacrificed; but Elijah assures him with an oath that he will\nsee Ahab that day. The prophet will not go to Ahab but as one of\nGod\u2019s messengers, to command respect, and he sends a message by\nObadiah: \u201cBehold, Elijah is here.\u201d If Ahab wants to see Elijah, he[278]\nnow has the opportunity to come to him. Elijah will not go to Ahab.\nWith astonishment mingled with terror the king hears the mes-\nsage that Elijah whom he fears and hates, is coming to meet him.\nHe has long sought for the prophet that he might destroy him, and\nhe knows that Elijah would not expose his life to come to him un-\nless guarded or with some terrible denunciation. He remembers the\nwithered arm of Jeroboam and decides that it is not safe to lift up\nhis hand against the messenger of God. And with fear and trem-\nbling, and with a large retinue and an imposing display of armies,\nhe hastens to meet Elijah. And as he meets face to face the man\nwhom he has so long sought, he dares not harm him. The king,\nso passionate, and so filled with hatred against Elijah, seems to be\npowerless and unmanned in his presence. As he meets the prophet\nhe cannot refrain from speaking the language of his heart: \u201cArt thou\nhe that troubleth Israel?\u201d Elijah, indignant, and jealous for the honor\nand glory of God, answers the charge of Ahab with boldness: \u201cI\nLaodicean Church 265\nhave not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father\u2019s house, in that ye\nhave forsaken the commandments of the Lord.\u201d\nThe prophet, as God\u2019s messenger, had reproved the sins of the\npeople, denouncing upon them the judgments of God because of\ntheir wickedness. And now, standing alone in conscious innocence,\nfirm in his integrity, surrounded by the train of armed men, Elijah\nshows no timidity, neither does he show the least reverence to the\nking. The man whom God has talked with, and who has a clear sense\nof how God regards man in his sinful depravity, has no apology to\nmake to Ahab nor homage to give him. As God\u2019s messenger, Elijah\nnow commands and Ahab at once obeys as though Elijah were\nmonarch and he the subject.\nThe Sacrifice on Mount Carmel [279]\nElijah demands a convocation at Carmel of all Israel and also\nof all the prophets of Baal. The awful solemnity in the looks of the\nprophet gives him the appearance of one standing in the presence\nof the Lord God of Israel. The condition of Israel in their apostasy\ndemands a firm demeanor, stern speech, and commanding authority.\nGod prepares the message to fit the time and occasion. Sometimes\nHe puts His Spirit upon His messengers to sound an alarm day and\nnight, as did His messenger John: \u201cPrepare ye the way of the Lord.\u201d\nThen, again, men of action are needed who will not be swerved from\nduty, but whose energy will arouse and demand, \u201cWho is on the\nLord\u2019s side?\u201d let him come over with us. God will have a fitting\nmessage to meet His people in their varied conditions.\nSwift messengers are sent throughout the kingdom with the\nmessage from Elijah. Representatives are sent from cities, towns,\nvillages, and families. All seem in haste to answer the call, as though\nsome wonderful miracle is to be performed. According to Elijah\u2019s\ncommand, Ahab gathers the prophets of Baal at Carmel. The heart\nof Israel\u2019s apostate leader is overawed, and he tremblingly follows\nthe direction of the stern prophet of God.\nThe people assemble upon Mount Carmel, a place of beauty\nwhen the dew and rain fall upon it causing it to flourish; but now\nits beauty is languishing under the curse of God. Upon this mount,\nwhich was the excellency of groves and flowers, Baal\u2019s prophets had\n266 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nerected altars for their pagan worship. This mountain was conspic-\nuous; it overlooked the surrounding countries and was in sight of\na large portion of the kingdom. As God had been signally dishon-\nored by the idolatrous worship carried on here, Elijah chose this as\nthe most conspicuous place for the display of God\u2019s power and to\nvindicate His honor.\nJezebel\u2019s prophets, eight hundred and fifty in number, like a[280]\nregiment of soldiers prepared for battle, march out in a body with\ninstrumental music and imposing display. But there is trembling\nin their hearts as they consider that at the word of this prophet of\nJehovah the land of Israel has been destitute of dew and rain three\nyears. They feel that some fearful crisis is at hand. They had trusted\nin their gods, but could not unsay the words of Elijah and prove him\nfalse. Their gods were indifferent to their frantic cries, prayers, and\nsacrifices.\nElijah, early in the morning, stands upon Mount Carmel, sur-\nrounded by apostate Israel and the prophets of Baal. A lone man in\nthat vast multitude, he stands undaunted. He whom the whole king-\ndom has charged with its weight of woe is before them, unterrified\nand unattended by visible armies and imposing display. He stands,\nclad in his coarse garment, with awful solemnity in his countenance,\nas though fully aware of his sacred commission as the servant of God\nto execute His commands. Elijah fastens his eyes upon the highest\nridge of mountains where had stood the altar of Jehovah when the\nmountain was covered with flourishing trees and flowers. The blight\nof God is now upon it; all the desolation of Israel is in full view of\nthe neglected, torn-down altar of Jehovah, and in sight are the altars\nof Baal. Ahab stands at the head of the priests of Baal, and all wait\nin anxious, fearful expectation for the words of Elijah.\nIn the full light of the sun, surrounded by thousands,\u2014men\nof war, prophets of Baal, and the monarch of Israel,\u2014stands the\ndefenseless man, Elijah, apparently alone, yet not alone. The most\npowerful host of heaven surrounds him. Angels who excel in strength\nhave come from heaven to shield the faithful and righteous prophet.\nWith stern and commanding voice Elijah cries: \u201cHow long halt ye\nbetween two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow Him: but if Baal,\nthen follow him. And the people answered him not a word.\u201d Not\nLaodicean Church 267\none in that vast assembly dared utter one word for God and show his\nloyalty to Jehovah.\nWhat astonishing deception and fearful blindness had, like a [281]\ndark cloud, covered Israel! This blindness and apostasy had not\nclosed about them suddenly; it had come upon them gradually as\nthey had not heeded the word of reproof and warning which the Lord\nhad sent to them because of their pride and their sins. And now, in\nthis fearful crisis, in the presence of the idolatrous priests and the\napostate king, they remained neutral. If God abhors one sin above\nanother, of which His people are guilty, it is doing nothing in case\nof an emergency. Indifference and neutrality in a religious crisis is\nregarded of God as a grievous crime and equal to the very worst type\nof hostility against God.\nAll Israel is silent. Again the voice of Elijah is heard addressing\nthem: \u201cI, even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord; but Baal\u2019s\nprophets are four hundred and fifty men. Let them therefore give\nus two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves,\nand cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and\nI will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire\nunder: and call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the\nname of the Lord: and the God that answereth by fire, let Him be\nGod. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken. And\nElijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for\nyourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name\nof your gods, but put no fire under. And they took the bullock which\nwas given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal\nfrom morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there\nwas no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar\nwhich was made.\u201d\nThe proposition of Elijah is reasonable. The people dare not\nevade it, and they find courage to answer: The word is good. The\nprophets of Baal dare not dissent or evade the matter. God has\ndirected this trial and has prepared confusion for the authors of\nidolatry and a signal triumph for His name. The priests of Baal\ndare not do otherwise than accept the conditions. With terror and\nguiltiness in their hearts, while outwardly bold and defiant, they\nrear their altar, lay on the wood and the victim, and then begin their [282]\nincantations, their chanting and bawling, characteristics of pagan\n268 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nworship. Their shrill cries re-echo through forests and mountains:\n\u201cO Baal, hear us.\u201d The priests gather in an army about their altars,\nand with leaping, and writhing, and screaming, and stamping, and\nwith unnatural gestures, and tearing their hair, and cutting their flesh,\nthey manifest apparent sincerity.\nThe morning passes and noon comes, and yet there is no move of\ntheir gods in pity to Baal\u2019s priests, the deluded worshipers of idols.\nNo voice answers their frantic cries. The priests are continually\ndevising how, by deception, they can kindle a fire upon the altars\nand give the glory to Baal. But the firm eye of Elijah watches every\nmotion. Eight hundred voices become hoarse. Their garments are\ncovered with blood, and yet their frantic excitement does not abate.\nTheir pleadings are mingled with cursings to their sun-god that he\ndoes not send fire for their altars. Elijah stands by, watching with\neagle eye lest any deception should be practiced; for he knows that\nif, by any device, they could kindle their altar fire, he would be torn\nin pieces upon the spot. He wishes to show the people the folly of\ntheir doubting and halting between two opinions when they have\nthe wonderful works of God\u2019s majestic power in their behalf and\ninnumerable evidences of His infinite mercies and loving-kindness\ntoward them.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said,\nCry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or\nhe is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.\nAnd they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with\nknives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them. And it came\nto pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time\nof the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice,\nnor any to answer, nor any that regarded.\u201d\nHow gladly would Satan, who fell like lightning from heaven,\ncome to the help of those whom he has deceived, whose minds he\nhas controlled, and who are fully devoted to his service. Gladly[283]\nwould he send the lightning and kindle their sacrifices; but Jehovah\nhas set Satan\u2019s bounds. He has restrained his power, and all his\ndevices cannot convey one spark to Baal\u2019s altars. Evening draws on.\nThe prophets of Baal are weary, faint, and confused. One suggests\none thing, and one another, until they cease their efforts. Their\nLaodicean Church 269\nshrieks and curses no longer resound over Mount Carmel. With\nweakness and despair they retire from the contest.\nThe people have witnessed the terrible demonstrations of the\nunreasonable, frantic priests. They have beheld their leaping upon\nthe altar as though they would grasp the burning rays from the sun\nto serve their altars. They have become tired of the exhibitions of\ndemonism, of pagan idolatry; and they feel earnest and anxious to\nhear what Elijah will speak.\nElijah\u2019s turn has now come. \u201cAnd Elijah said unto all the people,\nCome near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And\nhe repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. And Elijah\ntook twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons\nof Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall\nbe thy name: and with the stones he built an altar in the name of\nthe Lord: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would\ncontain two measures of seed. And he put the wood in order, and\ncut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill\nfour barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on\nthe wood. And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the\nsecond time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the\nthird time. And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled\nthe trench also with water. And it came to pass at the time of the\noffering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near,\nand said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known\nthis day that Thou art God in Israel, and that I am Thy servant, and\nthat I have done all these things at Thy word. Hear me, O Lord, hear\nme, that this people may know that Thou art the Lord God, and that\nThou hast turned their heart back again. Then the fire of the Lord [284]\nfell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones,\nand the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. And\nwhen all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said,\nThe Lord, He is the God; the Lord, He is the God.\u201d\nElijah at the hour of evening sacrifice repairs the altar of God\nwhich the apostasy of Israel has allowed the priests of Baal to tear\ndown. He does not call upon one of the people to aid him in his\nlaborious work. The altars of Baal are all prepared; but he turns to\nthe broken-down altar of God, which is more sacred and precious to\nhim in its unsightly ruins than all the magnificent altars of Baal.\n270 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nElijah respects the Lord\u2019s covenant with His people, although\nthey have apostatized. With calmness and solemnity he repairs the\nbroken-down altar with twelve stones, according to the number of\nthe twelve tribes of Israel. The disappointed priests of Baal, wearied\nwith their vain, frenzied efforts, are sitting or lying prostrate on the\nground, waiting to see what Elijah will do. They are filled with\nfear and hatred toward the prophet for proposing a test which has\nexposed their weakness and the inefficiency of their gods.\nThe people of Israel stand spellbound, pale, anxious, and almost\nbreathless with awe, while Elijah calls upon Jehovah, the Creator of\nthe heavens and the earth. The people have witnessed the fanatical,\nunreasonable frenzy of the prophets of Baal. In contrast they are now\nprivileged to witness the calm, awe-inspiring deportment of Elijah.\nHe reminds the people of their degeneracy, which has awakened the\nwrath of God against them, and then calls upon them to humble their\nhearts and turn to the God of their fathers, that His curse may be\nremoved from them. Ahab and his idolatrous priests are looking\non with amazement mingled with terror. They await the result with\nanxious, solemn silence.\nAfter the victim is laid upon the altar, he commands the people\nto flood the sacrifice and the altar with water, and to fill the trench\nround about the altar. He then reverentially bows before the unseen[285]\nGod, raises his hands toward heaven, and offers a calm and simple\nprayer, unattended with violent gestures or contortions of the body.\nNo shrieks resound over Carmel\u2019s height. A solemn silence, which\nis oppressive to the priests of Baal, rests upon all. In his prayer,\nElijah makes use of no extravagant expressions. He prays to Jehovah\nas though He were nigh, witnessing the whole scene, and hearing\nhis sincere, fervent, yet simple prayer. Baal\u2019s priests have screamed,\nand foamed, and leaped, and prayed, very long\u2014from morning until\nnear evening. Elijah\u2019s prayer is very short, earnest, reverential, and\nsincere. No sooner is that prayer uttered than flames of fire descend\nfrom heaven in a distinct manner, like a brilliant flash of lightning,\nkindling the wood for sacrifice and consuming the victim, licking\nup the water in the trench and consuming even the stones of the\naltar. The brilliancy of the blaze illumes the mountain and is painful\nto the eyes of the multitude. The people of the kingdom of Israel\nnot gathered upon the mount are watching with interest those there\nLaodicean Church 271\nassembled. As the fire descends, they witness it and are amazed at\nthe sight. It resembles the pillar of fire at the Red Sea, which by\nnight separated the children of Israel from the Egyptian host.\nThe people upon the mountain prostrate themselves in terror\nand awe before the unseen God. They cannot look upon the bright\nconsuming fire sent from heaven. They fear that they will be con-\nsumed in their apostasy and sins, and cry out with one voice, which\nresounds over the mountain and echoes to the plains below with\nterrible distinctness: \u201cThe Lord, He is the God; the Lord, He is the\nGod.\u201d Israel is at last aroused and undeceived. They see their sin\nand how greatly they have dishonored God. Their anger is aroused\nagainst the prophets of Baal. With terror, Ahab and Baal\u2019s priests\nwitness the wonderful exhibition of Jehovah\u2019s power. Again the\nvoice of Elijah is heard in startling words of command to the people:\n\u201cTake the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.\u201d The people\nare ready to obey his word. They seize the false prophets who have [286]\ndeluded them, and bring them to the brook Kishon, and there, with\nhis own hand, Elijah slays these idolatrous priests.\nThe judgments of God having been executed upon the false\npriests, the people having confessed their sins and acknowledged\ntheir fathers\u2019 God, the withering curse of God is now to be with-\ndrawn, and He is to renew His blessings unto His people and again\nrefresh the earth with dew and rain.\nElijah addresses Ahab: \u201cGet thee up, eat and drink; for there is a\nsound of abundance of rain.\u201d While Ahab went up to feast, Elijah\nwent up from the fearful sacrifice to the top of Mount Carmel to\npray. His work of slaying the pagan priests had not unfitted him for\nthe solemn exercise of prayer. He had performed the will of God.\nAfter he had, as God\u2019s instrument, done what he could to remove the\ncause of Israel\u2019s apostasy by slaying the idolatrous priests, he could\ndo no more. He then intercedes in behalf of sinning, apostate Israel.\nIn the most painful position, his face bowed between his knees, he\nmost earnestly supplicates God to send rain. Six times in succession\nhe sends his servant to see if there is any visible token that God\nhas heard his prayer. He does not become impatient and faithless\nbecause the Lord does not immediately give the token that his prayer\nis heard. He continues in earnest prayer, sending his servant seven\ntimes to see if God has granted any signal. His servant returns the\n272 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nsixth time from his outlook toward the sea with the discouraging\nreport that there is no sign of clouds forming in the brassy heavens.\nThe seventh time he informs Elijah that there is a small cloud to be\nseen, about the size of a man\u2019s hand. This is enough to satisfy the\nfaith of Elijah. He does not wait for the heavens to gather blackness,\nto make the matter sure. In that small, rising cloud his faith hears\nthe sound of abundance of rain. His works are in accordance with\nhis faith. He sends a message to Ahab by his servant: \u201cPrepare thy\nchariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.\u201d\nElijah\u2019s Humility[287]\nHere Elijah ventured something upon his faith. He did not wait\nfor sight. \u201cAnd it came to pass in the meanwhile, that the heaven was\nblack with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab\nrode, and went to Jezreel. And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah;\nand he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of\nJezreel.\u201d\nElijah had passed through great excitement and labor during the\nday; but the Spirit of the Lord came upon him because he had been\nobedient and had done His will in executing the idolatrous priests.\nSome will be ready to say: What a hard, cruel man Elijah must have\nbeen! And anyone who defends the honor of God at any risk will\nbring censure and condemnation upon himself from a large class.\nThe rain began to descend. It was night, and the blinding rain\nprevented Ahab from seeing his course. Elijah, nerved by the Spirit\nand power of God, girded his coarse garment about him and ran\nbefore the chariot of Ahab, guiding his course to the entrance of the\ncity. The prophet of God had humiliated Ahab before his people.\nHe had slain his idolatrous priests, and now he wished to show to\nIsrael that he acknowledged Ahab as his king. As an act of special\nhomage he guided his chariot, running before it to the entrance of\nthe gate of the city.\nHere is a lesson for young men who profess to be servants of\nGod, bearing His message, who are exalted in their own estimation.\nThey can trace nothing remarkable in their experience, as could\nElijah, yet they feel above performing duties which to them appear\nmenial. They will not come down from their ministerial dignity to do\nLaodicean Church 273\nneedful service, fearing that they will be doing the work of a servant.\nAll such should learn from the example of Elijah. His word locked\nthe treasures of heaven, the dew and rain, from the earth three years.\nHis word alone was the key to unlock heaven and bring showers\nof rain. He was honored of God as he offered his simple prayer in [288]\nthe presence of the king and the thousands of Israel, in answer to\nwhich fire flashed from heaven and kindled the fire upon the altar of\nsacrifice. His hand executed the judgment of God in slaying eight\nhundred and fifty priests of Baal; and yet, after the exhausting toil\nand most signal triumph of the day, he who could bring clouds and\nrain and fire from heaven was willing to perform the service of a\nmenial and run before the chariot of Ahab in the darkness and in\nthe wind and rain to serve the sovereign whom he had not feared to\nrebuke to his face because of his sins and crimes. The king passed\nwithin the gates. Elijah wrapped himself in his mantle and lay upon\nthe bare earth.\nElijah in Despondency\nAfter Elijah had shown such undaunted courage in a contest\nbetween life and death, after he had triumphed over the king, the\npriests, and the people, we would naturally suppose that he would\nnever give way to despondency or be awed into timidity.\nAfter his first appearance to Ahab, denouncing upon him the\njudgments of God because of his and Israel\u2019s apostasy, God directed\nhis course from Jezebel\u2019s power to a place of safety in the mountains,\nby the brook Cherith. There He honored Elijah by sending food to\nhim morning and evening by an angel of heaven. Then, as the brook\nbecame dry, He sent him to the widow of Sarepta, and wrought a\nmiracle daily to keep the widow\u2019s family and Elijah in food. After\nhe had been blessed with evidences of such love and care from God,\nwe would suppose that Elijah would never distrust Him. But the\napostle tells us that he was a man of like passions as we, and subject,\nas we are, to temptations.\nAhab related to his wife the wonderful events of the day and the\nmarvelous exhibitions of the power of God showing that Jehovah,\nthe Creator of the heavens and the earth, was God; also that Elijah\nhad slain the prophets of Baal. At this, Jezebel, who was hardened in [289]\n274 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nsin, became infuriated. Bold, defiant, and determined in her idolatry,\nshe declared to Ahab that Elijah should not live.\nThat night a messenger aroused the weary prophet and delivered\nthe word of Jezebel, given in the name of her pagan gods, that she\nwould, in the presence of Israel, do to Elijah as he had done to\nthe priests of Baal. Elijah should have met this threat and oath of\nJezebel with an appeal for protection to the God of heaven, who had\ncommissioned him to do the work he had done. He should have\ntold the messenger that the God in whom he trusted would be his\nprotector against the hatred and threats of Jezebel. But the faith\nand courage of Elijah seem to forsake him. He starts up from his\nslumbers bewildered. The rain is pouring from the heavens, and\ndarkness is on every side. He loses sight of God and flees for his life\nas though the avenger of blood were close behind him. He leaves\nhis servant behind him on the way, and in the morning he is far from\nthe habitations of men, upon a dreary desert alone.\n\u201cAnd when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came\nto Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.\nBut he himself went a day\u2019s journey into the wilderness, and came\nand sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that\nhe might die; and said, It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life;\nfor I am not better than my fathers. And as he lay and slept under a\njuniper tree, behold then an angel touched him, and said unto him,\nArise and eat. And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken\non the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and\ndrink, and laid him down again. And the angel of the Lord came\nagain the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat;\nbecause the journey is too great for thee. And he arose, and did eat\nand drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty\nnights unto Horeb the mount of God. And he came thither unto a\ncave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the Lord came to\nhim, and He said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?\u201d\nElijah should have trusted in God, who had warned him when to[290]\nflee and where to find an asylum from the hatred of Jezebel, secure\nfrom the diligent search of Ahab. The Lord had not warned him at\nthis time to flee. He had not waited for the Lord to speak to him. He\nmoved rashly. Had he waited with faith and patience, God would\nLaodicean Church 275\nhave shielded His servant and would have given him another signal\nvictory in Israel by sending His judgments upon Jezebel.\nWeary and prostrate, Elijah sits down to rest. He is discouraged\nand feels like murmuring. He says. \u201cNow, O Lord, take away my\nlife; for I am not better than my fathers.\u201d He feels that life is no more\ndesirable. He expected after the signal display of God\u2019s power in\nthe presence of Israel that they would be true and faithful to God.\nHe expected that Jezebel would no longer have influence over the\nmind of Ahab and that there would be a general revolution in the\nkingdom of Israel. And when the threatening message from Jezebel\nwas delivered to him, he forgot that God was the same all-powerful\nand pitiful God that He was when he prayed to Him for fire from\nheaven, and it came, and for rain, and it came. God had granted\nevery request; yet Elijah is a fugitive far from the homes of men,\nand he wishes never to look upon man again.\nHow did God look upon His suffering servant? Did He forsake\nhim because despondency and despair had seized him? Oh, no.\nElijah was prostrated with discouragement. All day had he toiled\nwithout food. When he guided the chariot of Ahab, running before it\nto the gate of the city, he was strong of courage. He had high hopes\nthat Israel as a nation would return to their allegiance to God and be\nreinstated in His favor. But the reaction which frequently follows\nelevation of faith and marked and glorious success, was pressing\nupon Elijah. He was exalted to Pisgah\u2019s top, to be humiliated to the\nlowliest valley in faith and feeling. But God\u2019s eye was still upon\nHis servant. He loved him no less when he felt brokenhearted and\nforsaken of God and man than when, in answer to his prayer, fire\nflashed from heaven illuminating Carmel.\nThose who have not borne weighty responsibilities, or who have [291]\nnot been accustomed to feel very deeply, cannot understand the feel-\nings of Elijah and are not prepared to give him the tender sympathy\nhe deserves. God knows and can read the heart\u2019s sore anguish under\ntemptation and sore conflict.\nAs Elijah sleeps under the juniper tree, a soft touch and pleasant\nvoice arouse him. He starts at once in his terror, as if to flee, as\nthough the enemy who was in pursuit of his life had indeed found\nhim. But in the pitying face of love bending over him he sees,\nnot the face of an enemy, but of a friend. An angel has been sent\n276 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nwith food from heaven to sustain the faithful servant of God. His\nvoice says to Elijah: \u201cArise and eat.\u201d After Elijah had partaken of\nthe refreshment prepared for him, he again slumbered. A second\ntime the angel of God ministers to the wants of Elijah. He touches\nthe weary, exhausted man, and in pitying tenderness says to him:\n\u201cArise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.\u201d Elijah\nwas strengthened and pursued his journey to Horeb. He was in a\nwilderness. At night he lodged in a cave for protection from the wild\nbeasts.\nHere God, through one of His angels, met with Elijah, and\ninquired of him: \u201cWhat doest thou here, Elijah?\u201d I sent you to\nthe brook Cherith, I sent you to the widow of Sarepta, I sent you to\nSamaria with a message to Ahab, but who sent you this long journey\ninto the wilderness? And what errand have you here? Elijah mourns\nout the bitterness of his soul to the Lord: \u201cAnd he said, I have been\nvery jealous for the Lord God of hosts: for the children of Israel\nhave forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain\nThy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they\nseek my life, to take it away. And he said, Go forth, and stand upon\nthe mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a\ngreat and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the\nrocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after\nthe wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and\nafter the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after\nthe fire a still small voice. And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that[292]\nhe wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the\nentering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him,\nand said, What doest thou here, Elijah? And he said, I have been\nvery jealous for the Lord God of hosts: because the children of Israel\nhave forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain\nThy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they\nseek my life, to take it away.\u201d\nThen the Lord manifests Himself to Elijah, showing him that\nquiet trust and firm reliance upon God will ever find Him a present\nhelp in time of need.\nI have been shown that my husband has erred in giving way to\ndespondency and distrust of God. Time and again has God revealed\nHimself to him by remarkable evidences of His care, love, and power.\nLaodicean Church 277\nBut when he has seen that his interest and jealousy for God and His\ncause have not been understood or appreciated, he has at times given\nway to discouragement and to despair. God has given my husband\nand me a special and important work to do in His cause, to reprove\nand counsel His people. When we see our reproofs slighted and\nare repaid with hatred instead of sympathy, then we have frequently\nlet go our faith and trust in the God of Israel; and, like Elijah, we\nhave yielded to despondency and despair. Here has been the great\nerror in the life of my husband\u2014his becoming discouraged because\nhis brethren have brought trials upon him instead of helping him.\nAnd when his brethren see, in the sadness and despondency of my\nhusband, the effect of their unbelief and lack of sympathy, some are\nprepared to triumph over him and take advantage of his discouraged\nstate, and feel that, after all, God cannot be with Brother White or\nhe would not manifest weakness in this direction. I refer such to the\nwork of Elijah and to his despondency and discouragements. Elijah,\nalthough a prophet of God, was a man subject to like passions as we\nare. We have the frailties of mortal feelings to contend with. But\nif we trust in God, He will never leave nor forsake us. Under all [293]\ncircumstances we may have firm trust in God, that He will never\nleave nor forsake us while we preserve our integrity.\nMy husband may take courage in his affliction, that he has a\npitying heavenly Father who reads the motives and understands the\npurposes of the soul. Those who stand in the front of the conflict, and\nwho are reined up by the Spirit of God to do a special work for Him,\nwill frequently feel a reaction when the pressure is removed, and\ndespondency may sometimes press them hard and shake the most\nheroic faith and weaken the most steadfast minds. God understands\nall our weaknesses. He can pity and love when the hearts of men\nmay be as hard as flint. To wait patiently and trust in God when\neverything looks dark is the lesson that my husband must learn more\nfully. God will not fail him in his integrity.\n* * * * *\nChapter 28\u2014Moses and Aaron\nUpon Mount Hor Aaron died and was buried. Moses, Aaron\u2019s\nbrother, and Eleazar, his son, accompanied him to the mount. The\npainful duty was laid upon Moses to remove from his brother Aaron\nthe sacerdotal robes and place them upon Eleazar, for God had said\nthat he should succeed Aaron in the priesthood. Moses and Eleazar\nwitnessed the death of Aaron, and Moses buried him in the mount.\nThis scene upon Mount Hor carries our minds back to some of the\nmost striking events in the life of Aaron.\nAaron was a man of amiable disposition, whom God selected\nto stand with Moses and speak for him; in short, to be mouthpiece\nfor Moses. God might have chosen Aaron as leader; but He who is\nacquainted with hearts, who understands character, knew that Aaron\nwas yielding and lacked moral courage to stand in defense of the\nright under all circumstances, irrespective of consequences. Aaron\u2019s\ndesire to have the good will of the people sometimes led him to\ncommit great wrongs. He too frequently yielded to their entreaties,[294]\nand in so doing dishonored God. The same lack of firmness for the\nright in his family resulted in the death of two of his sons. Aaron\nwas eminent for piety and usefulness, but he neglected to discipline\nhis family. Rather than perform the task of requiring respect and\nreverence of his sons, he allowed them to follow their inclinations.\nHe did not discipline them in self-denial, but yielded to their wishes.\nThey were not disciplined to respect and reverence parental authority.\nThe father was the proper ruler of his own family as long as he lived.\nHis authority was not to cease, even after his children were grown\nup and had families of their own. God Himself was the monarch of\nthe nation, and from the people He claimed obedience and honor.\nThe order and prosperity of the kingdom depended upon the\ngood order of the church. And the prosperity, harmony, and order of\nthe church depended upon the good order and thorough discipline\nof families. God punishes the unfaithfulness of parents, to whom\nHe has entrusted the duty of maintaining the principles of parental\n278\nMoses and Aaron 279\ngovernment, which lie at the foundation of church discipline and\nthe prosperity of the nation. One undisciplined child has frequently\nmarred the peace and harmony of a church, and incited a nation\nto murmuring and rebellion. In a most solemn manner the Lord\nhas enjoined upon children their duty to affectionately respect and\nhonor their parents. And on the other hand He requires parents\nto train up their children and with unceasing diligence to educate\nthem with regard to the claims of His law and to instruct them in\nthe knowledge and fear of God. These injunctions which God laid\nupon the Jews with so much solemnity, rest with equal weight upon\nChristian parents. Those who neglect the light and instruction which\nGod has given in His word in regard to training their children and\ncommanding their households after them, will have a fearful account\nto settle. Aaron\u2019s criminal neglect to command the respect and\nreverence of his sons resulted in their death.\nGod distinguished Aaron by choosing him and his male posterity [295]\nfor the priesthood. His sons ministered in the sacred office. Nadab\nand Abihu failed to reverence the command of God to offer sacred\nfire upon their censers with the incense before Him. God had for-\nbidden them, upon pain of death, to present the common fire before\nHim with the incense.\nBut here is seen the result of loose discipline. As these sons of\nAaron had not been educated to respect and reverence the commands\nof their father, as they disregarded parental authority, they did not\nrealize the necessity of explicitly following the requirements of God.\nWhen indulging their appetite for wine and while under its exciting\nstimulus, their reason was clouded, and they could not discern the\ndifference between the sacred and the common. Contrary to God\u2019s\nexpress direction, they dishonored Him by offering common instead\nof sacred fire. God visited them with His wrath; fire went forth from\nHis presence and destroyed them.\nAaron bore his severe affliction with patience and humble sub-\nmission. Sorrow and keen agony wrung his soul. He was convicted\nof his neglect of duty. He was priest of the most high God, to make\natonement for the sins of the people. He was priest of his household,\nyet he had been inclined to pass over the folly of his children. He\nhad neglected his duty to train and educate them to obedience, self-\ndenial, and reverence for parental authority. Through feelings of\n280 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nmisplaced indulgence, he failed to mold their characters with high\nreverence for eternal things. Aaron did not see, any more than many\nChristian parents now see, that his misplaced love and the indul-\ngence of his children in wrong was preparing them for the certain\ndispleasure of God and for His wrath to break forth upon them to\ntheir destruction. While Aaron neglected to exercise his authority,\nthe justice of God awakened against them. Aaron had to learn that\nhis gentle remonstrance, without a firm exercise of parental restraint,\nand his imprudent tenderness toward his sons were cruelty in the\nextreme. God took the work of justice into His own hands and\ndestroyed the sons of Aaron.\nWhen God called for Moses to come up into the mount, it was[296]\nsix days before he was received into the cloud, into the immediate\npresence of God. The top of the mountain was all aglow with the\nglory of God. And yet even while the children of Israel had this\nglory in their very sight, unbelief was so natural to them that they\nbegan to murmur with discontent because Moses was absent. While\nthe glory of God signified His sacred presence upon the mountain,\nand their leader was in close converse with God, they should have\nbeen sanctifying themselves by close searching of heart, humiliation,\nand godly fear. God had left Aaron and Hur to take the place of\nMoses. In his absence the people were to consult and advise with\nthese men of God\u2019s appointment.\nHere Aaron\u2019s deficiency as a leader or governor of Israel is seen.\nThe people beset him to make them gods to go before them into\nEgypt. Here was an opportunity for Aaron to show his faith and\nunwavering confidence in God, and with firmness and decision to\nmeet the proposition of the people. But his natural desire to please\nand to yield to the people led him to sacrifice the honor of God. He\nrequested them to bring their ornaments to him, and he wrought out\nfor them a golden calf and proclaimed before the people: \u201cThese be\nthy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\u201d\nAnd to this senseless god he made an altar and proclaimed on the\nmorrow a feast to the Lord. All restraint seemed to be removed from\nthe people. They offered burnt offerings to the golden calf, and a\nspirit of levity took possession of them. They indulged in shameful\nrioting and drunkenness; they ate, they drank, and rose up to play.\nMoses and Aaron 281\nA few weeks only had passed since they had made a solemn\ncovenant with God to obey His voice. They had listened to the words\nof God\u2019s law, spoken in awful grandeur from Sinai\u2019s mount, amid\nthunderings and lightnings and earthquakes. They had heard the\ndeclaration from the lips of God Himself: \u201cI am the Lord thy God,\nwhich have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house\nof bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before Me. Thou shalt\nnot make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything [297]\nthat is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in\nthe water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them,\nnor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting\nthe iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth\ngeneration of them that hate Me; and showing mercy unto thousands\nof them that love Me, and keep My commandments.\u201d\nAaron and also his sons had been exalted by being called into\nthe mount to there witness the glory of God. \u201cAnd they saw the God\nof Israel: and there was under His feet as it were a paved work of a\nsapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in His clearness.\u201d\nGod had appointed Nadab and Abihu to a most sacred work,\ntherefore He honored them in a most wonderful manner. He gave\nthem a view of His excellent glory, that the scenes they should\nwitness in the mount would abide with them and the better qualify\nthem to minister in His service and render to Him that exalted honor\nand reverence before the people which would give them clearer\nconceptions of His character and awaken in them due obedience and\nreverence for all His requirements.\nBefore Moses left his people for the mount, he read to them\nthe words of the covenant that God had made with them, and they\nwith one voice answered: \u201cAll that the Lord hath said will we do,\nand be obedient.\u201d How great must have been the sin of Aaron, how\naggravated in the sight of God!\nWhile Moses was receiving the law of God in the mount, the\nLord informed him of the sin of rebellious Israel and requested him\nto let them go, that He might destroy them. But Moses pleaded\nbefore God for the people. Although Moses was the meekest man\nthat lived, yet when the interests of the people over whom God had\nappointed him as leader were at stake, he lost his natural timidity\nand with singular persistency and wonderful boldness pleaded with\n282 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nGod for Israel. He would not consent that God should destroy His\npeople, although God promised that in their destruction He would[298]\nexalt Moses and raise up a better people than Israel.\nMoses prevailed. God granted his earnest petition not to blot out\nHis people. Moses took the tables of the covenant, the law of Ten\nCommandments, and descended from the mount. The boisterous,\ndrunken revelry of the children of Israel reached his ears long before\nhe came to the camp. When he saw their idolatry, and that they\nhad broken in a most marked manner the words of the covenant,\nhe became overwhelmed with grief and indignation at their base\nidolatry. Confusion and shame on their account took possession\nof him, and he there threw down the tables and broke them. As\nthey had broken their covenant with God, Moses, in breaking the\ntables, signified to them that so also God had broken His covenant\nwith them. The tables whereupon was written the law of God were\nbroken.\nAaron, with his amiable disposition, so very mild and pleasing,\nsought to conciliate Moses, as though no very great sin had been\ncommitted by the people, over which he should feel thus deeply.\nMoses asked in anger: \u201cWhat did this people unto thee, that thou\nhast brought so great a sin upon them? And Aaron said, Let not the\nanger of my Lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are\nset on mischief. For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall\ngo before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out\nof the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. And I said\nunto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they\ngave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.\u201d\nAaron would have Moses think that some wonderful miracle had\ntransformed their golden ornaments into the shape of a calf. He did\nnot relate to Moses that he, with other workmen, had wrought out\nthis image.\nAaron had thought that Moses had been too unyielding to the\nwishes of the people. He thought that if Moses had been less firm,\nless decided at times, and that if he had made a compromise with the\npeople and gratified their wishes, he would have had less trouble,\nand there would have been more peace and harmony in the camp of[299]\nIsrael. He, therefore, had been trying this new policy. He carried out\nhis natural temperament by yielding to the wishes of the people, to\nMoses and Aaron 283\nsave dissatisfaction and preserve their good will, and thereby prevent\na rebellion, which he thought would certainly come if he did not\nyield to their wishes. But had Aaron stood unwaveringly for God;\nhad he met the intimation of the people for him to make them gods\nto go before them to Egypt with the just indignation and horror that\ntheir proposition deserved; had he cited them to the terrors of Sinai,\nwhere God had spoken His law in such glory and majesty; had he\nreminded them of their solemn covenant with God to obey all that\nHe should command them; had he told them that he would not, at\nthe sacrifice of his life, yield to their entreaties, he would have had\ninfluence with the people to prevent a terrible apostasy. But when,\nin the absence of Moses, his influence was required to be used in the\nright direction, when he should have stood as firm and unyielding\nas did Moses, to prevent the people from pursuing a course of sin,\nhis influence was exerted on the wrong side. He was powerless to\nmake his influence felt in vindication of God\u2019s honor in keeping His\nholy law. But on the wrong side he swayed a powerful influence. He\ndirected, and the people obeyed.\nWhen Aaron took the first step in the wrong direction, the spirit\nwhich had actuated the people imbued him, and he took the lead and\ndirected as a general, and the people were singularly obedient. Here\nAaron gave decided sanction to the most aggravated sins, because it\nwas less difficult than to stand in vindication of the right. When he\nswerved from his integrity in giving sanction to the people in their\nsins he seemed inspired with a decision, earnestness, and zeal new\nto him. His timidity seemed suddenly to disappear. With a zeal that\nhe had never manifested in standing in defense of the honor of God\nagainst wrong he seized the instruments to work out the gold into the\nimage of a calf. He ordered an altar to be built, and, with assurance\nworthy of a better cause, he proclaimed to the people that on the [300]\nmorrow there would be a feast to the Lord. The trumpeters took the\nword from the mouth of Aaron and sounded the proclamation from\ncompany to company of the armies of Israel.\nAaron\u2019s calm assurance in a wrong course gave him greater\ninfluence with the people than Moses could have had in leading\nthem in a right course and in subduing their rebellion. What terrible\nspiritual blindness had come upon Aaron that he should put light\nfor darkness and darkness for light! What presumption in him to\n284 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nproclaim a feast to the Lord over their idolatrous worship of a golden\nimage! Here is seen the power that Satan has over minds that are not\nfully controlled by the Spirit of God. Satan had set up his banner in\nthe midst of Israel, and it was exalted as the banner of God.\n\u201cThese,\u201d said Aaron without hesitation or shame, \u201cbe thy gods,\nO Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\u201d Aaron\ninfluenced the children of Israel to go to greater lengths in idolatry\nthan had entered their minds. They were no longer troubled lest the\nburning glory like flaming fire upon the mount had consumed their\nleader. They thought they had a general who just suited them, and\nthey were ready to do anything that he suggested. They sacrificed to\ntheir golden god; they offered peace offerings, and gave themselves\nup to pleasure, rioting, and drunkenness. They were then decided in\ntheir own minds that it was not because they were wrong that they\nhad so much trouble in the wilderness; but the difficulty, after all,\nwas with their leader. He was not the right kind of man. He was\ntoo unyielding and kept their sins continually before them, warning,\nreproving, and threatening them with God\u2019s displeasure. A new\norder of things had come, and they were pleased with Aaron and\npleased with themselves. They thought: If Moses had only been as\namiable and mild as Aaron, what peace and harmony would have\nprevailed in the camp of Israel! They cared not now whether Moses\never came down from the mount or not.\nWhen Moses saw the idolatry of Israel and his indignation was[301]\nso aroused at their shameful forgetfulness of God that he threw down\nthe tables of stone and broke them, Aaron stood meekly by, bearing\nthe censure of Moses with commendable patience. The people were\ncharmed with Aaron\u2019s lovely spirit and were disgusted with the\nrashness of Moses. But God seeth not as man sees. He condemned\nnot the ardor and indignation of Moses against the base apostasy of\nIsrael.\nThe true general then takes his position for God. He has come\ndirect from the presence of the Lord, where he pleaded with Him to\nturn away His wrath from His erring people. Now he has another\nwork to do, as God\u2019s minister, to vindicate His honor before the\npeople, and let them see that sin is sin, and righteousness is righ-\nteousness. He has a work to do to counteract the terrible influence\nof Aaron. \u201cThen Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said,\nMoses and Aaron 285\nWho is on the Lord\u2019s side? let him come unto me. And all the sons\nof Levi gathered themselves together unto him. And he said unto\nthem, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by\nhis side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp,\nand slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and\nevery man his neighbor. And the children of Levi did according to\nthe word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three\nthousand men. For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to\nthe Lord, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother, that\nHe may bestow upon you a blessing this day.\u201d\nHere Moses defines genuine consecration as obedience to God,\nto stand in vindication of the right and to show a readiness to carry\nout the purpose of God in the most unpleasant duties, showing that\nthe claims of God are higher than the claims of friends or the lives\nof the nearest relatives. The sons of Levi consecrated themselves to\nGod to execute His justice against crime and sin.\nAaron and Moses both sinned in not giving glory and honor to\nGod at the waters of Meribah. They were both wearied and provoked\nwith the continual complaining of Israel, and, at a time when God [302]\nwas to mercifully display His glory to the people, to soften and\nsubdue their hearts and lead them to repentance, Moses and Aaron\nclaimed the power of opening the rock for them. \u201cHear now, ye\nrebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?\u201d Here was a golden\nopportunity to sanctify the Lord in the midst of them, to show them\nthe long-suffering of God and His tender pity for them. They had\nmurmured against Moses and Aaron because they could not find\nwater. Moses and Aaron took these murmurings as a great trial\nand dishonor to themselves, forgetting that it was God whom the\npeople were grieving. It was God whom they were sinning against\nand dishonoring, not those who were appointed of God to carry out\nHis purpose. They were insulting their best Friend in charging their\ncalamities upon Moses and Aaron; they were murmuring at God\u2019s\nprovidence.\nThis sin of these noble leaders was great. Their lives might have\nbeen illustrious to the close. They had been greatly exalted and\nhonored; yet God does not excuse sin in those in exalted positions\nany sooner than He does in those in more humble positions. Many\nprofessed Christians look upon men who do not reprove and con-\n286 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ndemn wrong, as men of piety and Christians indeed, while they think\nthat those who stand boldly in defense of the right, and will not yield\ntheir integrity to unconsecrated influences, lack piety and a Christian\nspirit.\nThose who stand in defense of the honor of God and maintain\nthe purity of truth at any cost will have manifold trials, as did our\nSaviour in the wilderness of temptation. While those who have\nyielding temperaments, who have not courage to condemn wrong,\nbut keep silent when their influence is needed to stand in defense\nof the right against any pressure, may avoid many heartaches and\nescape many perplexities, they will also lose a very rich reward,\nif not their own souls. Those who are in harmony with God, and\nwho through faith in Him receive strength to resist wrong and stand\nin defense of the right, will always have severe conflicts and will\nfrequently have to stand almost alone. But precious victories will\nbe theirs while they make God their dependence. His grace will be[303]\ntheir strength. Their moral sensibility will be keen and clear, and\ntheir moral powers will be able to withstand wrong influences. Their\nintegrity, like that of Moses, will be of the purest character.\nThe mild and yielding spirit of Aaron, and his desire to please\nthe people, blinded his eyes to their sins and to the enormity of the\ncrime that he was sanctioning. His course in giving influence to\nwrong and sin in Israel cost the lives of three thousand men. In what\ncontrast with this is the course of Moses. After he had evidenced to\nthe people that they could not trifle with God with impunity; after he\nhad shown them the just displeasure of God because of their sins, by\ngiving the terrible decree to slay friends or relatives who persisted\nin their apostasy; after the work of justice to turn away the wrath\nof God, irrespective of their feelings of sympathy for loved friends\nand relatives who continued obstinate in their rebellion\u2014after this,\nMoses was prepared for another work. He proved who was the true\nfriend of God and the friend of the people.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the\npeople, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the\nLord; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. And\nMoses returned unto the Lord, and said, Oh, this people have sinned\na great sin, and have made them gods of gold. Yet now, if Thou wilt\nforgive their sin\u2014; and if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of Thy book\nMoses and Aaron 287\nwhich Thou has written. And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever\nhath sinned against Me, him will I blot out of My book. Therefore\nnow go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken\nunto thee: behold, Mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in\nthe day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. And the Lord\nplagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.\u201d\nMoses supplicated God in behalf of sinning Israel. He did not\ntry to lessen their sin before God; he did not excuse them in their\nsin. He frankly acknowledged that they had sinned a great sin and [304]\nhad made them gods of gold. Then he loses his timidity, and the\ninterest of Israel is so closely interwoven with his life that he comes\nwith boldness to God and prays for Him to forgive His people. If\ntheir sin, he pleads, is so great that God cannot forgive them, if their\nnames must be blotted from His book, he prays the Lord to blot\nout his name also. When the Lord renewed His promise to Moses,\nthat His Angel should go before him in leading the people to the\nPromised Land, Moses knew that his request was granted. But the\nLord assured Moses that if He was provoked to visit the people for\ntheir transgressions, He would surely punish them for this grievous\nsin also. But if they were henceforth obedient, He would blot this\ngreat sin out of His book.\n* * * * *\nChapter 29\u2014To a Young Minister and His Wife\nDear Brother and Sister A,\nFor some months I have felt that it was time to write to you some\nthings which the Lord was pleased to show me in regard to you\nseveral years ago. Your cases were shown me in connection with\nthose of others who had a work to do for themselves in order to be\nfitted for the work of presenting the truth. I was shown that you\nwere both deficient in essential qualifications and that if these are not\nobtained your usefulness and the salvation of your own souls will\nbe endangered. You have some faults in your characters which it is\nvery important that you should correct. If you neglect to take hold of\nthe work resolutely and in earnest, these wrongs will increase upon\nyou and will greatly cripple your influence in the cause and work of\nGod, and will finally result in your being separated from the work\nof preaching the truth, which you love so well.\nIn the vision given me for B, I was shown that he had a very\nunfortunate stamp of character. He had not been disciplined, and his\ntemper had not been subdued. He had been permitted to have his own[305]\nhead and to do very much as he pleased. He was greatly deficient\nin reverence for God and man. He had a strong, unsubmissive spirit\nand but a very faint idea of proper gratitude to those who were doing\ntheir utmost for him. He was extremely selfish.\nI was shown that independence, a firm, set, unyielding will, a\nlack of reverence and due respect for others, selfishness and too\ngreat self-confidence, mark the character of Sister A. If she does not\nwatch closely and overcome these defects in her character she will\nsurely fail of sitting with Christ in His throne.\nIn regard to Brother A, I was shown that many of the things\nmentioned in the testimony to B applied to you. I was pointed back\nto your past life. I saw that from a child you have been self-confident,\nheadstrong, and self-willed, and have followed your own mind. You\nhave an independent spirit, and it has been very difficult for you\nto yield to anyone. When it was your duty to yield your way and\n288\nTo a Young Minister and His Wife 289\nyour wishes to others, you would carry matters out in your own rash\nway. You have felt that you were fully competent to think and act\nfor yourself independently. The truth of God has been accepted and\nloved by you and has done much for you, but it has not wrought\nall that transformation necessary for the perfection of Christian\ncharacter. When you first started out to labor in the cause of God\nyou felt more humble and were willing to be advised and counseled.\nBut as you began to be successful in a degree, your self-confidence\nincreased, and you were less humble and became more independent.\nAs you looked at the work of Brother and Sister White you\nthought that you could see where you could have done better than\nthey. Feelings have been cherished in your heart against them. You\nwere naturally skeptical, infidel, in your feelings. As you have seen\ntheir work, and heard the reproofs given to those who were wrong,\nyou have questioned how you would bear such plain testimony. You\ndecided that you could not receive it, and began to brace yourself\nagainst the manner of their laboring, and thus opened a door in your\nheart for suspicion, doubt, and jealousy of them and their work. [306]\nYou became prejudiced in your feelings against their labor. You\nwatched, and listened, and gathered up all you could, and surmised\nmuch. Because God had given you a measure of success, you began\nto place your short experience and labors upon a level with Brother\nWhite\u2019s labors. You flattered yourself that, were you in his place,\nyou could do very much better than he. You began to grow large\nin your own eyes. You thought your knowledge far more extensive\nand valuable than it was. Had you had one-hundredth part of the\nexperience in real labor, care, perplexity, and burden bearing in\nthis cause that Brother White has had, you would be better able to\nunderstand his work and be better prepared to sympathize with him\nin his labors, rather than to murmur and be suspicious and jealous\nof him.\nIn regard to your own post of labor you should be very jealous\nof yourself lest you fail to do your work to God\u2019s acceptance, and\nlest you fail to honor the cause of truth in your labors. You should,\nin humiliation of soul, feel: \u201cWho is sufficient for these things?\u201d\nThe reason why both of you are so ready to question and surmise in\nregard to Brother White\u2019s work is because you know so little about\nit. So few real burdens have ever pressed upon your souls, so little\n290 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nreal anguish for the cause of God has touched your hearts, so little\nperplexity and real distress have you borne for others, that you are\nno more prepared to appreciate his work than is a ten-year-old boy\nthe care, anxiety, and wearisome toil of his burdened father. The boy\nmay pass along joyous in spirit because he has not the experience\nof the burdened, careworn father. He may wonder at the fears and\nanxieties of the father, which look needless to him; but when years\nof experience shall be added to his life, when he takes hold of and\nbears its real burdens, then he may look back to his father\u2019s life and\nunderstand that which was mysterious to him in his boyhood; for\nbitter experience has given him knowledge.\nI was shown that you are in danger of getting above the simplicity[307]\nof the work and of placing yourself upon the pinnacle. You feel that\nyou need no reproof and counsel, and the language of your heart is:\n\u201cI am capable of judging, discriminating, and determining between\nright and wrong. I will not have my rights infringed upon. No one\nshall dictate to me. I am capable of forming my own plans of action.\nI am as good as anybody. God is with me and gives me success in\nmy efforts. Who has authority to interfere with me?\u201d These words I\nheard you utter, as your case was passing before me in vision, not\nto any person, but as if in conversation with yourself. My attending\nangel repeated these words, as he pointed to you both: \u201cExcept ye\nbe converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into\nthe kingdom of heaven. Whosoever shall humble himself as this\nlittle child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\u201d\nI saw that the strength of the children of God is in their humility.\nWhen they are little in their own eyes, Jesus will be to them their\nstrength and their righteousness, and God will prosper their labors. I\nwas shown that God would prove Brother A. He would give him a\nmeasure of prosperity; and if he would bear the test, if he would turn\nthe blessings of God to good account, not taking honor to himself\nand not becoming lifted up, selfish, and self-confident, the Lord\nwould continue His blessings for the sake of His cause and for His\nown glory.\nI saw, Brother A, that you were in the greatest danger of be-\ncoming lifted up, self-righteous, self-sufficient, and feeling that you\nare rich and in need of nothing. Unless you guard yourself upon\nthese points, the Lord will allow you to go on until you make your\nTo a Young Minister and His Wife 291\nweakness apparent to all. You will be brought into positions where\nyou will be sorely tempted if others do not regard you in as exalted a\nlight as you estimate yourself and your ability. I was shown that you\nwere poorly prepared to bear much prosperity and a great amount of\nsuccess. A thorough conversion alone will do the work necessary to\nbe done in your case.\nI have been shown that both of you are naturally selfish. You [308]\nare in constant danger, unless guarded, of thinking and acting in\nreference to yourselves. You will lay your plans for your own accom-\nmodation, without taking into account how much you may incon-\nvenience others. You are inclined to carry out your ideas and plans\nwithout regarding the plans and respecting the views or feelings of\nothers. Both of you should cultivate reverence and respect for others.\nBrother A, you have considered that your work was of too great\nimportance for you to come down to engage in household duties.\nYou have not a love for these requirements. You neglected them in\nyour younger days. But these small duties which you neglect are\nessential to the formation of a well-developed character.\nI have been shown that our ministers generally are deficient in\nmaking themselves useful in the families where they are entertained.\nSome devote their minds to study because they love this employment.\nThey do not feel that it is a duty which God enjoins upon ministers\nto make themselves a blessing in the families which they visit, but\nmany give their minds to books and shut themselves away from the\nfamily and do not converse with them upon the subjects of truth.\nThe religious interests in the family are scarcely mentioned. This\nis all wrong. Ministers who have not the burden and care of the\npublishing interest upon them, and who have not the perplexities and\nnumerous cares of all the churches, should not feel that their labor is\nexcessively hard. They should feel the deepest interest in the families\nthey visit; they should not feel that they are to be petted and waited\nupon while they give nothing in return. There is an obligation resting\nupon Christian families to entertain the ministers of Christ, and there\nis also a duty resting upon ministers who receive the hospitality of\nChristian friends to feel under mutual obligation to bear their own\nburdens as far as possible and not be a tax to their friends. Many\nministers entertain the idea that they must be especially favored and\n292 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nwaited upon, and they are frequently injured and their usefulness\ncrippled by being treated as pets.\nBrother and Sister A, while among your brethren you have too[309]\nfrequently made it a practice to make arrangements agreeable to\nyourselves and to take a course to gather attention to yourselves,\nwithout considering the convenience or inconvenience of others. You\nare in danger of making yourselves a center. You have received the\nattention and consideration of others when, for the good of your own\nsouls as well as for the benefit of others, you should have devoted\nmore attention to those you visited. Such a course would have\ngiven you far greater influence, and you would have been blessed in\nwinning more souls to the truth.\nBrother A, you have ability to present the truth to others. You\nhave an investigative mind; but there are serious defects in your\ncharacter, which I have mentioned and which must be overcome.\nYou neglect many of the little courtesies of life because you think so\nmuch of yourself that you do not realize that these little attentions\nare required of you. God would not have you burden others while\nyou neglect to see and do the things that someone must do. It does\nnot detract from the dignity of a gospel minister to bring in wood and\nwater when needed or to exercise by doing necessary work in the\nfamily where he is entertained. In not seeing these little important\nduties and improving the opportunity to do them, he deprives himself\nof real blessings and also deprives others of the good that it is their\nprivilege to receive from him.\nSome of our ministers do not have an amount of physical exer-\ncise proportionate to the taxation of the mind. As the result they\nare suffering from debility. There is no good reason why the health\nof ministers who have to perform only the ordinary duties devolv-\ning upon the minister should fail. Their minds are not constantly\nburdened with perplexing cares and heavy responsibilities in regard\nto the important institutions among us. I saw that there is no real\nreason why they should fail in this important period of the cause and\nwork if they will pay due regard to the light that God has given them\nin regard to how to labor and how to exercise, and will give proper\nattention to their diet.\nSome of our ministers eat very heartily and then do not exercise[310]\nsufficiently to work off the waste matter which accumulates in the\nTo a Young Minister and His Wife 293\nsystem. They will eat and then spend most of their time sitting\ndown, reading, studying, or writing, when a share of their time\nshould be devoted to systematic physical labor. Our preachers will\ncertainly break down in health unless they are more careful not to\noverload the stomach by too great a quantity of even healthful food.\nI saw that you, Brother and Sister A, were both in danger on this\npoint. Overeating prevents the free flow of thought and words, and\nthat intensity of feeling which is so necessary in order to impress\nthe truth upon the heart of the hearer. The indulgence of appetite\nbeclouds and fetters the mind, and blunts the holy emotions of the\nsoul. The mental and moral powers of some of our preachers are\nenfeebled by improper eating and lack of physical exercise. Those\nwho crave great quantities of food should not indulge their appetite,\nbut should practice self-denial and retain the blessings of active\nmuscles and unoppressed brains. Overeating stupefies the entire\nbeing by diverting the energies from the other organs to do the work\nof the stomach.\nThe failure of our ministers to exercise all the organs of the body\nproportionately causes some organs to become worn, while others\nare weak from inaction. If wear is left to come almost exclusively\nupon one organ or set of muscles, the one most used must become\noverwearied and greatly weakened. Each faculty of the mind, and\neach muscle, has its distinctive office, and all are required to be\nequally exercised in order to become properly developed and to\nretain healthful vigor. Each organ has its work to do in the living\norganism. Every wheel in the machinery must be a living, active,\nworking wheel. All the faculties have a bearing upon one another,\nand all need to be exercised in order to be properly developed.\nBrother and Sister A, neither of you enjoy physical, domestic\nlabor. Both of you need to cultivate a love for the practical duties of\nlife. This education is necessary for your health and will increase [311]\nyour usefulness. You think too much of what you eat. You should\nnot touch those things which will give a poor quality of blood; both\nof you have scrofula.\nBrother A, your love for reading and your dislike for physical\ntaxation, while talking and exercising your throat, make you liable\nto disease of the throat and lungs. You should be guarded and should\nnot speak hurriedly, rattling off what you have to say as though you\n294 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nhad a lesson to repeat. You should not let the labor come upon the\nupper portion of the vocal organs, for this will constantly wear and\nirritate them, and will lay the foundation for disease. The action\nshould come upon the abdominal muscles. The lungs and throat\nshould be the channel, but should not do all the work.\nI was shown that the manner in which you and your wife eat\nwill bring disease, which, when once fastened upon you, will not\nbe easily overcome. You may both bear up for years and not show\nany special signs of breaking, but cause will be followed by the sure\nresults. God will not work a miracle for either of you to preserve\nyour health and life. You must eat and study and work understand-\ningly, following enlightened conscience. Our preachers should all be\nsincere, genuine health reformers, not merely adopting the reforms\nbecause others do, but from principle, in obedience to the word of\nGod. God has given us great light upon the health reform, which He\nrequires us all to respect. He does not send light to be rejected or\ndisregarded by His people without their suffering the consequences.\nPioneers in the Cause\nI was shown that neither of you really know yourselves. If God\nshould let the enemy loose upon you, as He did upon His servant\nJob, He would not find in you that spirit of steadfast integrity that\nHe found in Job, but a spirit of murmuring and of unbelief. Had\nyou been situated at Battle Creek during my husband\u2019s illness, at the\ntime of the trial of our brethren and sisters there, when Satan had[312]\nspecial power upon them, both of you would have drunk deep of\ntheir spirit of jealousy and faultfinding. You would have been among\nthe number, as zealous as the rest, to make a diseased, careworn\nman, a paralytic, an offender for a word.\nYou are inclined to offset your deficiencies by magnifying and\ndwelling upon the wrongs you suppose exist in Brother and Sister\nWhite; and had you an opportunity, as those had in Battle Creek, you\nwould venture to go to greater lengths than did some of them in their\nwicked crusade against us; for you have less faith and less reverence\nthan some of them had, and would be less inclined to respect our\nwork and our calling.\nTo a Young Minister and His Wife 295\nI was shown that, notwithstanding you have before you the sad\nexperience and example of others who have become disaffected and\nhave murmured and been faultfinding and jealous of us, you would\nfail to be warned by their example, and God would test your fidelity\nand reveal the secrets of your hearts. Your distrust, suspicions, and\njealousies would be revealed, and your weaknesses exposed, that\nyou might see them and understand yourselves, if you would.\nI saw you listening to the conversation of men and women,\nand saw that you were only too pleased to gather up their views\nand impressions that were detrimental to our labors. Some found\nfault with one thing, and some with another, as did the murmurers\namong the children of Israel when Moses was their leader. Some\nwere censuring our course, saying that we were not as conservative\nas we ought to be; we did not seek to please the people as we\nmight; we talked too plainly; we reproved too sharply. Some were\ntalking in regard to Sister White\u2019s dress, picking at straws. Others\nwere expressing dissatisfaction with the course that Brother White\npursued, and remarks were passing from one to another, questioning\ntheir course and finding fault. An angel stood before these persons,\nunseen by them, busily writing their words in the book which is to\nbe opened to the view of God and angels.\nSome are eagerly watching for something to condemn in Brother [313]\nand Sister White, who have grown gray in their service in the cause\nof God. Some express their views that the testimony of Sister White\ncannot be reliable. This is all that many unconsecrated ones want.\nThe testimonies of reproof have checked their vanity and pride; but\nif they dared, they would go to almost any length in fashion and\npride. God will give all such an opportunity to prove themselves and\nto develop their true characters.\nSome years ago I saw that we would yet have to meet the same\nspirit which rose at Paris, Maine, and which has never been thor-\noughly cured. It has slumbered, but it is not dead. From time to\ntime this spirit of determined murmuring and rebellion has cropped\nout in different individuals who have at some time been leavened\nwith this wicked spirit which has followed us for years. Sister A,\nthis spirit has been cherished by you to some extent, and has had an\ninfluence to mold your views and feelings. Sanctimonious infidelity\nhas been gradually growing in the mind of C, and it is not now easy,\n296 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\neven for her, to get rid of it. This same determined spirit which held\nD and others in Maine in a fanatical delusion so long, against every\ninfluence to lead them to the truth, has had a powerful, deceptive\ninfluence over E\u2019s mind in -----, and the same influence has affected\nyou. You were of that calm, determined, unyielding temperament\nthat the enemy could affect, and the same results, only in a greater\ndegree, will attend your influence, if wrong, as attended that of Sister",

      "text": "Feelings of suspicion, jealousy, and unbelief have for years been\ngaining power upon your mind. You have a hatred for reproof. You\nare very sensitive, and your sympathies arise at once for anyone who\nis reproved. This is not a sanctified feeling, and is not prompted\nby the Spirit of God. Brother and Sister A, I was shown that when\nthis spirit of faultfinding and murmuring should be developed in\nyou, when it should be manifested and the leaven of dissatisfaction,\njealousy, and unbelief which has cursed the life of E and her husband\nshould appear, we would have a work to do to meet it decidedly and\ngive that spirit no quarter; and that, until this should be developed, I[314]\nshould keep silent, for there was a time to speak and a time to keep\nsilent. I saw that, should apparent prosperity attend the labors of\nBrother A, unless he was a thoroughly converted man he would be\nin danger of losing his soul. He does not have becoming respect\nfor the position and labors of others; he considers himself second to\nnone.\nI was shown that temptations will continually increase in regard\nto the labors of Brother and Sister White. Our work is a peculiar\nwork, it is different in character from that of any others who labor\nin the field. God does not call ministers who have only to labor in\nword and doctrine to do our work, neither does He call us to do only\ntheir work. We each have, in some respects, a distinct work. God\nhas been pleased to open to me the secrets of the inner life and the\nhidden sins of His people. The unpleasant duty has been laid upon\nme to reprove wrongs and to reveal hidden sins. When I have been\ncompelled by the Spirit of God to reprove sins that others did not\nknow existed, it has stirred up the natural feelings in the hearts of the\nunsanctified. While some have humbled their hearts before God, and\nwith repentance and confession have forsaken their sins, others have\nfelt a spirit of hatred rise in their hearts. Their pride has been hurt\nTo a Young Minister and His Wife 297\nwhen their course has been reproved. They entertain the thought that\nit is Sister White who is hurting them, instead of feeling grateful\nto God that He has in mercy spoken to them through His humble\ninstrument, to show them their dangers and their sins, that they may\nput them away before it shall be too late for wrongs to be righted.\nSome are ready to inquire: Who told Sister White these things?\nThey have even put the question to me: Did anyone tell you these\nthings? I could answer them: Yes; yes, the angel of God has spoken\nto me. But what they mean is: Have the brethren and sisters been\nexposing their faults? For the future, I shall not belittle the testi-\nmonies that God has given me, to make explanations to try to satisfy\nsuch narrow minds, but shall treat all such questions as an insult to [315]\nthe Spirit of God. God has seen fit to thrust me into positions in\nwhich He has not placed any other one in our ranks. He has laid\nupon me burdens of reproof that He has not given to any other one.\nMy husband has stood by my side to sustain the testimonies and to\ngive his voice in union with the testimony of reproof. He has been\ncompelled to take a decided stand to press back the unbelief and\nrebellion which has been bold and defiant, and which would break\ndown any testimony that I might bear, because the ones reproved\nwere cut and felt deeply over the reproof given. This is exactly as\nGod designed. He meant that they should feel. It was necessary that\nthey should feel before their proud hearts would yield up their sins\nand they would cleanse their hearts and lives from all iniquity.\nIn every advance move that God has led us to make, in every\nstep gained by God\u2019s people, there have been ready tools of Satan\namong us, to stand back and suggest doubts and unbelief, and to\nthrow obstacles in our way, to weaken our faith and courage. We\nhave had to stand like warriors, ready to press and fight our way\nthrough the opposition raised. This has made our work tenfold harder\nthan it otherwise would have been. We have had to stand as firm\nand unyielding as a rock. This firmness has been interpreted to be\nhardheartedness and willfulness. God never designed that we should\nswerve, first to the right and then to the left, to gratify the minds\nof unconsecrated brethren. He designed that our course should be\nstraightforward. One and another have come to us, professing to\nhave a great burden for us to have us go this way or that, contrary to\nthe light that God has given us. What if we had followed these false\n298 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nlights and fanatical impressions? Surely our people should not then\nput confidence in us. We have had to set our faces as flints for the\nright and then press on to work and duty.\nSome among us have been ever ready to carry matters to ex-\ntremes, to overreach the mark. They seem to be without an anchor.\nSuch have greatly injured the cause of truth. There are others who[316]\nseem never to have a position where they can stand firmly and surely,\nready to battle if need be when God calls for faithful soldiers to be\nfound at the post of duty. There are those who will not make a\ncharge upon the enemy when required of God to do so. They will\ndo nothing until others have fought the battle and gained the victory\nfor them, and then they are ready to share the spoils. How much can\nGod count upon such soldiers? They are accounted as cowards in\nHis cause.\nThis class, I saw, gained no experience for themselves in regard\nto warfare against sin and Satan. They were more inclined to fight\nagainst the faithful soldiers of Christ than against Satan and his host.\nHad they girded on the armor and pressed into the battle, they would\nhave gained a valuable experience which it was their privilege to\nhave. But they had no courage to contend for the right, to venture\nsomething in the warfare, and to learn how to attack Satan and take\nhis strongholds. Some have no idea of running any risk or venturing\nanything themselves. But somebody must venture; someone must\nrun risks in this cause. Those who will not venture and expose\nthemselves to censure will stand all prepared to watch those who\ndo bear responsibilities, and will be ready, if there is a semblance\nof chance, to find fault with them and injure them if they can. This\nhas been the experience of Brother and Sister White in their labors.\nSatan and his host have been arrayed against them, but these were\nnot all; when those who should have stood by them in the warfare\nhave seen them overburdened and pressed beyond measure, they\nhave stood prepared to join Satan in his work to discourage and\nweaken them, and, if possible, drive them from the field.\nBrother and Sister A, I have been shown that as you have traveled\nyou have been looked up to and highly esteemed, and treated with\ngreater respect and deference than was for your good. It is not natural\nfor you to treat with like respect those who have borne the burdens\nwhich God has laid upon them in His cause and work. Both of you[317]\nTo a Young Minister and His Wife 299\nlove your ease. You are not inclined to be turned out of your course\nor to inconvenience yourselves. You desire to have things bend to\nyour convenience. You have large self-esteem and exalted opinions\nof your acquirements. You have not had the perplexing cares and\nburdens to bear, and the important decisions to make which involved\nthe interests of God\u2019s cause, that have fallen to the lot of my husband.\nGod has made him a counselor to His people, to advise and counsel\nsuch young men as yourself, as children in the truth. And when you\ntake that humble position which a true sense of your real state will\nlead you to take, you will be willing to be counseled. It is because of\nthe few responsibilities you have borne that you do not understand\nwhy Brother White should feel more deeply than you. There is just\nthis difference between you and him in this matter. He has invested\nthirty of the best years of his life to the cause of God, while you\nhave had but few years of experience and have had comparatively\nnothing of the hardships to meet that he has had.\nAfter those who led out in this work have labored hard to prepare\nthe truth and bring the work up ready to your hand, you embrace it\nand go out to labor, presenting the precious arguments which others,\nwith inexpressible anxiety, have searched out for you. While you\nare amply provided for in point of means, your weekly wages sure,\nleaving you no reason for care or anxiety in this direction, these\npioneers of the cause suffered deprivations of every kind. They\nhad no assurance of anything. They were dependent upon God and\nupon the few truehearted ones who received their labors. While you\nhave sympathizing brethren to sustain you and fully appreciate your\nlabors, the first laborers in this work had but very few to stand by\nthem. All could be counted in a few minutes. We knew what it was\nto go hungry for want of food and to suffer with cold for the want of\nsuitable clothing. We have traveled all night by private conveyance\nto visit the brethren, because we had no means with which to defray\nthe expenses of hotel fare. We traveled miles on foot, time and again, [318]\nbecause we had no money to hire a carriage. Oh, how precious was\nthe truth to us! how valuable souls purchased by the blood of Christ!\nWe have no complaints to make of our sufferings in those days of\nclose want and perplexity, which made the exercise of faith necessary.\nThey were the happiest days of our lives. There we learned the\nsimplicity of faith. There, while in affliction we tested and proved\n300 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthe Lord. He was our consolation. He was to us like the shadow of a\ngreat rock in a weary land. It is unfortunate for you, my brother, and\nfor our young ministers generally, that you and they have not had\na similar experience in privation, in trial, and in need; for such an\nexperience would be worth to you more than houses or lands, gold\nor silver.\nWhen we refer to our past experience of excessive labor and\nwant, and of laboring with our hands to support ourselves and to\npublish the truth at the very commencement of the work, some of\nour young preachers of but few years\u2019 experience in the work seem\nto be annoyed and charge us with boasting of our own works. The\nreason of this is that their own lives have been so free from wearing\ncare, want, and self-sacrifice that they know not how to sympathize\nwith us, and the contrast is not agreeable to their feelings. To have\npresented before them the experience of others which is in such wide\ncontrast with their own course does not make their labors appear in\nso favorable a light as they would have them.\nWhen we commenced this work we were both in feeble health.\nMy husband was a dyspeptic; yet three times a day, in faith, we\nmade our supplications to God for strength. My husband went into\nthe hayfield with his scythe, and, in the strength that God gave him\nin answer to our earnest prayers, he there earned, by mowing, means\nwith which to purchase us neat, plain clothing and to pay our fare to\na distant state to present the truth to our brethren.\nWe have a right to refer to the past, as did the apostle Paul. \u201cAnd[319]\nwhen I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no\nman: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came\nfrom Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from\nbeing burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself. As the\ntruth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in\nthe regions of Achaia.\u201d In referring to our past experience, we are\ncarrying out the exhortation of the apostle to the Hebrews: \u201cBut call\nto remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated,\nye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly, whilst ye were made a\ngazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye\nbecame companions of them that were so used.\u201d\nOur lives are interwoven with the cause of God. We have no\nseparate interest aside from this work. And when we see the ad-\nTo a Young Minister and His Wife 301\nvancement that the cause has made from a very small beginning,\ncoming up slowly yet surely to strength and prosperity; as we see\nthe success of the cause in which we have toiled, and suffered, and\nnearly sacrificed our lives, who shall prevent or forbid our boasting\nin God? Our experience in this cause is valuable to us. We have\ninvested everything in it.\nMoses was the meekest man that lived; yet, because of the mur-\nmurings of the children of Israel, he was repeatedly compelled to\nbring up their course of sin after leaving Egypt and to vindicate\nhis course as their leader. Just before leaving Israel, when he was\nabout to die, he rehearsed before them their course of rebellion and\nmurmuring since they had left Egypt, and how his interest and love\nfor them had led him to plead with God in their behalf. He related to\nthem how he had earnestly entreated of the Lord to let him pass over\nJordan into the Promised Land; \u201cbut the Lord was wroth with me for\nyour sakes, and would not hear me.\u201d Moses presented before them\ntheir sins, and said to them: \u201cYe have been rebellious against the\nLord from the day that I knew you.\u201d He related to them how many\ntimes he had pleaded with God and humbled his soul in anguish\nbecause of their sins.\nIt was the design of God that Moses should frequently remind [320]\nIsrael of their transgressions and rebellion, that they might humble\ntheir hearts before God in view of their sins. The Lord would not\nhave them forget the errors and sins which had provoked His anger\nagainst them. The rehearsal of their transgressions, and of the mer-\ncies and goodness of God to them, which they had not appreciated,\nwas not agreeable to their feelings. Nevertheless, God directed that\nthis should be done.\nI have been shown that young men like you, who have had but a\nfew years of imperfect experience in the cause of present truth, are\nnot the ones whom God will trust to bear weighty responsibilities\nand to lead out in this work. Such should manifest a delicacy in\ntaking positions which will conflict with the judgment and opinions\nof those of mature experience, whose lives have been interwoven\nwith the cause of God nearly as many years as you have lived and\nwho have had an active part in this work from its small beginning.\nGod will not select men of but little experience and considerable\nself-confidence to lead out in this sacred, important work. There is\n302 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nmuch at stake here. Men who have had but little experience in the\nsufferings, trials, opposition, and privations that have been endured\nto bring the work up to its present condition of prosperity should be\nvery jealous of themselves.\nYoung men who now engage in the work of preaching the truth\nshould cultivate modesty and humility. They should be careful\nhow they become exalted, lest they be overthrown. They will be\naccountable for the clear light of truth which now shines upon them.\nI saw that God is displeased with the disposition that some have to\nmurmur against those who have fought the heaviest battles for them\nand who endured so much in the commencement of the message,\nwhen the work went hard.\nThe experienced laborers, those who toiled under the weight and\nthe oppressive burdens when there were but few to help bear them,\nGod regards; and He has a jealous care for those who have proved[321]\nfaithful. He is displeased with those who are ready to find fault with\nand reproach those servants of God who have grown gray in building\nup the cause of present truth. Your reproaches and your murmurings,\nyoung men, will surely stand against you in the day of God. As long\nas God has not laid heavy responsibilities upon you, do not get out\nof your place and rely upon your own independent judgment and\nassume responsibilities for which you are not fitted.\nDear brother and sister, you need to cultivate watchfulness and\nhumility, and to be diligent in prayer. The more closely you live to\nGod, the more clearly will you discern your weaknesses and your\ndangers. A practical view of the law of God, a clear discernment of\nthe atonement of Christ, will give you a knowledge of yourselves\nand will show you wherein you fail to perfect Christian character.\nIn short, you both need a daily experience in God\u2019s will concerning\nyou. When you see your great spiritual lack you will realize the fact\nthat human depravity, specified in the word of God, is true in your\nexperience. You are both pharisaical, and are in danger of remaining\nvoluntarily and fearfully in the dark in regard to your dangers and\nyour true standing before God.\nYou both need to learn the duties which devolve upon you in the\nvarious circumstances and relations of life. You have neglected your\nduties to both God and man. Self-knowledge you need so much. The\nignorance of your own hearts leads you to overlook the necessity of\nTo a Young Minister and His Wife 303\na daily, living experience in the divine life. In a degree you overlook\nthe necessity of having a divine influence constantly with you. This\nis positively necessary in doing the work of God. If you neglect\nthis, and pass on in self-confidence and self-sufficiency, you will\nbe left to make very great blunders. You need constantly to cherish\nlowliness of mind and a spirit of dependence. He who feels his own\nweakness will look higher than himself and will feel the need of\nconstant strength from above. The grace of God will lead him to\nexercise and cherish a spirit of constant gratitude. He who is best\nacquainted with his own weakness will know that it is the matchless [322]\ngrace of God alone that will triumph over the rebellion of the heart.\nYou need to become acquainted with the weak as well as the\nstrong points in your characters, that you may be constantly guarded\nlest you engage in enterprises, and assume responsibilities, for which\nGod has never designed you. You should not compare your actions\nand measure your lives by any human standard, but with the rule of\nduty revealed in the Bible. You have a work to do for yourselves,\nBrother and Sister A, that you have not dreamed was necessary. For\nyears you have been cherishing temptations and jealousies in regard\nto us and our work. This is not pleasing to God. You may think\nthat you believe the testimonies that God has given, but unbelief in\nregard to their being of God is gaining ground with you.\nYour labors, Brother A, would be more effectual in the conver-\nsion of souls to the truth if you dwelt upon the practical as well as the\ntheoretical, having the living, practical elements in your own heart\nand carrying them out in your own life. You need to have a firmer\nhold from above. You are too dependent upon your surroundings.\nIf you have a large congregation, you are elevated, and you desire\nto address them. But sometimes your congregations diminish, your\nspirits sink, and you have but little courage to labor. Surely some-\nthing is wanting. Your hold is not firm enough upon God. Some of\nthe most important truths in the teachings of Christ were preached by\nHim to one Samaritan woman who came to draw water as He, being\nweary, sat upon the well to rest. The fountain of living waters was\nwithin Him. The fountain of living waters must be in us, springing\nup to refresh those who are brought under our influence.\nChrist sought for men wherever He could find them\u2014in the\npublic streets, in private houses, in the synagogues, by the seaside.\n304 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nHe toiled all day, preaching to the multitude and healing the sick\nthat were brought to Him; and frequently, after He had dismissed\nthe people that they might return to their homes to rest and sleep, He\nspent the entire night in prayer, to come forth and renew His labors[323]\nin the morning. O brother and sister, you do not know anything in\nreality of self-denial and self-sacrifice for Christ and for the truth\u2019s\nsake. You must depend more fully upon God and less upon your\nown abilities. You need to hide in God.\nYou are inclined, Brother A, to be severe in reproof and to form\nyour own conclusions in regard to individuals, especially if their\ncourse has crossed your track; and, according to your views of the\ncase, you sometimes deal with them in an unsparing manner. You\nhave not been a tenderhearted, pitiful, courteous man, as was your\nExemplar. You need to soften your spirit, to be more courteous and\nkind, and to have greater disinterested benevolence. You need to\nbring your soul into closer communion with God by earnest prayer\nmixed with living faith. Every prayer offered in faith lifts the sup-\npliant above discouraging doubts and human passions. Prayer gives\nstrength to renew the conflict with the powers of darkness, to bear\ntrials patiently, and to endure hardness as good soldiers of Christ.\nWhile you take counsel with your doubts and fears, or try to\nsolve everything that you cannot see clearly before you have faith,\nyour perplexities will only increase and deepen. If you come to God,\nfeeling helpless and dependent, as you really are, and in humble,\ntrusting prayer make your wants known to Him whose knowledge is\ninfinite, who sees everything in creation and who governs everything\nby His will and word, He can and will attend to your cry, and will\nlet light shine into your heart and all around you; for through sincere\nprayer your soul is brought into connection with the mind of the\nInfinite. You may have no remarkable evidence at the time that the\nface of your Redeemer is bending over you in compassion and love,\nbut this is even so. You may not feel His visible touch, but His hand\nis upon you in love and pitying tenderness.\nGod loves both of you and wants to save you with an abundant\nsalvation. But it must not be in your way, but in God\u2019s own ap-\npointed way. You must comply with the conditions laid down in[324]\nthe Scriptures of truth, and God will as surely fulfill on His part as\nHis throne is sure. Because the admonitions that God sends to His\nTo a Young Minister and His Wife 305\npeople are humiliating to human nature, you must not, my brother,\nrise up against these reproofs and warnings. You need to die daily,\nto experience a daily crucifixion to self.\nAccording to the light that God has given me in vision, wicked-\nness and deception are increasing among God\u2019s people who profess\nto keep His commandments. Spiritual discernment to see sin as\nit exists, and then to put it out of the camp, is decreasing among\nGod\u2019s people; and spiritual blindness is fast coming upon them.\nThe straight testimony must be revived, and it will separate those\nfrom Israel who have ever been at war with the means that God has\nordained to keep corruptions out of the church. Wrongs must be\ncalled wrongs. Grievous sins must be called by their right name. All\nof God\u2019s people should come nearer to Him and wash their robes of\ncharacter in the blood of the Lamb. Then will they see sin in the true\nlight and will realize how offensive it is in the sight of God.\nIt seemed a small matter to our first parents, when tempted, to\ntransgress the command of God in one small act and eat of a tree that\nwas beautiful to the eye and pleasant to the taste. To the transgressors\nthis was but a small act, but it destroyed their allegiance to God and\nopened a flood of woe and guilt which has deluged the world. Who\ncan know, in the moment of temptation, the terrible consequences\nwhich will result from one wrong, hasty step! Our only safety is\nto be shielded by the grace of God every moment, and not put out\nour own spiritual eyesight so that we will call evil, good, and good,\nevil. Without hesitation or argument, we must close and guard the\navenues of the soul against evil.\nIt will cost us an effort to secure eternal life. It is only by long\nand persevering effort, sore discipline, and stern conflict that we\nshall be overcomers. But if we patiently and determinedly, in the\nname of the Conqueror who overcame in our behalf in the wilderness [325]\nof temptation, overcome as He overcame, we shall have the eternal\nreward. Our efforts, our self-denial, our perseverance, must be\nproportionate to the infinite value of the object of which we are in\npursuit.\nYou must not allow your sympathies for yourselves to shield you\nand others in wrong because you see nothing in outward appearances\nto condemn. God sees; He can read the motives and purposes of the\nsoul. I entreat you in the name of our Master, who has called us and\n306 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nappointed us our work, to keep your hands off and leave us to do\nthe work that God has laid upon us. Keep your words of sympathy\nand pity for those who really deserve them, those who are pressed\nby the Spirit of God to show His people their transgressions and\nthe house of Israel their sins. Error and sin in these last days are\nembraced more readily than truth and righteousness. The soldiers of\nthe cross of Christ are now required to gird on the Christian armor\nand to press back the moral darkness that is flooding the world.\nGod will give both of you precious victories if you surrender\nyourselves wholly to Him and let His grace subdue your proud hearts.\nYour self-righteousness will avail nothing with God. Nothing should\nbe done by fits and starts or in a spirit of rashness. Wrongs cannot\nbe righted, nor reformations in character made, by a few feeble,\nintermittent efforts. Sanctification is not a work of a day or a year,\nbut of a lifetime. Without continual efforts and constant activity,\nthere can be no advancement in the divine life, no attainment of the\nvictor\u2019s crown. We are doing up work for the judgment, and it is\nunsafe to work in our own wisdom and trust to our own judgment.\nWith the spirit of self-confidence that you now possess, neither of\nyou could be happy in heaven; for there all, even the exalted angels,\nare subordinate. You have yet to learn subordination and submission.\nBoth of you must be transformed by the grace of God.\nSister A, I saw that you should be careful that you do not open\na door of temptation to your husband that you cannot close at will.[326]\nIt is easier to invite the enemy into your hearts than to dismiss him\nafter he has the ground. Your pride is easily hurt, and you need\nto come closer to God, and seek with earnestness for grace, divine\ngrace, to endure hardness as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. God\nwill be your helper if you choose Him for your strength. Both of\nyou should encourage greater devotion to God. The only way to\nwatch humbly is to watch prayerfully. Do not for a moment think\nthat you may sit down and enjoy yourselves, and study your own\npleasure and convenience. The life of Christ is our example. He\nwas a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; He was wounded,\nHe was bruised. You are too well satisfied with your position. You\nhave need of constant watchfulness, lest Satan beguile you through\nhis subtlety, corrupt your minds, and lead you into inconsistencies\nand gross darkness. Your watchfulness should be characterized by\nTo a Young Minister and His Wife 307\na spirit of humble dependence upon God. It should not be carried\non with a proud, self-reliant spirit, but with a deep sense of your\npersonal weakness and a childlike trust in the promises of God.\nIt is now an easy and pleasant task to preach the truth of the third\nangel\u2019s message, in comparison with what it was when the message\nfirst started, when the numbers were few and we were looked upon\nas fanatics. Those who bore the responsibility of the work in the\nrise and early progress of the message knew what conflict, distress,\nand soul anguish were. Night and day the burden was heavy upon\nthem. They thought not of rest or convenience even when they were\npressed with suffering and disease. The shortness of time called for\nactivity, and the laborers were few.\nFrequently, when brought into strait places, the entire night has\nbeen spent in earnest, agonizing prayer with tears for help from God\nand for light to shine upon His word. When the light has come and\nthe clouds have been driven back, what joy and grateful happiness\nhave rested upon the anxious, earnest seekers! Our gratitude to God\nwas as complete as had been our earnest, hungering cry for light.\nSome nights we could not sleep because our hearts were overflowing [327]\nwith love and gratitude to God.\nMen who now go forth to preach the truth have things made\nready to their hand. They cannot now experience such privations as\nthe laborers in present truth have endured before them. The truth has\nbeen brought out, link after link, till it forms a clear, connected chain.\nTo bring the truth out in such clearness and harmony has required\ncareful research. Opposition, the most bitter and determined, drove\nthe servants of God to the Lord and to their Bibles. Precious indeed\nto them was the light which came from God.\nI have been shown that the reason why some cannot discern the\nright is because they have so long cherished the enemy, who has\nworked side by side with them while they have not discerned his\npower. It sometimes seems hard to wait patiently till God\u2019s time\ncomes to vindicate the right. But I have been shown that if we\nbecome impatient we lose a rich reward. As faithful husbandmen in\nGod\u2019s great field, we must sow with tears and be patient and hopeful.\nWe must meet troubles and sorrows. Temptations and wearisome\ntoil will afflict the soul, but we must patiently wait in faith to reap\nwith joy. In the final victory God will have no use for those persons\n308 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nwho are nowhere to be found in time of peril and danger, when\nthe strength, courage, and influence of all are required to make a\ncharge upon the enemy. Those who stand like faithful soldiers to\nbattle against wrong, and to vindicate the right, warring against\nprincipalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this\nworld, against spiritual wickedness in high places, will each receive\nthe commendation from the Master: \u201cWell done, good and faithful\nservant: ... enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d\nNever was there greater need of faithful warnings and reproofs,\nand close, straight dealing, than at this very time. Satan has come\ndown with great power, knowing that his time is short. He is flooding\nthe world with pleasing fables, and the people of God love to have\nsmooth things spoken to them. Sin and iniquity are not abhorred.[328]\nI was shown that God\u2019s people must make more firm, determined\nefforts to press back the incoming darkness. The close work of the\nSpirit of God is needed now as never before. Stupidity must be\nshaken off. We must arouse from the lethargy that will prove our\ndestruction unless we resist it. Satan has a powerful, controlling\ninfluence upon minds. Preachers and people are in danger of being\nfound upon the side of the powers of darkness. There is no such\nthing now as a neutral position. We are all decidedly for the right or\ndecidedly with the wrong. Said Christ: \u201cHe that is not with Me is\nagainst Me; and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad.\u201d\nThere are ever to be found those who will sympathize with those\nwho are wrong. Satan had sympathizers in heaven, and took large\nnumbers of the angels with him. God and Christ and heavenly\nangels were on one side, and Satan on the other. Notwithstanding\nthe infinite power and majesty of God and Christ, angels became\ndisaffected. The insinuations of Satan took effect, and they really\ncame to believe that the Father and the Son were their enemies and\nthat Satan was their benefactor. Satan has the same power and the\nsame control over minds now, only it has increased a hundredfold\nby exercise and experience. Men and women today are deceived,\nblinded by his insinuations and devices, and know it not. By giving\nplace to doubts and unbelief in regard to the work of God, and by\ncherishing feelings of distrust and cruel jealousies, they are preparing\nthemselves for complete deception. They rise up with bitter feelings\nTo a Young Minister and His Wife 309\nagainst the ones who dare to speak of their errors and reprove their\nsins.\nThose who have in the fear of God ventured out to faithfully\nmeet error and sin, calling sin by its right name, have discharged a\ndisagreeable duty with much suffering of feelings to themselves; but\nthey get the sympathy of but few and suffer the neglect of many. The\nsympathizers are on the wrong side, and they carry out the purposes\nof Satan to defeat the design of God.\nReproofs always hurt human nature. Many are the souls that [329]\nhave been destroyed by the unwise sympathy of their brethren; for,\nbecause the brethren sympathized with them, they thought they must\nindeed have been abused, and that the reprover was all wrong and\nhad a bad spirit. The only hope for sinners in Zion is to fully see\nand confess their wrongs, and put them away. Those who step in\nto destroy the edge of sharp reproof that God sends, saying that the\nreprover was partly wrong and the reproved was not just right, please\nthe enemy. Any way that Satan can devise to make the reproofs of\nnone effect will accomplish his design. Some will lay blame upon\nthe one whom God has sent with a message of warning, saying, He\nis too severe; and in so doing they become responsible for the soul\nof the sinner whom God desired to save, and to whom, because He\nloved him, He sent correction, that he might humble his soul before\nGod and put his sins from him. These false sympathizers will have\nan account to settle with the Master by-and-by for their work of\ndeath.\nThere are many who profess to believe the truth who are blind to\ntheir own danger. They cherish iniquity in their hearts and practice\nit in their lives. Their friends cannot read their hearts, and frequently\nthink that such are all right.\nBlack Hawk, Colorado,\nAugust 12, 1873\n* * * * *\nChapter 30\u2014Daydreaming\nDear Sister E,\nI have been shown that you need a thorough conversion. You\nhave accepted the truth, but have not received the blessings that\nthe truth brings, because you have not experienced its transforming\npower. You are in danger of losing both worlds unless you have a\nmore thorough work of grace in your heart and unless your will is\nbrought into conformity to the mind and will of Christ.\nYou are not now on the right track to obtain that peace and[330]\nhappiness which the true, humble, cross-bearing believer is sure to\nreceive. You have the stamp of your father\u2019s character. You have\na selfish disposition; you do not realize this, but it is true. Your\nprincipal thoughts are for yourself, to please yourself, to do those\nthings which will be most agreeable to yourself, without reference\nto the happiness of those around you. You are making a mistake in\nsearching for happiness. If you find it, it will be in the performance\nof duty and the forgetfulness of self. While your thoughts are so\nmuch upon yourself, you cannot be happy.\nYou neglect to cheerfully engage in the work which God has left\nyou to do. You overlook the common, simple duties lying directly\nin your pathway, and your mind wanders off to some greater work,\nwhich you imagine will be more congenial to your taste, and which\nwill supply the lack in your life, the barrenness in your soul. You\nwill surely be disappointed here. The work which God has left you\nto do is to take up the common, everyday duties which are right\naround you and do the plain, homely duties of life cheerfully, not\nmechanically, but having your heart in what you do, performing with\nyour heart, as well as with your hands, the simple duties which lie\nbefore you.\nYou do not study to make others happy; your eyes are not open,\ntrying to discern what little things you can do, what little attentions\nin the daily courtesies of life you can show to your parents and the\nmembers of the household. You have felt too much that it was a\n310\nDaydreaming 311\nvirtue to shut yourself away from the family, and brood over your\nunhappy thoughts and unhappy experience, gathering thorns, and\ntaking satisfaction in wounding yourself with them. You indulge in\na dreamy habit, which must be broken up. You leave duties undone.\nWork which you ought to do to relieve others you neglect for the\npleasure of indulging your own unhappy musings. You do not know\nyourself. Up to duty! Arouse yourself and take up your neglected\nduty. Redeem the past by future faithfulness. Take hold of the work\nbefore you, and, in the faithful performance of duty, you will forget\nyourself and will not have time to muse and become gloomy, and [331]\nfeel disagreeable and unhappy.\nYou have almost everything to learn in the Christian experience.\nYou are not improving as fast as you might, and as you must, if you\never obtain eternal life. You are now forming a character for heaven\nor one which will debar you from heaven. You have had your mind\nand thoughts so engrossed in yourself that you have not realized\nwhat you must do in order to become a true follower of the meek and\nlowly Jesus. You have neglected your home duties. You have been a\ncloud and a shadow in the family, when it was your privilege to shed\nlight and be a blessing to the dear ones around you. You have been\npettish, fretful, and unhappy, when there was, in reality, nothing to\nmake you so. You have not been awake to see what you might do\nto lift the burdens from your mother and to bless your parents in\nevery way possible. You have looked to your parents and sisters to\nhelp you to be happy and to minister to you, to do for you, while\nyour thoughts have been centered upon yourself. You have not had\nthe grace of God in your heart, while you have deceived yourself\nin thinking that you were really advanced in the knowledge of the\ndivine will.\nYou have been ready to engage in conversation with those not of\nour faith, when it was impossible for you to present an intelligent\nreason of our faith before them. In this you do not rightly represent\nthe truth and do much more injury to the cause of truth than you do\ngood. If you should talk less in vindication of our faith and study\nyour Bible more and let your deportment be of that character which\nwould testify that the influence of the truth was good upon your heart\nand life, you would do far more good than by mere talk, while you\nlack faithfulness in so many things.\n312 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nIf you are careful to follow the example of our self-denying,\nself-sacrificing Redeemer, who was ever seeking to do good and\nto bless others, but not to find ease and pleasure and enjoyment\nfor Himself, you will then bless others with your influence. In our\nmingling in society, in families or in whatever relations of life we are\nplaced, either limited or extended, there are many ways wherein we[332]\nmay acknowledge our Lord and many ways wherein we may deny\nHim. We may deny Him in our words, by speaking evil of others,\nby foolish talking, jesting and joking, by idle or unkind words, or\nby prevaricating, speaking contrary to truth. In our words we may\nconfess that Christ is not in us. In our character we may deny Him\nby loving our ease, by shunning the duties and burdens of life which\nsomeone must bear if we do not, and by loving sinful pleasure. We\nmay also deny Christ by pride of dress and conformity to the world,\nor by uncourteous behavior. We may deny Him by loving our own\nopinions and by seeking to maintain and justify self. We may also\ndeny Him in allowing the mind to run in the channel of lovesick\nsentimentalism and to brood over our supposed hard lot and trials.\nNo one can truly confess Christ before the world unless the mind\nand spirit of Christ live in him. It is impossible to communicate that\nwhich we have not. The conversation and the deportment should be\na real and visible expression of grace and truth within. If the heart is\nsanctified, submissive, and humble, the fruits will be seen outwardly\nand will be a most effectual confession of Christ. Words and pro-\nfession are not enough. You, my sister, must have something more\nthan this. You are deceiving yourself. Your spirit, your character,\nand your actions do not show a spirit of meekness, self-denial, and\ncharity. Words and profession may express much humility and love;\nbut if the conduct is not regulated daily by the grace of God, you\nare not a partaker of the heavenly gift, you have not forsaken all\nfor Christ, you have not surrendered your own will and pleasure to\nbecome His disciple.\nYou commit sin and deny your Saviour by dwelling on gloomy\nthings, by gathering trials to yourself, and by borrowing troubles.\nYou bring the troubles of tomorrow into today, and embitter your\nown heart, and bring burdens and a cloud upon those around you, by\nmanufacturing trials. The precious probationary time that God has\ngiven you in which to do good and become rich in good works you\nDaydreaming 313\nare very unwise to employ in thinking unhappy thoughts and in airy [333]\ncastle-building. You suffer your imagination to run upon subjects\nthat will bring you no relief or happiness. Your daydreaming stands\ndirectly in the way of your obtaining a sound, healthy, intelligent\nexperience in the things of God and a moral fitness for the better\nlife.\nThe truth of God received into the heart is able to make you wise\nunto salvation. In believing and obeying it you will receive grace\nsufficient for the duties and trials of today. Grace for tomorrow\nyou do not need. You should feel that you have only to do with\ntoday. Overcome for today; deny self for today; watch and pray\nfor today; obtain victories in God for today. Our circumstances\nand surroundings, the changes daily transpiring around us, and the\nwritten word of God which discerns and proves all things\u2014these are\nsufficient to teach us our duty and just what we ought to do, day by\nday. Instead of suffering your mind to run in a channel of thought\nfrom which you will derive no benefit, you should be searching the\nScriptures daily and doing those duties in daily life which may now\nbe irksome to you, but which must be done by someone.\nThe beauties of nature have a tongue that speaks to our senses\nwithout ceasing. The open heart can be impressed with the love and\nglory of God as seen in the works of His hand. The listening ear can\nhear and understand the communications of God through the works\nof nature. There is a lesson in the sunbeam and in the various objects\nin nature that God has presented to our view. The green fields, the\nlofty trees, the buds and flowers, the passing cloud, the falling rain,\nthe babbling brook, the sun, moon, and stars in the heavens, all invite\nour attention and meditation, and bid us become acquainted with\nGod, who made them all. The lessons to be learned from the various\nobjects of the natural world are these: They are obedient to the will\nof their Creator; they never deny God, never refuse obedience to\nany intimation of His will. Fallen beings alone refuse to yield full\nobedience to their Maker. Their words and works are at variance [334]\nwith God and opposed to the principles of His government.\nYour thoughts are not elevated. There is enough in the natural\nworld to lead you to love and adore your Creator. There is food\nfor thought without shutting yourself away to feed on disappointed\nhopes and perverted imaginings. Do not be ready to talk with unbe-\n314 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nlievers and to enter into argument with those who oppose the truth,\nfor you are not furnished with Scripture knowledge to do this. You\nhave neglected to study your Bible. You can best recommend the\ntruth by the meekness of your life and the faithful discharge of your\ndaily duties. If you are conscientiously strict to do your part, and\nare faithful and earnest to see what you can and should do for those\nfor whom you labor, you will then better represent the truth. The\nbest way in which you can recommend the truth is, not by argument,\nnot by talk, but by living it daily, by leading a consistent, modest,\nhumble life as a disciple of Christ.\nIt is a sad thing to be discontented with our surroundings or\nwith the circumstances which have placed us where our duties seem\nhumble and unimportant. Private and humble duties are distasteful\nto you; you are restless, uneasy, and dissatisfied. All this springs\nfrom selfishness. You think more of yourself than others think of\nyou. You love yourself better than you love your parents, sisters, and\nbrother, and better than you love God. You desire more congenial\nlabor, for which you think you will be better fitted. You are not\nwilling to work and wait in the humble sphere of action where God\nhas placed you, until He proves and tests you, and you demonstrate\nyour ability and fitness for a higher position. Blessed are the meek:\nfor they shall inherit the earth.\u201d The spirit of meekness is not a spirit\nof discontent, but it is directly the opposite.\nThose professed Christians who are constantly whining and\ncomplaining, and who seem to think happiness and a cheerful coun-\ntenance a sin, have not the genuine article of religion. Those who\nlook upon nature\u2019s beautiful scenery as they would upon a dead[335]\npicture, who choose to look upon dead leaves rather than to gather\nthe beautiful living flowers, who take a mournful pleasure in all that\nis melancholy in the language spoken to them by the natural world,\nwho see no beauty in valleys clothed with living green and grand\nmountain heights clothed with verdure, who close their senses to the\njoyful voice which speaks to them in nature and which is sweet and\nmusical to the listening ear\u2014these are not in Christ. They are not\nwalking in the light, but are gathering to themselves darkness and\ngloom, when they could just as well have brightness and the blessing\nof the Sun of Righteousness arising in their hearts with healing in\nHis beams.\nDaydreaming 315\nMy young sister, you are living an imaginary life. You can\nnot detect or realize a blessing in anything. You imagine troubles\nand trials which do not exist; you exaggerate little annoyances into\ngrievous trials. This is not the meekness which Christ blessed. It is an\nunsanctified, rebellious, unfilial discontent. Meekness is a precious\ngrace, willing to suffer silently, willing to endure trials. Meekness is\npatient and labors to be happy under all circumstances. Meekness\nis always thankful and makes its own songs of happiness, making\nmelody in the heart to God. Meekness will suffer disappointment\nand wrong, and will not retaliate. Meekness is not to be silent and\nsulky. A morose temper is the opposite of meekness; for this only\nwounds and gives pain to others, and takes no pleasure to itself.\nYou have but just entered the school of Christ. You have almost\neverything yet to learn. You do not now dress extravagantly, but you\nhave pride of appearance. You desire to dress with less simplicity.\nYou think considerably more of dress than you should. Christ invites\nyou: Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will\ngive you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am\nmeek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For\nMy yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\u201d Submit your neck to the\nyoke which Christ imposes and you will find in this submission the\nvery happiness that you have tried to gain to yourself in your own [336]\nway by following your own course.\nYou may be cheerful if you will bring even your thoughts into\nsubjection to the will of Christ. You should make no delay, but\nclosely search your own heart and die to self daily. You may inquire:\nHow can I master my own actions and control my inward emotions?\nMany who profess not the love of God do control their spirit to a\nconsiderable extent without the aid of the special grace of God. They\ncultivate self-control. This is indeed a rebuke to those who know\nthat from God they may obtain strength and grace, and yet do not\nexhibit the graces of the Spirit. Christ is our model. He was meek\nand lowly. Learn of Him, and imitate His example. The Son of God\nwas faultless. We must aim at this perfection and overcome as He\novercame, if we would have a seat at His right hand.\nYou have peculiarities of character which need to be sternly\ndisciplined and resolutely controlled before you can with any safety\nenter the marriage relation. Therefore marriage should be put from\n316 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nyour mind until you overcome the defects in your character, for\nyou would not make a happy wife. You have neglected to educate\nyourself for systematic household labor. You have not seen the\nnecessity of acquiring habits of industry. The habit of enjoying\nuseful labor, once formed, will never be lost. You are then prepared\nto be placed in any circumstance in life, and you will be fitted for the\nposition. You will learn to love activity. If you enjoy useful labor,\nyour mind will be occupied with your employment, and you will not\nfind time to indulge in dreamy fancies.\nKnowledge of useful labor will impart to your restless and dis-\nsatisfied mind energy, efficiency, and a becoming, modest dignity,\nwhich will command respect. You know but very little of yourself;\nyou know not the deceptions of your own heart. The heart is de-\nceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Search your heart\ncarefully, and take time for meditation and prayer. Unless you see\nthe defects in your character and with genuine sincerity correct your\nerrors, you cannot be a disciple of Christ.\nYou love to think and talk about young men. You interpret their[337]\ncivilities as a special regard for yourself. You flatter yourself that\nyou are more highly esteemed than you really are. Your conversation\nshould be upon subjects that will profit, that will refine and elevate.\nYou are not, my dear child, cultivating habits of frankness and\nsincerity. Your heart is not right. Your influence is not good upon the\nyoung, for you have not the mind of Christ; yet you flatter yourself\nthat you have made great advancement in the Christian life.\nA reformation must commence in your father\u2019s family. You bear\nthe stamp of your father\u2019s character. You should endeavor to shun\nhis errors and his extremes. If you are truly a disciple of Christ you\nwill see important work to do at your home. Every family may be a\nperpetual school. The elder sisters can exert a strong influence upon\nthe younger members of the family. The younger, witnessing the\nexample of the older, will be led more by the principle of imitation\nthan by oft-repeated precepts. The eldest daughter should ever feel\nit a Christian duty devolving upon her to aid the mother in bearing\nher many toilsome burdens. Hours are worse than lost that are spent\nin bed, in sleep, or in gloomy musings, while the shoulders of some\nin the family are bowed to carry the heavy, toilsome load.\nDaydreaming 317\nThe elder daughters may assist in the education of the younger\nmembers of the family. Here is an excellent opportunity for you,\nkindly, diligently, and having the fear of the Lord before you, to\nteach those less advanced than yourself. You may gain the affections\nof those you try to help. You may here have one of the best of schools\nin which to exercise the Christian graces. You do not love children.\nIn fact, you do not love anything which requires steady, earnest,\npersevering effort. You do not love steady application. You love\nchange and variety, and are constantly seeking to find something\nthat will please yourself and give you happiness. You need self-\neducation, and you can obtain this better now than at any future time.\nYou have almost every change to make in your life, and may God\nhelp you to take hold of the work without delay. Only the pure, the [338]\ngood, and the holy will dwell with Christ when He cometh into His\nkingdom.\nYou cannot obtain heaven without earnest, persevering effort.\nAs viewed in the light of heaven, your life hitherto has been aimless\nand nearly useless. You now have opportunity to redeem the time\nand to wash your robe of character in the blood of the Lamb. God\nwill help you if you feel your need of His help. Your righteousness\nis of no value with God. It is only through the merits of Christ that\nyou will be victor at last. And if you can be among those who shall\nbe saved with an everlasting salvation, heaven will be cheap enough.\n318 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nNumber Twenty-Four\u2014Testimony for the [339]\nChurch\nChapter 31\u2014The Great Rebellion\nKorah, Dathan, and Abiram rebelled against Moses and Aaron,\nand so against the Lord. The Lord had placed special responsibil-\nities upon Moses and Aaron in selecting them for the priesthood\nand in conferring upon them the dignity and authority of leading\nthe congregation of Israel. Moses was afflicted by the continual\nrebellion of the Hebrews. As God\u2019s appointed, visible leader, he had\nbeen connected with the Israelites through seasons of peril, and had\nborne with their discontent, their jealousies, and their murmurings,\nwithout retaliation and without seeking to be released from his trying\nposition.\nWhen the Hebrews were brought into scenes of danger, or where\ntheir appetite was restricted, instead of trusting in God, who had\ndone wondrous things for them, they murmured against Moses. The\nSon of God, although invisible to the congregation, was the leader of\nthe Israelites. His presence went before them and conducted all their\ntravels, while Moses was their visible leader, receiving his directions\nfrom the Angel, who was Christ.\nBase Idolatry\nIn the absence of Moses the congregation demanded of Aaron to\nmake them gods to go before them and lead them back into Egypt.\nThis was an insult to their chief leader, the Son of the infinite God.\nOnly a few weeks before, they had stood trembling with awe and\nterror before the mount, listening to the words of the Lord: \u201cThou[340]\nshalt have no other gods before Me.\u201d The glory which sanctified\nthe mount when the voice was heard which shook the mountain\nto its foundation, still hovered over it in sight of the congregation;\nbut the Hebrews turned away their eyes and asked for other gods.\nMoses, their visible leader, was in converse with God in the mount.\nThey forgot the promise and the warning of God: \u201cBehold, I send an\nAngel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the\n320\nGreat Rebellion 321\nplace which I have prepared. Beware of Him, and obey His voice,\nprovoke Him not; for He will not pardon your transgressions: for\nMy name is in Him.\u201d\nThe Hebrews were cruelly unbelieving and basely ungrateful in\ntheir impious request: \u201cMake us gods, which shall go before us.\u201d If\nMoses was absent, the presence of the Lord remained; they were not\nforsaken. The manna continued to fall, and they were fed by a divine\nhand morning and evening. The cloudy pillar by day and the pillar\nof fire by night signified the presence of God, which was a living\nmemorial before them. The divine presence was not dependent upon\nthe presence of Moses. But at the very time that he was pleading\nwith the Lord in the mount in their behalf, they were rushing into\nshameful errors, into transgression of the law so recently given in\ngrandeur.\nHere we see the weakness of Aaron. Had he stood with true\nmoral courage and in boldness rebuked the leaders in this shameful\nrequest, his timely words would have saved that terrible apostasy.\nBut his desire to be popular with the congregation, and his fear of\nincurring their displeasure, led him to cowardly sacrifice the alle-\ngiance of the Hebrews in that decisive moment. He raised an altar,\nmade a graven image, and proclaimed a day in which to consecrate\nthat image as an object of worship and to proclaim before all Israel:\nThese be the gods which led you out of Egypt. While the top of the\nmount is still illuminated with the glory of God, he calmly witnesses\nthe merriment and dancing to this senseless image; and Moses is\nsent down from the mount by the Lord to rebuke the people. But\nMoses would not consent to leave the mount until his pleadings in [341]\nbehalf of Israel were heard and his request that God would pardon\nthem was granted.\nThe Tables of the Law Broken\nMoses came from the mount with the precious record in his\nhands, a pledge of God to man on condition of obedience. Moses was\nthe meekest man upon the earth, but when he viewed the apostasy\nof Israel he was angry and jealous for the glory of God. In his\nindignation he cast to the ground the precious pledge of God, which\nwas more dear to him than life. He saw the law broken by the\n322 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nHebrews, and in his zeal for God, to deface the idol that they were\nworshiping, he sacrificed the tables of stone. Aaron stood by, calmly,\npatiently bearing the severe censure of Moses. All this might have\nbeen prevented by a word from Aaron at the right time. True, noble\ndecision for the right in the hour of Israel\u2019s peril would have balanced\ntheir minds in the right direction.\nDoes God condemn Moses? No, no; the great goodness of\nGod pardons the rashness and zeal of Moses, because it was all on\naccount of his fidelity and his disappointment and grief at the sight\nof his eyes in the evidence of Israel\u2019s apostasy. The man who might\nhave saved the Hebrews in the hour of their peril is calm. He does\nnot show indignation because of the sins of the people, neither does\nhe reproach himself and manifest remorse under the sense of his\nwrongs; but he seeks to justify his course in a grievous sin. He makes\nthe people accountable for his weakness in yielding to their request.\nHe was unwilling to bear the murmuring of Israel and to stand under\nthe pressure of their clamors and unreasonable wishes, as Moses had\ndone. He entered into the spirit and feelings of the people without\nremonstrance, and then sought to make them responsible.\nThe congregation of Israel thought Aaron a much more pleasant\nleader than Moses. He was not so unyielding. They thought that\nMoses showed a very bad spirit, and their sympathies were with[342]\nAaron, whom Moses so severely censured. But God pardoned the\nindiscretion of honest zeal in Moses, while He held Aaron account-\nable for his sinful weakness and lack of integrity under a pressure of\ncircumstances. In order to save himself, Aaron sacrificed thousands\nof the Israelites. The Hebrews felt the punishment of God for this\nact of apostasy, but in a short time they were again full of discontent\nand rebellion.\nThe People Murmur\nWhen the armies of Israel prospered, they took all the glory to\nthemselves; but when they were tested and proved by hunger or\nwarfare they charged all their hardships to Moses. The power of God\nwhich was manifested in a remarkable manner in their deliverance\nfrom Egypt, and seen from time to time all through their journeyings,\nshould have inspired them with faith and forever closed their mouths\nGreat Rebellion 323\nfrom one expression of ingratitude. But the least apprehension of\nwant, the least fear of danger from any cause, overbalanced the\nbenefits in their favor and caused them to overlook the blessings\nreceived in their times of greatest danger. The experience they\npassed through in the matter of worshiping the golden calf should\nhave made so deep an impression upon their minds as never to be\neffaced. But although the marks of God\u2019s displeasure were fresh\nbefore them in their broken ranks and missing numbers because of\ntheir repeated offenses against the Angel who was leading them, they\ndid not take these lessons to heart and by faithful obedience redeem\ntheir past failure; and again they were overcome by the temptations\nof Satan.\nThe best efforts of the meekest man upon the earth could not quell\ntheir insubordination. The unselfish interest of Moses was rewarded\nwith jealousy, suspicion, and calumny. His humble shepherd\u2019s life\nwas far more peaceful and happy than his present position as pastor\nof that vast congregation of turbulent spirits. Their unreasonable\njealousies were more difficult to manage than the fierce wolves of\nthe wilderness. But Moses dared not choose his own course and do [343]\nas best pleased himself. He had left the shepherd\u2019s crook at God\u2019s\ncommand and in its place had received a rod of power. He dared not\nlay down this scepter and resign his position till God should dismiss\nhim.\nIt is Satan\u2019s work to tempt minds. He will insinuate his wily\nsuggestions and stir up doubting, questioning, unbelief, and distrust\nof the words and acts of the one who stands under responsibilities\nand who is seeking to carry out the mind of God in his labors. It is\nthe special purpose of Satan to pour upon and around the servants of\nGod\u2019s choice, troubles, perplexities, and opposition, so that they will\nbe hindered in their work and, if possible, discouraged. Jealousies,\nstrife, and evil surmising will counteract, in a great measure, the\nvery best efforts that God\u2019s servants, appointed to a special work,\nmay be able to put forth.\nSatan\u2019s plan is to drive them from the post of duty by working\nthrough agents. All whom he can excite to distrust and suspicion\nhe will use as his instruments. The position of Moses in carrying\nthe burdens that he bore for the Israel of God was not appreciated.\nThere is in the nature of man, when not under the direct influence of\n324 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthe Spirit of God, a disposition to envy, jealousy, and cruel distrust,\nwhich, if not subdued, will lead to a desire to undermine and tear\ndown others, while selfish spirits will seek to build themselves up\nupon their ruins.\nKorah, Dathan, and Abiram\nBy God\u2019s appointment these men had been entrusted with spe-\ncial honors. They had been of that number who, with the seventy\nelders, went up with Moses into the mount and beheld the glory of\nGod. They saw the glorious light which covered the divine form of\nChrist. The bottom of this cloud was in appearance like the \u201cpaved\nwork of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his\nclearness.\u201d These men were in the presence of the glory of the Lord\nand did eat and drink without being destroyed by the purity and\nunsurpassed glory that was reflected upon them. But a change had[344]\ncome. A temptation, slight at first, had been harbored; and as it was\nencouraged it had strengthened until the imagination was controlled\nby the power of Satan. These men upon the most frivolous pretense\nventured upon their work of disaffection. At first they hinted and\nexpressed doubts, which took so readily with many minds that they\nventured still further. And being more and more confirmed in their\nsuspicions by a word from one and another, each expressing what\nhe thought of certain things which had come under his notice, these\ndeluded souls really came to believe that they had a zeal for the\nLord in the matter and that they would not be excusable unless they\ncarried out to the full their purpose of making Moses see and feel\nthe preposterous position he occupied toward Israel. A little leaven\nof distrust and of dissension, envy, and jealousy was leavening the\ncamp of Israel.\nKorah, Dathan, and Abiram first commenced their cruel work\nupon the men to whom God had entrusted sacred responsibilities.\nThey were successful in alienating two hundred and fifty princes\nwho were famous in the congregation, men of renown. With these\nstrong and influential men on their side, they felt sure of making\na radical change in the order of things. They thought they could\ntransform the government of Israel and greatly improve it from its\npresent administration.\nGreat Rebellion 325\nKorah was not satisfied with his position. He was connected\nwith the service of the tabernacle, yet he desired to be exalted to\nthe priesthood. God had established Moses as chief governor, and\nthe priesthood was given to Aaron and his sons. Korah determined\nto compel Moses to change the order of things, that he might be\nraised to the dignity of the priesthood. To be more sure of accom-\nplishing his purpose, he drew Dathan and Abiram, descendants of\nReuben, into his rebellion. These reasoned that, being descendants\nof the eldest son of Jacob, the chief authority, which Moses usurped,\nbelonged to them; and, with Korah, they were resolved to obtain\nthe office of the priesthood. These three became very zealous in [345]\nan evil work and influenced two hundred and fifty men of renown,\nwho were also determined to have a share in the priesthood and the\ngovernment, to join them.\nGod had honored the Levites to do service in the tabernacle\nbecause they took no part in making and worshiping the golden\ncalf and because of their faithfulness in executing the order of God\nupon the idolaters. To the Levites was also assigned the office of\nerecting the tabernacle and encamping around about it, while the\nhosts of Israel pitched their tents at a distance from it. And when\nthey journeyed, the Levites took down the tabernacle and bore it and\nthe ark and all the sacred articles of furniture. Because God thus\nhonored the Levites, they became ambitious for still higher office,\nthat they might obtain greater influence with the congregation. \u201cAnd\nthey gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron,\nand said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the\ncongregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among\nthem: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation\nof the Lord?\u201d\nFlattery and False Sympathy\nThere is nothing which will please the people better than to be\npraised and flattered when they are in darkness and wrong, and\ndeserve reproof. Korah gained the ears of the people, and next their\nsympathies, by representing Moses as an overbearing leader. He\nsaid that he was too harsh, too exacting, too dictatorial, and that he\nreproved the people as though they were sinners when they were a\n326 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nholy people, sanctified to the Lord, and the Lord was among them.\nKorah rehearsed the incidents in their experience in their travels\nthrough the wilderness, where they had been brought into strait\nplaces, and where many of them had died because of murmuring\nand disobedience, and with their perverted senses they thought they\nsaw very clearly that all their trouble might have been saved if\nMoses had pursued a different course. He was too unyielding, too\nexacting, and they decided that all their disasters in the wilderness\nwere chargeable to him. Korah, the leading spirit, professed great[346]\nwisdom in discerning the true reason for their trials and afflictions.\nIn this work of disaffection there was greater harmony and union\nof views and feelings among these discordant elements than had\never been known to exist before. Korah\u2019s success in gaining the\nlarger part of the congregation of Israel on his side led him to feel\nconfident that he was wise and correct in judgment, and that Moses\nwas indeed usurping authority that threatened the prosperity and\nsalvation of Israel. He claimed that God had opened the matter to\nhim and laid upon him the burden of changing the government of\nIsrael just before it was too late. He stated that the congregation\nwere not at fault; they were righteous; that this great cry about the\nmurmuring of the congregation bringing upon them the wrath of\nGod was all a mistake; and that the people only wanted to have their\nrights; they wanted individual independence.\nAs a sense of the self-sacrificing patience of Moses would force\nitself upon their memories, and as his disinterested efforts in their\nbehalf while they were in the bondage of slavery would come before\nthem, their consciences would be somewhat disturbed. Some were\nnot wholly with Korah in his views of Moses and sought to speak\nin his behalf. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram must assign some reason\nbefore the people why Moses had from the first shown so great an\ninterest for the congregation of Israel. Their selfish minds, which\nhad been debased as Satan\u2019s instruments, suggested that they had at\nlast found out the object of the apparent interest of Moses. He had\ndesigned to keep them wandering in the wilderness until they all, or\nnearly all, should perish and he should come into possession of their\nproperty.\nKorah, Dathan, and Abiram, and the two hundred and fifty\nprinces who had joined them, first became jealous, then envious, and\nGreat Rebellion 327\nnext rebellious. They had talked in regard to the position of Moses\nas ruler of the people until they imagined that it was a very enviable\nposition which any of them could fill as well as he. And they gave\nthemselves up to discontent until they really deceived themselves [347]\nand thought that Moses and Aaron had placed themselves in the\nposition which they occupied in Israel. They said that Moses and\nAaron exalted themselves above the congregation of the Lord in\ntaking upon them the priesthood and the government, and that this\noffice should not be conferred on their house alone. They said that it\nwas sufficient for them if they were on a level with their brethren; for\nthey were no more holy than the people, who were equally favored\nwith God\u2019s peculiar presence and protection.\nCharacter Tested\nAs Moses listened to the words of Korah, he was filled with\nanguish and fell upon his face before the people. \u201cAnd he spake\nunto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even tomorrow the\nLord will show who are His, and who is holy; and will cause him\nto come near unto Him: even him whom He hath chosen will He\ncause to come near unto Him. This do; take you censers, Korah,\nand all his company; and put fire therein, and put incense in them\nbefore the Lord tomorrow: and it shall be that the man whom the\nLord doth choose, he shall be holy. Ye take too much upon you,\nye sons of Levi. And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye\nsons of Levi: seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of\nIsrael hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring\nyou near to Himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord,\nand to stand before the congregation to minister unto them? And He\nhath brought thee near to Him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi\nwith thee: and seek ye the priesthood also? For which cause both\nthou and all thy company are gathered together against the Lord:\nand what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?\u201d Moses told them\nthat Aaron had assumed no office of himself, that God had placed\nhim in the sacred office.\nDathan and Abiram said: \u201cIs it a small thing that thou hast\nbrought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill\nus in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince [348]\n328 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nover us? Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth\nwith milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards:\nwilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.\u201d\nThey accused Moses of being the cause of their not entering the\nPromised Land. They said that God had not dealt with them thus, and\nthat He had not said that they should die in the wilderness, and they\nwould never believe that He had said so; it was Moses who had said\nthis, not the Lord; and it was all arranged by Moses never to bring\nthem to the land of Canaan. They spoke of his leading them from a\nland that flowed with milk and honey. In their blind rebellion they\nforgot their sufferings in Egypt and the desolating plagues brought\nupon the land. And they now accuse Moses of bringing them from\na good land to kill them in the wilderness, that he might be made\nrich with their possessions. They inquire of Moses, in an insolent\nmanner, if he thought that none of all the host of Israel were wise\nenough to understand his motives and discover his imposture, or if\nhe thought they would all submit to have him lead them about like\nblind men as he pleased, sometimes toward Canaan, then back again\ntoward the Red Sea and Egypt. These words they spoke before the\ncongregation, and they utterly refused any longer to acknowledge\nthe authority of Moses and Aaron.\nMoses was greatly moved at these unjust accusations. He ap-\npealed to God before the people whether he had ever acted arbitrarily,\nand implored Him to be his judge. The people in general were dis-\naffected and influenced by the misrepresentations of Korah. \u201cAnd\nMoses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the\nLord, thou, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow: and take every man his\ncenser, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the Lord every\nman his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron,\neach of you his censer. And they took every man his censer, and put\nfire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the\ntabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.\u201d\nKorah and his company, who in their self-confidence aspired to[349]\nthe priesthood, even took the censers and stood in the door of the\ntabernacle with Moses. Korah had cherished his envy and rebellion\nuntil he was self-deceived, and he really thought that the congrega-\ntion were a very righteous people and that Moses was a tyrannical\nGreat Rebellion 329\nruler, continually dwelling upon the necessity of the congregation\u2019s\nbeing holy, when there was no need of it, for they were holy.\nThese rebellious ones had flattered the people in general to be-\nlieve that they were right and that all their troubles arose from Moses,\ntheir ruler, who was continually reminding them of their sins. The\npeople thought that if Korah could lead them and encourage them\nby dwelling upon their righteous acts instead of reminding them of\ntheir failures, they would have a very peaceful, prosperous journey,\nand he would without doubt lead them, not back and forward in the\nwilderness, but into the Promised Land. They said that it was Moses\nwho had told them that they could not go into the land, and that the\nLord had not thus said.\nThe Rebels Perish\nKorah, in his exalted self-confidence, gathered all the congre-\ngation of Israel against Moses and Aaron, \u201cunto the door of the\ntabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the Lord appeared\nunto all the congregation. And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto\nAaron, saying, Separate yourselves from among this congregation,\nthat I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their\nfaces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one\nman sin, and wilt Thou be wroth with all the congregation?\n\u201cAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the con-\ngregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah,\nDathan, and Abiram. And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and\nAbiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. And he spake unto\nthe congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these [350]\nwicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in\nall their sins. So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan,\nand Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and\nstood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and\ntheir little children. And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the\nLord hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of\nmine own mind. If these men die the common death of all men, or\nif they be visited after the visitation of all men, then the Lord hath\nnot sent me. But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open\nher mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them,\n330 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nand they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that\nthese men have provoked the Lord.\u201d As Moses ceased speaking, the\nearth opened, and their tents, and all that pertained unto them, were\nswallowed up. They went down alive into the pit, the earth closed\nover them, and they perished from among the congregation.\nAs the children of Israel heard the cry of the perishing ones,\nthey fled a great distance from them. They knew that they were\nin a measure guilty, for they had received the accusations against\nMoses and Aaron, and they were afraid that they would also perish\nwith them. But the judgment of God was not yet finished. A fire\ncame from the cloud of glory and consumed the two hundred and\nfifty men that offered incense. These were princes; that is, men\ngenerally of good judgment and of influence in the congregation,\nmen of renown. They were highly esteemed, and their judgment had\noften been sought in difficult matters. But they were affected by a\nwrong influence, and became envious, jealous, and rebellious. They\nperished not with Korah, Dathan, and Abiram because they were not\nthe first in rebellion. They were first to see the end of the leaders in\nthe rebellion, and have an opportunity to repent of their crime. But\nthey were not reconciled to the destruction of those wicked men,\nand the wrath of God came upon them and destroyed them also.\n\u201cAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Eleazar\nthe son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the[351]\nburning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed. The\ncensers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them\nbroad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before\nthe Lord, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto\nthe children of Israel.\u201d\nThe Rebellion Not Cured\nAfter this terrible exhibition of God\u2019s judgment the people re-\nturned to their tents. They were terrified, but not humbled. They\nhad been deeply influenced by the spirit of rebellion and had been\nflattered by Korah and his company to believe that they were a very\ngood people and that they had been wronged and abused by Moses.\nTheir minds were so thoroughly imbued with the spirit of those who\nhad perished that it was difficult to free themselves from their blind\nGreat Rebellion 331\nprejudice. If they should admit that Korah and his company were\nall wicked and Moses righteous, then they would be compelled to\nreceive as the word of God that which they were unwilling to believe,\nthat they should certainly all die in the wilderness. They were not\nwilling to submit to this and tried to believe that it was all an impos-\nture, that Moses had deceived them. The men who had perished had\nspoken pleasant words to them and had manifested special interest\nand love for them, and they thought Moses a designing man. They\ndecided that they could not be wrong; that, after all, those men who\nhad perished were good men, and Moses had by some means been\nthe cause of their destruction.\nSatan can lead deceived souls to great lengths. He can pervert\ntheir judgment, their sight, and their hearing. It was so in the case of\nthe Israelites. \u201cBut on the morrow all the congregation of the chil-\ndren of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying,\nYe have killed the people of the Lord.\u201d The people were disappointed\nthat the matter resulted as it did in favor of Moses and Aaron. The\nappearance of Korah and his company, all impiously exercising the\npriests\u2019 office with their censers, struck the people with admiration. [352]\nThey did not see that these men were offering a daring affront to\nthe divine Majesty. When they were destroyed, the people were\nterrified; but after a short time all came in a tumultuous manner to\nMoses and Aaron, and charged them with the blood of those who\nhad perished by the hand of God.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered\nagainst Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the taber-\nnacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the\nglory of the Lord appeared. And Moses and Aaron came before the\ntabernacle of the congregation. And the Lord spake unto Moses, say-\ning, Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume\nthem as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.\u201d Notwith-\nstanding the rebellion of Israel and their cruel conduct to Moses,\nhe still manifested for them the same interest as before. Falling\nupon his face before the Lord, he implored Him to spare the people.\nWhile thus praying for the Lord to pardon the sins of His people,\nMoses requested Aaron to make an atonement for their sin while\nhe remained before the Lord, that his prayers might ascend with\n332 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthe incense and be acceptable to God, and that all the congregation\nmight not perish in their rebellion.\n\u201cAnd Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein\nfrom off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the con-\ngregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone\nout from the Lord; the plague is begun. And Aaron took as Moses\ncommanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation, and, behold,\nthe plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and\nmade an atonement for the people. And he stood between the dead\nand the living; and the plague was stayed. Now they that died in the\nplague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that\ndied about the matter of Korah. And Aaron returned unto Moses\nunto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague\nwas stayed.\u201d\nA Lesson for Our Time[353]\nIn the case of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram we have a lesson of\nwarning lest we follow their example. \u201cNeither let us tempt Christ, as\nsome of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. Neither\nmurmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed\nof the destroyer. Now all these things happened unto them for\nensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the\nends of the world are come.\u201d\nWe have evidence in God\u2019s word of the liability of His people to\nbe greatly deceived. There are many instances where what may seem\nto be a sincere zeal for the honor of God has its origin in leaving the\nsoul unguarded for the enemy to tempt and to impress the mind with\na perverted sense of the real state of things. And we may expect just\nsuch things in these last days, for Satan is just as busy now as he was\nin the congregation of Israel. The cruelty and strength of prejudice\nare not understood. After the congregation had the evidence before\ntheir sight of the destruction of these leaders in rebellion, the power\nof suspicion and distrust which had been let into their souls was not\nremoved. They saw the ground open and the leaders of rebellion\ngo down into the bowels of the earth. This fearful exhibition surely\nought to have cured them and led them to the deepest repentance for\ntheir abuse of Moses.\nGreat Rebellion 333\nHere God gave all Israel an opportunity to see and to feel the\nsinfulness of their course, which should have led them to repentance\nand confession. He gave the deceived ones overwhelming evidence\nthat they were sinners and that His servant Moses was right. They\nhad an opportunity to pass one night in reflection upon the fearful\nvisitation of Heaven which they had witnessed. But reason was\nperverted. Korah had instigated the rebellion, and two hundred and\nfifty princes had joined him in spreading the disaffection. All the\ncongregation were, to a greater or less degree, affected with the\nprevailing jealousy, surmisings, and hatred against Moses, which\nhad brought the displeasure of God in a fearfully marked manner. [354]\nYet our gracious God shows Himself a God of justice and mercy.\nHe made a distinction between the instigators\u2014the leaders in the\nrebellion\u2014and those who had been deceived or led by them. He\npitied the ignorance and folly of those who had been deceived.\nGod spoke to Moses to bid the congregation leave the tents of\nthe men whom they had chosen in the place of Moses. The very men\nwhose destruction they premeditated were the instruments in the\nhands of God of saving their lives upon that occasion. Said Moses:\n\u201cGet you up from about the tabernacle of Korah.\u201d They also were\nin alarming danger of being destroyed in their sins by the wrath of\nGod, for they were sharers in the crimes of the men to whom they\nhad given their sympathy and with whom they had associated.\nIf while Moses was trying the test before the congregation of\nIsrael, those who had started the rebellion had repented and sought\nthe forgiveness of God and of His injured servant, the vengeance of\nGod would even then have been stayed. But there in their tents boldly\nstood Korah, the instigator of the rebellion, and his sympathizers,\nas if in defiance of God\u2019s wrath, as though God had never wrought\nthrough His servant Moses. And much less did these rebellious ones\nact as though they had been so recently honored of God by being\nbrought with Moses almost directly into His presence, and beholding\nHis unsurpassed glory. These men saw Moses come down from the\nmount after he had received the second tables of stone and while\nhis face was so resplendent with the glory of God that the people\nwould not approach him, but fled from him. He called to them, but\nthey seemed terrified. He presented the tables of stone and said: I\npleaded in your behalf and have turned the wrath of God from you.\n334 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nI urged that, if God must forsake and destroy His congregation, my\nname might also be blotted from His book. Lo, He has answered\nme, and these tables of stone that I hold in my hand are the pledge\ngiven me of His reconciliation with His people.\nThe people perceive that it is the voice of Moses; that, although[355]\nhe is transformed and glorified, he is Moses yet. They tell him that\nthey cannot look into his face, for the radiant light in his countenance\nis exceedingly painful to them. His face is like the sun; they cannot\nlook upon it. When Moses finds out the difficulty, he covers his face\nwith a veil. He does not plead that the light and glory upon his face\nis the reflection of God\u2019s glory that He placed upon him, and that\nthe people must bear it; but he covers his glory. The sinfulness of\nthe people make it painful to behold his glorified face. So will it\nbe when the saints of God are glorified just previous to the second\nappearing of our Lord. The wicked will retire and shrink away from\nthe sight, for the glory in the countenances of the saints will pain\nthem. But all this glory upon Moses, all this divine stamp seen upon\nGod\u2019s humble servant, is forgotten.\nSlighted Mercy\nThe Hebrews had an opportunity to reflect upon the scene that\nthey had witnessed in the visitation of God\u2019s wrath upon the most\nprominent ones in this great rebellion. The goodness and mercy of\nGod were displayed in not completely exterminating this ungrateful\npeople when His wrath was kindled against the most responsible\nones. He gave the congregation who had permitted themselves to be\ndeceived, space for repentance. The fact that the Lord, their invisible\nLeader, showed so much long-suffering and mercy in this instance\nis distinctly recorded as evidence of His willingness to forgive the\nmost grievous offenders when they have a sense of their sin and\nreturn unto Him with repentance and humiliation. The congregation\nhad been arrested in their presumptuous course by the display of the\nLord\u2019s vengeance; but they were not convinced that they were great\nsinners against Him, deserving His wrath for their rebellious course.\nIt is hardly possible for men to offer a greater insult to God than\nto despise and reject the instrumentalities that He has appointed to\nlead them. They had not only done this, but had purposed to put both\nGreat Rebellion 335\nMoses and Aaron to death. These men fled from the tents of Korah, [356]\nDathan, and Abiram through fear of destruction; but their rebellion\nwas not cured. They were not in grief and despair because of their\nguilt. They felt not the effect of an awakened, convicted conscience\nbecause they had abused their most precious privileges and sinned\nagainst light and knowledge. We may here learn precious lessons of\nthe long-suffering of Jesus, the Angel who went before the Hebrews\nin the wilderness.\nTheir invisible Leader would save them from a disgraceful de-\nstruction. Forgiveness lingers for them. It is possible for them to\nfind pardon if they will even now repent. The vengeance of God has\nnow come near to them and appealed to them to repent. A special,\nirresistible interference from heaven has arrested their presumptu-\nous rebellion. If they now respond to the interposition of God\u2019s\nprovidence they may be saved. But the repentance and humiliation\nof the congregation must be proportionate to their transgression.\nThe revelation of the signal power of God has placed them beyond\nuncertainty. They may have a knowledge of the true position and\nholy calling of Moses and Aaron if they will accept it. But their\nneglect to regard the evidences that God had given them was fatal.\nThey did not realize the importance of immediate action on their\npart to seek pardon of God for their grievous sins.\nThat night of probation to the Hebrews was not passed by them\nin confessing and repenting of their sins, but in devising some way\nto resist the evidences which showed them to be the greatest of\nsinners. They still cherished their jealous hatred of the men of God\u2019s\nappointment and strengthened themselves in their mad course of\nresisting the authority of Moses and Aaron. Satan was at hand to\npervert the judgment and lead them blindfolded to destruction. Their\nminds had been most thoroughly poisoned with disaffection, and\nthey had the matter fixed beyond a question in their minds that Moses\nand Aaron were wicked men, and that they were responsible for the\ndeath of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, who they thought would have [357]\nbeen the saviors of the Hebrews by bringing in a better order of\nthings, where praise would take the place of reproof, and peace the\nplace of anxiety and conflict.\nThe day before, all Israel had fled in alarm at the cry of the\ndoomed sinners who went down into the pit; for they said: \u201cLest the\n336 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nearth swallow us up also.\u201d \u201cBut on the morrow all the congregation\nof the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron,\nsaying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord.\u201d In their indignation\nthey were prepared to lay violent hands upon the men of God\u2019s\nappointment, who they believed had done a great wrong in killing\nthose who were good and holy.\nBut the Lord\u2019s presence is manifested in His glory over the taber-\nnacle, and rebellious Israel are arrested in their mad, presumptuous\ncourse. The voice of the Lord from His terrible glory now speaks\nto Moses and Aaron in the same words which they were the day\nbefore commanded to address to the congregation of Israel: \u201cGet\nyou up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as\nin a moment.\u201d\nHere we find a striking exhibition of the blindness that will\ncompass human minds that turn from light and evidence. Here we\nsee the strength of settled rebellion, and how difficult it is to be\nsubdued. Surely the Hebrews had had the most convincing evidence\nin the destruction of the men who had deceived them; but they still\nstood forth boldly and defiantly, and accused Moses and Aaron of\nkilling good and holy men. \u201cFor rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft,\nand stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.\u201d\nMoses did not feel the guilt of sin and did not hasten away at\nthe word of the Lord and leave the congregation to perish, as the\nHebrews had fled from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram\nthe day before. Moses lingered; for he could not consent to give\nup all that vast multitude to perish, although he knew that they\ndeserved the vengeance of God for their persistent rebellion. He\nprostrated himself before God because the people felt no necessity[358]\nfor humiliation; he mediated for them because they felt no need of\ninterceding in their own behalf.\nMoses here typifies Christ. At this critical time Moses mani-\nfested the True Shepherd\u2019s interest for the flock of His care. He\npleaded that the wrath of an offended God might not utterly destroy\nthe people of His choice. And by his intercession he held back\nthe arm of vengeance, that a full end was not made of disobedient,\nrebellious Israel. He directed Aaron what course to pursue in that\nterrible crisis when the wrath of God had gone forth and the plague\nhad begun. Aaron stood with his censer, waving it before the Lord,\nGreat Rebellion 337\nwhile the intercessions of Moses ascended with the smoke of the\nincense. Moses dared not cease his entreaties. He took hold of the\nstrength of the Angel, as did Jacob in his wrestling, and like Jacob\nhe prevailed. Aaron was standing between the living and the dead\nwhen the gracious answer came: I have heard thy prayer, I will not\nconsume utterly. The very men whom the congregation despised\nand would have put to death were the ones to plead in their behalf\nthat the avenging sword of God might be sheathed and sinful Israel\nspared.\nDespisers of Reproof\nThe apostle Paul plainly states that the experience of the Israelites\nin their travels has been recorded for the benefit of those living in\nthis age of the world, those upon whom the ends of the world are\ncome. We do not consider that our dangers are any less than those of\nthe Hebrews, but greater. There will be temptations to jealousies and\nmurmurings, and there will be outspoken rebellion, as are recorded\nof ancient Israel. There will ever be a spirit to rise up against the\nreproof of sins and wrongs. But shall the voice of reproof be hushed\nbecause of this? If so, we shall be in no better situation than are the\nvarious denominations in our land who are afraid to touch the errors\nand prevailing sins of the people.\nThose whom God has set apart as ministers of righteousness\nhave solemn responsibilities laid upon them to reprove the sins of [359]\nthe people. Paul commanded Titus: \u201cThese things speak, and exhort,\nand rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.\u201d There are\never those who will despise the one who dares to reprove sin; but\nthere are times when reproof must be given. Paul directs Titus to\nrebuke a certain class sharply, that they may be sound in the faith.\nMen and women who, with their different organizations, are brought\ntogether in church capacity have peculiarities and faults. As these\nare developed, they will require reproof. If those who are placed in\nimportant positions never reproved, never rebuked, there would soon\nbe a demoralized condition of things that would greatly dishonor\nGod. But how shall the reproof be given? Let the apostle answer:\n\u201cWith all long-suffering and doctrine.\u201d Principle should be brought\n338 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nto bear upon the one who needs reproof, but never should the wrongs\nof God\u2019s people be passed by indifferently.\nThere will be men and women who despise reproof and whose\nfeelings will ever rise up against it. It is not pleasant to be told of our\nwrongs. In almost every case where reproof is necessary, there will\nbe some who entirely overlook the fact that the Spirit of the Lord\nhas been grieved and His cause reproached. These will pity those\nwho deserved reproof, because personal feelings have been hurt. All\nthis unsanctified sympathy places the sympathizers where they are\nsharers in the guilt of the one reproved. In nine cases out of ten if\nthe one reproved had been left under a sense of his wrongs, he might\nhave been helped to see them and thereby have been reformed. But\nmeddlesome, unsanctified sympathizers place altogether a wrong\nconstruction upon the motives of the reprover and the nature of the\nreproof given, and by sympathizing with the one reproved lead him\nto feel that he has been really abused; and his feelings rise up in\nrebellion against the one who has only done his duty. Those who\nfaithfully discharge their unpleasant duties under a sense of their\naccountability to God will receive His blessing. God requires His\nservants to be always in earnest to do His will. In the apostle\u2019s\ncharge to Timothy he exhorts him to \u201cpreach the word; be instant in[360]\nseason, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering\nand doctrine.\u201d\nThe Hebrews were not willing to submit to the directions and re-\nstrictions of the Lord. They simply wanted their own way, to follow\nthe leadings of their own mind, and be controlled by their own judg-\nment. Could they have been left free to do this, no complaints would\nhave been made of Moses; but they were restless under restraint.\nGod would have His people disciplined and brought into har-\nmony of action, that they may see eye to eye and be of the same mind\nand of the same judgment. In order to bring about this state of things,\nthere is much to be done. The carnal heart must be subdued and\ntransformed. God designs that there shall ever be a living testimony\nin the church. It will be necessary to reprove and exhort, and some\nwill need to be rebuked sharply, as the case demands. We hear the\nplea: \u201cOh, I am so sensitive, I cannot bear the least reflection!\u201d If\nthese persons would state the case correctly, they would say: \u201cI am\nso self-willed, so self-sufficient, so proud-spirited, that I will not\nGreat Rebellion 339\nbe dictated to; I will not be reproved. I claim the right of individ-\nual judgment; I have a right to believe and talk as I please.\u201d The\nLord would not have us yield up our individuality. But what man\nis a proper judge of how far this matter of individual independence\nshould be carried?\nPeter exhorts his brethren: \u201cLikewise, ye younger, submit your-\nselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and\nbe clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth\ngrace to the humble.\u201d The apostle Paul also exhorts his Philippian\nbrethren to unity and humility: \u201cIf there be therefore any consolation\nin Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if\nany bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like-minded,\nhaving the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing\nbe done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let\neach esteem other better than themselves. Look not every man on [361]\nhis own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this\nmind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.\u201d Again Paul exhorts\nhis brethren: \u201cLet love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which\nis evil; cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to\nanother with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another.\u201d In\nwriting to the Ephesians he says: \u201cSubmitting yourselves one to\nanother in the fear of God.\u201d\nThe history of the Israelites presents before us the great danger\nof deception. Many do not have a sense of the sinfulness of their\nown natures nor of the grace of forgiveness. They are in nature\u2019s\ndarkness, subject to temptations and to great deception. They are\nfar from God; yet they take great satisfaction in their lives, when\ntheir conduct is abhorred of God. This class will ever be at war with\nthe leadings of the Spirit of God, especially with reproof. They do\nnot wish to be disturbed. Occasionally they have selfish fears and\ngood purposes, and sometimes anxious thoughts and convictions;\nbut they have not a depth of experience, because they are not riveted\nto the eternal Rock. This class never see the necessity of the plain\ntestimony. Sin does not appear so exceedingly sinful to them for the\nvery reason that they are not walking in the light as Christ is in the\nlight.\nThere is still another class who have had great light and special\nconviction, and a genuine experience in the workings of the Spirit\n340 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nof God; but the manifold temptations of Satan have overcome them.\nThey do not appreciate the light that God has given them. They do\nnot heed the warnings and reproofs from the Spirit of God. They are\nunder condemnation. These will ever be at variance with the straight\ntestimony because it condemns them.\nGod designs that His people shall be a unit, that they shall see\neye to eye and be of the same mind and of the same judgment. This\ncannot be accomplished without a clear, pointed, living testimony\nin the church. The prayer of Christ was that His disciples might be\none as He was one with His Father. \u201cNeither pray I for these alone,\nbut for them also which shall believe on Me through their word; that[362]\nthey all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that\nthey also may be one in Us: that the world may believe that Thou\nhast sent Me. And the glory which Thou gavest Me I have given\nthem; that they may be one, even as We are one: I in them, and Thou\nin Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may\nknow that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast\nloved Me.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 32\u2014Appeal to the Young\nDear Youth,\nFrom time to time the Lord has given me testimonies of warning\nfor you. He has given you encouragement if you would yield your\nhearts\u2019 best and holiest affections to Him. As these warnings revive\ndistinctly before me, I feel a sense of your danger that I know you\ndo not feel. The school located in Battle Creek brings together many\nyoung people of different mental organizations. If these youth are\nnot consecrated to God and obedient to His will, and do not walk\nhumbly in the way of His commandments, the location of a school\nin Battle Creek will prove a means of great discouragement to the\nchurch. This school may be made a blessing or a curse. I entreat\nyou who have named the name of Christ to depart from all iniquity\nand develop characters that God can approve.\nI inquire: Do you believe that the testimonies of reproof which\nhave been given you are of God? If you really believe that the voice\nof God has spoken to you, pointing out your dangers, do you heed\nthe counsels given? Do you keep these testimonies of warning fresh\nin your minds by reading them often with prayerful hearts? The\nLord has spoken to you, children and youth, again and again; but\nyou have been slow to heed the warnings given. If you have not\nrebelliously braced your hearts against the views that God has given\nof your characters and your dangers, and against the course marked [363]\nout for you to pursue, some of you have been inattentive in regard to\nthe things required of you that you might gain spiritual strength and\nbe a blessing in the school, in the church, and to all with whom you\nassociate.\nYoung men and women, you are accountable to God for the light\nthat He has given you. This light and these warnings, if not heeded,\nwill rise up in the judgment against you. Your dangers have been\nplainly stated; you have been cautioned and guarded on every side,\nhedged in with warnings. In the house of God you have listened to\nthe most solemn, heart-searching truths presented by the servants of\n341\n342 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nGod in demonstration of the Spirit. What weight do these solemn\nappeals have upon your hearts? What influence do they have upon\nyour characters? You will be held responsible for every one of these\nappeals and warnings. They will rise up in the judgment to condemn\nthose who pursue a life of vanity, levity, and pride.\nDear young friends, that which you sow, you will also reap. Now\nis the sowing time for you. What will the harvest be? What are\nyou sowing? Every word you utter, every act you perform, is a seed\nwhich will bear good or evil fruit and will result in joy or sorrow\nto the sower. As is the seed sown, so will be the crop. God has\ngiven you great light and many privileges. After this light has been\ngiven, after your dangers have been plainly presented before you,\nthe responsibility becomes yours. The manner in which you treat\nthe light that God gives you will turn the scale for happiness or woe.\nYou are shaping your destinies for yourselves.\nYou all have an influence for good or for evil on the minds and\ncharacters of others. And just the influence which you exert is\nwritten in the book of records in heaven. An angel is attending you\nand taking record of your words and actions. When you rise in the\nmorning, do you feel your helplessness and your need of strength\nfrom God? and do you humbly, heartily make known your wants\nto your heavenly Father? If so, angels mark your prayers, and if\nthese prayers have not gone forth out of feigned lips, when you are\nin danger of unconsciously doing wrong and exerting an influence[364]\nwhich will lead others to do wrong, your guardian angel will be by\nyour side, prompting you to a better course, choosing your words\nfor you, and influencing your actions.\nIf you feel in no danger, and if you offer no prayer for help and\nstrength to resist temptations, you will be sure to go astray; your\nneglect of duty will be marked in the book of God in heaven, and\nyou will be found wanting in the trying day. There are some around\nyou who have been religiously instructed, and some who have been\nindulged, petted, flattered, and praised until they have been literally\nspoiled for practical life. I am speaking in regard to persons that I\nknow. Their characters are so warped by indulgence, flattery, and\nindolence that they are useless for this life. And if useless so far as\nthis life is concerned, what may we hope for that life where all is\npurity and holiness, and where all have harmonious characters? I\nAppeal to the Young 343\nhave prayed for these persons; I have addressed them personally. I\ncould see the influence that they would exert over other minds in\nleading them to vanity, love of dress, and carelessness in regard to\ntheir eternal interests. The only hope for this class is for them to\ntake heed to their ways, humble their proud, vain hearts before God,\nmake confession of their sins, and be converted.\nVanity in dress as well as the love of amusement is a great\ntemptation for the youth. God has sacred claims upon us all. He\nclaims the whole heart, the whole soul, the whole affections. The\nanswer which is sometimes made to this statement is: \u201cOh, I do not\nprofess to be a Christian!\u201d What if you do not? Has not God the\nsame claims upon you that He has upon the one who professes to be\nHis child? Because you are bold in your careless disregard of sacred\nthings, is your sin of neglect and rebellion passed over by the Lord?\nEvery day that you disregard the claims of God, every opportunity\nof offered mercy that you slight, is charged to your account and\nwill swell the list of sins against you in the day when the accounts\nof every soul will be investigated. I address you, young men and\nwomen, professors or nonprofessors: God calls for your affections, [365]\nfor your cheerful obedience and devotion to Him. You now have a\nshort time of probation, and you may improve this opportunity to\nmake an unconditional surrender to God.\nObedience and submission to God\u2019s requirements are the con-\nditions given by the inspired apostle by which we become children\nof God, members of the royal family. Every child and youth, every\nman and woman, has Jesus rescued by His own blood from the abyss\nof ruin to which Satan was compelling them to go. Because sinners\nwill not accept of the salvation freely offered them, are they released\nfrom their obligations? Their choosing to remain in sin and bold\ntransgression does not lessen their guilt. Jesus paid a price for them,\nand they belong to Him. They are His property; and if they will not\nyield obedience to Him who has given His life for them, but devote\ntheir time and strength and talents to the service of Satan, they are\nearning their wages, which is death. Immortal glory and eternal life\nis the reward that our Redeemer offers to those who will be obedi-\nent to Him. He has made it possible for them to perfect Christian\ncharacter through His name and to overcome on their own account\nas He overcame in their behalf. He has given them an example in\n344 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nHis own life, showing them how they may overcome. \u201cThe wages\nof sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ\nour Lord.\u201d\nThe claims of God are equally binding upon all. Those who\nchoose to neglect the great salvation offered to them freely, who\nchoose to serve themselves and remain enemies of God, enemies\nof the self-sacrificing Redeemer, are earning their wages. They are\nsowing to the flesh and will of the flesh reap corruption.\nThose who have put on Christ by baptism, by this act showing\ntheir separation from the world and that they have covenanted to\nwalk in newness of life, should not set up idols in their hearts. Those\nwho have once rejoiced in the evidence of sins forgiven, who have\ntasted a Saviour\u2019s love and who then persist in uniting with the\nfoes of Christ, rejecting the perfect righteousness that Jesus offers[366]\nthem and choosing the ways that He has condemned, will be more\nseverely judged than the heathen who have never had the light and\nhave never known God or His law. Those who refuse to follow the\nlight which God has given them, choosing the amusements, vanities,\nand follies of the world, and refusing to conform their conduct to\nthe just and holy requirements of God\u2019s law, are guilty of the most\naggravating sins in the sight of God. Their guilt and their wages will\nbe proportionate to the light and privileges which they have had.\nWe see the world absorbed in their own amusements. The first\nand highest thoughts of the larger portion, especially of women, are\nof display. Love of dress and pleasure is wrecking the happiness\nof thousands. And some of those who profess to love and keep the\ncommandments of God ape this class as near as they possibly can\nand retain the Christian name. Some of the young are so eager for\ndisplay that they are even willing to give up the Christian name if\nthey can only follow out their inclination for vanity of dress and love\nof pleasure. Self-denial in dress is a part of our Christian duty. To\ndress plainly, abstaining from display of jewelry and ornaments of\nevery kind, is in keeping with our faith. Are we of the number who\nsee the folly of worldlings in indulging in extravagance of dress as\nwell as in love of amusements? If so, we should be of that class\nwho shun everything that gives sanction to this spirit which takes\npossession of the minds and hearts of those who live for this world\nonly and who have no thought or care for the next.\nAppeal to the Young 345\nChristian youth, I have seen in some of you a love for dress\nand display which has pained me. In some who have been well\ninstructed, who have had religious privileges from their babyhood,\nand who have put on Christ by baptism, thus professing to be dead\nto the world, I have seen a vanity in dress and a levity in conduct\nthat have grieved the dear Saviour and have been a reproach to the\ncause of God. I have marked with pain your religious declension\nand your disposition to trim and ornament your apparel. Some have\nbeen so unfortunate as to come into possession of gold chains or [367]\npins, or both, and have shown bad taste in exhibiting them, making\nthem conspicuous to attract attention. I can but associate these\ncharacters with the vain peacock, that displays his gorgeous feathers\nfor admiration. It is all this poor bird has to attract attention, for his\nvoice and form are anything but attractive.\nThe young may endeavor to excel in seeking for the ornament\nof a meek and quiet spirit, a jewel of inestimable value that may be\nworn with heavenly grace. This adorning will possess attractions\nfor many in this world, and will be esteemed of great price by the\nheavenly angels, and above all by our heavenly Father, and will fit\nthe wearers to be welcome guests in the heavenly courts.\nThe youth have faculties that, with proper cultivation, would\nqualify them for almost any position of trust. If they had made it\ntheir object in obtaining an education to so exercise and develop\nthe powers that God has given them that they might be useful and\nprove a blessing to others, their minds would not be dwarfed to an\ninferior standard. They would show depth of thought and firmness\nof principle, and would command influence and respect. They might\nhave an elevating influence upon others, which would lead souls\nto see and acknowledge the power of an intelligent Christian life.\nThose who have greater care to ornament their persons for display\nthan to educate the mind and exercise their powers for the greatest\nusefulness, that they may glorify God, do not realize their account-\nability to God. They will be inclined to be superficial in all they\nundertake and will narrow their usefulness and dwarf their intellect.\nI feel deeply pained at heart for the fathers and mothers of these\nyouth, as well as for the children. There has been a lack in the\ntraining of these children, which leaves a heavy responsibility some-\nwhere. Parents who have petted and indulged their children instead\n346 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nof from principle judiciously restraining them, can see the characters\nthey have formed. As the training has been, so the character inclines.\nFaithful Abraham[368]\nMy mind goes back to faithful Abraham, who, in obedience\nto the divine command given him in a night vision at Beersheba,\npursues his journey with Isaac by his side. He sees before him the\nmountain which God had told him He would signalize as the one\nupon which he was to sacrifice. He removes the wood from the\nshoulder of his servant and lays it upon Isaac, the one to be offered.\nHe girds up his soul with firmness and agonizing sternness, ready\nfor the work which God requires him to do. With a breaking heart\nand unnerved hand, he takes the fire, while Isaac inquires: Father,\nhere is the fire and the wood; but where is the offering? But, oh,\nAbraham cannot tell him now! Father and son build the altar, and\nthe terrible moment comes for Abraham to make known to Isaac that\nwhich has agonized his soul all that long journey, that Isaac himself\nis the victim. Isaac is not a lad; he is a full-grown young man. He\ncould have refused to submit to his father\u2019s design had he chosen to\ndo so. He does not accuse his father of insanity, nor does he even\nseek to change his purpose. He submits. He believes in the love of\nhis father and that he would not make this terrible sacrifice of his\nonly son if God had not bidden him do so. Isaac is bound by the\ntrembling, loving hands of his pitying father because God has said it.\nThe son submits to the sacrifice because he believes in the integrity\nof his father. But when everything is ready, when the faith of the\nfather and the submission of the son are fully tested, the angel of\nGod stays the uplifted hand of Abraham that is about to slay his son\nand tells him that it is enough. \u201cNow I know that thou fearest God,\nseeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from Me.\u201d\nThis act of faith in Abraham is recorded for our benefit. It\nteaches us the great lesson of confidence in the requirements of\nGod, however close and cutting they may be; and it teaches children\nperfect submission to their parents and to God. By Abraham\u2019s\nobedience we are taught that nothing is too precious for us to give\nto God.\nIsaac was a figure of the Son of God, who was offered a sacrifice[369]\nAppeal to the Young 347\nfor the sins of the world. God would impress upon Abraham the\ngospel of salvation to man. In order to do this, and make the truth\na reality to him as well as to test his faith, He required him to\nslay his darling Isaac. All the sorrow and agony that Abraham\nendured through that dark and fearful trial were for the purpose of\ndeeply impressing upon his understanding the plan of redemption\nfor fallen man. He was made to understand in his own experience\nhow unutterable was the self-denial of the infinite God in giving\nHis own Son to die to rescue man from utter ruin. To Abraham no\nmental torture could be equal to that which he endured in obeying\nthe divine command to sacrifice his son.\nGod gave His Son to a life of humiliation, self-denial, poverty,\ntoil, reproach, and to the agonizing death of crucifixion. But there\nwas no angel to bear the joyful message: \u201cIt is enough; You need\nnot die, My well-beloved Son.\u201d Legions of angels were sorrowfully\nwaiting, hoping that, as in the case of Isaac, God would at the last\nmoment prevent His shameful death. But angels were not permitted\nto bear any such message to God\u2019s dear Son. The humiliation in the\njudgment hall and on the way to Calvary went on. He was mocked,\nderided, and spit upon. He endured the jeers, taunts, and revilings\nof those who hated Him, until upon the cross He bowed His head\nand died.\nCould God give us any greater proof of His love than in thus\ngiving His Son to pass through this scene of suffering? And as the\ngift of God to man was a free gift, His love infinite, so His claims\nupon our confidence, our obedience, our whole heart, and the wealth\nof our affections are correspondingly infinite. He requires all that\nit is possible for man to give. The submission on our part must be\nproportionate to the gift of God; it must be complete and wanting in\nnothing. We are all debtors to God. He has claims upon us that we\ncannot meet without giving ourselves a full and willing sacrifice. He\nclaims prompt and willing obedience, and nothing short of this will\nHe accept. We have opportunity now to secure the love and favor [370]\nof God. This year may be the last year in the lives of some who\nread this. Are there any among the youth who read this appeal who\nwould choose the pleasures of the world before that peace which\nChrist gives the earnest seeker and the cheerful doer of His will?\n348 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nGod is weighing our characters, our conduct, and our motives\nin the balances of the sanctuary. It will be a fearful thing to be pro-\nnounced wanting in love and obedience by our Redeemer, who died\nupon the cross to draw our hearts unto Him. God has bestowed upon\nus great and precious gifts. He has given us light and a knowledge of\nHis will, so that we need not err or walk in darkness. To be weighed\nin the balance and found wanting in the day of final settlement and\nrewards will be a fearful thing, a terrible mistake which can never\nbe corrected. Young friends, shall the book of God be searched in\nvain for your names?\nGod has appointed you a work to do for Him which will make\nyou colaborers with Him. All around you there are souls to save.\nThere are those whom you can encourage and bless by your earnest\nefforts. You may turn souls from sin to righteousness. When you\nhave a sense of your accountability to God you will feel the need\nof faithfulness in prayer and faithfulness in watching against the\ntemptations of Satan. You will, if you are indeed Christians, feel\nmore like mourning over the moral darkness in the world than in-\ndulging in levity and pride of dress. You will be among those who\nare sighing and crying for the abominations that are done in the land.\nYou will resist the temptations of Satan to indulge in vanity and in\ntrimmings and ornaments for display. The mind is narrowed and the\nintellect dwarfed that can be gratified with these frivolous things to\nthe neglect of high responsibilities.\nThe youth in our day may be workers with Christ if they will;\nand in working, their faith will strengthen and their knowledge of\nthe divine will will increase. Every true purpose and every act of\nright doing will be recorded in the book of life. I wish I could\narouse the youth to see and feel the sinfulness of living for their own[371]\ngratification and dwarfing their intellects to the cheap, vain things of\nthis life. If they would elevate their thoughts and words above the\nfrivolous attractions of this world and make it their aim to glorify\nGod, His peace, which passeth all understanding, would be theirs.\nHumiliation of Christ\nDid not our Exemplar tread a hard, self-denying, self-sacrificing,\nhumble path on our account in order to save us? He encountered\nAppeal to the Young 349\ndifficulties, experienced disappointments, and suffered reproach and\naffliction in His work of saving us. And shall we refuse to follow\nwhere the King of glory has led the way? Shall we complain of\nhardship and trial in the work of overcoming on our own account,\nwhen we remember the sufferings of our Redeemer in the wilderness\nof temptation, in the Garden of Gethsemane, and on Calvary? All\nthese were endured to show us the way and to bring us the divine\nhelp that we must have or perish. If the youth would win eternal\nlife, they need not expect that they can follow their own inclinations.\nThe prize will cost them something, yes, everything. They can now\nhave Jesus or the world. How many dear youth will suffer privation,\nweariness, toil, and anxiety in order to serve themselves and gain an\nobject in this life! They do not think of complaining of the hardships\nand difficulties they encounter in order to serve their own interest.\nWhy, then, should they shrink from conflict, self-denial, or any\nsacrifice in order to obtain eternal life?\nChrist came from the courts of glory to this sin-polluted world\nand humbled Himself to humanity. He identified Himself with our\nweaknesses and was tempted in all points like as we are. Christ\nperfected a righteous character here upon the earth, not on His own\naccount, for His character was pure and spotless, but for fallen man.\nHis character He offers to man if he will accept it. The sinner,\nthrough repentance of his sins, faith in Christ, and obedience to the\nperfect law of God, has the righteousness of Christ imputed to him;\nit becomes his righteousness, and his name is recorded in the Lamb\u2019s [372]\nbook of life. He becomes a child of God, a member of the royal\nfamily.\nJesus paid an infinite price to redeem the world, and the race\nwas given into His hands; they became His property. He sacrificed\nHis honor, His riches, and His glorious home in the royal courts and\nbecame the son of Joseph and Mary. Joseph was one of the humblest\nof day laborers. Jesus also worked; he lived a life of hardship\nand toil. When His ministry commenced, after His baptism, He\nendured an agonizing fast of nearly six weeks. It was not merely the\ngnawing pangs of hunger which made His sufferings inexpressibly\nsevere, but it was the guilt of the sins of the world which pressed\nso heavily upon Him. He who knew no sin was made sin for us.\nWith this terrible weight of guilt upon Him because of our sins\n350 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nHe withstood the fearful test upon appetite, and upon love of the\nworld and of honor, and pride of display which leads to presumption.\nChrist endured these three great leading temptations and overcame\nin behalf of man, working out for him a righteous character, because\nHe knew man could not do this of himself. He knew that upon\nthese three points Satan was to assail the race. He had overcome\nAdam, and he designed to carry forward his work till he completed\nthe ruin of man. Christ entered the field in man\u2019s behalf to conquer\nSatan for him because He saw that man could not overcome on his\nown account. Christ prepared the way for the ransom of man by\nHis own life of suffering, self-denial, and self-sacrifice, and by His\nhumiliation and final death. He brought help to man that he might,\nby following Christ\u2019s example, overcome on his own account, as\nChrist has overcome for him.\n\u201cWhat? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy\nGhost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your\nown? for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in\nyour body, and in your spirit, which are God\u2019s.\u201d \u201cKnow ye not that\nye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in\nyou? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy;[373]\nfor the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\u201d \u201cBe ye not\nunequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath\nrighteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath\nlight with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial? or\nwhat part hath he that believeth with an infidel? and what agreement\nhath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living\nGod; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and\nI will be their God, and they shall be My people. Wherefore come\nout from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch\nnot the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father\nunto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord\nAlmighty.\u201d\nHow graciously and tenderly our heavenly Father deals with His\nchildren! He preserves them from a thousand dangers to them unseen\nand guards them from the subtle arts of Satan, lest they should be\ndestroyed. Because the protecting care of God through His angels\nis not seen by our dull vision, we do not try to contemplate and\nappreciate the ever-watchful interest that our kind and benevolent\nAppeal to the Young 351\nCreator has in the work of His hands; and we are not grateful for the\nmultitude of mercies that He daily bestows upon us.\nThe young are ignorant of the many dangers to which they are\ndaily exposed. They can never fully know them all; but if they are\nwatchful and prayerful, God will keep their consciences sensitive\nand their perceptions clear, that they may discern the workings of\nthe enemy and be fortified against his attacks. But many of the\nyoung have so long followed their own inclinations that duty is a\nmeaningless word to them. They do not realize the high and holy\nduties which they may have to do for the benefit of others and for\nthe glory of God; and they utterly neglect to perform them.\nIf the youth could only awake to deeply feel their need of strength\nfrom God to resist the temptations of Satan, precious victories would\nbe theirs, and they would obtain a valuable experience in the Chris-\ntian warfare. How few of the young think of the exhortation of the [374]\ninspired apostle Peter: \u201cBe sober, be vigilant; because your adver-\nsary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he\nmay devour: whom resist steadfast in the faith.\u201d In the vision given\nto John he saw the power of Satan over men and exclaimed: \u201cWoe\nto the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come\ndown unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath\nbut a short time.\u201d\nThe only safety for the young is in unceasing watchfulness and\nhumble prayer. They need not flatter themselves that they can be\nChristians without these. Satan conceals his temptations and his\ndevices under a cover of light, as when he approached Christ in the\nwilderness. He was then in appearance as one of the heavenly angels.\nThe adversary of our souls will approach us as a heavenly guest, and\nthe apostle recommends sobriety and vigilance as our only safety.\nThe young who indulge in carelessness and levity, and who neglect\nChristian duties, are continually falling under the temptations of the\nenemy, instead of overcoming as Christ overcame.\nThe service of Christ is not drudgery to the fully consecrated soul.\nObedience to our Saviour does not detract from our happiness and\ntrue pleasure in this life, but it has a refining, elevating power upon\nour characters. The daily study of the precious words of life found\nin the Bible strengthens the intellect and furnishes a knowledge of\nthe grand and glorious works of God in nature. Through the study\n352 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nof the Scriptures we obtain a correct knowledge of how to live so\nas to enjoy the greatest amount of unalloyed happiness. The Bible\nstudent is also furnished with Scripture arguments so that he can\nmeet the doubts of unbelievers and remove them by the clear light of\ntruth. Those who have searched the Scriptures may ever be fortified\nagainst the temptations of Satan; they may be thoroughly furnished\nto all good works and prepared to give to every man that asketh them\na reason of the hope that is in them.\nThe impression is too frequently left upon minds that religion is\ndegrading and that it is a condescension for sinners to accept of the[375]\nBible standard as their rule of life. They think that its requirements\nare unrefined, and that, in accepting it, they must relinquish all their\ntastes for, and enjoyment of, that which is beautiful, and instead must\naccept of humiliation and degradation. Satan never fastens a greater\ndeception upon minds than this. The pure religion of Jesus requires\nof its followers the simplicity of natural beauty and the polish of\nnatural refinement and elevated purity, rather than the artificial and\nfalse.\nWhile pure religion is looked upon as exacting in its demands\nand, with the young especially, is unfavorably contrasted with the\nfalse glitter and tinsel of the world, the Bible requirements are re-\ngarded as humiliating, self-denying tests, which take from them\nall the enjoyment of life. But the religion of the Bible ever has a\ntendency to elevate and refine. And had the professed followers of\nChrist carried out the principles of pure religion in their lives, the\nreligion of Christ would be acceptable to more refined minds. The\nreligion of the Bible has nothing in it which would jar upon the finest\nfeelings. It is, in all its precepts and requirements, as pure as the\ncharacter of God and as elevated as His throne.\nThe Redeemer of the world has warned us against the pride of\nlife, but not against its grace and natural beauty. He pointed to all\nthe glowing beauty of the flowers of the field and to the lily reposing\nin its spotless purity upon the bosom of the lake and said: \u201cConsider\nthe lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they\nspin: and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was\nnot arrayed like one of these.\u201d Here He shows that notwithstanding\npersons may have great care, and may toil with weariness to make\nthemselves objects of admiration by their outward decorations, all\nAppeal to the Young 353\ntheir artificial adornments, which they value so highly, will not bear\ncomparison with the simple flowers of the field for natural loveliness.\nEven these simple flowers, with God\u2019s adornment, would outvie in\nloveliness the gorgeous apparel of Solomon. \u201cEven Solomon in all\nhis glory was not arrayed like one of these.\u201d\nHere is an important lesson for every follower of Christ. The [376]\nRedeemer of the world speaks to the youth. Will you listen to His\nwords of heavenly instruction? He presents before you themes for\nthought that will ennoble, elevate, refine, and purify, but which will\nnever degrade or dwarf the intellect. His voice is speaking to you:\n\u201cYe are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be\nhid.\u201d \u201cLet your light so shine before men, that they may see your\ngood works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d If the\nlight of God be in you, it will shine forth to others. It can never be\nconcealed.\nDear youth, a disposition in you to dress according to the fash-\nion, and to wear lace and gold and artificials for display, will not\nrecommend to others your religion or the truth that you profess.\nPeople of discernment will look upon your attempts to beautify the\nexternal as proof of weak minds and proud hearts. Simple, plain,\nunpretending dress will be a recommendation to my youthful sisters.\nIn no better way can you let your light shine to others than in your\nsimplicity of dress and deportment. You may show to all that, in\ncomparison with eternal things, you place a proper estimate upon\nthe things of this life.\nNow is your golden opportunity to form pure and holy characters\nfor heaven. You cannot afford to devote these precious moments\nto trimming and ruffling and beautifying the external to the neglect\nof the inward adorning. \u201cWhose adorning let it not be that outward\nadorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on\nof apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is\nnot corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which\nis in the sight of God of great price.\u201d\nGod, who created everything lovely and beautiful that the eye\nrests upon, is a lover of the beautiful. He shows you how He esti-\nmates true beauty. The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit is in His\nsight of great price. Shall we not seek earnestly to gain that which\nGod estimates as more valuable than costly dress or pearls or gold?\n354 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nThe inward adorning, the grace of meekness, a spirit in harmony[377]\nwith the heavenly angels, will not lessen true dignity of character or\nmake us less lovely here in this world.\nReligion, pure and undefiled, ennobles its possessor. You will\never find with the true Christian a marked cheerfulness, a holy,\nhappy confidence in God, a submission to His providences, that is\nrefreshing to the soul. By the Christian, God\u2019s love and benevolence\ncan be seen in every bounty he receives. The beauties in nature\nare a theme for contemplation. In studying the natural loveliness\nsurrounding us, the mind is carried up through nature to the Author\nof all that is lovely. All the works of God are speaking to our senses,\nmagnifying His power, exalting His wisdom. Every created thing\nhas in it charms which interest the child of God and mold his taste\nto regard these precious evidences of God\u2019s love above the work of\nhuman skill.\nThe prophet, in words of glowing fervor, magnifies God in His\ncreated works: \u201cWhen I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy\nfingers, the moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; what is\nman, that Thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that Thou\nvisitest him?\u201d \u201cO Lord our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all\nthe earth! I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will\nshow forth all Thy marvelous works.\u201d\nIt is absence of religion that makes the path of so many professors\nof religion shadowy. There are those who may pass for Christians\nbut who are unworthy the name. They have not Christian characters.\nWhen their Christianity is put to the test, its falsity is too evident.\nTrue religion is seen in the daily deportment. The life of the Christian\nis characterized by earnest, unselfish working to do others good and\nto glorify God. His path is not dark and gloomy. An inspired writer\nhas said: \u201cBut the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth\nmore and more unto the perfect day. The way of the wicked is as\ndarkness: they know not at what they stumble.\u201d\nAnd shall the young live vain and thoughtless lives of fashion and\nfrivolity, dwarfing their intellect to the matter of dress and consuming[378]\ntheir time in sensual pleasure? When they are all unready, God may\nsay to them: \u201cThis night your folly shall end.\u201d He may permit mortal\nsickness to come upon those who have borne no fruit to His glory.\nWhile facing the realities of eternity, they may begin to realize the\nAppeal to the Young 355\nvalue of time and of the life they have lost. They may then have\nsome sense of the worth of the soul. They see that their lives have\nnot glorified God in lighting the path of others to heaven. They have\nlived to glorify self. And when racked with pain and with anguish\nof soul they cannot have clear conceptions of eternal things. They\nmay review their past lives, and in their remorse may each cry out:\n\u201cI have done nothing for Jesus, who has done everything for me. My\nlife has been a terrible failure.\u201d\nWhile you pray, dear youth, that you may not be led into temp-\ntation, remember that your work does not end with the prayer. You\nmust then answer your own prayer as far as possible by resisting\ntemptation, and leave that which you cannot do for yourselves for\nJesus to do for you. You cannot be too guarded in your words and in\nyour deportment, lest you invite the enemy to tempt you. Many of\nour youth, by their careless disregard of the warnings and reproofs\ngiven them, open the door wide for Satan to enter. With God\u2019s word\nfor our guide and Jesus as our heavenly Teacher we need not be\nignorant of His requirements or of Satan\u2019s devices and be overcome\nby his temptations. It will be no unpleasant task to be obedient to\nthe will of God when we yield ourselves fully to be directed by His\nSpirit.\nNow is the time to work. If we are children of God, as long as\nwe live in the world He will give us our work. We can never say that\nwe have nothing to do so long as there remains a work undone. I\nwish that all the young could see, as I have seen, the work that they\ncan do and that God will hold them responsible for neglecting. The\ngreatest work that was ever accomplished in the world was done\nby Him who was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. A\nfrivolous-minded person will never accomplish good.\nThe spiritual weakness of many young men and women in this [379]\nage is deplorable because they could be powerful agents for good if\nthey were consecrated to God. I mourn greatly the lack of stability\nwith the young. This we should all deplore. There seems to be a lack\nof power to do right, a lack of earnest effort to obey the calls of duty\nrather than those of inclination. There seems to be with some but\nlittle strength to resist temptation. The reason why they are dwarfs\nin spiritual things is because they do not by exercise grow spiritually\nstrong. They stand still when they should be going forward. Every\n356 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nstep in the life of faith and duty is a step toward heaven. I want\ngreatly to hear of a reformation in many respects such as the young\nhave never heretofore realized. Every inducement that Satan can\ninvent is pressed upon them to make them indifferent and careless\nin regard to eternal things. I suggest that special efforts be made by\nthe youth to help one another to live faithful to their baptismal vows\nand that they pledge themselves solemnly before God to withdraw\ntheir affections from dress and display.\nI would remind the youth who ornament their persons and wear\nfeathers upon their hats that, because of their sins, our Saviour\u2019s\nhead wore the shameful crown of thorns. When you devote pre-\ncious time to trimming your apparel, remember that the King of\nglory wore a plain, seamless coat. You who weary yourselves in\ndecorating your persons, please bear in mind that Jesus was often\nweary from incessant toil and self-denial and self-sacrifice to bless\nthe suffering and needy. He spent whole nights in prayer upon the\nlonely mountains, not because of His weakness and His necessities,\nbut because He saw, He felt, the weakness of your natures to resist\nthe temptations of the enemy upon the very points where you are\nnow overcome. He knew that you would be indifferent in regard to\nyour dangers and would not feel your need of prayer. It was on our\naccount that He poured out His prayers to His Father with strong\ncries and tears. It was to save us from the very pride and love of\nvanity and pleasure which we now indulge, and which crowds out\nthe love of Jesus, that those tears were shed and that our Saviour\u2019s[380]\nvisage was marred with sorrow and anguish more than any of the\nsons of men.\nWill you, young friends, arise and shake off this dreadful indif-\nference and stupor which has conformed you to the world? Will you\nheed the voice of warning which tells you that destruction lies in the\npath of those who are at ease in this hour of danger? God\u2019s patience\nwill not always wait for you, poor, trifling souls. He who holds our\ndestinies in His hands will not always be trifled with. Jesus declares\nto us that there is a greater sin than that which caused the destruction\nof Sodom and Gomorrah. It is the sin of those who have the great\nlight of truth in these days and who are not moved to repentance. It\nis the sin of rejecting the light of the most solemn message of mercy\nto the world. It is the sin of those who see Jesus in the wilderness of\nAppeal to the Young 357\ntemptation, bowed down as with mortal agony because of the sins of\nthe world, and yet are not moved to thorough repentance. He fasted\nnearly six weeks to overcome, in behalf of men, the indulgence of\nappetite and vanity, and the desire for display and worldly honor.\nHe has shown them how they may overcome on their own account\nas He overcame; but it is not pleasant to their natures to endure\nconflict and reproach, derision and shame, for His dear sake. It is not\nagreeable to deny self and to be ever seeking to do good to others. It\nis not pleasant to overcome as Christ overcame, so they turn from\nthe pattern which is plainly given them to copy and refuse to imitate\nthe example that the Saviour came from the heavenly courts to leave\nthem.\nIt shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of\njudgment than for those who have had the privileges and the great\nlight which shines in our day, but who have neglected to follow the\nlight and to give their hearts fully to God.\nChapter 33\u2014Tithes and Offerings[381]\nThe mission of the church of Christ is to save perishing sinners.\nIt is to make known the love of God to men and to win them to\nChrist by the efficacy of that love. The truth for this time must be\ncarried into the dark corners of the earth, and this work may begin\nat home. The followers of Christ should not live selfish lives; but,\nimbued with the Spirit of Christ, they should work in harmony with\nHim.\nThere are causes for the present coldness and unbelief. The\nlove of the world and the cares of life separate the soul from God.\nThe water of life must be in us, and flowing out from us, springing\nup into everlasting life. We must work out what God works in. If\nthe Christian would enjoy the light of life, he must increase his\nefforts to bring others to the knowledge of the truth. His life must\nbe characterized by exertion and sacrifices to do others good; and\nthen there will be no complaints of lack of enjoyment.\nAngels are ever engaged in working for the happiness of others.\nThis is their joy. That which selfish hearts would consider humiliat-\ning service, ministering to those who are wretched and in every way\ninferior in character and rank, is the work of the pure, sinless angels\nin the royal courts of heaven. The spirit of Christ\u2019s self-sacrificing\nlove is the spirit which pervades heaven and is the very essence of\nits bliss.\nThose who feel no special pleasure in seeking to be a blessing\nto others, in working, even at a sacrifice, to do them good, cannot\nhave the spirit of Christ or of heaven; for they have no union with\nthe work of heavenly angels and cannot participate in the bliss that\nimparts elevated joy to them. Christ has said: \u201cJoy shall be in\nheaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and\nnine just persons, which need no repentance.\u201d If the joy of angels is\nto see sinners repent, will it not be the joy of sinners, saved by the\nblood of Christ, to see others repent and turn to Christ through their\ninstrumentality? In working in harmony with Christ and the holy\n358\nTithes and Offerings 359\nangels we shall experience a joy that cannot be realized aside from [382]\nthis work.\nThe principle of the cross of Christ brings all who believe under\nheavy obligations to deny self, to impart light to others, and to give\nof their means to extend the light. If they are in connection with\nheaven they will be engaged in the work in harmony with the angels.\nThe principle of worldlings is to get all they can of the perishable\nthings of this life. Selfish love of gain is the ruling principle in their\nlives. But the purest joy is not found in riches nor where covetous-\nness is always craving, but where contentment reigns and where\nself-sacrificing love is the ruling principle. There are thousands who\nare passing their lives in indulgence and whose hearts are filled with\nrepining. They are victims of selfishness and discontent in the vain\neffort to satisfy their minds with indulgence. But unhappiness is\nstamped upon their very countenances, and behind them is a desert,\nbecause their course is not fruitful in good works.\nIn proportion as the love of Christ fills our hearts and controls our\nlives, covetousness, selfishness, and love of ease will be overcome,\nand it will be our pleasure to do the will of Christ, whose servants\nwe claim to be. Our happiness will then be proportionate to our\nunselfish works, prompted by the love of Christ.\nDivine wisdom has appointed, in the plan of salvation, the law\nof action and reaction, making the work of beneficence, in all its\nbranches, twice blessed. He that gives to the needy blesses others,\nand is blessed himself in a still greater degree. God could have\nreached His object in saving sinners without the aid of man; but He\nknew that man could not be happy without acting a part in the great\nwork in which he would be cultivating self-denial and benevolence.\nThat man might not lose the blessed results of benevolence, our\nRedeemer formed the plan of enlisting him as His co-worker. By\na chain of circumstances which would call forth his charities, He\nbestows upon man the best means of cultivating benevolence and\nkeeps him habitually giving to help the poor and to advance His [383]\ncause. He sends His poor as the representatives of Himself. By\ntheir necessities a ruined world are drawing forth from us talents of\nmeans and of influence to present to them the truth, of which they\nare in perishing need. And as we heed these calls by labor and by\nacts of benevolence we are assimilated to the image of Him who\n360 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nfor our sakes became poor. In bestowing we bless others, and thus\naccumulate true riches.\nThere has been a great lack of Christian benevolence in the\nchurch. Those who were the best able to do for the advancement of\nthe cause of God have done but little. God has mercifully brought\na class to the knowledge of the truth, that they might appreciate\nits priceless value in comparison with earthly treasures. Jesus has\nsaid to these: \u201cFollow Me.\u201d He is testing them with an invitation\nto the supper which He has prepared. He is watching to see what\ncharacters they will develop, whether their own selfish interests will\nbe considered of greater value than eternal riches. Many of these dear\nbrethren are now by their actions framing the excuses mentioned in\nthe following parable:\n\u201cThen said He unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and\nbade many: and sent his servant at suppertime to say to them that\nwere bidden, Come; for all things are now ready. And they all with\none consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have\nbought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee\nhave me excused. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen,\nand I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused. And another\nsaid, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. So that\nservant came, and showed his Lord these things. Then the master of\nthe house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the\nstreets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the\nmaimed, and the halt, and the blind.\u201d\nThis parable correctly represents the condition of many profess-\ning to believe the present truth. The Lord has sent them an invitation\nto come to the supper which He has prepared for them at great cost[384]\nto Himself; but worldly interests look to them of greater impor-\ntance than the heavenly treasure. They are invited to take part in\nthings of eternal value; but their farms, their cattle, and their home\ninterests seem of so much greater importance than obedience to the\nheavenly invitation that they overpower every divine attraction, and\nthese earthly things are made the excuse for their disobedience to\nthe heavenly command, \u201cCome; for all things are now ready.\u201d These\nbrethren are blindly following the example of those represented in\nthe parable. They look at their worldly possessions, and say: No,\nLord, I cannot follow Thee; \u201cI pray Thee have me excused.\u201d\nTithes and Offerings 361\nThe very blessings which God has given to these men to prove\nthem, to see if they will render \u201cunto God the things that are God\u2019s,\u201d\nthey use as an excuse that they cannot obey the claims of truth. They\nhave grasped their earthly treasure in their arms and say, \u201cI must\ntake care of these things; I must not neglect the things of this life;\nthese things are mine.\u201d Thus the hearts of these men have become\nas unimpressible as the beaten highway. They close the door of\ntheir hearts to the heavenly messenger, who says, \u201cCome; for all\nthings are now ready,\u201d and throw it open, inviting the entrance of\nthe world\u2019s burden and business cares, and Jesus knocks in vain for\nadmittance.\nTheir hearts are so overgrown with thorns and with the cares\nof this life that heavenly things can find no place in them. Jesus\ninvites the weary and heavy-laden with promises of rest if they will\ncome to Him. He invites them to exchange the galling yoke of\nselfishness and covetousness, which makes them slaves to mammon,\nfor His yoke, which He declares is easy, and His burden, which is\nlight. He says: \u201cLearn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart:\nand ye shall find rest unto your souls.\u201d He would have them lay\naside the heavy burdens of worldly care and perplexity, and take His\nyoke, which is self-denial and sacrifice for others. This burden will\nprove to be light. Those who refuse to accept the relief which Christ\noffers them, and continue to wear the galling yoke of selfishness, [385]\ntasking their souls to the utmost in plans to accumulate money for\nselfish gratification, have not experienced the peace and rest found in\nbearing the yoke of Christ and lifting the burdens of self-denial and\ndisinterested benevolence which Christ has borne in their behalf.\nWhen the love of the world takes possession of the heart and\nbecomes a ruling passion, there is no room left for adoration to\nGod; for the higher powers of the mind submit to the slavery of\nmammon, and cannot retain thoughts of God and of heaven. The\nmind loses its remembrance of God and is narrowed and dwarfed to\nthe accumulation of money.\nBecause of selfishness and love of the world, these men have\nbeen passing on with less and less sense of the magnitude of the\nwork for these last days. They have not educated their minds to\nmake a business of serving God. They have not an experience\nin that direction. Their property has absorbed their affections and\n362 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\neclipsed the magnitude of the plan of salvation. While they are\nimproving and enlarging their worldly plans, they see no necessity\nfor the enlargement and extension of the work of God. They invest\ntheir means in temporal but not in eternal things. Their hearts are\nambitious for more means. God has made them depositaries of His\nlaw, that they might let the light so graciously given them shine forth\nto others. But they have so increased their cares and anxieties that\nthey have no time to bless others with their influence, to converse\nwith their neighbors, to pray with and for them, and to seek to bring\nthem to the knowledge of the truth.\nThese men are responsible for the good they might do, but from\nwhich they excuse themselves because of worldly cares and burdens,\nwhich engross their minds and absorb their affections. Souls for\nwhom Christ died might be saved by their personal effort and godly\nexample. Precious souls are perishing for the light which God has\ngiven to men to be reflected upon the pathway of others. But the\nprecious light is hid under a bushel, and it gives no light to those\nwho are in the house.\nEvery man is a steward of God. To each the Master has\ncommitted His means, but man claims that means as his own. Christ[386]\nsays: \u201cOccupy till I come.\u201d A time is coming when Christ will\nrequire His own with usury. He will say to each of His stewards:\n\u201cGive an account of thy stewardship.\u201d Those who have hid their\nLord\u2019s money in a napkin in the earth, instead of putting it out to the\nexchangers, and those who have squandered their Lord\u2019s money by\nexpending it for needless things, instead of putting it out to usury by\ninvesting it in His cause, will not receive approval from the Master,\nbut decided condemnation. The unprofitable servant in the parable\nbrought back the one talent to God, and said: \u201cI knew thee that thou\nart an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering\nwhere thou hast not strewed: and I was afraid, and went and hid thy\ntalent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.\u201d His Lord takes\nup his words: \u201cThou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that\nI reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed: thou\noughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then\nat my coming I should have received mine own with usury.\u201d\nThis unprofitable servant was not ignorant of God\u2019s plans, but\nhe set himself firmly to thwart the purpose of God, charging Him\nTithes and Offerings 363\nwith unfairness in requiring improvement upon the talents entrusted\nto him. This very complaint and murmuring is made by a large class\nof wealthy men professing to believe the truth. Like the unfaithful\nservant they are afraid that the increase of the talent that God has\nlent them will be called for to advance the spread of truth; therefore\nthey tie it up by investing it in earthly treasures and burying it in\nthe world, thus making it so fast that they have nothing, or next to\nnothing, to invest in the cause of God. They have buried it, fearing\nthat God would call for some of the principal or increase. When, at\nthe demand of their Lord, they bring the amount given them, they\ncome with ungrateful excuses for not having put the means lent them\nby God out to the exchangers, by investing it in His cause to carry\non His work.\nHe who embezzles his Lord\u2019s goods not only loses the talent [387]\nlent him of God, but loses eternal life. Of him it is said: \u201cCast ye\nthe unprofitable servant into outer darkness.\u201d The faithful servant,\nwho invests his money in the cause of God to save souls, employs\nhis means to the glory of God and will receive the commendation\nof the Master: \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant: ... enter\nthou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d What will be this joy of our Lord? It\nwill be the joy of seeing souls saved in the kingdom of glory. \u201cWho\nfor the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the\nshame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\u201d\nThe idea of stewardship should have a practical bearing upon all\nthe people of God. The parable of the talents, rightly understood,\nwill bar out covetousness, which God calls idolatry. Practical benev-\nolence will give spiritual life to thousands of nominal professors of\nthe truth who now mourn over their darkness. It will transform them\nfrom selfish, covetous worshipers of mammon to earnest, faithful\nco-workers with Christ in the salvation of sinners.\nThe foundation of the plan of salvation was laid in sacrifice.\nJesus left the royal courts and became poor, that we through His\npoverty might be made rich. All who share this salvation, purchased\nfor them at such an infinite sacrifice by the Son of God, will follow\nthe example of the true Pattern. Christ was the chief Cornerstone,\nand we must build upon this Foundation. Each must have a spirit\nof self-denial and self-sacrifice. The life of Christ upon earth was\nunselfish; it was marked with humiliation and sacrifice. And shall\n364 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nmen, partakers of the great salvation which Jesus came from heaven\nto bring them, refuse to follow their Lord and to share in His self-de-\nnial and sacrifice? Says Christ: \u201cI am the Vine, ye are the branches.\u201d\n\u201cEvery branch in Me that beareth not fruit He taketh away: and every\nbranch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it, that it may bring forth more\nfruit.\u201d The very vital principle, the sap which flows through the vine,\nnourishes the branches, that they may flourish and bear fruit. Is the [388]\nservant greater than his Lord? Shall the world\u2019s Redeemer practice\nself-denial and sacrifice on our account, and the members of Christ\u2019s\nbody practice self-indulgence? Self-denial is an essential condition\nof discipleship.\n\u201cThen said Jesus unto His disciples, If any man will come after\nMe, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\u201d I\nlead the way in the path of self-denial. I require nothing of you, My\nfollowers, but that of which I, your Lord, give you an example in\nMy own life.\nThe Saviour of the world conquered Satan in the wilderness of\ntemptation. He overcame to show man how he may overcome. He\nannounced in the synagogue of Nazareth: \u201cThe Spirit of the Lord\nis upon Me, because He hath anointed Me to preach the gospel\nto the poor; He hath sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach\ndeliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to\nset at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of\nthe Lord.\u201d\nThe great work which Jesus announced that He came to do was\nentrusted to His followers upon the earth. Christ, as our head, leads\nout in the great work of salvation and bids us follow His example. He\nhas given us a world-wide message. This truth must be extended to\nall nations, tongues, and people. Satan\u2019s power was to be contested,\nand he was to be overcome by Christ and also by His followers. An\nextensive war was to be maintained against the powers of darkness.\nAnd in order to do this work successfully, means were required. God\ndoes not propose to send means direct from heaven, but He gives\ninto the hands of His followers talents of means to use for the very\npurpose of sustaining this warfare.\nHe has given His people a plan for raising sums sufficient to\nmake the enterprise self-sustaining. God\u2019s plan in the tithing system\nis beautiful in its simplicity and equality. All may take hold of it in\nTithes and Offerings 365\nfaith and courage, for it is divine in its origin. In it are combined\nsimplicity and utility, and it does not require depth of learning to\nunderstand and execute it. All may feel that they can act a part in\ncarrying forward the precious work of salvation. Every man, woman, [389]\nand youth may become a treasurer for the Lord and may be an agent\nto meet the demands upon the treasury. Says the apostle: \u201cLet every\none of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him.\u201d\nGreat objects are accomplished by this system. If one and all\nwould accept it, each would be made a vigilant and faithful treasurer\nfor God, and there would be no want of means with which to carry\nforward the great work of sounding the last message of warning to\nthe world. The treasury will be full if all adopt this system, and the\ncontributors will not be left the poorer. Through every investment\nmade they will become more wedded to the cause of present truth.\nThey will be \u201claying up in store for themselves a good foundation\nagainst the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.\u201d\nAs the persevering, systematic workers see that the tendency of\ntheir benevolent efforts is to nourish love to God and their fellow\nmen, and that their personal efforts are extending their sphere of\nusefulness, they will realize that it is a great blessing to be co-workers\nwith Christ. The Christian church, as a general thing, are disowning\nthe claims of God upon them to give alms of the things which they\npossess to support the warfare against the moral darkness which is\nflooding the world. Never can the work of God advance as it should\nuntil the followers of Christ become active, zealous workers.\nEvery individual in the church should feel that the truth which he\nprofesses is a reality, and all should be disinterested workers. Some\nrich men feel like murmuring because the work of God is extending\nand there is a demand for money. They say that there is no end to\nthe calls for means. One object after another is continually arising,\ndemanding help. To such we would say that we hope the cause of\nGod will so extend that there will be greater occasion, and more\nfrequent and urgent calls, for supplies from the treasury to prosecute\nthe work.\nIf the plan of systematic benevolence were adopted by every\nindividual and fully carried out, there would be a constant supply in [390]\nthe treasury. The income would flow in like a steady stream con-\nstantly supplied by overflowing springs of benevolence. Almsgiving\n366 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nis a part of gospel religion. Does not the consideration of the infi-\nnite price paid for our redemption leave upon us solemn obligations\npecuniarily, as well as lay claim upon all our powers to be devoted\nto the work of the Master?\nWe shall have a debt to settle with the Master by and by, when\nHe shall say: \u201cGive an account of thy stewardship.\u201d If men prefer\nto set aside the claims of God and to grasp and selfishly retain all\nthat He gives them, He will hold His peace at present and continue\nfrequently to test them by increasing His bounties by letting His\nblessings flow on, and these men may pass on receiving honor of\nmen and without censure in the church; but by and by He will say:\n\u201cGive an account of thy stewardship.\u201d Says Christ: \u201cInasmuch as\nye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me.\u201d \u201cYe\nare not your own, for ye are bought with a price,\u201d and are under\nobligation to glorify God with your means as well as in your body\nand in your spirit, which are His. \u201cYe are bought with a price,\u201c not\n\u201cwith corruptible things, as silver and gold,\u201d \u201cbut with the precious\nblood of Christ.\u201d He asks a return of the gifts that He has entrusted\nto us, to aid in the salvation of souls. He has given His blood; He\nasks our silver. It is through His poverty that we are made rich; and\nwill we refuse to give back to Him His own gifts?\nGod is not dependent upon man for the support of His cause. He\ncould have sent means direct from heaven to supply His treasury,\nif His providence had seen that this was best for man. He might\nhave devised means whereby angels would have been sent to publish\nthe truth to the world without the agency of men. He might have\nwritten the truth upon the heavens, and let that declare to the world\nHis requirements in living characters. God is not dependent upon\nany man\u2019s gold or silver. He says: \u201cEvery beast of the forest is Mine,\nand the cattle upon a thousand hills.\u201d \u201cIf I were hungry, I would not\ntell thee: for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof.\u201d Whatever[391]\nnecessity there is for our agency in the advancement of the cause of\nGod, He has purposely arranged for our good. He has honored us by\nmaking us co-workers with Him. He has ordained that there should\nbe a necessity for the co-operation of men, that they may keep in\nexercise their benevolence.\nGod has in His wise providence placed the poor always with\nus, that while we should witness the various forms of want and\nTithes and Offerings 367\nsuffering in the world, we should be tested and proved, and brought\ninto positions to develop Christian character. He has placed the poor\namong us to call out from us Christian sympathy and love.\nSinners, who are perishing for lack of knowledge, must be left\nin ignorance and darkness unless men carry to them the light of\ntruth. God will not send angels from heaven to do the work which\nHe has left for man to do. He has given all a work to do, for the very\nreason that He might prove them and that they might reveal their true\ncharacter. Christ places the poor among us as His representatives. \u201cI\nwas an hungered,\u201d He says, \u201cand ye gave Me no meat: I was thirsty,\nand ye gave Me no drink.\u201d Christ identifies Himself with suffering\nhumanity in the persons of the suffering children of men. He makes\ntheir necessities His own and takes to His bosom their woes.\nThe moral darkness of a ruined world pleads to Christian men\nand women to put forth individual effort, to give of their means and\nof their influence, that they may be assimilated to the image of Him\nwho, though He possessed infinite riches, yet for our sakes became\npoor. The Spirit of God cannot abide with those to whom He has\nsent the message of His truth but who need to be urged before they\ncan have any sense of their duty to be co-workers with Christ. The\napostle enforces the duty of giving from higher grounds than merely\nhuman sympathy because the feelings are moved. He enforces the\nprinciple that we should labor unselfishly with an eye single to the\nglory of God.\nChristians are required by the Scriptures to enter upon a plan of [392]\nactive benevolence which will keep in constant exercise an interest\nin the salvation of their fellow men. The moral law enjoined the\nobservance of the Sabbath, which was not a burden except when that\nlaw was transgressed and they were bound by the penalties involved\nin breaking it. The tithing system was no burden to those who did\nnot depart from the plan. The system enjoined upon the Hebrews has\nnot been repealed or relaxed by the One who originated it. Instead\nof being of no force now, it was to be more fully carried out and\nmore extended, as salvation through Christ alone should be more\nfully brought to light in the Christian age.\nJesus made known to the lawyer that the condition of his having\neternal life was to carry out in his life the special requirements of\nthe law, which consisted in his loving God with all his heart, and\n368 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nsoul, and mind, and strength, and his neighbor as himself. When\nthe typical sacrifices ceased at the death of Christ, the original law,\nengraved in tables of stone, stood immutable, holding its claims\nupon man in all ages. And in the Christian age the duty of man was\nnot limited, but more especially defined and simply expressed.\nThe gospel, extending and widening, required greater provisions\nto sustain the warfare after the death of Christ, and this made the\nlaw of almsgiving a more urgent necessity than under the Hebrew\ngovernment. Now God requires, not less, but greater gifts than at\nany other period of the world. The principle laid down by Christ\nis that the gifts and offerings should be in proportion to the light\nand blessings enjoyed. He has said: \u201cFor unto whomsoever much is\ngiven, of him shall be much required.\u201d\nThe blessings of the Christian Age were responded to by the\nfirst disciples in works of charity and benevolence. The outpouring\nof the Spirit of God, after Christ left His disciples and ascended to\nheaven, led to self-denial and self-sacrifice for the salvation of others.\nWhen the poor saints at Jerusalem were in distress, Paul wrote to\nthe Gentile Christians in regard to works of benevolence, and said:\n\u201cTherefore, as ye abound in everything, in faith, and utterance, and\nknowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye[393]\nabound in this grace also.\u201d Here benevolence is placed by the side\nof faith, love, and Christian diligence. Those who think that they\ncan be good Christians and close their ears and hearts to the calls of\nGod for their liberalities, are in a fearful deception. There are those\nwho abound in professions of great love for the truth, and, so far as\nwords are concerned, have an interest to see the truth advance, but\nwho do nothing for its advancement. The faith of such is dead, not\nbeing made perfect by works. The Lord never made such a mistake\nas to convert a soul and leave it under the power of covetousness.\nThe tithing system reaches back beyond the days of Moses. Men\nwere required to offer to God gifts for religious purposes before the\ndefinite system was given to Moses, even as far back as the days of\nAdam. In complying with God\u2019s requirements, they were to manifest\nin offerings their appreciation of His mercies and blessings to them.\nThis was continued through successive generations, and was carried\nout by Abraham, who gave tithes to Melchizedek, the priest of the\nmost high God. The same principle existed in the days of Job. Jacob,\nTithes and Offerings 369\nwhen at Bethel, an exile and penniless wanderer, lay down at night,\nsolitary and alone, with a rock for his pillow, and there promised\nthe Lord: \u201cOf all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth\nunto Thee.\u201d God does not compel men to give. All that they give\nmust be voluntary. He will not have His treasury replenished with\nunwilling offerings.\nThe Lord designed to bring man into close relationship with\nHimself and into sympathy and love with his fellow men by placing\nupon him responsibilities in deeds that would counteract selfishness\nand strengthen his love for God and man. The plan of system in\nbenevolence God designed for the good of man, who is inclined\nto be selfish and to close his heart to generous deeds. The Lord\nrequires gifts to be made at stated times, being so arranged that\ngiving will become habit and benevolence be felt to be a Christian\nduty. The heart, opened by one gift, is not to have time to become\nselfishly cold and to close before the next is bestowed. The stream\nis to be continually flowing, thus keeping open the channel by acts [394]\nof benevolence.\nAs to the amount required, God has specified one tenth of the\nincrease. This is left to the conscience and benevolence of men,\nwhose judgment in this tithing system should have free play. And\nwhile it is left free to the conscience, a plan has been laid out definite\nenough for all. No compulsion is required.\nGod called for men in the Mosaic dispensation to give the tenth\nof all their increase. He committed to their trust the things of this\nlife, talents to be improved and returned to Him. He has required\na tenth, and this He claims as the very least that man should return\nto Him. He says: I give you nine tenths, while I require one tenth;\nthat is Mine. When men withhold the one tenth, they rob God. Sin\nofferings, peace offerings, and thank offerings were also required in\naddition to the tenth of the increase.\nAll that is withheld of that which God claims, the tenth of the\nincrease, is recorded in the books of heaven against the withholders,\nas robbery. Such defraud their Creator; and when this sin of neglect\nis brought before them, it is not enough for them to change their\ncourse and begin to work from that time upon the right principle.\nThis will not correct the figures made in the heavenly record for\nembezzling the property committed to them in trust to be returned\n370 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nto the Lender. Repentance for unfaithful dealing with God, and for\nbase ingratitude, is required.\n\u201cWill a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me. But ye say,\nWherein have we robbed Thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are\ncursed with a curse: for ye have robbed Me, even this whole nation.\nBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in\nMine house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts,\nif I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a\nblessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\u201d A promise\nis here given that, if all the tithes are brought into the storehouse, a\nblessing from God will be poured upon the obedient.\n\u201cAnd I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not[395]\ndestroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her\nfruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. And all\nnations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land,\nsaith the Lord of hosts.\u201d If all who profess the truth will come up to\nthe claims of God in giving the tenth, which God says is His, the\ntreasury will be abundantly supplied with means to carry forward\nthe great work for the salvation of man.\nGod gives man nine tenths, while He claims one tenth for sacred\npurposes, as He has given man six days for his own work and has\nreserved and set apart the seventh day to Himself. For, like the\nSabbath, a tenth of the increase is sacred; God has reserved it for\nHimself. He will carry forward His work upon the earth with the\nincrease of the means that He has entrusted to man.\nGod required of His ancient people three yearly gatherings.\n\u201cThree times in a year shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy\nGod in the place which He shall choose; in the Feast of Unleavened\nBread, and in the Feast of Weeks, and in the Feast of Tabernacles:\nand they shall not appear before the Lord empty: every man shall\ngive as he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God\nwhich He hath given thee.\u201d No less than one third of their income\nwas devoted to sacred and religious purposes.\nWhenever God\u2019s people, in any period of the world, have cheer-\nfully and willingly carried out His plan in systematic benevolence\nand in gifts and offerings, they have realized the standing promise\nthat prosperity should attend all their labors just in proportion as\nthey obeyed His requirements. When they acknowledged the claims\nTithes and Offerings 371\nof God and complied with His requirements, honoring Him with\ntheir substance, their barns were filled with plenty. But when they\nrobbed God in tithes and in offerings they were made to realize that\nthey were not only robbing Him but themselves, for He limited His\nblessings to them just in proportion as they limited their offerings to\nHim.\nSome will pronounce this one of the rigorous laws binding upon [396]\nthe Hebrews. But this was not a burden to the willing heart that\nloved God. It was only when their selfish natures were strengthened\nby withholding that men lost sight of eternal considerations and\nvalued their earthly treasures above souls. There are even more\nurgent necessities upon the Israel of God in these last days than\nwere upon ancient Israel. There is a great and important work to be\naccomplished in a very short time. God never designed that the law\nof the tithing system should be of no account among His people;\nbut, instead of this, He designed that the spirit of sacrifice should\nwiden and deepen for the closing work.\nSystematic benevolence should not be made systematic com-\npulsion. It is freewill offerings that are acceptable to God. True\nChristian benevolence springs from the principle of grateful love.\nLove to Christ cannot exist without corresponding love to those\nwhom He came into the world to redeem. Love to Christ must be the\nruling principle of the being, controlling all the emotions and direct-\ning all the energies. Redeeming love should awaken all the tender\naffection and self-sacrificing devotion that can possibly exist in the\nheart of man. When this is the case, no heart-stirring appeals will be\nneeded to break through their selfishness and awaken their dormant\nsympathies, to call forth benevolent offerings for the precious cause\nof truth.\nJesus has purchased us at an infinite sacrifice. All our capabilities\nand our influence are indeed our Saviour\u2019s, and should be dedicated\nto His service. By doing this we show our gratitude that we have\nbeen ransomed from the slavery of sin by the precious blood of\nChrist. Our Saviour is ever working for us. He has ascended on high\nand pleads in behalf of the purchase of His blood. He pleads before\nHis Father the agonies of the crucifixion. He raises His wounded\nhands and intercedes for His church, that they may be kept from\nfalling under temptation.\n372 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nIf our perceptions could be quickened to take in this wonderful\nwork of our Saviour for our salvation, love, deep and ardent, would[397]\nburn in our hearts. Our apathy and cold indifference would then\nalarm us. Entire devotion and benevolence, prompted by grateful\nlove, will impart to the smallest offering, the willing sacrifice, a\ndivine fragrance, making the gift of priceless value. But, after\nwillingly yielding to our Redeemer all that we can bestow, be it ever\nso valuable to us, if we view our debt of gratitude to God as it really\nis, all that we may have offered will seem to us very insufficient and\nmeager. But angels take these offerings, which to us seem poor, and\npresent them as a fragrant offering before the throne, and they are\naccepted.\nWe do not, as followers of Christ, realize our true position. We\ndo not have correct views of our responsibilities as hired servants\nof Christ. He has advanced us the wages in His suffering life and\nspilled blood, to bind us in willing servitude to Himself. All the\ngood things we have are a loan from our Saviour. He has made us\nstewards. Our smallest offerings, our humblest services, presented in\nfaith and love, may be consecrated gifts to win souls to the service of\nthe Master and to promote His glory. The interest and prosperity of\nChrist\u2019s kingdom should be paramount to every other consideration.\nThose who make their pleasure and selfish interest the chief objects\nof their lives are not faithful stewards.\nThose who deny self to do others good, and who devote them-\nselves and all they have to Christ\u2019s service, will realize the happiness\nwhich the selfish man seeks for in vain. Said our Saviour: \u201cWhoso-\never he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be\nMy disciple.\u201d Charity \u201cseeketh not her own.\u201d This is the fruit of that\ndisinterested love and benevolence which characterized the life of\nChrist. The law of God in our hearts will bring our own interests in\nsubordination to high and eternal considerations. We are enjoined\nby Christ to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.\nThis is our first and highest duty. Our Master expressly warned His\nservants not to lay up treasures upon the earth; for in so doing their\nhearts would be upon earthly rather than heavenly things. Here is\nwhere many poor souls have made shipwreck of faith. They have[398]\ngone directly contrary to the express injunction of our Lord, and\nhave allowed the love of money to become the ruling passion of\nTithes and Offerings 373\ntheir lives. They are intemperate in their efforts to acquire means.\nThey are as much intoxicated with their insane desire for riches as is\nthe inebriate with his liquor.\nChristians forget that they are servants of the Master; that they\nthemselves, their time, and all that they have belong to Him. Many\nare tempted, and the majority are overcome, by the delusive induce-\nments which Satan presents to invest their money where it will yield\nthem the greatest profit in dollars and cents. There are but few who\nconsider the binding claims that God has upon them to make it their\nfirst business to meet the necessities of His cause and let their own\ndesires be served last. There are but few who invest in God\u2019s cause\nin proportion to their means. Many have fastened their money in\nproperty which they must sell before they can invest it in the cause of\nGod and thus put it to a practical use. They make this an excuse for\ndoing but little in their Redeemer\u2019s cause. They have as effectually\nburied their money in the earth as had the man in the parable. They\nrob God of the tenth, which He claims as His own, and in robbing\nHim they rob themselves of the heavenly treasure.\nThe plan of systematic benevolence does not press heavily upon\nany one man. \u201cNow concerning the collection for the saints, as I\nhave given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. Upon the\nfirst day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God\nhath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.\u201d The\npoor are not excluded from the privilege of giving. They, as well\nas the wealthy, may act a part in this work. The lesson that Christ\ngave in regard to the widow\u2019s two mites shows us that the smallest\nwilling offerings of the poor, if given from a heart of love, are as\nacceptable as the largest donations of the rich.\nIn the balances of the sanctuary the gifts of the poor, made from\nlove to Christ, are not estimated according to the amount given, but [399]\naccording to the love which prompts the sacrifice. The promises of\nJesus will as surely be realized by the liberal poor man, who has but\nlittle to offer, but who gives that little freely, as by the wealthy man\nwho gives of his abundance. The poor man makes a sacrifice of his\nlittle, which he really feels. He really denies himself of some things\nthat he needs for his own comfort, while the wealthy man gives\nof his abundance, and feels no want, denies himself nothing that\nhe really needs. Therefore there is a sacredness in the poor man\u2019s\n374 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\noffering that is not found in the rich man\u2019s gift, for the rich give of\ntheir abundance. God\u2019s providence has arranged the entire plan of\nsystematic benevolence for the benefit of man. His providence never\nstands still. If God\u2019s servants follow His opening providence, all\nwill be active workers.\nThose who withhold from the treasury of God and hoard their\nmeans for their children, endanger the spiritual interest of their chil-\ndren. They place their property, which is a stumbling block to\nthemselves, in the pathway of their children, that they may stumble\nover it to perdition. Many are making a great mistake in regard to\nthe things of this life. They economize, withholding from them-\nselves and others the good they might receive from a right use of the\nmeans which God has lent them, and become selfish and avaricious.\nThey neglect their spiritual interests and become dwarfs in religious\ngrowth, all for the sake of accumulating wealth which they cannot\nuse. They leave their property to their children, and nine times out\nof ten it is even a greater curse to their heirs than it has been to\nthemselves. Children, relying upon the property of their parents,\noften fail to make a success of this life, and generally utterly fail\nto secure the life to come. The very best legacy which parents can\nleave their children is a knowledge of useful labor and the example\nof a life characterized by disinterested benevolence. By such a life\nthey show the true value of money, that it is only to be appreciated\nfor the good that it will accomplish in relieving their own wants and\nthe necessities of others, and in advancing the cause of God.\nSome are willing to give according to what they have, and feel[400]\nthat God has no further claims upon them, because they have not a\ngreat amount of means. They have no income that they can spare\nfrom the necessities of their families. But there are many of this\nclass who might ask themselves the question: Am I giving according\nto what I might have had? God designed that their powers of body\nand mind should be put to use. Some have not improved to the best\naccount the ability that God has given them. Labor is apportioned\nto man. It was connected with the curse, because made necessary\nby sin. The physical, mental, and moral well-being of man makes a\nlife of useful labor necessary. \u201cBe ... not slothful in business,\u201d is the\ninjunction of the inspired apostle Paul.\nTithes and Offerings 375\nNo person, whether rich or poor, can glorify God by a life of\nindolence. All the capital that many poor men have is time and\nphysical strength, and this is frequently wasted in love of ease and in\ncareless indolence so that they have nothing to bring to their Lord in\ntithes and in offerings. If Christian men lack wisdom to labor to the\nbest account and to make a judicious appropriation of their physical\nand mental powers, they should have meekness and lowliness of\nmind to receive advice and counsel of their brethren, that their better\njudgment may supply their own deficiencies. Many poor men who\nare now content to do nothing for the good of their fellow men and\nfor the advancement of the cause of God might do much if they\nwould. They are as accountable to God for their capital of physical\nstrength as is the rich man for his capital of money.\nSome who ought to put means into the treasury of God will be\nreceivers from it. There are those who are now poor who might\nimprove their condition by a judicious use of their time, by avoid-\ning patent rights, and by restraining their inclination to engage in\nspeculations in order to obtain means in some easier way than by\npatient, persevering labor. If those who have not made life a success\nwere willing to be instructed, they could train themselves to habits\nof self-denial and strict economy, and have the satisfaction of be- [401]\ning distributors, rather than receivers, of charity. There are many\nslothful servants. If they would do what it is in their power to do\nthey would experience so great a blessing in helping others that they\nwould indeed realize that \u201cit is more blessed to give than to receive.\u201d\nRightly directed benevolence draws upon the mental and moral\nenergies of men, and excites them to most healthful action in bless-\ning the needy and in advancing the cause of God. If those who have\nmeans should realize that they are accountable to God for every\ndollar that they expend, their supposed wants would be much less.\nIf conscience were alive, she would testify of needless appropria-\ntions to the gratification of appetite, of pride, vanity, and love of\namusements, and would report the squandering of the Lord\u2019s money,\nwhich should have been devoted to His cause. Those who waste\ntheir Lord\u2019s goods will by and by have to give an account of their\ncourse to the Master.\nIf professed Christians would use less of their wealth in adorning\nthe body and in beautifying their own houses, and would consume\n376 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nless in extravagant, health-destroying luxuries upon their tables,\nthey could place much larger sums in the treasury of God. They\nwould thus imitate their Redeemer, who left heaven, His riches,\nand His glory, and for our sakes became poor, that we might have\neternal riches. If we are too poor to faithfully render to God the\ntithes and offerings that He requires, we are certainly too poor to\ndress expensively and to eat luxuriously; for we thus waste our\nLord\u2019s money in hurtful indulgences to please and glorify ourselves.\nWe should inquire diligently of ourselves: What treasure have we\nsecured in the kingdom of God? Are we rich toward God?\nJesus gave His disciples a lesson upon covetousness. \u201cAnd He\nspake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man\nbrought forth plentifully: and he thought within himself, saying,\nWhat shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?\nAnd he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build[402]\ngreater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I\nwill say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many\nyears; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto\nhim, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then\nwhose shall those things be, which thou hast provided? So is he that\nlayeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.\u201d\nThe length and happiness of life does not consist in the amount\nof our earthly possessions. This foolish rich man in his supreme\nselfishness had laid up for himself treasures that he could not use.\nHe had lived only for himself. He had over-reached in trade, had\nmade sharp bargains, and had not exercised mercy or the love of\nGod. He had robbed the fatherless and widow, and defrauded his\nfellow men, to add to his increasing stock of worldly possessions.\nHe might have laid up his treasure in heaven in bags that wax not\nold; but through his covetousness he lost both worlds. Those who\nhumbly use to the glory of God the means that He has entrusted to\nthem will receive their treasure by and by from the Master\u2019s hand\nwith the benediction: \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant: ... enter\nthou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d\nWhen we consider the infinite sacrifice made for the salvation\nof men we are lost in amazement. When selfishness clamors for\nthe victory in the hearts of men, and they are tempted to withhold\ntheir due proportion in any good work, they should strengthen their\nTithes and Offerings 377\nprinciples of right by the thought that He who was rich in heaven\u2019s\npriceless treasure turned away from it all and became poor. He had\nnot where to lay His head. And all this sacrifice was in our behalf,\nthat we might have eternal riches.\nChrist set His own feet in the path of self-denial and sacrifice\nwhich all His disciples must travel if they would be exalted with\nHim at last. He took to His own heart the sorrows which man must\nsuffer. The minds of worldly men frequently become gross. They\ncan see only earthly things, which eclipse the glory and value of\nheavenly things. Men will compass land and sea for earthly gain, [403]\nand endure privation and suffering to obtain their object, yet will\nturn away from heaven\u2019s attractions and not regard eternal riches.\nMen who are in comparative poverty are usually the ones who do\nthe most to sustain the cause of God. They are generous with their\nlittle. They have strengthened their generous impulses by continual\nliberalities. When their expenditures pressed close upon the income,\ntheir passion for earthly riches had no room or chance to strengthen.\nBut many, when they begin to gather earthly riches, commence\nto calculate how long it will be before they can be in possession of a\ncertain sum. In their anxiety to amass wealth for themselves they\nfail to become rich toward God. Their benevolence does not keep\npace with their accumulation. As their passion for riches increases,\ntheir affections are bound up with their treasure. The increase of\ntheir property strengthens the eager desire for more, until some\nconsider that their giving to the Lord a tenth is a severe and unjust\ntax. Inspiration has said: \u201cIf riches increase, set not your heart upon\nthem.\u201d Many have said: \u201cIf I were as rich as such a one, I would\nmultiply my gifts to the treasury of God. I would do nothing else\nwith my wealth but use it for the advancement of the cause of God.\u201d\nGod has tested some of these by giving them riches, but with the\nriches came the fiercer temptation, and their benevolence was far\nless than in the days of their poverty. A grasping desire for greater\nriches absorbed their minds and hearts, and they committed idolatry.\nHe who presents to men infinite riches and an eternal life of\nblessedness in His kingdom as the reward of faithful obedience, will\nnot accept a divided heart. We are living amid the perils of the last\ndays, where there is everything to divert the mind and allure the\naffections from God. Our duty will only be discerned and appreci-\n378 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nated when viewed in the light which shines from the life of Christ.\nAs the sun rises in the east and passes toward the west, filling the\nworld with light, so the true follower of Christ will be a light unto\nthe world. He will go out into the world as a bright and shining light,[404]\nthat those who are in darkness may be lightened and warmed by the\nrays shining forth from him. Christ says of His followers: \u201cYe are\nthe light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.\u201d\nOur great Exemplar was self-denying, and shall the course of His\nprofessed followers be in such marked contrast to His? The Saviour\ngave all for a perishing world, not withholding even Himself. The\nchurch of God are asleep. They are enfeebled by inaction. V oices\ncome to us from every part of the world, \u201cCome over and help us;\u201d\nbut there is no answering movement. There is a feeble effort now and\nthen; a few show that they would be co-workers with their Master;\nbut such are frequently left to toil almost alone. There is but one\nmissionary from our people in all the wide field in foreign countries.\nThe truth is mighty, but it is not carried into practice. It is\nnot sufficient to lay money alone upon the altar. God calls for men,\nvolunteers, to carry the truth to other nations and tongues and people.\nIt is not our numbers nor our wealth that will give us a signal victory;\nbut it is devotion to the work, moral courage, ardent love for souls,\nand untiring, unflagging zeal.\nThere are many who have looked upon the Jewish nation as\na people to be pitied because they were constantly taxed for the\nsupport of their religion; but God, who created man and provided\nhim with all the blessings he enjoys, knew what was for his best\ngood. And through His blessing He made their nine tenths worth\nmore to them than the entire amount without His blessing. If any,\nthrough selfishness, robbed God or brought to Him an offering not\nperfect, disaster and loss were sure to follow them. God reads the\nmotives of the heart. He is acquainted with the purposes of men and\nwill mete out to them in His own good time as they have merited.\nThe special system of tithing was founded upon a principle\nwhich is as enduring as the law of God. This system of tithing was a\nblessing to the Jews, else God would not have given it them. So also\nwill it be a blessing to those who carry it out to the end of time. Our[405]\nheavenly Father did not originate the plan of systematic benevolence\nTithes and Offerings 379\nto enrich Himself, but to be a great blessing to man. He saw that this\nsystem of beneficence was just what man needed.\nThose churches who are the most systematic and liberal in sus-\ntaining the cause of God are the most prosperous spiritually. True\nliberality in the follower of Christ identifies his interest with that of\nhis Master. In God\u2019s dealing with the Jews and His people to the end\nof time, He requires systematic benevolence proportionate to their\nincome. The plan of salvation was laid by the infinite sacrifice of the\nSon of God. The light of the gospel shining from the cross of Christ\nrebukes selfishness and encourages liberality and benevolence. It\nis not to be a lamented fact that there are increasing calls to give.\nGod in His providence is calling His people out from their limited\nsphere of action to enter upon greater enterprises. Unlimited effort\nis demanded at this time when moral darkness is covering the world.\nWorldliness and covetousness are eating out the vitals of God\u2019s peo-\nple. They should understand that it is His mercy which multiplies\nthe demands for their means. The angel of God places benevolent\nacts close beside prayer. He said to Cornelius: \u201cThy prayers and\nthine alms are come up for a memorial before God.\u201d\nIn the teachings of Christ He said: \u201cIf therefore ye have not been\nfaithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust\nthe true riches?\u201d The spiritual health and prosperity of the church\nis dependent in a great degree upon her systematic benevolence.\nIt is like the lifeblood which must flow through the whole being,\nvitalizing every member of the body. It increases love for the souls of\nour fellow men; for by self-denial and self-sacrifice we are brought\ninto a closer relation to Christ, who for our sakes became poor. The\nmore we invest in the cause of God to aid in the salvation of souls,\nthe closer to our hearts will they be brought. Were our numbers half\nas large, and all of these devoted workers, we should have a power\nthat would make the world tremble. To the active workers Christ has\naddressed these words: \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end [406]\nof the world.\u201d\nWe shall meet opposition arising from selfish motives and from\nbigotry and prejudice; yet, with undaunted courage and living faith,\nwe should sow beside all waters. The agents of Satan are formidable;\nwe shall meet them and must combat them. Our labors are not to be\nconfined to our own country. The field is the world; the harvest is\n380 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nripe. The command given by Christ to the disciples just before He\nascended was: \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to\nevery creature.\u201d\nWe feel pained beyond measure to see some of our ministers\nhovering about the churches, apparently putting forth some little\neffort, but having next to nothing to show for their labors. The field\nis the world. Let them go out into the unbelieving world and labor\nto convert souls to the truth. We refer our brethren and sisters to\nthe example of Abraham going up to Mount Moriah to offer his\nonly son at the command of God. Here was obedience and sacrifice.\nMoses was in kingly courts, and a prospective crown was before\nhim. But he turned away from the tempting bribe, and \u201crefused to\nbe called the son of Pharaoh\u2019s daughter; choosing rather to suffer\naffliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin\nfor a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than\nthe treasures in Egypt.\u201d\nThe apostles counted not their lives dear unto themselves, re-\njoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name\nof Christ. Paul and Silas suffered the loss of all things. They suf-\nfered scourging, and were in no gentle manner thrown upon the cold\nfloor of a dungeon in a most painful position, their feet elevated\nand fastened in the stocks. Did repinings and complaints then reach\nthe ear of the jailer? Oh, no! From the inner prison, voices broke\nthe silence of midnight with songs of joy and praise to God. These\ndisciples were cheered by a deep and earnest love for the cause of\ntheir Redeemer, for which they suffered.\nAs the truth of God fills our hearts, absorbs our affections, and\ncontrols our lives, we also will count it joy to suffer for the truth\u2019s\nsake. No prison walls, no martyr\u2019s stake, can then daunt or hinder[407]\nus in the great work.\nCome, O my soul, to Calvary.\nMark the humble life of the Son of God. He was \u201ca man of sorrows,\nand acquainted with grief.\u201d Behold His ignominy, His agony in\nGethsemane, and learn what self-denial is. Are we suffering want?\nso was Christ, the Majesty of heaven. But His poverty was for our\nsakes. Are we ranked among the rich? so was He. But He consented\nTithes and Offerings 381\nfor our sakes to become poor, that we through His poverty might be\nmade rich. In Christ we have self-denial exemplified. His sacrifice\nconsisted not merely in leaving the royal courts of heaven, in being\ntried by wicked men as a criminal and pronounced guilty, and in\nbeing delivered up to die as a malefactor, but in bearing the weight of\nthe sins of the world. The life of Christ rebukes our indifference and\ncoldness. We are near the close of time, when Satan has come down,\nhaving great wrath, knowing that his time is short. He is working\nwith all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish. The\nwarfare has been left in our hands by our great Leader for us to carry\nforward with vigor. We are not doing a twentieth part of what we\nmight do if we were awake. The work is retarded by love of ease\nand a lack of the self-denying spirit of which our Saviour has given\nus an example in His life. Co-workers with Christ, men who feel\nthe need of extended effort, are wanted. The work of our presses\nshould not be lessened, but doubled. Schools should be established\nin different places to educate our youth preparatory to their laboring\nto advance the truth.\nAlready a great deal of time has been wasted, and angels bear\nto heaven the record of our neglects. Our sleepy and unconsecrated\ncondition has lost to us precious opportunities which God has sent us\nin the persons of those who were qualified to help us in our present\nneed. Oh, how much we need our Hannah More to aid us at this time\nin reaching other nations! Her extensive knowledge of missionary\nfields would give us access to those of other tongues whom we\ncannot now approach. God brought this gift among us to meet our [408]\npresent emergency; but we prized not the gift, and He took her from\nus. She is at rest from her labors, but her self-denying works follow\nher. It is to be deplored that our missionary work should be retarded\nfor the want of knowledge how to gain access to the different nations\nand localities in the great harvest field.\nWe feel anguish of spirit because some gifts are lost to us that\nwe might now have if we had only been awake. Laborers have been\nkept back from the whitening harvest. It becomes the people of God\nto humble their hearts before Him, and in the deepest humiliation\nto pray the Lord to pardon our apathy and selfish indulgence, and\nto blot out the shameful record of duties neglected and privileges\nunimproved. In contemplation of the cross of Calvary the true\n382 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nChristian will abandon the thought of restricting his offerings to that\nwhich costs him nothing and will hear in trumpet tones:\nGo, labor in My vineyard;\nThere\u2019s resting by and by.\nWhen Jesus was about to ascend on high, He pointed to the\nharvest fields and said to His followers: \u201cGo ye into all the world,\nand preach the gospel.\u201d \u201cFreely ye have received, freely give.\u201d Shall\nwe deny self that the wasting harvest may be gathered?\nGod calls for talents of influence and of means. Shall we refuse\nto obey? Our heavenly Father bestows gifts and solicits a portion\nback, that He may test us whether we are worthy to have the gift of\neverlasting life.\n* * * * *\nChapter 34\u2014Systematic Benevolence\nShould all whom God has prospered with earth\u2019s riches carry out\nHis plan by faithfully giving a tenth of all their increase, and should\nthey not withhold their trespass offerings and their thank offerings,\nthe treasury would be constantly replenished. The simplicity of the [409]\nplan of systematic benevolence does not detract from its merits, but\nextols the wisdom of God in its arrangement. Everything bearing the\ndivine stamp unites simplicity with utility. If systematic benevolence\nwere universally adopted according to God\u2019s plan, and the tithing\nsystem carried out as faithfully by the wealthy as it is by the poorer\nclasses, there would be no need of repeated and urgent calls for\nmeans at our large religious gatherings. There has been a neglect\nin the churches of keeping up the plan of systematic benevolence,\nand the result has been an impoverished treasury and a backslidden\nchurch.\n\u201cWill a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me. But ye say,\nWherein have we robbed Thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are\ncursed with a curse: for ye have robbed Me, even this whole nation.\nBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in\nMine house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts,\nif I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a\nblessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I\nwill rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the\nfruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before\nthe time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts. And all nations shall\ncall you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord\nof hosts.\u201d\nGod has been robbed in tithes and offerings. It is a fearful\nthing to be guilty of withholding from the treasury or of robbing\nGod. Ministers who preach the word at our large gatherings feel the\nsinfulness of neglecting to render to God the things that are His. They\nknow that God will not bless His people while they are disregarding\nHis plan of benevolence. They seek to arouse the people to their duty\n383\n384 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nby pointed, practical discourses, showing the danger and sinfulness\nof selfishness and covetousness. Conviction fastens upon minds, and\nthe icy chill of selfishness is broken. And when the call is made for\ndonations to the cause of God, some, under the stirring influence of\nthe meetings, are aroused to give who otherwise would do nothing.\nAs far as this class is concerned, good results have been realized.[410]\nBut under pressing calls many feel the deepest who have not had\ntheir hearts frozen up with selfishness. They have conscientiously\nkept their means flowing out to advance the cause of God. Their\nwhole being is stirred by the earnest appeals made, and the very\nones respond who may have given all that their circumstances in life\nwould justify.\nBut these liberal, wholehearted believers, prompted by a zealous\nlove for the cause and a desire to act promptly, judge themselves\ncapable of doing more than God requires them to do, for their use-\nfulness is crippled in other directions. These willing ones sometimes\npledge to raise money when they know not from what source it is\ncoming, and some are placed in distressing circumstances to meet\ntheir pledges. Some are obliged to sell their produce at great disad-\nvantage, and some have actually suffered for the conveniences and\nnecessities of life in order to meet their pledges.\nThere was a time at the commencement of our work when such\nsacrifice would have been justified, when God would have blessed\nall who thus ventured out to do for His cause. The friends of truth\nwere few and their means very limited. But the work has been\nwidening and strengthening until there is means enough in the hands\nof believers to amply sustain the work in all its departments without\nembarrassing any, if all would bear their proportional part. The cause\nof God need not be crippled in the slightest degree. The precious\ntruth has been made so plain that many have taken hold of it who\nhave in their hands means which God has entrusted to them to use in\nadvancing the interests of the truth. If these men of means do their\nduty, there need not be a pressure brought upon the poorer brethren.\nWe are in a world of plenty. If the gifts and offerings were\nproportionate to the means which each has received of God, there\nwould be no need of urgent calls for means at our large gatherings.\nI am fully convinced that it is not the best plan to bring a pressure\nupon the point of means at our camp meetings. Men and women\nSystematic Benevolence 385\nwho love the cause of God as they do their lives will pledge upon [411]\nthese occasions, when their families must suffer for the very means\nthat they have promised to give to advance the cause. Our God is\nnot a taskmaster and does not require the poor man to give means to\nthe cause that belongs to his family and that should be used to keep\nthem in comfort and above pinching want.\nThe calls for means at our large camp meetings have hitherto\nbeen attended with apparently good results so far as the wealthy are\nconcerned. But we fear the result of a continued effort to thus replen-\nish the treasury. We fear that there will be a reaction. Greater effort\nshould be put forth by responsible men in the different churches\nto have all follow the plan of God\u2019s arrangement. If systematic\nbenevolence is carried out, the urgent calls at the camp meetings for\nmeans for various enterprises will not be necessary.\nGod has devised a plan by which all may give as He has pros-\npered them, and which will make giving a habit without waiting for\nspecial calls. Those who can do this, but will not because of their\nselfishness, are robbing their Creator, who has bestowed upon them\nmeans to invest in His cause to advance its interests. Until all shall\ncarry out the plan of systematic benevolence, there will be a failure\nin coming up to the apostolic rule. Those who minister in word and\ndoctrine should be men of discrimination. They should, while they\nmake general appeals, become acquainted with the ability of those\nwho respond to their appeals, and should not allow the poor to pay\nlarge pledges. After a man has once consecrated a certain sum to\nthe Lord, he feels that it is sacred, consecrated to a holy use. This is\ntrue, and therefore our preaching brethren should be well informed\nof whom they accept pledges.\nEach member of the different families in our churches who be-\nlieves the truth may act a part in its advancement by cheerfully\nadopting systematic benevolence. \u201cLet every one of you lay by him\nin store [by himself at home], ... that there be no gatherings when\nI come.\u201d The burden of urging and pressing individuals to give of\ntheir means was not designed to be the work of God\u2019s ministers.\nThe responsibility should rest upon every individual who enjoys the [412]\nbelief of the truth. \u201cLet every one of you lay by him in store, as God\nhath prospered him.\u201d Every member of the family, from the oldest\ndown to the youngest, may take part in this work of benevolence.\n386 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nThe offerings of little children may be acceptable and pleasing to\nGod. In accordance with the spirit that prompts the gifts will be the\nvalue of the offering. The poor, by following the rule of the apostle\nand laying by a small sum every week, help to swell the treasury,\nand their gifts are wholly acceptable to God; for they make just as\ngreat, and even greater, sacrifices than their more wealthy brethren.\nThe plan of systematic benevolence will prove a safeguard to every\nfamily against temptations to spend means for needless things, and\nespecially will it prove a blessing to the rich by guarding them from\nindulging in extravagances.\nEvery week the demands of God upon each family are brought to\nmind by each of its members fully carrying out the plan; and as they\nhave denied themselves some superfluity in order to have means to\nput into the treasury, lessons of value in self-denial for the glory\nof God have been impressed upon the heart. Once a week each is\nbrought face to face with the doings of the past week\u2014the income\nthat he might have had if he had been economical and the means that\nhe does not have because of indulgence. His conscience is reined\nup, as it were, before God, and either commends or accuses him. He\nlearns that if he retains peace of mind and the favor of God he must\neat and drink and dress to His glory.\nSystematic and liberal giving in accordance with the plan keeps\nthe channel of the heart open. We place ourselves in connection with\nGod, that He may use us as channels through which His gifts may\nflow to others. The poor will not complain of systematic benevo-\nlence, for it touches them lightly. They are not neglected and passed\nby, but are favored with acting a part in being co-workers with Christ,\nand will receive the blessing of God as well as the wealthy. In the\nvery process of laying aside the littles as they can spare them they[413]\nare denying self and cultivating liberality of heart. They are educat-\ning themselves to good works, and are as effectually meeting the\ndesign of God in the plan of systematic benevolence as are the more\nwealthy who give of their abundance.\nIn the days of the apostles, men went everywhere preaching the\nword. New churches were raised up. Their love and zeal for Christ\nled them to acts of great denial and sacrifice. Many of these Gentile\nchurches were very poor, yet the apostle declares that their deep\npoverty abounded to the riches of their liberality. Their gifts were\nSystematic Benevolence 387\nextended beyond their ability to give. Men periled their lives and\nsuffered the loss of all things for the truth\u2019s sake.\nThe apostle suggests the first day of the week as a proper time to\nreview the course of Providence and the prosperity experienced, and\nin the fear of God, with true gratitude of heart for the blessings He\nhas bestowed, to decide how much, according to His own devised\nplan, shall be rendered back to Him.\nGod designs that the exercise of benevolence shall be purely\nvoluntary, not having recourse even to eloquent appeals to excite\nsympathy. \u201cGod loveth a cheerful giver.\u201d He is not pleased to have\nHis treasury replenished with forced supplies. The loyal hearts of\nHis people, rejoicing in the saving truth for this time, will, through\nlove and gratitude to Him for this precious light, be earnest and\nanxious to aid with their means in sending the truth to others. The\nvery best manner in which to give expression to our love for our\nRedeemer is to make offerings to bring souls to the knowledge of the\ntruth. The plan of redemption was entirely voluntary on the part of\nour Redeemer, and it is the purpose of Christ that all our benevolence\nshould be freewill offerings.\nChapter 35\u2014Individual Independence[414]\nDear Brother A,\nMy mind is exercised in regard to your case. I have written\nyou some things which have been shown me in regard to your past,\npresent, and future course. I feel anxious for you because I have seen\nyour dangers. Your former experience in spiritualism exposes you\nto temptations and severe conflicts. When once the mind has been\nyielded to the direct control of the enemy through evil angels, that\nperson should be very distrustful of impressions and feelings which\nwould lead him on an independent track, away from the church of\nChrist. The first step that such a one would take independently of the\nchurch should be regarded as a device of the enemy to deceive and\ndestroy. God has made His church a channel of light, and through\nit He communicates His purposes and His will. He does not give\none an experience independent of the church. He does not give one\nman a knowledge of His will for the entire church, while the church,\nChrist\u2019s body, is left in darkness.\nBrother A, you need to watch with the greatest care how you\nbuild. There is a storm coming which will test your hope to the ut-\nmost. You should dig deep and lay your foundation sure. \u201cTherefore\nwhosoever heareth these sayings of Mine, and doeth them, I will\nliken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and\nthe rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and\nbeat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.\u201d\nSteadily the builder places one stone upon another until the structure\nrises stone upon stone. The gospel builder frequently carries on his\nwork in tears and amid trials, storms of persecution, bitter opposi-\ntion, and unjust reproach; but he feels deeply in earnest, for he is\nbuilding for eternity. Be careful, Brother A, that your foundation is\nsolid rock, that you are riveted to it, Christ being that Rock.\nYou have a strong, set will, a very independent spirit, which you\nfeel that you must preserve at all hazards. And you have carried\nthis same spirit into your religious experience and life. You have\n388\nIndividual Independence 389\nnot always been in harmony with the work of God as carried on by [415]\nyour American brethren. You have not seen as they see nor been\nin union with their manner of proceeding. You have had very little\nacquaintance with the work in its different departments. You have\nnot felt very anxious to become acquainted with the various branches\nof the work. You have looked with suspicion and distrust upon the\nwork, and upon God\u2019s chosen leaders to carry it forward. You have\nbeen more ready to question and surmise and be jealous of those\nupon whom God has laid the heavier responsibilities of His work,\nthan to investigate and to so connect yourself with the cause of God\nas to become acquainted with its workings and advancement.\nGod saw that you were not fitted to be a shepherd, a minister of\nrighteousness to proclaim the truth to others, until you should be\na thoroughly transformed man. He permitted you to pass through\nreal trials and feel privation and want, that you might know how to\nexercise pity and sympathy, and tender love for the unfortunate and\noppressed, and for those borne down with want and passing through\ntrial and affliction.\nWhile you prayed in your affliction for peace in Christ, a cloud\nof darkness seemed to blacken across your mind. The rest and peace\ndid not come as you expected. At times your faith seemed to be\ntested to the utmost. As you looked back to your past life, you\nsaw sorrow and disappointment; as you viewed the future, all was\nuncertainty. The divine Hand led you wondrously to bring you to\nthe cross and to teach you that God was indeed a rewarder of those\nwho diligently seek Him. Those who ask aright will receive. He\nthat seeketh in faith shall find. The experience gained in the furnace\nof trial and affliction is worth more than all the inconvenience and\npainful experience it costs.\nThe prayers that you offered in your loneliness, in your weariness\nand trial, God answered, not always according to your expectations,\nbut for your good. You did not have clear and correct views of your\nbrethren, neither did you see yourself in a correct light. But, in\nthe providence of God, He has been at work to answer the prayers [416]\nyou have offered in your distress, in a way to save you and glorify\nHis own name. In your ignorance of yourself you asked for things\nwhich were not best for you. God heard your prayers of sincerity,\nbut the blessing granted was something very different from your\n390 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nexpectations. God designed, in His providence, to place you more\ndirectly in connection with His church, that your confidence might\nbe less in yourself and greater in others whom He is leading out to\nadvance His work.\nGod hears every sincere prayer. He would place you in connec-\ntion with His work that He might bring you more directly to the\nlight. And unless you should seal your vision against evidence and\nlight you would be persuaded that if you were more distrustful of\nyourself and less distrustful of your brethren you would be more\nprosperous in God. It is God who has led you through strait places.\nHe had a purpose in this, that tribulation might work in you patience,\nand patience experience, and experience hope. He permitted trials\nto come upon you, that, through them, you might experience the\npeaceable fruits of righteousness.\nPeter denied the Man of Sorrows in His acquaintance with grief\nin the hour of His humiliation. But he afterward repented and was\nreconverted. He had true contrition of soul and gave himself afresh\nto his Saviour. With blinding tears he makes his way to the solitudes\nof the Garden of Gethsemane and there prostrates himself where he\nsaw his Saviour\u2019s prostrate form when the bloody sweat was forced\nfrom His pores by His great agony. Peter remembers with remorse\nthat he was asleep when Jesus prayed during those fearful hours. His\nproud heart breaks, and penitential tears moisten the sods so recently\nstained with the bloody sweat drops of God\u2019s dear Son. He left that\ngarden a converted man. He was ready then to pity the tempted. He\nwas humbled and could sympathize with the weak and erring. He\ncould caution and warn the presumptuous, and was fully fitted to\nstrengthen his brethren.\nGod led you through affliction and trials that you might have[417]\nmore perfect trust and confidence in Him, and that you might think\nless of your own judgment. You can bear adversity better than pros-\nperity. The all-seeing eye of Jehovah detected in you much dross\nthat you considered gold and too valuable to throw away. The en-\nemy\u2019s power over you had at times been direct and very strong. The\ndelusions of spiritualism had entangled your faith, perverted your\njudgment, and confused your experience. God in His providence\nwould try you, to purify you, as the sons of Levi, that you might\noffer to Him an offering in righteousness.\nIndividual Independence 391\nSelf is mingled too much with all your labors. Your will must be\nmolded by God\u2019s will, or you will fall into grievous temptations. I\nsaw that when you labor in God, putting self out of sight, you will\nrealize a strength from Him which will give you access to hearts.\nAngels of God will work with your efforts when you are humble and\nlittle in your own eyes. But when you think you know more than\nthose whom God has been leading for years, and whom He has been\ninstructing in the truth and fitting for the extension of His work, you\nare self-exalted and will fall into temptations.\nYou need to cultivate kindness and tenderness. You need to\nbe pitiful and courteous. Your labors savor too much of severity\nand an exacting, dictatorial, overbearing spirit. You are not always\nkindly considerate of the feelings of others, and you create trials\nand dissatisfaction needlessly. More love in your labors, and more\nkindly sympathy, would give you access to hearts and would win\nsouls to Christ and the truth.\nYou are constantly inclined to individual independence. You\ndo not realize that independence is a poor thing when it leads you\nto have too much confidence in yourself and to trust to your own\njudgment rather than to respect the counsel and highly estimate the\njudgment of your brethren, especially of those in the offices which\nGod has appointed for the saving of His people. God has invested\nHis church with special authority and power which no one can be\njustified in disregarding and despising, for in so doing he despises\nthe voice of God.\nIt is not safe for you to trust to impressions and feelings. It [418]\nhas been your misfortune to come under the power of that satanic\ndelusion, spiritualism. This pall of death has covered you, and your\nimagination and nerves have been under the control of demons; and\nwhen you become self-confident and do not cling with unwaver-\ning confidence to God you are in positive danger. You may, and\nfrequently do, let down the bars and invite the enemy in, and he\ncontrols your thoughts and actions, while you are really deceived\nand flatter yourself that you are in favor with God.\nSatan has tried to prevent you from having confidence in your\nAmerican brethren. You have regarded them and their moves and\nexperience with suspicion, when they are the very ones who could\nhelp you and would be a blessing to you. It will be Satan\u2019s stud-\n392 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nied effort to separate you from those who are as channels of light,\nthrough whom God has communicated His will and through whom\nHe has wrought in building up and extending His work. Your views\nand your feelings and experience are altogether too narrow, and your\nlabors are of the same character.\nIn order to be a blessing to your people, you need to improve\nin many things. You should cultivate courtesy and cherish a tender\nsympathy for all. You should have the crowning grace of God, which\nis love. You criticize too much and are not so forbearing as you must\nbe if you would win souls. You could have much more influence if\nyou were less formal and rigid, and were actuated more by the Holy\nSpirit. Your fear of being led by men is too great. God uses men as\nHis instruments and will use them as long as the world shall stand.\nThe angels who fell were anxious to become independent of God.\nThey were very beautiful, very glorious, but dependent on God for\ntheir happiness and for the light and intelligence they enjoyed. They\nfell from their high estate through insubordination. Christ and His\nchurch are inseparable. To neglect or despise those whom God has\nappointed to lead out and to bear the responsibilities connected with\nHis work and with the advancement and spread of the truth is to reject\nthe means which God has ordained for the help, encouragement, and[419]\nstrength of His people. To pass these by and think your light must\ncome through no other channel than directly from God places you in\na position where you are liable to deception and to be overthrown.\nGod has placed you in connection with His appointed helps in\nHis church that you may be aided by them. Your former connection\nwith spiritualism makes your danger greater than it otherwise would\nbe, because your judgment, wisdom, and discrimination have been\nperverted. You cannot of yourself always tell or discern the spirits;\nfor Satan is very wily. God has placed you in connection with His\nchurch that they may help you.\nYou are sometimes too formal, cold, and unsympathizing. You\nmust meet the people where they are, and not place yourself too\nfar above them and require too much of them. You need to be all\nsoftened and subdued by the Spirit of God while you preach to\nthe people. You should educate yourself as to the best manner of\nlaboring to secure the desired end. Your labor must be characterized\nIndividual Independence 393\nby the love of Jesus abounding in your heart, softening your words,\nmolding your temperament, and elevating your soul.\nYou frequently talk too long when you do not have the vitalizing\ninfluence of the Spirit of heaven. You weary those who hear you.\nMany make a mistake in their preaching in not stopping while the\ninterest is up. They go on speechifying until the interest that had\nrisen in the minds of the hearers dies out and the people are really\nwearied with words of no special weight or interest. Stop before\nyou get there. Stop when you have nothing of special importance\nto say. Do not go on with dry words that only excite prejudice and\ndo not soften the heart. You want to be so united to Christ that your\nwords will melt and burn their way to the soul. Mere prosy talk is\ninsufficient for this time. Arguments are good, but there may be too\nmuch of the argumentative and too little of the spirit and life of God.\nWithout the special power of God to work with your efforts, your [420]\nspirit subdued and humbled in God, your heart softened, your words\nflowing from a heart of love, your labors will be wearing to yourself\nand not productive of blessed results. There is a point which the\nminister of Christ reaches, beyond which human knowledge and\nskill are powerless. We are struggling with giant errors, and evils\nwhich we are impotent to remedy or to arouse the people to see and\nunderstand, for we cannot change the heart. We cannot quicken the\nsoul to discern the sinfulness of sin and to feel the need of a Saviour.\nBut if our labors bear the impress of the Spirit of God, if a higher, a\ndivine power attends our efforts to sow the gospel seed, we shall see\nfruits of our labor to the glory of God. He alone can water the seed\nsown.\nThus with you, Brother A. You must not get in too great a hurry\nand expect too much of darkened minds. You must cherish humble\nhope that God will graciously impart the mysterious, quickening\ninfluence of His Spirit, by which alone your labors will not be in\nvain in the Lord. You need to cling to God by living faith, every\nmoment realizing your dangers and your weakness, and constantly\nseeking that strength and power which God alone can give. Try the\nbest you may, of yourself you can do nothing.\nYou need to educate yourself, that you may have wisdom to\ndeal with minds. You should with some have compassion, making a\ndifference, while others you may save with fear, pulling them out of\n394 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthe fire. Our heavenly Father frequently leaves us in uncertainty in\nregard to our efforts. We are to sow beside all waters, not knowing\nwhich shall prosper, this or that. We may stimulate our faith and\nenergy from the Source of our strength, and lean with full and entire\ndependence upon Him.\nBrother A, you need to work with the utmost diligence to con-\ntrol self and develop a character in harmony with the principles\nof the word of God. You need to educate and train yourself in\norder to become a successful shepherd. You need to cultivate a\ngood temper\u2014kindly, cheerful, buoyant, generous, pitiful, cour-[421]\nteous, compassionate traits of character. You should overcome a\nmorose, bigoted, narrow, faultfinding, overbearing spirit. If you are\nconnected with the work of God you need to battle with yourself\nvigorously and form your character after the divine Model.\nWithout constant effort on your part some development, under\nthe influence of a corrupt mind, will appear and block up your way,\nwhich hindrance you will be inclined to charge to some other than\nthe true cause. You need self-discipline. Our piety should not appear\nsour, cold, and morose; but lovable and teachable. A censorious\nspirit will hedge up your way and close hearts against you. If not\nhumbly dependent on God, you will frequently close your own path\nwith obstacles and charge the same to the course of others.\nYou need to stand guard over yourself, that you do not teach the\ntruth or perform duties in a bigoted spirit that will excite prejudice.\nYou need to study how you may show yourself approved unto God,\na workman that needeth not to be ashamed. Inquire of yourself what\nyour natural disposition is, what character you have developed. It\nshould be your study, as well as that of every minister of Christ, to\nexercise the greatest watchfulness that you do not cherish habits of\naction, or mental and moral tendencies, which you would not wish\nto see appear among those whom you bring out upon the truth.\nMinisters of Christ are enjoined to be examples to the flock of\nGod. The influence of a minister can do much toward molding the\ncharacter of his people. If the minister is indolent, if he is not pure\nin heart and life, and if he is sharp, critical, and faultfinding, self-\nish, independent, and lacking self-control, he will have these same\nunpleasant elements in a large degree to meet and deal with among\nhis people, and it is hard work to set things in order where wrong\nIndividual Independence 395\ninfluences have made confusion. What is seen in their minister will\nmake a great difference in regard to the development of Christian\nvirtue in the people. If his life is a combination of excellences, those\nwhom he brings to the knowledge of the truth through his labors [422]\nwill, to a great degree, if they truly love God, reflect his example\nand influence, for he is a representative of Christ. Thus the minis-\nter should feel his responsibility to adorn the doctrine of God our\nSaviour in all things.\nThe highest efforts of the gospel minister should be to devote all\nhis talents to the work of saving souls; then he will be successful.\nWise and watchful discipline is necessary for everyone who names\nthe name of Christ; but in a much higher sense is it essential for\na gospel minister, who is a representative of Christ. Our Saviour\nawed men by His purity and elevated morality, while His love and\ngentle benignity inspired them with enthusiasm. The poorest and\nhumblest were not afraid to approach Him; even little children were\nattracted to Him. They loved to climb upon His lap and to kiss that\npensive face, benignant with love. This loving tenderness you need.\nYou should cultivate love. Expressions of sympathy and acts of\ncourtesy and respect for others would not detract from your dignity\none particle, but would open to you many hearts that are now closed\nagainst you.\nChrist was just what every minister should strive to be. We\nshould learn to imitate His character and combine strict justice, pu-\nrity, integrity, love, and noble generosity. A pleasant face in which\nlove is reflected, with kind and courteous manners, will do more,\naside from pulpit efforts, than labor in the desk can do without these.\nIt becomes us to cultivate a deference to other people\u2019s judgment,\nwhen, to a greater or less extent, we are absolutely dependent upon\nthem. We should cultivate true Christian courtesy and tender sym-\npathy, even for the roughest, hardest cases of humanity. Jesus came\nfrom the pure courts of heaven to save just such. You close your\nheart too readily to many who have apparently no interest in the\nmessage you bear, but who are still subjects of grace and precious in\nthe sight of the Lord. \u201cHe that winneth souls is wise.\u201d Paul became\nall things to all men if by any means he might save some. You must\nbe in a similar position. You must bend from your independence.\nYou lack humbleness of mind. You need the softening influence of\n396 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthe grace of God upon your heart, that you may not irritate, but melt[423]\nyour way to the hearts of men, although these hearts may be affected\nby prejudice.\nThe cause of God is in great need of earnest men, men who\nabound in zeal, hope, faith, and courage. It is not self-willed men\nwho can meet the demands for this time, but men who are in earnest.\nWe have too many sensitive ministers who are feeble in experience,\ndeficient in the Christian graces, lacking in consecration, and are\neasily discouraged; who are earnest to gratify their own wills and are\npersevering in their efforts to accomplish their own selfish purposes.\nSuch men will not fill the demands for this time. We need men in\nthese last days who are ever awake. Minutemen are wanted who are\nsincere in their love for the truth and willing to labor at a sacrifice if\nthey can advance the cause of God and save precious souls. Men are\nwanted in this work who will not murmur or complain at hardships\nor trials, knowing that this is a part of the legacy that Jesus has left\nthem. They should be willing to go without the camp and suffer\nreproach and bear burdens as good soldiers of Christ. They will\nbear the cross of Christ without complaint, without murmuring or\nfretfulness, and will be patient in tribulation.\nThe solemn, testing truth for these last days is committed to\nus, and we should make it a reality. Brother A, you should avoid\nmaking yourself a criterion. Avoid, I entreat you, appealing to your\nown sympathies. All that we can suffer, and all that we may ever\nbe called to suffer, for the truth\u2019s sake will seem too small to be\ncompared with what our Saviour endured for us sinners. You need\nnot expect always to be correctly judged or correctly represented.\nChrist says that in the world we shall have tribulation, but in Him\nwe shall have peace.\nYou have cultivated a combative spirit. When your track is\ncrossed, you immediately throw yourself into a defensive position;\nand, although you may be among your brethren who love the truth\nand have given their lives to the cause of God, you will justify\nyourself, while you criticize them and become jealous of their words[424]\nand suspicious of their motives, and thus lose great blessings that it\nis your privilege to gain through the experience of your brethren.\nIndividual Independence 397\nDiscussions to be Avoided\nYou have loved to debate the truth and loved discussions; but\nthese contests have been unfavorable to your forming a harmonious\nChristian character, for in this is a favorable opportunity for the\nexhibition of the very traits of character that you must overcome\nif you ever enter heaven. Discussions cannot always be avoided.\nIn some cases the circumstances are such that of the two evils the\nchoice must be made of the least, which is discussion. But whenever\nthey can be avoided, they should be, for the result is seldom honoring\nto God.\nPeople who love to see opponents combat, may clamor for dis-\ncussion. Others, who have a desire to hear the evidences on both\nsides, may urge discussion in all honesty of motive; but when-\never discussions can be avoided, they should be. They generally\nstrengthen combativeness and weaken that pure love and sacred sym-\npathy which should ever exist in the hearts of Christians although\nthey may differ in opinions.\nDiscussions in this age of the world are not real evidences of\nearnest desire on the part of the people to investigate the truth, but\ncome through the love of novelty and the excitement which generally\nattends discussions. God is seldom glorified or the truth advanced in\nthese combats. Truth is too solemn, too momentous in its results, to\nmake it a small matter whether it is received or rejected. To discuss\ntruth for the sake of showing opponents the skill of the combatants\nis ever poor policy, for it does but very little to advance the truth.\nOpponents to the truth will show skill in misstating their oppo-\nnent. They will make the most solemn, sacred truths the subject\nof ridicule. They will generally sport and deride precious, sacred\ntruth, and place it in so false a light before the people that minds\nthat are darkened by error and polluted by sin do not discern the [425]\nmotives and objects of these designing men in thus covering up and\nfalsifying precious and important truth. Because of the men who\nengage in them, there are but few discussions that it is possible to\nconduct upon right principles. Sharp thrusts are too frequently given\nby both parties, personalities are indulged in, and frequently both\nparties descend to sarcasm and witticism. The love of souls is lost\n398 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nin the greater desire for the mastery. Prejudice, deep and bitter, is\noften the result of discussions.\nI have beheld angels grieved as the most precious jewels of truth\nhave been brought before men utterly incapable of appreciating the\nevidences in favor of the truth. Their entire being was at war with the\nprinciples of truth; their natures were at enmity with it. Their object\nin discussing was not that they might get hold of the evidences of the\ntruth themselves or that the people might have a fair understanding\nof our true position, but that they might confuse the understanding\nby placing the truth in a perverted light before the people. There\nare men who have educated themselves as combatants. It is their\npolicy to misstate an opponent and to cover up clear arguments with\ndishonest quibbles. They have devoted their God-given powers to\nthis dishonest work, for there is nothing in their hearts in harmony\nwith the pure principles of truth. They seize any argument they\ncan get with which to tear down the advocates of truth, when they\nthemselves do not believe the things they urge against them. They\nbolster themselves up in their chosen position, irrespective of justice\nand truth. They do not consider that before them is the judgment,\nand that then their ill-gotten triumph, with all its disastrous results,\nwill appear in its true character. Error, with all its deceptive policies,\nits windings and twistings and turnings to change the truth into a lie,\nwill then appear in all its deformity. No victory will stand in the day\nof God, except that which truth, pure, elevated, sacred truth, shall\nwin to the glory of God.\nAngels weep to see the precious truth of heavenly origin cast\nbefore swine, to be seized by them and trampled with the mire and[426]\ndirt. Cast not \u201cyour pearls before swine, lest they trample them\nunder their feet, and turn again and rend you.\u201d These are the words\nof the world\u2019s Redeemer.\nGod\u2019s ministers should not count the opportunity of engaging\nin discussion a great privilege. All points of our faith are not to be\nborne to the front and presented before the prejudiced crowds. Jesus\nspoke before the Pharisees and Sadducees in parables, hiding the\nclearness of truth under symbols and figures because they would\nmake a wrong use of the truths He presented before them; but to His\ndisciples He spoke plainly. We should learn from Christ\u2019s method\nof teaching and be careful not to cut off the ears of the people by\nIndividual Independence 399\npresenting truths which, not being fully explained, they are in no\nway prepared to receive.\nThe truths that we hold in common should be dwelt upon first\nand the confidence of the hearers obtained; then, as the people can\nbe brought along, we can advance slowly with the matter presented.\nGreat wisdom is needed to present unpopular truth before a preju-\ndiced people in the most cautious manner, that access may be gained\nto their hearts. Discussions place before the people, who are unen-\nlightened in regard to our position and who are ignorant of Bible\ntruth, a set of arguments skillfully gotten up and carefully arranged\nto cover over the clear points of truth. Some men have made it their\nbusiness to cover up plain statements of facts in the word of God\nby their deceptive theories, which they make plausible to those who\nhave not investigated for themselves.\nThese agents of Satan are hard to meet, and it is difficult to\nhave patience with them. But calmness, patience, and self-control\nare elements which every minister of Christ should cultivate. The\ncombatants of the truth have educated themselves for intellectual\nbattle. They are prepared to present on the surface sophistry and\nassertions as the word of God. They confuse unsuspecting minds\nand place the truth in obscurity, while pleasing fables are presented\nto the people in the place of pure Bible truth.\nMany choose darkness rather than light because their deeds are [427]\nevil. But there are those who, if the truth could have been presented\nin a different manner, under different circumstances, giving them a\nfair chance to weigh the arguments for themselves and to compare\nscripture with scripture, would have been charmed by its clearness\nand would have taken hold upon it.\nIt has been very indiscreet for our ministers to publish to the\nworld the wily sophistry of error, furnished by designing men to\ncover up and make of none effect the solemn, sacred truth of Jeho-\nvah. These crafty men who lie in wait to deceive the unwary give\ntheir strength of intellect to perverting the word of God. The inex-\nperienced and unsuspecting are deceived to their ruin. It has been\na great error to publish to all the arguments wherewith opponents\nbattle the truth of God, for in so doing minds of every class are\nfurnished with arguments which many of them had never thought\nof. Someone must render an account for this unwise generalship.\n400 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nArguments against the sacred truth, subtle in their influence,\naffect minds that are not well informed in regard to the strength\nof the truth. The moral sensibilities of the community at large are\nblunted by familiarity with sin. Selfishness, dishonesty, and the\nvaried sins which prevail in this degenerate age have blunted the\nsenses to eternal things so that God\u2019s truth is not discerned. In giving\npublicity to the erroneous arguments of our opponents, truth and\nerror are placed upon a level in their minds, when, if they could\nhave the truth before them in its clearness long enough to see and\nrealize its sacredness and importance, they would be convinced of\nthe strong arguments in its favor and would then be prepared to meet\nthe arguments urged by opposers.\nThose who are seeking to know the truth and to understand\nthe will of God, who are faithful to the light and zealous in the\nperformance of their daily duties, will surely know of the doctrine,\nfor they will be guided into all truth. God does not promise, by\nthe masterly acts of His providence, to irresistibly bring men to the[428]\nknowledge of His truth, when they do not seek for truth and have no\ndesire to know the truth. Men have the power to quench the Spirit\nof God; the power of choosing is left with them. They are allowed\nfreedom of action. They may be obedient through the name and\ngrace of our Redeemer, or they may be disobedient, and realize the\nconsequences. Man is responsible for receiving or rejecting sacred\nand eternal truth. The Spirit of God is continually convicting, and\nsouls are deciding for or against the truth. The deportment, the\nwords, the actions, of the minister of Christ may balance a soul for\nor against the truth. How important that every act of the life be such\nthat it need not be repented of. Especially is this important among\nthe ambassadors of Christ, who are acting in the place of Christ.\nThe Authority of the Church\nThe world\u2019s Redeemer has invested great power with His church.\nHe states the rules to be applied in cases of trial with its members.\nAfter He has given explicit directions as to the course to be pursued,\nHe says: \u201cVerily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth\nshall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever [in church discipline]\nye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\u201d Thus even the\nIndividual Independence 401\nheavenly authority ratifies the discipline of the church in regard to\nits members when the Bible rule has been followed.\nThe word of God does not give license for one man to set up his\njudgment in opposition to the judgment of the church, neither is he\nallowed to urge his opinions against the opinions of the church. If\nthere were no church discipline and government, the church would\ngo to fragments; it could not hold together as a body. There have\never been individuals of independent minds who have claimed that\nthey were right, that God had especially taught, impressed, and led\nthem. Each has a theory of his own, views peculiar to himself, and\neach claims that his views are in accordance with the word of God.\nEach one has a different theory and faith, yet each claims special\nlight from God. These draw away from the body, and each one is [429]\na separate church of himself. All these cannot be right, yet they all\nclaim to be led of the Lord. The word of Inspiration is not Yea and\nNay, but Yea and Amen in Christ Jesus.\nOur Saviour follows His lessons of instruction with a promise\nthat if two or three should be united in asking anything of God it\nshould be given them. Christ here shows that there must be union\nwith others, even in our desires for a given object. Great importance\nis attached to the united prayer, the union of purpose. God hears\nthe prayers of individuals, but on this occasion Jesus was giving\nespecial and important lessons that were to have a special bearing\nupon His newly organized church on the earth. There must be an\nagreement in the things which they desire and for which they pray.\nIt was not merely the thoughts and exercises of one mind, liable to\ndeception; but the petition was to be the earnest desire of several\nminds centered on the same point.\nIn the wonderful conversion of Paul we see the miraculous power\nof God. A brightness above the glory of the midday sun shone round\nabout him. Jesus, whose name of all others he most hated and\ndespised, revealed Himself to Paul for the purpose of arresting his\nmad yet honest career, that He might make this most unpromising\ninstrument a chosen vessel to bear the gospel to the Gentiles. He\nhad conscientiously done many things contrary to the name of Jesus\nof Nazareth. In his zeal he was a persevering, earnest persecutor of\nthe church of Christ. His convictions of his duty to exterminate this\n402 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nalarming doctrine, which was prevailing everywhere, that Jesus was\nthe Prince of life were deep and strong.\nPaul verily believed that faith in Jesus made of none effect the\nlaw of God, the religious service of sacrificial offerings, and the rite\nof circumcision, which had in all past ages received the full sanction\nof God. But the miraculous revelation of Christ brings light into the\ndarkened chambers of his mind. The Jesus of Nazareth whom he is\narrayed against is indeed the Redeemer of the world.\nPaul sees his mistaken zeal and cries out: \u201cLord, what wilt[430]\nThou have me to do?\u201d Jesus did not then and there tell him, as He\nmight have done, the work that He had assigned him. Paul must\nreceive instruction in the Christian faith and move understandingly.\nChrist sends him to the very disciples whom he had been so bitterly\npersecuting, to learn of them. The light of heavenly illumination had\ntaken away Paul\u2019s eyesight; but Jesus, the Great Healer of the blind,\ndoes not restore it. He answers the question of Paul in these words:\nArise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must\ndo.\u201d Jesus could not only have healed Paul of his blindness, but He\ncould have forgiven his sins and told him his duty by marking out\nhis future course. From Christ all power and mercies were to flow;\nbut He did not give Paul an experience, in his conversion to truth,\nindependent of His church recently organized upon the earth.\nThe marvelous light given Paul upon that occasion astonished\nand confounded him. He was wholly subdued. This part of the\nwork man could not do for Paul, but there was a work still to be\naccomplished which the servants of Christ could do. Jesus directs\nhim to His agents in the church for a further knowledge of duty. Thus\nHe gives authority and sanction to His organized church. Christ had\ndone the work of revelation and conviction, and now Paul was in\na condition to learn of those whom God had ordained to teach the\ntruth. Christ directs Paul to His chosen servants, thus placing him in\nconnection with His church.\nThe very men whom Paul was purposing to destroy were to be his\ninstructors in the very religion that he had despised and persecuted.\nHe passed three days without food or sight, making his way to the\nmen whom, in his blind zeal, he was purposing to destroy. Here\nJesus places Paul in connection with his representatives upon the\nIndividual Independence 403\nearth. The Lord gave Ananias a vision to go up to a certain house in\nDamascus and call for Saul of Tarsus; \u201cfor, behold, he prayeth.\u201d\nAfter Saul was directed to go to Damascus, he was led by the [431]\nmen who accompanied him to help him bring the disciples bound\nto Jerusalem to be tried and put to death. Saul tarried with Judas at\nDamascus, devoting the time to fasting and prayer. Here the faith of\nSaul was tested. Three days he was in darkness of mind in regard\nto what was required of him, and three days he was without sight.\nHe had been directed to go to Damascus, for it should there be told\nhim what he should do. He is in uncertainty, and he cries earnestly\nto God. An angel is sent to Ananias, directing him to go to a certain\nhouse where Saul is praying to be instructed in what he is to do next.\nSaul\u2019s pride is gone. A little before he was self-confident, thinking\nhe was engaged in a good work for which he should receive a reward;\nbut all is now changed. He is bowed down and humbled to the dust\nin penitence and shame, and his supplications are fervent for pardon.\nSaid the Lord, through His angel, to Ananias: \u201cBehold, he prayeth.\u201d\nThe angel informed the servant of God that he had revealed to Saul\nin vision a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hand on\nhim that he might receive his sight. Ananias can scarcely credit the\nwords of the angel, and repeats what he has heard of Saul\u2019s bitter\npersecution of the saints at Jerusalem. But the command to Ananias\nis imperative: \u201cGo thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto Me, to\nbear My name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of\nIsrael.\u201d\nAnanias was obedient to the direction of the angel. He laid his\nhands upon the man who so recently was exercised with a spirit\nof the deepest hatred, breathing out threatenings against all who\nbelieved on the name of Christ. Ananias said to Saul: \u201cBrother Saul,\nthe Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou\ncamest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be\nfilled with the Holy Ghost. And immediately there fell from his eyes\nas it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and\nwas baptized.\u201d\nJesus might have done all this work for Paul directly, but this [432]\nwas not His plan. Paul had something to do in the line of confession\nto the men whose destruction he had premeditated, and God had a\nresponsible work for the men to do whom He had ordained to act\n404 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nin His stead. Paul was to take those steps necessary in conversion.\nHe was required to unite himself to the very people whom he had\npersecuted for their religion. Christ here gives all His people an\nexample of the manner of His working for the salvation of men. The\nSon of God identified Himself with the office and authority of His\norganized church. His blessings were to come through the agencies\nthat He has ordained, thus connecting man with the channel through\nwhich His blessings come. Paul\u2019s being strictly conscientious in his\nwork of persecuting the saints does not make him guiltless when the\nknowledge of his cruel work is impressed upon him by the Spirit of\nGod. He is to become a learner of the disciples.\nHe learns that Jesus, whom in his blindness he considered an\nimpostor, is indeed the author and foundation of all the religion\nof God\u2019s chosen people from Adam\u2019s day, and the finisher of the\nfaith, now so clear to his enlightened vision. He saw Christ as the\nvindicator of truth, the fulfiller of all prophecies. Christ had been\nregarded as making of none effect the law of God; but when his\nspiritual vision was touched by the finger of God, he learned of the\ndisciples that Christ was the originator and the foundation of the\nentire Jewish system of sacrifices, that in the death of Christ type\nmet antitype, and that Christ came into the world for the express\npurpose of vindicating His Father\u2019s law.\nIn the light of the law, Paul sees himself a sinner. That very law\nwhich he thought he had been keeping so zealously he finds he has\nbeen transgressing. He repents and dies to sin, becomes obedient\nto the claims of God\u2019s law, and has faith in Christ as his Saviour, is\nbaptized, and preaches Jesus as earnestly and zealously as he once\ncondemned Him. In the conversion of Paul are given us important\nprinciples which we should ever bear in mind. The Redeemer of the\nworld does not sanction experience and exercise in religious matters\nindependent of His organized and acknowledged church, where He[433]\nhas a church.\nMany have the idea that they are responsible to Christ alone\nfor their light and experience, independent of His acknowledged\nfollowers in the world. But this is condemned by Jesus in His\nteachings and in the examples, the facts, which He has given for\nour instruction. Here was Paul, one whom Christ was to fit for a\nmost important work, one who was to be a chosen vessel unto Him,\nIndividual Independence 405\nbrought directly into the presence of Christ; yet He does not teach\nhim the lessons of truth. He arrests his course and convicts him; and\nwhen he asks, \u201cWhat wilt Thou have me to do?\u201d the Saviour does\nnot tell him directly, but places him in connection with His church.\nThey will tell thee what thou must do. Jesus is the sinner\u2019s friend,\nHis heart is ever open, ever touched with human woe; He has all\npower, both in heaven and upon earth; but He respects the means\nwhich He has ordained for the enlightenment and salvation of men.\nHe directs Saul to the church, thus acknowledging the power that\nHe has invested in it as a channel of light to the world. It is Christ\u2019s\norganized body upon the earth, and respect is required to be paid\nto His ordinances. In the case of Saul, Ananias represents Christ,\nand he also represents Christ\u2019s ministers upon the earth who are\nappointed to act in Christ\u2019s stead.\nSaul was a learned teacher in Israel; but while he is under the\ninfluence of blind error and prejudice, Christ reveals Himself to him,\nand then places him in communication with His church, who are\nthe light of the world. They are to instruct this educated, popular\norator, in the Christian religion. In Christ\u2019s stead Ananias touches\nhis eyes that they may receive sight; in Christ\u2019s stead he lays his\nhands upon him, prays in Christ\u2019s name, and Saul receives the Holy\nGhost. All is done in the name and authority of Christ. Christ is\nthe fountain. The church is the channel of communication. Those\nwho boast of personal independence need to be brought into closer\nrelation to Christ by connection with His church upon the earth.\nBrother A, God loves you and desires to save you and bring you [434]\ninto working order. If you will be humble and teachable, and will be\nmolded by His Spirit, He will be your strength, your righteousness,\nand your exceeding great reward. You may accomplish much for\nyour brethren if you will hide in God and let His Spirit soften your\nspirit. You have a hard class to meet. They are filled with bitter\nprejudice, but no more so than was Saul. God can work mightily\nfor your brethren if you do not allow yourself to get in the way and\nhedge up your own path. Let melting love, pity, and tenderness\ndwell in your heart while you labor. You may break down the iron\nwalls of prejudice if you only cling to Christ and are ready to be\ncounseled by your more experienced brethren.\n406 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nYou must not, as God\u2019s servant, be too easily discouraged by\ndifficulties or by the fiercest opposition. Go forth, not in your own\nname, but in the might and power of Israel\u2019s God. Endure hardness as\na good soldier of the cross of Christ. Jesus endured the contradiction\nof sinners against Himself. Consider the life of Christ and take\ncourage, and press on in faith, courage, and hope.\n* * * * *\nChapter 36\u2014Unity in the Church\nIn my last vision I was shown the introduction of the truth, and\nthe progress of the cause of God, upon the Pacific Coast. I saw that\ngood work had been wrought for many in California, but that there\nwere many who professed the truth who were not ready to take hold\nof the work of God at the right time and to move as the opening\nprovidence of God indicates their duty. A great work may be done\non this coast in bringing souls to the knowledge of the truth if there\nis united action.\nIf all who have influence felt the necessity of co-operation and\nwould seek to answer the prayer of Christ, that they may be one\nas He is one with the Father, the cause of present truth would be a\npower upon this coast. But the people of God are asleep, and do [435]\nnot see the wants of the cause for this time. They do not feel the\nimportance of concentrated action. Satan is ever seeking to divide\nthe faith and hearts of God\u2019s people. He well knows that union\nis their strength, and division their weakness. It is important and\nessential that all of Christ\u2019s followers understand Satan\u2019s devices\nand with a united front meet his attacks and vanquish him. They\nneed to make continual efforts to press together even if it be at some\nsacrifice to themselves.\nThe people of God, with various temperaments and organiza-\ntions, are brought together in church capacity. The truth of God,\nreceived into the heart, will do its work of refining, elevating, and\nsanctifying the life and overcoming the peculiar views and prejudices\nof each. All should labor to come as near to one another as possible.\nAll who love God and keep His commandments in truth will have\ninfluence with unbelievers and will win souls to Christ, to swell\nthe glad songs of triumph and victory before the great white throne.\nSelfishness will be overcome, and overflowing love for Christ will\nbe manifested in the burden they feel to save souls for whom He\ndied.\n407\n408 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nI was shown many families who are not living as Jesus would\nhave them; they have a work to do at home before they can make\nadvancement in the divine life. I was shown the case of Brother\nB and was pointed back to the time when he first accepted the\ntruth. It then had a transforming influence upon his life. Self was\nin a measure lost in the interest he felt for the truth. He sought to\nshow his faith by his works, and his personal interests were made\nsecondary. He loved the work of the Lord and cheerfully sought to\nadvance the interest of His cause; the Lord accepted his efforts to\nserve Him, and the hand of the Lord prospered him.\nI was shown that Brother B displeased God and brought great\ndarkness upon himself when he set up his judgment in opposition to\nthat of his brethren in regard to the true way to observe the Sabbath.\nBrother B\u2019s interest was at stake, and he refused to see the correct\nbearing of the question under consideration. He never would have[436]\ntaken the course he did when he returned from the East, if he had\nbeen in the light. I was then carried to another point in his history\nand saw him journeying. While among unbelievers he did not let his\nlight so shine before men that they by seeing his good works would\nglorify our Father which is in heaven. He was forgetful of God and\nof his duty to rightly represent his Saviour in every place and upon\nall occasions.\nBrother B is especially weak upon some points; he loves praise\nand flattery; he loves pleasure and distinction. He exalted himself\nand talked much and prayed little, and God left him to his own\nweakness; for he did not bear fruit to the glory of God. On that\njourney he had an opportunity to do a great amount of good, but he\ndid not realize that he was accountable to God for his talents and\nthat as a steward of God he would be called to an account whether\nhe had used his ability to please himself or to glorify God. If Brother\nB had felt the power of the love of Christ in his own heart, he would\nhave felt an interest for the salvation of those with whom he was\nbrought in contact, that he might speak to them words which would\ncause them to reflect in regard to their eternal interest.\nHe had an opportunity to sow the seed of truth, but he did not\nimprove it as he should. He should have carried his religion with\nhim while among his relatives. His holy profession and the truth\nof God should have blended with all his thoughts, feelings, words,\nUnity in the Church 409\nand actions. Christ commands His followers to walk in the light.\nWalking means moving onward, exerting ourselves, exercising our\nability, being actively engaged. Unless we exercise ourselves in\nthe good work to which our Saviour has called us, and feel the\nimportance of personal effort in this work, we shall have a sickly,\nstunted religion. We gain new victories by our experience in working.\nWe gain activity and strength by walking in the light, that we may\nhave energy to run in the way of God\u2019s commandments. We may\ngain an increase of strength at every step we advance heavenward.\nGod will bless His people only when they try to be a blessing to [437]\nothers. Our graces are matured and developed by exercise.\nI was shown that while Brother B was at Battle Creek he was\nweak in moral power. He had not been seeking to cling to God\nand preserve his soul in purity of thought and action, and he was\nleft to follow his own mind and to receive impressions that were\ndetrimental to his spiritual interest. He met those who perverted the\ntruth and was led by them to believe things that were untrue; and as\nhe had opened the door to the enemy and received him as an angel\nof light, he was readily overcome by temptation.\nHe became wickedly prejudiced and was suspicious of the very\nones in whom God would have him have confidence. He saw things\nin a perverted light, and the meetings, which should have been to him\na great source of strength, were an injury. This was as Satan would\nhave it, that Brother B might lose confidence in the men whom God\nhad appointed to lead out in this work. He became at variance with\nthem and with the heart of the work. He was like a vessel at sea\nwithout an anchor or a rudder. If he could not have confidence in\nthose at the head of the work he would have confidence in no one.\nBrother B has but little reverence or respect for his brethren; he\nthinks that his judgment and his knowledge and abilities are superior\nto theirs; therefore he will not receive anything from them, nor trust\nto their judgment, nor seek to counsel with them, unless he can\nlead and teach them. He will act according to his own judgment,\nirrespective of his brethren\u2019s feelings, their griefs, or entreaties.\nWhen he separated his confidence from the heart of the work, Satan\nknew that, unless this confidence could be restored, he was sure of\nhim. Brother B\u2019s eternal interest depends upon his accepting and\nrespecting the helps and governments which God has been pleased\n410 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nto place in the church. If he follows a course of his own choosing\nhe will eventually find out that he has been altogether upon a wrong\ntrack and that he has deceived himself to his ruin. He will take first\none turn, then another, and yet after all miss the true and only path\nwhich leads to heaven.\nThere are thousands who are traveling the road of darkness and[438]\nerror, the broad road which leads to death, who flatter themselves\nthat they are in the path to happiness and heaven; but they will never\nfind the one nor reach the other. Brother B needs the helps that\nGod has placed in the church, for he cannot constitute a church of\nhimself, and yet his course shows that he would be satisfied to be\na complete church, subject to none. Brother B long since lost his\nconsecration to God; he did not guard the avenue of his soul against\nthe suggestions of Satan. I saw that angels of God were writing\nhis words and actions. He was going further and further from the\nlight of heaven. When the grace of God does not especially control\nyou, Brother B, you are a hard man to connect with. You have great\nself-confidence and firmness, which are felt in your family and in\nthe church. You have but little reverence and respect for anyone.\nYou do not possess the grace of humility.\nBrother B returned to this coast in great darkness; he had lost\nhis love for the truth and his love for God. His natural feelings\ncontrolled him, and he was proud. He loved himself, and he loved\nmoney better than he loved the truth and his Redeemer. I was shown\nthat his course after he returned to the coast was a dishonor to the\nChristian name. I saw him joining hands with the gay lovers of\npleasure. He grieved his brethren and wounded his Saviour and put\nHim to open shame before unbelievers. I saw that from this time he\ndid not take pleasure in the service of God or in the advancement\nof the truth. He seemed to possess a zeal to search the Scriptures\nand different authors, not that he might become established upon\nimportant points of present truth which the providence of God had\nfurnished him through men of His choice, but to find a new position\nand to advance new views in opposition to the established faith of\nthe body. His researches were not made for the glory of God, but to\npromote self.\nWhen Brother B once takes a position on the wrong side, it is\nnot according to his nature to see his error and confess his wrong,[439]\nUnity in the Church 411\nbut to fight it out to the last, whatever may be the consequences.\nThis spirit is ruinous to the church and ruinous in his family. He\nneeds to soften his heart and let in tenderness, humility, and love.\nHe needs benevolence and noble generosity. In short, he needs to\nbe thoroughly converted, to be a new man in Christ Jesus. Then his\ninfluence in the church will be all right and he will be just the help\nthey need. He will have the respect and love of his family and will\ncommand his household after him. Duty and love like twin sisters,\nwill be his helps in the management of his children.\nI saw that Sister B had much to grieve over in the course that\nher husband had pursued toward her; that her life had been very sad,\nwhen he was able to make it happy. She seemed to be dispirited and\nto keenly feel that she was neglected and unloved by her husband. In\nhis absence she at times felt nearly distracted and became jealous and\ndistrustful in regard to him. Satan was present with his temptations,\nand she looked upon some things in an exaggerated light. All this\nmight have been saved had Brother B preserved his consecration to\nGod. I was carried on still further and saw that he was walking in\nunbelief and darkness while he was flattering himself that he alone\nhad the true light. The further he separated from God the less love\ndid he have for his brethren and for the truth.\nI was shown Brother B questioning one after another of the\npoints of our faith which have brought us out from the world and\nmade us a separate and distinct people, looking for the blessed hope\nand the glorious appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\nHis unbelief and darkness have not moved the main pillars of our\nfaith. The truth of God is not made of none effect by him. It remains\nthe truth still, but he has had some influence upon the minds of his\nbrethren. The reports of lying lips in regard to my husband and\nme, which he brought from the East, had an influence to create\nsuspicions and doubts in the minds of others. Those unacquainted\nwith us could not stand in our defense. The church in -----, I saw,\nmight have numbered three times as many as it now does, and might [440]\nhave had tenfold greater strength, had not Brother B played himself\ninto the hands of the enemy. In his blind unbelief he has done all\nthat he could to discourage and scatter the believers in the truth. In\nhis blindness he has not realized that his course was grievous in the\nsight of God. The discouragement and darkness which he has caused\n412 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nhave made the labors of Brother C doubly hard, for his influence has\nnot only been felt by the church in -----, but by other churches.\nBrother B has strengthened unbelief and an opposing influence\nwhich Brother C has had to meet. I saw that we would meet the same\nand that it would take time to eradicate the old root of bitterness\nwhereby many have been defiled; that there is a time to speak and a\ntime to keep silent; that when God should lay upon us the burden to\nspeak we should not hesitate, whether men would hear or whether\nthey would forbear; and that we should press the matter through if it\nleft some outside the church and outside the truth. God has a great\nand important work for somebody to do in -----, and at the right time\nit will be done, and truth will triumph.\nThose of our brethren who had not obtained an experience\nfor themselves in present truth could not answer the arguments of\nBrother B, and although they could not receive the views advocated\nby him, they were more or less affected by his talk and reasoning.\nSome have felt no spirit of freedom when they met for worship.\nThey were afraid upon the Sabbath to speak out their real feelings\nand faith, expecting that he would criticize what they would say.\nThere has been death in the meetings and but little freedom.\nBrother B desires that others should look up to him as a man\nwho can explain the Scriptures, but I was shown that he is deceived\nand does not understand them. He has started upon a wrong track in\nseeking to get up a new faith, an original theory of faith. He would\nuproot and misplace those waymarks which show us our correct\nbearings, that we are near the close of this earth\u2019s history. He may\nflatter himself that he is being led of the Lord, but it is surely another\nspirit. Unless he changes his course entirely, and is willing to be led[441]\nand to learn, he will be left to follow his own ways and make entire\nshipwreck of faith.\nSome have been so blinded by their own unbelief that they could\nnot discern the spirit of Brother B. They might have been helped\nby him if he had been standing in the counsel of God. He could\nhave led them to the light instead of increasing their confusion of\nfaith and their perplexities. But he has been a stumbling block, a\nblind leader of the blind. Had he made straight paths for his feet,\nthe lame would not have been turned out of the way, but would have\nbeen healed. He has refused to walk in the light of truth which God\nUnity in the Church 413\nhas given His people, and those who would walk in the light he has\nhindered.\nHe feels that it is an honor to suggest doubts and unbelief in\nregard to the established faith of God\u2019s commandment-keeping peo-\nple. The truth that he once rejoiced in is now darkness to him, and,\nunless he changes his course, he will fall back into a mixture of the\nviews of the different denominations, but will agree in the whole\nwith none of them; he will be a distinct church of himself, but not\nunder the control of the great Head of the church. By bringing his\nviews in opposition to the faith of the body, he is disheartening and\ndiscouraging the church. He sees that if the body of Sabbathkeepers\nhave the truth he is in darkness, and this he cannot admit. The truth\ncondemns him, and instead of seeking to bring his soul into harmony\nwith it, surrendering to its claims and dying to self, he is seeking a\nposition where he will not be under condemnation.\nI was shown that if he continues in his present course, blinded to\nhis real condition, he will be glad after a while to find some pretext\nfor giving up the Sabbath. Satan is surely leading him, as he has led\nmany others, away from the body in a course of deception and error.\nHow much safer for Brother B to bring his soul into harmony with\nthe truth than to misinterpret Scripture to bring it into harmony with\nhis ideas and actions. If he would bring his actions into harmony\nwith the principles of God\u2019s law he has a task on his hands of which [442]\nhe has scarcely dreamed. The carnal heart is at enmity with God. It\nis not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.\nThe insinuations and open speeches of those who are our enemies\nin Battle Creek were received by Brother B while on his journey\nEast, and he returned with bitter and wicked feelings in his heart\nagainst those at the heart of the work and especially against me and\nmy work. He had no good reason for the feelings he cherished and\nthe views he expressed in regard to my labors and testimonies. The\nunbelief and prejudice which had corrupted his own soul he sought to\ninstill into the minds of others. He did this with considerable effect.\nAt first, many were influenced by his sophistry and darkness, for he\ncan make assertions and draw inferences as though he were handling\npositive facts. He knows how to press matters and is of ready speech.\nHis words had influence with some who were unconsecrated and\nwho wished to have it just as he represented in regard to our work\n414 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nand our calling. He had influence and excited prejudice in the minds\nof some whom we could have helped, had he not closed our way so\nthat we could not gain access to them. Of this class were Brother\nand Sister D.\nIn this Brother B may see the fruits of his course, and there are\nothers who were influenced in the same way, with the same results,\nso far as their faith and confidence in the truth are concerned. As\nsoon as Brother B or any others decide that the men who have had\nthe most to do in bringing the cause of present truth up to its present\ncondition are not led of God, but are scheming and designing men,\ndeceiving the people, then the course for them to pursue in order to\nbe consistent is to renounce the entire work as a delusion, a fraud. In\norder to be consistent, they must throw all overboard. This Brother\nB has almost imperceptibly to himself been doing, and this others\nhave done. He will at some future time, if not now, review his work\nwith different feelings than he now has. He will see the work which\nhe has been doing during the past few years as God sees it, and will\nnot view it with the satisfaction he now feels. When he sees the[443]\nmiserable work in which he has been engaged for a few years past,\nhis proud boasting of wisdom and superior knowledge will have an\nend, and he will repent in bitterness of soul, for the blood of souls is\non his garments.\nIf Brother B had wanted to view things correctly and had felt\nthe possibility of being deceived, he would have come to Brother\nand Sister White with the reports injurious to their reputation and\nwould have given them an opportunity to speak for themselves. The\nreports which he brought away across the plains to the Pacific Coast\nbear false witness, thus breaking the law of God. He will one day\nmeet the hard speeches, as well as the deceptive sophistry instigated\nby Satan, which he has instilled into minds to injure the influence of\nmy husband and myself. This matter lies not between Brother B and\nme, but between him and God.\nGod has given us our work, and if He has given us a message\nto bear to His people, those who would hinder us in the work and\nweaken the faith of the people in its truth and verity are not fighting\nagainst the instrument, but against God, and they must answer to\nHim for the result of their words and actions. All who have spiritual\ndiscernment may judge of the tree by its fruits. Brother B stands\nUnity in the Church 415\nforth as one enlightened by God to undeceive the people in regard\nto our work and mission. All may see, if they will, the fruit growing\nupon this tree. Brother B, is it to eternal life, or is it to death?\nAfter Brother B received from Battle Creek this special knowl-\nedge, which led him to take a course to belittle our work and mission,\nhe felt at liberty to join with the unbelieving in the dissipation of\npleasure, and by his levity of conduct he brought reproach upon\nthe cause of Christ and great suffering upon his wife. Was he so\nblinded that he had no conviction that he was seeking to tear down\nwhat God was building up? Had he no thoughts that he might be\nfighting against God? The work which he has been doing angels\nhave recorded in heaven, and he will have to answer for it when\nevery work shall be brought into judgment to bear the inspection of [444]\nthe infinite God. In his blindness Brother B has been lifting his puny\narm to fight against God while flattering his deceived soul that he\nwas doing God service. Every man\u2019s work is to be tried by the fire\nof the last day, and only gold, silver, and precious stones will stand\nthe test.\nGod will not be trifled with. He may bear long with men, but He\nwill visit their transgressions and render to every man as his works\nhave been. Although men may talk boastingly and pride themselves\nupon their wisdom, one breath from the lips of God can bring their\nhonor and glorying to the dust. I was shown that Brother B will\nbe inexcusable in the day of God, when every case is weighed in\nthe balances of the sanctuary. He knows better than to do as he has\ndone. He has had sufficient evidence to determine the character of\nthe work which God has committed to us. The fruits of this work\nare before him, which he can see and understand if he will.\nBrother B\u2019s self-confidence is most wonderful, and is a fearful\nsnare to him. If he does not overcome this dangerous trait in his\ncharacter, it will prove his ruin. He is in his natural element when\nhe is battling and controverting points of doctrine; he will question\nand quibble and be at variance with his brethren until Satan so\ncontrols his mind that he really thinks that he has the truth and his\nbrethren are in error. He does not stand in the light and has not the\nblessing of God, for it constitutes a part of his religion to oppose\nthe settled points of God\u2019s commandment-keeping people. Are all\nthese deceived? and is Brother B the only man to whom God has\n416 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ngiven correct truth? Is not God just as willing to give His devoted,\nself-sacrificing servants a correct understanding of the Scriptures as\nto give it to Brother B for them?\nDoes Brother B try his course by this simple test: \u201cDoes this\nlight and knowledge that I have found, and which places me at\nvariance with my brethren, draw me more closely to Christ? does\nit make my Saviour more precious to me and make my character\nmore closely resemble His?\u201d It is a natural, but not a pleasing, trait\nin our characters to be keen in our perceptions, and tenacious in our[445]\nremembrance, of the faults and failings of others.\nBrother B does not try to be in union with his brethren; his self-\nconfidence has led him to feel no special necessity for union. He\nfeels that their minds have been cast in a mold inferior to his own\nand that to receive their opinions and counsel as worthy of attention\nwould be a great condescension. This self-confidence has shut him\naway from the love and sympathy of his brethren and from union\nwith them. He feels that he is too wise and experienced to need\nthe precautions which are indispensable to many. He has so high\nan opinion of his own abilities and such a reliance upon his own\nattainments that he believes himself prepared for any emergency.\nSaid the heavenly angels, pointing to Brother B: \u201cLet him that\nthinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.\u201d Self-confidence leads to\nneglect of watchfulness and of humble, penitential prayer. There are\noutward temptations to be shunned and inward foes and perplexities\nto be overcome, for Satan adapts his temptations to the different\ncharacters and temperaments of individuals.\nThe church of Christ is in constant peril. Satan is seeking to\ndestroy the people of God, and one man\u2019s mind, one man\u2019s judgment,\nis not sufficient to be trusted. Christ would have His followers\nbrought together in church capacity, observing order, having rules\nand discipline, and all subject one to another, esteeming others better\nthan themselves. Union and confidence are essential to the prosperity\nof the church. If each member of the church feels at liberty to move\nindependently of the others, taking his own peculiar course, how\ncan the church be in any safety in the hour of danger and peril? The\nprosperity and very existence of a church depend upon the prompt,\nunited action and mutual confidence of its members. When, at a\ncritical time, one sounds the alarm of danger, there is need of prompt\nUnity in the Church 417\nand active work, without stopping to question and canvass the whole\nsubject from end to end, thus letting the enemy gain every advantage\nby delay, when united action might save many souls from perdition.\nGod wants His people to be united in the closest bonds of Chris- [446]\ntian fellowship; confidence in our brethren is essential to the pros-\nperity of the church; union of action is important in a religious crisis.\nOne imprudent step, one careless action, may plunge the church into\ndifficulties and trials from which it may not recover for years. One\nmember of the church filled with unbelief may give an advantage to\nthe great foe that will affect the prosperity of the entire church, and\nmany souls may be lost as the result. Jesus would have His followers\nsubject one to another; then God can use them as instruments to save\none another; for one may not discern the dangers which another\u2019s\neye is quick to perceive; but if the undiscerning will in confidence\nobey the warning, they may be saved great perplexities and trials.\nAs Jesus was about to leave His disciples, He prayed for them in\na most touching, solemn manner that they all might be one \u201cas Thou,\nFather, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us: that\nthe world may believe that Thou hast sent Me. And the glory which\nThou gavest Me I have given them; that they may be one, even as\nWe are one: I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made\nperfect in one; and that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me,\nand hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.\u201d The apostle Paul in\nhis first epistle to the Corinthians exhorts them to unity: \u201cNow I\nbeseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye\nall speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you;\nbut that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the\nsame judgment.\u201d\nGod is leading a people out from the world upon the exalted\nplatform of eternal truth, the commandments of God and the faith\nof Jesus. He will discipline and fit up His people. They will not\nbe at variance, one believing one thing, and another having faith\nand views entirely opposite, each moving independently of the body.\nThrough the diversity of the gifts and governments that He has placed\nin the church, they will all come to the unity of the faith. If one\nman takes his views of Bible truth without regard to the opinions [447]\nof his brethren, and justifies his course, alleging that he has a right\nto his own peculiar views, and then presses them upon others, how\n418 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ncan he be fulfilling the prayer of Christ? And if another and still\nanother arises, each asserting his right to believe and talk what he\npleases without reference to the faith of the body, where will be that\nharmony which existed between Christ and His Father, and which\nChrist prayed might exist among His brethren?\nGod is leading out a people and establishing them upon the one\ngreat platform of faith, the commandments of God and the testimony\nof Jesus. He has given His people a straight chain of Bible truth,\nclear and connected. This truth is of heavenly origin and has been\nsearched for as for hidden treasure. It has been dug out through\ncareful searching of the Scriptures and through much prayer.\nBrother B is doubting point after point of our faith. If he is right\nin his new theories, the body of Sabbathkeepers is wrong. Shall the\nestablished faith in the strong points of our position, which has led\nus out from the world and united us a distinct and peculiar people,\nbe given up as erroneous? Shall we receive the faith of this one man,\nwith the evidences he gives us of the fruits of his religious character?\nOr will Brother B yield his judgment and opinions, and come to the\nbody? If he had not blinded his soul by receiving prejudice, and by\ncherishing wicked opposition to the work of God, he would not have\nbeen left to such darkness and deception.\nHe is a ready talker and will persistently urge his opinions and\nwill not yield to the weight of evidence against him. It is cruel for\nhim to stand in the way of the prosperity of the church, as he has\ndone. The world is large; he has all the privileges that he can ask of\ngoing out among unbelievers and converting them to his theories;\nand when he can present a well-organized body that he has been the\nmeans of converting from sin to righteousness, then, and not before,\nshould he press his peculiar views upon the church of God, which is\npained and disheartened with his darkness and error. He has no right[448]\nto build upon another man\u2019s foundation his wood, hay, and stubble\nto be consumed by the fires of the last day.\nI was shown that the only safe position for Brother B is to sit\nat the feet of Jesus and learn the way of life more perfectly. His\ndoctrine shall drop as the rain, and His speech shall distill as the\ndew, upon the heart of the humble and teachable. Brother B must\nobtain a teachable disposition. He is not to sit as a judge, but as a\nlearner; not to cavil, but to believe; not to question and find fault\nUnity in the Church 419\nand oppose, but to listen. Pride must give way to humility, and\nprejudice must be exchanged for candor, or the gracious words of\nChrist will be in vain to him. My brother, you may reason with your\nblind judgment and unsanctified mind until the day of God and not\nadvance a step toward heaven; you may debate and investigate and\nsearch learned authors, and even the Scriptures, and yet grow more\nand more self-deceived, and become darker and darker, as did the\nJews in reference to Christ. What was their fault? They rejected\nthe light which God had already given them and were seeking for\nsome new light by which they might so interpret the Scriptures as to\nsustain their actions.\nYou are doing the same; you pass over the light that God has\nseen fit to give you in the publications upon present truth and in His\nword, and are seeking doctrines of your own, theories which cannot\nbe sustained by the word of God. When you become as a little child,\nwilling to be led, and when your understanding is sanctified and your\nwill and prejudices surrendered, such a light will be shed abroad\nin your heart as will illumine the Scriptures and show you present\ntruth in its beautiful harmony. It will appear like a golden chain,\nlink joined to link in a perfect whole. \u201cExcept ye be converted, and\nbecome as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of\nheaven.\u201d \u201cLearn of Me,\u201d says Christ; \u201cfor I am meek and lowly in\nheart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\u201d\nIf you have indeed entered the school of Christ, He expects you\nto manifest in your character and deportment the lowliness which is [449]\nso beautifully exemplified in His character. Christ will not undertake\nto teach the self-righteous, self-conceited, and self-willed. If such\ncome to Him with the inquiry, What is truth? He gives them no\nanswer. It is only the meek that He will guide in judgment; the\nmeek will He teach His way. Solomon was naturally endowed with\ngood judgment and large reasoning powers, but he acknowledged\nhimself before God as a little child. He sought for wisdom from\nGod with humility, and he sought not in vain. If you really search\nfor the truth with the right motive you will come with the body, for\nthey have the truth. If you are searching the Scriptures and different\nauthors that you may find doctrines which will coincide with your\nown preconceived opinions, and if you have already settled your\nfaith, then you will be boastful, self-confident, and unyielding.\n420 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nSelf-Confidence a Snare\nBrother B, with your present self-willed, stubborn spirit, you will\ngo further and further from the truth; and unless you are converted\nyou will prove to be a great hindrance to the cause of God in any\nplace where you have any influence. You are persistent to carry your\npoints. Your self-sufficient spirit must be yielded before you can\nsee anything clearly. You have led your wife to think that you knew\nthe truth better than any of our ministers; you have taken the key of\nknowledge into your own hands, so far as she is concerned, and have\nkept her in darkness. God has given His church men of judgment,\nexperience, and faith. They know the way of truth and salvation, for\nthey have searched for it in agony of spirit because of the opposition\nthey had to meet from men who turned the truth of God into a lie;\nand the benefit of the labor of these faithful servants of God is given\nto the world.\nThere are very few who realize the exalted nature of the work of\nGod in comparison with the temporal business cares of life. Jesus,\nthe heavenly Teacher, has given us lessons of instruction through His[450]\ndisciples. When He sent out the twelve, He instructed them that into\nwhatever city or town they should enter they must inquire who in it\nwas worthy of their attention and visits; and if a suitable place was\nfound where the people would esteem the blessing sent them,\u2014the\nprivilege of entertaining the messengers of Christ,\u2014there they were\nto abide and there let their peace rest until they left that city. They\nwere not instructed to visit any and every house indiscriminately,\nurging their presence upon the people whether they were welcome\nor not; but if they were not welcomed, if their peace could not rest in\nthe house, they were to leave it and seek a house where the members\nwere worthy and where their spirit could rest.\nWhen the messengers of Christ who go forth to teach the truth to\nothers are rejected and their words find no place in the heart, Christ\nis rejected and His word despised in the messengers of truth whom\nHe has chosen and sent. This has just as full an application in this\nage of the world as it had when Christ gave the instruction to His\nchosen messengers.\nWhen Christ was upon the earth, there were men who had no\nrespect or reverence for God\u2019s messengers and no more regard for\nUnity in the Church 421\ntheir warning than for their own judgment; also in this age of the\nworld there are those who do not respect the testimony of God\u2019s\nchosen servants so highly as their own opinions. Such cannot be\nbenefited by the labors of God\u2019s servants, and time should not be\nlost in degrading the work of God to meet such minds. Christ said\nto the servants whom He sent forth: \u201cHe that heareth you heareth\nMe; and he that despiseth you despiseth Me; and he that despiseth\nMe despiseth Him that sent Me.\u201d\nChrist gives power to the voice of the church. \u201cVerily I say unto\nyou, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven:\nand whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\u201d\nNo such thing is countenanced as one man\u2019s starting out upon his\nown individual responsibility and advocating what views he chooses,\nirrespective of the judgment of the church. God has bestowed the [451]\nhighest power under heaven upon His church. It is the voice of God\nin His united people in church capacity which is to be respected.\nGod has given to His church men who have an experience, those\nwho have fasted and wept and prayed, even through the entire night,\nfor the Lord to open the Scriptures to their minds. In humility these\nmen have given the world the benefit of their mature experience. Is\nthis light of heaven, or of men? Is it of any value, or is it worthless?\nBrother B is doing a work in disseminating erroneous views of Bible\ntruth that he will one day wish to undo; but it will be in vain. He\nmay repent, he may yet be saved as by fire; but, oh, how much\nprecious time will have been lost that never can be redeemed! How\nmuch seed has he sown that has borne only briers and thorns! How\nmany souls have been lost that might have been saved had he tried as\nearnestly to let the true light shine as he has to scatter his darkness!\nWhat might he not have done had he been consecrated, sanctified\nthrough the truth! Brother B feels too self-sufficient, too rich and\nincreased with goods, to see his need of anything. The True Witness\npointed to him and said: \u201cUnless ye become converted as a little\nchild, ye cannot see the kingdom of heaven.\u201d The light of truth so\ncarefully brought out in books and papers he does not respect; but\nhe exalts his own judgment above the most precious light, and this\nlight will rise up in the judgment to condemn him.\nI saw that he would question the men upon whom God has seen\nfit to lay the responsibility of His work. He would exalt his own\n422 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nopinions and views above the light which God had given through\nthem, and would boast of his knowledge; and he would be an accuser\nof his brethren, not excepting the ambassadors of Christ. All this\noverbearing influence to belittle the judgment of the servants of\nGod and to accuse them of weaknesses and errors, exalting his\nown opinions above theirs, if not repented of, will be found written\nagainst him in the books, which he will see with shame in the day of\nGod.\nGod will hold up His servants, will preserve His favored ones;[452]\nbut woe unto him who would make of none effect the words of\nChrist\u2019s ambassadors, who receive the word from the mouth of God\nto speak to the people and who would tell the people that the sword is\ncoming and warn them to prepare for the great day of God. Brother\nB will find that it is no light or trivial work in which he has been\nengaged; it is a work which will roll back upon his soul with crushing\nweight. He has brought his spirit in opposition to God. He has a\nhard work before him. Said Christ: \u201cIt must needs be that offenses\ncome; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.\u201d\nBrother B, the course that you have been pursuing was shown\nme three years ago. I saw that you were wrong in almost every\naction, and yet you tried to gauge the truth to your actions instead\nof gauging them to the truth. You were not a light to the people of\nGod, but a terrible burden. You will not lift when there is lifting to\nbe done, and you discourage others from union of action. You are\never finding fault and talking of your brethren, and while you have\nbeen questioning the course of others, a rank growth of poisonous\nweeds has flourished and taken deep root in your own heart. These\nroots of bitterness springing up have defiled many and will defile\nmany more unless you see them and root them out.\nI was shown that a harsh, pharisaical spirit would grow upon\nBrother B and control him unless he sees the terrible defects in his\ncharacter and obtains grace from God to correct the evil. Before\nhe embraced the truth, his hand seemed to be against everyone;\nhis combative spirit would strengthen at any provocation, and his\nself-esteem would be injured; he was a hard man, getting into and\nmaking trouble. The truth of God wrought a reformation in him.\nGod accepted him, and His hand held him up. But since Brother B\nhas lost the spirit of consecration, his old, turbulent spirit, at variance\nUnity in the Church 423\nwith others, has been strengthening and seeking to gain the mastery.\nWhen he dies to self and humbles his proud heart before God he\nwill find how weak is his strength; he will feel the need of heavenly [453]\nsuccor and will cry: \u201cUnclean, unclean, before Thee, O God.\u201d All\nhis proud boasting in self will have an end.\nLife in this stormy world, where moral darkness triumphs over\ntruth and virtue, will be to the Christian a continual conflict. He\nwill find that he must keep the armor on, for he will have to fight\nagainst forces that never tire and foes that never sleep. We shall\nfind ourselves beset with countless temptations, and we must find\nstrength in Christ to overcome them or be overcome by them and\nlose our souls. We have a great and solemn work to do, and how\nterrible will be our loss if we fail. If the work which our Master has\nleft us be found undone, we cannot have a second probation granted\nus. It must remain undone forever.\nI was shown the life of Brother B in his family. Angels wept\nas they viewed his course at home, as they viewed the unloved\nwife, who receives no respect from him whose duty it is to love and\ncherish her as his own body, even as Christ has loved and cherished\nthe church. He takes pains to make her defects apparent and to exalt\nhis own wisdom and judgment and to make her feel her inferiority\nin company and alone. Notwithstanding she is illiterate, her spirit\nis far more acceptable to God than the spirit of her husband. God\nlooks upon Sister B with feelings of the deepest pity. She lives out\nthe principles of truth, as far as she has light, much better than her\nhusband. She will not be answerable for the light and knowledge\nthat her husband has had but which she has not had. He could be a\nlight and comfort and blessing to her, but his influence is used in a\nwrong way. He reads to her what he pleases, that which will give\nstrength to his views and his ideas, while he keeps back essential\nlight which he does not want her to hear.\nHe does not respect his wife, and he allows his children to show\nher disrespect. Like Eli\u2019s sons, these children are left to come up.\nThey are not restrained, and all this neglect will by and by rebound\nupon himself. That which Brother B is now sowing he will most\nassuredly reap. Sister B, in many respects, is nearer the kingdom of [454]\nheaven than her husband. These unruly, disobedient children, that\nare not educated to self-control, will plant thorns in the hearts of\n424 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ntheir parents that they cannot prevent; and then in the judgment God\nwill call the parents to account for bringing children into the world\nand letting them come up untrained, unloving, and unloved. These\nchildren cannot be saved in the kingdom of heaven without a great\nchange in their characters.\nBrother B seeks to have his wife believe as he believes, and he\nwould have her think that all he does is right and that he knows more\nthan any of the ministers and is wise above all men. I was shown that\nin his boasted wisdom he is dealing with the bodies of his children\nas he is with the soul of his wife. He has been following a course\naccording to his own wisdom, which is ruining the health of his\nchild. He flatters himself that the poison which he has introduced\ninto her system keeps her alive. What a mistake! He should reason\nhow much better she might have been had he let her alone and not\nabused nature. This child can never have a sound constitution, for her\nbones and the current of blood in her veins have been poisoned. The\nshattered constitutions of his children and their aches and distressing\npains will cry out against his boasted wisdom, which is folly.\nBut what is more deplorable than all the rest is that he has, as it\nwere, left the door to perdition wide open for his children to enter\nand be lost. The natures of his children will have to be changed,\ntheir characters transformed and made over new, or there can be no\nhope for them. Can angels look lovingly upon your family, Brother\nB? Can they delight to dwell in your house? The building is good,\nbut the house does not make the happiness within. Those who live\nwithin the walls make it a heaven or a hell. You do not respect\nthe mother of your children. You permit in them disobedience and\ndisrespect.\nYou may say: \u201cWhy does Sister White come to me with this? I\nhave no faith in the visions.\u201d I knew this before I attempted to write,\nbut I feel that the time has come for me to set these things before[455]\nyou. I must tell you the truth, for I expect to meet in the judgment\nwhat I have here imperfectly written. I have waited, hoping that I\nmight say something that would reach your heart and soften it for\nthe very words I have here written. But I have lost all hope in that\ndirection, for you are fortified with an armor as impenetrable as steel.\nYou will not accept of anything that does not meet your mind. I was\nshown that it would have been better for the cause of present truth if\nUnity in the Church 425\nyou had never embraced the Sabbath. Your conscience is not a very\nsensitive one; you are blinded by the enemy.\nI have given up all hope of doing anything for the church in\n----- while you are a stumbling block to them. You once loved the\ntruth, and had you followed on in the pathway of truth and holiness\nyou would now have been an ambassador for Christ. You will have\na fearful account to give in the great day of God for your talents\nwhich have been unimproved. You had good abilities. God lent\nthese talents to you for you to put to good account, but you have\nabused these gifts. Had you used the ability that God had given you,\non the right side, you would have done much in winning souls to\nChrist, and you would see in the kingdom of heaven souls saved\nthrough your instrumentality. But you have scattered abroad instead\nof gathering with Christ. Your brethren have been discouraged from\ntrying to rise and advance, because you, like an opposing body,\ncounteract the good they would do.\nThe heart of God never yearned toward His earthly children with\ndeeper love and more compassionate tenderness than now. There\nnever was a time when God was ready and waiting to do more for His\npeople than now. And He will instruct and save all who choose to\nbe saved in His appointed way. Those who are spiritual can discern\nspiritual things and see tokens of the presence and work of God\neverywhere. Satan, by his skillful and wicked strategy, led our first\nparents from the Garden of Eden\u2014from their innocence and purity\ninto sin and unspeakable wretchedness. He has not ceased to destroy;\nall the forces which he can command are diligently employed by [456]\nhim in these last days to compass the ruin of souls. He seizes every\nartifice that he can use to deceive, perplex, and confuse the people\nof God.\nHe has used you as his agent to scatter darkness and confusion,\nand he finds that you work admirably in his hands. You are the very\ninstrument that he can handle with good effect to hurt, discourage,\nand tear down. You are not zealous to put your shoulder under the\nload with the people of God; but when they would move, you throw\nyourself as an additional load to prevent them from doing what they\nmight do in advancing in the right direction. Satan is at work with\nthose who keep the commandments of God and have the faith of\nJesus. The most bitter hatred exists within him against all who are\n426 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nloyal to God and who obey His commandments. He sleeps not; he\ndoes not abate his vigilance for one moment. Would that God\u2019s\nprofessed followers were half as wise, diligent, and persevering in\nthe work of God as Satan is in his work.\nHad you, Brother B, followed on when you first set your hand\nto the plow, and not looked back, you would now have been a\nmessenger of light to bear the truth to those in darkness. But God\ncould not use you to His glory until you should learn to counsel\nwith your brethren and not to think you knew all that was worth\nknowing. Satan has succeeded in keeping you from doing good.\nYou did run well for a season, but Satan\u2019s temptations overcame you.\nYou loved to be first and to be flattered. You loved the power which\nmoney gives. Satan understands the weakness of men. He has the\nknowledge which he has accumulated for ages and is an experienced\nhand at his work. His cunning and devices are well matured, and\nare too often successful because God\u2019s people are not as wise as\nserpents.\nSatan frequently appears as an angel of light, arrayed in the\nlivery of heaven; he assumes friendly airs, manifesting great sanctity\nof character and high regard for his victims, the souls whom he\nmeans to deceive and destroy. Perils lie in the path which he invites\nsouls to travel, but he succeeds in concealing these and presents the[457]\nattractions only. The great Captain of our salvation has conquered in\nour behalf, that through Him we might conquer, if we would, in our\nown behalf. But Christ saves none against their choice; He compels\nnone to obedience. He made the infinite sacrifice that they might\novercome in His name and His righteousness be imputed unto them.\nBut in order to be saved you must accept the yoke of Christ\nand lay off the yoke which you have fashioned for your neck. The\nvictory that Jesus gained in the wilderness is a pledge to you of the\nvictory that you may gain through His name. Your only hope and\nsalvation is in overcoming as Christ overcame. The wrath of God\nnow hangs over you. You love the attractions of the world above\nthe heavenly treasure. The lust of the eye and the pride of life have\nseparated you from God. Your confidence in your own poor, weak,\nfaulty self must be broken. You must feel your weakness before you\nwill drop, with your burden, into the hands of God. The soul that\ntrusts fully and entirely in God will never be confounded.\nUnity in the Church 427\nGod would not have us consult our own convenience in obeying\nHim. Christ pleased not Himself when He was a man among men.\nHe was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. The Majesty\nof heaven had not where to lay His head, no place that He could\nclaim as His own. He became poor for our sakes, that through Him\nwe might be rich indeed. Let us not talk of sacrifice, for we know\nnot what it is to sacrifice for the truth. As yet we have scarcely\nlifted the cross for Christ\u2019s dear sake. Let us not seek for a way\nwhich is easier than the path our Redeemer has traveled before us.\nHow incompetent are you, with all your boasted wisdom, to guide\nyourself! How liable are you to follow the dictates of a deceived\nconscience, to run in the way of error, and drag others with you!\nYour natural temperament is such that submission and obedience\nto God\u2019s requirements are very hard. Your unbounded self-confi-\ndence, your prejudices, and your feelings easily lead you to choose [458]\na wrong path. Christ will be to you an infallible guide if you will\nchoose Him before your own blind judgment. In your business\nyou have not had an eye single to the glory of God. You have had\nmany perplexities and many difficulties to encounter, and if you\nhad trusted to the True Counselor instead of to your own judgment,\nyou would ever have been guided out of your perplexities in your\nbusiness transactions.\nYou have an important work before you which you can never do\nwithout the special help of God. You are capable of securing the\ncompanionship of angels and of being an heir of God, a joint heir\nwith Jesus Christ; and for you to labor to confine the range of hope\nand desire within the narrow compass of your own convenience\nwould be a lifelong mistake. It is a terrible mistake to live only\nfor this world. You look back and feel the condemnation of your\nown wrong course, and seek to justify yourself by finding fault with\nothers. Whatever course others may pursue, or however wrong they\nmay be, their errors will never cover one of your mistakes; and in\nthe day of final reckoning you will not dare to plead this before God\nas a palliation for your neglect of duty.\nGod proposes to accept you as His child and make you a member\nof the royal family, a child of the heavenly King, upon conditions\nthat you come out from the world and be separate and touch not the\nunclean thing. The Monarch of heaven would have you possess and\n428 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nenjoy all that can ennoble, expand, and exalt your being and fit you\nto dwell with Him forever, your existence measuring with the life of\nGod. What a prospect is the life which is to come! What charms it\npossesses! How broad and deep and measureless is the love of God\nmanifested to man! No words can describe this love; it surpasses\nall thought and imagination, but it is a reality that you may learn by\nexperience; you may rejoice in it with joy unspeakable and full of\nglory.\nWith such a prospect before you, how can you narrow your mind\nto the compass of worldly thoughts and to the range of worldly[459]\noccupations, seeking gain and yielding one point after another of\npresent truth. Truth, principle, and conscience are desirable for you\nto retain. The favor of God is better than houses of silver and of gold.\nThe deepest joy of the heart comes from the deepest humiliation.\nTrust and submission to God work out strength and nobleness of\ncharacter. Tears are not in every case evidences of weakness. In\norder for you to build up a character which is symmetrical in the\nsight of a pure and holy God you must begin at the foundation. The\nheart must be broken before God, and true repentance for sin must\nbe shown, till you meet the demands of truth and duty. Then you\nwill have true respect for yourself and true confidence in God. You\nwill have tenderness of feeling. All that braggadocio spirit will be\ngone. In the place of harshness will be great tenderness blended with\nfirmness of purpose to stand for the truth at all events. You will then\nsee much in the world and in your own heart to make you weep.\n* * * * *\nChapter 37\u2014True Refinement in the Ministry\nBrother E,\nI have designed to write to you for some time past, but have\nnot found an opportunity to do so until now. While speaking to the\npeople last Sabbath, I felt so clearly impressed with your case that\nI could with difficulty refrain from calling your name in public. I\nwill now unburden my mind by writing you. In my last vision I\nwas shown the deficiencies of those who profess to labor in word\nand doctrine. I saw that you had not been improving your abilities,\nbut had been growing less and less efficient to teach the truth. You\nneed a thorough conversion. You have a strong, set will, even to\nstubbornness. You might now have been fitted for the solemn work\nof bearing the message of truth to others had you been less self-\nconfident and more humble and meek in spirit.\nYou do not love close application nor the taxation of continued\neffort. You have not been a persevering student of the word of God, [460]\nneither have you been a zealous worker in the cause of God. Your\nlife has been far from representing the life of Christ. You are not\ndiscriminating. You are not a wise, judicious worker. You do not\nstudy to win souls to Christ, as every minister of Christ should. You\nhave a set track, a standard of your own, to which you wish to bring\nthe people; but you fail to do this because they will not accept your\nstandard. You are bigoted and frequently carry things to extremes\nand thereby seriously hurt the cause of God and turn souls from the\ntruth instead of winning them to it.\nI was shown that you had spoiled several good openings by your\ninjudicious manner of laboring, and what shall I say to you in regard\nto this matter? Souls have been lost through your lack of wisdom in\npresenting the truth and your failure to adorn your calling as a gospel\nminister by courtesy, kindness, and long-suffering. True Christian\npoliteness should characterize all the actions of a minister of Christ.\nOh, how poorly have you represented our pitiful, compassionate\nRedeemer, whose life was the embodiment of goodness and true\n429\n430 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\npurity. You have turned souls from the truth by a harsh, censorious,\noverbearing spirit. Your words have not been in the gentleness\nof Christ, but in the spirit of E. Your nature is naturally coarse\nand unrefined, and because you have never felt the necessity of\ntrue refinement and Christian politeness, your life has not been as\nelevated as it might have been.\nYou have remained in the rut of habit. Your education and\ntraining have not been correct, and therefore your efforts should\nhave been the more earnest to improve, to reform, and make decided\nand thorough changes. Unless you realize a decided and thorough\nconversion in almost every respect you are entirely unfitted to preach\nthe truth, and unless you can have a proper and becoming elevation\nof character, manners, and address, you will do more harm than you\ncan do good. You have not done much in advancing the truth, for\nyou have lingered about the churches too much, when you could\ndo them no good, but only injury. Your ways and manners need\nrefining and sanctifying. You should no longer mar the work of God[461]\nby your deficiencies, since you have shown no decided improvement\nin becoming a workman in the cause of God.\nIt is impossible for you to bring others up to any higher standard\nthan that to which you yourself attain. If you do not advance, how\ncan you lead the church of God forward to a higher standard of piety\nand holiness? All such ministers as you have been for several years\nare more of a curse than a blessing to the cause of God, and the\nfewer we have of them the more prosperous will be the cause of\npresent truth.\nYou are not elevated in your ideas, or aspiring in your labors.\nYou are content to be commonplace and to make a cheap minister.\nYou do not aspire to perfection of Christian character and to that\nposition in the work that Christ requires every one of His chosen\nministers to attain. No one professing to bear the truth to others\nis fitted for the responsible work unless he is making advancement\nin knowledge and in consecration to the work, and is improving\nhis manners and temper, and growing in true wisdom from day to\nday. Close communion with God is necessary for every man who\nwould guide souls into the truth. It should ever be borne in mind by\nthose who take upon themselves the burden of guiding souls out of\nnature\u2019s darkness into the marvelous light that they themselves must\nTrue Refinement in the Ministry 431\nbe advancing in that light, else how can they lead others? If they are\nwalking in darkness themselves, it is a most fearful responsibility\nwhich they assume in pretending to teach others the way.\nYou have engaged in labor in places where you were not compe-\ntent to do justice to the work which you undertook. You did not labor\njudiciously. You sought to make up for your lack of real knowledge\nby censuring other denominations, running down others, and making\nhard and bitter criticisms upon their course and condition. Had your\nheart been all aglow with the spirit of truth, had you been sanctified\nto God and walking in the light as Christ is in the light, you would\nhave moved in wisdom and would have had enough ways and means\nat your command to maintain an interest without going out of your [462]\nway and aside from your specific work to rail out against others who\nprofess to be Christians.\nUnbelievers have been disgusted; they think that Seventh-day\nAdventists have been fairly represented by you, and they decide\nthat it is enough and that they want no more of such doctrines. Our\nfaith is unpopular at best and is in wide contrast to the faith and\npractices of other denominations. In order to reach those who are\nin the darkness of error and false theories, we must approach them\nwith the utmost caution and with the greatest wisdom, agreeing with\nthem on every point that we can conscientiously.\nAll consideration should be shown for those in error and all just\ncredit given them for honesty. We should come as near the people\nas possible, and then the light and truth which we have may benefit\nthem. But Brother E, like many of our ministers, commences a\nwarfare at once against the errors that others cherish; he thus raises\ntheir combativeness and their set wills, and this holds them encased\nin an armor of selfish prejudice which no amount of evidence can\nremove.\nWho but yourself will be responsible for the souls that you have\nturned away from the truth by your unsanctified labors? Who can\nbreak down the walls of prejudice which your injudicious labor has\nbuilt up? I know of no greater sin against God than for men to engage\nin the ministry who labor in self and not in Christ. They are looked\nup to as the representatives of Christ, when they do not represent His\nspirit in any of their labors. They do not see or realize the dangers\nattending the efforts made by unconsecrated, unconverted men. They\n432 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nmove on like blind men, deficient in almost everything and yet self-\nconfident and self-sufficient, themselves walking in darkness and\nstumbling at every step. They are bodies in darkness.\nBrother E, you have narrow ideas, and your labor has a tendency\nto lower rather than to elevate the truth. This is not because you have\nno ability. You could have made a good workman, but you are too\nindolent to make the effort necessary to attain the object. You would[463]\nrather come down in a harsh and overbearing manner upon those who\ndiffer with you than to take the trouble to elevate the tone of your\nlabor. You take positions, and then when they are questioned you are\nnot humble enough to yield your notions though they are shown to\nbe wrong; but you stand up in your independence and firmly hold to\nyour ideas when concession on your part is essential and is required\nof you as a duty. You have stubbornly and unyieldingly held to your\nown judgment and opinions to the sacrifice of souls.\nBrother E, your set positions and your strong, determined will\nto carry out your points at all hazards were felt and deplored by\nyour wife, and her health suffered in consequence. You were not\ngentle and tender to this sensitive child of God; your strong spirit\noverbore her more gentle disposition. She grieved over many things.\nYou could have made her life happier had you tried; but you sought\nto have her see things as you saw them, and, instead of trying to\nassimilate yourself to her refined temperament, you tried to mold\nher to your coarser nature and your extreme ideas. She was warped\nin her nature and could not act out herself. She withered like a plant\ntransplanted to an uncongenial soil.\nYou should not seek to mold minds and characters after your\npattern, but should allow your own character to be molded after the\ndivine Pattern. If this world were composed of men like yourself in\ncharacter and temperament, woe would be to it. As like would meet\nlike whichever way you might turn, you would be disgusted with\nyour associates, the exact patterns of yourself, and would wish to be\nout of the world.\nYou boast and glory in yourself. But, oh, how improper is this\nfor any man, even if he have the finest qualities of mind and the most\nextended influence! Men of fine qualities have the greatest influence\nbecause they do not know their worth and how much good they do\nTrue Refinement in the Ministry 433\naccomplish in the world. But it is all out of place for men of your\nstamp of character to be lifted up and boastful in self.\nIn your labors you frequently start out well; you raise an interest, [464]\nand conviction rests upon minds that the arguments used cannot be\ncontroverted; but just at the time when souls are balancing in favor\nof the truth, self appears so plainly, is so prominent, that all which\nmight have been gained, had Jesus shone forth in your words and\ndeportment, is lost.\nYou lack the very graces which are essential to win souls to Christ\nand the truth. You can argue well; but you have not an experimental\nknowledge of the divine will, and for want of a religious experience\nyourself you are unable to lead others to the Fountain of living\nwaters. Your own soul is not in communion with God, but is in\ndarkness; and nothing can supply the deficiency realized by souls\ngroping their way in the dark, except the light of truth. Unless you\nare thoroughly converted, your efforts to convert others might as well\ncease now as for you to labor longer, mangling and perverting the\nreligious standard by your narrow and bigoted ideas. You have not an\nexperimental knowledge of the divine will; your own righteousness\nseems to you to be of value, when it is valueless. You need to be\ntransformed before you can be of use in the cause of God. When\nyou are converted then you can labor to acceptance.\nYou do not possess the religion of Christ. You must soften your\nheart and die to self, and Christ must live in you; then you will walk\nin the light as He is in the light, and you will leave a bright track\nheavenward to lighten the pathway of others. You have felt too well\nsatisfied with yourself. You should educate yourself and overcome\nyour bigoted and fault-finding spirit. You need to keep the body\nunder and bring it into subjection, lest, after you have preached to\nothers, you yourself should be a castaway.\nYou take small views of matters, pick at straws, find fault, and\nquestion the course of others, when you might far better be over-\ncoming the defects in your own character and life, working from a\nChristian standpoint, seeking light from God, and preparing to unite\nwith pure angels in the kingdom of heaven. As you are, you would\nmar all heaven. You are uncultivated, unrefined, and unsanctified. [465]\nThere is no place in heaven for such a character as you now possess.\n434 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nIf you will take hold of the work earnestly and, without making\nany apology for sin, will condemn sin in the flesh and reach up\nin faith and hope for divine grace and right judgment, you may\novercome those deficiencies in your character which disqualify you\nfor laboring in the cause of God. You have not advanced or improved\nfor many years. You are further today from the standard of Christian\nperfection, from possessing the qualifications which should be found\nin the minister of the gospel, than you were a few months after you\nhad received the truth.\nGod is displeased with those who are not intelligent in regard\nto the Christian religion and yet are trying to lead others. You are\ncorrectly represented by the man who sought to pull out a mote from\nhis brother\u2019s eye when a beam was in his own eye. First set your own\nheart in order, and reform your own character; obtain a connection\nwith God, and gain a daily Christian experience; then you may bear\na burden for souls who are out of Christ.\nThere are but few of the brethren who have taken more time to\nread different authors than you have, and yet you are very deficient\nin the qualifications necessary for a minister teaching the truth. You\nfail to quote, or even read, the Scriptures correctly. This should not\nbe. You have not advanced in mental culture and have not secured\na growth of grace in the soul which would shine out in your words\nand deportment. You have not felt the necessity of reaching up for\nhigher and holier attainments.\nChasing through books superficially clogs the mind and causes\nyou to become a mental dyspeptic. You cannot digest and use one\nhalf that you read. If you should read with the one object in view\nto improve the mind, and should read only as much as the mind\ncan comprehend and digest, and would patiently persevere in such\na course of reading, good results would be accomplished. You, as\nwell as other ministers, need to attend school and to commence like\na child to master the first branches of knowledge. You can neither[466]\nread, spell, nor pronounce correctly, and yet there are but few who\nhave had less taxation and less burdens of responsibility to bear than\nyourself.\nThe position of our ministers calls for health of body and dis-\ncipline of mind. Good sound sense, strong nerves, and a cheerful\nTrue Refinement in the Ministry 435\ntemper will recommend the gospel minister anywhere. These should\nbe sought for and perseveringly cultivated.\nYour life thus far has been unprofitable. You have some very\ngood ideas, but the Spirit of God does not dwell in your heart. You\nare not quickened by His power, and you have not genuine faith,\nhope, and love. The Spirit of Christ dwelling in you will enable you\nto take of the things of God and reveal them to others. You can be\nof no benefit to the cause of God till the work of a faithful minister\nof Christ is more exalted in your mind. You want a purpose in your\nlife to do good, as did Jesus. The self-denial and love which you\nmanifest in this work will tell upon the lives and characters of others.\nYou should get rid of your cold, frozen formality as soon as pos-\nsible. You need to cultivate feelings of tenderness and friendliness\nin your everyday life. You should exhibit true courtesy and Christian\npoliteness. The heart that really loves Jesus loves those for whom\nHe died. Just as truly as the needle points to the pole, so will the\ntrue follower of Christ, with a spirit of earnest labor, seek to save\nsouls for whom Christ has given His life. Working for the salvation\nof sinners will keep the love of Christ warm in the heart and will\ngive that love a proper growth and development. Without a correct\nknowledge of the divine will there will be a lack of harmonious\ndevelopment in the Christian character.\nI beseech you, my brother, to become acquainted with God. \u201cThe\nsteps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.\u201d Ministering angels\nmark every step of our progress. But your will is not surrendered\nto God; your thoughts are not holy. You go on, stumbling along in [467]\ndarkness, not knowing where to place your feet. The Lord reveals\nHis will to those who are earnest and anxious to be guided. The\nreason for your inefficiency is that you have given up the idea of\nknowing and doing the will of God, therefore you do not know\nanything positively. Though blind yourself, you attempt to lead the\nblind.\nOh, in what a position are you and many other ministers! Having\nforsaken God, the Fountain of living waters, you and they have\nhewn out to yourselves broken cisterns that can hold no water. I\nentreat of you to be alarmed and turn to the Lord with that deep and\nearnest repentance which will secure to you His forgiveness and the\nenduring strength of His might, that you may indeed be filled with\n436 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nall the fullness of God. He frowns upon your course, for you have\nbeen as a stumbling block to souls. You have depended on your own\nworks and righteousness for success, and have not a knowledge of\nthe divine will.\nMay the Lord reveal to you your true character and let you see\nyour real deficiencies. When you are enlightened by the Spirit of\nGod to understand this you will have such a sense of your sinful\nneglect and unimproved life as will strike terror to your soul and\ncause you sorrow that will lead to repentance that needeth not to be\nrepented of.\nNumber Twenty-Five\u2014Testimony for the [468]\nChurch\nChapter 38\u2014Importance of the Work\nJanuary 3, 1875, I was shown many things relative to the great\nand important interests at Battle Creek in the work of the Publishing\nAssociation, the school, and the Health Institute. If these institutions\nwere properly conducted, they would greatly advance the cause of\nGod in the spread of the truth and in the salvation of souls. We are\nliving amid the perils of the last days. Consecration to God can\nalone fit any of us to act a part in the solemn and important closing\nwork for this time. There are but few wholly unselfish men to fill\nresponsible positions, few who have given themselves unreservedly\nto God to hear His voice and study His glory. There are but few who\nwould, if required, give their lives to advance the cause of God. Yet\nit is just such devotion as this that God claims.\nMen are deceived in thinking they are serving God when they\nare serving themselves and making the interest of the cause and\nwork of God a secondary matter. Their hearts are not consecrated.\nThe Lord takes no pleasure in the services of this class. From time\nto time, as the cause has progressed, He has in His providence\ndesignated men to fill positions at Battle Creek. These men could\nhave filled important positions if they had consecrated themselves\nto God and devoted their energies to His work. These men of God\u2019s\nselection needed the very discipline that a devotion to His work\nwould give them. He would honor them by connecting them with\nHimself and giving them His Holy Spirit to qualify them for the[469]\nresponsibilities they were called to bear. They could not gain that\nbreadth of experience and knowledge of the divine will unless they\nwere in positions to bear burdens and responsibilities.\nNone should be deceived in thinking that in connecting them-\nselves with the work of God in Battle Creek they will have less\ncare, less hard labor, and fewer trials. Satan is most active where\nthe most is being done to advance the truth and to save souls. He\nunderstands human nature, and he will not let these men alone if\nthere is any prospect of their becoming more like Christ and more\n438\nImportance of the Work 439\nuseful workers in the cause of God. Satan lays his plans to press\nhis temptations upon the very men whom God has signified that He\nwould accept to act a part in connection with His work. It is Satan\u2019s\nstudy to know how he can best war against and defeat the purposes\nof God. He is acquainted with the weak as well as the strong points\nin the characters of men. And in a subtle manner he works with all\ndeceivableness of unrighteousness to thwart the purposes of God by\nassailing the weak points in their characters; and when this is done,\nthe way is prepared for him to attack and overcome the stronger\npoints. He gains control of the mind and blinds the understanding.\nHe leads men who are bewildered and overcome by his devices to\nself-confidence and self-sufficiency at the very time when they are\nthe weakest in moral power. They become self-deceived and think\nthey are in good spiritual condition.\nThe enemy will seize everything possible to use in his favor and\nto destroy souls. Testimonies have been borne in favor of individ-\nuals occupying important positions. They commence well to lift\nthe burdens and act their part in connection with the work of God.\nBut Satan pursues them with his temptations, and they are finally\novercome. As others look upon their wrong course, Satan suggests\nto their minds that there must be a mistake in the testimonies given\nfor these persons, else these men would not have proved themselves\nunworthy to bear a part in the work of God.\nThis is just as Satan designed it should be. He would throw [470]\ndoubt in regard to the light that God has given. These men might\nhave withstood the temptations of Satan had they been watchful\nand guarded, feeling their own insufficiency, and trusting in the\nname and strength of Jesus to stand faithful to duty. But it should\nbe borne in mind that conditions have ever been connected with\nthe encouragement given these men, that if they would maintain\nan unselfish spirit, if they would feel their weakness and would\nrely upon God, not trusting in their own wisdom and judgment, but\nmaking Him their strength, they could be a great blessing in His\ncause and work. But Satan has come in with his temptations and\nhas triumphed almost every time. He has so arranged circumstances\nas to assail the weak points in the characters of these men, and they\nhave been overcome. How shamefully they have injured the cause\nof God! How fully they have separated themselves from Him by\n440 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nfollowing their own corrupt hearts, their own souls may answer! But\nthe day of God will reveal the true cause for all our disappointments\nin man. God is not at fault. He gave them encouraging promises\nupon conditions, but they did not comply with these conditions.\nThey trusted to their own strength and fell under temptation.\nThat which can be said of men under certain circumstances\ncannot be said of them under other circumstances. Men are weak in\nmoral power and so supremely selfish, so self-sufficient and so easily\npuffed up with vain conceit, that God cannot work in connection\nwith them, and they are left to move like blind men and to manifest\nso great weakness and folly that many are astonished that such\nindividuals should ever have been accepted and acknowledged as\nworthy of having any connection with God\u2019s work. This is just\nwhat Satan designed. This was his object from the time he first\nspecially tempted them to reproach the cause of God and to cast\nreflections upon the Testimonies. Had they remained where their\ninfluence would not have been specially felt upon the cause of God,\nSatan would not have beset them so fiercely; for he could not have\naccomplished his purpose by using them as his instruments to do a[471]\nspecial work.\nIn the advancement of the work of God that which may be said\nin truth of individuals at one time may not correctly be said of them\nat another time. The reason of this is that one month they may have\nstood in innocency, living up to the best light they had, while the\nmonth following was none too short for them to be overcome by\nSatan\u2019s devices and, through self-confidence, to fall into grievous\nsins and become unfitted for the work of God.\nMinds are so subject to change through the subtle temptations of\nSatan that it is not the best policy for my husband or myself to take\nthe responsibility of even stating our opinions of the qualifications of\npersons to fill different positions, because we are made responsible\nfor the course that such individuals pursue. Notwithstanding, if\nthey had maintained the humility and firm trust in God which they\npossessed when recommended to take responsibilities they might\nhave been the very persons for the place. These persons change,\nyet are not sensible of the change in themselves. They fall under\ntemptation, are led away from their steadfastness, and sever their\nconnection with God. They are then controlled by the enemy and do\nImportance of the Work 441\nand say things which dishonor God and reproach His cause. Then\nSatan exults to see our brethren and sisters looking upon us with\ndoubt because we have given these persons encouragement and\ninfluence.\n* * * * *\nChapter 39\u2014The State of the World\nI was shown the state of the world, that it is fast filling up its cup\nof iniquity. Violence and crime of every description are filling our\nworld, and Satan is using every means to make crime and debasing\nvice popular. The youth who walk the streets are surrounded with\nhandbills and notices of crime and sin, presented in some novel or to\nbe acted at some theater. Their minds are educated into familiarity\nwith sin. The course pursued by the base and vile is kept before[472]\nthem in the periodicals of the day, and everything which can excite\ncuriosity and arouse the animal passions is brought before them in\nthrilling and exciting stories.\nThe literature that proceeds from corrupted intellects poisons\nthe minds of thousands in our world. Sin does not appear exceeding\nsinful. They hear and read so much of debasing crime and vileness\nthat the once tender conscience which would have recoiled with\nhorror becomes so blunted that it can dwell upon the low and vile\nsayings and actions of men with greedy interest.\n\u201cAs it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days\nof the Son of man.\u201d God will have a people zealous of good works,\nstanding firm amid the pollutions of this degenerate age. There will\nbe a people who hold so fast to the divine strength that they will\nbe proof against every temptation. Evil communications in flaming\nhandbills may seek to speak to their senses and corrupt their minds;\nyet they will be so united to God and angels that they will be as those\nwho see not and hear not. They have a work to do which no one can\ndo for them, which is to fight the good fight of faith, and lay hold\non eternal life. They will not be self-confident and self-sufficient.\nKnowing their weakness, they will unite their ignorance to Christ\u2019s\nwisdom, their weakness to His strength.\nThe youth may have principles so firm that the most powerful\ntemptations of Satan will not draw them away from their allegiance.\nSamuel was a child surrounded by the most corrupting influences.\nHe saw and heard things that grieved his soul. The sons of Eli,\n442\nState of the World 443\nwho ministered in holy office, were controlled by Satan. These\nmen polluted the whole atmosphere which surrounded them. Men\nand women were daily fascinated with sin and wrong, yet Samuel\nwalked untainted. His robes of character were spotless. He did not\nfellowship, or have the least delight in, the sins which filled all Israel\nwith fearful reports. Samuel loved God; he kept his soul in such\nclose connection with heaven that an angel was sent to talk with him [473]\nin reference to the sins of Eli\u2019s sons, which were corrupting Israel.\nAppetite and passion are overcoming thousands of Christ\u2019s pro-\nfessed followers. Their senses become so blunted on account of\nfamiliarity with sin that they do not abhor it, but view it as attrac-\ntive. The end of all things is at hand. God will not much longer\nbear with the crimes and debasing iniquity of the children of men.\nTheir crimes have indeed reached unto the heavens and will soon be\nanswered by the fearful plagues of God upon the earth. They will\ndrink the cup of God\u2019s wrath unmixed with mercy.\nI have seen that there is danger that even the professed children\nof God will be corrupted. Licentiousness is binding men and women\nas captives. They seem to be infatuated and powerless to resist and\novercome upon the point of appetite and passion. In God there is\npower; in Him there is strength. If they will take hold upon it, the\nlife-giving power of Jesus will stimulate everyone who has named\nthe name of Christ. Dangers and perils surround us; and we are only\nsafe when we feel our weakness and cling with the grasp of faith\nto our mighty Deliverer. It is a fearful time in which we live. We\ncannot cease watchfulness and prayer for a moment. Our helpless\nsouls must rely on Jesus, our compassionate Redeemer.\nI was shown the greatness and importance of the work before\nus. But few realize the true state of things. All who are asleep,\nand who cannot realize any necessity for vigilance and alarm, will\nbe overcome. Young men are arising to engage in the work of\nGod, some of whom have scarcely any sense of the sacredness\nand responsibility of the work. They have but little experience in\nexercising faith and in earnest soul hunger for the Spirit of God,\nwhich ever brings returns. Some men of good capabilities, who\nmight fill important positions, do not know what spirit they are of.\nThey run in a jovial mood as naturally as water flows downhill.\nThey talk nonsense, and sport with young girls, while almost daily\n444 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nlistening to the most solemn, soul-stirring truths. These men have a[474]\nreligion of the head, but their hearts are not sanctified by the truths\nthey hear. Such can never lead others to the Fountain of living waters\nuntil they have drunk of the stream themselves.\nIt is no time now for lightness, vanity, or trifling. The scenes\nof this earth\u2019s history are soon to close. Minds that have been left\nto loose thought need change. Says the apostle Peter: \u201cGird up the\nloins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is\nto be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; as obedient\nchildren, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in\nyour ignorance: but as He which hath called you is holy, so be ye\nholy in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy;\nfor I am holy.\u201d\nLoose thoughts must be gathered up and centered on God. The\nvery thoughts should be in obedience to the will of God. Praise\nshould not be given or expected; for this will have a tendency to\nfoster self-confidence rather than to increase humility, to corrupt\nrather than to purify. Men who are really qualified and who feel that\nthey have a part to act in connection with the work of God will feel\npressed beneath the sense of the sacredness of the work, as a cart\nbeneath sheaves. Now is the time to make the most earnest efforts\nto overcome the natural feelings of the carnal heart.\n* * * * *\nChapter 40\u2014The State of the Church\nThere is great necessity for a reformation among the people\nof God. The present state of the church leads to the inquiry: Is\nthis a correct representation of Him who gave His life for us? Are\nthese the followers of Christ and the brethren of those who counted\nnot their lives dear unto themselves? Those who come up to the\nBible standard, the Bible description of Christ\u2019s followers, will be\nfound rare indeed. Having forsaken God, the Fountain of living\nwaters, they have hewn them out cisterns, \u201cbroken cisterns, that\ncan hold no water.\u201d Said the angel: \u201cLack of love and faith are [475]\nthe great sins of which God\u2019s people are now guilty.\u201d Lack of faith\nleads to carelessness and to love of self and the world. Those who\nseparate themselves from God and fall under temptation indulge\nin gross vices, for the carnal heart leads to great wickedness. And\nthis state of things is found among many of God\u2019s professed people.\nWhile they are professedly serving God they are to all intents and\npurposes corrupting their ways before Him. Appetite and passion\nare indulged by many, notwithstanding the clear light of truth points\nout the danger and lifts its warning voice: Beware, restrain, deny.\n\u201cThe wages of sin is death.\u201d Although the example of those who\nhave made shipwreck of faith stands as a beacon to warn others\nfrom pursuing the same course, yet many rush madly on. Satan has\ncontrol of their minds and seems to have power over their bodies.\nOh, how many flatter themselves that they have goodness and\nrighteousness, when the true light of God reveals that all their lives\nthey have only lived to please themselves! Their whole conduct is\nabhorred of God. How many are alive without the law! In their gross\ndarkness they view themselves with complacency; but let the law\nof God be revealed to their consciences, as it was to Paul, and they\nwould see that they are sold under sin and must die to the carnal\nmind. Self must be slain.\nHow sad and fearful the mistakes that many are making! They\nare building on the sand, but flatter themselves that they are riveted\n445\n446 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nto the eternal Rock. Many who profess godliness are rushing on\nas recklessly, and are as insensible of their danger, as though there\nwere no future judgment. A fearful retribution awaits them, and yet\nthey are controlled by impulse and gross passion; they are filling out\na dark life record for the judgment. I lift my voice of warning to all\nwho name the name of Christ to depart from all iniquity. Purify your\nsouls by obeying the truth. Cleanse yourselves from all filthiness of\nthe flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. You to\nwhom this applies know what I mean. Even you who have corrupted[476]\nyour ways before the Lord, partaken of the iniquity that abounds,\nand blackened your souls with sin, Jesus still invites you to turn from\nyour course, take hold of His strength, and find in Him that peace,\npower, and grace that will make you more than conquerors in His\nname.\nThe corruptions of this degenerate age have stained many souls\nwho have been professedly serving God. But even now it is not too\nlate for wrongs to be righted and for the blood of a crucified and\nrisen Saviour to atone in your behalf if you repent and feel your need\nof pardon. We need now to watch and pray as never before, lest we\nfall under the power of temptation and leave the example of a life\nthat is a miserable wreck. We must not, as a people, become careless\nand look upon sin with indifference. The camp needs purging. All\nwho name the name of Christ need to watch and pray and guard the\navenues of the soul; for Satan is at work to corrupt and destroy if the\nleast advantage is given him.\nMy brethren, God calls upon you as His followers to walk in\nthe light. You need to be alarmed. Sin is among us, and it is not\nseen to be exceedingly sinful. The senses of many are benumbed by\nthe indulgence of appetite and by familiarity with sin. We need to\nadvance nearer heaven. We may grow in grace and in the knowledge\nof the truth. Walking in the light, running in the way of God\u2019s\ncommandments, does not give the idea that we can stand still and\ndo nothing. We must be advancing.\nIn self-love, self-exaltation, and pride there is great weakness;\nbut in humility there is great strength. Our true dignity is not main-\ntained when we think most of ourselves, but when God is in all our\nthoughts and our hearts are all aglow with love to our Redeemer and\nlove to our fellow men. Simplicity of character and lowliness of\nState of the Church 447\nheart will give happiness, while self-conceit will bring discontent,\nrepining, and continual disappointment. It is learning to think less\nof ourselves and more of making others happy that will bring to us\ndivine strength.\nIn our separation from God, in our pride and darkness, we are [477]\nconstantly seeking to elevate ourselves, and we forget that lowliness\nof mind is power. Our Saviour\u2019s power was not in a strong array\nof sharp words that would pierce through the very soul; it was His\ngentleness and His plain, unassuming manners that made Him a\nconqueror of hearts. Pride and self-importance, when compared\nwith lowliness and humility, are indeed weakness. We are invited\nto learn of Him who was meek and lowly of heart; then we shall\nexperience that rest and peace so much to be desired.\n* * * * *\nChapter 41\u2014Love of the World\nThe temptation that was presented by Satan to our Saviour upon\nthe exceeding high mountain is one of the leading temptations which\nhumanity must meet. The kingdoms of the world in their glory were\noffered to Christ by Satan as a gift upon condition that Christ would\nyield to him the honor due to a superior. Our Saviour felt the strength\nof this temptation, but He met it in our behalf and conquered. He\nwould not have been tested upon this point if man were not to be\ntried with the same temptation. In His resistance, He gave us an\nexample of the course that we should pursue when Satan should\ncome to us individually to lead us from our integrity.\nNo man can be a follower of Christ and yet place his affections\nupon the things of the world. John in his first epistle writes: \u201cLove\nnot the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man\nlove the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\u201d Our Redeemer,\nwho met this temptation of Satan in its fullest power, is acquainted\nwith man\u2019s danger of yielding to the temptation to love the world.\nChrist identified Himself with humanity by bearing the test upon\nthis point and overcoming in man\u2019s behalf. He has guarded with\nwarnings those very points where Satan would best succeed in his\ntemptations to man. He knew that Satan would gain the victory over[478]\nman unless he was especially guarded upon the points of appetite\nand the love of worldly riches and honor. He says: \u201cLay not up for\nyourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt,\nand where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves\ntreasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and\nwhere thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure\nis, there will your heart be also.\u201d \u201cNo man can serve two masters:\nfor either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will\nhold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and\nmammon.\u201d\nHere Christ has brought before us two masters, God and the\nworld, and has plainly presented the fact that it is simply impossible\n448\nLove of the World 449\nfor us to serve both. If our interest in, and love for, this world\npredominate, we shall not appreciate the things, which, above all\nothers, are worthy of our attention. The love of the world will\nexclude the love of God and make our highest interests subordinate\nto worldly considerations. Thus God will not hold so exalted a place\nin our affections and devotions as do the things of the world.\nOur works will show the exact extent to which earthly treasures\nhave our affections. The greatest care, anxiety, and labor are devoted\nto worldly interests, while eternal considerations are made secondary.\nHere Satan receives of man that homage which he claimed of Christ\nbut failed to obtain. It is the selfish love of the world which corrupts\nthe faith of the professed followers of Christ and makes them weak\nin moral power. The more they love their earthly riches, the further\nthey depart from God, and the less do they partake of His divine\nnature that would give them a sense of the corrupting influences in\nthe world and the dangers to which they are exposed.\nIn Satan\u2019s temptations it is his purpose to make the world very\nattractive. Through love of riches and worldly honor he has a be-\nwitching power to gain the affections of even the professed Christian\nworld. A large class of professedly Christian men will make any [479]\nsacrifice to gain riches, and the better they succeed in their object\nthe less love they have for precious truth and the less interest for its\nadvancement. They lose their love for God and act like insane men.\nThe more they are prospered in securing riches the poorer they feel\nbecause they have no more, and the less will they invest in the cause\nof God.\nThe works of those men who have an insane love for riches\nshow that it is not possible for them to serve two masters, God and\nmammon. Money is their god. They yield homage to its power.\nThey serve the world to all intents and purposes. Their honor, which\nis their birthright, is sacrificed for worldly gain. This ruling power\ncontrols their minds, and they will violate the law of God to serve\npersonal interests, to increase their earthly treasure.\nMany may profess the religion of Christ who love not and heed\nnot the letter or principles of Christ\u2019s teachings. They give the best\nof their strength to worldly pursuits and bow down to mammon. It is\nalarming that so many are deceived by Satan and their imaginations\nexcited by their brilliant prospects of worldly gain. They become\n450 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ninfatuated with the prospect of perfect happiness if they can gain\ntheir object in acquiring honor and wealth in the world. Satan tempts\nthem with the alluring bribe, \u201cAll this will I give thee,\u201d all this power,\nall this wealth, with which you may do a great amount of good. But\nwhen the object for which they have labored is gained, they do not\nhave that connection with the self-denying Redeemer which would\nmake them partakers of the divine nature. They hold to their earthly\ntreasures and despise the self-denial and self-sacrifice required for\nChrist. They have no desire to part with the dear earthly treasures\nupon which their hearts are set. They have exchanged masters; they\nhave accepted mammon in the place of Christ. Mammon is their\ngod, and mammon they serve.\nSatan has secured to himself the worship of these deceived souls\nthrough their love of riches. The change has been so imperceptibly[480]\nmade, and Satan\u2019s power is so deceptive, so wily, that they are\nconformed to the world and perceive not that they have parted with\nChrist and are no longer His servants except in name.\nSatan deals with men more guardedly than he dealt with Christ\nin the wilderness of temptation, for he is admonished that he there\nlost his case. He is a conquered foe. He does not come to man\ndirectly and demand homage by outward worship. He simply asks\nmen to place their affections upon the good things of this world.\nIf he succeeds in engaging the mind and affections, the heavenly\nattractions are eclipsed. All he wants of man is for him to fall under\nthe deceitful power of his temptations, to love the world, to love\nrank and position, to love money, and to place his affections upon\nearthly treasures. If he secures this, he gains all that he asked of\nChrist.\nThe example of Christ shows us that our only hope of victory\nis in continual resistance of Satan\u2019s attacks. He who triumphed\nover the adversary of souls in the conflict of temptation understands\nSatan\u2019s power over the race and has conquered him in our behalf.\nAs an overcomer He has given us the advantage of His victory, that\nin our efforts to resist the temptations of Satan we may unite our\nweakness to His strength, our worthlessness to His merits. And,\nsustained by His enduring might under strong temptation, we may\nresist in His all-powerful name and overcome as He overcame.\nLove of the World 451\nIt was through inexpressible suffering that our Redeemer placed\nredemption within our reach. In this world He was unhonored and\nunknown, that through His wonderful condescension and humiliation\nHe might exalt man to receive heavenly honors and immortal joys\nin His kingly courts. Will fallen man murmur because heaven can\nbe obtained only by conflict, self-abasement, and toil?\nThe inquiry of many a proud heart is: Why need I go in humilia-\ntion and penitence before I can have the assurance of my acceptance\nwith God, and attain the immortal reward? Why is not the path\nto heaven less difficult and more pleasant and attractive? We refer\nall these doubting, murmuring ones to our great Exemplar while [481]\nsuffering under the load of man\u2019s guilt and enduring the keenest\npangs of hunger. He was sinless, and more than this, He was the\nPrince of heaven; but in man\u2019s behalf He became sin for the race.\n\u201cHe was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our\niniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with\nHis stripes we are healed.\u201d\nChrist sacrificed everything for man in order to make it possible\nfor him to gain heaven. Now it is for fallen man to show what he\nwill sacrifice on his own account for Christ\u2019s sake, that he may win\nimmortal glory. Those who have any just sense of the magnitude of\nsalvation and of its cost will never murmur that their sowing must be\nin tears and that conflict and self-denial are the Christian\u2019s portion\nin this life. The conditions of salvation for man are ordained of God.\nSelf-abasement and cross bearing are the provisions made by which\nthe repenting sinner is to find comfort and peace. The thought that\nJesus submitted to humiliation and sacrifice that man will never be\ncalled to endure, should hush every murmuring voice. The sweet-\nest joy comes to man through his sincere repentance toward God\nbecause of the transgression of His law, and faith in Christ as the\nsinner\u2019s Redeemer and Advocate.\nMen labor at great cost to secure the treasures of this life. They\nsuffer toil and endure hardships and privations to gain some worldly\nadvantage. Why should the sinner be less willing to endure, to suffer,\nand to sacrifice in order to secure an imperishable treasure, a life that\nruns parallel with the life of God, a crown of immortal glory that\nfadeth not away? The infinite treasures of heaven, the inheritance\nwhich passes all estimate in value, which is an eternal weight of\n452 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nglory, must be obtained by us at any cost. We should not murmur\nat self-denial, for the Lord of life and glory endured it before us.\nSuffering and deprivation we should not avoid, for the Majesty of\nheaven accepted these in behalf of sinners. Sacrifice of ease and\nconvenience should not cause one thought of repining, because the\nworld\u2019s Redeemer accepted all these in our behalf. Making the\nlargest estimate of all our self-denials, privations, and sacrifices, it[482]\ncosts us far less in every respect than it did the Prince of life. Any\nsacrifice that we may make sinks into insignificance when compared\nwith that which Christ made in our behalf.\n* * * * *\nChapter 42\u2014Presumption\nThere are those who have a reckless spirit, which they term\ncourage and bravery. They needlessly place themselves in scenes\nof danger and peril, thus exposing themselves to temptations out of\nwhich it would require a miracle of God to bring them unharmed\nand untainted. Satan\u2019s temptation to the Saviour of the world to\ncast Himself from the pinnacle of the temple was firmly met and\nresisted. Satan quoted a promise of God as security that Christ might\nwith safety do this on the strength of the promise. Christ met the\ntemptation with scripture: \u201cIt is written, ... Thou shalt not tempt\nthe Lord thy God.\u201d The only safe course for Christians is to repulse\nthe enemy with God\u2019s word. Satan urges men into places where\nGod does not require them to go, and presents scripture to justify\nhis suggestions.\nGod\u2019s precious promises are not given to strengthen man in\na presumptuous course or for him to rely upon when he rushes\nneedlessly into danger. The Lord requires us to move with a humble\ndependence upon His providence. \u201cIt is not in man that walketh\nto direct his steps.\u201d In God is our prosperity and our life. Nothing\ncan be done prosperously without the permission and blessing of\nGod. He can set His hand to prosper and bless, or He can turn\nHis hand against us. \u201cCommit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in\nHim; and He shall bring it to pass.\u201d We are required, as children\nof God, to maintain a consistent Christian character. We should\nexercise prudence, caution, and humility, and walk circumspectly\ntoward them that are without. Yet we are not in any case to surrender\nprinciple.\nOur only safety is in giving no place to the devil, for his\nsuggestions and purposes are ever to injure us and hinder us from [483]\nrelying upon God. He transforms himself into an angel of purity\nthat he may, through his specious temptations, introduce his devices\nin such a manner that we may not discern his wiles. The more we\nyield, the more powerful will be his deceptions over us. It is unsafe\n453\n454 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nto enter into controversy or to parley with him. For every advantage\nthat we give the enemy, he will claim more. Our only safety is in\nrejecting firmly the first approach to presumption. God has, through\nthe merits of Christ, given us sufficient grace to withstand Satan and\nbe more than conquerors. Resistance is success. \u201cResist the devil,\nand he will flee from you.\u201d Resistance must be firm and steadfast.\nWe lose all we gain if we resist today only to yield tomorrow.\nThe sin of this age is disregard of God\u2019s express commands. The\npower of influence in a wrong direction is very great. Eve had all\nthat her wants required. There was nothing lacking to make her\nhappy, but intemperate appetite desired the fruit of the only tree\nthat God had withheld. She had no need of the fruit of the tree of\nknowledge, but she permitted her appetite and curiosity to control her\nreason. She was perfectly happy in her Eden home by her husband\u2019s\nside; but, like restless modern Eves, she was flattered that there\nwas a higher sphere than that which God had assigned her. But in\nattempting to climb higher than her original position, she fell far\nbelow it. This will most assuredly be the result with the Eves of the\npresent generation if they neglect to cheerfully take up their daily\nlife duties in accordance with God\u2019s plan.\nThere is a work for women that is even more important and\nelevating than the duties of the king upon his throne. They may\nmold the minds of their children and shape their characters so that\nthey may be useful in this world and that they may become sons\nand daughters of God. Their time should be considered too valuable\nto be passed in the ballroom or in needless labor. There is enough\nnecessary and important labor in this world of need and suffering\nwithout wasting precious moments for ornamentation or display.[484]\nDaughters of the heavenly King, members of the royal family, will\nfeel a burden of responsibility to attain to a higher life, that they may\nbe brought into close connection with heaven and work in unison\nwith the Redeemer of the world. Those who are engaged in this\nwork will not be satisfied with the fashions and follies which absorb\nthe mind and affections of women in these last days. If they are\nindeed the daughters of God they will be partakers of the divine\nnature. They will be stirred with deepest pity, as was their divine\nRedeemer, as they see the corrupting influences in society. They\nwill be in sympathy with Christ, and in their sphere, as they have\nPresumption 455\nability and opportunity, will work to save perishing souls as Christ\nworked in His exalted sphere for the benefit of man.\nA neglect on the part of woman to follow God\u2019s plan in her\ncreation, an effort to reach for important positions which He has not\nqualified her to fill, leaves vacant the position that she could fill to\nacceptance. In getting out of her sphere, she loses true womanly\ndignity and nobility. When God created Eve, He designed that she\nshould possess neither inferiority nor superiority to the man, but that\nin all things she should be his equal. The holy pair were to have no\ninterest independent of each other; and yet each had an individuality\nin thinking and acting. But after Eve\u2019s sin, as she was first in the\ntransgression, the Lord told her that Adam should rule over her. She\nwas to be in subjection to her husband, and this was a part of the\ncurse. In many cases the curse has made the lot of woman very\ngrievous and her life a burden. The superiority which God has given\nman he has abused in many respects by exercising arbitrary power.\nInfinite wisdom devised the plan of redemption, which places the\nrace on a second probation by giving them another trial.\nSatan uses men as his agents to lead to presumption those who\nlove God; especially is this the case with those who are deluded\nby spiritualism. Spiritualists generally do not accept Christ as the\nSon of God, and through their infidelity they lead many souls to [485]\npresumptuous sins. They even claim superiority over Christ as did\nSatan in contesting with the Prince of life. Spiritualists whose souls\nare dyed with sins of a revolting character, and whose consciences\nare seared, dare to take the name of the spotless Son of God in their\npolluted lips and blasphemously unite His most exalted name with\nthe vileness which marks their own polluted natures.\nMen who bring in these damnable heresies will dare those who\nteach the word of God to enter into controversy with them, and some\nwho teach the truth have not had the courage to withstand a challenge\nfrom this class, who are marked characters in the word of God. Some\nof our ministers have not had the moral courage to say to these men:\nGod has warned us in His word in regard to you. He has given us a\nfaithful description of your character and of the heresies which you\nhold. Some of our ministers, rather than give this class any occasion\nto triumph or to charge them with cowardice, have met them in\nopen discussion. But in discussing with spiritualists they do not\n456 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nmeet man merely, but Satan and his angels. They place themselves\nin communication with the powers of darkness and encourage evil\nangels about them.\nSpiritualists desire to give publicity to their heresies; and minis-\nters who advocate Bible truth help them to do this when they consent\nto engage in discussion with them. They improve their opportunities\nto get their heresies before the people, and in every discussion with\nthem some will be deceived. The very best course for us to pursue\nis to avoid them.\n* * * * *\nChapter 43\u2014Power of Appetite\nOne of the strongest temptations that man has to meet is upon\nthe point of appetite. Between the mind and the body there is a\nmysterious and wonderful relation. They react upon each other. To\nkeep the body in a healthy condition to develop its strength, that\nevery part of the living machinery may act harmoniously, should be [486]\nthe first study of our life. To neglect the body is to neglect the mind.\nIt cannot be to the glory of God for His children to have sickly bodies\nor dwarfed minds. To indulge the taste at the expense of health is\na wicked abuse of the senses. Those who engage in any species\nof intemperance, either in eating or drinking, waste their physical\nenergies and weaken moral power. They will feel the retribution\nwhich follows the transgression of physical law.\nThe Redeemer of the world knew that the indulgence of appetite\nwould bring physical debility, and so deaden the perceptive organs\nthat sacred and eternal things would not be discerned. Christ knew\nthat the world was given up to gluttony and that this indulgence\nwould pervert the moral powers. If the indulgence of appetite was so\nstrong upon the race that, in order to break its power, the divine Son\nof God, in behalf of man, was required to fast nearly six weeks, what\na work is before the Christian in order that he may overcome even as\nChrist overcame! The strength of the temptation to indulge perverted\nappetite can be measured only by the inexpressible anguish of Christ\nin that long fast in the wilderness.\nChrist knew that in order to successfully carry forward the plan\nof salvation He must commence the work of redeeming man just\nwhere the ruin began. Adam fell by the indulgence of appetite. In\norder to impress upon man his obligations to obey the law of God,\nChrist began His work of redemption by reforming the physical\nhabits of man. The declension in virtue and the degeneracy of the\nrace are chiefly attributable to the indulgence of perverted appetite.\nThere is a solemn responsibility upon all, especially upon min-\nisters who teach the truth, to overcome upon the point of appetite.\n457\n458 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nTheir usefulness would be much greater if they had control of their\nappetites and passions, and their mental and moral powers would\nbe stronger if they combined physical labor with mental exertion.\nWith strictly temperate habits, and with mental and physical labor\ncombined, they could accomplish a far greater amount of labor and\npreserve clearness of mind. If they would pursue such a course,[487]\ntheir thoughts and words would flow more freely, their religious\nexercises would be more energized, and the impressions made upon\ntheir hearers would be more marked.\nIntemperance in eating, even of food of the right quality, will\nhave a prostrating influence upon the system and will blunt the\nkeener and holier emotions. Strict temperance in eating and drinking\nis highly essential for the healthy preservation and vigorous exercise\nof all the functions of the body. Strictly temperate habits, combined\nwith exercise of the muscles as well as of the mind, will preserve\nboth mental and physical vigor, and give power of endurance to\nthose engaged in the ministry, to editors, and to all others whose\nhabits are sedentary. As a people, with all our profession of health\nreform, we eat too much. Indulgence of appetite is the greatest cause\nof physical and mental debility, and lies at the foundation of the\nfeebleness which is apparent everywhere.\nIntemperance commences at our tables in the use of unhealthful\nfood. After a time, through continued indulgence, the digestive\norgans become weakened, and the food taken does not satisfy the\nappetite. Unhealthy conditions are established, and there is a craving\nfor more stimulating food. Tea, coffee, and flesh meats produce an\nimmediate effect. Under the influence of these poisons the nervous\nsystem is excited, and, in some cases, for the time being, the intel-\nlect seems to be invigorated and the imagination to be more vivid.\nBecause these stimulants produce for the time being such agreeable\nresults, many conclude that they really need them and continue their\nuse. But there is always a reaction. The nervous system, having\nbeen unduly excited, borrowed power for present use from its fu-\nture resources of strength. All this temporary invigoration of the\nsystem is followed by depression. In proportion as these stimulants\ntemporarily invigorate the system will be the letting down of the\npower of the excited organs after the stimulus has lost its force. The\nappetite is educated to crave something stronger which will have\nPower of Appetite 459\na tendency to keep up and increase the agreeable excitement, un- [488]\ntil indulgence becomes habit, and there is a continual craving for\nstronger stimulus, as tobacco, wines, and liquors. The more the\nappetite is indulged, the more frequent will be its demands and the\nmore difficult of control. The more debilitated the system becomes\nand the less able to do without unnatural stimulus, the more the\npassion for these things increases, until the will is overborne, and\nthere seems to be no power to deny the unnatural craving for these\nindulgences.\nThe only safe course is to touch not, taste not, handle not, tea,\ncoffee, wines, tobacco, opium, and alcoholic drinks. The necessity\nfor the men of this generation to call to their aid the power of the\nwill, strengthened by the grace of God, in order to withstand the\ntemptations of Satan and resist the least indulgence of perverted\nappetite is twice as great as it was several generations ago. But the\npresent generation have less power of self-control than had those\nwho lived then. Those who have indulged the appetite for these\nstimulants have transmitted their depraved appetites and passions to\ntheir children, and greater moral power is required to resist intem-\nperance in all its forms. The only perfectly safe course to pursue is\nto stand firmly on the side of temperance and not venture in the path\nof danger.\nThe great end for which Christ endured that long fast in the\nwilderness was to teach us the necessity of self-denial and tem-\nperance. This work should commence at our tables and should be\nstrictly carried out in all the concerns of life. The Redeemer of the\nworld came from heaven to help man in his weakness, that, in the\npower which Jesus came to bring him, he might become strong to\novercome appetite and passion, and might be victor on every point.\nMany parents educate the tastes of their children and form their\nappetites. They indulge them in eating flesh meats and in drinking\ntea and coffee. The highly seasoned flesh meats and the tea and\ncoffee, which some mothers encourage their children to use, prepare\nthe way for them to crave stronger stimulants, as tobacco. The use\nof tobacco encourages the appetite for liquor, and the use of tobacco [489]\nand liquor invariably lessens nerve power.\nIf the moral sensibilities of Christians were aroused upon the\nsubject of temperance in all things, they could, by their example,\n460 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ncommencing at their tables, help those who are weak in self-control,\nwho are almost powerless to resist the cravings of appetite. If we\ncould realize that the habits we form in this life will affect our eternal\ninterests, that our eternal destiny depends upon strictly temperate\nhabits, we would work to the point of strict temperance in eating and\ndrinking. By our example and personal effort we may be the means\nof saving many souls from the degradation of intemperance, crime,\nand death. Our sisters can do much in the great work for the salvation\nof others by spreading their tables with only healthful, nourishing\nfood. They may employ their precious time in educating the tastes\nand appetites of their children, in forming habits of temperance in\nall things, and in encouraging self-denial and benevolence for the\ngood of others.\nNotwithstanding the example that Christ gave us in the wilder-\nness of temptation by denying appetite and overcoming its power,\nthere are many Christian mothers who by their example and by the\neducation which they are giving their children are preparing them to\nbecome gluttons and winebibbers. Children are frequently indulged\nin eating what they choose and when they choose, without reference\nto health. There are many children who are educated gourmands\nfrom their babyhood. Through indulgence of appetite they are made\ndyspeptics at an early age. Self-indulgence and intemperance in\neating grow with their growth and strengthen with their strength.\nMental and physical vigor are sacrificed through the indulgence of\nparents. A taste is formed for certain articles of food from which\nthey can receive no benefit, but only injury; and as the system is\ntaxed, the constitution becomes debilitated.\nMinisters, teachers, and students do not become as intelligent\nas they should in regard to the necessity of physical exercise in the\nopen air. They neglect this duty, which is most essential for the[490]\npreservation of health. They closely apply their minds to books\nand eat the allowance of a laboring man. Under such habits some\ngrow corpulent, because the system is clogged. Others become\nlean, feeble, and weak because their vital powers are exhausted in\nthrowing off the excess of food; the liver becomes burdened and\nunable to throw off the impurities in the blood, and sickness is the\nresult. If physical exercise were combined with mental exertion, the\nblood would be quickened in its circulation, the action of the heart\nPower of Appetite 461\nwould be more perfect, impure matter would be thrown off, and new\nlife and vigor would be experienced in every part of the body.\nWhen the minds of ministers, schoolteachers, and students are\ncontinually excited by study, and the body is allowed to be inactive,\nthe nerves of emotion are taxed, while the nerves of motion are\ninactive. The wear being all upon the mental organs, they become\noverworked and enfeebled, while the muscles lose their vigor for\nwant of employment. There is no inclination to exercise the muscles\nby engaging in physical labor because exertion seems to be irksome.\nMinisters of Christ, professing to be His representatives, should\nfollow His example, and above all others should form habits of\nstrictest temperance. They should keep the life and example of Christ\nbefore the people by their own lives of self-denial, self-sacrifice, and\nactive benevolence. Christ overcame appetite in man\u2019s behalf, and\nin His stead they are to set others an example worthy of imitation.\nThose who do not feel the necessity of engaging in the work of\novercoming upon the point of appetite will fail to secure precious\nvictories which they might have gained and will become slaves to\nappetite and lust, which are filling the cup of iniquity of those who\ndwell upon the earth.\nMen who are engaged in giving the last message of warning to\nthe world, a message which is to decide the destiny of souls, should\nmake a practical application in their own lives of the truths they\npreach to others. They should be examples to the people in their\neating, in their drinking, and in their chaste conversation and deport- [491]\nment. Gluttony, indulgence of the baser passions, and grievous sins\nare hidden under the garb of sanctity by many professed represen-\ntatives of Christ throughout our world. There are men of excellent\nnatural ability whose labor does not accomplish half what it might if\nthey were temperate in all things. Indulgence of appetite and passion\nbeclouds the mind, lessens physical strength, and weakens moral\npower. Their thoughts are not clear. Their words are not spoken in\npower, are not vitalized by the Spirit of God so as to reach the hearts\nof the hearers.\nAs our first parents lost Eden through the indulgence of appetite,\nour only hope of regaining Eden is through the firm denial of appetite\nand passion. Abstemiousness in diet and control of all the passions\nwill preserve the intellect and give mental and moral vigor, enabling\n462 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nmen to bring all their propensities under the control of the higher\npowers and to discern between right and wrong, the sacred and the\ncommon. All who have a true sense of the sacrifice made by Christ\nin leaving His home in heaven to come to this world that He might\nby His own life show man how to resist temptation will cheerfully\ndeny self and choose to be partakers with Christ of His sufferings.\nThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Those who\novercome as Christ overcame will need to constantly guard them-\nselves against the temptations of Satan. The appetite and passions\nshould be restricted and under the control of enlightened conscience,\nthat the intellect may be unimpaired, the perceptive powers clear, so\nthat the workings of Satan and his snares may not be interpreted to\nbe the providence of God. Many desire the final reward and victory\nwhich are to be given to overcomers, but are not willing to endure\ntoil, privation, and denial of self, as did their Redeemer. It is only\nthrough obedience and continual effort that we shall overcome as\nChrist overcame.\nThe controlling power of appetite will prove the ruin of thou-\nsands, when, if they had conquered on this point, they would have[492]\nhad moral power to gain the victory over every other temptation of\nSatan. But those who are slaves to appetite will fail in perfecting\nChristian character. The continual transgression of man for six thou-\nsand years has brought sickness, pain, and death as its fruits. And\nas we near the close of time, Satan\u2019s temptation to indulge appetite\nwill be more powerful and more difficult to overcome.\n* * * * *\nChapter 44\u2014Leadership\nBrother A, your experience in reference to leadership two years\nago was for your own benefit and was highly essential to you. You\nhad very marked, decided views in regard to individual independence\nand right to private judgment. These views you carry to extremes.\nYou reason that you must have light and evidence for yourself in\nreference to your duty.\nI have been shown that no man\u2019s judgment should be surren-\ndered to the judgment of any one man. But when the judgment of\nthe General Conference, which is the highest authority that God\nhas upon the earth, is exercised, private independence and private\njudgment must not be maintained, but be surrendered. Your error\nwas in persistently maintaining your private judgment of your duty\nagainst the voice of the highest authority the Lord has upon the earth.\nAfter you had taken your own time, and after the work had been\nmuch hindered by your delay, you came to Battle Creek in answer\nto the repeated and urgent calls of the General Conference. You\nfirmly maintained that you had done right in following your own\nconvictions of duty. You considered it a virtue in you to persistently\nmaintain your position of independence. You did not seem to have a\ntrue sense of the power that God has given to His church in the voice\nof the General Conference. You thought that in responding to the\ncall made to you by the General Conference you were submitting to\nthe judgment and mind of one man. You accordingly manifested an\nindependence, a set, willful spirit, which was all wrong.\nGod gave you a precious experience at that time which was of [493]\nvalue to you, and which has greatly increased your success as a\nminister of Christ. Your proud, unyielding will was subdued. You\nhad a genuine conversion. This led to reflection and to your position\nupon leadership. Your principles in regard to leadership are right,\nbut you do not make the right application of them. If you should\nlet the power in the church, the voice and judgment of the General\nConference, stand in the place you have given my husband, there\n463\n464 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ncould then be no fault found with your position. But you greatly\nerr in giving to one man\u2019s mind and judgment that authority and\ninfluence which God has invested in His church in the judgment and\nvoice of the General Conference.\nWhen this power which God has placed in the church is accred-\nited to one man, and he is invested with the authority to be judgment\nfor other minds, then the true Bible order is changed. Satan\u2019s ef-\nforts upon such a man\u2019s mind will be most subtle and sometimes\noverpowering, because through this mind he thinks he can affect\nmany others. Your position on leadership is correct, if you give to\nthe highest organized authority in the church what you have given to\none man. God never designed that His work should bear the stamp\nof one man\u2019s mind and one man\u2019s judgment.\nThe great reason why Brethren B and C are at this time deficient\nin the experience they should now have is because they have not been\nself-reliant. They have shunned responsibilities because in assuming\nthem their deficiencies would be brought to the light. They have been\ntoo willing to have my husband lead out and bear responsibilities,\nand have allowed him to be mind and judgment for them. These\nbrethren are weak where they should be strong. They have not dared\nto follow their own independent judgment, lest they should make\nmistakes and be blamed for it, while they have stood ready to be\ntempted and to make my husband responsible if they thought they\ncould see mistakes in his course. They have not lifted the burdens\nwith him. They have referred continually to my husband, making\nhim bear the responsibilities which they should have shared with[494]\nhim, until they are weak in those qualifications wherein they should\nbe strong. They are weak in moral power when they might be giants,\nqualified to stand as pillars in the cause of God.\nThese brethren have not self-reliance, or confidence that God\nwill indeed lead them if they follow the light He has given them. God\nnever intended that strong, independent men of superior intellect\nshould cling to others for support as the ivy clings to the oak. All\nthe difficulties, the backsets, the hardships, and the disappointments\nwhich God\u2019s servants will meet in active labor will only strengthen\nthem in the formation of correct characters. By putting their own\nenergies of mind to use, the obstacles they meet will prove to them\npositive blessings. They will gain mental and spiritual muscle to be\nLeadership 465\nused upon important occasions with the very best results. They will\nlearn self-reliance and will gain confidence in their own experience\nthat God is really leading and guiding them. And as they meet\nperil and have real anguish of spirit they are obliged to meditate\nand are made to feel the necessity of prayer in their effort to move\nunderstandingly and work to advantage in the cause of God; they\nfind that conflict and perplexity call for the exercise of faith and trust\nin God, and for that firmness which develops power. Necessities\nare constantly arising for new ways and means to meet emergencies.\nFaculties are called into use that would lie dormant were it not for\nthese pressing necessities in the work of God. This gives a varied\nexperience so that there will be no use for men of one idea and those\nwho are only half developed.\nMen of might and power in this cause, whom God will use to\nHis glory, are those who have been opposed, baffled, and thwarted in\ntheir plans. Brethren B and C might have turned their own failures\ninto important victories; but, instead of this, they have shunned the\nresponsibilities which would make liability to mistakes possible.\nThese precious brethren have failed to gain that education which is\nstrengthened by experience and which reading and study and all the [495]\nadvantages otherwise gained will never give them.\nYou, Brother A, have had strength to bear some responsibilities.\nGod has accepted your energetic labors and blessed your efforts.\nYou have made some mistakes, but because of some failures you\nshould in nowise misjudge your capabilities nor distrust the strength\nthat you may find in God. You have not been willing and ready to\nassume responsibilities. You are naturally inclined to shun them and\nto choose an easier position, to write and exercise the mind where no\nspecial, vital interests are involved. You make a mistake in relying\nupon my husband to tell you what to do. This is not the work God\nhas given my husband. You should search out what is to be done\nand lift the disagreeable burdens yourself. God will bless you in\nso doing. You must bear burdens in connection with the work of\nGod according to your best judgment. But you must be guarded, lest\nyour judgment shall be influenced by the opinions of others. If it is\napparent that you have made mistakes, it is your privilege to turn\nthese failures into victories by avoiding the same in the future. By\n466 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nbeing told what to do you will never gain the experience necessary\nfor any important position.\nThe same is applicable to all who are standing in the different\npositions of trust in the various offices at Battle Creek. They are\nnot to be coaxed and petted and helped at every turn, for this will\nnot make men competent for important positions. It is obstacles\nthat make men strong. It is not helps, but difficulties, conflicts,\nrebuffs, that make men of moral sinew. Too much ease and avoiding\nresponsibility have made weaklings and dwarfs of those who ought\nto be responsible men of moral power and strong spiritual muscle.\nMen who ought to be as true in every emergency as the needle to\nthe pole, have become inefficient by their efforts to shield themselves\nfrom censure and by evading responsibilities for fear of failure. Men\nof giant intellect are babes in discipline because they are cowardly[496]\nin regard to taking and bearing the burdens they should. They\nare neglecting to become efficient. They have too long trusted\none man to plan for them and to do the thinking which they are\nhighly capable of doing themselves in the interest of the cause of\nGod. Mental deficiencies meet us at every point. Men who are\ncontent to let others plan and do their thinking for them are not\nfully developed. If they were left to plan for themselves they would\nbe found judicious, close-calculating men. But when brought into\nconnection with God\u2019s cause, it is entirely another thing to them;\nthey lose this faculty almost altogether. They are content to remain\nas incompetent and inefficient as though others must do the planning\nand much of the thinking for them. Some men appear to be utterly\nunable to hew out a path for themselves. Must they ever rely upon\nothers to do their planning and their studying, and to be mind and\njudgment for them? God is ashamed of such soldiers. He is not\nhonored by their having any part to act in His work while they are\nmere machines.\nIndependent men of earnest endeavor are needed, not men as\nimpressible as putty. Those who want their work made ready to\ntheir hand, who desire a fixed amount to do and a fixed salary, and\nwho wish to prove an exact fit without the trouble of adaptation or\ntraining, are not the men whom God calls to work in His cause. A\nman who cannot adapt his abilities to almost any place if necessity\nrequires is not the man for this time. Men whom God will connect\nLeadership 467\nwith His work are not limp and fiberless, without muscle or moral\nforce of character. It is only by continued and persevering labor that\nmen can be disciplined to bear a part in the work of God. These men\nshould not become discouraged if circumstances and surroundings\nare the most unfavorable. They should not give up their purpose as\na complete failure until they are convinced beyond a doubt that they\ncannot do much for the honor of God and the good of souls.\nThere are men who flatter themselves that they might do some-\nthing great and good if they were only circumstanced differently,\nwhile they make no use of the faculties they already have by working [497]\nin the positions where Providence has placed them. Man can make\nhis circumstances, but circumstances should never make the man.\nMan should seize circumstances as his instruments with which to\nwork. He should master circumstances, but should never allow cir-\ncumstances to master him. Individual independence and individual\npower are the qualities now needed. Individual character need not\nbe sacrificed, but it should be modulated, refined, elevated.\nI have been shown that it is my husband\u2019s duty to lay off the\nresponsibilities which others would be glad to have him bear be-\ncause it excuses them from many difficulties. My husband\u2019s ready\njudgment and clear discernment, which have been gained through\ntraining and exercise, have led him to take on many burdens which\nothers should have borne.\nBrother A, you are too slow. You should cultivate opposite\nqualities. The cause of God demands men who can see quickly and\nact instantaneously at the right time and with power. If you wait\nto measure every difficulty and balance every perplexity you meet\nyou will do but little. You will have obstacles and difficulties to\nencounter at every turn, and you must with firm purpose decide to\nconquer them, or they will conquer you.\nSometimes various ways and purposes, different modes of oper-\nation in connection with the work of God, are about evenly balanced\nin the mind; but it is at this very point that the nicest discrimination is\nnecessary. And if anything is accomplished to the purpose it must be\ndone at the golden moment. The slightest inclination of the weight\nin the balance should be seen and should determine the matter at\nonce. Long delays tire the angels. It is even more excusable to\nmake a wrong decision sometimes than to be continually in a waver-\n468 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ning position, to be hesitating, sometimes inclined in one direction,\nthen in another. More perplexity and wretchedness result from thus\nhesitating and doubting than from sometimes moving too hastily.\nI have been shown that the most signal victories and the most\nfearful defeats have been on the turn of minutes. God requires[498]\npromptness of action. Delays, doubtings, hesitation, and indecision\nfrequently give the enemy every advantage. My brother, you need\nto reform. The timing of things may tell much in favor of truth.\nVictories are frequently lost through delays. There will be crises\nin this cause. Prompt and decisive action at the right time will\ngain glorious triumphs, while delay and neglect will result in great\nfailures and positive dishonor to God. Rapid movements at the\ncritical moment often disarm the enemy, and he is disappointed\nand vanquished, for he had expected time to lay plans and work by\nartifice.\nGod wants men connected with His work in Battle Creek whose\njudgment is at hand, whose minds, when it is necessary, will act\nlike the lightnings. The greatest promptness is positively necessary\nin the hour of peril and danger. Every plan may be well laid to\naccomplish certain results, and yet a delay of a very short time may\nleave things to assume an entirely different shape, and the great\nobjects which might have been gained are lost through lack of quick\nforesight and prompt dispatch. Much may be done in training the\nmind to overcome indolence. There are times when caution and\ngreat deliberation are necessary; rashness would be folly. But even\nhere, much has been lost by too great hesitancy. Caution, up to\na certain point, is required; but hesitancy and policy on particular\noccasions have been more disastrous than would have been a failure\nthrough rashness.\nMy brother, you need to cultivate promptness. Away with your\nhesitating manner. You are slow and neglect to seize the work and\naccomplish it. You must get out of this narrow manner of labor,\nfor it is of the wrong order. When unbelief takes hold of your soul,\nyour labor is of such a hesitating, halting, balancing kind that you\naccomplish nothing yourself and hinder others from doing. You\nhave just enough interest to see difficulties and start doubts, but have\nnot the interest or courage to overcome the difficulties or dispel the\ndoubts. At such times you need to surrender to God. You need\nLeadership 469\nforce of character and less stubbornness and set willfulness. This [499]\nslowness, this sluggishness of action, is one of the greatest defects\nin your character and stands in the way of your usefulness.\nYour slowness of decision in connection with the cause and work\nof God is sometimes painful. It is not at all necessary. Prompt and\ndecisive action may accomplish great results. You are generally\nwilling to work when you feel just like it, ready to do when you\ncan see clearly what is to be done; but you fail to be that benefit\nto the cause that you might be if you were prompt and decisive at\nthe critical moment, and would overcome the habit of hesitation\nand delay which has marked your character and which has greatly\nretarded the work of God. This defect, unless overcome, will prove,\nin instances of great crises, disastrous to the cause and fatal to your\nown soul. Punctuality and decisive action at the right time must\nbe acquired, for you have not these qualities. In the warfare and\nbattles of nations there is often more gained by good management\nin prompt action than in earnest, dead encounter with the enemy.\nThe ability to do business with dispatch, and yet do it thoroughly,\nis a great acquisition. My brother, you have really felt that your\ncautious, hesitating course was commendable, rather a virtue than a\nwrong. But from what the Lord has shown me in this matter, these\nsluggish movements on your part have greatly hindered the work\nof God and caused many things to be left undone which in justice\nought to have been done with promptness. It will be difficult now\nfor you to make the changes in your character which God requires\nyou to make, because it was difficult for you to be punctual and\nprompt of action in youth. When the character is formed, the habits\nfixed, and the mental and moral faculties have become firm, it is\nmost difficult to unlearn wrong habits, to be prompt in action. You\nshould realize the value of time. You are not excusable for leaving\nthe most important, though unpleasant work, hoping to get rid of\ndoing it altogether, or thinking that it will become less unpleasant,\nwhile you occupy your time upon pleasant matters not really taxing.\nYou should first do the work which must be done and which involves [500]\nthe vital interests of the cause, and only take up the less important\nmatters after the more essential are accomplished. Punctuality and\ndecision in the work and cause of God are highly essential. Delays\nare virtually defeats. Minutes are golden and should be improved\n470 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nto the very best account. Earthly relations and personal interests\nshould ever be secondary. Never should the cause of God be left to\nsuffer, in a single particular, because of our earthly friends or dearest\nrelatives.\n\u201cAnd He said to another, Follow Me. But he said, Lord, suffer\nme first to go and bury my father. Jesus said unto him, Let the dead\nbury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. And\nanother also said, Lord, I will follow Thee; but let me first go bid\nthem farewell, which are at home at my house. And Jesus said unto\nhim, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is\nfit for the kingdom of God.\u201d\nNo earthly ties, no earthly considerations, should weigh one\nmoment in the scale against duty to the cause and work of God. Jesus\nsevered His connection from everything to save a lost world, and He\nrequires of us a full and entire consecration. There are sacrifices to\nbe made for the interests of God\u2019s cause. The sacrifice of feeling is\nthe most keen that is required of us; yet after all it is a small sacrifice.\nYou have plenty of friends, and if the feelings are only sanctified,\nyou need not feel that you are making a very great sacrifice. You\ndo not leave your wife among heathen. You are not called to tread\nthe burning African desert or to face prisons and encounter trial at\nevery step. Be careful how you appeal to your sympathies and let\nhuman feelings and personal considerations mingle with your efforts\nand labors for the cause of God. He demands unselfish and willing\nservice. You can render this and yet do all your duties to your family;\nbut hold this as a secondary matter.\nMy husband and myself have made mistakes in consenting to\ntake responsibilities that others should carry. In the commence-\nment of this work a man was needed to propose, to execute with[501]\ndetermination, and to lead out battling with error and surmounting\nobstacles. My husband bore the heaviest burden and met the most\ndetermined opposition. But when we became a fully organized body,\nand several men were chosen to act in responsible positions, then\nit was the proper time for my husband to cease to act longer as one\nman to stand under the responsibilities and carry the heavy burdens.\nThis labor devolved on more than one. Here is where the mistake\nhas been made by his brethren in urging him, and by himself in con-\nsenting, to stand under the burdens and responsibilities that he had\nLeadership 471\nborne alone for years. He should have laid down these burdens years\nago, and they should have been divided with other men chosen to act\nin behalf of the people. Satan would be pleased to have one man\u2019s\nmind and one man\u2019s judgment control the minds and judgment of\nthose who believe the present truth.\nMy husband has frequently been left almost alone to see and\nfeel the wants of the cause of God and to act promptly. His leading\nbrethren were not deficient in intellect, but they lacked a willing\nmind to stand in the position which my husband has occupied. They\nhave inconsistently allowed a paralytic to bear the burdens and\nresponsibilities of this work, which no one of them alone could\nendure with their strong nerves and firm muscles. He has sometimes\nused apparent severity and has spoken so as to give offense. When\nhe has seen others who might have shared his burdens avoiding\nresponsibilities, it has grieved him to the heart, and he has spoken\nimpulsively. He has not been placed in this unreasonable position\nby the Lord, but by his brethren. His life has been but little better\nthan a species of slavery. The constant trial, the harassing care, the\nexhausting brainwork, have not been valued by his brethren. He has\nled an unenjoyable life, and he has increased his unhappiness by\ncomplaining of his brother ministers who neglected to do what they\nmight have done. Nature has been outraged time and again. While\nhis brethren have found fault with him for doing so much, they have\nnot come up to take their share of the responsibility, but have been\ntoo willing to make him responsible for everything. You came nobly [502]\nup to bear responsibilities when there were no others who would lift\nthem. If his brethren in the ministry had cultivated a willingness to\nlift the burdens they should have borne, my husband would not have\nseen and done so much work which needed to be done and which he\nthought must not be neglected.\nGod has not suffered the life of my husband to end ingloriously.\nHe has sustained him. But the man who performs double labor, who\ncrowds the work of two years into one, is burning his candle at both\nends. There is yet a work for my husband to do which he should have\ndone years ago. He should now have less of the strife, perplexity,\nand responsibility of life, and be ripening, softening, and elevating\nfor his last change. He should now husband his strength. He should\nnot allow the responsibilities of the cause to rest upon him so heavily,\n472 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nbut should stand free, where the prejudices and suspicions of his\nbrethren will not disturb his peace.\nGod has permitted the precious light of truth to shine upon His\nword and illuminate the mind of my husband. He may reflect the rays\nof light from the presence of Jesus upon others by his preaching and\nwriting. But while serving tables, doing business in connection with\nthe cause, he has been deprived, to a great degree, of the privilege of\nusing his pen and of preaching to the people.\nHe has felt that he was called of God to stand in defense of the\ntruth, and to reprove, sometimes severely, those who were not doing\njustice to the work. The pressure of care and the affliction of disease\nhave often thrown him into discouragement, and he has sometimes\nviewed matters in an exaggerated light. His brethren have taken\nadvantage of his words, and of his prompt manners, which have\nbeen in marked contrast with their tardy labor and narrow plans of\noperation. They have accredited to my husband motives and feelings\nwhich were not his due. The wide contrast between themselves and\nhim seemed like a gulf; but this might easily have been bridged, had\nthese men of intellect put their undivided interests and whole hearts[503]\ninto the work of building up and advancing the precious cause of\nGod.\nWe might exert a constant influence in this place, at the head of\nthe work, which would advance the prosperity of our institutions. But\nthe course of others who do not do what they might, who are subject\nto temptation, and who, if their track is crossed, would reflect upon\nour most earnest efforts for the prosperity of God\u2019s cause, compels us\nto seek an asylum elsewhere where we may work to better advantage\nwith less danger of being crushed under burdens. God has given us\ngreat freedom and power with His people at Battle Creek. When\nwe came to this place last summer, our work commenced in earnest,\nand it has continued ever since. One perplexity and difficulty has\nfollowed closely upon another, calling forth taxing labor to set things\nright.\nWhen the Lord showed that Brother D might be the man for the\nplace, if he remained humble and relied upon His strength, He did\nnot make a blunder and select the wrong man. For a time Brother D\nhad a true interest and acted as a father at the Health Institute. But he\nbecame self-exalted, self-sufficient. He pursued a wrong course. He\nLeadership 473\nyielded to temptation. The excuses which the directors have made\nfor their neglect of duty are all wrong. Their shifting responsibilities\nupon Brother and Sister White is marked against them. They simply\nneglected their duty because it was unpleasant.\nI saw that help was needed upon the Pacific Coast. But God\nwould not have us take the responsibilities or bear the perplexities\nwhich belong to others. We may stand as counselors and help them\nwith our influence and our judgment. We may do much if we will not\nbe induced to get under the load and bear the weight which others\nshould bear, and which it is important for them to bear in order to\ngain a necessary experience. We have important matter to write out\nwhich the people greatly need. We have precious light on Bible truth\nwhich we should speak to the people.\nI was shown that God did not design that my husband should\nbear the burdens he has borne for the last five months. The working [504]\npart in connection with the cause has been left to fall upon him. This\nhas brought perplexity, weariness, and nervous debility, which have\nresulted in discouragement and depression. From the commence-\nment of the cause there has been a lack of harmonious action on the\npart of his brethren. His brethren in the ministry have loved freedom.\nThey have not borne the responsibilities which they might, and have\nfailed to gain the experience which they might have had to enable\nthem to stand in the most responsible positions relative to the vital\ninterests of the cause of God at the present time. They have excused\ntheir neglect to bear responsibilities on the ground that they feared\nbeing reflected upon afterward.\nThe religion we profess is colored by our natural dispositions\nand temperaments; therefore it is of the highest importance that the\nweak points in our character be strengthened by exercise and that the\nstrong, unfavorable points be weakened by working in an opposite\ndirection and by strengthening opposite qualities. But some brethren\nhave not done what they might and should have done, and which\nwould have given my husband sufficient encouragement and help\nto continue to bear some responsibilities at the head of the work.\nHis fellow laborers did not move independently, looking to God for\nlight and for duty for themselves; they did not follow in His opening\nprovidence and consult together upon plans of operation and unite\nin their plans and manner of labor.\n474 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nSince coming to Michigan last summer, the Lord has especially\nblessed the labors of my husband. He has been sustained in a most\nremarkable manner to do work that so much needed to be done.\nHad those associated with him been awake to see and understand\nthe wants of the cause of God at our last Michigan camp meeting,\nthe many things not done might have been accomplished. There\nwas a failure to meet the wants of the occasion. Had Brother A\nstood cheerful in God, walking in the light, ready to see what was\nto be done, and executing the work with dispatch, we should now\nbe months advanced in our work, and we might long ago have been\nworking to establish the press upon the Pacific Coast. God cannot[505]\nbe glorified by our falling into singular gloom and then remaining\nunder the cloud. The light does shine, although we may not realize\nits blessing; but if we make all diligence to press to the light, and if\nwe move ahead just as though the light did shine, we shall soon pass\nout of the darkness and find light all around us.\nAt our last camp meeting the angels of God in a special manner\ncame with their power to lighten, to heal, and to bless both my\nhusband and Brother Waggoner. A precious victory was there gained\nwhich should never lose its influence. I have been shown that God\nhad in a most marked manner given my husband tokens of His love\nand care, and also of His sustaining grace. He has regarded his\nzeal and devotion to His cause and work. This should ever lead to\nhumility and gratitude on the part of my husband.\nGod wants minutemen. He will have men who, when important\ndecisions are to be made, are as true as the needle to the pole; men\nwhose special and personal interests are swallowed up, as were our\nSaviour\u2019s, in the one great general interest for the salvation of souls.\nSatan plays upon the human mind wherever a chance has been left\nfor him to do so; and he seizes upon the very time and place where\nhe can do the most service to himself and the greatest injury to the\ncause of God. A neglect to do what we might do, and what God\nrequires us to do in His cause, is a sin which cannot be palliated\nwith excuses of circumstances or conditions, for Jesus has made\nprovision for all in every emergency.\nMy brother, in doing the work of God you will be placed in a\nvariety of circumstances which will require self-possession and self-\ncontrol, but which will qualify you to adapt yourself to circumstances\nLeadership 475\nand the peculiarities of the situation. Then you can act yourself\nunembarrassed. You should not place too low an estimate upon\nyour ability to act your part in the various callings of practical life.\nWhere you are aware of deficiencies, go to work at once to remedy\nthose defects. Do not trust to others to supply your deficiencies,\nwhile you go on indifferently, as though it were a matter of course\nthat your peculiar organization must ever remain so. Apply yourself [506]\nearnestly to cure these defects, that you may be perfect in Christ\nJesus, wanting in nothing.\nIf you form too high an opinion of yourself, you will think that\nyour labors are of more real consequence than they are, and you will\nplead individual independence which borders on arrogance. If you\ngo to the other extreme and form too low an opinion of yourself, you\nwill feel inferior and will leave an impression of inferiority which\nwill greatly limit the influence that you might have for good. You\nshould avoid either extreme. Feeling should not control you; circum-\nstances should not affect you. You may form a correct estimate of\nyourself, one which will prove a safeguard from both extremes. You\nmay be dignified without vain self-confidence; you may be conde-\nscending and yielding without sacrificing self-respect or individual\nindependence, and your life may be of great influence with those in\nthe higher as well as the lower walks of life.\nBrother A, your danger now is of being affected by reports. Your\nlabors are decidedly practical, close, and cutting. You rein up the\npeople to very close tests and requirements. This is necessary at\ntimes; but your labors are getting to be too much of this character,\nand will lose their force unless mingled with more of the softening,\nencouraging grace of the Spirit of God. You allow the words of\nyour relatives and special friends to influence your propositions and\naffect your decisions. You credit them too readily and incorporate\ntheir views into your own ideas and are too often led astray. You\nneed to be guarded. The families in ----- which are so closely related\nhave had an influence. Your judgment, your feelings, your views,\ninfluence them, and, in turn, they influence you; and a strong current\nwill be set flowing in a wrong direction unless you are all humble\nand thoroughly consecrated to God. All the elements of these family\nconnections are naturally independent and conscientious, and, unless\n476 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nespecially balanced and controlled by the Spirit of God, are inclined\nto extremes.\nNever, never be influenced by reports. Never let your conduct be[507]\ninfluenced by your dearest relatives. The time has come when the\ngreatest wisdom needs to be exercised in reference to the cause and\nwork of God. Judgment is needed to know when to speak and when\nto keep silent. Hunger for sympathy frequently leads to imprudence\nof a grave character in opening the feelings to others. Your appear-\nance frequently claims sympathy when it would be better for you\nif you did not receive it. It is an important duty for all to become\nfamiliar with the tenor of their conduct from day to day and the mo-\ntives which prompt their actions. They need to become acquainted\nwith the particular motives which prompt particular actions. Every\naction of their lives is judged, not by the external appearance, but\nfrom the motive which dictated the action.\nAll should guard the senses, lest Satan gain victory over them;\nfor these are the avenues to the soul. We may be as severe as we like\nin disciplining ourselves, but we must be very cautious not to push\nsouls to desperation. Some feel that Brother White is altogether too\nsevere in speaking in a decided manner to individuals, in reproving\nwhat he thinks is wrong in them. He may be in danger of not\nbeing so careful in his manner of reproving as to give no occasion\nfor reflection; but some of those who complain of his manner of\nreproving use the most cutting, reproving, condemnatory language,\ntoo indiscriminating to be spoken to a congregation, and they feel\nthat they have relieved their souls and done a good work. But the\nangels of God do not always approve such labor. If Brother White\nmakes one individual feel that he is not doing right, if he is too\nsevere toward that one and needs to be taught to modify his manners,\nto soften his spirit, how much more necessary for his ministering\nbrethren to feel the inconsistency of making a large congregation\nsuffer from cutting reproofs and strong denunciations, when the\nreally innocent must suffer with the guilty.\nIt is worse, far worse, to give expression to the feelings in a\nlarge gathering, firing at anyone and everyone, than to go to the\nindividuals who may have done wrong and personally reprove them.[508]\nThe offensiveness of this severe, overbearing, denunciatory talk\nin a large gathering is of as much more grave a character in the\nLeadership 477\nsight of God than giving personal, individual reproof as the numbers\nare greater and the censure more general. It is ever easier to give\nexpression to the feelings before a congregation, because there are\nmany present, than to go to the erring and, face to face with them,\nopenly, frankly, plainly state their wrong course. But bringing into\nthe house of God strong feelings against individuals, and making all\nthe innocent as well as the guilty suffer, is a manner of labor which\nGod does not sanction and which does harm rather than good. It has\ntoo often been the case that criticizing and denunciatory discourses\nhave been given before a congregation. These do not encourage\na spirit of love in the brethren. They do not tend to make them\nspiritually minded and lead them to holiness and heaven, but a spirit\nof bitterness is aroused in hearts. These very strong sermons that\ncut a man all to pieces are sometimes positively necessary to arouse,\nalarm, and convict. But unless they bear the especial marks of being\ndictated by the Spirit of God they do far more injury than they can\ndo good.\nI was shown that my husband\u2019s course has not been perfect. He\nhas erred sometimes in murmuring and in giving too severe reproof.\nBut from what I have seen, he has not been so greatly at fault in\nthis respect as many have supposed and as I have sometimes feared.\nJob was not understood by his friends. He flings back upon them\ntheir reproaches. He shows them that if they are defending God\nby avowing their faith in Him and their consciousness of sin, he\nhas a more deep and thorough knowledge of it than they ever had.\n\u201cMiserable comforters are ye all,\u201d is the answer he makes to their\ncriticisms and censures. \u201cI also,\u201d says Job, \u201ccould speak as ye do:\nif your soul were in my soul\u2019s stead, I could heap up words against\nyou, and shake mine head at you.\u201d But he declares that he would not\ndo this. \u201cI,\u201d he says, \u201cwould strengthen you with my mouth, and the\nmoving of my lips should assuage your grief.\u201d\nBrethren and sisters who are well meaning, but who have narrow [509]\nconceptions and look only at externals, may attempt to help matters\nof which they have no real knowledge. Their limited experience\ncannot fathom the feelings of a soul who has been urged out by the\nSpirit of God, who has felt to the depths that earnest and inexpress-\nible love and interest for the cause of God and for souls that they\n478 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nhave never experienced, and who has borne burdens in the cause of\nGod that they have never lifted.\nSome shortsighted, short-experienced friends cannot, with their\nnarrow vision, appreciate the feelings of one who has been in close\nharmony with the soul of Christ in connection with the salvation of\nothers. His motives are misunderstood and his actions misconstrued\nby those who would be his friends, until, like Job, he sends forth the\nearnest prayer: Save me from my friends. God takes the case of Job\nin hand Himself. His patience has been severely taxed; but when God\nspeaks, all his pettish feelings are changed. The self-justification\nwhich he felt was necessary to withstand the condemnation of his\nfriends is not necessary toward God. He never misjudges; He never\nerrs. Says the Lord to Job, \u201cGird up now thy loins like a man;\u201d and\nJob no sooner hears the divine voice than his soul is bowed down\nwith a sense of his sinfulness, and he says before God, \u201cI abhor\nmyself, and repent in dust and ashes.\u201d\nWhen God has spoken, my husband has hearkened to His voice;\nbut to bear the condemnation and reflection of his friends who do not\nseem to discriminate has been a great trial. When his brethren shall\nhave stood under the same circumstances, and borne the responsibil-\nities that he has borne with as little encouragement and help as he\nhas had, then they may be able to understand how to sustain, how to\ncomfort, how to bless, without torturing his feelings by reflections\nand censures which he in no way deserves.\nChapter 45\u2014Calls for Means [510]\nI was shown that there have been unhappy results from making\nurgent calls for means at our camp meetings. This matter has been\npressed too hard. Many men of means would not have done anything\nhad not their hearts been softened and melted under the influence\nof the testimonies borne to them. But the poor have been deeply\naffected and, in the sincerity of their souls, have pledged means\nwhich they had a heart to give, but which they were unable to pay. In\nmost instances urgent calls for means have left a wrong impression\nupon some minds. Some have thought that money was the burden of\nour message. Many have gone to their homes blessed because they\nhad donated to the cause of God. But there are better methods of\nraising means, by freewill offerings, than by urgent calls at our large\ngatherings. If all come up to the plan of systematic benevolence, and\nif our tract and missionary workers are faithful in their department\nof the work, the treasury will be well supplied without these urgent\ncalls at our large gatherings.\nBut there has been a great neglect of duty. Many have withheld\nmeans which God claims as His, and in so doing they have commit-\nted robbery toward God. Their selfish hearts have not given the tenth\nof all their increase, which God claims. Neither have they come\nup to the yearly gatherings with their freewill offerings, their thank\nofferings, and their trespass offerings. Many have come before the\nLord empty-handed. \u201cWill a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me.\nBut ye say, Wherein have we robbed Thee? In tithes and offerings.\nYe are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed Me, even this whole\nnation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be\nmeat in Mine house, and prove Me now here with, saith the Lord of\nhosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you\nout a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\u201d\nSin will rest upon us as a people if we do not make most earnest [511]\nefforts to ascertain those who have donated to the different en-\nterprises who are too poor to give anything. All that they, in the\n479\n480 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nliberality of their souls, have given should be returned to them with\nan additional gift to relieve their necessities. The raising of money\nhas been carried to extremes. It has left a bad impression on many\nminds. Making urgent calls is not the best plan of raising means.\nThere has been manifested an indifference to investigate the cases of\nthe poor and make returns to them, that they should not suffer for the\nnecessaries of life. A neglect of our duty in this respect, of becoming\nacquainted with the necessities of the needy and of relieving their\npressing wants by returning means which has been given to advance\nthe cause of God, would be on our part a neglect of our Saviour in\nthe persons of His saints.\n* * * * *\nChapter 46\u2014Duty to the Unfortunate\nI have been shown some things in reference to our duty to the\nunfortunate which I feel it my duty to write at this time.\nI saw that it is in the providence of God that widows and orphans,\nthe blind, the deaf, the lame, and persons afflicted in a variety of\nways, have been placed in close Christian relationship to His church;\nit is to prove His people and develop their true character. Angels of\nGod are watching to see how we treat these persons who need our\nsympathy, love, and disinterested benevolence. This is God\u2019s test of\nour character. If we have the true religion of the Bible we shall feel\nthat a debt of love, kindness, and interest is due to Christ in behalf\nof His brethren; and we can do no less than to show our gratitude\nfor His immeasurable love to us while we were sinners unworthy\nof His grace, by having a deep interest and unselfish love for those\nwho are our brethren and who are less fortunate than ourselves.\nThe two great principles of the law of God are supreme love to [512]\nGod and unselfish love to our neighbor. The first four command-\nments and the last six hang upon, or grow out of, these two principles.\nChrist explained to the lawyer who his neighbor was in the illustra-\ntion of the man who was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho and\nwho fell among thieves and was robbed and beaten and left half\ndead. The priest and the Levite saw this man suffering, but their\nhearts did not respond to his wants. They avoided him by passing\nby on the other side. The Samaritan came that way, and when he\nsaw the stranger\u2019s need of help he did not question whether he was\na relative or was of his country or creed; but he went to work to\nhelp the sufferer because there was work which needed to be done.\nHe relieved him as best he could, put him upon his own beast, and\ncarried him to an inn and made provision for his wants at his own\nexpense. This Samaritan, said Christ, was neighbor to him who fell\namong thieves. The Levite and the priest represent a class in the\nchurch who manifest an indifference to the very ones who need their\nsympathy and help. This class, notwithstanding their position in\n481\n482 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthe church, are commandment breakers. The Samaritan represents\na class who are true helpers with Christ and who are imitating His\nexample in doing good.\nThose who have pity for the unfortunate, the blind, the lame, the\nafflicted, the widows, the orphans, and the needy, Christ represents\nas commandment keepers, who shall have eternal life. There is in\n----- a great lack of personal religion and of a sense of individual\nobligation to feel for others\u2019 woes and to work with disinterested\nbenevolence for the prosperity of the unfortunate and afflicted. Some\nhave no experience in these duties. They have all their lives been like\nthe Levite and the priest, who passed by on the other side. There is a\nwork for the church to do, which, if left undone, will bring darkness\nupon them. The church as a whole and individually should bring\ntheir motives under faithful examination and compare their lives\nwith the life and teachings of the only correct Pattern. Christ regards\nall acts of mercy, benevolence, and thoughtful consideration for the\nunfortunate, the blind, the lame, the sick, the widow, and the orphan[513]\nas done to Himself; and these works are preserved in the heavenly\nrecords and will be rewarded. On the other hand, a record will be\nwritten in the book against those who manifest the indifference of\nthe priest and the Levite to the unfortunate, and those who take any\nadvantage of the misfortunes of others and increase their affliction\nin order to selfishly advantage themselves. God will surely repay\nevery act of injustice and every manifestation of careless indifference\nto and neglect of the afflicted among us. Everyone will finally be\nrewarded as his works have been.\nI was shown in regard to Brother E that he has not been dealt\njustly with by his brethren. Brethren F, G, and others pursued a\ncourse toward him which was displeasing to God. Brother F had\nno special interest in Brother E, only so far as he thought he could\nadvantage himself through him. I was shown that some looked upon\nBrother E as being penurious and dishonest. God is displeased with\nthis judgment. Brother E would have had no trouble and would\nhave had means to abundantly sustain himself had it not been for\nthe selfish course of his brethren who had eyesight and property,\nand who worked against him by seeking to turn his abilities to their\nown selfish interest. Those who take advantage of the hard study\nDuty to the Unfortunate 483\nof a blind man and seek to benefit themselves with his inventions,\ncommit robbery and are virtually commandment breakers.\nThere are some in the church who profess to be keeping the\nlaw of Jehovah, but who are transgressors of that law. There are\nmen who do not discern their own defects. They possess a selfish,\npenurious spirit and blind their own eyes to their sin of covetousness,\nwhich the Bible defines as idolatry. Men of this character may have\nbeen esteemed by their brethren as most exemplary Christians; but\nthe eye of God reads the heart and discerns the motives. He sees\nthat which man cannot see in the thoughts and character. In His\nprovidence He brings these persons into positions which will in\ntime reveal the defects in their character, that if they wish to see and [514]\ncorrect them they can do so. There are some who have all their lives\nstudied their own interest and been swallowed up in their own selfish\nplans and who have been anxious to advantage themselves without\nmuch thought whether others would be distressed or perplexed by\nany plans or actions of theirs. Selfish interest overbears mercy and\nthe love of God. The Lord sometimes permits this class to go on\nin their selfish course in spiritual blindness until their defects are\napparent to all who have spiritual discernment and they evidence by\ntheir works that they are not genuine Christians.\nMen who have property and a measure of health, and who enjoy\nthe inestimable blessing of sight, have every advantage over a blind\nman. Many ways are open to them in their business career that are\nclosed to a man who has lost his sight. Persons enjoying the use of\nall their faculties should not look to their own selfish interest and\ndeprive a blind brother of one iota of his opportunity to gain means.\nBrother E is a poor man. He is a feeble man; he is also a blind man.\nHe has had an earnest desire to help himself, and, although living\nunder a weight of discouraging infirmities, his affliction has not dried\nup the generous impulses of his soul. In his limited circumstances\nhe has had a heart to do and has done more in the sight of God for\nthose who were in need of help than many of his brethren who are\nblessed with sight and who have a good property. Brother E has\na capital in his business calculation and inventive faculty. He has\nworked earnestly with high hopes of inventing a business by which\nhe might support himself and not be dependent upon his brethren.\n484 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nI wish that we might all see as God sees. I wish all could realize\nhow God looks upon those men who profess to be followers of Christ,\nwho have the blessing of sight and the advantage of means in their\nfavor, and who yet envy the little prosperity enjoyed by a poor blind\nman and would benefit themselves, increase their stock of means, at\nthe disadvantage of their afflicted brother. This is regarded of God as\nthe most criminal selfishness and robbery, and is an aggravating sin,\nwhich He will surely punish. God never forgets. He does not look[515]\nupon these things with human eyes and with cold, unfeeling, human\njudgment. He views things, not from the worldling\u2019s standpoint, but\nfrom the standpoint of mercy, pity, and infinite love.\nBrother H tried to help Brother E, but not with unselfish motives.\nAt first his pity was excited. He saw that Brother E needed help. But\nsoon he lost his interest, and selfish feelings gathered strength, until\nthe course of his brethren resulted in Brother E\u2019s being disadvantaged\nrather than benefited. These things have greatly discouraged Brother\nE and have had a tendency to shake his confidence in his brethren.\nThey have resulted in involving him in debts which he could not pay.\nAs he has realized the selfish feelings exercised toward him by some\nof his brethren, it has grieved him and sometimes stirred him. His\nfeelings at times have been almost uncontrollable as he has realized\nhis helpless condition, without sight, without means, without health,\nand with some of his brethren working against him. This has added\ngreatly to his affliction and told fearfully upon his health.\nI was shown that Brother E has some good qualities of mind\nwhich would be better appreciated if he had greater power of self-\ncontrol and would not become excited. Every exhibition of impa-\ntience and fretfulness tells against him, and is made the most of\nby some who are guilty of much more grievous sins in the sight\nof God, Brother E\u2019s principles are good. He has integrity. He is\nnot a dishonest man. He would not knowingly defraud any man.\nBut he has faults and sins which must be overcome. He, as well as\nother men, has to deal with human nature. He is too often impatient\nand is sometimes overbearing. He should cherish a more kindly,\ncourteous spirit and should cultivate gratitude of heart toward those\nwho have felt an interest in his case. Naturally he has an impetu-\nous temper when suddenly aroused or unreasonably provoked. But,\nDuty to the Unfortunate 485\nnotwithstanding this, he has a heart to do right, and he feels sincere\nrepentance toward God when he reflects upon his wrongs.\nIf he sees his brethren inclined to do him justice he will be gener- [516]\nous to forgive and humble enough to desire peace, even if he has to\nmake great sacrifices to obtain it. But he is easily excited; he is of a\nnervous temperament. He has need of the subduing influence of the\nSpirit of God. If those who are ready to censure him would consider\ntheir own wrongs and kindly overlook his faults as generously as\nthey should, they would manifest the spirit of Christ. Brother E has a\nwork to do to overcome. His words and deportment to others should\nbe gentle, kind, and pleasant. He should strictly guard against every-\nthing which savors of a dictatorial spirit or of overbearing manners\nor words.\nWhile God is a friend to the blind and the unfortunate, He does\nnot excuse their sins. He requires them to overcome and to perfect\nChristian character in the name of Jesus, who overcame in their\nbehalf. But Jesus pities our weakness, and He is ready to give\nstrength to bear up in trial and to resist the temptations of Satan, if\nwe will cast our burden upon Him. Angels are sent to minister to\nthe children of God who are physically blind. Angels guard their\nsteps and save them from a thousand dangers, which, unknown to\nthem, beset their path. But His Spirit will not attend them unless\nthey cherish a spirit of kindness and seek earnestly to have control\nover their natures and to bring their passions and every power into\nsubmission to God. They must cultivate a spirit of love and control\ntheir words and actions.\nI was shown that God requires His people to be far more pitiful\nand considerate of the unfortunate than they are. \u201cPure religion and\nundefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and\nwidows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the\nworld.\u201d Here genuine religion is defined. God requires that the same\nconsideration which should be given to the widow and fatherless be\ngiven to the blind and to those suffering under the affliction of other\nphysical infirmities. Disinterested benevolence is very rare in this\nage of the world.\nI was shown, in Brother E\u2019s case, that those who would in any\nway deal unjustly with him and discourage him in his efforts to [517]\nhelp himself, or who, coveting the poor blind man\u2019s prosperity,\n486 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nwould advantage themselves to his disadvantage, will bring upon\nthemselves the curse of God, who is the blind man\u2019s friend. Special\ninjunctions were given to the children of Israel in reference to the\nblind: \u201cThou shalt not defraud thy neighbor, neither rob him: the\nwages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the\nmorning. Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block\nbefore the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the Lord. Ye shall do\nno unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of\nthe poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness\nshalt thou judge thy neighbor.\u201d \u201cCursed be he that removeth his\nneighbor\u2019s landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen. Cursed\nbe he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all the\npeople shall say, Amen. Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment\nof the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say,\nAmen.\u201d\nIt is strange that professed Christian men should disregard the\nplain, positive teachings of the word of God and feel no compunc-\ntions of conscience. God places upon them the responsibility of\ncaring for the unfortunate, the blind, the lame, the widow, and the\nfatherless; but many make no effort to regard it. In order to save\nsuch, God frequently brings them under the rod of affliction and\nplaces them in positions similar to those occupied by the persons\nwho were in need of their help and sympathy, but who did not receive\nit at their hands.\nGod will hold the church at ----- responsible, as a body, for the\nwrong course of its members. If a selfish and unsympathizing spirit\nis allowed to exist in any of its members toward the unfortunate,\nthe widow, the orphan, the blind, the lame, or those who are sick\nin body or mind, He will hide His face from His people until they\ndo their duty and remove the wrong from among them. If any\nprofessing the name of Christ so far misrepresent their Saviour as\nto be unmindful of their duty to the afflicted, or if they in any way\nseek to advantage themselves to the injury of the unfortunate and[518]\nthus rob them of means, the Lord holds the church accountable for\nthe sin of its members until they have done all they can to remedy\nthe existing evil. He will not hearken to the prayer of His people\nwhile the orphan, the fatherless, the lame, the blind, and the sick are\nneglected among them.\nDuty to the Unfortunate 487\nThere is more meant by \u201cbeing on the Lord\u2019s side\u201d than merely\nsaying so in meeting. The Lord\u2019s side is ever the side of mercy, pity,\nand sympathy for the suffering, as will be seen by the example given\nus in the life of Jesus. We are required to imitate His example. But\nthere are some who are not on the Lord\u2019s side in regard to these\nthings; they are on the side of the enemy. In giving to His hearers an\nillustration of this subject, Jesus said:\n\u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My\nbrethren, ye have done it unto Me. Then shall He say also unto them\non the left hand, Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,\nprepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an hungered, and ye\ngave Me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink: I was a\nstranger, and ye took Me not in: naked, and ye clothed Me not: sick,\nand in prison, and ye visited Me not. Then shall they also answer\nHim, saying, Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered, or athirst, or a\nstranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto\nThee? Then shall He answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you,\nInasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to\nMe. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the\nrighteous into life eternal.\u201d\nHere in His sermon Christ identifies Himself with suffering\nhumanity and plainly impresses upon us all that indifference or\ninjustice done to the least of His saints is done to Him. Here is the\nLord\u2019s side, and whoever will be on the Lord\u2019s side, let him come\nover with us. The dear Saviour is wounded when we wound one of\nHis humble saints.\nRighteous Job moans because of his afflictions and pleads his\nown cause when unjustly accused by one of his comforters. He says:\n\u201cI was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. I was a father [519]\nto the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out. And I\nbrake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.\u201d\nThe sin of one man discomfited the entire army of Israel. A\nwrong course pursued by one toward his brother will turn the light\nof God from His people until the wrong is searched out and the\ncause of the oppressed is vindicated. God requires His people to\nbe tender in their feelings and discriminations, while their hearts\nshould be enlarged, their feelings should be broad and deep, not\nnarrow, selfish, and penurious. Noble sympathy, largeness of soul,\n488 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nand disinterested benevolence are needed. Then can the church\ntriumph in God. But just as long as the church suffer selfishness to\ndry up kindly sympathy and tender, thoughtful love and interest for\ntheir brethren, every virtue will be corroded. Isaiah\u2019s fast should\nbe studied and close self-examination made with a spirit to discern\nwhether there is in them the principles which God\u2019s people are\nrequired to possess in order that they may receive the rich blessings\npromised.\nGod requires that His people should not allow the poor and\nafflicted to be oppressed. If they break every yoke and release the\noppressed, and are unselfish and kindly considerate of the needy,\nthen shall the blessings promised be theirs. If there are those in the\nchurch who would cause the blind to stumble, they should be brought\nto justice; for God has made us guardians of the blind, the afflicted,\nthe widows, and the fatherless. The stumbling block referred to in\nthe word of God does not mean a block of wood placed before the\nfeet of the blind to cause him to stumble, but it means much more\nthan this. It means any course that may be pursued to injure the\ninfluence of their blind brother, to work against his interest, or to\nhinder his prosperity.\nA brother who is blind and poor and diseased, and who is making\nevery exertion to help himself that he may not be dependent, should\nbe encouraged by his brethren in every way possible. But those who\nprofess to be his brethren, who have the use of all their faculties,[520]\nwho are not dependent, but who so far forget their duty to the blind\nas to perplex and distress and hedge up his way, are doing a work\nwhich will require repentance and restoration before God will accept\ntheir prayers. And the church of God who have permitted their\nunfortunate brother to be wronged will be guilty of sin until they do\nall in their power to have the wrong righted.\nAll are doubtless familiar with Achan\u2019s case. It is recorded in\nsacred history for all generations, but more especially for those upon\nwhom the ends of the world are come. Joshua lay moaning upon\nhis face before God because the people were obliged to make a\ndisgraceful retreat before their enemies. The Lord bade Joshua arise:\n\u201cGet thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?\u201d Have I hum-\nbled without cause by removing My presence from thee? Does God\nforsake His people without a cause? No; He tells Joshua that there\nDuty to the Unfortunate 489\nis a work for him to do before his prayer can be answered. \u201cIsrael\nhath sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I\ncommanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing,\nand have also stolen, and dissembled also.\u201d He declares: \u201cNeither\nwill I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from\namong you.\u201d\nHere in this example we have some idea of the responsibility\nresting upon the church and the work that God requires them to do in\norder to have His presence. It is a sin in any church not to search for\nthe cause of their darkness and of the afflictions which have been in\nthe midst of them. The church in ----- cannot be a living, prosperous\nchurch until they are more awake to the wrongs among them, which\nhinder the blessing of God from coming upon them. The church\nshould not suffer their brethren in affliction to be wronged. These\nare the very ones that should awaken the sympathy of all hearts and\ncall into exercise noble, benevolent feelings from all the followers of\nChrist. The true disciples of Christ will work in harmony with Him\nand, following His example will help those who need help. Brother\nE\u2019s blindness is a terrible affliction, and all should seek to be eyes for [521]\nthe blind and thus make him feel his loss as little as possible. There\nare some who improve their eyes by watching opportunities to work\nfor their own advantage to get gain, but God may bring confusion\nupon them in a manner they do not expect.\nIf God in His mercy has given the blind man inventive faculties\nthat he can use for his own good, God forbid that anyone should\ngrudge him this privilege and rob him of the benefits he might derive\nfrom God\u2019s gift to him. The blind man has disadvantages to meet\non every side in the loss of his sight. That heart in which pity and\nsympathy are not excited at seeing a blind man groping his way\nin a world clothed to him in darkness, is hard indeed and must be\nsoftened by the grace of God. Not a face can the blind man look\nupon and there read kindly sympathy and true benevolence. He\ncannot look upon the beauties of nature and trace the finger of God\nin His created works. Their cheering gladness does not speak to\nhim to comfort and to bless when despondency broods over him.\nHow quickly would he exchange his blindness and every temporal\nblessing for the blessing of sight. But he is shut up to a world of\n490 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ndarkness, and his God-given rights have been trampled upon that\nothers might get gain.\n* * * * *\nChapter 47\u2014Man\u2019s Duty to His Fellow Men\nI have been shown some things in regard to Brother I\u2019s family\nwhich have pressed upon my mind so strongly since I have been\nin this place that I venture to write them out. I have been shown,\nBrother I, that there exists in your family an element of selfishness\nwhich clings to you like the leprosy. This selfishness must be seen\nand overcome, for it is a grievous sin in the sight of God. As a family\nyou have so long consulted your own wishes, your own pleasure and\nconvenience, that you do not feel that others have claims upon you.\nYour thoughts, plans, and efforts are for yourselves. You live for self; [522]\nyou do not cultivate disinterested benevolence, which, if exercised,\nwould increase and strengthen until it would be your delight to live\nfor others\u2019 good. You would feel that you had an object in life, a\npurpose that would bring you returns of greater value than money.\nYou need to have a more special interest for humanity, and in so\ndoing you would bring your souls into closer connection with Christ\nand would be so imbued with His Spirit and would cleave to Him\nwith so firm a tenacity that nothing could separate you from His\nlove.\nChrist is the living Vine and if you are branches of that Vine,\nthe life nourishment which flows through it will nourish you, that\nyou will not be barren or unfruitful. You have, as a family and as\nindividuals, professedly connected yourselves with the service of\nChrist; and yet you are weighed in the balances of the sanctuary and\nfound wanting. All of you need to have an entire transformation\nbefore you can do those things which unselfish, devoted Christians\nshould do. Nothing but a thorough conversion can give you a correct\nsense of your defects of character. You all have the spirit and love\nof the world to a great extent. Says the apostle John: \u201cIf any man\nlove the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\u201d Your selfish\nspirit narrows and dwarfs your minds to your own interests. You\nneed pure and undefiled religion. The simplicity of the truth will\nlead you to feel a sympathy for others\u2019 woes. There are those who\n491\n492 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nneed your sympathy and love. To exercise these traits of character is\na part of the life-work which Christ has given us all to do.\nGod will not excuse you for not taking up the cross and practicing\nself-denial in doing good to others with unselfish motives. If you\nwill take the trouble to make the self-denial required of Christians,\nyou may, by the grace of God, be qualified to win souls to Christ.\nGod has claims upon you to which you have never responded. There\nare many all around us who hunger for sympathy and love. But,\nlike many others, you have been nearly destitute of that humble love\nwhich naturally flows out in pity and sympathy for the destitute, the[523]\nsuffering, and the needy. The human countenance itself is a mirror\nof the soul, read by others, and having a telling influence upon them\nfor good or evil. God does not call upon any of us to watch our\nbrethren and to repent of their sins. He has left us a work to do, and\nHe calls upon us to do it resolutely, in His fear, with an eye single to\nHis glory.\nEveryone, whether he is faithful or otherwise, must give to God\nan account of himself, not of others. Seeing faults in other professors\nand condemning their course will not excuse or offset one error of\nours. We should not make others our criterion nor excuse anything\nin our course because others have done wrong. God has given us\nconsciences for ourselves. Great principles have been laid down in\nHis word, which are sufficient to guide us in our Christian walk and\ngeneral deportment. You, my dear friends, as a family, have not kept\nthe principles of the law of God. You have never felt the burden of\nthe duty devolving upon man to his fellow men.\n\u201cAnd, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him, say-\ning, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said unto him,\nWhat is written in the law? how readest thou? And he answering\nsaid, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with\nall thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and\nthy neighbor as thyself. And He said unto him, Thou hast answered\nright: this do, and thou shalt live. But he, willing to justify himself,\nsaid unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor? And Jesus answering\nsaid,\n\u201cA certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell\namong thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded\nhim, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance there came\nMan\u2019s Duty to His Fellow Men 493\ndown a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by\non the other side. And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place,\ncame and looked on him, and passed by on the other side. But a\ncertain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when\nhe saw him, he had compassion on him, and went to him, and bound\nup his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own [524]\nbeast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the\nmorrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to\nthe host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou\nspendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. Which now\nof these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto him that fell among\nthe thieves? And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then said\nJesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.\u201d\nHere the conditions of inheriting eternal life are plainly stated by\nour Saviour in the most simple manner. The man who was wounded\nand robbed represents those who are subjects of our interest, sym-\npathy, and charity. If we neglect the cases of the needy and the\nunfortunate that are brought under our notice, no matter who they\nmay be, we have no assurance of eternal life; for we do not answer\nthe claims that God has upon us. We are not compassionate and piti-\nful to humanity, because they may not be kith or kin to us. You have\nbeen found transgressors of the second great commandment, upon\nwhich the last six commandments depend. Whosoever offendeth in\none point, is guilty of all. Those who do not open their hearts to the\nwants and sufferings of humanity will not open their hearts to the\nclaims of God as stated in the first four precepts of the Decalogue.\nIdols claim the heart and affections, and God is not honored and\ndoes not reign supreme.\nYou have, as a family, made a sad failure. You are not, in the\nstrictest sense, commandment keepers. You may be quite exact in\nsome things, yet neglect the weightier matters\u2014judgment, mercy,\nand the love of God. Although the customs of the world are no\ncriterion for us, yet I have been shown that the pitying sympathy\nand the benevolence of the world for the unfortunate in many cases\nshame the professed followers of Christ. Many manifest indifference\ntoward those whom God has thrown among them for the purpose of\ntesting and proving them, and developing what is in their hearts. God\nreads. He marks every act of selfishness, every act of indifference\n494 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ntoward the afflicted, the widows, and the fatherless; and He writes[525]\nagainst their names: \u201cGuilty, wanting, lawbreakers.\u201d We shall be\nrewarded as our works have been. Any neglect of duty to the needy\nand to the afflicted is a neglect of duty to Christ in the person of His\nsaints.\nWhen the cases of all come in review before God, the question,\nWhat did they profess? will not be asked, but, What have they\ndone? Have they been doers of the word? Have they lived for\nthemselves, or have they been exercised in works of benevolence, in\ndeeds of kindness and love, preferring others before themselves, and\ndenying themselves that they might bless others? If the record shows\nthat this has been their life, that their characters have been marked\nwith tenderness, self-denial, and benevolence, they will receive the\nblessed assurance and benediction from Christ: \u201cWell done\u201d \u201cCome,\nye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from\nthe foundation of the world.\u201d Christ has been grieved and wounded\nby your marked selfish love and your indifference to the woes and\nneeds of others.\nMany times our efforts for others may be disregarded and appar-\nently lost. But this should be no excuse for us to become weary in\nwell-doing. How often has Jesus come to find fruit upon the plants\nof His care and found nothing but leaves! We may be disappointed\nas to the result of our best efforts, but this should not lead us to be\nindifferent to others\u2019 woes and to do nothing. \u201cCurse ye Meroz,\nsaid the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof;\nbecause they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the\nLord against the mighty.\u201d How often is Christ disappointed in those\nwho profess to be His children! He has given them unmistakable\nevidences of His love. He became poor, that through His poverty\nwe might be made rich. He died for us, that we might not perish,\nbut have eternal life. What if Christ had refused to bear our iniquity\nbecause He was rejected by many and because so few appreciated\nHis love and the infinite blessings He came to bring them? We need\nto encourage patient, painstaking efforts. Courage is now wanted,[526]\nnot lazy despondency and fretful murmuring. We are in this world to\ndo work for the Master and not to study our inclination and pleasure,\nto serve and glorify ourselves. Why, then, should we be inactive and\ndiscouraged because we do not see the immediate results we desire?\nMan\u2019s Duty to His Fellow Men 495\nOur work is to toil in the vineyard of the Lord, not merely for\nourselves, but for the good of others. Our influence is a blessing\nor a curse to others. We are here to form perfect characters for\nheaven. We have something to do besides repining and murmuring\nat God\u2019s providences, and writing bitter things against ourselves.\nOur adversary will not allow us to rest. If we are indeed God\u2019s\nchildren we shall be harassed and sorely beset, and we need not\nexpect that Satan or those under his influence will treat us well. But\nthere are angels who excel in strength who will be with us in all our\nconflicts if we will only be faithful. Christ conquered Satan in our\nbehalf in the wilderness of temptation. He is mightier than Satan,\nand He will shortly bruise him under our feet.\nYou have, as a family and as individuals, excused yourselves\nfrom earnest, active service in your Master\u2019s cause. You have been\ntoo indolent and have left others to carry many of the heavier burdens\nwhich you could and should have borne. Your spiritual strength and\nblessing will be proportionate to the labor of love and the good works\nwhich you perform. The injunction of the apostle Paul is: \u201cBear\nye one another\u2019s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.\u201d Keeping\nthe commandments of God requires of us good works, self-denial,\nself-sacrifice, and devotion for the good of others, not that our good\nworks alone can save us, but that we surely cannot be saved without\ngood works. After we have done all that we are capable of doing,\nwe are then to say: We have done no more than our duty, and at best\nare unprofitable servants, unworthy of the smallest favor from God.\nChrist must be our righteousness and the crown of our rejoicing.\nSelf-righteousness and carnal security have closed you about\nas a wall. As a family you possess a spirit of independence and [527]\npride. This element separates you from God. It is a fault, a defect\nwhich must be seen and overcome. It is almost impossible for you\nto see your errors and wrongs. You have too good an opinion of\nyourselves, and it is difficult for you to see and remove by confession\nthe mistakes in your lives. You are inclined to justify and defend your\ncourse in almost everything, whether it be right or wrong. While\nit is not too late for wrongs to be righted, bring your hearts near to\nJesus by humiliation and prayer, and seek to know yourselves. You\nmust be lost unless you arouse yourselves and work with Christ. You\nencase yourselves in a cold, unfeeling, unsympathizing armor. There\n496 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nis but little life and warmth in your association with others. You live\nfor yourselves, not for Christ. You are careless and indifferent to\nthe needs and conditions of others less fortunate than yourselves.\nAll around you there are those who have soul hunger and who long\nfor love expressed in words and deeds. Friendly sympathy and\nreal feelings of tender interest for others would bring to your souls\nblessings that you have never yet experienced and would bring you\ninto close relation to our Redeemer, whose advent to the world was\nfor the purpose of doing good and whose life we are to copy. What\nare you doing for Christ? \u201cStrive to enter in at the strait gate: for\nmany, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\u201d\nLove and Sympathy at Home\nThere are many in our world who are starving for the love and\nsympathy which should be given them. Many men love their wives,\nbut are too selfish to manifest it. They have a false dignity and pride,\nand will not show their love by words and deeds. There are many\nmen who never know how starved is the heart of the wife for words\nof tender appreciation and affection. They bury their loved ones from\ntheir sight and murmur at the providence of God that has deprived\nthem of their companions, when, could they look into the inner life\nof those companions, they would see that their own course was the[528]\ncause of their premature death. The religion of Christ will lead us\nto be kind and courteous and not so tenacious of our opinions. We\nshould die to self and esteem others better than ourselves.\nGod\u2019s word is our standard, but how far have His professed peo-\nple departed from it! Our religious faith must be not only theoretical,\nbut practical. Pure and undefiled religion will not allow us to tram-\nple upon the rights of the least of God\u2019s creatures, much less of the\nmembers of His body and the members of our own family. God is\nlove, and whoso dwelleth in Him dwelleth in love. The influence\nof worldly selfishness, which is carried about by some like a cloud,\nchilling the very atmosphere that others breathe, causes sickness of\nsoul and frequently chills to death.\nIt will be a great cross for you to cultivate pure, unselfish love\nand disinterested benevolence. To yield your opinions and ideas, to\ngive up your judgment, and to follow the counsel of others will be a\nMan\u2019s Duty to His Fellow Men 497\ngreat cross to you. The several members of your family now have\nfamilies of their own. But the same spirit which existed to a greater\nor less extent in their father\u2019s home is carried to their own firesides\nand is felt by those outside of their family circles. They lack sweet\nsimplicity, Christlike tenderness, and unselfish love. They have a\nwork to do to overcome these selfish traits of character in order to be\nfruitful branches of the True Vine. Said Christ: \u201cHerein is My Father\nglorified, that ye bear much fruit.\u201d You need to bring Jesus near to\nyou, to have Him in your homes and in your hearts. You should not\nonly have a knowledge of what is right, but should practice it from\nright motives, having an eye single to the glory of God. You may be\nhelps, if you will comply with the conditions given in the word of\nGod.\nThe religion of Christ is something more than talk. The righ-\nteousness of Christ consists in right actions and good works from\npure, unselfish motives. Outside righteousness, while the inward\nadorning is wanting, will be of no avail. \u201cThis then is the message\nwhich we have heard of Him, and declare unto you, that God is light, [529]\nand in Him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship\nwith Him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: but if\nwe walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one\nwith another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us\nfrom all sin.\u201d If we have not the light and love of God we are not\nHis children. If we gather not with Christ we scatter abroad. We all\nhave an influence, and that influence is telling upon the destiny of\nothers for their present and future good or for their eternal loss.\nJ and K both lack sympathy and love for those outside of their\nown families. They are in danger of watching to see defects in\nothers while greater evils exist undiscerned in themselves. If these\ndear souls ever enter heaven, they must die to self and obtain an\nexperience in well-doing. They have lessons to learn in the school\nof Christ in order to perfect Christian characters and have a oneness\nwith Christ. Said Christ to His disciples: \u201cExcept ye be converted,\nand become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom\nof heaven.\u201d He explained His meaning to them. He did not wish\nthem to become children in understanding, but in malice. Little\nchildren do not manifest feelings of superiority and aristocracy.\nThey are simple and natural in their appearance. Christ would have\n498 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nHis followers cultivate unaffected manners, that their whole bearing\nmay be humble and Christlike. He has made it our duty to live for\nothers\u2019 good. He came from the royal courts of heaven to this world\nto show how great an interest He had in man, and the infinite price\npaid for the redemption of man shows that man is of so great value\nthat Christ could sacrifice His riches and honor in the royal courts to\nlift him from the degradation of sin.\nIf the Majesty of heaven could do so much to show His love for\nman, what ought not men to be willing to do to help one another out\nof the pit of darkness and suffering! Said Christ, \u201cLove one another,\nas I have loved you;\u201d not with a greater love; for \u201cgreater love hath\nno man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\u201d[530]\nOur love is frequently selfish, for we confine it to prescribed limits.\nWhen we come into close union and fellowship with Christ, our\nlove and sympathy and our works of benevolence will reach down\ndeeper and will widen and strengthen with exercise. The love and\ninterest of Christ\u2019s followers must be as broad as the world. Those\nwho live merely for \u201cme and mine\u201d will fail of heaven. God calls\nupon you as a family to cultivate love, to become less sensitive in\nregard to yourselves and more sensitive to the griefs and trials of\nothers. This selfish spirit that you have cherished all your lives is\ncorrectly represented by the priest and the Levite who passed by the\nunfortunate on the other side. They saw that he needed help, but\npurposely avoided him.\nEach one of you needs to awake and face square about to get out\nof the cart rut of selfishness. Improve the short, probationary time\ngiven you by working with your might to redeem the failures of your\npast life. God has placed you in a world of suffering to prove you, to\nsee if you will be found worthy of the gift of eternal life. There are\nthose all around you who have woes, who need words of sympathy,\nlove, and tenderness, and our humble, pitying prayers. Some are\nsuffering under the iron hand of poverty, some with disease, and\nothers with heartaches, despondency, and gloom. Like Job, you\nshould be eyes to the blind and feet to the lame, and you should\ninquire into the cause which you know not and search it out with the\nobject in view to relieve their necessities and help just where they\nmost need help.\nMan\u2019s Duty to His Fellow Men 499\nL needs to cultivate love for his wife, love that will find expres-\nsion in words and deeds. He should cultivate tender affection. His\nwife has a sensitive, clinging nature and needs to be cherished. Ev-\nery word of tenderness, every word of appreciation and affectionate\nencouragement, will be remembered by her and will reflect back\nin blessings upon her husband. His unsympathizing nature needs\nto be brought into close contact with Christ, that that stiffness and\ncold reserve may be subdued and softened by divine love. It will\nnot be weakness or a sacrifice of manhood and dignity to give his [531]\nwife expressions of tenderness and sympathy in words and acts; and\nlet it not end with the family circle, but extend to those outside the\nfamily. L has a work to do for himself that no one can do for him.\nHe may grow strong in the Lord by bearing burdens in His cause.\nHis affection and love should be centered upon Christ and heavenly\nthings, and he should be forming a character for everlasting life.\nDear K has very limited ideas of what constitutes a Christian.\nShe has freed herself from burdens which Christ has borne for her.\nShe is not willing to bear His cross and has not exercised to the\nbest account the ability, the talents, given her of God. She has not\ngrown strong in moral fortitude and courage, nor felt the weight\nof individual responsibility. She has not loved to bear reproach for\nChrist\u2019s sake, considering the promise: \u201cIf ye be reproached for the\nname of Christ, happy are ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God\nresteth upon you.\u201d \u201cIf we suffer, we shall also reign with Him.\u201d The\nMaster has a work for each to do. None can be idle, none can be\ncareless and selfish, and yet perfect Christian character. He wants\nall of your family to unclose their hearts to the benign influence of\nHis love and grace, that their compassion for others may overflow\nthe boundaries of self and the enclosures of family walls, as did the\nSamaritan\u2019s to the poor, suffering stranger who was neglected and\nleft to die by the priest and the Levite. I was shown that there are\nmany who need our sympathy and advice; and when we consider that\nwe can pass through this world but once, that we can never return to\nrepair the errors and mistakes we have made, how important that we\ngo through it as we ought!\nSome time ago I was shown the case of J. Her errors and wrongs\nwere faithfully portrayed before her; but in the last view given me\nI saw that the wrongs still existed, that she was cold and unsympa-\n500 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nthizing with her husband\u2019s children. Correction and reproof are not\ngiven by her for grave offenses merely, but for trivial matters that\nshould be passed by unnoticed. Constant faultfinding is wrong, and\nthe Spirit of Christ cannot abide in the heart where it exists. She[532]\nis disposed to pass over the good in her children without a word of\napproval, but is ever ready to bear down with censure if any wrong is\nseen. This ever discourages children and leads to habits of heedless-\nness. It stirs up the evil in the heart and causes it to cast up mire and\ndirt. In children who are habitually censured there will be a spirit\nof \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d and evil passions will frequently be manifested\nregardless of consequences.\nWhenever the mother can speak a word of commendation for\nthe good conduct of her children, she should do so. She should\nencourage them by words of approval and looks of love. These will\nbe as sunshine to the heart of a child and will lead to the cultivation of\nself-respect and pride of character. Sister J should cultivate love and\nsympathy. She should manifest tender affection for the motherless\nchildren under her care. This would be a blessing to these children\nof God\u2019s love and would be reflected back upon her in affection and\nlove.\nChildren have sensitive, loving natures. They are easily pleased\nand easily made unhappy. By gentle discipline in loving words and\nacts, mothers may bind their children to their hearts. To manifest\nseverity and to be exacting with children are great mistakes. Uniform\nfirmness and unimpassioned control are necessary to the discipline of\nevery family. Say what you mean calmly, move with consideration,\nand carry out what you say without deviation.\nIt will pay to manifest affection in your association with your\nchildren. Do not repel them by lack of sympathy in their childish\nsports, joys, and griefs. Never let a frown gather upon your brow\nor a harsh word escape your lips. God writes all these words in\nHis book of records. Harsh words sour the temper and wound the\nhearts of children, and in some cases these wounds are difficult to\nheal. Children are sensitive to the least injustice, and some become\ndiscouraged under it and will neither heed the loud, angry voice of\ncommand nor care for threatenings of punishment. Rebellion is too\nfrequently established in the hearts of children through the wrong[533]\ndiscipline of the parents, when if a proper course had been taken,\nMan\u2019s Duty to His Fellow Men 501\nthe children would have formed good and harmonious characters. A\nmother who does not have perfect control of herself is unfit to have\nthe management of children.\nBrother M is molded by the positive temperament of his wife.\nHe has become in a degree selfish like her. His mind is almost com-\npletely occupied by \u201cme and mine,\u201d to the exclusion of other things\nof infinitely more importance. He does not take his position in his\nfamily as father of his flock and, unprejudiced and uninfluenced,\npursue a uniform course with his children. His wife is not, and with-\nout a transformation never can be, a true mother to his motherless\nchildren. Brother M, as a father to his children, has not stood in the\nposition that God would have him. These motherless children are\nGod\u2019s little ones, precious in His sight. Naturally Brother M has\na tender, refined, loving, generous, sensitive nature, while his wife\nis exactly the opposite. Instead of his molding and softening the\ncharacter of his wife, she is transforming him.\nHe thinks that in order to have peace he must let things pass\nwhich trouble his mind. He has learned that submission and the\nyielding of her opinion are not to be expected. She will rule; she\nwill carry out her ideas at any cost. Unless they are both in earnest\nin their efforts to reform, they will not obtain eternal life. They have\nhad light, but have neglected to follow it. Selfish love of the world\nhas blinded their perceptions and hardened their hearts. J needs to\nsee that unless she lays aside her selfishness, and overcomes her will\nand her temper, she cannot have heaven. She would mar all heaven\nwith these elements in her character. I warn Sister J to repent. I call\nupon her in the name of my Master to arouse quickly from her stupid\nindifference, to heed the counsel of the True Witness, and zealously\nrepent; for she is imperiling her soul.\nGod is merciful. He will now accept the offering of a broken\nheart and a contrite spirit. Will Sister J excuse herself as did the\nLevite and the priest, for not seeing and feeling others\u2019 woes, and [534]\npass by on the other side? God holds her accountable for neglect of\nduty in not exercising sympathy and tenderness for the unfortunate.\nShe does not keep the commandments of God which plainly show\nher duty to her neighbor. Said Christ to the lawyer: \u201cThis do, and\nthou shalt live.\u201d Thus a neglect of duty to our neighbor will result in\nour loss of eternal life.\n502 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nFamily Exclusiveness\nK, poor child, like many others, has a work to do that she has\nnever dreamed of. She has backslidden from God. Her thoughts are\ntoo much upon herself, and she seeks to please the world, not by\ndisinterested love for souls and by seeking to turn them to Christ,\nbut by her lack of spirituality, and her conformity to the world in\nspirit and works. She should die to self and obtain an experience in\nwell-doing. She is cold and unsympathizing. She needs to have all\nthis icy, unapproachable spirit subdued, melted away by the sunshine\nof Christ\u2019s love. She is very much shut up to herself. God saw that\nshe was a poor dwarfed plant, bearing no fruit, nothing but leaves.\nHer thoughts were almost exclusively occupied with \u201cme and mine.\u201d\nIn mercy He has been pruning this plant of His love, lopping off\nthe branches, that the roots might strike down deeper. He has been\nseeking to draw this child to Himself. Her religious life has been\nalmost entirely without fruit. She is accountable for the talent God\nhas given her. She may be useful; she may be a co-worker with\nChrist if she will break down the wall of selfishness which has shut\nher away from God\u2019s light and love.\nThere are many who need our sympathy and advice, but not that\nadvice which implies superiority in the giver and inferiority in the\nreceiver. K needs the softening, melting love of God in her heart.\nThe looks and tones of the voice should be modulated by thoughtful\nconsideration and tender, respectful love. Every look and every tone\nof voice that implies, \u201cI am superior,\u201d chills the atmosphere of her[535]\npresence and is more like an icicle than a ray of light that gives\nwarmth. My sister, your influence is positive. You mold those with\nwhom you associate, or else you cannot agree with them. You have\nnot the least thought of being molded yourself by the better influence\nof others and of yielding your judgment and your opinions to them.\nYou will reason for your way and justify your ideas and your course.\nIf you do not convince others you will recur again and again to\nthe same point. This trait in your character will be a valuable one\nif sanctified to God and controlled by His Holy Spirit; but if not,\nit will prove a curse to you and a curse to others. Assertions and\nadvice which savor of a dictatorial spirit are not good fruit. You\nneed the softening, melting love of Christ in your heart, which will\nMan\u2019s Duty to His Fellow Men 503\nbe reflected in all your acts toward your family and to all who are\nbrought under your influence.\nI fear, greatly fear, that J will fail of heaven. She loves the world\nand the things of the world so well that she has no love to spare for\nJesus. She is so incrusted in selfishness that the illuminating light\nfrom heaven cannot penetrate the cold, dark walls of self-love and\nself-esteem which she has been building up for a lifetime. Love is\nthe key to open hearts, but the precious plant of love has not been\ncherished. J has so long blinded her eyes to her selfishness that she\ncannot now discern it. She has had so little experimental religion\nthat in heart she is of the world, and I fear that this world is all the\nheaven she will ever have. Her influence over her husband is not\ngood. He is swayed by it and does not see the necessity of being\nfortified by the grace of God to stand for the right with true moral\ncourage. Not only does she fail to realize and do the work that God\nrequires of her, but she exerts an overpowering influence to hold her\nhusband and tie his hands. And she has succeeded to a great extent.\nHe is blinded.\nBrother M should consider that God has claims upon him which\nare above every earthly relationship. He needs the eye-salve, the [536]\nwhite raiment, and the gold, that he may have a symmetrical char-\nacter and an abundant entrance into the kingdom of God. Nothing\nshort of an entire conversion can ever open the soul of his wife to\nsee her errors and to confess her wrongs. She has great changes to\nmake, which she has not made because she did not realize her true\ncondition and could not see the necessity of reform. So far from\nbeing willing to learn of the heavenly Teacher, who was meek and\nlowly of heart, she considers meekness servility; and a becoming\nspirit, lowliness of mind to esteem others better than herself, she\nregards as degrading and humiliating.\nJ has a positive, imperious, proud, self-willed spirit. She does\nnot see anything particularly desirable in a meek and quiet spirit that\nshe should covet it. This valuable ornament possesses so little value\nfor her that she cannot consent to wear it. She has, too frequently,\na spirit of resentment which is as opposite to the Spirit of God as\nthe east is to the west. True gentleness is a gem of great value in the\nsight of God. A meek and quiet spirit will not be ever looking out\n504 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nfor happiness for itself, but will seek for self-forgetfulness and find\nsweet content and true satisfaction in making others happy.\nIn the providence of God, Sister N has been separated from her\nfather\u2019s family. Although, with others, she shares the characteristics\nof the family association, bearing grave responsibilities has led her\nout of herself and has given her an interest in others\u2019 woes. She\nhas, in a measure, opened her heart in sympathy and love for God\u2019s\nfamily, taking an interest in others. The work and cause of God have\nengaged her attention. She has felt, in some degree, that poor fallen\nmortals are one great brotherhood. She has had to educate herself to\nthink for others, do for others, and forget self; and yet she has not\ncultivated as thoroughly as she should the interest, sympathy, and\naffection for others that are necessary for the followers of Christ.\nShe needs to have greater sympathy and less tense, rigid justice.\nAs she has given her interest and time to the great subject of health\nreform she has reached out beyond self. As she has done this she\nhas been blessed. The more she does for others\u2019 good, the more she[537]\nsees to do and the more she feels inclined to do.\nHer work for others frequently brings her where the exercise\nof faith is necessary to bring her through hard and trying positions.\nBut answers to earnest prayers are realized, and faith, love, and\nconfidence in God are strengthened. Through oft repeated perplex-\nities and trials, experience is obtained. God is molding the heart\ninto something more like Himself. And yet self clamors constantly\nfor the victory. Sister N needs to cultivate more tenderness and\nthoughtful care in her daily connection with others. She needs to\nstudy to subdue self. If she is indeed a Christian she will feel that\nshe must devote the best part, and if need be the whole, of her life to\nunselfish, patient toil and thus show her love for the Master. Without\nthis experience she would fall far short of perfection of Christian\ncharacter.\nSister N has taken some advance steps, and the family feel that\nshe has left them, and this is a crucifixion to them. They do not feel\nthat she now has the same interest and affections and objects in life\nas themselves. They feel that they can no longer enjoy, as formerly,\nthe society of their sister. They feel that she is to blame, that she has\nchanged, and that her sympathy is no longer one with theirs. The\nreason for this lack of assimilation of feeling is that Sister N has\nMan\u2019s Duty to His Fellow Men 505\nbeen advancing in feeling for others\u2019 woes, while they have been\nslothful servants, not doing the work God has given them to do on\nearth. Consequently they have been retrograding. The family have\nselfishly shut up their interest and affection to themselves and the\nlove of the world.\nN has been a worker in a good cause. The health reform has been\nto her a subject of great importance, for her experience has shown\nher its necessity. Her father\u2019s family have not seen the necessity of\nhealth reform. They have not seen the part that it acts in the closing\nwork of these last days, because they have not been inclined to see.\nThey have dropped into the cart rut of custom, and it is a difficult\nwork to make the effort required to get out. They would rather be\nlet alone. It is a terrible thing to rust from inaction. But this family [538]\nwill surely be weighed in the balances and found wanting unless\nthey begin at once to do something. \u201cNow if any man have not the\nSpirit of Christ, he is none of His.\u201d This is close language. Who can\nstand the test? The word of God is to us a daguerreotype of the mind\nof God and of Christ, also of man fallen, and of man renewed after\nthe image of Christ, possessing the divine mind. We may compare\nour thoughts, feelings, and intentions with the picture of Christ. We\nhave no relationship with Him unless we are willing to work the\nworks of Christ.\nChrist came to do His Father\u2019s will. Are we following in His\nsteps? All who have named the name of Christ should be constantly\nseeking for a more intimate acquaintance with Him, that they may\nwalk even as He walked, and do the works of Christ. We should\nappropriate the lessons of His life to our lives. Christ \u201cgave Himself\nfor us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto\nHimself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.\u201d \u201cHereby perceive\nwe the love of God, because He laid down His life for us: and we\nought to lay down our lives for the brethren.\u201d Here is the work of\nself-denial upon which we must enter with cheerfulness, in imitation\nof the example of our Redeemer. The Christian\u2019s life must be one of\nconflict and of sacrifice. The path of duty should be followed, not\nthe path of inclination and choice.\nWhen the family of Brother I see the work before them, and\ndo the work God has left them to do, they will not be so widely\nseparated from Brother and Sister O and Sister N, and those who\n506 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nare working in union with the Master. It may take time to attain\nperfect submission to God\u2019s will, but we can never stop short of it\nand be fitted for heaven. True religion will lead its possessor on to\nperfection. Your thoughts, your words, and your actions, as well as\nyour appetites and passions, must be brought into subjection to the\nwill of God. You must bear fruit unto holiness. Then you will be led\nto defend the poor, the fatherless, the motherless, and the afflicted.[539]\nYou will do justice to the widow and will relieve the needy. You will\ndeal justly, love mercy, and walk humbly before God.\nWe must let Christ into our hearts and homes if we would walk\nin the light. Home should be made all that the word implies. It\nshould be a little heaven upon earth, a place where the affections\nare cultivated instead of being studiously repressed. Our happiness\ndepends upon this cultivation of love, sympathy, and true courtesy\nto one another. The reason there are so many hardhearted men\nand women in our world is that true affection has been regarded\nas weakness and has been discouraged and repressed. The better\npart of the nature of persons of this class was perverted and dwarfed\nin childhood, and unless rays of divine light can melt away their\ncoldness and hardhearted selfishness, the happiness of such is buried\nforever. If we would have tender hearts, such as Jesus had when He\nwas upon the earth, and sanctified sympathy, such as the angels have\nfor sinful mortals, we must cultivate the sympathies of childhood,\nwhich are simplicity itself. Then we shall be refined, elevated, and\ndirected by heavenly principles.\nA cultivated intellect is a great treasure; but without the softening\ninfluence of sympathy and sanctified love, it is not of the highest\nvalue. We should have words and deeds of tender consideration\nfor others. We can manifest a thousand little attentions in friendly\nwords and pleasant looks, which will be reflected upon us again.\nThoughtless Christians manifest by their neglect of others that they\nare not in union with Christ. It is impossible to be in union with\nChrist and yet be unkind to others and forgetful of their rights. Many\nlong intensely for friendly sympathy. God has given each of us an\nidentity of our own, which cannot be merged in that of another; but\nour individual characteristics will be much less prominent if we are\nindeed Christ\u2019s and His will is ours. Our lives should be consecrated\nto the good and happiness of others, as was our Saviour\u2019s. We\nMan\u2019s Duty to His Fellow Men 507\nshould be self-forgetful, ever looking out for opportunities, even in\nlittle things, to show gratitude for the favors we have received of [540]\nothers, and watching for opportunities to cheer others and lighten\nand relieve their sorrows and burdens by acts of tender kindness and\nlittle deeds of love. These thoughtful courtesies, that, commencing\nin our families, extend outside the family circle, help make up the\nsum of life\u2019s happiness; and the neglect of these little things makes\nup the sum of life\u2019s bitterness and sorrow.\nIt is the work that we do or do not do that tells with tremendous\npower upon our lives and destinies. God requires us to improve\nevery opportunity for usefulness that is offered us. Neglect to do\nthis is perilous to our spiritual growth. We have a great work to do.\nLet us not pass in idleness the precious hours that God has given us\nin which to perfect characters for heaven. We must not be inactive\nor slothful in this work, for we have not a moment to spend without\na purpose or object. God will help us to overcome our wrongs if\nwe will pray and believe on Him. We can be more than conquerors\nthrough Him who has loved us. When the short life in this world is\nended, and we see as we are seen and know as we are known, how\nshort in duration and how small will the things of this world appear\nto us in comparison with the glory of the better world! Christ would\nnever have left the royal courts and taken humanity, and become sin\nfor the race, had He not seen that man might, with His help, become\ninfinitely happy and obtain durable riches and a life that would run\nparallel with the life of God. He knew that without His help sinful\nman could not attain these things.\nWe should have a spirit of progress. We must guard continually\nagainst being fixed in our views, feelings, and actions. The work of\nGod is onward. Reforms must be carried on, and we must take hold\nand help move on the car of reform. Energy, tempered with patience\nand ambition, and balanced by wisdom, is now needed by every\nChristian. The work of saving souls is yet left to us, the disciples of\nChrist. Not one of us is excused. Many have become dwarfed and\nstunted in their Christian life because of inaction. We should employ [541]\nour time diligently while in this world. How earnestly should we\nimprove every opportunity of doing good, of bringing others to a\nknowledge of the truth! Our motto should ever be, \u201cOnward, higher,\u201d\nsurely, steadily onward to duty and to victory.\n508 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nI have been shown in regard to the individuals mentioned that\nGod loves them and would save them if they would be saved in His\nappointed way. \u201cAnd He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver:\nand He shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and\nsilver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.\nThen shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto\nthe Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years.\u201d This is the\nprocess, the refining, purifying process, which is to be carried on\nby the Lord of hosts. The work is most trying to the soul, but it is\nonly through this process that the rubbish and defiling impurities\ncan be removed. Our trials are all necessary to bring us close to\nour heavenly Father, in obedience to His will, that we may offer\nto the Lord an offering in righteousness. To each whose name is\nhere mentioned, God has given capabilities, talents to improve. You\neach need a new and living experience in the divine life in order\nto do the will of God. No amount of past experience will suffice\nfor the present nor strengthen us to overcome the difficulties in our\npath. We must have new grace and fresh strength daily in order to\nbe victorious.\nWe are seldom, in all respects, placed in the same circumstances\ntwice. Abraham, Moses, Elijah, Daniel, and many others were all\nsorely tried, but not in the same way. Everyone has his individual\ntests and trials in the drama of life, but the very same trials seldom\ncome twice. Each has his own experience, peculiar in its character\nand circumstances, to accomplish a certain work. God has a work, a\npurpose, in the life of each of us. Every act, however small, has its\nplace in our life experience. We must have the continual light and\nexperience that come from God. We all need these, and God is more\nthan willing that we should have them if we will take them. He has\nnot closed the windows of heaven to your prayers, but you have felt[542]\nsatisfied to pass on without the divine help you so much need.\nHow little you know the bearing of your daily acts upon the\nhistory of others. You may think that what you do or say is of little\nconsequence, when the most important results for good or evil are\nthe consequence of our words and actions. The words and actions\nlooked upon as so small and unimportant are links in the long chain\nof human events. You have not felt the need of God\u2019s manifesting\nHis will to us in all the acts of our daily life. With our first parents\nMan\u2019s Duty to His Fellow Men 509\nthe desire for a single gratification of appetite opened the floodgate\nof woe and sin upon the world. Would that you, my dear sisters,\nmight feel that every step you take may have a lasting and controlling\ninfluence upon your own lives and the characters of others. Oh, how\nmuch need, then, of communion with God! What need of divine\ngrace to direct every step and show us how to perfect Christian\ncharacters!\nChristians will have new scenes and new trials to pass through\nwhere past experience cannot be a sufficient guide. We have greater\nneed to learn of the divine Teacher now than at any other period of\nour lives. And the more experience we gain, the nearer we draw to-\nward the pure light of heaven, the more shall we discern in ourselves\nthat needs reforming. We may all do a good work in blessing others\nif we will seek counsel of God and follow on in obedience and faith.\nThe path of the just is progressive, from strength to strength, from\ngrace to grace, and from glory to glory. The divine illumination\nwill increase more and more, corresponding with our onward move-\nments, qualifying us to meet the responsibilities and emergencies\nbefore us.\nWhen trials press you, when despondency and dark unbelief\ncontrol your thoughts, when selfishness molds your actions, you do\nnot see your need of God and of a deep and thorough knowledge\nof His will. You know not the will of God, neither can you know\nit while you live for self. You rely upon your good intentions and\nresolutions, and the principal sum of life is composed of resolutions [543]\nmade and resolutions broken. What you all need is to die to self,\ncease clinging to self, and surrender to God. Gladly would I comfort\nyou if I could. Gladly would I praise your good qualities, good\npurposes, and good acts; but God was not pleased to show me these.\nHe presented before me the hindrances to your gaining the noble,\nelevated character of holiness needful for you to have that you may\nnot lose the heavenly rest and immortal glory He would have you\nattain. Look away from yourselves to Jesus. He is all and in all.\nThe merits of the blood of a crucified and risen Saviour will avail\nto cleanse from the least and greatest sin. In trusting faith commit\nthe keeping of your souls to God as unto a faithful Creator. Be not\ncontinually in fear and apprehension that God will leave you. He\nnever will unless you depart from Him. Christ will come in and\n510 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ndwell with you if you will open the door of your hearts to Him.\nThere may be perfect harmony between you and the Father and His\nSon if you will die to self and live unto God.\nHow few are aware that they have darling idols, that they have\ncherished sins! God sees these sins to which you may be blinded,\nand He works with His pruning knife to strike deep and separate\nthese cherished sins from you. You all want to choose for yourselves\nthe process of purification. How hard it is for you to submit to the\ncrucifixion of self; but when the work is all submitted to God, to\nHim who knows our weakness and our sinfulness, He takes the very\nbest way to bring about the desired results. It was through constant\nconflict and simple faith that Enoch walked with God. You may all\ndo the same. You may be thoroughly converted and transformed,\nand be indeed children of God, enjoying not only the knowledge\nof His will, but, by your example, leading others in the same path\nof humble obedience and consecration. Real godliness is diffusive\nand communicative. The psalmist says: \u201cI have not hid Thy righ-\nteousness within my heart; I have declared Thy faithfulness and Thy\nsalvation: I have not concealed Thy loving-kindness and Thy truth\nfrom the great congregation.\u201d Wherever the love of God is, there is[544]\nalways a desire to express it.\nMay God help you all to make earnest efforts to gain everlasting\nlife and to lead others in the path of holiness.\n* * * * *\nChapter 48\u2014The Sin of Covetousness\nDear Brother P:\nI would make one more effort to warn you to be in earnest to\ngain the kingdom. Warning after warning has been given you, which\nyou have not heeded. But, oh, if you would even now repent of\nyour past wrong course and turn to the Lord, it might not be too\nlate for wrongs to be righted. All the powers of your mind have\nbeen devoted to money getting. You have worshiped money. It has\nbeen your god. The rod of God is hanging over you. His judgments\nmay overtake you at any moment and you go down to the grave\nunready, your garments spotted and stained with the corruptions of\nthe world. What is your record in heaven? Every dollar that you\nhave accumulated has been like an extra link in the chain that fastens\nyou to this poor world. Your passion to get gain has been continually\nstrengthening. The burden of your thoughts has been how you\ncould obtain more means. You have had a fearful experience, which\nshould be a warning to those who allow the love of the world to take\npossession of their souls. You have become mammon\u2019s slave. What\nwill you say when the Master shall demand of you an account of\nyour stewardship? You have allowed the love of money getting to\nbecome the ruling passion of your life. You are as much intoxicated\nwith the love of money as is the inebriate with his liquor.\nJesus has pleaded that the unfruitful tree might be spared a little\nlonger; and I make one more plea for you to put forth no faint effort,\nbut a most earnest one, for the kingdom. Rescue yourself from the\nsnare of Satan before the word, \u201cHe is joined to idols, let him alone,\u201d\nshall be spoken in regard to you in heaven. All money lovers, like\nyourself, will one day cry in bitter anguish: \u201cOh, the deceitfulness [545]\nof riches! I have sold my soul for money.\u201d Your only hope now is to\nmake no feeble move, but to turn square about. Resolutely call to\nyour aid the will power that you have so long exercised in the wrong\ndirection, and now work in the opposite direction. This is the only\nway for you to overcome covetousness.\n511\n512 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nGod has opened ways in which covetousness can be overcome\u2014\nby performing benevolent deeds. By your life you are saying that\nyou esteem the treasures of the world more highly than immortal\nriches. You are saying: \u201cFarewell, heaven; farewell, immortal life; I\nhave chosen this world.\u201d You are bartering away the pearl of great\nprice for present gain. While thus admonished of God, while in His\nprovidence He has, as it were, already placed your feet in the dark\nriver, will you, dare you, cultivate your money-loving propensities?\nWill you, as the last act of a misspent life, overreach and retain that\nwhich is another\u2019s just due? Will you reason yourself into the belief\nthat you are doing justice to your brother? Will you add another act\nof scheming and overreaching to those already written against you\nin the records above? Shall the blow of God\u2019s retributive judgment\nfall upon you and you be called without warning to pass through the\ndark waters?\nOur Saviour frequently and earnestly rebuked the sin of cov-\netousness. \u201cAnd He said unto them, Take heed, and beware of\ncovetousness: for a man\u2019s life consisteth not in the abundance of\nthe things which he possesseth. And He spake a parable unto them,\nsaying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:\nand he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I\nhave no room where to bestow my fruits? And he said, This will I\ndo: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I\nbestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul,\nthou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat,\ndrink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night\nthy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things\nbe, which thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for\nhimself, and is not rich toward God.\u201d\nGod has made a law for His people that a tenth of all the increase[546]\nshall be His. I have given you, says God, nine tenths; I ask one tenth\nof all the increase. That one tenth the rich man had withheld from\nGod. If he had not done this, if he had loved God supremely instead\nof loving and serving himself, he would not have accumulated so\ngreat treasures that there would be lack of room to bestow them.\nHad he bestowed his goods upon his needy brethren to supply their\nnecessities, there would have been no need of tearing down and\nbuilding greater barns. But he had disregarded the principles of the\nSin of Covetousness 513\nlaw of God. He had not loved the Lord with all his heart and his\nneighbor as himself. Had he used his wealth as a bounty lent him of\nGod with which to do good he would have laid up treasure in heaven\nand been rich in good works.\nThe length and usefulness of life do not consist in the amount of\nour earthly possessions. Those who use their wealth in doing good\nwill see no necessity for large accumulations in this world; for the\ntreasure which is used to advance the cause of God and which is\ngiven to the needy in Christ\u2019s name is given to Christ, and He lays\nit up for us in the bank of heaven in bags which wax not old. He\nwho does this is rich toward God, and his heart will be where his\ntreasures are secured. He who humbly uses what God has given for\nthe honor of the Giver, freely giving as he has received, may feel the\npeace and assurance in all his business that God\u2019s hand is over him\nfor good, and he himself will bear the impress of God, having the\nFather\u2019s smile.\nMany have pitied the lot of the Israel of God in being compelled\nto give systematically, besides making liberal offerings yearly. An\nall-wise God knew best what system of benevolence would be in\naccordance with His providence, and has given His people directions\nin regard to it. It has ever proved that nine tenths are worth more\nto them than ten tenths. Those who have thought to increase their\ngains by withholding from God, or by bringing Him an inferior\noffering,\u2014the lame, the blind, or the diseased,\u2014have been sure to\nsuffer loss.\nProvidence, though unseen, is ever at work in the affairs of men. [547]\nGod\u2019s hand can prosper or withhold, and He frequently withholds\nfrom one while He seems to prosper another. All this is to test and\nprove men and to reveal the heart. He lets misfortune overtake one\nbrother while He prospers others to see if those whom He favors\nhave His fear before their eyes and will perform the duty enjoined\nupon them in His word to love their neighbor as themselves and to\nhelp their poorer brother from a love to do good. Acts of generosity\nand benevolence were designed by God to keep the hearts of the\nchildren of men tender and sympathetic, and to encourage in them\nan interest and affection for one another in imitation of the Master,\nwho for our sakes became poor, that we through His poverty might\n514 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nbe made rich. The law of tithing was founded upon an enduring\nprinciple and was designed to be a blessing to man.\nThe system of benevolence was arranged to prevent that great\nevil, covetousness. Christ saw that in the prosecution of business the\nlove of riches would be the greatest cause of rooting true godliness\nout of the heart. He saw that the love of money would freeze deep\nand hard into men\u2019s souls, stopping the flow of generous impulses\nand closing their senses to the wants of the suffering and the afflicted.\n\u201cTake heed,\u201d was His oft-repeated warning, \u201cand beware of covetous-\nness.\u201d \u201cYe cannot serve God and mammon.\u201d The oft-repeated and\nstriking warnings of our Redeemer are in marked contrast with the\nactions of His professed followers who evidence in their lives so\ngreat eagerness to be rich and who show that the words of Christ\nare lost upon them. Covetousness is one of the most common and\npopular sins of the last days, and has a paralyzing influence upon\nthe soul.\nBrother P, the desire for wealth has been the central idea of your\nmind. This one passion for money getting has deadened every high\nand noble consideration, and has made you indifferent to the needs\nand interests of others. You have made yourself nearly as unimpress-\nible as a piece of iron. Your gold and your silver are cankered, and[548]\nhave become an eating canker to the soul. Had your benevolence\ngrown with your riches, you would have regarded money as a means\nby which you could do good. Our Redeemer, who knew man\u2019s\ndanger in regard to covetousness, has provided a safeguard against\nthis dreadful evil. He has arranged the plan of salvation so that it\nbegins and ends in benevolence. Christ offered Himself, an infinite\nsacrifice. This, in and of itself, bears directly against covetousness\nand exalts benevolence.\nConstant, self-denying benevolence is God\u2019s remedy for the\ncankering sins of selfishness and covetousness. God has arranged\nsystematic benevolence to sustain His cause and relieve the necessi-\nties of the suffering and needy. He has ordained that giving should\nbecome a habit, that it may counteract the dangerous and deceit-\nful sin of covetousness. Continual giving starves covetousness to\ndeath. Systematic benevolence is designed in the order of God to\ntear away treasures from the covetous as fast as they are gained and\nto consecrate them to the Lord, to whom they belong.\nSin of Covetousness 515\nThis system is so arranged that men may give something from\ntheir wages every day and lay by for their Lord a portion of the\nprofits of every investment. The constant practice of God\u2019s plan\nof systematic benevolence weakens covetousness and strengthens\nbenevolence. If riches increase, men, even those professing godli-\nness, set their hearts upon them; and the more they have, the less\nthey give to the treasury of the Lord. Thus riches make men selfish,\nand hoarding feeds covetousness; and these evils strengthen by ac-\ntive exercise. God knows our danger and has hedged us about with\nmeans to prevent our own ruin. He requires the constant exercise of\nbenevolence, that the force of habit in good works may break the\nforce of habit in an opposite direction.\nGod requires an appropriation of means for benevolent objects\nevery week, that in the frequent exercise of this good quality the heart\nmay be kept open like a flowing stream and not allowed to close up.\nBy exercise, benevolence constantly enlarges and strengthens, until\nit becomes a principle and reigns in the soul. It is highly dangerous [549]\nto spirituality to allow selfishness and covetousness the least room\nin the heart.\nThe word of God has much to say in regard to sacrificing. Riches\nare from the Lord and belong to Him. \u201cBoth riches and honor come\nof Thee.\u201d \u201cThe silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, saith the Lord\nof hosts.\u201d \u201cFor every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon\na thousand hills.\u201d \u201cThe earth is the Lord\u2019s, and the fullness thereof;\nthe world, and they that dwell therein.\u201d It is the Lord thy God that\ngiveth thee power to get wealth.\nRiches are in themselves transient and unsatisfying. We are\nwarned not to trust in uncertain riches. \u201cRiches certainly make them-\nselves wings; they fly away.\u201d \u201cLay not up for yourselves treasures\nupon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves\nbreak through and steal.\u201d\nRiches bring no relief in man\u2019s greatest distress. \u201cRiches profit\nnot in the day of wrath.\u201d \u201cNeither their silver nor their gold shall\nbe able to deliver them in the day of the Lord\u2019s wrath.\u201d \u201cBecause\nthere is wrath, beware lest He take thee away with His stroke: then\na great ransom cannot deliver thee.\u201d This warning, my brother, is\nappropriate in your case.\n516 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nWhat provision, Brother P, have you made for eternal life? Have\nyou a good foundation against the time to come, that will secure to\nyourself eternal joys? Oh, may God arouse you! May you, my dear\nbrother, now, just now, commence to work in earnest to get some of\nyour gain and riches into the treasury of God. Not a dollar of it is\nyours. All is God\u2019s, and you have claimed for your own that which\nGod has lent you to devote to good works. Your time is very short.\nWork with all your might. By repentance you may now find pardon.\nYou must loosen your grasp of earthly possessions and fasten your\naffections upon God. You must be a converted man. Agonize with\nGod. Do not be content to perish forever, but make an effort for\nsalvation before it shall be everlastingly too late.\nIt is not now too late for wrongs to be righted. Show your\nrepentance for past wrongs by redeeming the time. Where you have\nwronged anyone, make restitution as it comes to your mind. This is[550]\nyour only hope of the pardoning love of God. It will be like taking\nout the right eye or cutting off the right arm, but there is no other way\nfor you. You have made efforts repeatedly, but have failed because\nyou have loved money, some of which has not been very honestly\ngained. You would not try to redeem the past by restitution. When\nyou begin to do this, there will be hope for you. If during the few\nremaining days of your life you choose to go on as you have done,\nyour case will be hopeless; you will lose both worlds; you will see\nthe saints of God glorified in the heavenly city and yourself thrust\nout; you will have no part in that precious life which was purchased\nfor you at an infinite cost, but which you valued so little as to sell it\nfor earthly riches.\nNow there is a little time left you. Will you work? Will you\nrepent? Or will you die all unready, worshiping money, glorying in\nyour riches, and forgetting God and heaven? No faint struggle or\nfeeble efforts will wean your affections from the world. Jesus will\nhelp you. In every earnest effort you make, He will be near you and\nbless your endeavors. You must make earnest efforts or you will be\nlost. I warn you not to delay one moment, but commence just now.\nYou have long disgraced the Christian name by your covetousness\nand small dealing. Now you may honor it by working in an opposite\ndirection and by letting all see that there is a power in the truth of\nSin of Covetousness 517\nGod to transform human nature. You may, in the strength of God,\nsave your soul if you will.\nYou have a work to do which you should begin at once. Satan will\nstand by your side, as he did by the side of Christ in the wilderness\nof temptation, to overcome you with reasonings, to pervert your\njudgment, and to paralyze your sense of right and equity. If you do\njustice in one instance, you must not wait for Satan to overpower your\ngood impulses by his reasoning. You have so long been controlled\nby selfishness and covetousness that you cannot trust yourself. I do\nnot want you to lose heaven. I have been shown the selfish acts of\nyour life, your close scheming and figuring, your bartering, and the [551]\nadvantage which you have taken of your brethren and fellow men.\nGod has every instance written in the book. Will you pray to Him to\nenlighten your mind to see where you have overreached, and then\nwill you repent and redeem the past?\nBrother P, may God help you before it is too late.\n* * * * *\nChapter 49\u2014Industry in the Ministry\nI have been shown that there is danger of our young ministers\nentering the field and engaging in the work of teaching the truth to\nothers when they are not fitted for the sacred work of God. They\nhave no just sense of the sacredness of the work for this time. They\nfeel a desire to be connected with the work, but they fail to bear the\nburdens lying directly in the pathway of duty. They do that which\ncosts them but little taxation and inconvenience, and neglect to put\ntheir whole souls into the work.\nSome are too indolent to make a success of life in business\nmatters and are deficient in the experience necessary to make them\ngood Christians in a private capacity; yet they feel competent to\nengage in the work which is of all others the most difficult, that of\ndealing with minds and trying to convert souls from error to the\ntruth. The hearts of some of these ministers are not sanctified by\nthe truth. All such are merely stumbling blocks to sinners and are\nstanding in the way of real laborers. It will take more stern labor\nto educate them to right ideas, that they may not injure the cause\nof God, than to do the work. God cannot be glorified or His cause\nadvanced by unconsecrated workmen who are entirely deficient in\nthe qualifications necessary to make a gospel minister. Some young\nministers who go forth to labor for others need themselves to be\nthoroughly converted to the genuine religion of the Bible.\nI was shown the case of Brother R of -----, which in many re-[552]\nspects represents the cases of others. I was shown that Brother R is\nno real advantage to the cause of God and never can be unless he\nhas a thorough conversion. He has many defects in his character\nwhich he must see before he can be accepted of God as a laborer in\nHis vineyard. The work of God is sacred. In the first place, Brother\nR has not met with that change of heart which transforms the man\nand is called conversion. He has a religion of the head, but he needs\nthe work of the grace of God upon the heart to be carried out in the\nlife before he can understandingly point others to the Lamb of God\n518\nIndustry in the Ministry 519\nwho taketh away the sins of the world. The work for this time is\naltogether too solemn and too important to be handled with unclean\nhands and impure hearts.\nBrother R has a very unhappy temperament. This makes trouble\nfor himself and for his best friends. He is naturally jealous, suspi-\ncious, and faultfinding. Those most closely connected with him will\nfeel this most deeply. He has much self-love and large self-esteem,\nand if he is not especially regarded and made an object of attention\nhe feels as though someone were to blame. The fault exists in him-\nself. He loves to have his vanity flattered. He is suspicious of the\nmotives of others and shows in these feelings a very narrow, selfish\nmind. He thinks that he sees much to question, to find fault with,\nand to censure in the plan of others\u2019 labors, when the real evil exists\nin his own unhumbled, unconsecrated heart. Self, in him, must die,\nand he must learn of Jesus, who is meek and lowly of heart, or he\nwill fail of perfecting Christian character and of gaining heaven at\nlast.\nBrother R has made a failure in his manner of seeking to teach\nthe truth to others. His spirit is not winning. Self is mixed with\nall his efforts. He is quite particular about the externals, so far as\nhis apparel is concerned, as though this would designate him as a\nminister of Christ; but he has neglected the inward adornment of\nthe soul. He has not felt the necessity of seeking for a beautiful,\nharmonious character, resembling the character of Christ, the correct\npattern. The meekness and humility which characterized the life [553]\nof Jesus would win hearts and give him access to souls; but when\nBrother R speaks in his own spirit, the people see so much self\nexhibited, and so little of the spirit of humility, that their hearts are\nnot touched, but grow hard and cold under his preaching, because it\nlacks the divine unction.\nThe self-confident, self-exalted spirit of Brother R must be put\naway, and he must see that he is sinful and in need of continual\ngrace and power from God to press through the moral darkness of\nthis degenerate age and reach souls who need to be saved. He has\nput on upon the outside the dignity of a gospel minister, while he\nhas not felt that a real experience in the mystery of godliness and a\nknowledge of the divine will were essential to making a success of\npresenting the truth.\n520 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nBrother R is too cold and unsympathizing. He does not come\ndirectly to hearts by the Christian simplicity, tenderness, and love\nwhich characterized the life of Christ. In this respect it is essential\nthat every man who labors for the salvation of souls should imitate\nthe pattern given him in the life of Christ. If men fail to educate\nthemselves to become workers in the vineyard of the Lord, they\nmight better be spared than not. It would be poor policy to support\nfrom the treasury of God those who really mar and injure His work,\nand who are constantly lowering the standard of Christianity.\nIn order for a man to become a successful minister, something\nmore than book knowledge is essential. The laborer for souls needs\nintegrity, intelligence, industry, energy, and tact. All these are highly\nessential for the success of a minister of Christ. No man with these\nqualifications can be inferior, but will have commanding influence.\nUnless the laborer in God\u2019s cause can gain the confidence of those\nfor whom he is laboring, he can do but little good. The worker in\nthe Lord\u2019s vineyard must daily derive strength from above to resist\nwrong and to maintain uprightness through the varied trials of life,\nand his soul must be brought into harmony with his Redeemer. He\ncan be a co-worker with Jesus, working as He worked, loving as He[554]\nloved, and possessing, like Him, moral power to stand the strongest\ntests of character.\nBrother R should cultivate simplicity. He should lay aside his\nfalse dignity and let the Spirit of God come in and sanctify, elevate,\npurify, and ennoble his life. Then he can bear the burden for souls\nwhich a true gospel minister must feel when presenting a message of\nsolemn warning to those in peril, who must perish in their darkness\nunless they accept the light of truth. This dignity borrowed from his\nRedeemer will adorn with divine grace, for by it he is brought into\nclose union with Jesus Christ.\nI was carried forward in the life of Brother R, and then carried\nback to review the result of his labors while he was attempting to\nteach others the truth. I saw that some few would listen, and, as far\nas the head is concerned, might be convinced; but Brother R has not\nan experimental, daily, living knowledge of the grace of God and\nHis saving power, and he cannot convey to others what he does not\nhimself possess. He has not the experience of a truly converted man.\nIndustry in the Ministry 521\nHow, then, can God make him a blessing to sinners? He is blind\nhimself, while trying to lead the blind.\nI was shown that his work has spoiled good fields for others.\nSome men who were truly consecrated to God and who felt the\nburden of the work might have done good and brought souls into the\ntruth in places where he has made attempts without success, but after\nhis superficial work the golden opportunity was gone. The minds\nthat might have been convinced, and the hearts that might have been\nsoftened, have been hardened and prejudiced under his efforts.\nI looked to see what souls of value were holding on to the truth\nas the result of his labors. I watched closely to see what watchcare\nhe had had for souls, to strengthen and encourage them, a labor\nwhich should ever accompany the ministry of the word. I could not\nsee one who would not have been in a far better condition had he\nnot received the first impressions of the truth from him. It is about\nimpossible for a stream to rise higher than its fountainhead. The [555]\nman who bears the truth to sinners stands in a fearfully responsible\nposition. Either he will convert souls to Christ or his efforts will\nbalance them in the wrong direction.\nI have been shown that Brother R is an indolent man. He loves\nhis pleasure and his ease. He does not love physical labor, neither\ndoes he love close application of the mind to the study of the word.\nHe wants to take things lazily. He will go to a place and attempt\nto introduce the truth there, when his heart is not in it. He feels no\nweight of the work, no real burden for souls. He has not the love\nof souls at heart. He lets his inclinations divert him from the work,\nsuffers his feelings to control him, and leaves the work and goes back\nto his family. He has not an experience in self-denial, in sacrificing\nhis ease and his inclinations. He labors too much with respect to\nwages. He does not apply himself closely to his work, but merely\ntouches it here and there without perseverance or earnestness, and\nso makes a success of nothing. God frowns upon all such professed\nworkers. They are unfaithful in everything. Their consciences are\nnot sensitive and tender.\nTo introduce the truth into places and then lack courage, energy,\nand tact to carry the matter through is a great error, for the work is\nleft without that thorough and persevering effort being made which is\npositively essential in these places. If matters go hard, if opposition\n522 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\narises, he makes a cowardly retreat instead of fleeing to God with\nfasting and praying and weeping, and by faith clinging to the Source\nof light and power and strength until the clouds break away and the\ndarkness disperses. Faith grows strong by coming in conflict with\ndoubts and opposing influences. The experience gained in these\ntrials is of more value than the most costly jewels.\nThe result of your labors, Brother R, should make you ashamed.\nGod cannot accept them. It would be better for the cause of God\nif you would cease preaching, and take up a work which involves\nless responsibility. It would be better for you to go to work with\nyour hands. Humble your heart before God; be faithful in temporal[556]\nmatters; and when you show that you are faithful in the smaller\nresponsibilities, God may commit to you higher trusts. \u201cHe that is\nfaithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that\nis unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\u201d You need a deeper\nexperience in religious things. I advise you to go to work with your\nhands and earnestly plead with God for an experience for yourself.\nCling to Jesus and never, never dare to assume the responsibilities\nof a gospel minister until you are a converted man and have a meek\nand peaceable spirit. You need to tarry away from the work of God\ntill you are endowed with power from on high. No man can make a\nsuccess of saving souls unless Christ works with his efforts and self\nis put out of sight.\nA minister of Christ should be thoroughly furnished unto all good\nworks. You have made a miserable failure. You must show in your\nfamily that kindly consideration, that tenderness, love, gentleness,\nnoble forbearance, and true courtesy, that is becoming to the head of\na family, before you can make a success of winning souls to Christ.\nIf you have not wisdom to manage the small number with whom\nyou are closely united, how can you make a success of managing a\nlarger company, who are not especially interested in yourself? Your\nwife needs to be truly and thoroughly converted to God. Neither of\nyou are in a condition to correctly represent our faith. You both need\na thorough conversion.\nRetirement from the work of God at present is best for you.\nBrother R, you have neither perseverance nor moral backbone. You\nare very deficient in those traits of character which are necessary for\nthe work of God at this time. You have not received that education\nIndustry in the Ministry 523\nin practical life that is necessary for you in order to make a success\nas a practical minister of Christ. Your education has been deficient\nin many respects. Your parents have not read your character, nor\ntrained you to overcome its defects, to the end that you might develop\na symmetrical character, and possess firmness, self-denial, self-\ncontrol, humility, and moral power. You know very little of practical [557]\nlife or of perseverance under difficulties. You have a strong desire\nto controvert others\u2019 ideas and to press forward your own. This is\nthe result of your feelings of self-sufficiency and of following your\nown inclinations in youth.\nYou do not see yourself and your errors. You are not willing to\nbe a learner, but have a great desire to teach. You form opinions of\nyour own and cling to your peculiar ideas with a persistency that is\nwearying. You are anxious to carry your points, and in your eyes\nyour ideas are of greater importance than the experienced judgment\nof men of moral worth who have been proved in this cause. You\nhave been flattered with the idea that you had ability that would\nbe prized and make you a valuable man; but these qualities have\nnot been tested and proved. You have a one-sided education. You\nhave no inclination or love for the homely, daily duties of life. Your\nindolence would be sufficient to disqualify you for the work of the\nministry were there no other reasons why you should not engage in\nit. The cause does not need preachers so much as workers. Of all the\nvocations of life, there is none that requires such earnest, faithful,\npersevering, self-sacrificing workers as the cause of God in these\nlast days.\nThe enterprise of obtaining eternal life is above every other\nconsideration. God wants no laggards in His cause. The work of\nwarning sinners to flee from the wrath to come requires earnest\nmen who feel the burden of souls and who will not be ready to\navail themselves of every excuse to avoid burdens or to leave the\nwork. Little discouragements, as unpleasant weather or imaginary\ninfirmities, seem sufficient to Brother R to excuse him from making\nexertion. He will even appeal to his sympathies; and when duties\narise that he does not feel inclined to perform, when his indolence\nclamors for indulgence, he frequently makes the excuse that he is\nsick, when there is no reason why he should be sick, unless through\nindolent habits and indulgence of appetite his entire system has\n524 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nbecome clogged by inaction. He may have good health if he will\nstrictly observe the laws of life and health, and carry out the light\nupon health reform in all his habits.\nBrother R is not the man for the work in these last days unless[558]\nhe entirely reforms. God does not call for ministers who are too\nindolent to engage in physical labor, to bear the testing message of\nwarning to the world. He wants workers in His cause. Real, earnest,\nself-denying workers will accomplish something.\nBrother R, your teaching the truth to others has been an entire\nmistake. If God calls a man, He will not make so great a blunder\nas to take one of so little experience in practical life and spiritual\nthings as you have had. You have ability to talk, as far as that is\nconcerned, but God\u2019s cause requires men of consecration and energy.\nThese traits you may cultivate; you may gain them if you will. By\nperseveringly cultivating the opposite traits of those wherein you\nnow fail, you may learn to overcome those deficiencies in your\ncharacter which have increased from your youth. To merely go out\nand speak to the people now and then is not working for God. There\nis no real work in it.\nThose who labor for God have but just begun the work when\nthey have given a discourse in the desk. After this comes the real\nlabor, the visiting from house to house, conversing with members\nof families, praying with them, and coming close in sympathy to\nthose whom we wish to benefit. It will not detract from the dignity\nof a minister of Christ to be awake to see and realize the temporal\nburdens and cares of the families he visits, and to be useful, seeking\nto relieve them where he can by engaging in physical labor. In this\nway he can have a power of influence to disarm opposition and break\ndown prejudice, that he would fail to have if he were in every other\nrespect fully efficient as a minister of Christ.\nOur young ministers have not the burden of writing that the older\nand more experienced ones have. They have not a multiplicity of\nresponsibilities which tax the mind and wear upon the man. But it\nis these very burdens of care that perfect Christian experience, give\nmoral power, and make strong, efficient men of those engaged in the\nwork of God. Avoiding burdens and disagreeable responsibilities[559]\nwill never make our ministers strong men that can be depended upon\nin a religious crisis. Many of our young ministers are as weak as\nIndustry in the Ministry 525\nbabes in the work of God. And some who have been engaged in the\nwork of teaching the truth for years are not yet able workmen, who\nneed not be ashamed. They have not grown strong in experience\nby being called out by opposing influences. They have excused\nthemselves from that exercise which would strengthen the moral\nmuscles, giving spiritual power. But this is the very experience they\nneed in order to attain to the full stature of men in Christ Jesus. They\ngain no spiritual power by shirking duties and responsibilities, and\ngiving up to indolence and selfish love of ease and pleasure.\nBrother R is not lacking in ability to clothe his ideas in words,\nbut he is lacking in spirituality and true heart holiness. He has not\ndrunk deeply himself at the fountain of truth. Had he improved\nhis golden moments in studying the work of God he might now\nhave been an able workman, but he is too indolent to make close\napplication of the mind and to learn for himself the reasons of our\nhope. He is content to take material which other minds and other\npens have labored to produce, and to use their thoughts, which are\nprepared to his hand, without effort or exertion of mind, careful\nthought, or prayerful meditation himself.\nBrother R does not love close application either in the study of\nthe Scriptures or in physical labor. He prefers an easier way, and\nas yet knows nothing experimentally of the burden of the work of\nGod. It is easier for him to repeat the thoughts of others than to\ndiligently search for the truth himself. It is only by personal effort,\nclose application of the mind, and thorough devotion to the work\nthat men become competent for the ministry.\nSays Christ: \u201cYe are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have\nlost his savor, wherewith shall it be salted?\u201d The savor of the salt\nis divine grace. All the efforts made to advance the truth are of but\nlittle value unless the Spirit of God accompanies them. You have\nmade child\u2019s play of teaching the truth. Your mind has been on your [560]\nown ease and pleasure, following your inclination. You and your\nwife have no real sense of the sacredness of the work of God. You\nboth think more of pleasing your fancies and studying to gratify your\ndesires for ease and enjoyment than of engaging in the stern duties\nof life, especially the responsibilities connected with the work of\nwarning the world of the coming judgment.\n526 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nYou have seen Brother S weighed down with burdens and wea-\nried with physical labor; but you have had so great a love for your\nease and such a desire to maintain your own importance that you\nhave held yourself aloof, excusing yourself from engaging in the\nduties which someone was obliged to perform. You have passed\ndays in easy indolence without benefiting anyone, and then your\nconscience could permit you without compunction to bring in time\nmostly spent in indolence and to receive pay from God\u2019s treasury.\nYou have shown by your course that you had not a high sense of\nsacred things. You have robbed God, and you should now seek to\nmake thorough work of repentance. Do not attempt to teach others.\nWhen you are converted, then you may be able to strengthen your\nbrethren; but God has no use for men of your stamp of character in\nHis vineyard. When you get this stamp off, and bear the impress\nof the divine, then you may work for the cause of God. You have\nalmost everything to learn and but a short time in which to learn\nthese lessons. God help you to work earnestly and to the point. I\nhave written much more upon general principles, but cannot find\ntime to give it to you at present.\n* * * * *\nChapter 50\u2014Parents as Reformers\nJanuary 3, 1875, I was shown that none of us realize the perils\nthat attend us at every step. We have a vigilant foe, and yet we are\nnot awake and in earnest in our efforts to resist the temptations of\nSatan and to overcome his devices.\nGod has permitted the light of health reform to shine upon us [561]\nin these last days, that by walking in the light we may escape many\ndangers to which we will be exposed. Satan\u2019s temptations are pow-\nerful upon the human family to lead them to indulge appetite, gratify\ninclination, and live a life of heedless folly. He presents attractions\nin a life of personal enjoyment, and in seeking to gratify the animal\ninstinct. Licentiousness prevails to an alarming extent and is ruining\nconstitutions for life; and not only this, but the moral powers are\nsacrificed. Intemperate indulgences are reducing the vital energies of\nboth body and mind. They place the one that is overcome upon the\nenemy\u2019s ground, where Satan can tempt, annoy, and finally control\nthe will at pleasure.\nThose who have been overcome on the point of appetite and are\nusing tobacco freely are debasing their mental and moral powers and\nbringing them into servitude to the animal. And when the appetite\nfor spirituous liquor is indulged, the man voluntarily places to his\nlips the draft which debases below the level of the brute him who\nwas made in the image of God. Reason is paralyzed, the intellect is\nbenumbed, the animal passions are excited, and then follow crimes\nof the most debasing character. If men would become temperate in\nall things, if they would touch not, taste not, handle not, spirituous\nliquors and narcotics, reason would hold the reigns of government in\nher hands and control the animal appetites and passions. In this fast\nage the less exciting the food the better. Temperance in all things\nand firm denial of appetite is the only path of safety.\nSatan comes to man, as he came to Christ, with his overpow-\nering temptations to indulge appetite. He well knows his power to\novercome man upon this point. He overcame Adam and Eve in Eden\n527\n528 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nupon appetite, and they lost their blissful home. What accumulated\nmisery and crime have filled our world in consequence of the fall of\nAdam. Entire cities have been blotted from the face of the earth be-\ncause of the debasing crimes and revolting iniquity that made them\na blot upon the universe. Indulgence of appetite was the foundation\nof all their sins. Through appetite, Satan controlled the mind and[562]\nbeing. Thousands who might have lived, have prematurely passed\ninto their graves, physical, mental, and moral wrecks. They had\ngood powers, but they sacrificed all to indulgence of appetite, which\nled them to lay the reins upon the neck of lust. Our world is a vast\nhospital. Vicious habits are increasing.\nIt is unpleasant, if not dangerous, to remain in a railroad car\nor in a crowded room that is not thoroughly ventilated, where the\natmosphere is impregnated with the properties of liquor and tobacco.\nThe occupants give evidence by the breath and emanations from the\nbody that the system is filled with the poison of liquor and tobacco.\nTobacco using is a habit which frequently affects the nervous system\nin a more powerful manner than does the use of alcohol. It binds\nthe victim in stronger bands of slavery than does the intoxicating\ncup; the habit is more difficult to overcome. Body and mind are, in\nmany cases, more thoroughly intoxicated with the use of tobacco\nthan with spirituous liquors, for it is a more subtle poison.\nIntemperance is increasing everywhere, notwithstanding the\nearnest efforts made during the past year [This Testimony was first\npublished in 1875.] to stay its progress. I was shown that the giant\npower of intemperance will not be controlled by any such efforts\nas have been made. The work of temperance must begin in our\nfamilies, at our tables. Mothers have an important work to do that\nthey may give to the world, through correct discipline and education,\nchildren who will be capable of filling almost any position, and who\ncan also honor and enjoy the duties of domestic life.\nThe work of the mother is very important and sacred. She should\nteach her children from the cradle to practice habits of self-denial\nand self-control. If her time is mostly occupied with the follies\nof this degenerate age, if dress and parties engage her precious\ntime, her children fail to receive that education which it is essential\nthey should have in order that they may form correct characters.\nThe anxiety of the Christian mother should not be in regard to the[563]\nParents as Reformers 529\nexternal merely, but that her children may have healthy constitutions\nand good morals.\nMany mothers who deplore the intemperance which exists ev-\nerywhere do not look deep enough to see the cause. They are daily\npreparing a variety of dishes and highly seasoned food which tempt\nthe appetite and encourage overeating. The tables of our American\npeople are generally prepared in a manner to make drunkards. Ap-\npetite is the ruling principle with a large class. Whoever will indulge\nappetite in eating too often, and food not of a healthful quality, is\nweakening his power to resist the clamors of appetite and passion in\nother respects in proportion as he has strengthened the propensity\nto incorrect habits of eating. Mothers need to be impressed with\ntheir obligation to God and to the world to furnish society with chil-\ndren having well-developed characters. Men and women who come\nupon the stage of action with firm principles will be fitted to stand\nunsullied amid the moral pollutions of this corrupt age. It is the\nduty of mothers to improve their golden opportunities to correctly\neducate their children for usefulness and duty. Their time belongs\nto their children in a special sense. Precious time should not be\ndevoted to needless work upon garments for display, but should be\nspent in patiently instructing and carefully teaching their children\nthe necessity of self-denial and self-control.\nThe tables of many professed Christian women are daily set with\na variety of dishes which irritate the stomach and produce a feverish\ncondition of the system. Flesh meats constitute the principal article\nof food upon the tables of some families, until their blood is filled\nwith cancerous and scrofulous humors. Their bodies are composed\nof what they eat. But when suffering and disease come upon them,\nit is considered an affliction of Providence.\nWe repeat: Intemperance commences at our tables. The appetite\nis indulged until its indulgence becomes second nature. By the use of\ntea and coffee an appetite is formed for tobacco, and this encourages\nthe appetite for liquors.\nMany parents, to avoid the task of patiently educating their chil- [564]\ndren to habits of self-denial and teaching them how to make a right\nuse of all the blessings of God, indulge them in eating and drink-\ning whenever they please. Appetite and selfish indulgence, unless\npositively restrained, grow with the growth and strengthen with the\n530 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nstrength. When these children commence life for themselves and\ntake their place in society, they are powerless to resist temptation.\nMoral impurity and gross iniquity abound everywhere. The tempta-\ntion to indulge taste and to gratify inclination has not lessened with\nthe increase of years, and youth in general are governed by impulse\nand are slaves to appetite. In the glutton, the tobacco devotee, the\nwinebibber, and the inebriate we see the evil results of defective\neducation.\nWhen we hear the sad lamentations of Christian men and women\nover the terrible evils of intemperance, the questions at once arise in\nthe mind: Who have educated the youth and given them their stamp\nof character? Who have fostered in them the appetites they have\nacquired? Who have neglected the most solemn responsibility of\nmolding their minds and forming their characters for usefulness in\nthis life, and for the society of the heavenly angels in the next? A\nlarge class of the human beings we everywhere meet are a living\ncurse to the world. They live for no other purpose than to indulge\nappetite and passion, and to corrupt soul and body by dissolute\nhabits. This is a terrible rebuke to mothers who are the votaries of\nfashion, who have lived for dress and show, who have neglected\nto beautify their own minds and to form their own characters after\nthe divine Pattern, and who have also neglected the sacred trust\ncommitted to them, to bring their children up in the nurture and\nadmonition of the Lord.\nI saw that Satan, through his temptations, is instituting ever-\nchanging fashions and attractive parties and amusements, that moth-\ners may be led to devote their God-given probationary time to\nfrivolous matters so that they can have but little opportunity to\neducate and properly train their children. Our youth want mothers[565]\nwho will teach them from their very cradles to control passion, to\ndeny appetite, and to overcome selfishness. They need line upon\nline and precept upon precept, here a little and there a little.\nDirection was given to the Hebrews how to train their children to\navoid the idolatry and wickedness of the heathen nations: \u201cTherefore\nshall ye lay up these My words in your heart and in your soul, and\nbind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets\nbetween your eyes. And ye shall teach them your children, speaking\nParents as Reformers 531\nof them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by\nthe way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.\u201d\nWe have an earnest desire that woman shall fill the position\nwhich God originally designed, as her husband\u2019s equal. We so much\nneed mothers who are mothers not merely in name, but in every\nsense that the word implies. We may safely say that the dignity and\nimportance of woman\u2019s mission and distinctive duties are of a more\nsacred and holy character than the duties of man.\nThere are speculations as to woman\u2019s rights and duties in regard\nto voting. Many are in no way disciplined to understand the bearing\nof important questions. They have lived lives of present gratifica-\ntion because it was the fashion. Women who might develop good\nintellects and have true moral worth are now mere slaves to fashion.\nThey have not breadth of thought nor cultivated intellect. They can\ntalk understandingly of the latest fashion, the styles of dress, this\nor that party or delightful ball. Such women are not prepared to\nintelligently take a prominent position in political matters. They\nare mere creatures of fashion and circumstance. Let this order of\nthings be changed. Let woman realize the sacredness of her work\nand, in the strength and fear of God, take up her life mission. Let\nher educate her children for usefulness in this world and for a fitness\nfor the better world.\nWe address Christian mothers. We entreat that you feel your\nresponsibility as mothers and that you live not to please yourselves, [566]\nbut to glorify God. Christ pleased not Himself, but took upon Him\nthe form of a servant. He left the royal courts and condescended to\nclothe His divinity with humanity, that by His condescension and\nHis example of self-sacrifice He might teach us how we may become\nelevated to the position of sons and daughters of the royal family,\nchildren of the heavenly King. But what are the conditions of these\nsacred, elevated blessings? \u201cCome out from among them, and be ye\nseparate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will\nreceive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons\nand daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\u201d\nChrist humbled Himself from the highest authority, from the\nposition of one equal with God, to the lowest place, that of a servant.\nHis home was in Nazareth, which was proverbial for its wickedness.\nHis parents were among the lowly poor. His trade was that of a\n532 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\ncarpenter, and He labored with His hands to do His part in sustaining\nthe family. For thirty years He was subject to His parents. Here\nthe life of Christ points us to our duty to be diligent in labor and to\nprovide for and to train the weak and the ignorant. In His lessons\nof instruction to His disciples Jesus taught them that His kingdom\nwas not a worldly kingdom, where all were striving for the highest\nposition.\nWoman is to fill a more sacred and elevated position in the family\nthan the king upon his throne. Her great work is to make her life\na living example which she would wish her children to copy. By\nprecept as well as example she is to store their minds with useful\nknowledge and lead them to self-sacrificing labor for the good of\nothers. The great stimulus to the toiling, burdened mother should\nbe that every child who is trained aright, and who has the inward\nadorning, the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, will have a fitness\nfor heaven and will shine in the courts of the Lord.\nHow few see anything attractive in the true humility of Christ!\nHis humility did not consist in a low estimate of His own character\nand qualifications, but in His humbling Himself to fallen humanity[567]\nin order to raise them up with Him to a higher life. Worldlings try to\nexalt themselves to the position of those above them or to become\nsuperior to them. But Jesus, the Son of God, humbled Himself to\nelevate man; and the true follower of Christ will seek to meet men\nwhere they are in order to elevate them.\nWill mothers of this generation feel the sacredness of their mis-\nsion and not try to vie with their wealthy neighbors in appearances,\nbut seek to excel them in faithfully performing the work of instruct-\ning their children for the better life? If children and youth were\ntrained and educated to habits of self-denial and self-control, if they\nwere taught that they eat to live instead of living to eat, there would\nbe less disease and less moral corruption. There would be little\nnecessity for temperance crusades, which amount to so little, if in\nthe youth who form and fashion society, right principles in regard to\ntemperance could be implanted. They would then have moral worth\nand moral integrity to resist, in the strength of Jesus, the pollutions\nof these last days.\nIt is a most difficult matter to unlearn the habits which have been\nindulged through life and have educated the appetite. The demon of\nParents as Reformers 533\nintemperance is not easily conquered. It is of giant strength and hard\nto overcome. But let parents begin a crusade against intemperance\nat their own firesides, in their own families, in the principles they\nteach their children to follow from their very infancy, and they may\nhope for success. It will pay you, mothers, to use the precious hours\nwhich are given you of God in forming, developing, and training the\ncharacters of your children, and in teaching them to strictly adhere\nto the principles of temperance in eating and drinking.\nParents may have transmitted to their children tendencies to\nappetite and passion, which will make more difficult the work of\neducating and training these children to be strictly temperate and\nto have pure and virtuous habits. If the appetite for unhealthy food\nand for stimulants and narcotics has been transmitted to them as\na legacy from their parents, what a fearfully solemn responsibility [568]\nrests upon the parents to counteract the evil tendencies which they\nhave given to their children! How earnestly and diligently should the\nparents work to do their duty, in faith and hope, to their unfortunate\noffspring!\nParents should make it their first business to understand the\nlaws of life and health, that nothing shall be done by them in the\npreparation of food, or through any other habits, which will develop\nwrong tendencies in their children. How carefully should mothers\nstudy to prepare their tables with the most simple, healthful food,\nthat the digestive organs may not be weakened, the nervous forces\nunbalanced, and the instruction which they should give their children\ncounteracted by the food placed before them. This food either\nweakens or strengthens the organs of the stomach and has much to do\nin controlling the physical and moral health of the children, who are\nGod\u2019s blood-bought property. What a sacred trust is committed to\nparents to guard the physical and moral constitutions of their children\nso that the nervous system may be well balanced and the soul not be\nendangered! Those who indulge the appetite of their children, and\ndo not control their passions, will see the terrible mistake they have\nmade, in the tobacco-loving, liquor-drinking slave, whose senses are\nbenumbed and whose lips utter falsehoods and profanity.\nWhen parents and children meet at the final reckoning, what\na scene will be presented! Thousands of children who have been\nslaves to appetite and debasing vice, whose lives are moral wrecks,\n534 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nwill stand face to face with the parents who made them what they\nare. Who but the parents must bear this fearful responsibility? Did\nthe Lord make these youth corrupt? Oh, no! He made them in His\nimage, a little lower than the angels. Who, then, has done the fearful\nwork of forming the life character? Who changed their characters\nso that they do not bear the impress of God, and must be forever\nseparated from His presence as too impure to have any place with\nthe pure angels in a holy heaven? Were the sins of the parents\ntransmitted to the children in perverted appetites and passions? And[569]\nwas the work completed by the pleasure-loving mother in neglecting\nto properly train them according to the pattern given her? All these\nmothers will pass in review before God just as surely as they exist.\nSatan is ready to do his work and to present temptations which they\nhave no will or moral power to resist.\nOur people are constantly retrograding upon health reform. Satan\nsees that he cannot have such a controlling power over them as he\ncould if appetite were indulged. Under the influence of unhealthful\nfood the conscience becomes stupefied, the mind becomes darkened,\nand its susceptibility to impressions is blunted. But because violated\nconscience is benumbed and becomes insensible, the guilt of the\ntransgressor is not lessened.\nSatan is corrupting minds and destroying souls through his sub-\ntle temptations. Will our people see and feel the sin of indulging\nperverted appetite? Will they discard tea, coffee, flesh meats, and\nall stimulating food, and devote the means expended for these hurt-\nful indulgences to spreading the truth? These stimulants do only\nharm, and yet we see that a large number of those who profess to be\nChristians are using tobacco. These very men will deplore the evil\nof intemperance, and while speaking against the use of liquors will\neject the juice of tobacco. While a healthy state of mind depends\nupon the normal condition of the vital forces, what care should be\nexercised that neither stimulants nor narcotics be used.\nTobacco is a slow, insidious poison, and its effects are more\ndifficult to cleanse from the system than those of liquor. What power\ncan the tobacco devotee have to stay the progress of intemperance?\nThere must be a revolution in our world upon the subject of tobacco\nbefore the ax is laid at the root of the tree. We press the subject still\ncloser. Tea and coffee are fostering the appetite which is develop-\nParents as Reformers 535\ning for stronger stimulants, as tobacco and liquor. And we come\nstill closer home, to the daily meals, the tables spread in Christian\nhouseholds. Is temperance practiced in all things? Are the reforms\nwhich are essential to health and happiness carried out there? Every\ntrue Christian will have control of his appetite and passions. Unless [570]\nhe is free from the bondage and slavery of appetite he cannot be a\ntrue, obedient servant of Christ. It is the indulgence of appetite and\npassion which makes the truth of none effect upon the heart. It is\nimpossible for the spirit and power of the truth to sanctify a man,\nsoul, body, and spirit, when he is controlled by appetite and passion.\n* * * * *\nChapter 51\u2014\u201cCannot Come Down\u201d\n\u201cI am doing a great work,\u201d says Nehemiah, \u201cso that I cannot\ncome down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come\ndown to you?\u201d\nI was shown, January 3, 1875, [It is a pleasure here to state\nrelative to the gracious manifestation of the Holy Spirit to Mrs.\nWhite on the eve of January 3, 1875, that she had been sick with\nsevere influenza, and confined to her room and bed for one week, till\nthe physicians at the Health Institute had become anxious in her case.\nIn this condition she followed the directions given in the fifth chapter\nof the Epistle of James, and after a great stretch of faith, like the man\nin the gospel who stretched forth his withered hand, she reached the\npoint of deliverance from pain and sickness, and was soon in vision,\nwhich lasted ten minutes. She then dressed for meeting, walked to\nthe church, and spoke to the crowded assembly twenty minutes, and\nwalked home. Since that time she has written very much, and has\nspoken to the people with freedom. She is now preparing for the\nlong journey to the Pacific Coast. J. W., in first edition] that God\u2019s\npeople should not for one moment relax their watchfulness or their\nvigilance. Satan is upon our track. He is determined to overcome\nGod\u2019s commandment-keeping people with his temptations. If we\ngive no place to him, but resist his devices, steadfast in the faith,\nwe shall have strength to depart from all iniquity. Those who keep\nthe commandments of God will be a power in the land if they live\nup to their light and privileges. They may be patterns of piety, holy\nin heart and in conversation. We shall not have ease, that we may\ncease watchfulness and prayer. As the time draws near for Christ\nto be revealed in the clouds of heaven, Satan\u2019s temptations will[571]\nbe brought to bear with greater power upon those who keep God\u2019s\ncommandments, for he knows that his time is short.\nThe work of Satan will be carried on through agents. Ministers\nwho hate the law of God will employ any means to lead souls from\ntheir loyalty to God. Our bitterest foes will be among the first-day\n536\n\u201cCannot Come Down\u201d 537\nAdventists. Their hearts are fully determined to make war against\nthose who keep the commandments of God and have the faith of\nJesus. This class feel that it is a virtue to talk, write, and act out the\nmost bitter hatred against us. We need not look for fair dealing or\nfor justice at their hands. Many of them are inspired by Satan with\ninsane madness against those who are keeping the commandments\nof God. We shall be maligned and misrepresented; all our motives\nand actions will be misjudged, and our characters will be attacked.\nThe wrath of the dragon will be manifested in this manner. But I\nsaw that we should not be in the least discouraged. Our strength\nis in Jesus, our Advocate. If in humility we trust in God and hold\nfast to His promises, He will give us grace and heavenly wisdom to\nwithstand all the wiles of Satan and to come off victors.\nIn my recent view I saw that it will not increase our influence,\nor bring us into favor with God, to retaliate or come down from\nour great work to their level in meeting their slanders. There are\nthose who will resort to any species of deception and gross false-\nhood to gain their object and deceive souls, and to cast stigma upon\nthe law of God and those who love to obey it. They will repeat\nthe most inconsistent and vile falsehoods, over and over, until they\nmake themselves believe that they are truth. These are the strongest\narguments they have to use against the Sabbath of the fourth com-\nmandment. We should not allow our feelings to control us and divert\nus from the work of warning the world.\nThe case of Nehemiah was presented before me. He was en-\ngaged in building the walls of Jerusalem, and the enemies of God\nwere determined that the walls should not be built. \u201cBut it came to\npass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the [572]\nAmmonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem\nwere made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they\nwere very wroth, and conspired all of them together to come and to\nfight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.\u201d\nIn this case a spirit of hatred and opposition to the Hebrews\nformed the bond of union and created a mutual sympathy among\ndifferent bodies of men who might otherwise have warred with\none another. This well illustrates what we frequently witness in\nour day in the existing union of men of different denominations to\noppose present truth, men whose only bond seems to be that which\n538 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nis dragonic in its nature, manifesting bitterness and hatred against\nthe remnant who keep the commandments of God. This is especially\nseen in the first-day, no-day, and all-days-alike Adventists, who\nseem to be famous for hating and slandering one another, when they\ncan spare time from their efforts to misrepresent, slander, and in\nevery way abuse Seventh-day Adventists.\n\u201cNevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch\nagainst them day and night, because of them.\u201d We are in constant\ndanger of becoming self-sufficient, relying upon our own wisdom,\nand not making God our strength. Nothing disturbs Satan so much\nas our knowledge of his devices. If we feel our dangers we shall feel\nthe need of prayer, as did Nehemiah, and like him we shall obtain\nthat sure defense that will give us security in peril. If we are careless\nand indifferent, we shall surely be overcome by Satan\u2019s devices.\nWe must be vigilant. While, like Nehemiah, we resort to prayer,\ntaking all our perplexities and burdens to God, we should not feel\nthat we have nothing to do. We are to watch as well as pray. We\nshould watch the work of our adversaries, lest they gain advantage\nin deceiving souls. We should, in the wisdom of Christ, make efforts\nto defeat their purposes, while, at the same time, we do not suffer\nthem to call us from our great work. Truth is stronger than error.\nRighteousness will prevail over wrong.\nThe Lord\u2019s people are seeking to heal the breach which has been[573]\nmade in the law of God. \u201cAnd they that shall be of thee shall build\nthe old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many\ngenerations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach,\nThe restorer of paths to dwell in. If thou turn away thy foot from\nthe Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the\nSabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor\nHim, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure,\nnor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the\nLord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth,\nand feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of\nthe Lord hath spoken it.\u201d\nThis disturbs the enemies of our faith, and every means is em-\nployed to hinder us in our work. And yet the broken-down wall is\ngoing steadily up. The world is being warned, and many are turning\naway from trampling under their feet the Sabbath of Jehovah. God\n\u201cCannot Come Down\u201d 539\nis in this work, and man cannot stop it. Angels of God are work-\ning with the efforts of His faithful servants, and the work steadily\nadvances. We shall meet with opposition of every description, as\ndid the builders of the walls of Jerusalem; but if we watch and pray\nand work, as they did, God will fight our battles for us and give us\nprecious victories.\nNehemiah \u201cclave to the Lord, and departed not from following\nHim, but kept His commandments, which the Lord commanded\nMoses. And the Lord was with him.\u201d Messengers were sent repeat-\nedly, soliciting a conference with Nehemiah; but he refused to meet\nthem. Bold threats were made of what they proposed to do, and\nmessengers were sent to harangue the people engaged in the work of\nbuilding. These presented flattering inducements and promised the\nbuilders freedom from restraint, and wonderful privileges, if they\nwould unite their interest with them and cease their work of building.\nBut the people were commanded not to engage in controversy\nwith their enemies and to answer them not a word, that no advantage [574]\nof words might be given them. Threatenings and ridicule were\nresorted to. They said: \u201cEven that which they build, if a fox go up,\nhe shall even break down their stone wall.\u201d Sanballat \u201cwas wroth,\nand took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.\u201d Nehemiah prayed:\n\u201cHear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon\ntheir own head.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great\nwork, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease,\nwhilst I leave it, and come down to you? Yet they sent unto me four\ntimes after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.\nThen sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time\nwith an open letter in his hand.\u201d\nWe shall receive the most fierce opposition from the Adventists\nwho oppose the law of God. But, like the builders of the walls of\nJerusalem, we should not be diverted and hindered from our work\nby reports, by messengers desiring discussion or controversy, or\nby intimidating threats, the publication of falsehoods, or any of\nthe devices that Satan may instigate. Our answer should be: We\nare engaged in a great work, and we cannot come down. We shall\nsometimes be perplexed to know what course we should pursue to\npreserve the honor of the cause of God and to vindicate His truth.\n540 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3\nThe course of Nehemiah should have a strong bearing upon our\nminds as to the manner of meeting this kind of opponents. We should\ntake all these things to the Lord in prayer, as Nehemiah made his\nsupplication to God, while his own spirit was humbled. He clung\nto God with unwavering faith. This is the course that we should\npursue. Time is too precious to be devoted by the servants of God to\nvindicating their character, blackened by those who hate the Sabbath\nof the Lord. We should move forward with unwavering confidence,\nbelieving that God will give His truth great and precious victories.\nIn humility, meekness, and purity of life, relying upon Jesus, we\nshould carry a convincing power with us that we have the truth.\nWe do not understand, as is our privilege, the faith and confidence[575]\nthat we may have in God, and the great blessings which faith will\ngive us. An important work is before us. We are to obtain a moral\nfitness for heaven. Our words and our example are to tell upon the\nworld. Angels of God are actively engaged in ministering to the\nchildren of God. Precious promises are upon record on condition of\nour obedience to God\u2019s requirements. Heaven is full of the richest\nof blessings, all waiting to be communicated to us. If we feel our\nneed, and come to God in sincerity and in earnest faith, we shall be\nbrought into close connection with heaven and shall be channels of\nlight to the world.\nThe warning needs to be often sounded: \u201cBe sober, be vigilant;\nbecause your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about,\nseeking whom he may devour.\u201d",
