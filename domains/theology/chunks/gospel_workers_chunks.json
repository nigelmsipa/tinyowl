The \ufb01rst edition, issued in 1892, found a place in\nnearly every Seventh-day Adventist home. It has become a highly prized\nhandbook of counsel and instruction to ministers and to all other missionary\nworkers connected with this movement.\nSince the publication of the \ufb01rst edition the ever-active pen of the author\nhas produced much of vital interest to this people. The work on this book\nwas completed after the author had closed her active life work as a writer and\nspeaker. It represents, therefore, a compilation from her complete writings.\nIt is the ripened fruit of the life of one whom God has greatly blessed as His\n\u201cmessenger,\u201d to the glory of His name and the upbuilding of this movement\nfrom its beginning. The value and importance of this book will therefore be\nappreciated.\nIt is our earnest prayer that the Holy Spirit who indited these messages of\ncounsel may be present to impress the instruction upon the hearts of all who\nread it.\nThe Publishers.\nContents\nInformation about this Book . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nOverview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nAbout the Author . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nFurther Links . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nEnd User License Agreement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nPreface . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\nSection I.

Called With a\nHoly Calling\nIn Christ\u2019s Stead\nIn every period of this earth\u2019s history, God has had His men of\nopportunity, to whom He has said, \u201cYe are My witnesses.\u201d In every age\nthere have been devout men, who gathered up the rays of light as they \ufb02ashed\nupon their pathway, and who spoke to the people the words of God. Enoch,\nNoah, Moses, Daniel, and the long roll of patriarchs and prophets,\u2014these\nwere ministers of righteousness. They were not infallible; they were weak,\nerring men; but the Lord wrought through them as they gave themselves to\nHis service.\nSince His ascension, Christ the great Head of the church, has carried\nforward His work in the world by chosen ambassadors, through whom He\nspeaks to the children of men, and ministers to their needs. The position\nof those who have been called of God to labor in word and doctrine for the\nupbuilding of His church, is one of grave responsibility. In Christ\u2019s stead they\nare to beseech men and women to be reconciled to God; and they can ful\ufb01l\ntheir mission only as they receive wisdom and power from above.\nGod\u2019s ministers are symbolized by the seven stars, which He who is\nthe \ufb01rst and the last has under His special care and protection. The sweet\nin\ufb02uences that\n13\nare to be abundant in the church are bound up with these ministers of God,\nwho are to represent the love of Christ. The stars of heaven are under God\u2019s\ncontrol. He \ufb01lls them with light. He guides and directs their movements. If\nHe did not, they would become fallen stars. So with His ministers. They\nare but instruments in His hands, and all the good they accomplish is done\nthrough His power.\nIt is to the honor of Christ that He makes His ministers a greater blessing\nto the church, through the working of the Holy Spirit, than are the stars to\nthe world. The Saviour is to be their ef\ufb01ciency. If they will look to Him as\nHe looked to His Father, they will do His works. As they make God their\ndependence, He will give them His brightness to re\ufb02ect to the world.\nSpiritual Watchmen\nChrist\u2019s ministers are the spiritual guardians of the people entrusted to\ntheir care. Their work has been likened to that of watchmen. In ancient\ntimes, sentinels were often stationed on the walls of cities, where, from points\nof vantage, they could overlook important points to be guarded, and give\nwarning of the approach of an enemy. Upon their faithfulness depended the\nsafety of all within. At stated intervals they were required to call to one\nanother, to make sure that all were awake, and that no harm had befallen any.\nThe cry of good cheer or of warning was borne from one to another, each\nrepeating the call till it echoed round the city.\nTo every minister the Lord declares: \u201cO son of man, I have set thee a\nwatchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at My\nmouth, and warn them from Me. When I say unto the wicked, O\n14\nwicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked\nfrom his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I\nrequire at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn\nfrom it, ...thou hast delivered thy soul.\u201d [Ezekiel 33:7-9.]\nThese words of the prophet declare the solemn responsibility resting upon\nthose who are appointed as guardians of the church, stewards of the mysteries\nof God. They are to stand as watchmen on the walls of Zion, to sound the note\nof alarm at the approach of the enemy. If for any reason their spiritual senses\nbecome so benumbed that they are unable to discern danger, and through their\nfailure to give warning the people perish, God will require at their hands the\nblood of those who are lost.\nIt is the privilege of the watchmen on the walls of Zion to live so near to\nGod, and to be so susceptible to the impressions of His Spirit, that He can\nwork through them to tell sinners of their peril, and point them to the place\nof safety. Chosen of God, sealed with the blood of consecration, they are to\nrescue men and women from impending destruction. Faithfully are they to\nwarn their fellow-men of the sure result of transgression, and faithfully are\nthey to safeguard the interest of the church. At no time may they relax their\nvigilance. Theirs is a work requiring the exercise of every faculty of the being.\nIn trumpet tones their voices are to be lifted, and never should they sound one\nwavering, uncertain note. Not for wages are they to labor, but because they\ncannot do otherwise, because they realize that there is a woe upon them if\nthey fail to preach the gospel.\n15\nFaithfulness in Service\nThe minister who is a co-worker with Christ will have a deep sense of\nthe sacredness of his work, and of the toil and sacri\ufb01ce required to perform it\nsuccessfully. He does not study his own ease or convenience. He is forgetful\nof self. In his search for the lost sheep, he does not realize that he himself is\nweary, cold, and hungry. He has but one object in view,\u2014the saving of the\nlost.\nHe who serves under the blood-stained banner of Emmanuel often has\nthat to do which calls for heroic effort and patient endurance. But the soldier\nof the cross stands unshrinkingly in the forefront of the battle. As the enemy\npresses the attack against him, he turns to the Stronghold for aid; and as he\nbrings to the Lord the promises of the Word, he is strengthened for the duties\nof the hour. He realizes his need of strength from above. The victories that\nhe gains do not lead to self-exaltation, but cause him to lean more and more\nheavily on the Mighty One. Relying upon that power, he is enabled to present\nthe message of salvation so forcibly that it awakens an answering chord in\nother minds.\nThe Lord sends His ministers to hold forth the word of life, to preach, not\n\u201cphilosophy and vain deceit,\u201d nor \u201cscience falsely so called,\u201d but the gospel,\n\u201cthe power of God unto salvation.\u201d [Colossians 2:8; 1 Timothy 6:20; Romans\n1:16.] \u201cI charge thee therefore,\u201d Paul wrote to Timothy, \u201cbefore God, and the\nLord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing\nand His kingdom: Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season;\nreprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine. For the time\nwill come when they will not endure\n16\nsound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves\nteachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the\ntruth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure\naf\ufb02ictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.\u201d [2\nTimothy 4:1-5.] In this charge every minister has his work outlined,\u2014a work\nthat he can do only through the ful\ufb01lment of the promise that Jesus gave to\nHis disciples, \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end.\u201d [Matthew 28:20.]\nMinisters of the gospel, God\u2019s messengers to their fellow-men, should\nnever lose sight of their mission and their responsibilities. If they lose their\nconnection with heaven, they are in greater danger than others, and can exert\na stronger in\ufb02uence for wrong. Satan watches them continually, waiting for\nsome weakness to develop, through which he may make a successful attack\nupon them. And how he triumphs when he succeeds! for an ambassador\nfor Christ, off his guard, allows the great adversary to secure many souls to\nhimself.\nThe true minister will do nothing that would belittle his sacred of\ufb01ce. He\nwill be circumspect in deportment, and wise in his course of action. He will\nwork as Christ worked; he will do as Christ did. He will use all his powers\nin carrying the tidings of salvation to those who know it not. A deep hunger\nfor the righteousness of Christ will \ufb01ll his heart. Feeling his need, he will\nseek earnestly for the power that must come to him before he can present in\nsimplicity, truthfulness, and humility the truth as it is in Jesus.\n17\nExamples of Human Steadfastness\nGod\u2019s servants receive no honor or recognition from the world. Stephen\nwas stoned because he preached Christ and Him cruci\ufb01ed. Paul was\nimprisoned, beaten, stoned, and \ufb01nally put to death, because he was a faithful\nmessenger of God to the Gentiles. The apostle John was banished to the\nIsle of Patmos, \u201cfor the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.\u201d\n[Revelation 1:9.] These examples of human steadfastness in the might of\ndivine power, are a witness to the world of the faithfulness of God\u2019s promises,\nof His abiding presence and sustaining grace.\nNo hope of glorious immortality lights up the future of the enemies\nof God. The great military commander conquers nations, and shakes the\narmies of half the world; but he dies of disappointment, and in exile. The\nphilosopher who ranges in thought through the universe, everywhere tracing\nthe manifestations of God\u2019s power and delighting in their harmony, often fails\nto behold in these marvelous wonders the Hand that formed them all. \u201cMan\nthat is in honor, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.\u201d [Psalm\n49:20.] But God\u2019s heroes of faith are heirs to an inheritance of greater value\nthan any earthly riches,\u2014an inheritance that will satisfy the longings of the\nsoul. By the world they may be unknown and unacknowledged, but in the\nrecord books above they are enrolled as citizens of heaven, and an exalted\ngreatness, an eternal weight of glory, will be theirs.\nThe greatest work, the noblest effort, in which men can engage, is to point\nsinners to the Lamb of God. True ministers are co-laborers with the Lord in\nthe accomplishment of His purposes. God says to them, Go,\n18\nteach and preach Christ. Instruct and educate all who know not of His grace,\nHis goodness, and His mercy. Teach the people. \u201cHow then shall they call\non Him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in Him\nof whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?\u201d\n[Romans 10:14.]\n\u201cHow beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth\ngood tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that\npublisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!\u201d \u201cBreak forth\ninto joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the Lord hath\ncomforted His people, He hath redeemed Jerusalem. The Lord hath made\nbare His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth\nshall see the salvation of our God.\u201d [Isaiah 52:7, 9, 10.] *****\nWorkers for Christ are never to think, much less to speak, of failure in\ntheir work. The Lord Jesus is our ef\ufb01ciency in all things; His Spirit is to be\nour inspiration; and as we place ourselves in His hands, to be channels of\nlight, our means of doing good will never be exhausted. We may draw upon\nHis fulness, and receive of that grace which has no limit.\n19\nThe Sacredness of the Work\nThe minister stands as God\u2019s mouthpiece to the people, and in thought,\nin word, in act, he is to represent his Lord. When Moses was chosen as the\nmessenger of the covenant, the word given him was, \u201cBe thou for the people\nto Godward.\u201d [Exodus 18:19.] Today God chooses men as He chose Moses,\nto be His messengers, and heavy is the woe resting on the one who dishonors\nhis holy calling, or lowers the standard set for him in the life and labors of the\nSon of God.\nThe punishment that fell upon Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron,\nshows how God regards those ministers who do that which dishonors their\nsacred of\ufb01ce. These men were consecrated to the priesthood, but they had not\nlearned to control themselves. Habits of self-indulgence, long cherished, had\nobtained a hold upon them which even the responsibility of their of\ufb01ce had\nnot power to break.\nAt the hour of worship, as the prayers and praise of the people were\nascending to God, Nadab and Abihu, partially intoxicated, took each his\ncenser, and burned fragrant incense thereon. But they transgressed God\u2019s\ncommand by using \u201cstrange \ufb01re,\u201d instead of the sacred \ufb01re which God himself\nhad kindled, and which He had commanded should be used for this purpose.\nFor this sin, a \ufb01re went out from the Lord, and devoured them in the sight\nof the people. \u201cThen Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake,\nsaying, I will be sancti\ufb01ed in them that come nigh Me, and before all the\npeople I will be glori\ufb01ed.\u201d [See Leviticus 10:1-7.]\n20\nIsaiah\u2019s Commission\nWhen God was about to send Isaiah with a message to His people, He\n\ufb01rst permitted the prophet to look in vision into the holy of holies within the\nsanctuary. Suddenly the gate and the inner veil of the temple seemed to be\nuplifted or withdrawn, and he was permitted to gaze within, upon the holy of\nholies, where even the prophet\u2019s feet might not enter. There rose before him\na vision of Jehovah sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, while the train\nof His glory \ufb01lled the temple. Around the throne were seraphim, as guards\nabout the great King, and they re\ufb02ected the glory that surrounded them. As\ntheir songs of praise resounded in deep notes of adoration, the pillars of the\ngate trembled, as if shaken by an earthquake. With lips unpolluted by sin,\nthese angels poured forth the praises of God. \u201cHoly, holy, holy, is the Lord of\nhosts,\u201d they cried; \u201cthe whole earth is full of His glory.\u201d [See Isaiah 6:1-8.]\nThe seraphim around the throne are so \ufb01lled with reverential awe as they\nbehold the glory of God, that they do not for an instant look upon themselves\nwith admiration. Their praise is for the Lord of hosts. As they look into the\nfuture, when the whole earth shall be \ufb01lled with His glory, the triumphant\nsong is echoed from one to another in melodious chant, \u201cHoly, holy, holy,\nis the Lord of hosts.\u201d They are fully satis\ufb01ed to glorify God; abiding in His\npresence, beneath His smile of approbation, they wish for nothing more. In\nbearing His image, in doing His bidding, in worshiping Him, their highest\nambition is reached.\nAs the prophet listened, the glory, the power, and the majesty of the Lord\nwas opened to his vision; and\n21\nin the light of this revelation his own inward de\ufb01lement appeared with\nstartling clearness. His very words seemed vile to him. In deep humiliation\nhe cried, \u201cWoe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips:\n...for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.\u201d\nIsaiah\u2019s humiliation was genuine. As the contrast between humanity and\nthe divine character was made plain to him, he felt altogether inef\ufb01cient\nand unworthy. How could he speak to the people the holy requirements of\nJehovah?\n\u201cThen \ufb02ew one of the seraphim unto me,\u201d he writes, \u201chaving a live coal\nin his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: and he laid\nit upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity\nis taken away, and thy sin purged.\u201d\nThen Isaiah heard the voice of the Lord, saying, \u201cWhom shall I send, and\nwho will go for us?\u201d and strengthened by the thought of the divine touch, he\nanswered, \u201cHere am I; send me.\u201d\nAs God\u2019s ministers look by faith into the holy of holies, and see the work\nof our great High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, they realize that they are\nmen of unclean lips, men whose tongues have often spoken vanity. Well may\nthey despair as they contrast their own unworthiness with the perfection of\nChrist. With contrition of heart, feeling wholly unworthy and un\ufb01t for their\ngreat work, they cry,\u201cI am undone.\u201d But if, like Isaiah, they humble their\nhearts before God, the work done for the prophet will be performed for them.\nTheir lips will be touched with a live coal from off the altar, and they will lose\nsight of self in a sense of\n22\nthe greatness and power of God and His readiness to help them. They will\nrealize the sacredness of the work entrusted to them, and will be led to abhor\neverything that would cause them to dishonor Him who has sent them forth\nwith His message.\nThe live coal is symbolical of puri\ufb01cation, and it also represents the\npotency of the efforts of God\u2019s true servants. To those who make so full a\nconsecration that the Lord can place His touch upon their lips, the word is\nspoken, Go forth into the harvest-\ufb01eld. I will co-operate with you.\nThe minister who has received this preparation will be a power for good\nin the world. His words will be right words, pure and true, fraught with\nsympathy and love; his actions will be right actions, a help and a blessing\nto the weak. Christ will be to him an abiding presence, controlling thought,\nword, and deed. He has pledged himself to overcome pride, covetousness,\nsel\ufb01shness. As he seeks to ful\ufb01l this pledge, he gains spiritual strength.\nBy daily communion with God he becomes mighty in a knowledge of the\nScriptures. His fellowship is with the Father and the Son; and as he constantly\nobeys the divine will, he becomes daily better \ufb01tted to speak words that will\nguide wandering souls to the fold of Christ.\n23\nThe Field is the World\n\u201cJesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called\nPeter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were \ufb01shers.\nAnd He saith unto them, Follow Me, and I will make you \ufb01shers of men. And\nthey straightway left their nets, and followed Him. And going on from thence,\nHe saw two other brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in\na ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them. And\nthey immediately left the ship and their father, and followed Him.\u201d [Matthew\n4:18-22.]\nThe prompt, unquestioning obedience of these men, with no promise\nof wages, seems remarkable; but the words of Christ were an invitation\nthat carried with it an impelling power. Christ would make these humble\n\ufb01shermen, in connection with Himself, the means of taking men out of the\nservice of Satan, and placing them in the service of God. In this work they\nwould become his witnesses, bearing to the world His truth unmingled with\nthe traditions and sophistries of men. By practicing His virtues, by walking\nand working with Him, they were to be quali\ufb01ed to be \ufb01shers of men.\nThus were the \ufb01rst disciples appointed to the work of the gospel ministry.\nFor three years they labored in connection with the Saviour, and by His\nteaching, His works of healing, His example, they were prepared to carry on\nthe work that He began. By the simplicity of faith, by pure, humble service,\nthe disciples were taught to carry responsibilities in God\u2019s cause.\n24\nThere are lessons for us to learn from the experience of the apostles.\nThese men were as true as steel to principle. They were men who would not\nfail nor be discouraged. They were full of reverence and zeal for God, full\nof noble purposes and aspirations. They were by nature as weak and helpless\nas any of those now engaged in the work, but they put their whole trust in\nthe Lord. Wealth they had, but it consisted of mind and soul culture; and this\nevery one may have who will make God \ufb01rst and last and best in everything.\nThey toiled long to learn the lessons given them in the school of Christ, and\nthey did not toil in vain. They bound themselves up with the mightiest of all\npowers, and were ever longing for a deeper, higher, broader comprehension\nof eternal realities, that they might successfully present the treasures of truth\nto a needy world.\nWorkers of this character are needed now, men who will consecrate\nthemselves without reserve to the work of representing the kingdom of God\nto a world lying in wickedness. The world needs men of thought, men of\nprinciple, men who are constantly growing in understanding and discernment.\nThere is great need of men who can use the press to the best advantage, that\nthe truth may be given wings to speed it to every nation, and tongue, and\npeople.\nThe Gospel to all Countries\nEverywhere the light of truth is to shine forth, that hearts may be\nawakened and converted. In all countries the gospel is to be proclaimed.\nGod\u2019s servants are to labor in places nigh and afar off, enlarging the cultivated\nportions of the vineyard, and going to the\n25\nregions beyond. They are to work while the day lasts; for the night cometh, in\nwhich no man can work. Sinners are to be pointed to a Saviour uplifted on the\ncross, and from many voices is to be heard the invitation, \u201cBehold the Lamb\nof God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d [John 1:29.] Churches are to\nbe organized, and plans laid for work to be done by the members of the newly\norganized churches. As workers go forth \ufb01lled with zeal, and with the love\nof God, the churches at home will be revived; for the success of the workers\nwill be regarded as a subject of deep personal concern by every member of\nthe church.\nEarnest, self-sacri\ufb01cing men and women are needed, who will go to God\nand with strong crying and tears plead for the souls that are on the brink of\nruin. There can be no harvest without seed-sowing, no result without effort.\nAbraham was called to go forth from his home, a light-bearer to the heathen.\nAnd without questioning, he obeyed. \u201cHe went out, not knowing whither he\nwent.\u201d [Hebrews 11:8.] So today God\u2019s servants are to go where He calls,\ntrusting Him to guide them and to give them success in their work.\nThe terrible condition of the world would seem to indicate that the death\nof Christ has been almost in vain, and that Satan has triumphed. The great\nmajority of this earth\u2019s inhabitants have given their allegiance to the enemy.\nBut we have not been deceived. Notwithstanding the apparent triumph of\nSatan, Christ is carrying forward His work in the heavenly sanctuary and\non the earth. The word of God portrays the wickedness and corruption that\nwould exist in the last days. As we see the ful\ufb01lment of prophecy, our faith\nin the \ufb01nal triumph of Christ\u2019s kingdom should\n26\nstrengthen; and we should go forth with renewed courage to do our appointed\nwork.\nThe solemn, sacred message of warning must be proclaimed in the most\ndif\ufb01cult \ufb01elds and in the most sinful cities, in every place where the light of\nthe great threefold gospel message has not yet dawned. Everyone is to hear\nthe last call to the marriage supper of the Lamb. From town to town, from\ncity to city, from country to country, the message of present truth is to be\nproclaimed, not with outward display, but in the power of the Spirit. As the\ndivine principles that our Saviour came to this world to set forth in word and\nlife, are presented in the simplicity of the gospel, the power of the message\nwill make itself felt. In this age, a new life, coming from the Source of all\nlife, is to take possession of every laborer. O, how little do we comprehend\nthe breadth of our mission! We need a faith that is earnest and determined,\nand a courage that is unshaken. Our time for work is short, and we are to\nlabor with un\ufb02agging zeal.\n\u201cThe \ufb01eld is the world.\u201d [Matthew 13:38.] We understand better what\nthis saying comprehends than did the apostles who received the commission\nto preach the gospel. The whole world is a vast missionary \ufb01eld, and we\nwho have long known the gospel message should be encouraged by the\nthought that \ufb01elds which were once dif\ufb01cult of access are now easily entered.\nCountries hitherto closed to the gospel are opening their doors, and are\npleading for the word of God to be explained to them. Kings and princes are\nopening their long-closed gates, inviting the heralds of the cross to enter. The\nharvest truly is great. Eternity alone will reveal the results of well-directed\nefforts put forth now.\n27\nProvidence is going before us, and In\ufb01nite Power is working with human\neffort. Blind indeed must be the eyes that do not see the working of the Lord,\nand deaf the ears that do not hear the call of the True Shepherd to His sheep.\nChrist longs to extend His sway over every human mind. He longs to\nstamp His image and character upon every soul. When He was on this earth,\nHe hungered for sympathy and co-operation, that His kingdom might extend\nand embrace the whole world. This earth is His purchased possession, and He\nwould have men free and pure and holy. \u201cFor the joy that was set before Him,\u201d\nHe \u201cendured the cross, despising the shame.\u201d [Hebrews 12:2.] His earthly\npilgrimage was cheered by the thought that He would not have all this travail\nfor naught, but would win man back to loyalty to God. And there are triumphs\nyet to be accomplished through the blood shed for the world, that will bring\neverlasting glory to God and to the Lamb. The heathen will be given for His\ninheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for His possession. Christ\nwill see of the travail of His soul, and be satis\ufb01ed. [See Isaiah 53:11.]\n\u201cArise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon\nthee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the\npeople: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and His glory shall be seen upon\nthee. And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and Kings to the brightness of\nthy rising. Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves\ntogether, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters\nshall be nursed at thy side. Then thou shalt see, and \ufb02ow together, and thine\nheart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the\n28\nabundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee.\u201d \u201cFor as the earth bringeth\nforth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to\nspring forth; so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring\nforth before all the nations.\u201d [Isaiah 60:1-5; 61:11.] *****\nThe commission given to the disciples is given also to us. Today, as then,\na cruci\ufb01ed and risen Saviour is to be uplifted before those who are without\nGod and without hope in the world. The Lord calls for pastors, teachers, and\nevangelists. From door to door His servants are to proclaim the message of\nsalvation. To every nation, kindred, tongue, and people the tidings of pardon\nthrough Christ are to be carried. Not with tame, lifeless utterances is the\nmessage to be given, but with clear, decided, stirring utterances. Hundreds\nare waiting for the warning to escape for their lives. The world needs to see\nin Christians an evidence of the power of Christianity. Not merely in a few\nplaces, but throughout the world, messages of mercy are needed. *****\nHe who beholds the Saviour\u2019s matchless love will be elevated in thought,\npuri\ufb01ed in heart, transformed in character. He will go forth to be a light\nto the world, to re\ufb02ect in some degree this mysterious love. The more we\ncontemplate the cross of Christ, the more fully shall we adopt the language of\nthe apostle when he said, \u201cGod forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of\nour Lord Jesus Christ. [Galatians 6:14.]\n29\nThe Minister\u2019s Responsibility\n\u201cI charge thee therefore,\u201d Paul wrote to Timothy, \u201cbefore God, and the\nLord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing\nand His kingdom: Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season;\nreprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.\u201d [2 Timothy\n4:1, 2.]\nThis solemn charge to one so zealous and faithful as was Timothy, is\na strong testimony to the importance and responsibility of the work of the\ngospel minister. Summoning Timothy before the bar of God, Paul bids\nhim preach the word, not the sayings and customs of men; to be ready to\nwitness for God whenever opportunity should present itself,\u2014before large\ncongregations and private circles, by the way and at the \ufb01reside, to friends\nand to enemies, whether in safety or exposed to hardship and peril, reproach\nand loss.\nFearing that Timothy\u2019s mild, yielding disposition might lead him to shun\nan essential part of his work, Paul exhorted him to be faithful in reproving\nsin, and even to rebuke with sharpness those who were guilty of gross evils.\nYet he was to do this \u201cwith all long-suffering and doctrine.\u201d He was to reveal\nthe patience and love of Christ, explaining and enforcing his reproofs by the\ntruths of the Word.\nTo hate and reprove sin, and at the same time to show pity and tenderness\nfor the sinner, is a dif\ufb01cult achievement. The more earnest our own efforts to\nattain to holiness of heart and life, the more acute will be our perception of\nsin, and the more decided our\n30\ndisapproval of it. We must guard against undue severity toward the\nwrong-doer; but we must also be careful not to lose sight of the exceeding\nsinfulness of sin. There is need of showing Christlike patience and love for\nthe erring one, but there is also danger of showing so great toleration for his\nerror that he will look upon himself as undeserving of reproof, and will reject\nit as uncalled for and unjust.\nA Burden for Souls\nGod\u2019s ministers must come into close companionship with Christ, and\nfollow His example in all things\u2014in purity of life, in self-denial, in\nbenevolence, in diligence, in perseverance. To win souls to the kingdom of\nGod must be their \ufb01rst consideration. With sorrow for sin and with patient\nlove, they must work as Christ worked, putting forth determined, unceasing\neffort.\nJohn Welch, a minister of the gospel, felt so great a burden for souls\nthat he often rose in the night to send up to God his supplication for their\nsalvation. On one occasion his wife pleaded with him to regard his health,\nand not venture on such exposure. His answer was, \u201cO woman, I have the\nsouls of three thousand to answer for, and I know not how it is with them.\u201d\nIn a town in New England a well was being dug. When the work was\nnearly \ufb01nished, while one man was still at the bottom, the earth caved in\nand buried him. Instantly the alarm was sent out, and mechanics, farmers,\nmerchants, lawyers, hurried breathlessly to the rescue. Ropes, ladders,\nspades, and shovels were brought by eager, willing hands. \u201cSave him, O\nsave him!\u201d was the cry.\n31\nMen worked with desperate energy, till the sweat stood in beads upon\ntheir brows and their arms trembled with the exertion. At length a pipe was\nthrust down, through which they shouted to the man to answer if he were still\nalive. The response came, \u201cAlive, but make haste. It is fearful in here.\u201d With\na shout of joy they renewed their efforts, and at last he was reached and saved,\nand the cheer that went up seemed to pierce the very heavens. \u201cHe is saved!\u201d\nechoed through every street in the town.\nWas this too great zeal and interest, too great enthusiasm, to save one\nman? It surely was not; but what is the loss of temporal life in comparison\nwith the loss of a soul? If the threatened loss of a life will arouse in human\nhearts a feeling so intense, should not the loss of a soul arouse even deeper\nsolicitude in men who claim to realize the danger of those apart from Christ?\nShall not the servants of God show as great zeal in laboring for the salvation\nof souls as was shown for the life of that one man buried in a well?\nStarving for the Bread of Life\nA godly woman once made the remark, \u201cO that we could hear the pure\ngospel as it used to be preached from the pulpit! Our minister is a good man,\nbut he does not realize the spiritual needs of the people. He clothes the cross\nof Calvary with beautiful \ufb02owers, which hide all the shame, conceal all the\nreproach. My soul is starving for the bread of life. How refreshing it would\nbe to hundreds of poor souls like me, to listen to something simple, plain, and\nscriptural, that would nourish our hearts!\u201d\n32\nThere is need of men of faith, who will not only preach, but will minister\nto the people. Men are needed who walk daily with God, who have a living\nconnection with heaven, whose words have power to bring conviction to\nhearts. Not that they may make a display of their talents and intelligence,\nare ministers to labor, but that the truth may cut its way to the soul as an\narrow from the Almighty.\nA minister, after preaching a Bible discourse which brought deep\nconviction to one of his hearers, was accosted with the question, \u201cDo you\nreally believe what you have preached?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d he answered.\n\u201cBut is it really so?\u201d asked the anxious questioner.\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said the minister, as he reached for his Bible.\nThen the man broke out, \u201cO, if this is the truth, what shall we do?\u201d\n\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d thought the minister\u2014\u201cwe\u201d? What could the man\nmean? But the question forced its way to his soul. He went away to plead\nwith God to tell him what to do. And as he prayed, there came to him with\noverwhelming force the thought that he had the solemn realities of eternity to\npresent to a dying world. For three weeks his place in the desk was vacant.\nHe was seeking an answer to the question, \u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d\nThe minister returned to his charge with an unction from the Holy One.\nHe realized that his past preaching had made little impression on his hearers.\nNow he felt upon him the terrible weight of souls. As he came to his desk,\nhe was not alone. There was a great work to be done, but he knew that God\nwould\n33\nnot fail him. Before his hearers he exalted the Saviour and His matchless\nlove. There was a revelation of the Son of God, and a revival began that\nspread through the churches of the surrounding districts.\nThe Urgency of Christ\u2019s Work\nIf our ministers realized how soon the inhabitants of the world are to be\narraigned before the judgment-seat of God, they would work more earnestly\nto lead men and women to Christ. Soon the last test is to come to all. Only\na little longer will the voice of mercy be heard; only a little longer can the\ngracious invitation be given, \u201cIf any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and\ndrink.\u201d [John 7:37.] God sends the gospel invitation to people everywhere.\nLet the messengers He sends work so harmoniously, so untiringly, that all will\ntake knowledge of them that they have been with Jesus, and learned of Him.\nOf Aaron, the high priest of Israel, it is written, He \u201cshall bear the\nnames of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his\nheart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before the Lord\ncontinually.\u201d [Exodus 28:29.] What a beautiful and expressive \ufb01gure this is\nof the unchanging love of Christ for His church! Our great High Priest, of\nwhom Aaron was a type, bears His people upon His heart. And should not\nHis earthly ministers share His love and sympathy and solicitude?\nDivine power alone will melt the sinner\u2019s heart and bring him, a penitent,\nto Christ. No great reformer or teacher, not Luther, Melanchthon, Wesley, or\nWhite\ufb01eld, could of himself have gained access to hearts, or\n34\nhave accomplished the results that these men achieved. But God spoke\nthrough them. Men felt the in\ufb02uence of a superior power, and involuntarily\nyielded to it. Today those who forget self and rely on God for success in the\nwork of soul-saving, will have the divine co-operation, and their efforts will\ntell gloriously in the salvation of souls.\nI feel constrained to say that the labors of many of our ministers lack\npower. God is waiting to bestow His grace upon them, but they pass on from\nday to day, possessing only a cold, nominal faith, presenting the theory of the\ntruth, but presenting it without that vital force which comes from a connection\nwith heaven, and which sends the spoken words home to the hearts of men.\nThey are half asleep, while all around them are souls perishing in darkness\nand error.\nMinisters of God, with hearts aglow with love for Christ and your\nfellow-men, seek to arouse those who are dead in trespasses and sins. Let your\nearnest entreaties and warnings pierce their consciences. Let your fervent\nprayers melt their hearts, and lead them in penitence to the Saviour. You\nare ambassadors for Christ, to proclaim His message of salvation. Remember\nthat a lack of consecration and wisdom in you may turn the balance for a soul,\nand send it to eternal death. You cannot afford to be careless and indifferent.\nYou need power, and this power God is willing to give you without stint. He\nasks only a humble, contrite heart, that is willing to believe and receive His\npromises. You have only to use the means that God has placed within your\nreach, and you will obtain the blessing.\n35\nThe Outlook\nWe are nearing the close of this earth\u2019s history. We have before us a\ngreat work,\u2014the closing work of giving the last warning message to a sinful\nworld. There are men who will be taken from the plow, from the vineyard,\nfrom various other branches of work, and sent forth by the Lord to give this\nmessage to the world.\nThe world is out of joint. As we look at the picture, the outlook seems\ndiscouraging. But Christ greets with hopeful assurance the very men and\nwomen who cause us discouragement. In them He sees quali\ufb01cations that\nwill enable them to take a place in His vineyard. If they will constantly be\nlearners, through His providence He will make them men and women \ufb01tted\nto do a work that is not beyond their capabilities; through the impartation of\nthe Holy Spirit, He will give them power of utterance.\nMany of the barren, unworked \ufb01elds must be entered by beginners. The\nbrightness of the Saviour\u2019s view of the world will inspire con\ufb01dence in many\nworkers, who, if they begin in humility and put their hearts into the work, will\nbe found to be the right men for the time and place. Christ sees all the misery\nand despair of the world, the sight of which would bow down some of our\nworkers of large capabilities with a weight of discouragement so great that\nthey would not know how even to begin the work of leading men and women\nto the \ufb01rst round of the ladder. Their precise methods are of little value. They\nwould stand above the lower\n36\nrounds of the ladder, saying, \u201cCome up where we are.\u201d But the poor souls do\nnot know where to put their feet.\nChrist\u2019s heart is cheered by the sight of those who are poor in every sense\nof the term; cheered by His view of the ill-used ones who are meek; cheered\nby the seemingly unsatis\ufb01ed hungering after righteousness, by the inability\nof many to begin. He welcomes, as it were, the very condition of things that\nwould discourage many ministers. He corrects our erring piety, giving the\nburden of the work for the poor and needy in the rough places of the earth, to\nmen and women who have hearts that can feel for the ignorant and for those\nthat are out of the way.\nThe Lord teaches these workers how to meet those whom He wishes\nthem to help. They will be encouraged as they see doors opening for them\nto enter places where they can do medical missionary work. Having little\nself-con\ufb01dence, they give God all the glory. Their hands may be rough and\nunskilled, but their hearts are susceptible to pity; they are \ufb01lled with an earnest\ndesire to do something to relieve the woe so abundant; and Christ is present to\nhelp them. He works through those who discern mercy in misery, gain in the\nloss of all things. When the Light of the world passes by, privileges appear\nin all hardships, order in confusion, the success and wisdom of God in that\nwhich has seemed to be failure.\nMy brethren and sisters, in your ministry come close to the people. Uplift\nthose who are cast down. Treat of calamities as disguised blessings, of woes\nas mercies. Work in a way that will cause hope to spring up in the place of\ndespair.\n37\nThe common people are to take their place as workers. Sharing the\nsorrows of their fellow-men as the Saviour shared the sorrows of humanity,\nthey will by faith see Him working with them.\n\u201cThe great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly.\u201d\n[Zephaniah 1:14.] To every worker I would say: Go forth in humble faith,\nand the Lord will go with you. But watch unto prayer. This is the science\nof your labor. The power is of God. Work in dependence upon Him,\nremembering that you are laborers together with Him. He is your Helper.\nYour strength is from Him. He will be your wisdom, your righteousness,\nyour sancti\ufb01cation, your redemption. Wear the yoke of Christ, daily learning\nof Him His meekness and lowliness. He will be your comfort, your rest.\u2014\n\u201cTestimonies for the Church,\u201d V ol. VII, pages 270-272. *****\nThe Saviour knows the depths of the world\u2019s misery and despair, knows\nby what means to bring relief. He sees on every hand souls in darkness, bowed\ndown with sin and sorrow and pain. But He sees also their possibilities. He\nsees the height to which they may attain. Although human beings have abused\ntheir mercies, wasted their talents, and lost the dignity of godlike manhood,\nthe Creator is to be glori\ufb01ed in their redemption. *****\nChrist rejoiced that He could do more for His followers than they could\nask or think. He knew that the truth, armed with the omnipotence of the Holy\nSpirit, would conquer in the contest with evil; and\n38\nthat the blood-stained banner would wave triumphantly over His followers.\nHe knew that the life of His trusting disciples would be like His,\u2014a series of\nuninterrupted victories, not seen to be such here, but recognized as such in\nthe great hereafter.\n\u201cThese things I have spoken unto you,\u201d He said, \u201cthat in Me ye might\nhave peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I\nhave overcome the world.\u201d [John 16:33,] Christ did not fail, neither was He\ndiscouraged; and His followers are to manifest a faith of the same enduring\nnature. They are to live as He lived, and work as He worked, because they\ndepend on Him as the great Master-worker.\nCourage, energy, and perseverance they must possess. Though apparent\nimpossibilities obstruct their way, by His grace they are to go forward. Instead\nof deploring dif\ufb01culties, they are called upon to surmount them. They are to\ndespair of nothing, and to hope for everything. With the golden chain of His\nmatchless love, Christ had bound them to the throne of God. It is His purpose\nthat the highest in\ufb02uence in the universe, emanating from the Source of all\npower, shall be theirs. They are to have power to resist evil, power that neither\nearth, nor death, nor hell can master, power that will enable them to overcome\nas Christ overcame.\n39\n40\nSection II. Ministers of\nRighteousness\nChrist Our Example\nOur Lord Jesus Christ came to this world as the unwearied servant of\nman\u2019s necessity. He \u201ctook our in\ufb01rmities, and bare our sicknesses,\u201d [Matthew\n8:17.] that He might minister to every need of humanity. The burden of\ndisease and wretchedness and sin He came to remove. It was His mission to\nbring to men complete restoration; He came to give them health and peace\nand perfection of character.\nVaried were the circumstances and needs of those who besought His aid,\nand none who came to Him went away unhelped. From Him \ufb02owed a stream\nof healing power, and in body and mind and soul men were made whole.\nThe Saviour\u2019s work was not restricted to any time or place. His\ncompassion knew no limit. On so large a scale did He conduct His work\nof healing and teaching that there was no building in Palestine large enough\nto receive the multitudes that thronged to Him. On the green hillslopes of\nGalilee, in the thoroughfares of travel, by the seashore, in the synagogues, and\nin every place where the sick could be brought to Him, was to be found His\nhospital. In every city, every town, every village through which He passed,\nHe laid His\n41\nhands upon the af\ufb02icted ones, and healed them. Wherever there were hearts\nready to receive His message, He comforted them with the assurance of their\nheavenly Father\u2019s love. All day He ministered to those who came to Him; in\nthe evening He gave attention to such as through the day must toil to earn a\npittance for the support of their families.\nJesus carried the awful weight of responsibility for the salvation of men.\nHe knew that unless there was a decided change in the principles and purposes\nof the human race, all would be lost. This was the burden of His soul, and\nnone could appreciate the weight that rested upon Him. Through childhood,\nyouth, and manhood, He walked alone. Yet it was heaven to be in His\npresence. Day by day He met trials and temptations; day by day He was\nbrought into contact with evil, and witnessed its power upon those whom He\nwas seeking to bless and to save. Yet He did not fail nor become discouraged.\nIn all things He brought His wishes into strict abeyance to His mission.\nHe glori\ufb01ed His life by making everything in it subordinate to the will of\nHis Father. When in His youth, His mother, \ufb01nding Him in the school of the\nrabbis, said, \u201cSon, why hast Thou thus dealt with us?\u201d He answered,\u2014and\nHis answer is the key-note of His life-work,\u2014\u201cHow is it that ye sought Me?\nwist ye not that I must be about My Father\u2019s business?\u201d [Luke 2:48, 49.]\nHis life was one of constant self-sacri\ufb01ce. He had no home in this world,\nexcept as the kindness of friends provided for Him as a wayfarer. He came\nto live in our behalf the life of the poorest, and to walk and work among the\nneedy and the suffering. Unrecognized and\n42\nunhonored, He walked in and out among the people for whom He had done\nso much.\nHe was always patient and cheerful, and the af\ufb02icted hailed Him as a\nmessenger of life and peace. He saw the needs of men and women, children\nand youth, and to all He gave the invitation, \u201cCome unto Me.\u201d\nDuring His ministry, Jesus devoted more time to healing the sick than to\npreaching. His miracles testi\ufb01ed to the truth of His words, that He came not\nto destroy, but to save. Wherever He went, the tidings of His mercy preceded\nHim. Where He had passed, the objects of His compassion were rejoicing in\nhealth, and making trial of their new-found powers. Crowds were collecting\naround them to hear from their lips the works that the Lord had wrought. His\nvoice was the \ufb01rst sound that many had ever heard, His name the \ufb01rst word\nthey had ever spoken, His face the \ufb01rst they had ever looked upon. Why\nshould they not love Jesus, and sound His praise? As He passed through the\ntowns and cities, He was like a vital current, diffusing life and joy....\nThe Saviour made each work of healing an occasion of implanting divine\nprinciples in the mind and soul. This was the purpose of His work. He\nimparted earthly blessings, that He might incline the hearts of men to receive\nthe gospel of His grace.\nChrist might have occupied the highest place among the teachers of the\nJewish nation, but He preferred rather to take the gospel to the poor. He went\nfrom place to place, that those in the highways and byways might hear the\nwords of truth. By the sea, on the mountainside, in the streets of the city, in\nthe synagogue, His voice was heard explaining the Scriptures.\n43\nOften He taught in the outer court of the temple, that the Gentiles might hear\nHis words.\nSo unlike the explanations of Scripture given by the scribes and Pharisees\nwas Christ\u2019s teaching, that the attention of the people was arrested. The\nrabbis dwelt upon tradition, upon human theory and speculation. Often that\nwhich men had taught and written about the Scripture was put in place of\nthe Scripture itself. The subject of Christ\u2019s teaching was the word of God.\nHe met questioners with a plain, \u201cIt is written,\u201d \u201cWhat saith the Scripture?\u201d\n\u201cHow readest thou?\u201d At every opportunity, when an interest was awakened\nby either friend or foe, He presented the Word. With clearness and power\nHe proclaimed the gospel message. His words shed a \ufb02ood of light on the\nteachings of patriarchs and prophets, and the Scriptures came to men as a\nnew revelation. Never before had His hearers perceived in the word of God\nsuch depth of meaning.\nSimplicity of Christ\u2019s Teaching\nNever was there such an evangelist as Christ. He was the Majesty of\nheaven, but He humbled Himself to take our nature, that He might meet men\nwhere they were. To all people, rich and poor, free and bond, Christ, the\nMessenger of the covenant, brought the tidings of salvation. His fame as the\ngreat Healer spread throughout Palestine. The sick came to the places through\nwhich He would pass, that they might call on Him for help. Hither, too, came\nmany anxious to hear His words and to receive a touch of His hand. Thus He\nwent from city to city, from town to town, preaching the gospel and healing\nthe sick,\u2014the King of glory in the lowly garb of humanity.\n44\nHe attended the great yearly festivals of the nation, and to the multitude\nabsorbed in outward ceremony He spoke of heavenly things, bringing eternity\nwithin their view. To all He brought treasures from the storehouse of\nwisdom. He spoke to them in language so simple that they could not fail\nof understanding. By methods peculiarly His own, He helped all who were\nin sorrow and af\ufb02iction. With tender, courteous grace, He ministered to the\nsin-sick soul, bringing healing and strength.\nThe Prince of teachers, He sought access to the people by the pathway of\ntheir most familiar associations. He presented the truth in such a way that ever\nafter it was to His hearers intertwined with their most hallowed recollections\nand sympathies. He taught in a way that made them feel the completeness\nof His identi\ufb01cation with their interests and happiness. His instruction was\nso direct, His illustrations were so appropriate, His words so sympathetic and\ncheerful, that His hearers were charmed. The simplicity and earnestness with\nwhich He addressed the needy, hallowed every word.\nTo Rich and Poor Alike\nWhat a busy life He led! Day by day He might have been seen entering the\nhumble abodes of want and sorrow, speaking hope to the downcast and peace\nto the distressed. Gracious, tender-hearted, pitiful, He went about lifting\nup the bowed-down and comforting the sorrowful. Wherever He went, He\ncarried blessing.\nWhile He ministered to the poor, Jesus studied also to \ufb01nd ways of\nreaching the rich. He sought the\n45\nacquaintance of the wealthy and cultured Pharisee, the Jewish nobleman, and\nthe Roman ruler. He accepted their invitations, attended their feasts, made\nHimself familiar with their interests and occupations, that He might gain\naccess to their hearts, and reveal to them the imperishable riches.\nChrist came to this world to show that by receiving power from on high,\nman can live an unsullied life. With unwearying patience and sympathetic\nhelpfulness, He met men in their necessities. By the gentle touch of grace,\nHe banished from the soul unrest and doubt, changing enmity to love, and\nunbelief to con\ufb01dence....\nChrist recognized no distinction of nationality or rank or creed. The\nscribes and Pharisees desired to make a local and a national bene\ufb01t of the\ngifts of heaven, and to exclude the rest of God\u2019s family in the world. But\nChrist came to break down every wall of partition. He came to show that His\ngift of mercy and love is as uncon\ufb01ned as the air, the light, or the showers of\nrain that refresh the earth.\nThe life of Christ established a religion in which there is no caste, a\nreligion by which Jew and Gentile, free and bond, are linked in a common\nbrotherhood, equal before God. No question of policy in\ufb02uenced His\nmovements. He made no difference between neighbors and strangers, friends\nand enemies. That which appealed to His heart was a soul thirsting for the\nwaters of life.\nHe passed by no human being as worthless, but sought to apply the\nhealing remedy to every soul. In whatever company He found Himself,\nHe presented a lesson appropriate to the time and the circumstances. Every\nneglect or insult shown by men to their fellowmen,\n46\nonly made Him more conscious of their need of His divine-human sympathy.\nHe sought to inspire with hope the roughest and most unpromising, setting\nbefore them the assurance that they might become blameless and harmless,\nattaining such a character as would make them manifest as the children of\nGod.\nOften He met those who had drifted under Satan\u2019s control, and who had\nno power to break from his snare. To such a one, discouraged, sick, tempted,\nfallen, Jesus would speak words of tenderest pity, words that were needed and\ncould be understood. Others He met who were \ufb01ghting a hand-to-hand battle\nwith the adversary of souls. These He encouraged to persevere, assuring them\nthat they would win; for angels of God were on their side, and would give\nthem the victory.\nAt the table of the publicans He sat as an honored guest, by His sympathy\nand social kindliness showing that He recognized the dignity of humanity;\nand men longed to become worthy of His con\ufb01dence. Upon their thirsty\nhearts His words fell with blessed, life-giving power. New impulses were\nawakened, and to these outcasts of society there opened the possibility of a\nnew life.\nThough He was a Jew, Jesus mingled freely with the Samaritans, setting\nat naught the Pharisaic customs of His nation. In face of their prejudices He\naccepted the hospitality of this despised people. He slept with them under\ntheir roofs, ate with them at their tables,\u2014partaking of the food prepared\nand served by their hands,\u2014taught in their streets, and treated them with the\nutmost kindness and courtesy. And while He drew their hearts to Him by the\ntie of human sympathy, His divine grace brought to them the salvation which\nthe Jews rejected.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 17-26.\n47\nChrist as a Teacher\nThe world\u2019s Redeemer went about doing good. When before the people,\nspeaking to them the words of eternal truth, with what earnestness He\nwatched the changing countenances of His hearers! The faces that expressed\ndeep interest and pleasure as they listened to His words, gave Him great\nsatisfaction. And when the truth, plainly uttered, touched some cherished\nsin or idol, He marked the change of countenance, the cold, stern, forbidding\nlook, which told that the truth was unwelcome. Jesus knew that the plain\nreproof of sin was the very thing that His hearers needed; and the light He\nshed into the darkened chambers of their minds would have been the greatest\nblessing to them, had they accepted it.\nChrist\u2019s work was to lay down in simple lines, yet so as to be clearly\nunderstood, truths that, if obeyed, would bring peace and happiness to the\nsoul. He could look beneath the surface, and see the cherished sins that were\nruining the life and character, and shutting souls away from God. He pointed\nout these sins, that all might see them in the true light, and put them away.\nIn some who presented the most hardened exterior, He discerned hopeful\nsubjects. He knew that they would respond to the light, and that they would\nbecome His true followers.\nAs the arrows of truth pierced the hearts of Christ\u2019s hearers, breaking\nthrough the barriers of sel\ufb01shness and bringing humiliation, contrition, and\n\ufb01nally gratitude, the Saviour\u2019s heart was made glad. When His eyes swept\nover the throng of listeners about Him, and\n48\nHe recognized among them the same faces that He had seen on former\noccasions, joy was expressed in His countenance, that here were hopeful\nsubjects of His kingdom.\nThe messengers of Christ, those whom He sends in His stead, will have\nthe same feelings, the same earnest interest. And those who are tempted to\nthink that their labor is not appreciated, and are inclined to be discouraged,\nshould remember that Jesus had just as hard hearts to deal with, and had a\nmore trying experience than they have had or ever can have. He taught the\npeople with patient love. His deep, searching wisdom knew the wants of\nevery soul among His listeners; and when He saw them refuse the message of\npeace and love that He came to give them, His heart felt anguish to the very\ndepths. *****\nThe world\u2019s Redeemer did not come with outward display, or a show of\nworldly wisdom. Men could not see, beneath the guise of humanity, the glory\nof the Son of God. He was \u201cdespised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows,\nand acquainted with grief.\u201d He was to them as \u201ca root out of a dry ground,\u201d\nwith \u201cno form nor comeliness,\u201d [Isaiah 53:3, 2.] that they should desire Him.\nBut He declared, \u201cThe Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me; because the Lord\nhath anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the meek; He hath sent Me\nto bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the\nopening of the prison to them that are bound.\u201d [Isaiah 61:1.]\nChrist reached the people where they were. He presented the plain truth\nto their minds in the most\n49\nforcible, simple language. The humble poor, the most unlearned, could\ncomprehend, through faith in Him, the most exalted truths. No one needed to\nconsult the learned doctors as to His meaning. He did not perplex the ignorant\nwith mysterious inferences, or use unaccustomed and learned words, of which\nthey had no knowledge. The greatest Teacher the world has ever known, was\nthe most de\ufb01nite, simple, and practical in His instruction. *****\n\u201cThat was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the\nworld.\u201d [John 1:9.] The world has had its great teachers, men of giant intellect\nand wonderful research, men whose utterances have stimulated thought and\nopened to view vast \ufb01elds of knowledge; and these men have been honored\nas guides and benefactors of their race. But there is One who stands higher\nthan they. \u201cAs many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the\nsons of God.\u201d \u201cNo man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son,\nwhich is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him.\u201d [John 1:12, 18.]\nWe can trace the line of the world\u2019s great teachers as far back as human\nrecords extend; but the Light was before them. As the moon and the stars\nof the solar system shine by the re\ufb02ected light of the sun, so, as far as their\nteaching is true, do the world\u2019s great thinkers re\ufb02ect the rays of the Sun of\nRighteousness. Every gem of thought, every \ufb02ash of the intellect, is from the\nLight of the World.\n50\nA Lesson for Our Time\nThe experience of Enoch and of John the Baptist represents what ours\nshould be. Far more than we do, we need to study the lives of these men,\u2014he\nwho was translated to heaven without seeing death; and he who, before\nChrist\u2019s \ufb01rst advent, was called to prepare the way of the Lord, to make His\npaths straight.\nThe Experience of Enoch\nOf Enoch it is written that he lived sixty-\ufb01ve years and begat a son; after\nthat he walked with God three hundred years. During those earlier years,\nEnoch had loved and feared God, and had kept His commandments. After the\nbirth of his \ufb01rst son, he reached a higher experience; he was drawn into closer\nrelationship with God. As he saw the child\u2019s love for its father, its simple trust\nin his protection; as he felt the deep yearning tenderness of his own heart for\nthat \ufb01rst-born son, he learned a precious lesson of the wonderful love of God\nto man in the gift of His Son, and the con\ufb01dence which the children of God\nmay repose in their heavenly Father. The in\ufb01nite, unfathomable love of God\nthrough Christ, became the subject of his meditations day and night. With all\nthe fervor of his soul he sought to reveal that love to the people among whom\nhe dwelt.\nEnoch\u2019s walk with God was not in a trance or a vision, but in all the duties\nof his daily life. He did not become a hermit, shutting himself entirely from\nthe world; for he had, in the world, a work to do for God.\n51\nIn the family and in his intercourse with men, as a husband and father, a\nfriend, a citizen, he was the steadfast, unwavering servant of God.\nIn the midst of a life of active labor, Enoch steadfastly maintained his\ncommunion with God. The greater and more pressing his labors, the more\nconstant and earnest were his prayers. He continued to exclude himself at\ncertain periods from all society. After remaining for a time among the people,\nlaboring to bene\ufb01t them by instruction and example, he would withdraw, to\nspend a season in solitude, hungering and thirsting for that divine knowledge\nwhich God alone can impart.\nCommuning thus with God, Enoch came more and more to re\ufb02ect the\ndivine image. His face was radiant with a holy light, even the light that shineth\nin the face of Jesus. As he came forth from these divine communings, even\nthe ungodly beheld with awe the impress of heaven upon his countenance.\nHis faith waxed stronger, his love became more ardent, with the lapse\nof centuries. To him prayer was as the breath of the soul. He lived in the\natmosphere of heaven.\nAs the scenes of the future were opened to his view, Enoch became a\npreacher of righteousness, bearing God\u2019s message to all who would hear the\nwords of warning. In the land where Cain had sought to \ufb02ee from the divine\npresence, the prophet of God made known the wonderful scenes that had\npassed before his vision. \u201cBehold,\u201d he declared, \u201cthe Lord cometh with ten\nthousands of His saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that\nare ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds.\u201d [Jude 14, 15.]\n52\nThe power of God that wrought with His servant was felt by those who\nheard. Some gave heed to the warning and renounced their sins; but the\nmultitudes mocked at the solemn message. The servants of God are to bear a\nsimilar message to the world in the last days, and it also will be received by\nthe majority with unbelief and mockery.\nAs year after year passed, deeper and deeper grew the tide of human guilt,\ndarker and darker gathered the clouds of divine judgment. Yet Enoch, the\nwitness of faith, held on his way, warning, pleading, and teaching, striving to\nturn back the tide of guilt and to stay the bolts of vengeance.\nThe men of that generation mocked the folly of him who sought not to\ngather gold or silver, or to build up possessions here. But Enoch\u2019s heart was\nupon eternal treasures. He had looked upon the celestial city. He had seen the\nKing in His glory in the midst of Zion. The greater the existing iniquity, the\nmore earnest was his longing for the home of God. While still on earth, he\ndwelt by faith in the realms of light.\n\u201cBlessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\u201d [Matthew 5:8.] For\nthree hundred years Enoch had been seeking purity of heart, that he might be\nin harmony with heaven. For three centuries he had walked with God. Day\nby day he had longed for a closer union; nearer and nearer had grown the\ncommunion, until God took him to Himself. He had stood at the threshold of\nthe eternal world, only a step between him and the land of the blest; and now\nthe portals opened, the walk with God, so long pursued on earth, continued,\nand he passed through the gates of the holy city,\u2014the \ufb01rst from among men\nto enter there.\n53\n\u201cBy faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; ...for before\nhis translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.\u201d [Hebrews 11:5.]\nTo such communion God is calling us. As was Enoch\u2019s, so must be their\nholiness of character who shall be redeemed from among men at the Lord\u2019s\nsecond coming.\nThe Experience of John the Baptist\nJohn the Baptist in his desert life was taught of God. He studied the\nrevelations of God in nature. Under the guiding of the divine Spirit, he studied\nthe scrolls of the prophets. By day and by night, Christ was his study, his\nmeditation, until mind and heart and soul were \ufb01lled with the glorious vision.\nHe looked upon the King in His beauty, and self was lost sight of.\nHe beheld the majesty of holiness, and knew himself to be inef\ufb01cient and\nunworthy. It was God\u2019s message that he was to declare. It was in God\u2019s\npower and His righteousness that he was to stand. He was ready to go forth as\nHeaven\u2019s messenger, unawed by the human, because he had looked upon the\nDivine. He could stand fearless in the presence of earthly monarchs, because\nwith trembling he had bowed before the King of Kings.\nWith no elaborate arguments or \ufb01ne-spun theories did John declare his\nmessage. Startling and stern, yet full of hope, his voice was heard from the\nwilderness, \u201cRepent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u201d [Matthew\n3:2.] With a new, strange power it moved the people. The whole nation was\nstirred. Multitudes \ufb02ocked to the wilderness.\n54\nUnlearned peasants and \ufb01shermen from the surrounding country; the\nRoman soldiers from the barracks of Herod; chieftains with their swords at\ntheir sides, ready to put down anything that might savor of rebellion; the\navaricious tax-gatherers from their toll-booths; and from the Sanhedrim the\nphylactered priests,\u2014all listened as if spellbound; and all, even the Pharisee\nand the Sadducee, the cold, unimpressible scoffer, went away with the sneer\nsilenced, and cut to the heart with a sense of their sins. Herod in his palace\nheard the message, and the proud, sin-hardened ruler trembled at the call to\nrepentance.\nIn this age, just prior to the second coming of Christ in the clouds of\nheaven, such a work as that of John is to be done. God calls for men who\nwill prepare a people to stand in the great day of the Lord. The message\npreceding the public ministry of Christ was, Repent, publicans and sinners;\nrepent, Pharisees and Sadducees; \u201crepent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at\nhand.\u201d As a people who believe in Christ\u2019s soon coming, we have a message\nto bear,\u2014\u201cPrepare to meet thy God.\u201d [Amos 4:12.]\nOur message must be as direct as was the message of John. He rebuked\nKings for their iniquity. Notwithstanding that his life was imperiled, he did\nnot hesitate to declare God\u2019s word. And our work in this age must be done as\nfaithfully.\nIn order to give such a message as John gave, we must have a spiritual\nexperience like his. The same work must be wrought in us. We must behold\nGod, and in beholding Him, lose sight of self.\nJohn had by nature the faults and weaknesses common to humanity; but\nthe touch of divine love had\n55\ntransformed him. When, after Christ\u2019s ministry began, the disciples of John\ncame to him with the complaint that all men were following the new Teacher,\nJohn showed how clearly he understood his relation to the Messiah, and how\ngladly he welcomed the One for whom he had prepared the way.\n\u201cA man can receive nothing,\u201d he said, \u201cexcept it be given him from\nheaven. Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but\nthat I am sent before Him. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the\nfriend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him; rejoiceth greatly\nbecause of the bridegroom\u2019s voice: this my joy therefore is ful\ufb01lled. He must\nincrease, but I must decrease.\u201d [John 3:27-30.]\nLooking in faith to the Redeemer, John had risen to the height of\nself-abnegation. He sought not to attract men to himself, but to lift their\nthoughts higher and still higher, until they should rest upon the Lamb of God.\nHe himself had been only a voice, a cry in the wilderness. Now with joy\nhe accepted silence and obscurity, that the eyes of all might be turned to the\nLight of life.\nThose who are true to their calling as messengers of God, will not seek\nhonor for themselves. Love for self will be swallowed up in love for Christ.\nThey will recognize that it is their work to proclaim, as did John the Baptist,\n\u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d [John\n1:29.]\nThe soul of the prophet, emptied of self, was \ufb01lled with the light of\nthe Divine. In words that were almost a counterpart of the words of Christ\nHimself, he bore witness to the Saviour\u2019s glory. \u201cHe that cometh\n56\nfrom above,\u201d he said, \u201cis above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and\nspeaketh of the earth: He that cometh from heaven is above all.\u201d \u201cFor He\nwhom God hath sent speaketh the words of God.\u201d [John 3:31, 34.]\nIn this glory of Christ all His followers are to share. The Saviour could\nsay, \u201cI seek not Mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent\nMe.\u201d [John 5:30.] And John declared, \u201cGod giveth not the Spirit by measure\nunto Him.\u201d So with the followers of Christ. We can receive of heaven\u2019s light\nonly as we are willing to be emptied of self. We can discern the character\nof God, and accept Christ by faith, only as we consent to the bringing into\ncaptivity of every thought to the obedience of Christ. And to all who do this,\nthe Holy Spirit is given without measure. In Christ \u201cdwelleth all the fulness\nof the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in Him.\u201d [Colossians 2:9, 10.]\n*****\nThe life of John was not spent in idleness, in ascetic gloom, or in sel\ufb01sh\nisolation. From time to time he went forth to mingle with men; and he was\never an interested observer of what was passing in the world. From his quiet\nretreat he watched the unfolding of events. With vision illuminated by the\nDivine Spirit he studied the character of men, that he might understand how\nto reach their hearts with the message of heaven. The burden of his mission\nwas upon him. In solitude, by meditation and prayer, he sought to gird up his\nsoul for the life-work before him.\n57\nPaul, The Apostle to the Gentiles\nForemost among those called to preach the gospel of Christ stands the\napostle Paul, to every minister an example of loyalty, devotion, and untiring\neffort. His experiences and his instruction regarding the sacredness of the\nminister\u2019s work, are a source of help and inspiration to those engaged in the\ngospel ministry.\nBefore his conversion, Paul was a bitter persecutor of the followers of\nChrist. But at the gate of Damascus a voice spoke to him, light from heaven\nshone into his soul, and in the revelation that there came to him, of the\nCruci\ufb01ed One, he beheld that which changed the whole current of his life.\nHenceforth love for the Lord of glory, whom he had so relentlessly persecuted\nin the person of His saints, came before all else. To him had been given the\nministry of making known \u201cthe mystery\u201d which had been \u201ckept secret since\nthe world began.\u201d [Romans 16:25.] \u201cHe is a chosen vessel unto Me,\u201d declared\nthe Angel who appeared to Ananias, \u201cto bear My name before the Gentiles,\nand Kings, and the children of Israel.\u201d [Acts 9:15.]\nAnd throughout his long term of service, Paul never faltered in his\nallegiance to his Saviour. \u201cI count not myself to have apprehended,\u201d he wrote\nto the Philippians; \u201cbut this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are\nbehind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward\nthe mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ. [Philippians 3:13,\n14.]\nPaul\u2019s was a life of intense and varied activities. From city to city, from\ncountry to country, he\n58\njourneyed, telling the story of the cross, winning converts to the gospel, and\nestablishing churches. For these churches he had a constant care, and he\nwrote many letters of instruction to them. At times he worked at his trade to\nearn his daily bread. But in all the busy activity of his life, he never lost sight\nof the one great purpose,\u2014to press toward the mark of his high calling.\nPaul carried with him the atmosphere of heaven. All who associated\nwith him felt the in\ufb02uence of his union with Christ. The fact that his\nown life exempli\ufb01ed the truth he proclaimed, gave convincing power to his\npreaching. Here lies the power of the truth. The unstudied, unconscious\nin\ufb02uence of a holy life is the most convincing sermon that can be given in\nfavor of Christianity. Argument, even when unanswerable, may provoke only\nopposition; but a godly example has a power that it is impossible wholly to\nresist.\nThe apostle\u2019s heart burned with love for sinners, and he put all his energies\ninto the work of soul-winning. There never lived a more self-denying,\npersevering worker. The blessings he received he prized as so many\nadvantages to be used in blessing others. He lost no opportunity of speaking\nof the Saviour or of helping those in trouble. Wherever he could \ufb01nd a\nhearing, he sought to counteract wrong and to turn the feet of men and women\ninto the path of righteousness.\nPaul never forgot the responsibility resting on him as a minister of Christ;\nor that if souls were lost through unfaithfulness on his part, God would hold\nhim accountable. \u201cI take you to record this day,\u201d he declared, \u201cthat I am pure\nfrom the blood of all men.\u201d [Acts 20:26.] \u201cWhereof I am made a minister,\u201d\nhe said of the gospel, \u201caccording to the dispensation of God which is given\n59\nto me for you, to ful\ufb01ll the word of God; even the mystery which hath\nbeen hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to His\nsaints: to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of\nthis mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:\nwhom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom;\nthat we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: whereunto I also\nlabor, striving according to His working, which worketh in me mightily.\u201d\n[Colossians 1:25-29]\nThese words present before the worker for Christ a high standard of\nattainment, yet this standard all can reach who, putting themselves under the\ncontrol of the great Teacher, learn daily in the school of Christ. The power\nat God\u2019s command is limitless; and the minister who in his great need shuts\nhimself in with the Lord, may be assured that he will receive that which will\nbe to his hearers a savor of life unto life.\nPaul\u2019s writings show that the gospel minister should be an example of the\ntruths that he teaches, \u201cgiving no offense in anything, that the ministry be not\nblamed.\u201d [2 Corinthians 6:3.] To Titus he wrote, \u201cYoung men likewise exhort\nto be sober-minded. In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works: in\ndoctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech, that cannot\nbe condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no\nevil thing to say of you.\u201d [Titus 2:6-8.]\nOf his own work he has left us a picture in his letter to the Corinthian\nbelievers: \u201cIn all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in\nmuch patience, in af\ufb02ictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in\nimprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in\n60\nfastings; by pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the\nHoly Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God,\nby the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor\nand dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true; as\nunknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened,\nand not killed; as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many\nrich.\u201d [2 Corinthians 6:4-10.]\nPaul\u2019s heart was \ufb01lled with a deep, abiding sense of his responsibility;\nand he labored in close communion with Him who is the fountain of justice,\nmercy, and truth. He clung to the cross of Christ as his only guaranty of\nsuccess. The love of the Saviour was the undying motive that upheld him\nin his con\ufb02icts with self and in his struggle against evil, as in the service\nof Christ he pressed forward against the unfriendliness of the world and the\nopposition of his enemies.\nWhat the church needs in these days of peril, is an army of workers\nwho, like Paul, have educated themselves for usefulness, who have a deep\nexperience in the things of God, and who are \ufb01lled with earnestness and zeal.\nSancti\ufb01ed, self-sacri\ufb01cing men are needed; men who are brave and true; men\nin whose hearts Christ is formed, \u201cthe hope of glory,\u201d [Colossians 1:27.] and\nwho with lips touched with holy \ufb01re will \u201cpreach the word.\u201d [2 Timothy 4:2.]\nFor the want of such workers the cause of God languishes, and fatal errors,\nlike a deadly poison, taint the morals and blight the hopes of a large part of\nthe human race.\nAs the faithful, toil-worn standard-bearers are offering up their lives for\nthe truth\u2019s sake, who will come forward to take their place? Will our young\nmen accept\n61\nthe holy trust at the hand of their fathers? Are they preparing to \ufb01ll the\nvacancies made by the death of the faithful? Will the apostle\u2019s charge be\nheeded, the call to duty be heard, amid the incitements to sel\ufb01shness and\nambition that allure the youth?\n62\nSection III. The Needed\nPreparation\nYoung Men in the Ministry\nThere must be no belittling of the gospel ministry. No enterprise should\nbe so conducted as to cause the ministry of the word to be looked upon as\nan inferior matter. It is not so. Those who belittle the ministry are belittling\nChrist. The highest of all work is ministry in its various lines, and it should\nbe kept before the youth that there is no work more blessed of God than that\nof the gospel minister.\nLet not our young men be deterred from entering the ministry. There is\ndanger that through glowing representations some will be drawn away from\nthe path where God bids them walk. Some have been encouraged to take\na course of study in medical lines who ought to be preparing themselves to\nenter the ministry. The Lord calls for more ministers to labor in His vineyard.\nThe words were spoken, \u201cStrengthen the outposts; have faithful sentinels in\nevery part of the world.\u201d God calls for you, young men. He calls for whole\narmies of young men who are large-hearted and large-minded, and who have\na deep love for Christ and the truth.\nThe measure of capacity or learning is of far less consequence than is the\nspirit with which you engage\n63\nin the work. It is not great and learned men that the ministry needs; it\nis not eloquent sermonizers. God calls for men who will give themselves\nto Him to be imbued with His Spirit. The cause of Christ and humanity\ndemands sancti\ufb01ed, self-sacri\ufb01cing men, those who can go forth without the\ncamp, bearing the reproach. Let them be strong, valiant men, \ufb01t for worthy\nenterprises, and let them make a covenant with God by sacri\ufb01ce.\nThe ministry is no place for idlers. God\u2019s servants are to make full proof\nof their ministry. They will not be sluggards, but as expositors of His word\nthey will put forth their utmost energies to be faithful. They should never\ncease to be learners. They are to keep their own souls alive to the sacredness\nof the work and to the great responsibilities of their calling, that they may at\nno time or place bring to God a maimed sacri\ufb01ce, an offering which has cost\nthem neither study nor prayer.\nThe Lord has need of men of intense spiritual life. Every worker may\nreceive an endowment of strength from on high, and may go forward with\nfaith and hope in the path where God bids him walk. The word of God abides\nin the young, consecrated laborer. He is quick, earnest, powerful, having in\nthe counsel of God an unfailing source of supply.\nGod has called this people to give to the world the message of Christ\u2019s\nsoon coming. We are to give to men the last call to the gospel feast, the last\ninvitation to the marriage supper of the Lamb. Thousands of places that have\nnot heard the call are yet to hear it. Many who have not given the message\nare yet to proclaim it. Again I appeal to our young men:\n64\nHas not God called upon to you to sound this message? *****\nHow many of our young men will enter the service of God, not to be\nserved, but to serve? In times past there were those who fastened their minds\nupon one soul after another, saying, \u201cLord, help me to save this soul.\u201d But\nnow such instances are rare. How many act as if they realized the peril of\nsinners? How many take those whom they know to be in peril, presenting\nthem to God in prayer, and supplicating Him to save them?\nThe apostle Paul could say of the early church, \u201cThey glori\ufb01ed God in\nme.\u201d [Galatians 1:24.] Shall we not strive to live so that the same words\ncan be said of us? The Lord will provide ways and means for those who\nwill seek Him with the whole heart. He desires us to acknowledge the divine\nsuperintendence shown in preparing \ufb01elds of labor and in preparing the way\nfor these \ufb01elds to be occupied successfully.\nLet ministers and evangelists have more seasons of earnest prayer with\nthose who are convicted by the truth. Remember that Christ is always with\nyou. The Lord has in readiness the most precious exhibitions of His grace to\nstrengthen and encourage the sincere, humble worker. Then re\ufb02ect to others\nthe light which God has caused to shine upon you. Those who do this bring\nto the Lord the most precious offering. The hearts of those who bear the good\ntidings of salvation are aglow with the spirit of praise.... *****\nThe number of workers in the ministry is not to be lessened, but greatly\nincreased. Where there is now\n65\none minister in the \ufb01eld, twenty are to be added; and if the Spirit of God\ncontrols them, these twenty will so present the truth that twenty more will be\nadded. *****\nChrist\u2019s dignity and of\ufb01ce-work are in imposing such conditions as\nHe pleases. His followers are to become more and more a power in the\nproclamation of the truth as they draw nearer to the perfection of faith\nand of love for their brethren. God has provided divine assistance for all\nthe emergencies to which our human resources are unequal. He gives the\nHoly Spirit to help in every strait, to strengthen our hope and assurance, to\nilluminate our minds and purify our hearts. He means that suf\ufb01cient facilities\nshall be provided for the working out of His plans. I bid you seek counsel\nfrom God. Seek Him with the whole heart, and \u201cwhatsoever He saith unto\nyou, do.\u201d [John 2:5.]\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:414, 415. *****\nWith such an army of workers as our youth, rightly trained, might furnish,\nhow soon the message of a cruci\ufb01ed, risen, and soon-coming Saviour might\nbe carried to the whole world! How soon might the end come,\u2014the end of\nsuffering and sorrow and sin! How soon, in place of a possession here, with\nits blight of sin and pain, our children might receive their inheritance where\n\u201cthe righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever;\u201d where \u201cthe\ninhabitant shall not say, I am sick,\u201d and \u201cthe voice of weeping shall be no\nmore heard!\u201d [Psalm 37:29; Isaiah 33:24; 65:19.]\u2014 \u201cEducation,\u201d page 271.\n66\nThe Youth To Be Burden-Bearers\n\u201cI have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word\nof God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.\u201d [1 John 2:14.]\nIn order that the work may go forward in all its branches, God calls\nfor youthful vigor, zeal, and courage. He has chosen the youth to aid in\nthe advancement of His cause. To plan with clear mind and execute with\ncourageous hand demands fresh, uncrippled energies. Young men and women\nare invited to give God the strength of their youth, that through the exercise\nof their powers, through keen thought and vigorous action, they may bring\nglory to Him and salvation to their fellow-men.\nIn view of their high calling, the youth among us should not seek for\namusement or live for sel\ufb01sh grati\ufb01cation. The salvation of souls is to be the\nmotive that inspires them to action. In their God-given strength they are to\nrise above every enslaving, debasing habit. They are to ponder well the paths\nof their feet, remembering that where they lead the way, others will follow.\nNo one lives to himself; all exert an in\ufb02uence for good or for evil. Because\nof this, the apostle exhorts young men to be sober-minded. How can they be\notherwise when they remember that they are to be co-workers with Christ,\npartakers with Him of His self-denial and sacri\ufb01ce, His forbearance and\ngracious benevolence?\nTo the youth of today, as surely as to Timothy, are spoken the words,\n\u201cStudy to show thyself approved\n67\nunto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing\nthe word of truth.\u201d \u201cFlee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness,\nfaith, charity, peace.\u201d \u201cBe thou an example of the believers, in word, in\nconversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.\u201d [2 Timothy 2:15, 22;\n1 Timothy 4:12.]\nThe burden-bearers among us are falling in death. Many of those who\nhave been foremost in carrying out the reforms instituted by us as a people,\nare now past the meridian of life, and are declining in physical and mental\nstrength. With the deepest concern the question may be asked, Who will \ufb01ll\ntheir places? To whom are to be committed the vital interests of the church\nwhen the present standard-bearers fall? We cannot but look anxiously upon\nthe youth of today as those who must take these burdens, and upon whom\nresponsibilities must fall. These must take up the work where others leave it,\nand their course will determine whether morality, religion, and vital godliness\nshall prevail, or whether immorality and in\ufb01delity shall corrupt and blight all\nthat is valuable.\nThose who are older must educate the youth, by precept and example, to\ndischarge the claims that society and their Maker have upon them. Upon these\nyouth must be laid grave responsibilities. The question is, Are they capable\nof governing themselves, and standing forth in the purity of their God-given\nmanhood, abhorring everything that savors of wickedness?\nNever before was there so much at stake; never were there results so\nmighty depending upon a generation as upon these now coming upon the\nstage of action. Not for one moment should the youth think that\n68\nthey can acceptably \ufb01ll any position of trust without possessing a good\ncharacter. Just as well might they expect to gather grapes of thorns, or \ufb01gs of\nthistles.\nA good character must be built up brick by brick. Those characteristics\nwhich will enable the youth to labor successfully in God\u2019s cause must\nbe obtained by the diligent exercise of their faculties, by improving every\nadvantage Providence gives them, and by connecting with the Source of all\nwisdom. They must be satis\ufb01ed with no low standard. The characters of\nJoseph and Daniel are good models for them to follow, and in the life of the\nSaviour they have a perfect pattern.\nAll are given an opportunity to develop character. All may \ufb01ll their\nappointed places in God\u2019s great plan. The Lord accepted Samuel from\nhis very childhood, because his heart was pure. He was given to God, a\nconsecrated offering, and the Lord made him a channel of light. If the youth\nof today will consecrate themselves as did Samuel, the Lord will accept them\nand use them in His work. Of their life they may be able to say with the\npsalmist, \u201cO God, Thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I\ndeclared Thy wondrous works.\u201d [Psalm 71:17.]\nThe Need of Training Workers\nThe youth must soon bear the burdens that older workers are now\ncarrying. We have lost time in neglecting to give young men a solid, practical\neducation. The cause of God is constantly progressing, and we must obey the\ncommand, Go forward. There is need of young men and women who will not\nbe swayed by\n69\ncircumstances, who walk with God, who pray much, and who put forth\nearnest efforts to gather all the light they can.\nThe worker for God should put forth the highest mental and moral\nenergies with which nature, cultivation, and the grace of God have endowed\nhim; but his success will be proportionate to the degree of consecration\nand self-sacri\ufb01ce in which his work is done, rather than to either natural or\nacquired endowments. Earnest, continuous endeavor to acquire quali\ufb01cations\nfor usefulness is necessary; but unless God works with humanity, nothing\ngood can be accomplished. Divine grace is the great element of saving power;\nwithout it all human effort is unavailing.\nWhenever the Lord has a work to be done, He calls not only for the\ncommanding of\ufb01cers, but for all the workers. Today He is calling for young\nmen and women who are strong and active in mind and body. He desires\nthem to bring into the con\ufb02ict against principalities and powers and spiritual\nwickedness in high places, their fresh, healthy powers of brain, bone, and\nmuscle. But they must have the needed preparation. Some young men are\nurging their way into the work who have no real \ufb01tness for it. They do not\nunderstand that they need to be taught before they can teach. They point to\nmen who, with little preparation, have labored with a measure of success. But\nif these men were successful, it was because they put heart and soul into the\nwork. And how much more effective their labors might have been if at the\n\ufb01rst they had received suitable training!\nThe cause of God needs ef\ufb01cient men. Education and training are rightly\nregarded as an essential\n70\npreparation for business life; and how much more essential is thorough\npreparation for the work of presenting the last message of mercy to the world.\nThis training cannot be gained by merely listening to preaching. In our\nschools our youth are to bear burdens for God. They are to receive a thorough\ntraining under experienced teachers. They should make the best possible\nuse of their time in study, and put into practice the knowledge acquired.\nHard study and hard work are required to make a successful minister or a\nsuccessful worker in any branch of God\u2019s cause. Nothing less than constant\ncultivation will develop the value of the gifts that God has bestowed for wise\nimprovement.\nA great injury is often done our young men by permitting them to begin to\npreach when they have not suf\ufb01cient knowledge of the Scriptures to present\nour faith in an intelligent manner. Some who enter the \ufb01eld are novices in the\nScriptures. In other things also they are incompetent and inef\ufb01cient. They\ncannot read the Scriptures without hesitating, mispronouncing words, and\njumbling them together in such a manner that the word of God is abused.\nThose who cannot read correctly should learn to do so, and should become\napt to teach, before they attempt to stand before the public.\nThe teachers in our schools are obliged to apply themselves closely to\nstudy, that they may be prepared to instruct others. These teachers are not\naccepted until they have passed a critical examination, and their capabilities\nto teach have been tested by competent judges. No less caution should be\nused in the examination of ministers; those who are about to enter upon the\nsacred work of teaching Bible truth to the world,\n71\nshould be carefully examined by faithful, experienced men.\nThe teaching in our schools is not to be the same as in other colleges\nand seminaries. It is not to be of an inferior order; the knowledge essential\nto prepare a people to stand in the great day of God is to be made the\nall-important theme. The students are to be \ufb01tted to serve God, not only\nin this life, but in the future life. The Lord requires that our schools shall \ufb01t\nstudents for the kingdom to which they are bound. Thus they will be prepared\nto blend in the holy, happy harmony of the redeemed....\nLet those who have been trained for service now take their places quickly\nin the Lord\u2019s work. House-to-house laborers are needed. The Lord calls\nfor decided efforts to be put forth in places where the people know nothing\nof Bible truth. Singing and praying and Bible-readings are needed in the\nhomes of the people. Now, just now, is the time to obey the commission,\n\u201cTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.\u201d\n[Matthew 28:20.] Those who do this work must have a ready knowledge\nof the Scriptures. \u201cIt is written\u201d is to be their weapon of defense. God has\ngiven us light on His word, that we may give this light to our fellow-men.\nThe truth spoken by Christ will reach hearts. A \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d will\nfall upon the ear with power, and fruit will appear wherever honest service is\ndone.\u2014 \u201cCounsels to Teachers,\u201d pages 535-540.\n72\nEducation for Missionary Work\n[First published in \u201cHistorical Sketches of S. D. A. Foreign Missions,\u201d\n1886.]\n\u201cWe are laborers together with God: ye are God\u2019s husbandry, ye are God\u2019s\nbuilding.\u201d [1 Corinthians 3:9]\nThe work of the Christian laborer is not light or unimportant. He has\na high vocation, from which his whole future life must take its mould and\ncoloring. He who gives himself to so sacred a work should bend all his\nenergies to its accomplishment. He should aim high; he will never reach\na higher standard than that which he seeks to attain. He cannot diffuse light\nuntil he has \ufb01rst received it. He must be a learner before he can have suf\ufb01cient\nwisdom and experience to become a teacher, able to open the Scriptures to\nthose who are in darkness. If God has called men to be laborers together with\nHim, it is equally certain that He has called them to make the best possible\npreparation rightly to represent the sacred, elevating truths of His word.\nThose who desire to give themselves to the work of God should receive an\neducation and training for this work, that they may be prepared to engage in it\nintelligently. They should not feel that they can step at once upon the higher\nrounds of the ladder; those who would succeed must begin at the \ufb01rst round,\nand climb upward step by step. Opportunities and privileges are granted for\nthem for improvement, and they should make every effort in their power to\nlearn how to do the work of God acceptably.\n73\nWherever our ministers labor, in Europe or in America, they should seek\nto arouse the youth to prepare for active service in God\u2019s great \ufb01eld of battle.\nAll who claim to be the servants of Christ have a work to do for Him. The\nvery name of servant conveys the idea of hire, work, responsibility. To every\none God has entrusted powers to be employed in His service. He has given\nto each his work, and He requires that every faculty shall be improved to His\nglory.\nThe Training of Soldiers\nJust in front of our printing-of\ufb01ce in Basel, Switzerland, is a large park of\nmany acres, reserved by the government for military drill. Here, day after day,\nat certain seasons of the year, we see the soldiers training. They are drilled in\nall the duties of the army, so that in case of war they may be ready at the call\nof the government to engage in actual service.\nOne day a \ufb01ne tent was brought upon the ground. Then came the\ndiscipline of pitching it and taking it down. Instruction was given as to setting\nit up in proper order, every man having his speci\ufb01c work to do. Several times\nthe tent was pitched and taken down.\nBy another company many small cannon were brought upon the ground,\nand lessons were given by the of\ufb01cers in the matter of moving these quickly\nfrom place to place, in taking apart the cannon wagon, and setting the gun\nready for use, and in quickly attaching again the fore wheels, so as to be\nready at the call to set them in motion in an instant.\nAmbulances were brought to the ground, and the sanitary corps were\ntaught to take care of the wounded.\n74\nMen were laid upon stretchers, and their heads and limbs were bandaged as\nare those of the wounded on the \ufb01eld of battle. Then they were laid in the\nambulance and drawn from the ground.\nFor hours, soldiers are drilled to disencumber themselves of their\nknapsacks, and place them quickly in position again upon the person. They\nare taught how to stack their arms, and how to seize them quickly. They are\ndrilled in making a charge against the enemy, and are trained in all kinds of\nmaneuvers.\nThus the drill goes on, preparing men for any emergency. And should\nthose who are \ufb01ghting the battle for Prince Emmanuel be less earnest and\npainstaking in their preparation for the spiritual warfare? Those who engage\nin this great work must take part in the necessary drill. They must learn to\nobey before they are \ufb01tted to command.\nFacilities for Training\nThere should be decided advancement in the matter of special preparatory\nwork. In all our conferences there should be well-organized plans for the\ninstruction and training of those who desire to give themselves to the work\nof God. Our city missions afford favorable opportunities for education in\nmissionary labor; but these are not enough. There ought to be connected with\nour schools the best possible facilities for the preparation of laborers for both\nhome and foreign \ufb01elds. There should also be in our larger churches special\ntraining-schools for young men and women, to \ufb01t them to become workers for\nGod. And far more attention should be given by our ministers to the matter\nof assisting and educating younger laborers.\n75\nWhen an effort is made to introduce the truth in an important place, our\nministers should give special attention to the instruction and training of those\nwho are to co-operate with them. Colporteurs and canvassers are needed,\nand those who are \ufb01tted to give Bible-readings in families, so that while the\nministers are laboring in word and doctrine, these can also be calling minds\nto the truth.\nOur ministers who have gone to important places to hold tent-meetings,\nhave often made a serious mistake in devoting all their time to sermonizing.\nThere should be less preaching and more teaching,\u2014teaching the people, and\nalso teaching young men how to labor successfully. Ministers should become\nef\ufb01cient in teaching others how to study the Bible, and in training the minds\nand manners of those who would become workers in the cause of God. And\nthey should be ready to counsel and instruct those who have newly come to\nthe faithful, and who give promise of possessing ability to work for the Master\nAll who would be ef\ufb01cient workers must give much time to prayer. The\ncommunication between God and the soul must be kept open, that the workers\nmay recognize the voice of their Captain. The Bible should be diligently\nstudied. The truth of God, like gold, is not always lying right on the surface;\nit is to be obtained only by earnest thought and study. This study will not\nonly store the mind with most valuable knowledge, but will strengthen and\nexpand the mental powers, and will give a true estimate of eternal things. Let\nthe divine precepts be brought into the daily life; let the life be fashioned\nafter God\u2019s great standard of righteousness, and the whole character will be\nstrengthened and ennobled.\n76\nHe who is seeking to qualify himself for the sacred work of God should\nbe careful not to place himself on the enemy\u2019s ground, but should choose the\nsociety of those who will help him to obtain divine knowledge. God suffered\nJohn, the beloved disciple, to be exiled to Patmos, where he was separated\nfrom the world\u2019s bustle and strife, shut away from every outside in\ufb02uence,\nand even from the work that he loved. Then the Lord could commune with\nhim, opening before him the closing scenes of this world\u2019s history. John\nthe Baptist made his home in the wilderness, there to receive from God the\nmessage that he was to bear,\u2014a message that was to prepare the way for the\nComing One.\nSo far as consistent, we should shun every in\ufb02uence that would tend to\ndivert the mind from the work of God. And those especially who are young\nin faith and experience should beware that they do not in self-con\ufb01dence place\nthemselves in the way of temptation.\nThose who take hold of the work aright, will feel the necessity of having\nJesus with them at every step, and they will feel that the cultivation of the\nmind and the manners is a duty due to themselves and required by God,\u2014a\nduty which is essential to the success of the work.\nSelf-Suf\ufb01ciency\nSome who contemplate becoming missionary workers may think\nthemselves so far advanced that they do not need all this particular drill;\nbut those who feel thus are the very ones who stand in the greatest need of\nthorough training. When they know much more in regard to the truth and the\nimportance of the work, they will realize their ignorance and inef\ufb01ciency.\n77\nWhen they closely examine their own hearts, they will see themselves in\nsuch contrast to the pure character of Christ that they will cry out, \u201cWho\nis suf\ufb01cient for these things?\u201d Then they will in deep humility strive daily\nto place themselves in close connection with Christ. While overcoming the\nsel\ufb01sh inclinations of the natural heart, they are placing their feet in the path\nwhere Christ leads the way. \u201cThe entrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth\nunderstanding unto the simple.\u201d [Psalm 119:130]. But those who have a high\nestimate of their own ability and acquisitions, are so full of self-importance\nthat there is no opportunity for the entrance of the word of God to instruct and\nenlighten them.\nMany feel that they are \ufb01tted for a work that they know scarcely anything\nabout; and if they start to labor in a self-important manner, they will fail to\nreceive that knowledge which they must obtain in the school of Christ. These\nwill be doomed to struggle with many dif\ufb01culties, for which they are wholly\nunprepared. They will ever lack experience and wisdom until they learn their\ngreat inef\ufb01ciency.\nVery much has been lost to the cause by the defective labors of men who\npossess ability, but who have not had proper training. They have engaged\nin a work which they knew not how to manage, and as the result have\naccomplished but little. They have not done a tithe of what they could have\ndone had they received the right discipline at the start. They seized upon a few\nideas, managed to get a runway of a few discourses, and here their progress\nended. They felt competent to be teachers, when they had scarcely mastered\ntheir a b cin the knowledge of the truth. The have been stumbling along ever\nsince, not\n78\ndoing justice to themselves or to the work. They do not seem to have\nsuf\ufb01cient interest to arouse their dormant energies, or to tax their powers to\nbecome ef\ufb01cient workers. They have not taken pains to form thorough and\nwell-devised plans, and their work shows de\ufb01ciency in every part.\nSome have given up in discouragement, and have engaged in other\nemployment. Had these patiently and humbly placed their feet on the lowest\nround of the ladder, and then with persevering energy climbed step by step,\ndiligently improving the privileges and opportunities within their reach, they\nmight have become able, useful workmen, who could give full proof of their\nministry, and of whom the Master would not be ashamed.\nIf those who propose to work for the salvation of souls depend on their\nown \ufb01nite wisdom, they will certainly fail. If they entertain humble views of\nself, and rely fully upon the promises of God, He will never fail them. \u201cTrust\nin the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.\nIn all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths.\u201d [Proverbs\n3:5, 6] We have the privilege of being directed by a wise Counselor.\nGod can make humble men mighty in His service. Those who obediently\nrespond to the call of duty, improving their abilities to the very utmost, may\nbe sure of receiving divine assistance. Angels will come as messengers of\nlight to the help of those who will do all that they can on their part, and then\ntrust in God to co-operate with their efforts.\nIt should be impressed on all who have decided to become workers for\nGod, that they must give evidence\n79\nthat they are converted men. A young man without a sound, virtuous character\nwill be no honor to the truth. Every worker should be pure in heart; in\nhis mouth should be found no guile. He should bear in mind that, to be\nsuccessful, he must have Christ by his side, and that every sinful practice,\nhowever secret is open to the view of Him with whom we have to do.\nSin has marred the divine image in man. Through Christ this may be\nrestored, but it is only through earnest prayer and the conquest of self that we\ncan become partakers of the divine nature\nThe true toilers in the Lord\u2019s vineyard will be men of prayer, of faith,\nof self-denial.\u2014men who hold in restraint the natural appetites and passions.\nThese will in their own lives give evidence of the power of the truth which\nthey present to others; and their labors will not be without effect. *****\nThe worker for God should be prepared to put forth the highest mental\nand moral energies with which nature, cultivation, and the grace of God\nhave endowed him; but his success will be proportionate to the degree of\nconsecration and self-sacri\ufb01ce in which the work is done, rather than to either\nnatural or acquired endowments. The most earnest and continued efforts to\nacquire quali\ufb01cations for usefulness are necessary; but unless God works\nwith the human effort, nothing can be accomplished. Christ says, \u201cWithout\nMe ye can do nothing.\u201d [John 15:5.] Divine grace is the great element of\nsaving power; without it all human efforts are unavailing.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church5:583.\n80\nYoung Men as Missionaries\nYoung men who desire to enter the \ufb01eld as ministers, colporteurs, or\ncanvassers, should \ufb01rst receive a suitable degree of mental training, as\nwell as a special preparation for their calling. Those who are uneducated,\nuntrained, and unre\ufb01ned, are not prepared to enter a \ufb01eld in which the\npowerful in\ufb02uences of talent and education combat the truths of God\u2019s word.\nNeither can they successfully meet the strange forms of error, religious and\nphilosophical combined, to expose which requires a knowledge of scienti\ufb01c\nas well as Scriptural truth.\nThose especially who have the ministry in view, should feel the\nimportance of the Scriptural method of ministerial training. They should enter\nheartily into the work, and while they study in the schools, they should learn\nof the great Teacher the meekness and humility of Christ. A covenant-keeping\nGod has promised that in answer to prayer His Spirit shall be poured out\nupon these learners in the school of Christ, that they may become ministers\nof righteousness.\nThere is hard work to be done in dislodging error and false doctrine from\nthe head, that Bible truth and Bible religion may \ufb01nd a place in the heart.\nIt was as a means ordained of God to educate young men and women for\nthe various departments of missionary labor, that colleges were established\namong us. It is God\u2019s will that they send forth not merely a few, but many\nlaborers. But Satan, determined to overthrow this purpose, has often secured\nthe very ones whom God would qualify for places of usefulness in His work.\n81\nThere are many who would work if urged into service, and who would save\ntheir souls by thus working. The church should feel her great responsibility\nin shutting up the light of truth, and restraining the grace of God within her\nown narrow limits, when money and in\ufb02uence should be freely employed in\nbringing competent persons into the missionary \ufb01eld.\nHundreds of young men should have been preparing to act a part in\nthe work of scattering the seeds of truth beside all waters. We want men\nwho will push the triumphs of the cross; men who will persevere under\ndiscouragements and privations; who will have the zeal and resolution and\nfaith that are indispensable in the missionary \ufb01eld....\nForeign Languages\nThere are among us those who, without the toil and delay of learning\na foreign language, might qualify themselves to proclaim the truth to other\nnations. In the primitive church, missionaries were miraculously endowed\nwith a knowledge of the languages in which they were called to preach the\nunsearchable riches of Christ. And if God was willing thus to help His\nservants then, can we doubt that His blessing will rest upon our efforts to\nqualify those who naturally possess a knowledge of foreign tongues, and who,\nwith proper encouragement, would bear to their own countrymen the message\nof truth? We might have had more laborers in foreign missionary \ufb01elds, had\nthose who entered these \ufb01elds availed themselves of every talent within their\nreach....\nIt may in some cases be necessary that young men learn foreign\nlanguages. This they can do with most success by associating with the people,\nand at the\n82\nsame time devoting a portion of each day to studying the language. This\nshould be done, however, only as a necessary step preparatory to educating\nsuch as are found in the missionary \ufb01elds themselves, and who, with proper\ntraining, can become workers. It is essential that those be urged into the\nservice who can speak in their mother tongue to the people of different\nnations.\nIt is a great undertaking for a man of middle age to learn a foreign\nlanguage; and with all his efforts, it will be next to impossible for him to\nspeak it so readily and correctly as to render him an ef\ufb01cient laborer. We\ncannot afford to deprive our home missions of the in\ufb02uence of middle-aged\nand aged ministers, to send them into distant \ufb01elds to engage in a work for\nwhich they are not quali\ufb01ed, and to which no amount of training will enable\nthem to adapt themselves. The men thus sent out leave vacancies which\ninexperienced laborers cannot supply.\nYoung Men Wanted for Hard Places\nThe church may inquire whether young men can be entrusted with the\ngrave responsibilities involved in the establishing and superintending of a\nforeign mission. I answer, God designed that they should be so trained in\nour colleges and by association in labor with men of experience, that they\nwould be prepared for places of usefulness in this cause.\nWe must manifest con\ufb01dence in our young men. They should be pioneers\nin every enterprise involving toil and sacri\ufb01ce, while the overtaxed servants\nof Christ should be cherished as counselors, to encourage and bless those who\nstrike the heaviest blows for God. Providence thrust these experienced fathers\ninto\n83\ntrying, responsible positions at an early age, when neither physical nor\nintellectual powers were fully developed. The magnitude of the trust\ncommitted to them aroused their energies, and their active labor in the work\naided both physical and mental development.\nYoung men are wanted. God calls them to missionary \ufb01elds. Being\ncomparatively free from care and responsibilities, they are more favorably\nsituated to engage in the work than are those who must provide for the training\nand support of a large family. Furthermore, young men can more readily\nadapt themselves to new climates and new society, and can better endure\ninconveniences and hardships. By tact and perseverance, they can reach the\npeople where they are.\nStrength comes by exercise. All who put to use the ability which God\nhas given them, will have increased ability to devote to His service. Those\nwho do nothing in the cause of God, will fail to grow in grace and in the\nknowledge of the truth. A man who would lie down and refuse to exercise his\nlimbs, would soon lose all power to use them. Thus the Christian who will\nnot exercise his God-given powers, not only fails to grow up into Christ, but\nhe loses the strength which he already had; he becomes a spiritual paralytic.\nIt is those who, with love for God and their fellowmen, are striving to help\nothers, that become established, strengthened, settled, in the truth. The true\nChristian works for God, not from impulse, but from principle; not for a day\nor a month, but during the entire life....\nThe Master calls for gospel workers. Who will respond? Not all who\nenter the army are to be generals,\n84\ncaptains, sergeants, or even corporals. Not all have the care and responsibility\nof leaders. There is hard work of other kinds to be done. Some must dig\ntrenches and build forti\ufb01cations; some are to stand as sentinels, some to carry\nmessages. While there are but few of\ufb01cers, it requires many soldiers to form\nthe rank and \ufb01le of the army; yet its success depends upon the \ufb01delity of every\nsoldier. One man\u2019s cowardice or treachery may bring disaster upon the entire\narmy....\nHe who has appointed \u201cto every man his work,\u201d [Mark 13:34.] according\nto his ability, will never let the faithful performance of duty go unrewarded.\nEvery act of loyalty and faith will be crowned with special tokens of God\u2019s\nfavor and approbation. To every worker is given the promise, \u201cHe that goeth\nforth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with\nrejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\u201d [Psalm 126:6.]\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church5:390-395. *****\nMany a lad of today, growing up as did Daniel in his Judean home,\nstudying God\u2019s word and His works, and learning the lessons of faithful\nservice, will yet stand in legislative assemblies, in halls of justice, or in royal\ncourts, as a witness for the King of Kings. Multitudes will be called to a wider\nministry. The whole world is opening to the gospel. Ethiopia is stretching out\nher hands unto God. From Japan and China and India, from the still darkened\nlands of our own continent, from every quarter of this world of ours, comes\nthe cry of sin-stricken hearts for a knowledge of the God of love.\u2014Education,\n262.\n85\nVoice Training for Workers\nIn all our ministerial work, more attention should be given to the culture\nof the voice. We may have knowledge, but unless we know how to use the\nvoice correctly, our work will be a failure. Unless we can clothe our ideas\nin appropriate language, of what avail is our education? Knowledge will be\nof little advantage to us unless we cultivate the talent of speech; but it is\na wonderful power when combined with the ability to speak wise, helpful\nwords, and to speak them in a way that will command attention.\nStudents who expect to become workers in the cause of God should be\ntrained to speak in a clear, straightforward manner, else they will be shorn\nof half their in\ufb02uence for good. The ability to speak plainly and clearly,\nin full, round tones, is invaluable in any line of work. This quali\ufb01cation\nis indispensable in those who desire to become ministers, evangelists,\nBible-workers, or canvassers. Those who are planning to enter these lines\nof work should be taught to use the voice in such a way that when they speak\nto people about the truth, a decided impression for good will be made. The\ntruth must not be marred by being communicated through defective utterance.\nThe canvasser who can speak clearly and distinctly about the merits of the\nbook he wishes to sell, will \ufb01nd this a great help in his work. He may have an\nopportunity to read a chapter of the book, and by the music of his voice and\nthe emphasis placed on the words, he can make the scene presented stand out\nas clearly\n86\nbefore the mind of the listener as if it could actually be seen.\nThe one who gives Bible-readings in the congregation or in the family\nshould be able to read with a soft, musical cadence which will charm the\nhearers.\nMinisters of the gospel should know how to speak with power and\nexpression, making the words of eternal life so expressive and impressive that\nthe hearers cannot but feel their weight. I am pained as I hear the defective\nvoices of many of our ministers. Such ministers rob God of the glory He\nmight have if they had trained themselves to speak the word with power.\nOvercoming Defects\nNo man should regard himself as quali\ufb01ed to enter the ministry until\nby persevering effort he has overcome every defect in his utterance. If he\nattempts to speak to the people without knowing how to use the talent of\nspeech, half his in\ufb02uence is lost, for he has little power to hold the attention\nof a congregation.\nWhatever his calling, every person should learn to control the voice, so\nthat when something goes wrong, he will not speak in tones that stir the worst\npassions of the heart. Too often the speaker and the one addressed speak\nsharply and harshly. Sharp, dictatorial words, uttered in hard, rasping tones,\nhave separated friends and resulted in the loss of souls....\nIn the social meeting there is special need of clear, distinct utterance, that\nall may hear the testimonies borne and be bene\ufb01ted by them. Dif\ufb01culties\nare removed and help is given as in social meeting God\u2019s people relate their\nexperiences. But too often the testimonies are borne with faulty, indistinct\nutterance,\n87\nand it is impossible to gain a correct idea of what is said. Thus the blessing is\noften lost.\nLet those who pray and those who speak pronounce their words properly,\nand speak in clear, distinct, even tones. Prayer, if properly offered, is a power\nfor good. It is one of the means used by the Lord to communicate to the\npeople the precious treasures of truth. But prayer is not what it should be,\nbecause of the defective voices of those who utter it. Satan rejoices when the\nprayers offered to God are almost inaudible.\nLet God\u2019s people learn how to speak and pray in a way that will properly\nrepresent the great truths they possess. Let the testimonies borne and the\nprayers offered be clear and distinct. Thus God will be glori\ufb01ed. Let all make\nthe most of the talent of speech.\nGod calls for a higher, more perfect ministry. He is dishonored by the\nimperfect utterance of the one who by painstaking effort could become an\nacceptable mouthpiece for Him. The truth is too often marred by the channel\nthrough which it passes.\nThe Lord calls upon all who are connected with His service to give\nattention to the cultivation of the voice, that they may utter in an acceptable\nmanner the great and solemn truths He has entrusted to them. Let none mar\nthe truth by defective utterance. Let not those who have neglected to cultivate\nthe talent of speech suppose that they are quali\ufb01ed to minister; for they have\nyet to obtain the power to communicate.\nDistinct Enunciation\nWhen you speak, let every word be full and well rounded, every sentence\nclear and distinct, to the very\n88\nlast word. Many as they approach the end of a sentence lower the tone of\nthe voice, speaking so indistinctly that the force of the thought is destroyed.\nWords that are worth speaking at all are worth speaking in a clear, distinct\nvoice, with emphasis and expression. But never search for words that will\ngive the impression that you are learned. The greater your simplicity, the\nbetter will your words be understood.\nYoung men and women, has God placed in your hearts a desire to do\nservice for Him? Then by all means cultivate the voice to the utmost of your\nability, so that you can make plain the precious truth to others. Do not fall\ninto the habit of praying so indistinctly and in so low a tone that your prayers\nneed an interpreter. Pray simply, but clearly and distinctly. To let the voice\nsink so low that it cannot be heard, is no evidence of humility.\nTo those who are planning to enter God\u2019s service as ministers, I would\nsay, Strive with determination to be perfect in speech. Ask God to help you\nto accomplish this great object. When in the congregation you offer prayer,\nremember that you are addressing God, and that He desires you to speak\nso that all who are present can hear and can blend their supplications with\nyours. A prayer uttered so hurriedly that the words are jumbled together, is\nno honor to God and does the hearers no good. Let ministers and all who\noffer public prayer learn to pray in such a way that God will be glori\ufb01ed and\nthe hearers will be blessed. Let them speak slowly and distinctly, and in tones\nloud enough to be heard by all, so that the people may\n89\nunite in saying Amen.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:380-383. *****\nSome of our most talented ministers are doing themselves great injury by\ntheir defective manner of speaking. While teaching the people their duty\nto obey God\u2019s moral law, they should not be found violating the laws of\nGod in regard to health and life. Ministers should stand erect, and speak\nslowly, \ufb01rmly, and distinctly, taking a full inspiration of air at every sentence,\nand throwing out the words by exercising the abdominal muscles. If they\nwill observe this simple rule, giving attention to the laws of health in other\nrespects, they may preserve their life and usefulness much longer than men\nin any other profession. The chest will become broader, and ...the speaker\nneed seldom become hoarse, even by constant speaking. Instead of becoming\nconsumptives, ministers may, by exercising care, overcome all tendency to\nconsumption.\nUnless ministers educate themselves to speak in accordance with physical\nlaw, they will sacri\ufb01ce life, and many will mourn the loss of \u201cthose martyrs\nto the cause of truth;\u201d when the facts in the case are, that by indulging in\nwrong habits, they did injustice to themselves and to the truth which they\nrepresented, and robbed God and the world of the service they might have\nrendered. God would have been pleased to have them live, but they slowly\ncommitted suicide.\nThe manner in which the truth is presented often has much to do in\ndetermining whether it will be accepted or rejected. All who labor in the\ngreat cause of reform should study to become ef\ufb01cient workmen, that they\nmay accomplish the greatest possible amount of\n90\ngood, and not detract from the force of the truth by their own de\ufb01ciencies.\nMinisters and teachers should discipline themselves to articulate clearly\nand distinctly, allowing the full sound to every word. Those who talk rapidly,\nfrom the throat, jumbling the words together, and raising the voice to an\nunnaturally high pitch, soon become hoarse, and the words spoken lose half\nthe force which they would have if spoken slowly, distinctly, and not so loud.\nThey sympathies of the hearers are awakened for the speaker; for they know\nthat he is doing violence to himself, and they fear that he will break down at\nany moment. It is no evidence that a man has zeal for God because he works\nhimself up into a frenzy of excitement and gesticulation. \u201cBodily exercise,\u201d\nsays the apostle, \u201cpro\ufb01teth little.\u201d [1 Timothy 4:8.]\nThe Saviour of the world would have His co-laborers represent Him; and\nthe more closely a man walks with God, the more faultless will be his manner\nof address, his deportment, his attitude, and his gestures. Coarse and uncouth\nmanners were never seen in our pattern, Christ Jesus. He was a representative\nof heaven, and His followers must be like Him.\nSome reason that the Lord will by His Holy Spirit qualify a man to speak\nas He would have him; but the Lord does not propose to do the work that He\nhas given man to do. He has given us reasoning powers, and opportunities\nto educate the mind and manners. And after we have done all we can for\nourselves, making the best use of the advantages within our reach, then we\nmay look to God with earnest prayer to do by His Spirit that which we cannot\ndo for ourselves.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:404, 405.\n91\n\u201cStudy to Show Thyself Approved\u201d\nThe cause of God needs ef\ufb01cient men; it needs men who are trained to\ndo service as teachers and preachers. Men have labored with a measure of\nsuccess who have had little training in school or college; but these might have\nattained a greater measure of success, and might have been more ef\ufb01cient\nlaborers, if at the very start they had acquired mental discipline.\nTo Timothy, a youthful minister, the apostle Paul wrote, \u201cStudy to show\nthyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly\ndividing the word of truth.\u201d [2 Timothy 2:15.] The work of winning souls\nto Christ demands careful preparation. Men cannot enter the Lord\u2019s service\nwithout the needed training, and expect the highest success. Mechanics,\nlawyers, merchants, men of all trades and professions, are educated for the\nline of business they hope to enter. It is their policy to make themselves as\nef\ufb01cient as possible. Go to the milliner or the dressmaker, and she will tell\nyou how long she toiled before she had a thorough knowledge of her business.\nThe architect will tell you how long it took him to understand how to plan a\ntasteful, commodious building. And so it is in all the callings that men follow.\nShould the servants of Christ show less diligence in preparing for a work\nin\ufb01nitely more important? Should they be ignorant of the ways and means\nto be employed in winning souls? It requires a knowledge of human nature,\nclose study, careful thought, and earnest prayer, to know how to approach\nmen and women on the great subjects that concern their eternal welfare.\n92\nNot a few of those called to be co-laborers with the Master have failed to\nlearn their trade. They have dishonored their Redeemer by entering His work\nwithout the needed preparation. There are some who, becoming wearied by\nthe super\ufb01cial gloss that the world calls re\ufb01nement, have gone to the other\nextreme, and one fully as harmful. They refuse to receive the polish and\nre\ufb01nement that Christ desires His children to possess. The minister should\nremember that he is an educator, and that if in manner and speech he is coarse\nand unre\ufb01ned, those who have less knowledge and experience will follow in\nhis steps.\nSuper\ufb01cial Knowledge\nNever should a young minister rest satis\ufb01ed with a super\ufb01cial knowledge\nof the truth, for he knows not where he may be required to bear witness\nfor God. Many will have to stand before Kings and before the learned\nof the earth, to answer for their faith. Those who have only a super\ufb01cial\nunderstanding of the truth have failed to become workmen that need not be\nashamed. They will be confused, and will not be able clearly to expound the\nScriptures.\nIt is a lamentable fact that the advancement of the cause is hindered by\nthe dearth of educated laborers. Many are wanting in moral and intellectual\nquali\ufb01cations. They do not tax the mind, they do not dig for the hidden\ntreasure. Because they only skim the surface, they gain only that knowledge\nwhich is to be found upon the surface.\nDo men think that they will be able, under pressure of circumstances,\nto step into an important position, when they have neglected to train and\ndiscipline\n93\nthemselves for the work? Do they imagine that they can be polished\ninstruments in the hands of God for the salvation of souls, if they have\nnot used the opportunities placed at their command for obtaining a \ufb01tness\nfor the work? The cause of God calls for all-round men, who can devise,\nplan, build up, and organize. And those who appreciate the probabilities and\npossibilities of the work for this time, will seek by earnest study to obtain\nall the knowledge they can from the Word, to use in ministering to needy,\nsin-sick souls.\nA minister should never think that he has learned enough, and may now\nrelax his efforts. His education should continue throughout his lifetime; every\nday he should be learning, and putting to use the knowledge gained.\nLet those who are in training for the ministry never forget that the\npreparation of the heart is of all the most important. No amount of mental\nculture or theological training can take the place of this. The bright beams of\nthe Sun of Righteousness must shine into the heart of the worker and purify\nhis life, before light from the throne of God can shine through him to those in\ndarkness. *****\nDuring the night many scenes passed before men, and many points in\nreference to the work that we are to do for our Master, the Lord Jesus Christ,\nwere made plain and clear. Words were spoken by One of authority, and I\nwill try to repeat in \ufb01nite words the instruction given regarding the work to\nbe done. The heavenly Messenger said:\nThe ministry is becoming enfeebled because men are assuming the\nresponsibility of preaching without\n94\ngaining the needed preparation for this work. Many have made a mistake in\nreceiving credentials. They will have to take up work to which they are better\nadapted than the preaching of the word. They are being paid from the tithe,\nbut their efforts are feeble, and they should not continue to be paid from this\nfund. In many ways the ministry is losing its sacred character.\nThose who are called to the ministry of the word are to be true,\nself-sacri\ufb01cing laborers. God calls for men who realize that they must put\nforth earnest effort, men who bring thought, zeal, prudence, capability, and\nthe attributes of Christ\u2019s character into their labors. The saving of souls is a\nvast work, which calls for the employment of every talent, every gift of grace.\nThose engaged in it should constantly increase in ef\ufb01ciency. They should\nhave an earnest desire to strengthen their powers, knowing that they will be\nweak without a constantly increasing supply of grace. They should seek to\nattain larger and still larger results in their work. When this is the experience\nof our workers, fruit will be seen. Many souls will be won to the truth. *****\nHigher than the highest human thought can reach is God\u2019s ideal for His\nchildren. Godliness\u2014Godlikeness\u2014is the goal to be reached. Before the\nstudent here is opened a path of continual progress. He has an object to\nachieve, a standard to attain, that includes everything good, and pure, and\nnoble. He will advance as fast and as far as possible in every branch of true\nknowledge.\u2014 Education, 18.\n95\nCanvassing as an Education For the\nMinistry\nOne of the very best ways in which young men can obtain a \ufb01tness for the\nministry is by entering the canvassing \ufb01eld. Let them go into towns and cities\nto canvass for the books which contain the truth for this time. In this work\nthey will \ufb01nd opportunity to speak the words of life, and the seeds of truth\nthey sow will spring up to bear fruit. By meeting the people and presenting to\nthem our publications, they will gain an experience that they could not gain\nby preaching.\nWhen young men enter the canvassing \ufb01eld \ufb01lled with an intense longing\nto save their fellow-men, a harvest for the Lord will be reaped as a result of\ntheir efforts. Then let them go forth as missionaries, to proclaim present\ntruth, praying constantly for increased light, and for the guidance of the\nSpirit, that they may know how to speak words in season to those who are\nweary. Let them improve every opportunity for performing deeds of kindness,\nremembering that they are doing errands for the Lord. *****\nAll who desire an opportunity for true ministry, and who will give\nthemselves unreservedly to God, will \ufb01nd in the canvassing work opportunity\nto speak upon many things pertaining to the future immortal life. The\nexperience thus gained will be of the greatest value to those who are \ufb01tting\nthemselves for the ministry.\nIt is the accompaniment of the Holy Spirit of God that prepares workers,\nboth men and women, to\n96\nbecome pastors to the \ufb02ock of God. As they cherish the thought that Christ\nis their companion, a holy awe, a sacred joy, will be felt by them amid all\ntheir trying experiences and all their tests. They will learn to pray as they\nwork. They will be educated in patience, kindness, affability, and helpfulness.\nThey will practice true Christian courtesy, bearing in mind that Christ, their\ncompanion, cannot approve of harsh, unkind words or feelings. Their words\nwill be puri\ufb01ed. The power of speech will be regarded as a precious talent,\nlent them to do a high and holy work.\nThe human agent will learn how to represent the divine Companion with\nwhom he is associated. To that unseen Holy One he will show respect\nand reverence, because he is wearing His yoke and is learning His pure,\nholy ways. Those who have faith in this divine Attendant will develop.\nThey will be gifted with power to clothe the message of truth with a sacred\nbeauty.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:322. *****\nFollow on, young men, to know the Lord, and you will know that \u201cHis\ngoing forth is prepared as the morning.\u201d [Hosea 6:3.] Seek constantly to\nimprove. Strive earnestly for close fellowship with the Redeemer. Live by\nfaith in Christ. Do the work He did. Live for the saving of the souls for whom\nHe laid down His life. Try in every way to help those with whom you come\nin contact Talk with your Elder Brother, who will complete your education\nline upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. A close\nconnection with Him who offered Himself as a sacri\ufb01ce to save a perishing\nworld, will make you acceptable workers.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:416.\n97\nBible Study Necessary to Ef\ufb01ciency\nThose young men who desire to give themselves to the ministry, or who\nhave already done so, should become familiar with every line of prophetic\nhistory and every lesson given by Christ. The mind gains in strength, breadth,\nand acuteness by active use. It must work, or it will become weak. It must\nbe trained to think, to think habitually, or it will in a great measure lose the\npower of thought. Let the young minister wrestle with the dif\ufb01cult problems\nfound in the word of God, and his intellect will be thoroughly awakened. As\nhe gives diligent study to the great truths found in the Scriptures, he will be\nenabled to preach sermons which will contain a direct, de\ufb01nite message, and\nwhich will help his hearers to choose the right way.\nThe minister who ventures to teach the truth when he has only a\nsmattering knowledge of the word of God, grieves the Holy Spirit. But he\nwho begins with a little knowledge, and tells what he knows, at the same time\nseeking for more knowledge, will become quali\ufb01ed to do a larger work. The\nmore light he gathers to his own soul, the more of heavenly illumination will\nhe be able to impart to others.\nThere is no need for weakness in the ministry. The message of truth that\nwe bear is all-powerful. But many ministers do not put their minds to the\ntask of studying the deep things of God. If these would have power in their\nservice, obtaining an experience that will enable them to help others, they\nmust overcome their indolent habits of thought. Let ministers put the\n98\nwhole heart into the task of searching the Scriptures, and a new power will\ncome to them. A divine element unites with human effort when the soul\nreaches out after God; and the yearning heart may say, \u201cMy soul, wait thou\nonly upon God; for my expectation is from Him.\u201d [Psalm 62:5.]\nMinisters who would labor effectively for the salvation of souls must be\nBible students and men of prayer. It is a sin to be neglectful of the study of\nthe Word while attempting to teach it to others. Those who feel the worth of\nsouls realize that too much is at stake for them to dare to be careless in regard\nto their advancement in divine knowledge, and they \ufb02ee to the stronghold of\ntruth, whence they may obtain wisdom, knowledge, and strength to work the\nworks of God. They will not rest without an unction from on high.\nAs the worker makes a constant companion of the word of God, he\ngains an increased ability to labor. Continually advancing in knowledge, he\nbecomes constantly better able to represent Christ. He is strengthened in faith,\nand can present to unbelievers a proof of the fulness of the grace and love that\nis in Christ. His mind is a treasure-house, from which the can draw to supply\nthe needs of others. By the work of the Holy Spirit the truth is graven on\nhis mind, and those to whom he communicates truth, and for whom he must\none day give account, are greatly blessed. He who in this way obtains a\npreparation for the ministry, is entitled to the reward promised to those who\nturn many to righteousness.\nThe perusal of works upon our faith, the reading of arguments from the\npens of others, is an excellent and important aid, but this will not give the\nmind the greatest\n99\nstrength. The Bible is the best book in the world for giving intellectual\nculture. Its study taxes the mind, strengthens the memory, and sharpens\nthe intellect more than the study of all the subjects that human philosophy\nembraces. The great themes which it presents, the digni\ufb01ed simplicity with\nwhich these themes are handled, the light which is shed upon the great\nproblems of life, bring strength and vigor to the understanding.\nIn the great con\ufb02ict before us, he who would keep true to Christ must\npenetrate deeper than the opinions and doctrines of men. My message to\nministers, young and old, is this: Guard jealously your hours for prayer, Bible\nstudy, and self-examination. Set aside a portion of each day for a study of the\nScriptures and communion with God. Thus you will obtain spiritual strength,\nand will grow in favor with God. He alone can give you noble aspirations; He\nalone can fashion the character after the divine similitude. Draw near to Him\nin earnest prayer, and He will \ufb01ll your hearts with high and holy purposes,\nand with deep, earnest longings for purity and clearness of thought. *****\nA true knowledge of the Bible can be gained only through the aid of that\nSpirit by whom the Word was given. And in order to gain this knowledge,\nwe must live by it. All that God\u2019s word commands, we are to obey. All that\nit promises, we may claim. The life which it enjoins is the life that, through\nits power, we are to live. Only as the Bible is thus held, can it be studied\neffectively.\u2014 Education, 189.\n100\nYoung Ministers to Labor with Older\nMinisters\nIn gaining a preparation for the ministry, young men should be associated\nwith older ministers. Those who have gained an experience in active service\nare to take young, inexperienced workers with them into the harvest-\ufb01eld,\nteaching them how to labor successfully for the conversion of souls. Kindly\nand affectionately these older workers are to help the younger ones to prepare\nfor the work to which the Lord may call them. And the young men in training\nshould respect the counsel of their instructors, honoring their devotion, and\nremembering that their years of labor have given them wisdom.\nWise counsel for church and conference of\ufb01cers is given by Peter in the\nfollowing words: \u201cFeed the \ufb02ock of God which is among you, taking the\noversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for \ufb01lthy lucre, but of a\nready mind; neither as being lords over God\u2019s heritage, but being ensamples\nto the \ufb02ock. And when the Chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a\ncrown of glory that fadeth not away. Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves\nunto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with\nhumility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.\u201d [1\nPeter 5:2-5.]\nLet the older workers be educators, keeping themselves under the\ndiscipline of God. Let the young men feel it a privilege to study under older\nworkers, and let them carry every burden that their youth and experience\n101\nwill allow. Thus Elijah educated the youth of Israel in the schools of the\nprophets; and young men today are to have a similar training. It is not possible\nto advise in every particular the part that the youth should act; but they should\nbe faithfully instructed by the older workers, and taught to look ever to Him\nwho is the author and \ufb01nisher of our faith.\nThe apostle Paul saw the importance of training younger workers. After\nmaking a missionary tour, he and Barnabas retraced their steps, and visited\nthe churches they had raised up, choosing men whom they could unite with\nthem, to train for the work of proclaiming the gospel.\nPaul made it a part of his work to educate young men for the gospel\nministry. He took them with him on his missionary journeys, and thus they\ngained an experience that later enabled them to \ufb01ll positions of responsibility.\nWhen separated from them, he still kept in touch with their work, and his\nletters to Timothy and Titus are an evidence of how deep was his desire for\ntheir success. \u201cThe things that thou hast heard,\u201d he wrote, \u201ccommit thou to\nfaithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.\u201d [2 Timothy 2:2.]\nThis feature of Paul\u2019s work teaches an important lesson to ministers today.\nExperienced laborers do a noble work when, instead of trying to carry all\nthe burdens themselves, they train younger men, and place burdens on their\nshoulders. It is God\u2019s desire that those who have gained an experience in His\ncause, shall train young men for His service.\nThe younger worker must not become so wrapped up in the ideas and\nopinions of the one in whose charge he is placed, that he will forfeit his\nindividuality. He\n102\nmust not lose his identity in the one who is instructing him, so that he dare\nnot exercise his own judgment, but does what he is told, irrespective of his\nown understanding of what is right and wrong. It is his privilege to learn for\nhimself of the great Teacher. If the one with whom he is working pursues a\ncourse which is not in harmony with a \u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d let him not go to\nsome outside party, but let him go to his superior in of\ufb01ce, and lay the matter\nbefore him, freely expressing his mind. Thus the learner may be a blessing\nto the teacher. He must faithfully discharge his duty. God will not hold him\nguiltless if he connives at a wrong course of action, however great may be the\nin\ufb02uence or responsibility of the one taking the wrong course.\nYoung men will be bidden to link up with the aged standard-bearers, that\nthey may be strengthened and taught by these faithful ones, who have passed\nthrough so many con\ufb02icts, and to whom, through the testimonies of His Spirit,\nGod has so often spoken, pointing out the right way and condemning the\nwrong. When perils arise which try the faith of God\u2019s people, these pioneer\nworkers are to recount the experiences of the past, when in just such crises the\ntruth was questioned, and strange sentiments, proceeding not from God, were\nbrought in. Today Satan is seeking opportunities to tear down the waymarks\nof truth,\u2014the monuments that have been raised up along the way; and we\nneed the experience of the aged workers who have built their house upon the\nsolid rock, who through evil report as well as good report have been steadfast\nto the truth.\n103\nThe Young Minister\nYoung men are to enter the ministry as co-workers with Jesus, sharing His\nlife of self-denial and sacri\ufb01ce, voicing the words of the Master, \u201cI sanctify\nMyself, that they also might be sancti\ufb01ed.\u201d [John 17:19.] If they will yield\nthemselves to God, He will use them in helping to carry out His plan for the\nsalvation of souls. Let the young man who has entered the ministry look his\ncalling fairly in the face, and determine to devote his time, his strength, his\nin\ufb02uence, to the work, well aware of the conditions under which he serves the\nRedeemer.\nThe standard-bearers are falling, and young men must be prepared to\ntake the places left vacant, that the message may still be proclaimed. The\naggressive warfare is to be extended. Those who have youth and strength are\nto go into the dark places of the earth, to call perishing souls to repentance.\nBut they must \ufb01rst cleanse the soul-temple of all impurity, and enthrone Christ\nin the heart.\n\u201cTake Heed\u201d\nTo every young man who enters the ministry, Paul\u2019s words to Timothy\nare spoken, \u201cTake heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine.\u201d [1 Timothy\n4:16.] \u201cThyself\u201d needs the \ufb01rst attention. First give yourself to the Lord for\npuri\ufb01cation and sancti\ufb01cation. A godly example will tell more for the truth\nthan the greatest eloquence, unaccompanied by a well-ordered life. Trim the\nlamp of the soul, and replenish it with the oil of the Spirit.\n104\nSeek from Christ that grace, that clearness of comprehension, which will\nenable you to do successful work. Learn from Him what it means to work\nfor those for whom He gave His life.\n\u201cTake heed,\u201d \ufb01rst to yourself, and then to the doctrine. Do not let your\nheart become hardened by sin. Closely examine your manners and habits.\nCompare them with the word of God, and then cut away from the life every\nwrong habit and indulgence. Kneel before God, and plead with Him for an\nunderstanding of His word. Be sure that you know the real principles of the\ntruth; and then when you meet opponents, it will not be in your own strength;\nand angel of God will stand by your side, to help in answering every question\nthat may be asked. Day by day you are to be shut in, as it were, with Jesus;\nand then your words and example will have a strong in\ufb02uence for good.\nNo Excuse for Ignorance\nSome who enter the ministry do not feel the burden of the work. They\nhave false ideas of the quali\ufb01cations of a minister. They think that it requires\nlittle close study of the sciences or of the word of God in order to gain a\n\ufb01tness for the ministry. Some who are teaching present truth are so de\ufb01cient\nin Bible knowledge that it is dif\ufb01cult for them to quote a text of Scripture\ncorrectly from memory. By blundering along in the awkward manner that\nthey do, they sin against God. They wrest the Scriptures, and make the Bible\nsay things that are not written therein.\nSome think that an education or a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures\nis of little consequence if only a man has the Spirit. But God never sends His\nSpirit\n105\nto sanction ignorance. He may and does pity and bless those who are so\nsituated that it is impossible for them to obtain an education; and sometimes\nHe condescends to make His strength perfect in their weakness. But it is the\nduty of such to study His word. A lack of knowledge in the sciences is no\nexcuse for a neglect of Bible study; for the words of inspiration are so plain\nthat the unlearned may understand them.\nRepaying Hospitality\nYoung ministers should make themselves useful wherever they are. When\nvisiting people in their homes, they should not be idle, making no effort\nto help those whose hospitality they share. Obligations are mutual; if the\nminister shares the hospitality of his friends, it is his duty to respond to their\nkindness by thoughtfulness and consideration in his conduct toward them.\nThe entertainer may be a man of care and hard labor. By manifesting a\ndisposition, not only to wait upon himself, but to render timely assistance\nto others, the minister may often \ufb01nd access to the heart, and open the way\nfor the reception of truth.\nThe love of ease, and, I may say, physical laziness, un\ufb01ts a man to\nbe a minister. Those who are preparing to enter the ministry should train\nthemselves to do hard physical work; then they will be better able to do hard\nthinking.\nLet young men set up well-de\ufb01ned landmarks, by which they may\nbe governed in emergencies. When a crisis comes that demands active,\nwell-developed physical powers and a clear, strong, practical mind; when\n106\ndif\ufb01cult work is to be done, where every stroke must tell; when perplexities\narise which can be met only by wisdom from on high, then the youth who\nhave learned to overcome dif\ufb01culties by earnest labor can respond to the call\nfor workers. *****\nThe Necessity for Steadfastness\nIn Paul\u2019s letter to Timothy there are many lessons for the young minister\nto learn. The aged apostle urged upon the younger worker the necessity of\nsteadfastness in the faith, \u201cI put thee in remembrance,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat thou\nstir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. For\nGod hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a\nsound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord,\nnor of me His prisoner: but be thou partaker of the af\ufb02ictions of the gospel\naccording to the power of God.\u201d\nPaul entreated Timothy to remember that he had been called \u201cwith a holy\ncalling\u201d to proclaim the power of Him who had \u201cbrought life and immortality\nto light through the gospel: whereunto,\u201d he declared, \u201cI am appointed a\npreacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. For the which cause\nI also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom\nI have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have\ncommitted unto Him against that day.\u201d [2 Timothy 1:6-12.]\nWherever Paul was,\u2014whether before scowling Pharisees, or Roman\nauthorities; before the furious mob at Lystra, or the convicted sinners in the\nMacedonian dungeon; whether reasoning with the panic-stricken\n107\nsailors on the shipwrecked vessel, or standing alone before Nero to plead for\nhis life,\u2014he had never been ashamed of the cause he was advocating. The\none great purpose of his Christian life had been to serve Him whose name\nhad once \ufb01lled him with contempt; and from this purpose no opposition or\npersecution had been able to turn him aside. His faith, made strong by effort\nand pure by sacri\ufb01ce, upheld and strengthened him.\n\u201cThou therefore, my son,\u201d Paul continued, \u201cbe strong in the grace that\nis in Christ Jesus. And the things that thou hast heard of me among many\nwitnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach\nothers also. Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus\nChrist.\u201d [2 Timothy 2:1-3.]\nThe true minister of God will not shun hardship or responsibility. From\nthe Source that never fails those who sincerely seek for divine power, he\ndraws strength that enables him to meet and overcome temptation, and to\nperform the duties that God places upon him. The nature of the grace that he\nreceives, enlarges his capacity to know God and His Son. His soul goes out in\nlonging desire to do acceptable service for the Master. And as he advances in\nthe Christian pathway, he becomes \u201cstrong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.\u201d\nThis grace enables him to be a faithful witness of the things that he has heard.\nHe does not despise or neglect the knowledge that he has received from God,\nbut commits this knowledge to faithful men, who in their turn teach others.\nIn this his last letter to Timothy, Paul held up before the younger worker\na high ideal, pointing out the duties devolving on him as a minister of Christ.\n108\n\u201cStudy to show thyself approved unto God,\u201d the apostle wrote, \u201ca workman\nthat needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\u201d \u201cFlee also\nyouthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that\ncall on the Lord out of a pure heart. But foolish and unlearned questions\navoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. And the servant of the Lord\nmust not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness\ninstructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them\nrepentance to the acknowledging of the truth.\u201d [2 Timothy 2:15, 22-25.]\u2014The\nActs of the Apostles, 499-502.\n109\n110\nSection IV . Quali\ufb01cations\nConsecration\nIn order for a man to be a successful minister, something more than book\nknowledge is essential. The laborer for souls needs consecration, integrity,\nintelligence, industry, energy, and tact. Possessing these quali\ufb01cations, no\nman can be inferior; instead, he will have a commanding in\ufb02uence for good.\n*****\nChrist brought His desires and wishes into strict abeyance to His\nmission,\u2014the mission that bore the insignia of Heaven. He made everything\nsubordinate to the work that He came to this world to accomplish. When\nin His youth His mother found Him in the school of the rabbis, and said to\nHim, \u201cSon, why hast Thou thus dealt with us? behold, Thy father and I have\nsought Thee sorrowing,\u201d He answered,\u2014and His answer is the key-note of\nHis life-work,\u2014\u201cHow is it that ye sought Me? wist ye not that I must be\nabout My Father\u2019s business?\u201d [Luke 2:48, 49.]\nThe same devotion, the same consecration, the same subjection to the\nclaims of the word of God, that were manifest in Christ, must be seen in His\nservants. He left His home of security and peace, left the glory that He had\nwith the Father before the world was, left His\n111\nposition upon the throne of the universe, and went forth, a suffering, tempted\nman; went forth in solitude, to sow in tears, to water with His blood the seed\nof life for a lost world.\nHis servants in like manner must go forth to sow. When called to become a\nsower of the seed of truth, Abraham was bidden, \u201cGet thee out of thy country,\nand from thy kindred, and from thy father\u2019s house, unto a land that I will\nshow thee.\u201d [Genesis 12:1.] \u201cAnd he went out, not knowing whither he went,\u201d\n[Hebrews 11:8.] as God\u2019s lightbearer, to keep His name alive in the earth. He\nforsook his country, his home, his relatives, and all the pleasant associations\nconnected with his earthly life, to become a pilgrim and a stranger.\nSo to the apostle Paul, praying in the temple at Jerusalem, came the\nmessage, \u201cDepart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.\u201d [Acts\n22:21.] So those who are called to unite with Christ must leave all in order to\nfollow Him. Old associations must be broken up, plans of life relinquished,\nearthly hopes surrendered. In toil and tears, in solitude and through sacri\ufb01ce,\nmust the seed be sown.\nThose who consecrate body, soul, and spirit to God, will constantly\nreceive a new endowment of physical, mental, and spiritual power. The\ninexhaustible supplies of heaven are at their command. Christ gives them the\nbreath of His own Spirit, the life of His own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth\nHis highest energies to work in heart and mind. The grace of God enlarges\nand multiplies their faculties, and every perfection of the divine nature comes\nto their assistance in the work of saving souls. Through co-operation with\nChrist,\n112\nthey are made complete in Him, and in their human weakness they are enabled\nto do the deeds of Omnipotence.\nThe Redeemer will not accept divided service. Daily the worker for God\nmust learn the meaning of self-surrender. He must study the word of God,\nlearning its meaning and obeying its precepts. Thus he may reach the standard\nof Christian excellence. Day by day God works with him, perfecting the\ncharacter that is to stand in the time of \ufb01nal test. And day by day the believer\nis working out before men and angels a sublime experiment, showing what\nthe gospel can do for fallen human beings.\nWhen Christ called His disciples to follow Him, He offered them no\n\ufb02attering prospects in this life. He gave them no promise of gain or worldly\nhonor, nor did they make any stipulation as to what they should receive.\nTo Matthew as he sat at the receipt of custom, the Saviour said, \u201cFollow\nMe. And he arose, and followed Him.\u201d [Matthew 9:9.] Matthew did not,\nbefore rendering service, wait to demand a certain salary, equal to the amount\nreceived in his former occupation. Without question or hesitation he followed\nJesus. It was enough for him that he was to be with the Saviour, that he might\nhear His words and unite with Him in His work.\nSo it was with the disciples previously called. When Jesus bade Peter and\nhis companions follow Him, they immediately left their boats and nets. Some\nof these disciples had friends dependent on them for support; but when they\nreceived the Saviour\u2019s invitation, they did not hesitate, inquiring, How shall I\nlive, and sustain my family? They were obedient to the call;\n113\nand when afterward Jesus asked them, \u201cWhat I sent you without purse, and\nscrip, and shoes, lacked ye anything?\u201d they could answer, \u201cNothing.\u201d [Luke\n22:35.]\nToday the Saviour calls us, as He called Matthew and John and Peter, to\nHis work. If our hearts are touched by His love, the question of compensation\nwill not be uppermost in our minds. We shall rejoice to be co-workers with\nChrist, and we shall not fear to trust His care. If we make God our strength,\nwe shall have clear perceptions of duty, and unsel\ufb01sh aspirations; our life will\nbe actuated by a noble purpose, which will raise us above sordid motives.\nMany whom the Lord could use will not hear and obey His voice above all\nothers. Kindred and friends, former habits and associations, have so strong\nan in\ufb02uence upon them that God can give them but little instruction, can\ncommunicate to them but little knowledge of His purposes. The Lord would\ndo much more for His servants if they were wholly consecrated to Him,\nplacing His service above the ties of kindred and all other earthly associations.\nDeeper Consecration Needed\nThe time demands greater ef\ufb01ciency and deeper consecration. I cry\nto God, Raise up and send forth messengers \ufb01lled with a sense of their\nresponsibility, men in whose hearts self-idolatry, which lies at the foundation\nof all sin, has been cruci\ufb01ed; who are willing to consecrate themselves\nwithout reserve to God\u2019s service; whose souls are alive to the sacredness of\nthe work and the responsibility of their calling; who are determined not to\nbring to God a maimed sacri\ufb01ce, which costs them neither effort nor prayer.\n114\nThe Duke of Wellington was once present where a party of Christian\nmen were discussing the possibility of success in missionary effort among\nthe heathen. They appealed to the duke to say whether in his judgment such\nefforts were likely to prove a success commensurate to the cost. The old\nsoldier replied:\n\u201cGentlemen, what are your marching orders? Success is not the question\nfor you to discuss. If I read your orders aright, they run thus, \u2018Go ye into all\nthe world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\u2019 Gentlemen, obey your\nmarching orders.\u201d\nMy brethren, the Lord is coming, and we need to bend every energy to\nthe accomplishment of the work before us. I appeal to you to give yourselves\nwholly to the work. Christ gave His time, His soul, His strength, to labor for\nthe bene\ufb01t and blessing of humanity. Entire days were devoted to labor, and\nentire nights were spent in prayer, that He might be braced to meet the foe\nand forti\ufb01ed to help those who came to Him for relief. As we trace a stream\nof living water by the line of green that it produces, so Christ may be seen in\nthe deeds of mercy that marked His path at every step. Wherever He went,\nhealth sprang up, and happiness followed where He passed. So simply did\nHe present the words of life that a child could understand them. The youth\ncaught His spirit of ministry, and sought to pattern after His gracious ways by\nassisting those who needed help. The blind and deaf rejoiced in His presence.\nHis words to the ignorant and sinful opened to them a fountain of life. He\ndispensed His blessings abundantly and continuously; they were the garnered\nriches of eternity, given in Christ, the Father\u2019s gift to man.\n115\nWorkers for God should as surely feel that they are not their own as if the\nvery stamp and seal of identi\ufb01cation were placed upon their persons. They\nare to be sprinkled with the blood of Christ\u2019s sacri\ufb01ce, and in the spirit of\nentire consecration they should resolve that by the grace of Christ they will\nbe a living sacri\ufb01ce. But how few of us regard the salvation of sinners in\nthe light in which it is viewed by the heavenly universe,\u2014as a plan devised\nfrom eternity in the mind of God! How few of us are heart to heart with\nthe Redeemer in this solemn, closing work! There is scarcely a tithe of the\ncompassion that there should be for souls unsaved. There are so many to be\nwarned, and yet how few sympathize with God suf\ufb01ciently to be anything or\nnothing if only they can see souls won to Christ!\nWhen Elijah was about to leave Elisha, he said to him, \u201cAsk what I shall\ndo for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let\na double portion of thy spirit be upon me.\u201d [2 Kings 2:9.] Elisha did not ask\nfor worldly honor, for a place among the great men of the earth. That which\nhe craved was a large portion of the spirit given to the one whom God was\nabout to honor with translation. He knew that nothing else could \ufb01t him for\nthe work that would be required of him.\nMinisters of the gospel, had this question been asked you, what would\nyou have answered? What is the greatest desire of your heart, as you engage\nin the service of God?\n116\nTactfulness\nIn the work of soul-winning, great tact and wisdom are needed. The\nSaviour never suppressed the truth, but He uttered it always in love. In His\nintercourse with others, He exercised the greatest tact, and He was always\nkind and thoughtful. He was never rude, never needlessly spoke a severe\nword, never gave unnecessary pain to a sensitive soul. He did not censure\nhuman weakness. He fearlessly denounced hypocrisy, unbelief, and iniquity,\nbut tears were in His voice as He uttered His scathing rebukes. He never made\ntruth cruel, but ever manifested a deep tenderness for humanity. Every soul\nwas precious in His sight. He bore Himself with divine dignity; yet He bowed\nwith the tenderest compassion and regard to every member of the family of\nGod. He saw in all, souls whom it was His mission to save.\nPaul\u2019s Discretion\nThe minister must not feel that the whole truth is to be spoken to\nunbelievers on any and every occasion. He should study carefully when to\nspeak, what to say, and what to leave unsaid. This is not practicing deception;\nit is working as Paul worked. \u201cThough I be free from all men,\u201d he wrote to\nthe Corinthians, \u201cyet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain\nthe more. And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to\nthem that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are\nunder the law; to them that are without law, as\n117\nwithout law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that\nI might gain them that are without law. To the weak became I as weak, that\nI might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all\nmeans save some.\u201d [1 Corinthians 9:19-22.]\nPaul did not approach the Jews in such a way as to arouse their prejudices.\nHe did not at \ufb01rst tell them that they must believe in Jesus of Nazareth; but\ndwelt upon the prophecies that spoke of Christ, His mission and His work.\nStep by step he led his hearers on, showing the importance of honoring the\nlaw of God. He gave due honor to the ceremonial law, showing that it was\nChrist who instituted the Jewish economy and the sacri\ufb01cial service. Then he\nbrought them down to the \ufb01rst advent of the Redeemer, and showed that in\nthe life and death of Christ every speci\ufb01cation of the sacri\ufb01cial service had\nbeen ful\ufb01lled.\nThe Gentiles, Paul approached by exalting Christ, and then presenting the\nbinding claims of the law. He showed how the light re\ufb02ected by the cross of\nCalvary gave signi\ufb01cance and glory to the whole Jewish economy.\nThus the apostle varied his manner of labor, shaping his message to\nthe circumstances under which he was placed. After patient labor he\nwas successful to a large degree; yet there were many who would not be\nconvinced. Some there are today who will not be convinced by any method\nof presenting the truth; and the laborer for God is to study carefully the best\nmethods, that he may not arouse prejudice or combativeness. This is where\nsome have failed. By following their natural inclinations, they have closed\ndoors through which they might, by a different method of\n118\nlabor, have found access to hearts, and through them to other hearts.\nGod\u2019s workmen must be many-sided men; that is, they must have breadth\nof character. They are not to be one-idea men, stereotyped in their manner of\nworking, unable to see that their advocacy of truth must vary with the class\nof people among whom they work and the circumstances they have to meet.\nThere is delicate work for the minister to do as he meets with alienation,\nbitterness, and opposition. More than others, he needs that wisdom which \u201cis\n\ufb01rst pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and\ngood fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.\u201d [James 3:17.] As the\ndew and the still showers fall gently upon withering plants, so his words are\nto fall gently when he proclaims the truth. He is to win souls, not to repulse\nthem. He is to study to be skilful when there are no rules to meet the case.\nMany souls have been turned in the wrong direction, and thus lost to the\ncause of God, by a lack of skill and wisdom on the part of the worker. Tact\nand good judgment increase the usefulness of the laborer a hundred-fold. If\nhe will speak the right words at the right time, and show the right spirit, this\nwill exert a melting power on the heart of the one he is trying to help.\nIn New Fields\nIn laboring in a new \ufb01eld, do not think it your duty to say at once to the\npeople, We are Seventh-day Adventists; we believe that the seventh day is\nthe Sabbath; we believe in the non-immortality of the soul. This would often\nerect a formidable barrier between\n119\nyou and those you wish to reach. Speak to them, as you have opportunity,\nupon points of doctrine on which you can agree. Dwell on the necessity of\npractical godliness. Give them evidence that you are a Christian, desiring\npeace, and that you love their souls. Let them see that you are conscientious.\nThus you will gain their con\ufb01dence; and there will be time enough for\ndoctrines. Let the heart be won, the soil prepared, and then sow the seed,\npresenting in love the truth as it is in Jesus.\nGod will surely help those who seek Him for wisdom. We are not to wait\nuntil opportunities come to us; we are to seek for opportunities, and we are to\nbe ready always to give a reason for the hope that is in us. If the worker keeps\nhis heart uplifted in prayer, God will help him to speak the right word at the\nright time. *****\nIn seeking to correct or reform others, we should be careful of our words.\nThey will be a savor of life unto life, or of death unto death. In giving reproof\nor counsel, many indulge in sharp, severe speech, words not adapted to heal\nthe wounded soul. By these ill-advised expressions the spirit is chafed, and\noften the erring ones are stirred to rebellion.\nAll who would advocate the principles of truth need to receive the\nheavenly oil of love. Under all circumstances reproof should be spoken in\nlove. Then our words will reform, but not exasperate. Christ by His Holy\nSpirit will supply the force and the power. This is His Work.\n120\nThe Grace of Courtesy\nThose who work for Christ are to be upright and trustworthy, \ufb01rm as a\nrock to principle, and at the same time kind and courteous. Courtesy is one\nof the graces of the Spirit. To deal with human minds is the greatest work\never given to man; and he who would \ufb01nd access to hearts must heed the\ninjunction, \u201cBe pitiful, be courteous.\u201d [1 Peter 3:8.] Love will do that which\nargument will fail to accomplish. But a moment\u2019s petulance, a single gruff\nanswer, a lack of Christian politeness and courtesy in some small matter, may\nresult in the loss of both friends and in\ufb02uence.\nWhat Christ was on this earth, the Christian worker should strive to be.\nHe is our example, not only in His spotless purity, but in His patience,\ngentleness, and winsomeness of disposition. His life is an illustration of true\ncourtesy. He had ever a kind look and a word of comfort for the needy and\nthe oppressed. His presence brought a purer atmosphere into the home. His\nlife was as leaven working amid the elements of society. Pure and unde\ufb01led,\nHe walked among the thoughtless, the rude, the uncourteous; among unjust\npublicans, unrighteous Samaritans, heathen soldiers, rough peasants, and the\nmixed multitude. He spoke a word of sympathy here and a word there. As\nHe saw men weary, and compelled to bear heavy burdens, He shared their\nburdens, and repeated to them the lessons He had learned from nature, of the\nlove, the kindness, the goodness of God. He sought to inspire with hope the\nmost rough and unpromising, setting before them the assurance\n121\nthat they might attain such a character as would make them manifest as\nchildren of God.\nThe religion of Jesus softens whatever is hard and rough in the temper,\nand smooths whatever is rugged and sharp in the manners. It makes the words\ngentle and the demeanor winning. Let us learn from Christ how to combine\na high sense of purity and integrity with sunniness of disposition. A kind,\ncourteous Christian is the most powerful argument that can be produced in\nfavor of Christianity.\nKind words are as dew and gentle showers to the soul. The Scripture says\nof Christ, that grace was poured into His lips, that He might \u201cknow how to\nspeak a word in season to him that is weary.\u201d [Isaiah 50:4.] And the Lord\nbids us, \u201cLet your speech be alway with grace\u201d \u201cthat it may minister grace\nunto the hearers.\u201d [Colossians 4:6; Ephesians 4:29.]\nSome with whom you are brought in contact may be rough and\nuncourteous, but do not, because of this, be less courteous yourself. He\nwho wishes to preserve his own self-respect must be careful not to wound\nneedlessly the self-respect of others. This rule should be sacredly observed\ntoward the dullest, the most blundering. What God intends to do with these\napparently unpromising ones, you do not know. He has in the past accepted\npersons no more promising or attractive to do a great work for Him. His\nSpirit, moving upon the heart, has roused every faculty to vigorous action.\nThe Lord saw in these rough, unhewn stones precious material, which would\nstand the test of storm and heat and pressure. God does not\n122\nsee as man sees. He does not judge from appearances, but searches the heart\nand judges righteously. *****\nThe Lord Jesus demands our acknowledgment of the rights of every\nman. Men\u2019s social rights, and their rights as Christians, are to be taken into\nconsideration. All are to be treated with re\ufb01nement and delicacy, as the sons\nand daughters of God.\nChristianity will make a man a gentleman. Christ was courteous, even\nto His persecutors; and His true followers will manifest the same spirit.\nLook at Paul when brought before rulers. His speech before Agrippa is an\nillustration of true courtesy as well as persuasive eloquence. The gospel does\nnot encourage the formal politeness current with the world, but the courtesy\nthat springs from real kindness of heart.\nThe most careful attention to the outward proprieties of life is not\nsuf\ufb01cient to shut out all fretfulness, harsh judgment, and unbecoming speech.\nTrue re\ufb01nement will never be revealed so long as self is considered as the\nsupreme object. Love must dwell in the heart. A thoroughgoing Christian\ndraws his motives of action from his deep heart-love for his Master. Up\nthrough the roots of his affection for Christ springs an unsel\ufb01sh interest in\nhis brethren. Love imparts to its possessor grace, propriety, and comeliness\nof deportment. It illuminates the countenance and subdues the voice; it re\ufb01nes\nand elevates the entire being.\n123\nPropriety of Deportment\nTo those who handle sacred things comes the solemn injunction, \u201cBe ye\nclean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.\u201d [Isaiah 52:11.] Of all men, those\nwho have been trusted and honored by the Lord, those who have been given\nspecial service to perform, should be circumspect in word and deed. They\nshould be men of devotion, who, by works of righteousness and pure, true\nwords, can lift their fellow-men to a higher level; men who are not unsettled\nby every passing temptation; men of \ufb01rm, earnest purpose, whose highest aim\nis to gather souls to Christ.\nSatan\u2019s special temptations are directed against the ministry. He knows\nthat ministers are but human, possessing no grace or holiness of their own;\nthat the treasures of the gospel have been placed in earthen vessels, which\ndivine power alone can make vessels unto honor. He knows that God has\nordained ministers to be a powerful means for the salvation of souls, and that\nthey can be successful in their work only as they allow the eternal Father to\nrule their lives. Therefore he tries with all his ingenuity to lead them into\nsin, knowing that their of\ufb01ce makes sin in them more exceeding sinful; for in\ncommitting sin, they make themselves ministers of evil.\nThose whom God has called to the ministry are to give evidence that they\nare \ufb01t to minister in the sacred desk. The Lord has commanded, \u201cBe ye holy\nin all manner of conversation.\u201d [1 Peter 1:15.] \u201cBe thou an example of the\nbelievers,\u201d Paul writes. \u201cTake heed unto thyself,\n124\nand unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save\nthyself, and them that hear thee.\u201d [1 Timothy 4:12, 16.] \u201cThe end of all things\nis at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.\u201d [1 Peter 4:7.]\nThe subject of purity and propriety of deportment is one to which we\nmust give heed. We must guard against the sins of this degenerate age. Let\nnot Christ\u2019s ambassadors descend to tri\ufb02ing conversation, to familiarity with\nwomen, married or single. Let them keep their proper place with becoming\ndignity; yet at the same time they may be sociable, kind, and courteous to\nall. They must stand aloof from everything that savors of commonness and\nfamiliarity. This is forbidden ground, upon which it is unsafe to set the feet.\nEvery word, every act, should tend to elevate, to re\ufb01ne, to ennoble. There is\nsin in thoughtlessness about such matters.\nPaul urged Timothy to meditate upon those things that are pure and\nexcellent, that his pro\ufb01ting might appear unto all. The same counsel is greatly\nneeded by men of the present age. I urge upon our workers the necessity of\npurity in every thought, every act. We have an individual accountability to\nGod, an individual work which no one else can do for us. It is to strive to\nmake the world better. While we should cultivate sociability, let it not be\nmerely for amusement, but for a higher purpose.\nIs there not enough taking place around us to show the need for this\ncaution? Everywhere are seen wrecks of humanity, broken-down family\naltars, ruined homes. There is a strange abandonment of principle, the\nstandard of morality is lowered, and the earth is\n125\nfast becoming a Sodom. The practices which brought the judgment of God\nupon the antediluvian world, and which caused Sodom to be destroyed by \ufb01re,\nare fast increasing. We are nearing the end, when the earth is to be puri\ufb01ed\nby \ufb01re.\nLet those in whose hands God has placed the light of truth, depart from\nall iniquity. Let them walk in the paths of rectitude, mastering every passion\nand habit that would in any way mar the work of God, or leave a spot upon\nits sacredness. It is the work of the minister to resist the temptations that lie\nin his pathway, to rise above those debasements that drag the mind down to\na low level. By watchfulness and prayer, he may so guard his weakest points\nthat they will become his strongest points. Through the grace of Christ, men\nmay acquire moral stamina, strength of will, and stability of purpose. There\nis power in this grace to enable them to rise above the alluring, infatuating\ntemptations of Satan, and to become loyal, devoted Christians.\nMinisters to Set a Worthy Example\nMinisters should set the youth a worthy example, one corresponding to\ntheir holy calling. They should help the young to be frank, yet modest and\ndigni\ufb01ed in all their associations. Day by day they are sowing seed that will\nspring up and bear fruit. They are to put away all coarseness, all tri\ufb02ing,\never remembering that they are educators; that, whether they will or not, their\nwords and acts are to those with whom they come in contact a savor of life or\nof death.\nIt is discipline of spirit, cleanness of heart and thought, that is needed.\nMoral purity depends on\n126\nright thinking and right acting. Evil thoughts destroy the soul, while a right\ncontrol of the thoughts prepares the mind to labor harmoniously for the\nMaster. Every thought should be brought into captivity to the obedience of\nChrist.\nThe teachers of truth must be wise men, very careful of their words and\nactions. They must be men who will give meat in due season to the \ufb02ock of\nGod; men who will not give the least sanction to low standards of living; men\nwho have that faith which works by love, and puri\ufb01es the soul from all carnal\nthoughts and desires. Workers of this character will not grovel in earthliness;\nthey will not be in bondage to human beings or to Satan\u2019s temptations. They\nwill quit themselves like men, and be strong. They will turn their faces to the\nSun of Righteousness, rising above all base things into an atmosphere free\nfrom spiritual and moral de\ufb01lement.\nHe who lives the principles of Bible religion, will not be found weak in\nmoral power. Under the ennobling in\ufb02uence of the Holy Spirit, the tastes\nand inclinations become pure and holy. Nothing takes so strong a hold upon\nthe affections, nothing reaches so fully down to the deepest motives of action,\nnothing exerts so potent an in\ufb02uence upon the life, and gives so great \ufb01rmness\nand stability to the character, as the religion of Christ. It leads its possessor\never upward, inspiring him with noble purposes, teaching him propriety of\ndeportment, and imparting a becoming dignity to every action. *****\nBy what means shall the young man repress his evil propensities, and\ndevelop that which is noble and\n127\ngood in his character? Let him heed the words, \u201cWhether therefore ye eat,\nor drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\u201d [1 Corinthians\n10:31.] Here is a principle that is to underlie every motive, thought, and act.\nUnholy passions must be cruci\ufb01ed. They will clamor for indulgence, but God\nhas implanted in the heart high and holy purposes and desires, and these need\nnot be debased. It is only when we refuse to submit to the control of reason\nand conscience that we are dragged down. Paul declared, \u201cI can do all things\nthrough Christ.\u201d [Philippians 4:13.] *****\nIf you draw close to Jesus, and seek to adorn your profession by a\nwell-ordered life and godly conversation, your feet will be kept from straying\ninto forbidden paths. If you will only watch, continually watch unto prayer, if\nyou will do everything as if you were in the immediate presence of God,\nyou will be saved from yielding to temptation, and may hope to be kept\npure, spotless, and unde\ufb01led till the last. If you hold the beginning of your\ncon\ufb01dence \ufb01rm unto the end, your ways will be established in God, and what\ngrace has begun, glory will crown in the kingdom of our God. The fruits\nof the Spirit are love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,\nmeekness, temperance; against such there is no law. If Christ be within us,\nwe shall crucify the \ufb02esh with the affections and lusts.\n128\nThe Social Relations\nThe usefulness of young ministers, married or unmarried, is often\ndestroyed by the attachment shown to them by young women. Such women\ndo not realize that other eyes are upon them, and that the course pursued by\nthem may have a tendency to injure the in\ufb02uence of the minister to whom they\ngive so much attention. If they would strictly regard the rules of propriety, it\nwould be much better for them and much better for the minister. Their failure\nto do this places him in a disagreeable position, and causes others to look\nupon him in a wrong light.\nBut the burden of this matter rests upon the ministers themselves. They\nshould show a distaste for such attention; and if they take the course which\nGod would have them, they will not long be troubled. They should shun\nevery appearance of evil; and when young women are very sociable, it is the\nministers\u2019 duty to let them know that this is not pleasing. They must repulse\nforwardness, even if they are thought to be rude, in order to save the cause\nfrom reproach. Young women who have been converted to the truth and to\nGod, will listen to reproof, and will be reformed. *****\nJesting, joking, and worldly conversation belong to the world. Christians\nwho have the peace of God in their hearts, will be cheerful and happy without\nindulging in lightness or frivolity. While watching unto prayer, they will have\na serenity and peace which will elevate them above all super\ufb02uities.\n129\nThe mystery of godliness, opened to the mind of the minister of Christ,\nwill raise him above earthly and sensual enjoyments. He will be a partaker of\nthe divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through\nlust. The communion opened between God and his soul will make him fruitful\nin the knowledge of God\u2019s will, and open before him treasures of practical\nsubjects that he can present to the people, which will not cause levity or the\nsemblance of a smile, but will solemnize the mind, touch the heart, and arouse\nthe moral sensibilities to the sacred claims that God has upon the affections\nand life. Those who labor in word and doctrine should be men of God, pure\nin heart and life.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church3:241. *****\nYoung men are arising to engage in the work of God, some of whom have\nscarcely any sense of the sacredness and responsibility of the work. They\nhave but little experience in exercising faith, and in earnest soul-hunger for\nthe Spirit of God, which ever brings returns. Some men of good capabilities,\nwho might \ufb01ll important positions, do not know what spirit they are of. They\nrun in a jovial mood as naturally as water \ufb02ows downhill. They talk nonsense,\nand sport with young girls, while almost daily listening to the most solemn,\nsoul-stirring truths. These men have a religion of the head, but their hearts\nare not sancti\ufb01ed by the truths they hear. Such can never lead others to the\nFountain of living waters until they have drunk of the stream themselves.\n130\nIt is no time now for lightness, vanity, or tri\ufb02ing. The scenes of this\nearth\u2019s history are soon to close. Minds that have been left to loose thought,\nneed change. The apostle Peter says, \u201cGird up the loins of your mind, be\nsober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at\nthe revelation of Jesus Christ; as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves\naccording to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as He which hath called\nyou is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written,\nBe ye holy; for I am holy.\u201d [1 Peter 1:13-16.]\nLoose thoughts must be gathered up and centered on God. The very\nthoughts should be in obedience to the will of God. Praise should not be given\nor expected; for this will have a tendency to foster self-con\ufb01dence rather than\nto increase humility, to corrupt rather than to purify. Men who are really\nquali\ufb01ed, and who feel that they have a part to act in connection with the\nwork of God, will feel pressed beneath a sense of the sacredness of the work,\nas a cart beneath sheaves. Now is the time to make the most earnest efforts\nto overcome the natural feelings of the carnal heart.\u2014 \u201cTestimonies for the\nChurch,\u201d V ol. III, pages 473, 474. *****\nWhen a minister bearing the solemn message of warning to the world,\nreceives the hospitable courtesies of friends and brethren, and neglects\nthe duties of a shepherd of the \ufb02ock, and is careless in his example and\ndeportment, engaging with the young in tri\ufb02ing conversation, in jesting and\njoking, and in relating humorous anecdotes to create laughter, he is unworthy\nof being a\n131\ngospel minister, and needs to be converted before he is entrusted with the care\nof the sheep and lambs. Ministers who are neglectful of the duties devolving\non a faithful pastor, give evidence that they are not sancti\ufb01ed by the truths\nthey present to others, and should not be sustained as laborers in the vineyard\nof the Lord till they have a high sense of the sacredness of the work of a\nminister.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church3:233. *****\nThe minister of Christ should be a man of prayer, a man of piety; cheerful,\nbut never coarse and rough, jesting or frivolous. A spirit of frivolity may be\nin keeping with the profession of clowns and theatrical performers, but it is\naltogether beneath the dignity of a man who is chosen to stand between the\nliving and the dead, and to be a mouthpiece for God. *****\nThe mystery of godliness, opened to the mind of the minister of Christ,\nwill raise him above earthly and sensual enjoyments. He will be a partaker of\nthe divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through\nlust. The communication opened between God and his soul will make him\nfruitful in the knowledge of God\u2019s will, and open before him treasures of\npractical subjects that he can present to the people, which will not cause levity\nor the semblance of a smile, but will solemnize the mind, touch the heart,\nand arouse the moral sensibilities to the sacred claims that God has upon the\naffections and life. Those who labor in word and doctrine should be men of\nGod, pure in heart and life.\n132\nDecision and Promptness\nIndependent men of earnest endeavor are needed, not men as impressible\nas putty. Those who want their work made ready to their hand, who desire\na \ufb01xed amount to do and a \ufb01xed salary, and who wish to prove an exact \ufb01t\nwithout the trouble of adaptation or training, are not the men whom God calls\nto work in His cause. A man who cannot adapt his abilities to almost any\nplace, if necessity requires, is not the man for this time. Men whom God will\nconnect with His work are not limp and \ufb01berless, without muscle or moral\nforce of character....\nThere are men who \ufb02atter themselves that they might do something great\nand good if they were only circumstanced differently, while they make no\nuse of the faculties they already have, by working in the positions where\nProvidence has placed them.... Individual independence and individual power\nare the qualities now needed. Individual character need not be sacri\ufb01ced, but\nit should be modulated, re\ufb01ned, elevated....\nThe cause of God demands men who can see quickly and act\ninstantaneously at the right time and with power. If you wait to measure\nevery dif\ufb01culty and balance every perplexity you meet, you will do but little.\nYou will have obstacles and dif\ufb01culties to encounter at every turn, and you\nmust with \ufb01rm purpose decide to conquer them, or they will conquer you.\nSometimes various ways and purposes, different modes of operation in\nconnection with the work of God,\n133\nare about evenly balanced in the mind; and it is at this very point that the\nnicest discrimination is necessary. And if anything is accomplished to the\npurpose, it must be done at the golden moment. The slightest inclination of\nthe weight in the balance should be seen, and should determine the matter\nat once. Long delays tire the angels. It is even more excusable to make a\nwrong decision sometimes than to be continually in a wavering position; to\nbe hesitating, sometimes inclined in one direction, then in another. More\nperplexity and wretchedness result from thus hesitating and doubting than\nfrom sometimes moving too hastily.\nI have been shown that the most signal victories and the most fearful\ndefeats have been on the turn of minutes. God requires promptness of action.\nDelays, doubtings, hesitation, and indecision frequently give the enemy every\nadvantage....\nThe timing of things may tell much in favor of truth. Victories are\nfrequently lost through delays. There will be crises in this cause. Prompt\nand decisive action at the right time will gain glorious triumphs, while\ndelay and neglect will result in great failures and positive dishonor to God.\nRapid movements at the critical moment often disarm the enemy, and he is\ndisappointed and vanquished, for he had expected time to lay plans and work\nby arti\ufb01ce....\nThe greatest promptness is positively necessary in the hour of peril and\ndanger. Every plan may be well laid to accomplish certain results, and yet\na delay of a very short time may leave things to assume an entirely different\nshape, and the great objects which might have been gained are lost through\nlack of quick foresight and prompt dispatch.\n134\nMuch may be done in training the mind to overcome indolence. There are\ntimes when caution and great deliberation are necessary; rashness would be\nfolly. But even here much has been lost by too great hesitancy. Caution, up to\na certain point, is required; but hesitancy and policy on particular occasions\nhave been more disastrous than would have been a failure through rashness.\u2014\n\u201cTestimonies for the Church. \u201d Vol. III, pages 496-498. *****\nThere are those who for a time are successful in the struggle against their\nsel\ufb01sh desire for pleasure and ease. They are sincere and earnest, but grow\nweary of protracted effort, of daily death, of ceaseless turmoil. Indolence\nseems inviting, death to self repulsive; and they close their drowsy eyes, and\nfall under the power of temptation instead of resisting it.\nThe directions laid down in the word of God leave no room for\ncompromise with evil. The Son of God was manifested that He might draw\nall men unto Himself. He came not to lull the world to sleep, but to point\nout the narrow path in which all must travel who reach at last the gates of the\ncity of God. His children must follow where He has led the way; at whatever\nsacri\ufb01ce of ease or sel\ufb01sh indulgence, at whatever cost of labor or suffering,\nthey must maintain a constant battle with self.\n135\nGathering the Fruit\u2014A Dream\nIn a dream given me Sept. 29, 1886, I was walking with a large company\nwho were looking for berries. There were many young men and women in\nthe company who were to help in gathering the fruit. We seemed to be in a\ncity, for there was very little vacant ground; but around the city there were\nopen \ufb01elds, beautiful groves, and cultivated gardens. A large wagon laden\nwith provisions for our company went before us.\nSoon the wagon halted, and the party scattered in every direction to look\nfor fruit. All around the wagon were both high and low bushes, bearing large,\nbeautiful whortleberries; but the company were all looking too far away to\nsee them. I began to gather the fruit near by, but very carefully, for fear of\npicking the green berries, which were so mingled with the ripe fruit that I\ncould pick only one or two berries from a cluster.\nSome of the nice large berries had fallen to the ground, and were half\nconsumed by worms and insects. \u201cOh,\u201d thought I, \u201cif this \ufb01eld had only been\nentered before, all this precious fruit might have been saved! But it is too late\nnow. I will, however, pick these from the ground, and see if there is any good\nin them. Even if the whole berry is spoiled, I can at least show the brethren\nwhat they might have found if they had not been too late.\u201d\nJust then two or three of the party came sauntering around where I was.\nThey were chatting, and seemed to be much occupied with each other\u2019s\ncompany. Seeing me, they said, \u201cWe have looked everywhere, and\n136\ncan \ufb01nd no fruit.\u201d They looked with astonishment at the quantity I had. I said,\n\u201cThere are more to be gathered from these bushes.\u201d They began picking, but\nsoon stopped, saying, \u201cIt is not fair for us to pick here; you found this spot,\nand the fruit is yours.\u201d But I replied, \u201cThat makes no difference. Gather\nwherever you can \ufb01nd anything. This is God\u2019s \ufb01eld, and these are His berries;\nit is your privilege to pick them.\u201d\nBut soon I seemed to be alone again. Every little while I heard talking\nand laughing at the wagon. I called out to those who were there, \u201cWhat are\nyou doing?\u201d They answered, \u201cWe could not \ufb01nd any berries, and as we were\ntired and hungry, we thought we would come to the wagon and take a lunch.\nAfter we have rested awhile, we will go out again.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d I said, \u201cyou have brought in nothing as yet. You are eating up all\nour supplies, without giving us any more. I cannot eat now; there is too much\nfruit to be picked. You did not \ufb01nd it because you did not look close enough.\nIt does not hang on the outside of the bushes; you must search for it. True, you\ncannot pick it by handfuls; but by looking carefully among the green berries,\nyou will \ufb01nd very choice fruit.\u201d\nMy small pail was soon full of berries, and I took them to the wagon. Said\nI, \u201cThis is the nicest fruit that I ever picked, and I gathered it near by, while\nyou have wearied yourselves by searching at a distance without success.\u201d\nThen all came to see fruit. They said, \u201cThese are high-bush berries, \ufb01rm\nand good. We did not think we could \ufb01nd anything on the high bushes, so we\nhunted for low-bush berries only, and found but few of these.\u201d\n137\nThen I said, \u201cWill you take care of these berries, and then go with me to\nlook for more fruit on the high bushes?\u201d But they had made no preparation\nto care for the fruit. There were dishes and sacks in abundance, but they had\nbeen used to hold food. I became tired of waiting, and \ufb01nally asked, \u201cDid\nyou not come to gather fruit? Then why are you not prepared to take care of\nit?\u201d\nOne responded, \u201cSister White, we did not really expect to \ufb01nd any fruit\nwhere there were so many houses, and so much going on; but as you seemed\nso anxious to gather fruit, we decided to come with you. We thought we\nwould bring enough to eat, and would enjoy the recreation, if we did not\ngather any fruit.\u201d\nI answered, \u201cI cannot understand this kind of work. I shall go to the\nbushes again at once. The day is already far spent, soon the night will be here,\nin which we can gather no fruit.\u201d Some went with me, but others remained\nby the wagon to eat.\nIn one place a little company had collected, and were busily talking about\nsomething in which they seemed much interested. I drew near, and found that\na little child in a woman\u2019s arms had attracted their attention. I said, \u201cYou have\nbut a little time, and might better work while you can.\u201d\nThe attention of many was attracted by a young man and a young woman\nwho were running a race to the wagon. On reaching it, they were so tired that\nthey had to sit down and rest. Others also had thrown themselves down on\nthe grass to rest.\nThus the day wore on, and very little was accomplished. At last I said:\n\u201cBrethren, you call this an unsuccessful expedition. If this is the way you\nwork,\n138\nI do not wonder at your lack of success. Your success or failure depends upon\nthe way you take hold of the work. There are berries here; for I have found\nthem. Some of you have been searching the low bushes in vain; others have\nfound a few berries; but the high bushes have been passed by, simply because\nyou did not expect to \ufb01nd fruit on them. You see that the fruit which I have\ngathered is large and ripe. In a little while other berries will ripen, and we\ncan go over the bushes again. This is the way in which I was taught to gather\nfruit. If you had searched near the wagon, you might have found fruit as well\nas I.\n\u201cThe lesson that you have this day given to those who are just learning\nhow to do this kind of work, will be copied by them. The Lord has placed\nthese fruit-bearing bushes right in the midst of these thickly settled places,\nand He expects you to \ufb01nd them. But you have been altogether too much\nengaged in eating, and amusing yourselves. You did not come to the \ufb01eld\nwith an earnest determination to \ufb01nd fruit.\n\u201cYou must hereafter work with more zeal and earnestness, and with an\naltogether different object in view, or your labors will never be successful.\nBy working in the right way, you will teach the younger workers that such\nmatters as eating and recreation are of minor importance. It has been hard\nwork to bring the wagon of supplies to the ground, but you have thought\nmore of the supplies than of the fruit you ought to carry home as the result of\nyour labors. You should be diligent, \ufb01rst to pick the berries nearest you, and\nthen to search for those farther away; after that you can return and work near\nby again, and thus you will be successful.\u201d\n139\nEssentials to Service\nSympathy\nGod desires to unite His workers by a common sympathy, a pure affection.\nIt is the atmosphere of Christlike love surrounding the soul of the believer\nthat makes him a savor of life unto life, and enables God to bless his efforts.\nChristianity builds no walls of separation between man and his fellow-man,\nbut binds human beings to God and to one another.\nMark how tender and pitiful the Lord is in His dealings with His creatures.\nHe loves His erring child, and entreats him to return. The Father\u2019s arm is\nplaced about His repentant son; the Father\u2019s garments cover his rags; the ring\nis placed upon his \ufb01nger as a token of his royalty. And yet how many there\nare who look upon the prodigal not only with indifference, but with contempt.\nLike the Pharisee, they say, \u201cGod, I thank Thee, that I am not as other men,\u201d\n[Luke 18:11.] But how, think you, does God look upon those who, while\nclaiming to be co-workers with Christ, while the soul is making its struggle\nagainst the \ufb02ood of temptation, stand by like the elder brother in the parable,\nstubborn, self-willed, sel\ufb01sh? *****\nHow little do we enter into sympathy with Christ on that which should be\nthe strongest bond of union between us and Him,\u2014compassion for depraved,\nguilty, suffering souls, dead in trespasses and sins! The inhumanity of man\ntoward man is our greatest sin.\n140\nMany think that they are representing the justice of God, while they wholly\nfail of representing His tenderness and His great love. Often the ones whom\nthey meet with sternness and severity are under the stress of temptation. Satan\nis wrestling with these souls, and harsh, unsympathetic words discourage\nthem, and cause them to fall a prey to the tempter\u2019s power....\nWe need more Christlike sympathy; not merely sympathy for those who\nappear to us to be faultless, but sympathy for poor, suffering, struggling\nsouls, who are often overtaken in fault, sinning and repenting, tempted and\ndiscouraged. We are to go to our fellow-men, touched, like our merciful High\nPriest, with the feeling of their in\ufb01rmities.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 163,\n164.\nIntegrity\nMen of tried courage and strong integrity are needed for this time, men\nwho are not afraid to lift their voices for the right. To every laborer I would\nsay, In all your of\ufb01cial duties, let integrity characterize each act. All tithes,\nall moneys entrusted to you for any special purpose, should be promptly\nplaced where they belong. Money given for the cause of God should not\nbe appropriated for personal use, with the thought that it can be replaced later\non. This the Lord forbids. It is a temptation from the one who works evil\nand evil only. The minister who receives funds for the Lord\u2019s treasury should\ngive the donor a written receipt for the same, with the date. Then, without\nwaiting to be tempted by \ufb01nancial pressure to use this means for himself, let\nhim deposit it where, when called for, it will be forthcoming.\n141\nUnion with Christ\nA vital connection with the Chief Shepherd will make the under-shepherd\na living representative of Christ, a light indeed to the world. An understanding\nof all points of our faith is essential, but it is of still greater importance that\nthe minister be sancti\ufb01ed through the truth he presents.\nThe worker who knows the meaning of union with Christ, has a constantly\nincreasing desire and capacity to grasp the meaning of service for God. His\nknowledge enlarges; for to grow in grace means to have an increased ability\nto understand the Scriptures. Such a one is indeed a laborer together with\nGod. He realizes that he is but an instrument, and that he must be passive\nin the Master\u2019s hands. Trials come to him; for unless thus tested, he would\nnever know his lack of wisdom and experience. But if he seeks the Lord with\nhumility and trust, every trial will work for his good. He may sometimes\nseem to fail, but his apparent failure may be God\u2019s way of bringing him true\nadvancement, and may mean a better knowledge of himself and a \ufb01rmer trust\nin Heaven. He may still make mistakes, but he learns not to repeat these\nmistakes. He becomes stronger to resist evil, and others reap bene\ufb01t from his\nexample.\nHumility\nThe minister for God should in an eminent degree possess humility. Those\nwho have the deepest experience in the things of God are the farthest removed\nfrom pride and self-exaltation. Because they have an exalted conception of\nthe glory of God, they feel that the lowest place in His service is too honorable\nfor them.\n142\nWhen Moses came down from the mount after forty days spent in\ncommunion with God, he did not know that his face shone with a brightness\nthat was terrifying to those who beheld.\nPaul had a very humble opinion of his advancement in the Christian life.\nHe speaks of himself as the chief of sinners. And again he says, \u201cNot as\nthough I had already attained, either were already perfect.\u201d [Philippians 3:12.]\nYet Paul had been highly honored by the Lord.\nOur Saviour declared John the Baptist to be the greatest of prophets; yet\nwhen asked if he were the Christ, John declared himself unworthy even to\nunloose his Master\u2019s sandals. When his disciples came with the complaint\nthat all men were turning to the new teacher, John reminded them that he was\nbut the forerunner of the Coming One.\nWorkers with this spirit are needed today. The self-suf\ufb01cient, satis\ufb01ed\nwith themselves, can well be spared from the work of God. Our Lord calls\nfor laborers who, feeling their own need of the atoning blood of Christ, enter\nupon their work, not with boasting or self-suf\ufb01ciency, but with full assurance\nof faith, realizing that they will always need the help of Christ in order to\nknow how to deal with minds.\nEarnestness\nThere is need of greater earnestness. Time is fast passing, and men willing\nto work as Christ worked are needed. It is not enough to live a quiet, prayerful\nlife. Meditation alone will not satisfy the need of the world. Religion is not\nto be a subjective in\ufb02uence in our lives. We are to be wide-awake, energetic,\nearnest Christians, \ufb01lled with a desire to give others the truth.\n143\nPeople need to hear the tidings of salvation through faith in Christ, and\nby earnest, faithful effort the message is to be given to them. Souls are to be\nsought for, prayed for, labored for. Earnest appeals are to be made, fervent\nprayers offered. Our tame, lifeless prayers need to be changed to petitions of\nintense earnestness.\nConsistency\nThe characters of many who profess godliness are imperfect and\none-sided. These show that as pupils in the school of Christ they have learned\ntheir lessons very imperfectly. Some who have learned to imitate Christ in\nmeekness, do not show His diligence in doing good. Others are active and\nzealous, but they are boastful; they have never learned humility. Still others\nleave Christ out of their work. They may be pleasing in their manners; they\nmay show sympathy for their fellow-men; but their hearts are not centered on\nthe Saviour, and they have not learned the language of heaven. They do not\npray as Christ prayed; they do not place His estimate upon souls; they have\nnot learned to endure hardship in their efforts to save souls. Some, knowing\nlittle of the transforming power of grace, become egotistical, critical, harsh.\nOthers are plastic and yielding, bending this way and that to please their\nfellow-men.\nHowever zealously the truth may be advocated, if the every-day life does\nnot testify to its sanctifying power, the words spoken will avail nothing. An\ninconsistent course hardens the heart and narrows the mind of the worker, and\nplaces stumbling-blocks in the way of those for whom he labors.\n144\nThe Daily Life\nThe minister should be free from every unnecessary temporal perplexity,\nthat he may give himself wholly to his sacred calling. He should be much\nin prayer, and should bring himself under discipline to God, that his life may\nreveal the fruits of true self-control. His language should be correct; no slang\nphrases, no cheap utterances, should fall from his lips. His dress should be\nin harmony with the character of the work he is doing. Let ministers and\nteachers strive to reach the standard set forth in the Scriptures. Let them\nnot neglect the little things, which are often looked upon as of no moment.\nNeglect of little things often leads to neglect of larger responsibilities. *****\nWorkers in the Lord\u2019s vineyard have the example of the good in all ages to\nencourage them. They have also the love of God, the ministration of angels,\nthe sympathy of Jesus, and the hope of winning souls to the right. \u201cThey\nthat be wise shall shine as the brightness of the \ufb01rmament; and they that turn\nmany to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.\u201d [Daniel 12:3.]\n145\n146\nSection V . The Minister in\nthe Pulpit\n\u201cPreach the Word\u201d\n\u201cI charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall\njudge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom: Preach the\nword; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all\nlong-suffering and doctrine.\u201d [2 Timothy 4:1, 2.]\nIn these direct and forcible words is made plain the duty of the minister\nof Christ. He is to \u201cpreach the word,\u201d not the opinions and traditions of men,\nnot pleasing fables or sensational stories, to move the fancy and excite the\nemotions. He is not to exalt himself, but as in the presence of God he is to\nstand before a dying world and preach the word. There is to be no levity, no\ntri\ufb02ing, no fanciful interpretation; the minister must speak in sincerity and\ndeep earnestness, as a voice from God expounding the Sacred Scriptures. He\nis to bring to his hearers those things which most concern their present and\neternal good.\nMy ministering brethren, as you stand before the people, speak of those\nthings that are essential, those things that will instruct. Teach the great\npractical truths that must be brought into the life. Teach the saving power\nof Jesus, \u201cin whom we have redemption, ...even the forgiveness of sins.\u201d\n[Colossians 1:14.] Strive to\n147\nmake your hearers comprehend the power of truth.\nMinisters should present the sure word of prophecy as the foundation\nof the faith of Seventh-day Adventists. The prophecies of Daniel and the\nRevelation should be carefully studied, and in connection with them the\nwords, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d\n[John 1:29.]\nThe twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew is presented to me again and again\nas something that is to be brought to the attention of all. We are today living in\nthe time when the predictions of this chapter are ful\ufb01lling. Let our ministers\nand teachers explain these prophecies to those whom they instruct. Let them\nleave out of their discourses matters of minor consequence, and present the\ntruths that will decide the destiny of souls.\nThe time in which we are living calls for constant vigilance, and God\u2019s\nministers are to present the light on the Sabbath question. They should warn\nthe inhabitants of the world that Christ is soon to come with power and great\nglory. The last message of warning to the world is to lead men to see the\nimportance that God attaches to his law. So plainly is the truth to be presented\nthat no transgressor, hearing it, shall be excusable in failing to discern the\nimportance of obedience to God\u2019s commands.\nI am instructed to say, Gather from the Scriptures the proofs that God\nhas sancti\ufb01ed the seventh day, and let these proofs be read before the\ncongregation. Let those who have not heard the truth be shown that all who\nturn aside from a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d must suffer the result of their\ncourse. In all ages the Sabbath has been the test of loyalty to God. \u201cIt is a\n148\nsign between Me and the children of Israel forever,\u201d the Lord declares.\n[Exodus 31:17.]\nPolicy in Sacred Things\nThe gospel is now opposed on every side. Never was the confederacy\nof evil stronger than at the present time. Spirits of evil are combining\nwith human agencies to war against the commandments of God. Tradition\nand falsehood are exalted above the Scriptures; reason and science above\nrevelation; human talent above the teaching of the Spirit; forms and\nceremonies above the vital power of godliness. Grievous sins have separated\nthe people from God. In\ufb01delity is fast becoming fashionable. \u201cWe will not\nhave this man to reign over us,\u201d is the language of thousands. God\u2019s ministers\nmust lift up the voice like a trumpet, and show the people their transgressions.\nThe smooth sermons so often preached make no lasting impression. Men are\nnot cut to the heart, because the plain, sharp truths of the word of God are not\nspoken to them.\nMany of those who profess to believe the truth would say, if they\nexpressed their real sentiments, What need is there of speaking so plainly?\nThey might as well ask, Why need John the Baptist have said to the Pharisees,\n\u201cO generation of vipers, who hath warned you to \ufb02ee from the wrath to\ncome?\u201d [Matthew 3:7.] Why need he have provoked the anger of Herodias\nby telling Herod that it was unlawful for him to live with his brother\u2019s wife?\nHe lost his life by speaking so plainly. Why could he not have moved along\nwithout incurring the anger of Herodias?\n149\nSo men have argued, till policy has taken the place of faithfulness. Sin\nis allowed to go unrebuked. When will be heard once more in the church\nthe voice of faithful rebuke, \u201cThou art the man\u201d? [See 2 Samuel 12:7.] If\nthese words were not so rare, we should see more of the power of God. The\nLord\u2019s messengers should not complain of their efforts\u2019 being fruitless until\nthey repent of their love of approbation, their desire to please men, which\nleads them to suppress the truth, and to cry, Peace, when God has not spoken\npeace.\nWould that every minister of God realized the holiness of his work and\nthe sacredness of his calling. As divinely appointed messengers, ministers\nare in a position of awful responsibility. In Christ\u2019s stead they are to labor as\nstewards of the mysteries of heaven, encouraging the obedient and warning\nthe disobedient. Worldly policy is to have no weight with them. Never are\nthey to swerve from the path in which Jesus has bidden them walk. They are\nto go forward in faith, remembering that they are surrounded by a cloud of\nwitnesses. They are not to speak their own words, but the words that One\ngreater than the potentates of earth has bidden them speak. Their message is\nto be, \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d\nGod calls for men who, like Nathan, Elijah, and John, will bear His\nmessage with fearlessness, regardless of consequences; who will speak the\ntruth, though to do this calls for the sacri\ufb01ce of all they have.\nAs Sharp Arrows\nThe words of Christ were as sharp arrows, which went to the mark and\nwounded the hearts of His hearers. Every time He addressed the people,\nwhether\n150\nHis audience was large or small, His words took saving effect upon the soul of\nsome one. No message that fell from His lips was lost. Every word He spoke\nplaced a new responsibility upon those who heard. And today the ministers\nwho in sincerity are giving the last message of mercy to the world, relying\non God for strength, need not fear that their efforts will be in vain. Although\nno human eye can see the path of the arrow of truth, who can say that the\narrow has not sped to the mark, and pierced the souls of those who listened?\nAlthough no human ear has heard the cry of the wounded soul, yet the truth\nhas silently cut its way to the heart. God has spoken to the soul; and in the\nday of \ufb01nal account, His faithful ministers will stand with the trophies of\nredeeming grace, to give honor to Christ.\nNo one can tell what is lost by attempting to preach without the unction\nof the Holy Spirit. In every congregation there are souls who are hesitating,\nalmost decided to be wholly for God. Decisions are being made; but too often\nthe minister has not the spirit and power of the message, and no direct appeals\nare made to those who are trembling in the balance.\nIn this age of moral darkness, it will take something more than dry theory\nto move souls. Ministers must have a living connection with God. They must\npreach as if they believe what they say. Living truths, falling from the lips of\nthe man of God, will cause sinners to tremble, and the convicted to cry out,\nJehovah is my God; I am resolved to be wholly on the Lord\u2019s side.\nNever should the messenger of God cease his strivings for greater light\nand power. He should toil on,\n151\npray on, hope on, amid discouragement and darkness, determined to gain a\nthorough knowledge of the Scriptures and to come behind in no gift. As long\nas there is one soul to be bene\ufb01ted, he should press forward with new courage\nat every effort. So long as Jesus has said, \u201cI will never leave thee, nor forsake\nthee,\u201d [Hebrews 13:5.] so long as the crown of righteousness is offered to the\novercomer, so long as our Advocate pleads in the sinner\u2019s behalf, ministers of\nChrist should labor with hopeful, tireless energy and persevering faith.\nMen who assume the responsibility of giving to the people the word from\nthe mouth of God, make themselves accountable for the in\ufb02uence they exert\non their hearers. If they are true men of God, they will know that the object\nof preaching is not to entertain. It is not merely to convey information, nor to\nconvince the intellect.\nThe preaching of the word should appeal to the intellect and should impart\nknowledge, but it should do more than this. The minister\u2019s utterances, to be\neffectual, must reach the hearts of his hearers. He should not bring amusing\nstories into his preaching. He must strive to understand the soul\u2019s great need\nand longing. As he stands before his congregation, let him remember that\nthere are among his hearers those who are wrestling with doubt, almost in\ndespair, well-nigh hopeless; those who, constantly harassed by temptation,\nare \ufb01ghting a hard battle with the adversary of souls. Let him ask the Saviour\nto give him words to speak that will strengthen these souls for the con\ufb02ict\nwith evil.\n152\nBreaking the Bread of Life to Souls\nMany of those for whom our ministers labor are ignorant of the truths of\nthe Bible and the requirements of God, and the simplest lessons on practical\ngodliness come to them as a new revelation. These need to know what is truth,\nand in laboring for them the minister should not take up lines of thought that\nwill simply please the fancy or gratify curiosity. Let him instead break the\nbread of life to these starving souls. Never should he preach a sermon that\ndoes not help his hearers to see more plainly what they must do to be saved.\nThe immediate requirements, the present trials\u2014for these, men and\nwomen need present help. The minister may take a high range into the\nheavens by poetical descriptions and fanciful presentations, which please the\nsenses and feed the imagination, but which do not touch the life experience,\nthe daily necessities. He may think that by his fanciful eloquence he has fed\nthe \ufb02ock of God; his hearers may think that they never before saw the truth\nclothed in language so beautiful. But trace, from cause to effect, the ecstasy\nof feeling caused by these fanciful representations, and it will be seen that\nalthough some truths may have been presented, such sermons do not fortify\nthe hearers for the daily battles of life.\nHe who in his preaching makes eloquence his highest aim, causes the\npeople to forget the truth that is mingled with his oratory. When the emotion\nhas passed away, it will be found that the word of God has\n153\nnot been fastened upon the mind, nor have the hearers gained in\nunderstanding. They make speak in terms of admiration of the minister\u2019s\neloquence, but they are not brought any nearer to the point of decision. They\nspeak of the sermon as they would of a play, and of the minister as they would\nof an actor. They may come again to listen to the same kind of discourse, but\nthey will go away unimpressed and unfed.\nIt is not \ufb02owery discourses that are needed, not a \ufb02ood of words without\nmeaning. Our ministers are to preach in a way that will help people to\ngrasp vital truth. My brethren, do not soar where the common people cannot\nfollow you, and if they could, would be neither bene\ufb01ted nor blessed. Teach\nthe simple lessons given by Christ. Tell the story of His life of self-denial\nand sacri\ufb01ce, His humiliation and death, His resurrection and ascension, His\nintercession for sinners in the courts above. In every congregation there are\nsouls upon whom the Spirit of the Lord is moving. Help them to understand\nwhat is truth; break the bread of life to them; call their attention to vital\nquestions.\nMany voices are advocating error; let your voice advocate truth. Present\nsubjects that will be as green pastures to the sheep of God\u2019s fold. Do not\nlead your hearers into waste tracts, where they will be no nearer the fountain\nof living water than they were before hearing you. Present the truth as it is\nin Jesus, making plain the requirements of the law and the gospel. Present\nChrist, the way, the truth, and the life, and tell of His power to save all who\ncome to Him. The Captain of our salvation is interceding for His people, not\nas a petitioner to move the Father to compassion, but as a conqueror, who\nclaims the trophies of His victory.\n154\nHe is able to save to the uttermost all who come to God by Him. Make this\nfact very plain\nUnless ministers are guarded, they will hide the truth under human\nornamentation. Let no minister suppose that he can convert souls by eloquent\nsermons. Those who teach others should plead with God to imbue them with\nHis Spirit, and enable them to lift up Christ as the sinner\u2019s only hope. Flowery\nspeeches, pleasing tales, or inappropriate anecdotes do not convict the sinner.\nMen listen to such words as they would to a pleasant song. The message that\nthe sinner should hear is, \u201cGod so loved the world, that He gave His only\nbegotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have\neverlasting life.\u201d [John 3:16.] The reception of the gospel does not depend\non learned testimonies, eloquent speeches, or deep arguments, but upon its\nsimplicity, and its adaptation to those who are hungering for the bread of life.\nIt is the ef\ufb01ciency of the Holy Spirit that makes the ministry of the word\neffective. When Christ speaks through the minister, the Holy Spirit prepares\nthe hearts of the listeners to receive the word. The Holy Spirit is not a servant,\nbut a controlling power. He causes the truth to shine into minds, and speaks\nthrough every discourse where the minister surrenders himself to the divine\nworking. It is the Spirit that surrounds the soul with a holy atmosphere, and\nspeaks to the impenitent through words of warning, pointing them to Him\nwho takes away the sin of the world.\n155\nPreaching Christ\nMany remarks have been made to the effect that in their discourses our\nspeakers have dwelt upon the law, and not upon Jesus. This statement is not\nstrictly true, but is there not some reason for it? Have there not stood in the\ndesk men who have not had a genuine experience in the things of God, men\nwho have not received the righteousness of Christ? Many of our ministers\nhave merely sermonized, presenting subjects in an argumentative way, and\nscarcely mentioning the saving power of the Redeemer. Their testimony was\ndestitute of the saving blood of Christ. Their offering resembled the offering\nof Cain. He brought to the Lord the fruit of the ground, which in itself was\nacceptable in God\u2019s sight. Very good indeed was the fruit; but the virtue of the\noffering\u2014the blood of the slain lamb, representing the blood of Christ\u2014was\nlacking. So it is with Christless sermons. By them men are not pricked to the\nheart; they are not led to inquire, What must I do to be saved?\nOf all professing Christians, Seventh-day Adventists should be foremost\nin uplifting Christ before the world. The proclamation of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage calls for the presentation of the Sabbath truth. This truth, with others\nincluded in the message, is to be proclaimed; but the great center of attraction,\nChrist Jesus, must not be left out. It is at the cross of Christ that mercy and\ntruth meet together, and righteousness and peace kiss each other. The sinner\nmust be led to look to Calvary; with the simple faith of a little child\n156\nhe must trust in the merits of the Saviour, accepting His righteousness,\nbelieving in His mercy.\nThe Love of God\nThrough the love of God the treasures of the grace of Christ have been\nlaid open before the church and the world. \u201cGod so loved the world, that\nHe gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not\nperish, but have everlasting life.\u201d [John 3:16.] What marvelous, unfathomable\nlove, which led Christ to die for us while we were yet sinners! And what a\nloss the soul suffers who, understanding the strong claims of the law, fails\nto acknowledge that where sin abounds, the grace of Christ does much more\nabound!\nWhen the law is presented as it should be, it reveals the love of God. But\nit is no wonder that hearts are not melted even by truth when it is presented in\na cold, lifeless manner; no wonder that faith staggers at the promises of God,\nwhen ministers and workers fail to present Jesus in His relation to the law.\nSome workers in the cause of God have been too ready to hurl\ndenunciations against the sinner; the love of the Father in giving His Son\nto die for the race, has been kept in the background. Let the teacher of truth\nmake known to the sinner what God really is,\u2014a Father waiting with yearning\nlove to receive the returning prodigal, not hurling at him accusations of wrath,\nbut preparing a feast to welcome his return. O that we might all learn the way\nof the Lord in winning souls!\nGod would draw minds from the conviction of logic to a conviction\ndeeper, higher, purer, and more glorious. Often human logic has nearly\nquenched the light\n157\nthat God would have shine forth in clear rays to convince men that the Lord\nof nature is worthy of all praise and glory, because He is the Creator of all\nthings.\nSome ministers err in making their sermons wholly argumentative. There\nare those who listen to the theory of the truth, and are impressed with the\nevidences brought out; then, if Christ is presented as the Saviour of the world,\nthe seed sown may spring up and bear fruit to the glory of God. But often the\ncross of Calvary is not presented before the people. Some may be listening\nto the last sermon they will ever hear, and the golden opportunity, lost, is lost\nforever. If in connection with the theory of the truth, Christ and His redeeming\nlove had been proclaimed, these might have been won to His side.\nThe Way to Christ\nMore people than we think are longing to \ufb01nd the way to Christ. Those\nwho preach the last message of mercy should bear in mind that Christ is\nto be exalted as the sinner\u2019s refuge. Some ministers think that it is not\nnecessary to preach repentance and faith; they take it for granted that their\nhearers are acquainted with the gospel, and that matters of a different nature\nmust be presented in order to hold their attention. But many people are sadly\nignorant in regard to the plan of salvation; they need more instruction upon\nthis all-important subject than upon any other.\nTheoretical discourses are essential, that people may see the chain of\ntruth, link after link, uniting in a perfect whole; but no discourse should ever\nbe preached without presenting Christ and Him cruci\ufb01ed as the foundation of\nthe gospel. Ministers would\n158\nreach more hearts if they would dwell more upon practical godliness.\nFrequently, when efforts are made to present the truth in new \ufb01elds, the\ndiscourses given are largely theoretical. The people are unsettled by what\nthey hear. Many see the force of the truth, and are anxious to place their feet\nupon a sure foundation. Then is the time, above all others, to urge home upon\nthe conscience the religion of Christ. If the meetings are allowed to close\nwithout this practical work, there is great loss.\nSometimes men and women decide in favor of the truth because of the\nweight of evidence presented, without being converted. The minister\u2019s work\nis not done until he has urged upon his hearers the necessity of a change of\nheart. In every discourse fervent appeals should be made to the people to\nforsake their sins and turn to Christ. The popular sins and indulgences of our\nday should be condemned, and practical godliness enjoined. Feeling from\nthe heart the importance of the words he utters, the true minister is unable to\nrepress his concern for the souls of those for whom he labors.\nO that I could command language of suf\ufb01cient force to make the\nimpression that I wish to make upon my fellow-laborers in the gospel. My\nbrethren, you are handling the words of life; you are dealing with minds that\nare capable of the highest development. Christ cruci\ufb01ed, Christ risen, Christ\nascended into the heavens, Christ coming again, should so soften, gladden,\nand \ufb01ll the mind of the minister that he will present these truths to the people\nin love and deep earnestness. The minister will then be lost sight of and Jesus\nwill be made manifest.\n159\nLift up Jesus, you that teach the people, lift Him up in sermon, in song,\nin prayer. Let all your powers be directed to pointing souls, confused,\nbewildered, lost, to \u201cthe Lamb of God.\u201d Lift Him up, the risen Saviour,\nand say to all who hear, Come to Him who \u201chath loved us, and hath given\nHimself for us.\u201d [Ephesians 5:2.] Let the science of salvation be the burden\nof every sermon, the theme of every song. Let it be poured forth in every\nsupplication. Bring nothing into your preaching to supplement Christ, the\nwisdom and power of God. Hold forth the word of life, presenting Jesus as\nthe hope of the penitent and the stronghold of every believer. Reveal the way\nof peace to the troubled and the despondent, and show forth the grace and\ncompleteness of the Saviour. *****\nThere is only one path that leads from darkness upward to the light until\nit touches the throne of God,\u2014the path of faith. This path is not dark and\nuncertain; it is not the way of \ufb01nite minds, not a path made by human hands,\nin which toll is exacted from every traveler. Entrance to it cannot be gained\nby works of penance.\nThe way that God has provided is so complete, so perfect, that man\ncannot, by any works that he can do, add to its perfection. It is broad enough\nto receive the most hardened sinner, if he truly repents, and yet so narrow that\nin it sin can \ufb01nd no place. This is the path cast up for the ransomed of the\nLord to walk in.\n160\nRighteousness By Faith\nThe thought that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to us, not because\nof any merit on our part, but as a free gift from God, is a precious thought.\nThe enemy of God and man is not willing that this truth should be clearly\npresented; for he knows that if the people receive it fully, his power will be\nbroken. If he can control minds so that doubt and unbelief and darkness shall\ncompose the experience of those who claim to be the children of God, he can\novercome them with temptation.\nThat simple faith which takes God at His word should be encouraged.\nGod\u2019s people must have that faith which will lay hold of divine power; \u201cfor\nby grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift\nof God.\u201d [Ephesians 2:8.] Those who believe that God for Christ\u2019s sake has\nforgiven their sins, should not, through temptation, fail to press on to \ufb01ght the\ngood \ufb01ght of faith. Their faith should grow stronger until their Christian life,\nas well as their words, shall declare, \u201cThe blood of Jesus Christ ...cleanseth\nus from all sin.\u201d [1 John 1:7.]\nIf we would have the spirit and power of the third angel\u2019s message, we\nmust present the law and the gospel together, for they go hand in hand. As a\npower from beneath is stirring up the children of disobedience to make void\nthe law of God, and to trample upon the truth that Christ is our righteousness,\na power from above is moving upon the hearts of those who are loyal, to exalt\nthe law, and to lift up Jesus as a complete\n161\nSaviour. Unless divine power is brought into the experience of the people\nof God, false theories and ideas will take minds captive, Christ and His\nrighteousness will be dropped out of the experience of many, and their faith\nwill be without power or life.\nMinisters are to present Christ in His fulness both in the churches and in\nnew \ufb01elds, that the hearers may have an intelligent faith. The people must be\ninstructed that Christ is unto them salvation and righteousness. It is Satan\u2019s\nstudied purpose to keep souls from believing in Christ as their only hope; for\nthe blood of Christ that cleanseth from all sin is ef\ufb01cacious in behalf of those\nonly who believe in its merit, and who present it before the Father as did Abel\nin his offering.\nThe offering of Cain was an offense to God, because it was a Christless\noffering. The burden of our message is not only the commandments of God,\nbut the faith of Jesus. A bright light shines upon our pathway today, and\nit leads to increased faith in Jesus. We must receive every ray of light, and\nwalk in it, that it may not be our condemnation in the judgment. Our duties\nand obligations become more important as we obtain more distinct views of\ntruth. Light makes manifest and reproves the errors that were concealed in\ndarkness; and as light comes, the life and character of men must change\ncorrespondingly, to be in harmony with it. Sins that were once sins of\nignorance, because of the blindness of the mind, can no more be indulged\nin without incurring guilt. As increased light is given, men must be reformed,\nelevated, and re\ufb01ned by it, or they will be more perverse and stubborn than\nbefore the light came.\n162\nCounsel To An Evangelist\nDear Brother:\n...I have this message for you from the Lord: Be kind in speech, gentle\nin action. Guard yourself carefully, for you are inclined to be severe and\ndictatorial, and to say rash things. The Lord speaks to you, saying, Watch\nand pray, lest ye enter into temptation. Harsh expressions grieve the Lord;\nunwise words do harm. I am charged to say to you, Be gentle in your speech;\nwatch well your words; let no harshness come into your utterances or into\nyour gestures. Bring into all you do and say the fragrance of Christlikeness.\nLet not natural traits of character mar and spoil your work. You are to help\nand strengthen the tempted. Let not self appear in rash words. Christ has\ngiven His life for the \ufb02ock, and for all for whom you labor. Let no word of\nyours balance souls in the wrong direction. In the minister of Christ there\nmust be revealed Christlikeness of character.\nRash, overbearing expressions do not harmonize with the sacred work\nthat Christ has given His ministers to do. When the daily experience is one\nof looking unto Jesus and learning of Him, you will reveal a wholesome,\nharmonious character. Soften your representations, and let not condemnatory\nwords be spoken. Learn of the great Teacher. Words of kindness and\nsympathy will do good as a medicine, and will heal souls that are in despair.\nThe knowledge of the word of God brought into the practical life will have a\nhealing, soothing power. Harshness of speech\n163\nwill never bring blessing to yourself or to any other soul.\nMy brother, you are to be a representative of the mildness and\npatience and goodness of Christ. In your talks before the public, let your\nrepresentations be after Christ\u2019s order. \u201cThe wisdom that is from above is\n\ufb01rst pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and\ngood fruits.\u201d [James 3:17.] Watch and pray, and subdue the harshness which\nat times breaks out in you. By the grace of Christ dwelling in you, your\nwords may become sancti\ufb01ed. If your brethren do not act just as you think\nthey should, do not meet them with harshness. The Lord has been grieved at\ntimes by your severe expressions.\nYour will is to be yielded to the Lord\u2019s will. You need the help of the Lord\nJesus. Let only words that are clean and pure and sancti\ufb01ed come from your\nlips; for as a minister of the gospel, your spirit and example will be followed\nby others. Be kind and tender to children at all times....\nYou may reach God\u2019s ideal if you will resolve that self shall not be woven\ninto your work. To know that you are striving in spirit and in works to be\nChristlike, will give you strength and comfort and courage. It is your privilege\nto become meek and lowly in heart; then angels of God will co-operate with\nyou in your revival efforts. Christ died that His life might be lived in you, and\nin all who make Him their example. In the strength of your Redeemer you\ncan reveal the character of Christ, and you can work in wisdom and in power\nto make the crooked places straight.\nLos Angeles, Cal., Aug. 22, 1908.\n164\nPractical Suggestions\nFormal Discourses.\u2014Some ministers, in the preparation of their\ndiscourses, arrange every detail with such exactness that they give the Lord\nno room to lead their minds. Every point is \ufb01xed, stereotyped, as it were,\nand they seem unable to depart from the plan marked out. This is a grave\nerror, and if followed, will cause ministers to become narrow-minded, and\nwill leave them as destitute of spiritual life and energy as were the hills of\nGilboa of dew and rain.\nWhen a minister feels that he cannot vary from a set discourse, the effect is\nlittle better than that produced by reading a sermon. Tame, formal discourses\nhave in them very little of the vitalizing power of the Holy Spirit; and the habit\nof preaching such discourses will effectually destroy a minister\u2019s usefulness\nand ability.\nGod would have His workmen wholly dependent upon Him. They must\nlisten to hear what saith the Lord, asking, What is Thy word for the people?\nTheir hearts should be open, so that God may impress their minds, and then\nthey will be able to give the people truth fresh from heaven. The Holy Spirit\nwill give them ideas adapted to meet the needs of those present. *****\nReverence.\u2014I have heard some ministers talk of Christ\u2019s life and\nteachings in a commonplace manner, as if recounting incidents in the life\nof some great man of the world. Indeed, it is not unusual for ministers to\nspeak of Christ as if He were a man like themselves.\n165\nWhen I hear this sacred subject treated in such a manner, I feel a grief that I\ncannot express; for I know that although these men are teachers of truth, they\nhave never had exalted views of Christ; they have never become acquainted\nwith Him. They have not that elevation of thought which would give them a\nclear conception of the character of the world\u2019s Redeemer.\nThose who have a correct view of the character and work of Christ, will\nnot become self-suf\ufb01cient or self-exalted. The weakness and inef\ufb01ciency of\ntheir own efforts, in contrast with those of the Son of God, will keep them\nhumble, distrustful of self, and will lead them to rely on Christ for strength to\ndo their work. Habitually dwelling upon Christ and His all-suf\ufb01cient merits,\nincreases faith, quickens the power of spiritual discernment, strengthens the\ndesire to be like Him, and brings an earnestness into prayer that makes it\nef\ufb01cacious.\nIrrelevant Anecdotes.\u2014Ministers should not make a practice of relating\nirrelevant anecdotes in connection with their sermons; for this detracts from\nthe force of the truth presented. The relation of anecdotes or incidents that\ncreate a laugh or a light thought in the minds of the hearers is severely\ncensurable. The truth should be clothed in chaste, digni\ufb01ed language; and\nthe illustrations used should be of a like character. *****\nHow to Overcome Inattention.\u2014Often a minister is obliged to preach in\na crowded, overheated room. The listeners become drowsy, their senses are\nbenumbed, and it is almost impossible for them to grasp the truths presented.\n166\nIf, instead of preaching to them, the speaker would try to teach them,\nspeaking in a conversational tone and asking them questions, their minds\nwould be aroused to activity, and they would be able more clearly to\ncomprehend the words spoken. *****\nSmall Congregations.\u2014Do not become discouraged when there are only a\nfew present to listen to a discourse. Even if you have but two or three hearers,\nwho knows whether there may not be one with whom the Spirit of the Lord\nis striving? The Lord may give you a message for that one soul, and he, if\nconverted, may be the means of reaching others. All unknown to you, the\nresults of your labor may be multiplied a thousand-fold.\nDo not look at the empty seats, and let your faith and courage sink; but\nthink of what God is doing to bring His truth before the world. Remember that\nyou are co-operating with divine agencies\u2014agencies that never fail. Speak\nwith as much earnestness, faith, and interest as if there were thousands present\nto listen to your voice.\nA minister went to his church to preach one rainy morning, and found that\nhe had only one man for an audience. But he would not disappoint his hearer,\nand he preached to him with earnestness and interest. As a result, the man\nwas converted, and became a missionary, and through his efforts thousands\nheard the good news of salvation. *****\nShort Sermons.\u2014Let the message for this time be presented, not in long,\nlabored discourses, but in short\n167\ntalks, right to the point. Lengthy sermons tax the strength of the speaker and\nthe patience of his hearers. If the speaker is one who feels the importance of\nhis message, he will need to be especially careful lest he overtax his physical\npowers, and give the people more than they can remember.\nDo not think, when you have gone over a subject once, that your hearers\nwill retain in their minds all that you have presented. There is danger of\npassing too rapidly from point to point. Give short lessons, in plain, simple\nlanguage, and let them be often repeated. Short sermons will be remembered\nfar better than long ones. Our speakers should remember that the subjects they\nare presenting may be new to some of their hearers; therefore the principal\npoints should be gone over again and again. *****\nDirectness.\u2014Many speakers waste their time and strength in long\npreliminaries and excuses. Some use nearly half an hour in making apologies;\nthus time is wasted, and when they reach their subject and try to fasten the\npoints of truth in the minds of their hearers, the people are wearied out and\ncannot see their force.\nInstead of apologizing because he is about to address the people, the\nminister should begin as if he knew that he was bearing a message from God.\nHe should make the essential points of truth as distinct as mile-posts, so that\nthe people cannot fail to see them.\nTime is frequently lost in explaining points which are really unimportant,\nand which would be taken for granted without producing proofs. But the vital\n168\npoints should be made as plain and forcible as language and proof can make\nthem. *****\nConcentration.\u2014Some have cultivated the habit of too great concentrativeness.\nThe power to \ufb01x the mind upon one subject to the exclusion of all others,\nis good to a limited degree, but those who put the whole strength of the\nmind into one line of thought are frequently de\ufb01cient on other points. In\nconversation these become tedious, and weary the listener. Their writings\nlack a free, easy style. When they speak in public, the subject before them\nholds their attention, and they are led on and on, to go deeper and deeper into\nthe matter. They seem to see knowledge and light as they become interested\nand absorbed, but there are few who can follow them.\nThere is danger that such men will plant the seed of truth so deep that the\ntender blade will never \ufb01nd the surface. Even the most essential, manifest\ntruths, those which are of themselves clear and plain, may be so covered up\nwith words as to be made cloudy and indistinct. *****\nSimplicity.\u2014Argument is good in its place, but far more can be\naccomplished by simple explanations of the word of God. The lessons\nof Christ were illustrated so clearly that the most ignorant could readily\ncomprehend them. Jesus did not use long and dif\ufb01cult words in His\ndiscourses; He used plain language, adapted to the minds of the common\npeople. He went no farther into the subject He was expounding than they\nwere able to follow Him.\n169\nMinisters should present the truth in a clear, simple manner. There are\namong their hearers many who need a plain explanation of the steps requisite\nin conversion. The great masses of the people are more ignorant on this\npoint than is supposed. Among graduates from college, eloquent orators, able\nstatesmen, men in high positions of trust, there are many who have given their\npowers to other matters, and have neglected the things of greatest importance.\nWhen such men form part of a congregation, the speaker often strains every\npower to preach an intellectual discourse, and fails to reveal Christ. He does\nnot show that sin is the transgression of the law. He does not make plain the\nplan of salvation. That which would have touched the hearts of his hearers,\nwould have been to point them to Christ dying to bring redemption within\ntheir reach. *****\nRevivals.\u2014When the Lord works through human instrumentalities, when\nmen are moved with power from on high, Satan leads his agents to cry,\n\u201cFanaticism!\u201d and to warn people not to go to extremes. Let all be careful\nhow they raise this cry; for though there is counterfeit coin, this does not\nlower the value of that which is genuine. Because there are spurious revivals\nand spurious conversions, it does not follow that all revivals are to be held in\nsuspicion. Let us not show the contempt manifested by the Pharisees when\nthey said, \u201cThis man receiveth sinners.\u201d [Luke 15:2.]\nThere is enough in the life of Christ to teach us not to sneer at His work in\nthe conversion of souls. The manifestation of God\u2019s renewing grace on sinful\nmen\n170\ncauses angels to rejoice, but often this work has, through unbelief, been\ntermed fanaticism, and the messenger through whom God has worked has\nbeen spoken of as having zeal that is not according to knowledge. *****\nSabbath Services.\u2014The one appointed to conduct Sabbath services\nshould study how to interest his hearers in the truths of the Word. He should\nnot always give so long a discourse that there will be no opportunity for those\npresent to confess Christ. The sermon should frequently be short, so that the\npeople may express their thanksgiving to God. Gratitude-offerings glorify the\nname of the Lord. In every assembly of the saints holy angels listen to the\npraise offered to Jehovah in testimony, song, and prayer.\nThe prayer and social meeting should be a season of special help and\nencouragement. All should feel it a privilege to take part. Let every one who\nbears the name of Christ have something to say in the social meeting. The\ntestimonies should be short, and of a nature to help others. Nothing will so\ncompletely kill the spirit of devotion as for one person to take up twenty or\nthirty minutes in a long testimony. This means death to the spirituality of the\nmeeting.\n171\nCarefulness in Manners and Dress\nThe minister must remember that favorable or unfavorable impressions\nare made upon his hearers by his deportment in the pulpit, his attitude, his\nmanner of speaking, his dress. He should cultivate courtesy and re\ufb01nement of\nmanner, and should carry himself with a quiet dignity becoming to his high\ncalling. Solemnity and a certain godly authority mingled with meekness,\nshould characterize his demeanor. Coarseness and rudeness are not to be\ntolerated in the common walks of life, much less should they be permitted in\nthe work of the ministry. The minister\u2019s attitude should be in harmony with\nthe holy truths he proclaims. His words should be in every respect earnest\nand well chosen.\nMinisters have no license to behave in the desk like theatrical performers,\nassuming attitudes and making expressions merely for effect. They are not\nactors, but teachers of truth. Undigni\ufb01ed, boisterous actions lend no force\nto the truth uttered; on the contrary, they disgust men and women of calm\njudgment and right views.\nThe minister who has learned of Christ will ever be conscious that he is a\nmessenger of God, commissioned by Him to do a work the in\ufb02uence of which\nis to endure throughout eternity. It should not be any part of his object to call\nattention to himself, his learning, or his ability. His whole aim should be to\nbring sinners to repentance, pointing them, by both precept and example, to\nthe Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. He should speak as\none conscious\n172\nof possessing power and authority from God. His discourses should have an\nearnestness, a fervor, a power of persuasion, that will lead sinners to take\nrefuge in Christ.\nCarefulness in dress is an important consideration. The minister should\nbe clothed in a manner be\ufb01tting the dignity of his position. Some ministers\nhave failed in this respect. In some cases not only has there been a lack of\ntaste and of orderly arrangement in the dress, but the clothing has been untidy\nand slovenly.\nThe God of heaven, whose arm moves the world, who gives us life\nand sustains us in health, is honored or dishonored by the apparel of those\nwho of\ufb01ciate in His honor. To Moses He gave special instruction regarding\neverything connected with the tabernacle service, and He speci\ufb01ed the dress\nthat those should wear who were to minister before Him. \u201cThou shalt make\nholy garments for Aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty,\u201d [Exodus 28:2]\nwas the direction given to Moses. Everything connected with the apparel and\ndeportment of the priests was to be such as to impress the beholder with a\nsense of the holiness of God, the sacredness of His worship, and the purity\nrequired of those who came into His presence.\nThe priests were not allowed to enter the sanctuary with their shoes on\ntheir feet; for the particles of dust cleaving to them would desecrate the\nholy place. They were to leave their shoes in the court before entering the\nsanctuary, and also to wash their hands and their feet before ministering in\nthe tabernacle or at the altar of burnt-offering. Thus was constantly taught the\nlesson that all de\ufb01lement must be put away from those who would come into\nthe presence of God.\n173\nThe in\ufb02uence of the minister who is careless in his dress is displeasing\nto God, and the impression made upon his hearers is that he looks upon the\nwork in which he is engaged as no more sacred than common labor. And not\nonly this, but instead of showing them the importance of propriety and taste\nin clothing, he sets them an example of slackness and untidiness, which some\nare not slow to follow.\nGod expects His ministers, in their manners and in their dress, to give\na \ufb01tting representation of the principles of truth and the sacredness of their\nof\ufb01ce. They are to set an example that will help men and women to reach a\nhigh standard. *****\nMen have the power to quench the Spirit of God; the power of choosing\nis left with them. They are allowed freedom of action. They may be obedient\nthrough the name and grace of our Redeemer, or they may be disobedient,\nand realize the consequences.\nMan is responsible for receiving or rejecting sacred and eternal truth. The\nSpirit of God is continually convicting, and souls are deciding for or against\nthe truth. How important, then, that every act of life be such that it need not\nbe repented of, especially among the ambassadors of Christ, who are acting\nin His stead!\n174\nPublic Prayer\nThe prayers offered in public should be short and to the point. God does\nnot require us to make the season of worship tedious by lengthy petitions.\nChrist did not enforce upon His disciples wearisome ceremonies and long\nprayers. \u201cWhen thou prayest,\u201d He said, \u201cthou shalt not be as the hypocrites\nare: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the\nstreets, that they may be seen of men.\u201d [Matthew 6:5.]\nThe Pharisees had stated hours for prayer; and when, as often came to\npass, they were abroad at the appointed time, they would pause wherever\nthey might be,\u2014perhaps in the street or in the marketplace, amid the hurrying\nthrong of men,\u2014and there in a loud voice rehearse their formal prayers. Such\nworship, offered merely for self-glori\ufb01cation, called forth unsparing rebuke\nfrom Jesus. Yet he did not discountenance public prayer; for He Himself\nprayed with His disciples and with the multitude. But He impressed upon His\ndisciples the thought that their public prayers should be short.\nA few minutes is long enough for any ordinary public petition. There may\nbe instances where supplication is in a special manner indited by the Spirit of\nGod. The yearning soul becomes agonized, and groans after God. The spirit\nwrestles as did Jacob, and will not be at rest without the special manifestation\nof the power of God. At such times it may be \ufb01tting that the petition be of\ngreater length.\nMany tedious prayers are offered, which are more like giving the Lord a\nlecture than presenting to Him a\n175\nrequest. It would be better if those offering such prayers would con\ufb01ne\nthemselves to the one that Christ taught His disciples to offer. Long prayers\nare tiring to those who hear, and do not prepare the people to listen to the\ninstruction that is to follow.\nIt is often because secret prayer is neglected that long, tedious prayers\nare offered in public. Let not ministers go over in their petitions a week of\nneglected duties, hoping to atone for their neglect and to pacify conscience.\nSuch prayers frequently result in bringing others down to a low level of\nspirituality.\nBefore entering the desk, the minister should seek God in his closet, and\ncome into close connection with Him. There he may lift his thirsty soul to\nGod, and be refreshed with the dew of grace. Then with an unction from the\nHoly Spirit upon him, giving him a burden for souls, he will not dismiss a\ncongregation without presenting before them Jesus Christ, the sinner\u2019s only\nrefuge. Feeling that he many never again meet these hearers, he will make\nappeals that will reach their hearts. And the Master, who knows the hearts\nof men, will give him utterance, helping him to speak the words he ought to\nspeak at the right time and with power.\nReverence in Prayer\nSome think it a mark of humility to pray to God in a common manner,\nas if talking with a human being. They profane His name by needlessly and\nirreverently mingling with their prayers the words, \u201cGod Almighty,\u201d\u2014awful,\nsacred words, which should never pass the lips except in subdued tones and\nwith a feeling of awe.\n176\nHigh-\ufb02own language is inappropriate in prayer, whether the petition be\noffered in the pulpit, in the family circle, or in secret. Especially should the\none offering public prayer use simple language, that others may understand\nwhat is said and unite with the petition.\nIt is the heart-felt prayer of faith that is heard in heaven and answered on\nearth. God understands the needs of humanity. He knows what we desire\nbefore we ask Him. He sees the soul\u2019s con\ufb02ict with doubt and temptation.\nHe marks the sincerity of the suppliant. He will accept the humiliation and\naf\ufb02iction of the soul. \u201cTo this man will I look,\u201d He declares, \u201ceven to him that\nis poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word.\u201d [Isaiah 66:2.]\nIt is our privilege to pray with con\ufb01dence, the Spirit inditing our petitions.\nWith simplicity we should state our needs to the Lord, and claim His promise\nwith such faith that those in the congregation will know that we have learned\nto prevail with God in prayer. They will be encouraged to believe that the\nLord\u2019s presence is in the meeting, and will open their hearts to receive His\nblessing. Their faith in our sincerity will be increased, and they will listen\nwith willing ears to the instruction given.\nOur prayers should be full of tenderness and love. When we yearn for a\ndeeper, broader realization of the Saviour\u2019s love, we shall cry to God for more\nwisdom. If ever there was a need of soul-stirring prayers and sermons, it is\nnow. The end of all things is at hand. O that we could see as we should the\nnecessity of seeking the Lord with all the heart! Then we should \ufb01nd Him.\n177\nMay God teach His people how to pray. Let the teachers in our schools\nand the ministers in our churches, learn daily in the school of Christ. Then\nthey will pray with earnestness, and their requests will be heard and answered.\nThen the word will be proclaimed with power.\nOur Attitude in Prayer\nBoth in public and in private worship, it is our privilege to bow on\nour knees before the Lord when we offer our petitions to Him. Jesus, our\nexample, \u201ckneeled down, and prayed.\u201d [Luke 22:41.] Of His disciples it\nis recorded that they, too, \u201ckneeled down, and prayed.\u201d [Acts 9:40; 20:36;\n21:5.] Paul declared, \u201cI bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus\nChrist.\u201d [Ephesians 3:14.] In confessing before God the sins of Israel, Ezra\nknelt. [See Ezra 9:5.] Daniel \u201ckneeled upon his knees three times a day, and\nprayed, and gave thanks before his God.\u201d [Daniel 6:10.]\nTrue reverence for God is inspired by a sense of His in\ufb01nite greatness\nand a realization of His presence. With this sense of the Unseen, every heart\nshould be deeply impressed. The hour and place of prayer are sacred, because\nGod is there; and as reverence is manifested in attitude and demeanor, the\nfeeling that inspires it will be deepened. \u201cHoly and reverend is His name,\u201d\n[Psalm 111:9.] the psalmist declares. Angels, when they speak that name,\nveil their faces. With what reverence, then, should we, who are fallen and\nsinful, take it upon our lips!\nWell would it be for old and young to ponder those words of Scripture that\nshow how the place marked by God\u2019s special presence should be regarded.\n\u201cPut\n178\noff thy shoes from off thy feet,\u201d He commanded Moses at the burning bush,\n\u201cfor the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\u201d [Exodus 3:5.] Jacob,\nafter beholding the vision of the angels, exclaimed, \u201cThe Lord is in this place;\nand I knew it not.... This is none other but the house of God, and this is the\ngate of heaven.\u201d [Genesis 28:16, 17.]\n\u201cThe Lord is in His holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before Him.\u201d\n[Habakkuk 2:20.] *****\nProsy, sermonizing prayers are uncalled for and out of place in public. A\nshort prayer, offered in fervor and faith, will soften the hearts of the hearers;\nbut during long prayers they wait impatiently, as if wishing that every word\nmight end it. Had the minister making such a prayer wrestled with God in his\nchamber until he felt that his faith could grasp the promise, \u201cAsk, and it shall\nbe given you,\u201d he would in his public prayer have come to the point at once,\nasking with earnestness and faith for grace for himself and his hearers.\n179\n180\nSection VI. The\nUnder-Shepherd\nThe Good Shepherd\nChrist, the great example for all ministers, likens Himself to a shepherd.\n\u201cI am the good shepherd,\u201d He declares; \u201cthe good shepherd giveth his life for\nthe sheep.\u201d \u201cI am the good shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of\nMine. As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down\nMy life for the sheep.\u201d [John 10:11, 14, 15.]\nAs an earthly shepherd knows his sheep, so does the divine Shepherd\nknow His \ufb02ock that are scattered throughout the world. \u201cYe My \ufb02ock, the\n\ufb02ock of My pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord God.\u201d\n[Ezekiel 34:31.]\nIn the parable of the lost sheep, the shepherd goes out to search for one\nsheep,\u2014the very least that can be numbered. Discovering that one of his\nsheep is missing, he does not look carelessly upon the \ufb02ock that is safely\nhoused, and say, I have ninety and nine, and it will cost me too much trouble\nto go in search of the straying one. Let him come back, and I will open the\ndoor of the sheepfold and let him in. No; no sooner does the sheep go astray\nthan the shepherd is \ufb01lled with grief and anxiety. Leaving the ninety and nine\n181\nin the fold, he goes in search of the straying one. However dark and\ntempestuous the night, however perilous and uncertain the way, however long\nand tedious the search, he does not falter until the lost is found.\nWith what relief does he hear in the distance its \ufb01rst faint cry! Following\nthe sound, he climbs the steepest heights; he goes to the very edge of the\nprecipice, at the risk of his own life. Thus he searches, while the cry, growing\nfainter, tells him that his sheep is ready to die.\nAnd when the straying one is found, does he command it to follow him?\nDoes he threaten or beat it, or drive it before him, thinking of the discomfort\nand anxiety that he has suffered on its account? No; he lays the exhausted\nsheep on his shoulder, and with cheerful gratitude that his search has not\nbeen in vain, he returns to the fold. His gratitude \ufb01nds expression in songs\nof rejoicing. And \u201cwhen he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and\nneighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep\nwhich was lost.\u201d\nSo when the lost sinner is found by the Good Shepherd, heaven and earth\nunite in rejoicing and thanksgiving. For \u201cjoy shall be in heaven over one\nsinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which\nneed no repentance.\u201d [Luke 5:6, 7.]\nThe great Shepherd has under-shepherds, to whom He delegates the care\nof His sheep and lambs. The \ufb01rst work that Christ entrusted to Peter, on\nrestoring him to the ministry, was to feed the lambs. [See John 21:15.] This\nwas a work in which Peter had had little experience. It\n182\nwould require great care and tenderness, much patience and perseverance. It\ncalled him to minister to the children and youth, and to those young in the\nfaith, to teach the ignorant, to open the Scriptures to them, and to educate\nthem for usefulness in Christ\u2019s service. Heretofore Peter had not been \ufb01tted\nto do this, or even to understand its importance.\nThe question that Christ put to Peter was signi\ufb01cant. He mentioned only\none condition of discipleship and service. \u201cLovest thou Me?\u201d He said. This is\nthe essential quali\ufb01cation. Though Peter might possess every other, without\nthe love of Christ he could not be a faithful shepherd over the Lord\u2019s \ufb02ock.\nKnowledge, benevolence, eloquence, gratitude, and zeal are all aids in the\ngood work; but without the love of Jesus in the heart, the work of the Christian\nminister will prove a failure.\nThe lesson which Christ taught him by the Sea of Galilee, Peter carried\nwith him throughout his life. Writing by the Holy Spirit to the churches, he\nsaid:\n\u201cThe elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a\nwitness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall\nbe revealed: Feed the \ufb02ock of God which is among you, taking the oversight\nthereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for \ufb01lthy lucre, but of a ready\nmind; neither as being lords over God\u2019s heritage, but being ensamples to the\n\ufb02ock. And when the Chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of\nglory that fadeth not away.\u201d [1 Peter 5:1-4.]\nThe sheep that has strayed from the fold is the most helpless of all\ncreatures. It must be sought for; for it cannot \ufb01nd its way back. So with\nthe soul that has\n183\nwandered away from God; he is as helpless as the lost sheep; and unless\ndivine love comes to his rescue, he can never \ufb01nd his way to God. Then with\nwhat compassion, what sorrow, what persistence, should the under-shepherd\nseek for lost souls! How willingly should he endure self-denial, hardship,\nprivation!\nThere is need of shepherds who, under the direction of the Chief\nShepherd, will seek for the lost and straying. This means the bearing of\nphysical discomfort and the sacri\ufb01ce of ease. It means a tender solicitude\nfor the erring, a divine compassion and forbearance. It means an ear that can\nlisten with sympathy to heart-breaking recitals of wrong, of degradation, of\ndespair and misery.\nThe spirit of the true shepherd is one of self-forgetfulness. He loses sight\nof self in order that he may work the works of God. By the preaching of\nthe word and by personal ministry in the homes of the people, he learns\ntheir needs, their sorrows, their trials; and, co-operating with the great\nBurden-bearer, he shares their af\ufb02ictions, comforts their distresses, relieves\ntheir soul-hunger, and wins their hearts to God. In this work the minister is\nattended by heavenly angels, and he himself is instructed and enlightened in\nthe truth that maketh wise unto salvation. *****\nIn our work, individual effort will accomplish much more than can be\nestimated. It is for the want of this that souls are perishing. One soul is\nof in\ufb01nite value; Calvary speaks its worth. One soul won to Christ, will be\ninstrumental in winning others, and there will be an ever-increasing result of\nblessing and salvation.\n184\nPersonal Ministry\nIn the work of many ministers there is too much sermonizing and too little\nreal heart-to-heart work. There is need of more personal labor for souls. In\nChristlike sympathy the minister should come close to men individually, and\nseek to awaken their interest in the great things of eternal life. Their hearts\nmay be as hard as the beaten highway, and apparently it may be a useless\neffort to present the Saviour to them; but while logic may fail to move, and\nargument be powerless to convince, the love of Christ, revealed in personal\nministry, may soften the stony heart, so that the seed of truth can take root.\nMinistry means much more than sermonizing; it means earnest personal\nlabor. The church on earth is composed of erring men and women, who need\npatient, painstaking labor, that they may be trained and disciplined to work\nwith acceptance in this life, and in the future life be crowned with glory and\nimmortality. Pastors are needed,\u2014faithful shepherds,\u2014who will not \ufb02atter\nGod\u2019s people, nor treat them harshly, but who will feed them with the bread\nof life,\u2014men who in their lives feel daily the converting power of the Holy\nSpirit, and who cherish a strong, unsel\ufb01sh love for those for whom they labor.\nThere is tactful work for the under-shepherd to do as he is called to meet\nalienation, bitterness, envy, and jealousy in the church; and he will need to\nlabor in the spirit of Christ to set things in order. Faithful warnings are to be\ngiven, sins rebuked, wrongs made right, both by the minister\u2019s work in the\npulpit and by\n185\npersonal labor. The wayward heart may take exception to the message, and\nthe servant of God be misjudged and criticized. Let him then remember that\n\u201cthe wisdom that is from above is \ufb01rst pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy\nto be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without\nhypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make\npeace.\u201d [James 3:17, 18.]\nThe work of the gospel minister is \u201cto make all men see what is the\nfellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been\nhid in God.\u201d [Ephesians 3:9.] If one entering upon this work chooses the\nleast self-sacri\ufb01cing part, contenting himself with preaching, and leaving the\nwork of personal ministry for some one else to do, his labors will not be\nacceptable to God. Souls for whom Christ died are perishing for want of\nwell-directed personal labor; and he has mistaken his calling who, having\nentered the ministry, is unwilling to do the personal work that the care of the\n\ufb02ock demands.\nThe minister must be instant in season and out of season, ready to seize\nand improve every opportunity to further the work of God. To be \u201cinstant\nin season\u201d is to be alert to the privileges of the house and hour of worship,\nand to the times when men are conversing on topics of religion. And to be\ninstant \u201cout of season\u201d is to be ready, when at the \ufb01reside, in the \ufb01eld, by\nthe wayside, in the market, to turn the minds of men, in a suitable manner,\nto the great themes of the Bible, with tender, fervent spirit urging upon them\nthe claims of God. Many, many such opportunities are allowed to slip by\nunimproved, because men are\n186\npersuaded that it is out of season. But who knows what might be the effect of\na wise appeal to the conscience? It is written, \u201cIn the morning sow thy seed,\nand in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether\nshall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.\u201d\n[Ecclesiastes 11:6.] He who is sowing the seeds of truth may bear a burdened\nheart, and at times his efforts may seem to be without result. But if he is\nfaithful, he will see fruit of his labor; for God\u2019s word declares, \u201cHe that goeth\nforth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with\nrejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\u201d [Psalm 126:6.]\nVisiting Homes\nWhen a minister has presented the gospel message from the pulpit, his\nwork is only begun. There is personal work for him to do. He should visit\nthe people in their homes, talking and praying with them in earnestness and\nhumility. There are families who will never be reached by the truths of God\u2019s\nword unless the stewards of His grace enter their homes and point them to the\nhigher way. But the hearts of those who do this work must throb in unison\nwith the heart of Christ.\nMuch is comprehended in the command, \u201cGo out into the highways and\nhedges, and compel them to come in, that My house may be \ufb01lled.\u201d [Luke\n14:23.] Let ministers teach the truth in families, drawing close to those for\nwhom they labor; and as they thus co-operate with God, He will clothe them\nwith spiritual power. Christ will guide them in their work, giving them words\nto speak that will sink deep into the hearts of the listeners.\n187\nIt is the privilege of every minister to be able to say with Paul, \u201cI have not\nshunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.\u201d \u201cI kept back nothing that\nwas pro\ufb01table unto you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly,\nand from house to house, ...repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord\nJesus Christ.\u201d [Acts 20:27, 20, 21.]\nOur Saviour went from house to house, healing the sick, comforting the\nmourners, soothing the af\ufb02icted, speaking peace to the disconsolate. He took\nthe little children in His arms and blessed them and spoke words of hope\nand comfort to the weary mothers. With unfailing tenderness and gentleness,\nHe met every form of human woe and af\ufb02iction. Not for Himself, but for\nothers did He labor. He was the servant of all. It was His meat and drink\nto bring hope and strength to all with whom He came in contact. And as\nmen and women listened to the truths that fell from His lips, so different\nfrom the traditions and dogmas taught by the rabbis, hope sprang up in their\nhearts. In His teaching there was an earnestness that sent His words home\nwith convicting power.\nTo my ministering brethren I would say, By personal labor reach the\npeople where they are. Become acquainted with them. This work cannot\nbe done by proxy. Money loaned or given cannot accomplish it. Sermons\nfrom the pulpit cannot do it. Teaching the Scriptures in families,\u2014this is the\nwork of an evangelist, and this work is to be united with preaching. If it is\nomitted, the preaching will be, to a great extent, a failure.\nThose who are seeking for truth need to have words spoken to them in\nseason; for Satan is speaking\n188\nto them by his temptations. If you meet with repulse when trying to help\nsouls, heed it not. If there seems to be little good resulting from your work,\ndo not become discouraged. Keep working; be discreet; know when to speak,\nand when to keep silent; watch for souls as they that must give an account; and\nwatch for the devices of Satan, lest you be led aside from duty. Do not allow\ndif\ufb01culties to dishearten or intimidate you. With strong faith, with intrepid\npurpose, meet and overcome these dif\ufb01culties. Sow the seed in faith, and\nwith an unsparing hand. *****\nMuch depends upon the manner in which you meet those whom you visit.\nYou can take hold of a person\u2019s hand in greeting in such a way as to gain\nhis con\ufb01dence at once, or in so cold a manner that he will think you have no\ninterest in him.\nWe should not act as if it were a condescension to come in contact with\nthe poor. They are as precious in God\u2019s sight as we are, and we must act\nas if we thought them so. Our clothing should be plain and simple, so that\nwhen we visit the poor, they will not be embarrassed by the contrast between\nour appearance and their own. The joy that comes to the poor is often very\nlimited, and why should not God\u2019s workers carry rays of light into their\nhomes? We need the tender sympathy of Jesus; then we can win our way\nto hearts.\nThe Shepherd\u2019s Work\nA true shepherd will have an interest in all that relates to the welfare of the\n\ufb02ock, feeding, guiding, and defending them. He will carry himself with great\nwisdom, and will manifest a tender consideration for all, especially for the\ntempted, the af\ufb02icted, and the desponding. \u201cEven as the Son of man came not\nto be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.\u201d\n[Matthew 20:28.] \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater\nthan his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.\u201d [John\n13:16.] Christ \u201cmade Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form\nof a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.\u201d [Philippians 2:7.] \u201cWe\nthen that are strong ought to bear the in\ufb01rmities of the weak, and not to please\nourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edi\ufb01cation.\nFor even Christ pleased not Himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of\nthem that reproached thee fell on Me.\u201d [Romans 15:1-3.] *****\n189\nMany a laborer fails in his work because he does not come close to those\nwho most need his help. With the Bible in hand, he should seek in a courteous\nmanner to learn the objections which exist in the minds of those who are\nbeginning to inquire, \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d Carefully and tenderly should he lead\nand educate them, as pupils in a school. Many have to unlearn theories which\nthey have long believed to be truth. As they become convinced that they have\nbeen in error\n190\nconcerning Bible subjects, they are thrown into perplexity and doubt. They\nneed the tenderest sympathy and the most judicious help; they should be\ncarefully instructed, and should be prayed for and prayed with, watched and\nguarded with the kindest solicitude.\nIt is a great privilege to be a co-laborer with Christ in the salvation of\nsouls. With patient, unsel\ufb01sh effort the Saviour sought to reach man in\nhis fallen condition, and to rescue him from the consequences of sin. His\ndisciples, who are the teachers of His word, should closely imitate their great\nExemplar. *****\nIn new \ufb01elds, much prayer and wise labor are needed. There are wanted,\nnot merely men who can sermonize, but those who have an experimental\nknowledge of the mystery of godliness, and who can meet the urgent needs\nof the people,\u2014those who realize the importance of their position as servants\nof Jesus, and will cheerfully take up the cross that He has taught them how to\nbear.\nIt is highly important that a pastor mingle much with his people, and thus\nbecome acquainted with the different phases of human nature. He should\nstudy the workings of the mind, that he may adapt his teachings to the intellect\nof his hearers. He will thus learn that grand charity which is possessed only\nby those who study closely the nature and needs of men.\nBible-Readings with Families\nThe plan of holding Bible-readings was a heaven-born idea. There are\nmany, both men and women, who can engage in this branch of missionary\nlabor. Workers may thus be developed who will become mighty men of\nGod. By this means the word of God has been given to thousands; and\nthe workers are brought into personal contact with people of all nations\nand tongues. The Bible is brought into families, and its sacred truths come\nhome to the conscience. Men are entreated to read, examine, and judge for\nthemselves, and they must abide the responsibility of receiving or rejecting\nthe divine enlightenment. God will not permit this precious work for Him to\ngo unrewarded. He will crown with success every humble effort made in His\nname. *****\n191\nIn every new \ufb01eld, patience and perseverance must be exercised. Be not\ndisheartened at small beginnings. It is often the humblest work that yields\nthe greatest results. The more direct our labor for our fellow-men, the greater\ngood will be accomplished. Personal in\ufb02uence is a power. The minds of\nthose with whom we are closely associated, are impressed through unseen\nin\ufb02uences. One cannot speak to a multitude, and move them as he could if\nhe were brought into closer relationship with them. Jesus left heaven and\ncame to our world to save souls. You must come close to those for whom you\nlabor, that they may not only hear your voice, but shake your hand, learn your\nprinciples, feel your sympathy.\n192\nMy ministering brethren, do not think that the only work you can do, the\nonly way you can labor for souls, is to give discourses. The best work you\ncan do is to teach, to educate. Whenever you can \ufb01nd an opportunity to do\nso, sit down with some family, and let them ask questions. Then answer them\npatiently, humbly. Continue this work in connection with your more public\nefforts. Preach less, and educate more, by holding Bible-readings, and by\npraying with families and little companies.\nTo all who are working with Christ I would say, Wherever you can gain\naccess to the people by the \ufb01reside, improve your opportunity. Take your\nBible, and open before them its great truths. Your success will not depend\nso much upon your knowledge and accomplishments, as upon your ability to\n\ufb01nd your way to the heart. By being social and coming close to the people,\nyou may turn the current of their thoughts more readily than by the most able\ndiscourse. The presentation of Christ in the family, by the \ufb01reside, and in\nsmall gatherings in private houses, is often more successful in winning souls\nto Jesus than are sermons delivered in the open air, to the moving throng, or\neven in halls or churches.\nAll who engage in this personal labor should be just as careful not to\nbecome mechanical in their manner of working as should the minister who\npreaches the word. They should be constantly learning. They should have a\nconscientious zeal to obtain the highest quali\ufb01cations, to become men able\nin the Scriptures. They should cultivate habits of mental activity, especially\ngiving themselves to prayer and to the diligent study of the Scriptures.\n193\nThe Value of Individual Effort\nThose who have been most successful in soul-winning were men and\nwomen who did not pride themselves on their ability, but who in humility\nand faith sought to help those about them. Jesus did this very work. He came\nclose to those whom He desired to reach. How often, with a few gathered\nabout Him, He gave His lessons, and one by one the passers-by paused to\nlisten, until a great multitude heard with wonder and awe the words of the\nheaven-sent Teacher.\nThe Woman of Samaria\nChrist did not wait for congregations to assemble. Some of the grandest\ntruths He uttered were spoken to individuals. Listen to His wonderful words\nto that one woman of Samaria. He was sitting by Jacob\u2019s well as the woman\ncame to draw water. To her surprise He asked a favor of her. \u201cGive Me to\ndrink,\u201d He said. He wanted a cool draught, and He wished also to open the\nway whereby He might give to her the water of life.\n\u201cHow is it,\u201d said the woman, \u201cthat Thou, being a Jew, askest drink of\nme, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the\nSamaritans.\u201d\nJesus answered, \u201cIf thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith\nto thee, Give Me to drink; thou wouldst have asked of Him, and He would\nhave given thee living water.... Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst\nagain: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never\nthirst;\n194\nbut the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up\ninto everlasting life.\u201d\nHow much interest Christ manifested in this one woman! How earnest\nand eloquent were His words! They stirred the heart of the listener, and\nforgetting her errand to the well, she went into the city and said to her friends,\n\u201cCome, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the\nChrist?\u201d [See John 4:7-30.]\nMany left their employment to come to the Stranger at Jacob\u2019s well. They\nplied Him with questions, and eagerly received His explanation of many\nthings that had been dark to their understanding. They were like people\ntracing a sudden ray of light until they found the day.\nThe result of the work of Jesus, as He sat, weary and hungry, at the well,\nwas wide-spread in blessing. The one soul whom He sought to help became\na means of reaching others and bringing them to the Saviour. This is ever\nthe way that the work of God has made progress on the earth. Let your light\nshine, and other lights will be kindled.\nGod\u2019s servants are to stand as minutemen, ready for service at a moment\u2019s\nnotice. My brethren, from hour to hour opportunities to serve God will open\nbefore you. These constantly come and go. Be ever ready to make the most\nof them. That chance to speak in the hearing of some needy soul the word of\nlife may never again offer itself; therefore let no one venture to say, \u201cI pray\nthee have me excused.\u201d Lose no opportunity to make known to others the\nunsearchable riches of Christ; for an opportunity once neglected may pass\nforever beyond recall.\n195\nA Division of Labor\nA serious and perhaps unsuspected hindrance to the success of the truth is\nto be found in our churches themselves. When an effort is made to present our\nfaith to unbelievers, the members of the church too often stand back, as if they\nwere not an interested party, and let all the burden rest upon the minister. For\nthis reason the labor of our most able ministers has been at times productive\nof little good. The very best sermons may be preached, the message may be\njust what the people need, and yet no souls be gained as sheaves to present to\nChrist.\nIn laboring where there are already some in the faith, the minister\nshould at \ufb01rst seek not so much to convert unbelievers, as to train the\nchurch-members for acceptable co-operation. Let him labor for them\nindividually, endeavoring to arouse them to seek for a deeper experience\nthemselves, and to work for others. When they are prepared to sustain the\nminister by their prayers and labors, greater success will attend his efforts.\n*****\nNothing lasting can be accomplished for churches in different places\nunless they are aroused to feel that a responsibility rests upon them. Every\nmember of the body should feel that the salvation of his own soul depends\nupon his own individual effort. Souls cannot be saved without exertion. The\nminister cannot save the people. He can be a channel through which God will\nimpart light to His people; but after the light\n196\nis given, it is left with the people to appropriate that light, and in their turn to\nlet it shine forth to others.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:121. *****\nEducating Church Helpers\nThe minister should not feel that it is his duty to do all the talking and\nall the laboring and all the praying; he should educate helpers in every\nchurch. Let different ones take turns in leading the meetings, and in giving\nBible-readings; in so doing they will be calling into use the talents which God\nhas given them, and at the same time be receiving a training as workers.\n\u201cIn some respects the pastor occupies a position similar to that of the\nforeman of a gang of laboring men or the captain of a ship\u2019s crew. They are\nexpected to see that the men over whom they are set, do the work assigned\nto them correctly and promptly, and only in case of emergency are they to\nexecute in detail.\n\u201cThe owner of a large mill once found his superintendent in a wheel-pit,\nmaking some simple repairs, while a half-dozen workmen in that line were\nstanding by, idly looking on. The proprietor, after learning the facts, so as\nto be sure that no injustice was done, called the foreman to his of\ufb01ce and\nhanded him his discharge with full pay. In surprise the foreman asked for an\nexplanation. It was given in these words: \u2018I employed you to keep six men\nat work. I found the six idle, and you doing the work of but one. Your work\ncould have been done just as well by any one of the six. I cannot afford to\npay the wages of seven for you to teach the six how to be idle.\u2019\n197\n\u201cThis incident may be applicable in some cases, and in others not. But\nmany pastors fail in not knowing how, or in not trying, to get the full\nmembership of the church actively engaged in the various departments of\nchurch work. If pastors would give more attention to getting and keeping\ntheir \ufb02ock actively engaged at work, they would accomplish more good, have\nmore time for study and religious visiting, and also avoid many causes of\nfriction.\u201d\nSome, through inexperience, will make mistakes, but they should be\nkindly shown how they can do their work better. Thus the pastor can be\neducating men and women to bear responsibilities in the good work that\nis suffering so much for want of laborers. We need men who can take\nresponsibilities; and the best way for them to gain the experience they need,\nis to engage with heart and mind in the work.\nSaved by Effort for Another\nA working church is a growing church. The members \ufb01nd a stimulus and\na tonic in helping others. I have read of a man who, journeying on a winter\u2019s\nday through deep drifts of snow, became benumbed by the cold, which was\nalmost imperceptibly freezing his vital powers. He was nearly chilled to\ndeath, and was about to give up the struggle for life, when he heard the moans\nof a fellow-traveler, who was also perishing with cold. His sympathy was\naroused, and he determined to rescue him. He chafed the ice-cold limbs of\nthe unfortunate man, and after considerable effort raised him to his feet. As\nthe sufferer could not stand, he bore him in sympathizing arms through the\nvery drifts he had thought he could never get through alone.\n198\nWhen he had carried his fellow-traveler to a place of safety, the truth\n\ufb02ashed home to him that in saving his neighbor he had also saved himself.\nHis earnest efforts to help another had quickened the blood that was freezing\nin his own veins, and sent a healthy warmth to the extremities of his body.\nThe lesson that in helping others we ourselves receive help, must be\nurged upon young believers continually, by precept and example, that in their\nChristian experience they may gain the best results. Let the desponding ones,\nthose disposed to think that the way to eternal life is trying and dif\ufb01cult, go\nto work to help others. Such efforts, united with prayer for divine light, will\ncause their own hearts to throb with the quickening in\ufb02uence of the grace\nof God, their own affections to glow with more divine fervor. Their whole\nChristian life will be more of a reality, more earnest, more prayerful.\nLet us remember that we are pilgrims and strangers on this earth, seeking\na better country, even a heavenly. Those who have united with the Lord in the\ncovenant of service are under bonds to co-operate with Him in the work of\nsoul-saving.\nLet church-members during the week act their part faithfully, and on the\nSabbath tell their experiences. The meeting will then be as meat in due\nseason, bringing to all present new life and fresh vigor. When God\u2019s people\nsee the great need of working as Christ worked for the conversion of sinners,\nthe testimonies borne by them in the Sabbath services will be \ufb01lled with\npower. With joy they will bear witness to the preciousness of the experience\nthey have gained in working for others.\n199\nThe Church a Sacred Trust\nWhen Christ ascended, He left the church and all its interests as a sacred\ntrust to His followers. And the work of the church is not to be left to the\nminister alone, or to a few leading men. Every member should feel that he\nhas entered into a solemn covenant with the Lord to work for the best interests\nof His cause at all times and under all circumstances. Each should have some\npart to act, some burden to bear. If all church-members felt an individual\nresponsibility, greater advancement would be made in spiritual things. The\nsolemn burden of responsibility resting upon them would lead them to seek\nGod often for strength and grace.\nThe real character of the church is measured, not by the high profession\nshe makes, not by the names enrolled on her books, but by what she is actually\ndoing for the Master, by the number of her persevering, faithful workers.\nPersonal, unsel\ufb01sh effort will accomplish more for the cause of Christ than\ncan be wrought by sermons or creeds.\nLet ministers teach church-members that in order to grow in spirituality,\nthey must carry the burden that the Lord has laid upon them,\u2014the burden of\nleading souls into the truth. Those who are not ful\ufb01lling their responsibility\nshould be visited, prayed with, labored for. Do not lead the people to depend\nupon you as ministers; teach them rather that they are to use their talents\nin giving the truth to those around them. In thus working they will have\nthe co-operation of heavenly angels, and will obtain an experience that will\nincrease their faith, and give them a strong hold on God.\n200\nThe Minister\u2019s Wife\nIn former years the wives of ministers endured want and persecution.\nWhen their husbands suffered imprisonment, and sometimes death, those\nnoble, self-sacri\ufb01cing women suffered with them, and their reward will be\nequal to that bestowed on the husband. Mrs. Boardman and the Mrs. Judsons\nsuffered for the truth,\u2014suffered with their companions. They sacri\ufb01ced home\nand friends in every sense of the word, to aid their companions in the work of\nenlightening those who sat in darkness; to reveal to them the hidden mysteries\nof the word of God. Their lives were in constant peril. To save souls was their\ngreat object, and for this they could suffer cheerfully....\nIf a minister\u2019s wife accompanies her husband in his travels, she should not\ngo for her own special enjoyment, to visit and to be waited upon, but to labor\nwith him. She should have a united interest with him to do good. She should\nbe willing to accompany her husband, if home cares do not hinder, and she\nshould aid him in his efforts to save souls. With meekness and humility, yet\nwith a noble self-reliance, she should have a leading in\ufb02uence upon minds\naround her, and should act her part and bear her cross and burden in meeting,\nand around the family altar, and in conversation at the \ufb01reside. The people\nexpect this, and they have a right to expect it. If these expectations are not\nrealized, the husband\u2019s in\ufb02uence is more than half destroyed.\nThe wife of a minister can do much if she will. If she possesses the spirit\nof self-sacri\ufb01ce, and has a love for souls, she can with him do almost an equal\namount\n201\nof good. A sister-laborer in the cause of truth can understand and reach some\ncases, especially among the sisters, that the minister cannot.\nA responsibility rests upon the minister\u2019s wife which she should not and\ncannot lightly throw off. God will require the talent lent her, with usury. She\nshould work earnestly, faithfully, and unitedly with her husband to save souls.\nShe should never urge her wishes and desires, or express a lack of interest\nin her husband\u2019s labor, or dwell upon homesick, discontented feelings. All\nthese natural feelings must be overcome. She should have a purpose in life\nwhich should be unfalteringly carried out. What if this con\ufb02icts with the\nfeelings and pleasures and natural tastes! These should be cheerfully and\nreadily sacri\ufb01ced, in order to do good and save souls.\nThe wives of ministers should live devoted, prayerful lives. But some\nwould enjoy a religion in which there are no crosses, and which calls for\nno self-denial and exertion on their part. Instead of standing nobly for\nthemselves, leaning upon God for strength, and bearing their individual\nresponsibility, they have much of the time been dependent upon others,\nderiving their spiritual life from them. If they would only lean con\ufb01dingly, in\nchildlike trust, upon God, and have their affections centered in Jesus, deriving\ntheir life from Christ, the living vine, what an amount of good they might do,\nwhat a help they might be to others, what a support to their husbands; and\nwhat a reward would be theirs in the end! \u201cWell done, good and faithful\nservant,\u201d would fall like sweetest music upon their ears. The words, \u201cEnter\nthou into the joy of thy Lord,\u201d would repay them a thousand times for all\n202\nthe suffering and trials endured to save precious souls.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 1:451-453. *****\nIf married men go into the work, leaving their wives to care for the\nchildren at home, the wife and mother is doing fully as great and important a\nwork as is the husband and father. While one is in the missionary \ufb01eld, the\nother is a home missionary, whose cares and anxieties and burdens frequently\nfar exceed those of the husband and father. The mother\u2019s work is a solemn\nand important one,\u2014to mould the minds and fashion the characters of her\nchildren, to train them for usefulness here, and to \ufb01t them for the future\nimmortal life.\nThe husband, in the open missionary \ufb01eld, may receive the honor of men,\nwhile the home toiler may receive no earthly credit for her labor; but if she\nworks for the best interests of her family, seeking to fashion their characters\nafter the divine Model, the recording angel writes her name as one of the\ngreatest missionaries in the world. *****\nThe minister\u2019s wife may be a great help to her husband in seeking to\nlighten his burden, if she keeps her own soul in the love of God. She can teach\nthe Word to her children. She can manage her own household with economy\nand discretion. United with her husband she can educate her children in habits\nof economy, teaching them to restrict their wants.\n203\nThe Minister in His Home\nGod designs that in his home life the teacher of the Bible shall be an\nexempli\ufb01cation of the truths that he teaches. What a man is, has greater\nin\ufb02uence than what he says. Piety in the daily life will give power to the\npublic testimony. Patience, consistency, and love will make an impression on\nhearts that sermons fail to reach.\nThe minister\u2019s duties lie around him, nigh and afar off; but his \ufb01rst duty\nis to his children. He should not become so engrossed with his outside duties\nas to neglect the instruction which his children need. He may look upon\nhis home duties as of lesser importance; but in reality they lie at the very\nfoundation of the well-being of individuals and of society. To a large degree\nthe happiness of men and women and the success of the church depend upon\nhome in\ufb02uence. Eternal interests are involved in the proper discharge of the\nevery-day duties of life. The world is not so much in need of great minds, as\nof good men, who are a blessing in their homes.\nNothing can excuse the minister for neglecting the inner circle for the\nlarger circle outside. The spiritual welfare of his family comes \ufb01rst. In the\nday of \ufb01nal reckoning, God will inquire what he did to win to Christ those\nwhom he took the responsibility of bringing into the world. Great good done\nfor others cannot cancel the debt that he owes to God to care for his own\nchildren.\nThere should exist in the minister\u2019s family a unity that will preach an\neffectual sermon on practical\n204\ngodliness. As the minister and his wife faithfully do their duty in the home,\nrestraining, correcting, advising, counseling, guiding, they are becoming\nbetter \ufb01tted to labor in the church, and are multiplying agencies for the\naccomplishment of God\u2019s work outside the home. The members of the family\nbecome members of the family above, and are a power for good, exerting a\nfar-reaching in\ufb02uence.\nOn the other hand, the minister who allows his children to grow up unruly\nand disobedient, will \ufb01nd that the in\ufb02uence of his labors in the pulpit is\ncounteracted by the unlovely course of his children. He who cannot control\nthe members of his own family, cannot properly minister to the church of\nGod, or preserve it from strife and controversy.\nCourtesy in the Home\nThere is danger of failing to give due attention to the little things of\nlife. There should be no neglect on the part of the minister to speak kindly,\nencouraging words in the family circle. My ministering brother, do you, in\nthe home circle, show rudeness, unkindness, impoliteness? If you do, no\nmatter how high your profession, you are breaking the commandments. No\nmatter how earnestly you may preach to others, if you fail to manifest the love\nof Christ in your home life, you are falling short of the standard set for you.\nThink not that the man who goes from the sacred desk to indulge in harsh,\nsarcastic remarks, or in jesting and joking, is a representative of Christ. The\nlove of God is not in him. His heart is \ufb01lled with self-love, self-importance,\nand he makes it manifest that he has not a true estimate of sacred things.\nChrist is not with\n205\nhim, and he does not go weighted with the solemn message of truth for this\ntime.\nMinisters\u2019 children are in some cases the most neglected children in the\nworld, for the reason that the father is with them but little, and they are left to\nchoose their own employment and amusement. If a minister has a family of\nboys, he should not leave them wholly to the care of the mother. This is too\nheavy a burden for her. He should make himself their companion and friend.\nHe should exert himself to keep them from evil associates, and should see\nthat they have useful work to do. It may be hard for the mother to exercise\nself-control. If the husband sees this, he should take more of the burden upon\nhimself, doing all in his power to lead his boys to God.\nLet the minister\u2019s wife who has children remember that in her home she\nhas a missionary \ufb01eld in which she should labor with untiring energy and\nun\ufb02agging zeal, knowing that the results of her work will endure throughout\neternity. Are not the souls of her children of as much value as the souls of\nthe heathen? then let her tend them with loving care. She is charged with\nthe responsibility of showing to the world the power and excellence of home\nreligion. She is to be controlled by principle, not by impulse, and she is to\nwork with the consciousness that God is her helper. She is to allow nothing\nto divert her from her mission.\nThe in\ufb02uence of the mother who has a close connection with Christ is of\nin\ufb01nite worth. Her ministry of love makes the home a Bethel. Christ works\nwith her, turning the common water of life into the wine of heaven. Her\nchildren will grow up to be a blessing and an honor to her in this life and in\nthe life to come.\n206\n\u201cFeed My Lambs\u201d\nThe charge given to Peter by Christ just before His ascension was, \u201cFeed\nMy lambs;\u201d [John 21:15.] and this charge is given to every minister. When\nChrist said to His disciples, \u201cSuffer the little children to come unto Me, and\nforbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God,\u201d [Mark 10:14.] He was\nspeaking to His disciples in all ages.\nVery much has been lost to the cause of truth by a lack of attention to the\nspiritual needs of the young. Ministers of the gospel should form a happy\nacquaintance with the youth of their congregations. Many are reluctant to do\nthis, but their neglect is a sin in the sight of Heaven. There are among us\nmany young men and women who are not ignorant of our faith, yet whose\nhearts have never been touched by the power of divine grace. How can we\nwho claim to be the servants of God pass on day after day, week after week,\nindifferent to their condition? If they should die in their sins, unwarned, their\nblood would be required at the hands of the watchman who failed to give\nthem warning.\nWhy should not labor for the youth in our borders be regarded as\nmissionary work of the highest kind? It requires the most delicate tact, the\nmost watchful consideration, the most earnest prayer for heavenly wisdom.\nThe youth are the objects of Satan\u2019s special attacks; but kindness, courtesy,\nand the sympathy which \ufb02ows from a heart \ufb01lled with love to Jesus, will gain\ntheir con\ufb01dence, and save them from many a snare of the enemy.\n207\nThe youth need more than a casual notice, more than an occasional word\nof encouragement. They need painstaking, prayerful, careful labor. He only\nwhose heart is \ufb01lled with love and sympathy will be able to reach those\nyouth who are apparently careless and indifferent. Not all can be helped\nin the same way. God deals with each according to his temperament and\ncharacter, and we must co-operate with Him. Often those whom we pass by\nwith indifference, because we judge them from outward appearance, have in\nthem the best material for workers, and will repay all the efforts bestowed on\nthem. There must be more study given to the problem of how to deal with\nthe youth, more earnest prayer for the wisdom that is needed in dealing with\nminds.\nPreaching for Children\nAt every suitable opportunity let the story of Jesus\u2019 love be repeated to\nthe children. In every sermon let a little corner be left for their bene\ufb01t.\nThe servant of Christ may make lasting friends of these little ones. Then\nlet him lose no opportunity of helping them to become more intelligent in a\nknowledge of the Scriptures. This will do more than we realize to bar the way\nagainst Satan\u2019s devices. If children early become familiar with the truths of\nGod\u2019s word, a barrier against ungodliness will be erected, and they will be\nable to meet the foe with the words, \u201cIt is written.\u201d\nThose who give instruction to children and youth should avoid tedious\nremarks. Short talks, right to the point, will have a happy in\ufb02uence. If there is\nmuch to be said, make up for brevity by frequency. A few interesting remarks,\nevery now and then, will be more helpful than to give all the instruction at\nonce.\n208\nLong speeches tire the minds of the young. Too much talk will lead them\neven to loathe spiritual instruction, just as overeating burdens the stomach\nand lessens the appetite, leading to a loathing for food. Our instruction to the\nchurch, and especially to the youth, should be given line upon line, precept\nupon precept, here a little and there a little. Children must be drawn toward\nheaven, not harshly, but very gently.\nEntering into the Feelings of the Youth\nWe should seek to enter into the feelings of the youth, sympathizing with\nthem in their joys and sorrows, their con\ufb02icts and victories. Jesus did not\nremain in heaven, away from the sorrowing and sinful; He came down to this\nworld, that He might become acquainted with the weakness, the suffering,\nand the temptations of the fallen race. He reached us where we were, that He\nmight lift us up. In our work of the youth, we must meet them where they are,\nif we would help them. When youthful disciples are overcome by temptation,\nlet not those older in experience deal with them harshly, or regard their efforts\nwith indifference. Remember that you yourselves have often shown but little\nstrength to resist the tempter\u2019s power. Be as patient with these lambs of the\n\ufb02ock as you wish others to be with you. God has so constituted us that even\nthe strongest desire sympathy. How much more, then, do children need it!\nEven a look of compassion will often soothe and strengthen the tried, tempted\nchild.\nJesus calls to every wanderer, \u201cMy son, give Me thine heart.\u201d [Proverbs\n23:26.] \u201cReturn, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.\u201d\n[Jeremiah 3:22.] The youth cannot be\n209\ntruly happy without the love of Jesus. He is waiting with pitying tenderness\nto hear the confessions of the wayward, and to accept their penitence. He\nwatches for some return of gratitude from them, as the mother watches for\nthe smile of recognition from her beloved babe. The great God teaches us to\ncall Him Father. He would have us understand how earnestly and tenderly\nHis heart yearns over us in all our trials and temptations. \u201cLike as a father\npitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.\u201d [Psalm 103:13.]\nThe mother might sooner forget her child than God could forget one soul that\ntrusts Him.\nThe Youth to Act a Part in Church Work\nWhen the youth give their hearts to God, our responsibility for them does\nnot cease. They must be interested in the Lord\u2019s work, and led to see that He\nexpects them to do something to advance His cause. It is not enough to show\nhow much needs to be done, and to urge the youth to act a part. They must be\ntaught how to labor for the Master. They must be trained, disciplined, drilled,\nin the best methods of winning souls to Christ. Teach them to try in a quiet,\nunpretending way to help their young companions. Let different branches of\nmissionary effort be systematically laid out, in which they may take part, and\nlet them be given instruction and help. Thus they will learn to work for God.\nDo not imagine that you can arouse the interest of the young by going to\nthe missionary meeting and preaching a long sermon. Plan ways whereby a\nlive interest may be aroused. From week to week the youth should bring in\ntheir reports, telling what they\n210\nhave tried to do for the Saviour, and what success has been theirs. If the\nmissionary meeting were made an occasion for bringing in such reports, it\nwould not be dull, tedious, and uninteresting. It would be full of interest, and\nthere would be no lack of attendance.\nYouthful talent, well organized and well trained, is needed in our\nchurches. The youth will do something with their over\ufb02owing energies.\nUnless these energies are directed into right channels, they will be used by\nthe youth in a way that will hurt their own spirituality, and prove an injury to\nthose with whom they associate.\nLet the heart of the instructor be linked with the hearts of those under his\ncharge. Let him remember that they have many temptations to meet. We little\nrealize the objectionable traits of character given to the youth as a birthright,\nand how often temptation comes to them as a result of this birthright.\nThe guarding care that the under-shepherd will give the lambs of his \ufb02ock\nis well illustrated by a picture I have seen representing the Good Shepherd.\nThe shepherd is leading the way, while the \ufb02ock follow close behind. Carried\nin his arms is a helpless lamb, while the mother walks trustingly by his side.\nOf the work of Christ, Isaiah says, \u201cHe shall gather the lambs with His arm,\nand carry them in His bosom.\u201d [Isaiah 40:11.] The lambs need more than\ndaily food. They need protection, and must constantly be guarded with tender\ncare. If one goes astray, it must be searched for. The \ufb01gure is a beautiful one,\nand well represents the loving service that the under-shepherd of the \ufb02ock of\nChrist is to give to those under his protection and care.\n211\nMy brethren in the ministry, open your doors to young men who are\nexposed to temptation. Come near to them by personal effort. Evil invites\nthem on every hand. Seek to interest them in that which will help them to live\nthe higher life. Do not hold yourself aloof from them. Bring them to your\n\ufb01reside; invite them to join you around the family altar. Let us remember the\nclaim of God upon us to make the path to heaven bright and attractive. *****\nWe should educate the youth to help the youth; and as they seek to do this,\nthey will gain an experience that will qualify them to become consecrated\nworkers in a larger sphere. Thousands of hearts can be reached in the most\nsimple, humble way. The most intellectual, those who are looked upon and\npraised as the world\u2019s most gifted men and women, are often refreshed by\nthe simple words that \ufb02ow from the heart of one who loves God.... The\ntrue, honest words of a son or daughter of God, spoken in natural simplicity,\nwill open the door to hearts that have long been locked.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 6:115. *****\nFrom a child, Timothy knew the Scriptures; and this knowledge was a\nsafeguard to him against evil in\ufb02uences surrounding him, and the temptation\nto choose pleasure and sel\ufb01sh grati\ufb01cation before duty. Such a safeguard\nall our children need; and it should be a part of the work of parents and of\nChrist\u2019s ambassadors to see that the children are properly instructed in the\nword of God.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:398.\n212\nPrayer for the Sick\nThe very essence of the gospel is restoration, and the Saviour would have\nHis servants bid the sick, the hopeless, and the af\ufb02icted take hold upon His\nstrength. God\u2019s servants are the channels of His grace, and through them\nHe desires to exercise His healing power. It is their work to present the sick\nand suffering to the Saviour in the arms of faith. They should live so near to\nHim, and so clearly reveal in their lives the working of His truth, that He can\nmake them a means of blessing to those in need of bodily as well as spiritual\nhealing.\nIt is our privilege to pray with the sick, to help them to grasp the cord of\nfaith. Angels of God are very near to those who thus minister to suffering\nhumanity. The consecrated ambassador of Christ who, when appealed to by\nthe sick, seeks to fasten their attention upon divine realities, is accomplishing\na work that will endure throughout eternity. And as he approaches the sick\nwith the comfort of a hope gained through faith in Christ and acceptance of\nthe divine promises, his own experience becomes richer and still richer in\nspiritual strength.\nWith awakened conscience many a troubled soul, suffering bodily\nailments as the result of continued transgression, cries out, \u201cLord, be merciful\nto me a sinner; make me Thy child.\u201d It is then that the minister, strong in faith,\nshould be ready to tell the sufferer that there is hope for the penitent, that in\nJesus every one who longs for help and acceptance may \ufb01nd deliverance and\npeace. He who in meekness\n213\nand love thus brings the gospel to the af\ufb02icted soul so much in need of its\nmessage of hope, is a mouthpiece for the One who gave Himself for mankind.\nAs he speaks helpful, appropriate words, and as he offers prayer for the one\nlying on a bed of suffering, Jesus makes the application. God speaks through\nhuman lips. The heart is reached. Humanity is brought into touch with\ndivinity.\nThe minister should understand by experience that the soothing power of\nthe grace of Christ brings health and peace and fulness of joy. He should\nknow Christ as the One who has invited the weary and heavy-laden to come\nto Him and \ufb01nd rest. Let him never forget that the Saviour\u2019s loving presence\nconstantly surrounds every human agent ordained of God for the impartation\nof spiritual blessing. The remembrance of this will give vitality to his faith\nand earnestness to his petitions.\nThen to those who call upon him for help he can impart the health-giving\npower of God\u2019s truth. He can talk of the words of healing wrought by Christ,\nand direct the minds of the sick to Him as the great Physician, who is light and\nlife, as well as comfort and peace. He can tell them that they need not despair,\nthat the Saviour loves them, and that if they surrender themselves to Him, they\nwill have His love, His grace, His keeping power. Let him urge them to rest\nin God\u2019s promises, knowing that He who has given these promises is our best\nand truest Friend. As he endeavors to direct the mind heavenward, he will\n\ufb01nd that the thought of the tender sympathy of the One who knows just how\nto apply the healing balm, will give the sick a sense of rest and quietude.\n214\nThe divine Healer is present in the sick-room; He hears every word of the\nprayers offered to Him in the simplicity of true faith. His disciples today are\nto pray for the sick, as verily as did the disciples of old. And there will be\nrecoveries; for \u201cthe prayer of faith shall save the sick.\u201d [James 5:15.] *****\nIn the word of God we have instruction relative to special prayer for the\nrecovery of the sick. But the offering of such prayer is a most solemn act,\nand should not be entered upon without careful consideration. In many cases\nof prayer for the healing of the sick, that which is called faith is nothing less\nthan presumption.\nMany persons bring disease upon themselves by their self-indulgence.\nThey have not lived in accordance with natural law or the principles of strict\npurity. Others have disregarded the laws of health in their habits of eating\nand drinking, dressing or working. Often some form of vice is the cause\nof feebleness of mind or body. Should these persons gain the blessing of\nhealth, many of them would continue to pursue the same course of heedless\ntransgression of God\u2019s natural and spiritual laws, reasoning that if God heals\nthem in answer to prayer, they are at liberty to continue their unhealthful\npractices and to indulge perverted appetite without restraint. If God were to\nwork a miracle in restoring these persons to health, He would be encouraging\nsin.\nIt is labor lost to teach people to look to God as a healer of their in\ufb01rmities,\nunless they are taught\n215\nalso to lay aside unhealthful practices. In order to receive His blessing in\nanswer to prayer, they must cease to do evil and learn to do well. Their\nsurroundings must be sanitary, their habits of life correct. They must live in\nharmony with the law of God, both natural and spiritual.\nConfession of Sin\nTo those who desire prayer for their restoration to health, it should be\nmade plain that the violation of God\u2019s law, either natural or spiritual, is sin,\nand that in order for them to receive His blessing, sin must be confessed and\nforsaken.\nThe Scripture bids us, \u201cConfess your faults one to another, and pray one\nfor another, that ye may be healed.\u201d [James 5:16.] To the one asking for\nprayer, let thoughts like these be presented, \u201cWe cannot read the heart, or\nknow the secrets of your life. These are known only to yourself and to God.\nIf you repent of your sins, it is your duty to make confession of them.\u201d\nSin of a private character is to be confessed to Christ, the only mediator\nbetween God and man. For \u201cif any man sin, we have an advocate with the\nFather, Jesus Christ the righteous.\u201d [1 John 2:1.] Every sin is an offense\nagainst God, and is to be confessed to Him through Christ. Every open sin\nshould be as openly confessed. Wrong done to a fellow-being should be made\nright with the one who has been offended. If any who are seeking health have\nbeen guilty of evil-speaking, if they have sowed discord in the home, the\nneighborhood, or the church, and have stirred up\n216\nalienation and dissension, if by any wrong practice they have led others into\nsin, these things should be confessed before God and before those who have\nbeen offended. \u201cIf we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us\nour sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\u201d [1 John 1:9.]\nWhen wrongs have been righted, we may present the needs of the sick to\nthe Lord in calm faith, as His Spirit may indicate. He knows each individual\nby name, and cares for each as if there were not another upon the earth for\nwhom He gave His beloved Son. Because God\u2019s love is so great and so\nunfailing, the sick should be encouraged to trust in Him and be cheerful. To\nbe anxious about themselves tends to cause weakness and disease. If they will\nrise above depression and gloom, their prospect of recovery will be better; for\n\u201cthe eye of the Lord is upon them\u201d \u201cthat hope in His mercy.\u201d [Psalm 33:18.]\nSubmission to God\u2019s Will\nIn praying for the sick, it should be remembered that \u201cwe know not what\nwe should pray for as we ought.\u201d [Romans 8:26.] We do not know whether\nthe blessing we desire will be best or not. Therefore our prayers should\ninclude this thought: \u201cLord, Thou knowest every secret of the soul. Thou\nart acquainted with these persons. Jesus, their Advocate, gave His life for\nthem. His love for them is greater than ours can possibly be. If, therefore,\nit is for Thy glory and the good of the af\ufb02icted ones, we ask, in the name of\nJesus, that they may be restored to health. If it be not Thy will that they may\nbe restored, we ask that\n217\nThy grace may comfort and Thy presence sustain them in their sufferings.\u201d\nGod knows the end from the beginning. He is acquainted with the hearts\nof all men. He reads every secret of the soul. He knows whether those\nfor whom prayer is offered would or would not be able to endure the trials\nthat would come upon them should they live. He knows whether their lives\nwould be a blessing or a curse to themselves and to the world. This is one\nreason why, while presenting our petitions with earnestness, we should say,\n\u201cNevertheless not my will, but Thine, be done.\u201d [Luke 22:42.] Jesus added\nthese words of submission to the wisdom and will of God when in the garden\nof Gethsemane He pleaded, \u201cO My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass\nfrom Me.\u201d [Matthew 26:39.] And if they were appropriate for Him, the Son of\nGod, how much more are they becoming on the lips of \ufb01nite, erring mortals!\nThe consistent course is to commit our desires to our all-wise heavenly\nFather, and then, in perfect con\ufb01dence, trust all to Him. We know that God\nhears us if we ask according to His will. But to press our petitions without a\nsubmissive spirit is not right; our prayers must take the form, not of command,\nbut of intercession.\nThere are cases where God works decidedly by His divine power in the\nrestoration of health. But not all the sick are healed. Many are laid away to\nsleep in Jesus. John on the Isle of Patmos was bidden to write, \u201cBlessed are\nthe dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that\nthey may rest from their labors; and their works do follow\n218\nthem.\u201d [Revelation 14:13.] From this we see that if persons are not raised to\nhealth, they should not, on this account, be judged as wanting in faith.\nWe all desire immediate and direct answers to our prayers, and are\ntempted to become discouraged when the answer is delayed or comes in an\nunlooked-for form. But God is too wise and good to answer our prayers\nalways at just the time and in just the manner we desire. He will do more\nand better for us than to accomplish all our wishes. And because we can\ntrust His wisdom and love, we should not ask Him to concede to our will,\nbut should seek to enter into and accomplish His purpose. Our desires and\ninterests should be lost in His will.\nThese experiences that test faith are for our bene\ufb01t. By them it is\nmade manifest whether our faith is true and sincere, resting on the word\nof God alone, or whether, depending on circumstances, it is uncertain and\nchangeable. Faith is strengthened by exercise. We must let patience have its\nperfect work, remembering that there are precious promises in the Scriptures\nfor those who wait upon the Lord.\nNot all understand these principles. Many who seek the Lord\u2019s healing\nmercy think that they must have a direct and immediate answer to their\nprayers or their faith is defective. For this reason those who are weakened\nby disease need to be counseled wisely, that they may act with discretion.\nThey should not disregard their duty to the friends who may survive them, or\nneglect to employ nature\u2019s agencies for the restoration of health.\nOften there is danger of error here. Believing that they will be healed in\nanswer to prayer, some fear to\n219\ndo anything that might seem to indicate a lack of faith. But they should not\nneglect to set their affairs in order as they would desire to do if they expected\nto be removed by death. Nor should they fear to utter words of encouragement\nor counsel which at the parting hour they wish to speak to their loved ones.\nRemedial Agencies\nThose who seek healing by prayer should not neglect to make use of the\nremedial agencies within their reach. It is not a denial of faith to use such\nremedies as God has provided to alleviate pain and to aid nature in her work\nof restoration. It is no denial of faith to co-operate with God, and to place\nthemselves in the condition most favorable to recovery. God has put it in\nour power to obtain a knowledge of the laws of life. This knowledge has\nbeen placed within our reach for use. We should employ every facility for the\nrestoration of health, taking every advantage possible, working in harmony\nwith natural laws. When we have prayed for the recovery of the sick, we\ncan work with all the more energy, thanking God that we have the privilege\nof co-operating with Him, and asking His blessing on the means which He\nHimself has provided.\nWe have the sanction of the word of God for the use of remedial agencies.\nHezekiah, king of Israel, was sick, and a prophet of God brought him the\nmessage that he should die. He cried unto the Lord, and the Lord heard His\nservant, and sent him a message that \ufb01fteen years should be added to his life.\nNow one word from God would have healed Hezekiah instantly; but special\ndirections were given, \u201cLet\n220\nthem take a lump of \ufb01gs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall\nrecover.\u201d [Isaiah 38:21.]\nOn one occasion Christ anointed the eyes of a blind man with clay, and\nbade him, \u201cGo, wash in the pool of Siloam.... He went his way therefore, and\nwashed, and came seeing.\u201d [John 9:7.] The cure could be wrought only by\nthe power of the great Healer, yet Christ made use of the simple agencies of\nnature. While He did not give countenance to drug medication, He sanctioned\nthe use of simple and natural remedies.\nWhen we have prayed for the recovery of the sick, whatever the outcome\nof the case, let us not lose faith in God. If we are called upon to meet\nbereavement, let us accept the bitter cup, remembering that a Father\u2019s hand\nholds it to our lips. But should health be restored, it should not be forgotten\nthat the recipient of healing mercy is placed under renewed obligation to the\nCreator. When the ten lepers were cleansed, only one returned to \ufb01nd Jesus\nand give Him glory. Let none of us be like the unthinking nine, whose hearts\nwere untouched by the mercy of God. \u201cEvery good gift and every perfect\ngift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is\nno variableness, neither shadow of turning.\u201d [James 1:17.]\u2014 The Ministry of\nHealing, 227-233.\n221\nTeaching the People to Be Liberal\nNever should the laborer who raises up little companies here and there,\ngive the impression to those newly come to the faith, that God does not require\nthem to work systematically in helping to sustain the cause by their personal\nlabors and by their means. Frequently those who receive the truth are among\nthe poor of this world; but they should not make this an excuse for neglecting\nthose duties which devolve upon them in view of the precious light they have\nreceived. They should not allow poverty to prevent them from laying up a\ntreasure in heaven. The blessings within reach of the rich are also within their\nreach. If they are faithful in using what little they do possess, their treasure\nin heaven will increase according to their \ufb01delity. It is the motive with which\nthey work, not the amount they do, that makes their offering valuable in the\nsight of Heaven.\nAll should be taught to do what they can for the Master; to render to Him\naccording as He has prospered them. He claims as His just due a tenth of their\nincome, be it large or small; and those who withhold this, commit robbery\ntoward Him, and cannot expect His prospering hand to be with them. Even\nif the church is composed mostly of poor brethren, the subject of systematic\nbenevolence should be thoroughly explained, and the plan heartily adopted.\nGod is able to ful\ufb01l His promises. His resources are in\ufb01nite, and He employs\nthem all in accomplishing His will. And when He sees a faithful performance\nof duty in the payment of the tithe, He often, in His wise providence,\n222\nopens ways whereby it shall increase. He who follows God\u2019s arrangement\nin the little that has been given him, will receive the same returns as he who\nbestows of his abundance.\nThe same is true also of those who cheerfully employ their talents of\nability in the cause of God, while those who fail to improve that which has\nbeen given them will incur the same loss as if that little had been much. It\nwas the man who had only one talent, but who hid that talent in the earth, that\nreceived the condemnation of the Lord. *****\nGod\u2019s plan in the tithing system is beautiful in its simplicity and equality.\nAll may take hold of it in faith and courage, for it is divine in its origin. In it\nare combined simplicity and utility, and it does not require depth of learning\nto understand and execute it. All may feel that they can act a part in carrying\nforward the precious work of salvation. Every man, woman, and youth may\nbecome a treasurer for the Lord, and may be an agent to meet the demands\nupon the treasury....\nGreat objects are accomplished by this system. If one and all would accept\nit, each would be made a vigilant and faithful treasurer for God; and there\nwould be no want of means with which to carry forward the great work of\nsounding the last message of warning to the world.\u2014 \u201cTestimonies for the\nChurch,\u201d V ol. III, pages 388, 389.\n223\nThe Support of the Gospel\nThe Lord has made the proclamation of the gospel dependent upon the\nlabors and the voluntary gifts of all His people. The one who proclaims\nthe message of mercy to fallen men has another work also,\u2014to set before\nthe people the duty of sustaining the work of God with their means. He\nmust teach them that a portion of their income belongs to God, and is to be\nsacredly devoted to His work. This lesson he should present by both precept\nand example; he should beware that he does not by his own course lessen the\nforce of his teaching.\nThat which has been set apart according to the Scriptures as belonging to\nthe Lord, constitutes the revenue of the gospel, and is no longer ours. It is no\nbetter than sacrilege for a man to take from God\u2019s treasury in order to serve\nhimself or to serve others in their secular business. Some have been at fault\nin diverting from the altar of God that which has been especially dedicated\nto Him. All should regard this matter in the right light. Let no one, when\nbrought into a strait place, take money consecrated to religious purposes, and\nuse it for his own advantage, soothing his conscience by saying that he will\nrepay it at some future time. Far better cut down the expenses to correspond\nwith the income, to restrict the wants and live within the means, than to use\nthe Lord\u2019s money for secular purposes.\nThe Use of the Tithe\nGod has given special direction as to the use of the tithe. He does not\ndesign that His work shall be crippled\n224\nfor want of means. That there may be no haphazard work and error, He has\nmade our duty on these points very plain. The portion that God has reserved\nfor Himself is not to be diverted to any other purpose than that which He has\nspeci\ufb01ed. Let none feel at liberty to retain their tithe, to use according to their\nown judgment. They are not to use it for themselves in an emergency, nor to\napply it as they see \ufb01t, even in what they may regard as the Lord\u2019s work.\nThe minister should, by precept and example, teach the people to regard\nthe tithe as sacred. He should not feel that he can retain and apply it according\nto his own judgment because he is a minister. It is not his. He is not at liberty\nto devote to himself whatever he thinks is his due. He should not give his\nin\ufb02uence to any plans for diverting from their legitimate use the tithes and\nofferings dedicated to God. They are to be placed in His treasury, and held\nsacred for His service as He has appointed.\nGod desires all His stewards to be exact in following divine arrangements.\nThey are not to offset the Lord\u2019s plans by performing some deed of charity,\nor giving some gift or some offering, when or how they, the human agents,\nshall see \ufb01t. It is very poor policy for men to seek to improve on God\u2019s plan,\nand invent a makeshift, averaging up their good impulses on this and that\noccasion, and offsetting them against God\u2019s requirements. God calls upon all\nto give their in\ufb02uence to His own arrangement. He has made His plan known;\nand all who would co-operate with Him must carry out this plan, instead of\ndaring to attempt an improvement on it.\n225\nThe Lord instructed Moses, for Israel, \u201cThou shalt command the children\nof Israel, that they may bring thee pure oil olive beaten for light, to cause\nthe lamp to burn always.\u201d [Exodus 27:20.] This was to be a continual\noffering, that the house of God might be properly supplied with that which\nwas necessary for His service. His people today are to remember that the\nhouse of worship is the Lord\u2019s property, and that it is to be scrupulously cared\nfor. But the funds for this work are not to come from the tithe.\nA very plain, de\ufb01nite message has been given to me for our people. I\nam bidden to tell them that they are making a mistake in applying the tithe to\nvarious objects, which, though good in themselves, are not the object to which\nthe Lord has said that the tithe should be applied. Those who make this use of\nthe tithe are departing from the Lord\u2019s arrangement. God will judge for these\nthings.\nOne reasons that the tithe may be applied to school purposes. Still others\nreason that canvassers and colporteurs should be supported from the tithe.\nBut a great mistake is made when the tithe is drawn from the object for which\nit is to be used\u2014the support of the ministers. There should be today in the\n\ufb01eld one hundred well-quali\ufb01ed laborers where now there is but one.\nA Solemn Obligation\nThe tithe is sacred, reserved by God for Himself. It is to be brought into\nHis treasury to be used to sustain the gospel laborers in their work. For a long\ntime the Lord has been robbed because there are those who\n226\ndo not realize that the tithe is God\u2019s reserved portion. Some have been\ndissatis\ufb01ed, and have said, \u201cI will not longer pay my tithe; for I have no\ncon\ufb01dence in the way things are managed at the heart of the work.\u201d But will\nyou rob God because you think the management of the work is not right?\nMake your complaint, plainly and openly, in the right spirit, to the proper\nones. Send in your petitions for things to be adjusted and set in order; but do\nnot withdraw from the work of God, and prove unfaithful, because others are\nnot doing right.\nRead carefully the third chapter of Malachi, and see what God says about\nthe tithe. If our churches will take their stand upon the Lord\u2019s word, and\nbe faithful in paying their tithe into His treasury, more laborers will be\nencouraged to take up ministerial work. More men would give themselves\nto the ministry were they not told of the depleted treasury. There should be\nan abundant supply in the Lord\u2019s treasury, and there would be if sel\ufb01sh hearts\nand hands had not withheld the tithes, or made use of them to support other\nlines of work.\nGod\u2019s reserved resources are to be used in no such haphazard way. The\ntithe is the Lord\u2019s, and those who meddle with it will be punished with the\nloss of their heavenly treasure, unless they repent. Let the work no longer be\nhedged up because the tithe has been diverted into various channels other than\nthe one to which the Lord has said it should go. Provision is to be made for\nthese other lines of work. They are to be sustained, but not from the tithe. God\nhas not changed; the tithe is still to be used for the support of the ministry.\nThe opening of new \ufb01elds\n227\nrequires more ministerial ef\ufb01ciency than we now have, and there must be\nmeans in the treasury.\nThose who go forth as ministers have a solemn responsibility devolving\nupon them, which is strangely neglected. Some enjoy preaching, but they do\nnot give personal labor to the churches. There is great need of instruction\nconcerning obligations and duties to God, especially in regard to paying\nan honest tithe. Our ministers would feel sadly aggrieved if they were not\npromptly paid for their labor; but will they consider that there must be meat\nin the treasure-house of God wherewith to sustain the laborers? If they fail\nto do their whole duty in educating the people to be faithful in paying to God\nHis own, there will be a shortage of means in the treasury to carry forward\nthe Lord\u2019s work.\nThe overseer of the \ufb02ock of God should faithfully discharge his duty.\nIf he takes the position that, because this is not pleasant to him, he will\nleave it for some one else to do, he is not a faithful worker. Let him read\nin Malachi the words of the Lord charging the people with robbery toward\nGod in withholding the tithes. The mighty God declares, \u201cYe are cursed with\na curse.\u201d [Malachi 3:9] When the one who ministers in word and doctrine sees\nthe people pursuing a course that will bring this curse upon them, how can he\nneglect his duty to give them instruction and warning? Every church-member\nshould be taught to be faithful in paying an honest tithe.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:246-251.\n228\nThe In\ufb02uence of Diet Upon Health\nThose upon whom rest important responsibilities, those, above all, who\nare guardians of spiritual interests, should be men of keen feeling and quick\nperception. More than others, they need to be temperate in eating. Rich and\nluxurious food should have no place upon their tables.\nEvery day men in positions of trust have decisions to make upon which\ndepend results of great importance. Often they have to think rapidly, and\nthis can be done successfully by those only who practice strict temperance.\nThe mind strengthens under the correct treatment of the physical and mental\npowers. If the strain is not too great, new vigor comes with every taxation.\nBut often the work of those who have important plans to consider and\nimportant decisions to make is affected for evil by the results of improper\ndiet. A disordered stomach produces a disordered, uncertain state of mind.\nOften it causes irritability, harshness, or injustice. Many a plan that would\nhave been a blessing to the world has been set aside, many unjust, oppressive,\neven cruel measures have been carried, as the result of diseased conditions\ndue to wrong habits of eating.\nHere is a suggestion for all whose work is sedentary or chie\ufb02y mental; let\nthose who have suf\ufb01cient moral courage and self-control try it. At each meal\ntake only two or three kinds of simple food, and eat no more than is required\nto satisfy hunger. Take active exercise every day, and see if you do not receive\nbene\ufb01t.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 309, 310.\n229\nSome ministers are not particular enough in regard to their habits of eating.\nThey partake of too large quantities of food, and of too great a variety at one\nmeal. Some are reformers in name only. They have no rules by which to\nregulate their diet, but indulge in eating fruit or nuts between their meals, and\nthus impose heavy burdens upon the digestive organs.\nBecause of imprudence in eating, the senses of some seem to be\nparalyzed, and they are sluggish and sleepy. These pale-faced ministers who\nare suffering in consequence of sel\ufb01sh indulgence of the appetite, are no\nrecommendation to health reform.\nWhen suffering from overwork, it would be much better to drop out a meal\noccasionally, and thus give nature a chance to rally. Our laborers could do\nmore by their example to advocate health reform than by preaching it. When\nelaborate preparations are made for them by well-meaning friends, they are\nstrongly tempted to disregard principle; but by refusing the dainty dishes, the\nrich condiments, the tea and coffee, they may prove themselves to be true,\npractical health reformers. *****\nThe indulgence of appetite beclouds and fetters the mind, and blunts the\nholy emotions of the soul. The mental and moral powers of some of our\nministers are enfeebled by improper eating and lack of physical exercise.\nThose who crave great quantities of food should not indulge the appetite,\nbut should practice self-denial, and retain the blessing of active muscles and\nunoppressed brain. Overeating stupe\ufb01es the entire being by diverting the\nenergies from the other organs to do the work of the stomach.\n230\nMinisters to Teach Health Reform\nOur ministers should become intelligent on health reform.... They should\nunderstand the laws that govern physical life, and their bearing upon the\nhealth of mind and soul. Thousands upon thousands know little of the\nwonderful body God has given them or of the care it should receive; they\nconsider it of more importance to study subjects of far less consequence. The\nministers have a work to do here. When they take a right position on this\nsubject, much will be gained. In their own lives and homes they should obey\nthe laws of life, practicing right principles and living healthfully. Then they\nwill be able to speak correctly on this subject, leading the people higher and\nstill higher in the work of reform. Living in the light themselves, they can\nbear a message of great value to those who are in need of just such testimony.\nThere are precious blessings and a rich experience to be gained if\nministers will combine the presentation of the health question with all their\nlabors in the churches. The people must have the light on health reform. This\nwork has been neglected, and many are ready to die because they need the\nlight which they ought to have and must have before they will give up sel\ufb01sh\nindulgences.\nThe presidents of our conferences need to realize that it is high time they\nwere placing themselves on the right side of this question. Ministers and\nteachers are to give to others the light they have received. Their work in every\nline is needed. God will help\n231\nthem; He will strengthen His servants who stand \ufb01rm, and will not be swayed\nfrom truth and righteousness in order to accommodate self-indulgence....\n*****\nThe light that the Lord has given on this subject in His word is plain, and\nmen will be tested and tried in many ways to see if they will heed it. Every\nchurch, every family, needs to be instructed in regard to Christian temperance.\nAll should know how to eat and drink in order to preserve health. We are amid\nthe closing scenes of this world\u2019s history; and there should be harmonious\naction in the ranks of Sabbath-keepers. Those who stand aloof from the great\nwork of instructing the people upon this question, do not follow where the\nGreat Physician leads the way.... *****\nThe gospel and the medical missionary work are to advance together. The\ngospel is to be bound up with the principles of true health reform. Christianity\nis to be brought into the practical life. Earnest, thorough reformatory work\nis to be done. True Bible religion is an out\ufb02owing of the love of God for\nfallen man. God\u2019s people are to advance in straightforward lines to impress\nthe hearts of those who are seeking for truth, who desire to act their part\naright in this intensely earnest age. We are to present the principles of health\nreform before the people, doing all in our power to lead men and women to\nsee the necessity of these principles, and to practice them.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church6:376-379.\n232\nHow to Present the Principles of Health\nReform\nThe Lord desires our ministers, physicians, and church-members to be\ncareful not to urge those who are ignorant of our faith to make sudden changes\nin diet, thus bringing men to a premature test. Hold up the principles of\nhealth reform, and let the Lord lead the honest in heart. They will hear and\nbelieve. Nor does the Lord require His messengers to present the beautiful\ntruths of healthful living in a way that will prejudice minds. Let no one\nput stumbling-blocks before the feet that are walking in the dark paths of\nignorance. Even in praising a good thing, it is well not to be too enthusiastic,\nlest you turn out of the way those who come to hear. Present the principles of\ntemperance in their most attractive form.\nWe must not move presumptuously. The laborers who enter new territory\nto raise up churches must not create dif\ufb01culties by attempting to make\nprominent the question of diet. They should be careful not to draw the lines\ntoo closely, for impediments would thus be thrown in the pathway of others.\nDo not drive the people; lead them.\nWherever the truth is carried, instruction should be given in regard to the\npreparation of wholesome foods. God desires that in every place the people\nshall be taught by skilful teachers how to utilize wisely the products that they\ncan raise or readily obtain in their section of the country. Thus the poor, as\nwell as those in better circumstances, can be taught to live healthfully.\n233\nThe Minister and Manual Work\nWhile Paul was careful to set before his converts the plain teaching\nof Scripture regarding the proper support of the work of God, and while\nhe claimed for himself, as a minister of the gospel, the \u201cpower to forbear\nworking\u201d [1 Corinthians 9:6.] at secular employment as a means of\nself-support, yet at various times during his ministry in the great centers of\ncivilization, he wrought at a handicraft for his own maintenance....\nIt is at Thessalonica that we \ufb01rst read of Paul\u2019s working with his hands\nin self-supporting labor while preaching the word. Writing to the church of\nbelievers there, he reminded them that he \u201cmight have been burdensome\u201d to\nthem, and added\u201d \u201cYe remember, brethren, our labor and travail: for laboring\nnight and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we\npreached unto you the gospel of God.\u201d [1 Thessalonians 2:6, 9.] And again, in\nhis second epistle to them, he declared that he and his fellow-laborers while\nwith them had not eaten \u201cany man\u2019s bread for naught.\u201d Night and day we\nworked, he wrote, \u201cthat we might not be chargeable to any of you: not because\nwe have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.\u201d\n[2 Thessalonians 3:8, 9.] ...\nWhen Paul \ufb01rst visited Corinth, he found himself among a people who\nwere suspicious of the motives of strangers. The Greeks on the seacoast were\nkeen traders. So long had they trained themselves in sharp business practices,\nthat they had come to believe that gain was godliness, and that to make money,\nwhether\n234\nby fair means or foul, was commendable. Paul was acquainted with their\ncharacteristics, and he would give them no occasion for saying that he\npreached the gospel in order to enrich himself. He might justly have claimed\nsupport from his Corinthian hearers; but this right he was willing to forego,\nlest his usefulness and success as a minister should be injured by the unjust\nsuspicion that he was preaching the gospel for gain. He would seek to remove\nall occasion for misrepresentation, that the force of his message might not be\nlost.\nSoon after his arrival at Corinth, Paul found \u201ca certain Jew named Aquila,\nborn in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla.\u201d These were\n\u201cof the same craft\u201d with himself. Banished by the decree of Claudius, which\ncommanded all Jews to leave Rome, Aquila and Priscilla had come to Corinth,\nwhere they established a business as manufacturers of tents. Paul made\ninquiry concerning them, and learning that they feared God and were seeking\nto avoid the contaminating in\ufb02uences with which they were surrounded, \u201che\nabode with them, and wrought....And he reasoned in the synagogue every\nSabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.\u201d [Acts 18:2-4.] ...\nDuring the long period of his ministry in Ephesus, where for three years\nhe carried forward an aggressive evangelistic effort throughout that region,\nPaul again worked at his trade. In Ephesus, as in Corinth, the apostle was\ncheered by the presence of Aquila and Priscilla, who had accompanied him\non his return to Asia at the close of his second missionary journey.\nThere were some who objected to Paul\u2019s toiling with his hands, declaring\nthat it was inconsistent with\n235\nthe work of a gospel minister. Why should Paul, a minister of the highest\nrank, thus connect mechanical work with the preaching of the word? Was not\nthe laborer worthy of his hire? Why should he spend in making tents time\nthat to all appearance could be put to better account?\nBut Paul did not regard as lost the time thus spent. As he worked with\nAquila, he kept in touch with the great Teacher, losing no opportunity of\nwitnessing for the Saviour, and of helping those who needed help. His mind\nwas ever reaching out for spiritual knowledge. He gave his fellow-workers\ninstruction in spiritual things, and he also set an example of industry and\nthoroughness. He was a quick, skilful worker, diligent in business, \u201cfervent\nin spirit, serving the Lord.\u201d [Romans 12:11.] As he worked at his trade,\nthe apostle had access to a class of people that he could not otherwise have\nreached. He showed his associates that skill in the common arts is a gift\nfrom God, who provides both the gift, and the wisdom to use it aright. He\ntaught that even in every-day toil, God is to be honored. His toil-hardened\nhands detracted nothing from the force of his pathetic appeals as a Christian\nminister....\nIf ministers feel that they are suffering hardship and privation in the cause\nof Christ, let them in imagination visit the workshop where Paul labored. Let\nthem bear in mind that while this chosen man of God is fashioning the canvas,\nhe is working for bread which he has justly earned by his labors as an apostle.\nWork is a blessing, not a curse. A spirit of indolence destroys godliness,\nand grieves the Spirit of God. A stagnant pool is offensive, but a pure, \ufb02owing\nstream\n236\nspreads health and gladness over the land. Paul knew that those who neglect\nphysical work soon become enfeebled. He desired to teach young ministers\nthat by working with their hands, by bringing into exercise their muscles and\nsinews, they would become strong to endure the toils and privations that\nawaited them in the gospel \ufb01eld. And he realized that his own teachings\nwould lack vitality and force if he did not keep all parts of the system properly\nexercised....\nNot all who feel that they have been called to preach, should be\nencouraged to throw themselves and their families at once upon the church for\ncontinuous \ufb01nancial support. There is danger that some of limited experience\nmay be spoiled by \ufb02attery, and by unwise encouragement to expect full\nsupport independent of any serious effort on their part. The means dedicated\nto the extension of the work of God should not be consumed by men who\ndesire to preach only that they may receive support, and thus gratify a sel\ufb01sh\nambition for an easy life.\nYoung men who desire to exercise their gifts in the work of the ministry\nwill \ufb01nd a helpful lesson in the example of Paul at Thessalonica, Corinth,\nEphesus, and other places. Although an eloquent speaker, and chosen by God\nto do a special work, he was never above labor, nor did he ever weary of\nsacri\ufb01cing for the cause he loved. \u201cEven unto this present hour,\u201d he wrote to\nthe Corinthians, \u201cwe both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted,\nand have no certain dwelling-place; and labor, working with our own hands:\nbeing reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it.\u201d [1 Corinthians 4:11,\n12.]\n237\nOne of the greatest of human teachers, Paul cheerfully performed the\nlowliest as well as the highest duties. When in his service for the Master\ncircumstances seemed to require it, he willingly labored at his trade.\nNevertheless, he ever held himself ready to lay aside his secular work in\norder to meet the opposition of the enemies of the gospel, or to improve a\nspecial opportunity to win souls to Jesus. His zeal and industry are a rebuke\nto indolence and a desire for ease.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 346-355. *****\nThe failure of some of our ministers to exercise all the organs of the body\nproportionately, causes some organs to become worn, while others are weak\nfrom inaction. If wear is left to come almost exclusively upon one organ\nor set of muscles, the one most used must become overwearied and greatly\nweakened.\nEach faculty of the mind and each muscle has its distinctive of\ufb01ce, and\nall must be equally exercised in order to become properly developed and to\nretain healthful vigor. Each organ has its work to do in the living organism.\nEvery wheel in the machinery must be a living, active, working wheel. All\nthe faculties have a bearing upon one another, and all need to be exercised in\norder to be properly developed.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church3:310.\n238\nOur Duty to Preserve Health\nI am pained at heart as I see so many feeble ministers, so many on beds of\nsickness, so many prematurely closing their earthly history,\u2014men who have\ncarried the burden of responsibility in the work of God, and whose whole\nheart was in their work. The conviction that they must cease their labor in\nthe cause they loved, was far more painful to them than their sufferings from\ndisease, or even the thought of death itself.\nOur heavenly Father does not willingly af\ufb02ict or grieve the children of\nmen. He is not the author of sickness and death; He is the source of life. He\nwould have men live; and He desires them to be obedient to the laws of life\nand health, that they may live.\nThose who accept the present truth and are sancti\ufb01ed through it, have an\nintense desire to represent the truth in their life and character. They have a\ndeep yearning of soul that others may see the light and rejoice in it. As the\ntrue watchman goes forth bearing precious seed, sowing beside all waters,\nweeping and praying, the burden of labor is very taxing to mind and heart.\nHe cannot keep up the strain continuously, his soul stirred to the very depths,\nwithout wearing out prematurely. Strength and ef\ufb01ciency are needed in every\ndiscourse. And from time to time, fresh supplies of things new and old need\nto be brought forth from the storehouse of God\u2019s word. This will impart life\nand power to the hearers. God does not want you to become so exhausted that\nyour efforts have no freshness or life.\n239\nThose who are engaged in constant mental labor, whether in studying or\npreaching, need rest and change. The earnest student is constantly taxing\nthe brain, too often while neglecting physical exercise; and as the result the\nbodily powers are enfeebled, and mental effort is restricted. Thus the student\nfails of accomplishing the very work that he might have done, had he labored\nwisely.\nIf they worked intelligently, giving both mind and body a due share of\nexercise, ministers would not so readily succumb to disease. If all our workers\nwere so situated that they could spend a few hours each day in outdoor labor,\nand felt free to do this, it would be a blessing to them; they would be able to\ndischarge more successfully the duties of their calling. If they have not time\nfor complete relaxation, they could be planning and praying while at work\nwith their hands, and could return to their labor refreshed in body and spirit.\nSome of our ministers feel that they must every day perform some labor\nthat they can report to the conference. And as the result of trying to do this,\ntheir efforts are too often weak and inef\ufb01cient. They should have periods of\nrest, of entire freedom from taxing labor. But these cannot take the place of\ndaily physical exercise.\nBrethren, when you take time to cultivate your garden, thus gaining the\nexercise needed to keep the system in good working order, you are just as\nmuch doing the work of God as in holding meetings. God is our Father; He\nloves us, and He does not require any of His servants to abuse their bodies.\n240\nAnother cause of ill-health and of inef\ufb01ciency in labor, is indigestion. It\nis impossible for the brain to do its best work when the digestive powers are\nabused. Many eat hurriedly of various kinds of food, which set up a war in\nthe stomach, and thus confuse the brain. The use of unhealthful food, and\novereating of even that which is wholesome, should alike be avoided.\nMany eat at all hours, regardless of the laws of health. Then gloom covers\nthe mind. How can men be honored with divine enlightenment, when they are\nso reckless in their habits, so inattentive to the light which God has given in\nregard to these things?\nBrethren, is it not time for you to be converted on these points of sel\ufb01sh\nindulgence? \u201cKnow ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one\nreceiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth\nfor the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain corruptible\ncrown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so \ufb01ght\nI, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into\nsubjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself\nshould be a castaway. [1 Corinthians 9:24-27.]\nInsuf\ufb01cient Diet\nDo not, however, feel it your duty to live on an insuf\ufb01cient diet. Learn for\nyourselves what you should eat, what kinds of food best nourish the body, and\nthen follow the dictates of reason and conscience. At meal-time cast off care\nand taxing thought. Do not be hurried, but eat slowly and with cheerfulness,\nyour heart \ufb01lled with gratitude to God for all His\n241\nblessings. And do not engage in brain labor immediately after a meal.\nExercise moderately, and give a little time for the stomach to begin its work.\nThese are not matters of tri\ufb02ing importance. We must pay attention\nto them if healthful vigor and a right tone are to be given to the various\nbranches of the work. The character and ef\ufb01ciency of the work depend largely\nupon the physical condition of the workers. Many committee meetings and\nother meetings for counsel have taken an unhappy tone from the dyspeptic\ncondition of those assembled. And many a sermon has received a dark\nshadow from the minister\u2019s indigestion.\nHealth is an inestimable blessing, and one which is more closely related to\nconscience and religion than many realize. It has a great deal to do with one\u2019s\ncapability. Every minister should feel that if he would be a faithful guardian\nof the \ufb02ock, he must preserve all his powers in condition for the best possible\nservice.\nOur workers should use their knowledge of the laws of life and health.\nRead the best authors on these subjects, and obey religiously that which your\nreason tells you is truth. *****\nThe Lord has presented before me that many, many will be rescued from\nphysical, mental, and moral degeneracy through the practical in\ufb02uence of\nhealth reform. Health talks will be given; publications will be multiplied.\nThe principles of health reform will be received with favor, and many ...will\nadvance step by step to receive the special truths for this time.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church6:378, 379.\n242\nDanger from Overwork\nWhen the apostles returned from their \ufb01rst missionary journey, the\nSaviour\u2019s command to them was, \u201cCome ye yourselves apart into a desert\nplace, and rest awhile.\u201d [Mark 6:31.] They had been putting their whole souls\ninto labor for the people, and this was exhausting their physical and mental\nstrength. It was their duty to rest.\nChrist\u2019s words of compassion are spoken to His workers today just as\nsurely as to His disciples. \u201cCome ye yourselves apart, ...and rest awhile,\u201d He\nsays to those who are worn and weary. It is not wise to be always under the\nstrain of work and excitement, even in ministering to men\u2019s spiritual needs;\nfor in this way personal piety is neglected, and the powers of mind and soul\nand body are overtaxed. Self-denial is required of the servants of Christ, and\nsacri\ufb01ces must be made; but God would have all study the laws of health, and\nuse reason when working for Him, that the life which He has given may be\npreserved.\nThough Jesus could work miracles, and had empowered His disciples to\nwork miracles, He directed His worn servants to go apart into the country\nand rest. When He said that the harvest was great and the laborers were few,\nHe did not urge upon His disciples the necessity of ceaseless toil, but said,\n\u201cPray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth laborers\ninto His harvest.\u201d [Matthew 9:38.] God has appointed to every man his work,\naccording to his ability; and\n243\nHe would not have a few weighted with responsibilities, while others have no\nburden, no travail of soul.\nThe servants of Christ are not to treat their health indifferently. Let no\none labor to the point of exhaustion, thereby disqualifying himself for future\neffort. Do not try to crowd into one day the work of two. At the end, those\nwho work carefully and wisely will be found to have accomplished as much\nas those who so expend their physical and mental strength that they have no\ndeposit from which to draw in time of need.\nGod\u2019s work is world-wide; it calls for every jot and tittle of the ability\nand power that we have. There is danger that His workers will abuse their\npowers as they see that the \ufb01eld is ripe for the harvest; but the Lord does\nnot require this. After His servants have done their best, they may say, The\nharvest truly is great, and the laborers are few; but God \u201cknoweth our frame;\nHe remembereth that we are dust.\u201d [Psalm 103:14.]\nIntemperance in eating and drinking, intemperance in labor, intemperance\nin almost everything, exists on every hand. Those who make great exertions\nto accomplish just so much in a given time, and continue to labor when their\njudgment tells them they ought to rest, are never gainers. They are expending\nforce that they will need at a future time. When the energy which they have\nso recklessly used is called for, they fail for lack of it. Physical strength is\ngone, and mental power is unavailable. Their time of need has come, and\ntheir resources are exhausted.\nEach day brings its responsibilities and duties, but the work of tomorrow\nmust not be crowded into the\n244\nhours of today. God is merciful, full of compassion, reasonable in His\nrequirements. He does not ask us to pursue a course of action that will result\nin the loss of physical health or the enfeebling of the mental powers. He\nwould not have us work under a pressure and strain until exhaustion follows,\nwith prostration of the nerves.\nThere is need that God\u2019s chosen workmen should listen to the command\nto go apart and rest awhile. Many valuable lives have been sacri\ufb01ced because\nof a disregard of this command. There are those who might be with us today,\nto help forward the cause both at home and in foreign lands, had they but\nrealized before it was too late that they were in need of rest. These workers\nsaw that the \ufb01eld is large and the need for workers great, and they felt that\nat any cost they must press on. When nature uttered a protest, they paid no\nheed, but did double the work they should have done; and God laid them in\nthe grave to rest until the last trump shall sound to call the righteous forth to\nimmortality.\nWhen a laborer has been under a heavy pressure of care and anxiety, and is\noverworked in both body and mind, he should turn aside and rest awhile, not\nfor sel\ufb01sh grati\ufb01cation, but that he may be better prepared for future duties.\nWe have a vigilant foe, who is ever on our track, ready to take advantage of\nevery weakness that would help to make his temptations effective. When the\nmind is overstrained and the body enfeebled, he presses upon the soul his\n\ufb01ercest temptations. Let the laborer carefully husband his strength, and when\nwearied with toil, let him turn aside and commune with Jesus.\n245\nI do not say this to those who are constitutionally tired, those who think\nthey are carrying heavier burdens than any one else. Those who do not labor\nhave no need of rest. There are always those who spare themselves, and who\ncome far short of bearing their share of responsibility. They can talk of great\nand crushing burdens, but they do not know what it means to bear them. Their\nwork yields but meager results.\nIt was to those worn down in His service, not to those who were always\nsparing themselves, that Christ addressed His gracious words. And today it\nis to the self-forgetful, those who work to the very extent of their ability, who\nare distressed because they cannot do more, and who in their zeal go beyond\ntheir strength, that the Saviour says, \u201cCome ye yourselves apart, ...and rest\nawhile.\u201d *****\nIn all who are under the training of God is to be revealed a life that is not\nin harmony with the world, its customs or its practices; and every one needs\nto have a personal experience in obtaining a knowledge of the will of God....\nHe bids us, \u201cBe still, and know that I am God.\u201d [Psalm 46:10.] Here alone\ncan true rest be found. And this is the effectual preparation for all labor for\nGod. Amid the hurrying throng, and the strain of life\u2019s intense activities, the\nsoul that is thus refreshed will be surrounded with an atmosphere of light and\npeace. The life will breathe out fragrance, and will reveal a divine power that\nwill reach men\u2019s hearts.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 363.\n246\n247\n248\nSection VII. Helps in Gospel\nWork\nBible Study\nMinisters who would labor effectively for the salvation of souls must be\nboth Bible students and men of prayer. It is a sin for those who attempt to\nteach the Word to others to be themselves neglectful of its study. Are the\ntruths which they handle mighty? then they should handle them skilfully.\nTheir ideas should be clearly and strongly presented. Of all men upon the\nface of the earth, those who are proclaiming the message for this time should\nunderstand their Bible, and be thoroughly acquainted with the evidences of\ntheir faith. One who does not possess a knowledge of the Word of life, has no\nright to try to instruct others in the way to heaven.\nThe Bible is our rule of faith and doctrine. There is nothing more\ncalculated to energize the mind and strengthen the intellect than the study\nof the word of God. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts or\ngive vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If\nGod\u2019s word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind,\na nobility of character, and a stability of purpose that are rarely seen in these\ntimes.\nThousands of men who minister in the pulpit are lacking in the essential\nqualities of mind and\n249\ncharacter because they do not apply themselves to the study of the Scriptures.\nThey are content with a super\ufb01cial knowledge of the truths of God\u2019s word,\nand they prefer to go on losing much in every way rather than to search\ndiligently for the hidden treasure.\nThe psalmist declares, \u201cThy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might\nnot sin against Thee.\u201d [Psalm 119:11.] And Paul wrote to Timothy, \u201cAll\nScripture is given by inspiration of God, and is pro\ufb01table for doctrine, for\nreproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God\nmay be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\u201d [2 Timothy 3:16,\n17.]\nThe life of God, which gives life to the world, is in His word. It was by\nHis word that Jesus healed disease and cast out demons. By His word He\nstilled the sea and raised the dead; and the people bore witness that His word\nwas with power. He spoke the word of God as He had spoken it to all the\nOld Testament writers. The whole Bible is a manifestation of Christ. It is our\nonly source of power.\nThis word does not repress activity. It opens before the conscientious\nsearcher channels for activity. It does not leave men in uncertainty, without\nan object, but places before them the highest of all aims,\u2014the winning of\nsouls to Christ. It puts in the hand a lamp that lights the way to heaven. It\ntells of unsearchable riches, treasure beyond estimate.\nThe word of God is the standard of character. In giving us this word, God\nhas put us in possession of every truth essential to salvation. Thousands have\ndrawn water from these wells of life, yet there is no diminishing of the supply.\nThousands have set the\n250\nLord before them, and by beholding have become changed into the same\nimage. But these searchers have not exhausted these grand and holy themes.\nThousands more may engage in the work of searching out the mysteries of\nsalvation.\nAs the worker studies the life of Christ, and the character of His mission is\ndwelt upon, each fresh search will reveal something more deeply interesting\nthan has yet been unfolded. The subject is inexhaustible. The study of the\nincarnation of Christ, His atoning sacri\ufb01ce and mediatorial work, will employ\nthe mind of the diligent student as long as time shall last; and looking to\nheaven with its unnumbered years, he will exclaim, \u201cGreat is the mystery of\ngodliness!\u201d [1 Timothy 3:16.]\nWe talk about the \ufb01rst angel\u2019s message and the second angel\u2019s message,\nand we think we have some understanding of the third angel\u2019s message. But\nas long as we are content with a limited knowledge, we shall be disquali\ufb01ed\nto obtain clearer views of truth. He who holds forth the word of life must\ntake time to study the Bible and to search his own heart. Neglecting this, he\nwill not know how to minister to needy souls. The diligent, humble student,\nseeking by earnest prayer and study for the truth as it is in Jesus, will most\nassuredly be rewarded. He seeks for help, not from ideas of human writers,\nbut from the Fountain of wisdom and knowledge; and under the guidance of\nholy intelligences he gains a clear understanding of truth.\nIt is not by the might or power of the human agent that truth is to be\nimpressed upon minds, \u201cbut\n251\nby My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d [Zechariah 4:6.] It is not the\ntemperament or the eloquence of the one who preaches the word that makes\nhis work successful. Paul may plant and Apollos water, but God gives the\nincrease. It is a minister\u2019s familiarity with God\u2019s word and his submission to\nthe divine will, that give success to his efforts.\nThe heart that receives the word of God is not as a pool that evaporates,\nnor like a broken cistern that loses its treasure. It is like the mountain stream\nfed by unfailing springs, whose cool, sparkling waters leap from rock to rock,\nrefreshing the weary, the thirsty, the heavy-laden.\nA familiarity with the truths of the Scripture will give the teacher of truth\nquali\ufb01cations that will make him a representative of Christ. The spirit of the\nSaviour\u2019s teaching will give force and directness to his instruction and to his\nprayers. His will not be a narrow, lifeless testimony; he will not preach over\nand over the same set discourses; for his mind will be open to the constant\nillumination of the Holy Spirit.\n\u201cWhoso eateth My \ufb02esh, and drinketh My blood,\u201d Christ said, \u201chath\neternal life.\u201d \u201cAs the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father: so\nhe that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me.\u201d \u201cIt is the spirit that quickeneth;\n...the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\u201d [John\n6:54, 57, 63.]\nWhen the servants of God know of a truth the meaning of these words,\nthe elements of eternal life will be found in the ministry. The tame, dull\nsermonizing will cease. The foundation truths of the gospel will be presented\nin a new light. There will be a fresh\n252\nperception of truth, a clearness and power that all will discern. Those who\nhave the privilege of sitting under such a ministry will, if susceptible to the\nHoly Spirit\u2019s in\ufb02uence, feel the energizing power of a new life. The \ufb01re of\nGod\u2019s love will be kindled within them. Their faculties will be quickened to\ndiscern the beauty and majesty of truth.\nThe minister who makes the word of God his constant companion will\ncontinually bring forth truth of new beauty. The Spirit of Christ will come\nupon him, and God will work through him to help others. The Holy Spirit\nwill \ufb01ll his mind and heart with hope and courage and Bible imagery, and all\nthis will be communicated to those under his instruction. *****\nIn the Bible we have the unerring counsel of God. Its teachings,\npractically carried out, will \ufb01t men for any position of duty. It is the voice\nof God speaking every day to the soul.... The work of the Holy Spirit is\nto enlighten the darkened understanding, to melt the sel\ufb01sh, stony heart,\nto subdue the rebellious transgressor, and save him from the corrupting\nin\ufb02uences of the world. The prayer of Christ for His disciples was, \u201cSanctify\nthem through Thy truth; Thy word is truth.\u201d The sword of the Spirit, which is\nthe word of God, pierces the heart of the sinner, and cuts it in pieces. When\nthe theory of the truth is repeated without its sacred in\ufb02uence being felt upon\nthe soul of the speaker, it has no force upon the hearers, but is rejected as error,\nthe speaker making himself responsible for the loss of souls.\u2014Testimonies for\nthe Church4:441.\n253\nSecret Prayer\nFamily prayer and public prayer have their place; but it is secret\ncommunion with God that sustains the soul-life. It was in the mount with\nGod that Moses beheld the pattern of that wonderful building which was to be\nthe abiding-place of His glory. It is in the mount with God\u2014the secret place\nof communion\u2014that we are to contemplate His glorious ideal for humanity.\nThus we shall be enabled so to fashion our character-building that to us may\nbe ful\ufb01lled the promise, \u201cI will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will\nbe their God, and they shall be My people.\u201d [2 Corinthians 6:16.]\nWhile engaged in our daily work, we should lift the soul to heaven in\nprayer. These silent petitions rise like incense before the throne of grace; and\nthe enemy is baf\ufb02ed. The Christian whose heart is thus stayed upon God\ncannot be overcome. No evil arts can destroy his peace. All the promises of\nGod\u2019s word, all the power of divine grace, all the resources of Jehovah, are\npledged to secure his deliverance. It was thus that Enoch walked with God.\nAnd God was with him, a present help in every time of need.\nChrist\u2019s ministers must watch unto prayer. They may come with boldness\nto the throne of grace, lifting up holy hands without wrath or doubting. In\nfaith they may supplicate the Father in heaven for wisdom and grace, that\nthey may know how to work, how to deal with minds.\nPrayer is the breath of the soul. It is the secret of spiritual power. No other\nmeans of grace can be\n254\nsubstituted, and the health of the soul be preserved. Prayer brings the heart\ninto immediate contact with the Well-spring of life, and strengthens the sinew\nand muscle of the religious experience. Neglect the exercise of prayer, or\nengage in prayer spasmodically, now and then, as seems convenient, and you\nlose your hold on God. The spiritual faculties lose their vitality, the religious\nexperience lacks health and vigor.\nIt is only at the altar of God that we can kindle our tapers with divine \ufb01re.\nIt is only the divine light that will reveal the littleness, the incompetence, of\nhuman ability, and give clear views of the perfection and purity of Christ. It\nis only as we behold Jesus that we desire to be like Him, only as we view His\nrighteousness that we hunger and thirst to possess it; and it is only as we ask\nin earnest prayer, that God will grant us our heart\u2019s desire.\nGod\u2019s messengers must tarry long with Him, if they would have success\nin their work. The story is told of an old Lancashire woman who was listening\nto the reasons that her neighbors gave for their minister\u2019s success. They spoke\nof his gifts, of his style of address, of his manners. \u201cNay,\u201d said the old woman,\n\u201cI will tell you what it is. Your man is very thick with the Almighty.\u201d\nWhen men are as devoted as Elijah was and possess the faith that he had,\nGod will reveal Himself as He did then. When men plead with the Lord as\ndid Jacob, the results that were seen then will again be seen. Power will come\nfrom God in answer to the prayer of faith.\nBecause the life of Jesus was a life of constant trust, sustained by\ncontinual communion, His service\n255\nfor heaven was without failure or faltering. Daily beset by temptation,\nconstantly opposed by the leaders of the people, Christ knew that He must\nstrengthen His humanity by prayer. In order to be a blessing to men, He must\ncommune with God, from Him obtaining energy, perseverance, steadfastness.\nThe Saviour loved the solitude of the mountain in which to hold\ncommunion with His Father. Through the day He labored earnestly to save\nmen from destruction. He healed the sick, comforted the mourning, called\nthe dead to life, and brought hope and cheer to the despairing. After His\nwork for the day was \ufb01nished, He went forth, evening after evening, away\nfrom the confusion of the city, and bowed in prayer to His Father. Frequently\nHe continued His petitions through the entire night; but He came from these\nseasons of communion invigorated and refreshed, braced for duty and for\ntrial.\nAre the ministers of Christ tempted and \ufb01ercely buffeted by Satan? So\nalso was He who knew no sin. In the hour of distress He turned to His Father.\nHimself a source of blessing and strength, He could heal the sick and raise\nthe dead; He could command the tempest, and it would obey Him; yet He\nprayed, often with strong crying and tears. He prayed for His disciples and\nfor Himself, thus identifying Himself with human beings. He was a mighty\npetitioner. As the Prince of life, He had power with God, and prevailed.\nMinisters who are truly Christ\u2019s representatives will be men of prayer.\nWith an earnestness and faith that will not be denied, they will plead with\nGod to strengthen and fortify them for service, and to sanctify\n256\ntheir lips by a touch of the living coal, that they may know how to speak His\nwords to the people.\nPrayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. The eye of faith\nwill discern God very near, and the suppliant may obtain precious evidence\nof the divine love and care for him. The prayer that Nathanael offered came\nfrom a sincere heart, and it was heard and answered by the Master. The Lord\nreads the hearts of all, and \u201cthe prayer of the upright is His delight.\u201d [Proverbs\n15:8.] He will not be slow to hear those who open their hearts to Him, not\nexalting self, but sincerely feeling their weakness and unworthiness.\nThere is need of prayer, earnest, fervent, agonizing prayer, such prayer as\nDavid offered when he exclaimed, \u201cAs the hart panteth after the water brooks,\nso panteth my soul after Thee, O God.\u201d \u201cI have longed after Thy precepts.\u201d\n\u201cI have longed for Thy salvation.\u201d \u201cMy soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for\nthe courts of the Lord: my heart and my \ufb02esh crieth out for the living God.\u201d\n[Psalm 42:1; 119:40, 174; Psalm 84:2.]\nThose who teach and preach the most effectively are those who wait\nhumbly upon God, and watch hungrily for His guidance and His grace.\nWatch, pray, work\u2014this is the Christian\u2019s watchword. The life of a true\nChristian is a life of constant prayer. He knows that the light and strength\nof one day is not suf\ufb01cient for the trials and con\ufb02icts of the next. Satan\nis continually changing his temptations. Every day we shall be placed in\ndifferent circumstances; and in the untried scenes that await us we shall be\nsurrounded by fresh dangers, and constantly assailed by new and unexpected\ntemptations. It is only\n257\nthrough the strength and grace gained from heaven that we can hope to meet\nthe temptations and perform the duties before us.\nIt is a wonderful thing that we can pray effectually; that unworthy, erring\nmortals possess the power of offering their requests to God. What higher\npower can man desire than this,\u2014to be linked with the in\ufb01nite God? Feeble,\nsinful man has the privilege of speaking to his Maker. We may utter words\nthat reach the throne of the Monarch of the universe. We may speak with\nJesus as we walk by the way, and He says, I am at thy right hand. [See Psalm\n16:8.]\nWe may commune with God in our hearts; we may walk in\ncompanionship with Christ. When engaged in our daily labor, we may breathe\nout our heart\u2019s desire, inaudible to any human ear; but that word cannot die\naway into silence, nor can it be lost. Nothing can drown the soul\u2019s desire. It\nrises above the din of the street, above the noise of machinery. It is God to\nwhom we are speaking, and our prayer is heard.\nAsk, then; ask, and ye shall receive. Ask for humility, wisdom, courage,\nincrease of faith. To every sincere prayer an answer will come. It may not\ncome just as you desire, or at the time you look for it; but it will come in the\nway and at the time that will best meet your need. The prayers you offer in\nloneliness, in weariness, in trial, God answers, not always according to your\nexpectations, but always for your good.\n258\nFaith\nThe greatest victories gained for the cause of God are not the result of\nlabored argument, ample facilities, wide in\ufb02uence, or abundance of means;\nthey are gained in the audience chamber with God, when with earnest,\nagonizing faith men lay hold upon the mighty arm of power.\nTrue faith and true prayer\u2014how strong they are! They are as two arms by\nwhich the human suppliant lays hold upon the power of In\ufb01nite Love. Faith\nis trusting in God,\u2014believing that He loves us, and knows what is for our\nbest good. Thus, instead of our own way, it leads us to choose His way. In\nplace of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in place of our weakness, His\nstrength; in place of our sinfulness, His righteousness. Our lives, ourselves,\nare already His; faith acknowledges His ownership, and accepts its blessings.\nTruth, uprightness, purity, are pointed out as secrets of life\u2019s success. It is\nfaith that puts us in possession of these. Every good impulse or aspiration is\nthe gift of God; faith receives from God the life that alone can produce true\ngrowth and ef\ufb01ciency.\n\u201cThis is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith,\u201d [1 John\n5:4.] It is faith that enables us to look beyond the present, with its burdens\nand cares, to the great hereafter, where all that now perplexes us shall be\nmade plain. Faith sees Jesus standing as our Mediator at the right hand of\nGod. Faith beholds the mansions that Christ has gone to prepare for those\nwho love Him. Faith sees the robe and crown prepared\n259\nfor the overcomer, and hears the song of the redeemed.\nPerfect faith, the surrender of self to God, simple trust in His pledged\nword, should be a part of every minister\u2019s experience. Only as a minister has\nthis experience can he make the subject of faith plain to the doubting and\ndistrustful.\nFaith is not feeling. \u201cFaith is the substance of things hoped for, the\nevidence of things not seen.\u201d [Hebrews 11:1.] True faith is in no sense allied\nto presumption. Only he who has true faith is secure against presumption, for\npresumption is Satan\u2019s counterfeit of faith.\nFaith claims God\u2019s promises and brings forth fruit in obedience.\nPresumption also claims the promises, but uses them as Satan did, to excuse\ntransgression. Faith would have led our \ufb01rst parents to trust the love of God\nand to obey His commands. Presumption led them to transgress His law,\nbelieving that His great love would save them from the consequences of their\nsin. It is not faith that claims the favor of Heaven without complying with the\nconditions on which mercy is to be granted. Genuine faith has its foundation\nin the promises and provisions of the Scriptures.\nTo talk of religion in a casual way, to pray without soul-hunger and living\nfaith, avails nothing. A nominal faith in Christ, which accepts Him merely as\nthe Saviour of the world, can never bring healing to the soul. The faith that is\nunto salvation is not a mere intellectual assent to the truth. He who waits for\nentire knowledge before he will exercise faith, cannot receive blessing from\nGod.\n260\nIt is not enough to believeabout Christ; we must believein Him. The only\nfaith that will bene\ufb01t us is that which embraces Him as a personal Saviour;\nwhich appropriates His merits to ourselves. Many hold faith as an opinion.\nBut saving faith is a transaction, by which those who receive Christ join\nthemselves in covenant relation with God. Genuine faith is life. A living\nfaith means an increase of vigor, a con\ufb01ding trust, by which the soul becomes\na conquering power.\nUnbelief and Doubt\nFaith takes God at His word, not asking to understand the meaning of the\ntrying experiences that come. But there are many who have little faith. They\nare always fearing and borrowing trouble. Every day they are surrounded by\nthe tokens of God\u2019s love, every day they enjoy the bounties of His providence;\nbut they overlook these blessings. And the dif\ufb01culties they encounter, instead\nof driving them to God, separate them from Him, by arousing unrest and\nrepining.\nDo they well to be thus unbelieving? Jesus is their friend. All heaven is\ninterested in their welfare, and their fear and repining grieve the Holy Spirit.\nNot because we see or feel that God hears us are we to believe. We are to trust\nHis promises. When we come to Him in faith, we should believe that every\npetition enters into the heart of Christ. When we have asked for His blessing,\nwe should believe that we receive it, and thank Him that we have it. Then\nwe are to go about our duties, assured that the blessing will be sent when we\nneed it most. When we have\n261\nlearned to do this, we shall know that our prayers are answered. God will\ndo for us \u201cexceeding abundantly,\u201d \u201caccording to the riches of His glory,\u201d and\n\u201cthe working of His mighty power.\u201d [Ephesians 3:20, 16, 19.]\nOften the Christian life is beset with dangers, and duty seems hard to\nperform. The imagination pictures impending ruin before, and bondage and\ndeath behind. Yet the voice of God speaks clearly, Go forward. Let us\nobey the command, even though our sight cannot penetrate the darkness.\nThe obstacles that hinder our progress will never disappear before a halting,\ndoubting spirit. Those who defer obedience till every uncertainty disappears,\nand there remains no risk of failure or defeat, will never obey. Faith looks\nbeyond the dif\ufb01culties, and lays hold of the unseen, even Omnipotence,\ntherefore it cannot be baf\ufb02ed. Faith is the clasping of the hand of Christ\nin every emergency.\nThe worker for God needs strong faith. Appearances may seem\nforbidding; but in the darkest hour there is light beyond. The strength of\nthose who, in faith, love and serve God, will be renewed day by day. The\nunderstanding of the In\ufb01nite is placed at their service, that in carrying out\nHis purposes they may not err. Let these workers hold the beginning of their\ncon\ufb01dence \ufb01rm unto the end, remembering that the light of God\u2019s truth is to\nshine amid the darkness that enshrouds our world.\nThere is to be no despondency in connection with God\u2019s service. The\nfaith of the consecrated worker is to stand every test brought upon it. God is\nable and willing to bestow upon His servants all the\n262\nstrength they need, and to give them the wisdom that their varied necessities\ndemand. He will more than ful\ufb01l the highest expectations of those who put\ntheir trust in Him.\nJesus does not call on us to follow Him, and then forsake us. If we\nsurrender our lives to His service, we can never be placed in a position for\nwhich God has not made provision. Whatever may be our situation, we have a\nGuide to direct our way; whatever our perplexities, we have a sure Counselor;\nwhatever our sorrow, bereavement, or loneliness, we have a sympathizing\nFriend. If in our ignorance we make missteps, Christ does not leave us. His\nvoice, clear and distinct, is heard, saying, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the\nlife.\u201d [John 14:6.] \u201cHe shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,\nand him that hath no helper.\u201d [Psalm 72:12.]\n\u201cThou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on Thee:\nbecause he trusteth in Thee.\u201d [Isaiah 26:3.] The arm of Omnipotence is\noutstretched to lead us onward and still onward. Go forward, the Lord says; I\nwill send you help. It is for My name\u2019s glory that you ask; and you shall\nreceive. Those who are watching for your failure shall yet see My word\ntriumph gloriously. \u201cAll things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,\nye shall receive.\u201d [Matthew 21:22.] *****\nGod never leaves the world without men who can discern between good\nand evil, righteousness and unrighteousness. He has men whom He has\nappointed to stand in the forefront of the battle in times of emergency.\n263\nCourage\nGod\u2019s servants are not to be easily discouraged by dif\ufb01culties or\nopposition. Those who proclaim the third angel\u2019s message must stand bravely\nat their post, in the face of detraction and falsehood, \ufb01ghting the good \ufb01ght of\nfaith, and resisting the enemy with the weapon that Christ used, \u201cIt is written.\u201d\nIn the great crisis through which they are soon to pass, the servants of God\nwill encounter the same hardness of heart, the same cruel determination, the\nsame unyielding hatred, encountered by Christ and the apostles.\nAll who in that evil day would faithfully serve God according to the\ndictates of conscience, will need courage, \ufb01rmness, and a knowledge of God\nand His word; for those who are true to God will be persecuted, their motives\nwill be impugned, their best efforts misinterpreted, and their names cast out\nas evil.\nSatan will work with his deceptive power to in\ufb02uence the heart and\nbecloud the understanding, to make evil appear good, and good evil.\nThe stronger and purer the faith of God\u2019s people, and the \ufb01rmer their\ndetermination to obey Him, the more \ufb01ercely will Satan strive to stir up\nagainst them the rage of those who, while claiming to be righteous, trample\nupon the law of God. It will require the \ufb01rmest trust, the most heroic purpose,\nto hold fast the faith once delivered to the saints.\nThe messengers of the cross must arm themselves with watchfulness and\nprayer, and move forward in\n264\nfaith and courage, working always in the name of Jesus. They must have\ncon\ufb01dence in their Leader; for troublous times are before us. The judgments\nof God are abroad in the land. Calamities follow one another in rapid\nsuccession. Soon God is to rise out of His place to shake terribly the earth,\nand to punish the wicked for their iniquity. Then He will stand up in behalf\nof His people, and will give them His protecting care. He will throw His\neverlasting arms about them, to shield them from all harm.\n\u201cCourage in the Lord\u201d\nAfter the passing of the time in 1844, a number of brethren and sisters\nwere assembled in a meeting. All were very sad, for the disappointment had\nbeen sore. Presently a man came in, crying, \u201cCourage in the Lord, brethren;\ncourage in the Lord!\u201d This he repeated again and again, till every face was\naglow, and every voice lifted in praise to God.\nToday I say to every worker for the Master, \u201cCourage in the Lord!\u201d Ever\nsince 1844 I have been proclaiming present truth, and today this truth is dearer\nto me than ever before.\nSome look always at the objectionable and discouraging features, and\ntherefore discouragement overtakes them. They forget that the heavenly\nuniverse is waiting to make them agencies of blessing to the world; and\nthat the Lord Jesus is a never-failing storehouse from which human beings\nmay draw strength and courage. There is no need for despondency and\napprehension. The time will never come when the shadow of Satan will not\nbe cast athwart\n265\nour pathway. Thus the enemy seeks to hide the light shining from the Sun of\nRighteousness. But our faith should pierce this shadow.\nGod calls for cheerful co-workers, who refuse to become discouraged and\ndisheartened by opposing agencies. The Lord is leading us, and we may go\nforward courageously, assured that He will be with us, as He was in past\nyears, when we labored in feebleness, but under the power of the Holy Spirit.\nAngels ministered to Christ, but their presence did not make His life\none of ease and freedom from temptation. He \u201cwas in all points tempted\nlike as we are, yet without sin.\u201d [Hebrews 4:15.] If ministers, while\nengaged in the work that the Master has appointed them, have trials and\nperplexities and temptations, should they be discouraged? Should they\ncast away their con\ufb01dence because their labors do not always bring the\nresults that they so greatly desire to see? True workers will not despond\nin view of the work before them, arduous though it may be. Shrinking from\nhardship, complaining under tribulation, makes the servants of God weak and\ninef\ufb01cient.\nAs those who stand in the forefront of the battle see that the special\nwarfare of Satan is directed against them, they will realize their need of\nstrength from God, and they will labor in His strength. The victories that\nthey gain will not exalt them, but will cause them to lean more securely upon\nthe Mighty One. Deep and fervent gratitude to God will spring up in their\nhearts, and they will be joyful in the tribulation that comes to them while\npressed by the enemy.\n266\nA Season of Trust and Privilege\nThe present is a season of solemn privilege and sacred trust. If the servants\nof God keep faithfully the trust given to them, great will be their reward when\nthe Master shall say, \u201cGive an account of thy stewardship.\u201d [Luke 16:2.]\nThe earnest toil, the unsel\ufb01sh work, the patient, persevering effort, will be\nabundantly rewarded. Jesus will say, Henceforth I call you not servants, but\nfriends. [See John 15:15.] The approval of the Master is not given because\nof the greatness of the work performed, but because of \ufb01delity in all that has\nbeen done. It is not the results we attain, but the motives from which we act,\nthat weigh with God. He prizes goodness and faithfulness above all else.\nI entreat the heralds of the gospel of Christ never to become discouraged,\nnever to regard the most hardened sinner as beyond the reach of the grace\nof God. The one apparently hopeless may accept the truth in the love of it.\nHe who turns the hearts of men as the rivers of water are turned, can bring\nthe most sel\ufb01sh, sin-hardened soul to Christ. Is anything too hard for God\nto do? \u201cMy word,\u201d He declares, \u201cshall not return unto Me void, but it shall\naccomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent\nit.\u201d [Isaiah 55:11.]\nThose who are endeavoring to build up the work in new territory will\noften \ufb01nd themselves in great need of better facilities. Their work will seem\nto be hindered for lack of these facilities; but let them not lose their faith and\ncourage. Often they are obliged to go to the limit of their resources. At times\nit may seem\n267\nas if they could advance no farther. But if they pray and work in faith,\nGod will answer their petitions, sending them means for the advancement\nof the work. Dif\ufb01culties will arise; they will wonder how they are going to\naccomplish what must be done. At times the future will look very dark. But\nlet the workers bring to God the promises He has made, and thank Him for\nwhat He has done. Then the way will open before them, and they will be\nstrengthened for the duty of the hour. *****\nFew realize the signi\ufb01cance of the words of Luke, that when Paul saw his\nbrethren, \u201che thanked God, and took courage.\u201d [Acts 28:15.] In the midst of\nthe weeping, sympathizing company of believers, who were not ashamed of\nhis bonds, the apostle praised God aloud. The cloud of sadness that had rested\nupon his spirit was swept away. His Christian life had been a succession of\ntrials, sufferings, and disappointments, but in that hour he felt abundantly\nrepaid. With \ufb01rmer step and joyful heart he continued on his way. He would\nnot complain of the past, nor fear for the future. Bonds and af\ufb02ictions awaited\nhim, he knew; but he knew also that it had been his to deliver souls from a\nbondage in\ufb01nitely more terrible, and he rejoiced in his sufferings for Christ\u2019s\nsake.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 449.\n268\nHow God Trains His Workers\nThe Lord disciplines His workers, that they may be prepared to \ufb01ll\nthe places appointed them. He desires to \ufb01t them to do more acceptable\nservice. There are those who wish to be a ruling power, and who need\nthe sancti\ufb01cation of submission. God brings about a change in their lives.\nPerhaps He places before them duties that they would not choose. If they\nare willing to be guided by Him, He will give them grace and strength to\nperform these duties in a spirit of submission and helpfulness. Thus they are\nbeing quali\ufb01ed to \ufb01ll places where their disciplined abilities will make them\nof great service.\nSome God trains by bringing to them disappointment and apparent failure.\nIt is His purpose that they shall learn to master dif\ufb01culties. He inspires them\nwith a determination to prove every apparent failure a success. Often men\npray and weep because of the perplexities and obstacles that confront them.\nBut if they will hold the beginning of their con\ufb01dence steadfast unto the end,\nGod will make their way clear. Success will come as they struggle against\napparently insurmountable dif\ufb01culties and with success will come the greatest\njoy.\nA life of monotony is not the most conducive to spiritual growth. Some\ncan reach the highest standard of spirituality only through a change in the\nregular order of things. When in His providence God sees that changes are\nessential for the success of the character-building, He disturbs the smooth\ncurrent of the life. He sees that a worker needs to be more\n269\nclosely associated with Him; and to bring this about, He separates him from\nfriends and acquaintances. When He was preparing Elijah for translation,\nGod moved him from place to place, that the prophet might not settle down\nat ease, and thus fail of gaining spiritual power. And it was God\u2019s design that\nElijah\u2019s in\ufb02uence should be a power to help many souls to gain a wider, more\nhelpful experience.\nThere are many who are not satis\ufb01ed to serve God cheerfully in the place\nthat He has marked out for them, or to do uncomplainingly the work that He\nhas placed in their hands. It is right to be dissatis\ufb01ed with the way in which\nwe perform duty, but we are not to be dissatis\ufb01ed with the duty itself because\nwe would rather do something else. In His providence God places before\nhuman beings service that will be as medicine to their diseased minds. Thus\nHe seeks to lead them to put aside the sel\ufb01sh preference, which, if grati\ufb01ed,\nwould disqualify them for the work He has for them. If they accept and\nperform this service, their minds will be cured. If they refuse it, they will be\nleft at strife with themselves and others.\nLet those who are not permitted to rest in quietude, but who must be\ncontinually on the move, pitching their tent tonight in one place and tomorrow\nnight in another place, remember that the Lord is leading them and that this\nis His way of helping them to form perfect characters. In all the changes that\nthey are required to make, God is to be recognized as their companion, their\nguide, their dependence.\n270\nTake Time to Talk with God\nSpecial instruction has been given me in regard to our ministers. It is\nnot God\u2019s will that they should seek to be rich. They should not engage in\nworldly enterprises; for this disquali\ufb01es them for giving their best powers to\nspiritual things. But they are to receive wages enough to support themselves\nand their families. They are not to have so many burdens laid upon them that\nthey cannot give proper attention to the church in their own family; for it is\ntheir special duty to train their children for the Lord.\nIt is a great mistake to keep a minister constantly at work in business\nlines, going from place to place, and sitting up late at night in attendance at\nboard meetings and committee meetings. This brings upon him weariness\nand discouragement. Ministers should have time to rest, to obtain from God\u2019s\nword the rich nourishment of the bread of life. They should have time to drink\nrefreshing draughts of consolation from the stream of living water.\nLet ministers and teachers remember that God holds them accountable to\n\ufb01ll their of\ufb01ce to the best of their ability, to bring into their work their very\nbest powers. They are not to take up duties that con\ufb02ict with the work that\nGod has given them.\nWhen ministers and teachers, pressed under the burden of \ufb01nancial\nresponsibilities, enter the pulpit or the schoolroom with wearied brain and\novertaxed nerves, what else can be expected than that common \ufb01re will be\nused instead of the sacred \ufb01re of God\u2019s kindling? The strained, tattered efforts\ndisappoint\n271\nthe listeners and hurt the speaker. He has had no time to seek the Lord, no\ntime to ask in faith for the unction of the Holy Spirit....\nI am instructed to say to my fellow-workers, If you would have the rich\ntreasures of heaven, you must hold secret communion with God. Unless you\ndo this, your soul will be as destitute of the Holy Spirit as were the hills of\nGilboa of dew and rain. When you hurry from one thing to another, when you\nhave so much to do that you cannot take time to talk with God, how can you\nexpect power in your work?\nThe reason so many of our ministers preach tame, lifeless discourses is\nthat they allow a variety of things of a worldly nature to take their time and\nattention. Unless there is constant growth in grace, we shall be wanting in\nwords suitable for the occasion. Commune with your own heart, and then\ncommune with God. Unless you do this, your efforts will be fruitless, made\nthus by unsancti\ufb01ed hurry and confusion.\nMinisters and teachers, let your work be fragrant with rich spiritual grace.\nDo not make it common by mixing it with common things. Move onward\nand upward. Cleanse yourselves \u201cfrom all \ufb01lthiness of the \ufb02esh and spirit,\nperfecting holiness in the fear of God.\u201d [2 Corinthians 7:1.]\nWe need to be converted daily. Our prayers should be more fervent; then\nthey will be more effectual. Stronger and stronger should be our con\ufb01dence\nthat God\u2019s Spirit will be with us, making us pure and holy, as upright and\nfragrant as the cedar of Lebanon.\u2014 \u201cTestimonies for the Church,\u201d V ol. VII,\npages 250-252.\n272\nOur Greatest Need\n\u201cYe shall be witnesses unto Me.\u201d [Acts 1:8.] These words of Jesus have\nlost none of their force. Our Saviour calls for faithful witnesses in these days\nof religious formalism; but how few, even among the professed ambassadors\nfor Christ, are ready to give a faithful, personal testimony for their Master!\nMany can tell what the great and good men of generations past have done, and\ndared, and suffered, and enjoyed. They become eloquent in setting forth the\npower of the gospel, which has enabled others to rejoice in trying con\ufb02icts,\nand to stand \ufb01rm against \ufb01erce temptations. But while so earnest in bringing\nforward other Christians as witnesses for Jesus, they seem to have no fresh,\ntimely experience of their own to relate.\nMinisters of Christ, what have you to say for yourselves? What soul\ncon\ufb02icts have you experienced that have been for your good, for the good\nof others, and for the glory of God? You who profess to be proclaiming\nthe last solemn message of mercy to the world, what is your experience\nin the knowledge of the truth, and what has been its effect upon your own\nhearts? Does your character testify for Christ? Can you speak of the re\ufb01ning,\nennobling, sanctifying in\ufb02uence of the truth as it is in Jesus? What have\nyou seen, what have you known, of the power of Christ? This is the kind of\nwitness for which the Lord calls, and for which the churches are suffering.\n273\nWithout a living faith in Christ as a personal Saviour, it is impossible to\nmake your faith felt in a skeptical world. If you would draw sinners out of the\nswift-running current, your own feet must not stand on slippery places.\nWe need constantly a fresh revelation of Christ, a daily experience that\nharmonizes with His teachings. High and holy attainments are within our\nreach. Continual progress in knowledge and virtue is God\u2019s purpose for us.\nHis law is the echo of His own voice, giving to all the invitation, \u201cCome up\nhigher; be holy, holier still.\u201d Every day we may advance in perfection of\nChristian character.\nThose who are engaged in service for the Master need an experience much\nhigher, deeper, broader, than many have yet thought of having. Many who\nare already members of God\u2019s great family know little of what it means to\nbehold His glory, and to be changed from glory to glory. Many have a twilight\nperception of Christ\u2019s excellence, and their hearts thrill with joy. They long\nfor a fuller, deeper sense of the Saviour\u2019s love. Let these cherish every desire\nof the soul after God.\nThe Holy Spirit works with those who will be worked, moulds those who\nwill be moulded, fashions those who will be fashioned. Give yourselves the\nculture of spiritual thoughts and holy communings. You have seen but the\n\ufb01rst rays of the early dawn of His glory. As you follow on to know the Lord,\nyou will know that the \u201cpath of the righteous is as the light of dawn, that\nshineth more and more unto the perfect day.\u201d [Proverbs 4:18, R. V .]\n274\nSelf-Examination\nThere is much in the conduct of ministers that they can improve. Many\nsee and feel their lack, yet they seem to be ignorant of the in\ufb02uence they exert.\nThey are conscious of their actions as they perform them, but suffer them to\npass from their memory, and therefore do not reform.\nLet ministers make the actions of each day a subject of careful thought and\ndeliberate review, with the object of becoming better acquainted with their\nown habits of life. By a close scrutiny of every circumstance of the daily life,\nthey would know better their own motives and the principles which govern\nthem. This daily review of our acts, to see whether conscience approves\nor condemns, is necessary for all who wish to reach perfection of Christian\ncharacter. Many acts which pass for good works, even deeds of benevolence,\nwill, when closely investigated, be found to be prompted by wrong motives.\nMany receive applause for virtues which they do not possess. The\nSearcher of hearts weighs the motives, and often deeds highly applauded by\nmen are recorded by Him as springing from sel\ufb01shness and base hypocrisy.\nEvery act of our lives, whether excellent and praiseworthy, or deserving of\ncensure, is judged by the Searcher of hearts according to the motives which\nprompted it.\nMany neglect to look at themselves in the mirror which reveals the defects\nin the character; therefore deformity and sin exist, and are apparent to others,\nif not understood by those who are in fault. The\n275\nhateful sin of sel\ufb01shness exists to a great degree, even in some who profess to\nbe devoted to the work of God. If they would compare their character with His\nrequirements, especially with the great standard, God\u2019s holy law, they would\nascertain, if earnest, honest searchers, that they are fearfully wanting. But\nsome are not willing to look far enough or deep enough to see the depravity\nof their own hearts. They are wanting in very many respects, yet they remain\nin willing ignorance of their guilt. *****\nHe who understands well his own character, who is acquainted with the\nsin that most easily besets him, and the temptations that are the most likely to\novercome him, should not expose himself needlessly, and invite temptation by\nplacing himself on the enemy\u2019s ground. If duty calls him where circumstances\nare not favorable, he will have special help from God, and can thus go fully\ngirded for a con\ufb02ict with the enemy.\nSelf-knowledge will save many from falling into grievous temptations,\nand prevent many an inglorious defeat. In order to become acquainted\nwith ourselves, it is essential that we faithfully investigate the motives and\nprinciples of our conduct, comparing our actions with the standard of duty\nrevealed in God\u2019s word.\nSelf-Improvement\nMinisters of age and experience should feel it their duty, as God\u2019s hired\nservants, to go forward, progressing every day, continually becoming more\nef\ufb01cient in their work, and constantly gathering fresh matter to set before the\npeople. Each effort to expound the gospel should be an improvement upon\nthat which preceded it. Each year they should develop a deeper piety, a more\ntender spirit, a greater spirituality, and a more thorough knowledge of Bible\ntruth. The greater their age and experience, the nearer should they be able\nto approach the hearts of the people, having a more perfect knowledge of\nthem.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:270. *****\n276\nGod has no use for lazy men in His cause; He wants thoughtful, kind,\naffectionate, earnest workers. Active exertion will do our preachers good.\nIndolence is proof of depravity. Every faculty of the mind, every bone in the\nbody, every muscle of the limbs, shows that God designed our faculties to be\nused, not to remain inactive.... Men who will unnecessarily take the hours of\ndaylight for sleep, have no sense of the value of precious, golden moments....\nPersons who have not acquired habits of close industry and economy of\ntime, should have set rules to prompt them to regularity and dispatch. George\nWashington was enabled to perform a great amount of business because he\nwas thorough in preserving order and regularity. Every paper had its date and\n277\nits place, and no time was lost in looking up what had been mislaid.\nMen of God must be diligent in study, earnest in the acquirement of\nknowledge, never wasting an hour. Through persevering exertion they may\nrise to almost any degree of eminence as Christians, as men of power and\nin\ufb02uence. But many will never attain superior rank in the pulpit or in\nbusiness, because of their un\ufb01xedness of purpose, and the laxness of the\nhabits contracted in their youth. Careless inattention is seen in everything\nthey undertake.\nA sudden impulse now and then is not suf\ufb01cient to accomplish a\nreformation in these ease-loving, indolent ones; this is a work which requires\npatient continuance in well-doing. Men of business can be truly successful\nonly by having regular hours for rising, for prayer, for meals, and for retiring.\nIf order and regularity are essential in worldly business, how much more so\nin the work of God!\nThe bright morning hours are wasted by many in bed. These precious\nhours, once lost, are gone never to return; they are lost for time and for\neternity. Only one hour lost each day, and what a waste of time in the course\nof a year! Let the slumberer think of this, and pause to consider how he will\ngive an account to God for lost opportunities.\nImproving Odd Moments\nMinisters should devote time to reading, to study, to meditation and\nprayer. They should store the mind with useful knowledge, committing to\nmemory portions of Scripture, tracing out the ful\ufb01lment of the prophecies,\nand learning the lessons which Christ gave\n278\nHis disciples. Take a book with you to read when traveling on the cars\nor waiting in the railway station. Employ every spare moment in doing\nsomething. In this way an effectual door will be closed against a thousand\ntemptations....\nMany have failed, signally failed, where they might have made a success.\nThey have not felt the burden of the work; they have taken things as leisurely\nas if they had a temporal millennium in which to work for the salvation of\nsouls.... The cause of God is not so much in need of preachers as of earnest,\npersevering workers for the Master. God alone can measure the powers of the\nhuman mind. It was not His design that man should be content to remain in\nthe lowlands of ignorance, but that he should secure all the advantages of an\nenlightened, cultivated intellect.\nEvery one should feel that there rests upon him an obligation to reach the\nheight of intellectual greatness. While none should be puffed up because\nof the knowledge they have acquired, it is the privilege of all to enjoy\nthe satisfaction of knowing that with every advance step they are rendered\nmore capable of honoring and glorifying God. They may draw from an\ninexhaustible fountain, the Source of all wisdom and knowledge.\nHaving entered the school of Christ, the student is prepared to engage in\nthe pursuit of knowledge without becoming dizzy from the height to which he\nis climbing. As he goes on from truth to truth, obtaining clearer and brighter\nviews of the wonderful laws of science and of nature, he becomes enraptured\nwith the amazing exhibitions of God\u2019s love to man. He sees with intelligent\neyes the perfection, knowledge,\n279\nand wisdom of God stretching beyond into in\ufb01nity. As his mind enlarges and\nexpands, pure streams of light pour into his soul. The more he drinks from\nthe fountain of knowledge, the purer and happier his contemplation of God\u2019s\nin\ufb01nity, and the greater his longing for wisdom suf\ufb01cient to comprehend the\ndeep things of God.\nNeed of Mental Culture\nMental culture is what we as a people need, and what we must have\nin order to meet the demands of the time. Poverty, humble origin, and\nunfavorable surroundings need not prevent the cultivation of the mind....\nDif\ufb01culties will be met in all studies; but never cease through\ndiscouragement. Search, study, and pray; face every dif\ufb01culty manfully and\nvigorously; call the power of will and the grace of patience to your aid,\nand then dig more earnestly till the gem of truth lies before you, plain and\nbeautiful, all the more precious because of the dif\ufb01culties involved in \ufb01nding\nit. Do not, then, continually dwell upon this one point, concentrating upon\nit all the energies of the mind, and constantly urging it upon the attention of\nothers: but take another subject, and carefully examine that. Thus mystery\nafter mystery will be unfolded to your comprehension.\nTwo valuable victories will be gained by this course. You will not only\nsecure useful knowledge, but the exercise of the mind will increase your\nmental power. The key found to unlock one mystery, may reveal also other\nprecious gems of knowledge heretofore undiscovered.\n280\nMany of our ministers can present to the people only a few doctrinal\ndiscourses. The same exertion and application which made them familiar\nwith these points would enable them to gain an understanding of others.\nThe prophecies and other doctrinal subjects should be thoroughly understood\nby all ministers. But some who have been preaching for years are content\nto con\ufb01ne themselves to a few subjects, being too indolent to search the\nScriptures diligently and prayerfully, that they may become giants in the\nunderstanding of Bible doctrines and the practical lessons of Christ.\nThe minds of all should be stored with a knowledge of the truths of God\u2019s\nword, that they may be prepared, at any moment when required, to present\nfrom the storehouse things new and old. Minds have been crippled and\ndwarfed for want of zeal and earnest, severe taxation. The time has come\nwhen God says, Go forward, and cultivate the abilities I have given you.\nThe world is teeming with errors and fables. Novelties in the form of\nsensational dramas are continually arising to engross the mind; and absurd\ntheories abound, which are destructive to moral and spiritual advancement.\nThe cause of God needs men of intellect, men of thought, men well versed\nin the Scriptures, to meet the in\ufb02owing tide of opposition. We should give\nno sanction to arrogance, narrow-mindedness, and inconsistencies, although\nthe garment of professed piety may be thrown over them. Those who have\nthe sanctifying power of the truth upon their hearts will exert a persuasive\nin\ufb02uence. Knowing that the advocates of error cannot create or destroy truth,\nthey can afford to be calm and considerate...\n281\nThere are many, even among our preachers, who want to rise in the world\nwithout effort. They are ambitious to do some great work of usefulness, while\nthey disregard the little, every-day duties which would render them helpful\nand make them ministers after Christ\u2019s order. They wish to do the work that\nothers are doing, but have no relish for the discipline necessary to \ufb01t them\nfor it. This yearning desire by both men and women to do something far in\nadvance of their present capabilities, is causing them to make decided failures\nat the outset. They indignantly refuse to climb the ladder, wishing to be\nelevated by a less laborious process.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:411-417.\n*****\nI am astonished that with the examples before us of what man may\nbe and what he may do, we are not stimulated to greater exertion to\nemulate the good works of the righteous. Not all may occupy positions of\nprominence; yet all may \ufb01ll positions of usefulness and trust, and may, by\ntheir persevering \ufb01delity, do far more good than they have any idea that they\ncan do.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:399. *****\nThe value of men and women is not to be estimated by the class of labor\nthey perform. It is \ufb01xed by Him who paid the price for every soul. In charity,\nin simplicity, in integrity, all who have Christ formed within, the hope of\nglory, are to be workers together with God. They are God\u2019s husbandry, God\u2019s\nbuilding.\nThe heart in which the love of Christ abides will constantly manifest more\nand more re\ufb01nement; for the spring of life is love to God and man. Christ is\n282\nChristianity. This is glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good\nwill toward men. This is the carrying out of God\u2019s purpose.\nTrue Christian growth tends upward to the full stature of men and women\nin Christ. True culture, real re\ufb01nement of thought and manners, is better\nobtained by learning lessons in the school of Christ, than by the most labored,\npainstaking effort to observe forms and set rules, when the heart is not under\nthe discipline of the Spirit of God.\nThe follower of Jesus should be constantly improving in manners, in\nhabits, in spirit, in labor. This is done by keeping the eye, not on mere\noutward, super\ufb01cial attainments, but on Jesus. A transformation takes place\nin mind, in spirit, in character. The Christian is educated in the school of\nChrist to cherish the graces of His Spirit in all meekness and lowliness. He is\n\ufb01tting for the society of heavenly angels. *****\nAbove all other people on the earth, the man whose mind is enlightened\nby the word of God will feel that he must give himself to greater diligence in\nthe perusal of the Bible, and to a diligent study of the sciences; for his hope\nand his calling are greater than any other. The more closely man is connected\nwith the Source of all knowledge and wisdom, the more he can be helped\nintellectually as well as spiritually. The knowledge of God is the essential\neducation, and this knowledge every true worker will make it his constant\nstudy to obtain.\u2014 \u201cCounsels to Teachers,\u201d page 510.\n283\nThe Holy Spirit\n\u201cWhen He, the Spirit of truth, is come,\u201d \u201cHe will reprove the world of sin,\nand of righteousness, and of judgment.\u201d [John 16:13, 8.]\nThe preaching of the word is of no avail without the presence and aid of\nthe Holy Spirit; for this Spirit is the only effectual teacher of divine truth.\nOnly when the truth is accompanied to the heart by the Spirit, will it quicken\nthe conscience or transform the life. A minister may be able to present the\nletter of the word of God; he may be familiar with all its commands and\npromises; but his sowing of the gospel seed will not be successful unless this\nseed is quickened into life by the dew of heaven. Without the co-operation of\nthe Spirit of God, no amount of education, no advantages, however great, can\nmake one a channel of light. Before one book of the New Testament had been\nwritten, before one gospel sermon had been preached after Christ\u2019s ascension,\nthe Holy Spirit came upon the praying disciples. Then the testimony of their\nenemies was, \u201cYe have \ufb01lled Jerusalem with your doctrine.\u201d [Acts 5:28.]\nGod\u2019s Promises Subject to Conditions\nChrist promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church and the promise\nbelongs as much to us as to the \ufb01rst disciples. But like every other promise, it\nis given on conditions. There are many who profess to believe and claim the\nLord\u2019s promises; they talk about Christ and the Holy Spirit; yet they receive\n284\nno bene\ufb01t, because they do not surrender their souls to the guidance and\ncontrol of divine agencies.\nWe cannot use the Holy Spirit; the Spirit is to use us. Through the\nSpirit, God works in His people \u201cto will and to do of His good pleasure.\u201d\n[Philippians 2:13.] But many will not submit to be led. They want to manage\nthemselves. This is why they do not receive the heavenly gift. Only to\nthose who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and grace,\nis the Spirit given. This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other\nblessings in its train. It is given according to the riches of the grace of Christ,\nand He is ready to supply every soul according to the capacity to receive.\nThe impartation of the Spirit is the impartation of the life of Christ. Those\nonly who are thus taught of God, those only who possess the inward working\nof the Spirit, and in whose life the Christ-life is manifested, can stand as true\nrepresentatives of the Saviour.\nThe Holy Spirit as an Educator\nGod takes men as they are, and educates them for His service, if they\nwill yield themselves to Him. The Spirit of God, received into the soul,\nquickens all its faculties. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the mind that\nis devoted unreservedly to God, develops harmoniously, and is strengthened\nto comprehend and ful\ufb01l the requirements of God. The weak, vacillating\ncharacter becomes changed to one of strength and steadfastness. Continual\ndevotion establishes so close a relation between Jesus and His disciples that\nthe Christian becomes like his Master in character. He\n285\nhas clearer, broader views. His discernment is more penetrative, his judgment\nbetter balanced. So quickened is he by the life-giving power of the Sun of\nRighteousness, that he is enabled to bear much fruit to the glory of God.\nChrist promised that the Holy Spirit should abide with those who wrestle\nfor victory over sin, to demonstrate the power of divine might by endowing\nthe human agent with supernatural strength and instructing the ignorant in\nthe mysteries of the kingdom of God. Of what avail would it be to us that the\nonly begotten Son of God humbled Himself, endured the temptations of the\nwily foe, and died, the just for the unjust, if the Spirit had not been given as\na constant, working, regenerating agent, to make effectual in each individual\ncase what has been wrought out by the world\u2019s Redeemer?\nThe Holy Spirit enabled the disciples to exalt the Lord alone, and guided\nthe pens of the sacred historians, that the record of the words and works of\nChrist might be given to the world. Today this Spirit is constantly at work,\nseeking to draw the attention of men to the great sacri\ufb01ce made upon the cross\nof Calvary, to unfold to the world the love of God to man, and to open to the\nconvicted soul the promises of the Scriptures.\nIt is the Spirit that causes to shine into darkened minds the bright beams\nof the Sun of Righteousness; that makes men\u2019s hearts burn within them with\nan awakened realization of the truths of eternity; that presents before the mind\nthe great standard of righteousness, and convinces of sin; that inspires faith\nin Him who alone can save from sin; that works to\n286\ntransform character by withdrawing the affections of men from those things\nwhich are temporal and perishable, and \ufb01xing them upon the eternal\ninheritance. The Spirit recreates, re\ufb01nes, and sancti\ufb01es human beings, \ufb01tting\nthem to become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King.\nEffect of Receiving the Spirit\nWhen one is fully emptied of self, when every false god is cast out of the\nsoul, the vacuum is \ufb01lled by the in\ufb02owing of the Spirit of Christ. Such a one\nhas the faith that puri\ufb01es the soul from de\ufb01lement. He is conformed to the\nSpirit, and he minds the things of the Spirit. He has no con\ufb01dence in self.\nChrist is all and in all. He receives with meekness the truth that is constantly\nbeing unfolded, and gives the Lord all the glory, saying, \u201cGod hath revealed\nthem unto us by His Spirit.\u201d \u201cNow we have received, not the spirit of the\nworld, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are\nfreely given to us of God.\u201d [1 Corinthians 2:10, 12.]\nThe Spirit that reveals, also works in him the fruits of righteousness.\nChrist is in him, \u201ca well of water springing up into everlasting life.\u201d [John\n4:14.] He is a branch of the True Vine, and bears rich clusters of fruit to\nthe glory of God. What is the character of the fruit borne?\u2014The fruit of the\nSpirit is \u201clove,\u201d not hatred; \u201cjoy,\u201d not discontent and mourning; \u201cpeace,\u201d not\nirritation, anxiety, and manufactured trials. It is \u201clong-suffering, gentleness,\ngoodness, faith, meekness, temperance.\u201d [Galatians 5:22, 23.]\n287\nThose who have this Spirit are earnest workers together with God; the\nheavenly intelligences co-operate with them, and they go weighted with the\nspirit of the message that they bear. They speak words of solid sense, and from\nthe treasury of the heart bring forth pure, sacred things, after the example of\nChrist.\nThe message that we have to bear is not one that we need cringe to declare.\nIts advocates are not to seek to cover it, to conceal its origin and purpose. As\nthose who have made solemn vows to God, and who have been commissioned\nas the messengers of Christ, as stewards of the mysteries of grace, we are\nunder obligation to declare faithfully the whole counsel of God.\nWe are not to make less prominent the special truths that have separated\nus from the world, and made us what we are; for they are fraught with eternal\ninterests. God has given us light in regard to the things that are now taking\nplace, and with pen and voice we are to proclaim the truth to the world. But\nit is the life of Christ in the soul, it is the active principle of love imparted by\nthe Holy Spirit, that alone will make our words fruitful. The love of Christ is\nthe force and power of every message for God that ever fell from human lips.\nNearing the End\nDay after day is passing into eternity, bringing us nearer to the close of\nprobation. As never before we must pray for the Holy Spirit to be more\nabundantly bestowed upon us, and we must look for its sanctifying in\ufb02uence\nto come upon the workers, that those for\n288\nwhom they labor may know that they have been with Jesus and have learned\nof Him.\nWe need spiritual eyesight, that we may see the designs of the enemy,\nand as faithful watchmen proclaim the danger. We need power from above,\nthat we may understand, as far as the human mind can, the great themes of\nChristianity and their far-reaching principles.\nThose who are under the in\ufb02uence of the Spirit of God will not be\nfanatical, but calm and steadfast, free from extravagance in thought, word,\nor deed. Amid the confusion of delusive doctrines, the Spirit of God will be\na guide and a shield to those who have not resisted the evidences of truth,\nsilencing every other voice but that which comes from Him who is the truth.\nWe are living in the last days, when error of a most deceptive character\nis accepted and believed, while truth is discarded. The Lord will hold both\nministers and people responsible for the light shining upon them. He calls\nupon us to work diligently in gathering up the jewels of truth, and placing\nthem in the framework of the gospel. In all their divine beauty they are to\nshine forth in the moral darkness of the world. This cannot be accomplished\nwithout the aid of the Holy Spirit, but with this aid we can do all things.\nWhen we are endowed with the Spirit, we take hold by faith of in\ufb01nite power.\nThere is nothing lost of that which comes from God. The Saviour of the world\nsends His messages to the soul, that the darkness of error may be dispelled.\nThe work of the Spirit is immeasurably great. It is from this source that power\nand ef\ufb01ciency come to the worker for God.\n289\nDevelopment and Service\nChristian life is more than many take it to be. It does not consist wholly\nin gentleness, patience, meekness, and kindliness. These graces are essential;\nbut there is need also of courage, force, energy, and perseverance. The path\nthat Christ marks out is a narrow, self-denying path. To enter that path and\npress on through dif\ufb01culties and discouragements, requires men who are more\nthan weaklings.\nMen of stamina are wanted, men who will not wait to have their way\nsmoothed and every obstacle removed; men who will inspire with fresh zeal\nthe \ufb02agging efforts of dispirited workers; men whose hearts are warm with\nChristian love, and whose hands are strong to do their Master\u2019s work.\nSome who engage in missionary service are weak, nerveless, spiritless,\neasily discouraged. They lack push. They have not those positive traits of\ncharacter that give power to do something,\u2014the spirit and energy that kindle\nenthusiasm. Those who would win success must be courageous and hopeful.\nThey should cultivate not only the passive but the active virtues. While they\nare to give the soft answer that turns away wrath, they must possess the\ncourage of a hero to resist evil. With the charity that endures all things, they\nneed the force of character that will make their in\ufb02uence a positive power.\nSome have no \ufb01rmness of character. Their plans and purposes have no\nde\ufb01nite form and consistency. They are of but little practical use in the world.\nThis weakness, indecision, and inef\ufb01ciency should be overcome.\n290\nThere is in true Christian character an indomitableness that cannot be\nmoulded or subdued by adverse circumstances. We must have moral\nbackbone, an integrity that cannot be \ufb02attered, bribed, or terri\ufb01ed.\nGod desires us to make use of every opportunity for securing a preparation\nfor His work. He expects us to put all our energies into its performance, and\nto keep our hearts alive to its sacredness and its fearful responsibilities.\nMany who are quali\ufb01ed to do excellent work accomplish little because\nthey attempt little. Thousands pass through life as if they had no great object\nfor which to live, no high standard to reach. One reason for this is the low\nestimate which they place upon themselves. Christ paid an in\ufb01nite price for\nus, and according to the price paid He desires us to value ourselves.\nBe not satis\ufb01ed with reaching a low standard. We are not what we might\nbe, or what it is God\u2019s will that we should be. God has given us reasoning\npowers, not to remain inactive, or to be perverted to earthly and sordid\npursuits, but that they may be developed to the utmost, re\ufb01ned, sancti\ufb01ed,\nennobled, and used in advancing the interests of His kingdom....\nRemember that in whatever position you may serve, you are revealing\nmotive, developing character. Whatever your work, do it with exactness, with\ndiligence; overcome the inclination to seek an easy task.\nThe same spirit and principles that one brings into the daily labor will be\nbrought into the whole life. Those who desire a \ufb01xed amount to do and a\n291\n\ufb01xed salary, and who wish to prove an exact \ufb01t without the trouble of\nadaptation or training, are not the ones whom God calls to work in His cause.\nThose who study how to give as little as possible of their physical, mental,\nand moral power, are not the workers upon whom He can pour out abundant\nblessings. Their example is contagious. Self-interest is the ruling motive.\nThose who need to be watched and who work only as every duty is speci\ufb01ed\nto them, are not the ones who will be pronounced good and faithful. Workers\nare needed who manifest energy, integrity, diligence; those who are willing\nto do anything that needs to be done.\nMany become inef\ufb01cient by evading responsibilities for fear of failure.\nThus they fail of gaining that education which results from experience, and\nwhich reading and study and all the advantages otherwise gained, cannot give\nthem.\nMan can shape circumstances, but circumstances should not be allowed\nto shape the man. We should seize upon circumstances as instruments with\nwhich to work. We are to master them, but should not permit them to master\nus.\nMen of power are often those who have been opposed, baf\ufb02ed, and\nthwarted. By calling their energies into action, the obstacles they meet prove\nto them positive blessings. They gain self-reliance. Con\ufb02ict and perplexity\ncall for the exercise of trust in God, and for that \ufb01rmness which develops\npower.\nChrist gave no stinted service. He did not measure His work by hours.\nHis time, His heart, His soul and strength, were given to labor for the bene\ufb01t\nof humanity. Through weary days He toiled, and\n292\nthrough long nights He bent in prayer for grace and endurance that He might\ndo a larger work. With strong crying and tears He sent His petitions to heaven,\nthat His human nature might be strengthened, that He might be braced to meet\nthe wily foe in all his deceptive workings, and forti\ufb01ed to ful\ufb01l His mission of\nuplifting humanity. To His workers He says, \u201cI have given you an example,\nthat ye should do as I have done.\u201d [John 13:15.]\n\u201cThe love of Christ,\u201d said Paul, \u201cconstraineth us.\u201d [2 Corinthians 5:14.]\nThis was the actuating principle of his conduct; it was his motive-power. If\never his ardor in the path of duty \ufb02agged for a moment, one glance at the\ncross caused him to gird up anew the loins of his mind, and press forward\nin the way of self-denial. In his labors for his brethren he relied much upon\nthe manifestation of in\ufb01nite love in the sacri\ufb01ce of Christ, with its subduing,\nconstraining power.\nHow earnest, how touching his appeal: \u201cYe know the grace of our Lord\nJesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor,\nthat ye through His poverty might be rich.\u201d [2 Corinthians 8:9.] You know\nthe height from which He stooped, the depth of humiliation to which He\ndescended. His feet entered upon the path of sacri\ufb01ce, and turned not aside\nuntil He had given His life. There was no rest for Him between the throne in\nheaven and the cross. His love for man led Him to welcome every indignity,\nand suffer every abuse.\nPaul admonishes us to \u201clook not every man on his own things, but every\nman also on the things of others.\u201d He bids us possess the mind \u201cwhich was\n293\nalso in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to\nbe equal with God: but made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him\nthe form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found\nin fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death,\neven the death of the cross.\u201d [Philippians 2:4-8.] ...\nEvery one who accepts Christ as his personal Saviour will long for the\nprivilege of serving God. Contemplating what Heaven has done for him, his\nheart is moved with boundless love and adoring gratitude. He is eager to\nsignalize his gratitude by devoting his abilities to God\u2019s service. He longs\nto show his love for Christ and for his purchased possession. He covets toil,\nhardship, sacri\ufb01ce.\nThe true worker for God will do his best, because in so doing he can\nglorify his Master. He will do right in order to regard the requirements of\nGod. He will endeavor to improve all his faculties. He will perform every\nduty as unto God. His one desire will be that Christ may receive homage and\nperfect service.\nThere is a picture representing a bullock standing between a plow and an\naltar, with the inscription \u201cReady for either\u201d\u2014ready to toil in the furrow,\nor to be offered on the altar of sacri\ufb01ce. This is the position of the true\nchild of God\u2014willing to go where duty calls, to deny self, to sacri\ufb01ce for\nthe Redeemer\u2019s cause.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 497-502.\n294\n295\n296\nSection VIII. Dangers\nThe Danger of Rejecting Light\nGod intends that, even in this life, truth shall be ever unfolding to His\npeople. There is only one way in which this knowledge can be obtained. We\ncan attain to an understanding of God\u2019s word only through the illumination\nof that Spirit by which the Word was given. \u201cThe things of God knoweth no\nman, but the Spirit of God;\u201d \u201cfor the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep\nthings of God.\u201d [1 Corinthians 2:11, 10.] And the Saviour\u2019s promise to His\nfollowers was, \u201cWhen He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into\nall truth.... For He shall receive of Mine, and shall show it unto you.\u201d [John\n16:13, 14.]...\nPeter exhorts his brethren to \u201cgrow in grace, and in the knowledge of\nour Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\u201d [2 Peter 3:18.] Whenever the people\nof God are growing in grace, they will be constantly obtaining a clearer\nunderstanding of His word. They will discern new light and beauty in its\nsacred truths. This has been true in the history of the church in all ages, and\nthus it will continue to the end. But as real spiritual life declines, it has ever\nbeen the tendency to cease to advance in the knowledge of the truth. Men rest\n297\nsatis\ufb01ed with the light already received from God\u2019s word, and discourage any\nfurther investigation of the Scriptures. They become conservative, and seek\nto avoid discussion.\nThe fact that there is no controversy or agitation among God\u2019s people,\nshould not be regarded as conclusive evidence that they are holding fast\nto sound doctrine. There is reason to fear that they may not be clearly\ndiscriminating between truth and error. When no new questions are started\nby investigation of the Scriptures, when no difference of opinion arises which\nwill set men to searching the Bible for themselves, to make sure that they\nhave the truth, there will be many now, as in ancient times, who will hold to\ntradition, and worship they know not what.\nI have been shown that many who profess to have a knowledge of present\ntruth, know not what they believe. They do not understand the evidences of\ntheir faith. They have no just appreciation of the work for the present time.\nWhen the time of trial shall come, there are men now preaching to others,\nwho will \ufb01nd, upon examining the positions they hold, that there are many\nthings for which they can give no satisfactory reason. Until thus tested, they\nknew not their great ignorance.\nAnd there are many in the church who take it for granted that they\nunderstand what they believe, but, until controversy arises, they do not know\ntheir own weakness. When separated from those of like faith, and compelled\nto stand singly and alone to explain their belief, they will be surprised to see\nhow confused are their ideas of what they had accepted as truth. Certain it is\nthat there has been among us a departure\n298\nfrom the living God, and a turning to men, putting human wisdom in place of\ndivine.\nGod will arouse His people; if other means fail, heresies will come in\namong them, which will sift them, separating the chaff from the wheat. The\nLord calls upon all who believe His word to awake out of sleep. Precious\nlight has come, appropriate for this time. It is Bible truth, showing the perils\nthat are right upon us. This light should lead us to a diligent study of the\nScriptures, and a most critical examination of the positions which we hold.\nGod would have all the bearings and positions of truth thoroughly and\nperseveringly searched, with prayer and fasting. Believers are not to rest in\nsuppositions and ill-de\ufb01ned ideas of what constitutes truth. Their faith must\nbe \ufb01rmly founded upon the word of God, so that when the testing time shall\ncome, and they are brought before councils to answer for their faith, they may\nbe able to give a reason for the hope that is in them, with meekness and fear.\nAgitate, agitate, agitate! The subjects which we present to the world must\nbe to us a living reality. It is important that in defending the doctrines which\nwe consider fundamental articles of faith, we should never allow ourselves to\nemploy arguments that are not wholly sound. These may avail to silence an\nopposer, but they do not honor the truth. We should present sound arguments,\nthat will not only silence our opponents, but will bear the closest and most\nsearching scrutiny.\nWith those who have educated themselves as debaters, there is great\ndanger that they will not handle the word of God with fairness. In meeting\n299\nan opponent, it should be our earnest effort to present subjects in such a\nmanner as to awaken conviction in his mind, instead of seeking merely to\ngive con\ufb01dence to the believer.\nWhatever may be man\u2019s intellectual advancement, let him not for a\nmoment think that there is no need of thorough and continuous searching\nof the Scriptures for greater light. As a people, we are called individually\nto be students of prophecy. We must watch with earnestness that we may\ndiscern any ray of light which God shall present to us. We are to catch the\n\ufb01rst gleamings of truth; and through prayerful study, clearer light may be\nobtained, which can be brought before others.\nWhen God\u2019s people are at ease, and satis\ufb01ed with their present\nenlightenment, we may be sure that He will not favor them. It is His\nwill that they should be ever moving forward, to receive the increased and\never-increasing light which is shining for them.\nThe present attitude of the church is not pleasing to God. There has come\nin a self-con\ufb01dence that has led them to feel no necessity for more truth and\ngreater light. We are living at a time when Satan is at work on the right hand\nand on the left, before and behind us; and yet as a people we are asleep. God\nwills that a voice shall be heard arousing His people to action.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church5:703-709. *****\nThe Test of New Light\nOur brethren should be willing to investigate in a candid way every point\nof controversy. If a brother is teaching error, those who are in responsible\npositions\n300\nought to know it; and if he is teaching truth, they ought to take their stand at\nhis side. We should all know what is being taught among us; for if it is truth,\nwe need it. We are all under obligation to God to know what He sends us. He\nhas given directions by which we may test every doctrine,\u2014\u201cTo the law and\nto the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there\nis no light in them.\u201d [Isaiah 8:20.] If the light presented meets this test, we\nare not to refuse to accept it because it does not agree with our ideas.\nNo one has said that we shall \ufb01nd perfection in any man\u2019s investigations;\nbut this I do know, that our churches are dying for the want of teaching on the\nsubject of righteousness by faith in Christ, and on kindred truths.\nNo matter by whom light is sent, we should open our hearts to receive it\nwith the meekness of Christ. But many do not do this. When a controverted\npoint is presented, they pour in question after question, without admitting a\npoint when it is well sustained. O, may we act as men who want light! May\nGod give us His Holy Spirit day by day, and let the light of His countenance\nshine upon us, that we may be learners in the school of Christ. *****\nWhen a doctrine is presented that does not meet our minds, we should go\nto the word of God, seek the Lord in prayer, and give no place for the enemy\nto come in with suspicion and prejudice. We should never permit the spirit\nto be manifested that arraigned the priests and rulers against the Redeemer of\nthe world. They complained that He disturbed the people,\n301\nand they wished He would let them alone; for He caused perplexity and\ndissension. The Lord sends light to us to prove what manner of spirit we\nare of. We are not to deceive ourselves.\nIn 1844, when anything came to our attention that we did not understand,\nwe kneeled down and asked God to help us take the right position; and then\nwe were able to come to a right understanding and see eye to eye. There was\nno dissension, no enmity, no evil-surmising, no misjudging of our brethren.\nIf we but knew the evil of the spirit of intolerance, how carefully would we\nshun it! *****\nWe are to be established in the faith, in the light of the truth given us in\nour early experience. At that time one error after another pressed in upon\nus; ministers and doctors brought in new doctrines. We would search the\nScriptures with much prayer, and the Holy Spirit would bring the truth to our\nminds. Sometimes whole nights would be devoted to searching the Scriptures,\nand earnestly asking God for guidance. Companies of devoted men and\nwomen assembled for this purpose. The power of God would come upon\nme, and I was enabled clearly to de\ufb01ne what is truth and what is error.\nAs the points of our faith were thus established, our feet were placed\nupon a solid foundation. We accepted the truth point by point, under the\ndemonstration of the Holy Spirit. I would be taken off in vision, and\nexplanations would be given me. I was given illustrations of heavenly things,\nand of the sanctuary, so that we were placed where light was shining on us in\nclear, distinct rays.\n302\nI know that the sanctuary question stands in righteousness and truth, just\nas we have held it for so many years. It is the enemy that leads minds\noff on side-tracks. He is pleased when those who know the truth become\nengrossed in collecting scriptures to pile around erroneous theories, which\nhave no foundation in truth. The scriptures thus used are misapplied; they\nwere not given to substantiate error, but to strengthen truth. *****\nWe must learn that others have rights as well as we ourselves. When a\nbrother receives new light upon the Scriptures, he should frankly explain his\nposition, and every minister should search the Scriptures with the spirit of\ncandor, to see if the points presented can be substantiated by the Inspired\nWord. \u201cThe servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men,\napt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves;\nif God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the\ntruth.\u201d [2 Timothy 2:24, 25.]\nEvery soul must look to God with contrition and humility, that He may\nguide and lead and bless. We must not trust to others to search the Scriptures\nfor us. Some of our leading brethren have frequently taken their position\non the wrong side; and if God would send a message and wait for these older\nbrethren to open the way for its advancement, it would never reach the people.\nThese brethren will be found in this position until they become partakers of\nthe divine nature to a greater extent than ever they have been in the past.\n303\nThere is sadness in heaven over the spiritual blindness of many of our\nbrethren. Our younger ministers, who \ufb01ll less important positions, must make\ndecided efforts to come to the light, to sink the shaft deeper and still deeper\nin the mine of truth.\nThe rebuke of the Lord will rest upon those who would bar the way, that\nclearer light shall not come to the people. A great work is to be done, and\nGod sees that our leading men have need of more light, that they may unite\nwith the messengers whom He sends to accomplish the work that He designs\nshall be done. The Lord has raised up messengers, and endued them with His\nSpirit, and has said, \u201cCry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet,\nand show My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\u201d\n[Isaiah 58:1.] Let no one run the risk of interposing between the people and\nthe message of Heaven. This message will go to the people; and if there were\nno voice among men to give it, the very stones would cry out.\nI call upon every minister to seek the Lord, to put away pride and strife\nfor supremacy, and to humble the heart before God. It is the coldness of\nheart, the unbelief of those who ought to have faith, that keeps the churches\nin feebleness.\n304\nA Warning Against False Teaching\nAt this time we need in the cause of God spiritual-minded men, men\nwho are \ufb01rm in principle, and who have a clear understanding of the truth.\nI have been instructed that it is not new and fanciful doctrines nor human\nsuppositions which the people need, but the testimony of men who know and\npractice the truth, men who understand and obey the charge given to Timothy:\n\u201cPreach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort\nwith all long-suffering and doctrine.\u201d [2 Timothy 4:2.]\nMy brethren, walk \ufb01rmly, decidedly, your feet shod with the preparation\nof the gospel of peace. You may be sure that pure and unde\ufb01led religion\nis not a sensational religion. God has not laid upon any one the burden of\nencouraging an appetite for speculative doctrines and theories. Keep these\nthings out of your teaching. Do not allow them to enter into your experience.\nLet not your life-work be marred by them.\nA warning against false teaching is found in Paul\u2019s letter to the Colossians.\nThe apostle declares that the hearts of the believers are to be \u201cknit together\nin love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the\nacknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;\nin whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.\n\u201cAnd this I say,\u201d he continues, \u201clest any man should beguile you with\nenticing words.... As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so\nwalk\n305\nye in Him: rooted and built up in Him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have\nbeen taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware lest any man spoil\nyou through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the\nrudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in Him dwelleth all the\nfulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in Him, which is the\nhead of all principality and power.\u201d [Colossians 2:2-10.]\nI am instructed to say to our people, Let us follow Christ. Do not forget\nthat He is to be our pattern in all things. We may safely discard those ideas\nthat are not found in His teaching. I appeal to our ministers to be sure that\ntheir feet are planted on the platform of eternal truth. Beware how you follow\nimpulse, calling it the Holy Spirit. Some are in danger of doing this. The\nword of God urges us to be sound in the faith, able to give to every one who\nasks, a reason of the hope that is in us.\nDiverting Minds From Present Duty\nThe enemy is seeking to divert the minds of our brethren and sisters from\nthe work of preparing a people to stand in these last days. His sophistries\nare designed to lead minds away from the perils and duties of the hour. They\nestimate as of little value the light that Christ came from heaven to give to\nJohn for His people. They teach that the scenes just before us are not of\nsuf\ufb01cient importance to receive special attention. They make of no effect the\ntruth of heavenly origin, and rob the people of God of their past experience,\ngiving them instead a false science. \u201cThus saith the Lord: Stand ye in the\nways, and\n306\nsee, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein.\u201d\n[Jeremiah 6:16.]\nLet none seek to tear away the foundations of our faith,\u2014the foundations\nthat were laid at the beginning of our work, by prayerful study of the Word\nand by revelation. Upon these foundations we have been building for more\nthan \ufb01fty years. Men may suppose that they have found a new way, that they\ncan lay a stronger foundation than that which has been laid; but this is a great\ndeception. \u201cOther foundation can no man lay than that is laid.\u201d [1 Corinthians\n3:11.] In the past, many have undertaken to build a new faith, to establish new\nprinciples; but how long did their building stand? It soon fell; for it was not\nfounded upon the Rock.\nDid not the \ufb01rst disciples have to meet the sayings of men? did they not\nhave to listen to false theories; and then, having done all, to stand \ufb01rm, saying,\n\u201cOther foundation can no man lay than that is laid\u201d? So we are to hold the\nbeginning of our con\ufb01dence steadfast unto the end.\nWords of power have been sent by God and by Christ to this people,\nbringing them out from the world, point by point, into the clear light of\npresent truth. With lips touched by holy \ufb01re, God\u2019s servants have proclaimed\nthe message. The divine utterance has set its seal to the genuineness of the\ntruth proclaimed.\nA Renewal of the Straight Testimony\nThe Lord calls for a renewal of the straight testimony borne in years past.\nHe calls for a renewal of spiritual life. The spiritual energies of His people\n307\nhave long been torpid, but there is to be a resurrection from apparent death.\nBy prayer and confession of sin we must clear the King\u2019s highway. As we\ndo this, the power of the Spirit will come to us. We need the pentecostal\nenergy. This will come; for the Lord has promised to send His Spirit as the\nall-conquering power.\nPerilous times are before us. Every one who has a knowledge of the truth\nshould awake, and place himself, body, soul, and spirit, under the discipline\nof God. The enemy is on our track. We must be wide awake, on our guard\nagainst him. We must put on the whole armor of God. We must follow the\ndirections given through the Spirit of prophecy. We must love and obey the\ntruth for this time. This will save us from accepting strong delusions. God has\nspoken to us through His word. He has spoken to us through the testimonies to\nthe church, and through the books that have helped to make plain our present\nduty and the position we should now occupy. The warnings that have been\ngiven, line upon line, precept upon precept, should be heeded. If we disregard\nthem, what excuse can we offer?\nI beseech those who are laboring for God not to accept the spurious for the\ngenuine. Let not human reasoning be placed where sanctifying truth should\nbe. Christ is waiting to kindle faith and love in the hearts of His people. Let\nnot erroneous theories receive countenance from the people who ought to be\nstanding \ufb01rm on the platform of eternal truth. God calls upon us to hold \ufb01rmly\nto the fundamental principles that are based upon unquestionable authority.\n308\nThe Word of God Our Safeguard\nOur watchword is to be, \u201cTo the law and to the testimony: if they speak\nnot according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\u201d [Isaiah\n8:20.] We have a Bible full of the most precious truth. It contains the\nalpha and the omega of knowledge. The Scriptures, given by inspiration of\nGod, are \u201cpro\ufb01table for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in\nrighteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto\nall good works.\u201d [2 Timothy 3:16, 17.] Take the Bible as your study-book.\nAll can understand its instruction.\nChrist calls upon His people to believe and practice His word. Those who\nreceive and assimilate this word, making it a part of every action, of every\nattribute of character, will grow strong in the strength of God. It will be seen\nthat their faith is of heavenly origin. They will not wander into strange paths.\nTheir minds will not turn to a religion of sentimentalism and excitement.\nBefore angels and before men, they will stand as those who have strong,\nconsistent Christian characters.\nIn the golden censer of truth, as presented in Christ\u2019s teachings, we have\nthat which will convict and convert souls. Proclaim, in the simplicity of\nChrist, the truths that He came to this world to proclaim, and the power of\nyour message will make itself felt. Do not advocate theories or tests that\nChrist has never mentioned, and that have no foundation in the Bible. We\nhave grand, solemn truths for the people. \u201cIt is written\u201d is the test that must\nbe brought home to every soul.\n309\nLet us go to the word of God for guidance. Let us seek for a \u201cThus saith\nthe Lord.\u201d We have had enough of human methods. A mind trained only\nin worldly science will fail to understand the things of God; but the same\nmind, converted and sancti\ufb01ed, will see the divine power in the Word. Only\nthe mind and heart cleansed by the sancti\ufb01cation of the Spirit can discern\nheavenly things.\nBrethren, in the name of the Lord I call upon you to awake to your duty.\nLet your hearts be yielded to the power of the Holy Spirit, and they will be\nmade susceptible to the teachings of the Word. Then you will be able to\ndiscern the deep things of God.\nMay God bring His people under the deep movings of His Spirit! May\nHe arouse them to see their peril, and to prepare for what is coming upon the\nearth! *****\nWe must not for a moment think that there is no more light, no more truth,\nto be given us. We are in danger of becoming careless, by our indifference\nlosing the sanctifying power of truth, and composing ourselves with the\nthought, \u201cI am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing.\u201d\n[Revelation 3:17.] While we must hold fast to the truths which we have\nalready received, we must not look with suspicion upon any new light that\nGod may send.\n310\nSound Doctrine\n\u201cThe time will come,\u201d Paul wrote to Timothy, \u201cwhen they will not\nendure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves\nteachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the\ntruth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure\naf\ufb02ictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.\u201d [2\nTimothy 4:3-5.]\n\u201cSound doctrine\u201d is Bible truth\u2014truth that will promote piety and\ndevotion, con\ufb01rming God\u2019s people in the faith. Sound doctrine means much\nto the receiver; and it means much, too, to the teacher, the minister of\nrighteousness; for wherever the gospel is preached, every laborer, whatever\nhis line of service, is either true or untrue to his responsibility as the Lord\u2019s\nmessenger.\nPaul wrote again, \u201cIt is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with Him, we\nshall also live with Him: if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him: if we\ndeny Him, He also will deny us: if we believe not, yet He abideth faithful:\nHe cannot deny Himself. Of these things put them in remembrance, charging\nthem before the Lord that they strive not about words to no pro\ufb01t, but to the\nsubverting of the hearers.\u201d [2 Timothy 2:11-14.]\nSome who in Paul\u2019s day listened to the truth, raised questions of no vital\nimportance, presenting the ideas and opinions of men, and seeking to divert\nthe mind of the teacher from the great truths of the gospel, to the discussion\nof non-essential theories and\n311\nthe settlement of unimportant disputes. Paul knew that the laborer for God\nmust be wise enough to see the design of the enemy, and refuse to be misled\nor diverted. The conversion of souls must be the burden of his work; he must\npreach the word of God, but avoid controversy.\n\u201cStudy to show thyself approved unto God,\u201d he wrote, \u201ca workman that\nneedeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth. But shun\nprofane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.\u201d [2\nTimothy 2:15, 16.]\nThe ministers of Christ today are in the same danger. Satan is constantly\nat work to divert the mind into wrong channels, so that the truth may lose\nits force upon the heart. And unless ministers and people practice the truth\nand are sancti\ufb01ed by it, they will allow speculation regarding questions of no\nvital importance to occupy the mind. This will lead to caviling and strife; for\ncountless points of difference will arise.\nMen of ability have devoted a lifetime of study and prayer to the searching\nof the Scriptures, and yet there are many portions of the Bible that have\nnot been fully explored. Some passages of Scripture will never be perfectly\ncomprehended until in the future life Christ shall explain them. There are\nmysteries to be unraveled, statements that human minds cannot harmonize.\nAnd the enemy will seek to arouse argument upon these points, which might\nbetter remain undiscussed.\nA devoted, spiritual worker will avoid bringing up minor theoretical\ndifferences, and will devote his energies to the proclamation of the great\ntesting truths\n312\nto be given to the world. He will point the people to the work of redemption,\nthe commandments of God, the near coming of Christ; and it will be found\nthat in these subjects there is food enough for thought.\nIn time past there have been presented to me for my opinion many\nnon-essential, fanciful theories. Some have advocated the theory that\nbelievers should pray with their eyes open. Others teach that, because those\nwho ministered anciently in sacred of\ufb01ce were required, upon entering the\nsanctuary, to remove their sandals and wash their feet, believers now should\nremove their shoes when entering the house of worship. Still others refer to\nthe sixth commandment, and declare that even the insects that torment human\nbeings should not be killed. And some have put forth the theory that the\nredeemed will not have gray hair\u2014as if this were a matter of any importance.\nI am instructed to say that these theories are the production of minds\nunlearned in the \ufb01rst principles of the gospel. By such theories the enemy\nstrives to eclipse the great truths for this time.\nThose who in their preaching pass by the great truths of God\u2019s word to\nspeak of minor matters, are not preaching the gospel, but are dealing in idle\nsophistry. Let not our ministers spend time in the discussion of such matters.\nLet those who have any question as to what they should teach, any question as\nto the subjects upon which they should dwell, go to the discourses of the great\nTeacher, and follow His lines of thought. The subjects that Jesus regarded as\nessential are the subjects that we are to urge home today. We are to encourage\nour hearers to dwell upon those subjects which are of eternal moment.\n313\nWhen at one time a brother came to me with the message that the world is\n\ufb02at, I was instructed to present the commission that Christ gave His disciples,\n\u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations: ...and, lo, I am with you alway,\neven unto the end.\u201d [Matthew 28:19, 20.] In regard to such subjects as the\n\ufb02at-world theory, God says to every soul, \u201cWhat is that to thee? follow thou\nMe. I have given you your commission. Dwell upon the great testing truths\nfor this time, not upon matters that have no bearing upon our work.\u201d\nWorkers for God should not spend time speculating as to what conditions\nwill prevail in the new earth. It is presumption to indulge in suppositions and\ntheories regarding matters that the Lord has not revealed. He has made every\nprovision for our happiness in the future life, and we are not to speculate\nregarding His plans for us. Neither are we to measure the conditions of the\nfuture life by the conditions of this life.\nTo my ministering brethren I would say, Preach the word. Do not\nbring to the foundation wood, hay, and stubble,\u2014your own surmisings and\nspeculations, which can bene\ufb01t no one. Subjects of vital importance are\nrevealed in the word of God, and these are worthy of our deepest thought.\nBut we are not to search into matters on which God has been silent.\nWhen questions arise upon which we are uncertain, let us ask, What saith\nthe Scripture? And if the Scripture is silent upon the question at issue, let\nit not be made the subject of discussion. Let those who wish for something\nnew, seek for that newness of life resulting from the new birth. Let them\n314\npurify their souls by obeying the truth, and act in harmony with the instruction\nthat Christ has given.\nThe only question asked in the judgment will be, \u201cHave they been\nobedient to My commandments?\u201d Petty strife and contention over questions\nof no importance has no part in God\u2019s great plan. Those who teach the truth\nshould be men of solid minds, who will not lead their hearers into a \ufb01eld of\nthistles, as it were, and leave them there.\nThe sacri\ufb01ce of Christ as an atonement for sin is the great truth around\nwhich all other truths cluster. In order to be rightly understood and\nappreciated, every truth in the word of God, from Genesis to Revelation,\nmust be studied in the light that streams from the cross of Calvary. I present\nbefore you the great, grand monument of mercy and regeneration, salvation\nand redemption,\u2014the Son of God uplifted on the cross. This is to be the\nfoundation of every discourse given by our ministers. *****\nMen are needed for this time who can understand the wants of the people,\nand minister to their necessities. The faithful minister of Christ watches at\nevery outpost, to warn, to reprove, to counsel, to entreat, and to encourage\nhis fellow-men, laboring with the Spirit of God, which worketh in him\nmightily, that he may present every man perfect in Christ. Such a man is\nacknowledged in heaven as a minister, treading in the footsteps of his great\nExemplar.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:416.\n315\nFanaticism\nAs the end draws near, the enemy will work with all his power to bring\nin fanaticism among us. He would rejoice to see Seventh-day Adventists\ngoing to such extremes that they would be branded by the world as a body of\nfanatics. Against this danger I am bidden to warn ministers and lay members.\nOur work is to teach men and women to build on a true foundation, to plant\ntheir feet on a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d\nIn 1844 we had to meet fanaticism on every hand, but always the word\ncame to me: \u201cA great wave of excitement is an injury to the work. Keep your\nfeet in the footprints of Christ.\u201d Under great excitement, strange work is done.\nThere are those who improve this opportunity to bring in strange and fanciful\ndoctrines. Thus the door is closed to the proclamation of sound doctrine.\nThose who do the work of the Lord in the cities must close and bolt the\ndoors against excitement and fanaticism. Ministers are not to issue notices\nof meetings so worded as to create an alarm. When the Lord is ready for the\nadvanced denunciation of wicked cities, He will let His people know. But this\nwill be after these cities have had an opportunity to hear and receive the word\nthat is unto life eternal.\nOur work now is to enlighten minds in regard to the truths of the\nScriptures. Doors are open for the entrance of truth, and we are to avail\nourselves of every opportunity to reach souls. We are to explain the truth, as\ndid Christ, in many ways, by \ufb01gures\n316\nand parables; but we are to discourage anything of a fanatical nature.\nThe people must be taught to search the word of God for themselves.\nPastors and teachers must point them to the strong fortress, into which the\nrighteous may run and be safe. Those who are handling the great, grand,\nennobling truths of the Word, must ever reveal a spirit deep, earnest, fervent,\nbut calm and full of sound sense that the mouths of gainsayers may be\nstopped.\nThose who are close students of the Word, following Christ in humility of\nsoul, will not go to extremes. The Saviour never went to extremes, never lost\nself-control, never violated the laws of good taste. He knew when to speak\nand when to keep silent. He was always self-possessed. He never erred in\nHis judgment of men or of truth. He was never deceived by appearances. He\nnever raised a question that was not clearly appropriate, never gave an answer\nthat was not right to the point. He silenced the voice of the caviling priests by\npenetrating beneath the surface and reaching the heart, \ufb02ashing light into the\nmind and awakening the conscience.\nThose who follow the example of Christ will not be extremists. They will\ncultivate calmness and self-possession. The peace that was seen in the life of\nChrist will be seen in their lives.\n317\nSelf-Con\ufb01dence\nYoung men who have had only a few years of imperfect experience in\nthe cause of present truth ...should manifest a delicacy in taking positions\ncontrary to the judgment and opinions of those whose lives have been\ninterwoven with the cause of God and who have had an active part in this\nwork for many years. God does not select to lead out in His sacred, important\nwork, men of immature judgment and great self-con\ufb01dence. Those who have\nnot passed through the sufferings, trials, opposition, and privations that have\nbeen endured to bring the work to its present condition of prosperity, should\ncultivate modesty and humility. They should be careful how they become\nexalted, lest they be overthrown. They will be accountable for the clear light\nof truth which shines upon them.\nI saw that God is displeased with the disposition that some have to\nmurmur against those who have fought the heaviest battles for them, and\nwho endured so much in the beginning of the message, when the work went\nhard. The experienced laborers,\u2014those who toiled under the weight and\nthe oppressive burdens when there were but few to help bear them,\u2014God\nregards; and He has a jealous care for those who have proved faithful. He\nis displeased with those who are ready to \ufb01nd fault with and reproach the\nservants of God who have grown gray in building up the cause of present\ntruth. Your reproaches and murmurings, young men, will surely stand against\nyou in the day of God.\n318\nHumility in Young Ministers\nAs long as God has not laid heavy responsibilities upon you, do not\nget out of your place, and rely upon your own independent judgment, and\nassume responsibilities for which you are not \ufb01tted. You need to cultivate\nwatchfulness and humility, and to be diligent in prayer. The nearer you live\nto God, the more clearly will you discern your weaknesses and dangers. A\npractical view of the law of God, and clear discernment of the atonement of\nChrist, will give you a knowledge of yourselves, and will show you wherein\nyou fail to perfect Christian character....\nIn a degree you overlook the necessity of having a divine in\ufb02uence\nconstantly with you. This is positively necessary in doing the work of God. If\nyou neglect this, and pass on in self-con\ufb01dence and self-suf\ufb01ciency, you will\nbe left to make very great blunders. You need constantly to cherish lowliness\nof mind and a spirit of dependence. He who feels his own weakness will\nlook higher than himself, and will feel the need of constant strength from\nabove. The grace of God will lead him to cherish a spirit of constant gratitude.\nHe who is best acquainted with his own weakness will know that it is the\nmatchless grace of God alone that triumphs over the rebellion of the heart.\nYou need to become acquainted with the weak as well as the strong points\nin your characters, that you may be constantly guarded lest you engage in\nenterprises and assume responsibilities for which God has never designed\nyou. You should not compare your actions and measure your lives by any\nhuman standard, but with the rule of duty revealed in the Bible....\n319\nYou are too dependent upon your surroundings. If you have a large\ncongregation, you are elated, and you desire to address them. But sometimes\nyour congregations diminish, your spirits sink, and you have but little courage\nto labor. Surely, something is wanting. Your hold upon God is not \ufb01rm\nenough....\nChrist sought for men wherever He could \ufb01nd them,\u2014in the public\nstreets, in private houses, in the synagogues, by the seaside. He toiled all\nday, preaching to the multitude, and healing the sick that were brought to\nHim; and frequently, after He had dismissed the people that they might return\nto their homes to rest and sleep, He spent the entire night in prayer, to come\nforth and renew His labors in the morning....\nYou need to bring your soul into close communion with God by earnest\nprayer mixed with living faith. Every prayer offered in faith lifts the suppliant\nabove discouraging doubts and human passions. Prayer gives strength to\nrenew the con\ufb02ict with the powers of darkness, to bear trials patiently, and\nto endure hardness as good soldiers of Christ.\nWhile you take counsel with your doubts and fears, or try to solve\neverything that you cannot see clearly before you have faith, your perplexities\nwill only increase and deepen. If you come to God, feeling helpless and\ndependent, as you really are, and in humble, trusting prayer make your wants\nknown to Him whose knowledge is in\ufb01nite, who sees everything in creation,\nand who governs everything by His will and word, He can and will attend\nto your cry, and will let light shine into your heart and all around you; for\nthrough sincere prayer your soul is brought into\n320\nconnection with the mind of the In\ufb01nite. You may have no remarkable\nevidence at the time that the face of your Redeemer is bending over you in\ncompassion and love, but this is even so. You may not feel His visible touch,\nbut His hand is upon you in love and pitying tenderness....\nYou have need of constant watchfulness, lest Satan beguile you through\nhis subtlety, corrupt your minds, and lead you into inconsistencies and gross\ndarkness. Your watchfulness should be characterized by a spirit of humble\ndependence upon God. It should not be carried on with a proud, self-reliant\nspirit, but with a deep sense of your personal weakness, and a childlike trust\nin the promises of God.\nDays of Con\ufb02ict and Soul-Anguish\nIt is now an easy and pleasant task to preach the truth of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage, in comparison with what it was when the message \ufb01rst started, when\nthe numbers were few, and we were looked upon as fanatics. Those who bore\nthe responsibility of the work in the rise and early progress of the message,\nknew what con\ufb02ict, distress, and soul-anguish are. Night and day the burden\nwas heavy upon them. They thought not of rest or convenience, even when\nthey were pressed with suffering and disease. The shortness of time called\nfor activity, and the laborers were few.\nFrequently, when brought into strait places, the entire night was spent in\nearnest, agonizing prayer, with tears, for help from God, and for light to shine\nupon His word. When the light did come, and the clouds were driven back,\nwhat joy and grateful\n321\nhappiness rested upon the anxious, earnest seekers! Our gratitude to God was\nas complete as had been our earnest, hungering cry for light. Some nights we\ncould not sleep because our hearts were over\ufb02owing with love and gratitude\nto God.\nMen who now go forth to preach the truth, have things made ready to\ntheir hand. They cannot experience such privations as the laborers in present\ntruth endured before them. The truth has been brought out link after link, till\nit forms a clear, connected chain. To bring the truth out in such clearness\nand harmony has required careful research. Opposition, the most bitter\nand determined, drove the servants of God to the Lord and to their Bibles.\nPrecious indeed to them was the light which came from God....\nIn the \ufb01nal victory, God will have no use for those persons who are\nnowhere to be found in time of peril and danger, when the strength, courage,\nand in\ufb02uence of all are required to make a charge upon the enemy. Those who\nstand like faithful soldiers to battle against wrong and to vindicate the right,\nwarring against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness\nof this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places, will each receive\nthe commendation from the Master, \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant;\n...enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d [Matthew 25:23.]\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch,\u201d V ol. III, pages 320-327. *****\nHe who loses sight of his entire dependence upon God is sure to fall. We\nare contending with those who are stronger than we. Satan and his hosts are\nconstantly watching to assail us with temptations,\n322\nand in our own strength and wisdom it is impossible for us to withstand them.\nHence, whenever we permit our hearts to be drawn away from God, whenever\nwe indulge self-exaltation or self-dependence, we are sure to be overthrown.\n*****\nThe world will never know the work secretly going on between the soul\nand God, nor the inward bitterness of spirit, the self-loathing, and the constant\nefforts to control self; but many of the world will be able to appreciate the\nresult of these efforts. *****\nThose who have the deepest experience in the things of God, are the\nfarthest removed from pride or self-exaltation. It is when men have the most\nexalted conceptions of the glory and excellence of Christ, that self is abased,\nand they feel that the lowest place in His service is too honorable for them.\n*****\nThe Lord wants us to come up into the mount, more directly into His\npresence. We are coming to a crisis which, more than any previous time since\nthe world began, will demand the entire consecration of every one who has\nnamed the name of Christ.\nMay God make His servants wise through the divine illumination, that the\nimpress of man may not be seen on any of the great and important enterprises\nbefore us.\n323\nWords of Caution\nChrist said to His disciples, \u201cBehold, I send you forth as sheep in the\nmidst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.\u201d\n[Matthew 10:16.]\nSatan\u2019s attacks against the advocates of the truth will wax more bitter and\ndetermined to the very close of time. As in Christ\u2019s day the chief priests and\nrulers stirred up the people against Him, so today the religious leaders will\nexcite bitterness and prejudice against the truth for this time. The people will\nbe led to acts of violence and opposition which they would never have thought\nof had they not been imbued with the animosity of professed Christians\nagainst the truth.\nHow to Meet Bitter Attacks\nWhat course shall the advocates of truth pursue? They have the\nunchangeable, eternal word of God, and they should reveal the fact that they\nhave the truth as it is in Jesus. Their words must not be rugged or sharp.\nIn their presentation of truth they must manifest the love and meekness and\ngentleness of Christ. Let the truth do the cutting; the word of God is as a\nsharp, two-edged sword, and will cut its way to the heart. Those who know\nthat they have the truth should not, by the use of harsh and severe expressions,\ngive Satan one chance to misinterpret their spirit.\nAs a people, we must stand as did the world\u2019s Redeemer. When in\ncontroversy with Satan in regard to the body of Moses, Christ \u201cdurst not bring\n324\nagainst him a railing accusation.\u201d [Jude 9.] He had every provocation to do\nthis, and Satan was disappointed because he could not arouse in Christ a spirit\nof retaliation. Satan was ready to misinterpret everything that was done by\nJesus; and the Saviour would give him no occasion, not the semblance of an\nexcuse. He would not turn from His straightforward course of truth in order\nto follow the wanderings, and twistings, and turnings, and prevarications of\nSatan.\nWe read in the prophecy of Zechariah that when Satan with all his\nsynagogue stood up to resist the prayers of Joshua, the high priest, and to\nresist Christ, who was about to show decided favor to Joshua, the Lord said\nto Satan, \u201cThe Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen\nJerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the \ufb01re?\u201d [Zechariah\n3:2.]\nThe course of Christ in dealing with even the adversary of souls should\nbe an example to us in all our intercourse with others,\u2014never to bring a\nrailing accusation against any; much less should we employ harshness or\nseverity toward those who may be as anxious to know the right way as we\nare ourselves.\nMaking Allowance for Others\nThose who have been educated in the truth by precept and example,\nshould make great allowance for others who have had no knowledge of\nthe Scriptures except through the interpretations given by ministers and\nchurch-members, and who have received traditions and fables as Bible truth.\nThey are surprised by the presentation of truth; it is as a new revelation to\nthem, and they cannot bear to have\n325\nall the truth, in its most striking character, presented to them at the outset.\nAll is new and strange, and wholly unlike that which they have heard from\ntheir ministers; and they are inclined to believe what the ministers have told\nthem,\u2014that Seventh-day Adventists are in\ufb01dels, and do not believe the Bible.\nLet the truth be presented as it is in Jesus, line upon line, precept upon precept,\nhere a little and there a little.\nNot to Hedge Up the Way\nLet not those who write for our papers make unkind thrusts and allusions\nthat will certainly do harm, and that will hedge up the way, and hinder us from\ndoing the work that we should do in order to reach all classes, the Catholics\nincluded. It is our work to speak the truth in love, and not to mix in with\nthe truth the unsancti\ufb01ed elements of the natural heart, and speak things that\nsavor of the same spirit possessed by our enemies. All sharp thrusts will come\nback upon us in double measure when the power is in the hands of those who\ncan exercise it for our injury.\nOver and over the message has been given to me, that we are not to say one\nword, not to publish one sentence, especially by way of personalities,\u2014unless\npositively essential in vindicating the truth,\u2014that will stir up our enemies\nagainst us, and arouse their passions to a white heat. Our work will soon be\nclosed up; and soon the time of trouble, such as never was, will come upon\nus, of which we have but little idea.\nThe Lord wants His workers to represent Him, the great missionary\nworker. The manifestation of rashness always does harm. The properties\nessential\n326\nfor Christian life must be learned daily in the school of Christ. He who is\ncareless and heedless in uttering words or in writing words for publication\nto be sent broadcast into the world, sending forth expressions that can never\nbe taken back, is disqualifying himself to be entrusted with the sacred work\nthat devolves upon Christ\u2019s followers at this time. Those who practice giving\nharsh thrusts, are forming habits that will strengthen by repetition, and will\nhave to be repented of. We should carefully examine our ways and our spirit,\nand see in what manner we are doing the work given us of God, a work which\ninvolves the destiny of souls. The very highest obligation is resting upon us.\nSatan is standing ready, burning with zeal to inspire the whole\nconfederacy of satanic agencies, that he may cause them to unite with evil\nmen, and bring upon the believers of truth speedy and severe suffering.\nEvery unwise word that is uttered by our brethren will be treasured up by\nthe prince of darkness. How dare \ufb01nite human intelligences speak careless\nand venturesome words that will stir up the powers of hell against the saints\nof God, when Michael the archangel durst not bring against Satan a railing\naccusation, but said, \u201cThe Lord rebuke thee\u201d?\nIt will be impossible for us to avoid dif\ufb01culties and suffering. Jesus said,\n\u201cIt must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the\noffense cometh.\u201d [Matthew 18:7.] But because offenses will come, we should\nbe careful not to stir up the natural temperament of those who love not the\ntruth, by unwise words, and by the manifestation of an unkind spirit.\n327\nPrecious truth must be presented in its native force. The deceptive errors\nthat are wide-spread, and that are leading the world captive, are to be unveiled.\nEvery effort possible is being made to ensnare souls with subtle reasonings,\nto turn them from the truth to fables, and to prepare them to be deceived\nby strong delusions. But while these deceived souls turn from the truth to\nerror, do not speak to them one word of censure. Seek to show them their\ndanger, and to reveal to them how grievous is their course of action toward\nJesus Christ; but let it be done in pitying tenderness. By a proper manner of\nlabor some of the souls who are ensnared by Satan may be recovered from\nhis power. But do not blame and condemn them. To ridicule the position held\nby those who are in error, will not open their blind eyes, nor attract them to\nthe truth.\nWhen men lose sight of Christ\u2019s example, and do not pattern after His\nmanner of teaching, they become self-suf\ufb01cient, and go forth to meet Satan\nwith his own manner of weapons. The enemy knows well how to turn his\nweapons upon those who use them. Jesus spoke only words of pure truth and\nrighteousness.\nIf ever a people needed to walk in humility before God, it is His church,\nHis chosen ones in this generation. We all need to bewail the dulness\nof our intellectual faculties, the lack of appreciation of our privileges and\nopportunities. We have nothing whereof to boast. We grieve the Lord Jesus\nChrist by our harshness, by our unchristlike thrusts. We need to become\ncomplete in Him.\nIt is true that we are commanded to \u201ccry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice\nlike a trumpet, and show\n328\nMy people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\u201d [Isaiah\n58:1.] This message must be given; but we should be careful not to thrust\nand crowd and condemn those who have not the light that we have. We\nshould not go out of our way to make hard thrusts at Catholics. Among\nthe Catholics there are many who are most conscientious Christians, and who\nwalk in all the light that shines upon them; and God will work in their behalf.\nThose who have had great privileges and opportunities, but who have failed\nto improve their physical, mental, and moral powers, and have lived to please\nthemselves, refusing to bear their responsibility, are in greater danger and in\ngreater condemnation before God, than those who are in error upon doctrinal\npoints, yet who seek to live to do good to others.\nDo not censure others; do not condemn them. If we allow sel\ufb01sh\nconsiderations, false reasoning, and false excuses to bring us into a perverse\nstate of mind and heart, so that we do not know the ways and will of God, we\nshall be far more guilty than the open sinner. We need to be very cautious in\norder that we may not condemn those who, before God, are less guilty than\nourselves.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:239-244.\n329\nNo Respect of Persons with God\nThe religion of Christ uplifts the receiver to a higher plane of thought\nand action, while at the same time it presents the whole human race as alike\nthe objects of the love of God, being purchased by the sacri\ufb01ce of His Son.\nAt the feet of Jesus, the rich and the poor, the learned and the ignorant,\nmeet together, with no thought of caste or worldly pre-eminence. All earthly\ndistinctions are forgotten as we look upon Him whom our sins have pierced.\nThe self-denial, the condescension, the in\ufb01nite compassion of Him who\nwas highly exalted in heaven, puts to shame human pride, self-esteem, and\nsocial caste. Pure, unde\ufb01led religion manifests its heaven-born principles in\nbringing into oneness all who are sancti\ufb01ed through the truth. All meet as\nblood-bought souls, alike dependent upon Him who has redeemed them to\nGod.\nTalents\nThe Lord has lent men talents to improve. Those whom He has entrusted\nwith money are to bring their talent of means to the Master. Men and women\nof in\ufb02uence are to use that which God has given them. The ones whom He\nhas endowed with wisdom are to bring to the cross of Christ this gift to be\nused to His glory.\nAnd the poor have their talent, which perhaps may be larger than any\nother mentioned. It may be simplicity of character, humility, tried virtue,\ncon\ufb01dence in God. Through patient toil, through their entire dependence\nupon God, they are pointing those with\n330\nwhom they associate to Jesus, their Redeemer. They have a heart full of\nsympathy for the poor, a home for the needy and oppressed, and their\ntestimony is clear and decided as to what Jesus is to them. They seek for\nglory, honor, and immortality, and their reward will be eternal life.\nHuman Brotherhood\nIn the human brotherhood it takes all kinds of talents to make a perfect\nwhole; and the church of Christ is composed of men and women of varied\ntalents, and of all ranks and all classes. God never designed that the pride\nof men should dissolve that which His own wisdom had ordained,\u2014the\ncombination of all classes of minds, of all the varied talents that make a\ncomplete whole. There should be no depreciating of any part of God\u2019s great\nwork, whether the agencies are high or lowly. All have their part to act in\ndiffusing light in different degrees.\nThere should be no monopolizing of what belongs, in a measure, to\nall, high and low, rich and poor, learned and unlearned. Not a ray of light\nmust be undervalued, not a ray shut out, not a gleam unrecognized, or even\nacknowledged reluctantly. Let all act their part for truth and righteousness.\nThe interests of the different classes of society are indissolubly united. We are\nall woven together in the great web of humanity, and we cannot, without loss,\nwithdraw our sympathies from one another. It is impossible for a healthy\nin\ufb02uence to be maintained in the church when this common interest and\nsympathy does not exist.\n331\nExclusiveness\nThere is no caste with God. He ignores everything of the kind. All souls\nare of value with Him. Laboring for the salvation of the soul is employment\nworthy of the highest honor. It matters not what may be the form of our labor,\nor among what class, whether high or low. In God\u2019s sight these distinctions\nwill not affect its true worth. The sincere, earnest, contrite soul, however\nignorant, is precious in the sight of the Lord. He places His own signet upon\nmen, judging, not by their rank, not by their wealth, not by their intellectual\ngreatness, but by their oneness with Christ. The unlearned, the outcast, the\nslave, if he has made the most of his opportunities and privileges, if he has\ncherished the light given him of God, has done all that is required. The world\nmay call him ignorant, but God calls him wise and good, and thus his name\nstands registered in the books of heaven. God will \ufb01t him up to do Him honor,\nnot only in heaven, but on the earth.\nThe divine rebuke is upon him who refuses the companionship of those\nwhose names are written in the Lamb\u2019s book of life, simply because they\nare not rich, learned, or honored in this world. Christ, the Lord of glory, is\nsatis\ufb01ed with those who are meek and lowly in heart, however humble may\nbe their calling, whatever their rank or degree of intelligence.\nTraining for Service\nHow many useful and honored workers in God\u2019s cause have received a\ntraining amid the humble duties of the most lowly positions in life! Moses\nwas the prospective ruler of Egypt, but God could not take\n332\nhim from the king\u2019s court to do the work appointed him. Only when he had\nbeen for forty years a faithful shepherd was he sent to be the deliverer of his\npeople. Gideon was taken from the threshing-\ufb02oor to be the instrument in the\nhands of God for delivering the armies of Israel. Elisha was called to leave\nthe plow and do the bidding of God. Amos was a husbandman, a tiller of the\nsoil, when God gave him a message to proclaim.\nAll who become co-workers with Christ will have a great deal of hard,\nuncongenial labor to perform, and their lessons of instruction should be\nwisely chosen, and adapted to their peculiarities of character, and the work\nwhich they are to pursue.\nCare in Training the Youth\nThe Lord has presented to me, in many ways and at various times,\nhow carefully we should deal with the young,\u2014that it requires the \ufb01nest\ndiscrimination to deal with minds. Every one who has to do with the\neducation and training of youth, needs to live very close to the great Teacher,\nto catch His spirit and manner of work. Lessons are to be given which will\naffect their character and life-work.\nThey should be taught that the gospel of Christ tolerates no spirit of caste,\nthat it gives no place to unkind judgment of others, which tends directly to\nself-exaltation. The religion of Jesus never degrades the receiver, nor makes\nhim coarse and rough; nor does it make him unkind in thought and feeling\ntoward those for whom Christ died.\nThere is danger of attaching too much importance to the matter of\netiquette, and diverting much\n333\ntime to education upon the subject of manner and form, that can never be\nof great use to many youth. Some are in danger of making the externals\nall-important, of overestimating the value of mere conventionalities. The\nresults will not warrant the expenditure of the time and thought given to\nthese matters. Some who are trained to give much attention to these things,\nmanifest little true respect or sympathy for anything, however excellent, that\nfails to meet their standard of conventionality.\nAnything that would encourage ungenerous criticism, a disposition to\nnotice and expose every defect or error, is wrong. It fosters distrust and\nsuspicion, which are contrary to the character of Christ, and detrimental to the\nmind thus exercised. Those who are engaged in this work, gradually depart\nfrom the true spirit of Christianity.\nThe most essential, enduring education is that which will develop the\nnobler qualities, which will encourage a spirit of universal kindliness, leading\nthe youth to think no evil of any one, lest they misjudge motives and\nmisinterpret words and actions. The time devoted to this kind of instruction\nwill yield fruit to everlasting life. *****\nChrist\u2019s Example a Rebuke to Exclusiveness\nIn every age since Christ was among men, there have been some who\nchose to seclude themselves from others, manifesting a Pharisaical desire for\npreeminence. Shutting themselves away from the world, they have not lived\nto bless their fellow-men.\nThere is no example in the life of Christ for this self-righteous bigotry;\nHis character was genial and\n334\nbene\ufb01cent. There is not a monastic order upon earth from which He would not\nhave been excluded for overstepping the prescribed rules. In every religious\ndenomination, and in almost every church, are to be found erratics who would\nhave blamed Him for His liberal mercies. They would have found fault with\nHim because He ate with publicans and sinners; they would have accused\nHim of worldly conformity in attending a wedding feast, and would have\ncensured Him unmercifully for permitting His friends to make a supper in\nhonor of Him and His disciples.\nBut on these very occasions, by His teachings, as well as by His generous\nconduct, He was enshrining Himself in the hearts of those whom He honored\nwith His presence. He was giving them an opportunity to become acquainted\nwith Him, and to see the marked contrast between His life and teachings and\nthose of the Pharisees.\nThose with whom God has entrusted His truth, must possess the same\nbene\ufb01cent spirit that Christ manifested. They must adopt the same broad\nplans of action. They should have a kind, generous spirit toward the poor,\nand in a special sense feel that they are God\u2019s stewards. They must hold all\nthey have\u2014property, mental powers, spiritual strength\u2014as not their own, but\nonly lent them to advance the cause of Christ in the earth. Like Christ, they\nshould not shun the society of their fellow-men, but should seek it with the\npurpose of bestowing upon others the heavenly bene\ufb01ts they have received\nfrom God. *****\nDo not be exclusive. Do not seek out a few with whom you delight to\nassociate, and leave others to\n335\ntake care of themselves. Suppose you do see weakness in one and folly in\nanother; do not stand aloof from them, and associate with those only who\nyou think are about perfect.\nThe very souls you despise need your love and sympathy. Do not leave\na weak soul to struggle alone, to wrestle with the passions of his own heart\nwithout your help and prayers, but consider yourself, lest you also be tempted.\nIf you do this, God will not leave you to your own weakness. You may have\nsins greater in His sight than the sins of those you condemn. Do not stand off\nand say, \u201cI am holier than thou.\u201d\nChrist has thrown His divine arm around the human race. He has\nbrought His divine power to man, that He might encourage the poor, sin-sick,\ndiscouraged soul to reach up for a higher life. O, we need more of Christ\u2019s\nspirit, and much less of self! We need the converting power of God upon our\nhearts daily. We need the mellowing spirit of Christ, to subdue and soften our\nsouls. The only way for those to do who feel that they are whole, is to fall\nupon the Rock and be broken. Christ can change you into His likeness, if you\nwill submit yourself to Him. *****\nIf we follow in Christ\u2019s footsteps, we must come close to those who\nneed our ministry. We must open the Bible to the understanding, present the\nclaims of God\u2019s law, read the promises to the hesitating, arouse the careless,\nstrengthen the weak.\n336\nSeclusion\nThe incessant reading and writing of many ministers un\ufb01ts them for\npastoral work. They consume valuable time in abstract study, which should\nbe expended in helping the needy at the right moment. Some ministers have\ngiven themselves to the work of writing during a period of decided religious\ninterest, and sometimes these writings have had no special connection with\nthe work in hand. At such times it is the duty of the minister to use his entire\nstrength in pushing forward the present interest. His mind should be clear,\nand centered upon the one object of saving souls. Should his thoughts be\npreoccupied with other subjects, many might be lost to the cause who could\nhave been saved by timely instruction.\nWhen the temptation comes to seclude themselves, and to indulge in\nreading and writing at a time when other duties claim their immediate\nattention, ministers should be strong enough to deny self, and devote\nthemselves to the work that lies directly before them. This is undoubtedly\none of the most trying tests that a studious mind is called to undergo.\nThe duties of a pastor are often shamelessly neglected because the\nminister lacks strength to sacri\ufb01ce his personal inclinations for seclusion and\nstudy. The pastor should visit from house to house among his \ufb02ock, teaching,\nconversing, and praying with each family, and looking out for the welfare of\ntheir souls. Those who have manifested a desire to become acquainted with\nthe principles of our faith should not be neglected, but thoroughly instructed\nin the truth.\n337\nCertain ministers who have been invited to houses by the heads of\nfamilies, have spent the few hours of their visit in secluding themselves in\nan unoccupied room to indulge their inclination for reading and writing. The\nfamily that entertained them derived no bene\ufb01t from the visit. The ministers\naccepted the hospitality extended them without giving an equivalent in the\nlabor that was so much needed.\nPeople are easily reached through the avenues of the social circle. But\nmany ministers dread the task of visiting; they have not cultivated social\nqualities, have not acquired that genial spirit that wins its way to the hearts of\nthe people.\nThose who seclude themselves from the people are in no condition to help\nthem. A skilful physician must understand the nature of various diseases, and\nmust have a thorough knowledge of the human structure. He must be prompt\nin attending to the patients. He knows that delays are dangerous. When his\nexperienced hand is laid upon the pulse of the sufferer, and he carefully notes\nthe peculiar indication of the malady, his previous knowledge enables him to\ndetermine the nature of the disease, and the treatment necessary to arrest its\nprogress.\nAs the physician deals with physical disease, so does the pastor minister\nto the sin-sick soul. And his work is as much more important than that of the\nphysician as eternal life is more valuable than temporal existence. The pastor\nmeets with an endless variety of temperaments; and it is his duty to become\nacquainted with the members of the families that listen to his teachings, in\norder to determine what means will best in\ufb02uence them in the right direction.\n338\nMinisters and Commercial Business\nMinisters cannot do acceptable work for God, and at the same time carry\nthe burden of large personal business enterprises. Such a division of interest\ndims their spiritual perception. The mind and heart are occupied with earthly\nthings, and the service of Christ takes a second place. They seek to shape\ntheir work for God by their circumstances, instead of shaping circumstances\nto meet the demands of God.\nThe energies of the minister are all needed for his high calling. His\nbest powers belong to God. He should not engage in speculation, or in any\nother business that would turn him aside from his great work. \u201cNo man that\nwarreth,\u201d Paul declared, \u201centangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that\nhe may please Him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.\u201d [2 Timothy 2:4.]\nThus the apostle emphasized the minister\u2019s need of unreserved consecration\nto the Master\u2019s service.\nThe minister who is wholly consecrated to God refuses to engage in\nbusiness that would hinder him from giving himself fully to his sacred calling.\nHe is not striving for earthly honor or riches; his one purpose is to tell others\nof the Saviour, who gave Himself to bring to human beings the riches of\neternal life. His highest desire is not to lay up treasure in this world, but to\nbring to the attention of the indifferent and disloyal the realities of eternity.\nHe may be asked to engage in enterprises which promise large worldly gain,\nbut to such temptations he returns the\n339\nanswer, \u201cWhat shall it pro\ufb01t a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose\nhis own soul?\u201d [Mark 8:36.]\nSatan presented this inducement to Christ, knowing that if He accepted it,\nthe world would never be ransomed. And under different guises he presents\nthe same temptation to God\u2019s ministers today, knowing that those who are\nbeguiled by it will be false to their trust.\nIt is not God\u2019s will that His ministers should seek to be rich. Regarding\nthis Paul wrote to Timothy: \u201cThe love of money is the root of all evil:\nwhich while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced\nthemselves through with many sorrows. But thou, O man of God, \ufb02ee\nthese things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience,\nmeekness.\u201d [1 Timothy 6:10, 11.] By example as well as by precept, the\nambassador for Christ is to \u201ccharge them that are rich in this world, that they\nbe not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who\ngiveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in\ngood works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store\nfor themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may\nlay hold on eternal life.\u201d [1 Timothy 6:17-19.]\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles,\n365-367. *****\nMinisters cannot carry the burden of the work while at the same time they\nare carrying the burden of farms or other business enterprises, having their\nhearts on their earthly treasure. Their spiritual discernment is dimmed. They\ncannot appreciate the wants of the cause of God, and therefore cannot put\n340\nforth well-directed efforts to meet its emergencies and to advance its interests.\nThe want of a full consecration to the work on the part of the minister is soon\nfelt all through the \ufb01eld where he labors. If his own standard is low, he will\nnot bring others to accept a higher one. *****\nLand and Mining Speculation\nThe Lord cannot glorify His name through ministers who attempt to serve\nGod and mammon. We are not to urge men to invest in mining stock, or in\ncity lots, holding out the inducement that the money invested will be doubled\nin a short time. Our message for this time is, \u201cSell that ye have, and give\nalms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens\nthat faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. For\nwhere your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\u201d [Luke 12:33, 34.]\nJust before the Israelites entered the land of Canaan, Satan sought to\nseduce them, and lead them into idolatry, thinking to compass their ruin. He\nworks in the same way in our day. There are young men whom God would\naccept as workers together with Him, but they have become absorbed in the\nreal-estate craze, and have sold their interest in the truth for the prospect of\nworldly advantage.\nThere are many who hold themselves away from the service of God,\nbecause they desire worldly gain; and Satan uses them to lead others astray.\nThe tempter comes to men as he came to Jesus, presenting the glory of the\nworld; and when a measure of success attends their ventures, they become\ngreedy for\n341\nmore gain, lose their love for the truth, and their spirituality dies. The\nimmortal inheritance, the love of Jesus, is eclipsed to their vision by the\n\ufb02eeting prospects of this world. *****\nThe people will seldom rise higher than their minister. A world-loving\nspirit in him has a tremendous in\ufb02uence upon others. The people make his\nde\ufb01ciencies an excuse to cover their own world-loving spirit. They quiet\ntheir consciences, thinking that they may be free to love the things of this life\nand be indifferent to spiritual things, because their ministers are so. They\ndeceive their own souls, and remain in friendship with the world, which\nthe apostle declares to be \u201cenmity against God.\u201d [Romans 8:7.] Ministers\nshould be examples to the \ufb02ock. They should manifest an undying love for\nsouls, and the same devotion to the cause which they desire to see in the\npeople.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:645, 646. *****\nWe are nearing the close of time. We want not only to teach present\ntruth in the pulpit, but to live it out of the pulpit. Examine closely the\nfoundation of your hope of salvation. While you stand in the position of a\nherald of truth, a watchman upon the walls of Zion, you cannot have your\ninterest interwoven with mining or real-estate business, and at the same time\ndo effectually the sacred work committed to your hands. Where the souls of\nmen are at stake, where eternal things are involved, the interest cannot safely\nbe divided.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:530.\n342\n343\n344\nSection IX. Methods\nLabor in the Cities\nIn connection with the proclamation of the message in large cities, there\nare many kinds of work to be done by laborers with varied gifts. Some are to\nlabor in one way, some in another. The Lord desires that the cities shall be\nworked by the united efforts of laborers of different capabilities. All are to\nlook to Jesus for direction, not depending on man for wisdom, lest they be led\nastray. As laborers together with God, they should seek to be in harmony with\none another. There should be frequent councils, and earnest, whole-hearted\nco-operation. Yet all are to look to Jesus for wisdom, not depending upon\nmen alone for direction.\nThe Lord has given to some ministers the ability to gather and to hold\nlarge congregations. This calls for the exercise of tact and skill. In the cities\nof today, where there is so much to attract and please, the people can be\ninterested by no ordinary efforts. Ministers of God\u2019s appointment will \ufb01nd it\nnecessary to put forth extraordinary efforts in order to arrest the attention of\nthe multitudes. And when they succeed in bringing together a large number\nof people, they must bear messages of a character so out of the usual order\nthat the people will be aroused and warned.\n345\nThey must make use of every means that can possibly be devised for causing\nthe truth to stand out clearly and distinctly. The testing message for this time\nis to be borne so plainly and decidedly as to startle the hearers, and lead them\nto desire to study the Scriptures.\nThose who do the work of the Lord in the cities must put forth calm,\nsteady, devoted effort for the education of the people. While they are to labor\nearnestly to interest the hearers, and to hold this interest, yet at the same time\nthey must carefully guard against anything that borders on sensationalism.\nIn this age of extravagance and outward show, when men think it necessary\nto make a display in order to gain success, God\u2019s chosen messengers are to\nshow the fallacy of spending means needlessly for effect. As they labor with\nsimplicity, humility, and graceful dignity, avoiding everything of a theatrical\nnature, their work will make a lasting impression for good.\nThere is a necessity, it is true, for expending money judiciously in\nadvertising the meetings, and in carrying forward the work solidly. Yet the\nstrength of every worker will be found to lie, not in these outward agencies,\nbut in trustful dependence upon God, in earnest prayer to Him for help, in\nobedience to His word. Much more prayer, much more Christlikeness, much\nmore conformity to God\u2019s will, is to be brought into the Lord\u2019s work. Outward\nshow and extravagant outlay of means will not accomplish the work to be\ndone.\nGod\u2019s work is to be carried forward with power. We need the baptism of\nthe Holy Spirit. We need\n346\nto understand that God will add to the ranks of His people men of ability and\nin\ufb02uence who are to act their part in warning the world. Not all in the world\nare lawless and sinful. God has many thousands who have not bowed the\nknee to Baal. There are God-fearing men and women in the fallen churches.\nIf this were not so, we would not be given the message to bear: \u201cBabylon the\ngreat is fallen, is fallen.\u201d \u201cCome out of her, My people.\u201d [Revelation 18:2,\n4.] Many of the honest in heart are gasping for a breath of life from heaven.\nThey will recognize the gospel when it is brought to them in the beauty and\nsimplicity with which it is presented in God\u2019s word....\nTeaching the Principles of Health Reform\nAs a people we have been given the work of making known the principles\nof health reform. There are some who think that the question of diet is not\nof suf\ufb01cient importance to be included in their evangelistic work. But such\nmake a great mistake. God\u2019s word declares, \u201cWhether therefore ye eat, or\ndrink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\u201d [1 Corinthians 10:31.]\nThe subject of temperance, in all its bearings, has an important place in the\nwork of salvation.\nIn connection with our city missions there should be suitable rooms where\nthose in whom an interest has been awakened can be gathered for instruction.\nThis necessary work is not to be carried on in such a meager way that an\nunfavorable impression will be made on the minds of the people. All that is\ndone should bear favorable witness to the Author of truth, and should properly\nrepresent the sacredness and\n347\nimportance of the truths of the third angel\u2019s message....\nThe work of health reform is the Lord\u2019s means for lessening suffering in\nour world and for purifying His church. Teach the people that they can act\nas God\u2019s helping hand, by co-operating with the Master-worker in restoring\nphysical and spiritual health. This work bears the signature of Heaven, and\nwill open doors for the entrance of other precious truths. There is room for\nall to labor who will take hold of this work intelligently.\nKeep the work of health reform to the front, is the message I am instructed\nto bear. Show so plainly its value that a wide-spread need for it will be\nfelt. Abstinence from all hurtful food and drink is the fruit of true religion.\nHe who is thoroughly converted will abandon every injurious habit and\nappetite. By total abstinence he will overcome his desire for health-destroying\nindulgences....\nWork for the Wealthy Classes\nThe servants of Christ should labor faithfully for the rich men in our cities,\nas well as for the poor and lowly. There are many wealthy men who are\nsusceptible to the in\ufb02uences and impressions of the gospel message, and who,\nwhen the Bible and the Bible alone is presented to them as the expositor of\nChristian faith and practice, will be moved by the Spirit of God to open doors\nfor the advancement of the gospel. They will reveal a living faith in the word\nof God, and will use their entrusted means to prepare the way of the Lord, to\nmake straight in the desert a highway for our God.\n348\nFor years the perplexing question has been before us, How can we raise\nfunds adequate for the support of the missions which the Lord has gone before\nus to open? We read the plain commands of the gospel, and the missions, in\nboth home and foreign \ufb01elds, present their necessities. The indications, yea,\nthe positive revelations, of Providence unite in urging us to do quickly the\nwork that is waiting to be done.\nThe Lord desires that moneyed men shall be converted, and act as His\nhelping hand in reaching others. He desires that those who can help in\nthe work of reform and restoration shall see the precious light of truth, be\ntransformed in character, and be led to use their entrusted capital in His\nservice. He would have them invest the means He has lent them, in doing\ngood, in opening the way for the gospel to be preached to all classes, nigh\nand afar off.\nWill not heaven be appreciated by the worldly wise men?\u2014O, yes; there\nthey will \ufb01nd rest and peace and repose from all tri\ufb02ing, all ambition, all\nself-serving. Urge them to seek for the peace and happiness and joy that\nChrist is longing to bestow upon them. Urge them to give their attention to\nsecuring the richest gift that can be given to mortal man,\u2014the robe of Christ\u2019s\nrighteousness. Christ offers them a life that measures with the life of God, and\na far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. If they accept Christ, they\nwill have the highest honor\u2014honor which the world can neither give nor take\naway. They will \ufb01nd that in the keeping of the commandments of God there\nis great reward.\n349\nThe compassionate Redeemer bids His servants give to rich and poor the\ncall to the supper. Go out into the highways and the hedges, and by your\npersevering, determined efforts, compel them to come in. Let ministers of\nthe gospel take hold of these worldly moneyed men, and bring them to the\nbanquet of truth that Christ has prepared for them. He who gave His precious\nlife for them says, \u201cBring them in, and seat them at My table, and I will serve\nthem.\u201d\nMinisters of Christ, link yourselves up with this class. Pass them not by\nas hopeless. Work with all the persuasion possible, and as the fruit of your\nfaithful efforts you will see in the kingdom of heaven men and women who\nwill be crowned as overcomers, to sing the triumphant song of the conqueror.\n\u201cThey shall walk with Me, in white,\u201d says the First and the Last; \u201cfor they are\nworthy.\u201d [Revelation 3:4.]\nAltogether too little effort has been put forth for men in responsible places\nin the world. Many of them possess superior quali\ufb01cations; they have means\nand in\ufb02uence. These are precious gifts, entrusted to them by the Lord to be\nincreased and used for the good of others.\nSeek to save men of wealth. Entreat them to return to the Lord the\ntreasures He has lent them in trust, that in New York and other great cities\nthere may be established centers of in\ufb02uence from which Bible truth in its\nsimplicity shall go forth to the people. Persuade men to lay up their treasures\nbeside the throne of God by returning to the Lord their substance, enabling\nHis workers to do good and to advance His glory.\n350\nEnlarging our Forces\nThe strength of an army is measured largely by the ef\ufb01ciency of the men\nin the ranks. A wise general instructs his of\ufb01cers to train every soldier for\nactive service. He seeks to develop the highest ef\ufb01ciency on the part of all.\nIf he were to depend on his of\ufb01cers alone, he could never expect to conduct\na successful campaign. He counts on loyal and untiring service from every\nman in his army. The responsibility rests largely upon the men in the ranks.\nAnd so it is in the army of Prince Emmanuel. Our General, who has\nnever lost a battle, expects willing, faithful service from every one who has\nenlisted under His banner. In the closing controversy now waging between\nthe forces for good and the hosts of evil, He expects all, laymen as well as\nministers, to take part. All who have enlisted as His soldiers are to render\nfaithful service as minutemen, with a keen sense of the responsibility resting\nupon them individually.\nThose who have the spiritual oversight of the church should devise ways\nand means by which an opportunity may be given to every member of the\nchurch to act some part in God\u2019s work. Too often in the past this has not\nbeen done. Plans have not been clearly laid and fully carried out, whereby\nthe talents of all might be employed in active service. There are but few who\nrealize how much has been lost because of this.\nThe leaders in God\u2019s cause, as wise generals, are to lay plans for advance\nmoves all along the line. In their planning they are to give special study to the\n351\nwork that can be done by the laity for their friends and neighbors. The work of\nGod in this earth can never be \ufb01nished until the men and women comprising\nour church membership rally to the work, and unite their efforts with those of\nministers and church of\ufb01cers....\nCenters of Commerce and Travel\nIn these days of travel, the opportunities for coming in contact with\nmen and women of all classes, and of many nationalities, are much greater\nthan in the days of Israel. The thoroughfares of travel have multiplied a\nthousand-fold. God has wonderfully prepared the way. The agency of the\nprinting-press, with its manifold facilities, is at our command. Bibles, and\npublications in many languages, setting forth the truth for this time, are at our\nhand, and can be swiftly carried to every part of the world.\nChristians who are living in the great centers of commerce and travel\nhave special opportunities. Believers in these cities can work for God in the\nneighborhood of their homes.\nIn the world-renowned health resorts and centers of tourist traf\ufb01c,\ncrowded with many thousands of seekers after health and pleasure, there\nshould be stationed ministers and canvassers capable of arresting the attention\nof the multitudes. Let these workers watch their chance for presenting the\nmessage for this time, and hold meetings as they have opportunity. Let them\nbe quick to seize opportunities to speak to the people. Accompanied by the\npower of the Holy Spirit, let them meet the people with the message borne\nby John the Baptist, \u201cRepent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u201d\n[Matthew 3:2.]\n352\nThe word of God is to be presented with clearness and power, that those\nwho have ears to hear may hear the truth. Thus the gospel of present truth\nwill be placed in the way of those who know it not, and it will be accepted by\nnot a few, and carried by them to their own homes in all parts of the world.\nWe are to give the last warning of God to men, and what should be our\nearnestness in studying the Bible, and our zeal in spreading the light! Let\nevery soul who has received the divine illumination seek to impart it. Let the\nworkers go from house to house, opening the Bible to the people, circulating\nthe publications, telling others of the light that has blessed their own souls.\nLet literature be distributed judiciously, on the trains, in the street, on the great\nships that ply the sea, and through the mails....\nI am instructed to point our ministers to the unworked cities, and to urge\nthem by every possible means to open the way for the presentation of the\ntruth. In some of the cities where the message of the second coming of the\nLord was \ufb01rst given, we are compelled to take up the work as if it were a\nnew \ufb01eld. How much longer will these barren \ufb01elds, these unworked cities,\nbe passed by? Without delay, the sowing of the seed should begin in many,\nmany places.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:109-123.\n353\nCounsel Regarding the Work in Cities\nThere is a vast amount of work to be done in proclaiming the truth for this\ntime to those who are dead in trespasses and sins. Most startling messages\nwill be borne by men of God\u2019s appointment, messages of a character to warn\nthe people, to arouse them. And while some will be provoked by the warning,\nand led to resist the light and evidence, we are to see from this that we are\ngiving the testing message for this time.\nMessages will be given out of the usual order. The judgments of God\nare in the land. While city missions must be established where colporteurs,\nBible-workers, and practical medical missionaries may be trained to reach\ncertain classes, we must also have, in our cities, consecrated evangelists\nthrough whom a message is to be borne so decidedly as to startle the hearers....\nThe time has come to make decided efforts in places where the truth has\nnot yet been proclaimed. How shall the Lord\u2019s work be done? In every place\nthat is entered, a solid foundation is to be laid for permanent work. The Lord\u2019s\nmethods are to be followed. It is not for you to be intimidated by outward\nappearances, however forbidding they may be. It is for you to carry forward\nthe work as the Lord has said it should be carried. Preach the word, and the\nLord by His Holy Spirit will send conviction to the minds of the hearers. The\nword is, \u201cThey went\n354\nforth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and con\ufb01rming\nthe word with signs following.\u201d [Mark 16:20.]\nMany workers are to act their part, doing house-to-house work, and\ngiving Bible-readings in families. They are to show their growth in grace\nby submission to the will of Christ. Thus they will gain a rich experience.\nAs in faith they receive, believe, and obey Christ\u2019s word, the ef\ufb01ciency of\nthe Holy Spirit will be seen in their life-work. There will be an intensity of\nearnest effort. There will be cherished a faith that works by love, and puri\ufb01es\nthe soul. The fruits of the Spirit will be seen in the life....\nThere is need of all the instruction that our missions can give. Continue\nyour work in the power of the same Spirit that led in its establishment. By\nopening the Scriptures, by praying, by exercising faith, educate the people in\nthe way of the Lord; and there will be built up a church founded on the rock\nChrist Jesus...\nCarry forward your work in humility. Never rise above the simplicity\nof the gospel of Christ. Not in the art of display, but in lifting up Christ,\nthe sin-pardoning Redeemer, will you \ufb01nd success in winning souls. As you\nwork for God in humility and lowliness of heart, He will manifest Himself to\nyou.\nTheatrical Devices\nBy the use of charts, symbols, and representations of various kinds, the\nminister can make the truth stand out clearly and distinctly. This is a help,\nand in harmony with the word of God. But when the\n355\nworker makes his labors so expensive that others are unable to secure from\nthe treasury suf\ufb01cient means to support them in the \ufb01eld, he is not working in\nharmony with God\u2019s plan.\nThe work in the large cities is to be done after Christ\u2019s order, not after\nthe order of a theatrical performance. It is not a theatrical performance that\nglori\ufb01es God, but the presentation of the truth in the love of Christ.\nPreliminaries\nDo not divest the truth of its dignity and impressiveness by preliminaries\nthat are more after the order of the world than after the order of heaven. Let\nyour hearers understand that you hold meetings, not to charm their senses\nwith music and other things, but to preach the truth in all its solemnity, that\nit may come to them as a warning, arousing them from their death-like sleep\nof self-indulgence. It is the naked truth that like a sharp, two-edged sword\ncuts both ways. It is this that will arouse those who are dead in trespasses and\nsins.\nHe who gave His life to save men and women from idolatry and\nself-indulgence, left an example to be followed by all who take up the work\nof presenting the gospel to others. God\u2019s servants in this age have been given\nmost solemn truths to proclaim, and their actions and methods and plans must\ncorrespond to the importance of their message. If you are presenting the word\nin Christ\u2019s way, your audience will be deeply impressed with the truths you\nteach. The conviction will come to them that this is the word of the living\nGod.\n356\nFormality in Worship\nIn their efforts to reach the people, the Lord\u2019s messengers are not to follow\nthe ways of the world. In the meetings that are held, they are not to depend on\nworldly singers and theatrical display to awaken an interest. How can those\nwho have no interest in the word of God, who have never read His word with\na sincere desire to understand its truths, be expected to sing with the spirit\nand the understanding? How can their hearts be in harmony with the words\nof sacred song? How can the heavenly choir join in music that is only a form?\nThe evil of formal worship cannot be too strongly depicted, but no words\ncan properly set forth the deep blessedness of genuine worship. When human\nbeings sing with the spirit and the understanding, heavenly musicians take up\nthe strain, and join in the song of thanksgiving. He who has bestowed upon\nus all the gifts that enable us to be workers together with God, expects His\nservants to cultivate their voices, so that they can speak and sing in a way that\nall can understand. It is not loud singing that is needed, but clear intonation,\ncorrect pronunciation, and distinct utterance. Let all take time to cultivate the\nvoice, so that God\u2019s praise can be sung in clear, soft tones, not with harshness\nand shrillness that offend the ear. The ability to sing is the gift of God; let it\nbe used to His glory.\nIn the meetings held, let a number be chosen to take part in the song\nservice. And let the singing be accompanied with musical instruments\nskilfully handled. We are not to oppose the use of instruments of music in\nour work. This part of the service is to\n357\nbe carefully conducted; for it is the praise of God in song. The singing is not\nalways to be done by a few. As often as possible, let the entire congregation\njoin....\nHolding to the Af\ufb01rmative\nOften, as you seek to present the truth, opposition will be aroused; but\nif you seek to meet the opposition with argument, you will only multiply\nit, and this you cannot afford to do. Hold to the af\ufb01rmative. Angels of\nGod are watching you, and they understand how to impress those whose\nopposition you refuse to meet with arguments. Dwell not on the negative\npoints of questions that arise, but gather to your minds af\ufb01rmative truths,\nand fasten them there by much study, earnest prayer, and heart consecration.\nKeep your lamps trimmed and burning, and let bright rays shine forth, that\nmen, beholding your good works, may be led to glorify your Father who is in\nheaven.\nIf Christ had not held to the af\ufb01rmative in the wilderness of temptation,\nHe would have lost all that He desired to gain. Christ\u2019s way is the best way\nto meet our opponents. We strengthen their arguments when we repeat what\nthey say. Keep always to the af\ufb01rmative. It may be that the very man who is\nopposing you will carry your words home, and be converted to the sensible\ntruth that has reached his understanding.\nI have often said to our brethren: Your opponents will make statements\nabout your work that are false. Do not repeat their statements, but hold to\nyour assertions of the living truth; and angels of God\n358\nwill open the way before you. We have a great work to carry forward, and we\nmust carry it in a sensible way. Let us never get excited, or allow evil feelings\nto arise. Christ did not do this, and He is our example in all things. For\nthe work given us to do we need much more of heavenly, sancti\ufb01ed, humble\nwisdom, and much less of self. We need to lay hold \ufb01rmly on divine power.\nThose who have departed from the faith will come to our congregations\nto divert our attention from the work that God would have done. You cannot\nafford to turn your ears from the truth to fables. Do not stop to try to convert\nthe one who is speaking words of reproach against your work, but let it be\nseen that you are inspired by the Spirit of Jesus Christ; and angels of God\nwill put into your lips words that will reach the hearts of the opposers. If\nthese men persist in pressing their way in, those who are of a sensible mind in\nthe congregation will understand that yours is the higher standard. So speak\nthat it will be known that Jesus Christ is speaking through you.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church9:137-149. *****\nThere are those who have a special gift of song, and there are times when\na special message is borne by one singing alone, or by several uniting in\nsong. But the singing is seldom to be done by a few. The ability to sing is a\ntalent of in\ufb02uence, which God desires all to cultivate and use to His name\u2019s\nglory.\u2014 \u201cTestimonies for the Church,\u201d V ol. VII, pages 115, 116.\n359\nMedical Missionary Work in Cities\nMedical missionary evangelistic work should be carried forward in a most\nprudent and thorough manner. The solemn, sacred work of saving souls is to\nadvance in a way that is modest, and yet elevated. Where are the working\nforces? Men and women who are thoroughly converted, men and women\nof discernment and keen foresight, should act as directors. Good judgment\nmust be exercised in employing persons to do this special work,\u2014persons\nwho love God and who walk before Him in all humility, persons who will be\neffective agencies in God\u2019s hand for the accomplishment of the object He has\nin view,\u2014the uplifting and saving of human beings.\nMedical missionary evangelists will be able to do excellent pioneer\nwork. The work of the minister should blend fully with that of the medical\nmissionary evangelist. The Christian physician should regard his work as\nexalted as that of the ministry. He bears a double responsibility; for in him\nare combined the quali\ufb01cations of both physician and gospel minister. His is\na grand, a sacred, and a very necessary work.\nThe physician and the minister should realize that they are engaged in\nthe same work. They should labor in perfect harmony. They should counsel\ntogether. By their unity they will bear witness that God has sent His only\nbegotten Son into the world to save all who will believe in Him as their\npersonal Saviour.\n360\nPhysicians whose professional abilities are above those of the ordinary\ndoctor, should engage in the service of God in the large cities. They\nshould seek to reach the higher classes.... Medical missionaries who labor in\nevangelistic lines are doing a work of as high an order as are their ministerial\nfellow-laborers. The efforts put forth by these workers are not to be limited\nto the poorer classes. The higher classes have been strangely neglected. In\nthe higher walks of life will be found many who will respond to the truth,\nbecause it is consistent, because it bears the stamp of the high character of\nthe gospel. Not a few of the men of ability thus won to the cause will enter\nenergetically into the Lord\u2019s work.\nThe Lord calls upon those who are in positions of trust, those to whom He\nhas entrusted His precious gifts, to use their talents of intellect and means in\nHis service. Our workers should present before these men a plain statement\nof our plan of labor, telling them what we need in order to help the poor\nand needy and to establish this work on a \ufb01rm basis. Some of these will\nbe impressed by the Holy Spirit to invest the Lord\u2019s means in a way that will\nadvance His cause. They will ful\ufb01l His purpose by helping to create centers of\nin\ufb02uence in the large cities. Interested workers will be led to offer themselves\nfor various lines of missionary effort.\nThe Health Work\nHygienic restaurants will be established. But with what carefulness\nshould this work be done! Every hygienic restaurant should be a school.\nThe workers connected with it should be constantly studying\n361\nand experimenting, that they may make improvements in the preparation of\nhealthful foods.\nIn the cities this work of instruction may be carried forward on a much\nlarger scale than in smaller places. But in every place where there is a church,\ninstruction should be given in regard to the preparation of simple, wholesome\nfoods for the use of those who wish to live in accordance with the principles\nof health. And the church-members should impart to the people of their\nneighborhoods the light they receive on this subject....\nCooking-schools are to be established in many places. This work may\nbegin in a humble way, but as intelligent cooks do their best to enlighten\nothers, the Lord will give them skill and understanding. The word of\nthe Lord is, \u201cForbid them not; for I will reveal Myself to them as their\nInstructor.\u201d God will work with those who carry out His plans, teaching the\npeople how to bring about a reformation in their diet by the preparation of\nhealthful, inexpensive foods. Thus the poor will be encouraged to adopt the\nprinciples of health reform. And they will be helped to become industrious\nand self-reliant.\nIt has been presented to me that men and women of capability were being\ntaught of God how to prepare wholesome, palatable foods in an acceptable\nmanner. Many of these were young, and there were also those of mature age.\nI have been instructed to encourage the conducting of cooking-schools in all\nplaces where medical missionary work is being done. Every inducement to\nlead the people to reform must be held out before them. Let as much light as\npossible shine upon them. Teach them to make every improvement\n362\nthat they can in the preparation of food, and encourage them to impart to\nothers that which they learn....\nFrom the record of the Lord\u2019s miracles in providing wine at the\nwedding feast and in feeding the multitude, we may learn a lesson of the\nhighest importance. The health-food business is one of the Lord\u2019s own\ninstrumentalities to supply a necessity. The heavenly Provider of all foods\nwill not leave His people in ignorance in regard to the preparation of the best\nfoods for all times and occasions.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church,\u201d V ol. VII,\npages 110-114. *****\nChrist\u2019s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The\nSaviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His\nsympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their con\ufb01dence. Then\nHe bade them, \u201cFollow Me.\u201d\nThere is need of coming close to the people by personal effort. If less time\nwere given to sermonizing, and more time were spent in personal ministry,\ngreater results would be seen. The poor are to be relieved, the sick cared\nfor, the sorrowing and the bereaved comforted, the ignorant instructed, the\ninexperienced counseled. We are to weep with those that weep, and rejoice\nwith those that rejoice. Accompanied by the power of persuasion, the power\nof prayer, the power of the love of God, this work will not, cannot, be without\nfruit.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 143, 144.\n363\nThe City Mission Training-School\nOf equal importance with public effort is house-to-house work in the\nhomes of the people. In large cities there are certain classes who cannot\nbe reached by public meetings. These must be searched out as the shepherd\nsearches for his lost sheep. Diligent personal effort must be put forth in their\nbehalf. When personal work is neglected, many precious opportunities are\nlost, which, were they improved, would advance the work decidedly.\nAgain, as the result of the presentation of truth in large congregations, a\nspirit of inquiry is awakened, and it is especially important that this interest\nbe followed by personal labor. Those who desire to investigate the truth need\nto be taught to study diligently the word of God. Some one must help them to\nbuild on a sure foundation. At this critical time in their religious experience,\nhow important it is that wisely directed Bible-workers come to their help, and\nopen to their understanding the treasure-house of God\u2019s word!\nA well-balanced work can be carried on best in the cities when a Bible\nschool for the training of workers is in progress while public meetings are\nbeing held. Connected with this training-school or city mission should\nbe experienced laborers of deep spiritual understanding, who can give the\nBible-workers daily instruction, and who can also unite whole-heartedly in\nthe general public effort. And as men and women are converted to the truth,\nthose standing at the head of the mission should, with much prayer, show\nthese new\n364\nconverts how to experience the power of the truth in their hearts. Such a\nmission, if conducted by those who know how to manage wisely, will be a\nlight shining in a dark place.\nMissions are essential as the foundation of missionary effort in our cities;\nbut let it never be forgotten that those standing at the head of them are to guard\nevery point, that all may be done to the honor of God. In these missions young\nmen and women are to receive a training that will qualify them to work for\nthe Master. But if they do not possess solidity of character and a spirit of\nconsecration, all effort to \ufb01t them for the work will prove a failure. Without\na high sense of propriety, of sobriety, of the sacredness of the truth and the\nexalted character of the work, they cannot succeed. The same is true of the\nolder workers. Unless they are sancti\ufb01ed by the truth, they cannot give those\nunder their charge an education that will elevate, ennoble, and re\ufb01ne them.\nOur missions must be kept free from all wrong practices, all coarseness,\nall carelessness. Everything connected with them should be above reproach.\nEvery one who has any part to act in them should be an example to\nbelievers. There is need that many moments be spent in secret prayer, in close\ncommunion with God. Thus only can victories be won. Every arrangement\nof the mission should be such as to garrison the soul against yielding to\ntemptation. Every unholy passion must be kept under the control of sancti\ufb01ed\nreason, through the grace abundantly bestowed by God.\nWhen a man who is counted worthy to \ufb01ll a position of trust in one of our\ninstitutions or in a mission,\n365\nbetrays his trust and gives himself into the hands of Satan as an instrument of\nunrighteousness, to sow the seeds of evil, he is a traitor of the worst type.\nFrom one such tainted, polluted mind the youth often receive the impure\nthoughts that lead to a life of shame and de\ufb01lement.\nThe men and women at the head of a mission need close connection with\nGod, in order to keep themselves pure and to know how to manage the youth\ndiscreetly, so that the thoughts of all shall be untainted, uncorrupted. Let\nthe lessons given be of an elevated, ennobling character, that the mind may\nbe \ufb01lled with pure, Christlike thoughts. \u201cEvery man that hath this hope in\nhim puri\ufb01eth himself, even as He is pure.\u201d [John 3:3.] As God is pure in\nHis sphere, so man is to be pure in his. And he will be pure if Christ is\nformed within, the hope of glory; for he will imitate Christ\u2019s life and re\ufb02ect\nHis character. *****\nWhen a mission is established in a city, our people should take an interest\nin it, showing this interest in a practical, substantial way. The mission workers\nlabor hard and self-sacri\ufb01cingly, and they do not receive large wages. Let not\nour people think that the conducting of city missions is an easy work, or one\nthat brings \ufb01nancial pro\ufb01t. Often the missions are carried on with no means\nin sight, by men and women who from day to day beseech God to send them\nmeans with which to advance the work.\n366\nThoroughness\nA solemn responsibility rests upon the ministers of Christ to do their\nwork with thoroughness. They should lead young disciples along wisely and\njudiciously, step by step, onward and upward, until every essential point has\nbeen brought before them. Nothing should be kept back. But not all points of\ntruth should be given in the \ufb01rst few meetings. Gradually, cautiously, his own\nheart imbued with the Spirit of God, the teacher should give his hearers meat\nin due season.\nMinisters should not feel that their work is \ufb01nished until those who have\naccepted the theory of the truth realize indeed the in\ufb02uence of its sanctifying\npower, and are truly converted. When the word of God, as a sharp, two-edged\nsword, cuts its way to the heart and arouses the conscience, many suppose\nthat this is enough; but the work is only begun. Good impressions have been\nmade, but unless these impressions are deepened by careful, prayerful effort,\nSatan will counteract them. Let not the laborers rest content with what has\nbeen done. The plowshare of truth must go deeper, and this it will surely do if\nthorough efforts are made to direct the thoughts and establish the convictions\nof those who are studying the truth.\nToo often the work is left in an un\ufb01nished state, and in many such cases\nit amounts to nothing. Sometimes, after a company of people has accepted\nthe truth, the minister thinks that he must immediately go to a new \ufb01eld; and\nsometimes, without proper\n367\ninvestigation, he is authorized to go. This is wrong; he should \ufb01nish the work\nbegun; for in leaving it incomplete, more harm than good is done. No \ufb01eld is\nso unpromising as one that has been cultivated just enough to give the weeds a\nmore luxuriant growth. By this method of labor many souls have been left to\nthe buffeting of Satan and the opposition of members of other churches who\nhave rejected the truth; and many are driven where they can never again be\nreached. A minister might better not engage in the work unless he can bind it\noff thoroughly.\nUpon all new converts should be impressed the truth that abiding\nknowledge can be gained only by earnest labor and persevering study. As\na rule, those who are converted to the truth we preach have not previously\nbeen diligent students of the Scriptures; for in the popular churches there is\nlittle real study of the word of God. The people look to the ministers to search\nthe Scriptures for them and to explain what they teach.\nMany accept the truth without digging down deep to understand its\nfoundation principles; and when it is opposed, they forget the arguments and\nevidences that sustain it. They have been led to believe the truth, but have\nnot been fully instructed as to what truth is, or carried forward from point\nto point in the knowledge of Christ. Too often their piety degenerates into a\nform, and when the appeals that \ufb01rst aroused them are no longer heard, they\nbecome spiritually dead. Unless those who receive the truth are thoroughly\nconverted, unless there is a radical change in the life and character, unless the\nsoul is riveted to the eternal Rock, they will not endure the\n368\ntest of trial. After the minister leaves and the novelty has worn off, the truth\nloses its power to charm, and they exert no holier in\ufb02uence than before.\nGod\u2019s work is not to be done in a bungling, slip-shod manner. When\na minister enters a \ufb01eld, he should work that \ufb01eld thoroughly. He should\nnot be satis\ufb01ed with his success until he can, through earnest labor and the\nblessing of Heaven, present to the Lord converts who have a true sense of\ntheir responsibility, and who will do their appointed work. If he has properly\ninstructed those under his care, when he leaves for other \ufb01elds of labor the\nwork will not ravel out; it will be bound off so \ufb01rmly as to be secure.\nThe minister has no sanction for con\ufb01ning his labors to the pulpit, leaving\nhis hearers unhelped by personal effort. He should seek to understand the\nnature of the dif\ufb01culties in the minds of the people. He should talk and pray\nwith those who are interested, giving them wise instruction, to the end that\nhe \u201cmay present every man perfect in Christ.\u201d [Colossians 1:28.] His Bible\nteaching should have a directness and force that will send conviction home to\nthe conscience. The people know so little of the Bible that practical, de\ufb01nite\nlessons should be given concerning the nature of sin and its remedy.\nA laborer should never leave some portion of the work undone because\nit is not agreeable to perform, thinking that the minister coming next will do\nit for him. When this is the case, if a second minister follows the \ufb01rst, and\npresents the claims that God has upon His people, some draw back, saying,\n\u201cThe minister who brought us the truth did not mention\n369\nthese things.\u201d And they become offended because of the word. Some refuse\nto accept the tithing system; they turn away, and no longer walk with those\nwho believe and love the truth. When other lines are opened before them, they\nanswer, \u201cIt was not so taught us,\u201d and they hesitate to move forward. How\nmuch better it would have been if the \ufb01rst messenger of truth had faithfully\nand thoroughly educated these converts in regard to all essential matters, even\nif fewer had been added to the church under his labors. God would be better\npleased to have six thoroughly converted to the truth than to have sixty make\na profession and yet not be truly converted.\nIt is part of the minister\u2019s work to teach those who accept the truth through\nhis efforts, to bring the tithe to the storehouse, as an acknowledgment of their\ndependence upon God. The new converts should be fully enlightened as to\ntheir duty to return to the Lord His own. The command to pay tithe is so plain\nthat there is no semblance of excuse for disregarding it. He who neglects\nto give instruction on this point, leaves undone a most important part of his\nwork.\nMinisters must also impress upon the people the importance of bearing\nother burdens in connection with the work of God. No one is exempt from\nthe work of benevolence. The people must be taught that every department\nof the cause of God should enlist their support and engage their interest. The\ngreat missionary \ufb01eld is open before us, and this subject must be agitated,\nagitated, again and again. The people must be made to understand that it is\nnot the hearers, but the doers of the Word, who will gain eternal life. And\nthey are to be taught also that those\n370\nwho become partakers of the grace of Christ are not only to communicate of\ntheir substance for the advancement of the truth, but are to give themselves to\nGod without reserve.\nSome ministers are easily diverted from their work. They become\ndiscouraged, or are drawn away by their home ties, and leave a growing\ninterest to die for want of attention. The loss sustained by the cause in this\nway can scarcely be estimated. When an effort to proclaim the truth is made,\nthe minister in charge should feel responsible to act his part in faithfully\ncarrying it forward. If his labors appear to be without result, he should seek\nby earnest prayer to discover if they are what they should be. He should\nhumble his soul before God in self-examination, and by faith cling to the\ndivine promises, humbly continuing his efforts till he is satis\ufb01ed that he has\nfaithfully discharged his duty, and done everything in his power to gain the\ndesired result. *****\nGod does not accept the most splendid service unless self is laid upon the\naltar, a living, consuming sacri\ufb01ce. The root must be holy, else there can be\nno sound, healthy fruit, which alone is acceptable to God.... While worldly\nambitions, worldly projects, and the greatest plans and purposes of men, will\nperish like the grass, \u201cthey that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the\n\ufb01rmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and\never.\u201d [Daniel 12:3.]\u2014 \u201cTestimonies for the Church,\u201d V ol. VII, pages 248,\n249.\n371\nMeeting Opposition\nOur ministers and teachers are to represent the love of God to a fallen\nworld. With hearts melted in tenderness let the word of truth be spoken. Let\nall who are in error be treated with the gentleness of Christ. If those for whom\nyou labor do not immediately grasp the truth, do not censure, do not criticize\nor condemn. Remember that you are to represent Christ in His meekness and\ngentleness and love.\nWe must expect to meet unbelief and opposition. The truth has always\nhad to contend with these elements. But though you should meet the bitterest\nopposition, do not denounce your opponents. They may think, as did Paul,\nthat they are doing God service; and to such we must manifest patience,\nmeekness, and long-suffering.\nLet us not feel that we have heavy trials to bear, severe con\ufb02icts to\nendure, in representing unpopular truth. Think of Jesus and what He has\nsuffered for you, and be silent. Even when abused and falsely accused, make\nno complaint; speak no word of murmuring; let no thought of reproach or\ndiscontent enter your mind. Take a straightforward course, \u201chaving your\nconversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against\nyou as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold,\nglorify God in the day of visitation.\u201d [1 Peter 2:12.]\nYou should conduct yourself with meekness toward those who are in error,\nfor were not you yourself recently in blindness in your sins? And because of\n372\nthe patience of Christ toward you, should you not be tender and patient toward\nothers? God has given us many admonitions to manifest great kindness\ntoward those who oppose us, lest we in\ufb02uence a soul in the wrong direction.\nOur life must be hid with Christ in God. We must know Christ personally.\nThen only can we rightly represent Him to the world. Let the prayer\nconstantly ascend, \u201cLord, teach me how to do as Jesus would do, were He\nin my place.\u201d Wherever we are, we must let our light shine forth to the glory\nof God in good works. This is the great, important interest of our life. *****\nWisdom in Condemning Wrong\nThe Lord wants His people to follow other methods than that of\ncondemning wrong, even though the condemnation is just. He wants us to\ndo something more than to hurl at our adversaries charges that only drive\nthem farther from the truth. The work which Christ came to do in our world\nwas not to erect barriers, and constantly thrust upon the people the fact that\nthey were wrong. He who expects to enlighten a deceived people must come\nnear to them and labor for them in love. He must become a center of holy\nin\ufb02uence.\nIn the advocacy of truth the bitterest opponents should be treated with\nrespect and deference. Some will not respond to our efforts, but will make\nlight of the gospel invitation. Others, even those whom we suppose to have\npassed the boundary of God\u2019s mercy, will be won to Christ. The very last\nwork in the\n373\ncontroversy may be the enlightenment of those who have not rejected light\nand evidence, but who have been in midnight darkness, and have in ignorance\nworked against the truth. Therefore treat every man as honest. Speak no word,\ndo no deed, that will con\ufb01rm any in unbelief.\nIf any one shall seek to draw the workers into debate or controversy on\npolitical or other questions, take no heed to either persuasion or challenge.\nCarry forward the work of God \ufb01rmly and strongly, but in the meekness of\nChrist, and as quietly as possible. Let no human boasting be heard. Let no\nsign of self-suf\ufb01ciency be made. Let it be seen that God has called us to\nhandle sacred trusts; preach the word, be diligent, earnest, and fervent. *****\nThe in\ufb02uence of your teaching would be tenfold greater if you were\ncareful of your words. Words that should be a savor of life unto life may\nby the spirit which accompanies them be made a savor of death unto death.\nAnd remember that if by your spirit or your words you close the door to even\none soul, that soul will confront you in the judgment.\nDo not, when referring to the Testimonies, feel it your duty to drive them\nhome. In reading them, be sure not to mix in your \ufb01lling of words; for this\nmakes it impossible for the hearers to distinguish between the word of the\nLord to them and your words. Be sure that you do not make the word of the\nLord offensive.\nWe long to see reforms; and because we do not see that which we desire,\nan evil spirit is too often allowed to cast drops of gall into our cup, and thus\n374\nothers are embittered. By our ill-advised words their spirit is chafed, and they\nare stirred to rebellion.\nEvery sermon you preach, every article you write, may be all true; but\none drop of gall in it will be poison to the hearer or the reader. Because of\nthat drop of poison, one will discard all your good and acceptable words.\nAnother will feed on the poison; for he loves such harsh words. He follows\nyour example, and talks just as you talk. Thus the evil is multiplied.\nThose who present the eternal principles of truth need the holy oil emptied\nfrom the two olive branches into the heart. This will \ufb02ow forth in words that\nwill reform but not exasperate. The truth is to be spoken in love. Then the\nLord Jesus by His Spirit will supply the force and the power. That is His\nwork.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:120-123. *****\nHow to Deal with Objections\nTime and strength can be better employed than in dwelling at length upon\nthe quibbles of our opponents who deal in slander and misrepresentation.\nWhile precious time is employed in following the crooks and turns of\ndishonest opponents, the people who are open to conviction are dying for\nwant of knowledge. A train of senseless quibbles of Satan\u2019s own invention is\nbrought before minds, while the people are crying for food\u2014for meat in due\nseason.\nIt takes those who have trained their minds to war against the truth, to\nmanufacture quibbles. And we are not wise to take them from their hands,\nand pass them out to thousands who would never have thought of them had\nwe not published them to the world.\n375\nThe plan of Christ\u2019s teaching should be ours. He was plain and simple,\nstriking directly at the root of the matter, and the minds of all were met. It\nis not the best policy to be so very explicit, and say all upon a point that can\nbe said, when a few arguments will cover the ground, and be suf\ufb01cient for all\npractical purposes, to convince or silence opponents.\nYou may remove every prop today, and close the mouths of objectors so\nthat they can say nothing, and tomorrow they will go over the same ground\nagain. Thus it will be, over and over, because they do not love the truth, and\nwill not come to the light, lest their darkness and error should be removed\nfrom them.\nChrist\u2019s ministry lasted only three years, but a great work was done in that\nshort period. In these last days there is a great work to be done in a short time.\nWhile many are getting ready to do something, souls will perish for lack of\nlight and knowledge.\nIf men who are engaged in presenting and defending the truth of the\nBible, undertake to investigate and show the fallacy and inconsistency of men\nwho dishonestly turn the truth of God into a lie, Satan will stir up opponents\nenough to keep their pens constantly employed, while other branches of the\nwork will be left to suffer. We must have more of the spirit of those men who\nwere engaged in building the walls of Jerusalem. We are doing a great work,\nand cannot come down. If Satan can keep men answering the objections of\nopponents, thus hindering them from doing the most important work for the\npresent time, his object is accomplished.\n376\nDiscussions not to be Sought\n[From a personal testimony.]\nYoung preachers should avoid discussions, for these do not increase\nspirituality or humbleness of mind. In some cases, it may be necessary to\nmeet a proud boaster against the truth of God in open debate; but generally\nthese discussions, either oral or written, result in more harm than good. After\na discussion, the greater responsibility rests upon the minister to keep up the\ninterest. He should beware of the reaction which is liable to take place after a\nreligious excitement, and not yield to discouragement....\nGenerally, the in\ufb02uence of discussions upon our ministers is to make them\nself-suf\ufb01cient, exalted in their own estimation. This is not all. Those who love\nto debate are un\ufb01tted for being pastors to the \ufb02ock. They have trained their\nminds to meet opponents, and to say sarcastic things; and they cannot come\ndown to meet hearts that are sorrowing, and that need to be comforted....\nIn the presentation of unpopular truth, which involves a heavy cross,\npreachers should be careful that every word is as God would have it. Their\nwords should never cut. They should present the truth in humility, with the\ndeepest love for souls, and an earnest desire for their salvation, and let the\ntruth cut.\u2014 \u201cTestimonies for the Church,\u201d V ol. III, pages 213-218. *****\nDiscussions cannot always be avoided.... People who love to see\nopponents combat, may clamor\n377\nfor discussion. Others, who have a desire to hear the evidences on both sides,\nmay urge discussion in all honesty of motive; but whenever discussions can\nbe avoided, they should be. They generally strengthen combativeness, and\nweaken that pure love and sacred sympathy which should ever exist in the\nhearts of Christians, although they may differ in opinion.\nIn this age of the world a demand for a discussion is not real evidence of\nearnest desire on the part of the people to investigate the truth, but comes\nthrough the love of novelty and the excitement which generally attends\ndiscussions. God is seldom glori\ufb01ed or the truth advanced in these combats.\nTruth is too solemn, too momentous in its results, to make it a small matter\nwhether it is received or rejected. To discuss truth for the sake of showing\nopponents the skill of the combatants, is ever poor policy; for it does very\nlittle to advance the truth.\nOpponents of the truth will show skill in misstating the positions of its\ndefenders.... They will generally deride sacred truth, and place it in so false\na light before the people that minds that are darkened by error and polluted\nby sin, do not discern the motives and objects of these designing men in thus\ncovering up and falsifying important truth. Because of the men who engage\nin them, there are few discussions that it is possible to conduct upon right\nprinciples. Sharp thrusts are too frequently given, personalities are indulged\nin, and often both parties descend to sarcasm and witticism. The love of souls\nis lost in the greater desire for the mastery. Prejudice, deep and bitter, is often\nthe result....\n378\nMany choose darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil.\nBut there are those who, if the truth had been presented in a different\nmanner, under different circumstances, giving them a fair chance to weigh\nthe arguments for themselves, and to compare scripture with scripture, would\nhave been charmed by its clearness, and would have taken hold of it.\nIt has been very indiscreet for our ministers to publish to the world the\nwily sophistry of error, furnished by designing men to cover up and make\nof no effect the solemn, sacred truth of Jehovah. These crafty men who lie\nin wait to deceive the unwary, give their strength of intellect to perverting\nthe word of God. The inexperienced and unsuspecting are deceived to their\nruin. It has been a great error to publish to all the arguments wherewith\nopponents battle against the truth of God; for in so doing minds of every\nclass are furnished with arguments which many of them had never thought\nof. Some one must render an account for this unwise generalship.\nArguments against the sacred truth, subtle in their in\ufb02uence, affect minds\nthat are not well informed in regard to the strength of the truth. The moral\nsensibilities of the community at large are blunted by familiarity with sin.\nSel\ufb01shness, dishonesty, and the varied sins which prevail in this degenerate\nage, have blunted the senses to eternal things, so that God\u2019s truth is not\ndiscerned. In giving publicity to the erroneous arguments of our opponents,\ntruth and error are placed upon a level in the minds of the people, when, if\nthey could have the truth before them in its clearness long enough to see and\nrealize its sacredness and importance, they would be convinced of the\n379\nstrong arguments in its favor, and would then be prepared to meet the\narguments urged by opposers.\nThose who are seeking to know the truth and to understand the will of\nGod, who are faithful to the light, and zealous in the performance of their\ndaily duties, will surely know of the doctrine; for they will be guided into all\ntruth.\u2014 \u201cTestimonies for the Church,\u201d V ol. III, pages 424-427. *****\nWhenever it is necessary for the advancement of the cause of truth and the\nglory of God, that an opponent be met, how carefully, and with what humility\nshould they [the advocates of truth] go into the con\ufb02ict. With heart-searching,\nconfession of sin, and earnest prayer, and often fasting for a time, they should\nentreat that God would especially help them, and give His saving, precious\ntruth a glorious victory, that error might appear in its true deformity, and its\nadvocates be completely discom\ufb01ted....\nNever should you enter upon a discussion, where so much is at stake,\nrelying upon your aptness to handle strong arguments. If it cannot be well\navoided, enter the con\ufb02ict, but enter upon it with \ufb01rm trust in God, and in the\nspirit of humility, in the spirit of Jesus, who has bidden you learn of Him who\nis meek and lowly in heart.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church1:624-626.\n380\nDefective Methods\nThere are many men of good minds, intelligent in regard to the Scriptures,\nwhose usefulness is greatly hindered by their defective method of labor. Some\nwho engage in the work of saving souls, fail to secure the best results because\nthey do not carry out with thoroughness the work that they began with much\nenthusiasm. Others cling tenaciously to preconceived notions, making these\nprominent, and thereby fail to conform their teaching to the actual needs\nof the people. Many do not realize the necessity of adapting themselves to\ncircumstances, and meeting the people where they are. They do not identify\nthemselves with those whom they wish to help to reach the Bible standard\nof Christianity. Some fail of success because they trust to the strength of\nargument alone, and do not cry earnestly to God for His wisdom to direct\nthem and His grace to sanctify their efforts.\nMinisters should be careful not to expect too much from those who are\nstill groping in the darkness of error. They should do their work well, relying\nupon God to impart to inquiring minds the mysterious, quickening in\ufb02uence\nof His Holy Spirit, knowing that without this their labors will be unsuccessful.\nThey should be patient and wise in dealing with minds, remembering how\nmanifold are the circumstances that have developed such different traits in\nindividuals. They should strictly guard themselves also, lest self get the\nsupremacy, and Jesus be left out of the question.\n381\nSome ministers fail of success because they do not give their undivided\ninterest to the work, when very much depends upon persistent, well-directed\nlabor. They are not true laborers; they do not pursue their work outside of the\npulpit. They shirk the duty of going from house to house and laboring wisely\nin the home circle. They need to cultivate that rare Christian courtesy which\nwould render them kind and considerate toward the souls under their care,\nworking for them with true earnestness and faith, teaching them the way of\nlife. *****\nThere are in the ministry men who gain apparent success by swaying\nminds through human in\ufb02uence. They play upon the feelings at will, making\ntheir hearers weep, and in a few minutes laugh. Under labor of this kind,\nmany are moved by impulse to profess Christ, and there is thought to be\na wonderful revival; but when the test comes, the work does not endure.\nFeelings are stirred, and many are borne along by the tide that seems to be\nsetting heavenward; but in the strong current of temptation they quickly \ufb02oat\nback as driftwood. The laborer is self-deceived, and he misleads his hearers.\n*****\nMinisters should be guarded, lest they thwart the purposes of God by\nplans of their own. Many are in danger of narrowing down the work of God,\nand con\ufb01ning their labor to certain localities, and not cultivating a special\ninterest for the cause in all its various departments.\n382\nThere are some who concentrate their minds upon one subject, to the\nexclusion of others which may be of equal importance. They are one-idea\nmen. All the strength of their being is concentrated upon the subject on which\nthe mind is exercised for the time. This one favorite theme is the burden of\ntheir thoughts and conversation. Every other consideration is lost sight of.\nAll the evidence that has a bearing upon that subject is eagerly appropriated,\nand dwelt upon at so great length that minds are wearied in following them.\n*****\nSome ministers make the mistake of supposing that success depends on\ndrawing a large congregation by outward display, and then delivering the\nmessage of truth in a theatrical style. But this is using common \ufb01re instead\nof the sacred \ufb01re of God\u2019s kindling. The Lord is not glori\ufb01ed by this manner\nof working. Not by startling notices and expensive display is His work to be\ncarried to completion, but by following Christlike methods. \u201cNot by might,\nnor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d [Zechariah 4:6.]\nIt is the naked truth which, like a sharp, two-edged sword, cuts both ways,\narousing to spiritual life those who are dead in trespasses and sins. Men will\nrecognize the gospel when it is brought to them in a way that is in harmony\nwith God\u2019s purposes.\n383\nThe Temperance Work\nOf all who claim to be numbered among the friends of temperance,\nSeventh-day Adventists should stand in the front ranks. For many years a\n\ufb02ood of light concerning the principles of true reform has been shining on our\npathway, and we are accountable before God to let this light shine to others.\nYears ago we regarded the spread of temperance principles as one of our most\nimportant duties. It should be so today. Our schools and sanitariums are to\nreveal the power of the grace of Christ to transform the whole being,\u2014body,\nsoul, and spirit. Our sanitariums and other educational institutions should be\ncenters of light and blessing in the cause of every true reform.\nWe need at this time to show a decided interest in the workers of the\nWoman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union. None who claim to have a part in the\nwork of God, should lose interest in the grand object of this organization in\ntemperance lines. It would be a good thing if at our camp-meetings we should\ninvite the members of the W. C. T. U. to take part in our exercises. This would\nhelp them to become acquainted with the reasons of our faith, and open the\nway for us to unite with them in the temperance work. If we will do this, we\nshall come to see that the temperance question means more than many of us\nhave supposed.\nIn some matters, the workers of the W. C. T. U. are far in advance of our\nleaders. The Lord has in\n384\nthat organization precious souls, who can be a great help to us in our efforts\nto advance the temperance movement. And the education our people have\nhad in Bible truth and in a knowledge of the requirements of the law of\nJehovah, will enable our sisters to impart to these noble temperance advocates\nthat which will be for their spiritual welfare. Thus a union and sympathy\nwill be created where in the past there has sometimes existed prejudice and\nmisunderstanding. I have been surprised as I have seen the indifference of\nsome of our leaders to this organization. We cannot do a better work than\nto unite, so far as we can do so without compromise, with the W. C. T. U.\nworkers.\nWe have a work to do along temperance lines besides that of speaking\nin public. We must present our principles in pamphlets and in our papers.\nWe must use every possible means of arousing our people to their duty to\nget into connection with those who know not the truth. The success we\nhave had in missionary work has been fully proportionate to the self-denying,\nself-sacri\ufb01cing efforts we have made. The Lord alone knows how much we\nmight have accomplished if as a people we had humbled ourselves before\nHim and proclaimed the temperance truth in clear, straight lines.... *****\nA Right Use of the Gifts of Providence\nOur Creator has bestowed His bounties upon man with a liberal hand.\nWere all these gifts of Providence wisely and temperately employed, poverty,\nsickness, and distress would be well-nigh banished\n385\nfrom the earth. But alas, we see on every hand the blessings of God changed\nto a curse by the wickedness of men.\nThere is no class guilty of greater perversion and abuse of His precious\ngifts than are those who employ the products of the soil in the manufacture\nof intoxicating liquors. The nutritive grains, the healthful, delicious fruits,\nare converted into beverages that pervert the senses and madden the brain.\nAs a result of the use of these poisons, thousands of families are deprived of\nthe comforts and even the necessaries of life, acts of violence and crime are\nmultiplied, and disease and death hurry myriads of victims to a drunkard\u2019s\ngrave.\nThis work of destruction is carried on under the protection of the laws of\nthe land! For a paltry sum, men are licensed to deal out to their fellow-men\nthe potion that shall rob them of all that makes this life desirable and of\nall hope of the life to come. Neither the law-maker nor the liquor-seller is\nignorant of the result of his work. At the hotel bar, in the beer-garden, at the\nsaloon, the slave of appetite expends his means for that which is destructive\nto reason, health, and happiness. The liquor-seller \ufb01lls his till with the money\nthat should provide food and clothing for the family of the poor drunkard.\nThis is the worst kind of robbery. Yet men in high positions in society and\nin the church lend their in\ufb02uence in favor of license laws! ...Thus society is\ncorrupted, work-houses and prisons are crowded with paupers and criminals,\nand the gallows is supplied with victims. The evil ends not with the drunkard\nand his unhappy family. The burdens of\n386\ntaxation are increased, the morals of the young are imperiled, the property\nand even the life of every member of society is endangered. But the picture\nmay be presented never so vividly, and yet it falls short of the reality. No\nhuman pen can fully delineate the horrors of intemperance....\nThe Cause of Moral Paralysis\nHow can Christian men and women tolerate this evil? ...There is a cause\nfor the moral paralysis upon society. Our laws sustain an evil which is sapping\ntheir very foundations. Many deplore the wrongs which they know exist, but\nconsider themselves free from all responsibility in the matter. This cannot\nbe. Every individual exerts an in\ufb02uence in society. In our favored land,\nevery voter has some voice in determining what laws shall control the nation.\nShould not that in\ufb02uence and that vote be cast on the side of temperance and\nvirtue? ...\nWe may call upon the friends of the temperance cause to rally to the\ncon\ufb02ict, and seek to press back the tide of evil that is demoralizing the world;\nbut of what avail are all our efforts while liquor-selling is sustained by law?\nMust the curse of intemperance forever rest like a blight upon our land? Must\nit every year sweep like a devouring \ufb01re over thousands of happy homes?\nWe talk of the results, tremble at the results, and wonder what we can\ndo with the terrible results, while too often we tolerate and even sanction the\ncause. The advocates of temperance fail to do their whole duty unless they\nexert their in\ufb02uence by precept and example\u2014by voice and pen and vote\u2014\n387\nin favor of prohibition and total abstinence. We need not expect that God will\nwork a miracle to bring about this reform, and thus remove the necessity for\nour exertion. We ourselves must grapple with this giant foe, our motto, No\ncompromise and no cessation of our efforts till the victory is gained....\nWhat can be done to press back the in\ufb02owing tide of evil? Let laws be\nenacted and rigidly enforced prohibiting the sale and the use of ardent spirits\nas a beverage. Let every effort be made to encourage the inebriate\u2019s return\nto temperance and virtue. But even more than this is needed to banish the\ncurse of inebriety from our land. Let the appetite for intoxicating liquors\nbe removed, and their use and sale is at an end. This work must to a great\ndegree devolve upon parents. Let them, by observing strict temperance\nthemselves, give the right stamp of character to their children, and then\neducate and train these children, in the fear of God, to habits of self-denial\nand self-control. Youth who have been thus trained will have moral stamina\nto resist temptation, and to control appetite and passion. They will stand\nunmoved by the folly and dissipation that are corrupting society.\nThe prosperity of a nation is dependent upon the virtue and intelligence\nof its citizens. To secure these blessings, habits of strict temperance are\nindispensable. The history of ancient kingdoms is replete with lessons of\nwarning for us. Luxury, self-indulgence, and dissipation prepared the way\nfor their downfall. It remains to be seen whether our own republic will be\nadmonished by their example, and avoid their fate.\u2014 The Review and Herald,\nNovember 8, 1881.\n388\nReligious Liberty\nThe principle for which the disciples stood so fearlessly when, in answer\nto the command not to speak any more in the name of Jesus, they declared,\n\u201cWhether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than\nunto God, judge ye,\u201d [Acts 4:19.] is the same that the adherents of the\ngospel struggled to maintain in the days of the Reformation. When in 1529\nthe German princes assembled at the Diet of Spires, there was presented\nthe emperor\u2019s decree restricting religious liberty, and prohibiting all further\ndissemination of the reformed doctrines. It seemed that the hope of the world\nwas about to be crushed out. Would the princes accept the decree? Should the\nlight of the gospel be shut out from the multitudes still in darkness? Mighty\nissues for the world were at stake. Those who had accepted the reformed faith\nmet together, and their unanimous decision was, \u201cLet us reject this decree. In\nmatters of conscience the majority has no power.\u201d [D\u2019Aubigne: \u201cHistory of\nthe Reformation,\u201d Book 13, Chap. 5.]\nThis principle we in our day are \ufb01rmly to maintain. The banner of truth\nand religious liberty held aloft by the founders of the gospel church and by\nGod\u2019s witnesses during the centuries that have passed since then, has, in this\nlast con\ufb02ict, been committed to our hands. The responsibility for this great\ngift rests with those whom God has blessed with a knowledge of His word.\nWe are to receive this word as supreme authority. We are to recognize human\ngovernment\n389\nas an ordinance of divine appointment, and teach obedience to it as a sacred\nduty, within its legitimate sphere. But when its claims con\ufb02ict with the claims\nof God, we must obey God rather than men. God\u2019s word must be recognized\nas above all human legislation. A \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d is not to be set aside\nfor a \u201cThus saith the church\u201d or a \u201cThus saith the state.\u201d The crown of Christ\nis to be lifted above the diadems of earthly potentates.\nWe are not required to defy authorities. Our words, whether spoken or\nwritten, should be carefully considered, lest we place ourselves on record as\nuttering that which would make us appear antagonistic to law and order. We\nare not to say or do anything that would necessarily close up our way. We are\nto go forward in Christ\u2019s name, advocating the truths committed to us. If we\nare forbidden by men to do this work, then we may say, as did the apostles,\n\u201cWhether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto\nGod, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and\nheard.\u201d [Acts 4:19, 20.]\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 68, 69. *****\nLuther\u2019s pen was a power, and his writings, scattered broadcast, stirred\nthe world. The same agencies are at our command, with facilities multiplied\na hundred-fold. Bibles, publications in many languages, setting forth the truth\nfor this time, are at our hand, and can be swiftly carried to all the world. We\nare to give the last warning of God to men, and what should be our earnestness\nin studying the Bible, and our zeal in spreading the light!\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church6:403.\n390\nOur Attitude in Regard to Politics\nTo the Teachers and Managers of our Schools:\n\u2014Those who have charge of our institutions and our schools should\nguard themselves diligently, lest by their words and sentiments they lead the\nstudents into false paths. Those who teach the Bible in our churches and our\nschools are not at liberty to unite in making apparent their prejudices for or\nagainst political men or measures, because by so doing they stir up the minds\nof others, leading each to advocate his favorite theory. There are among those\nprofessing to believe present truth, some who will thus be stirred up to express\ntheir sentiments and political preferences, so that division will be brought into\nthe church.\nThe Lord would have His people bury political questions. On these\nthemes silence is eloquence. Christ calls upon His followers to come into\nunity on the pure gospel principles which are plainly revealed in the word of\nGod. We cannot with safety vote for political parties; for we do not know\nwhom we are voting for. We cannot with safety take part in any political\nscheme. We cannot labor to please men who will use their in\ufb02uence to repress\nreligious liberty, and to set in operation oppressive measures to lead or compel\ntheir fellow-men to keep Sunday as the Sabbath. The \ufb01rst day of the week is\nnot a day to be reverenced. It is a spurious sabbath, and the members of the\nLord\u2019s family cannot participate with the men who exalt this day, and violate\nthe law of\n391\nGod by trampling upon His Sabbath. The people of God are not to vote to\nplace such men in of\ufb01ce; for when they do this, they are partakers with them\nof the sins which they commit while in of\ufb01ce.\nWe are not to compromise principle by yielding to the opinions and\nprejudices which we may have encouraged before we united with God\u2019s\ncommandment-keeping people. We have enlisted in the army of the Lord, and\nwe are not to \ufb01ght on the enemy\u2019s side, but on the side of Christ, where we\ncan be a united whole, in sentiment, in action, in spirit, in fellowship. Those\nwho are Christians indeed will be branches of the true vine, and will bear\nthe same fruit as the vine. They will act in harmony, in Christian fellowship.\nThey will not wear political badges, but the badge of Christ.\nWhat are we to do, then?\u2014Let political questions alone. \u201cBe ye\nnot unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath\nrighteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with\ndarkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he\nthat believeth with an in\ufb01del?\u201d [2 Corinthians 6:14, 15.] What can there be in\ncommon between these parties? There can be no fellowship, no communion.\nThe word \u201cfellowship\u201d means participation, partnership. God employs\nthe strongest \ufb01gures to show that there should be no union between\nworldly parties and those who are seeking the righteousness of Christ.\nWhat communion can there be between light and darkness, truth and\nunrighteousness? None whatever. Light represents righteousness; darkness,\nunrighteousness. Christians have come out of darkness into the\n392\nlight. They have put on Christ, and they wear the badge of truth and\nobedience. They are governed by the elevated and holy principles which\nChrist expressed in His life....\nThose teachers in the church or in the school who distinguish themselves\nby their zeal in politics, should be relieved of their work and responsibilities\nwithout delay; for the Lord will not co-operate with them. The tithe should\nnot be used to pay any one for speechifying on political questions. Every\nteacher, minister, or leader in our ranks who is stirred with a desire to ventilate\nhis opinions on political questions, should be converted by a belief in the\ntruth, or give up his work. His in\ufb02uence must tell as a laborer together with\nGod in winning souls to Christ, or his credentials must be taken from him. If\nhe does not change, he will do harm, and only harm....\n\u201cBe Ye Separate\u201d\nI call upon my brethren who are appointed to educate, to change their\ncourse of action. It is a mistake for you to link your interests with any political\nparty, to cast your vote with them or for them. Those who stand as educators,\nas ministers, as laborers together with God in any line, have no battles to \ufb01ght\nin the political world. Their citizenship is in heaven. The Lord calls upon\nthem to stand as a separate and peculiar people. He would have no schisms in\nthe body of believers. His people are to possess the elements of reconciliation.\nIs it their work to make enemies in the political world?\u2014No, no. They\nare to stand as subjects of Christ\u2019s kingdom, bearing the banner on which is\n393\ninscribed, \u201cThe commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d They are to\ncarry the burden of a special work, a special message. We have a personal\nresponsibility, and this is to be revealed before the heavenly universe, before\nangels, and before men. God does not call upon us to enlarge our in\ufb02uence\nby mingling with society, by linking up with men on political questions, but\nby standing as individual parts of His great whole, with Christ as our head.\nChrist is our Prince, and as His subjects we are to do the work appointed us\nby God....\nThe question may be asked, Are we to have no union whatever with the\nworld? The word of the Lord is to be our guide. Any connection with in\ufb01dels\nand unbelievers that would identify us with them, is forbidden by the Word.\nWe are to come out from among them, and be separate. In no case are we\nto link ourselves with them in their plans of work. But we are not to live\nreclusive lives. We are to do worldlings all the good we possibly can.\nChrist has given us an example of this. When invited to eat with publicans\nand sinners, He did not refuse; for in no other way than by mingling with them\ncould He reach this class. But on every occasion ...He opened up themes of\nconversation which brought things of eternal interest to their minds. And He\nenjoins us, \u201cLet your light so shine before men, that they may see your good\nworks, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d [Matthew 5:16.]\nOn the temperance question, take your position without wavering. Be as\n\ufb01rm as a rock. Be not partakers of other men\u2019s sins....\n394\nThere is a large vineyard to be cultivated; but while Christians are to work\namong unbelievers, they are not to appear like worldlings. They are not to\nspend their time talking politics or acting politics; for by so doing they give\nthe enemy opportunity to come in and cause variance and discord. Those in\nthe ministry who desire to stand as politicians, should have their credentials\ntaken from them; for this work God has not given to high or low among His\npeople.\nGod calls upon all who minister in word and doctrine to give the trumpet\na certain sound. All who have received Christ, ministers and lay members,\nare to arise and shine; for great peril is right upon us. Satan is stirring up the\npowers of earth. Everything in this world is in confusion. God calls upon His\npeople to hold aloft the banner bearing the message of the third angel....\nGod\u2019s children are to separate themselves from politics, from any alliance\nwith unbelievers. They are not to link their interests with the interests of the\nworld. \u201cGive proof of your allegiance to Me,\u201d He says, \u201cby standing as My\nchosen heritage, as a people zealous of good works.\u201d Do not take part in\npolitical strife. Separate from the world, and refrain from bringing into the\nchurch or school ideas that will lead to contention and disorder. Dissension\nis the moral poison taken into the system by human beings who are sel\ufb01sh.\nGod wants His servants to have clear perceptions, true and noble dignity, that\ntheir in\ufb02uence may demonstrate the power of truth.\nThe Christian life is not to be a haphazard, emotional life. True Christian\nin\ufb02uence, exerted for the accomplishment of the work God has appointed, is\na\n395\nprecious agency, and it must not be united with politics, or bound up in a\nconfederacy with unbelievers. God is to be the center of attraction. Every\nmind that is worked by the Holy Spirit will be satis\ufb01ed with Him.\u2014 MS.,\nJune 16, 1899. *****\n\u201cNone of us liveth to himself.\u201d [Romans 14:7.] Let those who are tempted\nto take part in politics, remember that every move they make has its in\ufb02uence\nupon others. When ministers or others in responsible positions make remarks\nin regard to these matters, they cannot gather up the thoughts they have\nplanted in human minds. Under Satan\u2019s temptations they have set in operation\na train of circumstances leading to results of which they little dream. An act,\na word, a thought, cast into the minds of the great concourse of humanity,\nif it bears the heavenly endorsement, will yield a harvest of precious fruit;\nbut if it is inspired by Satan, it will cause the root of bitterness to spring up,\nwhereby many will be de\ufb01led. Then let the stewards of God\u2019s grace in any\nline of service, beware how they mingle the common with the sacred. *****\nAgain and again Christ had been asked to decide legal and political\nquestions; but He refused to interfere in temporal matters.... He stood in\nour world as the Head of the great spiritual kingdom that He came to our\nworld to establish,\u2014the kingdom of righteousness. His teaching made plain\nthe ennobling, sanctifying principles that govern this kingdom. He showed\nthat justice and mercy and love are the controlling powers in Jehovah\u2019s\nkingdom.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:218.\n396\nWork for the Jews\nAt the time when Jerusalem was destroyed and the temple laid in ruins,\nmany thousands of the Jews were sold to serve as bondmen in heathen lands.\nLike wrecks on a desert shore, they were scattered among the nations. For\neighteen hundred years the Jews have wandered from land to land throughout\nthe world, and in no place have they been given the privilege of regaining\ntheir ancient prestige as a nation. Maligned, hated, persecuted, from century\nto century theirs has been a heritage of suffering.\nNotwithstanding the awful doom pronounced upon the Jews as a nation at\nthe time of their rejection of Jesus of Nazareth, there have lived from age to\nage many noble, God-fearing Jewish men and women who have suffered in\nsilence. God has comforted their hearts in af\ufb02iction, and has beheld with pity\ntheir terrible situation. He has heard the agonizing prayers of those who have\nsought Him with all the heart for a right understanding of His word. Some\nhave learned to see in the lowly Nazarene whom their forefathers rejected\nand cruci\ufb01ed, the true Messiah of Israel. As their minds have grasped the\nsigni\ufb01cance of the familiar prophecies so long obscured by tradition and\nmisinterpretation, their hearts have been \ufb01lled with gratitude to God for the\nunspeakable gift He bestows upon every human being who chooses to accept\nChrist as a personal Saviour.\nIt is to this class that Isaiah referred in his prophecy, \u201cA remnant shall be\nsaved.\u201d [See Isaiah 10:20-22.] From Paul\u2019s day\n397\nto the present time, God by His Holy Spirit has been calling after the Jew\nas well as the Gentile. \u201cThere is no respect of persons with God,\u201d [Romans\n2:11] declared Paul. The apostle regarded himself as \u201cdebtor both to the\nGreeks, and to the barbarians,\u201d [Romans 1:14] as well as to the Jews; but\nhe never lost sight of the decided advantages possessed by the Jews over\nothers, \u201cchie\ufb02y, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.\u201d\n[Romans 3:2.] \u201cThe gospel,\u201d he declared, \u201cis the power of God unto salvation\nto every one that believeth; to the Jew \ufb01rst, and also to the Greek. For therein\nis the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The\njust shall live by faith.\u201d [Romans 1:16, 17.] It is of this gospel of Christ,\nequally ef\ufb01cacious for Jew and Gentile, that Paul in his epistle to the Romans\ndeclared he was not ashamed.\nWhen this gospel shall be presented in its fulness to the Jews, many will\naccept Christ as the Messiah. Among Christian ministers there are only a few\nwho feel called upon to labor for the Jewish people; but to those who have\nbeen often passed by, as well as to all others, the message of mercy and hope\nin Christ is to come.\nIn the closing proclamation of the gospel, when special work is to be done\nfor classes of people hitherto neglected, God expects His messengers to take\nparticular interest in the Jewish people whom they \ufb01nd in all parts of the earth.\nAs the Old Testament Scriptures are blended with the New in an explanation\nof Jehovah\u2019s eternal purpose, this will be to many of the Jews as the dawn of\na new creation, the resurrection of the soul. As they see the Christ\n398\nof the gospel dispensation portrayed in the pages of the Old Testament\nScriptures, and perceive how clearly the New Testament explains the Old,\ntheir slumbering faculties will be aroused, and they will recognize Christ as\nthe Saviour of the world. Many will by faith receive Him as their Redeemer.\nTo them will be ful\ufb01lled the words, \u201cAs many as received Him, to them gave\nHe power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.\u201d\n[John 1:12.]\nAmong the Jews are some who, like Saul of Tarsus, are mighty in the\nScriptures, and these will proclaim with wonderful power the immutability of\nthe law of God. The God of Israel will bring this to pass in our day. His arm\nis not shortened that it cannot save. As His servants labor in faith for those\nwho have long been neglected and despised, His salvation will be revealed.\n\u201cThus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house\nof Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax\npale. But when he seeth his children, the work of Mine hands, in the midst\nof him, they shall sanctify My name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,\nand shall fear the God of Israel. They also that erred in spirit shall come\nto understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.\u201d [Isaiah\n29:22-24.]\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 379-382.\n399\nImportance of the Camp-Meeting\nThe camp-meeting is one of the most important agencies in our work. It\nis one of the most effective methods of arresting the attention of the people,\nand reaching all classes with the gospel invitation....\nIf our camp-meetings are conducted as they should be, they will indeed be\na light in the world. They should be held in the large cities and towns where\nthe message of truth has not been proclaimed. And they should continue for\ntwo or three weeks. It may sometimes be advisable to hold a camp-meeting\nfor several successive seasons in the same place; but as a rule the place of\nmeeting should be changed from year to year. Instead of having mammoth\ncamp-meetings in a few localities, more good would be done by having\nsmaller meetings in many places. Thus the work will be constantly extending\ninto new \ufb01elds....\nA mistake has been made in holding camp-meetings in out-of-the-way\nplaces, and in continuing in the same place year after year. This has been\ndone to save expense and labor; but the saving should be made in other lines.\nIn new \ufb01elds especially, a dearth of means often makes if dif\ufb01cult to meet\nthe expense of a camp-meeting. Careful economy should be exercised, and\ninexpensive plans devised; for much can be saved in this way. But let not the\nwork be crippled. This method of presenting the truth to the people is by the\ndevising of our God. When souls are to be labored for, and the truth is to be\nbrought before those who know it not, the work must not be hindered in order\nto save expense....\n400\nSecuring Attendance\nAt one time as we were preparing to hold a camp-meeting near a large\ncity where our people were but little known, I seemed one night to be in an\nassembly met for consultation as to the work to be done before the meeting. It\nwas proposed to make large efforts, and incur heavy expense for distributing\nnotices and papers. Arrangements were being made to do this, when One who\nis wise in counsel said:\n\u201cSet your tents, begin your meetings, then advertise; and more will be\naccomplished. The truth spoken by the living preacher will have greater\nin\ufb02uence than the same matter will have when published in the papers. But\nboth methods combined will have still greater force.\n\u201cIt is not the best plan to follow one line of effort year after year. Change\nthe order of things. When you give time and opportunity, Satan is prepared to\nrally his forces, and he will work to destroy every soul possible.\n\u201cDo not arouse opposition before the people have had opportunity to hear\nthe truth and know what they are opposing. Reserve your means to do a\nstrong work after the meeting rather than before. If a press can be secured\nto be worked during the meeting, printing lea\ufb02ets, notices, and papers for\ndistribution, it will have a telling in\ufb02uence.\u201d\nAt some of our camp-meetings, strong companies of workers have been\norganized to go out into the city and its suburbs to distribute literature\nand invite people to the meetings. By this means hundreds of persons\nwere secured as regular attendants during the last half of the meeting, who\notherwise might have\n401\nthought little about it. We must take every justi\ufb01able means of bringing the\nlight before the people....\nThose who have become interested have to meet sophistry and\nmisrepresentation from popular ministers, and they know not how to answer\nthese things. The truth presented by the living preacher should be published\nin as compact a form as possible, and circulated widely. So far as practicable,\nlet the important discourses given at our camp-meetings be published in the\nnewspapers. Thus the truth which was placed before a limited number may\n\ufb01nd access to many minds. And where the truth has been misrepresented, the\npeople will have an opportunity of knowing just what the minister said....\nBusiness Matters\nAs far as possible, our camp-meetings should be wholly devoted to\nspiritual interests. They should not be made occasions for the transaction\nof business. Workers are gathered from all parts of the \ufb01eld, and it seems\na favorable opportunity for considering business matters connected with the\nvarious branches of the work, and for the training of workers in different lines.\nAll these interests are important, but when they are attended to at a\ncamp-meeting, but little opportunity remains for dealing with the practical\nrelation of truth to the soul. Ministers are diverted from their work of building\nup the children of God in the most holy faith, and the camp-meeting does not\nmeet the end for which it was appointed.\nMany meetings are conducted in which the larger number of the people\nhave no interest; and if they\n402\ncould attend them all, they would go away wearied instead of being refreshed\nand bene\ufb01ted. Many are disappointed at the failure of their expectation to\nreceive help from the camp-meeting. Those who came for enlightenment and\nstrength return to their homes little better \ufb01tted to work in their families and\nchurches than before attending the meeting.\nBusiness matters should be attended to by those specially appointed for\nthis work. And as far as possible they should be brought before the people\nat some other time than the camp-meeting. Instruction in canvassing, in\nSabbath-school work, and in the details of tract and missionary work, should\nbe given in the home churches, or in meetings specially appointed. The same\nprinciple applies to cooking-schools. While these are all right in their place,\nthey should not occupy the time of our camp-meetings.\nThe presidents of conferences and the ministers should give themselves\nto the spiritual interests of the people, and should therefore be excused from\nthe mechanical labor attendant upon the meeting. The ministers should be\nready to act as teachers and leaders in the work of the camp when occasion\nrequires; but they should not be wearied out. They should feel refreshed, and\nbe in a cheerful frame of mind; for this is essential for the best good of the\nmeeting. They should be able to speak words of cheer and courage, and to\ndrop seeds of spiritual truth into the soil of honest hearts.... *****\nThe Training of Young Workers\nThose who are in training for work in the cause in any line, should\nimprove every opportunity to work\n403\nat the camp-meeting. Wherever camp-meetings are held, young men who\nhave received an education in medical lines should feel it their duty to act\na part. They should be encouraged not only to work in medical lines, but\nalso to speak upon the points of present truth, giving the reason why we are\nSeventh-day Adventists. These young men, if given an opportunity to work\nwith older ministers, will receive much help and blessing....\nProperly conducted, the camp-meeting is a school where pastors, elders,\nand deacons can learn to do more perfect work for the Master. It should\nbe a school where the members of the church, old and young, are given\nan opportunity to learn the way of the Lord more perfectly, a place where\nbelievers can receive an education that will help them to help others.... *****\nOne night, previous to an important meeting, I seemed in my sleeping\nhours to be in meeting with my brethren, listening to One who spoke as having\nauthority. He said:\n\u201cMany souls will attend this meeting who are honestly ignorant of the\ntruths that will be presented. They will listen and become interested, because\nChrist is drawing them; conscience tells them that what they hear is true, for\nit has the Bible for its foundation. The greatest care is needed in dealing with\nthese souls.\n\u201cLet such portions of the message be dealt out to them as they may be\nable to grasp and appropriate. Though it should appear strange and startling,\nmany will recognize with joy that new light is shed on the\n404\nword of God; whereas, if new truths were presented in so large a measure\nthat they could not comprehend them, some would go away and never come\nagain. Some, in their efforts to tell it to others, would misrepresent what they\nhad heard. Some would so wrest the Scriptures as to confuse other minds.\n\u201cThose who will study the manner of Christ\u2019s teaching, and educate\nthemselves to follow His way, will attract and hold large numbers now, as\nChrist held the people in His day. At every meeting, Satan will be on the\nground, that he may obtrude his hellish shadow between man and God, to\nintercept every ray of light that might shine on the soul. But when the truth in\nits practical character is urged upon the people because you love them, souls\nwill be convicted, because the Holy Spirit of God will impress their hearts.\n\u201cArm yourselves with humility; pray that angels of God may come close\nto your side to impress the mind; for it is not you that work the Holy Spirit,\nbut the Holy Spirit must work you. It is the Holy Spirit that makes the truth\nimpressive. Keep practical truth ever before the people.\u201d\nDo not make prominent those features of the message which are a\ncondemnation of the customs and practices of the people, until they have\nan opportunity to know that we are believers in Christ, that we believe in His\ndivinity and in His pre-existence. Let the testimony of the world\u2019s Redeemer\nbe dwelt upon. He says, \u201cI Jesus have sent Mine angel to testify unto you\nthese things in the churches.\u201d [Revelation 22:16.] ...\nWhenever practicable, every important discourse should be followed by a\nBible study. Here the points\n405\nthat have been presented can be applied, questions can be asked, and right\nideas inculcated. More time should be devoted to patiently educating the\npeople, giving them opportunity to express themselves. It is instruction that\nmen need, line upon line and precept upon precept.\nSpecial meetings also should be held for those who are becoming\ninterested in the truths presented, and who need instruction. To these meetings\nthe people should be invited, and all, both believers and unbelievers, should\nhave an opportunity to ask questions on points not fully understood. Give all\nan opportunity to speak of their perplexities, for they will have them. In all\nthe sermons and in all the Bible studies, let the people see that on every point\na plain \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d is given for the faith and doctrines which we\nadvocate.\nThis was the method of Christ\u2019s teaching. As He spoke to the people, they\nwould question as to His meaning. To those who were humbly seeking for\nlight, He was always ready to explain His words. But Christ did not encourage\ncriticism or caviling, nor should we. When men try to provoke a discussion of\ncontroverted points of doctrine, tell them that the meeting was not appointed\nfor that purpose. When you do answer a question, be sure to have the hearers\nsee and acknowledge that it is answered. Do not let a question drop, telling\nthem to ask it again. Feel your way step by step, and know how much you\nhave gained.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:31-69.\n406\nLess Preaching, More Teaching\nAt our camp-meetings, one or two laborers should not be required to do\nall the preaching and all the teaching in Bible lines. At times, greater good\ncan be accomplished by breaking up the large congregation into sections.\nThus the educator in Bible truth can come closer to the people than in a large\nassembly.\nThere is much more preaching than there should be at our camp-meetings.\nThis brings a heavy burden upon the ministers, and as a consequence much\nthat requires attention is neglected. Many little things that open the door to\nserious evils are passed by unnoticed. The minister is robbed of physical\nstrength, and deprived of the time he needs for meditation and prayer, in\norder to keep his own soul in the love of God. And when so many discourses\nare crowded in, one after another, the people have no time to appropriate\nwhat they hear. Their minds become confused, and the services seem to them\ntedious and wearisome.\nThere should be less preaching, and more teaching. There are those who\nwant more de\ufb01nite light than they receive from hearing the sermons. Some\nneed a longer time than do others to understand the points presented. If the\ntruth presented could be made a little plainer, they would see it and take hold\nof it, and it would be like a nail fastened in a sure place.\nIt has been shown me that our camp-meetings are to increase in interest\nand success. As we approach the end, I have seen that in these meetings there\nwill\n407\nbe less preaching, and more Bible study. There will be little groups all over\nthe grounds, with their Bibles in their hands, and different ones leading out in\na free, conversational study of the Scriptures.\nThis was the method that Christ taught His disciples. When the great\nthrongs gathered about the Saviour, He would give instruction to the disciples\nand to the multitude. Then after the discourse, the disciples would mingle\nwith the people, and repeat to them what Christ had said. Often the hearers\nhad misapplied Christ\u2019s words, and the disciples would tell them what the\nScriptures said, and what Christ had taught that they said.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church6:87, 88. *****\nThe great Teacher brought His hearers in contact with nature, that they\nmight listen to the voice which speaks in all created things; and as their hearts\nbecame tender and their minds receptive, He helped them to interpret the\nspiritual teaching of the scenes upon which their eyes rested. The parables,\nby means of which He loved to teach lessons of truth, show how open His\nspirit was to the in\ufb02uences of nature, and how He delighted to gather the\nspiritual teaching from the surroundings of daily life. The birds of the air, the\nlilies of the \ufb01eld, the sower and the seed, the shepherd and the sheep,\u2014with\nthese Christ illustrated immortal truth. He drew illustrations also from the\nevents of life, facts of experience familiar to the hearers,\u2014the leaven, the hid\ntreasure, the pearl, the \ufb01shing net, the lost coin, the prodigal son, the houses\non the rock and the sand. In His lessons there was something to interest every\nmind, to appeal to every heart.\u2014 Education, 102.\n408\nSowing and Reaping\n\u201cOne soweth, and another reapeth.\u201d [John 4:37.] The Saviour spoke these\nwords in anticipation of the ordination and sending forth of His disciples.\nThroughout Judea, Christ had been sowing the seeds of truth. Clearly and\ndistinctly He had outlined the plan of salvation; for the truth never languished\non His lips. The earthly work of the great Teacher was soon to close. The\ndisciples were to follow after, reaping where He had sown, that both the\nSower and the reapers might rejoice together.\nToday in His great harvest-\ufb01eld God has need of sowers and of reapers.\nLet those who go forth into the work, some to sow and some to reap,\nremember that they are never to take to themselves the glory for the success\nof their work. God\u2019s appointed agencies have been before them, preparing\nthe way for the sowing of the seed and the reaping of the harvest. \u201cI sent you\nto reap that whereon ye bestowed no labor,\u201d Christ said; \u201cother men labored,\nand ye are entered into their labors.\u201d [John 4:38.]\n\u201cHe that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that\nboth he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.\u201d [John 4:36.]\nRead these words carefully. Study their meaning; for they outline God\u2019s plan.\nThose who sow the seed, presenting before large and small gatherings the\ntesting truth for this time, at the cost of much labor, may not always gather\nthe harvest. Often the Lord\u2019s workers are bitterly opposed, and their work is\nhindered.\n409\nThey do their best; with earnest, painstaking effort they sow the good\nseed. But the element of opposition becomes \ufb01ercer and \ufb01ercer. Some\nof the hearers may be convinced of the truth, but they are intimidated by\nthe opposition shown, and they have not the courage to acknowledge their\nconvictions.\nThe lives of the workers may be endangered by those who are controlled\nby Satan. It is then their privilege to follow the example of their Master, and\ngo to another place. \u201cYe shall not have gone over the cities of Israel,\u201d Christ\nsaid, \u201ctill the Son of man be come.\u201d [Matthew 10:23.] Let the messengers of\ntruth pass on to another \ufb01eld. Here may be a more favorable opportunity for\nwork, and they may successfully sow the seed of truth and reap the harvest.\nThe report of their success will \ufb01nd its way to the place where the work was\napparently unsuccessful, and the next messenger of truth who goes there will\nbe more favorably received.\nThe seed sown in trial and discouragement will be seen to have life and\nvitality. Adversity, sorrow, loss of property, the changes of God\u2019s providence,\nrecall with vivid distinctness the words spoken years before by the faithful\nservant of God. The seed sown springs up and bears fruit.\nGod has need of wise men and women who will labor earnestly to\naccomplish the work committed to them. He will use them as His instruments\nin the conversion of souls. Some will sow, and some will reap the harvest of\nthe seed sown. Let every one do his best to improve his talents, that God may\nuse him either as a sower or as a reaper.\n410\n411\n412\nSection X. Conference\nResponsibilities\nConference Presidents\n[From a sermon delivered at the General Conference of 1883.]\nThe Lord has been pleased to present before me many things in regard\nto the calling and labor of our ministers, especially those who have been\nappointed as presidents of conferences. Great care should be exercised in the\nselection of men for these positions of trust. There should be earnest prayer\nfor divine enlightenment.\nThose who are thus appointed as overseers of the \ufb02ock should be men of\ngood repute; men who give evidence that they have not only a knowledge of\nthe Scriptures, but an experience in faith, in patience, that in meekness they\nmay instruct those who oppose the truth. They should be men of thorough\nintegrity, not novices, but intelligent students of the Word, able to teach\nothers also, bringing from the treasure-house things new and old; men who\nin character, in words, in deportment, will be an honor to the cause of Christ,\nteaching the truth, living the truth, growing up to the full stature in Christ\nJesus. This means the development and strengthening of every faculty by\nexercise, that the workers may become quali\ufb01ed to bear larger responsibilities\nas the work increases.\n413\nThe Lord Jesus connected Judas and Peter with Himself, not because they\nwere defective in character, but notwithstanding their defects. He would give\nthem an opportunity to learn in His school, meekness and lowliness of heart,\nthat they might become co-laborers with Him. And if they would improve\nthese opportunities, if they would be willing to learn, willing to see their\nde\ufb01ciencies, and in the light of a pure example to become all that Christ\nwould have them, then they would be a great blessing to the church.\nThus the Lord Jesus is still dealing with men. Some who are imperfect in\ncharacter are connected with solemn, sacred interests; and when chosen for\na special work, they should not feel that their own wisdom is suf\ufb01cient, that\nthey need not be counseled, reproved, and instructed. Brethren, if you feel\nthus, you will separate from the Source of your strength, and will be in peril.\nYou may be left to your own supposed suf\ufb01ciency, to do as Judas did,\u2014betray\nyour Lord....\nLooking to Men for Counsel\nSome of our conferences are weak in Christian experience because their\nleading men\u2014and the people have followed their example\u2014have sought for\nthe approval of man with far greater anxiety than for the approval of God.\nThey have looked to man for help and counsel more than to God. They have\nmade men their burden-bearers, and have accepted human wisdom just when\nand where they should have depended upon God. And too often those of\nwhom they sought counsel needed help themselves; for their souls were not\nright with God. The presidents of our\n414\nconferences have become weak and inef\ufb01cient by making \ufb02esh their arm.\nTrust in the wisdom of man does not facilitate growth in grace and in the\nknowledge of Christ.\nBrethren, when perplexities arise in your conference, when emergencies\nare to be met, do not let these dark clouds drift into the General Conference\nif you can possibly avoid it. The president of the General Conference should\nnot be burdened with the affairs of the State conferences, as has been the\ncase in the past. If you, with your associates in the work, cannot adjust the\ntroubles and dif\ufb01culties that arise in your conference, how do you think that\none man can do this work for all the conferences? Why should you pour all\nyour perplexities and discouragements into the burdened mind and heart of\nthe president of the General Conference? He cannot understand the situation\nas well as do you who are on the ground. If you shirk responsibility and\ncrosses and burden-bearing, hard thinking and earnest praying, and look to\nthe president of the General Conference to do your work and help you out\nof your dif\ufb01culties, cannot you see that you lay upon him burdens that will\nimperil his life? Have you not mind and ability as well as he? You should not\nneglect any part of the work because it calls for earnest, cross-bearing effort.\nI repeat, Do not throw your burdens upon the president of the General\nConference. Do not expect him to take up your dropped stitches and bind off\nyour work. Resolve that you will bear your own burdens through Christ who\nstrengthens you.\nThe president of the General Conference, if he is walking in the counsel\nof God, will not encourage his\n415\nbrethren to look to him to de\ufb01ne their duty, but will direct them to the only\nSource that is untainted with the errors of humanity. He will refuse to be mind\nand conscience for others....\nThe one who is the object of this undue con\ufb01dence is exposed to strong\ntemptations. Satan will, if possible, lead him to be self-con\ufb01dent, in order\nthat human defects may mar the work. He will be in danger of encouraging\nhis brethren in their dependence upon him, and of feeling that all things that\npertain to the movements of the cause must be brought to his notice. Thus the\nwork will bear the impress of man instead of the impress of God.\nBut if all will learn to depend upon God for themselves, many dangers that\nassail the one who stands at the head of the work will be averted. If he errs,\nif he permits human in\ufb02uence to sway his judgment, or yields to temptation,\nhe can be corrected and helped by his brethren. And those who learn to go to\nGod for themselves for help and counsel, are learning lessons that will be of\nthe highest value to them.\nIf the of\ufb01cers of a conference would bear successfully the burdens laid\nupon them, they must pray, they must believe, they must trust God to use\nthem as His agents in keeping the churches of the conference in good working\norder. This is their part of the vineyard to cultivate. There must be far\nmore personal responsibility, far more thinking and planning, far more mental\npower brought into the labor put forth for the Master. This would enlarge the\ncapacity of the mind, and give keener perceptions as to what to do and how.\n416\nBrethren, you will have to wrestle with dif\ufb01culties, carry burdens, give\nadvice, plan and execute, constantly looking to God for help. Pray and labor,\nlabor and pray; as pupils in the school of Christ, learn of Jesus.\nThe Lord has given us the promise, \u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him\nask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall\nbe given him.\u201d [James 1:5.] It is in the order of God that those who bear\nresponsibilities should often meet together to counsel with one another, and\nto pray earnestly for that wisdom which He alone can impart. Talk less; much\nprecious time is lost in talk that brings no light. Let brethren unite in fasting\nand prayer for the wisdom that God has promised to supply liberally. Make\nknown your troubles to God. Tell Him, as did Moses, \u201cI cannot lead this\npeople unless Thy presence shall go with me.\u201d And then ask still more; pray\nwith Moses, \u201cShow me Thy glory.\u201d [Exodus 33:18.] What is this glory?\u2014The\ncharacter of God. This is what He proclaimed to Moses.\nLet the soul in living faith fasten upon God. Let the tongue speak His\npraise. When you associate together, let the mind be reverently turned to the\ncontemplation of eternal realities. Thus you will be helping one another to be\nspiritually minded. When your will is in harmony with the divine will, you\nwill be in harmony with one another; you will have Christ by your side as a\ncounselor.\nEnoch walked with God. So may every laborer for Christ. You may say\nwith the psalmist, \u201cI have set the Lord always before me: because He is at my\n417\nright hand, I shall not be moved.\u201d[Psalm 16:8.] While you feel that you\nhave no suf\ufb01ciency of yourself, your suf\ufb01ciency will be in Jesus. If you\nexpect all your counsel and wisdom to come from men, mortal and \ufb01nite like\nyourselves, you will receive only human help. If you go to God for help and\nwisdom, He will never disappoint your faith.\nThe presidents of the State conferences have the same God that the\npresident of the General Conference has, and they may go to the Source\nof wisdom for themselves, instead of depending upon one man, who has to\nobtain his light from the same source.\nIt may be argued that the Lord gives special wisdom to those entrusted\nwith important responsibilities. True, if they walk humbly with Him, He will\ngive them help for their work; and He will give you help for yours, if you\nseek it in the same spirit. If the Lord in His providence has placed important\nresponsibilities upon you, He will \ufb01t you to bear these burdens, if you go to\nHim in faith for strength to do this. When you put your trust in Him, and\ndepend upon His counsel, He will not leave you to your own \ufb01nite judgment,\nto make imperfect plans and decided failures.\nMake No Man Your Confessor\nEvery one needs a practical experience in trusting God for himself. Let\nno man become your confessor; open the heart to God; tell Him every secret\nof the soul. Bring to Him your dif\ufb01culties, small and great, and He will show\nyou a way out of them all. He alone can know how to give the very help you\nneed.\n418\nAnd when, after a trying season, help comes to you, when the Spirit of\nGod is manifestly at work for you, what a precious experience you gain! You\nare obtaining faith and love, the gold that the True Witness counsels you to\nbuy of Him. You are learning to go to God in all your troubles; and as you\nlearn these precious lessons of faith, you will teach the same to others. Thus\nyou may be continually leading the people to a higher plane of experience.\nThe president of a State conference is, by his manner of dealing, educating\nthe ministers under him, and together they can so educate the churches that it\nwill not be necessary to call the ministers of the conference from the \ufb01eld\nto settle dif\ufb01culties and dissensions in the church. If the of\ufb01cers in the\nconference will, as faithful servants, perform their Heaven-appointed duties,\nthe work in our conferences will not be left to become entangled in such\nperplexities as heretofore. And in laboring thus, the workers will become\nsolid, responsible men, who will not fail nor be discouraged in a hard place.\nThere is One who is mighty to save to the uttermost all who come unto\nHim. Is not the promise broad and full, \u201cCome unto Me, all ye that labor\nand are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\u201d? [Matthew 11:28.] Why are\nwe so unwilling to come directly to the Source of our strength? Have we not\ndeparted from the Lord in this? Should not our ministers and the presidents\nof our conferences learn whence cometh their help?...\nA Change of Laborers\nThe question is asked me if it is not a mistake to remove the president of\na State conference to a\n419\nnew \ufb01eld when many of the people under his present charge are unwilling to\ngive him up.\nThe Lord has been pleased to give me light on this question. I have been\nshown that ministers should not be retained in the same district year after\nyear, nor should the same man long preside over a conference. A change of\ngifts is for the good of our conferences and churches.\nMinisters have sometimes felt unwilling to change their \ufb01eld of labor;\nbut if they understood all the reasons for making changes, they would not\ndraw back. Some have pleaded to remain one year longer in the same \ufb01eld,\nand frequently the request has been respected. They have claimed to have\nplans for accomplishing a greater work than heretofore. But at the close\nof the year there was a worse state of things than before. If a minister has\nbeen unfaithful in his work, it is not likely that he will mend the matter by\nremaining. The churches become accustomed to the management of that one\nman, and think they must look to him instead of to God. His ideas and plans\nhave a controlling power in the conference.\nThe people may see that he errs in judgment, and because of this they\nlearn to place a low estimate upon the ministry. If they would look to God,\nand depend upon heavenly wisdom, they would be gaining an experience of\nthe highest value, and would themselves be able, in many respects at least, to\nsupply what is lacking in him who is the overseer of the \ufb02ock. But too often\nthings are left to drift as they will, the president being held responsible for the\ncondition of the churches in the conference, while the church-members settle\ndown, indifferent, lukewarm, doing nothing to bring things into order.\n420\nThe president may not feel the importance of sanctifying himself, that\nothers may be sancti\ufb01ed. He may be an unfaithful watchman, preaching to\nplease the people. Many are strong in some points of character, while they are\nweak and de\ufb01cient in others. As the result, a want of ef\ufb01ciency is manifest\nin some parts of the work. Should the same man continue as president of a\nconference year after year, his defects would be reproduced in the churches\nunder his labors. But one laborer may be strong where his brother is weak,\nand so by exchanging \ufb01elds of labor, one may, to some extent, supply the\nde\ufb01ciencies of another.\nIf all were fully consecrated to God, these marked imperfections of\ncharacter would not exist; but since the laborers do not meet the divine\nstandard, since they weave self into all their work, the best thing, both for\nthemselves and for the churches, is to make frequent changes. And, on the\nother hand, if a laborer is spiritually strong, he is, through the grace of Christ,\na blessing to the churches, and his labors are needed in different conferences.\n*****\nWe are in times of peculiar danger from foes without and within, and God\nwould have you alive to everything concerning your special work. You need\nnot try to do anything without the special help of your heavenly Father. He\nis waiting for you to call, that He may say, \u201cHere I am.\u201d If you will seek, He\nsays He will be found of you; His strength, His grace, and His righteousness\nwill be given to the humble, contrite one who seeks Him with all the heart.\n421\nMinisters and Business Matters\nI have been instructed in regard to the importance of our ministers\u2019\nkeeping free from responsibilities that should be largely borne by business\nmen. In the night season I was in an assembly consisting of a number of\nour brethren who bear the burden of the work. They were deeply perplexed\nover \ufb01nancial affairs, and were consulting as to how the work could be\nmanaged most successfully. Some thought that the number of workers might\nbe limited, and yet all the results essential be realized. One of the brethren\noccupying a position of responsibility was explaining his plans, and stating\nwhat he desired to see accomplished. Several others presented matters for\nconsideration. Then One of dignity and authority arose, and proceeded to\nstate principles for our guidance. To several ministers the Speaker said:\n\u201cYour work is not the management of \ufb01nancial matters. It is not wise for\nyou to undertake this. God has burdens for you to bear, but if you carry lines\nof work for which you are not adapted, your efforts in presenting the Word\nwill prove unsuccessful. This will bring upon you discouragement that will\ndisqualify you for the very work you should do,\u2014a work requiring careful\ndiscrimination and sound, unsel\ufb01sh judgment.\u201d\nThose who are employed to write and to speak the Word should attend\nfewer committee meetings. They should entrust many minor matters to men\nof business ability, and thus avoid being kept on a constant strain that robs the\nmind of its natural vigor.\n422\nThey should give far more attention to the preservation of physical health; for\nvigor of mind depends largely upon vigor of body. Proper periods of sleep\nand rest and an abundance of physical exercise are essential to health of body\nand mind. To rob nature of her hours for rest and recuperation, by allowing\none man to do the work of four, or of three, or even of two, will result in\nirreparable loss.\nEducation in Business Lines\nThose who think that a man\u2019s \ufb01tness for a certain position quali\ufb01es him\nto \ufb01ll several other positions, are liable to make mistakes when planning for\nthe advancement of the work. They are liable to place upon one the cares and\nburdens that should be divided among several.\nExperience is of great value. The Lord desires to have men of intelligence\nconnected with His work, men quali\ufb01ed for various positions of trust in\nour conferences and institutions. Especially are consecrated business men\nneeded, men who will carry the principles of truth into every business\ntransaction. Those placed in charge of \ufb01nancial affairs should not assume\nother burdens, burdens that they are incapable of bearing; nor is the business\nmanagement to be entrusted to incompetent men. Those in charge of the work\nhave erred sometimes in permitting the appointment of men devoid of tact and\nability to manage important \ufb01nancial interests.\nMen of promise in business lines should develop and perfect their talents\nby most thorough study and training. They should be encouraged to place\nthemselves where, as students, they can rapidly gain a\n423\nknowledge of right business principles and methods. Not one business man\nnow connected with the cause needs to be a novice. If men in any line of work\nought to improve their opportunities to become wise and ef\ufb01cient, it is those\nwho are using their ability in the work of building up the kingdom of God\nin our world. In view of the fact that we are living so near the close of this\nearth\u2019s history, there should be greater thoroughness in labor, more vigilant\nwaiting, watching, praying, and working. The human agent should strive to\nattain perfection, that he may be an ideal Christian, complete in Christ Jesus.\nRight Principles Essential\nThose who labor in business lines should take every precaution against\nfalling into error through wrong principles or methods. Their record may be\nlike that of Daniel in the courts of Babylon. When all his business transactions\nwere subjected to the closest scrutiny, not one faulty item could be found. The\nrecord of his business life, incomplete though it is, contains lessons worthy\nof study. It reveals the fact that a business man is not necessarily a scheming,\npolicy man. He may be a man instructed of God at every step. Daniel, while\nprime minister of the kingdom of Babylon, was a prophet of God, receiving\nthe light of heavenly inspiration. His life is an illustration of what every\nChristian business man may be.... *****\nAt this time God\u2019s cause is in need of men and women who possess rare\nquali\ufb01cations and good administrative powers; men and women who will\nmake patient, thorough investigation of the needs of the\n424\nwork in various \ufb01elds; those who have a large capacity for work; those who\npossess warm, kind hearts, cool heads, sound sense, and unbiased judgment;\nthose who are sancti\ufb01ed by the Spirit of God, and can fearlessly say No,\nor Yea and amen, to propositions; those who have strong convictions, clear\nunderstanding, and pure, sympathetic hearts; those who practice the words,\n\u201cAll ye are brethren;\u201d [Matthew 23:8.] those who strive to uplift and restore\nfallen humanity.\u2014 \u201cTestimonies for the Church,\u201d V ol. VII, pages 246-249.\n*****\nNot a few ministers are neglecting the very work that they have been\nappointed to do. Why are those who are set apart for the work of the ministry\nplaced on committees and boards? Why are they called upon to attend so\nmany business meetings, many times at great distance from their \ufb01elds of\nlabor? Why are not business matters placed in the hands of business men?\nThe ministers have not been set apart to do this work. The \ufb01nances of the\ncause are to be managed by men of ability; but ministers are set apart for\nanother line of work....\nMinisters are not to be called hither and thither to attend board meetings\nfor the purpose of deciding common business questions. Many of our\nministers have done this work in the past, but it is not the work in which the\nLord wishes them to engage. Too many \ufb01nancial burdens have been placed on\nthem. When they try to carry these burdens, they neglect to ful\ufb01l the gospel\ncommission. God looks upon this as a dishonor to His name.\u2014 \u201cTestimonies\nfor the Church,\u201d V ol. VII, pages 254, 255.\n425\nCare for Workers\nSome provision should be made for the care of ministers and others of\nGod\u2019s faithful servants who through exposure or overwork in His cause have\nbecome ill and need rest and restoration, or who through age or loss of health\nare no longer able to bear the burden and heat of the day. Ministers are often\nappointed to a \ufb01eld of labor that they know will be detrimental to their health;\nbut, unwilling to shun trying places, they venture, hoping to be a help and\nblessing to the people. After a time they \ufb01nd their health failing. A change of\nclimate and of work is tried, without bringing relief; and then what are they\nto do?\nThese faithful laborers, who for Christ\u2019s sake have given up worldly\nprospects, choosing poverty rather than pleasure or riches; who, forgetful of\nself, have labored earnestly to win souls to Christ; who have given liberally\nto advance various enterprises in the cause of God, and have then sunk down\nin the battle, wearied and ill, and with no means of support, must not be left\nto struggle on in poverty and suffering, or to feel that they are paupers. When\nsickness or in\ufb01rmity comes upon them, let not our workers be burdened with\nthe anxious query, \u201cWhat will become of my wife and little ones, now that I\ncan no longer labor and supply their necessities?\u201d It is but just that provision\nbe made to meet the needs of these faithful laborers, and the needs of those\nwho are dependent on them.\n426\nGenerous provision is made for veterans who have fought for their\ncountry. These men bear the scars and life-long in\ufb01rmities that tell of\ntheir perilous con\ufb02icts, their forced marches, their exposure to storms, their\nsuffering in prison. All these evidences of their loyalty and self-sacri\ufb01ce give\nthem a just claim upon the nation they have helped to save,\u2014a claim that is\nrecognized and honored. But what provision have Seventh-day Adventists\nmade for the soldiers of Christ?\nOur people have not felt as they should the necessity of this matter, and\nit has therefore been neglected. The churches have been thoughtless, and\nthough the light of the word of God has been shining upon their pathway,\nthey have neglected this most sacred duty. The Lord is greatly displeased\nwith this neglect of His faithful servants. Our people should be as willing\nto assist these persons when in adverse circumstances as they have been to\naccept their means and services when in health.\nGod has laid upon us the obligation of giving special attention to the poor\namong us. But these ministers and workers are not to be ranked with the\npoor. They have laid up for themselves a treasure in the heavens that faileth\nnot. They have served the conference in its necessity, and now the conference\nis to serve them.\nWhen cases of this kind come before us, we are not to pass by on the other\nside. We are not to say, \u201cBe ye warmed and \ufb01lled,\u201d [James 2:16.] and then\ntake no active measures to supply their necessities. This has been done in the\npast, and thus in some cases Seventh-day Adventists have dishonored their\nprofession of faith, and\n427\nhave given the world opportunity to reproach the cause of God.\nIt is now the duty of God\u2019s people to roll back this reproach by providing\nthese servants of God with comfortable homes, with a few acres of land, on\nwhich they can raise their own produce, and feel that they are not dependent\non the charities of their brethren. With what pleasure and peace would these\nworn laborers look to a quiet little home where their just claims to its rest\nwould be recognized! ...\nOur Sanitariums a Refuge for Workers\nOften these ministers need special care and treatment. Our sanitariums\nshould be a refuge for such, and for all our worn workers who need rest.\nRooms should be provided where they can have a change and rest, without\ncontinual anxiety as to how they are to meet the expense. When the disciples\nwere worn with labor, Christ said to them, \u201cCome ye yourselves apart, ...and\nrest awhile.\u201d [Mark 6:31.] He would have arrangements made whereby\nHis servants now may have opportunity to rest and recover strength. Our\nsanitariums are to be open to our hard-working ministers, who have done\nall in their power to secure funds for the erection and support of these\ninstitutions; and at any time when they are in need of the advantages here\noffered, they should be made to feel at home.\nThese workers should not at any time be charged a high price for board\nand treatment, neither should they be regarded as beggars, or in any way made\nto feel as such by those whose hospitality they receive. To manifest liberality\nin the use of the facilities God has provided for His worn and overworked\nservants,\n428\nis genuine medical missionary work in His sight. God\u2019s workers are bound\nto Him, and when they are received, it should be remembered that Christ is\nreceived in the person of His messengers. He requires this, and is dishonored\nand displeased when they are treated indifferently or dealt with in a small or\nsel\ufb01sh manner. God\u2019s blessing will not attend close dealing with any of His\nchosen ones.\nAmong the medical fraternity there has not always been a keenness of\nperception to discern these matters. Some have not regarded them as they\nshould. May the Lord sanctify the perception of those who have charge of\nour institutions, that they may know who should have true sympathy and\ncare. That branch of the cause for which these worn-out laborers have worked\nshould show an appreciation of their labor by helping them in their time of\nneed, thus sharing largely with the sanitarium the burden of expense. Some\nworkers are so situated as to be able to lay by a little from their salary; and\nthis they should do, if possible, to meet an emergency; yet even these should\nbe welcome as a blessing to the sanitarium.\nBut most of our workers have many and great obligations to meet. At\nevery turn, when means are needed, they are called upon to do something, to\nlead out, that the in\ufb02uence of their example may stimulate others to liberality,\nand the cause of God be advanced. They feel such an intense desire to plant\nthe standard in new \ufb01elds that many even hire money to help in various\nenterprises. They have not given grudgingly, but have felt that it was a\nprivilege to work for the advancement of the truth. By thus responding to\n429\ncalls for means, they are often left with very little surplus.\nThe Lord has kept an accurate account of their liberality to the cause.\nHe knows what a good work they have done, a work of which the younger\nlaborers have no conception. He has been cognizant of all the privation and\nself-denial they have endured. He has marked every circumstance of these\ncases. It is all written in the books. These workers are a spectacle before\nthe world, before angels, and before men; and they are an object-lesson to\ntest the sincerity of our religious principles. The Lord would have our people\nunderstand that the pioneers in this work deserve all that our institutions can\ndo for them. God calls upon us to understand that those who have grown old\nin His service deserve our love, our honor, our deepest respect.\nA Workers\u2019 Fund\nA fund should be raised for such workers as are no longer able to labor.\nWe cannot be clear before God unless we make every reasonable effort in\nthis matter, and that without delay. There are some among us who will not\nsee the necessity of this move; but their opposition should have no in\ufb02uence\nwith us. Those who purpose in their hearts to be right and to do right, should\nmove steadily forward for the accomplishment of a good work, a work that\nGod requires to be done.\u2014 \u201cTestimonies for the Church,\u201d V ol. VII, pages\n290-294.\nHouses of Worship\nWhen an interest is aroused in any town or city, that interest should be\nfollowed up. The place should be thoroughly worked, until a humble house\nof worship stands as a sign, a memorial of God\u2019s Sabbath, a light amid the\nmoral darkness. These memorials are to stand in many places as witnesses to\nthe truth. God in His mercy has provided that the messengers of the gospel\nshall go to all countries, tongues, and peoples, until the standard of truth shall\nbe established in all parts of the inhabited world. *****\n430\nWherever a company of believers is raised up, a house of worship should\nbe built. Let not the workers leave the place without accomplishing this.\nIn many places where the message has been preached, those who have\naccepted it are in limited circumstances, and can do but little toward securing\nadvantages that would give character to the work. Often this renders it\ndif\ufb01cult to extend the work. As persons become interested in the truth, they\nare told by the ministers of other churches,\u2014and these words are echoed by\nthe church-members,\u2014\u201cThese people have no church, and you have no place\nof worship. You are a small company, poor and unlearned. In a short time\nthe ministers will go away, and then the interest will die down. Then you will\ngive up all these new ideas which you have received.\u201d Can we suppose that\nthis will not bring strong temptation to those who see the reasons of our faith\nand are convicted by the Spirit of God in regard to present truth?\n431\nIt has to be often repeated, that from a small beginning large interests\nmay grow. If wisdom and sancti\ufb01ed judgment and skilful generalship are\nmanifested by us in building up the interests of our Redeemer\u2019s kingdom, we\nshall do all in our power to assure the people of the stability of our work.\nHumble sanctuaries will be erected, where those who accept the truth may\n\ufb01nd a place to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience.\n*****\nWhenever it is possible, let our church buildings be dedicated to God free\nof debt. When a church is raised up, let the members arise and build. Under\nthe direction of a minister who is guided by the advice of his fellow-ministers,\nlet the newly converted ones work with their own hands, saying, \u201cWe need\na meeting-house, and we must have it.\u201d God calls upon His people to make\ncheerful, united efforts in His cause. Let this be done, and soon will be heard\nthe voice of thanksgiving, \u201cSee what the Lord hath wrought!\u201d\nThere are some cases, however, in which a young church may not be able\nat once to bear the whole burden of erecting a house of worship. In these\ncases let the brethren in other churches help them. In some cases it may be\nbetter to hire some money than not to build. If a man has money, and, after\ngiving what he can, will make a loan, either without interest or at a low rate,\nit would be right to use the money until the indebtedness can be lifted. But I\nrepeat, If possible, church buildings should be dedicated free of debt.\nIn our churches the pews should not be rented. The wealthy are not to be\nhonored above the poor. Let no distinction be made. \u201cAll ye are brethren.\u201d\n[Matthew 23:8.]\n432\nIn none of our buildings should we seek to make a display, for this would\nnot advance the work. Our economy should testify to our principles. We\nshould employ methods of work that are not transient. Everything should be\ndone solidly *****\nThe lax way which some churches have of incurring debts and keeping\nin debt, was presented before me. In some cases a continual debt is upon the\nhouse of God. There is a continual interest to be paid. These things should\nnot and need not be. If there is that wisdom and tact and zeal manifested for\nthe Master which God requires, there will be a change in these things. The\ndebts will be lifted. God calls for offerings from those who can give, and\neven the poorer members can do their little. Self-denial will enable all to do\nsomething. Both old and young, parents and children, are to show their faith\nby their works. Let the necessity that each act a part be most strenuously\nimpressed upon the members of the church. Let every one do his best. When\nthere is a will to do, God will open the way. He does not design that His cause\nshall be trammeled with debt.\nGod calls for self-sacri\ufb01ce. This will bring not only \ufb01nancial but spiritual\nprosperity. Self-denial and self-sacri\ufb01ce will work wonders in advancing the\nspirituality of the church *****\nThe test question for every Christian to ask himself is, \u201cHave I, in my\ninmost soul, supreme love for Christ? Do I love His tabernacle? Will not the\nLord be honored by my making His sacred institution\n433\nmy \ufb01rst consideration? Is my love for God and my Redeemer strong enough\nto lead me to deny self? When tempted to indulge in pleasure and sel\ufb01sh\nenjoyment, shall I not say, No, I will spend nothing for my own grati\ufb01cation\nwhile the house of God is burdened with debt?\u201d\nOur Redeemer claims far more than we give Him. Self interposes its\ndesire to be \ufb01rst; but the Lord claims the whole heart, the entire affections. He\nwill not come in as second. And should not Christ have our \ufb01rst and highest\nconsideration? Should He not demand this token of our respect and loyalty?\nThese things underlie our very heart-life, in the home circle and in the church.\nIf the heart, the soul, the strength, the life, is surrendered wholly to God, if\nthe affections are given wholly to Him, we shall make Him supreme in all\nour service. When we are in harmony with God, the thought of His honor\nand glory comes before everything else. No person is preferred before Him\nin our gifts and offerings. We have a sense of what it means to be partners\nwith Christ in the sacred \ufb01rm.\nThe house where God meets with His people will be dear and sacred to\nevery one of His loyal children. It will not be left crippled with debt. To\nallow such a thing would appear almost like a denial of your faith. You will\nbe ready to make a great personal sacri\ufb01ce if only you may have a house free\nfrom debt, where God can meet with and bless His people.\nEvery debt upon every house of worship among us may be paid if the\nmembers of the church will plan wisely and put forth earnest, zealous effort\nto cancel the debt. And in every case where a debt is lifted,\n434\nlet there be a service of thanksgiving, which shall be as a re-dedication to God\nof His house.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:100-104. *****\nThe need for a meeting-house where there is a newly formed company of\nbelievers, has been presented before me in a panoramic view. I saw workmen\nbuilding humble houses of worship. Those newly come to the faith were\nhelping with willing hands, and those who had means were assisting with\ntheir means. In the basement of the church, above ground, a schoolroom was\nprepared for the children, and a teacher was sent there to take charge. The\nnumbers in the school were not large, but it was a happy beginning. I heard\nthe songs of children and of parents: \u201cExcept the Lord build the house, they\nlabor in vain that built it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh\nbut in vain.\u201d \u201cPraise ye the Lord. Praise the Lord, O my soul. While I live will\nI praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.\u201d\n[Psalm 127:1; 146:1, 2.]\nThe establishment of churches, the erection of meeting-houses and\nschool-buildings, was extended from city to city, and the tithe was increasing\nto carry forward the work. Plants were made not only in one place, but in\nmany places, and the Lord was working to increase His forces. *****\nIn this work all classes will be reached. When the Holy Spirit works\namong us, souls who are unready for Christ\u2019s appearing are convicted. Many\ncome to our meetings and are converted who for years have\n435\nnot attended meetings in any church. The simplicity of the truth reaches their\nhearts. The tobacco devotees sacri\ufb01ce their idol, and the liquor drinker his\nliquor. They could not do this if they did not by faith grasp the promises of\nGod for the forgiveness of their sins.\nThe truth as it is in the Word comes before high and low, rich and poor,\nand those who receive the message become workers with us and with God,\nand a strong force is raised up to labor harmoniously. This is our work. It\nis not to be neglected in any of our camp-meeting labor. It is a part of every\ngospel mission. Instead of setting every talent to work for the lowest outcasts,\nwe should seek in every place to raise up a company of believers who will\nunite with us in uplifting the standard of truth, and working for rich and poor.\nThen as churches are established, there will be an increase of helpers to labor\nfor the destitute and the outcast.\u2014 General Conference Bulletin, March, 1899.\n*****\nMany not of our faith are longing for the very help that Christians are in\nduty bound to give. If God\u2019s people would show a genuine interest in their\nneighbors, many would be reached by the special truths for this time. Nothing\nwill or ever can give character to the work like helping people just where they\nare.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:280.\nExamination for the Ministry\nMen should not be encouraged to go into the \ufb01eld as ministers without\nunmistakable evidence that God has called them. The Lord will not entrust the\nburden for His \ufb02ock to unquali\ufb01ed individuals. Those whom God calls must\nbe men of deep experience, tried and proved, men of sound judgment, men\nwho will dare to reprove sin in the spirit of meekness, men who understand\nhow to feed the \ufb02ock. God knows the heart, and He knows whom to\nselect.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church1:209. *****\n436\nThere has been too little done in examining ministers; and for this very\nreason churches have had the labors of unconverted, inef\ufb01cient men, who\nhave lulled the members to sleep, instead of awakening them to greater zeal\nand earnestness in the cause of God. There are ministers who come to the\nprayer-meeting, and pray the same old, lifeless prayers over and over; they\npreach the same dry discourses from week to week and from month to month.\nThey have nothing new and inspiring to present to their congregations, and\nthis is evidence that they are not partakers of the divine nature. Christ is not\nabiding in the heart by faith.\nThose who claim to keep and teach the holy law of God, and yet are\ncontinually transgressing that law, are stumbling-blocks both to sinners and\nto believers in the truth. The loose, lax way in which many\n437\nregard the law of Jehovah and the gift of His Son, is an insult to God. The\nonly way in which we can correct this wide-spread evil, is to examine closely\nevery one who would become a teacher of the Word. Those upon whom\nthis responsibility rests, should acquaint themselves with his history since he\nprofessed to believe the truth. His Christian experience and his knowledge\nof the Scriptures, the way in which he holds present truth, should all be\nunderstood. No one should be accepted as a laborer in the cause of God,\nuntil he makes it manifest that he has a real, living experience in the things of\nGod. *****\nThose who are about to enter upon the sacred work of teaching Bible truth\nto the world, should be carefully examined by faithful, experienced persons.\nAfter they have had some experience, there is still another work to be done\nfor them: they should be presented before the Lord in earnest prayer, that He\nmay indicate by His Holy Spirit whether they are acceptable to Him. The\napostle says, \u201cLay hands suddenly on no man.\u201d [1 Timothy 5:22.] In the\ndays of the apostles, the ministers of God did not dare to rely upon their own\njudgment in selecting or accepting men to take the solemn and sacred position\nof mouthpiece for God. They chose the men whom their judgment accepted,\nand then placed them before the Lord to see if He would accept them to go\nforth as His representatives. No less than this should be done now.\nIn many places we meet men who have been hurried into responsible\npositions as elders of the church, when they are not quali\ufb01ed for such a\nposition. They\n438\nhave not proper government over themselves. Their in\ufb02uence is not good.\nThe church is in trouble continually in consequence of the defective character\nof the leaders. Hands have been laid too suddenly upon these men.\nMinisters of God should be men of good repute, capable of discreetly\nmanaging an interest after they have aroused it. We stand in great need of\ncompetent men, who will bring honor instead of disgrace upon the cause\nwhich they represent.\nMinisters should be examined especially to see if they have an intelligent\nunderstanding of the truth for this time, so that they can give a connected\ndiscourse upon the prophecies or upon practical subjects. If they cannot\nclearly present Bible subjects, they need to be hearers and learners still. In\norder to be teachers of Bible truth, they should earnestly and prayerfully\nsearch the Scriptures, and become conversant with them. All these things\nshould be carefully and prayerfully considered before men are sent into the\n\ufb01eld of labor.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:406, 407. *****\nIn Timothy, Paul saw one who appreciated the sacredness of the work of\na minister, who was not appalled at the prospect of suffering and persecution,\nand who was willing to be taught. Yet the apostle did not venture to take the\nresponsibility of giving Timothy, an untried youth, a training in the gospel\nministry, without \ufb01rst fully satisfying himself in regard to his character and\nhis past life.\n439\nTimothy\u2019s father was a Greek and his mother a Jewess. From a child\nhe had known the Scriptures. The piety that he saw in his home life was\nsound and sensible. The faith of his mother and his grandmother in the\nsacred oracles was to him a constant reminder of the blessing in doing God\u2019s\nwill. The word of God was the rule by which these two godly women had\nguided Timothy. The spiritual power of the lessons that he had received from\nthem kept him pure in speech and unsullied by the evil in\ufb02uences with which\nhe was surrounded. Thus his home instructors had co-operated with God in\npreparing him to bear burdens.\nPaul saw that Timothy was faithful, steadfast, and true, and he chose\nhim as a companion in labor and travel. Those who had taught Timothy in\nhis childhood were rewarded by seeing the son of their care linked in close\nfellowship with the great apostle\nPaul loved Timothy, his \u201cown son in the faith.\u201d [1 Timothy 1:2.] The\ngreat apostle often drew the younger disciple out, questioning him in regard\nto Scripture history; and as they traveled from place to place, he carefully\ntaught him how to do successful work. Both Paul and Silas, in all their\nassociation with Timothy, sought to deepen the impression that had already\nbeen made upon his mind, of the sacred, serious nature of the work of the\ngospel minister.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 203, 204. *****\nIn his work, Timothy constantly sought Paul\u2019s advice and instruction. He\ndid not move from impulse, but exercised consideration and calm thought,\ninquiring at every step, Is this the way of the Lord?\u2014 Idem, page 205.\n440\nOrdination\n\u201cThere were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and\nteachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of\nCyrene, and Manaen, ...and Saul. As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted,\nthe Holy Ghost said, Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto\nI have called them.\u201d [Acts 13:1, 2.] Before being sent forth as missionaries to\nthe heathen world, these apostles were solemnly dedicated to God by fasting\nand prayer and the laying on of hands. Thus they were authorized by the\nchurch, not only to teach the truth, but to perform the rite of baptism, and to\norganize churches, being invested with full ecclesiastical authority.\nThe Christian church was at this time entering upon an important era. The\nwork of proclaiming the gospel message among the Gentiles was now to be\nprosecuted with vigor; and as a result, the church was to be strengthened by a\ngreat ingathering of souls. The apostles who had been appointed to lead out\nin this work, would be exposed to suspicion, prejudice, and jealousy. Their\nteachings concerning the breaking down of \u201cthe middle wall of partition\u201d\n[Ephesians 2:14.] that had so long separated the Jewish and the Gentile world,\nwould naturally subject them to the charge of heresy; and their authority as\nministers of the gospel would be questioned by many zealous, believing Jews.\nGod foresaw the dif\ufb01culties that His servants would be called to meet;\nand in order that their work\n441\nshould be above challenge, He instructed the church by revelation to set them\napart publicly to the work of the ministry. Their ordination was a public\nrecognition of their divine appointment to bear to the Gentiles the glad tidings\nof the gospel.\nBoth Paul and Barnabas had already received their commission from God\nHimself, and the ceremony of the laying on of hands added no new grace\nor virtual quali\ufb01cation. It was an acknowledged form of designation to an\nappointed of\ufb01ce, and a recognition of one\u2019s authority in that of\ufb01ce. By it the\nseal of the church was set upon the work of God.\nTo the Jew, this form was a signi\ufb01cant one. When a Jewish father blessed\nhis children, he laid his hands reverently upon their heads. When an animal\nwas devoted to sacri\ufb01ce, the hand of the one invested with priestly authority\nwas laid upon the head of the victim. And when the ministers of the church\nof believers in Antioch laid their hands upon Paul and Barnabas, they by that\naction asked God to bestow His blessing upon the chosen apostles, in their\ndevotion to the speci\ufb01c work to which they had been appointed.\nAt a later date, the rite of ordination by the laying on of hands was greatly\nabused; unwarrantable importance was attached to the act, as if a power\ncame at once upon those who received such ordination, which immediately\nquali\ufb01ed them for any and all ministerial work. But in the setting apart of\nthese two apostles, there is no record indicating that any virtue was imparted\nby the mere act of laying on of hands. There is only the simple record of their\nordination, and of the bearing that it had on their future work.\n442\nThe circumstances connected with the separation of Paul and Barnabas\nby the Holy Spirit to a de\ufb01nite line of service, show clearly that the Lord\nworks through appointed agencies in His organized church. Years before,\nwhen the divine purpose concerning Paul was \ufb01rst revealed to him by the\nSaviour Himself, Paul was immediately afterward brought into contact with\nmembers of the newly organized church at Damascus. Furthermore, the\nchurch at that place was not long left in darkness as to the personal experience\nof the converted Pharisee. And now, when the divine commission given at that\ntime was to be more fully carried out, the Holy Spirit, again bearing witness\nconcerning Paul as a chosen vessel to bear the gospel to the Gentiles, laid\nupon the church the work of ordaining him and his fellow-laborer. As the\nleaders of the church in Antioch \u201cministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy\nGhost said, Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have\ncalled them.\u201d\nGod has made His church on the earth a channel of light, and through\nit He communicates His purposes and His will. He does not give to one of\nHis servants an experience independent of and contrary to the experience of\nthe church itself. Neither does He give one man a knowledge of His will\nfor the entire church, while the church\u2014Christ\u2019s body\u2014is left in darkness.\nIn His providence, He places His servants in close connection with His\nchurch, in order that they may have less con\ufb01dence in themselves, and greater\ncon\ufb01dence in others whom He is leading out to advance His work.\nThere have ever been in the church those who are constantly inclined\ntoward individual independence.\n443\nThey seem unable to realize that independence of spirit is liable to lead the\nhuman agent to have too much con\ufb01dence in himself, and to trust in his own\njudgment rather than to respect the counsel and highly esteem the judgment of\nhis brethren, especially of those in the of\ufb01ces that God has appointed for the\nleadership of His people. God has invested His church with special authority\nand power, which no one can be justi\ufb01ed in disregarding and despising; for\nhe who does this despises the voice of God.\nThose who are inclined to regard their individual judgment as supreme,\nare in grave peril. It is Satan\u2019s studied effort to separate such ones from\nthose who are channels of light, through whom God has wrought to build up\nand extend His work in the earth. To neglect or despise those whom God\nhas appointed to bear the responsibilities of leadership in connection with\nthe advancement of the truth, is to reject the means that He has ordained for\nthe help, encouragement, and strength of His people. For any worker in the\nLord\u2019s cause to pass these by, and to think that his light must come through no\nother channel than directly from God, is to place himself in a position where\nhe is liable to be deceived by the enemy, and overthrown. The Lord in His\nwisdom has arranged that by means of the close relationship that should be\nmaintained by all believers, Christian shall be united to Christian, and church\nto church. Thus the human instrumentality will be enabled to co-operate with\nthe divine. Every agency will be subordinate to the Holy Spirit, and all the\nbelievers will be united in an organized and well-directed effort to give to the\nworld the glad tidings of the grace of God.\n444\nPaul regarded the occasion of his formal ordination as marking the\nbeginning of a new and important epoch in his life-work. It was from this\ntime that he afterward dated the beginning of his apostleship in the Christian\nchurch.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 160-165. *****\nIt was at the ordination of the twelve that the \ufb01rst step was taken in the\norganization of the church that after Christ\u2019s departure was to carry on His\nwork on the earth. Of this ordination the record says, \u201cHe goeth up into a\nmountain, and calleth unto Him whom He would: and they came unto Him.\nAnd He ordained twelve, that they should be with Him, and that He might\nsend them forth to preach.\u201d [Mark 3:13, 14.]...\nWith gladness and rejoicing, God and the angels beheld this scene. The\nFather knew that from these men the light of heaven would shine forth; that\nthe words spoken by them as they witnessed for His Son, would echo from\ngeneration to generation till the close of time.\nThe disciples were to go forth as Christ\u2019s witnesses, to declare to the\nworld what they had seen and heard of Him. Their of\ufb01ce was the most\nimportant to which human beings had ever been called, second only to that\nof Christ Himself. They were to be workers together with God for the\nsaving of men. As in the Old Testament the twelve patriarchs stood as\nrepresentatives of Israel, so the twelve apostles stand as representatives of\nthe gospel church.\u2014 Idem, pages 18, 19.\n445\nBusiness Meetings\nIn all our business meetings, as well as our social and religious meetings,\nwe want Jesus by our side as a guide and counselor. There will be no tendency\nto lightness where the presence of the Saviour is recognized. Self will not be\nmade prominent. There will be a realization of the importance of the work\nthat is to be done. There will be a desire that the plans to be laid may be\ndirected by Him who is mighty in counsel.\nCould our eyes but be opened, we should behold angels of heaven in our\nassemblies. Could we but realize this, there would be no desire to hold to our\nown opinions upon unimportant points, which so often retard the progress of\nthe meeting and the work. If there were more real praying done, if there were\nmore solemn consideration given to weighty matters, the tone of our business\nmeetings would be changed, elevated. All would feel that the assembly had\nmet to lay plans for the advancement of the work, and that the object of the\nwork is only to save souls.\nAll that we do and all that we say is transferred to the books of heaven. Let\nus not be guilty of bringing down God\u2019s work to the level of common business\ntransactions. Our standard must be high; our minds must be elevated.\nThere are always a few who think, when their brethren are pulling\nforward, that it is their duty to pull back. They object to everything that is\nproposed,\n446\nand make war on every plan that they have not themselves originated. Here is\nan opportunity for persons to develop inordinate self-con\ufb01dence. They have\nnever learned in the school of Christ the precious and all-important lesson of\nbecoming meek and lowly. There is nothing harder for those who possess\na strong will than to give up their own way, and submit to the judgment of\nothers. It is dif\ufb01cult for such to become teachable, gentle, and easy to be\nentreated.\nIn our business meetings, it is important that precious time should not\nbe consumed in debating points that are of small consequence. The habit of\npetty criticism should not be indulged, for it perplexes and confuses minds,\nand shrouds in mystery the things that are most plain and simple. If there is\nthat love among brethren which will lead them to esteem others better than\nthemselves, there will be a giving up of their own ways and wishes to others.\nIt is our duty to study, daily and hourly, how we may answer the prayer of\nChrist, that His disciples may be one, as He and the Father are one. Precious\nlessons may be learned by keeping our Saviour\u2019s prayer before the mind, and\nby acting our part to ful\ufb01ll His desire.\nIn our business connection with the work of God, and in handling sacred\nthings, we cannot be too careful to guard against a spirit of irreverence; never,\nfor an instant, should the word of God be used deceitfully, to carry a point\nwhich we are anxious to see succeed. Honor, integrity, and truth must be\npreserved at any cost to self. Our every thought, word, and action should be\nsubject to the will of Christ.\n447\nLevity is not appropriate in meetings where the solemn work and word of God\nare under consideration. The prayer has been offered that Christ shall preside\nin the assembly, and impart His wisdom, His grace and righteousness. Is it\nconsistent to take a course that will be grievous to His Spirit and contrary to\nHis work?\nLet us bear in mind that Jesus is in our midst. Then an elevating,\ncontrolling in\ufb02uence from the Spirit of God will pervade the assembly. There\nwill be manifested that wisdom which is \u201cfrom above,\u201d which is \u201c\ufb01rst pure,\nthen peaceable, ...full of mercy and good fruits,\u201d [James 3:17.] which cannot\nerr. In all the plans and decisions there will be that charity that \u201cseeketh not\nher own;\u201d that is \u201cnot easily provoked;\u201d that \u201cthinketh no evil;\u201d that \u201crejoiceth\nnot in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;\u201d that \u201cbeareth all things, believeth all\nthings, hopeth all things, endureth all things.\u201d [1 Corinthians 13:5-7.] *****\nLet every one who sits in council and committee meetings write in his\nheart the words, \u201cI am working for time and for eternity; and I am accountable\nto God for the motives that prompt me to action.\u201d Let this be his motto. Let\nthe prayer of the psalmist be his prayer; \u201cSet a watch, O Lord, before my\nmouth; keep the door of my lips. Incline not my heart to any evil thing.\u201d\n[Psalm 141:3, 4.]\u2014 \u201cTestimonies for the Church,\u201d V ol. VII, pages 258, 259.\n448\nProper Remuneration for Ministers\nIn this life those engaged in the ministry should receive \ufb01tting\nremuneration for their labor. They give their entire time, thought, and effort\nto the service of the Master; and it is not in the order of God that the wages\npaid them should be insuf\ufb01cient to supply the needs of their families. The\nminister who does his share according to his ability should receive his just\ndue.\nThe men who decide what each worker shall receive are to strive earnestly\nto meet the mind of God in their decisions. Some who have served on\nauditing committees have lacked in discrimination and judgment. At times\nthe committee has been composed of men who had no real understanding\nof the situation of the workers, and who have again and again brought\nreal oppression and want into families by their wrong decisions. Their\nmanagement has given occasion for the enemy to tempt and discourage the\nworkers, and in some cases has driven them from the \ufb01eld.\nScrupulous care should be shown in settling the accounts of the laborers.\nThose who are chosen to act on the auditing committee should be men of\nclear perception, acquainted with the work they are handling. They should\nbe \u201cable men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness.\u201d [Exodus\n18:21.]\nThe minister should have a margin to work upon, for there are many calls\nmade upon his \ufb01nancial resources. In his work he frequently \ufb01nds people so\n449\npoor that they have little to eat and wear, and no proper sleeping\naccommodations. He must give succor to the very needy, to supply their\nhunger and cover their nakedness. He is also expected to lead out in good\nenterprises, to help in building churches, and in advancing the cause of God\nin other lands.\nGod\u2019s chosen missionary can have no settled abode, but must take his\nfamily from place to place, often from country to country. The character of his\nwork makes this necessary. But this frequent moving places him under heavy\nexpense. Then, too, in order to exert a good in\ufb02uence, his wife and children,\nand he himself, must set a \ufb01tting example of neat and becoming dress. Their\npersonal appearance, their living quarters, their surroundings,\u2014all must tell\nin favor of the truth they advocate. They must always appear cheerful and\nfresh, that they may bring sunshine to those who need help. They are often\nobliged to entertain their brethren, and while they \ufb01nd this a pleasure, it is\nalso an additional expense.\nIt is a terrible injustice for an auditing committee to disappoint a worthy\nminister who is in need of every cent that he has been led to expect. The Lord\ndeclares, \u201cI the Lord love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt-offering.\u201d [Isaiah\n61:8.] He would have His people reveal a liberal spirit in all their dealings\nwith their fellows. The principle underlying His command to ancient Israel,\n\u201cThou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn,\u201d [1\nCorinthians 9:9; See Deuteronomy 25:4.] is a principle that should never be\nset aside by any who have to do with the remuneration of those who have\ngiven themselves to advance God\u2019s cause in the world, and who spend\n450\ntheir strength in lifting the minds of men from the contemplation of earthly\nthings to the heavenly. God loves these workers, and He would have men\nrespect their rights.\nThe eight-hour system \ufb01nds no place in the program of the minister of\nGod. He must hold himself in readiness for service at any hour. He must\nkeep up his life and energy; for if he is dull and languid, he cannot exert\na saving in\ufb02uence. If he occupies a position of responsibility, he must be\nprepared to attend board and council meetings, spending hours in brain- and\nnerve-taxing labor, planning for the advancement of the cause. Work of this\nkind is a heavy tax on mind and body.\nThe minister who has a due appreciation of service, regards himself as\nGod\u2019s minuteman. When, with Isaiah, he hears the voice of the Lord saying,\n\u201cWhom shall I send, and who will go for us?\u201d he responds, \u201cHere am I;\nsend me.\u201d [Isaiah 6:8.] He cannot say, I am my own; I will do what I\nplease with my time. No one who has given his life to God\u2019s work as His\nminister, lives for self. His work is to follow Christ, to be a willing agent and\nco-worker with the Master, receiving His Spirit day by day, and working as\nthe Saviour worked, neither failing nor being discouraged. He is chosen of\nGod as a faithful instrument to promote missionary work in all lands, and he\nmust ponder well the path he follows.\nThose who have never carried the burden of such work, and who suppose\nthat the Lord\u2019s chosen and faithful ministers have an easy time, should bear\nin mind that sentinels for God are on duty constantly.\n451\nTheir labor is not measured by hours. When their accounts are audited, if\nsel\ufb01sh men, with voice or stroke of pen, limit them unduly in their wages, a\ngreat wrong is done.\nThose who are bearing administrative burdens in connection with God\u2019s\ncause, can afford to be fair and true; they can afford to deal on right principles.\nWhen in a time of \ufb01nancial stress it is thought that wages must be reduced,\nlet a circular be published setting forth the true situation, and then let those\nemployed by the conference be asked whether, under the circumstances, they\ncould do with less for their support. All the arrangements made with those in\nGod\u2019s service should be regarded as a sacred transaction between man and his\nfellow-man. Men have no right to treat the workers as if they were inanimate\nobjects, with no voice or expression of their own. *****\nThe Minister\u2019s Wife\nThe minister is paid for his work, and this is well. And if the Lord gives\nthe wife as well as the husband the burden of labor, and she devotes her time\nand strength to visiting from family to family and opening the Scriptures to\nthem, although the hands of ordination have not been laid upon her, she is\naccomplishing a work that is in the line of ministry. Then should her labors\nbe counted as naught?\nInjustice has sometimes been done to women who labor just as devotedly\nas their husbands, and who are recognized by God as being necessary to the\nwork of the ministry. The method of paying men-laborers,\n452\nand not paying their wives who share their labors with them, is a plan not\naccording to the Lord\u2019s order, and if carried out in our conferences, is liable\nto discourage our sisters from qualifying themselves for the work they should\nengage in. God is a God of justice, and if the ministers receive a salary for\ntheir work, their wives, who devote themselves just as disinterestedly to the\nwork, should be paid in addition to the wages their husbands receive, even\nthough they may not ask for this.\nSeventh-day Adventists are not in any way to belittle woman\u2019s work.\nIf a woman puts her housework in the hands of a faithful, prudent helper,\nand leaves her children in good care, while she engages in the work, the\nconference should have wisdom to understand the justice of her receiving\nwages. *****\nThe Lord has a work for women as well as men to do. They may\naccomplish a good work for God if they will \ufb01rst learn in the school of Christ\nthe precious, all-important lessons of meekness. They must not only bear the\nname of Christ, but possess His Spirit. They must walk even as He walked,\npurifying their souls from everything that de\ufb01les. Then they will be able to\nbene\ufb01t others by presenting the all-suf\ufb01ciency of Jesus.\u2014\u201c Testimonies for\nthe Church6:117.\n453\nA Wise Distribution of Means\nChurch-members are to contribute cheerfully toward the support of the\nministry. They should practice self-denial and economy, that they may come\nbehind in no good gift. We are pilgrims and strangers, seeking a better\ncountry, and every soul should make a covenant with God by sacri\ufb01ce. The\ntime for saving souls is short, and whatever is not needed in supplying positive\nnecessities, should be brought as a thank-offering to God.\nAnd it is the duty of those who labor in word and doctrine to show an\nequal self-sacri\ufb01ce. A solemn responsibility rests upon those who receive the\nliberal donations of the church, and administer the means in God\u2019s treasury.\nThey are to study carefully the providences of God, that they may discern\nwhere there is the greatest necessity. They are to be co-laborers with Christ\nin establishing His kingdom on the earth, in harmony with the prayer of the\nSaviour, \u201cThy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\u201d\n[Matthew 6:10.]\nThe work all over the world is to receive consideration. New \ufb01elds are to\nbe entered. Let our brethren remember that much means and much hard labor\nare required to carry forward the work in new \ufb01elds.\nIn planning for the cause in foreign countries, the dif\ufb01culties to be met\nthere are to be considered, and willing support must be given to the workers.\nThose at the heart of the cause are to examine closely into\n454\nthe needs of the different \ufb01elds; for they are God\u2019s stewards, set for the\nextension of the truth in all parts of the world. They are inexcusable if they\nremain in ignorance regarding the needs of the work. They are to know the\nadvantages and dif\ufb01culties of each \ufb01eld, and then with a spirit of unsel\ufb01sh\ninterest they are to work for the advancement of the cause as a whole.\nWhen those who are to appropriate to the needs of the Lord\u2019s work means\nin His treasury, have unsel\ufb01shly tried to gain a right understanding of the\nsituation, they should come to the mercy-seat, asking for clear intuition and\nheavenly wisdom, that they may see the necessities of the far-off countries, as\nwell as of those nearer by. Never will they seek the Lord in vain. As they ask\nHim to help them to advance the work in regions beyond, they will receive\ngrace from on high.\nAn unsel\ufb01sh equality is to be shown in dealing with the working forces in\nhome and foreign lands. More and more we must realize that the means which\nis brought to the Lord\u2019s treasury in the tithes and gifts of our people, should\nbe used for the support of the work, not only at home, but in foreign \ufb01elds.\nThose living in places where the work has long been established, should bind\nabout their supposed wants, so that the work in new \ufb01elds may go forward. In\nthe institutions that have been long established there is sometimes a desire to\ngrasp more and still more advantages. But the Lord declares that this should\nnot be. The money in His treasury is to be used in building up the work all\nover the world.\nThose places in the Lord\u2019s vineyard where but little or nothing has been\ndone, call upon the places\n455\nin which institutions are already established, to understand the situation. Let\nthe men in those \ufb01elds which by God\u2019s appointment have already been largely\nworked, and where the cause is strongly established, curtail their ambition to\nbranch out. Let them not think of the great things they would like to do,\nand continue to add to their facilities, while other parts of the vineyard are\ndestitute. It is sel\ufb01sh ambition that leads men to call for more for a \ufb01eld\nalready possessing ample facilities, while missionary \ufb01elds are in need.\nIf the Lord favors the work in some countries above that in other countries,\nit is that there may be revealed a spirit of true liberality, a desire to assist those\nwho greatly need help in order to \ufb01nd a standing-place, and to give character\nto the work. The Lord is no respecter of persons or of places. His work is one\ngreat whole. His truth is to be proclaimed to every nation, kindred, tongue,\nand people; and as new \ufb01elds are entered and people accept the truth, houses\nof worship and schoolhouses are to be erected, and other needed facilities\nsupplied. Printing-presses are to be set in operation in many parts of the\nworld.\nThe Lord\u2019s work in new territories is to be carried forward to a successful\naccomplishment. And God\u2019s plans must be followed, not the inclinations of\nthose who would gather into the section over which they have supervision,\nevery possible advantage, while the utter destitution of other parts of the\nLord\u2019s vineyard is forgotten.\nIn some conferences it has been considered commendable to save up\nmeans, and to show a large\n456\nsurplus in the treasury. But in this God has not been honored. It would have\nbeen better if the money thus laid by had been wisely expended in supporting\ndiligent, ef\ufb01cient laborers in needy \ufb01elds.\nIn their efforts to economize, our brethren should be careful lest they\nrestrict the investment of means where wise investment is needed. In\nestablishing schools and sanitariums, enough land should be purchased to\nprovide for the carrying out of the plans that the Lord has outlined for these\ninstitutions. Provision should be made for the raising of fruit and vegetables,\nand, wherever possible, suf\ufb01cient land should be secured so that others may\nnot erect, near the institution, buildings of an objectionable character.\nSometimes, when a work has been brought to a certain stage of\ndevelopment, and those who have labored earnestly in its behalf have called\nfor further needed help, they have been repulsed, and have not been given\nthe advantages that would have made their work effective. This has brought\ndiscouragement to their hearts, and has hindered the cause of God. Those who\nhave been fearful of undertaking work in the great cities, because it means\nearnest labor and the investment of means, need to understand the magnitude\nof the gift that the Lord made in giving His Son to save the world. Our cities\nmay be worked if men will trust in God, and labor earnestly and unsel\ufb01shly.\n457\nEconomy in Mission Work\nLaborers for God must work with intelligence, frugality, and humility.\nThere are those who undertake too much, and by so doing accomplish little.\nOur efforts must be more concentrated. Every stroke must tell. The mind\nmust be active to discern the best ways and means of reaching the people near\nus. In an effort to do a work at a distance from us, we often let opportunities\nwithin our reach slip away. Thus time and means are lost in both places.\nOur missionary workers must learn to economize. The largest reservoir,\nthough fed by abundant and living springs, will fail to supply the demand if\nthere are leakages which drain off the supply. It must not be left for one man\nto decide whether a certain \ufb01eld will warrant large efforts. If the workers in\none \ufb01eld so fashion the work as to incur large expenses, they are barring the\nway so that other important \ufb01elds\u2014\ufb01elds which perhaps would better warrant\nthe outlay\u2014cannot be entered.\nOur younger laborers must be content to work their way among the people\nslowly and surely, under the advice of those who have had more experience.\nThe ideas of many are too high. A more humble manner of working would\nshow good results. It is encouraging to see the young enter the missionary\n\ufb01eld, enlisting all their ardor and zeal in the work; but they must not be left to\nmanage for themselves, and keep the cause of God weighed down with debt.\nAll should strive by wise management and earnest labor to gather enough to\npay their own expenses. They\n458\nshould labor to make the cause self-sustaining, and should teach the people\nto rely upon themselves.\nOur ministers should not feel at liberty to pay large sums for halls in\nwhich to hold meetings, when they do not feel the burden of following up the\ninterest by personal labor. The results are too uncertain to warrant the using\nof means so rapidly. If churches and halls are opened to any of the laborers,\nand there is a desire to hear, they should embrace the opportunity, and do the\nbest they can; but it is not wisdom for a single individual to strike out as if he\nhad some great talent, as if he were a Moody or a Sankey, and make a lavish\noutlay of means.\nIn sending missionaries to foreign countries, we should select those who\nknow how to economize, who have not large families, and who, realizing the\nshortness of time and the great work to be accomplished, will keep themselves\nas free as possible from everything that would divert their minds from the one\ngreat work. The wife, if devoted and left free to do so, can, by standing by the\nside of her husband, accomplish as much as he. We want missionaries who\nare missionaries in the fullest sense of the word, who will put aside sel\ufb01sh\nconsiderations, and let the cause of God come \ufb01rst; and who, working with\nan eye single to His glory, will keep themselves as minutemen, ready to go\nwhere He bids, and to work in any capacity to spread the knowledge of the\ntruth. Men who have wives who love and fear God, and who can help their\nhusbands in the work, are needed in the work, are needed in the missionary\n\ufb01eld.\nOur laborers must learn to exercise economy, not only in their efforts to\nadvance the cause of truth,\n459\nbut in their home expenses. They should place their families where they can\nbe cared for at as little expense as possible. Donations and bequests do not\ncome to our work as they do to other denominations; and those who have not\neducated themselves to live within their means, will surely have to do this,\nor else engage in some other employment. Habits of self-indulgence, or a\nwant of tact and skill on the part of the wife and mother, may be a constant\ndrain upon the treasury; and yet that mother may think she is doing her best,\nbecause she has never been taught to restrict her wants or the wants of her\nchildren, and has never acquired skill and tact in household matters. Hence\none family may require for its support twice the amount that would suf\ufb01ce for\nanother family of the same size.\nAll should learn how to keep accounts. Some neglect this work as\nnon-essential; but this is wrong. All expenses should be accurately stated.\nThis is something that many of our laborers will have to learn.\nThe Lord is not pleased with the present lack of order and accuracy among\nthose who do business in connection with His work. Even in the business\nmeetings of the conference, much time could be saved and many mistakes\navoided, by a little more study and punctuality. Everything that bears any\nrelation to the work of God should be as nearly perfect as human brains and\nhands can make it. *****\nAs laborers together with God, you should come close to one another.\nLessons of love, con\ufb01dence,\n460\nrespect for one another, must be given, both in and out of the desk. You must\nlive that which you teach. Remember that new converts look to you for an\nexample.\nSome for whom you labor will wish to have the work done in their own\nway, thinking that their way is best; but if you have the spirit and the meekness\nof Christ, if you show respect and love for one another, God will enable you\nto perfect the work in a manner that will please Him. Work for your own souls\nuntil self is subdued, until Christ recognizes His image in you. This will be\nthe most impressive lesson that you can give to those whom you educate.\nIn foreign \ufb01elds, especially, the work cannot be accomplished except\nby well-considered plans. While you should endeavor to labor in harmony\nwith the instructions of those at the head of the work, many unforeseen\ncircumstances will arise for which they could make no provision. There must\nbe something ventured, some risks taken, by those on the \ufb01eld of battle. There\nwill be crises in which prompt action is necessary.\nWhen missions are opened in foreign lands, it is of special importance\nthat the work be started right. The laborers should be careful that they do\nnot restrict it by narrow plans. While the state of the treasury demands that\neconomy be exercised, there is danger of an economy which results in loss\nrather than gain. This has actually been the case in some of our missions,\nwhere the workers have bent their powers almost wholly to planning how to\nget along in the least expensive manner. With different management, far more\nmight have been accomplished;\n461\nand on the whole less means would have been taken from the treasury.\nIn new \ufb01elds our growth has been slow, because the special truths which\nwe present are not popular with the world. The observance of the seventh-day\nSabbath is a heavy cross for every one who accepts the truth. Many who can\nsee that our doctrines are sustained by the Scriptures, shrink from accepting\nthem, because they do not wish to be peculiar, or because by obedience to\nthe truth they would be cut off from their means of support. Because of these\nthings, much wisdom is needed in planning how to bring the truth before the\npeople.\nIn some places the work must begin in a small way, and advance slowly.\nThis is all that the laborers can do. But in many cases a wider and more\ndecided effort might be made at the outset, with good results. The work in\nEngland might now be much farther advanced than it is if our brethren, at\nthe beginning of the work there, had not tried to work in so cheap a way.\nIf they had hired good halls, and carried forward the work as though we\nhad great truths, which would surely be victorious, they would have had\ngreater success. God would have the work started in such a way that the\n\ufb01rst impressions given shall be, as far as they go, the very best that can be\nmade.\nBe careful to maintain the elevated character of the missionary work.\nLet all connected with our missions, both men and women, be constantly\ninquiring, \u201cWhat am I? and what ought I to be and to do?\u201d Let all remember\nthat they cannot give to others what they themselves do not possess; therefore\n462\nthey should not settle down content with their natural ways and habits,\nseeking to make no change for the better. Paul says, \u201cI press toward the\nmark.\u201d [Philippians 3:14.] There must be constant reformation, unceasing\nadvancement, if we would perfect a symmetrical character. *****\nThe Lord wants men who see the work in its greatness, and who\nunderstand the principles that have been interwoven with it from its rise.\nHe will not have a worldly order of things come in to fashion the work in\naltogether different lines from those He has marked out for His people. The\nwork must bear the character of its Originator.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n7:209. *****\nIn establishing the work in new places, economize in every possible way.\nGather up the fragments; let nothing be lost. The work of soul-saving must\nbe carried on in the way that Christ has marked out. He declares, \u201cIf any man\nwill come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow\nMe.\u201d [Matthew 16:24.] Only by obeying this word can we be His disciples.\nWe are nearing the end of this earth\u2019s history, and the different lines of God\u2019s\nwork are to be carried forward with much more self-sacri\ufb01ce than has yet\nbeen manifested.\u2014 Idem, pages 239, 240.\n463\nThe Regions Beyond\nThe church of Christ was organized for missionary purposes. Christian\nmissionary work furnishes the church with a sure foundation, a foundation\nhaving this seal, \u201cThe Lord knoweth them that are His.\u201d [2 Timothy 2:19.] By\nit the members are inspired with zeal to deny self, to put forth self-sacri\ufb01cing\nefforts to send the truth to the regions beyond. It has a salutary in\ufb02uence upon\nunbelievers; for as the workers labor under divine supervision, worldlings are\nled to see the greatness of the resources that God has provided for those who\nserve Him. We are laid under a most solemn obligation to furnish, in Christian\nmissions, an illustration of the principles of the kingdom of God. The church\nis to work actively, as an organized body, to spread abroad the in\ufb02uence of\nthe cross of Christ.\nGod is calling for men who are willing to leave all to become missionaries\nfor Him. And the call will be answered. In every age since the advent of\nChrist, the gospel commission has impelled men and women to go to the ends\nof the earth to carry the good news of salvation to those in darkness. Stirred\nby the love of Christ and the needs of the lost, men have left the comforts\nof home and the society of friends, even that of wife and children, to go\nto foreign lands, among idolaters and savages, to proclaim the message of\nmercy. Many in the attempt have lost their lives, but others have been raised\nup to carry on the work. Thus step by step the cause of Christ has progressed,\nand the seed sown in sorrow has yielded a bountiful\n464\nharvest. The knowledge of God has been extended, and the banner of the\ncross planted in heathen lands.\nThere is nothing more precious in the sight of God than His ministers,\nwho go forth into the waste places of the earth to sow the seeds of truth,\nlooking forward to the harvest. None but Christ can measure the solicitude of\nHis servants, as they seek for the lost. He imparts His Spirit to them, and by\ntheir efforts souls are led to turn from sin to righteousness.\nFor the conversion of one sinner, the minister should tax his resources to\nthe utmost. The soul that God has created and Christ has redeemed is of great\nvalue, because of the possibilities before it, the spiritual advantages that have\nbeen granted it, the capabilities that it may possess if vitalized by the word\nof God, and the immortality that it may gain through the hope presented in\nthe gospel. And if Christ left the ninety and nine that He might seek and save\none lost sheep, can we be justi\ufb01ed in doing less? Is not a neglect to work as\nChrist worked, to sacri\ufb01ce as He sacri\ufb01ced, a betrayal of sacred trust?\nI feel intensely over the needs of foreign countries, as they have been\npresented before me. In all parts of the world angels of God are opening\ndoors that a little while ago were closed to the message of truth. From India,\nfrom Africa, from China, and from many other places is heard the cry, \u201cCome\nover and help us.\u201d\nTo show a liberal, self-denying spirit for the success of foreign missions is\na sure way to advance home missionary work; for the prosperity of the home\nwork depends largely, under God, upon the re\ufb02ex in\ufb02uence of the evangelical\nwork done in countries afar off. It is in working to supply the necessities of\nothers that\n465\nwe bring our souls into touch with the Source of all power. The Lord has\nmarked every phase of missionary zeal that has been shown by His people in\nbehalf of foreign \ufb01elds. He designs that in every home, in every church, and\nat all the centers of the work, a spirit of liberality shall be shown in sending\nhelp to foreign \ufb01elds, where the workers are struggling against great odds to\ngive the light to those who sit in darkness.\nThat which is given to start the work in one \ufb01eld will result in\nstrengthening the work in other places. As the laborers are freed from\n\ufb01nancial embarrassment, their efforts can be extended; and as people are\nbrought into the truth and churches are established, there will be increasing\n\ufb01nancial strength. As these churches grow stronger, they will be able not only\nto carry on the work in their own borders, but to send help to other \ufb01elds.\nHome Churches to Help\nThe members of our churches in the home \ufb01eld should carry on their\nhearts the burden for the work in regions beyond. An American business\nman, who was an earnest Christian, in conversation with a fellow-worker,\nremarked that he himself worked for Christ twenty-four hours of the day. \u201cIn\nall my business relations,\u201d he said, \u201cI try to represent my Master. As I have\nopportunity, I try to win others to Him. All day I am working for Christ. And\nat night, while I sleep, I have a man working for Him in China.\u201d\nWhy should not the members of a church, or of several small churches,\nunite to sustain a missionary\n466\nin foreign \ufb01elds? If they will deny themselves, they can do this. My brethren\nand sisters, will you not help in this great work? I beseech you to do\nsomething for Christ, and do it now. Through the teacher whom your money\nshall sustain in a foreign \ufb01eld, souls may be saved to shine as stars in the\nRedeemer\u2019s crown. However small your offering, do not hesitate to bring it\nto the Lord. If given from a heart \ufb01lled with love to the Saviour, the smallest\noffering becomes a priceless gift, which God smiles upon and blesses.\nWhen Jesus said of the widow, She \u201chath cast in more than they all,\u201d\n[Luke 21:3] His words were true, not only of the motives of the giver, but\nof the results of the gift. The \u201ctwo mites, which make a farthing,\u201d [Mark\n12:42.] have brought to God\u2019s treasury an amount of money far greater than\nthe contributions of the rich Jews. Like a stream small at its beginning, but\nwidening and deepening as it \ufb02ows toward the ocean, the in\ufb02uence of that\nlittle gift has widened and deepened as it has \ufb02owed through the ages. The\nexample of self-sacri\ufb01ce shown by the poor widow has acted and reacted\nupon thousands of hearts in every land and in every age. It has brought\nto the treasury of God gifts from the high and the low, the rich and the\npoor. It has helped to sustain missions, to establish hospitals, to feed the\nhungry, and to preach the gospel to the poor. Multitudes have been blessed\nthrough her unsel\ufb01sh deed. And in like manner every gift bestowed, every act\nperformed, with a sincere desire for God\u2019s glory, is linked with the purposes\nof Omnipotence. Its results for good no man can measure.\n467\nMethods of Labor in Foreign Fields\nAs soon as a new \ufb01eld is entered, educational work should begin, and\ninstruction should be given line upon line, precept upon precept, here a\nlittle and there a little. It is not preaching that is the most important; it is\nhouse-to-house work, reasoning from the Word, explaining the Word. It is\nthose workers who follow the methods that Christ followed who will win\nsouls for their hire. Over and over again the same truths must be repeated,\nand the worker must place his entire dependence on God. And what rich\nexperiences the teacher obtains when instructing those in darkness! He too\nis a learner, and as he explains the Scriptures to others, the Holy Spirit is\nworking in his mind and heart, giving him the bread of life for hungry souls.\nThe worker in foreign \ufb01elds will come in contact with all classes of people\nand all varieties of minds, and he will \ufb01nd that different methods of labor are\nrequired to meet the needs of the people. A sense of his own inef\ufb01ciency will\ndrive him to God and to the Bible for light and strength and knowledge.\nThe methods and means by which we reach certain ends are not always\nthe same. The missionary must use reason and judgment. Experience will\nindicate the wisest course to follow under existing circumstances. It is often\nthe case that the customs and climate of a country make a condition of things\nthat would not be tolerated in another country. Changes for the better must be\nmade, but it is best not to be too abrupt.\nLet not controversy arise over tri\ufb02es. The spirit of love and the grace of\nChrist will bind heart to heart,\n468\nif men will open the windows of the soul heavenward and close them\nearthward. By the power of the truth many dif\ufb01culties might be adjusted, and\ncontroversies hoary with age \ufb01nd quietude in the admission of better ways.\nThe great, grand principle, \u201cPeace on earth, good will toward men,\u201d will be far\nbetter practiced when those who believe in Christ are indeed laborers together\nwith God.\nHelp from Heaven\nThe worker in a foreign \ufb01eld must carry in his heart the peace and love of\nheaven; for this is his only safety. Amid perplexity and trial, discouragement\nand suffering, with the devotion of a martyr and the courage of a hero, he\nis to hold fast to the hand that never lets go, saying, \u201cI will not fail nor be\ndiscouraged.\u201d He must be a close Bible student, and should be often in prayer.\nIf, before talking with others, he will seek help from above, he may be assured\nthat angels of heaven will be with him. At times he may yearn for human\nsympathy, but in his loneliness he may \ufb01nd comfort and encouragement\nthrough communion with God. Let him be cheered by the words of the\nSaviour, \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d [Matthew\n28:20.] From this divine Companion he will receive instruction in the science\nof soul-saving.\nEnergy and self-sacri\ufb01ce are needed in the missionary \ufb01eld. God calls for\nmen who will push the triumphs of the cross; men who will persevere under\ndiscouragements and privations; men who have the zeal and resolution and\nfaith that are indispensable in the missionary \ufb01eld. By persevering toil and a\n\ufb01rm\n469\ntrust in the God of Israel, resolute, courageous men will accomplish wonders.\nThere is scarcely a limit to what may be achieved if the efforts made are\ngoverned by enlightened judgment and backed by earnest endeavor.\nLet us rejoice that work which God can approve has been done in foreign\n\ufb01elds. Let us lift our voices in praise and thanksgiving for the results of the\nwork abroad. And still our General, who never makes a mistake, says to us,\n\u201cAdvance; enter new territory; lift the standard in every land. \u2018Arise, shine;\nfor thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.\u2019 [Isaiah\n60:1.]\u201d\nThe time has come when through God\u2019s messengers the scroll is being\nunrolled to the world. The truth contained in the \ufb01rst, second, and third\nangels\u2019 messages must go to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; it\nmust lighten the darkness of every continent, and extend to the islands of the\nsea. There must be no delay in this work.\nOur watchword is to be, Onward, ever onward! Angels of heaven will go\nbefore us to prepare the way. Our burden for the regions beyond can never be\nlaid down till the whole earth is lightened with the glory of the Lord.\n470\n471\n472\nSection XI. In Relation with\nOne Another\nIn Contact with Others\nEvery association of life calls for the exercise of self-control, forbearance,\nand sympathy. We differ so widely in disposition, habits, education, that our\nways of looking at things vary. We judge differently. Our understanding of\ntruth, our ideas in regard to the conduct of life, are not in all respects the same.\nThere are no two whose experience is alike in every particular. The trials of\none are not the trials of another. The duties that one \ufb01nds light, are to another\nmost dif\ufb01cult and perplexing.\nSo frail, so ignorant, so liable to misconception is human nature, that each\nshould be careful in the estimate he places upon another. We little know the\nbearing of our acts upon the experience of others. What we do or say may\nseem to us of little moment, when, could our eyes be opened, we should see\nthat upon it depended the most important results for good or for evil.\nConsideration for Burden-Bearers\nMany have borne so few burdens, their hearts have known so little real\nanguish, they have felt so little perplexity and distress in behalf of others, that\nthey\n473\ncannot understand the work of the true burden-bearer. No more capable are\nthey of appreciating his burdens than is the child of understanding the care\nand toil of his burdened father. The child may wonder at his father\u2019s fears and\nperplexities. These appear needless to him. But when years of experience\nshall have been added to his life, when he himself comes to bear its burdens,\nhe will look back upon his father\u2019s life, and understand that which was once\nso incomprehensible. Bitter experience has given him knowledge.\nThe work of many a burden-bearer is not understood, his labors are not\nappreciated, until death lays him low. When others take up the burdens he has\nlaid down, and meet the dif\ufb01culties he encountered, they can understand how\nhis faith and courage were tested. Often then the mistakes they were so quick\nto censure are lost sight of. Experience teaches them sympathy. God permits\nmen to be placed in positions of responsibility. When they err, He has power\nto correct or to remove them. We should be careful not to take into our hands\nthe work of judging that belongs to God....\nThe Saviour bids us, \u201cJudge not, that ye be not judged. For with what\njudgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it\nshall be measured to you again.\u201d [Matthew 7:1, 2.] Remember that soon your\nlife record will pass in review before God. Remember, too, that He has said,\n\u201cThou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: ...for thou\nthat judgest doest the same things.\u201d [Romans 2:1.]\n474\nForbearance Under Wrong\nWe cannot afford to let our spirits chafe over any real or supposed wrong\ndone to ourselves. Self is the enemy we most need to fear. No form of vice has\na more baleful effect upon the character than has human passion not under the\ncontrol of the Holy Spirit. No other victory we can gain will be so precious\nas the victory gained over self.\nWe should not allow our feelings to be easily wounded. We are to live,\nnot to guard our feelings or our reputation, but to save souls. As we become\ninterested in the salvation of souls, we cease to mind the little differences\nthat so often arise in our association with one another. Whatever others may\nthink of us, it need not disturb our oneness with Christ, the fellowship of the\nSpirit. \u201cWhat glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take\nit patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this\nis acceptable with God.\u201d [1 Peter 2:20.]\nDo not retaliate. So far as you can do so, remove all cause for\nmisapprehension. Avoid the appearance of evil. Do all that lies in your power,\nwithout the sacri\ufb01ce of principle, to conciliate others. \u201cIf thou bring thy gift\nto the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee;\nleave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; \ufb01rst be reconciled to thy\nbrother, and then come and offer thy gift.\u201d [Matthew 5:23, 24.]\nIf impatient words are spoken to you, never reply in the same spirit.\nRemember that \u201ca soft answer turneth away wrath.\u201d [Proverbs 15:1.] And\nthere is wonderful power in silence. Words spoken in reply to one who is\nangry\n475\nsometimes serve only to exasperate; but anger met with silence, in a tender,\nforbearing spirit, quickly dies away.\nUnder a storm of stinging fault\ufb01nding words, keep the mind stayed upon\nthe word of God. Let mind and heart be stored with God\u2019s promises. If you\nare ill-treated or wrongfully accused, instead of returning an angry answer,\nrepeat to yourself the precious promises:\n\u201cBe not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.\u201d [Romans 12:21.]\n\u201cCommit thy way unto the Lord: trust also in Him; and He shall bring\nit to pass. And He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy\njudgment as the noon-day.\u201d [Psalm 37:5, 6.]\n\u201cThere is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall\nnot be known.\u201d [Luke 12:2.]\n\u201cThou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through \ufb01re and\nthrough water: but Thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.\u201d [Psalm\n66:12.]\nWe are prone to look to our fellow-men for sympathy and uplifting,\ninstead of looking to Jesus. In His mercy and faithfulness, God often permits\nthose in whom we place con\ufb01dence to fail us, in order that we may learn\nthe folly of trusting in man, and making \ufb02esh our arm. Let us trust fully,\nhumbly, unsel\ufb01shly, in God. He knows the sorrows that we feel to the depths\nof our being, but which we cannot express. When all things seem dark and\nunexplainable, remember the words of Christ, \u201cWhat I do thou knowest not\nnow; but thou shalt know hereafter.\u201d [John 13:7.]\n476\nStudy the history of Joseph and of Daniel. The Lord did not prevent the\nplottings of men who sought to do them harm; but He caused all these devices\nto work for good to His servants, who amid trial and con\ufb02ict preserved their\nfaith and loyalty.\nSo long as we are in the world, we shall meet with adverse in\ufb02uences.\nThere will be provocations to test the temper; and it is by meeting these in\na right spirit that the Christian graces are developed. If Christ dwells in us,\nwe shall be patient, kind, and forbearing, cheerful amid frets and irritations.\nDay by day and year by year we shall conquer self, and grow into a noble\nheroism. This is our allotted task; but it cannot be accomplished without help\nfrom Jesus, resolute decision, unwavering purpose, continual watchfulness,\nand unceasing prayer. Each one has a personal battle to \ufb01ght. Not even\nGod can make our characters noble or our lives useful, unless we become\nco-workers with Him. Those who decline the struggle lose the strength and\njoy of victory.\nWe need not keep our own record of trials and dif\ufb01culties, griefs, and\nsorrows. All these things are written in the books, and heaven will take care\nof them. While we are counting up the disagreeable things, many things that\nare pleasing to re\ufb02ect upon are passing from memory; such as the merciful\nkindness of God surrounding us every moment, and the love over which\nangels marvel, that God gave His Son to die for us. If as workers for Christ\nyou feel that you have had greater cares and trials than have fallen to the lot\nof others, remember that for you there is a peace unknown to those who shun\nthese burdens.\n477\nThere is comfort and joy in the service of Christ. Let the world see that life\nwith Him is no failure.\nIf you do not feel light-hearted and joyous, do not talk of your feelings.\nCast no shadow upon the lives of others. A cold, sunless religion never\ndraws souls to Christ. It drives them away from Him, into the nets that\nSatan has spread for the feet of the straying. Instead of thinking of your\ndiscouragements, think of the power you can claim in Christ\u2019s name. Let your\nimagination take hold upon things unseen. Let your thoughts be directed to\nthe evidences of the great love of God for you. Faith can endure trial, resist\ntemptation, bear up under disappointment. Jesus lives as our advocate. All is\nours that His mediation secures.\nThink you not that Christ values those who live wholly for Him? Think\nyou not that He visits those who, like the beloved John in exile, are for His\nsake in hard and trying places? God will not suffer one of His true-hearted\nworkers to be left alone, to struggle against great odds and be overcome. He\npreserves as a precious jewel every one whose life is hid with Christ in Him.\nOf every such one He says: \u201cI ...will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen\nthee.\u201d [Haggai 2:23.]\nThen talk of the promises; talk of Jesus\u2019 willingness to bless. He does\nnot forget us for one brief moment. When, notwithstanding disagreeable\ncircumstances, we rest con\ufb01dingly in His love and shut ourselves in with\nHim, the sense of His presence will inspire a deep, tranquil joy. Of Himself\nChrist said: \u201cI do nothing of Myself; but as My Father hath taught Me, I speak\nthese things. And He that sent Me is with Me: the Father hath not left Me\nalone; for I do always those things that please Him.\u201d [John 8:28, 29.]\n478\nCultivate the habit of speaking well of others. Dwell upon the good\nqualities of those with whom you associate, and see as little as possible of\ntheir errors and failings. When tempted to complain of what some one has\nsaid or done, praise something in that person\u2019s life or character. Cultivate\nthankfulness. Praise God for His wonderful love in giving Christ to die for\nus. It never pays to think of our grievances. God calls upon us to think of His\nmercy and His matchless love, that we may be inspired with praise.\nEarnest workers have no time for dwelling upon the faults of others. We\ncannot afford to live on the husks of others\u2019 faults or failings. Evil-speaking is\na twofold curse, falling more heavily upon the speaker than upon the hearer.\nHe who scatters the seeds of dissension and strife, reaps in his own soul the\ndeadly fruits. The very act of looking for evil in others develops evil in those\nwho look. By dwelling upon the faults of others, we are changed into the\nsame image. But by beholding Jesus, talking of His love and perfection of\ncharacter, we become changed into His image. By contemplating the lofty\nideal He has placed before us, we shall be uplifted into a pure and holy\natmosphere, even the presence of God. When we abide here, there goes forth\nfrom us a light that irradiates all who are connected with us.\nInstead of criticizing and condemning others, say, \u201cI must work out my\nown salvation. If I co-operate with Him who desires to save my soul, I must\nwatch myself diligently. I must put away every evil from my life. I must\novercome every fault. I must become a new creature in Christ. Then, instead\nof\n479\nweakening those who are striving against evil, I can strengthen them by\nencouraging words.\u201d\nWe are too indifferent in regard to one another. Too often we forget that\nour fellow-laborers are in need of strength and cheer. Take care to assure\nthem of your interest and sympathy. Help them by your prayers, and let them\nknow that you do it.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 483-493. *****\nAll who profess to be children of God should bear in mind that as\nmissionaries they will be brought into contact with all classes of minds. There\nare the re\ufb01ned and the coarse, the humble and the proud, the religious and the\nskeptical, the educated and the ignorant, the rich and the poor. These varied\nminds cannot be treated alike; yet all need kindness and sympathy. By mutual\ncontact our minds should receive polish and re\ufb01nement. We are dependent\nupon one another, closely bound together by the ties of human brotherhood....\nIt is through the social relations that Christianity comes in contact with\nthe world. Every man or woman who has received the divine illumination\nis to shed light on the dark pathway of those who are unacquainted with the\nbetter way. Social power, sancti\ufb01ed by the Spirit of Christ, must be improved\nin bringing souls to the Saviour. Christ is not to be hid away in the heart as a\ncoveted treasure, sacred and sweet, to be enjoyed solely by the possessor. We\nare to have Christ in us as a well of water, springing up into everlasting life,\nrefreshing all who come in contact with us.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 495,\n496.\n480\nVaried Gifts\nThe Lord does not apportion to any one man some special territory in\nwhich he alone is to labor. This is contrary to His plan. He designs that\nin every place where the truth is introduced, different minds, different gifts,\nshall be brought in to exert an in\ufb02uence upon the work. No one man has\nsuf\ufb01cient wisdom to manage an interest without helpers, and no one should\nthink himself competent to do so. The fact that a person has ability in one\ndirection, is no evidence that his judgment on all other subjects is perfect,\nand that the wisdom of some other mind does not need to be united with his.\nThose who do labor together should seek to be in perfect harmony. And\nyet no one should feel that he cannot labor with those who do not see just as\nhe sees, and who do not in their labors follow just his plans. If all manifest\na humble, teachable spirit, there need be no dif\ufb01culty. God has set in the\nchurch different gifts. These are precious in their proper places, and all may\nact a part in the work of preparing a people for Christ\u2019s soon coming. *****\nOur ministers in responsible places are men whom God has accepted. No\nmatter what their origin, no matter what their former position, whether they\nfollowed the plow, worked at the carpenter\u2019s trade, or enjoyed the discipline\nof a college; if God has accepted them, let every man beware of casting the\nslightest re\ufb02ection upon them. Never speak disparagingly of any man; for he\nmay be great in the sight of the Lord,\n481\nwhile those who feel great may be lightly esteemed of God because of the\nperversity of their hearts....\nNot one moment of our precious time should be devoted to bringing others\nto conform to our personal ideas and opinions. God would educate men\nengaged as co-laborers in this great work, to the highest exercise of faith,\nand the development of a harmonious character.\nMen have varied gifts, and some are better adapted to one branch of the\nwork than another. What one man would fail to do, his brother minister may\nbe strong to accomplish. The work of each in his position is important. One\nman\u2019s mind is not to control that of another. If one man stands up, feeling that\nno one shall in\ufb02uence him, that he has judgment and ability to comprehend\nevery branch of the work, that man will fail of the grace of God.\u2014Testimonies\nfor the Church4:608, 609. *****\nIt is the faithfulness, the loyalty to God, the loving service, that wins the\ndivine approval. Every impulse of the Holy Spirit leading men to goodness\nand to God, is noted in the books of heaven, and in the day of God the workers\nthrough whom He has wrought will be commended. They will enter into the\njoy of the Lord as they see in His kingdom those who have been redeemed\nthrough their instrumentality. And they are privileged to participate in His\nwork there, because they have gained a \ufb01tness for it by participation in His\nwork here. What we shall be in heaven is the re\ufb02ection of what we are now\nin character and holy service.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 361.\n482\nUnity in Diversity\nGod has different ways of working, and He has different workmen to\nwhom He entrusts varied gifts. One worker may be a ready speaker; another\na ready writer; another may have the gift of sincere, earnest, fervent prayer;\nanother the gift of singing; another may have special power to explain the\nword of God with clearness. And each gift is to become a power for God,\nbecause He works with the laborer. To one God gives the word of wisdom, to\nanother knowledge, to another faith; but all are to work under the same Head.\nThe diversity of gifts leads to a diversity of operations; but \u201cit is the same\nGod which worketh all in all.\u201d [1 Corinthians 12:6.]\nThe Lord desires His chosen servants to learn how to unite in harmonious\neffort. It may seem to some that the contrast between their gifts and the gifts\nof a fellow-laborer is too great to allow them to unite in harmonious effort;\nbut when they remember that there are varied minds to be reached, and that\nsome will reject the truth as it is presented by one laborer, only to open their\nhearts to God\u2019s truth as it is presented in a different manner by another laborer,\nthey will hopefully endeavor to labor together in unity. Their talents, however\ndiverse, may all be under the control of the same Spirit. In every word and\nact, kindness and love will be revealed; and as each worker \ufb01lls his appointed\nplace faithfully, the prayer of Christ for the unity of His followers will be\nanswered, and the world will know that these are His disciples.\n483\nIn loving sympathy and con\ufb01dence God\u2019s workers are to unite with one\nanother. He who says or does anything that tends to separate the members\nof Christ\u2019s church, is counterworking the Lord\u2019s purpose. Wrangling and\ndissension in the church, the encouragement of suspicion and unbelief,\nare dishonoring to Christ. God desires His servants to cultivate Christian\naffection for one another. True religion unites hearts, not only with Christ,\nbut with one another, in a most tender union. When we know what it means\nto be thus united with Christ, and with our brethren, a fragrant in\ufb02uence will\nattend our work wherever we go.\nThe workers in the large cities must act their several parts, making every\neffort to bring about the best results. They are to talk faith and to act in such a\nway as to impress the people. They are not to narrow the work down to their\nown particular ideas. In the past too much of this has been done by us as a\npeople, and it has been a drawback to the success of the work....\nNo human being is to seek to bind other human beings to himself, as if he\nwere to control them, telling them to do this, and forbidding them to do that,\ncommanding, dictating, acting like an of\ufb01cer over a company of soldiers.\nThis is the way the priests and rulers did in Christ\u2019s day, but it is not the\nright way. After the truth has made the impression upon hearts, and men and\nwomen have accepted its teachings, they are to be treated as the property of\nChrist, not as the property of man. In fastening minds to yourself, you lead\nthem to disconnect from the Source of their wisdom and suf\ufb01ciency. Their\ndependence must be wholly in God; only thus can they grow in grace.\n484\nHowever large may be a man\u2019s claim to knowledge and wisdom, unless he\nis under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, he is exceedingly ignorant of spiritual\nthings. He needs to realize his danger and his inef\ufb01ciency, and to place entire\ndependence upon the One who alone is able to keep the souls committed to\nHis trust, able to imbue them with His Spirit, and to \ufb01ll them with unsel\ufb01sh\nlove for one another, thus enabling them to bear witness that God has sent His\nSon into the world to save sinners. Those who are truly converted will press\ntogether in Christian unity. Let there be no division in the church of God, no\nunwise authority exercised over those who accept the truth. The meekness of\nChrist is to appear in all that is said and done.\nChrist is the foundation of every true church. We have His unalterable\npromise that His presence and protection will be given to His faithful ones\nwho walk in His counsel. To the end of time Christ is to be \ufb01rst. He is the\nsource of life and strength, of righteousness and holiness. And He is all this\nto those who wear His yoke and learn of Him how to be meek and lowly.\nThe duty and delight of all service is to uplift Christ before the people.\nThis is the end of all true labor. Let Christ appear; let self be hidden behind\nHim. This is self-sacri\ufb01ce that is of worth.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n9:144-147.\n485\nThe Spirit of Independence\nBefore leaving Australia, and since coming to this country, I have been\ninstructed that there is a great work to be done in America. Those who were\nin the work at the beginning are passing away. Only a few of the pioneers of\nthe cause now remain among us. Many of the heavy burdens formerly borne\nby men of long experience, are now falling upon younger men.\nThis transfer of responsibilities to laborers whose experience is more\nor less limited, is attended with some dangers against which we need to\nguard. The world is \ufb01lled with strife for the supremacy. The spirit of pulling\naway from fellow-laborers, the spirit of disorganization, is in the very air we\nbreathe. By some, all efforts to establish order are regarded as dangerous,\u2014as\na restriction of personal liberty, and hence to be feared as popery. These\ndeceived souls regard it a virtue to boast of their freedom to think and act\nindependently. They declare that they will not take any man\u2019s say-so; that\nthey are amenable to no man. I have been instructed that it is Satan\u2019s special\neffort to lead men to feel that God is pleased to have them choose their own\ncourse, independent of the counsel of their brethren.\nHerein lies a grave danger to the prosperity of our work. We must move\ndiscreetly, sensibly, in harmony with the judgment of God-fearing counselors;\nfor in this course alone lies our safety and strength. Otherwise God cannot\nwork with us and by us and for us.\n486\nO how Satan would rejoice if he could succeed in his efforts to get\nin among this people, and disorganize the work at a time when thorough\norganization is essential, and will be the greatest power to keep out spurious\nuprisings, and to refute claims not endorsed by the word of God! We want to\nhold the lines evenly, that there shall be no breaking down of the system of\norganization and order that has been built up by wise, careful labor. License\nmust not be given to disorderly elements that desire to control the work at this\ntime.\nSome have advanced the thought that as we near the close of time, every\nchild of God will act independently of any religious organization. But I\nhave been instructed by the Lord that in this work there is no such thing as\nevery man\u2019s being independent. The stars of heaven are all under law, each\nin\ufb02uencing the other to do the will of God, yielding their common obedience\nto the law that controls their action. And, in order that the Lord\u2019s work may\nadvance healthfully and solidly, His people must draw together.\nThe spasmodic, \ufb01tful movements of some who claim to be Christians are\nwell represented by the work of strong but untrained horses. When one pulls\nforward, another pulls back; at the voice of their master one plunges ahead,\nand the other stands immovable. If men will not move in concert in the great\nand grand work for this time, there will be confusion. It is not a good sign\nwhen men refuse to unite with their brethren, and prefer to act alone. Let\nlaborers take into their con\ufb01dence the brethren who are free to point out every\ndeparture from right principles.\n487\nIf men wear the yoke of Christ, they cannot pull apart; they will draw with\nChrist.\nSome workers pull with all the power that God has given them, but they\nhave not yet learned that they should not pull alone. Instead of isolating\nthemselves, let them draw in harmony with their fellow-laborers. Unless they\ndo this, their activity will work at the wrong time and in the wrong way. They\nwill often work counter to that which God would have done, and thus their\nwork is worse than wasted.\nOn the other hand, the leaders among God\u2019s people are to guard against\nthe danger of condemning the methods of individual workers who are led by\nthe Lord to do a special work that but few are \ufb01tted to do. Let brethren in\nresponsibility be slow to criticize movements that are not in perfect harmony\nwith their methods of labor. Let them never suppose that every plan should\nre\ufb02ect their own personality. Let them not fear to trust another\u2019s methods; for\nby withholding their con\ufb01dence from a brother laborer who, with humility\nand consecrated zeal, is doing a special work in God\u2019s appointed way, they\nare retarding the advancement of the Lord\u2019s cause.\nGod can and will use those who have not had a thorough education in the\nschools of men. A doubt of His power to do this, is manifest unbelief; it is\nlimiting the omnipotent power of the One with whom nothing is impossible.\nO for less of this uncalled-for, distrustful caution! It leaves so many forces\nof the church unused; it closes up the way, so that the Holy Spirit cannot\nuse men; it keeps in idleness those who are willing and anxious to labor in\nChrist\u2019s lines; it discourages from entering the work many who would\n488\nbecome ef\ufb01cient laborers together with God, if they were given a fair chance.\nTo the prophet, the wheel within a wheel, the appearance of living\ncreatures connected with them, all seemed intricate and unexplainable. But\nthe hand of In\ufb01nite Wisdom is seen among the wheels, and perfect order\nis the result of its work. Every wheel, directed by the hand of God, works\nin perfect harmony with every other wheel. I have been shown that human\ninstrumentalities are liable to seek after too much power, and try to control the\nwork themselves. They leave the Lord God, the mighty Worker, too much out\nof their methods and plans, and do not trust to Him everything in regard to the\nadvancement of the work. No one should for a moment fancy that he is able\nto manage those things that belong to the great I AM. God in His providence\nis preparing a way so that the work may be done by human agents. Then let\nevery man stand at his post of duty, to act his part for this time, and know that\nGod is his instructor.\nThe General Conference\nI have often been instructed by the Lord that no man\u2019s judgment should\nbe surrendered to the judgment of any other one man. Never should the mind\nof one man or the minds of a few men be regarded as suf\ufb01cient in wisdom\nand power to control the work, and to say what plans shall be followed. But\nwhen, in a General Conference, the judgment of the brethren assembled from\nall parts of the \ufb01eld, is exercised, private independence and private judgment\nmust not be stubbornly maintained, but surrendered. Never should a laborer\nregard as a virtue the persistent\n489\nmaintenance of his position of independence, contrary to the decision of the\ngeneral body.\nAt times, when a small group of men entrusted with the general\nmanagement of the work have, in the name of the General Conference, sought\nto carry out unwise plans and to restrict God\u2019s work, I have said that I could no\nlonger regard the voice of the General Conference, represented by these few\nmen, as the voice of God. But this is not saying that the decisions of a General\nConference composed of an assembly of duly appointed, representative men\nfrom all parts of the \ufb01eld, should not be respected. God has ordained that the\nrepresentatives of His church from all parts of the earth, when assembled in a\nGeneral Conference, shall have authority. The error that some are in danger\nof committing, is in giving to the mind and judgment of one man, or of a\nsmall group of men, the full measure of authority and in\ufb02uence that God has\nvested in His church, in the judgment and voice of the General Conference\nassembled to plan for the prosperity and advancement of His work.\nWhen this power, which God has placed in the church, is accredited\nwholly to one man, and he is invested with the authority to be judgment for\nother minds, then the true Bible order is changed. Satan\u2019s efforts upon such\na man\u2019s mind would be most subtle, and sometimes well-nigh overpowering;\nfor the enemy would hope that through his mind he could affect many others.\nLet us give to the highest organized authority in the church that which we are\nprone to give to one man or to a small group of men.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:257-261.\n490\nConsideration for Those Struggling with\nDif\ufb01culties\nFor years a lack of wisdom has been shown in dealing with men who\ntake up and carry forward the Lord\u2019s work in dif\ufb01cult places. Often these\nmen labor far beyond their strength. They have little money to invest for\nthe advancement of the work, and they are obliged to sacri\ufb01ce in order to\ncarry the work forward. They work for small wages, and practice the strictest\neconomy. They make appeals to the people for means, and they themselves\nset an example of liberality. They give God the praise for what is done,\nrealizing that He is the author and the \ufb01nisher of their faith, and that it is\nby His power that they are enabled to make progress.\nSometimes, after these workers have borne the burden and the heat of\nthe day, and by patient, persevering effort have established a school or a\nsanitarium, or some other interest for the advancement of the work, the\ndecision is made by their brethren that some other man might do better, and\ntherefore that he is to take charge of the work they have been doing. In some\ncases the decision is made without giving due consideration and due credit to\nthose who have borne the disagreeable part of the work, who have labored,\nand prayed, and striven, putting into their efforts all their strength and energy.\nGod is not pleased with this way of dealing with His workers. He calls\nupon His people to hold up the hands of those who build up the work in new\nand dif\ufb01cult\n491\nplaces, speaking to them words of cheer and encouragement.\nIn their ardor, their zeal for the advancement of the cause, these workers\nmay make mistakes. They may, in their desire to get means for the support\nof needy enterprises, enter into projects that are not for the best good of the\nwork. The Lord, seeing that these projects would divert them from what He\ndesires them to do, permits disappointment to come upon them, crushing their\nhopes. Money is sacri\ufb01ced, and this is a great grief to those who had fondly\nhoped to gain means for the support of the cause.\nWhile the workers were straining every nerve to raise means to help\nthem over an emergency, some of their brethren were standing by, criticizing\nand surmising evil, putting a prejudicial construction on the motives of the\nheavily burdened laborers, and making their work more dif\ufb01cult. Blinded\nby sel\ufb01shness, these fault\ufb01nders did not discern that their brethren were\nsuf\ufb01ciently af\ufb02icted without the censure of men who had not borne heavy\nburdens and responsibilities. Disappointment is a great trial, but Christian\nlove can turn the defeat into victory. Reverses will teach caution. We learn\nby the things we suffer. Thus we gain experience.\nLet care and wisdom be shown in dealing with workers who, though\nthey have made mistakes, have manifested an earnest, self-sacri\ufb01cing interest\nin the work. Let their brethren say, \u201cWe will not make matters worse by\nputting another in your place, without giving you opportunity to retrieve\nyour mistake, and to stand on vantage-ground, free from the burden of unjust\ncriticism.\u201d Let them be given time to\n492\nadjust themselves, to overcome the dif\ufb01culties surrounding them, and to stand\nbefore angels and men as worthy workers. They have made mistakes, but\nwould those who have questioned and criticized have done better? To the\naccusing Pharisees Christ said, \u201cHe that is without sin among you, let him\n\ufb01rst cast a stone.\u201d [John 8:7.]\nThere are those who are premature in their desire to reform things that to\nthem appear faulty. They think that they should be chosen to take the place\nof those who have made mistakes. They undervalue what these workers have\ndone while others were looking on and criticizing. By their actions they say:\n\u201cI can do great things. I can carry the work forward successfully.\u201d To those\nwho think they know so well how to avoid mistakes, I am instructed to say,\n\u201cJudge not, that ye be not judged.\u201d [Matthew 7:1.] You might avoid mistakes\non some points, but on other things you are liable to make grave blunders,\nwhich would be very dif\ufb01cult to remedy, and which would bring confusion\ninto the work. These mistakes might do more harm than those your brethren\nhave made.\nThe instruction given me is that the men who lay the foundation of a work,\nand who, in the face of prejudice, \ufb01ght their way forward, are not to be placed\nin an unfavorable light, in order that others may take their places. There are\nearnest workers who, in spite of the criticisms of some of their brethren, have\nmoved forward in the work that God said should be done. Should they now be\nremoved from their position of responsibility, an impression would be made\nthat would be unjust to them, and unfavorable to the work,\n493\nbecause the changes made would be looked upon as a justi\ufb01cation of the\nunjust criticisms made and the prejudice existing. The Lord desires that no\nmove shall be made which would do injustice to those who have labored long\nand earnestly to build up the work given them.\nMany changes are made that might better never be made. Often, when\nworkers become discontented, instead of being encouraged to stay where they\nare and make a success of their work, they are sent to another place. But\nthey take with them the same traits of character that in the past have marred\ntheir work. They will manifest the same unchristlike spirit; for they have not\nlearned the lesson of patient, humble service.\nI plead for a different order of things. Changes must be made in the\ngroups of workers in our conferences and institutions. Men of ef\ufb01ciency\nand consecration must be sought for and encouraged to connect with the\nburden-bearers as helpers and co-laborers. Let there be a harmonious union\nof the new and the old, in the spirit of brotherly love. But let not changes\nof management be made abruptly, in such a way as to bring discouragement\nto those who have labored earnestly and successfully to bring the work to a\ndegree of progress. God will not sanction anything done to discourage His\nfaithful servants. Let the principles of justice be followed by those whose\nduty it is to secure the most ef\ufb01cient management for our publishing houses,\nour sanitariums, and our schools.\nGod calls for workers. The cause needs men who are self-made, who,\nplacing themselves in the hands of the Lord as humble learners, have proved\n494\nthemselves workers together with Him. These are the men that are needed in\nthe ministry and in the school work. Let those who have shown themselves\nto be men move out, and do what they can in the Master\u2019s service. Let them\nstep into the ranks of workers, and by patient, continuous effort prove their\nworth. It is in the water, not on the land, that we learn to swim. Let them\n\ufb01ll with \ufb01delity the place to which they are called, that they may become\nquali\ufb01ed to bear still higher responsibilities. God gives all opportunity to\nperfect themselves in His service.... *****\nGod has endowed some of His servants with special talents, and no one\nis called upon to disparage their excellence. But let none use their talents to\nexalt self. Let them not regard themselves as favored above their fellow-men,\nnor exalt themselves above other sincere, earnest workers. The Lord looks\nupon the heart. He who is most devoted to God\u2019s service is most highly\nesteemed by the heavenly universe.\nHeaven is watching to see how those occupying positions of in\ufb02uence\nful\ufb01l their stewardship. The demands upon them as stewards are measured\nby the extent of their in\ufb02uence. In their treatment of their fellow-men,\nthey should be as fathers,\u2014just, tender, true. They should be Christlike\nin character, uniting with their brethren in the closest bonds of unity and\nfellowship.\u2014 \u201cTestimonies for the Church,\u201d V ol. VII, pages 277-282.\n495\n\u201cConsider One Another\u201d\nYou will often meet with souls that are under the stress of temptation. You\nknow not how severely Satan may be wrestling with them. Beware lest you\ndiscourage such souls, and thus give the tempter an advantage.\nWhenever you see or hear something that needs to be corrected, seek\nthe Lord for wisdom and grace, that in trying to be faithful you may not\nbe severe. It is always humiliating to have one\u2019s errors pointed out. Do not\nmake the experience more bitter by needless censure. Unkind criticism brings\ndiscouragement, making life sunless and unhappy.\nMy brethren, prevail by love rather than by severity. When one at fault\nbecomes conscious of his error, be careful not to destroy his self-respect. Do\nnot seek to bruise and wound, but rather to bind up and heal. *****\nNo human being possesses sensibilities so acute or a nature so re\ufb01ned as\ndoes our Saviour. And what patience He manifests toward us! Year after\nyear He bears with our weakness and ignorance, with our ingratitude and\nwaywardness. Notwithstanding all our wanderings, and hardness of heart,\nour neglect of His holy words, His hand is stretched out still. And He bids us,\n\u201cLove one another as I have loved you.\u201d [John 13:34.]\nBrethren, regard yourselves as missionaries, not among heathen, but\namong your fellow-workers. It requires a vast amount of time and labor to\nconvince\n496\none soul in regard to the special truths for this time. And when souls are\nturned from sin to righteousness, there is joy in the presence of the angels.\nThink you that the ministering spirits who watch over these souls are pleased\nto see how indifferently they are treated by many who claim to be Christians?\nMan\u2019s preferences rule. Partiality is manifested. One is favored, while\nanother is treated harshly.\nThe angels look with awe and amazement upon the mission of Christ to\nthe world. They marvel at the love that moved Him to give Himself a sacri\ufb01ce\nfor the sins of men. But how lightly human beings regard the purchase of His\nblood! *****\nWe need not begin bytrying to love one another. The love of Christ in the\nheart is what is needed. When self is submerged in Christ, true love springs\nforth spontaneously.\nIn patient forbearance we shall conquer. It is patience in service that\nbrings rest to the soul. It is through humble, diligent, faithful toilers that\nthe welfare of Israel is promoted. A word of love and encouragement will\ndo more to subdue the hasty temper and wilful disposition than all the\nfault\ufb01nding and censure that you can heap upon the erring one.\nThe Master\u2019s message must be declared in the Master\u2019s spirit. Our only\nsafety is in keeping our thoughts and impulses under the control of the great\nTeacher. Angels of God will give to every true worker a rich experience in\ndoing this. The grace of humility will mould our words into expressions of\nChristlike tenderness.\u2014 \u201cTestimonies for the Church,\u201d V ol. VII, pages 265,\n266.\n497\nChurch Discipline\nIn dealing with erring church-members, God\u2019s people are carefully to\nfollow the instruction given by the Saviour in the eighteenth chapter of\nMatthew. [See Matthew 18:15-18.]\nHuman beings are Christ\u2019s property, purchased by Him at an in\ufb01nite price,\nbound to Him by the love that He and His Father have manifested for them.\nHow careful, then, we should be in our dealing with one another! Men have\nno right to surmise evil in regard to their fellow-men. Church-members\nhave no right to follow their own impulses and inclinations in dealing\nwith fellow-members who have erred. They should not even express their\nprejudices regarding the erring; for thus they place in other minds the\nleaven of evil. Reports unfavorable to a brother or sister in the church are\ncommunicated from one to another of the church-members. Mistakes are\nmade and injustice is done because of an unwillingness on the part of some\none to follow the directions given by the Lord Jesus.\n\u201cIf thy brother shall trespass against thee,\u201d Christ declared, \u201cgo and tell\nhim his fault between thee and him alone.\u201d Do not tell others of the wrong.\nOne person is told, then another, and still another; and continually the report\ngrows, and the evil increases, till the whole church is made to suffer. Settle\nthe matter \u201cbetween thee and him alone.\u201d This is God\u2019s plan.\n\u201cGo not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end\nthereof, when thy neighbor hath\n498\nput thee to shame. Debate thy cause with thy neighbor himself; and discover\nnot a secret to another.\u201d [Proverbs 25:8, 9.] Do not suffer sin upon your\nbrother; but do not expose him, and thus increase the dif\ufb01culty, making the\nreproof seem like a revenge. Correct him in the way outlined in the word of\nGod.\nDo not suffer resentment to ripen into malice. Do not allow the wound to\nfester and break out in poisoned words, which taint the minds of those who\nhear. Do not allow bitter thoughts to continue to \ufb01ll your mind and his. Go to\nyour brother, and in humility and sincerity talk with him about the matter.\nWhatever the character of the offense, this does not change the plan that\nGod has made for the settlement of misunderstandings and personal injuries.\nSpeaking alone and in the spirit of Christ to the one who is in fault, will often\nremove the dif\ufb01culty. Go to the erring one, with a heart \ufb01lled with Christ\u2019s\nlove and sympathy, and seek to adjust the matter. Reason with him calmly\nand quietly. Let no angry words escape your lips. Speak in a way that will\nappeal to his better judgment. Remember the words, \u201cHe which converteth\nthe sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall\nhide a multitude of sins.\u201d [James 5:20.]\nTake to your brother the remedy that will cure the disease of disaffection.\nDo your part to help him. For the sake of the peace and unity of the church,\nfeel it a privilege as well as a duty to do this. If he will hear you, you have\ngained him as a friend.\nAll heaven is interested in the interview between the one who has been\ninjured and the one who is in\n499\nerror. As the erring one accepts the reproof offered in the love of Christ, and\nacknowledges his wrong, asking forgiveness from God and from his brother,\nthe sunshine of heaven \ufb01lls his heart. The controversy is ended; friendship\nand con\ufb01dence are restored. The oil of love removes the soreness caused by\nthe wrong; the Spirit of God binds heart to heart; and there is music in heaven\nover the union brought about.\nAs those thus united in Christian fellowship offer prayer to God, and\npledge themselves to deal justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God,\ngreat blessing comes to them. If they have wronged others, they continue the\nwork of repentance, confession, and restitution, fully set to do good to one\nanother. This is the ful\ufb01lling of the law of Christ.\n\u201cBut if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in\nthe mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.\u201d Take\nwith you those who are spiritually minded, and talk with the one in error in\nregard to the wrong. He may yield to the united appeals of his brethren. As\nhe sees their agreement in the matter, his mind may be enlightened.\n\u201cAnd if he shall neglect to hear them,\u201d what then shall be done? Shall\na few persons in a board meeting take upon themselves the responsibility of\ndisfellowshiping the erring one? \u201cIf he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto\nthe church.\u201d Let the church take action in regard to its members.\n\u201cBut if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as a heathen\nman and a publican.\u201d If he will not heed the voice of the church, if he refuses\nall the efforts made to reclaim him, upon the church rests\n500\nthe responsibility of separating him from fellowship. His name should then\nbe stricken from the books.\nNo church of\ufb01cer should advise, no committee should recommend, nor\nshould any church vote, that the name of a wrong-doer shall be removed from\nthe church books, until the instruction given by Christ has been faithfully\nfollowed. When this has been done, the church has cleared herself before\nGod. The evil must then be made to appear as it is, and must be removed, that\nit may not become more and more widespread. The health and purity of the\nchurch must be preserved, that she may stand before God unsullied, clad in\nthe robes of Christ\u2019s righteousness.\nIf the erring one repents and submits to Christ\u2019s discipline, he is to be\ngiven another trial. And even if he does not repent, even if he stands outside\nthe church, God\u2019s servants still have a work to do for him. They are to seek\nearnestly to win him to repentance. And however aggravated may have been\nhis offense, if he yields to the striving of the Holy Spirit, and by confessing\nand forsaking his sin gives evidence of repentance, he is to be forgiven and\nwelcomed to the fold again. His brethren are to encourage him in the right\nway, treating him as they would wish to be treated were they in his place,\nconsidering themselves, lest they also be tempted.\n\u201cVerily I say unto you,\u201d Christ continued, \u201cWhatsoever ye shall bind on\nearth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall\nbe loosed in heaven.\u201d\nThis statement holds its force in all ages. On the church has been\nconferred the power to act in Christ\u2019s stead. It is God\u2019s instrumentality for\nthe preservation\n501\nof order and discipline among His people. To it the Lord has delegated\nthe power to settle all questions respecting its prosperity, purity, and order.\nUpon it rests the responsibility of excluding from its fellowship those who\nare unworthy, who by their unchristlike conduct would bring dishonor on the\ntruth. Whatever the church does that is in accordance with the directions\ngiven in God\u2019s word, will be rati\ufb01ed in heaven. *****\nRemission of Sins\n\u201cWhosesoever sins ye remit,\u201d said Christ, \u201cthey are remitted; ...and\nwhosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.\u201d [John 20:23.] Christ here\ngives no liberty for any man to pass judgment upon others. In the sermon on\nthe mount He forbade this. It is the prerogative of God. But on the church in\nits organized capacity He places a responsibility for the individual members.\nToward those who fall into sin, the church has a duty, to warn, to instruct,\nand if possible to restore. \u201cReprove, rebuke, exhort,\u201d the Lord says, \u201cwith all\nlong-suffering and doctrine.\u201d [2 Timothy 4:2.]\nDeal faithfully with wrong-doing. Warn every soul that is in danger.\nLeave none to deceive themselves. Call sin by its right name. Declare what\nGod has said in regard to lying, Sabbath-breaking, stealing, idolatry, and\nevery other evil. \u201cThey which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of\nGod.\u201d [Galatians 5:21.] If they persist in sin, the judgment you have declared\nfrom God\u2019s word is pronounced upon them in heaven. In choosing to sin,\nthey disown Christ; the church\n502\nmust show that she does not sanction their deeds, or she herself dishonors her\nLord. She must say about sin what God says about it. She must deal with\nit as God directs, and her action is rati\ufb01ed in heaven. He who despises the\nauthority of the church, despises the authority of Christ Himself.\nBut there is a brighter side to the picture. \u201cWhosesoever sins ye remit,\nthey are remitted.\u201d Let this thought be kept uppermost. In labor for the erring,\nlet every eye be directed to Christ. Let the shepherds have a tender care for\nthe \ufb02ock of the Lord\u2019s pasture. Let them speak to the erring of the forgiving\nmercy of the Saviour. Let them encourage the sinner to repent, and believe\nin Him who can pardon. Let them declare, on the authority of God\u2019s word,\n\u201cIf we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to\ncleanse us from all unrighteousness.\u201d [1 John 1:9.] All who repent have the\nassurance, \u201cHe will have compassion upon us; He will subdue our iniquities;\nand Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.\u201d [Micah 7:19.]\nLet the repentance of the sinner be accepted by the church with grateful\nhearts. Let the repenting one be led out from the darkness of unbelief into\nthe light of faith and righteousness. Let his trembling hand be placed in the\nloving hand of Jesus. Such a remission is rati\ufb01ed in heaven.\u2014 The Desire of\nAges, 805, 806.\n503\n504\nSection XII. Closing Words\nPower for Service\nWhat the church needs in these days of peril is an army of workers\nwho, like Paul, have educated themselves for usefulness, who have a deep\nexperience in the things of God, and who are \ufb01lled with earnestness and zeal.\nSancti\ufb01ed, self-sacri\ufb01cing men are needed,\u2014men who will not shun trial and\nresponsibility; men who are brave and true; men in whose hearts Christ is\nformed \u201cthe hope of glory,\u201d and who, with lips touched with holy \ufb01re, will\n\u201cpreach the word.\u201d For want of such workers the cause of God languishes,\nand fatal errors, like a deadly poison, taint the morals and blight the hopes of\na large part of the human race.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 507. *****\nThose who are men in the sight of God, and who are thus recorded in the\nbooks of heaven, are those who, like Daniel, cultivate every faculty in such a\nway as best represents the kingdom of God to a world lying in wickedness.\nProgress in knowledge is essential; for when employed in the cause of God,\nknowledge is a power for good. The world needs men of thought, men of\nprinciple, men who are constantly growing in understanding and discernment.\nThe press is in need of men to use it to the best advantage, that the truth\n505\nmay be given wings to speed it to every nation, and tongue, and people. *****\n\u201cGo out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in,\u201d\nChrist bids us, \u201cthat My house may be \ufb01lled.\u201d [Luke 14:23.] In obedience to\nthis word we must go to the heathen who are near us, and to those who are\nafar off. The \u201cpublicans and the harlots\u201d must hear the Saviour\u2019s invitation.\nThrough the kindness and long-suffering of His messengers, the invitation\nbecomes a compelling power to uplift those who are sunken in the lowest\ndepths of sin.\nChristian motives demand that we work with a steady purpose, an undying\ninterest, an ever-increasing importunity, for the souls whom Satan is seeking\nto destroy. Nothing is to chill the earnest, yearning energy for the salvation\nof the lost.\nMark how all through the word of God there is manifest the spirit of\nurgency, of imploring men and women to come to Christ. We must seize\nupon every opportunity, in private and in public, presenting every argument,\nurging every motive of in\ufb01nite weight, to draw men to the Saviour. With\nall our power we must urge them to look unto Jesus, and to accept His life of\nself-denial and sacri\ufb01ce. We must show that we expect them to give joy to the\nheart of Christ by using every one of His gifts in honoring His name.\u2014 The\nMinistry of Healing, 164-165. *****\nIt is not the length of time we labor, but our willingness and \ufb01delity in the\nwork, that makes it acceptable to God. In all our service a full surrender of\nself\n506\nis demanded. The smallest duty done in sincerity and self-forgetfulness, is\nmore pleasing to God than the greatest work when marred with self-seeking.\nHe looks to see how much of the spirit of Christ we cherish, and how much\nof the likeness of Christ our work reveals. He regards more the love and\nfaithfulness with which we work than the amount we do.\nOnly when sel\ufb01shness is dead, when strife for the supremacy is banished,\nwhen gratitude \ufb01lls the heart, and love makes fragrant the life,\u2014it is only then\nthat Christ is abiding in the soul, and we are recognized as laborers together\nwith God.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 402. *****\nOf all people in the world, reformers should be the most unsel\ufb01sh, the\nmost kind, the most courteous. In their lives should be seen the true goodness\nof unsel\ufb01sh deeds. The worker who manifests a lack of courtesy, who shows\nimpatience at the ignorance or waywardness of others, who speaks hastily or\nacts thoughtlessly, may close the door to hearts so that he can never reach\nthem.\nAs the dew and the still showers fall upon the withering plants, so let\nwords fall gently when seeking to win men from error. God\u2019s plan is \ufb01rst to\nreach the heart. We are to speak the truth in love, trusting in Him to give it\npower for the reforming of the life. The Holy Spirit will apply to the soul the\nword that is spoken in love.\nNaturally we are self-centered and opinionated. But when we learn the\nlessons that Christ desires to teach us, we become partakers of His nature;\nhenceforth we live His life. The wonderful example of\n507\nChrist, the matchless tenderness with which He entered into the feelings of\nothers, weeping with those who wept, rejoicing with those who rejoiced, must\nhave a deep in\ufb02uence upon the character of all who follow Him in sincerity.\nBy kindly words and acts they will try to make the path easy for weary\nfeet.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 157, 158. *****\nIt is not the highest work of education to communicate knowledge merely,\nbut to impart that vitalizing energy which is received through the contact\nof mind with mind and soul with soul. It is only life that can beget life.\nWhat privilege, then, was theirs who for three years were in daily contact\nwith that divine life from which has \ufb02owed every life-giving impulse that\nhas blessed the world! Above all His companions, John the beloved disciple\nyielded himself to the power of that wondrous life. He says, \u201cThe life was\nmanifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that\neternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.\u201d \u201cOf His\nfulness have all we received, and grace for grace.\u201d [1 John 1:2; John 1:16.]\nIn the apostles of our Lord there was nothing to bring glory to themselves.\nIt was evident that the success of their labors was due only to God. The lives\nof these men, the characters they developed, and the mighty work that God\nwrought through them, are a testimony to what He will do for all who are\nteachable and obedient.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 250. *****\nBefore honor is humility. To \ufb01ll a high place before men, Heaven chooses\nthe worker who, like John\n508\nthe Baptist, takes a lowly place before God. The most childlike disciple is\nthe most ef\ufb01cient in labor for God. The heavenly intelligences can co-operate\nwith him who is seeking, not to exalt self, but to save souls. He who feels\nmost deeply his need of divine aid will plead for it, and the Holy Spirit will\ngive unto him glimpses of Jesus that will strengthen and uplift the soul. From\ncommunion with Christ he will go forth to work for those who are perishing\nin their sins. He is anointed for his mission; and he succeeds where many\nof the learned and intellectually wise would fail.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 436.\n*****\nHe who calls men to repentance must commune with God in prayer. He\nmust cling to the Mighty One, saying, \u201cI will not let Thee go, except Thou\nbless me. Give me power to win souls to Christ.\u201d *****\nPaul says, \u201cWhen I am weak, then am I strong.\u201d [2 Corinthians 12:10.]\nWhen we have a realization of our weakness, we learn to depend on a power\nnot inherent. Nothing can take so strong a hold on the heart as the abiding\nsense of our responsibility to God. Nothing reaches so fully down to the\ndeepest motives of conduct as a sense of the pardoning love of Christ. We\nare to come in touch with God, then we shall be imbued with His Holy Spirit,\nthat enables us to come in touch with our fellow-men.\nThen rejoice that through Christ you have become connected with God,\nmembers of the heavenly family. While you look higher than yourself, you\nwill have a\n509\ncontinual sense of the weakness of humanity. The less you cherish self, the\nmore distinct and full will be your comprehension of the excellence of your\nSaviour. The more closely you connect yourself with the Source of light and\npower, the greater light will be shed upon you, and the greater power will be\nyours to work for God.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 493. *****\nNothing is more needed in our work than the practical results of\ncommunion with God. We should show by our daily lives that we have\npeace and rest in the Saviour. His peace in the heart will shine forth in the\ncountenance. It will give to the voice a persuasive power. Communion with\nGod will ennoble the character and the life. Men will take knowledge of us,\nas of the \ufb01rst disciples, that we have been with Jesus. This will impart to the\nworker a power that nothing else can give. Of this power he must not allow\nhimself to be deprived.\nWe must live a twofold life,\u2014a life of thought and action, of silent\nprayer and earnest work. The strength received through communion with\nGod, united with earnest effort in training the mind to thoughtfulness and\ncare-taking, prepares one for daily duties, and keeps the spirit in peace under\nall circumstances, however trying.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 512. *****\nTo the consecrated worker there is wonderful consolation in the\nknowledge that even Christ during His life on earth sought His Father daily\nfor fresh supplies of needed grace; and from this communion with God He\nwent forth to strengthen and bless others.\n510\nBehold the Son of God bowed in prayer to His Father! Though He is\nthe Son of God, He strengthens His faith by prayer, and by communion with\nHeaven gathers to Himself power to resist evil and to minister to the needs\nof men. As the Elder Brother of our race, He knows the necessities of those\nwho, compassed with in\ufb01rmity and living in a world of sin and temptation,\nstill desire to serve Him. He knows that the messengers whom He sees \ufb01t\nto send are weak, erring men; but to all who give themselves wholly to His\nservice He promises divine aid. His own example is an assurance that earnest,\npersevering supplication to God in faith\u2014faith that leads to entire dependence\nupon God, and unreserved consecration to His work\u2014will avail to bring to\nmen the Holy Spirit\u2019s aid in the battle against sin.\nEvery worker who follows the example of Christ will be prepared to\nreceive and use the power that God has promised to His church for the\nripening of earth\u2019s harvest. Morning by morning, as the heralds of the gospel\nkneel before the Lord and renew their vows of consecration to Him, He will\ngrant them the presence of His Spirit, with its reviving, sanctifying power.\nAs they go forth to the day\u2019s duties, they have the assurance that the unseen\nagency of the Holy Spirit enables them to be \u201claborers together with God.\u201d [1\nCorinthians 3:9.]\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 56.\n511\nThe Reward of Service\n\u201cWhen thou makest a dinner or a supper,\u201d said Christ, \u201ccall not thy friends,\nnor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors; lest they also\nbid thee again, and a recompense be made thee. But when thou makest\na feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: and thou shalt be\nblessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at\nthe resurrection of the just.\u201d [Luke 14:12-14.]\nIn these words Christ draws a contrast between the self-seeking practices\nof the world, and the unsel\ufb01sh ministry of which He has given an example\nin His own life. For such ministry He offers no reward of worldly gain or\nrecognition. \u201cThou shalt be recompensed,\u201d He says, \u201cat the resurrection of\nthe just.\u201d Then the results of every life will be made manifest, and every one\nwill reap that which he has sown.\nTo every worker for God this thought should be a stimulus and an\nencouragement. In this life our work for God often seems to be almost\nfruitless. Our efforts to do good may be earnest and persevering, yet we\nmay not be permitted to witness their results. To us the effort may seem to be\nlost. But the Saviour assures us that our work is noted in heaven, and that the\nrecompense cannot fail. The apostle Paul, writing by the Holy Spirit, says,\n\u201cLet us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we\nfaint not.\u201d [Galatians 6:9.] And in the words of the psalmist we read, \u201cHe\nthat goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious\n512\nseed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with\nhim.\u201d [Psalm 126:6.]\nWhile the great \ufb01nal reward is given at Christ\u2019s coming, true-hearted\nservice for God brings a reward, even in this life. Obstacles, opposition,\nand bitter, heart-breaking discouragements, the worker will have to meet. He\nmay not see the fruit of his toil. But in face of all this he \ufb01nds in his labor\na blessed recompense. All who surrender themselves to God in unsel\ufb01sh\nservice for humanity are in co-operation with the Lord of glory. This thought\nsweetens all toil, it braces the will, it nerves the spirit for whatever may\nbefall. Working with unsel\ufb01sh heart, ennobled by being partakers of Christ\u2019s\nsufferings, sharing His sympathies, they help to swell the tide of His joy,\nand bring honor and praise to His exalted name. In fellowship with God, with\nChrist, and with holy angels, they are surrounded with a heavenly atmosphere,\nan atmosphere that brings health to the body, vigor to the intellect, and joy to\nthe soul.\nAll who consecrate body, soul, and spirit to God\u2019s service will be\nconstantly receiving a new endowment of physical, mental, and spiritual\npower. The inexhaustible supplies of heaven are at their command. Christ\ngives them the breath of His own spirit, the life of His own life. The Holy\nSpirit puts forth His highest energies to work in heart and mind.\n\u201cThen shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall\nspring forth speedily.\u201d Thou shalt \u201ccall, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt\ncry, and He shall say, Here I am.\u201d \u201cThy light\u201d shall \u201crise in obscurity, and thy\ndarkness be as the noonday: and the Lord shall guide thee continually, and\n513\nsatisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a\nwatered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.\u201d [Isaiah\n58:8-11.]\nMany are God\u2019s promises to those who minister to His af\ufb02icted ones. He\nsays: \u201cBlessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him in\ntime of trouble. The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall\nbe blessed upon the earth: and Thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his\nenemies. The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: Thou\nwilt make all his bed in his sickness.\u201d \u201cTrust in the Lord, and do good; so\nshalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.\u201d [Psalm 41:1-3;\n37:3.] \u201cHonor the Lord with thy substance, and with the \ufb01rst-fruits of all\nthine increase: so shall thy barns be \ufb01lled with plenty, and thy presses shall\nburst out with new wine.\u201d \u201cThere is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and\nthere is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.\u201d \u201cHe\nthat hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath\ngiven will He pay him again.\u201d \u201cThe liberal soul shall be made fat: and he\nthat watereth shall be watered also himself.\u201d [Proverbs 3:9, 10; 11:24; 19:17;\n11:25.]\nWhile much of the fruit of their labor is not apparent in this life, God\u2019s\nworkers have His sure promise of ultimate success. As the world\u2019s Redeemer,\nChrist was constantly confronted with apparent failure. He seemed to do\nlittle of the work which He longed to do in uplifting and saving. Satanic\nagencies were constantly working to obstruct His way. But He would not be\ndiscouraged. Ever before Him\n514\nHe saw the result of His mission. He knew that truth would \ufb01nally triumph\nin the contest with evil, and to His disciples He said: \u201cThese things I have\nspoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall\nhave tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d [John\n16:33.] The life of Christ\u2019s disciples is to be like His, a series of uninterrupted\nvictories\u2014not seen to be such here, but recognized as such in the great\nhereafter.\nThose who labor for the good of others are working in union with the\nheavenly angels. They have their constant companionship, their unceasing\nministry. Angels of light and power are ever near to protect, to comfort, to\nheal, to instruct, to inspire. The highest education, the truest culture, the most\nexalted service possible to human beings in this world, are theirs.\nOften our merciful Father encourages His children and strengthens their\nfaith by permitting them here to see evidence of the power of His grace upon\nthe hearts and lives of those for whom they labor. \u201cMy thoughts are not your\nthoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens\nare higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My\nthoughts than your thoughts. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from\nheaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring\nforth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: so\nshall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth: it shall not return unto\nMe void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in\nthe thing whereto I sent it. For ye shall go out with\n515\njoy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break\nforth before you into singing, and all the trees of the \ufb01eld shall clap their\nhands. Instead of the thorn shall come up the \ufb01r-tree, and instead of the brier\nshall come up the myrtle-tree: and it shall be to the Lord for a name, for an\neverlasting sign that shall not be cut off.\u201d [Isaiah 55:8-13.]\nIn the transformation of character, the casting out of evil passions, the\ndevelopment of the sweet graces of God\u2019s Holy Spirit, we see the ful\ufb01lment\nof the promise, \u201cInstead of the thorn shall come up the \ufb01r-tree, and instead of\nthe brier shall come up the myrtle-tree.\u201d We behold life\u2019s desert \u201crejoice, and\nblossom as the rose.\u201d [Isaiah 35:1.]\nChrist delights to take apparently hopeless material, those whom Satan\nhas debased and through whom he has worked, and make them the subjects\nof His grace. He rejoices to deliver them from suffering, and from the wrath\nthat is to fall upon the disobedient. He makes His children His agents in the\naccomplishment of this work, and in its success, even in this life, they \ufb01nd a\nprecious reward.\nBut what is this compared with the joy that will be theirs in the great\nday of \ufb01nal revealing? \u201cNow we see through a glass, darkly; but then face\nto face;\u201d now we know in part, but then we shall know even as also we are\nknown. [See 1 Corinthians 13:12.]\nIt is the reward of Christ\u2019s workers to enter into His joy. That joy, to which\nChrist Himself looks forward with eager desire, is presented in His request to\nHis Father, \u201cI will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me\nwhere I am.\u201d [John 17:24.]\n516\nThe angels were waiting to welcome Jesus, as He ascended after His\nresurrection. The heavenly host longed to greet again their loved Commander,\nreturned to them from the prison-house of death. Eagerly they pressed about\nHim as He entered the gates of heaven. But He waved them back. His heart\nwas with the lonely, sorrowing band of disciples whom He had left upon\nOlivet. It is still with His struggling children on earth, who have the battle\nwith the destroyer yet to wage. \u201cFather,\u201d He says, \u201cI will that they also,\nwhom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am.\u201d\nChrist\u2019s redeemed ones are His jewels, His precious and peculiar treasure.\n\u201cThey shall be as the stones of a crown,\u201d\u2014\u201cthe riches of the glory of His\ninheritance in the saints.\u201d [Zechariah 9:16; Ephesians 1:18.] In them \u201cHe\nshall see of the travail of His soul, and shall be satis\ufb01ed. [Isaiah 53:11.]\nAnd will not His workers rejoice when they, too, behold the fruit of\ntheir labors? The apostle Paul, writing to the Thessalonian converts, says:\n\u201cWhat is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the\npresence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming? for ye are our glory and\njoy.\u201d [1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20.] And he exhorts the Philippian brethren to\nbe \u201cblameless and harmless,\u201d to \u201cshine as lights in the world; holding forth\nthe word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in\nvain, neither labored in vain.\u201d [Philippians 2:15, 16.]\nEvery impulse of the Holy Spirit leading men to goodness and to God, is\nnoted in the books of heaven, and in the day of God every one who has given\nhimself\n517\nas an instrument for the Holy Spirit\u2019s working, will be permitted to behold\nwhat his life has wrought....\nWonderful will be the revealing as the lines of holy in\ufb02uence, with their\nprecious results, are brought to view. What will be the gratitude of souls\nthat will meet us in the heavenly courts, as they understand the sympathetic,\nloving interest which has been taken in their salvation! All praise, honor, and\nglory will be given to God and to the Lamb for our redemption; but it will not\ndetract from the glory of God to express gratitude to the instrumentality He\nhas employed in the salvation of souls ready to perish.\nThe redeemed will meet and recognize those whose attention they have\ndirected to the uplifted Saviour. What blessed converse they will have with\nthese souls! \u201cI was a sinner,\u201d it will be said, \u201cwithout God and without hope\nin the world; and you came to me, and drew my attention to the precious\nSaviour as my only hope. And I believed in Him. I repented of my sins, and\nwas made to sit together with His saints in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\u201d\nOthers will say: \u201cI was a heathen in heathen lands. You left your friends and\ncomfortable home, and came to teach me how to \ufb01nd Jesus, and believe in\nHim as the only true God. I demolished my idols, and worshiped God, and\nnow I see Him face to face. I am saved, eternally saved, ever to behold Him\nwhom I love. I then saw Him only with the eye of faith, but now I see Him as\nHe is. I can now express my gratitude for His redeeming mercy to Him who\nloved me, and washed me from my sins in His own blood.\u201d\nOthers will express their gratitude to those who fed the hungry and clothed\nthe naked. \u201cWhen despair\n518\nbound my soul in unbelief, the Lord sent you to me,\u201d they say, \u201cto speak words\nof hope and comfort. You brought me food for my physical necessities, and\nyou opened to me the word of God, awakening me to my spiritual needs. You\ntreated me as a brother. You sympathized with me in my sorrows, and restored\nmy bruised and wounded soul, so that I could grasp the hand of Christ that was\nreached out to save me. In my ignorance you taught me patiently that I had\na Father in heaven who cared for me. You read to me the precious promises\nof God\u2019s word. You inspired in me faith that He would save me. My heart\nwas softened, subdued, broken, as I contemplated the sacri\ufb01ce which Christ\nhad made for me. I became hungry for the bread of life, and the truth was\nprecious to my soul. I am here, saved, eternally saved, ever to live in His\npresence, and to praise Him who gave His life for me.\u201d\nWhat rejoicing there will be as these redeemed ones meet and greet those\nwho have had a burden in their behalf! And those who have lived, not to\nplease themselves, but to be a blessing to the unfortunate who have so few\nblessings,\u2014how their hearts will thrill with satisfaction! They will realize\nthe promise, \u201cThou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for\nthou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.\u201d [Luke 14:14.]\n\u201cThou shalt delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon\nthe high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father:\nfor the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\u201d [Isaiah 58:14.]\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church6:305-312.\n519",
