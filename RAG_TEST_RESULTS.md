## Test Questions & Results

### 1. "Who was Ellen G. White?"
- **Best Model**: mistral:latest (2.8s)
- **Retrieval**: Found relevant context from "The Great Controversy"
- **Answer Quality**: All models correctly identified her as SDA founder and author

### 2. "What does the Bible say about the Sabbath?"
- **Best Model**: qwen2.5-coder:3b (5.0s)
- **Retrieval**: Found biblical passages about Sabbath observance
- **Answer Quality**: Accurate theological responses about seventh-day worship

### 3. "What is the Great Controversy about?"
- **Best Model**: qwen2.5-coder:3b (4.8s)

- **Answer Quality**: Correctly explained the cosmic conflict theme

### 4. "What does the Bible teach about health?"
- **Best Model**: qwen2.5-coder:3b (4.9s)
- **Retrieval**: Found health-related biblical passages
- **Answer Quality**: Provided biblical perspective on health and divine providence

## Retrieval Quality Analysis

### Strong Performance Areas
- **Author identification**: Excellent retrieval for "Who was Ellen G. White?"
- **Doctrinal topics**: Good context for Great Controversy and Sabbath questions
- **Cross-source retrieval**: Successfully pulls from both Bible and Ellen G. White writings

### Areas for Potential Improvement
- **Specific biblical events**: Questions like "seventh day of creation" had lower similarity scores
- **Complex theological concepts**: Some specialized doctrines could benefit from better chunking
- **Health topics**: Mixed retrieval quality for health-related queries

## Technical Details

### Retrieval Settings Used
- **Results per query**: 2-3 chunks
- **Embedding model**: sentence-transformers (default from config)
- **Database**: ChromaDB persistent storage
- **Similarity metric**: Cosine distance (converted to similarity scores)

### Model Configuration
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (for consistent responses)
- **Max tokens**: 100-150 (to keep responses concise)
- **Timeout**: 45 seconds per query
- **Context length**: ~400 characters per source (to fit model limits)

## Recommendations

### Model Selection
1. **For speed**: Use `qwen2.5-coder:3b` - consistently fastest
2. **For quality**: Use `mistral:latest` - slightly better theological understanding
3. **For balance**: Use `phi3:mini` - good compromise of speed and quality

### System Optimization
1. **Chunking**: Consider smaller, more focused chunks for better retrieval precision
2. **Metadata**: Enhance with chapter/verse references for biblical content  
3. **Filtering**: Add source-type filtering (Bible vs. Ellen G. White) for specific queries
4. **Context**: Experiment with 3-5 context chunks for complex theological questions
