# TinyOwl Model Investigation Report
## Small Reasoning Models for Theological RAG Applications (October 2025)

---

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Current model (Mistral:latest) doesn't respect RAG context boundaries, pulling answers from general training data (Britannica, Wikipedia) instead of TinyOwl's 385K theological chunks.

**Root Cause**: Instruction-following weakness, not RAG infrastructure failure.

**Solution**: Switch to models specifically designed for strong instruction-following and context adherence.

---

## What "Reasoning" Actually Means

### In Traditional AI Terms:
- **Logical chain-of-thought**: Step-by-step problem solving
- **Mathematical capability**: GSM8K, MATH benchmarks
- **Code generation**: HumanEval, MBPP benchmarks
- **Multi-hop inference**: Connecting multiple pieces of information

### In RAG Applications (What You Need):
- **Context adherence**: Staying within provided chunks
- **Instruction following**: Obeying "ONLY use context" constraints
- **Source citation**: Correctly citing [1], [2], [3] references
- **Refusal capability**: Saying "not in context" when appropriate
- **Structured output**: Generating properly formatted responses

**KEY INSIGHT**: For RAG, "instruction-following" matters MORE than raw reasoning scores!

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Test (Do This Now)

```bash
# Install Qwen2.5-3B
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b-instruct

# Test immediately with improved prompt
TINYOWL_OLLAMA_MODEL="qwen2.5:3b-instruct" python chat_app/main.py
```

**Test Query**: "What does the Spirit of Prophecy say about Sabbath observance?"

**Expected Behavior**:
- ‚úÖ Should cite retrieved SOP chunks by number [1], [2], [3]
- ‚úÖ Should NOT mention Britannica or general knowledge
- ‚úÖ Should say "not found in context" if retrieval fails
- ‚úÖ Should provide structured, cited response

### Phase 2: Prompt Engineering (Next 30 minutes)

Current prompt (main.py:704-706, 819-821):
```python
prompt = (
    "You are a theological research assistant. Using ONLY the context provided, answer the query and cite sources by [index].\n\n"
    f"Context:\n{ctx}\n\nQuery: {q}\nAnswer:"
)
```

**Improved prompt for Qwen2.5-3B:**
```python
prompt = (
    "You are a biblical research assistant for TinyOwl theological database.\n"
    "Answer STRICTLY from the provided context. DO NOT use general knowledge.\n"
    "DO NOT cite Britannica, Wikipedia, or training data.\n\n"
    "RULES:\n"
    "1. ONLY use information from numbered sources below\n"
    "2. Cite sources as [1], [2], [3]\n"
    "3. If answer not in context, respond: 'Not found in retrieved sources.'\n"
    "4. Combine multiple sources when relevant\n"
    "5. Maintain theological accuracy - this is Scripture and Spirit of Prophecy\n\n"
    f"SOURCES:\n{ctx}\n\n"
    f"QUERY: {q}\n\n"
    "ANSWER (using ONLY sources above):"
)
```

### Phase 3: Fine-Tuning (Optional, Advanced)

**If you want to go deeper** (not required for RAG to work):

1. **LoRA Fine-Tuning on Qwen2.5-3B**:
   - Train on your 385K theological chunks
   - Embed SDA theological reasoning directly
   - Reduce reliance on RAG retrieval depth

2. **Requirements**:
   - 16GB+ VRAM (or multi-GPU)
   - QLoRA (4-bit quantized training)
   - ~20-50 hours training time
   - PyTorch + Transformers library

3. **Benefits**:
   - Model "knows" SDA theology internally
   - Even better context adherence
   - Potential for theological consistency checks

4. **Trade-offs**:
   - Complexity increases 10x
   - Loses some general knowledge
   - Harder to update (need to retrain for new content)

**Verdict**: Start with RAG + Qwen2.5-3B. Only fine-tune if RAG isn't sufficient after thorough testing.

## Why RAG Still Matters (Even with Long Context Models)

**Research Finding**: "Llama 4 achieved 78% accuracy with RAG, compared to 66% with long context alone."

**Key Insight**: Even 128K context models benefit from focused retrieval!

**Why?**:
1. **Attention dilution**: Longer context = weaker attention to each token
2. **Needle in haystack**: RAG pre-filters to relevant chunks
3. **Computational efficiency**: Shorter effective context = faster inference
4. **Better citations**: RAG provides pre-labeled source chunks

**For TinyOwl**: Your RAG architecture (385K chunks ‚Üí retrieval router ‚Üí top 5-10 chunks ‚Üí model) is **optimal design** regardless of model choice.

## Benchmark Summary: What Numbers Actually Mean

### GSM8K (Math Word Problems)
- **What it measures**: Multi-step reasoning, arithmetic logic
- **Theological relevance**: Complex doctrinal arguments requiring multiple logical steps
- **TinyOwl example**: "If creation week was 6 days + Sabbath, and each day is 1000 years..."

### HumanEval (Code Generation)
- **What it measures**: Structured thinking, precise logic
- **Theological relevance**: Systematic theology, structured biblical analysis
- **TinyOwl example**: Cross-referencing prophecy timelines across Daniel, Revelation

### MMLU (Multitask Language Understanding)
- **What it measures**: General knowledge, comprehension
- **Theological relevance**: Understanding historical/cultural biblical context
- **TinyOwl example**: Greco-Roman context of New Testament writings

### IFEval (Instruction Following)
- **What it measures**: Obedience to constraints, format adherence
- **Theological relevance**: **MOST IMPORTANT** - staying within retrieved context
- **TinyOwl example**: "Using ONLY Strong's concordance, define righteousness"

### ARC Challenge (Advanced Reasoning)
- **What it measures**: Complex logic, multi-hop inference
- **Theological relevance**: Connecting Old Testament types with New Testament antitypes
- **TinyOwl example**: "How does the sanctuary service prefigure Christ's ministry?"

**Bottom Line**: For RAG, prioritize IFEval > ARC > GSM8K > HumanEval > MMLU

## Testing Protocol

### Baseline Tests (Run with each model)

**Test 1: Strong's Concordance Adherence**
```
Query: @strong:175 what does Aaron represent?
Expected: ONLY Strong's H175 definition + retrieved verses
Failure: Any mention of general "Aaron history" not in chunks
```

**Test 2: Spirit of Prophecy Context Boundary**
```
Query: What does Ellen White say about the Sabbath?
Expected: ONLY citations from retrieved SOP chunks with [1], [2], [3]
Failure: Generic Sabbath info or "traditionally understood as..."
```

**Test 3: Refusal Capability**
```
Query: What does the Spirit of Prophecy say about Bitcoin?
Expected: "Not found in retrieved sources" or similar
Failure: Generating answer from general knowledge about cryptocurrency
```

**Test 4: Multi-Source Synthesis**
```
Query: Connect Exodus sanctuary service with Hebrews explanation
Expected: Cites specific verses from both books, shows connections
Failure: Generic "typology" explanation without verse citations
```

**Test 5: Hebrew/Greek Technical Terminology**
```
Query: Explain the Hebrew word for "righteousness" (◊¶◊ì◊ß)
Expected: Strong's definition + usage examples from retrieved chunks
Failure: Generic dictionary definition not tied to biblical usage
```

### Success Criteria

**Qwen2.5-3B should pass**: 4/5 tests (expected baseline)
**Phi-3.5-mini should pass**: 5/5 tests (with excellent multi-source synthesis)
**Gemma-2-2B should pass**: 3/5 tests (acceptable for simple queries)
**Mistral (current) passes**: 1-2/5 tests (your current problem)
