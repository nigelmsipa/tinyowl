Why is no one with you?\u201d 2David answered Ahimelek the priest, \u201cThe king sent me on a mission and said to me, \u2018No one is to know anything about the mission I am sending you on.\u2019 As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place. 3Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find.\u201d 4But the priest answered David, \u201cI don\u2019t have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here\u2014provided the men have kept themselves from women.\u201d 5David replied, \u201cIndeed women have been kept from us, as usual wheneverb I set out. The men\u2019s bodies are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!\u201d 6So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the LORD and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away. 7Now one of Saul\u2019s servants was there that day, detained before the LORD; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul\u2019s chief shepherd. 8David asked Ahimelek, \u201cDon\u2019t you have a spear or a sword here? I haven\u2019t brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king\u2019s mission was urgent.\u201d 9The priest replied, \u201cThe sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one.\u201d David said, \u201cThere is none like it; give it to me.\u201d David at Gath 10That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath. 11But the servants of Achish said to him, \u201cIsn\u2019t this David, the king of the land? Isn\u2019t he the one they sing about in their dances: \u201c \u2018Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands\u2019?\u201d 12David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath. 13So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard. 14Achish said to his servants, \u201cLook at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me? 15Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?\u201d",

David and his men were far back in the cave. 4The men said, \u201cThis is the day the LORD spoke of when he saidb to you, \u2018I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.\u2019 \u201d Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul\u2019s robe. 5Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe. 6He said to his men, \u201cThe LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD\u2019s anointed, or lay my hand on him; for he is the anointed of the LORD.\u201d 7With these words David sharply rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way. 8Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, \u201cMy lord the king!\u201d When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. 9He said to Saul, \u201cWhy do you listen when men say, \u2018David is bent on harming you\u2019? 10This day you have seen with your own eyes how the LORD delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, \u2018I will not lay my hand on my lord, because he is the LORD\u2019s anointed.\u2019 11See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. See that there is nothing in my hand to indicate that I am guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life. 12May the LORD judge between you and me. And may the LORD avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you. 13As the old saying goes, \u2018From evildoers come evil deeds,\u2019 so my hand will not touch you. 14\u201cAgainst whom has the king of Israel come out? Who are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea? 15May the LORD be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand.\u201d 16When David finished saying this, Saul asked, \u201cIs that your voice, David my son?\u201d And he wept aloud. 17\u201cYou are more righteous than I,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have treated me well, but I have treated you badly. 18You have just now told me about the good you did to me; the LORD delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me. 19When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the LORD reward you well for the way you treated me today. 20I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. 21Now swear to me by the LORD that you will not kill off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father\u2019s family.\u201d 22So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.",

O Absalom, my son, my son!\u201d 5Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, \u201cToday you have humiliated all your men, who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines. 6You love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that the commanders and their men mean nothing to you. I see that you would be pleased if Absalom were alive today and all of us were dead. 7Now go out and encourage your men. I swear by the LORD that if you don\u2019t go out, not a man will be left with you by nightfall. This will be worse for you than all the calamities that have come on you from your youth till now.\u201d 8So the king got up and took his seat in the gateway. When the men were told, \u201cThe king is sitting in the gateway,\u201d they all came before him. Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled to their homes. David Returns to Jerusalem 9Throughout the tribes of Israel, all the people were arguing among themselves, saying, \u201cThe king delivered us from the hand of our enemies; he is the one who rescued us from the hand of the Philistines. But now he has fled the country to escape from Absalom; 10and Absalom, whom we anointed to rule over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?\u201d 11King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: \u201cAsk the elders of Judah, \u2018Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace, since what is being said throughout Israel has reached the king at his quarters? 12You are my relatives, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to bring back the king?\u2019 13And say to Amasa, \u2018Are you not my own flesh and blood? May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you are not the commander of my army for life in place of Joab.\u2019 \u201d 14He won over the hearts of the men of Judah so that they were all of one mind. They sent word to the king, \u201cReturn, you and all your men.\u201d 15Then the king returned and went as far as the Jordan. Now the men of Judah had come to Gilgal to go out and meet the king and bring him across the Jordan. 16Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David. 17With him were a thousand Benjamites, along with Ziba, the steward of Saul\u2019s household, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed to the Jordan, where the king was. 18They crossed at the ford to take the king\u2019s household over and to do whatever he wished. When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell prostrate before the king 19and said to him, \u201cMay my lord not hold me guilty. Do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind. 20For I your servant know that I have sinned, but today I have come here as the first from the tribes of Joseph to come down and meet my lord the king.\u201d 21Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t Shimei be put to death for this? He cursed the LORD\u2019s anointed.\u201d 22David replied, \u201cWhat does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? What right do you have to interfere? Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Don\u2019t I know that today I am king over Israel?\u201d 23So the king said to Shimei, \u201cYou shall not die.\u201d And the king promised him on oath. 24Mephibosheth, Saul\u2019s grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely. 25When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go with me, Mephibosheth?\u201d 26He said, \u201cMy lord the king, since I your servant am lame, I said, \u2018I will have my donkey saddled and will ride on it, so I can go with the king.\u2019 But Ziba my servant betrayed me. 27And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like an angel of God; so do whatever you wish. 28All my grandfather\u2019s descendants deserved nothing but death from my lord the king, but you gave your servant a place among those who eat at your table. So what right do I have to make any more appeals to the king?\u201d 29The king said to him, \u201cWhy say more? I order you and Ziba to divide the land.\u201d 30Mephibosheth said to the king, \u201cLet him take everything, now that my lord the king has returned home safely.\u201d 31Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and to send him on his way from there. 32Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years of age. He had provided for the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man. 33The king said to Barzillai, \u201cCross over with me and stay with me in Jerusalem, and I will provide for you.\u201d 34But Barzillai answered the king, \u201cHow many more years will I live, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king? 35I am now eighty years old. Can I tell the difference between what is enjoyable and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear the voices of male and female singers? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? 36Your servant will cross over the Jordan with the king for a short distance, but why should the king reward me in this way? 37Let your servant return, that I may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever you wish.\u201d 38The king said, \u201cKimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever you wish. And anything you desire from me I will do for you.\u201d 39So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and bid him farewell, and Barzillai returned to his home. 40When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham crossed with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel had taken the king over. 41Soon all the men of Israel were coming to the king and saying to him, \u201cWhy did our brothers, the men of Judah, steal the king away and bring him and his household across the Jordan, together with all his men?\u201d 42All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, \u201cWe did this because the king is closely related to us. Why are you angry about it? Have we eaten any of the king\u2019s provisions? Have we taken anything for ourselves?\u201d 43Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, \u201cWe have ten shares in the king; so we have a greater claim on David than you have. Why then do you treat us with contempt? Weren\u2019t we the first to speak of bringing back our king?\u201d But the men of Judah pressed their claims even more forcefully than the men of Israel.",

My men will work with yours, and I will pay you for your men whatever wages you set. You know that we have no one so skilled in felling timber as the Sidonians.\u201d 7When Hiram heard Solomon\u2019s message, he was greatly pleased and said, \u201cPraise be to the LORD today, for he has given David a wise son to rule over this great nation.\u201d 8So Hiram sent word to Solomon: \u201cI have received the message you sent me and will do all you want in providing the cedar and juniper logs. 9My men will haul them down from Lebanon to the Mediterranean Sea, and I will float them as rafts by sea to the place you specify. There I will separate them and you can take them away. And you are to grant my wish by providing food for my royal household.\u201d 10In this way Hiram kept Solomon supplied with all the cedar and juniper logs he wanted, 11and Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand corsb of wheat as food for his household, in addition to twenty thousand bathsc,d of pressed olive oil. Solomon continued to do this for Hiram year after year. 12The LORD gave Solomon wisdom, just as he had promised him. There were peaceful relations between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty. 13King Solomon conscripted laborers from all Israel\u2014thirty thousand men. 14He sent them off to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand a month, so that they spent one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor. 15Solomon had seventy thousand carriers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hills, 16as well as thirty-three hundrede foremen who supervised the project and directed the workers. 17At the king\u2019s command they removed from the quarry large blocks of high-grade stone to provide a foundation of dressed stone for the temple. 18The craftsmen of Solomon and Hiram and workers from Byblos cut and prepared the timber and stone for the building of the temple.",

His mother\u2019s name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba. 2Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the years Jehoiada the priest instructed him. 3The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. 4Joash said to the priests, \u201cCollect all the money that is brought as sacred offerings to the temple of the LORD\u2014the money collected in the census, the money received from personal vows and the money brought voluntarily to the temple. 5Let every priest receive the money from one of the treasurers, then use it to repair whatever damage is found in the temple.\u201d 6But by the twenty-third year of King Joash the priests still had not repaired the temple. 7Therefore King Joash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and asked them, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you repairing the damage done to the temple? Take no more money from your treasurers, but hand it over for repairing the temple.\u201d 8The priests agreed that they would not collect any more money from the people and that they would not repair the temple themselves. 9Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid. He placed it beside the altar, on the right side as one enters the temple of the LORD. The priests who guarded the entrance put into the chest all the money that was brought to the temple of the LORD. 10Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the royal secretary and the high priest came, counted the money that had been brought into the temple of the LORD and put it into bags. 11When the amount had been determined, they gave the money to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple. With it they paid those who worked on the temple of the LORD\u2014the carpenters and builders, 12the masons and stonecutters. They purchased timber and blocks of dressed stone for the repair of the temple of the LORD, and met all the other expenses of restoring the temple. 13The money brought into the temple was not spent for making silver basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, trumpets or any other articles of gold or silver for the temple of the LORD; 14it was paid to the workers, who used it to repair the temple. 15They did not require an accounting from those to whom they gave the money to pay the workers, because they acted with complete honesty. 16The money from the guilt offerings and sin offeringsc was not brought into the temple of the LORD; it belonged to the priests. 17About this time Hazael king of Aram went up and attacked Gath and captured it. Then he turned to attack Jerusalem. 18But Joash king of Judah took all the sacred objects dedicated by his predecessors\u2014Jehoshaphat, Jehoram and Ahaziah, the kings of Judah\u2014and the gifts he himself had dedicated and all the gold found in the treasuries of the temple of the LORD and of the royal palace, and he sent them to Hazael king of Aram, who then withdrew from Jerusalem. 19As for the other events of the reign of Joash, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? 20His officials conspired against him and assassinated him at Beth Millo, on the road down to Silla. 21The officials who murdered him were Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer. He died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. And Amaziah his son succeeded him as king.",

This is a lasting ordinance for Israel. 5\u201cThe temple I am going to build will be great, because our God is greater than all other gods. 6But who is able to build a temple for him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain him? Who then am I to build a temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before him? 7\u201cSend me, therefore, a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, and in purple, crimson and blue yarn, and experienced in the art of engraving, to work in Judah and Jerusalem with my skilled workers, whom my father David provided. 8\u201cSend me also cedar, juniper and algumc logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants are skilled in cutting timber there. My servants will work with yours 9to provide me with plenty of lumber, because the temple I build must be large and magnificent. 10I will give your servants, the woodsmen who cut the timber, twenty thousand corsd of ground wheat, twenty thousand corse of barley, twenty thousand bathsf of wine and twenty thousand baths of olive oil.\u201d 11Hiram king of Tyre replied by letter to Solomon: \u201cBecause the LORD loves his people, he has made you their king.\u201d 12And Hiram added: \u201cPraise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth! He has given King David a wise son, endowed with intelligence and discernment, who will build a temple for the LORD and a palace for himself. 13\u201cI am sending you Huram-Abi, a man of great skill, 14whose mother was from Dan and whose father was from Tyre. He is trained to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, and with purple and blue and crimson yarn and fine linen. He is experienced in all kinds of engraving and can execute any design given to him. He will work with your skilled workers and with those of my lord, David your father. 15\u201cNow let my lord send his servants the wheat and barley and the olive oil and wine he promised, 16and we will cut all the logs from Lebanon that you need and will float them as rafts by sea down to Joppa. You can then take them up to Jerusalem.\u201d 17Solomon took a census of all the foreigners residing in Israel, after the census his father David had taken; and they were found to be 153,600. 18He assigned 70,000 of them to be carriers and 80,000 to be stonecutters in the hills, with 3,600 foremen over them to keep the people working.",

Asa King of Judah 2Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God. 3He removed the foreign altars and the high places, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles.b 4He commanded Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and to obey his laws and commands. 5He removed the high places and incense altars in every town in Judah, and the kingdom was at peace under him. 6He built up the fortified cities of Judah, since the land was at peace. No one was at war with him during those years, for the LORD gave him rest. 7\u201cLet us build up these towns,\u201d he said to Judah, \u201cand put walls around them, with towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because we have sought the LORD our God; we sought him and he has given us rest on every side.\u201d So they built and prospered. 8Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men from Judah, equipped with large shields and with spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand from Benjamin, armed with small shields and with bows. All these were brave fighting men. 9Zerah the Cushite marched out against them with an army of thousands upon thousands and three hundred chariots, and came as far as Mareshah. 10Asa went out to meet him, and they took up battle positions in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah. 11Then Asa called to the LORD his God and said, \u201cLORD, there is no one like you to help the powerless against the mighty. Help us, LORD our God, for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against this vast army. LORD, you are our God; do not let mere mortals prevail against you.\u201d 12The LORD struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah. The Cushites fled, 13and Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar. Such a great number of Cushites fell that they could not recover; they were crushed before the LORD and his forces. The men of Judah carried off a large amount of plunder. 14They destroyed all the villages around Gerar, for the terror of the LORD had fallen on them. They looted all these villages, since there was much plunder there. 15They also attacked the camps of the herders and carried off droves of sheep and goats and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.",

The quart referred to is either a dry quart (slightly larger than a liter) or a liquid quart (slightly smaller than a liter), whichever is applicable. The ton referred to in the footnotes is the American ton of 2,000 pounds. These weights are calculated relative to the particular commodity involved. Accordingly, the same measure of capacity in the text may be converted into different weights in the footnotes. This table is based upon the best available information, but it is not intended to be mathematically precise; like the measurement equivalents in the footnotes, it merely gives approximate amounts and distances. Weights and measures differed somewhat at various times and places in the ancient world. There is uncertainty particularly about the ephah and the bath; further discoveries may shed more light on these units of capacity.
