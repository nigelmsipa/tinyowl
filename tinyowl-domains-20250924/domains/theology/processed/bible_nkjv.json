And the Spirit of God was\nhovering over the face of the waters.\nThen God said, \"Let there be light\"; and\nthere was light.\nAnd God saw the light, that it was good;\nand God divided the light from the\ndarkness.\nGod called the light Day, and the\ndarkness He called Night. So the\nevening and the morning were the first\nday.\nThen God said, \"Let there be a\nfirmament in the midst of the waters,\nand let it divide the waters from the\nwaters.\"\nThus God made the firmament, and\ndivided the waters which were under the\nfirmament from the waters which were\nabove the firmament; and it was so.\nAnd God called the firmament Heaven.\nSo the evening and the morning were\nthe second day.\nThen God said, \"Let the waters under\nthe heavens be gathered together into\none place, and let the dry land appear\";\nand it was so.\nAnd God called the dry land Earth, and\nthe gathering together of the waters He\ncalled Seas. And God saw that it was\ngood.\nThen God said, \"Let the earth bring\nforth grass, the herb that yields seed,\nand the fruit tree that yields fruit\naccording to its kind, whose seed is in\nitself, on the earth\"; and it was so.\nAnd the earth brought forth grass, the\nherb that yields seed according to its\nkind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose\nseed is in itself according to its kind.\nAnd God saw that it was good.\nSo the evening and the morning were\nthe third day.\nThen God said, \"Let there be lights in\nthe firmament of the heavens to divide\nthe day from the night; and let them be\nfor signs and seasons, and for days and\nyears;\nand let them be for lights in the\nfirmament of the heavens to give light\non the earth\"; and it was so.\nThen God made two great lights: the\ngreater light to rule the day, and the\nlesser light to rule the night. He made\nthe stars also.\nGod set them in the firmament of the\nheavens to give light on the earth,\nand to rule over the day and over the\nnight, and to divide the light from the\ndarkness. And God saw that it was good.\nthe sea, over the birds of the air, and\nover the cattle, over all the earth and\nover every creeping thing that creeps on\nthe earth.\"\nSo the evening and the morning were\nthe fourth day.\nThen God said, \"Let the waters\nabound with an abundance of living\ncreatures, and let birds fly above the\nearth across the face of the firmament of\nthe heavens.\"\nSo God created great sea creatures\nand every living thing that moves, with\nwhich the waters abounded, according\nto their kind, and every winged bird\naccording to its kind. And God saw that\nit was good.\nAnd God blessed them, saying, \"Be\nfruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in\nthe seas, and let birds multiply on the\nearth.\"\nSo God created man in His own\nimage; in the image of God He created\nhim; male and female He created them.\nThen God blessed them, and God said\nto them, \"Be fruitful and multiply; fill the\nearth and subdue it; have dominion over\nthe fish of the sea, over the birds of the\nair, and over every living thing that\nmoves on the earth.\"\nAnd God said, \"See, I have given you\nevery herb that yields seed which is on\nthe face of all the earth, and every tree\nwhose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be\nfor food.\nSo the evening and the morning were\nthe fifth day.\nAlso, to every beast of the earth, to\nevery bird of the air, and to everything\nthat creeps on the earth, in which there\nis life, I have given every green herb for\nfood\"; and it was so.\nThen God said, \"Let the earth bring\nforth the living creature according to its\nkind: cattle and creeping thing and beast\nof the earth, each according to its kind\";\nand it was so.\nAnd God made the beast of the earth\naccording to its kind, cattle according to\nits kind, and everything that creeps on\nthe earth according to its kind. And God\nsaw that it was good.\nThen God said, \"Let Us make man in\nOur image, according to Our likeness;\nlet them have dominion over the fish of\nThen God saw everything that He had\nmade, and indeed it was very good. So\nthe evening and the morning were the\nsixth day.\n2Thus the heavens and the earth, and\nall the host of them, were finished.\nAnd on the seventh day God ended His\nwork which He had done, and He rested\non the seventh day from all His work\nwhich He had done.\nThen God blessed the seventh day and\nsanctified it, because in it He rested\nfrom all His work which God had created\nand made.\nThis is the history of the heavens and\nthe earth when they were created, in the\nday that the LORD God made the earth\nand the heavens,\nbefore any plant of the field was in the\nearth and before any herb of the field\nhad grown. For the LORD God had not\ncaused it to rain on the earth, and there\nwas no man to till the ground;\nbut a mist went up from the earth and\nwatered the whole face of the ground.\nAnd the LORD God formed man of the\ndust of the ground, and breathed into his\nnostrils the breath of life; and man\nbecame a living being.\nThe LORD God planted a garden\neastward in Eden, and there He put the\nman whom He had formed.\nAnd out of the ground the LORD God\nmade every tree grow that is pleasant to\nthe sight and good for food. The tree of\nlife was also in the midst of the garden,\nand the tree of the knowledge of good\nand evil.\nNow a river went out of Eden to water\nthe garden, and from there it parted and\nbecame four riverheads.\nThe name of the first is Pishon; it is the\none which skirts the whole land of\nHavilah, where there is gold.\nAnd the gold of that land is good.\nBdellium and the onyx stone are there.\nThe name of the second river is Gihon;\nit is the one which goes around the\nwhole land of Cush.\nThe name of the third river is Hiddekel;\nit is the one which goes toward the east\nof Assyria. The fourth river is the\nEuphrates.\nThen the LORD God took the man and\nput him in the garden of Eden to tend\nand keep it.\nAnd the LORD God commanded the\nman, saying, \"Of every tree of the\ngarden you may freely eat;\nbut of the tree of the knowledge of\ngood and evil you shall not eat, for in the\nday that you eat of it you shall surely\ndie.\"\nAnd the LORD God said, \"It is not\ngood that man should be alone; I will\nmake him a helper comparable to him.\"\nOut of the ground the LORD God\nformed every beast of the field and\nevery bird of the air, and brought them\nto Adam to see what he would call them.\nAnd whatever Adam called each living\ncreature, that was its name.\nSo Adam gave names to all cattle, to\nthe birds of the air, and to every beast of\nthe field. But for Adam there was not\nfound a helper comparable to him.\nAnd the LORD God caused a deep\nsleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and\nHe took one of his ribs, and closed up\nthe flesh in its place.\nThen the rib which the LORD God had\ntaken from man He made into a woman,\nand He brought her to the man.\nSo when the woman saw that the tree\nwas good for food, that it was pleasant\nto the eyes, and a tree desirable to\nmake one wise, she took of its fruit and\nate. She also gave to her husband with\nher, and he ate.\nAnd Adam said: \"This is now bone of\nmy bones And flesh of my flesh; She\nshall be called Woman, Because she\nwas taken out of Man.\"\nThen the eyes of both of them were\nopened, and they knew that they were\nnaked; and they sewed fig leaves\ntogether\nand\nmade\nthemselves\ncoverings.\nTherefore a man shall leave his father\nand mother and be joined to his wife,\nand they shall become one flesh.\nAnd they were both naked, the man\nand his wife, and were not ashamed.\n3Now the serpent was more cunning\nthan any beast of the field which the\nLORD God had made. And he said to\nthe woman, \"Has God indeed said, \"You\nshall not eat of every tree of the\ngarden'?\"\nAnd the woman said to the serpent,\n\"We may eat the fruit of the trees of the\ngarden;\nbut of the fruit of the tree which is in the\nmidst of the garden, God has said, \"You\nshall not eat it, nor shall you touch it,\nlest you die.\"'\nThen the serpent said to the woman,\n\"You will not surely die.\nFor God knows that in the day you eat\nof it your eyes will be opened, and you\nwill be like God, knowing good and evil.\"\nAnd they heard the sound of the LORD\nGod walking in the garden in the cool of\nthe day, and Adam and his wife hid\nthemselves from the presence of the\nLORD God among the trees of the\ngarden.\nThen the LORD God called to Adam\nand said to him, \"Where are you?\"\nSo he said, \"I heard Your voice in the\ngarden, and I was afraid because I was\nnaked; and I hid myself.\"\nAnd He said, \"Who told you that you\nwere naked? Have you eaten from the\ntree of which I commanded you that you\nshould not eat?\"\nThen the man said, \"The woman\nwhom You gave to be with me, she\ngave me of the tree, and I ate.\"\nAnd the LORD God said to the woman,\n\"What is this you have done?\" The\nwoman said, \"The serpent deceived me,\nand I ate.\"\nSo the LORD God said to the serpent:\n\"Because you have done this, You are\ncursed more than all cattle, And more\nthan every beast of the field; On your\nbelly you shall go, And you shall eat\ndust All the days of your life.\nAnd I will put enmity Between you and\nthe woman, And between your seed and\nher Seed; He shall bruise your head,\nAnd you shall bruise His heel.\"\nTo the woman He said: \"I will greatly\nmultiply\nyour\nsorrow\nand\nyour\nconception; In pain you shall bring forth\nchildren; Your desire shall be for your\nhusband, And he shall rule over you.\"\nThen to Adam He said, \"Because you\nhave heeded the voice of your wife, and\nhave eaten from the tree of which I\ncommanded you, saying, \"You shall not\neat of it': \"Cursed is the ground for your\nsake; In toil you shall eat of it All the\ndays of your life.\nBoth thorns and thistles it shall bring\nforth for you, And you shall eat the herb\nof the field.\nIn the sweat of your face you shall eat\nbread Till you return to the ground, For\nout of it you were taken; For dust you\nare, And to dust you shall return.\"\nAnd Adam called his wife's name Eve,\nbecause she was the mother of all living.\nAlso for Adam and his wife the LORD\nGod made tunics of skin, and clothed\nthem.\nThen the LORD God said, \"Behold, the\nman has become like one of Us, to\nknow good and evil. And now, lest he\nput out his hand and take also of the\ntree of life, and eat, and live forever\"-23\ntherefore the LORD God sent him out\nof the garden of Eden to till the ground\nfrom which he was taken.\nSo He drove out the man; and He\nplaced cherubim at the east of the\ngarden of Eden, and a flaming sword\nwhich turned every way, to guard the\nway to the tree of life.\n4Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and\nshe conceived and bore Cain, and said,\n\"I have acquired a man from the LORD.\"\nThen she bore again, this time his\nbrother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of\nsheep, but Cain was a tiller of the\nground.\nAnd in the process of time it came to\npass that Cain brought an offering of the\nfruit of the ground to the LORD.\nAbel also brought of the firstborn of his\nflock and of their fat. And the LORD\nrespected Abel and his offering,\nbut He did not respect Cain and his\noffering. And Cain was very angry, and\nhis countenance fell.\nSo the LORD said to Cain, \"Why are\nyou angry? And why has your\ncountenance fallen?\nIf you do well, will you not be accepted?\nAnd if you do not do well, sin lies at the\ndoor. And its desire is for you, but you\nshould rule over it.\"\nNow Cain talked with Abel his brother;\nand it came to pass, when they were in\nthe field, that Cain rose up against Abel\nhis brother and killed him.\nAnd Cain knew his wife, and she\nconceived and bore Enoch. And he built\na city, and called the name of the city\nafter the name of his son--Enoch.\nThen the LORD said to Cain, \"Where is\nAbel your brother?\" He said, \"I do not\nknow. Am I my brother's keeper?\"\nTo Enoch was born Irad; and Irad\nbegot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot\nMethushael, and Methushael begot\nLamech.\nAnd He said, \"What have you done?\nThe voice of your brother's blood cries\nout to Me from the ground.\nThen Lamech took for himself two\nwives: the name of one was Adah, and\nthe name of the second was Zillah.\nSo now you are cursed from the earth,\nwhich has opened its mouth to receive\nyour brother's blood from your hand.\nAnd Adah bore Jabal. He was the\nfather of those who dwell in tents and\nhave livestock.\nWhen you till the ground, it shall no\nlonger yield its strength to you. A fugitive\nand a vagabond you shall be on the\nearth.\"\nHis brother's name was Jubal. He was\nthe father of all those who play the harp\nand flute.\nAnd Cain said to the LORD, \"My\npunishment is greater than I can bear!\nSurely You have driven me out this\nday from the face of the ground; I shall\nbe hidden from Your face; I shall be a\nfugitive and a vagabond on the earth,\nand it will happen that anyone who finds\nme will kill me.\"\nAnd as for Zillah, she also bore TubalCain, an instructor of every craftsman in\nbronze and iron. And the sister of TubalCain was Naamah.\nThen Lamech said to his wives: \"Adah\nand Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of\nLamech, listen to my speech! For I have\nkilled a man for wounding me, Even a\nyoung man for hurting me.\nAnd the LORD said to him, \"Therefore,\nwhoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be\ntaken on him sevenfold.\" And the LORD\nset a mark on Cain, lest anyone finding\nhim should kill him.\nThen Cain went out from the presence\nof the LORD and dwelt in the land of\nNod on the east of Eden.\nIf Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,\nThen Lamech seventy-sevenfold.\"\nAnd Adam knew his wife again, and\nshe bore a son and named him Seth,\n\"For God has appointed another seed\nfor me instead of Abel, whom Cain\nkilled.\"\nAnd as for Seth, to him also a son was\nborn; and he named him Enosh. Then\nmen began to call on the name of the\nLORD.\nAfter he begot Cainan, Enosh lived\neight hundred and fifteen years, and had\nsons and daughters.\n5This is the book of the genealogy of\nSo all the days of Enosh were nine\nhundred and five years; and he died.\nAdam. In the day that God created man,\nHe made him in the likeness of God.\nCainan lived seventy years, and begot\nMahalalel.\nHe created them male and female, and\nblessed them and called them Mankind\nin the day they were created.\nAfter he begot Mahalalel, Cainan lived\neight hundred and forty years, and had\nsons and daughters.\nAnd Adam lived one hundred and thirty\nyears, and begot a son in his own\nlikeness, after his image, and named\nhim Seth.\nSo all the days of Cainan were nine\nhundred and ten years; and he died.\nMahalalel lived sixty-five years, and\nbegot Jared.\nAfter he begot Seth, the days of Adam\nwere eight hundred years; and he had\nsons and daughters.\nAfter he begot Jared, Mahalalel lived\neight hundred and thirty years, and had\nsons and daughters.\nSo all the days that Adam lived were\nnine hundred and thirty years; and he\ndied.\nSo all the days of Mahalalel were eight\nhundred and ninety-five years; and he\ndied.\nSeth lived one hundred and five years,\nand begot Enosh.\nJared lived one hundred and sixty-two\nyears, and begot Enoch.\nAfter he begot Enosh, Seth lived eight\nhundred and seven years, and had sons\nand daughters.\nAfter he begot Enoch, Jared lived eight\nhundred years, and had sons and\ndaughters.\nSo all the days of Seth were nine\nhundred and twelve years; and he died.\nEnosh lived ninety years, and begot\nCainan.\nSo all the days of Jared were nine\nhundred and sixty-two years; and he\ndied.\nEnoch lived sixty-five years, and begot\nMethuselah.\nAfter he begot Methuselah, Enoch\nwalked with God three hundred years,\nand had sons and daughters.\nSo all the days of Enoch were three\nhundred and sixty-five years.\n6Now it came to pass, when men\nbegan to multiply on the face of the\nearth, and daughters were born to them,\nAnd Enoch walked with God; and he\nwas not, for God took him.\nthat the sons of God saw the daughters\nof men, that they were beautiful; and\nthey took wives for themselves of all\nwhom they chose.\nMethuselah lived one hundred and\neighty-seven years, and begot Lamech.\nAfter he begot Lamech, Methuselah\nlived seven hundred and eighty-two\nyears, and had sons and daughters.\nSo all the days of Methuselah were\nnine hundred and sixty-nine years; and\nhe died.\nAnd the LORD said, \"My Spirit shall not\nstrive with man forever, for he is indeed\nflesh; yet his days shall be one hundred\nand twenty years.\"\nThere were giants on the earth in those\ndays, and also afterward, when the sons\nof God came in to the daughters of men\nand they bore children to them. Those\nwere the mighty men who were of old,\nmen of renown.\nLamech lived one hundred and eightytwo years, and had a son.\nAnd he called his name Noah, saying,\n\"This one will comfort us concerning our\nwork and the toil of our hands, because\nof the ground which the LORD has\ncursed.\"\nAfter he begot Noah, Lamech lived five\nhundred and ninety-five years, and had\nsons and daughters.\nThen the LORD saw that the\nwickedness of man was great in the\nearth, and that every intent of the\nthoughts of his heart was only evil\ncontinually.\nAnd the LORD was sorry that He had\nmade man on the earth, and He was\ngrieved in His heart.\nSo all the days of Lamech were seven\nhundred and seventy-seven years; and\nhe died.\nSo the LORD said, \"I will destroy man\nwhom I have created from the face of\nthe earth, both man and beast, creeping\nthing and birds of the air, for I am sorry\nthat I have made them.\"\nAnd Noah was five hundred years old,\nand Noah begot Shem, Ham, and\nJapheth.\nBut Noah found grace in the eyes of the\nLORD.\nThis is the genealogy of Noah. Noah\nwas a just man, perfect in his\ngenerations. Noah walked with God.\nyour sons, your wife, and your sons'\nwives with you.\nAnd Noah begot three sons: Shem,\nHam, and Japheth.\nAnd of every living thing of all flesh\nyou shall bring two of every sort into the\nark, to keep them alive with you; they\nshall be male and female.\nThe earth also was corrupt before God,\nand the earth was filled with violence.\nSo God looked upon the earth, and\nindeed it was corrupt; for all flesh had\ncorrupted their way on the earth.\nOf the birds after their kind, of animals\nafter their kind, and of every creeping\nthing of the earth after its kind, two of\nevery kind will come to you to keep\nthem alive.\nAnd God said to Noah, \"The end of all\nflesh has come before Me, for the earth\nis filled with violence through them; and\nbehold, I will destroy them with the earth.\nAnd you shall take for yourself of all\nfood that is eaten, and you shall gather\nit to yourself; and it shall be food for you\nand for them.\"\nMake yourself an ark of gopherwood;\nmake rooms in the ark, and cover it\ninside and outside with pitch.\nAnd this is how you shall make it: The\nlength of the ark shall be three hundred\ncubits, its width fifty cubits, and its\nheight thirty cubits.\nYou shall make a window for the ark,\nand you shall finish it to a cubit from\nabove; and set the door of the ark in its\nside. You shall make it with lower,\nsecond, and third decks.\nThus Noah did; according to all that\nGod commanded him, so he did.\n7Then the LORD said to Noah, \"Come\ninto the ark, you and all your household,\nbecause I have seen that you are\nrighteous before Me in this generation.\nYou shall take with you seven each of\nevery clean animal, a male and his\nfemale; two each of animals that are\nunclean, a male and his female;\nAnd behold, I Myself am bringing\nfloodwaters on the earth, to destroy from\nunder heaven all flesh in which is the\nbreath of life; everything that is on the\nearth shall die.\nBut I will establish My covenant with\nyou; and you shall go into the ark--you,\nalso seven each of birds of the air,\nmale and female, to keep the species\nalive on the face of all the earth.\nFor after seven more days I will cause it\nto rain on the earth forty days and forty\nnights, and I will destroy from the face of\nthe earth all living things that I have\nmade.\"\nAnd Noah did according to all that the\nLORD commanded him.\nAnd they went into the ark to Noah,\ntwo by two, of all flesh in which is the\nbreath of life.\nNoah was six hundred years old when\nthe floodwaters were on the earth.\nSo Noah, with his sons, his wife, and\nhis sons' wives, went into the ark\nbecause of the waters of the flood.\nOf clean animals, of animals that are\nunclean, of birds, and of everything that\ncreeps on the earth,\nSo those that entered, male and\nfemale of all flesh, went in as God had\ncommanded him; and the LORD shut\nhim in.\nNow the flood was on the earth forty\ndays. The waters increased and lifted up\nthe ark, and it rose high above the earth.\ntwo by two they went into the ark to\nNoah, male and female, as God had\ncommanded Noah.\nThe waters prevailed and greatly\nincreased on the earth, and the ark\nmoved about on the surface of the\nwaters.\nAnd it came to pass after seven days\nthat the waters of the flood were on the\nearth.\nAnd the waters prevailed exceedingly\non the earth, and all the high hills under\nthe whole heaven were covered.\nIn the six hundredth year of Noah's life,\nin the second month, the seventeenth\nday of the month, on that day all the\nfountains of the great deep were broken\nup, and the windows of heaven were\nopened.\nAnd the rain was on the earth forty\ndays and forty nights.\nOn the very same day Noah and\nNoah's sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth,\nand Noah's wife and the three wives of\nhis sons with them, entered the ark-14\nthey and every beast after its kind, all\ncattle after their kind, every creeping\nthing that creeps on the earth after its\nkind, and every bird after its kind, every\nbird of every sort.\nThe waters prevailed fifteen cubits\nupward, and the mountains were\ncovered.\nAnd all flesh died that moved on the\nearth: birds and cattle and beasts and\nevery creeping thing that creeps on the\nearth, and every man.\nAll in whose nostrils was the breath of\nthe spirit of life, all that was on the dry\nland, died.\nSo He destroyed all living things which\nwere on the face of the ground: both\nman and cattle, creeping thing and bird\nof the air. They were destroyed from the\nearth. Only Noah and those who were\nwith him in the ark remained alive.\nAnd the waters prevailed on the earth\none hundred and fifty days.\n8Then God remembered Noah, and\nevery living thing, and all the animals\nthat were with him in the ark. And God\nmade a wind to pass over the earth, and\nthe waters subsided.\nThe fountains of the deep and the\nwindows of heaven were also stopped,\nand the rain from heaven was restrained.\nAnd the waters receded continually\nfrom the earth. At the end of the\nhundred and fifty days the waters\ndecreased.\nThen the ark rested in the seventh\nmonth, the seventeenth day of the\nmonth, on the mountains of Ararat.\nAnd the waters decreased continually\nuntil the tenth month. In the tenth month,\non the first day of the month, the tops of\nthe mountains were seen.\nSo it came to pass, at the end of forty\ndays, that Noah opened the window of\nthe ark which he had made.\nThen he sent out a raven, which kept\ngoing to and fro until the waters had\ndried up from the earth.\nHe also sent out from himself a dove, to\nsee if the waters had receded from the\nface of the ground.\nBut the dove found no resting place for\nthe sole of her foot, and she returned\ninto the ark to him, for the waters were\non the face of the whole earth. So he\nput out his hand and took her, and drew\nher into the ark to himself.\nAnd he waited yet another seven days,\nand again he sent the dove out from the\nark.\nThen the dove came to him in the\nevening, and behold, a freshly plucked\nolive leaf was in her mouth; and Noah\nknew that the waters had receded from\nthe earth.\nSo he waited yet another seven days\nand sent out the dove, which did not\nreturn again to him anymore.\nAnd it came to pass in the six hundred\nand first year, in the first month, the first\nday of the month, that the waters were\ndried up from the earth; and Noah\nremoved the covering of the ark and\nlooked, and indeed the surface of the\nground was dry.\nAnd in the second month, on the\ntwenty-seventh day of the month, the\nearth was dried.\nThen God spoke to Noah, saying,\n\"Go out of the ark, you and your wife,\nand your sons and your sons' wives with\nyou.\nBring out with you every living thing of\nall flesh that is with you: birds and cattle\nand every creeping thing that creeps on\nthe earth, so that they may abound on\nthe earth, and be fruitful and multiply on\nthe earth.\"\nSo Noah went out, and his sons and\nhis wife and his sons' wives with him.\nEvery animal, every creeping thing,\nevery bird, and whatever creeps on the\nearth, according to their families, went\nout of the ark.\nThen Noah built an altar to the LORD,\nand took of every clean animal and of\nevery clean bird, and offered burnt\nofferings on the altar.\nSurely for your lifeblood I will demand a\nreckoning; from the hand of every beast\nI will require it, and from the hand of\nman. From the hand of every man's\nbrother I will require the life of man.\n\"Whoever sheds man's blood, By man\nhis blood shall be shed; For in the image\nof God He made man.\nAnd as for you, be fruitful and multiply;\nBring forth abundantly in the earth And\nmultiply in it.\"\nAnd the LORD smelled a soothing\naroma. Then the LORD said in His heart,\n\"I will never again curse the ground for\nman's sake, although the imagination of\nman's heart is evil from his youth; nor\nwill I again destroy every living thing as I\nhave done.\nThen God spoke to Noah and to his\nsons with him, saying:\n\"And as for Me, behold, I establish My\ncovenant with you and with your\ndescendants after you,\n\"While the earth remains, Seedtime\nand harvest, Cold and heat, Winter and\nsummer, And day and night Shall not\ncease.\"\nand with every living creature that is\nwith you: the birds, the cattle, and every\nbeast of the earth with you, of all that go\nout of the ark, every beast of the earth.\n9So God blessed Noah and his sons,\nand said to them: \"Be fruitful and\nmultiply, and fill the earth.\nThus I establish My covenant with you:\nNever again shall all flesh be cut off by\nthe waters of the flood; never again shall\nthere be a flood to destroy the earth.\"\nAnd the fear of you and the dread of\nyou shall be on every beast of the earth,\non every bird of the air, on all that move\non the earth, and on all the fish of the\nsea. They are given into your hand.\nEvery moving thing that lives shall be\nfood for you. I have given you all things,\neven as the green herbs.\nBut you shall not eat flesh with its life,\nthat is, its blood.\nAnd God said: \"This is the sign of the\ncovenant which I make between Me and\nyou, and every living creature that is\nwith you, for perpetual generations:\nI set My rainbow in the cloud, and it\nshall be for the sign of the covenant\nbetween Me and the earth.\nIt shall be, when I bring a cloud over\nthe earth, that the rainbow shall be seen\nin the cloud;\nand I will remember My covenant\nwhich is between Me and you and every\nliving creature of all flesh; the waters\nshall never again become a flood to\ndestroy all flesh.\nThe rainbow shall be in the cloud, and\nI will look on it to remember the\neverlasting covenant between God and\nevery living creature of all flesh that is\non the earth.\"\nAnd God said to Noah, \"This is the\nsign of the covenant which I have\nestablished between Me and all flesh\nthat is on the earth.\"\nSo Noah awoke from his wine, and\nknew what his younger son had done to\nhim.\nThen he said: \"Cursed be Canaan; A\nservant of servants He shall be to his\nbrethren.\"\nAnd he said: \"Blessed be the LORD,\nThe God of Shem, And may Canaan be\nhis servant.\nMay God enlarge Japheth, And may\nhe dwell in the tents of Shem; And may\nCanaan be his servant.\"\nNow the sons of Noah who went out of\nthe ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\nAnd Ham was the father of Canaan.\nThese three were the sons of Noah,\nand from these the whole earth was\npopulated.\nAnd Noah began to be a farmer, and\nhe planted a vineyard.\nThen he drank of the wine and was\ndrunk, and became uncovered in his\ntent.\nAnd Ham, the father of Canaan, saw\nthe nakedness of his father, and told his\ntwo brothers outside.\nBut Shem and Japheth took a garment,\nlaid it on both their shoulders, and went\nbackward and covered the nakedness of\ntheir father. Their faces were turned\naway, and they did not see their father's\nnakedness.\nAnd Noah lived after the flood three\nhundred and fifty years.\nSo all the days of Noah were nine\nhundred and fifty years; and he died.\n10Now this is the genealogy of the\nsons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\nAnd sons were born to them after the\nflood.\nThe sons of Japheth were Gomer,\nMagog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech,\nand Tiras.\nThe sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz,\nRiphath, and Togarmah.\nThe sons of Javan were Elishah,\nTarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.\nFrom these the coastland peoples of\nthe Gentiles were separated into their\nlands, everyone according to his\nlanguage, according to their families,\ninto their nations.\nthe Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the\nHamathite. Afterward the families of the\nCanaanites were dispersed.\nThe sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim,\nPut, and Canaan.\nThe sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah,\nSabtah, Raamah, and Sabtechah; and\nthe sons of Raamah were Sheba and\nDedan.\nCush begot Nimrod; he began to be a\nmighty one on the earth.\nAnd the border of the Canaanites was\nfrom Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as\nfar as Gaza; then as you go toward\nSodom,\nGomorrah,\nAdmah,\nand\nZeboiim, as far as Lasha.\nThese were the sons of Ham,\naccording to their families, according to\ntheir languages, in their lands and in\ntheir nations.\nHe was a mighty hunter before the\nLORD; therefore it is said, \"Like Nimrod\nthe mighty hunter before the LORD.\"\nAnd children were born also to Shem,\nthe father of all the children of Eber, the\nbrother of Japheth the elder.\nAnd the beginning of his kingdom was\nBabel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the\nland of Shinar.\nThe sons of Shem were Elam, Asshur,\nArphaxad, Lud, and Aram.\nFrom that land he went to Assyria and\nbuilt Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,\nThe sons of Aram were Uz, Hul,\nGether, and Mash.\nand Resen between Nineveh and\nCalah (that is the principal city).\nArphaxad begot Salah, and Salah\nbegot Eber.\nMizraim begot Ludim,\nLehabim, Naphtuhim,\nAnamim,\nPathrusim, and Casluhim (from whom\ncame the Philistines and Caphtorim).\nCanaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and\nHeth;\nTo Eber were born two sons: the name\nof one was Peleg, for in his days the\nearth was divided; and his brother's\nname was Joktan.\nJoktan begot Almodad,\nHazarmaveth, Jerah,\nSheleph,\nHadoram, Uzal, Diklah,\nthe Jebusite, the Amorite, and the\nGirgashite;\nthe Hivite, the Arkite, and the Sinite;\nObal, Abimael, Sheba,\nOphir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these\nwere the sons of Joktan.\nAnd their dwelling place was from\nMesha as you go toward Sephar, the\nmountain of the east.\nCome, let Us go down and there\nconfuse their language, that they may\nnot understand one another's speech.\"\nThese were the sons of Shem,\naccording to their families, according to\ntheir languages, in their lands, according\nto their nations.\nSo the LORD scattered them abroad\nfrom there over the face of all the earth,\nand they ceased building the city.\nThese were the families of the sons of\nNoah, according to their generations, in\ntheir nations; and from these the nations\nwere divided on the earth after the flood.\n11Now the whole earth had one\nlanguage and one speech.\nAnd it came to pass, as they journeyed\nfrom the east, that they found a plain in\nthe land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.\nThen they said to one another, \"Come,\nlet us make bricks and bake them\nthoroughly.\" They had brick for stone,\nand they had asphalt for mortar.\nAnd they said, \"Come, let us build\nourselves a city, and a tower whose top\nis in the heavens; let us make a name\nfor ourselves, lest we be scattered\nabroad over the face of the whole\nearth.\"\nBut the LORD came down to see the\ncity and the tower which the sons of\nmen had built.\nTherefore its name is called Babel,\nbecause there the LORD confused the\nlanguage of all the earth; and from there\nthe LORD scattered them abroad over\nthe face of all the earth.\nThis is the genealogy of Shem: Shem\nwas one hundred years old, and begot\nArphaxad two years after the flood.\nAfter he begot Arphaxad, Shem lived\nfive hundred years, and begot sons and\ndaughters.\nArphaxad lived thirty-five years, and\nbegot Salah.\nAfter he begot Salah, Arphaxad lived\nfour hundred and three years, and begot\nsons and daughters.\nSalah lived thirty years, and begot\nEber.\nAfter he begot Eber, Salah lived four\nhundred and three years, and begot\nsons and daughters.\nEber lived thirty-four years, and begot\nPeleg.\nAnd the LORD said, \"Indeed the people\nare one and they all have one language,\nand this is what they begin to do; now\nnothing that they propose to do will be\nwithheld from them.\nAfter he begot Peleg, Eber lived four\nhundred and thirty years, and begot\nsons and daughters.\nPeleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu.\nAfter he begot Reu, Peleg lived two\nhundred and nine years, and begot sons\nand daughters.\nReu lived thirty-two years, and begot\nSerug.\nBut Sarai was barren; she had no child.\nAnd Terah took his son Abram and his\ngrandson Lot, the son of Haran, and his\ndaughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram's\nwife, and they went out with them from\nUr of the Chaldeans to go to the land of\nCanaan; and they came to Haran and\ndwelt there.\nAfter he begot Serug, Reu lived two\nhundred and seven years, and begot\nsons and daughters.\nSo the days of Terah were two\nhundred and five years, and Terah died\nin Haran.\nSerug lived thirty years, and begot\nNahor.\n12Now the LORD had said to\nAfter he begot Nahor, Serug lived two\nhundred years, and begot sons and\ndaughters.\nAbram: \"Get out of your country, From\nyour family And from your father's house,\nTo a land that I will show you.\nNahor lived twenty-nine years, and\nbegot Terah.\nI will make you a great nation; I will\nbless you And make your name great;\nAnd you shall be a blessing.\nAfter he begot Terah, Nahor lived one\nhundred and nineteen years, and begot\nsons and daughters.\nNow Terah lived seventy years, and\nbegot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.\nI will bless those who bless you, And I\nwill curse him who curses you; And in\nyou all the families of the earth shall be\nblessed.\"\nThis is the genealogy of Terah: Terah\nbegot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran\nbegot Lot.\nSo Abram departed as the LORD had\nspoken to him, and Lot went with him.\nAnd Abram was seventy-five years old\nwhen he departed from Haran.\nAnd Haran died before his father\nTerah in his native land, in Ur of the\nChaldeans.\nThen Abram and Nahor took wives:\nthe name of Abram's wife was Sarai,\nand the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah,\nthe daughter of Haran the father of\nMilcah and the father of Iscah.\nThen Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot\nhis brother's son, and all their\npossessions that they had gathered,\nand the people whom they had acquired\nin Haran, and they departed to go to the\nland of Canaan. So they came to the\nland of Canaan.\nAbram passed through the land to the\nplace of Shechem, as far as the\nterebinth tree of Moreh. And the\nCanaanites were then in the land.\nThe princes of Pharaoh also saw her\nand commended her to Pharaoh. And\nthe woman was taken to Pharaoh's\nhouse.\nThen the LORD appeared to Abram\nand said, \"To your descendants I will\ngive this land.\" And there he built an\naltar to the LORD, who had appeared to\nhim.\nHe treated Abram well for her sake.\nHe had sheep, oxen, male donkeys,\nmale and female servants, female\ndonkeys, and camels.\nAnd he moved from there to the\nmountain east of Bethel, and he pitched\nhis tent with Bethel on the west and Ai\non the east; there he built an altar to the\nLORD and called on the name of the\nLORD.\nSo Abram journeyed, going on still\ntoward the South.\nNow there was a famine in the land,\nand Abram went down to Egypt to dwell\nthere, for the famine was severe in the\nland.\nAnd it came to pass, when he was\nclose to entering Egypt, that he said to\nSarai his wife, \"Indeed I know that you\nare a woman of beautiful countenance.\nTherefore it will happen, when the\nEgyptians see you, that they will say,\n\"This is his wife'; and they will kill me,\nbut they will let you live.\nPlease say you are my sister, that it\nmay be well with me for your sake, and\nthat I may live because of you.\"\nSo it was, when Abram came into\nEgypt, that the Egyptians saw the\nwoman, that she was very beautiful.\nBut the LORD plagued Pharaoh and\nhis house with great plagues because of\nSarai, Abram's wife.\nAnd Pharaoh called Abram and said,\n\"What is this you have done to me? Why\ndid you not tell me that she was your\nwife?\nWhy did you say, \"She is my sister'? I\nmight have taken her as my wife. Now\ntherefore, here is your wife; take her and\ngo your way.\"\nSo Pharaoh commanded his men\nconcerning him; and they sent him away,\nwith his wife and all that he had.\n13Then Abram went up from Egypt,\nhe and his wife and all that he had, and\nLot with him, to the South.\nAbram was very rich in livestock, in\nsilver, and in gold.\nAnd he went on his journey from the\nSouth as far as Bethel, to the place\nwhere his tent had been at the\nbeginning, between Bethel and Ai,\nto the place of the altar which he had\nmade there at first. And there Abram\ncalled on the name of the LORD.\nand pitched his tent even as far as\nSodom.\nLot also, who went with Abram, had\nflocks and herds and tents.\nBut the men of Sodom were\nexceedingly wicked and sinful against\nthe LORD.\nNow the land was not able to support\nthem, that they might dwell together, for\ntheir possessions were so great that\nthey could not dwell together.\nAnd the LORD said to Abram, after Lot\nhad separated from him: \"Lift your eyes\nnow and look from the place where you\nare--northward, southward, eastward,\nand westward;\nAnd there was strife between the\nherdsmen of Abram's livestock and the\nherdsmen of Lot's livestock. The\nCanaanites and the Perizzites then\ndwelt in the land.\nSo Abram said to Lot, \"Please let there\nbe no strife between you and me, and\nbetween my herdsmen and your\nherdsmen; for we are brethren.\nfor all the land which you see I give to\nyou and your descendants forever.\nAnd I will make your descendants as\nthe dust of the earth; so that if a man\ncould number the dust of the earth, then\nyour descendants also could be\nnumbered.\nIs not the whole land before you?\nPlease separate from me. If you take\nthe left, then I will go to the right; or, if\nyou go to the right, then I will go to the\nleft.\"\nAnd Lot lifted his eyes and saw all the\nplain of Jordan, that it was well watered\neverywhere\n(before\nthe\nLORD\ndestroyed Sodom and Gomorrah) like\nthe garden of the LORD, like the land of\nEgypt as you go toward Zoar.\nThen Lot chose for himself all the plain\nof Jordan, and Lot journeyed east. And\nthey separated from each other.\nAbram dwelt in the land of Canaan,\nand Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain\nArise, walk in the land through its\nlength and its width, for I give it to you.\"\nThen Abram moved his tent, and went\nand dwelt by the terebinth trees of\nMamre, which are in Hebron, and built\nan altar there to the LORD.\n14And it came to pass in the days of\nAmraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of\nEllasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and\nTidal king of nations,\nthat they made war with Bera king of\nSodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah,\nShinab king of Admah, Shemeber king\nof Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is,\nZoar).\nAll these joined together in the Valley of\nSiddim (that is, the Salt Sea).\nThey also took Lot, Abram's brother's\nson who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods,\nand departed.\nTwelve\nyears\nthey\nserved\nChedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year\nthey rebelled.\nIn the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer\nand the kings that were with him came\nand attacked the Rephaim in Ashteroth\nKarnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in\nShaveh Kiriathaim,\nand the Horites in their mountain of Seir,\nas far as El Paran, which is by the\nwilderness.\nThen they turned back and came to En\nMishpat (that is, Kadesh), and attacked\nall the country of the Amalekites, and\nalso the Amorites who dwelt in Hazezon\nTamar.\nAnd the king of Sodom, the king of\nGomorrah, the king of Admah, the king\nof Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is,\nZoar) went out and joined together in\nbattle in the Valley of Siddim\nagainst Chedorlaomer king of Elam,\nTidal king of nations, Amraphel king of\nShinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar--four\nkings against five.\nNow the Valley of Siddim was full of\nasphalt pits; and the kings of Sodom\nand Gomorrah fled; some fell there, and\nthe remainder fled to the mountains.\nThen one who had escaped came and\ntold Abram the Hebrew, for he dwelt by\nthe terebinth trees of Mamre the Amorite,\nbrother of Eshcol and brother of Aner;\nand they were allies with Abram.\nNow when Abram heard that his\nbrother was taken captive, he armed his\nthree hundred and eighteen trained\nservants who were born in his own\nhouse, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.\nHe divided his forces against them by\nnight, and he and his servants attacked\nthem and pursued them as far as Hobah,\nwhich is north of Damascus.\nSo he brought back all the goods, and\nalso brought back his brother Lot and\nhis goods, as well as the women and\nthe people.\nAnd the king of Sodom went out to\nmeet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is,\nthe King's Valley), after his return from\nthe defeat of Chedorlaomer and the\nkings who were with him.\nThen Melchizedek king of Salem\nbrought out bread and wine; he was the\npriest of God Most High.\nAnd he blessed him and said:\n\"Blessed be Abram of God Most High,\nPossessor of heaven and earth;\nThen they took all the goods of Sodom\nand Gomorrah, and all their provisions,\nand went their way.\nAnd blessed be God Most High, Who\nhas delivered your enemies into your\nhand.\" And he gave him a tithe of all.\nNow the king of Sodom said to Abram,\n\"Give me the persons, and take the\ngoods for yourself.\"\nthem.\" And He said to him, \"So shall\nyour descendants be.\"\nBut Abram said to the king of Sodom,\n\"I have raised my hand to the LORD,\nGod Most High, the Possessor of\nheaven and earth,\nthat I will take nothing, from a thread to\na sandal strap, and that I will not take\nanything that is yours, lest you should\nsay, \"I have made Abram rich'-24\nAnd he believed in the LORD, and He\naccounted it to him for righteousness.\nThen He said to him, \"I am the LORD,\nwho brought you out of Ur of the\nChaldeans, to give you this land to\ninherit it.\"\nAnd he said, \"Lord GOD, how shall I\nknow that I will inherit it?\"\nexcept only what the young men have\neaten, and the portion of the men who\nwent with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre;\nlet them take their portion.\"\nSo He said to him, \"Bring Me a threeyear-old heifer, a three-year-old female\ngoat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove,\nand a young pigeon.\"\n15After these things the word of the\nLORD came to Abram in a vision,\nsaying, \"Do not be afraid, Abram. I am\nyour shield, your exceedingly great\nreward.\"\nThen he brought all these to Him and\ncut them in two, down the middle, and\nplaced each piece opposite the other;\nbut he did not cut the birds in two.\nAnd when the vultures came down on\nthe carcasses, Abram drove them away.\nBut Abram said, \"Lord GOD, what will\nYou give me, seeing I go childless, and\nthe heir of my house is Eliezer of\nDamascus?\"\nNow when the sun was going down, a\ndeep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold,\nhorror and great darkness fell upon him.\nThen Abram said, \"Look, You have\ngiven me no offspring; indeed one born\nin my house is my heir!\"\nAnd behold, the word of the LORD\ncame to him, saying, \"This one shall not\nbe your heir, but one who will come from\nyour own body shall be your heir.\"\nThen He brought him outside and said,\n\"Look now toward heaven, and count\nthe stars if you are able to number\nThen He said to Abram: \"Know\ncertainly that your descendants will be\nstrangers in a land that is not theirs, and\nwill serve them, and they will afflict them\nfour hundred years.\nAnd also the nation whom they serve I\nwill judge; afterward they shall come out\nwith great possessions.\nNow as for you, you shall go to your\nfathers in peace; you shall be buried at\na good old age.\nher husband Abram to be his wife, after\nAbram had dwelt ten years in the land of\nCanaan.\nBut in the fourth generation they shall\nreturn here, for the iniquity of the\nAmorites is not yet complete.\"\nSo he went in to Hagar, and she\nconceived. And when she saw that she\nhad conceived, her mistress became\ndespised in her eyes.\nAnd it came to pass, when the sun\nwent down and it was dark, that behold,\nthere appeared a smoking oven and a\nburning torch that passed between\nthose pieces.\nOn the same day the LORD made a\ncovenant with Abram, saying: \"To your\ndescendants I have given this land, from\nthe river of Egypt to the great river, the\nRiver Euphrates-19\nthe Kenites,\nKadmonites,\nthe\nthe\nthe Hittites,\nRephaim,\nKenezzites,\nPerizzites,\nthe\nthe\nthe Amorites, the Canaanites, the\nGirgashites, and the Jebusites.\"\n16Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had\nborne him no children. And she had an\nEgyptian maidservant whose name was\nHagar.\nSo Sarai said to Abram, \"See now, the\nLORD has restrained me from bearing\nchildren. Please, go in to my maid;\nperhaps I shall obtain children by her.\"\nAnd Abram heeded the voice of Sarai.\nThen Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar\nher maid, the Egyptian, and gave her to\nThen Sarai said to Abram, \"My wrong\nbe upon you! I gave my maid into your\nembrace; and when she saw that she\nhad conceived, I became despised in\nher eyes. The LORD judge between you\nand me.\"\nSo Abram said to Sarai, \"Indeed your\nmaid is in your hand; do to her as you\nplease.\" And when Sarai dealt harshly\nwith her, she fled from her presence.\nNow the Angel of the LORD found her\nby a spring of water in the wilderness,\nby the spring on the way to Shur.\nAnd He said, \"Hagar, Sarai's maid,\nwhere have you come from, and where\nare you going?\" She said, \"I am fleeing\nfrom the presence of my mistress\nSarai.\"\nThe Angel of the LORD said to her,\n\"Return to your mistress, and submit\nyourself under her hand.\"\nThen the Angel of the LORD said to\nher, \"I will multiply your descendants\nexceedingly, so that they shall not be\ncounted for multitude.\"\nAnd the Angel of the LORD said to\nher: \"Behold, you are with child, And you\nshall bear a son. You shall call his name\nIshmael, Because the LORD has heard\nyour affliction.\nHe shall be a wild man; His hand shall\nbe against every man, And every man's\nhand against him. And he shall dwell in\nthe presence of all his brethren.\"\nNo longer shall your name be called\nAbram, but your name shall be\nAbraham; for I have made you a father\nof many nations.\nI will make you exceedingly fruitful; and\nI will make nations of you, and kings\nshall come from you.\nThen she called the name of the\nLORD who spoke to her, You-Are-theGod-Who-Sees; for she said, \"Have I\nalso here seen Him who sees me?\"\nTherefore the well was called Beer\nLahai Roi; observe, it is between\nKadesh and Bered.\nSo Hagar bore Abram a son; and\nAbram named his son, whom Hagar\nbore, Ishmael.\nAnd I will establish My covenant\nbetween Me and you and your\ndescendants after you in their\ngenerations, for an everlasting covenant,\nto be God to you and your descendants\nafter you.\nAlso I give to you and your\ndescendants after you the land in which\nyou are a stranger, all the land of\nCanaan, as an everlasting possession;\nand I will be their God.\"\nAbram was eighty-six years old when\nHagar bore Ishmael to Abram.\n17When Abram was ninety-nine\nyears old, the LORD appeared to Abram\nand said to him, \"I am Almighty God;\nwalk before Me and be blameless.\nAnd I will make My covenant between\nMe and you, and will multiply you\nexceedingly.\"\nThen Abram fell on his face, and God\ntalked with him, saying:\nAnd God said to Abraham: \"As for you,\nyou shall keep My covenant, you and\nyour descendants after you throughout\ntheir generations.\nThis is My covenant which you shall\nkeep, between Me and you and your\ndescendants after you: Every male child\namong you shall be circumcised;\nand you shall be circumcised in the\nflesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a\nsign of the covenant between Me and\nyou.\n\"As for Me, behold, My covenant is with\nyou, and you shall be a father of many\nnations.\nHe who is eight days old among you\nshall be circumcised, every male child in\nyour generations, he who is born in your\nhouse or bought with money from any\nforeigner who is not your descendant.\nHe who is born in your house and he\nwho is bought with your money must be\ncircumcised, and My covenant shall be\nin your flesh for an everlasting covenant.\nBut My covenant I will establish with\nIsaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at\nthis set time next year.\"\nAnd the uncircumcised male child,\nwho is not circumcised in the flesh of his\nforeskin, that person shall be cut off\nfrom his people; he has broken My\ncovenant.\"\nThen God said to Abraham, \"As for\nSarai your wife, you shall not call her\nname Sarai, but Sarah shall be her\nname.\nThen He finished talking with him, and\nGod went up from Abraham.\nSo Abraham took Ishmael his son, all\nwho were born in his house and all who\nwere bought with his money, every male\namong the men of Abraham's house,\nand circumcised the flesh of their\nforeskins that very same day, as God\nhad said to him.\nAnd I will bless her and also give you a\nson by her; then I will bless her, and she\nshall be a mother of nations; kings of\npeoples shall be from her.\"\nThen Abraham fell on his face and\nlaughed, and said in his heart, \"Shall a\nchild be born to a man who is one\nhundred years old? And shall Sarah,\nwho is ninety years old, bear a child?\"\nAbraham was ninety-nine years old\nwhen he was circumcised in the flesh of\nhis foreskin.\nAnd Ishmael his son was thirteen\nyears old when he was circumcised in\nthe flesh of his foreskin.\nThat very same day Abraham was\ncircumcised, and his son Ishmael;\nAnd Abraham said to God, \"Oh, that\nIshmael might live before You!\"\nThen God said: \"No, Sarah your wife\nshall bear you a son, and you shall call\nhis name Isaac; I will establish My\ncovenant with him for an everlasting\ncovenant, and with his descendants\nafter him.\nAnd as for Ishmael, I have heard you.\nBehold, I have blessed him, and will\nmake him fruitful, and will multiply him\nexceedingly. He shall beget twelve\nprinces, and I will make him a great\nnation.\nand all the men of his house, born in\nthe house or bought with money from a\nforeigner, were circumcised with him.\n18Then the LORD appeared to him\nby the terebinth trees of Mamre, as he\nwas sitting in the tent door in the heat of\nthe day.\nSo he lifted his eyes and looked, and\nbehold, three men were standing by\nhim; and when he saw them, he ran\nfrom the tent door to meet them, and\nbowed himself to the ground,\nand said, \"My Lord, if I have now found\nfavor in Your sight, do not pass on by\nYour servant.\nTherefore Sarah laughed within herself,\nsaying, \"After I have grown old, shall I\nhave pleasure, my lord being old also?\"\nPlease let a little water be brought, and\nwash your feet, and rest yourselves\nunder the tree.\nAnd the LORD said to Abraham, \"Why\ndid Sarah laugh, saying, \"Shall I surely\nbear a child, since I am old?'\nAnd I will bring a morsel of bread, that\nyou may refresh your hearts. After that\nyou may pass by, inasmuch as you\nhave come to your servant.\" They said,\n\"Do as you have said.\"\nIs anything too hard for the LORD? At\nthe appointed time I will return to you,\naccording to the time of life, and Sarah\nshall have a son.\"\nSo Abraham hurried into the tent to\nSarah and said, \"Quickly, make ready\nthree measures of fine meal; knead it\nand make cakes.\"\nAnd Abraham ran to the herd, took a\ntender and good calf, gave it to a young\nman, and he hastened to prepare it.\nSo he took butter and milk and the calf\nwhich he had prepared, and set it before\nthem; and he stood by them under the\ntree as they ate.\nThen they said to him, \"Where is Sarah\nyour wife?\" So he said, \"Here, in the\ntent.\"\nAnd He said, \"I will certainly return to\nyou according to the time of life, and\nbehold, Sarah your wife shall have a\nson.\" (Sarah was listening in the tent\ndoor which was behind him.)\nNow Abraham and Sarah were old,\nwell advanced in age; and Sarah had\npassed the age of childbearing.\nBut Sarah denied it, saying, \"I did not\nlaugh,\" for she was afraid. And He said,\n\"No, but you did laugh!\"\nThen the men rose from there and\nlooked toward Sodom, and Abraham\nwent with them to send them on the way.\nAnd the LORD said, \"Shall I hide from\nAbraham what I am doing,\nsince Abraham shall surely become a\ngreat and mighty nation, and all the\nnations of the earth shall be blessed in\nhim?\nFor I have known him, in order that he\nmay command his children and his\nhousehold after him, that they keep the\nway of the LORD, to do righteousness\nand justice, that the LORD may bring to\nAbraham what He has spoken to him.\"\nAnd the LORD said, \"Because the\noutcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is\ngreat, and because their sin is very\ngrave,\nI will go down now and see whether\nthey have done altogether according to\nthe outcry against it that has come to\nMe; and if not, I will know.\"\nshould be found there?\" So He said, \"I\nwill not do it if I find thirty there.\"\nThen the men turned away from there\nand went toward Sodom, but Abraham\nstill stood before the LORD.\nAnd Abraham came near and said,\n\"Would You also destroy the righteous\nwith the wicked?\nSuppose there were fifty righteous\nwithin the city; would You also destroy\nthe place and not spare it for the fifty\nrighteous that were in it?\nFar be it from You to do such a thing\nas this, to slay the righteous with the\nwicked, so that the righteous should be\nas the wicked; far be it from You! Shall\nnot the Judge of all the earth do right?\"\nSo the LORD said, \"If I find in Sodom\nfifty righteous within the city, then I will\nspare all the place for their sakes.\"\nThen Abraham answered and said,\n\"Indeed now, I who am but dust and\nashes have taken it upon myself to\nspeak to the Lord:\nSuppose there were five less than the\nfifty righteous; would You destroy all of\nthe city for lack of five?\" So He said, \"If I\nfind there forty-five, I will not destroy it.\"\nAnd he spoke to Him yet again and\nsaid, \"Suppose there should be forty\nfound there?\" So He said, \"I will not do it\nfor the sake of forty.\"\nThen he said, \"Let not the Lord be\nangry, and I will speak: Suppose thirty\nAnd he said, \"Indeed now, I have\ntaken it upon myself to speak to the\nLord: Suppose twenty should be found\nthere?\" So He said, \"I will not destroy it\nfor the sake of twenty.\"\nThen he said, \"Let not the Lord be\nangry, and I will speak but once more:\nSuppose ten should be found there?\"\nAnd He said, \"I will not destroy it for the\nsake of ten.\"\nSo the LORD went His way as soon as\nHe had finished speaking with Abraham;\nand Abraham returned to his place.\n19Now the two angels came to\nSodom in the evening, and Lot was\nsitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot\nsaw them, he rose to meet them, and he\nbowed himself with his face toward the\nground.\nAnd he said, \"Here now, my lords,\nplease turn in to your servant's house\nand spend the night, and wash your\nfeet; then you may rise early and go on\nyour way.\" And they said, \"No, but we\nwill spend the night in the open square.\"\nBut he insisted strongly; so they turned\nin to him and entered his house. Then\nhe made them a feast, and baked\nunleavened bread, and they ate.\nNow before they lay down, the men of\nthe city, the men of Sodom, both old and\nyoung, all the people from every quarter,\nsurrounded the house.\nAnd they called to Lot and said to him,\n\"Where are the men who came to you\ntonight? Bring them out to us that we\nmay know them carnally.\"\nFor we will destroy this place, because\nthe outcry against them has grown great\nbefore the face of the LORD, and the\nLORD has sent us to destroy it.\"\nSo Lot went out to them through the\ndoorway, shut the door behind him,\nand said, \"Please, my brethren, do not\ndo so wickedly!\nSo Lot went out and spoke to his sonsin-law, who had married his daughters,\nand said, \"Get up, get out of this place;\nfor the LORD will destroy this city!\" But\nto his sons-in-law he seemed to be\njoking.\nSee now, I have two daughters who\nhave not known a man; please, let me\nbring them out to you, and you may do\nto them as you wish; only do nothing to\nthese men, since this is the reason they\nhave come under the shadow of my\nroof.\"\nAnd they said, \"Stand back!\" Then they\nsaid, \"This one came in to stay here,\nand he keeps acting as a judge; now we\nwill deal worse with you than with them.\"\nSo they pressed hard against the man\nLot, and came near to break down the\ndoor.\nBut the men reached out their hands\nand pulled Lot into the house with them,\nand shut the door.\nWhen the morning dawned, the angels\nurged Lot to hurry, saying, \"Arise, take\nyour wife and your two daughters who\nare here, lest you be consumed in the\npunishment of the city.\"\nAnd while he lingered, the men took\nhold of his hand, his wife's hand, and\nthe hands of his two daughters, the\nLORD being merciful to him, and they\nbrought him out and set him outside the\ncity.\nSo it came to pass, when they had\nbrought them outside, that he said,\n\"Escape for your life! Do not look behind\nyou nor stay anywhere in the plain.\nEscape to the mountains, lest you be\ndestroyed.\"\nAnd they struck the men who were at\nthe doorway of the house with blindness,\nboth small and great, so that they\nbecame weary trying to find the door.\nThen the men said to Lot, \"Have you\nanyone else here? Son-in-law, your\nsons, your daughters, and whomever\nyou have in the city--take them out of\nthis place!\nThen Lot said to them, \"Please, no, my\nlords!\nIndeed now, your servant has found\nfavor in your sight, and you have\nincreased your mercy which you have\nshown me by saving my life; but I\ncannot escape to the mountains, lest\nsome evil overtake me and I die.\nSee now, this city is near enough to\nflee to, and it is a little one; please let\nme escape there (is it not a little one?)\nand my soul shall live.\"\nAnd he said to him, \"See, I have\nfavored you concerning this thing also,\nin that I will not overthrow this city for\nwhich you have spoken.\nwhen He overthrew the cities in which\nLot had dwelt.\nThen Lot went up out of Zoar and\ndwelt in the mountains, and his two\ndaughters were with him; for he was\nafraid to dwell in Zoar. And he and his\ntwo daughters dwelt in a cave.\nHurry, escape there. For I cannot do\nanything until you arrive there.\"\nTherefore the name of the city was\ncalled Zoar.\nNow the firstborn said to the younger,\n\"Our father is old, and there is no man\non the earth to come in to us as is the\ncustom of all the earth.\nThe sun had risen upon the earth\nwhen Lot entered Zoar.\nCome, let us make our father drink\nwine, and we will lie with him, that we\nmay preserve the lineage of our father.\"\nThen the LORD rained brimstone and\nfire on Sodom and Gomorrah, from the\nLORD out of the heavens.\nSo they made their father drink wine\nthat night. And the firstborn went in and\nlay with her father, and he did not know\nwhen she lay down or when she arose.\nSo He overthrew those cities, all the\nplain, all the inhabitants of the cities,\nand what grew on the ground.\nBut his wife looked back behind him,\nand she became a pillar of salt.\nIt happened on the next day that the\nfirstborn said to the younger, \"Indeed I\nlay with my father last night; let us make\nhim drink wine tonight also, and you go\nin and lie with him, that we may\npreserve the lineage of our father.\"\nAnd Abraham went early in the\nmorning to the place where he had\nstood before the LORD.\nThen he looked toward Sodom and\nGomorrah, and toward all the land of the\nplain; and he saw, and behold, the\nsmoke of the land which went up like the\nsmoke of a furnace.\nAnd it came to pass, when God\ndestroyed the cities of the plain, that\nGod remembered Abraham, and sent\nLot out of the midst of the overthrow,\nThen they made their father drink wine\nthat night also. And the younger arose\nand lay with him, and he did not know\nwhen she lay down or when she arose.\nThus both the daughters of Lot were\nwith child by their father.\nThe firstborn bore a son and called his\nname Moab; he is the father of the\nMoabites to this day.\nAnd the younger, she also bore a son\nand called his name Ben-Ammi; he is\nthe father of the people of Ammon to\nthis day.\nSo Abimelech rose early in the morning,\ncalled all his servants, and told all these\nthings in their hearing; and the men\nwere very much afraid.\n20And Abraham journeyed from\nthere to the South, and dwelt between\nKadesh and Shur, and stayed in Gerar.\nNow Abraham said of Sarah his wife,\n\"She is my sister.\" And Abimelech king\nof Gerar sent and took Sarah.\nBut God came to Abimelech in a dream\nby night, and said to him, \"Indeed you\nare a dead man because of the woman\nwhom you have taken, for she is a\nman's wife.\"\nBut Abimelech had not come near her;\nand he said, \"Lord, will You slay a\nrighteous nation also?\nDid he not say to me, \"She is my\nsister'? And she, even she herself said,\n\"He is my brother.' In the integrity of my\nheart and innocence of my hands I have\ndone this.\"\nAnd God said to him in a dream, \"Yes, I\nknow that you did this in the integrity of\nyour heart. For I also withheld you from\nsinning against Me; therefore I did not\nlet you touch her.\nNow therefore, restore the man's wife;\nfor he is a prophet, and he will pray for\nyou and you shall live. But if you do not\nrestore her, know that you shall surely\ndie, you and all who are yours.\"\nAnd Abimelech called Abraham and\nsaid to him, \"What have you done to us?\nHow have I offended you, that you have\nbrought on me and on my kingdom a\ngreat sin? You have done deeds to me\nthat ought not to be done.\"\nThen Abimelech said to Abraham,\n\"What did you have in view, that you\nhave done this thing?\"\nAnd Abraham said, \"Because I thought,\nsurely the fear of God is not in this\nplace; and they will kill me on account of\nmy wife.\nBut indeed she is truly my sister. She\nis the daughter of my father, but not the\ndaughter of my mother; and she\nbecame my wife.\nAnd it came to pass, when God\ncaused me to wander from my father's\nhouse, that I said to her, \"This is your\nkindness that you should do for me: in\nevery place, wherever we go, say of me,\n\"He is my brother.\"\"'\nThen Abimelech took sheep, oxen,\nand male and female servants, and\ngave them to Abraham; and he restored\nSarah his wife to him.\nAnd Abimelech said, \"See, my land is\nbefore you; dwell where it pleases you.\"\nThen to Sarah he said, \"Behold, I have\ngiven your brother a thousand pieces of\nsilver; indeed this vindicates you before\nall who are with you and before\neverybody.\" Thus she was rebuked.\nSo the child grew and was weaned.\nAnd Abraham made a great feast on the\nsame day that Isaac was weaned.\nSo Abraham prayed to God; and God\nhealed Abimelech, his wife, and his\nfemale servants. Then they bore\nchildren;\nAnd Sarah saw the son of Hagar the\nEgyptian, whom she had borne to\nAbraham, scoffing.\nfor the LORD had closed up all the\nwombs of the house of Abimelech\nbecause of Sarah, Abraham's wife.\nTherefore she said to Abraham, \"Cast\nout this bondwoman and her son; for the\nson of this bondwoman shall not be heir\nwith my son, namely with Isaac.\"\n21And the LORD visited Sarah as\nAnd the matter was very displeasing in\nAbraham's sight because of his son.\nHe had said, and the LORD did for\nSarah as He had spoken.\nFor Sarah conceived and bore\nAbraham a son in his old age, at the set\ntime of which God had spoken to him.\nAnd Abraham called the name of his\nson who was born to him--whom Sarah\nbore to him--Isaac.\nThen Abraham circumcised his son\nIsaac when he was eight days old, as\nGod had commanded him.\nNow Abraham was one hundred years\nold when his son Isaac was born to him.\nAnd Sarah said, \"God has made me\nlaugh, and all who hear will laugh with\nme.\"\nShe also said, \"Who would have said to\nAbraham that Sarah would nurse\nchildren? For I have borne him a son in\nhis old age.\"\nBut God said to Abraham, \"Do not let it\nbe displeasing in your sight because of\nthe lad or because of your bondwoman.\nWhatever Sarah has said to you, listen\nto her voice; for in Isaac your seed shall\nbe called.\nYet I will also make a nation of the son\nof the bondwoman, because he is your\nseed.\"\nSo Abraham rose early in the morning,\nand took bread and a skin of water; and\nputting it on her shoulder, he gave it and\nthe boy to Hagar, and sent her away.\nThen she departed and wandered in the\nWilderness of Beersheba.\nAnd the water in the skin was used up,\nand she placed the boy under one of the\nshrubs.\nThen she went and sat down across\nfrom him at a distance of about a\nbowshot; for she said to herself, \"Let me\nnot see the death of the boy.\" So she\nsat opposite him, and lifted her voice\nand wept.\nAnd Abimelech said, \"I do not know\nwho has done this thing; you did not tell\nme, nor had I heard of it until today.\"\nAnd God heard the voice of the lad.\nThen the angel of God called to Hagar\nout of heaven, and said to her, \"What\nails you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has\nheard the voice of the lad where he is.\nSo Abraham took sheep and oxen and\ngave them to Abimelech, and the two of\nthem made a covenant.\nArise, lift up the lad and hold him with\nyour hand, for I will make him a great\nnation.\"\nThen God opened her eyes, and she\nsaw a well of water. And she went and\nfilled the skin with water, and gave the\nlad a drink.\nSo God was with the lad; and he grew\nand dwelt in the wilderness, and\nbecame an archer.\nAnd Abraham set seven ewe lambs of\nthe flock by themselves.\nThen Abimelech asked Abraham,\n\"What is the meaning of these seven\newe lambs which you have set by\nthemselves?\"\nAnd he said, \"You will take these\nseven ewe lambs from my hand, that\nthey may be my witness that I have dug\nthis well.\"\nHe dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran;\nand his mother took a wife for him from\nthe land of Egypt.\nTherefore he called that place\nBeersheba, because the two of them\nswore an oath there.\nAnd it came to pass at that time that\nAbimelech and Phichol, the commander\nof his army, spoke to Abraham, saying,\n\"God is with you in all that you do.\nThus they made a covenant at\nBeersheba. So Abimelech rose with\nPhichol, the commander of his army,\nand they returned to the land of the\nPhilistines.\nNow therefore, swear to me by God\nthat you will not deal falsely with me,\nwith my offspring, or with my posterity;\nbut that according to the kindness that I\nhave done to you, you will do to me and\nto the land in which you have dwelt.\"\nAnd Abraham said, \"I will swear.\"\nThen Abraham rebuked Abimelech\nbecause of a well of water which\nAbimelech's servants had seized.\nThen Abraham planted a tamarisk tree\nin Beersheba, and there called on the\nname of the LORD, the Everlasting God.\nAnd Abraham stayed in the land of the\nPhilistines many days.\n22Now it came to pass after these\nthings that God tested Abraham, and\nsaid to him, \"Abraham!\" And he said,\n\"Here I am.\"\nThen He said, \"Take now your son,\nyour only son Isaac, whom you love,\nand go to the land of Moriah, and offer\nhim there as a burnt offering on one of\nthe mountains of which I shall tell you.\"\nAnd Abraham stretched out his hand\nand took the knife to slay his son.\nBut the Angel of the LORD called to\nhim from heaven and said, \"Abraham,\nAbraham!\" So he said, \"Here I am.\"\nSo Abraham rose early in the morning\nand saddled his donkey, and took two of\nhis young men with him, and Isaac his\nson; and he split the wood for the burnt\noffering, and arose and went to the\nplace of which God had told him.\nAnd He said, \"Do not lay your hand on\nthe lad, or do anything to him; for now I\nknow that you fear God, since you have\nnot withheld your son, your only son,\nfrom Me.\"\nThen on the third day Abraham lifted\nhis eyes and saw the place afar off.\nAnd Abraham said to his young men,\n\"Stay here with the donkey; the lad and I\nwill go yonder and worship, and we will\ncome back to you.\"\nThen Abraham lifted his eyes and\nlooked, and there behind him was a ram\ncaught in a thicket by its horns. So\nAbraham went and took the ram, and\noffered it up for a burnt offering instead\nof his son.\nSo Abraham took the wood of the burnt\noffering and laid it on Isaac his son; and\nhe took the fire in his hand, and a knife,\nand the two of them went together.\nAnd Abraham called the name of the\nplace, The-LORD-Will-Provide; as it is\nsaid to this day, \"In the Mount of the\nLORD it shall be provided.\"\nBut Isaac spoke to Abraham his father\nand said, \"My father!\" And he said,\n\"Here I am, my son.\" Then he said,\n\"Look, the fire and the wood, but where\nis the lamb for a burnt offering?\"\nAnd Abraham said, \"My son, God will\nprovide for Himself the lamb for a burnt\noffering.\" So the two of them went\ntogether.\nThen they came to the place of which\nGod had told him. And Abraham built an\naltar there and placed the wood in order;\nand he bound Isaac his son and laid him\non the altar, upon the wood.\nThen the Angel of the LORD called to\nAbraham a second time out of heaven,\nand said: \"By Myself I have sworn,\nsays the LORD, because you have done\nthis thing, and have not withheld your\nson, your only son-17\nblessing I will bless you, and\nmultiplying\nI\nwill\nmultiply\nyour\ndescendants as the stars of the heaven\nand as the sand which is on the\nseashore; and your descendants shall\npossess the gate of their enemies.\nIn your seed all the nations of the\nearth shall be blessed, because you\nhave obeyed My voice.\"\nSo Abraham returned to his young\nmen, and they rose and went together to\nBeersheba; and Abraham dwelt at\nBeersheba.\nNow it came to pass after these things\nthat it was told Abraham, saying,\n\"Indeed Milcah also has borne children\nto your brother Nahor:\nAnd the sons of Heth\nAbraham, saying to him,\nanswered\n\"Hear us, my lord: You are a mighty\nprince among us; bury your dead in the\nchoicest of our burial places. None of us\nwill withhold from you his burial place,\nthat you may bury your dead.\"\nHuz his firstborn, Buz his brother,\nKemuel the father of Aram,\nThen Abraham stood up and bowed\nhimself to the people of the land, the\nsons of Heth.\nChesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and\nBethuel.\"\nAnd Bethuel begot Rebekah. These\neight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's\nbrother.\nHis concubine, whose name was\nReumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham,\nThahash, and Maachah.\n23Sarah lived one hundred and\ntwenty-seven years; these were the\nyears of the life of Sarah.\nSo Sarah died in Kirjath Arba (that is,\nHebron) in the land of Canaan, and\nAbraham came to mourn for Sarah and\nto weep for her.\nThen Abraham stood up from before\nhis dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth,\nsaying,\n\"I am a foreigner and a visitor among\nyou. Give me property for a burial place\namong you, that I may bury my dead out\nof my sight.\"\nAnd he spoke with them, saying, \"If it is\nyour wish that I bury my dead out of my\nsight, hear me, and meet with Ephron\nthe son of Zohar for me,\nthat he may give me the cave of\nMachpelah which he has, which is at the\nend of his field. Let him give it to me at\nthe full price, as property for a burial\nplace among you.\"\nNow Ephron dwelt among the sons of\nHeth; and Ephron the Hittite answered\nAbraham in the presence of the sons of\nHeth, all who entered at the gate of his\ncity, saying,\n\"No, my lord, hear me: I give you the\nfield and the cave that is in it; I give it to\nyou in the presence of the sons of my\npeople. I give it to you. Bury your dead!\"\nThen Abraham bowed himself down\nbefore the people of the land;\nand he spoke to Ephron in the hearing\nof the people of the land, saying, \"If you\nwill give it, please hear me. I will give\nyou money for the field; take it from me\nand I will bury my dead there.\"\nAnd Ephron\nsaying to him,\nanswered\nAbraham,\n\"My lord, listen to me; the land is worth\nfour hundred shekels of silver. What is\nthat between you and me? So bury your\ndead.\"\nhad, \"Please, put your hand under my\nthigh,\nand I will make you swear by the LORD,\nthe God of heaven and the God of the\nearth, that you will not take a wife for my\nson from the daughters of the\nCanaanites, among whom I dwell;\nAnd Abraham listened to Ephron; and\nAbraham weighed out the silver for\nEphron which he had named in the\nhearing of the sons of Heth, four\nhundred shekels of silver, currency of\nthe merchants.\nSo the field of Ephron which was in\nMachpelah, which was before Mamre,\nthe field and the cave which was in it,\nand all the trees that were in the field,\nwhich were within all the surrounding\nborders, were deeded\nbut you shall go to my country and to\nmy family, and take a wife for my son\nIsaac.\"\nAnd the servant said to him, \"Perhaps\nthe woman will not be willing to follow\nme to this land. Must I take your son\nback to the land from which you came?\"\nBut Abraham said to him, \"Beware that\nyou do not take my son back there.\nto Abraham as a possession in the\npresence of the sons of Heth, before all\nwho went in at the gate of his city.\nAnd after this, Abraham buried Sarah\nhis wife in the cave of the field of\nMachpelah, before Mamre (that is,\nHebron) in the land of Canaan.\nSo the field and the cave that is in it\nwere deeded to Abraham by the sons of\nHeth as property for a burial place.\nThe LORD God of heaven, who took\nme from my father's house and from the\nland of my family, and who spoke to me\nand swore to me, saying, \"To your\ndescendants I give this land,' He will\nsend His angel before you, and you\nshall take a wife for my son from there.\nAnd if the woman is not willing to follow\nyou, then you will be released from this\noath; only do not take my son back\nthere.\"\n24Now Abraham was old, well\nadvanced in age; and the LORD had\nblessed Abraham in all things.\nSo Abraham said to the oldest servant\nof his house, who ruled over all that he\nSo the servant put his hand under the\nthigh of Abraham his master, and swore\nto him concerning this matter.\nThen the servant took ten of his\nmaster's camels and departed, for all his\nmaster's goods were in his hand. And\nhe arose and went to Mesopotamia, to\nthe city of Nahor.\nAnd he made his camels kneel down\noutside the city by a well of water at\nevening time, the time when women go\nout to draw water.\nAnd when she had finished giving him\na drink, she said, \"I will draw water for\nyour camels also, until they have\nfinished drinking.\"\nThen he said, \"O LORD God of my\nmaster Abraham, please give me\nsuccess this day, and show kindness to\nmy master Abraham.\nThen she quickly emptied her pitcher\ninto the trough, ran back to the well to\ndraw water, and drew for all his camels.\nBehold, here I stand by the well of\nwater, and the daughters of the men of\nthe city are coming out to draw water.\nAnd the man, wondering at her,\nremained silent so as to know whether\nthe LORD had made his journey\nprosperous or not.\nNow let it be that the young woman to\nwhom I say, \"Please let down your\npitcher that I may drink,' and she says,\n\"Drink, and I will also give your camels a\ndrink'--let her be the one You have\nappointed for Your servant Isaac. And\nby this I will know that You have shown\nkindness to my master.\"\nAnd it happened, before he had\nfinished speaking, that behold, Rebekah,\nwho was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah,\nthe wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother,\ncame out with her pitcher on her\nshoulder.\nNow the young woman was very\nbeautiful to behold, a virgin; no man had\nknown her. And she went down to the\nwell, filled her pitcher, and came up.\nAnd the servant ran to meet her and\nsaid, \"Please let me drink a little water\nfrom your pitcher.\"\nSo she said, \"Drink, my lord.\" Then\nshe quickly let her pitcher down to her\nhand, and gave him a drink.\nSo it was, when the camels had\nfinished drinking, that the man took a\ngolden nose ring weighing half a shekel,\nand two bracelets for her wrists\nweighing ten shekels of gold,\nand said, \"Whose daughter are you?\nTell me, please, is there room in your\nfather's house for us to lodge?\"\nSo she said to him, \"I am the daughter\nof Bethuel, Milcah's son, whom she bore\nto Nahor.\"\nMoreover she said to him, \"We have\nboth straw and feed enough, and room\nto lodge.\"\nThen the man bowed down his head\nand worshiped the LORD.\nAnd he said, \"Blessed be the LORD\nGod of my master Abraham, who has\nnot forsaken His mercy and His truth\ntoward my master. As for me, being on\nthe way, the LORD led me to the house\nof my master's brethren.\"\nSo the young woman ran and told her\nmother's household these things.\nNow Rebekah had a brother whose\nname was Laban, and Laban ran out to\nthe man by the well.\nSo it came to pass, when he saw the\nnose ring, and the bracelets on his\nsister's wrists, and when he heard the\nwords of his sister Rebekah, saying,\n\"Thus the man spoke to me,\" that he\nwent to the man. And there he stood by\nthe camels at the well.\nAnd he said, \"Come in, O blessed of\nthe LORD! Why do you stand outside?\nFor I have prepared the house, and a\nplace for the camels.\"\nThen the man came to the house. And\nhe unloaded the camels, and provided\nstraw and feed for the camels, and\nwater to wash his feet and the feet of\nthe men who were with him.\nFood was set before him to eat, but he\nsaid, \"I will not eat until I have told about\nmy errand.\" And he said, \"Speak on.\"\nSo he said, \"I am Abraham's servant.\nThe LORD has blessed my master\ngreatly, and he has become great; and\nHe has given him flocks and herds,\nsilver and gold, male and female\nservants, and camels and donkeys.\nNow my master made me swear,\nsaying, \"You shall not take a wife for my\nson from the daughters of the\nCanaanites, in whose land I dwell;\nbut you shall go to my father's house\nand to my family, and take a wife for my\nson.'\nAnd I said to my master, \"Perhaps the\nwoman will not follow me.'\nBut he said to me, \"The LORD, before\nwhom I walk, will send His angel with\nyou and prosper your way; and you shall\ntake a wife for my son from my family\nand from my father's house.\nYou will be clear from this oath when\nyou arrive among my family; for if they\nwill not give her to you, then you will be\nreleased from my oath.'\n\"And this day I came to the well and\nsaid, \"O LORD God of my master\nAbraham, if You will now prosper the\nway in which I go,\nbehold, I stand by the well of water;\nand it shall come to pass that when the\nvirgin comes out to draw water, and I\nsay to her, \"Please give me a little water\nfrom your pitcher to drink,\"\nand she says to me, \"Drink, and I will\ndraw for your camels also,\"--let her be\nthe woman whom the LORD has\nappointed for my master's son.'\nAnd Sarah my master's wife bore a\nson to my master when she was old;\nand to him he has given all that he has.\n\"But before I had finished speaking in\nmy heart, there was Rebekah, coming\nout with her pitcher on her shoulder; and\nshe went down to the well and drew\nwater. And I said to her, \"Please let me\ndrink.'\nand gave them to Rebekah. He also\ngave precious things to her brother and\nto her mother.\nAnd she made haste and let her\npitcher down from her shoulder, and\nsaid, \"Drink, and I will give your camels\na drink also.' So I drank, and she gave\nthe camels a drink also.\nAnd he and the men who were with\nhim ate and drank and stayed all night.\nThen they arose in the morning, and he\nsaid, \"Send me away to my master.\"\nThen I asked her, and said, \"Whose\ndaughter are you?' And she said, \"The\ndaughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom\nMilcah bore to him.' So I put the nose\nring on her nose and the bracelets on\nher wrists.\nAnd I bowed my head and worshiped\nthe LORD, and blessed the LORD God\nof my master Abraham, who had led me\nin the way of truth to take the daughter\nof my master's brother for his son.\nNow if you will deal kindly and truly\nwith my master, tell me. And if not, tell\nme, that I may turn to the right hand or\nto the left.\"\nBut her brother and her mother said,\n\"Let the young woman stay with us a\nfew days, at least ten; after that she may\ngo.\"\nAnd he said to them, \"Do not hinder\nme, since the LORD has prospered my\nway; send me away so that I may go to\nmy master.\"\nSo they said, \"We will call the young\nwoman and ask her personally.\"\nThen they called Rebekah and said to\nher, \"Will you go with this man?\" And\nshe said, \"I will go.\"\nThen Laban and Bethuel answered\nand said, \"The thing comes from the\nLORD; we cannot speak to you either\nbad or good.\nSo they sent away Rebekah their\nsister and her nurse, and Abraham's\nservant and his men.\nHere is Rebekah before you; take her\nand go, and let her be your master's\nson's wife, as the LORD has spoken.\"\nAnd they blessed Rebekah and said to\nher: \"Our sister, may you become The\nmother of thousands of ten thousands;\nAnd may your descendants possess\nThe gates of those who hate them.\"\nAnd it came to pass, when Abraham's\nservant heard their words, that he\nworshiped the LORD, bowing himself to\nthe earth.\nThen Rebekah and her maids arose,\nand they rode on the camels and\nfollowed the man. So the servant took\nRebekah and departed.\nThen the servant brought out jewelry\nof silver, jewelry of gold, and clothing,\nNow Isaac came from the way of Beer\nLahai Roi, for he dwelt in the South.\nAnd Isaac went out to meditate in the\nfield in the evening; and he lifted his\neyes and looked, and there, the camels\nwere coming.\nBut Abraham gave gifts to the sons of\nthe concubines which Abraham had;\nand while he was still living he sent\nthem eastward, away from Isaac his son,\nto the country of the east.\nThen Rebekah lifted her eyes, and\nwhen she saw Isaac she dismounted\nfrom her camel;\nThis is the sum of the years of\nAbraham's life which he lived: one\nhundred and seventy-five years.\nfor she had said to the servant, \"Who\nis this man walking in the field to meet\nus?\" The servant said, \"It is my master.\"\nSo she took a veil and covered herself.\nThen Abraham breathed his last and\ndied in a good old age, an old man and\nfull of years, and was gathered to his\npeople.\nAnd the servant told Isaac all the\nthings that he had done.\nThen Isaac brought her into his mother\nSarah's tent; and he took Rebekah and\nshe became his wife, and he loved her.\nSo Isaac was comforted after his\nmother's death.\n25Abraham again took a wife, and\nher name was Keturah.\nAnd she bore him Zimran, Jokshan,\nMedan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.\nJokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. And\nthe sons of Dedan were Asshurim,\nLetushim, and Leummim.\nAnd the sons of Midian were Ephah,\nEpher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah. All\nthese were the children of Keturah.\nAnd Abraham gave all that he had to\nIsaac.\nAnd his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried\nhim in the cave of Machpelah, which is\nbefore Mamre, in the field of Ephron the\nson of Zohar the Hittite,\nthe field which Abraham purchased\nfrom the sons of Heth. There Abraham\nwas buried, and Sarah his wife.\nAnd it came to pass, after the death of\nAbraham, that God blessed his son\nIsaac. And Isaac dwelt at Beer Lahai\nRoi.\nNow this is the genealogy of Ishmael,\nAbraham's son, whom Hagar the\nEgyptian, Sarah's maidservant, bore to\nAbraham.\nAnd these were the names of the sons\nof Ishmael, by their names, according to\ntheir generations: The firstborn of\nIshmael, Nebajoth; then Kedar, Adbeel,\nMibsam,\nMishma, Dumah, Massa,\nHadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and\nKedemah.\nSo when her days were fulfilled for her\nto give birth, indeed there were twins in\nher womb.\nThese were the sons of Ishmael and\nthese were their names, by their towns\nand their settlements, twelve princes\naccording to their nations.\nAnd the first came out red. He was like\na hairy garment all over; so they called\nhis name Esau.\nThese were the years of the life of\nIshmael: one hundred and thirty-seven\nyears; and he breathed his last and died,\nand was gathered to his people.\nAfterward his brother came out, and\nhis hand took hold of Esau's heel; so his\nname was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty\nyears old when she bore them.\n(They dwelt from Havilah as far as\nShur, which is east of Egypt as you go\ntoward Assyria.) He died in the\npresence of all his brethren.\nSo the boys grew. And Esau was a\nskillful hunter, a man of the field; but\nJacob was a mild man, dwelling in tents.\nThis is the genealogy of Isaac,\nAbraham's son. Abraham begot Isaac.\nAnd Isaac loved Esau because he ate\nof his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.\nIsaac was forty years old when he took\nRebekah as wife, the daughter of\nBethuel the Syrian of Padan Aram, the\nsister of Laban the Syrian.\nNow Isaac pleaded with the LORD for\nhis wife, because she was barren; and\nthe LORD granted his plea, and\nRebekah his wife conceived.\nNow Jacob cooked a stew; and Esau\ncame in from the field, and he was\nweary.\nAnd Esau said to Jacob, \"Please feed\nme with that same red stew, for I am\nweary.\" Therefore his name was called\nEdom.\nBut Jacob said, \"Sell me your birthright\nas of this day.\"\nBut the children struggled together\nwithin her; and she said, \"If all is well,\nwhy am I like this?\nAnd Esau said, \"Look, I am about to\ndie; so what is this birthright to me?\"\nAnd the LORD said to her: \"Two\nnations are in your womb, Two peoples\nshall be separated from your body; One\npeople shall be stronger than the other,\nAnd the older shall serve the younger.\"\nThen Jacob said, \"Swear to me as of\nthis day.\" So he swore to him, and sold\nhis birthright to Jacob.\nAnd Jacob gave Esau bread and stew\nof lentils; then he ate and drank, arose,\nand went his way. Thus Esau despised\nhis birthright.\n26There was a famine in the land,\nbesides the first famine that was in the\ndays of Abraham. And Isaac went to\nAbimelech king of the Philistines, in\nGerar.\nThen the LORD appeared to him and\nsaid: \"Do not go down to Egypt; live in\nthe land of which I shall tell you.\nDwell in this land, and I will be with you\nand bless you; for to you and your\ndescendants I give all these lands, and I\nwill perform the oath which I swore to\nAbraham your father.\nAnd I will make your descendants\nmultiply as the stars of heaven; I will\ngive to your descendants all these\nlands; and in your seed all the nations of\nthe earth shall be blessed;\nThen Abimelech called Isaac and said,\n\"Quite obviously she is your wife; so\nhow could you say, \"She is my sister'?\"\nIsaac said to him, \"Because I said, \"Lest\nI die on account of her.'\nAnd Abimelech said, \"What is this you\nhave done to us? One of the people\nmight soon have lain with your wife, and\nyou would have brought guilt on us.\"\nSo Abimelech charged all his people,\nsaying, \"He who touches this man or his\nwife shall surely be put to death.\"\nThen Isaac sowed in that land, and\nreaped in the same year a hundredfold;\nand the LORD blessed him.\nThe man began to prosper, and\ncontinued prospering until he became\nvery prosperous;\nbecause Abraham obeyed My voice\nand\nkept\nMy\ncharge,\nMy\ncommandments, My statutes, and My\nlaws.\"\nfor he had possessions of flocks and\npossessions of herds and a great\nnumber of servants. So the Philistines\nenvied him.\nSo Isaac dwelt in Gerar.\nAnd the men of the place asked about\nhis wife. And he said, \"She is my sister\";\nfor he was afraid to say, \"She is my\nwife,\" because he thought, \"lest the men\nof the place kill me for Rebekah,\nbecause she is beautiful to behold.\"\nNow it came to pass, when he had\nbeen there a long time, that Abimelech\nking of the Philistines looked through a\nwindow, and saw, and there was Isaac,\nshowing endearment to Rebekah his\nwife.\nNow the Philistines had stopped up all\nthe wells which his father's servants had\ndug in the days of Abraham his father,\nand they had filled them with earth.\nAnd Abimelech said to Isaac, \"Go\naway from us, for you are much mightier\nthan we.\"\nThen Isaac departed from there and\npitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar,\nand dwelt there.\nAnd Isaac dug again the wells of water\nwhich they had dug in the days of\nAbraham his father, for the Philistines\nhad stopped them up after the death of\nAbraham. He called them by the names\nwhich his father had called them.\nAnd Isaac said to them, \"Why have\nyou come to me, since you hate me and\nhave sent me away from you?\"\nAlso Isaac's servants dug in the valley,\nand found a well of running water there.\nBut the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled\nwith Isaac's herdsmen, saying, \"The\nwater is ours.\" So he called the name of\nthe well Esek, because they quarreled\nwith him.\nThen they dug another well, and they\nquarreled over that one also. So he\ncalled its name Sitnah.\nBut they said, \"We have certainly seen\nthat the LORD is with you. So we said,\n\"Let there now be an oath between us,\nbetween you and us; and let us make a\ncovenant with you,\nthat you will do us no harm, since we\nhave not touched you, and since we\nhave done nothing to you but good and\nhave sent you away in peace. You are\nnow the blessed of the LORD.\"'\nSo he made them a feast, and they ate\nand drank.\nAnd he moved from there and dug\nanother well, and they did not quarrel\nover it. So he called its name Rehoboth,\nbecause he said, \"For now the LORD\nhas made room for us, and we shall be\nfruitful in the land.\"\nThen they arose early in the morning\nand swore an oath with one another;\nand Isaac sent them away, and they\ndeparted from him in peace.\nThen he went up from there to\nBeersheba.\nIt came to pass the same day that\nIsaac's servants came and told him\nabout the well which they had dug, and\nsaid to him, \"We have found water.\"\nAnd the LORD appeared to him the\nsame night and said, \"I am the God of\nyour father Abraham; do not fear, for I\nam with you. I will bless you and multiply\nyour descendants for My servant\nAbraham's sake.\"\nSo he built an altar there and called on\nthe name of the LORD, and he pitched\nhis tent there; and there Isaac's servants\ndug a well.\nThen Abimelech came to him from\nGerar with Ahuzzath, one of his friends,\nand Phichol the commander of his army.\nSo he called it Shebah. Therefore the\nname of the city is Beersheba to this\nday.\nWhen Esau was forty years old, he\ntook as wives Judith the daughter of\nBeeri the Hittite, and Basemath the\ndaughter of Elon the Hittite.\nAnd they were a grief of mind to Isaac\nand Rebekah.\n27Now it came to pass, when Isaac\nwas old and his eyes were so dim that\nhe could not see, that he called Esau his\nolder son and said to him, \"My son.\" And\nhe answered him, \"Here I am.\"\nThen he said, \"Behold now, I am old. I\ndo not know the day of my death.\nNow therefore, please take your\nweapons, your quiver and your bow,\nand go out to the field and hunt game\nfor me.\nAnd make me savory food, such as I\nlove, and bring it to me that I may eat,\nthat my soul may bless you before I die.\"\nNow Rebekah was listening when Isaac\nspoke to Esau his son. And Esau went\nto the field to hunt game and to bring it.\nSo Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son,\nsaying, \"Indeed I heard your father\nspeak to Esau your brother, saying,\n\"Bring me game and make savory food\nfor me, that I may eat it and bless you in\nthe presence of the LORD before my\ndeath.'\nNow therefore, my son, obey my voice\naccording to what I command you.\nGo now to the flock and bring me from\nthere two choice kids of the goats, and I\nwill make savory food from them for\nyour father, such as he loves.\nThen you shall take it to your father,\nthat he may eat it, and that he may\nbless you before his death.\"\nAnd Jacob said to Rebekah his mother,\n\"Look, Esau my brother is a hairy man,\nand I am a smooth-skinned man.\nPerhaps my father will feel me, and I\nshall seem to be a deceiver to him; and I\nshall bring a curse on myself and not a\nblessing.\"\nBut his mother said to him, \"Let your\ncurse be on me, my son; only obey my\nvoice, and go, get them for me.\"\nAnd he went and got them and\nbrought them to his mother, and his\nmother made savory food, such as his\nfather loved.\nThen Rebekah took the choice clothes\nof her elder son Esau, which were with\nher in the house, and put them on Jacob\nher younger son.\nAnd she put the skins of the kids of the\ngoats on his hands and on the smooth\npart of his neck.\nThen she gave the savory food and\nthe bread, which she had prepared, into\nthe hand of her son Jacob.\nSo he went to his father and said, \"My\nfather.\" And he said, \"Here I am. Who\nare you, my son?\"\nJacob said to his father, \"I am Esau\nyour firstborn; I have done just as you\ntold me; please arise, sit and eat of my\ngame, that your soul may bless me.\"\nBut Isaac said to his son, \"How is it\nthat you have found it so quickly, my\nson?\" And he said, \"Because the LORD\nyour God brought it to me.\"\nbow down to you. Cursed be everyone\nwho curses you, And blessed be those\nwho bless you!\"\nIsaac said to Jacob, \"Please come\nnear, that I may feel you, my son,\nwhether you are really my son Esau or\nnot.\"\nSo Jacob went near to Isaac his father,\nand he felt him and said, \"The voice is\nJacob's voice, but the hands are the\nhands of Esau.\"\nAnd he did not recognize him,\nbecause his hands were hairy like his\nbrother Esau's hands; so he blessed\nhim.\nThen he said, \"Are you really my son\nEsau?\" He said, \"I am.\"\nNow it happened, as soon as Isaac\nhad finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob\nhad scarcely gone out from the\npresence of Isaac his father, that Esau\nhis brother came in from his hunting.\nHe also had made savory food, and\nbrought it to his father, and said to his\nfather, \"Let my father arise and eat of\nhis son's game, that your soul may bless\nme.\"\nAnd his father Isaac said to him, \"Who\nare you?\" So he said, \"I am your son,\nyour firstborn, Esau.\"\nHe said, \"Bring it near to me, and I will\neat of my son's game, so that my soul\nmay bless you.\" So he brought it near to\nhim, and he ate; and he brought him\nwine, and he drank.\nThen Isaac trembled exceedingly, and\nsaid, \"Who? Where is the one who\nhunted game and brought it to me? I ate\nall of it before you came, and I have\nblessed him--and indeed he shall be\nblessed.\"\nThen his father Isaac said to him,\n\"Come near now and kiss me, my son.\"\nAnd he came near and kissed him;\nand he smelled the smell of his clothing,\nand blessed him and said: \"Surely, the\nsmell of my son Is like the smell of a\nfield Which the LORD has blessed.\nWhen Esau heard the words of his\nfather, he cried with an exceedingly\ngreat and bitter cry, and said to his\nfather, \"Bless me--me also, O my\nfather!\"\nBut he said, \"Your brother came with\ndeceit and has taken away your\nblessing.\"\nTherefore may God give you Of the\ndew of heaven, Of the fatness of the\nearth, And plenty of grain and wine.\nLet peoples serve you, And nations\nbow down to you. Be master over your\nbrethren, And let your mother's sons\nAnd Esau said, \"Is he not rightly\nnamed Jacob? For he has supplanted\nme these two times. He took away my\nbirthright, and now look, he has taken\naway my blessing!\" And he said, \"Have\nyou not reserved a blessing for me?\"\nThen Isaac answered and said to\nEsau, \"Indeed I have made him your\nmaster, and all his brethren I have given\nto him as servants; with grain and wine I\nhave sustained him. What shall I do now\nfor you, my son?\"\nuntil your brother's anger turns away\nfrom you, and he forgets what you have\ndone to him; then I will send and bring\nyou from there. Why should I be\nbereaved also of you both in one day?\"\nAnd Esau said to his father, \"Have you\nonly one blessing, my father? Bless me-me also, O my father!\" And Esau lifted\nup his voice and wept.\nAnd Rebekah said to Isaac, \"I am\nweary of my life because of the\ndaughters of Heth; if Jacob takes a wife\nof the daughters of Heth, like these who\nare the daughters of the land, what good\nwill my life be to me?\"\nThen Isaac his father answered and\nsaid to him: \"Behold, your dwelling shall\nbe of the fatness of the earth, And of the\ndew of heaven from above.\nBy your sword you shall live, And you\nshall serve your brother; And it shall\ncome to pass, when you become\nrestless, That you shall break his yoke\nfrom your neck.\"\nSo Esau hated Jacob because of the\nblessing with which his father blessed\nhim, and Esau said in his heart, \"The\ndays of mourning for my father are at\nhand; then I will kill my brother Jacob.\"\nAnd the words of Esau her older son\nwere told to Rebekah. So she sent and\ncalled Jacob her younger son, and said\nto him, \"Surely your brother Esau\ncomforts himself concerning you by\nintending to kill you.\nNow therefore, my son, obey my\nvoice: arise, flee to my brother Laban in\nHaran.\nAnd stay with him a few days, until\nyour brother's fury turns away,\n28Then Isaac called Jacob and\nblessed him, and charged him, and said\nto him: \"You shall not take a wife from\nthe daughters of Canaan.\nArise, go to Padan Aram, to the house\nof Bethuel your mother's father; and\ntake yourself a wife from there of the\ndaughters of Laban your mother's\nbrother.\n\"May God Almighty bless you, And\nmake you fruitful and multiply you, That\nyou may be an assembly of peoples;\nAnd give you the blessing of Abraham,\nTo you and your descendants with you,\nThat you may inherit the land In which\nyou are a stranger, Which God gave to\nAbraham.\"\nSo Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went\nto Padan Aram, to Laban the son of\nBethuel the Syrian, the brother of\nRebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.\nEsau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob\nand sent him away to Padan Aram to\ntake himself a wife from there, and that\nas he blessed him he gave him a charge,\nsaying, \"You shall not take a wife from\nthe daughters of Canaan,\"\nyour seed all the families of the earth\nshall be blessed.\nand that Jacob had obeyed his father\nand his mother and had gone to Padan\nAram.\nBehold, I am with you and will keep\nyou wherever you go, and will bring you\nback to this land; for I will not leave you\nuntil I have done what I have spoken to\nyou.\"\nAlso Esau saw that the daughters of\nCanaan did not please his father Isaac.\nSo Esau went to Ishmael and took\nMahalath the daughter of Ishmael,\nAbraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth,\nto be his wife in addition to the wives he\nhad.\nThen Jacob awoke from his sleep and\nsaid, \"Surely the LORD is in this place,\nand I did not know it.\"\nAnd he was afraid and said, \"How\nawesome is this place! This is none\nother than the house of God, and this is\nthe gate of heaven!\"\nNow Jacob went out from Beersheba\nand went toward Haran.\nSo he came to a certain place and\nstayed there all night, because the sun\nhad set. And he took one of the stones\nof that place and put it at his head, and\nhe lay down in that place to sleep.\nThen Jacob rose early in the morning,\nand took the stone that he had put at his\nhead, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil\non top of it.\nAnd he called the name of that place\nBethel; but the name of that city had\nbeen Luz previously.\nThen he dreamed, and behold, a\nladder was set up on the earth, and its\ntop reached to heaven; and there the\nangels of God were ascending and\ndescending on it.\nThen Jacob made a vow, saying, \"If\nGod will be with me, and keep me in this\nway that I am going, and give me bread\nto eat and clothing to put on,\nAnd behold, the LORD stood above it\nand said: \"I am the LORD God of\nAbraham your father and the God of\nIsaac; the land on which you lie I will\ngive to you and your descendants.\nAlso your descendants shall be as the\ndust of the earth; you shall spread\nabroad to the west and the east, to the\nnorth and the south; and in you and in\nso that I come back to my father's\nhouse in peace, then the LORD shall be\nmy God.\nAnd this stone which I have set as a\npillar shall be God's house, and of all\nthat You give me I will surely give a\ntenth to You.\"\n29So Jacob went on his journey and\ncame to the land of the people of the\nEast.\nAnd he looked, and saw a well in the\nfield; and behold, there were three\nflocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that\nwell they watered the flocks. A large\nstone was on the well's mouth.\nNow all the flocks would be gathered\nthere; and they would roll the stone from\nthe well's mouth, water the sheep, and\nput the stone back in its place on the\nwell's mouth.\nAnd Jacob said to them, \"My brethren,\nwhere are you from?\" And they said,\n\"We are from Haran.\"\nThen he said to them, \"Do you know\nLaban the son of Nahor?\" And they said,\n\"We know him.\"\nSo he said to them, \"Is he well?\" And\nthey said, \"He is well. And look, his\ndaughter Rachel is coming with the\nsheep.\"\nThen he said, \"Look, it is still high day;\nit is not time for the cattle to be gathered\ntogether. Water the sheep, and go and\nfeed them.\"\nBut they said, \"We cannot until all the\nflocks are gathered together, and they\nhave rolled the stone from the well's\nmouth; then we water the sheep.\"\nNow while he was still speaking with\nthem, Rachel came with her father's\nsheep, for she was a shepherdess.\nAnd it came to pass, when Jacob saw\nRachel the daughter of Laban his\nmother's brother, and the sheep of\nLaban his mother's brother, that Jacob\nwent near and rolled the stone from the\nwell's mouth, and watered the flock of\nLaban his mother's brother.\nThen Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted\nup his voice and wept.\nAnd Jacob told Rachel that he was her\nfather's relative and that he was\nRebekah's son. So she ran and told her\nfather.\nThen it came to pass, when Laban\nheard the report about Jacob his sister's\nson, that he ran to meet him, and\nembraced him and kissed him, and\nbrought him to his house. So he told\nLaban all these things.\nAnd Laban said to him, \"Surely you\nare my bone and my flesh.\" And he\nstayed with him for a month.\nThen Laban said to Jacob, \"Because\nyou are my relative, should you\ntherefore serve me for nothing? Tell me,\nwhat should your wages be?\nNow Laban had two daughters: the\nname of the elder was Leah, and the\nname of the younger was Rachel.\nLeah's eyes were delicate, but Rachel\nwas beautiful of form and appearance.\nNow Jacob loved Rachel; so he said,\n\"I will serve you seven years for Rachel\nyour younger daughter.\"\nAnd Laban said, \"It is better that I give\nher to you than that I should give her to\nanother man. Stay with me.\"\nAnd Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his\ndaughter Rachel as a maid.\nSo Jacob served seven years for\nRachel, and they seemed only a few\ndays to him because of the love he had\nfor her.\nThen Jacob also went in to Rachel,\nand he also loved Rachel more than\nLeah. And he served with Laban still\nanother seven years.\nThen Jacob said to Laban, \"Give me\nmy wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I\nmay go in to her.\"\nWhen the LORD saw that Leah was\nunloved, He opened her womb; but\nRachel was barren.\nAnd Laban gathered together all the\nmen of the place and made a feast.\nNow it came to pass in the evening,\nthat he took Leah his daughter and\nbrought her to Jacob; and he went in to\nher.\nSo Leah conceived and bore a son,\nand she called his name Reuben; for\nshe said, \"The LORD has surely looked\non my affliction. Now therefore, my\nhusband will love me.\"\nAnd Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his\ndaughter Leah as a maid.\nThen she conceived again and bore a\nson, and said, \"Because the LORD has\nheard that I am unloved, He has\ntherefore given me this son also.\" And\nshe called his name Simeon.\nSo it came to pass in the morning, that\nbehold, it was Leah. And he said to\nLaban, \"What is this you have done to\nme? Was it not for Rachel that I served\nyou? Why then have you deceived me?\"\nShe conceived again and bore a son,\nand said, \"Now this time my husband\nwill become attached to me, because I\nhave borne him three sons.\" Therefore\nhis name was called Levi.\nAnd Laban said, \"It must not be done\nso in our country, to give the younger\nbefore the firstborn.\nAnd she conceived again and bore a\nson, and said, \"Now I will praise the\nLORD.\" Therefore she called his name\nJudah. Then she stopped bearing.\nFulfill her week, and we will give you\nthis one also for the service which you\nwill serve with me still another seven\nyears.\"\nThen Jacob did so and fulfilled her\nweek. So he gave him his daughter\nRachel as wife also.\n30Now when Rachel saw that she\nbore Jacob no children, Rachel envied\nher sister, and said to Jacob, \"Give me\nchildren, or else I die!\"\nAnd Jacob's anger was aroused\nagainst Rachel, and he said, \"Am I in\nthe place of God, who has withheld from\nyou the fruit of the womb?\"\nSo she said, \"Here is my maid Bilhah;\ngo in to her, and she will bear a child on\nmy knees, that I also may have children\nby her.\"\nThen she gave him Bilhah her maid as\nwife, and Jacob went in to her.\nAnd Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a\nson.\nThen Rachel said, \"God has judged my\ncase; and He has also heard my voice\nand given me a son.\" Therefore she\ncalled his name Dan.\nAnd Rachel's maid Bilhah conceived\nagain and bore Jacob a second son.\nThen Rachel said, \"With great\nwrestlings I have wrestled with my sister,\nand indeed I have prevailed.\" So she\ncalled his name Naphtali.\nWhen Leah saw that she had stopped\nbearing, she took Zilpah her maid and\ngave her to Jacob as wife.\nAnd Leah's maid Zilpah bore Jacob a\nson.\nThen Leah said, \"A troop comes!\" So\nshe called his name Gad.\nAnd Leah's maid Zilpah bore Jacob a\nsecond son.\nThen Leah said, \"I am happy, for the\ndaughters will call me blessed.\" So she\ncalled his name Asher.\nNow Reuben went in the days of\nwheat harvest and found mandrakes in\nthe field, and brought them to his mother\nLeah. Then Rachel said to Leah,\n\"Please give me some of your son's\nmandrakes.\"\nBut she said to her, \"Is it a small\nmatter that you have taken away my\nhusband? Would you take away my\nson's mandrakes also?\" And Rachel\nsaid, \"Therefore he will lie with you\ntonight for your son's mandrakes.\"\nWhen Jacob came out of the field in\nthe evening, Leah went out to meet him\nand said, \"You must come in to me, for I\nhave surely hired you with my son's\nmandrakes.\" And he lay with her that\nnight.\nAnd God listened to Leah, and she\nconceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.\nLeah said, \"God has given me my\nwages, because I have given my maid\nto my husband.\" So she called his name\nIssachar.\nThen Leah conceived again and bore\nJacob a sixth son.\nAnd Leah said, \"God has endowed me\nwith a good endowment; now my\nhusband will dwell with me, because I\nhave borne him six sons.\" So she called\nhis name Zebulun.\nAfterward she bore a daughter, and\ncalled her name Dinah.\nThen God remembered Rachel, and\nGod listened to her and opened her\nwomb.\nanything. If you will do this thing for me,\nI will again feed and keep your flocks:\nAnd she conceived and bore a son,\nand said, \"God has taken away my\nreproach.\"\nSo she called his name Joseph, and\nsaid, \"The LORD shall add to me\nanother son.\"\nAnd it came to pass, when Rachel had\nborne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban,\n\"Send me away, that I may go to my\nown place and to my country.\nLet me pass through all your flock\ntoday, removing from there all the\nspeckled and spotted sheep, and all the\nbrown ones among the lambs, and the\nspotted and speckled among the goats;\nand these shall be my wages.\nSo my righteousness will answer for\nme in time to come, when the subject of\nmy wages comes before you: every one\nthat is not speckled and spotted among\nthe goats, and brown among the lambs,\nwill be considered stolen, if it is with\nme.\"\nGive me my wives and my children for\nwhom I have served you, and let me go;\nfor you know my service which I have\ndone for you.\"\nAnd Laban said to him, \"Please stay, if\nI have found favor in your eyes, for I\nhave learned by experience that the\nLORD has blessed me for your sake.\"\nThen he said, \"Name me your wages,\nand I will give it.\"\nSo Jacob said to him, \"You know how I\nhave served you and how your livestock\nhas been with me.\nFor what you had before I came was\nlittle, and it has increased to a great\namount; the LORD has blessed you\nsince my coming. And now, when shall I\nalso provide for my own house?\"\nSo he said, \"What shall I give you?\"\nAnd Jacob said, \"You shall not give me\nAnd Laban said, \"Oh, that it were\naccording to your word!\"\nSo he removed that day the male\ngoats that were speckled and spotted,\nall the female goats that were speckled\nand spotted, every one that had some\nwhite in it, and all the brown ones\namong the lambs, and gave them into\nthe hand of his sons.\nThen he put three days' journey\nbetween himself and Jacob, and Jacob\nfed the rest of Laban's flocks.\nNow Jacob took for himself rods of\ngreen poplar and of the almond and\nchestnut trees, peeled white strips in\nthem, and exposed the white which was\nin the rods.\nAnd the rods which he had peeled, he\nset before the flocks in the gutters, in\nthe watering troughs where the flocks\ncame to drink, so that they should\nconceive when they came to drink.\nSo Jacob sent and called Rachel and\nLeah to the field, to his flock,\nSo the flocks conceived before the\nrods, and the flocks brought forth\nstreaked, speckled, and spotted.\nand said to them, \"I see your father's\ncountenance, that it is not favorable\ntoward me as before; but the God of my\nfather has been with me.\nThen Jacob separated the lambs, and\nmade the flocks face toward the\nstreaked and all the brown in the flock of\nLaban; but he put his own flocks by\nthemselves and did not put them with\nLaban's flock.\nAnd it came to pass, whenever the\nstronger livestock conceived, that Jacob\nplaced the rods before the eyes of the\nlivestock in the gutters, that they might\nconceive among the rods.\nAnd you know that with all my might I\nhave served your father.\nYet your father has deceived me and\nchanged my wages ten times, but God\ndid not allow him to hurt me.\nIf he said thus: \"The speckled shall be\nyour wages,' then all the flocks bore\nspeckled. And if he said thus: \"The\nstreaked shall be your wages,' then all\nthe flocks bore streaked.\nBut when the flocks were feeble, he\ndid not put them in; so the feebler were\nLaban's and the stronger Jacob's.\nSo God has taken away the livestock of\nyour father and given them to me.\nThus the man became exceedingly\nprosperous, and had large flocks,\nfemale and male servants, and camels\nand donkeys.\n31Now Jacob heard the words of\nLaban's sons, saying, \"Jacob has taken\naway all that was our father's, and from\nwhat was our father's he has acquired\nall this wealth.\"\n\"And it happened, at the time when the\nflocks conceived, that I lifted my eyes\nand saw in a dream, and behold, the\nrams which leaped upon the flocks were\nstreaked, speckled, and gray-spotted.\nThen the Angel of God spoke to me in\na dream, saying, \"Jacob.' And I said,\n\"Here I am.'\nAnd Jacob saw the countenance of\nLaban, and indeed it was not favorable\ntoward him as before.\nAnd He said, \"Lift your eyes now and\nsee, all the rams which leap on the\nflocks are streaked, speckled, and grayspotted; for I have seen all that Laban is\ndoing to you.\nThen the LORD said to Jacob, \"Return\nto the land of your fathers and to your\nfamily, and I will be with you.\"\nI am the God of Bethel, where you\nanointed the pillar and where you made\na vow to Me. Now arise, get out of this\nland, and return to the land of your\nfamily.\"'\nand he overtook him in the mountains of\nGilead.\nThen Rachel and Leah answered and\nsaid to him, \"Is there still any portion or\ninheritance for us in our father's house?\nBut God had come to Laban the\nSyrian in a dream by night, and said to\nhim, \"Be careful that you speak to Jacob\nneither good nor bad.\"\nAre we not considered strangers by\nhim? For he has sold us, and also\ncompletely consumed our money.\nFor all these riches which God has\ntaken from our father are really ours and\nour children's; now then, whatever God\nhas said to you, do it.\"\nSo Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob\nhad pitched his tent in the mountains,\nand Laban with his brethren pitched in\nthe mountains of Gilead.\nThen Jacob rose and set his sons and\nhis wives on camels.\nAnd Laban said to Jacob: \"What have\nyou done, that you have stolen away\nunknown to me, and carried away my\ndaughters like captives taken with the\nsword?\nAnd he carried away all his livestock\nand all his possessions which he had\ngained, his acquired livestock which he\nhad gained in Padan Aram, to go to his\nfather Isaac in the land of Canaan.\nNow Laban had gone to shear his\nsheep, and Rachel had stolen the\nhousehold idols that were her father's.\nWhy did you flee away secretly, and\nsteal away from me, and not tell me; for\nI might have sent you away with joy and\nsongs, with timbrel and harp?\nAnd you did not allow me to kiss my\nsons and my daughters. Now you have\ndone foolishly in so doing.\nAnd Jacob stole away, unknown to\nLaban the Syrian, in that he did not tell\nhim that he intended to flee.\nIt is in my power to do you harm, but\nthe God of your father spoke to me last\nnight, saying, \"Be careful that you speak\nto Jacob neither good nor bad.'\nSo he fled with all that he had. He\narose and crossed the river, and headed\ntoward the mountains of Gilead.\nAnd now you have surely gone\nbecause you greatly long for your\nfather's house, but why did you steal my\ngods?\"\nAnd Laban was told on the third day\nthat Jacob had fled.\nThen he took his brethren with him\nand pursued him for seven days' journey,\nThen Jacob answered and said to\nLaban, \"Because I was afraid, for I said,\n\"Perhaps you would take your daughters\nfrom me by force.'\nWith whomever you find your gods, do\nnot let him live. In the presence of our\nbrethren, identify what I have of yours\nand take it with you.\" For Jacob did not\nknow that Rachel had stolen them.\nAnd Laban went into Jacob's tent, into\nLeah's tent, and into the two maids'\ntents, but he did not find them. Then he\nwent out of Leah's tent and entered\nRachel's tent.\nNow Rachel had taken the household\nidols, put them in the camel's saddle,\nand sat on them. And Laban searched\nall about the tent but did not find them.\nAnd she said to her father, \"Let it not\ndisplease my lord that I cannot rise\nbefore you, for the manner of women is\nwith me.\" And he searched but did not\nfind the household idols.\nThen Jacob was angry and rebuked\nLaban, and Jacob answered and said to\nLaban: \"What is my trespass? What is\nmy sin, that you have so hotly pursued\nme?\nrequired it from my hand, whether stolen\nby day or stolen by night.\nThere I was! In the day the drought\nconsumed me, and the frost by night,\nand my sleep departed from my eyes.\nThus I have been in your house twenty\nyears; I served you fourteen years for\nyour two daughters, and six years for\nyour flock, and you have changed my\nwages ten times.\nUnless the God of my father, the God\nof Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had\nbeen with me, surely now you would\nhave sent me away empty-handed. God\nhas seen my affliction and the labor of\nmy hands, and rebuked you last night.\"\nAnd Laban answered and said to\nJacob, \"These daughters are my\ndaughters, and these children are my\nchildren, and this flock is my flock; all\nthat you see is mine. But what can I do\nthis day to these my daughters or to\ntheir children whom they have borne?\nAlthough you have searched all my\nthings, what part of your household\nthings have you found? Set it here\nbefore my brethren and your brethren,\nthat they may judge between us both!\nNow therefore, come, let us make a\ncovenant, you and I, and let it be a\nwitness between you and me.\"\nSo Jacob took a stone and set it up as\na pillar.\nThese twenty years I have been with\nyou; your ewes and your female goats\nhave not miscarried their young, and I\nhave not eaten the rams of your flock.\nThen Jacob said to his brethren,\n\"Gather stones.\" And they took stones\nand made a heap, and they ate there on\nthe heap.\nThat which was torn by beasts I did\nnot bring to you; I bore the loss of it. You\nLaban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but\nJacob called it Galeed.\nAnd Laban said, \"This heap is a\nwitness between you and me this day.\"\nTherefore its name was called Galeed,\nWhen Jacob saw them, he said, \"This\nis God's camp.\" And he called the name\nof that place Mahanaim.\nalso Mizpah, because he said, \"May\nthe LORD watch between you and me\nwhen we are absent one from another.\nThen Jacob sent messengers before\nhim to Esau his brother in the land of\nSeir, the country of Edom.\nIf you afflict my daughters, or if you\ntake other wives besides my daughters,\nalthough no man is with us--see, God is\nwitness between you and me!\"\nAnd he commanded them, saying,\n\"Speak thus to my lord Esau, \"Thus your\nservant Jacob says: \"I have dwelt with\nLaban and stayed there until now.\nThen Laban said to Jacob, \"Here is\nthis heap and here is this pillar, which I\nhave placed between you and me.\nI have oxen, donkeys, flocks, and male\nand female servants; and I have sent to\ntell my lord, that I may find favor in your\nsight.\"\"'\nThis heap is a witness, and this pillar\nis a witness, that I will not pass beyond\nthis heap to you, and you will not pass\nbeyond this heap and this pillar to me,\nfor harm.\nThen the messengers returned to\nJacob, saying, \"We came to your\nbrother Esau, and he also is coming to\nmeet you, and four hundred men are\nwith him.\"\nThe God of Abraham, the God of\nNahor, and the God of their father judge\nbetween us.\" And Jacob swore by the\nFear of his father Isaac.\nSo Jacob was greatly afraid and\ndistressed; and he divided the people\nthat were with him, and the flocks and\nherds and camels, into two companies.\nThen Jacob offered a sacrifice on the\nmountain, and called his brethren to eat\nbread. And they ate bread and stayed\nall night on the mountain.\nAnd he said, \"If Esau comes to the one\ncompany and attacks it, then the other\ncompany which is left will escape.\"\nAnd early in the morning Laban arose,\nand kissed his sons and daughters and\nblessed them. Then Laban departed\nand returned to his place.\n32So Jacob went on his way, and\nthe angels of God met him.\nThen Jacob said, \"O God of my father\nAbraham and God of my father Isaac,\nthe LORD who said to me, \"Return to\nyour country and to your family, and I\nwill deal well with you':\nI am not worthy of the least of all the\nmercies and of all the truth which You\nhave shown Your servant; for I crossed\nover this Jordan with my staff, and now I\nhave become two companies.\nDeliver me, I pray, from the hand of\nmy brother, from the hand of Esau; for I\nfear him, lest he come and attack me\nand the mother with the children.\nFor You said, \"I will surely treat you\nwell, and make your descendants as the\nsand of the sea, which cannot be\nnumbered for multitude.\"'\nSo he lodged there that same night,\nand took what came to his hand as a\npresent for Esau his brother:\ntwo hundred female goats and twenty\nmale goats, two hundred ewes and\ntwenty rams,\nthirty milk camels with their colts, forty\ncows and ten bulls, twenty female\ndonkeys and ten foals.\nThen he delivered them to the hand of\nhis servants, every drove by itself, and\nsaid to his servants, \"Pass over before\nme, and put some distance between\nsuccessive droves.\"\nAnd he commanded the first one,\nsaying, \"When Esau my brother meets\nyou and asks you, saying, \"To whom do\nyou belong, and where are you going?\nWhose are these in front of you?'\nthen you shall say, \"They are your\nservant Jacob's. It is a present sent to\nmy lord Esau; and behold, he also is\nbehind us.\"'\nSo he commanded the second, the\nthird, and all who followed the droves,\nsaying, \"In this manner you shall speak\nto Esau when you find him;\nand also say, \"Behold, your servant\nJacob is behind us.\"' For he said, \"I will\nappease him with the present that goes\nbefore me, and afterward I will see his\nface; perhaps he will accept me.\"\nSo the present went on over before\nhim, but he himself lodged that night in\nthe camp.\nAnd he arose that night and took his\ntwo wives, his two female servants, and\nhis eleven sons, and crossed over the\nford of Jabbok.\nHe took them, sent them over the\nbrook, and sent over what he had.\nThen Jacob was left alone; and a Man\nwrestled with him until the breaking of\nday.\nNow when He saw that He did not\nprevail against him, He touched the\nsocket of his hip; and the socket of\nJacob's hip was out of joint as He\nwrestled with him.\nAnd He said, \"Let Me go, for the day\nbreaks.\" But he said, \"I will not let You\ngo unless You bless me!\"\nSo He said to him, \"What is your\nname?\" He said, \"Jacob.\"\nAnd He said, \"Your name shall no\nlonger be called Jacob, but Israel; for\nyou have struggled with God and with\nmen, and have prevailed.\"\nthese with you?\" So he said, \"The\nchildren whom God has graciously given\nyour servant.\"\nThen Jacob asked, saying, \"Tell me\nYour name, I pray.\" And He said, \"Why\nis it that you ask about My name?\" And\nHe blessed him there.\nThen the maidservants came near, they\nand their children, and bowed down.\nSo Jacob called the name of the place\nPeniel: \"For I have seen God face to\nface, and my life is preserved.\"\nAnd Leah also came near with her\nchildren, and they bowed down.\nAfterward Joseph and Rachel came\nnear, and they bowed down.\nJust as he crossed over Penuel the\nsun rose on him, and he limped on his\nhip.\nThen Esau said, \"What do you mean by\nall this company which I met?\" And he\nsaid, \"These are to find favor in the sight\nof my lord.\"\nTherefore to this day the children of\nIsrael do not eat the muscle that shrank,\nwhich is on the hip socket, because He\ntouched the socket of Jacob's hip in the\nmuscle that shrank.\nBut Esau said, \"I have enough, my\nbrother; keep what you have for\nyourself.\"\n33Now Jacob lifted his eyes and\nlooked, and there, Esau was coming,\nand with him were four hundred men.\nSo he divided the children among Leah,\nRachel, and the two maidservants.\nAnd he put the maidservants and their\nchildren in front, Leah and her children\nbehind, and Rachel and Joseph last.\nThen he crossed over before them and\nbowed himself to the ground seven\ntimes, until he came near to his brother.\nBut Esau ran to meet him, and\nembraced him, and fell on his neck and\nkissed him, and they wept.\nAnd he lifted his eyes and saw the\nwomen and children, and said, \"Who are\nAnd Jacob said, \"No, please, if I have\nnow found favor in your sight, then\nreceive my present from my hand,\ninasmuch as I have seen your face as\nthough I had seen the face of God, and\nyou were pleased with me.\nPlease, take my blessing that is\nbrought to you, because God has dealt\ngraciously with me, and because I have\nenough.\" So he urged him, and he took\nit.\nThen Esau said, \"Let us take our\njourney; let us go, and I will go before\nyou.\"\nBut Jacob said to him, \"My lord knows\nthat the children are weak, and the\nflocks and herds which are nursing are\nwith me. And if the men should drive\nthem hard one day, all the flock will die.\nPlease let my lord go on ahead before\nhis servant. I will lead on slowly at a\npace which the livestock that go before\nme, and the children, are able to endure,\nuntil I come to my lord in Seir.\"\nHis soul was strongly attracted to Dinah\nthe daughter of Jacob, and he loved the\nyoung woman and spoke kindly to the\nyoung woman.\nAnd Esau said, \"Now let me leave with\nyou some of the people who are with\nme.\" But he said, \"What need is there?\nLet me find favor in the sight of my lord.\"\nSo Shechem spoke to his father Hamor,\nsaying, \"Get me this young woman as a\nwife.\"\nSo Esau returned that day on his way\nto Seir.\nAnd Jacob heard that he had defiled\nDinah his daughter. Now his sons were\nwith his livestock in the field; so Jacob\nheld his peace until they came.\nAnd Jacob journeyed to Succoth, built\nhimself a house, and made booths for\nhis livestock. Therefore the name of the\nplace is called Succoth.\nThen Jacob came safely to the city of\nShechem, which is in the land of\nCanaan, when he came from Padan\nAram; and he pitched his tent before the\ncity.\nThen Hamor the father of Shechem\nwent out to Jacob to speak with him.\nAnd the sons of Jacob came in from the\nfield when they heard it; and the men\nwere grieved and very angry, because\nhe had done a disgraceful thing in Israel\nby lying with Jacob's daughter, a thing\nwhich ought not to be done.\nAnd he bought the parcel of land,\nwhere he had pitched his tent, from the\nchildren of Hamor, Shechem's father, for\none hundred pieces of money.\nBut Hamor spoke with them, saying,\n\"The soul of my son Shechem longs for\nyour daughter. Please give her to him as\na wife.\nThen he erected an altar there and\ncalled it El Elohe Israel.\n34Now Dinah the daughter of Leah,\nwhom she had borne to Jacob, went out\nto see the daughters of the land.\nAnd when Shechem the son of Hamor\nthe Hivite, prince of the country, saw her,\nhe took her and lay with her, and\nviolated her.\nAnd make marriages with us; give your\ndaughters to us, and take our daughters\nto yourselves.\nSo you shall dwell with us, and the\nland shall be before you. Dwell and\ntrade in it, and acquire possessions for\nyourselves in it.\"\nThen Shechem said to her father and\nher brothers, \"Let me find favor in your\neyes, and whatever you say to me I will\ngive.\nAsk me ever so much dowry and gift,\nand I will give according to what you say\nto me; but give me the young woman as\na wife.\"\ntrade in it. For indeed the land is large\nenough for them. Let us take their\ndaughters to us as wives, and let us\ngive them our daughters.\nBut the sons of Jacob answered\nShechem and Hamor his father, and\nspoke deceitfully, because he had\ndefiled Dinah their sister.\nOnly on this condition will the men\nconsent to dwell with us, to be one\npeople: if every male among us is\ncircumcised as they are circumcised.\nAnd they said to them, \"We cannot do\nthis thing, to give our sister to one who\nis uncircumcised, for that would be a\nreproach to us.\nBut on this condition we will consent to\nyou: If you will become as we are, if\nevery male of you is circumcised,\nWill not their livestock, their property,\nand every animal of theirs be ours? Only\nlet us consent to them, and they will\ndwell with us.\"\nAnd all who went out of the gate of his\ncity heeded Hamor and Shechem his\nson; every male was circumcised, all\nwho went out of the gate of his city.\nthen we will give our daughters to you,\nand we will take your daughters to us;\nand we will dwell with you, and we will\nbecome one people.\nBut if you will not heed us and be\ncircumcised, then we will take our\ndaughter and be gone.\"\nAnd their words pleased Hamor and\nShechem, Hamor's son.\nNow it came to pass on the third day,\nwhen they were in pain, that two of the\nsons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi,\nDinah's brothers, each took his sword\nand came boldly upon the city and killed\nall the males.\nAnd they killed Hamor and Shechem\nhis son with the edge of the sword, and\ntook Dinah from Shechem's house, and\nwent out.\nSo the young man did not delay to do\nthe thing, because he delighted in\nJacob's daughter. He was more\nhonorable than all the household of his\nfather.\nThe sons of Jacob came upon the\nslain, and plundered the city, because\ntheir sister had been defiled.\nThey took their sheep, their oxen, and\ntheir donkeys, what was in the city and\nwhat was in the field,\nAnd Hamor and Shechem his son\ncame to the gate of their city, and spoke\nwith the men of their city, saying:\n\"These men are at peace with us.\nTherefore let them dwell in the land and\nand all their wealth. All their little ones\nand their wives they took captive; and\nthey plundered even all that was in the\nhouses.\nSo Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel),\nwhich is in the land of Canaan, he and\nall the people who were with him.\nThen Jacob said to Simeon and Levi,\n\"You have troubled me by making me\nobnoxious among the inhabitants of the\nland, among the Canaanites and the\nPerizzites; and since I am few in number,\nthey will gather themselves together\nagainst me and kill me. I shall be\ndestroyed, my household and I.\"\nBut they said, \"Should he treat our\nsister like a harlot?\"\nAnd he built an altar there and called\nthe place El Bethel, because there God\nappeared to him when he fled from the\nface of his brother.\nNow Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died,\nand she was buried below Bethel under\nthe terebinth tree. So the name of it was\ncalled Allon Bachuth.\n35Then God said to Jacob, \"Arise,\ngo up to Bethel and dwell there; and\nmake an altar there to God, who\nappeared to you when you fled from the\nface of Esau your brother.\"\nThen God appeared to Jacob again,\nwhen he came from Padan Aram, and\nblessed him.\nAnd God said to him, \"Your name is\nJacob; your name shall not be called\nJacob anymore, but Israel shall be your\nname.\" So He called his name Israel.\nAnd Jacob said to his household and to\nall who were with him, \"Put away the\nforeign gods that are among you, purify\nyourselves, and change your garments.\nThen let us arise and go up to Bethel;\nand I will make an altar there to God,\nwho answered me in the day of my\ndistress and has been with me in the\nway which I have gone.\"\nSo they gave Jacob all the foreign gods\nwhich were in their hands, and the\nearrings which were in their ears; and\nJacob hid them under the terebinth tree\nwhich was by Shechem.\nAnd they journeyed, and the terror of\nGod was upon the cities that were all\naround them, and they did not pursue\nthe sons of Jacob.\nAlso God said to him: \"I am God\nAlmighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a\nnation and a company of nations shall\nproceed from you, and kings shall come\nfrom your body.\nThe land which I gave Abraham and\nIsaac I give to you; and to your\ndescendants after you I give this land.\"\nThen God went up from him in the\nplace where He talked with him.\nSo Jacob set up a pillar in the place\nwhere He talked with him, a pillar of\nstone; and he poured a drink offering on\nit, and he poured oil on it.\nAnd Jacob called the name of the\nplace where God spoke with him, Bethel.\nThen they journeyed from Bethel. And\nwhen there was but a little distance to\ngo to Ephrath, Rachel labored in\nchildbirth, and she had hard labor.\nNow it came to pass, when she was in\nhard labor, that the midwife said to her,\n\"Do not fear; you will have this son\nalso.\"\nAnd so it was, as her soul was\ndeparting (for she died), that she called\nhis name Ben-Oni; but his father called\nhim Benjamin.\nSo Rachel died and was buried on the\nway to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).\nAnd Jacob set a pillar on her grave,\nwhich is the pillar of Rachel's grave to\nthis day.\nThen Israel journeyed and pitched his\ntent beyond the tower of Eder.\nAnd it happened, when Israel dwelt in\nthat land, that Reuben went and lay with\nBilhah his father's concubine; and Israel\nheard about it. Now the sons of Jacob\nwere twelve:\nthe sons of Leah were Reuben,\nJacob's firstborn, and Simeon, Levi,\nJudah, Issachar, and Zebulun;\nthe sons of Rachel were Joseph and\nBenjamin;\nthe\nsons\nof\nBilhah,\nRachel's\nmaidservant, were Dan and Naphtali;\nand the sons of Zilpah, Leah's\nmaidservant, were Gad and Asher.\nThese were the sons of Jacob who were\nborn to him in Padan Aram.\nThen Jacob came to his father Isaac at\nMamre, or Kirjath Arba (that is, Hebron),\nwhere Abraham and Isaac had dwelt.\nNow the days of Isaac were one\nhundred and eighty years.\nSo Isaac breathed his last and died,\nand was gathered to his people, being\nold and full of days. And his sons Esau\nand Jacob buried him.\n36Now this is the genealogy of Esau,\nwho is Edom.\nEsau took his wives from the daughters\nof Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon\nthe Hittite; Aholibamah the daughter of\nAnah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;\nand Basemath, Ishmael's daughter,\nsister of Nebajoth.\nNow Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and\nBasemath bore Reuel.\nAnd Aholibamah bore Jeush, Jaalam,\nand Korah. These were the sons of\nEsau who were born to him in the land\nof Canaan.\nThen Esau took his wives, his sons, his\ndaughters, and all the persons of his\nhousehold, his cattle and all his animals,\nand all his goods which he had gained\nin the land of Canaan, and went to a\ncountry away from the presence of his\nbrother Jacob.\nFor their possessions were too great for\nthem to dwell together, and the land\nwhere they were strangers could not\nsupport them because of their livestock.\nSo Esau dwelt in Mount Seir. Esau is\nEdom.\nAnd this is the genealogy of Esau the\nfather of the Edomites in Mount Seir.\nThese were the names of Esau's sons:\nEliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau,\nand Reuel the son of Basemath the wife\nof Esau.\nThese were the sons of Reuel, Esau's\nson: Chief Nahath, Chief Zerah, Chief\nShammah, and Chief Mizzah. These\nwere the chiefs of Reuel in the land of\nEdom. These were the sons of\nBasemath, Esau's wife.\nAnd these were the sons of\nAholibamah, Esau's wife: Chief Jeush,\nChief Jaalam, and Chief Korah. These\nwere the chiefs who descended from\nAholibamah, Esau's wife, the daughter\nof Anah.\nThese were the sons of Esau, who is\nEdom, and these were their chiefs.\nAnd the sons of Eliphaz were Teman,\nOmar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.\nNow Timna was the concubine of\nEliphaz, Esau's son, and she bore\nAmalek to Eliphaz. These were the sons\nof Adah, Esau's wife.\nThese were the sons of Seir the Horite\nwho inhabited the land: Lotan, Shobal,\nZibeon, Anah,\nDishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were\nthe chiefs of the Horites, the sons of\nSeir, in the land of Edom.\nThese were the sons of Reuel: Nahath,\nZerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These\nwere the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.\nAnd the sons of Lotan were Hori and\nHemam. Lotan's sister was Timna.\nThese were the sons of Aholibamah,\nEsau's wife, the daughter of Anah, the\ndaughter of Zibeon. And she bore to\nEsau: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.\nThese were the chiefs of the sons of\nEsau. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn\nson of Esau, were Chief Teman, Chief\nOmar, Chief Zepho, Chief Kenaz,\nChief Korah, Chief Gatam, and Chief\nAmalek. These were the chiefs of\nEliphaz in the land of Edom. They were\nthe sons of Adah.\nThese were the sons of Shobal: Alvan,\nManahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.\nThese were the sons of Zibeon: both\nAjah and Anah. This was the Anah who\nfound the water in the wilderness as he\npastured the donkeys of his father\nZibeon.\nThese were the children of Anah:\nDishon and Aholibamah the daughter of\nAnah.\nThese were the sons of Dishon:\nHemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.\nThese were the sons of Ezer: Bilhan,\nZaavan, and Akan.\nThese were the sons of Dishan: Uz\nand Aran.\nAnd when Baal-Hanan the son of\nAchbor died, Hadar reigned in his place;\nand the name of his city was Pau. His\nwife's name was Mehetabel, the\ndaughter of Matred, the daughter of\nMezahab.\nThese were the chiefs of the Horites:\nChief Lotan, Chief Shobal, Chief Zibeon,\nChief Anah,\nChief Dishon, Chief Ezer, and Chief\nDishan. These were the chiefs of the\nHorites, according to their chiefs in the\nland of Seir.\nAnd these were the names of the\nchiefs of Esau, according to their\nfamilies and their places, by their\nnames: Chief Timnah, Chief Alvah,\nChief Jetheth,\nChief Aholibamah, Chief Elah, Chief\nPinon,\nNow these were the kings who reigned\nin the land of Edom before any king\nreigned over the children of Israel:\nChief Kenaz, Chief Teman, Chief\nMibzar,\nBela the son of Beor reigned in Edom,\nand the name of his city was Dinhabah.\nAnd when Bela died, Jobab the son of\nZerah of Bozrah reigned in his place.\nWhen Jobab died, Husham of the land\nof the Temanites reigned in his place.\nAnd when Husham died, Hadad the\nson of Bedad, who attacked Midian in\nthe field of Moab, reigned in his place.\nAnd the name of his city was Avith.\nWhen Hadad died, Samlah\nMasrekah reigned in his place.\nof\nAnd when Samlah died, Saul of\nRehoboth-by-the-River reigned in his\nplace.\nWhen Saul died, Baal-Hanan the son\nof Achbor reigned in his place.\nChief Magdiel, and Chief Iram. These\nwere the chiefs of Edom, according to\ntheir dwelling places in the land of their\npossession. Esau was the father of the\nEdomites.\n37Now Jacob dwelt in the land\nwhere his father was a stranger, in the\nland of Canaan.\nThis is the history of Jacob. Joseph,\nbeing seventeen years old, was feeding\nthe flock with his brothers. And the lad\nwas with the sons of Bilhah and the\nsons of Zilpah, his father's wives; and\nJoseph brought a bad report of them to\nhis father.\nNow Israel loved Joseph more than all\nhis children, because he was the son of\nhis old age. Also he made him a tunic of\nmany colors.\nBut when his brothers saw that their\nfather loved him more than all his\nbrothers, they hated him and could not\nspeak peaceably to him.\nAnd Israel said to Joseph, \"Are not\nyour brothers feeding the flock in\nShechem? Come, I will send you to\nthem.\" So he said to him, \"Here I am.\"\nNow Joseph had a dream, and he told\nit to his brothers; and they hated him\neven more.\nSo he said to them, \"Please hear this\ndream which I have dreamed:\nThere we were, binding sheaves in the\nfield. Then behold, my sheaf arose and\nalso stood upright; and indeed your\nsheaves stood all around and bowed\ndown to my sheaf.\"\nAnd his brothers said to him, \"Shall you\nindeed reign over us? Or shall you\nindeed have dominion over us?\" So they\nhated him even more for his dreams and\nfor his words.\nThen he dreamed still another dream\nand told it to his brothers, and said,\n\"Look, I have dreamed another dream.\nAnd this time, the sun, the moon, and\nthe eleven stars bowed down to me.\"\nSo he told it to his father and his\nbrothers; and his father rebuked him\nand said to him, \"What is this dream that\nyou have dreamed? Shall your mother\nand I and your brothers indeed come to\nbow down to the earth before you?\"\nAnd his brothers envied him, but his\nfather kept the matter in mind.\nThen he said to him, \"Please go and\nsee if it is well with your brothers and\nwell with the flocks, and bring back word\nto me.\" So he sent him out of the Valley\nof Hebron, and he went to Shechem.\nNow a certain man found him, and\nthere he was, wandering in the field.\nAnd the man asked him, saying, \"What\nare you seeking?\"\nSo he said, \"I am seeking my brothers.\nPlease tell me where they are feeding\ntheir flocks.\"\nAnd the man said, \"They have\ndeparted from here, for I heard them say,\n\"Let us go to Dothan.\"' So Joseph went\nafter his brothers and found them in\nDothan.\nNow when they saw him afar off, even\nbefore he came near them, they\nconspired against him to kill him.\nThen they said to one another, \"Look,\nthis dreamer is coming!\nCome therefore, let us now kill him\nand cast him into some pit; and we shall\nsay, \"Some wild beast has devoured\nhim.' We shall see what will become of\nhis dreams!\"\nThen his brothers went to feed their\nfather's flock in Shechem.\nBut Reuben heard it, and he delivered\nhim out of their hands, and said, \"Let us\nnot kill him.\"\nAnd Reuben said to them, \"Shed no\nblood, but cast him into this pit which is\nin the wilderness, and do not lay a hand\non him\"--that he might deliver him out of\ntheir hands, and bring him back to his\nfather.\nSo it came to pass, when Joseph had\ncome to his brothers, that they stripped\nJoseph of his tunic, the tunic of many\ncolors that was on him.\nThen they took him and cast him into a\npit. And the pit was empty; there was no\nwater in it.\nAnd they sat down to eat a meal. Then\nthey lifted their eyes and looked, and\nthere was a company of Ishmaelites,\ncoming from Gilead with their camels,\nbearing spices, balm, and myrrh, on\ntheir way to carry them down to Egypt.\nSo Judah said to his brothers, \"What\nprofit is there if we kill our brother and\nconceal his blood?\nCome and let us sell him to the\nIshmaelites, and let not our hand be\nupon him, for he is our brother and our\nflesh.\" And his brothers listened.\nThen Midianite traders passed by; so\nthe brothers pulled Joseph up and lifted\nhim out of the pit, and sold him to the\nIshmaelites for twenty shekels of silver.\nAnd they took Joseph to Egypt.\nThen Reuben returned to the pit, and\nindeed Joseph was not in the pit; and he\ntore his clothes.\nAnd he returned to his brothers and\nsaid, \"The lad is no more; and I, where\nshall I go?\"\nSo they took Joseph's tunic, killed a\nkid of the goats, and dipped the tunic in\nthe blood.\nThen they sent the tunic of many\ncolors, and they brought it to their father\nand said, \"We have found this. Do you\nknow whether it is your son's tunic or\nnot?\"\nAnd he recognized it and said, \"It is my\nson's tunic. A wild beast has devoured\nhim. Without doubt Joseph is torn to\npieces.\"\nThen Jacob tore his clothes, put\nsackcloth on his waist, and mourned for\nhis son many days.\nAnd all his sons and all his daughters\narose to comfort him; but he refused to\nbe comforted, and he said, \"For I shall\ngo down into the grave to my son in\nmourning.\" Thus his father wept for him.\nNow the Midianites had sold him in\nEgypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh\nand captain of the guard.\n38It came to pass at that time that\nJudah departed from his brothers, and\nvisited a certain Adullamite whose name\nwas Hirah.\nAnd Judah saw there a daughter of a\ncertain Canaanite whose name was\nShua, and he married her and went in to\nher.\nSo she conceived and bore a son, and\nhe called his name Er.\nAnd it was told Tamar, saying, \"Look,\nyour father-in-law is going up to Timnah\nto shear his sheep.\"\nShe conceived again and bore a son,\nand she called his name Onan.\nAnd she conceived yet again and bore\na son, and called his name Shelah. He\nwas at Chezib when she bore him.\nSo she took off her widow's garments,\ncovered herself with a veil and wrapped\nherself, and sat in an open place which\nwas on the way to Timnah; for she saw\nthat Shelah was grown, and she was not\ngiven to him as a wife.\nThen Judah took a wife for Er his\nfirstborn, and her name was Tamar.\nBut Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in\nthe sight of the LORD, and the LORD\nkilled him.\nAnd Judah said to Onan, \"Go in to your\nbrother's wife and marry her, and raise\nup an heir to your brother.\"\nBut Onan knew that the heir would not\nbe his; and it came to pass, when he\nwent in to his brother's wife, that he\nemitted on the ground, lest he should\ngive an heir to his brother.\nAnd the thing which he did displeased\nthe LORD; therefore He killed him also.\nThen Judah said to Tamar his\ndaughter-in-law, \"Remain a widow in\nyour father's house till my son Shelah is\ngrown.\" For he said, \"Lest he also die\nlike his brothers.\" And Tamar went and\ndwelt in her father's house.\nNow in the process of time the\ndaughter of Shua, Judah's wife, died;\nand Judah was comforted, and went up\nto his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and\nhis friend Hirah the Adullamite.\nWhen Judah saw her, he thought she\nwas a harlot, because she had covered\nher face.\nThen he turned to her by the way, and\nsaid, \"Please let me come in to you\"; for\nhe did not know that she was his\ndaughter-in-law. So she said, \"What will\nyou give me, that you may come in to\nme?\"\nAnd he said, \"I will send a young goat\nfrom the flock.\" So she said, \"Will you\ngive me a pledge till you send it?\nThen he said, \"What pledge shall I\ngive you?\" So she said, \"Your signet\nand cord, and your staff that is in your\nhand.\" Then he gave them to her, and\nwent in to her, and she conceived by\nhim.\nSo she arose and went away, and laid\naside her veil and put on the garments\nof her widowhood.\nAnd Judah sent the young goat by the\nhand of his friend the Adullamite, to\nreceive his pledge from the woman's\nhand, but he did not find her.\nThen he asked the men of that place,\nsaying, \"Where is the harlot who was\nopenly by the roadside?\" And they said,\n\"There was no harlot in this place.\"\nbound it on his hand, saying, \"This one\ncame out first.\"\nSo he returned to Judah and said, \"I\ncannot find her. Also, the men of the\nplace said there was no harlot in this\nplace.\"\nThen it happened, as he drew back his\nhand, that his brother came out\nunexpectedly; and she said, \"How did\nyou break through? This breach be\nupon you!\" Therefore his name was\ncalled Perez.\nThen Judah said, \"Let her take them\nfor herself, lest we be shamed; for I sent\nthis young goat and you have not found\nher.\"\nAnd it came to pass, about three\nmonths after, that Judah was told,\nsaying, \"Tamar your daughter-in-law has\nplayed the harlot; furthermore she is\nwith child by harlotry.\" So Judah said,\n\"Bring her out and let her be burned!\"\nWhen she was brought out, she sent\nto her father-in-law, saying, \"By the man\nto whom these belong, I am with child.\"\nAnd she said, \"Please determine whose\nthese are--the signet and cord, and\nstaff.\"\nSo Judah acknowledged them and\nsaid, \"She has been more righteous\nthan I, because I did not give her to\nShelah my son.\" And he never knew her\nagain.\nNow it came to pass, at the time for\ngiving birth, that behold, twins were in\nher womb.\nAnd so it was, when she was giving\nbirth, that the one put out his hand; and\nthe midwife took a scarlet thread and\nAfterward his brother came out who\nhad the scarlet thread on his hand. And\nhis name was called Zerah.\n39Now Joseph had been taken\ndown to Egypt. And Potiphar, an officer\nof Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an\nEgyptian, bought him from the\nIshmaelites who had taken him down\nthere.\nThe LORD was with Joseph, and he\nwas a successful man; and he was in\nthe house of his master the Egyptian.\nAnd his master saw that the LORD was\nwith him and that the LORD made all he\ndid to prosper in his hand.\nSo Joseph found favor in his sight, and\nserved him. Then he made him overseer\nof his house, and all that he had he put\nunder his authority.\nSo it was, from the time that he had\nmade him overseer of his house and all\nthat he had, that the LORD blessed the\nEgyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and\nthe blessing of the LORD was on all that\nhe had in the house and in the field.\nThus he left all that he had in Joseph's\nhand, and he did not know what he had\nexcept for the bread which he ate. Now\nJoseph was handsome in form and\nappearance.\nAnd it came to pass after these things\nthat his master's wife cast longing eyes\non Joseph, and she said, \"Lie with me.\"\nmock us. He came in to me to lie with\nme, and I cried out with a loud voice.\nAnd it happened, when he heard that I\nlifted my voice and cried out, that he left\nhis garment with me, and fled and went\noutside.\"\nSo she kept his garment with her until\nhis master came home.\nBut he refused and said to his master's\nwife, \"Look, my master does not know\nwhat is with me in the house, and he\nhas committed all that he has to my\nhand.\nThen she spoke to him with words like\nthese, saying, \"The Hebrew servant\nwhom you brought to us came in to me\nto mock me;\nThere is no one greater in this house\nthan I, nor has he kept back anything\nfrom me but you, because you are his\nwife. How then can I do this great\nwickedness, and sin against God?\"\nSo it was, as she spoke to Joseph day\nby day, that he did not heed her, to lie\nwith her or to be with her.\nso it happened, as I lifted my voice\nand cried out, that he left his garment\nwith me and fled outside.\"\nSo it was, when his master heard the\nwords which his wife spoke to him,\nsaying, \"Your servant did to me after this\nmanner,\" that his anger was aroused.\nBut it happened about this time, when\nJoseph went into the house to do his\nwork, and none of the men of the house\nwas inside,\nThen Joseph's master took him and\nput him into the prison, a place where\nthe king's prisoners were confined. And\nhe was there in the prison.\nthat she caught him by his garment,\nsaying, \"Lie with me.\" But he left his\ngarment in her hand, and fled and ran\noutside.\nBut the LORD was with Joseph and\nshowed him mercy, and He gave him\nfavor in the sight of the keeper of the\nprison.\nAnd so it was, when she saw that he\nhad left his garment in her hand and fled\noutside,\nAnd the keeper of the prison\ncommitted to Joseph's hand all the\nprisoners who were in the prison;\nwhatever they did there, it was his doing.\nthat she called to the men of her\nhouse and spoke to them, saying, \"See,\nhe has brought in to us a Hebrew to\nThe keeper of the prison did not look\ninto anything that was under Joseph's\nauthority, because the LORD was with\nhim; and whatever he did, the LORD\nmade it prosper.\n40It came to pass after these things\nthat the butler and the baker of the king\nof Egypt offended their lord, the king of\nEgypt.\nAnd Pharaoh was angry with his two\nofficers, the chief butler and the chief\nbaker.\nSo he put them in custody in the house\nof the captain of the guard, in the prison,\nthe place where Joseph was confined.\nAnd the captain of the guard charged\nJoseph with them, and he served them;\nso they were in custody for a while.\nThen the butler and the baker of the\nking of Egypt, who were confined in the\nprison, had a dream, both of them, each\nman's dream in one night and each\nman's dream with its own interpretation.\nAnd Joseph came in to them in the\nmorning and looked at them, and saw\nthat they were sad.\nSo he asked Pharaoh's officers who\nwere with him in the custody of his lord's\nhouse, saying, \"Why do you look so sad\ntoday?\"\nAnd they said to him, \"We each have\nhad a dream, and there is no interpreter\nof it.\" So Joseph said to them, \"Do not\ninterpretations belong to God? Tell them\nto me, please.\"\nThen the chief butler told his dream to\nJoseph, and said to him, \"Behold, in my\ndream a vine was before me,\nand in the vine were three branches; it\nwas as though it budded, its blossoms\nshot forth, and its clusters brought forth\nripe grapes.\nThen Pharaoh's cup was in my hand;\nand I took the grapes and pressed them\ninto Pharaoh's cup, and placed the cup\nin Pharaoh's hand.\"\nAnd Joseph said to him, \"This is the\ninterpretation of it: The three branches\nare three days.\nNow within three days Pharaoh will lift\nup your head and restore you to your\nplace, and you will put Pharaoh's cup in\nhis hand according to the former\nmanner, when you were his butler.\nBut remember me when it is well with\nyou, and please show kindness to me;\nmake mention of me to Pharaoh, and\nget me out of this house.\nFor indeed I was stolen away from the\nland of the Hebrews; and also I have\ndone nothing here that they should put\nme into the dungeon.\"\nWhen the chief baker saw that the\ninterpretation was good, he said to\nJoseph, \"I also was in my dream, and\nthere were three white baskets on my\nhead.\nIn the uppermost basket were all kinds\nof baked goods for Pharaoh, and the\nbirds ate them out of the basket on my\nhead.\"\nAnd the ugly and gaunt cows ate up the\nseven fine looking and fat cows. So\nPharaoh awoke.\nSo Joseph answered and said, \"This is\nthe interpretation of it: The three baskets\nare three days.\nHe slept and dreamed a second time;\nand suddenly seven heads of grain\ncame up on one stalk, plump and good.\nWithin three days Pharaoh will lift off\nyour head from you and hang you on a\ntree; and the birds will eat your flesh\nfrom you.\"\nThen behold, seven thin heads,\nblighted by the east wind, sprang up\nafter them.\nNow it came to pass on the third day,\nwhich was Pharaoh's birthday, that he\nmade a feast for all his servants; and he\nlifted up the head of the chief butler and\nof the chief baker among his servants.\nAnd the seven thin heads devoured the\nseven plump and full heads. So\nPharaoh awoke, and indeed, it was a\ndream.\nThen he restored the chief butler to his\nbutlership again, and he placed the cup\nin Pharaoh's hand.\nBut he hanged the chief baker, as\nJoseph had interpreted to them.\nYet the chief butler did not remember\nJoseph, but forgot him.\n41Then it came to pass, at the end\nof two full years, that Pharaoh had a\ndream; and behold, he stood by the river.\nSuddenly there came up out of the river\nseven cows, fine looking and fat; and\nthey fed in the meadow.\nThen behold, seven other cows came\nup after them out of the river, ugly and\ngaunt, and stood by the other cows on\nthe bank of the river.\nNow it came to pass in the morning that\nhis spirit was troubled, and he sent and\ncalled for all the magicians of Egypt and\nall its wise men. And Pharaoh told them\nhis dreams, but there was no one who\ncould interpret them for Pharaoh.\nThen the chief butler spoke to Pharaoh,\nsaying: \"I remember my faults this day.\nWhen Pharaoh was angry with his\nservants, and put me in custody in the\nhouse of the captain of the guard, both\nme and the chief baker,\nwe each had a dream in one night, he\nand I. Each of us dreamed according to\nthe interpretation of his own dream.\nNow there was a young Hebrew man\nwith us there, a servant of the captain of\nthe guard. And we told him, and he\ninterpreted our dreams for us; to each\nman he interpreted according to his own\ndream.\nAnd it came to pass, just as he\ninterpreted for us, so it happened. He\nrestored me to my office, and he hanged\nhim.\"\nAlso I saw in my dream, and suddenly\nseven heads came up on one stalk, full\nand good.\nThen Pharaoh sent and called Joseph,\nand they brought him quickly out of the\ndungeon; and he shaved, changed his\nclothing, and came to Pharaoh.\nAnd Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"I have\nhad a dream, and there is no one who\ncan interpret it. But I have heard it said\nof you that you can understand a dream,\nto interpret it.\"\nSo Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying,\n\"It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh an\nanswer of peace.\"\nThen Pharaoh said to Joseph: \"Behold,\nin my dream I stood on the bank of the\nriver.\nSuddenly seven cows came up out of\nthe river, fine looking and fat; and they\nfed in the meadow.\nThen behold, seven heads, withered,\nthin, and blighted by the east wind,\nsprang up after them.\nAnd the thin heads devoured the\nseven good heads. So I told this to the\nmagicians, but there was no one who\ncould explain it to me.\"\nThen Joseph said to Pharaoh, \"The\ndreams of Pharaoh are one; God has\nshown Pharaoh what He is about to do:\nThe seven good cows are seven years,\nand the seven good heads are seven\nyears; the dreams are one.\nAnd the seven thin and ugly cows\nwhich came up after them are seven\nyears, and the seven empty heads\nblighted by the east wind are seven\nyears of famine.\nThen behold, seven other cows came\nup after them, poor and very ugly and\ngaunt, such ugliness as I have never\nseen in all the land of Egypt.\nAnd the gaunt and ugly cows ate up\nthe first seven, the fat cows.\nWhen they had eaten them up, no one\nwould have known that they had eaten\nthem, for they were just as ugly as at the\nbeginning. So I awoke.\nThis is the thing which I have spoken\nto Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh\nwhat He is about to do.\nIndeed seven years of great plenty will\ncome throughout all the land of Egypt;\nbut after them seven years of famine\nwill arise, and all the plenty will be\nforgotten in the land of Egypt; and the\nfamine will deplete the land.\nSo the plenty will not be known in the\nland because of the famine following, for\nit will be very severe.\nAnd the dream was repeated to\nPharaoh twice because the thing is\nestablished by God, and God will shortly\nbring it to pass.\nAnd Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"See, I\nhave set you over all the land of Egypt.\"\n\"Now therefore, let Pharaoh select a\ndiscerning and wise man, and set him\nover the land of Egypt.\nThen Pharaoh took his signet ring off\nhis hand and put it on Joseph's hand;\nand he clothed him in garments of fine\nlinen and put a gold chain around his\nneck.\nLet Pharaoh do this, and let him\nappoint officers over the land, to collect\none-fifth of the produce of the land of\nEgypt in the seven plentiful years.\nAnd he had him ride in the second\nchariot which he had; and they cried out\nbefore him, \"Bow the knee!\" So he set\nhim over all the land of Egypt.\nAnd let them gather all the food of\nthose good years that are coming, and\nstore up grain under the authority of\nPharaoh, and let them keep food in the\ncities.\nPharaoh also said to Joseph, \"I am\nPharaoh, and without your consent no\nman may lift his hand or foot in all the\nland of Egypt.\"\nThen that food shall be as a reserve\nfor the land for the seven years of\nfamine which shall be in the land of\nEgypt, that the land may not perish\nduring the famine.\"\nAnd Pharaoh called Joseph's name\nZaphnath-Paaneah. And he gave him as\na wife Asenath, the daughter of PotiPherah priest of On. So Joseph went\nout over all the land of Egypt.\nSo the advice was good in the eyes of\nPharaoh and in the eyes of all his\nservants.\nJoseph was thirty years old when he\nstood before Pharaoh king of Egypt.\nAnd Joseph went out from the presence\nof Pharaoh, and went throughout all the\nland of Egypt.\nAnd Pharaoh said to his servants,\n\"Can we find such a one as this, a man\nin whom is the Spirit of God?\"\nNow in the seven plentiful years the\nground brought forth abundantly.\nThen Pharaoh said to Joseph,\n\"Inasmuch as God has shown you all\nthis, there is no one as discerning and\nwise as you.\nSo he gathered up all the food of the\nseven years which were in the land of\nEgypt, and laid up the food in the cities;\nhe laid up in every city the food of the\nfields which surrounded them.\nYou shall be over my house, and all\nmy people shall be ruled according to\nyour word; only in regard to the throne\nwill I be greater than you.\"\nJoseph gathered very much grain, as\nthe sand of the sea, until he stopped\ncounting, for it was immeasurable.\nAnd to Joseph were born two sons\nbefore the years of famine came, whom\nAsenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah\npriest of On, bore to him.\nAnd he said, \"Indeed I have heard that\nthere is grain in Egypt; go down to that\nplace and buy for us there, that we may\nlive and not die.\"\nJoseph called the name of the firstborn\nManasseh: \"For God has made me\nforget all my toil and all my father's\nhouse.\"\nAnd the name of the second he called\nEphraim: \"For God has caused me to be\nfruitful in the land of my affliction.\"\nThen the seven years of plenty which\nwere in the land of Egypt ended,\nSo Joseph's ten brothers went down to\nbuy grain in Egypt.\nBut Jacob did not send Joseph's\nbrother Benjamin with his brothers, for\nhe said, \"Lest some calamity befall him.\"\nAnd the sons of Israel went to buy grain\namong those who journeyed, for the\nfamine was in the land of Canaan.\nand the seven years of famine began\nto come, as Joseph had said. The\nfamine was in all lands, but in all the\nland of Egypt there was bread.\nNow Joseph was governor over the\nland; and it was he who sold to all the\npeople of the land. And Joseph's\nbrothers came and bowed down before\nhim with their faces to the earth.\nSo when all the land of Egypt was\nfamished, the people cried to Pharaoh\nfor bread. Then Pharaoh said to all the\nEgyptians, \"Go to Joseph; whatever he\nsays to you, do.\"\nJoseph saw\nhis brothers and\nrecognized them, but he acted as a\nstranger to them and spoke roughly to\nthem. Then he said to them, \"Where do\nyou come from?\" And they said, \"From\nthe land of Canaan to buy food.\"\nThe famine was over all the face of the\nearth, and Joseph opened all the\nstorehouses and sold to the Egyptians.\nAnd the famine became severe in the\nland of Egypt.\nSo all countries came to Joseph in\nEgypt to buy grain, because the famine\nwas severe in all lands.\nSo Joseph recognized his brothers, but\nthey did not recognize him.\nThen Joseph remembered the dreams\nwhich he had dreamed about them, and\nsaid to them, \"You are spies! You have\ncome to see the nakedness of the land!\"\n42When Jacob saw that there was\ngrain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons,\n\"Why do you look at one another?\"\nAnd they said to him, \"No, my lord, but\nyour servants have come to buy food.\nWe are all one man's sons; we are\nhonest men; your servants are not\nspies.\"\nBut he said to them, \"No, but you have\ncome to see the nakedness of the land.\"\nhear; therefore this distress has come\nupon us.\"\nAnd they said, \"Your servants are\ntwelve brothers, the sons of one man in\nthe land of Canaan; and in fact, the\nyoungest is with our father today, and\none is no more.\"\nAnd Reuben answered them, saying,\n\"Did I not speak to you, saying, \"Do not\nsin against the boy'; and you would not\nlisten? Therefore behold, his blood is\nnow required of us.\"\nBut Joseph said to them, \"It is as I\nspoke to you, saying, \"You are spies!'\nBut they did not know that Joseph\nunderstood them, for he spoke to them\nthrough an interpreter.\nIn this manner you shall be tested: By\nthe life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave\nthis place unless your youngest brother\ncomes here.\nSend one of you, and let him bring\nyour brother; and you shall be kept in\nprison, that your words may be tested to\nsee whether there is any truth in you; or\nelse, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you\nare spies!\"\nAnd he turned himself away from them\nand wept. Then he returned to them\nagain, and talked with them. And he\ntook Simeon from them and bound him\nbefore their eyes.\nThen Joseph gave a command to fill\ntheir sacks with grain, to restore every\nman's money to his sack, and to give\nthem provisions for the journey. Thus he\ndid for them.\nSo he put them all together in prison\nthree days.\nSo they loaded their donkeys with the\ngrain and departed from there.\nThen Joseph said to them the third\nday, \"Do this and live, for I fear God:\nIf you are honest men, let one of your\nbrothers be confined to your prison\nhouse; but you, go and carry grain for\nthe famine of your houses.\nBut as one of them opened his sack to\ngive his donkey feed at the encampment,\nhe saw his money; and there it was, in\nthe mouth of his sack.\nAnd bring your youngest brother to\nme; so your words will be verified, and\nyou shall not die.\" And they did so.\nSo he said to his brothers, \"My money\nhas been restored, and there it is, in my\nsack!\" Then their hearts failed them and\nthey were afraid, saying to one another,\n\"What is this that God has done to us?\"\nThen they said to one another, \"We\nare truly guilty concerning our brother,\nfor we saw the anguish of his soul when\nhe pleaded with us, and we would not\nThen they went to Jacob their father in\nthe land of Canaan and told him all that\nhad happened to them, saying:\n\"The man who is lord of the land spoke\nroughly to us, and took us for spies of\nthe country.\nis left alone. If any calamity should befall\nhim along the way in which you go, then\nyou would bring down my gray hair with\nsorrow to the grave.\"\nBut we said to him, \"We are honest\nmen; we are not spies.\nWe are twelve brothers, sons of our\nfather; one is no more, and the youngest\nis with our father this day in the land of\nCanaan.'\nThen the man, the lord of the country,\nsaid to us, \"By this I will know that you\nare honest men: Leave one of your\nbrothers here with me, take food for the\nfamine of your households, and be gone.\nAnd bring your youngest brother to\nme; so I shall know that you are not\nspies, but that you are honest men. I will\ngrant your brother to you, and you may\ntrade in the land.\"'\nThen it happened as they emptied\ntheir sacks, that surprisingly each man's\nbundle of money was in his sack; and\nwhen they and their father saw the\nbundles of money, they were afraid.\nAnd Jacob their father said to them,\n\"You have bereaved me: Joseph is no\nmore, Simeon is no more, and you want\nto take Benjamin. All these things are\nagainst me.\"\nThen Reuben spoke to his father,\nsaying, \"Kill my two sons if I do not bring\nhim back to you; put him in my hands,\nand I will bring him back to you.\"\nBut he said, \"My son shall not go down\nwith you, for his brother is dead, and he\n43Now the famine was severe in the\nland.\nAnd it came to pass, when they had\neaten up the grain which they had\nbrought from Egypt, that their father said\nto them, \"Go back, buy us a little food.\"\nBut Judah spoke to him, saying, \"The\nman solemnly warned us, saying, \"You\nshall not see my face unless your\nbrother is with you.'\nIf you send our brother with us, we will\ngo down and buy you food.\nBut if you will not send him, we will not\ngo down; for the man said to us, \"You\nshall not see my face unless your\nbrother is with you.\"'\nAnd Israel said, \"Why did you deal so\nwrongfully with me as to tell the man\nwhether you had still another brother?\"\nBut they said, \"The man asked us\npointedly about ourselves and our family,\nsaying, \"Is your father still alive? Have\nyou another brother?' And we told him\naccording to these words. Could we\npossibly have known that he would say,\n\"Bring your brother down'?\"\nThen Judah said to Israel his father,\n\"Send the lad with me, and we will arise\nand go, that we may live and not die,\nboth we and you and also our little ones.\nI myself will be surety for him; from my\nhand you shall require him. If I do not\nbring him back to you and set him\nbefore you, then let me bear the blame\nforever.\nFor if we had not lingered, surely by\nnow we would have returned this\nsecond time.\"\nAnd their father Israel said to them, \"If\nit must be so, then do this: Take some\nof the best fruits of the land in your\nvessels and carry down a present for\nthe man--a little balm and a little honey,\nspices and myrrh, pistachio nuts and\nalmonds.\nThen the man did as Joseph ordered,\nand the man brought the men into\nJoseph's house.\nNow the men were afraid because\nthey were brought into Joseph's house;\nand they said, \"It is because of the\nmoney, which was returned in our sacks\nthe first time, that we are brought in, so\nthat he may make a case against us and\nseize us, to take us as slaves with our\ndonkeys.\"\nWhen they drew near to the steward of\nJoseph's house, they talked with him at\nthe door of the house,\nTake double money in your hand, and\ntake back in your hand the money that\nwas returned in the mouth of your\nsacks; perhaps it was an oversight.\nTake your brother also, and arise, go\nback to the man.\nand said, \"O sir, we indeed came\ndown the first time to buy food;\nbut it happened, when we came to the\nencampment, that we opened our sacks,\nand there, each man's money was in the\nmouth of his sack, our money in full\nweight; so we have brought it back in\nour hand.\nAnd may God Almighty give you mercy\nbefore the man, that he may release\nyour other brother and Benjamin. If I am\nbereaved, I am bereaved!\"\nAnd we have brought down other\nmoney in our hands to buy food. We do\nnot know who put our money in our\nsacks.\"\nSo the men took that present and\nBenjamin, and they took double money\nin their hand, and arose and went down\nto Egypt; and they stood before Joseph.\nWhen Joseph saw Benjamin with them,\nhe said to the steward of his house,\n\"Take these men to my home, and\nslaughter an animal and make ready; for\nthese men will dine with me at noon.\"\nBut he said, \"Peace be with you, do\nnot be afraid. Your God and the God of\nyour father has given you treasure in\nyour sacks; I had your money.\" Then he\nbrought Simeon out to them.\nSo the man brought the men into\nJoseph's house and gave them water,\nand they washed their feet; and he gave\ntheir donkeys feed.\nThen they made the present ready for\nJoseph's coming at noon, for they heard\nthat they would eat bread there.\nyoungest according to his youth; and the\nmen looked in astonishment at one\nanother.\nAnd when Joseph came home, they\nbrought him the present which was in\ntheir hand into the house, and bowed\ndown before him to the earth.\nThen he took servings to them from\nbefore him, but Benjamin's serving was\nfive times as much as any of theirs. So\nthey drank and were merry with him.\n44And he commanded the steward\nThen he asked them about their wellbeing, and said, \"Is your father well, the\nold man of whom you spoke? Is he still\nalive?\"\nAnd they answered, \"Your servant our\nfather is in good health; he is still alive.\"\nAnd they bowed their heads down and\nprostrated themselves.\nThen he lifted his eyes and saw his\nbrother Benjamin, his mother's son, and\nsaid, \"Is this your younger brother of\nwhom you spoke to me?\" And he said,\n\"God be gracious to you, my son.\"\nNow his heart yearned for his brother;\nso Joseph made haste and sought\nsomewhere to weep. And he went into\nhis chamber and wept there.\nThen he washed his face and came\nout; and he restrained himself, and said,\n\"Serve the bread.\"\nSo they set him a place by himself,\nand them by themselves, and the\nEgyptians who ate with him by\nthemselves; because the Egyptians\ncould not eat food with the Hebrews, for\nthat is an abomination to the Egyptians.\nAnd they sat before him, the firstborn\naccording to his birthright and the\nof his house, saying, \"Fill the men's\nsacks with food, as much as they can\ncarry, and put each man's money in the\nmouth of his sack.\nAlso put my cup, the silver cup, in the\nmouth of the sack of the youngest, and\nhis grain money.\" So he did according to\nthe word that Joseph had spoken.\nAs soon as the morning dawned, the\nmen were sent away, they and their\ndonkeys.\nWhen they had gone out of the city,\nand were not yet far off, Joseph said to\nhis steward, \"Get up, follow the men;\nand when you overtake them, say to\nthem, \"Why have you repaid evil for\ngood?\nIs not this the one from which my lord\ndrinks, and with which he indeed\npractices divination? You have done evil\nin so doing.\"'\nSo he overtook them, and he spoke to\nthem these same words.\nAnd they said to him, \"Why does my\nlord say these words? Far be it from us\nthat your servants should do such a\nthing.\nhere we are, my lord's slaves, both we\nand he also with whom the cup was\nfound.\"\nLook, we brought back to you from the\nland of Canaan the money which we\nfound in the mouth of our sacks. How\nthen could we steal silver or gold from\nyour lord's house?\nBut he said, \"Far be it from me that I\nshould do so; the man in whose hand\nthe cup was found, he shall be my slave.\nAnd as for you, go up in peace to your\nfather.\"\nWith whomever of your servants it is\nfound, let him die, and we also will be\nmy lord's slaves.\"\nAnd he said, \"Now also let it be\naccording to your words; he with whom\nit is found shall be my slave, and you\nshall be blameless.\"\nThen Judah came near to him and\nsaid: \"O my lord, please let your servant\nspeak a word in my lord's hearing, and\ndo not let your anger burn against your\nservant; for you are even like Pharaoh.\nMy lord asked his servants, saying,\n\"Have you a father or a brother?'\nThen each man speedily let down his\nsack to the ground, and each opened\nhis sack.\nSo he searched. He began with the\noldest and left off with the youngest; and\nthe cup was found in Benjamin's sack.\nThen they tore their clothes, and each\nman loaded his donkey and returned to\nthe city.\nSo Judah and his brothers came to\nJoseph's house, and he was still there;\nand they fell before him on the ground.\nAnd Joseph said to them, \"What deed\nis this you have done? Did you not know\nthat such a man as I can certainly\npractice divination?\"\nThen Judah said, \"What shall we say\nto my lord? What shall we speak? Or\nhow shall we clear ourselves? God has\nfound out the iniquity of your servants;\nAnd we said to my lord, \"We have a\nfather, an old man, and a child of his old\nage, who is young; his brother is dead,\nand he alone is left of his mother's\nchildren, and his father loves him.'\nThen you said to your servants, \"Bring\nhim down to me, that I may set my eyes\non him.'\nAnd we said to my lord, \"The lad\ncannot leave his father, for if he should\nleave his father, his father would die.'\nBut you said to your servants, \"Unless\nyour youngest brother comes down with\nyou, you shall see my face no more.'\n\"So it was, when we went up to your\nservant my father, that we told him the\nwords of my lord.\nAnd our father said, \"Go back and buy\nus a little food.'\nBut we said, \"We cannot go down; if\nour youngest brother is with us, then we\nwill go down; for we may not see the\nman's face unless our youngest brother\nis with us.'\nThen your servant my father said to us,\n\"You know that my wife bore me two\nsons;\nand the one went out from me, and I\nsaid, \"Surely he is torn to pieces\"; and I\nhave not seen him since.\nBut if you take this one also from me,\nand calamity befalls him, you shall bring\ndown my gray hair with sorrow to the\ngrave.'\n\"Now therefore, when I come to your\nservant my father, and the lad is not with\nus, since his life is bound up in the lad's\nlife,\nit will happen, when he sees that the\nlad is not with us, that he will die. So\nyour servants will bring down the gray\nhair of your servant our father with\nsorrow to the grave.\nFor your servant became surety for the\nlad to my father, saying, \"If I do not bring\nhim back to you, then I shall bear the\nblame before my father forever.'\nNow therefore, please let your servant\nremain instead of the lad as a slave to\nmy lord, and let the lad go up with his\nbrothers.\nFor how shall I go up to my father if\nthe lad is not with me, lest perhaps I see\nthe evil that would come upon my\nfather?\"\n45Then Joseph could not restrain\nhimself before all those who stood by\nhim, and he cried out, \"Make everyone\ngo out from me!\" So no one stood with\nhim while Joseph made himself known\nto his brothers.\nAnd he wept aloud, and the Egyptians\nand the house of Pharaoh heard it.\nThen Joseph said to his brothers, \"I am\nJoseph; does my father still live?\" But\nhis brothers could not answer him, for\nthey were dismayed in his presence.\nAnd Joseph said to his brothers,\n\"Please come near to me.\" So they\ncame near. Then he said: \"I am Joseph\nyour brother, whom you sold into Egypt.\nBut now, do not therefore be grieved or\nangry with yourselves because you sold\nme here; for God sent me before you to\npreserve life.\nFor these two years the famine has\nbeen in the land, and there are still five\nyears in which there will be neither\nplowing nor harvesting.\nAnd God sent me before you to\npreserve a posterity for you in the earth,\nand to save your lives by a great\ndeliverance.\nSo now it was not you who sent me\nhere, but God; and He has made me a\nfather to Pharaoh, and lord of all his\nhouse, and a ruler throughout all the\nland of Egypt.\nanimals and depart; go to the land of\nCanaan.\n\"Hurry and go up to my father, and say\nto him, \"Thus says your son Joseph:\n\"God has made me lord of all Egypt;\ncome down to me, do not tarry.\nBring your father and your households\nand come to me; I will give you the best\nof the land of Egypt, and you will eat the\nfat of the land.\nYou shall dwell in the land of Goshen,\nand you shall be near to me, you and\nyour children, your children's children,\nyour flocks and your herds, and all that\nyou have.\nNow you are commanded--do this:\nTake carts out of the land of Egypt for\nyour little ones and your wives; bring\nyour father and come.\nThere I will provide for you, lest you\nand your household, and all that you\nhave, come to poverty; for there are still\nfive years of famine.\"'\n\"And behold, your eyes and the eyes\nof my brother Benjamin see that it is my\nmouth that speaks to you.\nAlso do not be concerned about your\ngoods, for the best of all the land of\nEgypt is yours.\"'\nThen the sons of Israel did so; and\nJoseph gave them carts, according to\nthe command of Pharaoh, and he gave\nthem provisions for the journey.\nSo you shall tell my father of all my\nglory in Egypt, and of all that you have\nseen; and you shall hurry and bring my\nfather down here.\"\nHe gave to all of them, to each man,\nchanges of garments; but to Benjamin\nhe gave three hundred pieces of silver\nand five changes of garments.\nThen he fell on his brother Benjamin's\nneck and wept, and Benjamin wept on\nhis neck.\nAnd he sent to his father these things:\nten donkeys loaded with the good things\nof Egypt, and ten female donkeys\nloaded with grain, bread, and food for\nhis father for the journey.\nMoreover he kissed all his brothers\nand wept over them, and after that his\nbrothers talked with him.\nNow the report of it was heard in\nPharaoh's house, saying, \"Joseph's\nbrothers have come.\" So it pleased\nPharaoh and his servants well.\nAnd Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"Say to\nyour brothers, \"Do this: Load your\nSo he sent his brothers away, and\nthey departed; and he said to them,\n\"See that you do not become troubled\nalong the way.\"\nThen they went up out of Egypt, and\ncame to the land of Canaan to Jacob\ntheir father.\nAnd they told him, saying, \"Joseph is\nstill alive, and he is governor over all the\nland of Egypt.\" And Jacob's heart stood\nstill, because he did not believe them.\nBut when they told him all the words\nwhich Joseph had said to them, and\nwhen he saw the carts which Joseph\nhad sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob\ntheir father revived.\nThen Israel said, \"It is enough. Joseph\nmy son is still alive. I will go and see him\nbefore I die.\"\n46So Israel took his journey with all\nthat he had, and came to Beersheba,\nand offered sacrifices to the God of his\nfather Isaac.\nThen God spoke to Israel in the visions\nof the night, and said, \"Jacob, Jacob!\"\nAnd he said, \"Here I am.\"\nSo He said, \"I am God, the God of your\nfather; do not fear to go down to Egypt,\nfor I will make of you a great nation\nthere.\nland of Canaan, and went to Egypt,\nJacob and all his descendants with him.\nHis sons and his sons' sons, his\ndaughters and his sons' daughters, and\nall his descendants he brought with him\nto Egypt.\nNow these were the names of the\nchildren of Israel, Jacob and his sons,\nwho went to Egypt: Reuben was Jacob's\nfirstborn.\nThe sons of Reuben were Hanoch,\nPallu, Hezron, and Carmi.\nThe sons of Simeon were Jemuel,\nJamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul,\nthe son of a Canaanite woman.\nThe sons of Levi were Gershon,\nKohath, and Merari.\nThe sons of Judah were Er, Onan,\nShelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and\nOnan died in the land of Canaan). The\nsons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.\nThe sons of Issachar were Tola,\nPuvah, Job, and Shimron.\nI will go down with you to Egypt, and I\nwill also surely bring you up again; and\nJoseph will put his hand on your eyes.\"\nThe sons of Zebulun were Sered, Elon,\nand Jahleel.\nThen Jacob arose from Beersheba; and\nthe sons of Israel carried their father\nJacob, their little ones, and their wives,\nin the carts which Pharaoh had sent to\ncarry him.\nThese were the sons of Leah, whom\nshe bore to Jacob in Padan Aram, with\nhis daughter Dinah. All the persons, his\nsons and his daughters, were thirtythree.\nSo they took their livestock and their\ngoods, which they had acquired in the\nThe sons of Gad were Ziphion, Haggi,\nShuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.\nThe sons of Asher were Jimnah,\nIshuah, Isui, Beriah, and Serah, their\nsister. And the sons of Beriah were\nHeber and Malchiel.\nThese were the sons of Zilpah, whom\nLaban gave to Leah his daughter; and\nthese she bore to Jacob: sixteen\npersons.\nThe sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife,\nwere Joseph and Benjamin.\nAll the persons of the house of Jacob\nwho went to Egypt were seventy.\nThen he sent Judah before him to\nJoseph, to point out before him the way\nto Goshen. And they came to the land of\nGoshen.\nSo Joseph made ready his chariot and\nwent up to Goshen to meet his father\nIsrael; and he presented himself to him,\nand fell on his neck and wept on his\nneck a good while.\nAnd to Joseph in the land of Egypt\nwere born Manasseh and Ephraim,\nwhom Asenath, the daughter of PotiPherah priest of On, bore to him.\nAnd Israel said to Joseph, \"Now let me\ndie, since I have seen your face,\nbecause you are still alive.\"\nThe sons of Benjamin were Belah,\nBecher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi,\nRosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.\nThese were the sons of Rachel, who\nwere born to Jacob: fourteen persons in\nall.\nThe son of Dan was Hushim.\nThe sons of Naphtali were Jahzeel,\nGuni, Jezer, and Shillem.\nThese were the sons of Bilhah, whom\nLaban gave to Rachel his daughter, and\nshe bore these to Jacob: seven persons\nin all.\nAll the persons who went with Jacob to\nEgypt, who came from his body, besides\nJacob's sons' wives, were sixty-six\npersons in all.\nAnd the sons of Joseph who were\nborn to him in Egypt were two persons.\nThen Joseph said to his brothers and\nto his father's household, \"I will go up\nand tell Pharaoh, and say to him, \"My\nbrothers and those of my father's house,\nwho were in the land of Canaan, have\ncome to me.\nAnd the men are shepherds, for their\noccupation has been to feed livestock;\nand they have brought their flocks, their\nherds, and all that they have.'\nSo it shall be, when Pharaoh calls you\nand says, \"What is your occupation?'\nthat you shall say, \"Your servants'\noccupation has been with livestock from\nour youth even till now, both we and\nalso our fathers,' that you may dwell in\nthe land of Goshen; for every shepherd\nis an abomination to the Egyptians.\"\n47Then Joseph went and told\nPharaoh, and said, \"My father and my\nbrothers, their flocks and their herds and\nall that they possess, have come from\nthe land of Canaan; and indeed they are\nin the land of Goshen.\"\nhave been the days of the years of my\nlife, and they have not attained to the\ndays of the years of the life of my\nfathers in the days of their pilgrimage.\"\nAnd he took five men from among his\nbrothers and presented them to\nPharaoh.\nSo Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went\nout from before Pharaoh.\nThen Pharaoh said to his brothers,\n\"What is your occupation?\" And they\nsaid to Pharaoh, \"Your servants are\nshepherds, both we and also our\nfathers.\"\nAnd Joseph situated his father and his\nbrothers, and gave them a possession\nin the land of Egypt, in the best of the\nland, in the land of Rameses, as\nPharaoh had commanded.\nAnd they said to Pharaoh, \"We have\ncome to dwell in the land, because your\nservants have no pasture for their flocks,\nfor the famine is severe in the land of\nCanaan. Now therefore, please let your\nservants dwell in the land of Goshen.\"\nThen Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying,\n\"Your father and your brothers have\ncome to you.\nThen Joseph provided his father, his\nbrothers, and all his father's household\nwith bread, according to the number in\ntheir families.\nNow there was no bread in all the\nland; for the famine was very severe, so\nthat the land of Egypt and the land of\nCanaan languished because of the\nfamine.\nThe land of Egypt is before you. Have\nyour father and brothers dwell in the\nbest of the land; let them dwell in the\nland of Goshen. And if you know any\ncompetent men among them, then make\nthem chief herdsmen over my livestock.\"\nThen Joseph brought in his father\nJacob and set him before Pharaoh; and\nJacob blessed Pharaoh.\nAnd Joseph gathered up all the money\nthat was found in the land of Egypt and\nin the land of Canaan, for the grain\nwhich they bought; and Joseph brought\nthe money into Pharaoh's house.\nSo when the money failed in the land\nof Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all\nthe Egyptians came to Joseph and said,\n\"Give us bread, for why should we die in\nyour presence? For the money has\nfailed.\"\nPharaoh said to Jacob, \"How old are\nyou?\"\nAnd Jacob said to Pharaoh, \"The days\nof the years of my pilgrimage are one\nhundred and thirty years; few and evil\nThen Joseph said, \"Give your livestock,\nand I will give you bread for your\nlivestock, if the money is gone.\"\nSo they brought their livestock to\nJoseph, and Joseph gave them bread in\nexchange for the horses, the flocks, the\ncattle of the herds, and for the donkeys.\nThus he fed them with bread in\nexchange for all their livestock that year.\nAnd it shall come to pass in the\nharvest that you shall give one-fifth to\nPharaoh. Four-fifths shall be your own,\nas seed for the field and for your food,\nfor those of your households and as\nfood for your little ones.\"\nWhen that year had ended, they came\nto him the next year and said to him,\n\"We will not hide from my lord that our\nmoney is gone; my lord also has our\nherds of livestock. There is nothing left\nin the sight of my lord but our bodies\nand our lands.\nWhy should we die before your eyes,\nboth we and our land? Buy us and our\nland for bread, and we and our land will\nbe servants of Pharaoh; give us seed,\nthat we may live and not die, that the\nland may not be desolate.\"\nThen Joseph bought all the land of\nEgypt for Pharaoh; for every man of the\nEgyptians sold his field, because the\nfamine was severe upon them. So the\nland became Pharaoh's.\nSo they said, \"You have saved our\nlives; let us find favor in the sight of my\nlord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.\"\nAnd Joseph made it a law over the\nland of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh\nshould have one-fifth, except for the\nland of the priests only, which did not\nbecome Pharaoh's.\nSo Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in\nthe country of Goshen; and they had\npossessions there and grew and\nmultiplied exceedingly.\nAnd Jacob lived in the land of Egypt\nseventeen years. So the length of\nJacob's life was one hundred and fortyseven years.\nAnd as for the people, he moved them\ninto the cities, from one end of the\nborders of Egypt to the other end.\nOnly the land of the priests he did not\nbuy; for the priests had rations allotted\nto them by Pharaoh, and they ate their\nrations which Pharaoh gave them;\ntherefore they did not sell their lands.\nThen Joseph said to the people,\n\"Indeed I have bought you and your land\nthis day for Pharaoh. Look, here is seed\nfor you, and you shall sow the land.\nWhen the time drew near that Israel\nmust die, he called his son Joseph and\nsaid to him, \"Now if I have found favor in\nyour sight, please put your hand under\nmy thigh, and deal kindly and truly with\nme. Please do not bury me in Egypt,\nbut let me lie with my fathers; you shall\ncarry me out of Egypt and bury me in\ntheir burial place.\" And he said, \"I will do\nas you have said.\"\nThen he said, \"Swear to me.\" And he\nswore to him. So Israel bowed himself\non the head of the bed.\n48Now it came to pass after these\nthings that Joseph was told, \"Indeed\nyour father is sick\"; and he took with him\nhis two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.\nAnd Jacob was told, \"Look, your son\nJoseph is coming to you\"; and Israel\nstrengthened himself and sat up on the\nbed.\nThen Jacob said to Joseph: \"God\nAlmighty appeared to me at Luz in the\nland of Canaan and blessed me,\nand said to me, \"Behold, I will make\nyou fruitful and multiply you, and I will\nmake of you a multitude of people, and\ngive this land to your descendants after\nyou as an everlasting possession.'\nAnd now your two sons, Ephraim and\nManasseh, who were born to you in the\nland of Egypt before I came to you in\nEgypt, are mine; as Reuben and\nSimeon, they shall be mine.\nYour offspring whom you beget after\nthem shall be yours; they will be called\nby the name of their brothers in their\ninheritance.\nBut as for me, when I came from Padan,\nRachel died beside me in the land of\nCanaan on the way, when there was but\na little distance to go to Ephrath; and I\nburied her there on the way to Ephrath\n(that is, Bethlehem).\"\nThen Israel saw Joseph's sons, and\nsaid, \"Who are these?\"\nJoseph said to his father, \"They are my\nsons, whom God has given me in this\nplace.\" And he said, \"Please bring them\nto me, and I will bless them.\"\nNow the eyes of Israel were dim with\nage, so that he could not see. Then\nJoseph brought them near him, and he\nkissed them and embraced them.\nAnd Israel said to Joseph, \"I had not\nthought to see your face; but in fact,\nGod has also shown me your offspring!\"\nSo Joseph brought them from beside\nhis knees, and he bowed down with his\nface to the earth.\nAnd Joseph took them both, Ephraim\nwith his right hand toward Israel's left\nhand, and Manasseh with his left hand\ntoward Israel's right hand, and brought\nthem near him.\nThen Israel stretched out his right\nhand and laid it on Ephraim's head, who\nwas the younger, and his left hand on\nManasseh's head, guiding his hands\nknowingly, for Manasseh was the\nfirstborn.\nAnd he blessed Joseph, and said:\n\"God, before whom my fathers Abraham\nand Isaac walked, The God who has fed\nme all my life long to this day,\nThe Angel who has redeemed me\nfrom all evil, Bless the lads; Let my\nname be named upon them, And the\nname of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;\nAnd let them grow into a multitude in the\nmidst of the earth.\"\nNow when Joseph saw that his father\nlaid his right hand on the head of\nEphraim, it displeased him; so he took\nhold of his father's hand to remove it\nfrom Ephraim's head to Manasseh's\nhead.\nAnd Joseph said to his father, \"Not so,\nmy father, for this one is the firstborn;\nput your right hand on his head.\"\n\"Reuben, you are my firstborn, My\nmight and the beginning of my strength,\nThe excellency of dignity and the\nexcellency of power.\nUnstable as water, you shall not excel,\nBecause you went up to your father's\nbed; Then you defiled it-- He went up to\nmy couch.\nBut his father refused and said, \"I\nknow, my son, I know. He also shall\nbecome a people, and he also shall be\ngreat; but truly his younger brother shall\nbe greater than he, and his descendants\nshall become a multitude of nations.\"\nSo he blessed them that day, saying,\n\"By you Israel will bless, saying, \"May\nGod make you as Ephraim and as\nManasseh!\"' And thus he set Ephraim\nbefore Manasseh.\nThen Israel said to Joseph, \"Behold, I\nam dying, but God will be with you and\nbring you back to the land of your\nfathers.\nMoreover I have given to you one\nportion above your brothers, which I\ntook from the hand of the Amorite with\nmy sword and my bow.\"\n49And Jacob called his sons and\n\"Simeon and Levi are brothers;\nInstruments of cruelty are in their\ndwelling place.\nLet not my soul enter their council; Let\nnot my honor be united to their\nassembly; For in their anger they slew a\nman, And in their self-will they\nhamstrung an ox.\nCursed be their anger, for it is fierce;\nAnd their wrath, for it is cruel!

And he blessed them; he blessed\neach one according to his own blessing.\nThen he charged them and said to\nthem: \"I am to be gathered to my\npeople; bury me with my fathers in the\ncave that is in the field of Ephron the\nHittite,\nin the cave that is in the field of\nMachpelah, which is before Mamre in\nthe land of Canaan, which Abraham\nbought with the field of Ephron the\nHittite as a possession for a burial place.\nAnd Pharaoh said, \"Go up and bury\nyour father, as he made you swear.\"\nThere they buried Abraham and Sarah\nhis wife, there they buried Isaac and\nRebekah his wife, and there I buried\nLeah.\nSo Joseph went up to bury his father;\nand with him went up all the servants of\nPharaoh, the elders of his house, and all\nthe elders of the land of Egypt,\nThe field and the cave that is there\nwere purchased from the sons of Heth.\"\nAnd when Jacob had finished\ncommanding his sons, he drew his feet\nup into the bed and breathed his last,\nand was gathered to his people.\n50Then Joseph fell on his father's\nface and wept over him, and kissed him.\nAnd Joseph commanded his servants\nthe physicians to embalm his father. So\nthe physicians embalmed Israel.\nForty days were required for him, for\nsuch are the days required for those\nwho are embalmed; and the Egyptians\nmourned for him seventy days.\nNow when the days of his mourning\nwere past, Joseph spoke to the\nhousehold of Pharaoh, saying, \"If now I\nhave found favor in your eyes, please\nspeak in the hearing of Pharaoh, saying,\n\"My father made me swear, saying,\n\"Behold, I am dying; in my grave which I\ndug for myself in the land of Canaan,\nthere you shall bury me.\" Now therefore,\nplease let me go up and bury my father,\nand I will come back.\"'\nas well as all the house of Joseph, his\nbrothers, and his father's house. Only\ntheir little ones, their flocks, and their\nherds they left in the land of Goshen.\nAnd there went up with him both\nchariots and horsemen, and it was a\nvery great gathering.\nThen they came to the threshing floor\nof Atad, which is beyond the Jordan,\nand they mourned there with a great\nand very solemn lamentation. He\nobserved seven days of mourning for\nhis father.\nAnd when the inhabitants of the land,\nthe Canaanites, saw the mourning at the\nthreshing floor of Atad, they said, \"This\nis a deep mourning of the Egyptians.\"\nTherefore its name was called Abel\nMizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.\nSo his sons did for him just as he had\ncommanded them.\nFor his sons carried him to the land of\nCanaan, and buried him in the cave of\nthe field of Machpelah, before Mamre,\nwhich Abraham bought with the field\nfrom Ephron the Hittite as property for a\nburial place.\nAnd after he had buried his father,\nJoseph returned to Egypt, he and his\nbrothers and all who went up with him to\nbury his father.\nto bring it about as it is this day, to save\nmany people alive.\nWhen Joseph's brothers saw that their\nfather was dead, they said, \"Perhaps\nJoseph will hate us, and may actually\nrepay us for all the evil which we did to\nhim.\"\nNow therefore, do not be afraid; I will\nprovide for you and your little ones.\" And\nhe comforted them and spoke kindly to\nthem.\nSo they sent messengers to Joseph,\nsaying, \"Before your father died he\ncommanded, saying,\nSo Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his\nfather's household. And Joseph lived\none hundred and ten years.\n\"Thus you shall say to Joseph: \"I beg\nyou, please forgive the trespass of your\nbrothers and their sin; for they did evil to\nyou.\"' Now, please, forgive the trespass\nof the servants of the God of your\nfather.\" And Joseph wept when they\nspoke to him.\nThen his brothers also went and fell\ndown before his face, and they said,\n\"Behold, we are your servants.\"\nJoseph saw Ephraim's children to the\nthird generation. The children of Machir,\nthe son of Manasseh, were also brought\nup on Joseph's knees.\nAnd Joseph said to his brethren, \"I am\ndying; but God will surely visit you, and\nbring you out of this land to the land of\nwhich He swore to Abraham, to Isaac,\nand to Jacob.\"\nJoseph said to them, \"Do not be afraid,\nfor am I in the place of God?\nThen Joseph took an oath from the\nchildren of Israel, saying, \"God will\nsurely visit you, and you shall carry up\nmy bones from here.\"\nBut as for you, you meant evil against\nme; but God meant it for good, in order\nSo Joseph died, being one hundred\nand ten years old; and they embalmed\nhim, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\nExodus\n1Now these are the names of the\nchildren of Israel who came to Egypt;\neach man and his household came with\nJacob:\nReuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;\nIssachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;\nDan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.\nTherefore they set taskmasters over\nthem to afflict them with their burdens.\nAnd they built for Pharaoh supply cities,\nPithom and Raamses.\nBut the more they afflicted them, the\nmore they multiplied and grew. And they\nwere in dread of the children of Israel.\nSo the Egyptians made the children of\nIsrael serve with rigor.\nAll those who were descendants of\nJacob were seventy persons (for Joseph\nwas in Egypt already).\nAnd they made their lives bitter with\nhard bondage--in mortar, in brick, and in\nall manner of service in the field. All their\nservice in which they made them serve\nwas with rigor.\nAnd Joseph died, all his brothers, and\nall that generation.\nBut the children of Israel were fruitful\nand increased abundantly, multiplied\nand grew exceedingly mighty; and the\nland was filled with them.\nThen the king of Egypt spoke to the\nHebrew midwives, of whom the name of\none was Shiphrah and the name of the\nother Puah;\nNow there arose a new king over Egypt,\nwho did not know Joseph.\nand he said, \"When you do the duties\nof a midwife for the Hebrew women, and\nsee them on the birthstools, if it is a son,\nthen you shall kill him; but if it is a\ndaughter, then she shall live.\"\nAnd he said to his people, \"Look, the\npeople of the children of Israel are more\nand mightier than we;\nBut the midwives feared God, and did\nnot do as the king of Egypt commanded\nthem, but saved the male children alive.\ncome, let us deal shrewdly with them,\nlest they multiply, and it happen, in the\nevent of war, that they also join our\nenemies and fight against us, and so go\nup out of the land.\"\nSo the king of Egypt called for the\nmidwives and said to them, \"Why have\nyou done this thing, and saved the male\nchildren alive?\"\nAnd the midwives said to Pharaoh,\n\"Because the Hebrew women are not\nlike the Egyptian women; for they are\nlively and give birth before the midwives\ncome to them.\"\nshe had compassion on him, and said,\n\"This is one of the Hebrews' children.\"\nTherefore God dealt well with the\nmidwives, and the people multiplied and\ngrew very mighty.\nThen his sister said to Pharaoh's\ndaughter, \"Shall I go and call a nurse for\nyou from the Hebrew women, that she\nmay nurse the child for you?\"\nAnd so it was, because the midwives\nfeared\nGod,\nthat\nHe\nprovided\nhouseholds for them.\nAnd Pharaoh's daughter said to her,\n\"Go.\" So the maiden went and called the\nchild's mother.\nSo Pharaoh commanded all his people,\nsaying, \"Every son who is born you shall\ncast into the river, and every daughter\nyou shall save alive.\"\n2And a man of the house of Levi went\nand took as wife a daughter of Levi.\nSo the woman conceived and bore a\nson. And when she saw that he was a\nbeautiful child, she hid him three months.\nBut when she could no longer hide him,\nshe took an ark of bulrushes for him,\ndaubed it with asphalt and pitch, put the\nchild in it, and laid it in the reeds by the\nriver's bank.\nAnd his sister stood afar off, to know\nwhat would be done to him.\nThen the daughter of Pharaoh came\ndown to bathe at the river. And her\nmaidens walked along the riverside; and\nwhen she saw the ark among the reeds,\nshe sent her maid to get it.\nAnd when she opened it, she saw the\nchild, and behold, the baby wept. So\nThen Pharaoh's daughter said to her,\n\"Take this child away and nurse him for\nme, and I will give you your wages.\" So\nthe woman took the child and nursed\nhim.\nAnd the child grew, and she brought\nhim to Pharaoh's daughter, and he\nbecame her son. So she called his\nname Moses, saying, \"Because I drew\nhim out of the water.\"\nNow it came to pass in those days,\nwhen Moses was grown, that he went\nout to his brethren and looked at their\nburdens. And he saw an Egyptian\nbeating a Hebrew, one of his brethren.\nSo he looked this way and that way,\nand when he saw no one, he killed the\nEgyptian and hid him in the sand.\nAnd when he went out the second day,\nbehold, two Hebrew men were fighting,\nand he said to the one who did the\nwrong, \"Why are you striking your\ncompanion?\"\nThen he said, \"Who made you a prince\nand a judge over us? Do you intend to\nkill me as you killed the Egyptian?\" So\nMoses feared and said, \"Surely this\nthing is known!\"\nof the bondage, and they cried out; and\ntheir cry came up to God because of the\nbondage.\nWhen Pharaoh heard of this matter, he\nsought to kill Moses. But Moses fled\nfrom the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in\nthe land of Midian; and he sat down by a\nwell.\nSo God heard their groaning, and God\nremembered\nHis\ncovenant\nwith\nAbraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.\nNow the priest of Midian had seven\ndaughters. And they came and drew\nwater, and they filled the troughs to\nwater their father's flock.\nThen the shepherds came and drove\nthem away; but Moses stood up and\nhelped them, and watered their flock.\nWhen they came to Reuel their father,\nhe said, \"How is it that you have come\nso soon today?\"\nAnd they said, \"An Egyptian delivered\nus from the hand of the shepherds, and\nhe also drew enough water for us and\nwatered the flock.\"\nSo he said to his daughters, \"And\nwhere is he? Why is it that you have left\nthe man? Call him, that he may eat\nbread.\"\nThen Moses was content to live with\nthe man, and he gave Zipporah his\ndaughter to Moses.\nAnd she bore him a son. He called his\nname Gershom, for he said, \"I have\nbeen a stranger in a foreign land.\"\nNow it happened in the process of\ntime that the king of Egypt died. Then\nthe children of Israel groaned because\nAnd God looked upon the children of\nIsrael, and God acknowledged them.\n3Now Moses was tending the flock of\nJethro his father-in-law, the priest of\nMidian. And he led the flock to the back\nof the desert, and came to Horeb, the\nmountain of God.\nAnd the Angel of the LORD appeared\nto him in a flame of fire from the midst of\na bush. So he looked, and behold, the\nbush was burning with fire, but the bush\nwas not consumed.\nThen Moses said, \"I will now turn aside\nand see this great sight, why the bush\ndoes not burn.\"\nSo when the LORD saw that he turned\naside to look, God called to him from the\nmidst of the bush and said, \"Moses,\nMoses!\" And he said, \"Here I am.\"\nThen He said, \"Do not draw near this\nplace. Take your sandals off your feet,\nfor the place where you stand is holy\nground.\"\nMoreover He said, \"I am the God of\nyour father--the God of Abraham, the\nGod of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\"\nAnd Moses hid his face, for he was\nafraid to look upon God.\nAnd the LORD said: \"I have surely\nseen the oppression of My people who\nare in Egypt, and have heard their cry\nbecause of their taskmasters, for I know\ntheir sorrows.\nAnd God said to Moses, \"I AM WHO I\nAM.\" And He said, \"Thus you shall say\nto the children of Israel, \"I AM has sent\nme to you.\"'\nSo I have come down to deliver them\nout of the hand of the Egyptians, and to\nbring them up from that land to a good\nand large land, to a land flowing with\nmilk and honey, to the place of the\nCanaanites and the Hittites and the\nAmorites and the Perizzites and the\nHivites and the Jebusites.\nNow therefore, behold, the cry of the\nchildren of Israel has come to Me, and I\nhave also seen the oppression with\nwhich the Egyptians oppress them.\nMoreover God said to Moses, \"Thus\nyou shall say to the children of Israel:\n\"The LORD God of your fathers, the\nGod of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and\nthe God of Jacob, has sent me to you.\nThis is My name forever, and this is My\nmemorial to all generations.'\nGo and gather the elders of Israel\ntogether, and say to them, \"The LORD\nGod of your fathers, the God of\nAbraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,\nappeared to me, saying, \"I have surely\nvisited you and seen what is done to\nyou in Egypt;\nCome now, therefore, and I will send\nyou to Pharaoh that you may bring My\npeople, the children of Israel, out of\nEgypt.\"\nBut Moses said to God, \"Who am I that\nI should go to Pharaoh, and that I\nshould bring the children of Israel out of\nEgypt?\"\nSo He said, \"I will certainly be with you.\nAnd this shall be a sign to you that I\nhave sent you: When you have brought\nthe people out of Egypt, you shall serve\nGod on this mountain.\"\nand I have said I will bring you up out\nof the affliction of Egypt to the land of\nthe Canaanites and the Hittites and the\nAmorites and the Perizzites and the\nHivites and the Jebusites, to a land\nflowing with milk and honey.\"'\nThen they will heed your voice; and\nyou shall come, you and the elders of\nIsrael, to the king of Egypt; and you\nshall say to him, \"The LORD God of the\nHebrews has met with us; and now,\nplease, let us go three days' journey into\nthe wilderness, that we may sacrifice to\nthe LORD our God.'\nThen Moses said to God, \"Indeed,\nwhen I come to the children of Israel\nand say to them, \"The God of your\nfathers has sent me to you,' and they\nsay to me, \"What is His name?' what\nshall I say to them?\"\nBut I am sure that the king of Egypt\nwill not let you go, no, not even by a\nmighty hand.\nSo I will stretch out My hand and strike\nEgypt with all My wonders which I will\ndo in its midst; and after that he will let\nyou go.\nhe put his hand in his bosom, and when\nhe took it out, behold, his hand was\nleprous, like snow.\nAnd I will give this people favor in the\nsight of the Egyptians; and it shall be,\nwhen you go, that you shall not go\nempty-handed.\nBut every woman shall ask of her\nneighbor, namely, of her who dwells\nnear her house, articles of silver, articles\nof gold, and clothing; and you shall put\nthem on your sons and on your\ndaughters. So you shall plunder the\nEgyptians.\"\nAnd He said, \"Put your hand in your\nbosom again.\" So he put his hand in his\nbosom again, and drew it out of his\nbosom, and behold, it was restored like\nhis other flesh.\n\"Then it will be, if they do not believe\nyou, nor heed the message of the first\nsign, that they may believe the message\nof the latter sign.\n4Then Moses answered and said, \"But\nsuppose they will not believe me or\nlisten to my voice; suppose they say,\n\"The LORD has not appeared to you.\"'\nSo the LORD said to him, \"What is that\nin your hand?\" He said, \"A rod.\"\nAnd He said, \"Cast it on the ground.\"\nSo he cast it on the ground, and it\nbecame a serpent; and Moses fled from\nit.\nThen the LORD said to Moses, \"Reach\nout your hand and take it by the tail\"\n(and he reached out his hand and\ncaught it, and it became a rod in his\nhand),\n\"that they may believe that the LORD\nGod of their fathers, the God of\nAbraham, the God of Isaac, and the\nGod of Jacob, has appeared to you.\"\nFurthermore the LORD said to him,\n\"Now put your hand in your bosom.\" And\nAnd it shall be, if they do not believe\neven these two signs, or listen to your\nvoice, that you shall take water from the\nriver and pour it on the dry land. The\nwater which you take from the river will\nbecome blood on the dry land.\"\nThen Moses said to the LORD, \"O my\nLord, I am not eloquent, neither before\nnor since You have spoken to Your\nservant; but I am slow of speech and\nslow of tongue.\"\nSo the LORD said to him, \"Who has\nmade man's mouth? Or who makes the\nmute, the deaf, the seeing, or the blind?\nHave not I, the LORD?\nNow therefore, go, and I will be with\nyour mouth and teach you what you\nshall say.\"\nBut he said, \"O my Lord, please send\nby the hand of whomever else You may\nsend.\"\nSo the anger of the LORD was kindled\nagainst Moses, and He said: \"Is not\nAaron the Levite your brother? I know\nthat he can speak well. And look, he is\nalso coming out to meet you. When he\nsees you, he will be glad in his heart.\nThen you shall say to Pharaoh, \"Thus\nsays the LORD: \"Israel is My son, My\nfirstborn.\nNow you shall speak to him and put\nthe words in his mouth. And I will be\nwith your mouth and with his mouth, and\nI will teach you what you shall do.\nSo I say to you, let My son go that he\nmay serve Me. But if you refuse to let\nhim go, indeed I will kill your son, your\nfirstborn.\"\"'\nSo he shall be your spokesman to the\npeople. And he himself shall be as a\nmouth for you, and you shall be to him\nas God.\nAnd it came to pass on the way, at the\nencampment, that the LORD met him\nand sought to kill him.\nAnd you shall take this rod in your\nhand, with which you shall do the signs.\"\nThen Zipporah took a sharp stone and\ncut off the foreskin of her son and cast it\nat Moses' feet, and said, \"Surely you are\na husband of blood to me!\"\nSo Moses went and returned to Jethro\nhis father-in-law, and said to him,\n\"Please let me go and return to my\nbrethren who are in Egypt, and see\nwhether they are still alive.\" And Jethro\nsaid to Moses, \"Go in peace.\"\nNow the LORD said to Moses in\nMidian, \"Go, return to Egypt; for all the\nmen who sought your life are dead.\"\nThen Moses took his wife and his sons\nand set them on a donkey, and he\nreturned to the land of Egypt. And\nMoses took the rod of God in his hand.\nAnd the LORD said to Moses, \"When\nyou go back to Egypt, see that you do\nall those wonders before Pharaoh which\nI have put in your hand. But I will harden\nhis heart, so that he will not let the\npeople go.\nSo He let him go. Then she said, \"You\nare a husband of blood!\"--because of\nthe circumcision.\nAnd the LORD said to Aaron, \"Go into\nthe wilderness to meet Moses.\" So he\nwent and met him on the mountain of\nGod, and kissed him.\nSo Moses told Aaron all the words of\nthe LORD who had sent him, and all the\nsigns which He had commanded him.\nThen Moses and Aaron went and\ngathered together all the elders of the\nchildren of Israel.\nAnd Aaron spoke all the words which\nthe LORD had spoken to Moses. Then\nhe did the signs in the sight of the\npeople.\nSo the people believed; and when they\nheard that the LORD had visited the\nchildren of Israel and that He had looked\non their affliction, then they bowed their\nheads and worshiped.\ntherefore they cry out, saying, \"Let us go\nand sacrifice to our God.'\n5Afterward Moses and Aaron went in\nand told Pharaoh, \"Thus says the LORD\nGod of Israel: \"Let My people go, that\nthey may hold a feast to Me in the\nwilderness.\"'\nAnd Pharaoh said, \"Who is the LORD,\nthat I should obey His voice to let Israel\ngo? I do not know the LORD, nor will I\nlet Israel go.\"\nLet more work be laid on the men, that\nthey may labor in it, and let them not\nregard false words.\"\nAnd the taskmasters of the people and\ntheir officers went out and spoke to the\npeople, saying, \"Thus says Pharaoh: \"I\nwill not give you straw.\nGo, get yourselves straw where you\ncan find it; yet none of your work will be\nreduced.\"'\nSo they said, \"The God of the Hebrews\nhas met with us. Please, let us go three\ndays' journey into the desert and\nsacrifice to the LORD our God, lest He\nfall upon us with pestilence or with the\nsword.\"\nThen the king of Egypt said to them,\n\"Moses and Aaron, why do you take the\npeople from their work? Get back to\nyour labor.\"\nSo the people were scattered abroad\nthroughout all the land of Egypt to\ngather stubble instead of straw.\nAnd the taskmasters forced them to\nhurry, saying, \"Fulfill your work, your\ndaily quota, as when there was straw.\"\nAnd Pharaoh said, \"Look, the people of\nthe land are many now, and you make\nthem rest from their labor!\"\nAlso the officers of the children of\nIsrael, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters\nhad set over them, were beaten and\nwere asked, \"Why have you not fulfilled\nyour task in making brick both yesterday\nand today, as before?\"\nSo the same day Pharaoh commanded\nthe taskmasters of the people and their\nofficers, saying,\nThen the officers of the children of\nIsrael came and cried out to Pharaoh,\nsaying, \"Why are you dealing thus with\nyour servants?\n\"You shall no longer give the people\nstraw to make brick as before. Let them\ngo and gather straw for themselves.\nAnd you shall lay on them the quota of\nbricks which they made before. You\nshall not reduce it. For they are idle;\nThere is no straw given to your\nservants, and they say to us, \"Make\nbrick!' And indeed your servants are\nbeaten, but the fault is in your own\npeople.\"\nBut he said, \"You are idle! Idle!\nTherefore you say, \"Let us go and\nsacrifice to the LORD.'\nI appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to\nJacob, as God Almighty, but by My\nname LORD I was not known to them.\nTherefore go now and work; for no\nstraw shall be given you, yet you shall\ndeliver the quota of bricks.\"\nI have also established My covenant\nwith them, to give them the land of\nCanaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in\nwhich they were strangers.\nAnd the officers of the children of\nIsrael saw that they were in trouble after\nit was said, \"You shall not reduce any\nbricks from your daily quota.\"\nAnd I have also heard the groaning of\nthe children of Israel whom the\nEgyptians keep in bondage, and I have\nremembered My covenant.\nThen, as they came out from Pharaoh,\nthey met Moses and Aaron who stood\nthere to meet them.\nAnd they said to them, \"Let the LORD\nlook on you and judge, because you\nhave made us abhorrent in the sight of\nPharaoh and in the sight of his servants,\nto put a sword in their hand to kill us.\"\nSo Moses returned to the LORD and\nsaid, \"Lord, why have You brought\ntrouble on this people? Why is it You\nhave sent me?\nFor since I came to Pharaoh to speak\nin Your name, he has done evil to this\npeople; neither have You delivered Your\npeople at all.\"\n6Then the LORD said to Moses, \"Now\nyou shall see what I will do to Pharaoh.\nFor with a strong hand he will let them\ngo, and with a strong hand he will drive\nthem out of his land.\"\nAnd God spoke to Moses and said to\nhim: \"I am the LORD.\nTherefore say to the children of Israel:\n\"I am the LORD; I will bring you out from\nunder the burdens of the Egyptians, I\nwill rescue you from their bondage, and\nI will redeem you with an outstretched\narm and with great judgments.\nI will take you as My people, and I will\nbe your God. Then you shall know that I\nam the LORD your God who brings you\nout from under the burdens of the\nEgyptians.\nAnd I will bring you into the land which I\nswore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and\nJacob; and I will give it to you as a\nheritage: I am the LORD.\"'\nSo Moses spoke thus to the children of\nIsrael; but they did not heed Moses,\nbecause of anguish of spirit and cruel\nbondage.\nAnd the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n\"Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let\nthe children of Israel go out of his land.\"\nAnd Moses spoke before the LORD,\nsaying, \"The children of Israel have not\nheeded me. How then shall Pharaoh\nheed me, for I am of uncircumcised\nlips?\"\nThen the LORD spoke to Moses and\nAaron, and gave them a command for\nthe children of Israel and for Pharaoh\nking of Egypt, to bring the children of\nIsrael out of the land of Egypt.\nThese are the heads of their fathers'\nhouses: The sons of Reuben, the\nfirstborn of Israel, were Hanoch, Pallu,\nHezron, and Carmi. These are the\nfamilies of Reuben.\nAnd the sons of Simeon were Jemuel,\nJamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul\nthe son of a Canaanite woman. These\nare the families of Simeon.\nThese are the names of the sons of\nLevi according to their generations:\nGershon, Kohath, and Merari. And the\nyears of the life of Levi were one\nhundred and thirty-seven.\nThe sons of Gershon were Libni and\nShimi according to their families.\nAnd the sons of Kohath were Amram,\nIzhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. And the\nyears of the life of Kohath were one\nhundred and thirty-three.\nThe sons of Merari were Mahli and\nMushi. These are the families of Levi\naccording to their generations.\nNow Amram took for himself Jochebed,\nhis father's sister, as wife; and she bore\nhim Aaron and Moses. And the years of\nthe life of Amram were one hundred and\nthirty-seven.\nThe sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg,\nand Zichri.\nAnd the sons of Uzziel were Mishael,\nElzaphan, and Zithri.\nAaron took to himself Elisheba,\ndaughter of Amminadab, sister of\nNahshon, as wife; and she bore him\nNadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.\nAnd the sons of Korah were Assir,\nElkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the\nfamilies of the Korahites.\nEleazar, Aaron's son, took for himself\none of the daughters of Putiel as wife;\nand she bore him Phinehas. These are\nthe heads of the fathers' houses of the\nLevites according to their families.\nThese are the same Aaron and Moses\nto whom the LORD said, \"Bring out the\nchildren of Israel from the land of Egypt\naccording to their armies.\"\nThese are the ones who spoke to\nPharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the\nchildren of Israel from Egypt. These are\nthe same Moses and Aaron.\nAnd it came to pass, on the day the\nLORD spoke to Moses in the land of\nEgypt,\nthat the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n\"I am the LORD. Speak to Pharaoh king\nof Egypt all that I say to you.\"\nBut Moses said before the LORD,\n\"Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and\nhow shall Pharaoh heed me?\"\nand cast it before Pharaoh, and let it\nbecome a serpent.\"'\n7So the LORD said to Moses: \"See, I\nhave made you as God to Pharaoh, and\nAaron your brother shall be your prophet.\nYou shall speak all that I command you.\nAnd Aaron your brother shall tell\nPharaoh to send the children of Israel\nout of his land.\nAnd I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and\nmultiply My signs and My wonders in the\nland of Egypt.\nBut Pharaoh will not heed you, so that I\nmay lay My hand on Egypt and bring My\narmies and My people, the children of\nIsrael, out of the land of Egypt by great\njudgments.\nAnd the Egyptians shall know that I am\nthe LORD, when I stretch out My hand\non Egypt and bring out the children of\nIsrael from among them.\"\nThen Moses and Aaron did so; just as\nthe LORD commanded them, so they\ndid.\nAnd Moses was eighty years old and\nAaron eighty-three years old when they\nspoke to Pharaoh.\nThen the LORD spoke to Moses and\nAaron, saying,\n\"When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying,\n\"Show a miracle for yourselves,' then\nyou shall say to Aaron, \"Take your rod\nSo Moses and Aaron went in to\nPharaoh, and they did so, just as the\nLORD commanded. And Aaron cast\ndown his rod before Pharaoh and before\nhis servants, and it became a serpent.\nBut Pharaoh also called the wise men\nand the sorcerers; so the magicians of\nEgypt, they also did in like manner with\ntheir enchantments.\nFor every man threw down his rod,\nand they became serpents. But Aaron's\nrod swallowed up their rods.\nAnd Pharaoh's heart grew hard, and\nhe did not heed them, as the LORD had\nsaid.\nSo the LORD said to Moses:\n\"Pharaoh's heart is hard; he refuses to\nlet the people go.\nGo to Pharaoh in the morning, when\nhe goes out to the water, and you shall\nstand by the river's bank to meet him;\nand the rod which was turned to a\nserpent you shall take in your hand.\nAnd you shall say to him, \"The LORD\nGod of the Hebrews has sent me to you,\nsaying, \"Let My people go, that they\nmay serve Me in the wilderness\"; but\nindeed, until now you would not hear!\nThus says the LORD: \"By this you\nshall know that I am the LORD. Behold,\nI will strike the waters which are in the\nriver with the rod that is in my hand, and\nthey shall be turned to blood.\nAnd the fish that are in the river shall\ndie, the river shall stink, and the\nEgyptians will loathe to drink the water\nof the river.\"\"'\nThen the LORD spoke to Moses, \"Say\nto Aaron, \"Take your rod and stretch out\nyour hand over the waters of Egypt,\nover their streams, over their rivers, over\ntheir ponds, and over all their pools of\nwater, that they may become blood. And\nthere shall be blood throughout all the\nland of Egypt, both in buckets of wood\nand pitchers of stone.\"'\nAnd Moses and Aaron did so, just as\nthe LORD commanded. So he lifted up\nthe rod and struck the waters that were\nin the river, in the sight of Pharaoh and\nin the sight of his servants. And all the\nwaters that were in the river were turned\nto blood.\nThe fish that were in the river died, the\nriver stank, and the Egyptians could not\ndrink the water of the river. So there was\nblood throughout all the land of Egypt.\nThen the magicians of Egypt did so\nwith their enchantments; and Pharaoh's\nheart grew hard, and he did not heed\nthem, as the LORD had said.\n8And the LORD spoke to Moses, \"Go\nto Pharaoh and say to him, \"Thus says\nthe LORD: \"Let My people go, that they\nmay serve Me.\nBut if you refuse to let them go, behold,\nI will smite all your territory with frogs.\nSo the river shall bring forth frogs\nabundantly, which shall go up and come\ninto your house, into your bedroom, on\nyour bed, into the houses of your\nservants, on your people, into your\novens, and into your kneading bowls.\nAnd the frogs shall come up on you, on\nyour people, and on all your servants.\"\"'\nThen the LORD spoke to Moses, \"Say\nto Aaron, \"Stretch out your hand with\nyour rod over the streams, over the\nrivers, and over the ponds, and cause\nfrogs to come up on the land of Egypt.\"'\nSo Aaron stretched out his hand over\nthe waters of Egypt, and the frogs came\nup and covered the land of Egypt.\nAnd the magicians did so with their\nenchantments, and brought up frogs on\nthe land of Egypt.\nAnd Pharaoh turned and went into his\nhouse. Neither was his heart moved by\nthis.\nSo all the Egyptians dug all around the\nriver for water to drink, because they\ncould not drink the water of the river.\nAnd seven days passed after the\nLORD had struck the river.\nThen Pharaoh called for Moses and\nAaron, and said, \"Entreat the LORD that\nHe may take away the frogs from me\nand from my people; and I will let the\npeople go, that they may sacrifice to the\nLORD.\"\nAnd Moses said to Pharaoh, \"Accept\nthe honor of saying when I shall\nintercede for you, for your servants, and\nfor your people, to destroy the frogs\nfrom you and your houses, that they\nmay remain in the river only.\"\nNow the magicians so worked with\ntheir enchantments to bring forth lice,\nbut they could not. So there were lice on\nman and beast.\nSo he said, \"Tomorrow.\" And he said,\n\"Let it be according to your word, that\nyou may know that there is no one like\nthe LORD our God.\nAnd the frogs shall depart from you,\nfrom your houses, from your servants,\nand from your people. They shall remain\nin the river only.\"\nThen Moses and Aaron went out from\nPharaoh. And Moses cried out to the\nLORD concerning the frogs which He\nhad brought against Pharaoh.\nSo the LORD did according to the\nword of Moses. And the frogs died out of\nthe houses, out of the courtyards, and\nout of the fields.\nThen the magicians said to Pharaoh,\n\"This is the finger of God.\" But\nPharaoh's heart grew hard, and he did\nnot heed them, just as the LORD had\nsaid.\nAnd the LORD said to Moses, \"Rise\nearly in the morning and stand before\nPharaoh as he comes out to the water.\nThen say to him, \"Thus says the LORD:\n\"Let My people go, that they may serve\nMe.\nOr else, if you will not let My people go,\nbehold, I will send swarms of flies on\nyou and your servants, on your people\nand into your houses. The houses of the\nEgyptians shall be full of swarms of flies,\nand also the ground on which they stand.\nThey gathered them together in heaps,\nand the land stank.\nBut when Pharaoh saw that there was\nrelief, he hardened his heart and did not\nheed them, as the LORD had said.\nSo the LORD said to Moses, \"Say to\nAaron, \"Stretch out your rod, and strike\nthe dust of the land, so that it may\nbecome lice throughout all the land of\nEgypt.\"'\nAnd they did so. For Aaron stretched\nout his hand with his rod and struck the\ndust of the earth, and it became lice on\nman and beast. All the dust of the land\nbecame lice throughout all the land of\nEgypt.\nAnd in that day I will set apart the land\nof Goshen, in which My people dwell,\nthat no swarms of flies shall be there, in\norder that you may know that I am the\nLORD in the midst of the land.\nI will make a difference between My\npeople and your people. Tomorrow this\nsign shall be.\"\"'\nAnd the LORD did so. Thick swarms of\nflies came into the house of Pharaoh,\ninto his servants' houses, and into all the\nland of Egypt. The land was corrupted\nbecause of the swarms of flies.\nThen Pharaoh called for Moses and\nAaron, and said, \"Go, sacrifice to your\nGod in the land.\"\nAnd Moses said, \"It is not right to do\nso, for we would be sacrificing the\nabomination of the Egyptians to the\nLORD our God. If we sacrifice the\nabomination of the Egyptians before\ntheir eyes, then will they not stone us?\nWe will go three days' journey into the\nwilderness and sacrifice to the LORD\nour God as He will command us.\"\nSo Pharaoh said, \"I will let you go, that\nyou may sacrifice to the LORD your God\nin the wilderness; only you shall not go\nvery far away. Intercede for me.\"\nThen Moses said, \"Indeed I am going\nout from you, and I will entreat the\nLORD, that the swarms of flies may\ndepart tomorrow from Pharaoh, from his\nservants, and from his people. But let\nPharaoh not deal deceitfully anymore in\nnot letting the people go to sacrifice to\nthe LORD.\"\nSo Moses went out from Pharaoh and\nentreated the LORD.\nAnd the LORD did according to the\nword of Moses; He removed the swarms\nof flies from Pharaoh, from his servants,\nand from his people. Not one remained.\nBut Pharaoh hardened his heart at this\ntime also; neither would he let the\npeople go.\n9Then the LORD said to Moses, \"Go\nin to Pharaoh and tell him, \"Thus says\nthe LORD God of the Hebrews: \"Let My\npeople go, that they may serve Me.\nFor if you refuse to let them go, and still\nhold them,\nbehold, the hand of the LORD will be\non your cattle in the field, on the horses,\non the donkeys, on the camels, on the\noxen, and on the sheep--a very severe\npestilence.\nAnd the LORD will make a difference\nbetween the livestock of Israel and the\nlivestock of Egypt. So nothing shall die\nof all that belongs to the children of\nIsrael.\"\"'\nThen the LORD appointed a set time,\nsaying, \"Tomorrow the LORD will do this\nthing in the land.\"\nSo the LORD did this thing on the next\nday, and all the livestock of Egypt died;\nbut of the livestock of the children of\nIsrael, not one died.\nThen Pharaoh sent, and indeed, not\neven one of the livestock of the\nIsraelites was dead. But the heart of\nPharaoh became hard, and he did not\nlet the people go.\nSo the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,\n\"Take for yourselves handfuls of ashes\nfrom a furnace, and let Moses scatter it\ntoward the heavens in the sight of\nPharaoh.\nAnd it will become fine dust in all the\nland of Egypt, and it will cause boils that\nbreak out in sores on man and beast\nthroughout all the land of Egypt.\"\nThen they took ashes from the furnace\nand stood before Pharaoh, and Moses\nscattered them toward heaven. And they\ncaused boils that break out in sores on\nman and beast.\nAnd the magicians could not stand\nbefore Moses because of the boils, for\nthe boils were on the magicians and on\nall the Egyptians.\nAs yet you exalt yourself against My\npeople in that you will not let them go.\nBehold, tomorrow about this time I will\ncause very heavy hail to rain down,\nsuch as has not been in Egypt since its\nfounding until now.\nTherefore send now and gather your\nlivestock and all that you have in the\nfield, for the hail shall come down on\nevery man and every animal which is\nfound in the field and is not brought\nhome; and they shall die.\"\"'\nBut the LORD hardened the heart of\nPharaoh; and he did not heed them, just\nas the LORD had spoken to Moses.\nHe who feared the word of the LORD\namong the servants of Pharaoh made\nhis servants and his livestock flee to the\nhouses.\nThen the LORD said to Moses, \"Rise\nearly in the morning and stand before\nPharaoh, and say to him, \"Thus says the\nLORD God of the Hebrews: \"Let My\npeople go, that they may serve Me,\nfor at this time I will send all My\nplagues to your very heart, and on your\nservants and on your people, that you\nmay know that there is none like Me in\nall the earth.\nBut he who did not regard the word of\nthe LORD left his servants and his\nlivestock in the field.\nThen the LORD said to Moses,\n\"Stretch out your hand toward heaven,\nthat there may be hail in all the land of\nEgypt--on man, on beast, and on every\nherb of the field, throughout the land of\nEgypt.\"\nNow if I had stretched out My hand\nand struck you and your people with\npestilence, then you would have been\ncut off from the earth.\nAnd Moses stretched out his rod\ntoward heaven; and the LORD sent\nthunder and hail, and fire darted to the\nground. And the LORD rained hail on\nthe land of Egypt.\nBut indeed for this purpose I have\nraised you up, that I may show My\npower in you, and that My name may be\ndeclared in all the earth.\nSo there was hail, and fire mingled\nwith the hail, so very heavy that there\nwas none like it in all the land of Egypt\nsince it became a nation.\nAnd the hail struck throughout the\nwhole land of Egypt, all that was in the\nfield, both man and beast; and the hail\nstruck every herb of the field and broke\nevery tree of the field.\nAnd when Pharaoh saw that the rain,\nthe hail, and the thunder had ceased, he\nsinned yet more; and he hardened his\nheart, he and his servants.\nOnly in the land of Goshen, where the\nchildren of Israel were, there was no hail.\nAnd Pharaoh sent and called for\nMoses and Aaron, and said to them, \"I\nhave sinned this time. The LORD is\nrighteous, and my people and I are\nwicked.\nEntreat the LORD, that there may be\nno more mighty thundering and hail, for\nit is enough. I will let you go, and you\nshall stay no longer.\"\nSo Moses said to him, \"As soon as I\nhave gone out of the city, I will spread\nout my hands to the LORD; the thunder\nwill cease, and there will be no more hail,\nthat you may know that the earth is the\nLORD's.\nBut as for you and your servants, I\nknow that you will not yet fear the LORD\nGod.\"\nNow the flax and the barley were\nstruck, for the barley was in the head\nand the flax was in bud.\nBut the wheat and the spelt were not\nstruck, for they are late crops.\nSo Moses went out of the city from\nPharaoh and spread out his hands to\nthe LORD; then the thunder and the hail\nceased, and the rain was not poured on\nthe earth.\nSo the heart of Pharaoh was hard;\nneither would he let the children of Israel\ngo, as the LORD had spoken by Moses.\n10Now the LORD said to Moses,\n\"Go in to Pharaoh; for I have hardened\nhis heart and the hearts of his servants,\nthat I may show these signs of Mine\nbefore him,\nand that you may tell in the hearing of\nyour son and your son's son the mighty\nthings I have done in Egypt, and My\nsigns which I have done among them,\nthat you may know that I am the LORD.\"\nSo Moses and Aaron came in to\nPharaoh and said to him, \"Thus says the\nLORD God of the Hebrews: \"How long\nwill you refuse to humble yourself before\nMe? Let My people go, that they may\nserve Me.\nOr else, if you refuse to let My people\ngo, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts\ninto your territory.\nAnd they shall cover the face of the\nearth, so that no one will be able to see\nthe earth; and they shall eat the residue\nof what is left, which remains to you\nfrom the hail, and they shall eat every\ntree which grows up for you out of the\nfield.\nThey shall fill your houses, the houses\nof all your servants, and the houses of\nall the Egyptians--which neither your\nfathers nor your fathers' fathers have\nseen, since the day that they were on\nthe earth to this day.\"' And he turned\nand went out from Pharaoh.\nThen Pharaoh's servants said to him,\n\"How long shall this man be a snare to\nus? Let the men go, that they may serve\nthe LORD their God. Do you not yet\nknow that Egypt is destroyed?\"\nday and all that night. When it was\nmorning, the east wind brought the\nlocusts.\nAnd the locusts went up over all the\nland of Egypt and rested on all the\nterritory of Egypt. They were very\nsevere; previously there had been no\nsuch locusts as they, nor shall there be\nsuch after them.\nSo Moses and Aaron were brought\nagain to Pharaoh, and he said to them,\n\"Go, serve the LORD your God. Who\nare the ones that are going?\"\nAnd Moses said, \"We will go with our\nyoung and our old; with our sons and\nour daughters, with our flocks and our\nherds we will go, for we must hold a\nfeast to the LORD.\"\nFor they covered the face of the whole\nearth, so that the land was darkened;\nand they ate every herb of the land and\nall the fruit of the trees which the hail\nhad left. So there remained nothing\ngreen on the trees or on the plants of\nthe field throughout all the land of Egypt.\nThen Pharaoh called for Moses and\nAaron in haste, and said, \"I have sinned\nagainst the LORD your God and against\nyou.\nThen he said to them, \"The LORD had\nbetter be with you when I let you and\nyour little ones go! Beware, for evil is\nahead of you.\nNow therefore, please forgive my sin\nonly this once, and entreat the LORD\nyour God, that He may take away from\nme this death only.\"\nNot so! Go now, you who are men,\nand serve the LORD, for that is what\nyou desired.\" And they were driven out\nfrom Pharaoh's presence.\nSo he went out from Pharaoh and\nentreated the LORD.\nThen the LORD said to Moses,\n\"Stretch out your hand over the land of\nEgypt for the locusts, that they may\ncome upon the land of Egypt, and eat\nevery herb of the land--all that the hail\nhas left.\"\nSo Moses stretched out his rod over\nthe land of Egypt, and the LORD\nbrought an east wind on the land all that\nAnd the LORD turned a very strong\nwest wind, which took the locusts away\nand blew them into the Red Sea. There\nremained not one locust in all the\nterritory of Egypt.\nBut the LORD hardened Pharaoh's\nheart, and he did not let the children of\nIsrael go.\nThen the LORD said to Moses,\n\"Stretch out your hand toward heaven,\nthat there may be darkness over the\nland of Egypt, darkness which may even\nbe felt.\"\nSo Moses stretched out his hand\ntoward heaven, and there was thick\ndarkness in all the land of Egypt three\ndays.\nThey did not see one another; nor did\nanyone rise from his place for three\ndays. But all the children of Israel had\nlight in their dwellings.\nThen Pharaoh called to Moses and\nsaid, \"Go, serve the LORD; only let your\nflocks and your herds be kept back. Let\nyour little ones also go with you.\"\nBut Moses said, \"You must also give\nus sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we\nmay sacrifice to the LORD our God.\nOur livestock also shall go with us; not\na hoof shall be left behind. For we must\ntake some of them to serve the LORD\nour God, and even we do not know with\nwhat we must serve the LORD until we\narrive there.\"\n11And the LORD said to Moses, \"I\nwill bring one more plague on Pharaoh\nand on Egypt. Afterward he will let you\ngo from here. When he lets you go, he\nwill surely drive you out of here\naltogether.\nSpeak now in the hearing of the people,\nand let every man ask from his neighbor\nand every woman from her neighbor,\narticles of silver and articles of gold.\"\nAnd the LORD gave the people favor in\nthe sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the\nman Moses was very great in the land of\nEgypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants\nand in the sight of the people.\nThen Moses said, \"Thus says the\nLORD: \"About midnight I will go out into\nthe midst of Egypt;\nand all the firstborn in the land of Egypt\nshall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh\nwho sits on his throne, even to the\nfirstborn of the female servant who is\nbehind the handmill, and all the firstborn\nof the animals.\nBut the LORD hardened Pharaoh's\nheart, and he would not let them go.\nThen there shall be a great cry\nthroughout all the land of Egypt, such as\nwas not like it before, nor shall be like it\nagain.\nThen Pharaoh said to him, \"Get away\nfrom me! Take heed to yourself and see\nmy face no more! For in the day you see\nmy face you shall die!\"\nSo Moses said, \"You have spoken well.\nI will never see your face again.\"\nBut against none of the children of\nIsrael shall a dog move its tongue,\nagainst man or beast, that you may\nknow that the LORD does make a\ndifference between the Egyptians and\nIsrael.'\nAnd all these your servants shall come\ndown to me and bow down to me,\nsaying, \"Get out, and all the people who\nfollow you!' After that I will go out.\" Then\nhe went out from Pharaoh in great anger.\nBut the LORD said to Moses, \"Pharaoh\nwill not heed you, so that My wonders\nmay be multiplied in the land of Egypt.\"\nSo Moses and Aaron did all these\nwonders before Pharaoh; and the LORD\nhardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did\nnot let the children of Israel go out of his\nland.\n12Now the LORD spoke to Moses\nthe whole assembly of the congregation\nof Israel shall kill it at twilight.\nAnd they shall take some of the blood\nand put it on the two doorposts and on\nthe lintel of the houses where they eat it.\nThen they shall eat the flesh on that\nnight; roasted in fire, with unleavened\nbread and with bitter herbs they shall\neat it.\nDo not eat it raw, nor boiled at all with\nwater, but roasted in fire--its head with\nits legs and its entrails.\nand Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,\nYou shall let none of it remain until\nmorning, and what remains of it until\nmorning you shall burn with fire.\n\"This month shall be your beginning of\nmonths; it shall be the first month of the\nyear to you.\nAnd thus you shall eat it: with a belt on\nyour waist, your sandals on your feet,\nand your staff in your hand.

It is the LORD's Passover.\nSpeak to all the congregation of Israel,\nsaying: \"On the tenth of this month\nevery man shall take for himself a lamb,\naccording to the house of his father, a\nlamb for a household.\nAnd if the household is too small for the\nlamb, let him and his neighbor next to\nhis house take it according to the\nnumber of the persons; according to\neach man's need you shall make your\ncount for the lamb.\nYour lamb shall be without blemish, a\nmale of the first year.

On the first day you shall remove\nleaven from your houses. For whoever\neats leavened bread from the first day\nuntil the seventh day, that person shall\nbe cut off from Israel.\nAnd you shall take a bunch of hyssop,\ndip it in the blood that is in the basin,\nand strike the lintel and the two\ndoorposts with the blood that is in the\nbasin.

No\nleavened bread shall be eaten.\nIn one house it shall be eaten; you\nshall not carry any of the flesh outside\nthe house, nor shall you break one of its\nbones.\nOn this day you are going out, in the\nmonth Abib.\nAll the congregation of Israel shall\nkeep it.\nAnd when a stranger dwells with you\nand wants to keep the Passover to the\nLORD, let all his males be circumcised,\nand then let him come near and keep it;\nand he shall be as a native of the land.\nFor no uncircumcised person shall eat it.\nAnd it shall be, when the LORD brings\nyou into the land of the Canaanites and\nthe Hittites and the Amorites and the\nHivites and the Jebusites, which He\nswore to your fathers to give you, a land\nflowing with milk and honey, that you\nshall keep this service in this month.\nSeven days you shall eat unleavened\nbread, and on the seventh day there\nshall be a feast to the LORD.\nOne law shall be for the native-born\nand for the stranger who dwells among\nyou.\"\nThus all the children of Israel did; as\nthe LORD commanded Moses and\nAaron, so they did.\nAnd it came to pass, on that very\nsame day, that the LORD brought the\nchildren of Israel out of the land of Egypt\naccording to their armies.\n13Then the LORD spoke to Moses,\nsaying,\n\"Consecrate to Me all the firstborn,\nwhatever opens the womb among the\nchildren of Israel, both of man and\nbeast; it is Mine.\"\nAnd Moses said to the people:\n\"Remember this day in which you went\nout of Egypt, out of the house of\nUnleavened bread shall be eaten seven\ndays. And no leavened bread shall be\nseen among you, nor shall leaven be\nseen among you in all your quarters.\nAnd you shall tell your son in that day,\nsaying, \"This is done because of what\nthe LORD did for me when I came up\nfrom Egypt.'\nIt shall be as a sign to you on your\nhand and as a memorial between your\neyes, that the LORD's law may be in\nyour mouth; for with a strong hand the\nLORD has brought you out of Egypt.\nYou shall therefore keep this\nordinance in its season from year to\nyear.\n\"And it shall be, when the LORD\nbrings you into the land of the\nCanaanites, as He swore to you and\nyour fathers, and gives it to you,\nthat you shall set apart to the LORD all\nthat open the womb, that is, every\nfirstborn that comes from an animal\nwhich you have; the males shall be the\nLORD's.\nAnd Moses took the bones of Joseph\nwith him, for he had placed the children\nof Israel under solemn oath, saying,\n\"God will surely visit you, and you shall\ncarry up my bones from here with you.\"\nBut every firstborn of a donkey you\nshall redeem with a lamb; and if you will\nnot redeem it, then you shall break its\nneck. And all the firstborn of man among\nyour sons you shall redeem.\nSo it shall be, when your son asks you\nin time to come, saying, \"What is this?'\nthat you shall say to him, \"By strength of\nhand the LORD brought us out of Egypt,\nout of the house of bondage.\nAnd it came to pass, when Pharaoh\nwas stubborn about letting us go, that\nthe LORD killed all the firstborn in the\nland of Egypt, both the firstborn of man\nand the firstborn of beast. Therefore I\nsacrifice to the LORD all males that\nopen the womb, but all the firstborn of\nmy sons I redeem.'\nIt shall be as a sign on your hand and\nas frontlets between your eyes, for by\nstrength of hand the LORD brought us\nout of Egypt.\"\nThen it came to pass, when Pharaoh\nhad let the people go, that God did not\nlead them by way of the land of the\nPhilistines, although that was near; for\nGod said, \"Lest perhaps the people\nchange their minds when they see war,\nand return to Egypt.\"\nSo God led the people around by way\nof the wilderness of the Red Sea. And\nthe children of Israel went up in orderly\nranks out of the land of Egypt.\nSo they took their journey from\nSuccoth and camped in Etham at the\nedge of the wilderness.\nAnd the LORD went before them by\nday in a pillar of cloud to lead the way,\nand by night in a pillar of fire to give\nthem light, so as to go by day and night.\nHe did not take away the pillar of cloud\nby day or the pillar of fire by night from\nbefore the people.\n14Now the LORD spoke to Moses,\nsaying:\n\"Speak to the children of Israel, that\nthey turn and camp before Pi Hahiroth,\nbetween Migdol and the sea, opposite\nBaal Zephon; you shall camp before it\nby the sea.\nFor Pharaoh will say of the children of\nIsrael, \"They are bewildered by the land;\nthe wilderness has closed them in.'\nThen I will harden Pharaoh's heart, so\nthat he will pursue them; and I will gain\nhonor over Pharaoh and over all his\narmy, that the Egyptians may know that\nI am the LORD.\" And they did so.\nNow it was told the king of Egypt that\nthe people had fled, and the heart of\nPharaoh and his servants was turned\nagainst the people; and they said, \"Why\nhave we done this, that we have let\nIsrael go from serving us?\"\naccomplish for you today. For the\nEgyptians whom you see today, you\nshall see again no more forever.\nSo he made ready his chariot and took\nhis people with him.\nThe LORD will fight for you, and you\nshall hold your peace.\"\nAlso, he took six hundred choice\nchariots, and all the chariots of Egypt\nwith captains over every one of them.\nAnd the LORD said to Moses, \"Why do\nyou cry to Me? Tell the children of Israel\nto go forward.\nAnd the LORD hardened the heart of\nPharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued\nthe children of Israel; and the children of\nIsrael went out with boldness.\nBut lift up your rod, and stretch out\nyour hand over the sea and divide it.\nAnd the children of Israel shall go on dry\nground through the midst of the sea.\nSo the Egyptians pursued them, all the\nhorses and chariots of Pharaoh, his\nhorsemen and his army, and overtook\nthem camping by the sea beside Pi\nHahiroth, before Baal Zephon.\nAnd I indeed will harden the hearts of\nthe Egyptians, and they shall follow\nthem. So I will gain honor over Pharaoh\nand over all his army, his chariots, and\nhis horsemen.\nAnd when Pharaoh drew near, the\nchildren of Israel lifted their eyes, and\nbehold, the Egyptians marched after\nthem. So they were very afraid, and the\nchildren of Israel cried out to the LORD.\nThen the Egyptians shall know that I\nam the LORD, when I have gained\nhonor for Myself over Pharaoh, his\nchariots, and his horsemen.\"\nThen they said to Moses, \"Because\nthere were no graves in Egypt, have you\ntaken us away to die in the wilderness?\nWhy have you so dealt with us, to bring\nus up out of Egypt?\nAnd the Angel of God, who went\nbefore the camp of Israel, moved and\nwent behind them; and the pillar of cloud\nwent from before them and stood behind\nthem.\nIs this not the word that we told you in\nEgypt, saying, \"Let us alone that we\nmay serve the Egyptians'? For it would\nhave been better for us to serve the\nEgyptians than that we should die in the\nwilderness.\"\nSo it came between the camp of the\nEgyptians and the camp of Israel. Thus\nit was a cloud and darkness to the one,\nand it gave light by night to the other, so\nthat the one did not come near the other\nall that night.\nAnd Moses said to the people, \"Do not\nbe afraid. Stand still, and see the\nsalvation of the LORD, which He will\nThen Moses stretched out his hand\nover the sea; and the LORD caused the\nsea to go back by a strong east wind all\nthat night, and made the sea into dry\nland, and the waters were divided.\nSo the children of Israel went into the\nmidst of the sea on the dry ground, and\nthe waters were a wall to them on their\nright hand and on their left.\nAnd the Egyptians pursued and went\nafter them into the midst of the sea, all\nPharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his\nhorsemen.\nNow it came to pass, in the morning\nwatch, that the LORD looked down upon\nthe army of the Egyptians through the\npillar of fire and cloud, and He troubled\nthe army of the Egyptians.\nAnd He took off their chariot wheels,\nso that they drove them with difficulty;\nand the Egyptians said, \"Let us flee from\nthe face of Israel, for the LORD fights for\nthem against the Egyptians.\"\nThen the LORD said to Moses,\n\"Stretch out your hand over the sea, that\nthe waters may come back upon the\nEgyptians, on their chariots, and on their\nhorsemen.\"\nAnd Moses stretched out his hand\nover the sea; and when the morning\nappeared, the sea returned to its full\ndepth, while the Egyptians were fleeing\ninto it. So the LORD overthrew the\nEgyptians in the midst of the sea.\nThen the waters returned and covered\nthe chariots, the horsemen, and all the\narmy of Pharaoh that came into the sea\nafter them. Not so much as one of them\nremained.\nBut the children of Israel had walked\non dry land in the midst of the sea, and\nthe waters were a wall to them on their\nright hand and on their left.\nSo the LORD saved Israel that day out\nof the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel\nsaw the Egyptians dead on the\nseashore.\nThus Israel saw the great work which\nthe LORD had done in Egypt; so the\npeople feared the LORD, and believed\nthe LORD and His servant Moses.\n15Then Moses and the children of\nIsrael sang this song to the LORD, and\nspoke, saying: \"I will sing to the LORD,\nFor He has triumphed gloriously! The\nhorse and its rider He has thrown into\nthe sea!\nThe LORD is my strength and song,\nAnd He has become my salvation; He is\nmy God, and I will praise Him; My\nfather's God, and I will exalt Him.\nThe LORD is a man of war; The LORD\nis His name.\nPharaoh's chariots and his army He\nhas cast into the sea; His chosen\ncaptains also are drowned in the Red\nSea.\nThe depths have covered them; They\nsank to the bottom like a stone.\n\"Your right hand, O LORD, has become\nglorious in power; Your right hand, O\nLORD, has dashed the enemy in pieces.\nAnd in the greatness of Your\nexcellence You have overthrown those\nwho rose against You; You sent forth\nYour wrath; It consumed them like\nstubble.\nFear and dread will fall on them; By\nthe greatness of Your arm They will be\nas still as a stone, Till Your people pass\nover, O LORD, Till the people pass over\nWhom You have purchased.\nAnd with the blast of Your nostrils The\nwaters were gathered together; The\nfloods stood upright like a heap; The\ndepths congealed in the heart of the sea.\nThe enemy said, \"I will pursue, I will\novertake, I will divide the spoil; My\ndesire shall be satisfied on them. I will\ndraw my sword, My hand shall destroy\nthem.'\nYou will bring them in and plant them\nIn the mountain of Your inheritance, In\nthe place, O LORD, which You have\nmade For Your own dwelling, The\nsanctuary, O LORD, which Your hands\nhave established.\n\"The LORD shall reign forever and\never.\"\nYou blew with Your wind, The sea\ncovered them; They sank like lead in the\nmighty waters.\n\"Who is like You, O LORD, among the\ngods? Who is like You, glorious in\nholiness, Fearful in praises, doing\nwonders?\nYou stretched out Your right hand; The\nearth swallowed them.\nYou in Your mercy have led forth The\npeople whom You have redeemed; You\nhave guided them in Your strength To\nYour holy habitation.\n\"The people will hear and be afraid;\nSorrow will take hold of the inhabitants\nof Philistia.\nFor the horses of Pharaoh went with\nhis chariots and his horsemen into the\nsea, and the LORD brought back the\nwaters of the sea upon them. But the\nchildren of Israel went on dry land in the\nmidst of the sea.\nThen Miriam the prophetess, the sister\nof Aaron, took the timbrel in her hand;\nand all the women went out after her\nwith timbrels and with dances.\nAnd Miriam answered them: \"Sing to\nthe LORD, For He has triumphed\ngloriously! The horse and its rider He\nhas thrown into the sea!\"\nSo Moses brought Israel from the Red\nSea; then they went out into the\nWilderness of Shur. And they went three\ndays in the wilderness and found no\nwater.\nThen the chiefs of Edom will be\ndismayed; 1 The mighty men of Moab,\nTrembling will take hold of them; All the\ninhabitants of Canaan will melt away.\nNow when they came to Marah, they\ncould not drink the waters of Marah, for\nthey were bitter. Therefore the name of\nit was called Marah.\nAnd the people complained against\nMoses, saying, \"What shall we drink?\"\nSo he cried out to the LORD, and the\nLORD showed him a tree. When he cast\nit into the waters, the waters were made\nsweet. There He made a statute and an\nordinance for them, and there He tested\nthem,\nand said, \"If you diligently heed the\nvoice of the LORD your God and do\nwhat is right in His sight, give ear to His\ncommandments and keep all His\nstatutes, I will put none of the diseases\non you which I have brought on the\nEgyptians. For I am the LORD who\nheals you.\"\nThen they came to Elim, where there\nwere twelve wells of water and seventy\npalm trees; so they camped there by the\nwaters.\n16And they journeyed from Elim,\nand all the congregation of the children\nof Israel came to the Wilderness of Sin,\nwhich is between Elim and Sinai, on the\nfifteenth day of the second month after\nthey departed from the land of Egypt.\nThen the whole congregation of the\nchildren of Israel complained against\nMoses and Aaron in the wilderness.\nAnd the children of Israel said to them,\n\"Oh, that we had died by the hand of the\nLORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat\nby the pots of meat and when we ate\nbread to the full! For you have brought\nus out into this wilderness to kill this\nwhole assembly with hunger.\"\nThen the LORD said to Moses, \"Behold,\nI will rain bread from heaven for you.\nAnd the people shall go out and gather\na certain quota every day, that I may\ntest them, whether they will walk in My\nlaw or not.\nAnd it shall be on the sixth day that\nthey shall prepare what they bring in,\nand it shall be twice as much as they\ngather daily.\"\nThen Moses and Aaron said to all the\nchildren of Israel, \"At evening you shall\nknow that the LORD has brought you\nout of the land of Egypt.\nAnd in the morning you shall see the\nglory of the LORD; for He hears your\ncomplaints against the LORD. But what\nare we, that you complain against us?\"\nAlso Moses said, \"This shall be seen\nwhen the LORD gives you meat to eat in\nthe evening, and in the morning bread to\nthe full; for the LORD hears your\ncomplaints which you make against Him.\nAnd what are we? Your complaints are\nnot against us but against the LORD.\"\nThen Moses spoke to Aaron, \"Say to all\nthe congregation of the children of Israel,\n\"Come near before the LORD, for He\nhas heard your complaints.\"'\nNow it came to pass, as Aaron spoke\nto the whole congregation of the\nchildren of Israel, that they looked\ntoward the wilderness, and behold, the\nglory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.\nAnd the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n\"I have heard the complaints of the\nchildren of Israel. Speak to them, saying,\n\"At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the\nmorning you shall be filled with bread.\nAnd you shall know that I am the LORD\nyour God.\"'\nSo it was that quails came up at\nevening and covered the camp, and in\nthe morning the dew lay all around the\ncamp.\nAnd when the layer of dew lifted, there,\non the surface of the wilderness, was a\nsmall round substance, as fine as frost\non the ground.\nSo when the children of Israel saw it,\nthey said to one another, \"What is it?\"\nFor they did not know what it was. And\nMoses said to them, \"This is the bread\nwhich the LORD has given you to eat.\nNotwithstanding they did not heed\nMoses. But some of them left part of it\nuntil morning, and it bred worms and\nstank. And Moses was angry with them.\nSo they gathered it every morning,\nevery man according to his need. And\nwhen the sun became hot, it melted.\nAnd so it was, on the sixth day, that\nthey gathered twice as much bread, two\nomers for each one. And all the rulers of\nthe congregation came and told Moses.\nThen he said to them, \"This is what the\nLORD has said: \"Tomorrow is a\nSabbath rest, a holy Sabbath to the\nLORD. Bake what you will bake today,\nand boil what you will boil; and lay up for\nyourselves all that remains, to be kept\nuntil morning.\"'\nThis is the thing which the LORD has\ncommanded: \"Let every man gather it\naccording to each one's need, one omer\nfor each person, according to the\nnumber of persons; let every man take\nfor those who are in his tent.\"'\nThen the children of Israel did so and\ngathered, some more, some less.\nSo when they measured it by omers,\nhe who gathered much had nothing left\nover, and he who gathered little had no\nlack. Every man had gathered according\nto each one's need.\nSo they laid it up till morning, as\nMoses commanded; and it did not stink,\nnor were there any worms in it.\nThen Moses said, \"Eat that today, for\ntoday is a Sabbath to the LORD; today\nyou will not find it in the field.\nSix days you shall gather it, but on the\nseventh day, the Sabbath, there will be\nnone.\"\nNow it happened that some of the\npeople went out on the seventh day to\ngather, but they found none.\nAnd Moses said, \"Let no one leave\nany of it till morning.\"\nAnd the LORD said to Moses, \"How\nlong do you refuse to keep My\ncommandments and My laws?\nSee! For the LORD has given you the\nSabbath; therefore He gives you on the\nsixth day bread for two days. Let every\nman remain in his place; let no man go\nout of his place on the seventh day.\"\nSo the people rested on the seventh\nday.\nthe commandment of the LORD, and\ncamped in Rephidim; but there was no\nwater for the people to drink.\nTherefore the people contended with\nMoses, and said, \"Give us water, that\nwe may drink.\" So Moses said to them,\n\"Why do you contend with me? Why do\nyou tempt the LORD?\"\nAnd the house of Israel called its name\nManna. And it was like white coriander\nseed, and the taste of it was like wafers\nmade with honey.\nThen Moses said, \"This is the thing\nwhich the LORD has commanded: \"Fill\nan omer with it, to be kept for your\ngenerations, that they may see the\nbread with which I fed you in the\nwilderness, when I brought you out of\nthe land of Egypt.\"'\nAnd Moses said to Aaron, \"Take a pot\nand put an omer of manna in it, and lay\nit up before the LORD, to be kept for\nyour generations.\"\nAnd the people thirsted there for water,\nand the people complained against\nMoses, and said, \"Why is it you have\nbrought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and\nour children and our livestock with\nthirst?\"\nSo Moses cried out to the LORD,\nsaying, \"What shall I do with this\npeople? They are almost ready to stone\nme!\"\nAnd the LORD said to Moses, \"Go on\nbefore the people, and take with you\nsome of the elders of Israel. Also take in\nyour hand your rod with which you\nstruck the river, and go.\nAs the LORD commanded Moses, so\nAaron laid it up before the Testimony, to\nbe kept.\nAnd the children of Israel ate manna\nforty years, until they came to an\ninhabited land; they ate manna until they\ncame to the border of the land of\nCanaan.\nNow an omer is one-tenth of an ephah.\n17Then all the congregation of the\nchildren of Israel set out on their journey\nfrom the Wilderness of Sin, according to\nBehold, I will stand before you there on\nthe rock in Horeb; and you shall strike\nthe rock, and water will come out of it,\nthat the people may drink.\" And Moses\ndid so in the sight of the elders of Israel.\nSo he called the name of the place\nMassah and Meribah, because of the\ncontention of the children of Israel, and\nbecause they tempted the LORD,\nsaying, \"Is the LORD among us or not?\"\nNow Amalek came and fought with\nIsrael in Rephidim.\nAnd Moses said to Joshua, \"Choose us\nsome men and go out, fight with Amalek.\nTomorrow I will stand on the top of the\nhill with the rod of God in my hand.\"\nSo Joshua did as Moses said to him,\nand fought with Amalek. And Moses,\nAaron, and Hur went up to the top of the\nhill.\nAnd so it was, when Moses held up his\nhand, that Israel prevailed; and when he\nlet down his hand, Amalek prevailed.\nBut Moses' hands became heavy; so\nthey took a stone and put it under him,\nand he sat on it. And Aaron and Hur\nsupported his hands, one on one side,\nand the other on the other side; and his\nhands were steady until the going down\nof the sun.\nHis people--that the LORD had brought\nIsrael out of Egypt.\nThen Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took\nZipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent\nher back,\nwith her two sons, of whom the name of\none was Gershom (for he said, \"I have\nbeen a stranger in a foreign land\")\nand the name of the other was Eliezer\n(for he said, \"The God of my father was\nmy help, and delivered me from the\nsword of Pharaoh\");\nand Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came\nwith his sons and his wife to Moses in\nthe wilderness, where he was\nencamped at the mountain of God.\nSo Joshua defeated Amalek and his\npeople with the edge of the sword.\nNow he had said to Moses, \"I, your\nfather-in-law Jethro, am coming to you\nwith your wife and her two sons with\nher.\"\nThen the LORD said to Moses, \"Write\nthis for a memorial in the book and\nrecount it in the hearing of Joshua, that I\nwill utterly blot out the remembrance of\nAmalek from under heaven.\"\nSo Moses went out to meet his fatherin-law, bowed down, and kissed him.\nAnd they asked each other about their\nwell-being, and they went into the tent.\nAnd Moses built an altar and called its\nname, The-LORD-Is-My-Banner;\nfor he said, \"Because the LORD has\nsworn: the LORD will have war with\nAmalek from generation to generation.\"\n18And Jethro, the priest of Midian,\nMoses' father-in-law, heard of all that\nGod had done for Moses and for Israel\nAnd Moses told his father-in-law all that\nthe LORD had done to Pharaoh and to\nthe Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the\nhardship that had come upon them on\nthe way, and how the LORD had\ndelivered them.\nThen Jethro rejoiced for all the good\nwhich the LORD had done for Israel,\nwhom He had delivered out of the hand\nof the Egyptians.\nAnd Jethro said, \"Blessed be the\nLORD, who has delivered you out of the\nhand of the Egyptians and out of the\nhand of Pharaoh, and who has delivered\nthe people from under the hand of the\nEgyptians.\nNow I know that the LORD is greater\nthan all the gods; for in the very thing in\nwhich they behaved proudly, He was\nabove them.\"\nThen Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took\na burnt offering and other sacrifices to\noffer to God. And Aaron came with all\nthe elders of Israel to eat bread with\nMoses' father-in-law before God.\nAnd so it was, on the next day, that\nMoses sat to judge the people; and the\npeople stood before Moses from\nmorning until evening.\nBoth you and these people who are\nwith you will surely wear yourselves out.\nFor this thing is too much for you; you\nare not able to perform it by yourself.\nListen now to my voice; I will give you\ncounsel, and God will be with you:\nStand before God for the people, so that\nyou may bring the difficulties to God.\nAnd you shall teach them the statutes\nand the laws, and show them the way in\nwhich they must walk and the work they\nmust do.\nMoreover you shall select from all the\npeople able men, such as fear God,\nmen of truth, hating covetousness; and\nplace such over them to be rulers of\nthousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of\nfifties, and rulers of tens.\nSo when Moses' father-in-law saw all\nthat he did for the people, he said,\n\"What is this thing that you are doing for\nthe people? Why do you alone sit, and\nall the people stand before you from\nmorning until evening?\"\nAnd let them judge the people at all\ntimes. Then it will be that every great\nmatter they shall bring to you, but every\nsmall matter they themselves shall\njudge. So it will be easier for you, for\nthey will bear the burden with you.\nAnd Moses said to his father-in-law,\n\"Because the people come to me to\ninquire of God.\nIf you do this thing, and God so\ncommands you, then you will be able to\nendure, and all this people will also go\nto their place in peace.\"\nWhen they have a difficulty, they come\nto me, and I judge between one and\nanother; and I make known the statutes\nof God and His laws.\"\nSo Moses' father-in-law said to him,\n\"The thing that you do is not good.\nSo Moses heeded the voice of his\nfather-in-law and did all that he had said.\nAnd Moses chose able men out of all\nIsrael, and made them heads over the\npeople: rulers of thousands, rulers of\nhundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of\ntens.\nSo they judged the people at all times;\nthe hard cases they brought to Moses,\nbut they judged every small case\nthemselves.\nThen all the people answered together\nand said, \"All that the LORD has spoken\nwe will do.\" So Moses brought back the\nwords of the people to the LORD.\nThen Moses let his father-in-law\ndepart, and he went his way to his own\nland.\n19In the third month after the\nchildren of Israel had gone out of the\nland of Egypt, on the same day, they\ncame to the Wilderness of Sinai.\nFor they had departed from Rephidim,\nhad come to the Wilderness of Sinai,\nand camped in the wilderness. So Israel\ncamped there before the mountain.\nAnd Moses went up to God, and the\nLORD called to him from the mountain,\nsaying, \"Thus you shall say to the house\nof Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:\n\"You have seen what I did to the\nEgyptians, and how I bore you on\neagles' wings and brought you to Myself.\nNow therefore, if you will indeed obey\nMy voice and keep My covenant, then\nyou shall be a special treasure to Me\nabove all people; for all the earth is Mine.\nAnd you shall be to Me a kingdom of\npriests and a holy nation.' These are the\nwords which you shall speak to the\nchildren of Israel.\"\nSo Moses came and called for the\nelders of the people, and laid before\nthem all these words which the LORD\ncommanded him.\nAnd the LORD said to Moses, \"Behold,\nI come to you in the thick cloud, that the\npeople may hear when I speak with you,\nand believe you forever.\" So Moses told\nthe words of the people to the LORD.\nThen the LORD said to Moses, \"Go to\nthe people and consecrate them today\nand tomorrow, and let them wash their\nclothes.\nAnd let them be ready for the third day.\nFor on the third day the LORD will come\ndown upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all\nthe people.\nYou shall set bounds for the people all\naround, saying, \"Take heed to\nyourselves that you do not go up to the\nmountain or touch its base. Whoever\ntouches the mountain shall surely be put\nto death.\nNot a hand shall touch him, but he\nshall surely be stoned or shot with an\narrow; whether man or beast, he shall\nnot live.' When the trumpet sounds long,\nthey shall come near the mountain.\"\nSo Moses went down from the\nmountain to the people and sanctified\nthe people, and they washed their\nclothes.\nAnd he said to the people, \"Be ready\nfor the third day; do not come near your\nwives.\"\nThen it came to pass on the third day,\nin the morning, that there were\nthunderings and lightnings, and a thick\ncloud on the mountain; and the sound of\nthe trumpet was very loud, so that all the\npeople who were in the camp trembled.\nAnd Moses brought the people out of\nthe camp to meet with God, and they\nstood at the foot of the mountain.\nNow Mount Sinai was completely in\nsmoke, because the LORD descended\nupon it in fire. Its smoke ascended like\nthe smoke of a furnace, and the whole\nmountain quaked greatly.\nAnd when the blast of the trumpet\nsounded long and became louder and\nlouder, Moses spoke, and God\nanswered him by voice.\nThen the LORD came down upon\nMount Sinai, on the top of the mountain.\nAnd the LORD called Moses to the top\nof the mountain, and Moses went up.\nAnd the LORD said to Moses, \"Go\ndown and warn the people, lest they\nbreak through to gaze at the LORD, and\nmany of them perish.\nAlso let the priests who come near the\nLORD consecrate themselves, lest the\nLORD break out against them.\"\nBut Moses said to the LORD, \"The\npeople cannot come up to Mount Sinai;\nfor You warned us, saying, \"Set bounds\naround the mountain and consecrate it.\"'\nThen the LORD said to him, \"Away!\nGet down and then come up, you and\nAaron with you. But do not let the priests\nand the people break through to come\nup to the LORD, lest He break out\nagainst them.\"\nSo Moses went down to the people\nand spoke to them.\n20And God spoke all these words,\nsaying:\n\"I am the LORD your God, who brought\nyou out of the land of Egypt, out of the\nhouse of bondage.\n\"You shall have no other gods before\nMe.\n\"You shall not make for yourself a\ncarved image--any likeness of anything\nthat is in heaven above, or that is in the\nearth beneath, or that is in the water\nunder the earth;\nyou shall not bow down to them nor\nserve them. For I, the LORD your God,\nam a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of\nthe fathers upon the children to the third\nand fourth generations of those who\nhate Me,\nbut showing mercy to thousands, to\nthose who love Me and keep My\ncommandments.\n\"You shall not take the name of the\nLORD your God in vain, for the LORD\nwill not hold him guiltless who takes His\nname in vain.\n\"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it\nholy.\nSix days you shall labor and do all your\nwork,\nThen they said to Moses, \"You speak\nwith us, and we will hear; but let not God\nspeak with us, lest we die.\"\nbut the seventh day is the Sabbath of\nthe LORD your God. In it you shall do\nno work: you, nor your son, nor your\ndaughter, nor your male servant, nor\nyour female servant, nor your cattle, nor\nyour stranger who is within your gates.\nAnd Moses said to the people, \"Do not\nfear; for God has come to test you, and\nthat His fear may be before you, so that\nyou may not sin.\"\nFor in six days the LORD made the\nheavens and the earth, the sea, and all\nthat is in them, and rested the seventh\nday. Therefore the LORD blessed the\nSabbath day and hallowed it.\n\"Honor your father and your mother,\nthat your days may be long upon the\nland which the LORD your God is giving\nyou.\nSo the people stood afar off, but\nMoses drew near the thick darkness\nwhere God was.\nThen the LORD said to Moses, \"Thus\nyou shall say to the children of Israel:\n\"You have seen that I have talked with\nyou from heaven.\nYou shall not make anything to be with\nMe--gods of silver or gods of gold you\nshall not make for yourselves.\n\"You shall not murder.\n\"You shall not commit adultery.\n\"You shall not steal.\n\"You shall not bear false witness\nagainst your neighbor.\n\"You shall not covet your neighbor's\nhouse; you shall not covet your\nneighbor's wife, nor his male servant,\nnor his female servant, nor his ox, nor\nhis donkey, nor anything that is your\nneighbor's.\"\nAn altar of earth you shall make for Me,\nand you shall sacrifice on it your burnt\nofferings and your peace offerings, your\nsheep and your oxen.

The\ntablets were written on both sides; on\nthe one side and on the other they were\nwritten.\nNow the tablets were the work of God,\nand the writing was the writing of God\nengraved on the tablets.\nFor they said to me, \"Make us gods\nthat shall go before us; as for this Moses,\nthe man who brought us out of the land\nof Egypt, we do not know what has\nbecome of him.'\nAnd I said to them, \"Whoever has any\ngold, let them break it off.' So they gave\nit to me, and I cast it into the fire, and\nthis calf came out.\"\nAnd when Joshua heard the noise of\nthe people as they shouted, he said to\nMoses, \"There is a noise of war in the\ncamp.\"\nNow when Moses saw that the people\nwere unrestrained (for Aaron had not\nrestrained them, to their shame among\ntheir enemies),\nBut he said: \"It is not the noise of the\nshout of victory, Nor the noise of the cry\nof defeat, But the sound of singing I\nhear.\"\nthen Moses stood in the entrance of\nthe camp, and said, \"Whoever is on the\nLORD's side--come to me!\" And all the\nsons of Levi gathered themselves\ntogether to him.\nSo it was, as soon as he came near\nthe camp, that he saw the calf and the\ndancing. So Moses' anger became hot,\nAnd he said to them, \"Thus says the\nLORD God of Israel: \"Let every man put\nhis sword on his side, and go in and out\nfrom entrance to entrance throughout\nthe camp, and let every man kill his\nbrother, every man his companion, and\nevery man his neighbor.\"'\nSo the LORD plagued the people\nbecause of what they did with the calf\nwhich Aaron made.\n33Then the LORD said to Moses,\n\"Depart and go up from here, you and\nthe people whom you have brought out\nof the land of Egypt, to the land of which\nI swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,\nsaying, \"To your descendants I will give\nit.'\nSo the sons of Levi did according to\nthe word of Moses. And about three\nthousand men of the people fell that day.\nThen Moses said, \"Consecrate\nyourselves today to the LORD, that He\nmay bestow on you a blessing this day,\nfor every man has opposed his son and\nhis brother.\"\nNow it came to pass on the next day\nthat Moses said to the people, \"You\nhave committed a great sin. So now I\nwill go up to the LORD; perhaps I can\nmake atonement for your sin.\"\nThen Moses returned to the LORD\nand said, \"Oh, these people have\ncommitted a great sin, and have made\nfor themselves a god of gold!\nYet now, if You will forgive their sin-but if not, I pray, blot me out of Your\nbook which You have written.\"\nAnd the LORD said to Moses,\n\"Whoever has sinned against Me, I will\nblot him out of My book.\nNow therefore, go, lead the people to\nthe place of which I have spoken to you.\nBehold, My Angel shall go before you.\nNevertheless, in the day when I visit for\npunishment, I will visit punishment upon\nthem for their sin.\"\nAnd I will send My Angel before you,\nand I will drive out the Canaanite and\nthe Amorite and the Hittite and the\nPerizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite.\nGo up to a land flowing with milk and\nhoney; for I will not go up in your midst,\nlest I consume you on the way, for you\nare a stiff-necked people.\"\nAnd when the people heard this bad\nnews, they mourned, and no one put on\nhis ornaments.\nFor the LORD had said to Moses, \"Say\nto the children of Israel, \"You are a stiffnecked people. I could come up into\nyour midst in one moment and consume\nyou. Now therefore, take off your\nornaments, that I may know what to do\nto you.\"'\nSo the children of Israel stripped\nthemselves of their ornaments by Mount\nHoreb.\nMoses took his tent and pitched it\noutside the camp, far from the camp,\nand called it the tabernacle of meeting.\nAnd it came to pass that everyone who\nsought the LORD went out to the\ntabernacle of meeting which was\noutside the camp.\nThen he said to Him, \"If Your\nPresence does not go with us, do not\nbring us up from here.\nSo it was, whenever Moses went out to\nthe tabernacle, that all the people rose,\nand each man stood at his tent door and\nwatched Moses until he had gone into\nthe tabernacle.\nFor how then will it be known that Your\npeople and I have found grace in Your\nsight, except You go with us? So we\nshall be separate, Your people and I,\nfrom all the people who are upon the\nface of the earth.\"\nAnd it came to pass, when Moses\nentered the tabernacle, that the pillar of\ncloud descended and stood at the door\nof the tabernacle, and the LORD talked\nwith Moses.\nSo the LORD said to Moses, \"I will\nalso do this thing that you have spoken;\nfor you have found grace in My sight,\nand I know you by name.\"\nAll the people saw the pillar of cloud\nstanding at the tabernacle door, and all\nthe people rose and worshiped, each\nman in his tent door.\nSo the LORD spoke to Moses face to\nface, as a man speaks to his friend. And\nhe would return to the camp, but his\nservant Joshua the son of Nun, a young\nman, did not depart from the tabernacle.\nAnd he said, \"Please, show me Your\nglory.\"\nThen He said, \"I will make all My\ngoodness pass before you, and I will\nproclaim the name of the LORD before\nyou. I will be gracious to whom I will be\ngracious, and I will have compassion on\nwhom I will have compassion.\"\nThen Moses said to the LORD, \"See,\nYou say to me, \"Bring up this people.'\nBut You have not let me know whom\nYou will send with me. Yet You have\nsaid, \"I know you by name, and you\nhave also found grace in My sight.'\nNow therefore, I pray, if I have found\ngrace in Your sight, show me now Your\nway, that I may know You and that I\nmay find grace in Your sight. And\nconsider that this nation is Your people.\"\nAnd He said, \"My Presence will go\nwith you, and I will give you rest.\"\nBut He said, \"You cannot see My face;\nfor no man shall see Me, and live.\"\nAnd the LORD said, \"Here is a place\nby Me, and you shall stand on the rock.\nSo it shall be, while My glory passes\nby, that I will put you in the cleft of the\nrock, and will cover you with My hand\nwhile I pass by.\nThen I will take away My hand, and\nyou shall see My back; but My face shall\nnot be seen.\"\n34And the LORD said to Moses,\n\"Cut two tablets of stone like the first\nones, and I will write on these tablets\nthe words that were on the first tablets\nwhich you broke.\nSo be ready in the morning, and come\nup in the morning to Mount Sinai, and\npresent yourself to Me there on the top\nof the mountain.\nAnd no man shall come up with you,\nand let no man be seen throughout all\nthe mountain; let neither flocks nor\nherds feed before that mountain.\"\nSo he cut two tablets of stone like the\nfirst ones. Then Moses rose early in the\nmorning and went up Mount Sinai, as\nthe LORD had commanded him; and he\ntook in his hand the two tablets of stone.\nNow the LORD descended in the cloud\nand stood with him there, and\nproclaimed the name of the LORD.\nAnd the LORD passed before him and\nproclaimed, \"The LORD, the LORD God,\nmerciful and gracious, longsuffering,\nand abounding in goodness and truth,\nkeeping mercy for thousands, forgiving\niniquity and transgression and sin, by no\nmeans clearing the guilty, visiting the\niniquity of the fathers upon the children\nand the children's children to the third\nand the fourth generation.\"\nSo Moses made haste and bowed his\nhead toward the earth, and worshiped.\nThen he said, \"If now I have found\ngrace in Your sight, O Lord, let my Lord,\nI pray, go among us, even though we\nare a stiff-necked people; and pardon\nour iniquity and our sin, and take us as\nYour inheritance.\"\nAnd He said: \"Behold, I make a\ncovenant. Before all your people I will do\nmarvels such as have not been done in\nall the earth, nor in any nation; and all\nthe people among whom you are shall\nsee the work of the LORD. For it is an\nawesome thing that I will do with you.\nObserve what I command you this day.\nBehold, I am driving out from before you\nthe Amorite and the Canaanite and the\nHittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite\nand the Jebusite.\nTake heed to yourself, lest you make a\ncovenant with the inhabitants of the land\nwhere you are going, lest it be a snare\nin your midst.\nBut you shall destroy their altars,\nbreak their sacred pillars, and cut down\ntheir wooden images\n(for you shall worship no other god, for\nthe LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a\njealous God),\nlest you make a covenant with the\ninhabitants of the land, and they play the\nharlot with their gods and make sacrifice\nto their gods, and one of them invites\nyou and you eat of his sacrifice,\nand you take of his daughters for your\nsons, and his daughters play the harlot\nwith their gods and make your sons play\nthe harlot with their gods.\n\"You shall make no molded gods for\nyourselves.\n\"The Feast of Unleavened Bread you\nshall keep. Seven days you shall eat\nunleavened bread, as I commanded you,\nin the appointed time of the month of\nAbib; for in the month of Abib you came\nout from Egypt.\n\"All that open the womb are Mine, and\nevery male firstborn among your\nlivestock, whether ox or sheep.\nBut the firstborn of a donkey you shall\nredeem with a lamb. And if you will not\nredeem him, then you shall break his\nneck. All the firstborn of your sons you\nshall redeem. \"And none shall appear\nbefore Me empty-handed.\n\"Six days you shall work, but on the\nseventh day you shall rest; in plowing\ntime and in harvest you shall rest.\n\"You shall not offer the blood of My\nsacrifice with leaven, nor shall the\nsacrifice of the Feast of the Passover be\nleft until morning.\n\"The first of the firstfruits of your land\nyou shall bring to the house of the\nLORD your God. You shall not boil a\nyoung goat in its mother's milk.\"\nThen the LORD said to Moses, \"Write\nthese words, for according to the tenor\nof these words I have made a covenant\nwith you and with Israel.\"\nSo he was there with the LORD forty\ndays and forty nights; he neither ate\nbread nor drank water. And He wrote on\nthe tablets the words of the covenant,\nthe Ten Commandments.\nNow it was so, when Moses came\ndown from Mount Sinai (and the two\ntablets of the Testimony were in Moses'\nhand when he came down from the\nmountain), that Moses did not know that\nthe skin of his face shone while he\ntalked with Him.\n\"And you shall observe the Feast of\nWeeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest,\nand the Feast of Ingathering at the\nyear's end.\nSo when Aaron and all the children of\nIsrael saw Moses, behold, the skin of his\nface shone, and they were afraid to\ncome near him.\n\"Three times in the year all your men\nshall appear before the Lord, the LORD\nGod of Israel.\nFor I will cast out the nations before\nyou and enlarge your borders; neither\nwill any man covet your land when you\ngo up to appear before the LORD your\nGod three times in the year.\nThen Moses called to them, and Aaron\nand all the rulers of the congregation\nreturned to him; and Moses talked with\nthem.\nAfterward all the children of Israel\ncame near, and he gave them as\ncommandments all that the LORD had\nspoken with him on Mount Sinai.\nAnd when Moses had finished\nspeaking with them, he put a veil on his\nface.\nblue, purple, and scarlet thread, fine\nlinen, and goats' hair;\nBut whenever Moses went in before\nthe LORD to speak with Him, he would\ntake the veil off until he came out; and\nhe would come out and speak to the\nchildren of Israel whatever he had been\ncommanded.\nAnd whenever the children of Israel\nsaw the face of Moses, that the skin of\nMoses' face shone, then Moses would\nput the veil on his face again, until he\nwent in to speak with Him.\nram skins dyed red, badger skins, and\nacacia wood;\noil for the light, and spices for the\nanointing oil and for the sweet incense;\nonyx stones, and stones to be set in the\nephod and in the breastplate.\n\"All who are gifted artisans among you\nshall come and make all that the LORD\nhas commanded:\n35Then Moses gathered all the\ncongregation of the children of Israel\ntogether, and said to them, \"These are\nthe words which the LORD has\ncommanded you to do:\nthe tabernacle, its tent, its covering, its\nclasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars,\nand its sockets;\nthe ark and its poles, with the mercy\nseat, and the veil of the covering;\nWork shall be done for six days, but the\nseventh day shall be a holy day for you,\na Sabbath of rest to the LORD.\nWhoever does any work on it shall be\nput to death.\nYou shall kindle no fire throughout your\ndwellings on the Sabbath day.\"\nAnd Moses spoke to all the\ncongregation of the children of Israel,\nsaying, \"This is the thing which the\nLORD commanded, saying:\n\"Take from among you an offering to\nthe LORD.

And everyone with whom was\nfound acacia wood for any work of the\nservice, brought it.\nAll the women who were gifted\nartisans spun yarn with their hands, and\nbrought what they had spun, of blue,\npurple, and scarlet, and fine linen.\nin cutting jewels for setting, in carving\nwood, and to work in all manner of\nartistic workmanship.\n\"And He has put in his heart the ability\nto teach, in him and Aholiab the son of\nAhisamach, of the tribe of Dan.\nHe has filled them with skill to do all\nmanner of work of the engraver and the\ndesigner and the tapestry maker, in blue,\npurple, and scarlet thread, and fine linen,\nand of the weaver--those who do every\nwork and those who design artistic\nworks.\nfor the material they had was sufficient\nfor all the work to be done--indeed too\nmuch.\n36\"And Bezalel and Aholiab, and\nevery gifted artisan in whom the LORD\nhas put wisdom and understanding, to\nknow how to do all manner of work for\nthe service of the sanctuary, shall do\naccording to all that the LORD has\ncommanded.\"\nThen all the gifted artisans among them\nwho worked on the tabernacle made ten\ncurtains woven of fine linen, and of blue,\npurple, and scarlet thread; with artistic\ndesigns of cherubim they made them.\nThe length of each curtain was twentyeight cubits, and the width of each\ncurtain four cubits; the curtains were all\nthe same size.\nThen Moses called Bezalel and Aholiab,\nand every gifted artisan in whose heart\nthe LORD had put wisdom, everyone\nwhose heart was stirred, to come and\ndo the work.\nAnd he coupled five curtains to one\nanother, and the other five curtains he\ncoupled to one another.\nAnd they received from Moses all the\noffering which the children of Israel had\nbrought for the work of the service of\nmaking the sanctuary. So they\ncontinued bringing to him freewill\nofferings every morning.\nHe made loops of blue yarn on the\nedge of the curtain on the selvedge of\none set; likewise he did on the outer\nedge of the other curtain of the second\nset.\nThen all the craftsmen who were doing\nall the work of the sanctuary came, each\nfrom the work he was doing,\nFifty loops he made on one curtain,\nand fifty loops he made on the edge of\nthe curtain on the end of the second set;\nthe loops held one curtain to another.\nand they spoke to Moses, saying, \"The\npeople bring much more than enough\nfor the service of the work which the\nLORD commanded us to do.\"\nAnd he made fifty clasps of gold, and\ncoupled the curtains to one another with\nthe clasps, that it might be one\ntabernacle.\nSo Moses gave a commandment, and\nthey caused it to be proclaimed\nthroughout the camp, saying, \"Let\nneither man nor woman do any more\nwork for the offering of the sanctuary.\"\nAnd the people were restrained from\nbringing,\nHe made curtains of goats' hair for the\ntent over the tabernacle; he made\neleven curtains.\nThe length of each curtain was thirty\ncubits, and the width of each curtain four\ncubits; the eleven curtains were the\nsame size.\nHe\ncoupled\nfive\nthemselves and six\nthemselves.\ncurtains\ncurtains\nby\nby\nFor the west side of the tabernacle he\nmade six boards.\nAnd he made fifty loops on the edge of\nthe curtain that is outermost in one set,\nand fifty loops he made on the edge of\nthe curtain of the second set.\nHe also made fifty bronze clasps to\ncouple the tent together, that it might be\none.\nThen he made a covering for the tent\nof ram skins dyed red, and a covering of\nbadger skins above that.\nFor the tabernacle he made boards of\nacacia wood, standing upright.\nHe also made two boards for the two\nback corners of the tabernacle.\nAnd they were coupled at the bottom\nand coupled together at the top by one\nring. Thus he made both of them for the\ntwo corners.\nSo there were eight boards and their\nsockets--sixteen sockets of silver--two\nsockets under each of the boards.\nAnd he made bars of acacia wood: five\nfor the boards on one side of the\ntabernacle,\nThe length of each board was ten\ncubits, and the width of each board a\ncubit and a half.\nfive bars for the boards on the other\nside of the tabernacle, and five bars for\nthe boards of the tabernacle on the far\nside westward.\nEach board had two tenons for binding\none to another. Thus he made for all the\nboards of the tabernacle.\nAnd he made the middle bar to pass\nthrough the boards from one end to the\nother.\nAnd he made boards for the\ntabernacle, twenty boards for the south\nside.\nHe overlaid the boards with gold,\nmade their rings of gold to be holders for\nthe bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.\nForty sockets of silver he made to go\nunder the twenty boards: two sockets\nunder each of the boards for its two\ntenons.\nAnd he made a veil of blue, purple,\nand scarlet thread, and fine woven linen;\nit was worked with an artistic design of\ncherubim.\nAnd for the other side of the\ntabernacle, the north side, he made\ntwenty boards\nand their forty sockets of silver: two\nsockets under each of the boards.\nHe made for it four pillars of acacia\nwood, and overlaid them with gold, with\ntheir hooks of gold; and he cast four\nsockets of silver for them.\nHe also made a screen for the\ntabernacle door, of blue, purple, and\nscarlet thread, and fine woven linen,\nmade by a weaver,\nThe cherubim spread out their wings\nabove, and covered the mercy seat with\ntheir wings.

And\nhe overlaid their capitals and their rings\nwith gold, but their five sockets were\nbronze.\n37Then Bezalel made the ark of\nacacia wood; two and a half cubits was\nits length, a cubit and a half its width,\nand a cubit and a half its height.\nHe overlaid it with pure gold inside and\noutside, and made a molding of gold all\naround it.\nAnd he cast for it four rings of gold to\nbe set in its four corners: two rings on\none side, and two rings on the other\nside of it.\nHe made poles of acacia wood, and\noverlaid them with gold.\nHe made the table of acacia wood; two\ncubits was its length, a cubit its width,\nand a cubit and a half its height.\nAnd he overlaid it with pure gold, and\nmade a molding of gold all around it.\nAlso he made a frame of a\nhandbreadth all around it, and made a\nmolding of gold for the frame all around\nit.\nAnd he cast for it four rings of gold,\nand put the rings on the four corners\nthat were at its four legs.\nThe rings were close to the frame, as\nholders for the poles to bear the table.\nAnd he made the poles of acacia wood\nto bear the table, and overlaid them with\ngold.\nAnd he put the poles into the rings at\nthe sides of the ark, to bear the ark.\nHe also made the mercy seat of pure\ngold; two and a half cubits was its length\nand a cubit and a half its width.\nHe made two cherubim of beaten gold;\nhe made them of one piece at the two\nends of the mercy seat:\none cherub at one end on this side, and\nthe other cherub at the other end on that\nside. He made the cherubim at the two\nends of one piece with the mercy seat.\nHe made of pure gold the utensils\nwhich were on the table: its dishes, its\ncups, its bowls, and its pitchers for\npouring.\nHe also made the lampstand of pure\ngold; of hammered work he made the\nlampstand. Its shaft, its branches, its\nbowls, its ornamental knobs, and its\nflowers were of the same piece.\nAnd six branches came out of its\nsides: three branches of the lampstand\nout of one side, and three branches of\nthe lampstand out of the other side.\nThere were three bowls made like\nalmond blossoms on one branch, with\nan ornamental knob and a flower, and\nthree bowls made like almond blossoms\non the other branch, with an ornamental\nknob and a flower--and so for the six\nbranches coming out of the lampstand.\nAnd on the lampstand itself were four\nbowls made like almond blossoms, each\nwith its ornamental knob and flower.\nThere was a knob under the first two\nbranches of the same, a knob under the\nsecond two branches of the same, and\na knob under the third two branches of\nthe same, according to the six branches\nextending from it.\nTheir knobs and their branches were\nof one piece; all of it was one hammered\npiece of pure gold.\nAnd he made its seven lamps, its wicktrimmers, and its trays of pure gold.\nOf a talent of pure gold he made it,\nwith all its utensils.\nHe made the incense altar of acacia\nwood. Its length was a cubit and its\nwidth a cubit--it was square--and two\ncubits was its height. Its horns were of\none piece with it.\nAnd he overlaid it with pure gold: its\ntop, its sides all around, and its horns.\nHe also made for it a molding of gold all\naround it.\nHe made two rings of gold for it under\nits molding, by its two corners on both\nsides, as holders for the poles with\nwhich to bear it.\nAnd he made the poles of acacia wood,\nand overlaid them with gold.\nHe also made the holy anointing oil\nand the pure incense of sweet spices,\naccording to the work of the perfumer.\n38He made the altar of burnt offering\nof acacia wood; five cubits was its\nlength and five cubits its width--it was\nsquare--and its height was three cubits.\nHe made its horns on its four corners;\nthe horns were of one piece with it. And\nhe overlaid it with bronze.\nHe made all the utensils for the altar:\nthe pans, the shovels, the basins, the\nforks, and the firepans; all its utensils he\nmade of bronze.\nAnd he made a grate of bronze network\nfor the altar, under its rim, midway from\nthe bottom.\nHe cast four rings for the four corners\nof the bronze grating, as holders for the\npoles.\nAnd he made the poles of acacia wood,\nand overlaid them with bronze.\nThen he put the poles into the rings on\nthe sides of the altar, with which to bear\nit. He made the altar hollow with boards.\nHe made the laver of bronze and its\nbase of bronze, from the bronze mirrors\nof the serving women who assembled at\nthe door of the tabernacle of meeting.\nThen he made the court on the south\nside; the hangings of the court were of\nfine woven linen, one hundred cubits\nlong.\ncapitals was silver; and all the pillars of\nthe court had bands of silver.\nThe screen for the gate of the court\nwas woven of blue, purple, and scarlet\nthread, and of fine woven linen.

According to the pattern which the\nLORD had shown Moses, so he made\nthe lampstand.\nThen the Levites shall lay their hands\non the heads of the young bulls, and\nyou shall offer one as a sin offering and\nthe other as a burnt offering to the\nLORD, to make atonement for the\nLevites.\n\"And you shall stand the Levites\nbefore Aaron and his sons, and then\noffer them like a wave offering to the\nLORD.\nThen the LORD spoke to Moses,\nsaying:\n\"Take the Levites from among the\nchildren of Israel and cleanse them\nceremonially.\nThus you shall separate the Levites\nfrom among the children of Israel, and\nthe Levites shall be Mine.\nAfter that the Levites shall go in to\nservice the tabernacle of meeting. So\nyou shall cleanse them and offer them\nlike a wave offering.\nbefore Aaron and his sons; as the\nLORD commanded Moses concerning\nthe Levites, so they did to them.\nFor they are wholly given to Me from\namong the children of Israel; I have\ntaken them for Myself instead of all who\nopen the womb, the firstborn of all the\nchildren of Israel.\nFor all the firstborn among the children\nof Israel are Mine, both man and beast;\non the day that I struck all the firstborn\nin the land of Egypt I sanctified them to\nMyself.\nI have taken the Levites instead of all\nthe firstborn of the children of Israel.\nAnd I have given the Levites as a gift\nto Aaron and his sons from among the\nchildren of Israel, to do the work for the\nchildren of Israel in the tabernacle of\nmeeting, and to make atonement for the\nchildren of Israel, that there be no\nplague among the children of Israel\nwhen the children of Israel come near\nthe sanctuary.\"\nThus Moses and Aaron and all the\ncongregation of the children of Israel did\nto the Levites; according to all that the\nLORD commanded Moses concerning\nthe Levites, so the children of Israel did\nto them.\nAnd the Levites purified themselves\nand washed their clothes; then Aaron\npresented them like a wave offering\nbefore the LORD, and Aaron made\natonement for them to cleanse them.\nAfter that the Levites went in to do\ntheir work in the tabernacle of meeting\nThen the LORD spoke to Moses,\nsaying,\n\"This is what pertains to the Levites:\nFrom twenty-five years old and above\none may enter to perform service in the\nwork of the tabernacle of meeting;\nand at the age of fifty years they must\ncease performing this work, and shall\nwork no more.\nThey may minister with their brethren\nin the tabernacle of meeting, to attend to\nneeds, but they themselves shall do no\nwork. Thus you shall do to the Levites\nregarding their duties.\"\n9Now the LORD spoke to Moses in\nthe Wilderness of Sinai, in the first\nmonth of the second year after they had\ncome out of the land of Egypt, saying:\n\"Let the children of Israel keep the\nPassover at its appointed time.\nOn the fourteenth day of this month, at\ntwilight, you shall keep it at its appointed\ntime. According to all its rites and\nceremonies you shall keep it.\"\nSo Moses told the children of Israel that\nthey should keep the Passover.\nAnd they kept the Passover on the\nfourteenth day of the first month, at\ntwilight, in the Wilderness of Sinai;\naccording to all that the LORD\ncommanded Moses, so the children of\nIsrael did.\nits appointed time; that man shall bear\nhis sin.\nNow there were certain men who were\ndefiled by a human corpse, so that they\ncould not keep the Passover on that\nday; and they came before Moses and\nAaron that day.\nAnd those men said to him, \"We\nbecame defiled by a human corpse.\nWhy are we kept from presenting the\noffering of the LORD at its appointed\ntime among the children of Israel?\"\nAnd Moses said to them, \"Stand still,\nthat I may hear what the LORD will\ncommand concerning you.\"\n\"And if a stranger dwells among you,\nand would keep the LORD's Passover,\nhe must do so according to the rite of\nthe Passover and according to its\nceremony;

as long as the cloud stayed\nabove the tabernacle they remained\nencamped.\nEven when the cloud continued long,\nmany days above the tabernacle, the\nchildren of Israel kept the charge of the\nLORD and did not journey.\nSo it was, when the cloud was above\nthe tabernacle a few days: according to\nthe command of the LORD they would\nremain encamped, and according to the\ncommand of the LORD they would\njourney.\nWhen you sound the advance, the\ncamps that lie on the east side shall\nthen begin their journey.\nSo it was, when the cloud remained\nonly from evening until morning: when\nthe cloud was taken up in the morning,\nthen they would journey; whether by day\nor by night, whenever the cloud was\ntaken up, they would journey.\nWhether it was two days, a month, or\na year that the cloud remained above\nthe tabernacle, the children of Israel\nwould remain encamped and not\njourney; but when it was taken up, they\nwould journey.\nWhen you sound the advance the\nsecond time, then the camps that lie on\nthe south side shall begin their journey;\nthey shall sound the call for them to\nbegin their journeys.\nAnd when the assembly is to be\ngathered together, you shall blow, but\nnot sound the advance.\nThe sons of Aaron, the priests, shall\nblow the trumpets; and these shall be to\nyou as an ordinance forever throughout\nyour generations.\nAt the command of the LORD they\nremained encamped, and at the\ncommand of the LORD they journeyed;\nthey kept the charge of the LORD, at the\ncommand of the LORD by the hand of\nMoses.\n\"When you go to war in your land\nagainst the enemy who oppresses you,\nthen you shall sound an alarm with the\ntrumpets, and you will be remembered\nbefore the LORD your God, and you will\nbe saved from your enemies.\n10And the LORD spoke to Moses,\nsaying:\n\"Make two silver trumpets for yourself;\nyou shall make them of hammered\nwork; you shall use them for calling the\ncongregation and for directing the\nmovement of the camps.\nWhen they blow both of them, all the\ncongregation shall gather before you at\nthe door of the tabernacle of meeting.\nBut if they blow only one, then the\nleaders, the heads of the divisions of\nIsrael, shall gather to you.\nAlso in the day of your gladness, in\nyour appointed feasts, and at the\nbeginning of your months, you shall\nblow the trumpets over your burnt\nofferings and over the sacrifices of your\npeace offerings;

Let\nYour enemies be scattered, And let\nthose who hate You flee before You.\"\nThe people went about and gathered it,\nground it on millstones or beat it in the\nmortar, cooked it in pans, and made\ncakes of it; and its taste was like the\ntaste of pastry prepared with oil.\nAnd when it rested, he said: \"Return,\nO LORD, To the many thousands of\nIsrael.\"\nAnd when the dew fell on the camp in\nthe night, the manna fell on it.\n11Now when the people complained,\nit displeased the LORD; for the LORD\nheard it, and His anger was aroused. So\nthe fire of the LORD burned among\nthem, and consumed some in the\noutskirts of the camp.\nThen the people cried out to Moses,\nand when Moses prayed to the LORD,\nthe fire was quenched.\nSo he called the name of the place\nTaberah, because the fire of the LORD\nhad burned among them.\nThen Moses heard the people\nweeping throughout their families,\neveryone at the door of his tent; and the\nanger of the LORD was greatly aroused;\nMoses also was displeased.\nSo Moses said to the LORD, \"Why\nhave You afflicted Your servant? And\nwhy have I not found favor in Your sight,\nthat You have laid the burden of all\nthese people on me?\nDid I conceive all these people? Did I\nbeget them, that You should say to me,\n\"Carry them in your bosom, as a\nguardian carries a nursing child,' to the\nland which You swore to their fathers?\nWhere am I to get meat to give to all\nthese people? For they weep all over\nme, saying, \"Give us meat, that we may\neat.'\nbut for a whole month, until it comes\nout of your nostrils and becomes\nloathsome to you, because you have\ndespised the LORD who is among you,\nand have wept before Him, saying,\n\"Why did we ever come up out of\nEgypt?\"\"'\nI am not able to bear all these people\nalone, because the burden is too heavy\nfor me.\nIf You treat me like this, please kill me\nhere and now--if I have found favor in\nYour sight--and do not let me see my\nwretchedness!\"\nSo the LORD said to Moses: \"Gather\nto Me seventy men of the elders of\nIsrael, whom you know to be the elders\nof the people and officers over them;\nbring them to the tabernacle of meeting,\nthat they may stand there with you.\nAnd Moses said, \"The people whom I\nam among are six hundred thousand\nmen on foot; yet You have said, \"I will\ngive them meat, that they may eat for a\nwhole month.'\nShall flocks and herds be slaughtered\nfor them, to provide enough for them?\nOr shall all the fish of the sea be\ngathered together for them, to provide\nenough for them?\"\nAnd the LORD said to Moses, \"Has\nthe LORD's arm been shortened? Now\nyou shall see whether what I say will\nhappen to you or not.\"\nThen I will come down and talk with\nyou there. I will take of the Spirit that is\nupon you and will put the same upon\nthem; and they shall bear the burden of\nthe people with you, that you may not\nbear it yourself alone.\nSo Moses went out and told the\npeople the words of the LORD, and he\ngathered the seventy men of the elders\nof the people and placed them around\nthe tabernacle.\nThen you shall say to the people,\n\"Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow,\nand you shall eat meat; for you have\nwept in the hearing of the LORD, saying,\n\"Who will give us meat to eat? For it was\nwell with us in Egypt.\" Therefore the\nLORD will give you meat, and you shall\neat.\nYou shall eat, not one day, nor two\ndays, nor five days, nor ten days, nor\ntwenty days,\nThen the LORD came down in the\ncloud, and spoke to him, and took of the\nSpirit that was upon him, and placed the\nsame upon the seventy elders; and it\nhappened, when the Spirit rested upon\nthem, that they prophesied, although\nthey never did so again.\nBut two men had remained in the\ncamp: the name of one was Eldad, and\nthe name of the other Medad. And the\nSpirit rested upon them. Now they were\namong those listed, but who had not\ngone out to the tabernacle; yet they\nprophesied in the camp.\nAnd a young man ran and told Moses,\nand said, \"Eldad and Medad are\nprophesying in the camp.\"\nSo Joshua the son of Nun, Moses'\nassistant, one of his choice men,\nanswered and said, \"Moses my lord,\nforbid them!\"\nThen Moses said to him, \"Are you\nzealous for my sake? Oh, that all the\nLORD's people were prophets and that\nthe LORD would put His Spirit upon\nthem!\"\nAnd Moses returned to the camp, he\nand the elders of Israel.\nSo he called the name of that place\nKibroth Hattaavah, because there they\nburied the people who had yielded to\ncraving.\nFrom Kibroth Hattaavah the people\nmoved to Hazeroth, and camped at\nHazeroth.\n12Then Miriam and Aaron spoke\nagainst Moses because of the Ethiopian\nwoman whom he had married; for he\nhad married an Ethiopian woman.\nSo they said, \"Has the LORD indeed\nspoken only through Moses? Has He\nnot spoken through us also?\" And the\nLORD heard it.\nNow a wind went out from the LORD,\nand it brought quail from the sea and left\nthem fluttering near the camp, about a\nday's journey on this side and about a\nday's journey on the other side, all\naround the camp, and about two cubits\nabove the surface of the ground.\nAnd the people stayed up all that day,\nall night, and all the next day, and\ngathered the quail (he who gathered\nleast gathered ten homers); and they\nspread them out for themselves all\naround the camp.\nBut while the meat was still between\ntheir teeth, before it was chewed, the\nwrath of the LORD was aroused against\nthe people, and the LORD struck the\npeople with a very great plague.\n(Now the man Moses was very humble,\nmore than all men who were on the face\nof the earth.)\nSuddenly the LORD said to Moses,\nAaron, and Miriam, \"Come out, you\nthree, to the tabernacle of meeting!\" So\nthe three came out.\nThen the LORD came down in the pillar\nof cloud and stood in the door of the\ntabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam.\nAnd they both went forward.\nThen He said, If there is a prophet\namong you, I, the LORD, make Myself\nknown to him in a vision; I speak to him\nin a dream.\nNot so with My servant Moses; He is\nfaithful in all My house.\nI speak with him face to face, Even\nplainly, and not in dark sayings; And he\nsees the form of the LORD. Why then\nwere you not afraid To speak against\nMy servant Moses?\"\nSo the anger of the LORD was aroused\nagainst them, and He departed.\nAnd when the cloud departed from\nabove the tabernacle, suddenly Miriam\nbecame leprous, as white as snow.\nThen Aaron turned toward Miriam, and\nthere she was, a leper.\nSo Aaron said to Moses, \"Oh, my lord!\nPlease do not lay this sin on us, in which\nwe have done foolishly and in which we\nhave sinned.\nPlease do not let her be as one dead,\nwhose flesh is half consumed when he\ncomes out of his mother's womb!\"\nSo Moses cried out to the LORD,\nsaying, \"Please heal her, O God, I pray!\"\nThen the LORD said to Moses, \"If her\nfather had but spit in her face, would\nshe not be shamed seven days? Let her\nbe shut out of the camp seven days,\nand afterward she may be received\nagain.\"\n13And the LORD spoke to Moses,\nsaying,\n\"Send men to spy out the land of\nCanaan, which I am giving to the\nchildren of Israel; from each tribe of their\nfathers you shall send a man, every one\na leader among them.\"\nSo Moses sent them from the\nWilderness of Paran according to the\ncommand of the LORD, all of them men\nwho were heads of the children of Israel.\nNow these were their names: from the\ntribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of\nZaccur;\nfrom the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the\nson of Hori;\nfrom the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son\nof Jephunneh;\nfrom the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son\nof Joseph;\nfrom the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the\nson of Nun;\nfrom the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son\nof Raphu;\nSo Miriam was shut out of the camp\nseven days, and the people did not\njourney till Miriam was brought in again.\nfrom the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the\nson of Sodi;\nAnd afterward the people moved from\nHazeroth and camped in the Wilderness\nof Paran.\nfrom the tribe of Joseph, that is, from\nthe tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of\nSusi;\nfrom the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son\nof Gemalli;\nwere there. (Now Hebron was built\nseven years before Zoan in Egypt.)\nfrom the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son\nof Michael;\nfrom the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the\nson of Vophsi;\nThen they came to the Valley of\nEshcol, and there cut down a branch\nwith one cluster of grapes; they carried it\nbetween two of them on a pole. They\nalso brought some of the pomegranates\nand figs.\nfrom the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of\nMachi.\nThese are the names of the men\nwhom Moses sent to spy out the land.\nAnd Moses called Hoshea the son of\nNun, Joshua.\nThen Moses sent them to spy out the\nland of Canaan, and said to them, \"Go\nup this way into the South, and go up to\nthe mountains,\nand see what the land is like: whether\nthe people who dwell in it are strong or\nweak, few or many;\nwhether the land they dwell in is good\nor bad; whether the cities they inhabit\nare like camps or strongholds;\nwhether the land is rich or poor; and\nwhether there are forests there or not.\nBe of good courage. And bring some of\nthe fruit of the land.\" Now the time was\nthe season of the first ripe grapes.\nSo they went up and spied out the\nland from the Wilderness of Zin as far as\nRehob, near the entrance of Hamath.\nAnd they went up through the South\nand came to Hebron; Ahiman, Sheshai,\nand Talmai, the descendants of Anak,\nThe place was called the Valley of\nEshcol, because of the cluster which the\nmen of Israel cut down there.\nAnd they returned from spying out the\nland after forty days.\nNow they departed and came back to\nMoses and Aaron and all the\ncongregation of the children of Israel in\nthe Wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh;\nthey brought back word to them and to\nall the congregation, and showed them\nthe fruit of the land.\nThen they told him, and said: \"We\nwent to the land where you sent us. It\ntruly flows with milk and honey, and this\nis its fruit.\nNevertheless the people who dwell in\nthe land are strong; the cities are\nfortified and very large; moreover we\nsaw the descendants of Anak there.\nThe Amalekites dwell in the land of the\nSouth; the Hittites, the Jebusites, and\nthe Amorites dwell in the mountains;\nand the Canaanites dwell by the sea\nand along the banks of the Jordan.\"\nThen Caleb quieted the people before\nMoses, and said, \"Let us go up at once\nand take possession, for we are well\nable to overcome it.\"\nThen Moses and Aaron fell on their\nfaces before all the assembly of the\ncongregation of the children of Israel.\nBut the men who had gone up with\nhim said, \"We are not able to go up\nagainst the people, for they are stronger\nthan we.\"\nBut Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb\nthe son of Jephunneh, who were among\nthose who had spied out the land, tore\ntheir clothes;\nAnd they gave the children of Israel a\nbad report of the land which they had\nspied out, saying, \"The land through\nwhich we have gone as spies is a land\nthat devours its inhabitants, and all the\npeople whom we saw in it are men of\ngreat stature.\nThere we saw the giants (the\ndescendants of Anak came from the\ngiants); and we were like grasshoppers\nin our own sight, and so we were in their\nsight.\"\n14So all the congregation lifted up\ntheir voices and cried, and the people\nwept that night.\nAnd all the children of Israel\ncomplained against Moses and Aaron,\nand the whole congregation said to\nthem, \"If only we had died in the land of\nEgypt! Or if only we had died in this\nwilderness!\nand they spoke to all the congregation\nof the children of Israel, saying: \"The\nland we passed through to spy out is an\nexceedingly good land.\nIf the LORD delights in us, then He will\nbring us into this land and give it to us,\n\"a land which flows with milk and honey.'\nOnly do not rebel against the LORD,\nnor fear the people of the land, for they\nare our bread; their protection has\ndeparted from them, and the LORD is\nwith us. Do not fear them.\"\nAnd all the congregation said to stone\nthem with stones. Now the glory of the\nLORD appeared in the tabernacle of\nmeeting before all the children of Israel.\nThen the LORD said to Moses: \"How\nlong will these people reject Me? And\nhow long will they not believe Me, with\nall the signs which I have performed\namong them?\nWhy has the LORD brought us to this\nland to fall by the sword, that our wives\nand children should become victims?\nWould it not be better for us to return to\nEgypt?\"\nI will strike them with the pestilence\nand disinherit them, and I will make of\nyou a nation greater and mightier than\nthey.\"\nSo they said to one another, \"Let us\nselect a leader and return to Egypt.\"\nAnd Moses said to the LORD: \"Then\nthe Egyptians will hear it, for by Your\nmight You brought these people up from\namong them,\nand they will tell it to the inhabitants of\nthis land. They have heard that You,\nLORD, are among these people; that\nYou, LORD, are seen face to face and\nYour cloud stands above them, and You\ngo before them in a pillar of cloud by\nday and in a pillar of fire by night.\nbecause all these men who have seen\nMy glory and the signs which I did in\nEgypt and in the wilderness, and have\nput Me to the test now these ten times,\nand have not heeded My voice,\nthey certainly shall not see the land of\nwhich I swore to their fathers, nor shall\nany of those who rejected Me see it.\nNow if You kill these people as one\nman, then the nations which have heard\nof Your fame will speak, saying,\nBut My servant Caleb, because he has\na different spirit in him and has followed\nMe fully, I will bring into the land where\nhe went, and his descendants shall\ninherit it.\n\"Because the LORD was not able to\nbring this people to the land which He\nswore to give them, therefore He killed\nthem in the wilderness.'\nNow the Amalekites and the\nCanaanites dwell in the valley; tomorrow\nturn and move out into the wilderness by\nthe Way of the Red Sea.\"\nAnd now, I pray, let the power of my\nLord be great, just as You have spoken,\nsaying,\nAnd the LORD spoke to Moses and\nAaron, saying,\n\"The LORD is longsuffering and\nabundant in mercy, forgiving iniquity and\ntransgression; but He by no means\nclears the guilty, visiting the iniquity of\nthe fathers on the children to the third\nand fourth generation.'\nPardon the iniquity of this people, I\npray, according to the greatness of Your\nmercy, just as You have forgiven this\npeople, from Egypt even until now.\"\nThen the LORD said: \"I have pardoned,\naccording to your word;\n\"How long shall I bear with this evil\ncongregation who complain against Me?\nI have heard the complaints which the\nchildren of Israel make against Me.\nSay to them, \"As I live,' says the LORD,\n\"just as you have spoken in My hearing,\nso I will do to you:\nThe carcasses of you who have\ncomplained against Me shall fall in this\nwilderness, all of you who were\nnumbered, according to your entire\nnumber, from twenty years old and\nabove.\nbut truly, as I live, all the earth shall be\nfilled with the glory of the LORD--\nExcept for Caleb the son of\nJephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun,\nyou shall by no means enter the land\nwhich I swore I would make you dwell in.\nThen Moses told these words to all the\nchildren of Israel, and the people\nmourned greatly.\nBut your little ones, whom you said\nwould be victims, I will bring in, and they\nshall know the land which you have\ndespised.\nBut as for you, your carcasses shall\nfall in this wilderness.\nAnd your sons shall be shepherds in\nthe wilderness forty years, and bear the\nbrunt of your infidelity, until your\ncarcasses are consumed in the\nwilderness.\nAnd they rose early in the morning and\nwent up to the top of the mountain,\nsaying, \"Here we are, and we will go up\nto the place which the LORD has\npromised, for we have sinned!\"\nAnd Moses said, \"Now why do you\ntransgress the command of the LORD?\nFor this will not succeed.\nDo not go up, lest you be defeated by\nyour enemies, for the LORD is not\namong you.\nAccording to the number of the days in\nwhich you spied out the land, forty days,\nfor each day you shall bear your guilt\none year, namely forty years, and you\nshall know My rejection.\nFor\nthe\nAmalekites\nand\nthe\nCanaanites are there before you, and\nyou shall fall by the sword; because you\nhave turned away from the LORD, the\nLORD will not be with you.\"\nI the LORD have spoken this. I will\nsurely do so to all this evil congregation\nwho are gathered together against Me.\nIn this wilderness they shall be\nconsumed, and there they shall die.\"'\nBut they presumed to go up to the\nmountaintop. Nevertheless, neither the\nark of the covenant of the LORD nor\nMoses departed from the camp.\nNow the men whom Moses sent to spy\nout the land, who returned and made all\nthe congregation complain against him\nby bringing a bad report of the land,\nThen the Amalekites and the\nCanaanites who dwelt in that mountain\ncame down and attacked them, and\ndrove them back as far as Hormah.\n15And the LORD spoke to Moses,\nthose very men who brought the evil\nreport about the land, died by the plague\nbefore the LORD.\nBut Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb\nthe son of Jephunneh remained alive, of\nthe men who went to spy out the land.\nsaying,\n\"Speak to the children of Israel, and\nsay to them: \"When you have come into\nthe land you are to inhabit, which I am\ngiving to you,\nand you make an offering by fire to the\nLORD, a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to\nfulfill a vow or as a freewill offering or in\nyour appointed feasts, to make a sweet\naroma to the LORD, from the herd or\nthe flock,\nthen he who presents his offering to the\nLORD shall bring a grain offering of onetenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed\nwith one-fourth of a hin of oil;\nand one-fourth of a hin of wine as a\ndrink offering you shall prepare with the\nburnt offering or the sacrifice, for each\nlamb.\nOr for a ram you shall prepare as a\ngrain offering two-tenths of an ephah of\nfine flour mixed with one-third of a hin of\noil;\n\"Thus it shall be done for each young\nbull, for each ram, or for each lamb or\nyoung goat.\nAccording to the number that you\nprepare, so you shall do with everyone\naccording to their number.\nAll who are native-born shall do these\nthings in this manner, in presenting an\noffering made by fire, a sweet aroma to\nthe LORD.\nAnd if a stranger dwells with you, or\nwhoever is among you throughout your\ngenerations, and would present an\noffering made by fire, a sweet aroma to\nthe LORD, just as you do, so shall he do.\nand as a drink offering you shall offer\none-third of a hin of wine as a sweet\naroma to the LORD.\nOne ordinance shall be for you of the\nassembly and for the stranger who\ndwells with you, an ordinance forever\nthroughout your generations;

they shall bring\ntheir offering, an offering made by fire to\nthe LORD, and their sin offering before\nthe LORD, for their unintended sin.\nIt shall be forgiven the whole\ncongregation of the children of Israel\nand the stranger who dwells among\nthem, because all the people did it\nunintentionally.\n\"And if a person sins unintentionally,\nthen he shall bring a female goat in its\nfirst year as a sin offering.\n\"But the person who does anything\npresumptuously, whether he is nativeborn or a stranger, that one brings\nreproach on the LORD, and he shall be\ncut off from among his people.\nBecause he has despised the word of\nthe LORD, and has broken His\ncommandment, that person shall be\ncompletely cut off; his guilt shall be upon\nhim.\"'\nNow while the children of Israel were\nin the wilderness, they found a man\ngathering sticks on the Sabbath day.\nAnd those who found him gathering\nsticks brought him to Moses and Aaron,\nand to all the congregation.\nThey put him under guard, because it\nhad not been explained what should be\ndone to him.\nThen the LORD said to Moses, \"The\nman must surely be put to death; all the\ncongregation shall stone him with\nstones outside the camp.\"\nSo, as the LORD commanded Moses,\nall the congregation brought him outside\nthe camp and stoned him with stones,\nand he died.\nAgain the LORD spoke to Moses,\nsaying,\n\"Speak to the children of Israel: Tell\nthem to make tassels on the corners of\ntheir\ngarments\nthroughout\ntheir\ngenerations, and to put a blue thread in\nthe tassels of the corners.\nAnd you shall have the tassel, that you\nmay look upon it and remember all the\ncommandments of the LORD and do\nthem, and that you may not follow the\nharlotry to which your own heart and\nyour own eyes are inclined,\ncongregation is holy, every one of them,\nand the LORD is among them. Why\nthen do you exalt yourselves above the\nassembly of the LORD?\"\nSo when Moses heard it, he fell on his\nface;\nand he spoke to Korah and all his\ncompany, saying, \"Tomorrow morning\nthe LORD will show who is His and who\nis holy, and will cause him to come near\nto Him. That one whom He chooses He\nwill cause to come near to Him.\nDo this: Take censers, Korah and all\nyour company;\nand that you may remember and do all\nMy commandments, and be holy for\nyour God.\nI am the LORD your God, who brought\nyou out of the land of Egypt, to be your\nGod: I am the LORD your God.\"\n16Now Korah the son of Izhar, the\nson of Kohath, the son of Levi, with\nDathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab,\nand On the son of Peleth, sons of\nReuben, took men;\nand they rose up before Moses with\nsome of the children of Israel, two\nhundred and fifty leaders of the\ncongregation, representatives of the\ncongregation, men of renown.\nThey gathered together against Moses\nand Aaron, and said to them, \"You take\ntoo much upon yourselves, for all the\nput fire in them and put incense in them\nbefore the LORD tomorrow, and it shall\nbe that the man whom the LORD\nchooses is the holy one. You take too\nmuch upon yourselves, you sons of\nLevi!\"\nThen Moses said to Korah, \"Hear now,\nyou sons of Levi:\nIs it a small thing to you that the God of\nIsrael has separated you from the\ncongregation of Israel, to bring you near\nto Himself, to do the work of the\ntabernacle of the LORD, and to stand\nbefore the congregation to serve them;\nand that He has brought you near to\nHimself, you and all your brethren, the\nsons of Levi, with you? And are you\nseeking the priesthood also?\nTherefore you and all your company\nare gathered together against the LORD.\nAnd what is Aaron that you complain\nagainst him?\"\nglory of the LORD appeared to all the\ncongregation.\nAnd Moses sent to call Dathan and\nAbiram the sons of Eliab, but they said,\n\"We will not come up!\nAnd the LORD spoke to Moses and\nAaron, saying,\nIs it a small thing that you have\nbrought us up out of a land flowing with\nmilk and honey, to kill us in the\nwilderness, that you should keep acting\nlike a prince over us?\nMoreover you have not brought us into\na land flowing with milk and honey, nor\ngiven us inheritance of fields and\nvineyards. Will you put out the eyes of\nthese men? We will not come up!\"\nThen Moses was very angry, and said\nto the LORD, \"Do not respect their\noffering. I have not taken one donkey\nfrom them, nor have I hurt one of them.\"\nAnd Moses said to Korah, \"Tomorrow,\nyou and all your company be present\nbefore the LORD--you and they, as well\nas Aaron.\nLet each take his censer and put\nincense in it, and each of you bring his\ncenser before the LORD, two hundred\nand fifty censers; both you and Aaron,\neach with his censer.\"\nSo every man took his censer, put fire\nin it, laid incense on it, and stood at the\ndoor of the tabernacle of meeting with\nMoses and Aaron.\nAnd\nKorah\ngathered\nall\nthe\ncongregation against them at the door of\nthe tabernacle of meeting. Then the\n\"Separate yourselves from among this\ncongregation, that I may consume them\nin a moment.\"\nThen they fell on their faces, and said,\n\"O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh,\nshall one man sin, and You be angry\nwith all the congregation?\"\nSo the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n\"Speak to the congregation, saying,\n\"Get away from the tents of Korah,\nDathan, and Abiram.\"'\nThen Moses rose and went to Dathan\nand Abiram, and the elders of Israel\nfollowed him.\nAnd he spoke to the congregation,\nsaying, \"Depart now from the tents of\nthese wicked men! Touch nothing of\ntheirs, lest you be consumed in all their\nsins.\"\nSo they got away from around the\ntents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and\nDathan and Abiram came out and stood\nat the door of their tents, with their wives,\ntheir sons, and their little children.\nAnd Moses said: \"By this you shall\nknow that the LORD has sent me to do\nall these works, for I have not done\nthem of my own will.\nIf these men die naturally like all men,\nor if they are visited by the common fate\nof all men, then the LORD has not sent\nme.\nBut if the LORD creates a new thing,\nand the earth opens its mouth and\nswallows them up with all that belongs\nto them, and they go down alive into the\npit, then you will understand that these\nmen have rejected the LORD.\"\nThe censers of these men who sinned\nagainst their own souls, let them be\nmade into hammered plates as a\ncovering for the altar. Because they\npresented them before the LORD,\ntherefore they are holy; and they shall\nbe a sign to the children of Israel.\"\nSo Eleazar the priest took the bronze\ncensers, which those who were burned\nup had presented, and they were\nhammered out as a covering on the altar,\nNow it came to pass, as he finished\nspeaking all these words, that the\nground split apart under them,\nand the earth opened its mouth and\nswallowed\nthem\nup,\nwith\ntheir\nhouseholds and all the men with Korah,\nwith all their goods.\nto be a memorial to the children of\nIsrael that no outsider, who is not a\ndescendant of Aaron, should come near\nto offer incense before the LORD, that\nhe might not become like Korah and his\ncompanions, just as the LORD had said\nto him through Moses.\nSo they and all those with them went\ndown alive into the pit; the earth closed\nover them, and they perished from\namong the assembly.\nOn the next day all the congregation of\nthe children of Israel complained against\nMoses and Aaron, saying, \"You have\nkilled the people of the LORD.\"\nThen all Israel who were around them\nfled at their cry, for they said, \"Lest the\nearth swallow us up also!\"\nAnd a fire came out from the LORD\nand consumed the two hundred and fifty\nmen who were offering incense.\nThen the LORD spoke to Moses,\nsaying:\nNow\nit\nhappened,\nwhen\nthe\ncongregation had gathered against\nMoses and Aaron, that they turned\ntoward the tabernacle of meeting; and\nsuddenly the cloud covered it, and the\nglory of the LORD appeared.\nThen Moses and Aaron came before\nthe tabernacle of meeting.\nAnd the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n\"Tell Eleazar, the son of Aaron the\npriest, to pick up the censers out of the\nblaze, for they are holy, and scatter the\nfire some distance away.\n\"Get\naway\nfrom\namong\nthis\ncongregation, that I may consume them\nin a moment.\" And they fell on their\nfaces.\nSo Moses said to Aaron, \"Take a\ncenser and put fire in it from the altar,\nput incense on it, and take it quickly to\nthe congregation and make atonement\nfor them; for wrath has gone out from\nthe LORD. The plague has begun.\"\nAnd it shall be that the rod of the man\nwhom I choose will blossom; thus I will\nrid Myself of the complaints of the\nchildren of Israel, which they make\nagainst you.\"\nThen Aaron took it as Moses\ncommanded, and ran into the midst of\nthe assembly; and already the plague\nhad begun among the people. So he put\nin the incense and made atonement for\nthe people.\nSo Moses spoke to the children of\nIsrael, and each of their leaders gave\nhim a rod apiece, for each leader\naccording to their fathers' houses,\ntwelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was\namong their rods.\nAnd he stood between the dead and\nthe living; so the plague was stopped.\nAnd Moses placed the rods before the\nLORD in the tabernacle of witness.\nNow those who died in the plague\nwere fourteen thousand seven hundred,\nbesides those who died in the Korah\nincident.\nNow it came to pass on the next day\nthat Moses went into the tabernacle of\nwitness, and behold, the rod of Aaron, of\nthe house of Levi, had sprouted and put\nforth buds, had produced blossoms and\nyielded ripe almonds.\nSo Aaron returned to Moses at the\ndoor of the tabernacle of meeting, for\nthe plague had stopped.\n17And the LORD spoke to Moses,\nsaying:\n\"Speak to the children of Israel, and get\nfrom them a rod from each father's\nhouse, all their leaders according to\ntheir fathers' houses--twelve rods. Write\neach man's name on his rod.\nAnd you shall write Aaron's name on\nthe rod of Levi. For there shall be one\nrod for the head of each father's house.\nThen you shall place them in the\ntabernacle of meeting before the\nTestimony, where I meet with you.\nThen Moses brought out all the rods\nfrom before the LORD to all the children\nof Israel; and they looked, and each\nman took his rod.\nAnd the LORD said to Moses, \"Bring\nAaron's rod back before the Testimony,\nto be kept as a sign against the rebels,\nthat you may put their complaints away\nfrom Me, lest they die.\"\nThus did Moses; just as the LORD had\ncommanded him, so he did.\nSo the children of Israel spoke to\nMoses, saying, \"Surely we die, we\nperish, we all perish!\nWhoever even comes near the\ntabernacle of the LORD must die. Shall\nwe all utterly die?\"\n18Then the LORD said to Aaron:\n\"You and your sons and your father's\nhouse with you shall bear the iniquity\nrelated to the sanctuary, and you and\nyour sons with you shall bear the iniquity\nassociated with your priesthood.\nAlso bring with you your brethren of the\ntribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that\nthey may be joined with you and serve\nyou while you and your sons are with\nyou before the tabernacle of witness.\nThey shall attend to your needs and all\nthe needs of the tabernacle; but they\nshall not come near the articles of the\nsanctuary and the altar, lest they die-they and you also.\nThey shall be joined with you and\nattend to the needs of the tabernacle of\nmeeting, for all the work of the\ntabernacle; but an outsider shall not\ncome near you.\nAnd you shall attend to the duties of the\nsanctuary and the duties of the altar,\nthat there may be no more wrath on the\nchildren of Israel.\nBehold, I Myself have taken your\nbrethren the Levites from among the\nchildren of Israel; they are a gift to you,\ngiven by the LORD, to do the work of\nthe tabernacle of meeting.\nTherefore you and your sons with you\nshall attend to your priesthood for\neverything at the altar and behind the\nveil; and you shall serve. I give your\npriesthood to you as a gift for service,\nbut the outsider who comes near shall\nbe put to death.\"\nAnd the LORD spoke to Aaron: \"Here, I\nMyself have also given you charge of\nMy heave offerings, all the holy gifts of\nthe children of Israel; I have given them\nas a portion to you and your sons, as an\nordinance forever.\nThis shall be yours of the most holy\nthings reserved from the fire: every\noffering of theirs, every grain offering\nand every sin offering and every\ntrespass offering which they render to\nMe, shall be most holy for you and your\nsons.\nIn a most holy place you shall eat it;\nevery male shall eat it. It shall be holy to\nyou.\n\"This also is yours: the heave offering\nof their gift, with all the wave offerings of\nthe children of Israel; I have given them\nto you, and your sons and daughters\nwith you, as an ordinance forever.\neveryone who is clean in your house\nmay eat it.\n\"All the best of the oil, all the best of\nthe new wine and the grain, their\nfirstfruits which they offer to the LORD, I\nhave given them to you.\nWhatever first ripe fruit is in their land,\nwhich they bring to the LORD, shall be\nyours.

You\nshall sprinkle their blood on the altar,\nand burn their fat as an offering made\nby fire for a sweet aroma to the LORD.\nFor the tithes of the children of Israel,\nwhich they offer up as a heave offering\nto the LORD, I have given to the Levites\nas an inheritance; therefore I have said\nto them, \"Among the children of Israel\nthey shall have no inheritance.\"'\nAnd their flesh shall be yours, just as\nthe wave breast and the right thigh are\nyours.\n\"All the heave offerings of the holy\nthings, which the children of Israel offer\nto the LORD, I have given to you and\nyour sons and daughters with you as an\nordinance forever; it is a covenant of salt\nforever before the LORD with you and\nyour descendants with you.\"\nThen the LORD said to Aaron: \"You\nshall have no inheritance in their land,\nnor shall you have any portion among\nthem; I am your portion and your\ninheritance among the children of Israel.\nThen the LORD spoke to Moses,\nsaying,\n\"Speak thus to the Levites, and say to\nthem: \"When you take from the children\nof Israel the tithes which I have given\nyou from them as your inheritance, then\nyou shall offer up a heave offering of it\nto the LORD, a tenth of the tithe.\nAnd your heave offering shall be\nreckoned to you as though it were the\ngrain of the threshing floor and as the\nfullness of the winepress.\nThus you shall also offer a heave\noffering to the LORD from all your tithes\nwhich you receive from the children of\nIsrael, and you shall give the LORD's\nheave offering from it to Aaron the priest.\nThen the heifer shall be burned in his\nsight: its hide, its flesh, its blood, and its\noffal shall be burned.\nOf all your gifts you shall offer up\nevery heave offering due to the LORD,\nfrom all the best of them, the\nconsecrated part of them.'\nAnd the priest shall take cedar wood\nand hyssop and scarlet, and cast them\ninto the midst of the fire burning the\nheifer.\nTherefore you shall say to them:\n\"When you have lifted up the best of it,\nthen the rest shall be accounted to the\nLevites as the produce of the threshing\nfloor and as the produce of the\nwinepress.\nThen the priest shall wash his clothes,\nhe shall bathe in water, and afterward\nhe shall come into the camp; the priest\nshall be unclean until evening.\nYou may eat it in any place, you and\nyour households, for it is your reward for\nyour work in the tabernacle of meeting.\nAnd the one who burns it shall wash his\nclothes in water, bathe in water, and\nshall be unclean until evening.\nAnd you shall bear no sin because of it,\nwhen you have lifted up the best of it.\nBut you shall not profane the holy gifts\nof the children of Israel, lest you die.\"'\n19Now the LORD spoke to Moses\nand Aaron, saying,\n\"This is the ordinance of the law which\nthe LORD has commanded, saying:\n\"Speak to the children of Israel, that they\nbring you a red heifer without blemish, in\nwhich there is no defect and on which a\nyoke has never come.\nYou shall give it to Eleazar the priest,\nthat he may take it outside the camp,\nand it shall be slaughtered before him;\nand Eleazar the priest shall take some\nof its blood with his finger, and sprinkle\nsome of its blood seven times directly in\nfront of the tabernacle of meeting.\nThen a man who is clean shall gather\nup the ashes of the heifer, and store\nthem outside the camp in a clean place;\nand they shall be kept for the\ncongregation of the children of Israel for\nthe water of purification; it is for purifying\nfrom sin.\nAnd the one who gathers the ashes of\nthe heifer shall wash his clothes, and be\nunclean until evening.

It is not a place of grain or figs or\nvines or pomegranates; nor is there any\nwater to drink.\"\nSo Moses and Aaron went from the\npresence of the assembly to the door of\nthe tabernacle of meeting, and they fell\non their faces. And the glory of the\nLORD appeared to them.\nyour brother Israel: \"You know all the\nhardship that has befallen us,\nThen the LORD spoke to Moses,\nsaying,\nhow our fathers went down to Egypt,\nand we dwelt in Egypt a long time, and\nthe Egyptians afflicted us and our\nfathers.\n\"Take the rod; you and your brother\nAaron gather the congregation together.\nSpeak to the rock before their eyes, and\nit will yield its water; thus you shall bring\nwater for them out of the rock, and give\ndrink to the congregation and their\nanimals.\"\nWhen we cried out to the LORD, He\nheard our voice and sent the Angel and\nbrought us up out of Egypt; now here we\nare in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your\nborder.\nSo Moses took the rod from before the\nLORD as He commanded him.\nAnd Moses and Aaron gathered the\nassembly together before the rock; and\nhe said to them, \"Hear now, you rebels!\nMust we bring water for you out of this\nrock?\"\nThen Moses lifted his hand and struck\nthe rock twice with his rod; and water\ncame out abundantly, and the\ncongregation and their animals drank.\nThen the LORD spoke to Moses and\nAaron, \"Because you did not believe Me,\nto hallow Me in the eyes of the children\nof Israel, therefore you shall not bring\nthis assembly into the land which I have\ngiven them.\"\nPlease let us pass through your\ncountry. We will not pass through fields\nor vineyards, nor will we drink water\nfrom wells; we will go along the King's\nHighway; we will not turn aside to the\nright hand or to the left until we have\npassed through your territory.\"'\nThen Edom said to him, \"You shall not\npass through my land, lest I come out\nagainst you with the sword.\"\nSo the children of Israel said to him,\n\"We will go by the Highway, and if I or\nmy livestock drink any of your water,\nthen I will pay for it; let me only pass\nthrough on foot, nothing more.\"\nThen he said, \"You shall not pass\nthrough.\" So Edom came out against\nthem with many men and with a strong\nhand.\nThis was the water of Meribah,\nbecause\nthe\nchildren\nof\nIsrael\ncontended with the LORD, and He was\nhallowed among them.\nNow Moses sent messengers from\nKadesh to the king of Edom. \"Thus says\nThus Edom refused to give Israel\npassage through his territory; so Israel\nturned away from him.\nNow the children of Israel, the whole\ncongregation, journeyed from Kadesh\nand came to Mount Hor.\nSo Israel made a vow to the LORD,\nand said, \"If You will indeed deliver this\npeople into my hand, then I will utterly\ndestroy their cities.\"\nAnd the LORD spoke to Moses and\nAaron in Mount Hor by the border of the\nland of Edom, saying:\n\"Aaron shall be gathered to his people,\nfor he shall not enter the land which I\nhave given to the children of Israel,\nbecause you rebelled against My word\nat the water of Meribah.\nAnd the LORD listened to the voice of\nIsrael and delivered up the Canaanites,\nand they utterly destroyed them and\ntheir cities. So the name of that place\nwas called Hormah.\nTake Aaron and Eleazar his son, and\nbring them up to Mount Hor;\nThen they journeyed from Mount Hor\nby the Way of the Red Sea, to go\naround the land of Edom; and the soul\nof the people became very discouraged\non the way.\nand strip Aaron of his garments and\nput them on Eleazar his son; for Aaron\nshall be gathered to his people and die\nthere.\"\nSo Moses did just as the LORD\ncommanded, and they went up to Mount\nHor in the sight of all the congregation.\nMoses stripped Aaron of his garments\nand put them on Eleazar his son; and\nAaron died there on the top of the\nmountain. Then Moses and Eleazar\ncame down from the mountain.\nNow when all the congregation saw\nthat Aaron was dead, all the house of\nIsrael mourned for Aaron thirty days.\nAnd the people spoke against God and\nagainst Moses: \"Why have you brought\nus up out of Egypt to die in the\nwilderness? For there is no food and no\nwater, and our soul loathes this\nworthless bread.\"\nSo the LORD sent fiery serpents\namong the people, and they bit the\npeople; and many of the people of Israel\ndied.\nTherefore the people came to Moses,\nand said, \"We have sinned, for we have\nspoken against the LORD and against\nyou; pray to the LORD that He take\naway the serpents from us.\" So Moses\nprayed for the people.\n21The king of Arad, the Canaanite,\nwho dwelt in the South, heard that Israel\nwas coming on the road to Atharim.\nThen he fought against Israel and took\nsome of them prisoners.\nThen the LORD said to Moses, \"Make\na fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and\nit shall be that everyone who is bitten,\nwhen he looks at it, shall live.\"\nSo Moses made a bronze serpent, and\nput it on a pole; and so it was, if a\nserpent had bitten anyone, when he\nlooked at the bronze serpent, he lived.\nfrom Mattanah to\nNahaliel to Bamoth,\nNow the children of Israel moved on\nand camped in Oboth.\nAnd they journeyed from Oboth and\ncamped at Ije Abarim, in the wilderness\nwhich is east of Moab, toward the\nsunrise.\nFrom there they moved and camped in\nthe Valley of Zered.\nFrom there they moved and camped\non the other side of the Arnon, which is\nin the wilderness that extends from the\nborder of the Amorites; for the Arnon is\nthe border of Moab, between Moab and\nthe Amorites.\nNahaliel,\nfrom\nand from Bamoth, in the valley that is\nin the country of Moab, to the top of\nPisgah which looks down on the\nwasteland.\nThen Israel sent messengers to Sihon\nking of the Amorites, saying,\n\"Let me pass through your land. We\nwill not turn aside into fields or\nvineyards; we will not drink water from\nwells. We will go by the King's Highway\nuntil we have passed through your\nterritory.\"\nTherefore it is said in the Book of the\nWars of the LORD: \"Waheb in Suphah,\nThe brooks of the Arnon,\nBut Sihon would not allow Israel to\npass through his territory. So Sihon\ngathered all his people together and\nwent out against Israel in the wilderness,\nand he came to Jahaz and fought\nagainst Israel.\nAnd the slope of the brooks That\nreaches to the dwelling of Ar, And lies\non the border of Moab.\"\nFrom there they went to Beer, which is\nthe well where the LORD said to Moses,\n\"Gather the people together, and I will\ngive them water.\"\nThen Israel sang this song: \"Spring up,\nO well! All of you sing to it-18\nThe well the leaders sank, Dug by the\nnation's nobles, By the lawgiver, with\ntheir staves.\" And from the wilderness\nthey went to Mattanah,\nThen Israel defeated him with the\nedge of the sword, and took possession\nof his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok,\nas far as the people of Ammon; for the\nborder of the people of Ammon was\nfortified.\nSo Israel took all these cities, and\nIsrael dwelt in all the cities of the\nAmorites, in Heshbon and in all its\nvillages.\nFor Heshbon was the city of Sihon\nking of the Amorites, who had fought\nagainst the former king of Moab, and\nhad taken all his land from his hand as\nfar as the Arnon.\nTherefore those who speak in\nproverbs say: \"Come to Heshbon, let it\nbe built; Let the city of Sihon be repaired.\n\"For fire went out from Heshbon, A\nflame from the city of Sihon; It\nconsumed Ar of Moab, The lords of the\nheights of the Arnon.\nWoe to you, Moab! You have perished,\nO people of Chemosh! He has given his\nsons as fugitives, And his daughters into\ncaptivity, To Sihon king of the Amorites.\n\"But we have shot at them; Heshbon\nhas perished as far as Dibon. Then we\nlaid waste as far as Nophah, Which\nreaches to Medeba.\"\nThus Israel dwelt in the land of the\nAmorites.\n22Then the children of Israel moved,\nand camped in the plains of Moab on\nthe side of the Jordan across from\nJericho.\nNow Balak the son of Zippor saw all\nthat Israel had done to the Amorites.\nAnd Moab was exceedingly afraid of\nthe people because they were many,\nand Moab was sick with dread because\nof the children of Israel.\nSo Moab said to the elders of Midian,\n\"Now this company will lick up\neverything around us, as an ox licks up\nthe grass of the field.\" And Balak the\nson of Zippor was king of the Moabites\nat that time.\nThen Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and\nthey took its villages and drove out the\nAmorites who were there.\nAnd they turned and went up by the\nway to Bashan. So Og king of Bashan\nwent out against them, he and all his\npeople, to battle at Edrei.\nThen the LORD said to Moses, \"Do\nnot fear him, for I have delivered him\ninto your hand, with all his people and\nhis land; and you shall do to him as you\ndid to Sihon king of the Amorites, who\ndwelt at Heshbon.\"\nThen he sent messengers to Balaam\nthe son of Beor at Pethor, which is near\nthe River in the land of the sons of his\npeople, to call him, saying: \"Look, a\npeople has come from Egypt. See, they\ncover the face of the earth, and are\nsettling next to me!\nTherefore please come at once, curse\nthis people for me, for they are too\nmighty for me. Perhaps I shall be able to\ndefeat them and drive them out of the\nland, for I know that he whom you bless\nis blessed, and he whom you curse is\ncursed.\"\nSo they defeated him, his sons, and all\nhis people, until there was no survivor\nleft him; and they took possession of his\nland.\nSo the elders of Moab and the elders of\nMidian departed with the diviner's fee in\ntheir hand, and they came to Balaam\nand spoke to him the words of Balak.\nAnd he said to them, \"Lodge here\ntonight, and I will bring back word to you,\nas the LORD speaks to me.\" So the\nprinces of Moab stayed with Balaam.\nThen God came to Balaam and said,\n\"Who are these men with you?\"\nSo Balaam said to God, \"Balak the son\nof Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me,\nsaying,\n\"Look, a people has come out of Egypt,\nand they cover the face of the earth.\nCome now, curse them for me; perhaps\nI shall be able to overpower them and\ndrive them out.\"'\nTherefore please come, curse this\npeople for me.\"'\nThen Balaam answered and said to\nthe servants of Balak, \"Though Balak\nwere to give me his house full of silver\nand gold, I could not go beyond the\nword of the LORD my God, to do less or\nmore.\nNow therefore, please, you also stay\nhere tonight, that I may know what more\nthe LORD will say to me.\"\nAnd God came to Balaam at night and\nsaid to him, \"If the men come to call you,\nrise and go with them; but only the word\nwhich I speak to you--that you shall do.\"\nAnd God said to Balaam, \"You shall\nnot go with them; you shall not curse the\npeople, for they are blessed.\"\nSo Balaam rose in the morning,\nsaddled his donkey, and went with the\nprinces of Moab.\nSo Balaam rose in the morning and\nsaid to the princes of Balak, \"Go back to\nyour land, for the LORD has refused to\ngive me permission to go with you.\"\nAnd the princes of Moab rose and\nwent to Balak, and said, \"Balaam\nrefuses to come with us.\"\nThen Balak again sent princes, more\nnumerous and more honorable than\nthey.\nAnd they came to Balaam and said to\nhim, \"Thus says Balak the son of Zippor:\n\"Please let nothing hinder you from\ncoming to me;\nfor I will certainly honor you greatly,\nand I will do whatever you say to me.\nThen God's anger was aroused\nbecause he went, and the Angel of the\nLORD took His stand in the way as an\nadversary against him. And he was\nriding on his donkey, and his two\nservants were with him.\nNow the donkey saw the Angel of the\nLORD standing in the way with His\ndrawn sword in His hand, and the\ndonkey turned aside out of the way and\nwent into the field. So Balaam struck the\ndonkey to turn her back onto the road.\nThen the Angel of the LORD stood in a\nnarrow path between the vineyards, with\na wall on this side and a wall on that\nside.\nAnd when the donkey saw the Angel\nof the LORD, she pushed herself\nagainst the wall and crushed Balaam's\nfoot against the wall; so he struck her\nagain.\nThen the Angel of the LORD went\nfurther, and stood in a narrow place\nwhere there was no way to turn either to\nthe right hand or to the left.\nAnd when the donkey saw the Angel\nof the LORD, she lay down under\nBalaam; so Balaam's anger was\naroused, and he struck the donkey with\nhis staff.\nThen the LORD opened the mouth of\nthe donkey, and she said to Balaam,\n\"What have I done to you, that you have\nstruck me these three times?\"\nout to stand against you, because your\nway is perverse before Me.\nThe donkey saw Me and turned aside\nfrom Me these three times. If she had\nnot turned aside from Me, surely I would\nalso have killed you by now, and let her\nlive.\"\nAnd Balaam said to the Angel of the\nLORD, \"I have sinned, for I did not know\nYou stood in the way against me. Now\ntherefore, if it displeases You, I will turn\nback.\"\nThen the Angel of the LORD said to\nBalaam, \"Go with the men, but only the\nword that I speak to you, that you shall\nspeak.\" So Balaam went with the\nprinces of Balak.\nAnd Balaam said to the donkey,\n\"Because you have abused me. I wish\nthere were a sword in my hand, for now\nI would kill you!\"\nNow when Balak heard that Balaam\nwas coming, he went out to meet him at\nthe city of Moab, which is on the border\nat the Arnon, the boundary of the\nterritory.\nSo the donkey said to Balaam, \"Am I\nnot your donkey on which you have\nridden, ever since I became yours, to\nthis day? Was I ever disposed to do this\nto you?\" And he said, \"No.\"\nThen Balak said to Balaam, \"Did I not\nearnestly send to you, calling for you?\nWhy did you not come to me? Am I not\nable to honor you?\"\nThen the LORD opened Balaam's\neyes, and he saw the Angel of the\nLORD standing in the way with His\ndrawn sword in His hand; and he bowed\nhis head and fell flat on his face.\nAnd Balaam said to Balak, \"Look, I\nhave come to you!

And\nBalak said to him, \"What has the LORD\nspoken?\"\nThen he took up his oracle and said:\n\"Rise up, Balak, and hear!

So the plague was\nstopped among the children of Israel.\nAnd those who died in the plague were\ntwenty-four thousand.\nThen the LORD spoke to Moses,\nsaying:\n\"Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son\nof Aaron the priest, has turned back My\nwrath from the children of Israel,\nbecause he was zealous with My zeal\namong them, so that I did not consume\nthe children of Israel in My zeal.\nTherefore say, \"Behold, I give to him\nMy covenant of peace;\nand it shall be to him and his\ndescendants after him a covenant of an\neverlasting priesthood, because he was\nzealous for his God, and made\natonement for the children of Israel.\"'\nNow the name of the Israelite who was\nkilled, who was killed with the Midianite\nwoman, was Zimri the son of Salu, a\nleader of a father's house among the\nSimeonites.\nReuben was the firstborn of Israel.

He will be with you, He\nwill not leave you nor forsake you; do\nnot fear nor be dismayed.\"\nSo Moses wrote this law and delivered\nit to the priests, the sons of Levi, who\nbore the ark of the covenant of the\nLORD, and to all the elders of Israel.\nAnd the LORD said to Moses: \"Behold,\nyou will rest with your fathers; and this\npeople will rise and play the harlot with\nthe gods of the foreigners of the land,\nwhere they go to be among them, and\nthey will forsake Me and break My\ncovenant which I have made with them.\nAnd Moses commanded them, saying:\n\"At the end of every seven years, at the\nappointed time in the year of release, at\nthe Feast of Tabernacles,\nwhen all Israel comes to appear before\nthe LORD your God in the place which\nHe chooses, you shall read this law\nbefore all Israel in their hearing.\nGather the people together, men and\nwomen and little ones, and the stranger\nwho is within your gates, that they may\nhear and that they may learn to fear the\nLORD your God and carefully observe\nall the words of this law,\nand that their children, who have not\nknown it, may hear and learn to fear the\nLORD your God as long as you live in\nthe land which you cross the Jordan to\npossess.\"\nThen the LORD said to Moses,\n\"Behold, the days approach when you\nmust die; call Joshua, and present\nyourselves in the tabernacle of meeting,\nthat I may inaugurate him.\" So Moses\nand Joshua went and presented\nthemselves in the tabernacle of meeting.\nNow the LORD appeared at the\ntabernacle in a pillar of cloud, and the\npillar of cloud stood above the door of\nthe tabernacle.\nThen My anger shall be aroused\nagainst them in that day, and I will\nforsake them, and I will hide My face\nfrom them, and they shall be devoured.\nAnd many evils and troubles shall befall\nthem, so that they will say in that day,\n\"Have not these evils come upon us\nbecause our God is not among us?'\nAnd I will surely hide My face in that\nday because of all the evil which they\nhave done, in that they have turned to\nother gods.\n\"Now therefore, write down this song\nfor yourselves, and teach it to the\nchildren of Israel; put it in their mouths,\nthat this song may be a witness for Me\nagainst the children of Israel.\nWhen I have brought them to the land\nflowing with milk and honey, of which I\nswore to their fathers, and they have\neaten and filled themselves and grown\nfat, then they will turn to other gods and\nserve them; and they will provoke Me\nand break My covenant.\nThen it shall be, when many evils and\ntroubles have come upon them, that this\nsong will testify against them as a\nwitness; for it will not be forgotten in the\nmouths of their descendants, for I know\nthe inclination of their behavior today,\neven before I have brought them to the\nland of which I swore to give them.\"\nTherefore Moses wrote this song the\nsame day, and taught it to the children\nof Israel.\nThen Moses spoke in the hearing of all\nthe assembly of Israel the words of this\nsong until they were ended:\n32\"Give ear, O heavens, and I will\nThen He inaugurated Joshua the son\nof Nun, and said, \"Be strong and of\ngood courage; for you shall bring the\nchildren of Israel into the land of which I\nswore to them, and I will be with you.\"\nSo it was, when Moses had completed\nwriting the words of this law in a book,\nwhen they were finished,\nthat Moses commanded the Levites,\nwho bore the ark of the covenant of the\nLORD, saying:\n\"Take this Book of the Law, and put it\nbeside the ark of the covenant of the\nLORD your God, that it may be there as\na witness against you;\nfor I know your rebellion and your stiff\nneck. If today, while I am yet alive with\nyou, you have been rebellious against\nthe LORD, then how much more after\nmy death?\nGather to me all the elders of your\ntribes, and your officers, that I may\nspeak these words in their hearing and\ncall heaven and earth to witness against\nthem.\nFor I know that after my death you will\nbecome utterly corrupt, and turn aside\nfrom the way which I have commanded\nyou. And evil will befall you in the latter\ndays, because you will do evil in the\nsight of the LORD, to provoke Him to\nanger through the work of your hands.\"\nspeak; And hear, O earth, the words of\nmy mouth.\nLet my teaching drop as the rain, My\nspeech distill as the dew, As raindrops\non the tender herb, And as showers on\nthe grass.\nFor I proclaim the name of the LORD:\nAscribe greatness to our God.\nHe is the Rock, His work is perfect; For\nall His ways are justice, A God of truth\nand without injustice; Righteous and\nupright is He.\n\"They have corrupted themselves;\nThey are not His children, Because of\ntheir blemish: A perverse and crooked\ngeneration.\nDo you thus deal with the LORD, O\nfoolish and unwise people? Is He not\nyour Father, who bought you? Has He\nnot made you and established you?\n\"Remember the days of old, Consider\nthe years of many generations. Ask your\nfather, and he will show you; Your\nelders, and they will tell you:\nWhen the Most High divided their\ninheritance to the nations, When He\nseparated the sons of Adam, He set the\nboundaries of the peoples According to\nthe number of the children of Israel.\nFor the LORD's portion is His people;\nJacob is the place of His inheritance.\nOf the Rock who begot you, you are\nunmindful, And have forgotten the God\nwho fathered you.\n\"He found him in a desert land And in\nthe wasteland, a howling wilderness; He\nencircled him, He instructed him, He\nkept him as the apple of His eye.\n\"And when the LORD saw it, He\nspurned them, Because of the\nprovocation of His sons and His\ndaughters.\nAs an eagle stirs up its nest, Hovers\nover its young, Spreading out its wings,\ntaking them up, Carrying them on its\nwings,\nAnd He said: \"I will hide My face from\nthem, I will see what their end will be,\nFor they are a perverse generation,\nChildren in whom is no faith.\nSo the LORD alone led him, And there\nwas no foreign god with him.\n\"He made him ride in the heights of the\nearth, That he might eat the produce of\nthe fields; He made him draw honey\nfrom the rock, And oil from the flinty\nrock;\nCurds from the cattle, and milk of the\nflock, With fat of lambs; And rams of the\nbreed of Bashan, and goats, With the\nchoicest wheat; And you drank wine, the\nblood of the grapes.\n\"But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked;\nYou grew fat, you grew thick, You are\nobese! Then he forsook God who made\nhim, And scornfully esteemed the Rock\nof his salvation.\nThey provoked Him to jealousy with\nforeign gods; With abominations they\nprovoked Him to anger.\nThey sacrificed to demons, not to God,\nTo gods they did not know, To new gods,\nnew arrivals That your fathers did not\nfear.\nThey have provoked Me to jealousy by\nwhat is not God; They have moved Me\nto anger by their foolish idols. But I will\nprovoke them to jealousy by those who\nare not a nation; I will move them to\nanger by a foolish nation.\nFor a fire is kindled in My anger, And\nshall burn to the lowest hell; It shall\nconsume the earth with her increase,\nAnd set on fire the foundations of the\nmountains.\n\"I will heap disasters on them;

view the\nland of Canaan, which I give to the\nchildren of Israel as a possession;\nand die on the mountain which you\nascend, and be gathered to your people,\njust as Aaron your brother died on\nMount Hor and was gathered to his\npeople;\nbecause you trespassed against Me\namong the children of Israel at the\nwaters of Meribah Kadesh, in the\nWilderness of Zin, because you did not\nhallow Me in the midst of the children of\nIsrael.\nYet you shall see the land before you,\nthough you shall not go there, into the\nland which I am giving to the children of\nIsrael.\"\nAnd he said: \"The LORD came from\nSinai, And dawned on them from Seir;\nHe shone forth from Mount Paran, And\nHe came with ten thousands of saints;\nFrom His right hand Came a fiery law for\nthem.\nYes, He loves the people; All His saints\nare in Your hand; They sit down at Your\nfeet; everyone receives Your words.\nMoses commanded a law for us, A\nheritage of the congregation of Jacob.\nAnd He was King in Jeshurun, When\nthe leaders of the people were gathered,\nAll the tribes of Israel together.\n\"Let Reuben live, and not die, Nor let\nhis men be few.\"\nAnd this he said of Judah: \"Hear,\nLORD, the voice of Judah, And bring\nhim to his people; Let his hands be\nsufficient for him, And may You be a\nhelp against his enemies.\"\nAnd of Levi he said: \"Let Your\nThummim and Your Urim be with Your\nholy one, Whom You tested at Massah,\nAnd with whom You contended at the\nwaters of Meribah,\nWho says of his father and mother, \"I\nhave not seen them'; Nor did he\nacknowledge his brothers, Or know his\nown children; For they have observed\nYour word And kept Your covenant.\nThey shall teach Jacob Your\njudgments, And Israel Your law. They\nshall put incense before You, And a\nwhole burnt sacrifice on Your altar.\nAnd of Zebulun he said: \"Rejoice,\nZebulun, in your going out, And Issachar\nin your tents!\nBless his substance, LORD, And\naccept the work of his hands; Strike the\nloins of those who rise against him, And\nof those who hate him, that they rise not\nagain.\"\nThey shall call the peoples to the\nmountain; There they shall offer\nsacrifices of righteousness; For they\nshall partake of the abundance of the\nseas And of treasures hidden in the\nsand.\"\nOf Benjamin he said: \"The beloved of\nthe LORD shall dwell in safety by Him,\nWho shelters him all the day long; And\nhe shall dwell between His shoulders.\"\nAnd of Gad he said: \"Blessed is he\nwho enlarges Gad; He dwells as a lion,\nAnd tears the arm and the crown of his\nhead.\nAnd of Joseph he said: \"Blessed of the\nLORD is his land, With the precious\nthings of heaven, with the dew, And the\ndeep lying beneath,\nWith the precious fruits of the sun,\nWith the precious produce of the months,\nWith the best things of the ancient\nmountains, With the precious things of\nthe everlasting hills,\nWith the precious things of the earth\nand its fullness, And the favor of Him\nwho dwelt in the bush. Let the blessing\ncome \"on the head of Joseph, And on\nthe crown of the head of him who was\nseparate from his brothers.'\nHe provided the first part for himself,\nBecause a lawgiver's portion was\nreserved there. He came with the heads\nof the people; He administered the\njustice of the LORD, And His judgments\nwith Israel.\"\nAnd of Dan he said: \"Dan is a lion's\nwhelp; He shall leap from Bashan.\"\nAnd of Naphtali he said: \"O Naphtali,\nsatisfied with favor, And full of the\nblessing of the LORD, Possess the west\nand the south.\"\nAnd of Asher he said: \"Asher is most\nblessed of sons; Let him be favored by\nhis brothers, And let him dip his foot in\noil.\nHis glory is like a firstborn bull, And his\nhorns like the horns of the wild ox;\nTogether with them He shall push the\npeoples To the ends of the earth; They\nare the ten thousands of Ephraim, And\nthey are the thousands of Manasseh.\"\nYour sandals shall be iron and bronze;\nAs your days, so shall your strength be.\n\"There is no one like the God of\nJeshurun, Who rides the heavens to\nhelp you, And in His excellency on the\nclouds.\nThe eternal God is your refuge, And\nunderneath are the everlasting arms; He\nwill thrust out the enemy from before\nyou, And will say, \"Destroy!'\nSo Moses the servant of the LORD\ndied there in the land of Moab,\naccording to the word of the LORD.\nThen Israel shall dwell in safety, The\nfountain of Jacob alone, In a land of\ngrain and new wine; His heavens shall\nalso drop dew.\nHappy are you, O Israel! Who is like\nyou, a people saved by the LORD, The\nshield of your help And the sword of\nyour majesty! Your enemies shall submit\nto you, And you shall tread down their\nhigh places.\"\n34Then Moses went up from the\nplains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the\ntop of Pisgah, which is across from\nJericho. And the LORD showed him all\nthe land of Gilead as far as Dan,\nall Naphtali and the land of Ephraim\nand Manasseh, all the land of Judah as\nfar as the Western Sea,\nAnd He buried him in a valley in the\nland of Moab, opposite Beth Peor; but\nno one knows his grave to this day.\nMoses was one hundred and twenty\nyears old when he died. His eyes were\nnot dim nor his natural vigor diminished.\nAnd the children of Israel wept for\nMoses in the plains of Moab thirty days.\nSo the days of weeping and mourning\nfor Moses ended.\nNow Joshua the son of Nun was full of\nthe spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid\nhis hands on him; so the children of\nIsrael heeded him, and did as the LORD\nhad commanded Moses.\nBut since then there has not arisen in\nIsrael a prophet like Moses, whom the\nLORD knew face to face,\nthe South, and the plain of the Valley of\nJericho, the city of palm trees, as far as\nZoar.\nin all the signs and wonders which the\nLORD sent him to do in the land of\nEgypt, before Pharaoh, before all his\nservants, and in all his land,\nThen the LORD said to him, \"This is the\nland of which I swore to give Abraham,\nIsaac, and Jacob, saying, \"I will give it to\nyour descendants.' I have caused you to\nsee it with your eyes, but you shall not\ncross over there.\"\nand by all that mighty power and all\nthe great terror which Moses performed\nin the sight of all Israel.\nJoshua\n1After the death of Moses the servant\nof the LORD, it came to pass that the\nLORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun,\nMoses' assistant, saying:\n\"Moses My servant is dead. Now\ntherefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you\nand all this people, to the land which I\nam giving to them--the children of Israel.\nEvery place that the sole of your foot\nwill tread upon I have given you, as I\nsaid to Moses.\nFrom the wilderness and this Lebanon\nas far as the great river, the River\nEuphrates, all the land of the Hittites,\nand to the Great Sea toward the going\ndown of the sun, shall be your territory.\nNo man shall be able to stand before\nyou all the days of your life; as I was\nwith Moses, so I will be with you. I will\nnot leave you nor forsake you.\nBe strong and of good courage, for to\nthis people you shall divide as an\ninheritance the land which I swore to\ntheir fathers to give them.\nOnly be strong and very courageous,\nthat you may observe to do according to\nall the law which Moses My servant\ncommanded you; do not turn from it to\nthe right hand or to the left, that you may\nprosper wherever you go.\nThis Book of the Law shall not depart\nfrom your mouth, but you shall meditate\nin it day and night, that you may observe\nto do according to all that is written in it.\nFor then you will make your way\nprosperous, and then you will have good\nsuccess.\nHave I not commanded you? Be strong\nand of good courage; do not be afraid,\nnor be dismayed, for the LORD your\nGod is with you wherever you go.\"\nThen Joshua commanded the officers\nof the people, saying,\n\"Pass through the camp and command\nthe people, saying, \"Prepare provisions\nfor yourselves, for within three days you\nwill cross over this Jordan, to go in to\npossess the land which the LORD your\nGod is giving you to possess.\"'\nAnd to the Reubenites, the Gadites,\nand half the tribe of Manasseh Joshua\nspoke, saying,\n\"Remember the word which Moses the\nservant of the LORD commanded you,\nsaying, \"The LORD your God is giving\nyou rest and is giving you this land.'\nYour wives, your little ones, and your\nlivestock shall remain in the land which\nMoses gave you on this side of the\nJordan. But you shall pass before your\nbrethren armed, all your mighty men of\nvalor, and help them,\nuntil the LORD has given your\nbrethren rest, as He gave you, and they\nalso have taken possession of the land\nwhich the LORD your God is giving\nthem. Then you shall return to the land\nof your possession and enjoy it, which\nMoses the LORD's servant gave you on\nthis side of the Jordan toward the\nsunrise.\"\nSo they answered Joshua, saying, \"All\nthat you command us we will do, and\nwherever you send us we will go.\nJust as we heeded Moses in all things,\nso we will heed you. Only the LORD\nyour God be with you, as He was with\nMoses.\nWhoever\nrebels\nagainst\nyour\ncommand and does not heed your\nwords, in all that you command him,\nshall be put to death. Only be strong\nand of good courage.\"\nThen the woman took the two men and\nhid them. So she said, \"Yes, the men\ncame to me, but I did not know where\nthey were from.\nAnd it happened as the gate was being\nshut, when it was dark, that the men\nwent out. Where the men went I do not\nknow; pursue them quickly, for you may\novertake them.\"\n(But she had brought them up to the\nroof and hidden them with the stalks of\nflax, which she had laid in order on the\nroof.)\nThen the men pursued them by the\nroad to the Jordan, to the fords. And as\nsoon as those who pursued them had\ngone out, they shut the gate.\nNow before they lay down, she came\nup to them on the roof,\n2Now Joshua the son of Nun sent out\ntwo men from Acacia Grove to spy\nsecretly, saying, \"Go, view the land,\nespecially Jericho.\" So they went, and\ncame to the house of a harlot named\nRahab, and lodged there.\nand said to the men: \"I know that the\nLORD has given you the land, that the\nterror of you has fallen on us, and that\nall the inhabitants of the land are\nfainthearted because of you.\nAnd it was told the king of Jericho,\nsaying, \"Behold, men have come here\ntonight from the children of Israel to\nsearch out the country.\"\nFor we have heard how the LORD\ndried up the water of the Red Sea for\nyou when you came out of Egypt, and\nwhat you did to the two kings of the\nAmorites who were on the other side of\nthe Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you\nutterly destroyed.\nSo the king of Jericho sent to Rahab,\nsaying, \"Bring out the men who have\ncome to you, who have entered your\nhouse, for they have come to search out\nall the country.\"\nAnd as soon as we heard these things,\nour hearts melted; neither did there\nremain any more courage in anyone\nbecause of you, for the LORD your God,\nHe is God in heaven above and on earth\nbeneath.\nNow therefore, I beg you, swear to me\nby the LORD, since I have shown you\nkindness, that you also will show\nkindness to my father's house, and give\nme a true token,\nand spare my father, my mother, my\nbrothers, my sisters, and all that they\nhave, and deliver our lives from death.\"\nhead, and we will be guiltless. And\nwhoever is with you in the house, his\nblood shall be on our head if a hand is\nlaid on him.\nAnd if you tell this business of ours,\nthen we will be free from your oath\nwhich you made us swear.\"\nThen she said, \"According to your\nwords, so be it.\" And she sent them\naway, and they departed. And she\nbound the scarlet cord in the window.\nSo the men answered her, \"Our lives\nfor yours, if none of you tell this\nbusiness of ours. And it shall be, when\nthe LORD has given us the land, that we\nwill deal kindly and truly with you.\"\nThey departed and went to the\nmountain, and stayed there three days\nuntil the pursuers returned. The\npursuers sought them all along the way,\nbut did not find them.\nThen she let them down by a rope\nthrough the window, for her house was\non the city wall; she dwelt on the wall.\nAnd she said to them, \"Get to the\nmountain, lest the pursuers meet you.\nHide there three days, until the pursuers\nhave returned. Afterward you may go\nyour way.\"\nSo the men said to her: \"We will be\nblameless of this oath of yours which\nyou have made us swear,\nunless, when we come into the land,\nyou bind this line of scarlet cord in the\nwindow through which you let us down,\nand unless you bring your father, your\nmother, your brothers, and all your\nfather's household to your own home.\nSo it shall be that whoever goes\noutside the doors of your house into the\nstreet, his blood shall be on his own\nSo the two men returned, descended\nfrom the mountain, and crossed over;\nand they came to Joshua the son of Nun,\nand told him all that had befallen them.\nAnd they said to Joshua, \"Truly the\nLORD has delivered all the land into our\nhands, for indeed all the inhabitants of\nthe country are fainthearted because of\nus.\"\n3Then Joshua rose early in the\nmorning; and they set out from Acacia\nGrove and came to the Jordan, he and\nall the children of Israel, and lodged\nthere before they crossed over.\nSo it was, after three days, that the\nofficers went through the camp;\nand they commanded the people,\nsaying, \"When you see the ark of the\ncovenant of the LORD your God, and\nthe priests, the Levites, bearing it, then\nyou shall set out from your place and go\nafter it.\nYet there shall be a space between you\nand it, about two thousand cubits by\nmeasure. Do not come near it, that you\nmay know the way by which you must\ngo, for you have not passed this way\nbefore.\"\nPerizzites and the Girgashites and the\nAmorites and the Jebusites:\nBehold, the ark of the covenant of the\nLord of all the earth is crossing over\nbefore you into the Jordan.\nNow therefore, take for yourselves\ntwelve men from the tribes of Israel, one\nman from every tribe.\nAnd Joshua said to the people,\n\"Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the\nLORD will do wonders among you.\"\nThen Joshua spoke to the priests,\nsaying, \"Take up the ark of the covenant\nand cross over before the people.\" So\nthey took up the ark of the covenant and\nwent before the people.\nAnd the LORD said to Joshua, \"This\nday I will begin to exalt you in the sight\nof all Israel, that they may know that, as\nI was with Moses, so I will be with you.\nYou shall command the priests who\nbear the ark of the covenant, saying,\n\"When you have come to the edge of\nthe water of the Jordan, you shall stand\nin the Jordan.\"'\nSo Joshua said to the children of Israel,\n\"Come here, and hear the words of the\nLORD your God.\"\nAnd Joshua said, \"By this you shall\nknow that the living God is among you,\nand that He will without fail drive out\nfrom before you the Canaanites and the\nHittites and the Hivites and the\nAnd it shall come to pass, as soon as\nthe soles of the feet of the priests who\nbear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all\nthe earth, shall rest in the waters of the\nJordan, that the waters of the Jordan\nshall be cut off, the waters that come\ndown from upstream, and they shall\nstand as a heap.\"\nSo it was, when the people set out\nfrom their camp to cross over the Jordan,\nwith the priests bearing the ark of the\ncovenant before the people,\nand as those who bore the ark came\nto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests\nwho bore the ark dipped in the edge of\nthe water (for the Jordan overflows all its\nbanks during the whole time of harvest),\nthat the waters which came down from\nupstream stood still, and rose in a heap\nvery far away at Adam, the city that is\nbeside Zaretan. So the waters that went\ndown into the Sea of the Arabah, the\nSalt Sea, failed, and were cut off; and\nthe people crossed over opposite\nJericho.\nThen the priests who bore the ark of\nthe covenant of the LORD stood firm on\ndry ground in the midst of the Jordan;\nand all Israel crossed over on dry\nground, until all the people had crossed\ncompletely over the Jordan.\nthese stones shall be for a memorial to\nthe children of Israel forever.\"\n4And it came to pass, when all the\npeople had completely crossed over the\nJordan, that the LORD spoke to Joshua,\nsaying:\n\"Take for yourselves twelve men from\nthe people, one man from every tribe,\nand command them, saying, \"Take for\nyourselves twelve stones from here, out\nof the midst of the Jordan, from the\nplace where the priests' feet stood firm.\nYou shall carry them over with you and\nleave them in the lodging place where\nyou lodge tonight.\"'\nThen Joshua called the twelve men\nwhom he had appointed from the\nchildren of Israel, one man from every\ntribe;\nand Joshua said to them: \"Cross over\nbefore the ark of the LORD your God\ninto the midst of the Jordan, and each\none of you take up a stone on his\nshoulder, according to the number of the\ntribes of the children of Israel,\nthat this may be a sign among you\nwhen your children ask in time to come,\nsaying, \"What do these stones mean to\nyou?'\nThen you shall answer them that the\nwaters of the Jordan were cut off before\nthe ark of the covenant of the LORD;\nwhen it crossed over the Jordan, the\nwaters of the Jordan were cut off. And\nAnd the children of Israel did so, just as\nJoshua commanded, and took up twelve\nstones from the midst of the Jordan, as\nthe LORD had spoken to Joshua,\naccording to the number of the tribes of\nthe children of Israel, and carried them\nover with them to the place where they\nlodged, and laid them down there.\nThen Joshua set up twelve stones in\nthe midst of the Jordan, in the place\nwhere the feet of the priests who bore\nthe ark of the covenant stood; and they\nare there to this day.\nSo the priests who bore the ark stood\nin the midst of the Jordan until\neverything was finished that the LORD\nhad commanded Joshua to speak to the\npeople, according to all that Moses had\ncommanded Joshua; and the people\nhurried and crossed over.\nThen it came to pass, when all the\npeople had completely crossed over,\nthat the ark of the LORD and the priests\ncrossed over in the presence of the\npeople.\nAnd the men of Reuben, the men of\nGad, and half the tribe of Manasseh\ncrossed over armed before the children\nof Israel, as Moses had spoken to them.\nAbout forty thousand prepared for war\ncrossed over before the LORD for battle,\nto the plains of Jericho.\nOn that day the LORD exalted Joshua\nin the sight of all Israel; and they feared\nhim, as they had feared Moses, all the\ndays of his life.\nyour God did to the Red Sea, which He\ndried up before us until we had crossed\nover,\nThen the LORD spoke to Joshua,\nsaying,\n\"Command the priests who bear the\nark of the Testimony to come up from\nthe Jordan.\"\nJoshua therefore commanded the\npriests, saying, \"Come up from the\nJordan.\"\nAnd it came to pass, when the priests\nwho bore the ark of the covenant of the\nLORD had come from the midst of the\nJordan, and the soles of the priests' feet\ntouched the dry land, that the waters of\nthe Jordan returned to their place and\noverflowed all its banks as before.\nthat all the peoples of the earth may\nknow the hand of the LORD, that it is\nmighty, that you may fear the LORD\nyour God forever.\"\n5So it was, when all the kings of the\nAmorites who were on the west side of\nthe Jordan, and all the kings of the\nCanaanites who were by the sea, heard\nthat the LORD had dried up the waters\nof the Jordan from before the children of\nIsrael until we had crossed over, that\ntheir heart melted; and there was no\nspirit in them any longer because of the\nchildren of Israel.\nNow the people came up from the\nJordan on the tenth day of the first\nmonth, and they camped in Gilgal on the\neast border of Jericho.\nAt that time the LORD said to Joshua,\n\"Make flint knives for yourself, and\ncircumcise the sons of Israel again the\nsecond time.\"\nAnd those twelve stones which they\ntook out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in\nGilgal.\nSo Joshua made flint knives for himself,\nand circumcised the sons of Israel at the\nhill of the foreskins.\nThen he spoke to the children of Israel,\nsaying: \"When your children ask their\nfathers in time to come, saying, \"What\nare these stones?'\nAnd this is the reason why Joshua\ncircumcised them: All the people who\ncame out of Egypt who were males, all\nthe men of war, had died in the\nwilderness on the way, after they had\ncome out of Egypt.\nthen you shall let your children know,\nsaying, \"Israel crossed over this Jordan\non dry land';\nfor the LORD your God dried up the\nwaters of the Jordan before you until\nyou had crossed over, as the LORD\nFor all the people who came out had\nbeen circumcised, but all the people\nborn in the wilderness, on the way as\nthey came out of Egypt, had not been\ncircumcised.\nFor the children of Israel walked forty\nyears in the wilderness, till all the people\nwho were men of war, who came out of\nEgypt, were consumed, because they\ndid not obey the voice of the LORD--to\nwhom the LORD swore that He would\nnot show them the land which the LORD\nhad sworn to their fathers that He would\ngive us, \"a land flowing with milk and\nhoney.\"\nThen Joshua circumcised their sons\nwhom He raised up in their place; for\nthey were uncircumcised, because they\nhad not been circumcised on the way.\nAnd it came to pass, when Joshua\nwas by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes\nand looked, and behold, a Man stood\nopposite him with His sword drawn in\nHis hand. And Joshua went to Him and\nsaid to Him, \"Are You for us or for our\nadversaries?\"\nSo He said, \"No, but as Commander of\nthe army of the LORD I have now\ncome.\" And Joshua fell on his face to\nthe earth and worshiped, and said to\nHim, \"What does my Lord say to His\nservant?\"\nSo it was, when they had finished\ncircumcising all the people, that they\nstayed in their places in the camp till\nthey were healed.\nThen the LORD said to Joshua, \"This\nday I have rolled away the reproach of\nEgypt from you.\" Therefore the name of\nthe place is called Gilgal to this day.\nNow the children of Israel camped in\nGilgal, and kept the Passover on the\nfourteenth day of the month at twilight\non the plains of Jericho.\nAnd they ate of the produce of the land\non the day after the Passover,\nunleavened bread and parched grain,\non the very same day.\nThen the manna ceased on the day\nafter they had eaten the produce of the\nland; and the children of Israel no longer\nhad manna, but they ate the food of the\nland of Canaan that year.\nThen the Commander of the LORD's\narmy said to Joshua, \"Take your sandal\noff your foot, for the place where you\nstand is holy.\" And Joshua did so.\n6Now Jericho was securely shut up\nbecause of the children of Israel; none\nwent out, and none came in.\nAnd the LORD said to Joshua: \"See! I\nhave given Jericho into your hand, its\nking, and the mighty men of valor.\nYou shall march around the city, all you\nmen of war; you shall go all around the\ncity once. This you shall do six days.\nAnd seven priests shall bear seven\ntrumpets of rams' horns before the ark.\nBut the seventh day you shall march\naround the city seven times, and the\npriests shall blow the trumpets.\nIt shall come to pass, when they make\na long blast with the ram's horn, and\nwhen you hear the sound of the trumpet,\nthat all the people shall shout with a\ngreat shout; then the wall of the city will\nfall down flat. And the people shall go up\nevery man straight before him.\"\nThen Joshua the son of Nun called the\npriests and said to them, \"Take up the\nark of the covenant, and let seven\npriests bear seven trumpets of rams'\nhorns before the ark of the LORD.\"\nAnd he said to the people, \"Proceed,\nand march around the city, and let him\nwho is armed advance before the ark of\nthe LORD.\"\nSo it was, when Joshua had spoken to\nthe people, that the seven priests\nbearing the seven trumpets of rams'\nhorns before the LORD advanced and\nblew the trumpets, and the ark of the\ncovenant of the LORD followed them.\nThe armed men went before the priests\nwho blew the trumpets, and the rear\nguard came after the ark, while the\npriests continued blowing the trumpets.\nNow Joshua had commanded the\npeople, saying, \"You shall not shout or\nmake any noise with your voice, nor\nshall a word proceed out of your mouth,\nuntil the day I say to you, \"Shout!' Then\nyou shall shout.\"\nSo he had the ark of the LORD circle\nthe city, going around it once. Then they\ncame into the camp and lodged in the\ncamp.\nAnd Joshua rose early in the morning,\nand the priests took up the ark of the\nLORD.\nThen seven priests bearing seven\ntrumpets of rams' horns before the ark\nof the LORD went on continually and\nblew with the trumpets. And the armed\nmen went before them. But the rear\nguard came after the ark of the LORD,\nwhile the priests continued blowing the\ntrumpets.\nAnd the second day they marched\naround the city once and returned to the\ncamp. So they did six days.\nBut it came to pass on the seventh day\nthat they rose early, about the dawning\nof the day, and marched around the city\nseven times in the same manner. On\nthat day only they marched around the\ncity seven times.\nAnd the seventh time it happened,\nwhen the priests blew the trumpets, that\nJoshua said to the people: \"Shout, for\nthe LORD has given you the city!\nNow the city shall be doomed by the\nLORD to destruction, it and all who are\nin it. Only Rahab the harlot shall live,\nshe and all who are with her in the\nhouse, because she hid the messengers\nthat we sent.\nAnd you, by all means abstain from\nthe accursed things, lest you become\naccursed when you take of the accursed\nthings, and make the camp of Israel a\ncurse, and trouble it.\nBut all the silver and gold, and vessels\nof bronze and iron, are consecrated to\nthe LORD; they shall come into the\ntreasury of the LORD.\"\nSo the people shouted when the\npriests blew the trumpets. And it\nhappened when the people heard the\nsound of the trumpet, and the people\nshouted with a great shout, that the wall\nfell down flat. Then the people went up\ninto the city, every man straight before\nhim, and they took the city.\nAnd they utterly destroyed all that was\nin the city, both man and woman, young\nand old, ox and sheep and donkey, with\nthe edge of the sword.\nBut Joshua had said to the two men\nwho had spied out the country, \"Go into\nthe harlot's house, and from there bring\nout the woman and all that she has, as\nyou swore to her.\"\nAnd the young men who had been\nspies went in and brought out Rahab,\nher father, her mother, her brothers, and\nall that she had. So they brought out all\nher relatives and left them outside the\ncamp of Israel.\nBut they burned the city and all that\nwas in it with fire. Only the silver and\ngold, and the vessels of bronze and iron,\nthey put into the treasury of the house of\nthe LORD.\nAnd Joshua spared Rahab the harlot,\nher father's household, and all that she\nhad. So she dwells in Israel to this day,\nbecause she hid the messengers whom\nJoshua sent to spy out Jericho.\nThen Joshua charged them at that\ntime, saying, \"Cursed be the man before\nthe LORD who rises up and builds this\ncity Jericho; he shall lay its foundation\nwith his firstborn, and with his youngest\nhe shall set up its gates.\"\nSo the LORD was with Joshua, and\nhis fame spread throughout all the\ncountry.\n7But the children of Israel committed a\ntrespass regarding the accursed things,\nfor Achan the son of Carmi, the son of\nZabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of\nJudah, took of the accursed things; so\nthe anger of the LORD burned against\nthe children of Israel.\nNow Joshua sent men from Jericho to\nAi, which is beside Beth Aven, on the\neast side of Bethel, and spoke to them,\nsaying, \"Go up and spy out the country.\"\nSo the men went up and spied out Ai.\nAnd they returned to Joshua and said\nto him, \"Do not let all the people go up,\nbut let about two or three thousand men\ngo up and attack Ai. Do not weary all the\npeople there, for the people of Ai are\nfew.\"\nSo about three thousand men went up\nthere from the people, but they fled\nbefore the men of Ai.\nAnd the men of Ai struck down about\nthirty-six men, for they chased them\nfrom before the gate as far as Shebarim,\nand struck them down on the descent;\ntherefore the hearts of the people\nmelted and became like water.\nThen Joshua tore his clothes, and fell\nto the earth on his face before the ark of\nthe LORD until evening, he and the\nelders of Israel; and they put dust on\ntheir heads.\nbefore your enemies until you take away\nthe accursed thing from among you.\"\nAnd Joshua said, \"Alas, Lord GOD,\nwhy have You brought this people over\nthe Jordan at all--to deliver us into the\nhand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Oh,\nthat we had been content, and dwelt on\nthe other side of the Jordan!\nO Lord, what shall I say when Israel\nturns its back before its enemies?\nIn the morning therefore you shall be\nbrought according to your tribes. And it\nshall be that the tribe which the LORD\ntakes shall come according to families;\nand the family which the LORD takes\nshall come by households; and the\nhousehold which the LORD takes shall\ncome man by man.\nFor the Canaanites and all the\ninhabitants of the land will hear it, and\nsurround us, and cut off our name from\nthe earth. Then what will You do for\nYour great name?\"\nThen it shall be that he who is taken\nwith the accursed thing shall be burned\nwith fire, he and all that he has, because\nhe has transgressed the covenant of the\nLORD, and because he has done a\ndisgraceful thing in Israel.\"'\nSo the LORD said to Joshua: \"Get up!\nWhy do you lie thus on your face?\nSo Joshua rose early in the morning\nand brought Israel by their tribes, and\nthe tribe of Judah was taken.\nIsrael has sinned, and they have also\ntransgressed My covenant which I\ncommanded them. For they have even\ntaken some of the accursed things, and\nhave both stolen and deceived; and they\nhave also put it among their own stuff.\nTherefore the children of Israel could\nnot stand before their enemies, but\nturned their backs before their enemies,\nbecause they have become doomed to\ndestruction. Neither will I be with you\nanymore, unless you destroy the\naccursed from among you.\nGet up, sanctify the people, and say,\n\"Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow,\nbecause thus says the LORD God of\nIsrael: \"There is an accursed thing in\nyour midst, O Israel; you cannot stand\nHe brought the clan of Judah, and he\ntook the family of the Zarhites; and he\nbrought the family of the Zarhites man\nby man, and Zabdi was taken.\nThen he brought his household man\nby man, and Achan the son of Carmi,\nthe son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of\nthe tribe of Judah, was taken.\nNow Joshua said to Achan, \"My son, I\nbeg you, give glory to the LORD God of\nIsrael, and make confession to Him, and\ntell me now what you have done; do not\nhide it from me.\"\nAnd Achan answered Joshua and said,\n\"Indeed I have sinned against the LORD\nGod of Israel, and this is what I have\ndone:\nWhen I saw among the spoils a\nbeautiful Babylonian garment, two\nhundred shekels of silver, and a wedge\nof gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted\nthem and took them. And there they are,\nhidden in the earth in the midst of my\ntent, with the silver under it.\"\nSo Joshua sent messengers, and they\nran to the tent; and there it was, hidden\nin his tent, with the silver under it.\nAnd they took them from the midst of\nthe tent, brought them to Joshua and to\nall the children of Israel, and laid them\nout before the LORD.\nThen Joshua, and all Israel with him,\ntook Achan the son of Zerah, the silver,\nthe garment, the wedge of gold, his\nsons, his daughters, his oxen, his\ndonkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that\nhe had, and they brought them to the\nValley of Achor.\nhand the king of Ai, his people, his city,\nand his land.\nAnd you shall do to Ai and its king as\nyou did to Jericho and its king. Only its\nspoil and its cattle you shall take as\nbooty for yourselves. Lay an ambush for\nthe city behind it.\"\nSo Joshua arose, and all the people of\nwar, to go up against Ai; and Joshua\nchose thirty thousand mighty men of\nvalor and sent them away by night.\nAnd he commanded them, saying:\n\"Behold, you shall lie in ambush against\nthe city, behind the city. Do not go very\nfar from the city, but all of you be ready.\nThen I and all the people who are with\nme will approach the city; and it will\ncome about, when they come out\nagainst us as at the first, that we shall\nflee before them.\nAnd Joshua said, \"Why have you\ntroubled us? The LORD will trouble you\nthis day.\" So all Israel stoned him with\nstones; and they burned them with fire\nafter they had stoned them with stones.\nFor they will come out after us till we\nhave drawn them from the city, for they\nwill say, \"They are fleeing before us as\nat the first.' Therefore we will flee before\nthem.\nThen they raised over him a great\nheap of stones, still there to this day. So\nthe LORD turned from the fierceness of\nHis anger. Therefore the name of that\nplace has been called the Valley of\nAchor to this day.\n8Now the LORD said to Joshua: \"Do\nnot be afraid, nor be dismayed; take all\nthe people of war with you, and arise, go\nup to Ai. See, I have given into your\nThen you shall rise from the ambush\nand seize the city, for the LORD your\nGod will deliver it into your hand.\nAnd it will be, when you have taken the\ncity, that you shall set the city on fire.\nAccording to the commandment of the\nLORD you shall do. See, I have\ncommanded you.\"\nJoshua therefore sent them out; and\nthey went to lie in ambush, and stayed\nbetween Bethel and Ai, on the west side\nof Ai; but Joshua lodged that night\namong the people.\nThere was not a man left in Ai or\nBethel who did not go out after Israel.\nSo they left the city open and pursued\nIsrael.\nThen Joshua rose up early in the\nmorning and mustered the people, and\nwent up, he and the elders of Israel,\nbefore the people to Ai.\nAnd all the people of war who were\nwith him went up and drew near; and\nthey came before the city and camped\non the north side of Ai. Now a valley lay\nbetween them and Ai.\nSo he took about five thousand men\nand set them in ambush between Bethel\nand Ai, on the west side of the city.\nThen the LORD said to Joshua,\n\"Stretch out the spear that is in your\nhand toward Ai, for I will give it into your\nhand.\" And Joshua stretched out the\nspear that was in his hand toward the\ncity.\nSo those in ambush arose quickly out\nof their place; they ran as soon as he\nhad stretched out his hand, and they\nentered the city and took it, and hurried\nto set the city on fire.\nAnd when they had set the people, all\nthe army that was on the north of the\ncity, and its rear guard on the west of\nthe city, Joshua went that night into the\nmidst of the valley.\nAnd when the men of Ai looked behind\nthem, they saw, and behold, the smoke\nof the city ascended to heaven. So they\nhad no power to flee this way or that\nway, and the people who had fled to the\nwilderness turned back on the pursuers.\nNow it happened, when the king of Ai\nsaw it, that the men of the city hurried\nand rose early and went out against\nIsrael to battle, he and all his people, at\nan appointed place before the plain. But\nhe did not know that there was an\nambush against him behind the city.\nAnd Joshua and all Israel made as if\nthey were beaten before them, and fled\nby the way of the wilderness.\nNow when Joshua and all Israel saw\nthat the ambush had taken the city and\nthat the smoke of the city ascended,\nthey turned back and struck down the\nmen of Ai.\nThen the others came out of the city\nagainst them; so they were caught in the\nmidst of Israel, some on this side and\nsome on that side. And they struck them\ndown, so that they let none of them\nremain or escape.\nSo all the people who were in Ai were\ncalled together to pursue them. And\nthey pursued Joshua and were drawn\naway from the city.\nBut the king of Ai they took alive, and\nbrought him to Joshua.\nAnd it came to pass when Israel had\nmade an end of slaying all the\ninhabitants of Ai in the field, in the\nwilderness where they pursued them,\nand when they all had fallen by the edge\nof the sword until they were consumed,\nthat all the Israelites returned to Ai and\nstruck it with the edge of the sword.\nSo it was that all who fell that day,\nboth men and women, were twelve\nthousand--all the people of Ai.\nFor Joshua did not draw back his hand,\nwith which he stretched out the spear,\nuntil he had utterly destroyed all the\ninhabitants of Ai.\nAnd there, in the presence of the\nchildren of Israel, he wrote on the\nstones a copy of the law of Moses,\nwhich he had written.\nThen all Israel, with their elders and\nofficers and judges, stood on either side\nof the ark before the priests, the Levites,\nwho bore the ark of the covenant of the\nLORD, the stranger as well as he who\nwas born among them. Half of them\nwere in front of Mount Gerizim and half\nof them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses\nthe servant of the LORD had\ncommanded before, that they should\nbless the people of Israel.\nOnly the livestock and the spoil of that\ncity Israel took as booty for themselves,\naccording to the word of the LORD\nwhich He had commanded Joshua.\nAnd afterward he read all the words of\nthe law, the blessings and the cursings,\naccording to all that is written in the\nBook of the Law.\nSo Joshua burned Ai and made it a\nheap forever, a desolation to this day.\nAnd the king of Ai he hanged on a tree\nuntil evening. And as soon as the sun\nwas down, Joshua commanded that\nthey should take his corpse down from\nthe tree, cast it at the entrance of the\ngate of the city, and raise over it a great\nheap of stones that remains to this day.\nNow Joshua built an altar to the LORD\nGod of Israel in Mount Ebal,\nas Moses the servant of the LORD\nhad commanded the children of Israel,\nas it is written in the Book of the Law of\nMoses: \"an altar of whole stones over\nwhich no man has wielded an iron tool.\"\nAnd they offered on it burnt offerings to\nthe LORD, and sacrificed peace\nofferings.\nThere was not a word of all that Moses\nhad commanded which Joshua did not\nread before all the assembly of Israel,\nwith the women, the little ones, and the\nstrangers who were living among them.\n9And it came to pass when all the\nkings who were on this side of the\nJordan, in the hills and in the lowland\nand in all the coasts of the Great Sea\ntoward Lebanon--the Hittite, the Amorite,\nthe Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite,\nand the Jebusite--heard about it,\nthat they gathered together to fight with\nJoshua and Israel with one accord.\nBut when the inhabitants of Gibeon\nheard what Joshua had done to Jericho\nand Ai,\nthey worked craftily, and went and\npretended to be ambassadors. And they\ntook old sacks on their donkeys, old\nwineskins torn and mended,\nold and patched sandals on their feet,\nand old garments on themselves; and all\nthe bread of their provision was dry and\nmoldy.\nAnd they went to Joshua, to the camp\nat Gilgal, and said to him and to the men\nof Israel, \"We have come from a far\ncountry; now therefore, make a\ncovenant with us.\"\nThen the men of Israel said to the\nHivites, \"Perhaps you dwell among us;\nso how can we make a covenant with\nyou?\"\nBut they said to Joshua, \"We are your\nservants.\" And Joshua said to them,\n\"Who are you, and where do you come\nfrom?\"\nSo they said to him: \"From a very far\ncountry your servants have come,\nbecause of the name of the LORD your\nGod; for we have heard of His fame,\nand all that He did in Egypt,\nand all that He did to the two kings of\nthe Amorites who were beyond the\nJordan--to Sihon king of Heshbon, and\nOg king of Bashan, who was at\nAshtaroth.\nTherefore our elders and all the\ninhabitants of our country spoke to us,\nsaying, \"Take provisions with you for the\njourney, and go to meet them, and say\nto them, \"We are your servants; now\ntherefore, make a covenant with us.\"'\nThis bread of ours we took hot for our\nprovision from our houses on the day\nwe departed to come to you. But now\nlook, it is dry and moldy.\nAnd these wineskins which we filled\nwere new, and see, they are torn; and\nthese our garments and our sandals\nhave become old because of the very\nlong journey.\"\nThen the men of Israel took some of\ntheir provisions; but they did not ask\ncounsel of the LORD.\nSo Joshua made peace with them,\nand made a covenant with them to let\nthem live; and the rulers of the\ncongregation swore to them.\nAnd it happened at the end of three\ndays, after they had made a covenant\nwith them, that they heard that they\nwere their neighbors who dwelt near\nthem.\nThen the children of Israel journeyed\nand came to their cities on the third day.\nNow their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah,\nBeeroth, and Kirjath Jearim.\nBut the children of Israel did not attack\nthem, because the rulers of the\ncongregation had sworn to them by the\nLORD God of Israel. And all the\ncongregation complained against the\nrulers.\nThen all the rulers said to all the\ncongregation, \"We have sworn to them\nby the LORD God of Israel; now\ntherefore, we may not touch them.\ncongregation and for the altar of the\nLORD, in the place which He would\nchoose, even to this day.\nThis we will do to them: We will let\nthem live, lest wrath be upon us\nbecause of the oath which we swore to\nthem.\"\nAnd the rulers said to them, \"Let them\nlive, but let them be woodcutters and\nwater carriers for all the congregation,\nas the rulers had promised them.\"\nThen Joshua called for them, and he\nspoke to them, saying, \"Why have you\ndeceived us, saying, \"We are very far\nfrom you,' when you dwell near us?\nNow therefore, you are cursed, and\nnone of you shall be freed from being\nslaves--woodcutters and water carriers\nfor the house of my God.\"\nSo they answered Joshua and said,\n\"Because your servants were clearly\ntold that the LORD your God\ncommanded His servant Moses to give\nyou all the land, and to destroy all the\ninhabitants of the land from before you;\ntherefore we were very much afraid for\nour lives because of you, and have done\nthis thing.\nAnd now, here we are, in your hands;\ndo with us as it seems good and right to\ndo to us.\"\nSo he did to them, and delivered them\nout of the hand of the children of Israel,\nso that they did not kill them.\nAnd that day Joshua made them\nwoodcutters and water carriers for the\n10Now it came to pass when AdoniZedek king of Jerusalem heard how\nJoshua had taken Ai and had utterly\ndestroyed it--as he had done to Jericho\nand its king, so he had done to Ai and\nits king--and how the inhabitants of\nGibeon had made peace with Israel and\nwere among them,\nthat they feared greatly, because\nGibeon was a great city, like one of the\nroyal cities, and because it was greater\nthan Ai, and all its men were mighty.\nTherefore\nAdoni-Zedek\nking\nof\nJerusalem sent to Hoham king of\nHebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia\nking of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon,\nsaying,\n\"Come up to me and help me, that we\nmay attack Gibeon, for it has made\npeace with Joshua and with the children\nof Israel.\"\nTherefore the five kings of the Amorites,\nthe king of Jerusalem, the king of\nHebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of\nLachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered\ntogether and went up, they and all their\narmies, and camped before Gibeon and\nmade war against it.\nAnd the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua\nat the camp at Gilgal, saying, \"Do not\nforsake your servants; come up to us\nquickly, save us and help us, for all the\nkings of the Amorites who dwell in the\nmountains have\nagainst us.\"\ngathered\ntogether\nstill in the midst of heaven, and did not\nhasten to go down for about a whole\nday.\nSo Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he\nand all the people of war with him, and\nall the mighty men of valor.\nAnd the LORD said to Joshua, \"Do not\nfear them, for I have delivered them into\nyour hand; not a man of them shall\nstand before you.\"\nAnd there has been no day like that,\nbefore it or after it, that the LORD\nheeded the voice of a man; for the\nLORD fought for Israel.\nThen Joshua returned, and all Israel\nwith him, to the camp at Gilgal.\nJoshua therefore came upon them\nsuddenly, having marched all night from\nGilgal.\nBut these five kings had fled and\nhidden themselves in a cave at\nMakkedah.\nSo the LORD routed them before\nIsrael, killed them with a great slaughter\nat Gibeon, chased them along the road\nthat goes to Beth Horon, and struck\nthem down as far as Azekah and\nMakkedah.\nAnd it happened, as they fled before\nIsrael and were on the descent of Beth\nHoron, that the LORD cast down large\nhailstones from heaven on them as far\nas Azekah, and they died. There were\nmore who died from the hailstones than\nthe children of Israel killed with the\nsword.\nThen Joshua spoke to the LORD in\nthe day when the LORD delivered up\nthe Amorites before the children of\nIsrael, and he said in the sight of Israel:\n\"Sun, stand still over Gibeon; And Moon,\nin the Valley of Aijalon.\"\nSo the sun stood still, And the moon\nstopped, Till the people had revenge\nUpon their enemies. Is this not written in\nthe Book of Jasher? So the sun stood\nAnd it was told Joshua, saying, \"The\nfive kings have been found hidden in the\ncave at Makkedah.\"\nSo Joshua said, \"Roll large stones\nagainst the mouth of the cave, and set\nmen by it to guard them.\nAnd do not stay there yourselves, but\npursue your enemies, and attack their\nrear guard. Do not allow them to enter\ntheir cities, for the LORD your God has\ndelivered them into your hand.\"\nThen it happened, while Joshua and\nthe children of Israel made an end of\nslaying them with a very great slaughter,\ntill they had finished, that those who\nescaped entered fortified cities.\nAnd all the people returned to the\ncamp, to Joshua at Makkedah, in peace.\nNo one moved his tongue against any of\nthe children of Israel.\nThen Joshua said, \"Open the mouth of\nthe cave, and bring out those five kings\nto me from the cave.\"\nMakkedah as he had done to the king of\nJericho.\nAnd they did so, and brought out those\nfive kings to him from the cave: the king\nof Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the\nking of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and\nthe king of Eglon.\nSo it was, when they brought out those\nkings to Joshua, that Joshua called for\nall the men of Israel, and said to the\ncaptains of the men of war who went\nwith him, \"Come near, put your feet on\nthe necks of these kings.\" And they\ndrew near and put their feet on their\nnecks.\nThen Joshua said to them, \"Do not be\nafraid, nor be dismayed; be strong and\nof good courage, for thus the LORD will\ndo to all your enemies against whom\nyou fight.\"\nAnd afterward Joshua struck them and\nkilled them, and hanged them on five\ntrees; and they were hanging on the\ntrees until evening.\nSo it was at the time of the going down\nof the sun that Joshua commanded, and\nthey took them down from the trees,\ncast them into the cave where they had\nbeen hidden, and laid large stones\nagainst the cave's mouth, which remain\nuntil this very day.\nOn that day Joshua took Makkedah,\nand struck it and its king with the edge\nof the sword. He utterly destroyed them\n--all the people who were in it. He let\nnone remain. He also did to the king of\nThen Joshua passed from Makkedah,\nand all Israel with him, to Libnah; and\nthey fought against Libnah.\nAnd the LORD also delivered it and its\nking into the hand of Israel; he struck it\nand all the people who were in it with\nthe edge of the sword. He let none\nremain in it, but did to its king as he had\ndone to the king of Jericho.\nThen Joshua passed from Libnah, and\nall Israel with him, to Lachish; and they\nencamped against it and fought against\nit.\nAnd the LORD delivered Lachish into\nthe hand of Israel, who took it on the\nsecond day, and struck it and all the\npeople who were in it with the edge of\nthe sword, according to all that he had\ndone to Libnah.\nThen Horam king of Gezer came up to\nhelp Lachish; and Joshua struck him\nand his people, until he left him none\nremaining.\nFrom Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon,\nand all Israel with him; and they\nencamped against it and fought against\nit.\nThey took it on that day and struck it\nwith the edge of the sword; all the\npeople who were in it he utterly\ndestroyed that day, according to all that\nhe had done to Lachish.\nSo Joshua went up from Eglon, and all\nIsrael with him, to Hebron; and they\nfought against it.\nAnd they took it and struck it with the\nedge of the sword--its king, all its cities,\nand all the people who were in it; he left\nnone remaining, according to all that he\nhad done to Eglon, but utterly destroyed\nit and all the people who were in it.\nThen Joshua returned, and all Israel\nwith him, to Debir; and they fought\nagainst it.\nAnd he took it and its king and all its\ncities; they struck them with the edge of\nthe sword and utterly destroyed all the\npeople who were in it. He left none\nremaining; as he had done to Hebron,\nso he did to Debir and its king, as he\nhad done also to Libnah and its king.\nSo Joshua conquered all the land: the\nmountain country and the South and the\nlowland and the wilderness slopes, and\nall their kings; he left none remaining,\nbut utterly destroyed all that breathed,\nas the LORD God of Israel had\ncommanded.\nAnd Joshua conquered them from\nKadesh Barnea as far as Gaza, and all\nthe country of Goshen, even as far as\nGibeon.\nAll these kings and their land Joshua\ntook at one time, because the LORD\nGod of Israel fought for Israel.\nThen Joshua returned, and all Israel\nwith him, to the camp at Gilgal.\n11And it came to pass, when Jabin\nking of Hazor heard these things, that\nhe sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the\nking of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph,\nand to the kings who were from the\nnorth, in the mountains, in the plain\nsouth of Chinneroth, in the lowland, and\nin the heights of Dor on the west,\nto the Canaanites in the east and in the\nwest, the Amorite, the Hittite, the\nPerizzite, the Jebusite in the mountains,\nand the Hivite below Hermon in the land\nof Mizpah.\nSo they went out, they and all their\narmies with them, as many people as\nthe sand that is on the seashore in\nmultitude, with very many horses and\nchariots.\nAnd when all these kings had met\ntogether, they came and camped\ntogether at the waters of Merom to fight\nagainst Israel.\nBut the LORD said to Joshua, \"Do not\nbe afraid because of them, for tomorrow\nabout this time I will deliver all of them\nslain before Israel. You shall hamstring\ntheir horses and burn their chariots with\nfire.\"\nSo Joshua and all the people of war\nwith him came against them suddenly\nby the waters of Merom, and they\nattacked them.\nAnd the LORD delivered them into the\nhand of Israel, who defeated them and\nchased them to Greater Sidon, to the\nBrook Misrephoth, and to the Valley of\nMizpah eastward; they attacked them\nuntil they left none of them remaining.\nSo Joshua did to them as the LORD\nhad told him: he hamstrung their horses\nand burned their chariots with fire.\nJoshua turned back at that time and\ntook Hazor, and struck its king with the\nsword; for Hazor was formerly the head\nof all those kingdoms.\nAnd they struck all the people who\nwere in it with the edge of the sword,\nutterly destroying them. There was none\nleft breathing. Then he burned Hazor\nwith fire.\nThus Joshua took all this land: the\nmountain country, all the South, all the\nland of Goshen, the lowland, and the\nJordan plain --the mountains of Israel\nand its lowlands,\nfrom Mount Halak and the ascent to\nSeir, even as far as Baal Gad in the\nValley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon.\nHe captured all their kings, and struck\nthem down and killed them.\nJoshua made war a long time with all\nthose kings.\nThere was not a city that made peace\nwith the children of Israel, except the\nHivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. All\nthe others they took in battle.\nSo all the cities of those kings, and all\ntheir kings, Joshua took and struck with\nthe edge of the sword. He utterly\ndestroyed them, as Moses the servant\nof the LORD had commanded.\nBut as for the cities that stood on their\nmounds, Israel burned none of them,\nexcept Hazor only, which Joshua\nburned.\nAnd all the spoil of these cities and the\nlivestock, the children of Israel took as\nbooty for themselves; but they struck\nevery man with the edge of the sword\nuntil they had destroyed them, and they\nleft none breathing.\nAs the LORD had commanded Moses\nhis servant, so Moses commanded\nJoshua, and so Joshua did. He left\nnothing undone of all that the LORD had\ncommanded Moses.\nFor it was of the LORD to harden their\nhearts, that they should come against\nIsrael in battle, that He might utterly\ndestroy them, and that they might\nreceive no mercy, but that He might\ndestroy them, as the LORD had\ncommanded Moses.\nAnd at that time Joshua came and cut\noff the Anakim from the mountains: from\nHebron, from Debir, from Anab, from all\nthe mountains of Judah, and from all the\nmountains of Israel; Joshua utterly\ndestroyed them with their cities.\nNone of the Anakim were left in the\nland of the children of Israel; they\nremained only in Gaza, in Gath, and in\nAshdod.\nSo Joshua took the whole land,\naccording to all that the LORD had said\nto Moses; and Joshua gave it as an\ninheritance to Israel according to their\ndivisions by their tribes. Then the land\nrested from war.\nto the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half\nthe tribe of Manasseh.\n12These are the kings of the land\nwhom the children of Israel defeated,\nand whose land they possessed on the\nother side of the Jordan toward the\nrising of the sun, from the River Arnon to\nMount Hermon, and all the eastern\nJordan plain:\nOne king was Sihon king of the\nAmorites, who dwelt in Heshbon and\nruled half of Gilead, from Aroer, which is\non the bank of the River Arnon, from the\nmiddle of that river, even as far as the\nRiver Jabbok, which is the border of the\nAmmonites,\nAnd these are the kings of the country\nwhich Joshua and the children of Israel\nconquered on this side of the Jordan, on\nthe west, from Baal Gad in the Valley of\nLebanon as far as Mount Halak and the\nascent to Seir, which Joshua gave to the\ntribes of Israel as a possession\naccording to their divisions,\nin the mountain country, in the lowlands,\nin the Jordan plain, in the slopes, in the\nwilderness, and in the South--the Hittites,\nthe Amorites, the Canaanites, the\nPerizzites, the Hivites, and the\nJebusites:\nthe king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai,\nwhich is beside Bethel, one;\nand the eastern Jordan plain from the\nSea of Chinneroth as far as the Sea of\nthe Arabah (the Salt Sea), the road to\nBeth Jeshimoth, and southward below\nthe slopes of Pisgah.\nthe king of Jerusalem, one; the king of\nHebron, one;\nthe king of Jarmuth, one; the king of\nLachish, one;\nThe other king was Og king of Bashan\nand his territory, who was of the\nremnant of the giants, who dwelt at\nAshtaroth and at Edrei,\nthe king of Eglon, one; the king of\nGezer, one;\nand reigned over Mount Hermon, over\nSalcah, over all Bashan, as far as the\nborder of the Geshurites and the\nMaachathites, and over half of Gilead to\nthe border of Sihon king of Heshbon.\nthe king of Debir, one; the king of\nGeder, one;\nthe king of Hormah, one; the king of\nArad, one;\nThese Moses the servant of the LORD\nand the children of Israel had\nconquered; and Moses the servant of\nthe LORD had given it as a possession\nthe king of Libnah, one; the king of\nAdullam, one;\nthe king of Makkedah, one; the king of\nBethel, one;\nthe king of Tappuah, one; the king of\nHepher, one;\nGittites, and the Ekronites; also the\nAvites;\nthe king of Aphek, one; the king of\nLasharon, one;\nthe king of Madon, one; the king of\nHazor, one;\nthe king of Shimron Meron, one; the\nking of Achshaph, one;\nfrom the south, all the land of the\nCanaanites, and Mearah that belongs to\nthe Sidonians as far as Aphek, to the\nborder of the Amorites;\nthe land of the Gebalites, and all\nLebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal\nGad below Mount Hermon as far as the\nentrance to Hamath;\nthe king of Taanach, one; the king of\nMegiddo, one;\nthe king of Kedesh, one; the king of\nJokneam in Carmel, one;\nthe king of Dor in the heights of Dor,\none; the king of the people of Gilgal,\none;\nthe king of Tirzah, one--all the kings,\nthirty-one.\nall the inhabitants of the mountains\nfrom Lebanon as far as the Brook\nMisrephoth, and all the Sidonians--them\nI will drive out from before the children\nof Israel; only divide it by lot to Israel as\nan inheritance, as I have commanded\nyou.\nNow therefore, divide this land as an\ninheritance to the nine tribes and half\nthe tribe of Manasseh.\"\n13Now Joshua was old, advanced in\nyears. And the LORD said to him: \"You\nare old, advanced in years, and there\nremains very much land yet to be\npossessed.\nWith the other half-tribe the Reubenites\nand the Gadites received their\ninheritance, which Moses had given\nthem, beyond the Jordan eastward, as\nMoses the servant of the LORD had\ngiven them:\nThis is the land that yet remains: all the\nterritory of the Philistines and all that of\nthe Geshurites,\nfrom Aroer which is on the bank of the\nRiver Arnon, and the town that is in the\nmidst of the ravine, and all the plain of\nMedeba as far as Dibon;\nfrom Sihor, which is east of Egypt, as\nfar as the border of Ekron northward\n(which is counted as Canaanite); the\nfive lords of the Philistines--the Gazites,\nthe Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the\nall the cities of Sihon king of the\nAmorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as\nfar as the border of the children of\nAmmon;\nGilead, and the border of the\nGeshurites and Maachathites, all Mount\nHermon, and all Bashan as far as\nSalcah;\nall the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who\nreigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei, who\nremained of the remnant of the giants;\nfor Moses had defeated and cast out\nthese.\nNevertheless the children of Israel did\nnot drive out the Geshurites or the\nMaachathites, but the Geshurites and\nthe Maachathites dwell among the\nIsraelites until this day.\nOnly to the tribe of Levi he had given\nno inheritance; the sacrifices of the\nLORD God of Israel made by fire are\ntheir inheritance, as He said to them.\nall the cities of the plain and all the\nkingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites,\nwho reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses\nhad struck with the princes of Midian:\nEvi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, who\nwere princes of Sihon dwelling in the\ncountry.\nThe children of Israel also killed with\nthe sword Balaam the son of Beor, the\nsoothsayer, among those who were\nkilled by them.\nAnd the border of the children of\nReuben was the bank of the Jordan.\nThis was the inheritance of the children\nof Reuben according to their families,\nthe cities and their villages.\nMoses also had given an inheritance\nto the tribe of Gad, to the children of\nGad according to their families.\nAnd Moses had given to the tribe of\nthe children of Reuben an inheritance\naccording to their families.\nTheir territory was from Aroer, which is\non the bank of the River Arnon, and the\ncity that is in the midst of the ravine, and\nall the plain by Medeba;\nTheir territory was Jazer, and all the\ncities of Gilead, and half the land of the\nAmmonites as far as Aroer, which is\nbefore Rabbah,\nand from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah\nand Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the\nborder of Debir,\nHeshbon and all its cities that are in\nthe plain: Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth\nBaal Meon,\nJahaza, Kedemoth, Mephaath,\nKirjathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on\nthe mountain of the valley,\nBeth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and\nBeth Jeshimoth--\nand in the valley Beth Haram, Beth\nNimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest\nof the kingdom of Sihon king of\nHeshbon, with the Jordan as its border,\nas far as the edge of the Sea of\nChinnereth, on the other side of the\nJordan eastward.\nThis is the inheritance of the children\nof Gad according to their families, the\ncities and their villages.\nMoses also had given an inheritance\nto half the tribe of Manasseh; it was for\nhalf the tribe of the children of\nManasseh according to their families:\nLevites he had given no inheritance\namong them.\nTheir territory was from Mahanaim, all\nBashan, all the kingdom of Og king of\nBashan, and all the towns of Jair which\nare in Bashan, sixty cities;\nFor the children of Joseph were two\ntribes: Manasseh and Ephraim.

And Caleb the son of\nJephunneh the Kenizzite said to him:\n\"You know the word which the LORD\nsaid to Moses the man of God\nconcerning you and me in Kadesh\nBarnea.\nBut to the tribe of Levi Moses had\ngiven no inheritance; the LORD God of\nIsrael was their inheritance, as He had\nsaid to them.\n14These are the areas which the\nchildren of Israel inherited in the land of\nCanaan, which Eleazar the priest,\nJoshua the son of Nun, and the heads\nof the fathers of the tribes of the children\nof Israel distributed as an inheritance to\nthem.\nTheir inheritance was by lot, as the\nLORD had commanded by the hand of\nMoses, for the nine tribes and the halftribe.\nFor Moses had given the inheritance of\nthe two tribes and the half-tribe on the\nother side of the Jordan; but to the\nI was forty years old when Moses the\nservant of the LORD sent me from\nKadesh Barnea to spy out the land, and\nI brought back word to him as it was in\nmy heart.\nNevertheless my brethren who went up\nwith me made the heart of the people\nmelt, but I wholly followed the LORD my\nGod.\nSo Moses swore on that day, saying,\n\"Surely the land where your foot has\ntrodden shall be your inheritance and\nyour children's forever, because you\nhave wholly followed the LORD my\nGod.'\nAnd now, behold, the LORD has kept\nme alive, as He said, these forty-five\nyears, ever since the LORD spoke this\nword to Moses while Israel wandered in\nthe wilderness; and now, here I am this\nday, eighty-five years old.\nAnd their southern border began at the\nshore of the Salt Sea, from the bay that\nfaces southward.\nAs yet I am as strong this day as on\nthe day that Moses sent me; just as my\nstrength was then, so now is my\nstrength for war, both for going out and\nfor coming in.\nThen it went out to the southern side of\nthe Ascent of Akrabbim, passed along to\nZin, ascended on the south side of\nKadesh Barnea, passed along to\nHezron, went up to Adar, and went\naround to Karkaa.\nNow therefore, give me this mountain\nof which the LORD spoke in that day; for\nyou heard in that day how the Anakim\nwere there, and that the cities were\ngreat and fortified. It may be that the\nLORD will be with me, and I shall be\nable to drive them out as the LORD\nsaid.\"\nAnd Joshua blessed him, and gave\nHebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh\nas an inheritance.\nFrom there it passed toward Azmon\nand went out to the Brook of Egypt; and\nthe border ended at the sea. This shall\nbe your southern border.\nThe east border was the Salt Sea as far\nas the mouth of the Jordan. And the\nborder on the northern quarter began at\nthe bay of the sea at the mouth of the\nJordan.\nHebron\ntherefore\nbecame\nthe\ninheritance of Caleb the son of\nJephunneh the Kenizzite to this day,\nbecause he wholly followed the LORD\nGod of Israel.\nAnd the name of Hebron formerly was\nKirjath Arba (Arba was the greatest man\namong the Anakim). Then the land had\nrest from war.\n15So this was the lot of the tribe of\nthe children of Judah according to their\nfamilies: The border of Edom at the\nWilderness of Zin southward was the\nextreme southern boundary.\nThe border went up to Beth Hoglah and\npassed north of Beth Arabah; and the\nborder went up to the stone of Bohan\nthe son of Reuben.\nThen the border went up toward Debir\nfrom the Valley of Achor, and it turned\nnorthward toward Gilgal, which is before\nthe Ascent of Adummim, which is on the\nsouth side of the valley. The border\ncontinued toward the waters of En\nShemesh and ended at En Rogel.\nAnd the border went up by the Valley of\nthe Son of Hinnom to the southern slope\nof the Jebusite city (which is Jerusalem).\nThe border went up to the top of the\nmountain that lies before the Valley of\nHinnom westward, which is at the end of\nthe Valley of Rephaim northward.\nThen the border went around from the\ntop of the hill to the fountain of the water\nof Nephtoah, and extended to the cities\nof Mount Ephron. And the border went\naround to Baalah (which is Kirjath\nJearim).\nThen the border turned westward from\nBaalah to Mount Seir, passed along to\nthe side of Mount Jearim on the north\n(which is Chesalon), went down to Beth\nShemesh, and passed on to Timnah.\nAnd the border went out to the side of\nEkron northward. Then the border went\naround to Shicron, passed along to\nMount Baalah, and extended to Jabneel;\nand the border ended at the sea.\nThe west border was the coastline of\nthe Great Sea. This is the boundary of\nthe children of Judah all around\naccording to their families.\nNow to Caleb the son of Jephunneh\nhe gave a share among the children of\nJudah, according to the commandment\nof the LORD to Joshua, namely, Kirjath\nArba, which is Hebron (Arba was the\nfather of Anak).\nSo Othniel the son of Kenaz, the\nbrother of Caleb, took it; and he gave\nhim Achsah his daughter as wife.\nNow it was so, when she came to him,\nthat she persuaded him to ask her father\nfor a field.

So they made an end of\ndividing the country.\nAnd he shall dwell in that city until he\nstands before the congregation for\njudgment, and until the death of the one\nwho is high priest in those days. Then\nthe slayer may return and come to his\nown city and his own house, to the city\nfrom which he fled.\"'\nSo they appointed Kedesh in Galilee, in\nthe mountains of Naphtali, Shechem in\nthe mountains of Ephraim, and Kirjath\nArba (which is Hebron) in the mountains\nof Judah.\n20The LORD also spoke to Joshua,\nsaying,\n\"Speak to the children of Israel, saying:\n\"Appoint for yourselves cities of refuge,\nof which I spoke to you through Moses,\nthat the slayer who kills a person\naccidentally or unintentionally may flee\nthere; and they shall be your refuge\nfrom the avenger of blood.\nAnd when he flees to one of those\ncities, and stands at the entrance of the\ngate of the city, and declares his case in\nthe hearing of the elders of that city,\nthey shall take him into the city as one\nof them, and give him a place, that he\nmay dwell among them.\nAnd on the other side of the Jordan, by\nJericho eastward, they assigned Bezer\nin the wilderness on the plain, from the\ntribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead, from\nthe tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan,\nfrom the tribe of Manasseh.\nThese were the cities appointed for all\nthe children of Israel and for the\nstranger who dwelt among them, that\nwhoever killed a person accidentally\nmight flee there, and not die by the hand\nof the avenger of blood until he stood\nbefore the congregation.\n21Then the heads of the fathers'\nhouses of the Levites came near to\nEleazar the priest, to Joshua the son of\nNun, and to the heads of the fathers'\nhouses of the tribes of the children of\nIsrael.\nAnd they spoke to them at Shiloh in the\nland of Canaan, saying, \"The LORD\ncommanded through Moses to give us\ncities to dwell in, with their commonlands for our livestock.\"\nSo the children of Israel gave to the\nLevites from their inheritance, at the\ncommandment of the LORD, these\ncities and their common-lands:\nNow the lot came out for the families of\nthe Kohathites. And the children of\nAaron the priest, who were of the\nLevites, had thirteen cities by lot from\nthe tribe of Judah, from the tribe of\nSimeon, and from the tribe of Benjamin.\nthe children of Simeon these cities\nwhich are designated by name,\nwhich were for the children of Aaron,\none of the families of the Kohathites,\nwho were of the children of Levi; for the\nlot was theirs first.\nAnd they gave them Kirjath Arba (Arba\nwas the father of Anak), which is Hebron,\nin the mountains of Judah, with the\ncommon-land surrounding it.\nBut the fields of the city and its villages\nthey gave to Caleb the son of\nJephunneh as his possession.\nThe rest of the children of Kohath had\nten cities by lot from the families of the\ntribe of Ephraim, from the tribe of Dan,\nand from the half-tribe of Manasseh.\nThus to the children of Aaron the priest\nthey gave Hebron with its common-land\n(a city of refuge for the slayer), Libnah\nwith its common-land,\nAnd the children of Gershon had\nthirteen cities by lot from the families of\nthe tribe of Issachar, from the tribe of\nAsher, from the tribe of Naphtali, and\nfrom the half-tribe of Manasseh in\nBashan.\nThe children of Merari according to\ntheir families had twelve cities from the\ntribe of Reuben, from the tribe of Gad,\nand from the tribe of Zebulun.\nAnd the children of Israel gave these\ncities with their common-lands by lot to\nthe Levites, as the LORD had\ncommanded by the hand of Moses.\nJattir with its common-land, Eshtemoa\nwith its common-land,\nHolon with its common-land, Debir\nwith its common-land,\nAin with its common-land, Juttah with\nits common-land, and Beth Shemesh\nwith its common-land: nine cities from\nthose two tribes;\nand from the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon\nwith its common-land, Geba with its\ncommon-land,\nAnathoth with its common-land, and\nAlmon with its common-land: four cities.\nSo they gave from the tribe of the\nchildren of Judah and from the tribe of\nAll the cities of the children of Aaron,\nthe priests, were thirteen cities with their\ncommon-lands.\nAnd the families of the children of\nKohath, the Levites, the rest of the\nchildren of Kohath, even they had the\ncities of their lot from the tribe of\nEphraim.\nFor they gave them Shechem with its\ncommon-land in the mountains of\nEphraim (a city of refuge for the slayer),\nGezer with its common-land,\nKibzaim with its common-land, and\nBeth Horon with its common-land: four\ncities;\nand from the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with\nits common-land, Gibbethon with its\ncommon-land,\nAijalon with its common-land, and\nGath Rimmon with its common-land:\nfour cities;\nand from the half-tribe of Manasseh,\nTanach with its common-land and Gath\nRimmon with its common-land: two\ncities.\nJarmuth with its common-land, and En\nGannim with its common-land: four\ncities;\nand from the tribe of Asher, Mishal\nwith its common-land, Abdon with its\ncommon-land,\nHelkath with its common-land, and\nRehob with its common-land: four cities;\nand from the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh\nin Galilee with its common-land (a city of\nrefuge for the slayer), Hammoth Dor\nwith its common-land, and Kartan with\nits common-land: three cities.\nAll the cities of the Gershonites\naccording to their families were thirteen\ncities with their common-lands.\nAnd to the families of the children of\nMerari, the rest of the Levites, from the\ntribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its\ncommon-land, Kartah with its commonland,\nAll the ten cities with their commonlands were for the rest of the families of\nthe children of Kohath.\nDimnah with its common-land, and\nNahalal with its common-land: four\ncities;\nAlso to the children of Gershon, of the\nfamilies of the Levites, from the other\nhalf-tribe of Manasseh, they gave Golan\nin Bashan with its common-land (a city\nof refuge for the slayer), and Be\nEshterah with its common-land: two\ncities;\nand from the tribe of Reuben, Bezer\nwith its common-land, Jahaz with its\ncommon-land,\nKedemoth with its common-land, and\nMephaath with its common-land: four\ncities;\nand from the tribe of Issachar, Kishion\nwith its common-land, Daberath with its\ncommon-land,\nand from the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in\nGilead with its common-land (a city of\nrefuge for the slayer), Mahanaim with its\ncommon-land,\nHeshbon with its common-land, and\nJazer with its common-land: four cities\nin all.\nYou have not left your brethren these\nmany days, up to this day, but have kept\nthe charge of the commandment of the\nLORD your God.\nSo all the cities for the children of\nMerari according to their families, the\nrest of the families of the Levites, were\nby their lot twelve cities.\nAll the cities of the Levites within the\npossession of the children of Israel were\nforty-eight cities with their commonlands.\nEvery one of these cities had its\ncommon-land surrounding it;

Divide the spoil of your\nenemies with your brethren.\"\n22Then\nand said to them: \"You have kept all\nthat Moses the servant of the LORD\ncommanded you, and have obeyed my\nvoice in all that I commanded you.\nSo the children of Reuben, the children\nof Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh\nreturned, and departed from the children\nof Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of\nCanaan, to go to the country of Gilead,\nto the land of their possession, which\nthey had obtained according to the word\nof the LORD by the hand of Moses.\nAnd when they came to the region of\nthe Jordan which is in the land of\nCanaan, the children of Reuben, the\nchildren of Gad, and half the tribe of\nManasseh built an altar there by the\nJordan--a great, impressive altar.\n\"Thus says the whole congregation of\nthe LORD: \"What treachery is this that\nyou have committed against the God of\nIsrael, to turn away this day from\nfollowing the LORD, in that you have\nbuilt for yourselves an altar, that you\nmight rebel this day against the LORD?\nIs the iniquity of Peor not enough for\nus, from which we are not cleansed till\nthis day, although there was a plague in\nthe congregation of the LORD,\nNow the children of Israel heard\nsomeone say, \"Behold, the children of\nReuben, the children of Gad, and half\nthe tribe of Manasseh have built an altar\non the frontier of the land of Canaan, in\nthe region of the Jordan--on the children\nof Israel's side.\"\nbut that you must turn away this day\nfrom following the LORD? And it shall\nbe, if you rebel today against the LORD,\nthat tomorrow He will be angry with the\nwhole congregation of Israel.\nAnd when the children of Israel heard\nof it, the whole congregation of the\nchildren of Israel gathered together at\nShiloh to go to war against them.\nThen the children of Israel sent\nPhinehas the son of Eleazar the priest\nto the children of Reuben, to the\nchildren of Gad, and to half the tribe of\nManasseh, into the land of Gilead,\nand with him ten rulers, one ruler each\nfrom the chief house of every tribe of\nIsrael; and each one was the head of\nthe house of his father among the\ndivisions of Israel.\nThen they came to the children of\nReuben, to the children of Gad, and to\nhalf the tribe of Manasseh, to the land of\nGilead, and they spoke with them,\nsaying,\nNevertheless, if the land of your\npossession is unclean, then cross over\nto the land of the possession of the\nLORD, where the LORD's tabernacle\nstands, and take possession among us;\nbut do not rebel against the LORD, nor\nrebel against us, by building yourselves\nan altar besides the altar of the LORD\nour God.\nDid not Achan the son of Zerah\ncommit a trespass in the accursed thing,\nand wrath fell on all the congregation of\nIsrael? And that man did not perish\nalone in his iniquity.\"'\nThen the children of Reuben, the\nchildren of Gad, and half the tribe of\nManasseh answered and said to the\nheads of the divisions of Israel:\n\"The LORD God of gods, the LORD\nGod of gods, He knows, and let Israel\nitself know--if it is in rebellion, or if in\ntreachery against the LORD, do not\nsave us this day.\nIf we have built ourselves an altar to\nturn from following the LORD, or if to\noffer on it burnt offerings or grain\nofferings, or if to offer peace offerings on\nit, let the LORD Himself require an\naccount.\nFar be it from us that we should rebel\nagainst the LORD, and turn from\nfollowing the LORD this day, to build an\naltar for burnt offerings, for grain\nofferings, or for sacrifices, besides the\naltar of the LORD our God which is\nbefore His tabernacle.\"\nBut in fact we have done it for fear, for\na reason, saying, \"In time to come your\ndescendants may speak to our\ndescendants, saying, \"What have you to\ndo with the LORD God of Israel?\nNow when Phinehas the priest and the\nrulers of the congregation, the heads of\nthe divisions of Israel who were with him,\nheard the words that the children of\nReuben, the children of Gad, and the\nchildren of Manasseh spoke, it pleased\nthem.\nFor the LORD has made the Jordan a\nborder between you and us, you\nchildren of Reuben and children of Gad.\nYou have no part in the LORD.\" So your\ndescendants\nwould\nmake\nour\ndescendants cease fearing the LORD.'\nTherefore we said, \"Let us now\nprepare to build ourselves an altar, not\nfor burnt offering nor for sacrifice,\nbut that it may be a witness between\nyou and us and our generations after us,\nthat we may perform the service of the\nLORD before Him with our burnt\nofferings, with our sacrifices, and with\nour\npeace\nofferings;\nthat\nyour\ndescendants may not say to our\ndescendants in time to come, \"You have\nno part in the LORD.\"'\nTherefore we said that it will be, when\nthey say this to us or to our generations\nin time to come, that we may say, \"Here\nis the replica of the altar of the LORD\nwhich our fathers made, though not for\nburnt offerings nor for sacrifices; but it is\na witness between you and us.'\nThen Phinehas the son of Eleazar the\npriest said to the children of Reuben, the\nchildren of Gad, and the children of\nManasseh, \"This day we perceive that\nthe LORD is among us, because you\nhave not committed this treachery\nagainst the LORD. Now you have\ndelivered the children of Israel out of the\nhand of the LORD.\"\nAnd Phinehas the son of Eleazar the\npriest, and the rulers, returned from the\nchildren of Reuben and the children of\nGad, from the land of Gilead to the land\nof Canaan, to the children of Israel, and\nbrought back word to them.\nSo the thing pleased the children of\nIsrael, and the children of Israel blessed\nGod; they spoke no more of going\nagainst them in battle, to destroy the\nland where the children of Reuben and\nGad dwelt.\nThe children of Reuben and the\nchildren of Gad called the altar, Witness,\n\"For it is a witness between us that the\nLORD is God.\"\n23Now it came to pass, a long time\nafter the LORD had given rest to Israel\nfrom all their enemies round about, that\nJoshua was old, advanced in age.\nAnd Joshua called for all Israel, for their\nelders, for their heads, for their judges,\nand for their officers, and said to them: \"I\nam old, advanced in age.\nYou have seen all that the LORD your\nGod has done to all these nations\nbecause of you, for the LORD your God\nis He who has fought for you.\nSee, I have divided to you by lot these\nnations that remain, to be an inheritance\nfor your tribes, from the Jordan, with all\nthe nations that I have cut off, as far as\nthe Great Sea westward.\nAnd the LORD your God will expel\nthem from before you and drive them\nout of your sight. So you shall possess\ntheir land, as the LORD your God\npromised you.\nTherefore be very courageous to keep\nand to do all that is written in the Book\nof the Law of Moses, lest you turn aside\nfrom it to the right hand or to the left,\nand lest you go among these nations,\nthese who remain among you. You shall\nnot make mention of the name of their\ngods, nor cause anyone to swear by\nthem; you shall not serve them nor bow\ndown to them,\nbut you shall hold fast to the LORD\nyour God, as you have done to this day.\nFor the LORD has driven out from\nbefore you great and strong nations; but\nas for you, no one has been able to\nstand against you to this day.\nOne man of you shall chase a\nthousand, for the LORD your God is He\nwho fights for you, as He promised you.\nTherefore take careful heed to\nyourselves, that you love the LORD your\nGod.\nOr else, if indeed you do go back, and\ncling to the remnant of these nations-these that remain among you--and\nmake marriages with them, and go in to\nthem and they to you,\nknow for certain that the LORD your\nGod will no longer drive out these\nnations from before you. But they shall\nbe snares and traps to you, and\nscourges on your sides and thorns in\nyour eyes, until you perish from this\ngood land which the LORD your God\nhas given you.\n\"Behold, this day I am going the way of\nall the earth.

And your eyes saw\nwhat I did in Egypt. Then you dwelt in\nthe wilderness a long time.\ntribes of Israel to Shechem and called\nfor the elders of Israel, for their heads,\nfor their judges, and for their officers;\nand they presented themselves before\nGod.\nAnd I brought you into the land of the\nAmorites, who dwelt on the other side of\nthe Jordan, and they fought with you.\nBut I gave them into your hand, that you\nmight possess their land, and I\ndestroyed them from before you.\nAnd Joshua said to all the people,\n\"Thus says the LORD God of Israel:\n\"Your fathers, including Terah, the father\nof Abraham and the father of Nahor,\ndwelt on the other side of the River in\nold times; and they served other gods.\nThen I took your father Abraham from\nthe other side of the River, led him\nthroughout all the land of Canaan, and\nmultiplied his descendants and gave\nhim Isaac.\nTo Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To\nEsau I gave the mountains of Seir to\npossess, but Jacob and his children\nwent down to Egypt.\nAlso I sent Moses and Aaron, and I\nplagued Egypt, according to what I did\namong them. Afterward I brought you\nout.\n\"Then I brought your fathers out of\nEgypt, and you came to the sea; and the\nThen Balak the son of Zippor, king of\nMoab, arose to make war against Israel,\nand sent and called Balaam the son of\nBeor to curse you.\nBut I would not listen to Balaam;\ntherefore he continued to bless you. So I\ndelivered you out of his hand.\nThen you went over the Jordan and\ncame to Jericho. And the men of Jericho\nfought against you--also the Amorites,\nthe Perizzites, the Canaanites, the\nHittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and\nthe Jebusites. But I delivered them into\nyour hand.\nI sent the hornet before you which\ndrove them out from before you, also\nthe two kings of the Amorites, but not\nwith your sword or with your bow.\nI have given you a land for which you\ndid not labor, and cities which you did\nnot build, and you dwell in them; you eat\nof the vineyards and olive groves which\nyou did not plant.'\nyou harm and consume you, after He\nhas done you good.\"\n\"Now therefore, fear the LORD, serve\nHim in sincerity and in truth, and put\naway the gods which your fathers\nserved on the other side of the River\nand in Egypt. Serve the LORD!\nAnd if it seems evil to you to serve the\nLORD, choose for yourselves this day\nwhom you will serve, whether the gods\nwhich your fathers served that were on\nthe other side of the River, or the gods\nof the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.\nBut as for me and my house, we will\nserve the LORD.\"\nAnd the people said to Joshua, \"No,\nbut we will serve the LORD!\"\nSo Joshua said to the people, \"You\nare witnesses against yourselves that\nyou have chosen the LORD for\nyourselves, to serve Him.\" And they said,\n\"We are witnesses!\"\n\"Now therefore,\" he said, \"put away\nthe foreign gods which are among you,\nand incline your heart to the LORD God\nof Israel.\"\nSo the people answered and said: \"Far\nbe it from us that we should forsake the\nLORD to serve other gods;\nAnd the people said to Joshua, \"The\nLORD our God we will serve, and His\nvoice we will obey!\"\nfor the LORD our God is He who\nbrought us and our fathers up out of the\nland of Egypt, from the house of\nbondage, who did those great signs in\nour sight, and preserved us in all the\nway that we went and among all the\npeople through whom we passed.\nAnd the LORD drove out from before\nus all the people, including the Amorites\nwho dwelt in the land. We also will serve\nthe LORD, for He is our God.\"\nBut Joshua said to the people, \"You\ncannot serve the LORD, for He is a holy\nGod. He is a jealous God; He will not\nforgive your transgressions nor your\nsins.\nIf you forsake the LORD and serve\nforeign gods, then He will turn and do\nSo Joshua made a covenant with the\npeople that day, and made for them a\nstatute and an ordinance in Shechem.\nThen Joshua wrote these words in the\nBook of the Law of God. And he took a\nlarge stone, and set it up there under\nthe oak that was by the sanctuary of the\nLORD.\nAnd Joshua said to all the people,\n\"Behold, this stone shall be a witness to\nus, for it has heard all the words of the\nLORD which He spoke to us. It shall\ntherefore be a witness to you, lest you\ndeny your God.\"\nSo Joshua let the people depart, each\nto his own inheritance.\nNow it came to pass after these things\nthat Joshua the son of Nun, the servant\nof the LORD, died, being one hundred\nand ten years old.\nAnd they buried him within the border\nof his inheritance at Timnath Serah,\nwhich is in the mountains of Ephraim, on\nthe north side of Mount Gaash.\nThe bones of Joseph, which the\nchildren of Israel had brought up out of\nEgypt, they buried at Shechem, in the\nplot of ground which Jacob had bought\nfrom the sons of Hamor the father of\nShechem for one hundred pieces of\nsilver, and which had become an\ninheritance of the children of Joseph.\nIsrael served the LORD all the days of\nJoshua, and all the days of the elders\nwho outlived Joshua, who had known all\nthe works of the LORD which He had\ndone for Israel.\nAnd Eleazar the son of Aaron died.\nThey buried him in a hill belonging to\nPhinehas his son, which was given to\nhim in the mountains of Ephraim.\nJudges\n1Now after the death of Joshua it\ncame to pass that the children of Israel\nasked the LORD, saying, \"Who shall be\nfirst to go up for us against the\nCanaanites to fight against them?\"\nAnd the LORD said, \"Judah shall go up.\nIndeed I have delivered the land into his\nhand.\"\nSo Judah said to Simeon his brother,\n\"Come up with me to my allotted\nterritory, that we may fight against the\nCanaanites; and I will likewise go with\nyou to your allotted territory.\" And\nSimeon went with him.\nThen Judah went up, and the LORD\ndelivered the Canaanites and the\nPerizzites into their hand; and they killed\nten thousand men at Bezek.\nAnd they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek,\nand fought against him; and they\ndefeated the Canaanites and the\nPerizzites.\nThen Adoni-Bezek fled, and they\npursued him and caught him and cut off\nhis thumbs and big toes.\nAnd Adoni-Bezek said, \"Seventy kings\nwith their thumbs and big toes cut off\nused to gather scraps under my table;\nas I have done, so God has repaid me.\"\nThen they brought him to Jerusalem,\nand there he died.\nNow the children of Judah fought\nagainst Jerusalem and took it; they\nstruck it with the edge of the sword and\nset the city on fire.\nAnd afterward the children of Judah\nwent down to fight against the\nCanaanites who dwelt in the mountains,\nin the South, and in the lowland.\nThen Judah went against the\nCanaanites who dwelt in Hebron. (Now\nthe name of Hebron was formerly Kirjath\nArba.) And they killed Sheshai, Ahiman,\nand Talmai.\nFrom there they went against the\ninhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir\nwas formerly Kirjath Sepher.)\nThen Caleb said, \"Whoever attacks\nKirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will\ngive my daughter Achsah as wife.\"\nAnd Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's\nyounger brother, took it; so he gave him\nhis daughter Achsah as wife.\nNow it happened, when she came to\nhim, that she urged him to ask her father\nfor a field. And she dismounted from her\ndonkey, and Caleb said to her, \"What do\nyou wish?\"\nSo she said to him, \"Give me a\nblessing; since you have given me land\nin the South, give me also springs of\nwater.\" And Caleb gave her the upper\nsprings and the lower springs.\nNow the children of the Kenite, Moses'\nfather-in-law, went up from the City of\nPalms with the children of Judah into the\nWilderness of Judah, which lies in the\nSouth near Arad; and they went and\ndwelt among the people.\nAnd Judah went with his brother\nSimeon, and they attacked the\nCanaanites who inhabited Zephath, and\nutterly destroyed it. So the name of the\ncity was called Hormah.\n\"Please show us the entrance to the city,\nand we will show you mercy.\"\nSo he showed them the entrance to\nthe city, and they struck the city with the\nedge of the sword; but they let the man\nand all his family go.\nAnd the man went to the land of the\nHittites, built a city, and called its name\nLuz, which is its name to this day.\nAlso Judah took Gaza with its territory,\nAshkelon with its territory, and Ekron\nwith its territory.\nSo the LORD was with Judah. And\nthey drove out the mountaineers, but\nthey could not drive out the inhabitants\nof the lowland, because they had\nchariots of iron.\nAnd they gave Hebron to Caleb, as\nMoses had said. Then he expelled from\nthere the three sons of Anak.\nHowever, Manasseh did not drive out\nthe inhabitants of Beth Shean and its\nvillages, or Taanach and its villages, or\nthe inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or\nthe inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages,\nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its\nvillages; for the Canaanites were\ndetermined to dwell in that land.\nAnd it came to pass, when Israel was\nstrong, that they put the Canaanites\nunder tribute, but did not completely\ndrive them out.\nBut the children of Benjamin did not\ndrive out the Jebusites who inhabited\nJerusalem; so the Jebusites dwell with\nthe children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to\nthis day.\nAnd the house of Joseph also went up\nagainst Bethel, and the LORD was with\nthem.\nSo the house of Joseph sent men to\nspy out Bethel. (The name of the city\nwas formerly Luz.)\nAnd when the spies saw a man\ncoming out of the city, they said to him,\nNor did Ephraim drive out the\nCanaanites who dwelt in Gezer; so the\nCanaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.\nNor did Zebulun drive out the\ninhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of\nNahalol; so the Canaanites dwelt among\nthem, and were put under tribute.\nNor did Asher drive out the inhabitants\nof Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of\nAhlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.\nSo the Asherites dwelt among the\nCanaanites, the inhabitants of the land;\nfor they did not drive them out.\nNor did Naphtali drive out the\ninhabitants of Beth Shemesh or the\ninhabitants of Beth Anath; but they dwelt\namong the Canaanites, the inhabitants\nof the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants\nof Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were\nput under tribute to them.\nAnd the Amorites forced the children\nof Dan into the mountains, for they\nwould not allow them to come down to\nthe valley;\nand the Amorites were determined to\ndwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in\nShaalbim; yet when the strength of the\nhouse of Joseph became greater, they\nwere put under tribute.\nNow the boundary of the Amorites was\nfrom the Ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela,\nand upward.\n2Then the Angel of the LORD came\nup from Gilgal to Bochim, and said: \"I\nled you up from Egypt and brought you\nto the land of which I swore to your\nfathers; and I said, \"I will never break My\ncovenant with you.\nAnd you shall make no covenant with\nthe inhabitants of this land; you shall\ntear down their altars.' But you have not\nobeyed My voice. Why have you done\nthis?\nTherefore I also said, \"I will not drive\nthem out before you; but they shall be\nthorns in your side, and their gods shall\nbe a snare to you.\"'\nSo it was, when the Angel of the LORD\nspoke these words to all the children of\nIsrael, that the people lifted up their\nvoices and wept.\nThen they called the name of that place\nBochim; and they sacrificed there to the\nLORD.\nAnd when Joshua had dismissed the\npeople, the children of Israel went each\nto his own inheritance to possess the\nland.\nSo the people served the LORD all the\ndays of Joshua, and all the days of the\nelders who outlived Joshua, who had\nseen all the great works of the LORD\nwhich He had done for Israel.\nNow Joshua the son of Nun, the\nservant of the LORD, died when he was\none hundred and ten years old.\nAnd they buried him within the border\nof his inheritance at Timnath Heres, in\nthe mountains of Ephraim, on the north\nside of Mount Gaash.\nWhen all that generation had been\ngathered to their fathers, another\ngeneration arose after them who did not\nknow the LORD nor the work which He\nhad done for Israel.\nThen the children of Israel did evil in\nthe sight of the LORD, and served the\nBaals;\nand they forsook the LORD God of\ntheir fathers, who had brought them out\nof the land of Egypt; and they followed\nother gods from among the gods of the\npeople who were all around them, and\nthey bowed down to them; and they\nprovoked the LORD to anger.\nThey forsook the LORD and served\nBaal and the Ashtoreths.\nAnd the anger of the LORD was hot\nagainst Israel. So He delivered them\ninto the hands of plunderers who\ndespoiled them; and He sold them into\nthe hands of their enemies all around,\nso that they could no longer stand\nbefore their enemies.\nbehaved more corruptly than their\nfathers, by following other gods, to serve\nthem and bow down to them. They did\nnot cease from their own doings nor\nfrom their stubborn way.\nThen the anger of the LORD was hot\nagainst Israel; and He said, \"Because\nthis nation has transgressed My\ncovenant which I commanded their\nfathers, and has not heeded My voice,\nI also will no longer drive out before\nthem any of the nations which Joshua\nleft when he died,\nWherever they went out, the hand of\nthe LORD was against them for calamity,\nas the LORD had said, and as the\nLORD had sworn to them. And they\nwere greatly distressed.\nso that through them I may test Israel,\nwhether they will keep the ways of the\nLORD, to walk in them as their fathers\nkept them, or not.\"\nNevertheless, the LORD raised up\njudges who delivered them out of the\nhand of those who plundered them.\nTherefore the LORD left those nations,\nwithout driving them out immediately;\nnor did He deliver them into the hand of\nJoshua.\nYet they would not listen to their\njudges, but they played the harlot with\nother gods, and bowed down to them.\nThey turned quickly from the way in\nwhich their fathers walked, in obeying\nthe commandments of the LORD; they\ndid not do so.\nAnd when the LORD raised up judges\nfor them, the LORD was with the judge\nand delivered them out of the hand of\ntheir enemies all the days of the judge;\nfor the LORD was moved to pity by their\ngroaning because of those who\noppressed them and harassed them.\nAnd it came to pass, when the judge\nwas dead, that they reverted and\n3Now these are the nations which the\nLORD left, that He might test Israel by\nthem, that is, all who had not known any\nof the wars in Canaan\n(this was only so that the generations of\nthe children of Israel might be taught to\nknow war, at least those who had not\nformerly known it),\nnamely, five lords of the Philistines, all\nthe Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the\nHivites who dwelt in Mount Lebanon,\nfrom Mount Baal Hermon to the\nentrance of Hamath.\nAnd they were left, that He might test\nIsrael by them, to know whether they\nwould obey the commandments of the\nLORD, which He had commanded their\nfathers by the hand of Moses.\nAnd the children of Israel again did evil\nin the sight of the LORD. So the LORD\nstrengthened Eglon king of Moab\nagainst Israel, because they had done\nevil in the sight of the LORD.\nThus the children of Israel dwelt among\nthe Canaanites, the Hittites, the\nAmorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and\nthe Jebusites.\nThen he gathered to himself the\npeople of Ammon and Amalek, went\nand\ndefeated\nIsrael,\nand\ntook\npossession of the City of Palms.\nAnd they took their daughters to be\ntheir wives, and gave their daughters to\ntheir sons; and they served their gods.\nSo the children of Israel served Eglon\nking of Moab eighteen years.\nSo the children of Israel did evil in the\nsight of the LORD. They forgot the\nLORD their God, and served the Baals\nand Asherahs.\nBut when the children of Israel cried\nout to the LORD, the LORD raised up a\ndeliverer for them: Ehud the son of Gera,\nthe Benjamite, a left-handed man. By\nhim the children of Israel sent tribute to\nEglon king of Moab.\nTherefore the anger of the LORD was\nhot against Israel, and He sold them into\nthe hand of Cushan-Rishathaim king of\nMesopotamia; and the children of Israel\nserved Cushan-Rishathaim eight years.\nNow Ehud made himself a dagger (it\nwas double-edged and a cubit in length)\nand fastened it under his clothes on his\nright thigh.\nWhen the children of Israel cried out to\nthe LORD, the LORD raised up a\ndeliverer for the children of Israel, who\ndelivered them: Othniel the son of\nKenaz, Caleb's younger brother.\nThe Spirit of the LORD came upon him,\nand he judged Israel. He went out to war,\nand the LORD delivered CushanRishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his\nhand; and his hand prevailed over\nCushan-Rishathaim.\nSo the land had rest for forty years.\nThen Othniel the son of Kenaz died.\nSo he brought the tribute to Eglon king\nof Moab. (Now Eglon was a very fat\nman.)\nAnd when he had finished presenting\nthe tribute, he sent away the people who\nhad carried the tribute.\nBut he himself turned back from the\nstone images that were at Gilgal, and\nsaid, \"I have a secret message for you,\nO king.\" He said, \"Keep silence!\" And all\nwho attended him went out from him.\nSo Ehud came to him (now he was\nsitting upstairs in his cool private\nchamber). Then Ehud said, \"I have a\nmessage from God for you.\" So he\narose from his seat.\nwent down after him, seized the fords of\nthe Jordan leading to Moab, and did not\nallow anyone to cross over.\nThen Ehud reached with his left hand,\ntook the dagger from his right thigh, and\nthrust it into his belly.\nAnd at that time they killed about ten\nthousand men of Moab, all stout men of\nvalor; not a man escaped.\nEven the hilt went in after the blade,\nand the fat closed over the blade, for he\ndid not draw the dagger out of his belly;\nand his entrails came out.\nSo Moab was subdued that day under\nthe hand of Israel. And the land had rest\nfor eighty years.\nThen Ehud went out through the porch\nand shut the doors of the upper room\nbehind him and locked them.\nAfter him was Shamgar the son of\nAnath, who killed six hundred men of\nthe Philistines with an ox goad; and he\nalso delivered Israel.\nWhen he had gone out, Eglon's\nservants came to look, and to their\nsurprise, the doors of the upper room\nwere locked. So they said, \"He is\nprobably attending to his needs in the\ncool chamber.\"\nSo they waited till they were\nembarrassed, and still he had not\nopened the doors of the upper room.\nTherefore they took the key and opened\nthem. And there was their master, fallen\ndead on the floor.\nBut Ehud had escaped while they\ndelayed, and passed beyond the stone\nimages and escaped to Seirah.\nAnd it happened, when he arrived, that\nhe blew the trumpet in the mountains of\nEphraim, and the children of Israel went\ndown with him from the mountains; and\nhe led them.\nThen he said to them, \"Follow me, for\nthe LORD has delivered your enemies\nthe Moabites into your hand.\" So they\n4When Ehud was dead, the children of\nIsrael again did evil in the sight of the\nLORD.\nSo the LORD sold them into the hand\nof Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in\nHazor. The commander of his army was\nSisera, who dwelt in Harosheth\nHagoyim.\nAnd the children of Israel cried out to\nthe LORD; for Jabin had nine hundred\nchariots of iron, and for twenty years he\nhad harshly oppressed the children of\nIsrael.\nNow Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of\nLapidoth, was judging Israel at that time.\nAnd she would sit under the palm tree\nof Deborah between Ramah and Bethel\nin the mountains of Ephraim. And the\nchildren of Israel came up to her for\njudgment.\nThen she sent and called for Barak the\nson of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali,\nand said to him, \"Has not the LORD\nGod of Israel commanded, \"Go and\ndeploy troops at Mount Tabor; take with\nyou ten thousand men of the sons of\nNaphtali and of the sons of Zebulun;\nand against you I will deploy Sisera, the\ncommander of Jabin's army, with his\nchariots and his multitude at the River\nKishon; and I will deliver him into your\nhand'?\"\nAnd Barak said to her, \"If you will go\nwith me, then I will go; but if you will not\ngo with me, I will not go!\"\nand all the people who were with him,\nfrom Harosheth Hagoyim to the River\nKishon.\nThen Deborah said to Barak, \"Up! For\nthis is the day in which the LORD has\ndelivered Sisera into your hand. Has not\nthe LORD gone out before you?\" So\nBarak went down from Mount Tabor with\nten thousand men following him.\nAnd the LORD routed Sisera and all\nhis chariots and all his army with the\nedge of the sword before Barak; and\nSisera alighted from his chariot and fled\naway on foot.\nSo she said, \"I will surely go with you;\nnevertheless there will be no glory for\nyou in the journey you are taking, for the\nLORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a\nwoman.\" Then Deborah arose and went\nwith Barak to Kedesh.\nAnd Barak called Zebulun and\nNaphtali to Kedesh; he went up with ten\nthousand men under his command, and\nDeborah went up with him.\nNow Heber the Kenite, of the children\nof Hobab the father-in-law of Moses,\nhad separated himself from the Kenites\nand pitched his tent near the terebinth\ntree at Zaanaim, which is beside\nKedesh.\nAnd they reported to Sisera that Barak\nthe son of Abinoam had gone up to\nMount Tabor.\nSo Sisera gathered together all his\nchariots, nine hundred chariots of iron,\nBut Barak pursued the chariots and\nthe army as far as Harosheth Hagoyim,\nand all the army of Sisera fell by the\nedge of the sword; not a man was left.\nHowever, Sisera had fled away on foot\nto the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the\nKenite; for there was peace between\nJabin king of Hazor and the house of\nHeber the Kenite.\nAnd Jael went out to meet Sisera, and\nsaid to him, \"Turn aside, my lord, turn\naside to me; do not fear.\" And when he\nhad turned aside with her into the tent,\nshe covered him with a blanket.\nThen he said to her, \"Please give me a\nlittle water to drink, for I am thirsty.\" So\nshe opened a jug of milk, gave him a\ndrink, and covered him.\nAnd he said to her, \"Stand at the door\nof the tent, and if any man comes and\ninquires of you, and says, \"Is there any\nman here?' you shall say, \"No.\"'\nThen Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent\npeg and took a hammer in her hand,\nand went softly to him and drove the\npeg into his temple, and it went down\ninto the ground; for he was fast asleep\nand weary. So he died.\nAnd then, as Barak pursued Sisera,\nJael came out to meet him, and said to\nhim, \"Come, I will show you the man\nwhom you seek.\" And when he went into\nher tent, there lay Sisera, dead with the\npeg in his temple.\nThe mountains gushed before the\nLORD, This Sinai, before the LORD\nGod of Israel.\n\"In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath,\nIn the days of Jael, The highways were\ndeserted, And the travelers walked\nalong the byways.\nVillage life ceased, it ceased in Israel,\nUntil I, Deborah, arose, Arose a mother\nin Israel.\nSo on that day God subdued Jabin\nking of Canaan in the presence of the\nchildren of Israel.\nThey chose new gods; Then there was\nwar in the gates; Not a shield or spear\nwas seen among forty thousand in Israel.\nAnd the hand of the children of Israel\ngrew stronger and stronger against\nJabin king of Canaan, until they had\ndestroyed Jabin king of Canaan.\n5Then Deborah and Barak the son of\nAbinoam sang on that day, saying:\n\"When leaders lead in Israel, When the\npeople willingly offer themselves, Bless\nthe LORD!\nMy heart is with the rulers of Israel Who\noffered themselves willingly with the\npeople. Bless the LORD!\n\"Speak, you who ride on white\ndonkeys, Who sit in judges' attire, And\nwho walk along the road.\nFar from the noise of the archers,\namong the watering places, There they\nshall recount the righteous acts of the\nLORD, The righteous acts for His\nvillagers in Israel; Then the people of\nthe LORD shall go down to the gates.\n\"Hear, O kings!

After you, Benjamin,\nwith your peoples, From Machir rulers\ncame down, And from Zebulun those\nwho bear the recruiter's staff.\nBecause they did not come to the help\nof the LORD, To the help of the LORD\nagainst the mighty.'\nAnd the princes of Issachar were with\nDeborah; As Issachar, so was Barak\nSent into the valley under his command;\nAmong the divisions of Reuben There\nwere great resolves of heart.\nWhy did you sit among the sheepfolds,\nTo hear the pipings for the flocks? The\ndivisions of Reuben have great\nsearchings of heart.\nGilead stayed beyond the Jordan, And\nwhy did Dan remain on ships?

O my soul, march on in\nstrength!\n\"Most blessed among women is Jael,\nThe wife of Heber the Kenite; Blessed is\nshe among women in tents.\nHe asked for water, she gave milk;\nShe brought out cream in a lordly bowl.\nShe stretched her hand to the tent peg,\nHer right hand to the workmen's\nhammer; She pounded Sisera, she\npierced his head, She split and struck\nthrough his temple.\nAt her feet he sank, he fell, he lay still;\nAt her feet he sank, he fell; Where he\nsank, there he fell dead.\n\"The mother of Sisera looked through\nthe window, And cried out through the\nlattice, \"Why is his chariot so long in\ncoming? Why tarries the clatter of his\nchariots?'\nHer wisest ladies answered her, Yes,\nshe answered herself,\n\"Are they not finding and dividing the\nspoil: To every man a girl or two; For\nSisera, plunder of dyed garments,\nPlunder of garments embroidered and\ndyed, Two pieces of dyed embroidery\nfor the neck of the looter?'\nThen the horses' hooves pounded,\nThe galloping, galloping of his steeds.\n\"Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the\nLORD, \"Curse its inhabitants bitterly,\n\"Thus let all Your enemies perish, O\nLORD! But let those who love Him be\nlike the sun When it comes out in full\nstrength.\" So the land had rest for forty\nyears.\n6Then the children of Israel did evil in\nthe sight of the LORD. So the LORD\ndelivered them into the hand of Midian\nfor seven years,\nand the hand of Midian prevailed\nagainst Israel. Because of the Midianites,\nthe children of Israel made for\nthemselves the dens, the caves, and the\nstrongholds which are in the mountains.\nSo it was, whenever Israel had sown,\nMidianites would come up; also\nAmalekites and the people of the East\nwould come up against them.\nThen they would encamp against them\nand destroy the produce of the earth as\nfar as Gaza, and leave no sustenance\nfor Israel, neither sheep nor ox nor\ndonkey.\nFor they would come up with their\nlivestock and their tents, coming in as\nnumerous as locusts; both they and\ntheir camels were without number; and\nthey would enter the land to destroy it.\nSo Israel was greatly impoverished\nbecause of the Midianites, and the\nchildren of Israel cried out to the LORD.\nAnd it came to pass, when the children\nof Israel cried out to the LORD because\nof the Midianites,\nthat the LORD sent a prophet to the\nchildren of Israel, who said to them,\n\"Thus says the LORD God of Israel: \"I\nbrought you up from Egypt and brought\nyou out of the house of bondage;\nand I delivered you out of the hand of\nthe Egyptians and out of the hand of all\nwho oppressed you, and drove them out\nbefore you and gave you their land.\nAlso I said to you, \"I am the LORD\nyour God; do not fear the gods of the\nAmorites, in whose land you dwell.\" But\nyou have not obeyed My voice.\"'\nNow the Angel of the LORD came and\nsat under the terebinth tree which was in\nOphrah, which belonged to Joash the\nAbiezrite, while his son Gideon threshed\nwheat in the winepress, in order to hide\nit from the Midianites.\nAnd the Angel of the LORD appeared\nto him, and said to him, \"The LORD is\nwith you, you mighty man of valor!\"\nGideon said to Him, \"O my lord, if the\nLORD is with us, why then has all this\nhappened to us? And where are all His\nmiracles which our fathers told us about,\nsaying, \"Did not the LORD bring us up\nfrom Egypt?' But now the LORD has\nforsaken us and delivered us into the\nhands of the Midianites.\"\nThen the LORD turned to him and said,\n\"Go in this might of yours, and you shall\nsave Israel from the hand of the\nMidianites. Have I not sent you?\"\nSo he said to Him, \"O my Lord, how\ncan I save Israel? Indeed my clan is the\nweakest in Manasseh, and I am the\nleast in my father's house.\"\nAnd the LORD said to him, \"Surely I\nwill be with you, and you shall defeat the\nMidianites as one man.\"\nThen he said to Him, \"If now I have\nfound favor in Your sight, then show me\na sign that it is You who talk with me.\nDo not depart from here, I pray, until I\ncome to You and bring out my offering\nand set it before You.\" And He said, \"I\nwill wait until you come back.\"\nSo Gideon went in and prepared a\nyoung goat, and unleavened bread from\nan ephah of flour. The meat he put in a\nbasket, and he put the broth in a pot;\nand he brought them out to Him under\nthe terebinth tree and presented them.\nNow it came to pass the same night\nthat the LORD said to him, \"Take your\nfather's young bull, the second bull of\nseven years old, and tear down the altar\nof Baal that your father has, and cut\ndown the wooden image that is beside\nit;\nand build an altar to the LORD your\nGod on top of this rock in the proper\narrangement, and take the second bull\nand offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood\nof the image which you shall cut down.\"\nThe Angel of God said to him, \"Take\nthe meat and the unleavened bread and\nlay them on this rock, and pour out the\nbroth.\" And he did so.\nSo Gideon took ten men from among\nhis servants and did as the LORD had\nsaid to him. But because he feared his\nfather's household and the men of the\ncity too much to do it by day, he did it by\nnight.\nThen the Angel of the LORD put out\nthe end of the staff that was in His hand,\nand touched the meat and the\nunleavened bread; and fire rose out of\nthe rock and consumed the meat and\nthe unleavened bread. And the Angel of\nthe LORD departed out of his sight.\nNow Gideon perceived that He was\nthe Angel of the LORD. So Gideon said,\n\"Alas, O Lord GOD! For I have seen the\nAngel of the LORD face to face.\"\nThen the LORD said to him, \"Peace be\nwith you; do not fear, you shall not die.\"\nSo Gideon built an altar there to the\nLORD, and called it The-LORD-IsPeace. To this day it is still in Ophrah of\nthe Abiezrites.\nAnd when the men of the city arose\nearly in the morning, there was the altar\nof Baal, torn down; and the wooden\nimage that was beside it was cut down,\nand the second bull was being offered\non the altar which had been built.\nSo they said to one another, \"Who has\ndone this thing?\" And when they had\ninquired and asked, they said, \"Gideon\nthe son of Joash has done this thing.\"\nThen the men of the city said to Joash,\n\"Bring out your son, that he may die,\nbecause he has torn down the altar of\nBaal, and because he has cut down the\nwooden image that was beside it.\"\nBut Joash said to all who stood\nagainst him, \"Would you plead for Baal?\nWould you save him? Let the one who\nwould plead for him be put to death by\nmorning! If he is a god, let him plead for\nhimself, because his altar has been torn\ndown!\"\nonly on the fleece, but on all the ground\nlet there be dew.\"\nTherefore on that day he called him\nJerubbaal, saying, \"Let Baal plead\nagainst him, because he has torn down\nhis altar.\"\nThen all the Midianites and Amalekites,\nthe people of the East, gathered\ntogether; and they crossed over and\nencamped in the Valley of Jezreel.\nBut the Spirit of the LORD came upon\nGideon; then he blew the trumpet, and\nthe Abiezrites gathered behind him.\nAnd he sent messengers throughout\nall Manasseh, who also gathered behind\nhim. He also sent messengers to Asher,\nZebulun, and Naphtali; and they came\nup to meet them.\nAnd God did so that night. It was dry\non the fleece only, but there was dew on\nall the ground.\n7Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and\nall the people who were with him rose\nearly and encamped beside the well of\nHarod, so that the camp of the\nMidianites was on the north side of them\nby the hill of Moreh in the valley.\nAnd the LORD said to Gideon, \"The\npeople who are with you are too many\nfor Me to give the Midianites into their\nhands, lest Israel claim glory for itself\nagainst Me, saying, \"My own hand has\nsaved me.'\nSo Gideon said to God, \"If You will\nsave Israel by my hand as You have\nsaid-37\nlook, I shall put a fleece of wool on the\nthreshing floor; if there is dew on the\nfleece only, and it is dry on all the\nground, then I shall know that You will\nsave Israel by my hand, as You have\nsaid.\"\nNow therefore, proclaim in the hearing\nof the people, saying, \"Whoever is\nfearful and afraid, let him turn and\ndepart at once from Mount Gilead.\"' And\ntwenty-two thousand of the people\nreturned, and ten thousand remained.\nAnd it was so. When he rose early the\nnext morning and squeezed the fleece\ntogether, he wrung the dew out of the\nfleece, a bowlful of water.\nBut the LORD said to Gideon, \"The\npeople are still too many; bring them\ndown to the water, and I will test them\nfor you there. Then it will be, that of\nwhom I say to you, \"This one shall go\nwith you,' the same shall go with you;\nand of whomever I say to you, \"This one\nshall not go with you,' the same shall not\ngo.\"\nThen Gideon said to God, \"Do not be\nangry with me, but let me speak just\nonce more: Let me test, I pray, just once\nmore with the fleece; let it now be dry\nSo he brought the people down to the\nwater. And the LORD said to Gideon,\n\"Everyone who laps from the water with\nhis tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set\napart by himself; likewise everyone who\ngets down on his knees to drink.\"\nAnd the number of those who lapped,\nputting their hand to their mouth, was\nthree hundred men; but all the rest of\nthe people got down on their knees to\ndrink water.\nAnd when Gideon had come, there\nwas a man telling a dream to his\ncompanion. He said, \"I have had a\ndream: To my surprise, a loaf of barley\nbread tumbled into the camp of Midian;\nit came to a tent and struck it so that it\nfell and overturned, and the tent\ncollapsed.\"\nThen the LORD said to Gideon, \"By the\nthree hundred men who lapped I will\nsave you, and deliver the Midianites into\nyour hand. Let all the other people go,\nevery man to his place.\"\nThen his companion answered and\nsaid, \"This is nothing else but the sword\nof Gideon the son of Joash, a man of\nIsrael! Into his hand God has delivered\nMidian and the whole camp.\"\nSo the people took provisions and their\ntrumpets in their hands. And he sent\naway all the rest of Israel, every man to\nhis tent, and retained those three\nhundred men. Now the camp of Midian\nwas below him in the valley.\nAnd so it was, when Gideon heard the\ntelling of the dream and its interpretation,\nthat he worshiped. He returned to the\ncamp of Israel, and said, \"Arise, for the\nLORD has delivered the camp of Midian\ninto your hand.\"\nIt happened on the same night that the\nLORD said to him, \"Arise, go down\nagainst the camp, for I have delivered it\ninto your hand.\nThen he divided the three hundred\nmen into three companies, and he put a\ntrumpet into every man's hand, with\nempty pitchers, and torches inside the\npitchers.\nBut if you are afraid to go down, go\ndown to the camp with Purah your\nservant,\nand you shall hear what they say; and\nafterward your hands shall be\nstrengthened to go down against the\ncamp.\" Then he went down with Purah\nhis servant to the outpost of the armed\nmen who were in the camp.\nAnd he said to them, \"Look at me and\ndo likewise; watch, and when I come to\nthe edge of the camp you shall do as I\ndo:\nWhen I blow the trumpet, I and all who\nare with me, then you also blow the\ntrumpets on every side of the whole\ncamp, and say, \"The sword of the LORD\nand of Gideon!\"'\nNow the Midianites and Amalekites, all\nthe people of the East, were lying in the\nvalley as numerous as locusts; and their\ncamels were without number, as the\nsand by the seashore in multitude.\nSo Gideon and the hundred men who\nwere with him came to the outpost of the\ncamp at the beginning of the middle\nwatch, just as they had posted the\nwatch; and they blew the trumpets and\nbroke the pitchers that were in their\nhands.\nThen the three companies blew the\ntrumpets and broke the pitchers--they\nheld the torches in their left hands and\nthe trumpets in their right hands for\nblowing--and they cried, \"The sword of\nthe LORD and of Gideon!\"\nAnd every man stood in his place all\naround the camp; and the whole army\nran and cried out and fled.\nWhen the three hundred blew the\ntrumpets, the LORD set every man's\nsword against his companion throughout\nthe whole camp; and the army fled to\nBeth Acacia, toward Zererah, as far as\nthe border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.\nAnd the men of Israel gathered\ntogether from Naphtali, Asher, and all\nManasseh, and pursued the Midianites.\nThen Gideon sent messengers\nthroughout all the mountains of Ephraim,\nsaying, \"Come down against the\nMidianites, and seize from them the\nwatering places as far as Beth Barah\nand the Jordan.\" Then all the men of\nEphraim gathered together and seized\nthe watering places as far as Beth\nBarah and the Jordan.\nAnd they captured two princes of the\nMidianites, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed\nOreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they\nkilled at the winepress of Zeeb. They\npursued Midian and brought the heads\nof Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the\nother side of the Jordan.\n8Now the men of Ephraim said to him,\n\"Why have you done this to us by not\ncalling us when you went to fight with\nthe Midianites?\" And they reprimanded\nhim sharply.\nSo he said to them, \"What have I done\nnow in comparison with you? Is not the\ngleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better\nthan the vintage of Abiezer?\nGod has delivered into your hands the\nprinces of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And\nwhat was I able to do in comparison with\nyou?\" Then their anger toward him\nsubsided when he said that.\nWhen Gideon came to the Jordan, he\nand the three hundred men who were\nwith him crossed over, exhausted but\nstill in pursuit.\nThen he said to the men of Succoth,\n\"Please give loaves of bread to the\npeople who follow me, for they are\nexhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah\nand Zalmunna, kings of Midian.\"\nAnd the leaders of Succoth said, \"Are\nthe hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now\nin your hand, that we should give bread\nto your army?\"\nSo Gideon said, \"For this cause, when\nthe LORD has delivered Zebah and\nZalmunna into my hand, then I will tear\nyour flesh with the thorns of the\nwilderness and with briers!\"\nThen he went up from there to Penuel\nand spoke to them in the same way.\nAnd the men of Penuel answered him\nas the men of Succoth had answered.\nAnd he took the elders of the city, and\nthorns of the wilderness and briers, and\nwith them he taught the men of Succoth.\nSo he also spoke to the men of Penuel,\nsaying, \"When I come back in peace, I\nwill tear down this tower!\"\nThen he tore down the tower of Penuel\nand killed the men of the city.\nNow Zebah and Zalmunna were at\nKarkor, and their armies with them,\nabout fifteen thousand, all who were left\nof all the army of the people of the East;\nfor one hundred and twenty thousand\nmen who drew the sword had fallen.\nAnd he said to Zebah and Zalmunna,\n\"What kind of men were they whom you\nkilled at Tabor?\" So they answered, \"As\nyou are, so were they; each one\nresembled the son of a king.\"\nThen Gideon went up by the road of\nthose who dwell in tents on the east of\nNobah and Jogbehah; and he attacked\nthe army while the camp felt secure.\nThen he said, \"They were my brothers,\nthe sons of my mother. As the LORD\nlives, if you had let them live, I would not\nkill you.\"\nWhen Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he\npursued them; and he took the two\nkings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna,\nand routed the whole army.\nAnd he said to Jether his firstborn,\n\"Rise, kill them!\" But the youth would not\ndraw his sword; for he was afraid,\nbecause he was still a youth.\nThen Gideon the son of Joash\nreturned from battle, from the Ascent of\nHeres.\nAnd he caught a young man of the\nmen of Succoth and interrogated him;\nand he wrote down for him the leaders\nof Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven\nmen.\nSo Zebah and Zalmunna said, \"Rise\nyourself, and kill us; for as a man is, so\nis his strength.\" So Gideon arose and\nkilled Zebah and Zalmunna, and took\nthe crescent ornaments that were on\ntheir camels' necks.\nThen the men of Israel said to Gideon,\n\"Rule over us, both you and your son,\nand your grandson also; for you have\ndelivered us from the hand of Midian.\"\nThen he came to the men of Succoth\nand said, \"Here are Zebah and\nZalmunna, about whom you ridiculed\nme, saying, \"Are the hands of Zebah\nand Zalmunna now in your hand, that\nwe should give bread to your weary\nmen?\"'\nBut Gideon said to them, \"I will not rule\nover you, nor shall my son rule over\nyou; the LORD shall rule over you.\"\nThen Gideon said to them, \"I would\nlike to make a request of you, that each\nof you would give me the earrings from\nhis plunder.\" For they had golden\nearrings, because they were Ishmaelites.\nSo they answered, \"We will gladly give\nthem.\" And they spread out a garment,\nand each man threw into it the earrings\nfrom his plunder.\nNow the weight of the gold earrings\nthat he requested was one thousand\nseven hundred shekels of gold, besides\nthe crescent ornaments, pendants, and\npurple robes which were on the kings of\nMidian, and besides the chains that\nwere around their camels' necks.\nThen Gideon made it into an ephod\nand set it up in his city, Ophrah. And all\nIsrael played the harlot with it there. It\nbecame a snare to Gideon and to his\nhouse.\nThus Midian was subdued before the\nchildren of Israel, so that they lifted their\nheads no more. And the country was\nquiet for forty years in the days of\nGideon.\nThen Jerubbaal the son of Joash went\nand dwelt in his own house.\nGideon had seventy sons who were\nhis own offspring, for he had many\nwives.\nAnd his concubine who was in\nShechem also bore him a son, whose\nname he called Abimelech.\nNow Gideon the son of Joash died at a\ngood old age, and was buried in the\ntomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of\nthe Abiezrites.\nSo it was, as soon as Gideon was\ndead, that the children of Israel again\nplayed the harlot with the Baals, and\nmade Baal-Berith their god.\nThus the children of Israel did not\nremember the LORD their God, who\nhad delivered them from the hands of all\ntheir enemies on every side;\nnor did they show kindness to the\nhouse of Jerubbaal (Gideon) in\naccordance with the good he had done\nfor Israel.\n9Then Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal\nwent to Shechem, to his mother's\nbrothers, and spoke with them and with\nall the family of the house of his\nmother's father, saying,\n\"Please speak in the hearing of all the\nmen of Shechem: \"Which is better for\nyou, that all seventy of the sons of\nJerubbaal reign over you, or that one\nreign over you?' Remember that I am\nyour own flesh and bone.\"\nAnd his mother's brothers spoke all\nthese words concerning him in the\nhearing of all the men of Shechem; and\ntheir heart was inclined to follow\nAbimelech, for they said, \"He is our\nbrother.\"\nSo they gave him seventy shekels of\nsilver from the temple of Baal-Berith,\nwith which Abimelech hired worthless\nand reckless men; and they followed\nhim.\nThen he went to his father's house at\nOphrah and killed his brothers, the\nseventy sons of Jerubbaal, on one stone.\nBut Jotham the youngest son of\nJerubbaal was left, because he hid\nhimself.\nAnd all the men of Shechem gathered\ntogether, all of Beth Millo, and they went\nand made Abimelech king beside the\nterebinth tree at the pillar that was in\nShechem.\nNow when they told Jotham, he went\nand stood on top of Mount Gerizim, and\nlifted his voice and cried out. And he\nsaid to them: \"Listen to me, you men of\nShechem, That God may listen to you!\n\"The trees once went forth to anoint a\nking over them. And they said to the\nolive tree, \"Reign over us!'\nBut the olive tree said to them, \"Should\nI cease giving my oil, With which they\nhonor God and men, And go to sway\nover trees?'\n\"Then all the trees said to the bramble,\n\"You come and reign over us!'\nAnd the bramble said to the trees, \"If in\ntruth you anoint me as king over you,\nThen come and take shelter in my\nshade; But if not, let fire come out of the\nbramble And devour the cedars of\nLebanon!'\n\"Now therefore, if you have acted in\ntruth and sincerity in making Abimelech\nking, and if you have dealt well with\nJerubbaal and his house, and have\ndone to him as he deserves-17\nfor my father fought for you, risked his\nlife, and delivered you out of the hand of\nMidian;\nbut you have risen up against my\nfather's house this day, and killed his\nseventy sons on one stone, and made\nAbimelech, the son of his female\nservant, king over the men of Shechem,\nbecause he is your brother-19\n\"Then the trees said to the fig tree,\n\"You come and reign over us!'\nBut the fig tree said to them, \"Should I\ncease my sweetness and my good fruit,\nAnd go to sway over trees?'\n\"Then the trees said to the vine, \"You\ncome and reign over us!'\nif then you have acted in truth and\nsincerity with Jerubbaal and with his\nhouse this day, then rejoice in\nAbimelech, and let him also rejoice in\nyou.\nBut if not, let fire come from Abimelech\nand devour the men of Shechem and\nBeth Millo; and let fire come from the\nmen of Shechem and from Beth Millo\nand devour Abimelech!\"\nBut the vine said to them, \"Should I\ncease my new wine, Which cheers both\nGod and men, And go to sway over\ntrees?'\nAnd Jotham ran away and fled; and he\nwent to Beer and dwelt there, for fear of\nAbimelech his brother.\nAfter Abimelech had reigned over\nIsrael three years,\nAbimelech.\" So he said to Abimelech,\n\"Increase your army and come out!\"\nGod sent a spirit of ill will between\nAbimelech and the men of Shechem;\nand the men of Shechem dealt\ntreacherously with Abimelech,\nWhen Zebul, the ruler of the city,\nheard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed,\nhis anger was aroused.\nthat the crime done to the seventy\nsons of Jerubbaal might be settled and\ntheir blood be laid on Abimelech their\nbrother, who killed them, and on the\nmen of Shechem, who aided him in the\nkilling of his brothers.\nAnd the men of Shechem set men in\nambush against him on the tops of the\nmountains, and they robbed all who\npassed by them along that way; and it\nwas told Abimelech.\nNow Gaal the son of Ebed came with\nhis brothers and went over to Shechem;\nand the men of Shechem put their\nconfidence in him.\nSo they went out into the fields, and\ngathered grapes from their vineyards\nand trod them, and made merry. And\nthey went into the house of their god,\nand ate and drank, and cursed\nAbimelech.\nThen Gaal the son of Ebed said, \"Who\nis Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that\nwe should serve him? Is he not the son\nof Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his\nofficer? Serve the men of Hamor the\nfather of Shechem; but why should we\nserve him?\nAnd he sent messengers to Abimelech\nsecretly, saying, \"Take note! Gaal the\nson of Ebed and his brothers have come\nto Shechem; and here they are,\nfortifying the city against you.\nNow therefore, get up by night, you\nand the people who are with you, and lie\nin wait in the field.\nAnd it shall be, as soon as the sun is\nup in the morning, that you shall rise\nearly and rush upon the city; and when\nhe and the people who are with him\ncome out against you, you may then do\nto them as you find opportunity.\"\nSo Abimelech and all the people who\nwere with him rose by night, and lay in\nwait against Shechem in four companies.\nWhen Gaal the son of Ebed went out\nand stood in the entrance to the city\ngate, Abimelech and the people who\nwere with him rose from lying in wait.\nAnd when Gaal saw the people, he\nsaid to Zebul, \"Look, people are coming\ndown from the tops of the mountains!\"\nBut Zebul said to him, \"You see the\nshadows of the mountains as if they\nwere men.\"\nIf only this people were under my\nauthority! Then I would remove\nSo Gaal spoke again and said, \"See,\npeople are coming down from the center\nof the land, and another company is\ncoming from the Diviners' Terebinth\nTree.\"\nThen Zebul said to him, \"Where\nindeed is your mouth now, with which\nyou said, \"Who is Abimelech, that we\nshould serve him?' Are not these the\npeople whom you despised? Go out, if\nyou will, and fight with them now.\"\nNow when all the men of the tower of\nShechem had heard that, they entered\nthe stronghold of the temple of the god\nBerith.\nAnd it was told Abimelech that all the\nmen of the tower of Shechem were\ngathered together.\nSo Gaal went out, leading the men of\nShechem, and fought with Abimelech.\nAnd Abimelech chased him, and he\nfled from him; and many fell wounded,\nto the very entrance of the gate.\nThen Abimelech dwelt at Arumah, and\nZebul drove out Gaal and his brothers,\nso that they would not dwell in Shechem.\nAnd it came about on the next day that\nthe people went out into the field, and\nthey told Abimelech.\nSo he took his people, divided them\ninto three companies, and lay in wait in\nthe field. And he looked, and there were\nthe people, coming out of the city; and\nhe rose against them and attacked them.\nThen Abimelech and the company that\nwas with him rushed forward and stood\nat the entrance of the gate of the city;\nand the other two companies rushed\nupon all who were in the fields and killed\nthem.\nSo Abimelech fought against the city\nall that day; he took the city and killed\nthe people who were in it; and he\ndemolished the city and sowed it with\nsalt.\nThen Abimelech went up to Mount\nZalmon, he and all the people who were\nwith him. And Abimelech took an ax in\nhis hand and cut down a bough from the\ntrees, and took it and laid it on his\nshoulder; then he said to the people\nwho were with him, \"What you have\nseen me do, make haste and do as I\nhave done.\"\nSo each of the people likewise cut\ndown his own bough and followed\nAbimelech, put them against the\nstronghold, and set the stronghold on\nfire above them, so that all the people of\nthe tower of Shechem died, about a\nthousand men and women.\nThen Abimelech went to Thebez, and\nhe encamped against Thebez and took\nit.\nBut there was a strong tower in the city,\nand all the men and women--all the\npeople of the city--fled there and shut\nthemselves in; then they went up to the\ntop of the tower.\nSo Abimelech came as far as the\ntower and fought against it; and he drew\nnear the door of the tower to burn it with\nfire.\nBut a certain woman dropped an\nupper millstone on Abimelech's head\nand crushed his skull.\nThen he called quickly to the young\nman, his armorbearer, and said to him,\n\"Draw your sword and kill me, lest men\nsay of me, \"A woman killed him.\"' So his\nyoung man thrust him through, and he\ndied.\nAnd when the men of Israel saw that\nAbimelech was dead, they departed,\nevery man to his place.\nThus God repaid the wickedness of\nAbimelech, which he had done to his\nfather by killing his seventy brothers.\nAnd all the evil of the men of Shechem\nGod returned on their own heads, and\non them came the curse of Jotham the\nson of Jerubbaal.\n10After Abimelech there arose to\nsave Israel Tola the son of Puah, the\nson of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he\ndwelt in Shamir in the mountains of\nEphraim.\nHe judged Israel twenty-three years;\nand he died and was buried in Shamir.\nAfter him arose Jair, a Gileadite; and he\njudged Israel twenty-two years.\nNow he had thirty sons who rode on\nthirty donkeys; they also had thirty\ntowns, which are called \"Havoth Jair\" to\nthis day, which are in the land of Gilead.\nAnd Jair died and was buried in Camon.\nThen the children of Israel again did\nevil in the sight of the LORD, and served\nthe Baals and the Ashtoreths, the gods\nof Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of\nMoab, the gods of the people of Ammon,\nand the gods of the Philistines; and they\nforsook the LORD and did not serve\nHim.\nSo the anger of the LORD was hot\nagainst Israel; and He sold them into the\nhands of the Philistines and into the\nhands of the people of Ammon.\nFrom that year they harassed and\noppressed the children of Israel for\neighteen years--all the children of Israel\nwho were on the other side of the\nJordan in the land of the Amorites, in\nGilead.\nMoreover the people of Ammon\ncrossed over the Jordan to fight against\nJudah also, against Benjamin, and\nagainst the house of Ephraim, so that\nIsrael was severely distressed.\nAnd the children of Israel cried out to\nthe LORD, saying, \"We have sinned\nagainst You, because we have both\nforsaken our God and served the\nBaals!\"\nSo the LORD said to the children of\nIsrael, \"Did I not deliver you from the\nEgyptians and from the Amorites and\nfrom the people of Ammon and from the\nPhilistines?\nAlso the Sidonians and Amalekites\nand Maonites oppressed you; and you\ncried out to Me, and I delivered you from\ntheir hand.\nYet you have forsaken Me and served\nother gods. Therefore I will deliver you\nno more.\nworthless men banded together with\nJephthah and went out raiding with him.\nGo and cry out to the gods which you\nhave chosen; let them deliver you in\nyour time of distress.\"\nIt came to pass after a time that the\npeople of Ammon made war against\nIsrael.\nAnd the children of Israel said to the\nLORD, \"We have sinned! Do to us\nwhatever seems best to You; only\ndeliver us this day, we pray.\"\nAnd so it was, when the people of\nAmmon made war against Israel, that\nthe elders of Gilead went to get\nJephthah from the land of Tob.\nSo they put away the foreign gods\nfrom among them and served the LORD.\nAnd His soul could no longer endure the\nmisery of Israel.\nThen the people of Ammon gathered\ntogether and encamped in Gilead. And\nthe children of Israel assembled\ntogether and encamped in Mizpah.\nThen they said to Jephthah, \"Come and\nbe our commander, that we may fight\nagainst the people of Ammon.\"\nSo Jephthah said to the elders of\nGilead, \"Did you not hate me, and expel\nme from my father's house? Why have\nyou come to me now when you are in\ndistress?\"\nAnd the people, the leaders of Gilead,\nsaid to one another, \"Who is the man\nwho will begin the fight against the\npeople of Ammon? He shall be head\nover all the inhabitants of Gilead.\"\n11Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a\nmighty man of valor, but he was the son\nof a harlot; and Gilead begot Jephthah.\nGilead's wife bore sons; and when his\nwife's sons grew up, they drove\nJephthah out, and said to him, \"You\nshall have no inheritance in our father's\nhouse, for you are the son of another\nwoman.\"\nThen Jephthah fled from his brothers\nand dwelt in the land of Tob; and\nAnd the elders of Gilead said to\nJephthah, \"That is why we have turned\nagain to you now, that you may go with\nus and fight against the people of\nAmmon, and be our head over all the\ninhabitants of Gilead.\"\nSo Jephthah said to the elders of\nGilead, \"If you take me back home to\nfight against the people of Ammon, and\nthe LORD delivers them to me, shall I\nbe your head?\"\nAnd the elders of Gilead said to\nJephthah, \"The LORD will be a witness\nbetween us, if we do not do according to\nyour words.\"\nThen Jephthah went with the elders of\nGilead, and the people made him head\nand commander over them; and\nJephthah spoke all his words before the\nLORD in Mizpah.\nof Moab, for the Arnon was the border of\nMoab.\nNow Jephthah sent messengers to the\nking of the people of Ammon, saying,\n\"What do you have against me, that you\nhave come to fight against me in my\nland?\"\nThen Israel sent messengers to Sihon\nking of the Amorites, king of Heshbon;\nand Israel said to him, \"Please let us\npass through your land into our place.\"\nAnd the king of the people of Ammon\nanswered the messengers of Jephthah,\n\"Because Israel took away my land\nwhen they came up out of Egypt, from\nthe Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and to\nthe Jordan. Now therefore, restore those\nlands peaceably.\"\nBut Sihon did not trust Israel to pass\nthrough his territory. So Sihon gathered\nall his people together, encamped in\nJahaz, and fought against Israel.\nSo Jephthah again sent messengers\nto the king of the people of Ammon,\nAnd the LORD God of Israel delivered\nSihon and all his people into the hand of\nIsrael, and they defeated them. Thus\nIsrael gained possession of all the land\nof the Amorites, who inhabited that\ncountry.\nand said to him, \"Thus says Jephthah:\n\"Israel did not take away the land of\nMoab, nor the land of the people of\nAmmon;\nThey took possession of all the\nterritory of the Amorites, from the Arnon\nto the Jabbok and from the wilderness\nto the Jordan.\nfor when Israel came up from Egypt,\nthey walked through the wilderness as\nfar as the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.\n\"And now the LORD God of Israel has\ndispossessed the Amorites from before\nHis people Israel; should you then\npossess it?\nThen Israel sent messengers to the\nking of Edom, saying, \"Please let me\npass through your land.\" But the king of\nEdom would not heed. And in like\nmanner they sent to the king of Moab,\nbut he would not consent. So Israel\nremained in Kadesh.\nWill you not possess whatever\nChemosh your god gives you to\npossess? So whatever the LORD our\nGod takes possession of before us, we\nwill possess.\nAnd they went along through the\nwilderness and bypassed the land of\nEdom and the land of Moab, came to\nthe east side of the land of Moab, and\nencamped on the other side of the\nArnon. But they did not enter the border\nAnd now, are you any better than\nBalak the son of Zippor, king of Moab?\nDid he ever strive against Israel? Did he\never fight against them?\nWhile Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its\nvillages, in Aroer and its villages, and in\nall the cities along the banks of the\nArnon, for three hundred years, why did\nyou not recover them within that time?\nTherefore I have not sinned against\nyou, but you wronged me by fighting\nagainst me. May the LORD, the Judge,\nrender judgment this day between the\nchildren of Israel and the people of\nAmmon.\"'\nHowever, the king of the people of\nAmmon did not heed the words which\nJephthah sent him.\nThen the Spirit of the LORD came\nupon Jephthah, and he passed through\nGilead and Manasseh, and passed\nthrough Mizpah of Gilead; and from\nMizpah of Gilead he advanced toward\nthe people of Ammon.\nWhen Jephthah came to his house at\nMizpah, there was his daughter, coming\nout to meet him with timbrels and\ndancing; and she was his only child.\nBesides her he had neither son nor\ndaughter.\nAnd it came to pass, when he saw her,\nthat he tore his clothes, and said, \"Alas,\nmy daughter! You have brought me very\nlow! You are among those who trouble\nme! For I have given my word to the\nLORD, and I cannot go back on it.\"\nSo she said to him, \"My father, if you\nhave given your word to the LORD, do\nto me according to what has gone out of\nyour mouth, because the LORD has\navenged you of your enemies, the\npeople of Ammon.\"\nAnd Jephthah made a vow to the\nLORD, and said, \"If You will indeed\ndeliver the people of Ammon into my\nhands,\nThen she said to her father, \"Let this\nthing be done for me: let me alone for\ntwo months, that I may go and wander\non the mountains and bewail my\nvirginity, my friends and I.\"\nthen it will be that whatever comes out\nof the doors of my house to meet me,\nwhen I return in peace from the people\nof Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's,\nand I will offer it up as a burnt offering.\"\nSo he said, \"Go.\" And he sent her\naway for two months; and she went with\nher friends, and bewailed her virginity on\nthe mountains.\nSo Jephthah advanced toward the\npeople of Ammon to fight against them,\nand the LORD delivered them into his\nhands.\nAnd it was so at the end of two months\nthat she returned to her father, and he\ncarried out his vow with her which he\nhad vowed. She knew no man. And it\nbecame a custom in Israel\nAnd he defeated them from Aroer as\nfar as Minnith--twenty cities--and to Abel\nKeramim, with a very great slaughter.\nThus the people of Ammon were\nsubdued before the children of Israel.\nthat the daughters of Israel went four\ndays each year to lament the daughter\nof Jephthah the Gileadite.\n12Then the men of Ephraim\ngathered together, crossed over toward\nZaphon, and said to Jephthah, \"Why did\nyou cross over to fight against the\npeople of Ammon, and did not call us to\ngo with you? We will burn your house\ndown on you with fire!\"\nfell at that time forty-two thousand\nEphraimites.\nAnd Jephthah judged Israel six years.\nThen Jephthah the Gileadite died and\nwas buried among the cities of Gilead.\nAfter him, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged\nIsrael.\nAnd Jephthah said to them, \"My people\nand I were in a great struggle with the\npeople of Ammon; and when I called\nyou, you did not deliver me out of their\nhands.\nHe had thirty sons. And he gave away\nthirty daughters in marriage, and\nbrought in thirty daughters from\nelsewhere for his sons. He judged Israel\nseven years.\nSo when I saw that you would not\ndeliver me, I took my life in my hands\nand crossed over against the people of\nAmmon; and the LORD delivered them\ninto my hand. Why then have you come\nup to me this day to fight against me?\"\nNow Jephthah gathered together all the\nmen of Gilead and fought against\nEphraim. And the men of Gilead\ndefeated Ephraim, because they said,\n\"You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim\namong the Ephraimites and among the\nManassites.\"\nThe Gileadites seized the fords of the\nJordan before the Ephraimites arrived.\nAnd when any Ephraimite who escaped\nsaid, \"Let me cross over,\" the men of\nGilead would say to him, \"Are you an\nEphraimite?\" If he said, \"No,\"\nthen they would say to him, \"Then say,\n\"Shibboleth'!\" And he would say,\n\"Sibboleth,\" for he could not pronounce\nit right. Then they would take him and\nkill him at the fords of the Jordan. There\nThen Ibzan died and was buried at\nBethlehem.\nAfter him, Elon the Zebulunite judged\nIsrael. He judged Israel ten years.\nAnd Elon the Zebulunite died and was\nburied at Aijalon in the country of\nZebulun.\nAfter him, Abdon the son of Hillel the\nPirathonite judged Israel.\nHe had forty sons and thirty grandsons,\nwho rode on seventy young donkeys.\nHe judged Israel eight years.\nThen Abdon the son of Hillel the\nPirathonite died and was buried in\nPirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the\nmountains of the Amalekites.\n13Again the children of Israel did evil\nin the sight of the LORD, and the LORD\ndelivered them into the hand of the\nPhilistines for forty years.\nand teach us what we shall do for the\nchild who will be born.\"\nNow there was a certain man from\nZorah, of the family of the Danites,\nwhose name was Manoah; and his wife\nwas barren and had no children.\nAnd God listened to the voice of\nManoah, and the Angel of God came to\nthe woman again as she was sitting in\nthe field; but Manoah her husband was\nnot with her.\nAnd the Angel of the LORD appeared\nto the woman and said to her, \"Indeed\nnow, you are barren and have borne no\nchildren, but you shall conceive and\nbear a son.\nThen the woman ran in haste and told\nher husband, and said to him, \"Look, the\nMan who came to me the other day has\njust now appeared to me!\"\nNow therefore, please be careful not to\ndrink wine or similar drink, and not to eat\nanything unclean.\nSo Manoah arose and followed his\nwife. When he came to the Man, he said\nto Him, \"Are You the Man who spoke to\nthis woman?\" And He said, \"I am.\"\nFor behold, you shall conceive and\nbear a son. And no razor shall come\nupon his head, for the child shall be a\nNazirite to God from the womb; and he\nshall begin to deliver Israel out of the\nhand of the Philistines.\"\nSo the woman came and told her\nhusband, saying, \"A Man of God came\nto me, and His countenance was like the\ncountenance of the Angel of God, very\nawesome; but I did not ask Him where\nHe was from, and He did not tell me His\nname.\nAnd He said to me, \"Behold, you shall\nconceive and bear a son. Now drink no\nwine or similar drink, nor eat anything\nunclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite\nto God from the womb to the day of his\ndeath.\"'\nThen Manoah prayed to the LORD, and\nsaid, \"O my Lord, please let the Man of\nGod whom You sent come to us again\nManoah said, \"Now let Your words\ncome to pass! What will be the boy's\nrule of life, and his work?\"\nSo the Angel of the LORD said to\nManoah, \"Of all that I said to the woman\nlet her be careful.\nShe may not eat anything that comes\nfrom the vine, nor may she drink wine or\nsimilar drink, nor eat anything unclean.\nAll that I commanded her let her\nobserve.\"\nThen Manoah said to the Angel of the\nLORD, \"Please let us detain You, and\nwe will prepare a young goat for You.\"\nAnd the Angel of the LORD said to\nManoah, \"Though you detain Me, I will\nnot eat your food. But if you offer a burnt\noffering, you must offer it to the LORD.\"\n(For Manoah did not know He was the\nAngel of the LORD.)\nThen Manoah said to the Angel of the\nLORD, \"What is Your name, that when\nYour words come to pass we may honor\nYou?\"\nAnd the Angel of the LORD said to him,\n\"Why do you ask My name, seeing it is\nwonderful?\"\nSo Manoah took the young goat with\nthe grain offering, and offered it upon\nthe rock to the LORD. And He did a\nwondrous thing while Manoah and his\nwife looked on-20\nit happened as the flame went up\ntoward heaven from the altar--the Angel\nof the LORD ascended in the flame of\nthe altar! When Manoah and his wife\nsaw this, they fell on their faces to the\nground.\nWhen the Angel of the LORD\nappeared no more to Manoah and his\nwife, then Manoah knew that He was\nthe Angel of the LORD.\nAnd the Spirit of the LORD began to\nmove upon him at Mahaneh Dan\nbetween Zorah and Eshtaol.\n14Now Samson went down to\nTimnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of\nthe daughters of the Philistines.\nSo he went up and told his father and\nmother, saying, \"I have seen a woman\nin Timnah of the daughters of the\nPhilistines; now therefore, get her for me\nas a wife.\"\nThen his father and mother said to him,\n\"Is there no woman among the\ndaughters of your brethren, or among all\nmy people, that you must go and get a\nwife\nfrom\nthe\nuncircumcised\nPhilistines?\" And Samson said to his\nfather, \"Get her for me, for she pleases\nme well.\"\nAnd Manoah said to his wife, \"We shall\nsurely die, because we have seen God!\"\nBut his father and mother did not know\nthat it was of the LORD--that He was\nseeking an occasion to move against\nthe Philistines. For at that time the\nPhilistines had dominion over Israel.\nBut his wife said to him, \"If the LORD\nhad desired to kill us, He would not have\naccepted a burnt offering and a grain\noffering from our hands, nor would He\nhave shown us all these things, nor\nwould He have told us such things as\nthese at this time.\"\nSo the woman bore a son and called\nhis name Samson; and the child grew,\nand the LORD blessed him.\nSo Samson went down to Timnah with\nhis father and mother, and came to the\nvineyards of Timnah. Now to his\nsurprise, a young lion came roaring\nagainst him.\nAnd the Spirit of the LORD came\nmightily upon him, and he tore the lion\napart as one would have torn apart a\nyoung goat, though he had nothing in\nhis hand. But he did not tell his father or\nhis mother what he had done.\nThen he went down and talked with the\nwoman; and she pleased Samson well.\nAfter some time, when he returned to\nget her, he turned aside to see the\ncarcass of the lion. And behold, a\nswarm of bees and honey were in the\ncarcass of the lion.\nHe took some of it in his hands and\nwent along, eating. When he came to\nhis father and mother, he gave some to\nthem, and they also ate. But he did not\ntell them that he had taken the honey\nout of the carcass of the lion.\nBut it came to pass on the seventh day\nthat they said to Samson's wife, \"Entice\nyour husband, that he may explain the\nriddle to us, or else we will burn you and\nyour father's house with fire. Have you\ninvited us in order to take what is ours?\nIs that not so?\"\nThen Samson's wife wept on him, and\nsaid, \"You only hate me! You do not\nlove me! You have posed a riddle to the\nsons of my people, but you have not\nexplained it to me.\" And he said to her,\n\"Look, I have not explained it to my\nfather or my mother; so should I explain\nit to you?\"\nSo his father went down to the woman.\nAnd Samson gave a feast there, for\nyoung men used to do so.\nAnd it happened, when they saw him,\nthat they brought thirty companions to\nbe with him.\nThen Samson said to them, \"Let me\npose a riddle to you. If you can correctly\nsolve and explain it to me within the\nseven days of the feast, then I will give\nyou thirty linen garments and thirty\nchanges of clothing.\nBut if you cannot explain it to me, then\nyou shall give me thirty linen garments\nand thirty changes of clothing.\" And they\nsaid to him, \"Pose your riddle, that we\nmay hear it.\"\nSo he said to them: \"Out of the eater\ncame something to eat, And out of the\nstrong came something sweet.\" Now for\nthree days they could not explain the\nriddle.\nNow she had wept on him the seven\ndays while their feast lasted. And it\nhappened on the seventh day that he\ntold her, because she pressed him so\nmuch. Then she explained the riddle to\nthe sons of her people.\nSo the men of the city said to him on\nthe seventh day before the sun went\ndown: \"What is sweeter than honey?\nAnd what is stronger than a lion?\" And\nhe said to them: \"If you had not plowed\nwith my heifer, You would not have\nsolved my riddle!\"\nThen the Spirit of the LORD came\nupon him mightily, and he went down to\nAshkelon and killed thirty of their men,\ntook their apparel, and gave the\nchanges of clothing to those who had\nexplained the riddle. So his anger was\naroused, and he went back up to his\nfather's house.\nAnd Samson's wife was given to his\ncompanion, who had been his best man.\n15After a while, in the time of wheat\nharvest, it happened that Samson\nvisited his wife with a young goat. And\nhe said, \"Let me go in to my wife, into\nher room.\" But her father would not\npermit him to go in.\nSo he attacked them hip and thigh with\na great slaughter; then he went down\nand dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.\nNow the Philistines went up, encamped\nin Judah, and deployed themselves\nagainst Lehi.\nHer father said, \"I really thought that\nyou thoroughly hated her; therefore I\ngave her to your companion. Is not her\nyounger sister better than she? Please,\ntake her instead.\"\nAnd the men of Judah said, \"Why have\nyou come up against us?\" So they\nanswered, \"We have come up to arrest\nSamson, to do to him as he has done to\nus.\"\nAnd Samson said to them, \"This time I\nshall be blameless regarding the\nPhilistines if I harm them!\"\nThen Samson went and caught three\nhundred foxes; and he took torches,\nturned the foxes tail to tail, and put a\ntorch between each pair of tails.\nWhen he had set the torches on fire, he\nlet the foxes go into the standing grain\nof the Philistines, and burned up both\nthe shocks and the standing grain, as\nwell as the vineyards and olive groves.\nThen the Philistines said, \"Who has\ndone this?\" And they answered,\n\"Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite,\nbecause he has taken his wife and\ngiven her to his companion.\" So the\nPhilistines came up and burned her and\nher father with fire.\nSamson said to them, \"Since you would\ndo a thing like this, I will surely take\nrevenge on you, and after that I will\ncease.\"\nThen three thousand men of Judah\nwent down to the cleft of the rock of\nEtam, and said to Samson, \"Do you not\nknow that the Philistines rule over us?\nWhat is this you have done to us?\" And\nhe said to them, \"As they did to me, so I\nhave done to them.\"\nBut they said to him, \"We have come\ndown to arrest you, that we may deliver\nyou into the hand of the Philistines.\"\nThen Samson said to them, \"Swear to\nme that you will not kill me yourselves.\"\nSo they spoke to him, saying, \"No, but\nwe will tie you securely and deliver you\ninto their hand; but we will surely not kill\nyou.\" And they bound him with two new\nropes and brought him up from the rock.\nWhen he came to Lehi, the Philistines\ncame shouting against him. Then the\nSpirit of the LORD came mightily upon\nhim; and the ropes that were on his\narms became like flax that is burned\nwith fire, and his bonds broke loose from\nhis hands.\nHe found a fresh jawbone of a donkey,\nreached out his hand and took it, and\nkilled a thousand men with it.\nThen Samson said: \"With the jawbone\nof a donkey, Heaps upon heaps, With\nthe jawbone of a donkey I have slain a\nthousand men!\"\ndoors of the gate of the city and the two\ngateposts, pulled them up, bar and all,\nput them on his shoulders, and carried\nthem to the top of the hill that faces\nHebron.\nAfterward it happened that he loved a\nwoman in the Valley of Sorek, whose\nname was Delilah.\nAnd so it was, when he had finished\nspeaking, that he threw the jawbone\nfrom his hand, and called that place\nRamath Lehi.\nThen he became very thirsty; so he\ncried out to the LORD and said, \"You\nhave given this great deliverance by the\nhand of Your servant; and now shall I\ndie of thirst and fall into the hand of the\nuncircumcised?\"\nSo God split the hollow place that is in\nLehi, and water came out, and he drank;\nand his spirit returned, and he revived.\nTherefore he called its name En\nHakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.\nAnd the lords of the Philistines came up\nto her and said to her, \"Entice him, and\nfind out where his great strength lies,\nand by what means we may overpower\nhim, that we may bind him to afflict him;\nand every one of us will give you eleven\nhundred pieces of silver.\"\nSo Delilah said to Samson, \"Please tell\nme where your great strength lies, and\nwith what you may be bound to afflict\nyou.\"\nAnd Samson said to her, \"If they bind\nme with seven fresh bowstrings, not yet\ndried, then I shall become weak, and be\nlike any other man.\"\nAnd he judged Israel twenty years in\nthe days of the Philistines.\n16Now Samson went to Gaza and\nsaw a harlot there, and went in to her.\nWhen the Gazites were told, \"Samson\nhas come here!\" they surrounded the\nplace and lay in wait for him all night at\nthe gate of the city. They were quiet all\nnight, saying, \"In the morning, when it is\ndaylight, we will kill him.\"\nAnd Samson lay low till midnight; then\nhe arose at midnight, took hold of the\nSo the lords of the Philistines brought\nup to her seven fresh bowstrings, not\nyet dried, and she bound him with them.\nNow men were lying in wait, staying\nwith her in the room. And she said to\nhim, \"The Philistines are upon you,\nSamson!\" But he broke the bowstrings\nas a strand of yarn breaks when it\ntouches fire. So the secret of his\nstrength was not known.\nThen Delilah said to Samson, \"Look,\nyou have mocked me and told me lies.\nNow, please tell me what you may be\nbound with.\"\nshaven, then my strength will leave me,\nand I shall become weak, and be like\nany other man.\"\nSo he said to her, \"If they bind me\nsecurely with new ropes that have never\nbeen used, then I shall become weak,\nand be like any other man.\"\nTherefore Delilah took new ropes and\nbound him with them, and said to him,\n\"The Philistines are upon you, Samson!\"\nAnd men were lying in wait, staying in\nthe room. But he broke them off his\narms like a thread.\nDelilah said to Samson, \"Until now you\nhave mocked me and told me lies. Tell\nme what you may be bound with.\" And\nhe said to her, \"If you weave the seven\nlocks of my head into the web of the\nloom\"-14\nSo she wove it tightly with the batten\nof the loom, and said to him, \"The\nPhilistines are upon you, Samson!\" But\nhe awoke from his sleep, and pulled out\nthe batten and the web from the loom.\nThen she said to him, \"How can you\nsay, \"I love you,' when your heart is not\nwith me? You have mocked me these\nthree times, and have not told me where\nyour great strength lies.\"\nAnd it came to pass, when she\npestered him daily with her words and\npressed him, so that his soul was vexed\nto death,\nthat he told her all his heart, and said\nto her, \"No razor has ever come upon\nmy head, for I have been a Nazirite to\nGod from my mother's womb. If I am\nWhen Delilah saw that he had told her\nall his heart, she sent and called for the\nlords of the Philistines, saying, \"Come\nup once more, for he has told me all his\nheart.\" So the lords of the Philistines\ncame up to her and brought the money\nin their hand.\nThen she lulled him to sleep on her\nknees, and called for a man and had\nhim shave off the seven locks of his\nhead. Then she began to torment him,\nand his strength left him.\nAnd she said, \"The Philistines are\nupon you, Samson!\" So he awoke from\nhis sleep, and said, \"I will go out as\nbefore, at other times, and shake myself\nfree!\" But he did not know that the\nLORD had departed from him.\nThen the Philistines took him and put\nout his eyes, and brought him down to\nGaza. They bound him with bronze\nfetters, and he became a grinder in the\nprison.\nHowever, the hair of his head began to\ngrow again after it had been shaven.\nNow the lords of the Philistines\ngathered together to offer a great\nsacrifice to Dagon their god, and to\nrejoice. And they said: \"Our god has\ndelivered into our hands Samson our\nenemy!\"\nWhen the people saw him, they\npraised their god; for they said: \"Our god\nhas delivered into our hands our enemy,\nThe destroyer of our land, And the one\nwho multiplied our dead.\"\nSo it happened, when their hearts\nwere merry, that they said, \"Call for\nSamson, that he may perform for us.\"\nSo they called for Samson from the\nprison, and he performed for them. And\nthey stationed him between the pillars.\nThen Samson said to the lad who held\nhim by the hand, \"Let me feel the pillars\nwhich support the temple, so that I can\nlean on them.\"\nNow the temple was full of men and\nwomen. All the lords of the Philistines\nwere there--about three thousand men\nand women on the roof watching while\nSamson performed.\nThen Samson called to the LORD,\nsaying, \"O Lord GOD, remember me, I\npray! Strengthen me, I pray, just this\nonce, O God, that I may with one blow\ntake vengeance on the Philistines for my\ntwo eyes!\"\nAnd his brothers and all his father's\nhousehold came down and took him,\nand brought him up and buried him\nbetween Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb\nof his father Manoah. He had judged\nIsrael twenty years.\n17Now there was a man from the\nmountains of Ephraim, whose name\nwas Micah.\nAnd he said to his mother, \"The eleven\nhundred shekels of silver that were\ntaken from you, and on which you put a\ncurse, even saying it in my ears--here is\nthe silver with me; I took it.\" And his\nmother said, \"May you be blessed by\nthe LORD, my son!\"\nSo when he had returned the eleven\nhundred shekels of silver to his mother,\nhis mother said, \"I had wholly dedicated\nthe silver from my hand to the LORD for\nmy son, to make a carved image and a\nmolded image; now therefore, I will\nreturn it to you.\"\nAnd Samson took hold of the two\nmiddle pillars which supported the\ntemple, and he braced himself against\nthem, one on his right and the other on\nhis left.\nThus he returned the silver to his\nmother. Then his mother took two\nhundred shekels of silver and gave them\nto the silversmith, and he made it into a\ncarved image and a molded image; and\nthey were in the house of Micah.\nThen Samson said, \"Let me die with\nthe Philistines!\" And he pushed with all\nhis might, and the temple fell on the\nlords and all the people who were in it.\nSo the dead that he killed at his death\nwere more than he had killed in his life.\nThe man Micah had a shrine, and\nmade an ephod and household idols;\nand he consecrated one of his sons,\nwho became his priest.\nIn those days there was no king in\nIsrael; everyone did what was right in\nhis own eyes.\nNow there was a young man from\nBethlehem in Judah, of the family of\nJudah; he was a Levite, and was staying\nthere.\nThe man departed from the city of\nBethlehem in Judah to stay wherever he\ncould find a place. Then he came to the\nmountains of Ephraim, to the house of\nMicah, as he journeyed.\nAnd Micah said to him, \"Where do you\ncome from?\" So he said to him, \"I am a\nLevite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I\nam on my way to find a place to stay.\"\nMicah said to him, \"Dwell with me, and\nbe a father and a priest to me, and I will\ngive you ten shekels of silver per year, a\nsuit of clothes, and your sustenance.\"\nSo the Levite went in.\nThen the Levite was content to dwell\nwith the man; and the young man\nbecame like one of his sons to him.\nSo Micah consecrated the Levite, and\nthe young man became his priest, and\nlived in the house of Micah.\nThen Micah said, \"Now I know that the\nLORD will be good to me, since I have a\nLevite as priest!\"\n18In those days there was no king in\nIsrael. And in those days the tribe of the\nDanites was seeking an inheritance for\nitself to dwell in; for until that day their\ninheritance among the tribes of Israel\nhad not fallen to them.\nSo the children of Dan sent five men of\ntheir family from their territory, men of\nvalor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out\nthe land and search it. They said to\nthem, \"Go, search the land.\" So they\nwent to the mountains of Ephraim, to the\nhouse of Micah, and lodged there.\nWhile they were at the house of Micah,\nthey recognized the voice of the young\nLevite. They turned aside and said to\nhim, \"Who brought you here? What are\nyou doing in this place? What do you\nhave here?\"\nHe said to them, \"Thus and so Micah\ndid for me. He has hired me, and I have\nbecome his priest.\"\nSo they said to him, \"Please inquire of\nGod, that we may know whether the\njourney on which we go will be\nprosperous.\"\nAnd the priest said to them, \"Go in\npeace. The presence of the LORD be\nwith you on your way.\"\nSo the five men departed and went to\nLaish. They saw the people who were\nthere, how they dwelt safely, in the\nmanner of the Sidonians, quiet and\nsecure. There were no rulers in the land\nwho might put them to shame for\nanything. They were far from the\nSidonians, and they had no ties with\nanyone.\nThen the spies came back to their\nbrethren at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their\nbrethren said to them, \"What is your\nreport?\"\nSo they said, \"Arise, let us go up\nagainst them. For we have seen the\nland, and indeed it is very good. Would\nyou do nothing? Do not hesitate to go,\nand enter to possess the land.\nWhen you go, you will come to a\nsecure people and a large land. For God\nhas given it into your hands, a place\nwhere there is no lack of anything that is\non the earth.\"\nAnd six hundred men of the family of\nthe Danites went from there, from Zorah\nand Eshtaol, armed with weapons of\nwar.\nThen they went up and encamped in\nKirjath Jearim in Judah. (Therefore they\ncall that place Mahaneh Dan to this day.\nThere it is, west of Kirjath Jearim.)\nThen the five men who had gone to\nspy out the land went up. Entering there,\nthey took the carved image, the ephod,\nthe household idols, and the molded\nimage. The priest stood at the entrance\nof the gate with the six hundred men\nwho were armed with weapons of war.\nWhen these went into Micah's house\nand took the carved image, the ephod,\nthe household idols, and the molded\nimage, the priest said to them, \"What\nare you doing?\"\nAnd they said to him, \"Be quiet, put\nyour hand over your mouth, and come\nwith us; be a father and a priest to us. Is\nit better for you to be a priest to the\nhousehold of one man, or that you be a\npriest to a tribe and a family in Israel?\"\nAnd they passed from there to the\nmountains of Ephraim, and came to the\nhouse of Micah.\nSo the priest's heart was glad; and he\ntook the ephod, the household idols,\nand the carved image, and took his\nplace among the people.\nThen the five men who had gone to\nspy out the country of Laish answered\nand said to their brethren, \"Do you know\nthat there are in these houses an ephod,\nhousehold idols, a carved image, and a\nmolded image? Now therefore, consider\nwhat you should do.\"\nSo they turned aside there, and came\nto the house of the young Levite man--to\nthe house of Micah--and greeted him.\nThe six hundred men armed with their\nweapons of war, who were of the\nchildren of Dan, stood by the entrance\nof the gate.\nThen they turned and departed, and\nput the little ones, the livestock, and the\ngoods in front of them.\nWhen they were a good way from the\nhouse of Micah, the men who were in\nthe houses near Micah's house\ngathered together and overtook the\nchildren of Dan.\nAnd they called out to the children of\nDan. So they turned around and said to\nMicah, \"What ails you, that you have\ngathered such a company?\"\nSo he said, \"You have taken away my\ngods which I made, and the priest, and\nyou have gone away. Now what more\ndo I have? How can you say to me,\n\"What ails you?\"'\nAnd the children of Dan said to him,\n\"Do not let your voice be heard among\nus, lest angry men fall upon you, and\nyou lose your life, with the lives of your\nhousehold!\"\nThen the children of Dan went their\nway. And when Micah saw that they\nwere too strong for him, he turned and\nwent back to his house.\n19And it came to pass in those days,\nwhen there was no king in Israel, that\nthere was a certain Levite staying in the\nremote mountains of Ephraim. He took\nfor himself a concubine from Bethlehem\nin Judah.\nBut his concubine played the harlot\nagainst him, and went away from him to\nher father's house at Bethlehem in\nJudah, and was there four whole\nmonths.\nSo they took the things Micah had\nmade, and the priest who had belonged\nto him, and went to Laish, to a people\nquiet and secure; and they struck them\nwith the edge of the sword and burned\nthe city with fire.\nThen her husband arose and went after\nher, to speak kindly to her and bring her\nback, having his servant and a couple of\ndonkeys with him. So she brought him\ninto her father's house; and when the\nfather of the young woman saw him, he\nwas glad to meet him.\nThere was no deliverer, because it\nwas far from Sidon, and they had no ties\nwith anyone. It was in the valley that\nbelongs to Beth Rehob. So they rebuilt\nthe city and dwelt there.\nNow his father-in-law, the young\nwoman's father, detained him; and he\nstayed with him three days. So they ate\nand drank and lodged there.\nAnd they called the name of the city\nDan, after the name of Dan their father,\nwho was born to Israel. However, the\nname of the city formerly was Laish.\nThen it came to pass on the fourth day\nthat they arose early in the morning, and\nhe stood to depart; but the young\nwoman's father said to his son-in-law,\n\"Refresh your heart with a morsel of\nbread, and afterward go your way.\"\nThen the children of Dan set up for\nthemselves the carved image; and\nJonathan the son of Gershom, the son\nof Manasseh, and his sons were priests\nto the tribe of Dan until the day of the\ncaptivity of the land.\nSo they sat down, and the two of them\nate and drank together. Then the young\nwoman's father said to the man, \"Please\nbe content to stay all night, and let your\nheart be merry.\"\nSo they set up for themselves Micah's\ncarved image which he made, all the\ntime that the house of God was in Shiloh.\nAnd when the man stood to depart, his\nfather-in-law urged him; so he lodged\nthere again.\nThen he arose early in the morning on\nthe fifth day to depart, but the young\nwoman's father said, \"Please refresh\nyour heart.\" So they delayed until\nafternoon; and both of them ate.\nThey turned aside there to go in to\nlodge in Gibeah. And when he went in,\nhe sat down in the open square of the\ncity, for no one would take them into his\nhouse to spend the night.\nAnd when the man stood to depart--he\nand his concubine and his servant--his\nfather-in-law, the young woman's father,\nsaid to him, \"Look, the day is now\ndrawing toward evening; please spend\nthe night. See, the day is coming to an\nend; lodge here, that your heart may be\nmerry. Tomorrow go your way early, so\nthat you may get home.\"\nHowever, the man was not willing to\nspend that night; so he rose and\ndeparted, and came opposite Jebus\n(that is, Jerusalem). With him were the\ntwo saddled donkeys; his concubine\nwas also with him.\nThey were near Jebus, and the day\nwas far spent; and the servant said to\nhis master, \"Come, please, and let us\nturn aside into this city of the Jebusites\nand lodge in it.\"\nBut his master said to him, \"We will not\nturn aside here into a city of foreigners,\nwho are not of the children of Israel; we\nwill go on to Gibeah.\"\nSo he said to his servant, \"Come, let\nus draw near to one of these places,\nand spend the night in Gibeah or in\nRamah.\"\nAnd they passed by and went their\nway; and the sun went down on them\nnear Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.\nJust then an old man came in from his\nwork in the field at evening, who also\nwas from the mountains of Ephraim; he\nwas staying in Gibeah, whereas the\nmen of the place were Benjamites.\nAnd when he raised his eyes, he saw\nthe traveler in the open square of the\ncity; and the old man said, \"Where are\nyou going, and where do you come\nfrom?\"\nSo he said to him, \"We are passing\nfrom Bethlehem in Judah toward the\nremote mountains of Ephraim; I am from\nthere. I went to Bethlehem in Judah;\nnow I am going to the house of the\nLORD. But there is no one who will take\nme into his house,\nalthough we have both straw and\nfodder for our donkeys, and bread and\nwine for myself, for your female servant,\nand for the young man who is with your\nservant; there is no lack of anything.\"\nAnd the old man said, \"Peace be with\nyou! However, let all your needs be my\nresponsibility; only do not spend the\nnight in the open square.\"\nSo he brought him into his house, and\ngave fodder to the donkeys. And they\nwashed their feet, and ate and drank.\nAs they were enjoying themselves,\nsuddenly certain men of the city,\nperverted men, surrounded the house\nand beat on the door. They spoke to the\nmaster of the house, the old man,\nsaying, \"Bring out the man who came to\nyour house, that we may know him\ncarnally!\"\nWhen he entered his house he took a\nknife, laid hold of his concubine, and\ndivided her into twelve pieces, limb by\nlimb, and sent her throughout all the\nterritory of Israel.\nBut the man, the master of the house,\nwent out to them and said to them, \"No,\nmy brethren! I beg you, do not act so\nwickedly! Seeing this man has come\ninto my house, do not commit this\noutrage.\nLook, here is my virgin daughter and\nthe man's concubine; let me bring them\nout now. Humble them, and do with\nthem as you please; but to this man do\nnot do such a vile thing!\"\nBut the men would not heed him. So\nthe man took his concubine and brought\nher out to them. And they knew her and\nabused her all night until morning; and\nwhen the day began to break, they let\nher go.\nThen the woman came as the day was\ndawning, and fell down at the door of\nthe man's house where her master was,\ntill it was light.\nWhen her master arose in the morning,\nand opened the doors of the house and\nwent out to go his way, there was his\nconcubine, fallen at the door of the\nhouse with her hands on the threshold.\nAnd he said to her, \"Get up and let us\nbe going.\" But there was no answer. So\nthe man lifted her onto the donkey; and\nthe man got up and went to his place.\nAnd so it was that all who saw it said,\n\"No such deed has been done or seen\nfrom the day that the children of Israel\ncame up from the land of Egypt until this\nday. Consider it, confer, and speak up!\"\n20So all the children of Israel came\nout, from Dan to Beersheba, as well as\nfrom the land of Gilead, and the\ncongregation gathered together as one\nman before the LORD at Mizpah.\nAnd the leaders of all the people, all the\ntribes of Israel, presented themselves in\nthe assembly of the people of God, four\nhundred thousand foot soldiers who\ndrew the sword.\n(Now the children of Benjamin heard\nthat the children of Israel had gone up to\nMizpah.) Then the children of Israel said,\n\"Tell us, how did this wicked deed\nhappen?\"\nSo the Levite, the husband of the\nwoman who was murdered, answered\nand said, \"My concubine and I went into\nGibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, to\nspend the night.\nAnd the men of Gibeah rose against\nme, and surrounded the house at night\nbecause of me. They intended to kill me,\nbut instead they ravished my concubine\nso that she died.\nSo I took hold of my concubine, cut her\nin pieces, and sent her throughout all\nthe territory of the inheritance of Israel,\nbecause they committed lewdness and\noutrage in Israel.\nInstead, the children of Benjamin\ngathered together from their cities to\nGibeah, to go to battle against the\nchildren of Israel.\nLook! All of you are children of Israel;\ngive your advice and counsel here and\nnow!\"\nAnd from their cities at that time the\nchildren of Benjamin numbered twentysix thousand men who drew the sword,\nbesides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who\nnumbered seven hundred select men.\nSo all the people arose as one man,\nsaying, \"None of us will go to his tent,\nnor will any turn back to his house;\nbut now this is the thing which we will\ndo to Gibeah: We will go up against it by\nlot.\nWe will take ten men out of every\nhundred throughout all the tribes of\nIsrael, a hundred out of every thousand,\nand a thousand out of every ten\nthousand, to make provisions for the\npeople, that when they come to Gibeah\nin Benjamin, they may repay all the\nvileness that they have done in Israel.\"\nAmong all this people were seven\nhundred select men who were lefthanded; every one could sling a stone at\na hair's breadth and not miss.\nNow besides Benjamin, the men of\nIsrael numbered four hundred thousand\nmen who drew the sword; all of these\nwere men of war.\nThen the children of Israel arose and\nwent up to the house of God to inquire\nof God. They said, \"Which of us shall go\nup first to battle against the children of\nBenjamin?\" The LORD said, \"Judah\nfirst!\"\nSo all the men of Israel were gathered\nagainst the city, united together as one\nman.\nSo the children of Israel rose in the\nmorning and encamped against Gibeah.\nThen the tribes of Israel sent men\nthrough all the tribe of Benjamin, saying,\n\"What is this wickedness that has\noccurred among you?\nAnd the men of Israel went out to\nbattle against Benjamin, and the men of\nIsrael put themselves in battle array to\nfight against them at Gibeah.\nNow therefore, deliver up the men, the\nperverted men who are in Gibeah, that\nwe may put them to death and remove\nthe evil from Israel!\" But the children of\nBenjamin would not listen to the voice of\ntheir brethren, the children of Israel.\nThen the children of Benjamin came\nout of Gibeah, and on that day cut down\nto the ground twenty-two thousand men\nof the Israelites.\nAnd the people, that is, the men of\nIsrael, encouraged themselves and\nagain formed the battle line at the place\nwhere they had put themselves in array\non the first day.\nThen Israel set men in ambush all\naround Gibeah.\nThen the children of Israel went up\nand wept before the LORD until evening,\nand asked counsel of the LORD, saying,\n\"Shall I again draw near for battle\nagainst the children of my brother\nBenjamin?\" And the LORD said, \"Go up\nagainst him.\"\nSo the children of Israel approached\nthe children of Benjamin on the second\nday.\nAnd Benjamin went out against them\nfrom Gibeah on the second day, and cut\ndown to the ground eighteen thousand\nmore of the children of Israel; all these\ndrew the sword.\nThen all the children of Israel, that is,\nall the people, went up and came to the\nhouse of God and wept. They sat there\nbefore the LORD and fasted that day\nuntil evening; and they offered burnt\nofferings and peace offerings before the\nLORD.\nSo the children of Israel inquired of the\nLORD (the ark of the covenant of God\nwas there in those days,\nAnd the children of Israel went up\nagainst the children of Benjamin on the\nthird day, and put themselves in battle\narray against Gibeah as at the other\ntimes.\nSo the children of Benjamin went out\nagainst the people, and were drawn\naway from the city. They began to strike\ndown and kill some of the people, as at\nthe other times, in the highways (one of\nwhich goes up to Bethel and the other to\nGibeah) and in the field, about thirty\nmen of Israel.\nAnd the children of Benjamin said,\n\"They are defeated before us, as at\nfirst.\" But the children of Israel said, \"Let\nus flee and draw them away from the\ncity to the highways.\"\nSo all the men of Israel rose from their\nplace and put themselves in battle array\nat Baal Tamar. Then Israel's men in\nambush burst forth from their position in\nthe plain of Geba.\nAnd ten thousand select men from all\nIsrael came against Gibeah, and the\nbattle was fierce. But the Benjamites did\nnot know that disaster was upon them.\nand Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the\nson of Aaron, stood before it in those\ndays), saying, \"Shall I yet again go out\nto battle against the children of my\nbrother Benjamin, or shall I cease?\" And\nthe LORD said, \"Go up, for tomorrow I\nwill deliver them into your hand.\"\nThe LORD defeated Benjamin before\nIsrael. And the children of Israel\ndestroyed that day twenty-five thousand\none hundred Benjamites; all these drew\nthe sword.\nSo the children of Benjamin saw that\nthey were defeated. The men of Israel\nhad given ground to the Benjamites,\nbecause they relied on the men in\nambush whom they had set against\nGibeah.\nAnd eighteen thousand men of\nBenjamin fell; all these were men of\nvalor.\nAnd the men in ambush quickly rushed\nupon Gibeah; the men in ambush\nspread out and struck the whole city\nwith the edge of the sword.\nThen they turned and fled toward the\nwilderness to the rock of Rimmon; and\nthey cut down five thousand of them on\nthe highways. Then they pursued them\nrelentlessly up to Gidom, and killed two\nthousand of them.\nNow the appointed signal between the\nmen of Israel and the men in ambush\nwas that they would make a great cloud\nof smoke rise up from the city,\nSo all who fell of Benjamin that day\nwere twenty-five thousand men who\ndrew the sword; all these were men of\nvalor.\nwhereupon the men of Israel would\nturn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun\nto strike and kill about thirty of the men\nof Israel. For they said, \"Surely they are\ndefeated before us, as in the first battle.\"\nBut six hundred men turned and fled\ntoward the wilderness to the rock of\nRimmon, and they stayed at the rock of\nRimmon for four months.\nBut when the cloud began to rise from\nthe city in a column of smoke, the\nBenjamites looked behind them, and\nthere was the whole city going up in\nsmoke to heaven.\nAnd the men of Israel turned back\nagainst the children of Benjamin, and\nstruck them down with the edge of the\nsword--from every city, men and beasts,\nall who were found. They also set fire to\nall the cities they came to.\nAnd when the men of Israel turned\nback, the men of Benjamin panicked, for\nthey saw that disaster had come upon\nthem.\nTherefore they turned their backs\nbefore the men of Israel in the direction\nof the wilderness; but the battle overtook\nthem, and whoever came out of the\ncities they destroyed in their midst.\nThey surrounded the Benjamites,\nchased them, and easily trampled them\ndown as far as the front of Gibeah\ntoward the east.\n21Now the men of Israel had sworn\nan oath at Mizpah, saying, \"None of us\nshall give his daughter to Benjamin as a\nwife.\"\nThen the people came to the house of\nGod, and remained there before God till\nevening. They lifted up their voices and\nwept bitterly,\nand said, \"O LORD God of Israel, why\nhas this come to pass in Israel, that\ntoday there should be one tribe missing\nin Israel?\"\nSo it was, on the next morning, that the\npeople rose early and built an altar there,\nand offered burnt offerings and peace\nofferings.\nThe children of Israel said, \"Who is\nthere among all the tribes of Israel who\ndid not come up with the assembly to\nthe LORD?\" For they had made a great\noath concerning anyone who had not\ncome up to the LORD at Mizpah, saying,\n\"He shall surely be put to death.\"\nSo they found among the inhabitants\nof Jabesh Gilead four hundred young\nvirgins who had not known a man\nintimately; and they brought them to the\ncamp at Shiloh, which is in the land of\nCanaan.\nThen the whole congregation sent\nword to the children of Benjamin who\nwere at the rock of Rimmon, and\nannounced peace to them.\nAnd the children of Israel grieved for\nBenjamin their brother, and said, \"One\ntribe is cut off from Israel today.\nSo Benjamin came back at that time,\nand they gave them the women whom\nthey had saved alive of the women of\nJabesh Gilead; and yet they had not\nfound enough for them.\nWhat shall we do for wives for those\nwho remain, seeing we have sworn by\nthe LORD that we will not give them our\ndaughters as wives?\"\nAnd the people grieved for Benjamin,\nbecause the LORD had made a void in\nthe tribes of Israel.\nAnd they said, \"What one is there from\nthe tribes of Israel who did not come up\nto Mizpah to the LORD?\" And, in fact,\nno one had come to the camp from\nJabesh Gilead to the assembly.\nThen the elders of the congregation\nsaid, \"What shall we do for wives for\nthose who remain, since the women of\nBenjamin have been destroyed?\"\nFor when the people were counted,\nindeed, not one of the inhabitants of\nJabesh Gilead was there.\nAnd they said, \"There must be an\ninheritance for the survivors of Benjamin,\nthat a tribe may not be destroyed from\nIsrael.\nSo the congregation sent out there\ntwelve thousand of their most valiant\nmen, and commanded them, saying,\n\"Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh\nGilead with the edge of the sword,\nincluding the women and children.\nHowever, we cannot give them wives\nfrom our daughters, for the children of\nIsrael have sworn an oath, saying,\n\"Cursed be the one who gives a wife to\nBenjamin.\"'\nAnd this is the thing that you shall do:\nYou shall utterly destroy every male,\nand every woman who has known a\nman intimately.\"\nThen they said, \"In fact, there is a\nyearly feast of the LORD in Shiloh,\nwhich is north of Bethel, on the east side\nof the highway that goes up from Bethel\nto Shechem, and south of Lebonah.\"\nTherefore they instructed the children\nof Benjamin, saying, \"Go, lie in wait in\nthe vineyards,\nand watch; and just when the\ndaughters of Shiloh come out to perform\ntheir dances, then come out from the\nvineyards, and every man catch a wife\nfor himself from the daughters of Shiloh;\nthen go to the land of Benjamin.\nAnd the children of Benjamin did so;\nthey took enough wives for their number\nfrom those who danced, whom they\ncaught. Then they went and returned to\ntheir inheritance, and they rebuilt the\ncities and dwelt in them.\nSo the children of Israel departed from\nthere at that time, every man to his tribe\nand family; they went out from there,\nevery man to his inheritance.\nThen it shall be, when their fathers or\ntheir brothers come to us to complain,\nthat we will say to them, \"Be kind to\nthem for our sakes, because we did not\ntake a wife for any of them in the war;\nfor it is not as though you have given the\nwomen to them at this time, making\nyourselves guilty of your oath.\"'\nIn those days there was no king in\nIsrael; everyone did what was right in\nhis own eyes.\nRuth\n1Now it came to pass, in the days\nwhen the judges ruled, that there was a\nfamine in the land. And a certain man of\nBethlehem, Judah, went to dwell in the\ncountry of Moab, he and his wife and his\ntwo sons.\nThe name of the man was Elimelech,\nthe name of his wife was Naomi, and\nthe names of his two sons were Mahlon\nand Chilion--Ephrathites of Bethlehem,\nJudah. And they went to the country of\nMoab and remained there.\nThen Elimelech, Naomi's husband,\ndied; and she was left, and her two sons.\nNow they took wives of the women of\nMoab: the name of the one was Orpah,\nand the name of the other Ruth. And\nthey dwelt there about ten years.\nThen both Mahlon and Chilion also\ndied; so the woman survived her two\nsons and her husband.\nThen she arose with her daughters-inlaw that she might return from the\ncountry of Moab, for she had heard in\nthe country of Moab that the LORD had\nvisited His people by giving them bread.\nTherefore she went out from the place\nwhere she was, and her two daughtersin-law with her; and they went on the\nway to return to the land of Judah.\nAnd Naomi said to her two daughtersin-law, \"Go, return each to her mother's\nhouse. The LORD deal kindly with you,\nas you have dealt with the dead and\nwith me.\nThe LORD grant that you may find rest,\neach in the house of her husband.\" So\nshe kissed them, and they lifted up their\nvoices and wept.\nAnd they said to her, \"Surely we will\nreturn with you to your people.\"\nBut Naomi said, \"Turn back, my\ndaughters; why will you go with me? Are\nthere still sons in my womb, that they\nmay be your husbands?\nTurn back, my daughters, go--for I am\ntoo old to have a husband. If I should\nsay I have hope, if I should have a\nhusband tonight and should also bear\nsons,\nwould you wait for them till they were\ngrown? Would you restrain yourselves\nfrom having husbands? No, my\ndaughters; for it grieves me very much\nfor your sakes that the hand of the\nLORD has gone out against me!\"\nThen they lifted up their voices and\nwept again; and Orpah kissed her\nmother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.\nAnd she said, \"Look, your sister-in-law\nhas gone back to her people and to her\ngods; return after your sister-in-law.\"\nBut Ruth said: \"Entreat me not to leave\nyou, Or to turn back from following after\nyou; For wherever you go, I will go; And\nwherever you lodge, I will lodge; Your\npeople shall be my people, And your\nGod, my God.\nSo Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi,\n\"Please let me go to the field, and glean\nheads of grain after him in whose sight I\nmay find favor.\" And she said to her,\n\"Go, my daughter.\"\nWhere you die, I will die, And there will\nI be buried. The LORD do so to me, and\nmore also, If anything but death parts\nyou and me.\"\nThen she left, and went and gleaned in\nthe field after the reapers. And she\nhappened to come to the part of the field\nbelonging to Boaz, who was of the\nfamily of Elimelech.\nWhen she saw that she was\ndetermined to go with her, she stopped\nspeaking to her.\nNow behold, Boaz came from\nBethlehem, and said to the reapers,\n\"The LORD be with you!\" And they\nanswered him, \"The LORD bless you!\"\nNow the two of them went until they\ncame to Bethlehem. And it happened,\nwhen they had come to Bethlehem, that\nall the city was excited because of them;\nand the women said, \"Is this Naomi?\"\nThen Boaz said to his servant who was\nin charge of the reapers, \"Whose young\nwoman is this?\"\nBut she said to them, \"Do not call me\nNaomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty\nhas dealt very bitterly with me.\nSo the servant who was in charge of\nthe reapers answered and said, \"It is the\nyoung Moabite woman who came back\nwith Naomi from the country of Moab.\nI went out full, and the LORD has\nbrought me home again empty. Why do\nyou call me Naomi, since the LORD has\ntestified against me, and the Almighty\nhas afflicted me?\"\nAnd she said, \"Please let me glean and\ngather after the reapers among the\nsheaves.' So she came and has\ncontinued from morning until now,\nthough she rested a little in the house.\"\nSo Naomi returned, and Ruth the\nMoabitess her daughter-in-law with her,\nwho returned from the country of Moab.\nNow they came to Bethlehem at the\nbeginning of barley harvest.\nThen Boaz said to Ruth, \"You will listen,\nmy daughter, will you not? Do not go to\nglean in another field, nor go from here,\nbut stay close by my young women.\n2There was a relative of Naomi's\nhusband, a man of great wealth, of the\nfamily of Elimelech. His name was Boaz.\nLet your eyes be on the field which they\nreap, and go after them. Have I not\ncommanded the young men not to touch\nyou? And when you are thirsty, go to the\nvessels and drink from what the young\nmen have drawn.\"\nSo she fell on her face, bowed down to\nthe ground, and said to him, \"Why have\nI found favor in your eyes, that you\nshould take notice of me, since I am a\nforeigner?\"\nSo she gleaned in the field until\nevening, and beat out what she had\ngleaned, and it was about an ephah of\nbarley.\nAnd Boaz answered and said to her,\n\"It has been fully reported to me, all that\nyou have done for your mother-in-law\nsince the death of your husband, and\nhow you have left your father and your\nmother and the land of your birth, and\nhave come to a people whom you did\nnot know before.\nThe LORD repay your work, and a full\nreward be given you by the LORD God\nof Israel, under whose wings you have\ncome for refuge.\"\nThen she took it up and went into the\ncity, and her mother-in-law saw what\nshe had gleaned. So she brought out\nand gave to her what she had kept back\nafter she had been satisfied.\nAnd her mother-in-law said to her,\n\"Where have you gleaned today? And\nwhere did you work? Blessed be the\none who took notice of you.\" So she told\nher mother-in-law with whom she had\nworked, and said, \"The man's name with\nwhom I worked today is Boaz.\"\nThen she said, \"Let me find favor in\nyour sight, my lord; for you have\ncomforted me, and have spoken kindly\nto your maidservant, though I am not\nlike one of your maidservants.\"\nThen Naomi said to her daughter-inlaw, \"Blessed be he of the LORD, who\nhas not forsaken His kindness to the\nliving and the dead!\" And Naomi said to\nher, \"This man is a relation of ours, one\nof our close relatives.\"\nNow Boaz said to her at mealtime,\n\"Come here, and eat of the bread, and\ndip your piece of bread in the vinegar.\"\nSo she sat beside the reapers, and he\npassed parched grain to her; and she\nate and was satisfied, and kept some\nback.\nAnd when she rose up to glean, Boaz\ncommanded his young men, saying,\n\"Let her glean even among the sheaves,\nand do not reproach her.\nAlso let grain from the bundles fall\npurposely for her; leave it that she may\nglean, and do not rebuke her.\"\nRuth the Moabitess said, \"He also said\nto me, \"You shall stay close by my\nyoung men until they have finished all\nmy harvest.\"'\nAnd Naomi said to Ruth her daughterin-law, \"It is good, my daughter, that you\ngo out with his young women, and that\npeople do not meet you in any other\nfield.\"\nSo she stayed close by the young\nwomen of Boaz, to glean until the end of\nbarley harvest and wheat harvest; and\nshe dwelt with her mother-in-law.\n3Then Naomi her mother-in-law said\nto her, \"My daughter, shall I not seek\nsecurity for you, that it may be well with\nyou?\nNow Boaz, whose young women you\nwere with, is he not our relative? In fact,\nhe is winnowing barley tonight at the\nthreshing floor.\nTherefore wash yourself and anoint\nyourself, put on your best garment and\ngo down to the threshing floor; but do\nnot make yourself known to the man\nuntil he has finished eating and drinking.\nThen it shall be, when he lies down,\nthat you shall notice the place where he\nlies; and you shall go in, uncover his\nfeet, and lie down; and he will tell you\nwhat you should do.\"\nAnd she said to her, \"All that you say to\nme I will do.\"\nSo she went down to the threshing floor\nand did according to all that her motherin-law instructed her.\nAnd after Boaz had eaten and drunk,\nand his heart was cheerful, he went to\nlie down at the end of the heap of grain;\nand she came softly, uncovered his feet,\nand lay down.\nNow it happened at midnight that the\nman was startled, and turned himself;\nand there, a woman was lying at his feet.\nAnd he said, \"Who are you?\" So she\nanswered, \"I am Ruth, your maidservant.\nTake your maidservant under your wing,\nfor you are a close relative.\"\nThen he said, \"Blessed are you of the\nLORD, my daughter! For you have\nshown more kindness at the end than at\nthe beginning, in that you did not go\nafter young men, whether poor or rich.\nAnd now, my daughter, do not fear. I\nwill do for you all that you request, for all\nthe people of my town know that you are\na virtuous woman.\nNow it is true that I am a close relative;\nhowever, there is a relative closer than I.\nStay this night, and in the morning it\nshall be that if he will perform the duty of\na close relative for you--good; let him do\nit. But if he does not want to perform the\nduty for you, then I will perform the duty\nfor you, as the LORD lives! Lie down\nuntil morning.\"\nSo she lay at his feet until morning,\nand she arose before one could\nrecognize another. Then he said, \"Do\nnot let it be known that the woman came\nto the threshing floor.\"\nAlso he said, \"Bring the shawl that is\non you and hold it.\" And when she held\nit, he measured six ephahs of barley,\nand laid it on her. Then she went into\nthe city.\nWhen she came to her mother-in-law,\nshe said, \"Is that you, my daughter?\"\nThen she told her all that the man had\ndone for her.\nAnd she said, \"These six ephahs of\nbarley he gave me; for he said to me,\n\"Do not go empty-handed to your\nmother-in-law.\"'\nAnd the close relative said, \"I cannot\nredeem it for myself, lest I ruin my own\ninheritance. You redeem my right of\nredemption for yourself, for I cannot\nredeem it.\"\nThen she said, \"Sit still, my daughter,\nuntil you know how the matter will turn\nout; for the man will not rest until he has\nconcluded the matter this day.\"\n4Now Boaz went up to the gate and\nsat down there; and behold, the close\nrelative of whom Boaz had spoken\ncame by. So Boaz said, \"Come aside,\nfriend, sit down here.\" So he came aside\nand sat down.\nAnd he took ten men of the elders of\nthe city, and said, \"Sit down here.\" So\nthey sat down.\nThen he said to the close relative,\n\"Naomi, who has come back from the\ncountry of Moab, sold the piece of land\nwhich belonged to our brother Elimelech.\nAnd I thought to inform you, saying,\n\"Buy it back in the presence of the\ninhabitants and the elders of my people.\nIf you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you\nwill not redeem it, then tell me, that I\nmay know; for there is no one but you to\nredeem it, and I am next after you.\"' And\nhe said, \"I will redeem it.\"\nThen Boaz said, \"On the day you buy\nthe field from the hand of Naomi, you\nmust also buy it from Ruth the\nMoabitess, the wife of the dead, to\nperpetuate the name of the dead\nthrough his inheritance.\"\nNow this was the custom in former\ntimes in Israel concerning redeeming\nand exchanging, to confirm anything:\none man took off his sandal and gave it\nto the other, and this was a confirmation\nin Israel.\nTherefore the close relative said to\nBoaz, \"Buy it for yourself.\" So he took off\nhis sandal.\nAnd Boaz said to the elders and all the\npeople, \"You are witnesses this day that\nI have bought all that was Elimelech's,\nand all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's,\nfrom the hand of Naomi.\nMoreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the\nwidow of Mahlon, I have acquired as my\nwife, to perpetuate the name of the dead\nthrough his inheritance, that the name of\nthe dead may not be cut off from among\nhis brethren and from his position at the\ngate. You are witnesses this day.\"\nAnd all the people who were at the\ngate, and the elders, said, \"We are\nwitnesses. The LORD make the woman\nwho is coming to your house like Rachel\nand Leah, the two who built the house of\nIsrael; and may you prosper in\nEphrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.\nMay your house be like the house of\nPerez, whom Tamar bore to Judah,\nbecause of the offspring which the\nLORD will give you from this young\nwoman.\"\nSo Boaz took Ruth and she became\nhis wife; and when he went in to her, the\nLORD gave her conception, and she\nbore a son.\nAlso the neighbor women gave him a\nname, saying, \"There is a son born to\nNaomi.\" And they called his name Obed.\nHe is the father of Jesse, the father of\nDavid.\nThen the women said to Naomi,\n\"Blessed be the LORD, who has not left\nyou this day without a close relative; and\nmay his name be famous in Israel!\nNow this is the genealogy of Perez:\nPerez begot Hezron;\nAnd may he be to you a restorer of life\nand a nourisher of your old age; for your\ndaughter-in-law, who loves you, who is\nbetter to you than seven sons, has\nborne him.\"\nHezron begot Ram, and Ram begot\nAmminadab;\nAmminadab begot Nahshon,\nNahshon begot Salmon;\nand\nThen Naomi took the child and laid\nhim on her bosom, and became a nurse\nto him.\nSalmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot\nObed;\nObed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot\nDavid.\n1st Samuel\n1Now there was a certain man of\nRamathaim Zophim, of the mountains of\nEphraim, and his name was Elkanah the\nson of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the\nson of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an\nEphraimite.\nAnd he had two wives: the name of one\nwas Hannah, and the name of the other\nPeninnah. Peninnah had children, but\nHannah had no children.\nThis man went up from his city yearly to\nworship and sacrifice to the LORD of\nhosts in Shiloh. Also the two sons of Eli,\nHophni and Phinehas, the priests of the\nLORD, were there.\nAnd whenever the time came for\nElkanah to make an offering, he would\ngive portions to Peninnah his wife and to\nall her sons and daughters.\nBut to Hannah he would give a double\nportion, for he loved Hannah, although\nthe LORD had closed her womb.\nAnd her rival also provoked her\nseverely, to make her miserable,\nbecause the LORD had closed her\nwomb.\nSo it was, year by year, when she went\nup to the house of the LORD, that she\nprovoked her; therefore she wept and\ndid not eat.\nThen Elkanah her husband said to her,\n\"Hannah, why do you weep? Why do\nyou not eat? And why is your heart\ngrieved? Am I not better to you than ten\nsons?\"\nSo Hannah arose after they had\nfinished eating and drinking in Shiloh.\nNow Eli the priest was sitting on the seat\nby the doorpost of the tabernacle of the\nLORD.\nAnd she was in bitterness of soul, and\nprayed to the LORD and wept in\nanguish.\nThen she made a vow and said, \"O\nLORD of hosts, if You will indeed look\non the affliction of Your maidservant and\nremember me, and not forget Your\nmaidservant, but will give Your\nmaidservant a male child, then I will give\nhim to the LORD all the days of his life,\nand no razor shall come upon his head.\"\nAnd it happened, as she continued\npraying before the LORD, that Eli\nwatched her mouth.\nNow Hannah spoke in her heart; only\nher lips moved, but her voice was not\nheard. Therefore Eli thought she was\ndrunk.\nSo Eli said to her, \"How long will you\nbe drunk? Put your wine away from\nyou!\"\nBut Hannah answered and said, \"No,\nmy lord, I am a woman of sorrowful spirit.\nI have drunk neither wine nor\nintoxicating drink, but have poured out\nmy soul before the LORD.\nLORD establish His word.\" Then the\nwoman stayed and nursed her son until\nshe had weaned him.\nDo not consider your maidservant a\nwicked woman, for out of the abundance\nof my complaint and grief I have spoken\nuntil now.\"\nThen Eli answered and said, \"Go in\npeace, and the God of Israel grant your\npetition which you have asked of Him.\"\nNow when she had weaned him, she\ntook him up with her, with three bulls,\none ephah of flour, and a skin of wine,\nand brought him to the house of the\nLORD in Shiloh. And the child was\nyoung.\nThen they slaughtered a bull, and\nbrought the child to Eli.\nAnd she said, \"Let your maidservant\nfind favor in your sight.\" So the woman\nwent her way and ate, and her face was\nno longer sad.\nAnd she said, \"O my lord! As your soul\nlives, my lord, I am the woman who\nstood by you here, praying to the LORD.\nThen they rose early in the morning\nand worshiped before the LORD, and\nreturned and came to their house at\nRamah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his\nwife, and the LORD remembered her.\nSo it came to pass in the process of\ntime that Hannah conceived and bore a\nson, and called his name Samuel,\nsaying, \"Because I have asked for him\nfrom the LORD.\"\nNow the man Elkanah and all his\nhouse went up to offer to the LORD the\nyearly sacrifice and his vow.\nBut Hannah did not go up, for she said\nto her husband, \"Not until the child is\nweaned; then I will take him, that he\nmay appear before the LORD and\nremain there forever.\"\nSo Elkanah her husband said to her,\n\"Do what seems best to you; wait until\nyou have weaned him. Only let the\nFor this child I prayed, and the LORD\nhas granted me my petition which I\nasked of Him.\nTherefore I also have lent him to the\nLORD; as long as he lives he shall be\nlent to the LORD.\" So they worshiped\nthe LORD there.\n2And Hannah prayed and said: \"My\nheart rejoices in the LORD; My horn is\nexalted in the LORD. I smile at my\nenemies, Because I rejoice in Your\nsalvation.\n\"No one is holy like the LORD, For\nthere is none besides You, Nor is there\nany rock like our God.\n\"Talk no more so very proudly; Let no\narrogance come from your mouth, For\nthe LORD is the God of knowledge; And\nby Him actions are weighed.\n\"The bows of the mighty men are\nbroken, And those who stumbled are\ngirded with strength.\nThose who were full have hired\nthemselves out for bread, And the\nhungry have ceased to hunger. Even\nthe barren has borne seven, And she\nwho has many children has become\nfeeble.\n\"The LORD kills and makes alive; He\nbrings down to the grave and brings up.\nThe LORD makes poor and makes rich;\nHe brings low and lifts up.\nHe raises the poor from the dust And\nlifts the beggar from the ash heap, To\nset them among princes And make them\ninherit the throne of glory. \"For the\npillars of the earth are the LORD's, And\nHe has set the world upon them.\nHe will guard the feet of His saints, But\nthe wicked shall be silent in darkness.\n\"For by strength no man shall prevail.\nThe adversaries of the LORD shall be\nbroken in pieces; From heaven He will\nthunder against them. The LORD will\njudge the ends of the earth. \"He will give\nstrength to His king, And exalt the horn\nof His anointed.\"\nAnd the priests' custom with the\npeople was that when any man offered\na sacrifice, the priest's servant would\ncome with a three-pronged fleshhook in\nhis hand while the meat was boiling.\nThen he would thrust it into the pan, or\nkettle, or caldron, or pot; and the priest\nwould take for himself all that the\nfleshhook brought up. So they did in\nShiloh to all the Israelites who came\nthere.\nAlso, before they burned the fat, the\npriest's servant would come and say to\nthe man who sacrificed, \"Give meat for\nroasting to the priest, for he will not take\nboiled meat from you, but raw.\"\nAnd if the man said to him, \"They\nshould really burn the fat first; then you\nmay take as much as your heart\ndesires,\" he would then answer him, \"No,\nbut you must give it now; and if not, I will\ntake it by force.\"\nTherefore the sin of the young men\nwas very great before the LORD, for\nmen abhorred the offering of the LORD.\nBut Samuel ministered before the\nLORD, even as a child, wearing a linen\nephod.\nThen Elkanah went to his house at\nRamah. But the child ministered to the\nLORD before Eli the priest.\nMoreover his mother used to make\nhim a little robe, and bring it to him year\nby year when she came up with her\nhusband to offer the yearly sacrifice.\nNow the sons of Eli were corrupt; they\ndid not know the LORD.\nAnd Eli would bless Elkanah and his\nwife, and say, \"The LORD give you\ndescendants from this woman for the\nloan that was given to the LORD.\" Then\nthey would go to their own home.\ngive to the house of your father all the\nofferings of the children of Israel made\nby fire?\nAnd the LORD visited Hannah, so that\nshe conceived and bore three sons and\ntwo daughters. Meanwhile the child\nSamuel grew before the LORD.\nNow Eli was very old; and he heard\neverything his sons did to all Israel, and\nhow they lay with the women who\nassembled at the door of the tabernacle\nof meeting.\nSo he said to them, \"Why do you do\nsuch things? For I hear of your evil\ndealings from all the people.\nWhy do you kick at My sacrifice and\nMy offering which I have commanded in\nMy dwelling place, and honor your sons\nmore than Me, to make yourselves fat\nwith the best of all the offerings of Israel\nMy people?'\nTherefore the LORD God of Israel\nsays: \"I said indeed that your house and\nthe house of your father would walk\nbefore Me forever.' But now the LORD\nsays: \"Far be it from Me; for those who\nhonor Me I will honor, and those who\ndespise Me shall be lightly esteemed.\nNo, my sons! For it is not a good\nreport that I hear. You make the LORD's\npeople transgress.\nIf one man sins against another, God\nwill judge him. But if a man sins against\nthe LORD, who will intercede for him?\"\nNevertheless they did not heed the\nvoice of their father, because the LORD\ndesired to kill them.\nBehold, the days are coming that I will\ncut off your arm and the arm of your\nfather's house, so that there will not be\nan old man in your house.\nAnd you will see an enemy in My\ndwelling place, despite all the good\nwhich God does for Israel. And there\nshall not be an old man in your house\nforever.\nAnd the child Samuel grew in stature,\nand in favor both with the LORD and\nmen.\nThen a man of God came to Eli and\nsaid to him, \"Thus says the LORD: \"Did I\nnot clearly reveal Myself to the house of\nyour father when they were in Egypt in\nPharaoh's house?\nDid I not choose him out of all the\ntribes of Israel to be My priest, to offer\nupon My altar, to burn incense, and to\nwear an ephod before Me? And did I not\nBut any of your men whom I do not cut\noff from My altar shall consume your\neyes and grieve your heart. And all the\ndescendants of your house shall die in\nthe flower of their age.\nNow this shall be a sign to you that will\ncome upon your two sons, on Hophni\nand Phinehas: in one day they shall die,\nboth of them.\nThen I will raise up for Myself a faithful\npriest who shall do according to what is\nin My heart and in My mind. I will build\nhim a sure house, and he shall walk\nbefore My anointed forever.\n(Now Samuel did not yet know the\nLORD, nor was the word of the LORD\nyet revealed to him.)\nAnd it shall come to pass that\neveryone who is left in your house will\ncome and bow down to him for a piece\nof silver and a morsel of bread, and say,\n\"Please, put me in one of the priestly\npositions, that I may eat a piece of\nbread.\"\"'\n3Now the boy Samuel ministered to\nthe LORD before Eli. And the word of\nthe LORD was rare in those days; there\nwas no widespread revelation.\nAnd it came to pass at that time, while\nEli was lying down in his place, and\nwhen his eyes had begun to grow so\ndim that he could not see,\nand before the lamp of God went out in\nthe tabernacle of the LORD where the\nark of God was, and while Samuel was\nlying down,\nthat the LORD called Samuel. And he\nanswered, \"Here I am!\"\nSo he ran to Eli and said, \"Here I am,\nfor you called me.\" And he said, \"I did\nnot call; lie down again.\" And he went\nand lay down.\nThen the LORD called yet again,\n\"Samuel!\" So Samuel arose and went to\nEli, and said, \"Here I am, for you called\nme.\" He answered, \"I did not call, my\nson; lie down again.\"\nAnd the LORD called Samuel again the\nthird time. So he arose and went to Eli,\nand said, \"Here I am, for you did call\nme.\" Then Eli perceived that the LORD\nhad called the boy.\nTherefore Eli said to Samuel, \"Go, lie\ndown; and it shall be, if He calls you,\nthat you must say, \"Speak, LORD, for\nYour servant hears.\"' So Samuel went\nand lay down in his place.\nNow the LORD came and stood and\ncalled as at other times, \"Samuel!\nSamuel!\" And Samuel answered,\n\"Speak, for Your servant hears.\"\nThen the LORD said to Samuel:\n\"Behold, I will do something in Israel at\nwhich both ears of everyone who hears\nit will tingle.\nIn that day I will perform against Eli all\nthat I have spoken concerning his house,\nfrom beginning to end.\nFor I have told him that I will judge his\nhouse forever for the iniquity which he\nknows, because his sons made\nthemselves vile, and he did not restrain\nthem.\nAnd therefore I have sworn to the\nhouse of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's\nhouse shall not be atoned for by\nsacrifice or offering forever.\"\nSo Samuel lay down until morning,\nand opened the doors of the house of\nthe LORD. And Samuel was afraid to tell\nEli the vision.\nThen Eli called Samuel and said,\n\"Samuel, my son!\" He answered, \"Here I\nam.\"\nAnd he said, \"What is the word that the\nLORD spoke to you? Please do not hide\nit from me. God do so to you, and more\nalso, if you hide anything from me of all\nthe things that He said to you.\"\nThen Samuel told him everything, and\nhid nothing from him. And he said, \"It is\nthe LORD. Let Him do what seems good\nto Him.\"\nSo Samuel grew, and the LORD was\nwith him and let none of his words fall to\nthe ground.\nAnd all Israel from Dan to Beersheba\nknew that Samuel had been established\nas a prophet of the LORD.\nThen the LORD appeared again in\nShiloh. For the LORD revealed Himself\nto Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the\nLORD.\n4And the word of Samuel came to all\nIsrael. Now Israel went out to battle\nagainst the Philistines, and encamped\nbeside Ebenezer; and the Philistines\nencamped in Aphek.\nAnd when the people had come into the\ncamp, the elders of Israel said, \"Why\nhas the LORD defeated us today before\nthe Philistines? Let us bring the ark of\nthe covenant of the LORD from Shiloh\nto us, that when it comes among us it\nmay save us from the hand of our\nenemies.\"\nSo the people sent to Shiloh, that they\nmight bring from there the ark of the\ncovenant of the LORD of hosts, who\ndwells between the cherubim. And the\ntwo sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas,\nwere there with the ark of the covenant\nof God.\nAnd when the ark of the covenant of\nthe LORD came into the camp, all Israel\nshouted so loudly that the earth shook.\nNow when the Philistines heard the\nnoise of the shout, they said, \"What\ndoes the sound of this great shout in the\ncamp of the Hebrews mean?\" Then they\nunderstood that the ark of the LORD\nhad come into the camp.\nSo the Philistines were afraid, for they\nsaid, \"God has come into the camp!\"\nAnd they said, \"Woe to us! For such a\nthing has never happened before.\nWoe to us! Who will deliver us from the\nhand of these mighty gods? These are\nthe gods who struck the Egyptians with\nall the plagues in the wilderness.\nThen the Philistines put themselves in\nbattle array against Israel. And when\nthey joined battle, Israel was defeated\nby the Philistines, who killed about four\nthousand men of the army in the field.\nBe strong and conduct yourselves like\nmen, you Philistines, that you do not\nbecome servants of the Hebrews, as\nthey have been to you. Conduct\nyourselves like men, and fight!\"\nSo the Philistines fought, and Israel\nwas defeated, and every man fled to his\ntent. There was a very great slaughter,\nand there fell of Israel thirty thousand\nfoot soldiers.\nThen it happened, when he made\nmention of the ark of God, that Eli fell off\nthe seat backward by the side of the\ngate; and his neck was broken and he\ndied, for the man was old and heavy.\nAnd he had judged Israel forty years.\nAlso the ark of God was captured; and\nthe two sons of Eli, Hophni and\nPhinehas, died.\nThen a man of Benjamin ran from the\nbattle line the same day, and came to\nShiloh with his clothes torn and dirt on\nhis head.\nNow his daughter-in-law, Phinehas'\nwife, was with child, due to be delivered;\nand when she heard the news that the\nark of God was captured, and that her\nfather-in-law and her husband were\ndead, she bowed herself and gave birth,\nfor her labor pains came upon her.\nNow when he came, there was Eli,\nsitting on a seat by the wayside\nwatching, for his heart trembled for the\nark of God. And when the man came\ninto the city and told it, all the city cried\nout.\nAnd about the time of her death the\nwomen who stood by her said to her,\n\"Do not fear, for you have borne a son.\"\nBut she did not answer, nor did she\nregard it.\nWhen Eli heard the noise of the outcry,\nhe said, \"What does the sound of this\ntumult mean?\" And the man came\nquickly and told Eli.\nThen she named the child Ichabod,\nsaying, \"The glory has departed from\nIsrael!\" because the ark of God had\nbeen captured and because of her\nfather-in-law and her husband.\nEli was ninety-eight years old, and his\neyes were so dim that he could not see.\nAnd she said, \"The glory has departed\nfrom Israel, for the ark of God has been\ncaptured.\"\nThen the man said to Eli, \"I am he who\ncame from the battle. And I fled today\nfrom the battle line.\" And he said, \"What\nhappened, my son?\"\nSo the messenger answered and said,\n\"Israel has fled before the Philistines,\nand there has been a great slaughter\namong the people. Also your two sons,\nHophni and Phinehas, are dead; and the\nark of God has been captured.\"\n5Then the Philistines took the ark of\nGod and brought it from Ebenezer to\nAshdod.\nWhen the Philistines took the ark of\nGod, they brought it into the house of\nDagon and set it by Dagon.\nAnd when the people of Ashdod arose\nearly in the morning, there was Dagon,\nfallen on its face to the earth before the\nark of the LORD. So they took Dagon\nand set it in its place again.\nAnd when they arose early the next\nmorning, there was Dagon, fallen on its\nface to the ground before the ark of the\nLORD. The head of Dagon and both the\npalms of its hands were broken off on\nthe threshold; only Dagon's torso was\nleft of it.\nTherefore they sent the ark of God to\nEkron. So it was, as the ark of God\ncame to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried\nout, saying, \"They have brought the ark\nof the God of Israel to us, to kill us and\nour people!\"\nTherefore neither the priests of Dagon\nnor any who come into Dagon's house\ntread on the threshold of Dagon in\nAshdod to this day.\nSo they sent and gathered together all\nthe lords of the Philistines, and said,\n\"Send away the ark of the God of Israel,\nand let it go back to its own place, so\nthat it does not kill us and our people.\"\nFor there was a deadly destruction\nthroughout all the city; the hand of God\nwas very heavy there.\nBut the hand of the LORD was heavy\non the people of Ashdod, and He\nravaged them and struck them with\ntumors, both Ashdod and its territory.\nAnd when the men of Ashdod saw how\nit was, they said, \"The ark of the God of\nIsrael must not remain with us, for His\nhand is harsh toward us and Dagon our\ngod.\"\nTherefore they sent and gathered to\nthemselves all the lords of the\nPhilistines, and said, \"What shall we do\nwith the ark of the God of Israel?\" And\nthey answered, \"Let the ark of the God\nof Israel be carried away to Gath.\" So\nthey carried the ark of the God of Israel\naway.\nSo it was, after they had carried it away,\nthat the hand of the LORD was against\nthe city with a very great destruction;\nand He struck the men of the city, both\nsmall and great, and tumors broke out\non them.\nAnd the men who did not die were\nstricken with the tumors, and the cry of\nthe city went up to heaven.\n6Now the ark of the LORD was in the\ncountry of the Philistines seven months.\nAnd the Philistines called for the priests\nand the diviners, saying, \"What shall we\ndo with the ark of the LORD? Tell us\nhow we should send it to its place.\"\nSo they said, \"If you send away the ark\nof the God of Israel, do not send it\nempty; but by all means return it to Him\nwith a trespass offering. Then you will\nbe healed, and it will be known to you\nwhy His hand is not removed from you.\"\nThen they said, \"What is the trespass\noffering which we shall return to Him?\"\nThey answered, \"Five golden tumors\nand five golden rats, according to the\nnumber of the lords of the Philistines.\nFor the same plague was on all of you\nand on your lords.\nTherefore you shall make images of\nyour tumors and images of your rats that\nravage the land, and you shall give glory\nto the God of Israel; perhaps He will\nlighten His hand from you, from your\ngods, and from your land.\nWhy then do you harden your hearts as\nthe Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened\ntheir hearts? When He did mighty things\namong them, did they not let the people\ngo, that they might depart?\nNow therefore, make a new cart, take\ntwo milk cows which have never been\nyoked, and hitch the cows to the cart;\nand take their calves home, away from\nthem.\nThen take the ark of the LORD and set\nit on the cart; and put the articles of gold\nwhich you are returning to Him as a\ntrespass offering in a chest by its side.\nThen send it away, and let it go.\ndid not turn aside to the right hand or\nthe left. And the lords of the Philistines\nwent after them to the border of Beth\nShemesh.\nNow the people of Beth Shemesh\nwere reaping their wheat harvest in the\nvalley; and they lifted their eyes and saw\nthe ark, and rejoiced to see it.\nThen the cart came into the field of\nJoshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood\nthere; a large stone was there. So they\nsplit the wood of the cart and offered the\ncows as a burnt offering to the LORD.\nThe Levites took down the ark of the\nLORD and the chest that was with it, in\nwhich were the articles of gold, and put\nthem on the large stone. Then the men\nof Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings\nand made sacrifices the same day to the\nLORD.\nAnd watch: if it goes up the road to its\nown territory, to Beth Shemesh, then He\nhas done us this great evil. But if not,\nthen we shall know that it is not His\nhand that struck us--it happened to us\nby chance.\"\nThen the men did so; they took two\nmilk cows and hitched them to the cart,\nand shut up their calves at home.\nAnd they set the ark of the LORD on\nthe cart, and the chest with the gold rats\nand the images of their tumors.\nThen the cows headed straight for the\nroad to Beth Shemesh, and went along\nthe highway, lowing as they went, and\nSo when the five lords of the\nPhilistines had seen it, they returned to\nEkron the same day.\nThese are the golden tumors which\nthe Philistines returned as a trespass\noffering to the LORD: one for Ashdod,\none for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for\nGath, one for Ekron;\nand the golden rats, according to the\nnumber of all the cities of the Philistines\nbelonging to the five lords, both fortified\ncities and country villages, even as far\nas the large stone of Abel on which they\nset the ark of the LORD, which stone\nremains to this day in the field of Joshua\nof Beth Shemesh.\nThen He struck the men of Beth\nShemesh, because they had looked into\nthe ark of the LORD. He struck fifty\nthousand and seventy men of the\npeople, and the people lamented\nbecause the LORD had struck the\npeople with a great slaughter.\nAnd the men of Beth Shemesh said,\n\"Who is able to stand before this holy\nLORD God? And to whom shall it go up\nfrom us?\"\nSo they sent messengers to the\ninhabitants of Kirjath Jearim, saying,\n\"The Philistines have brought back the\nark of the LORD; come down and take it\nup with you.\"\nAnd Samuel said, \"Gather all Israel to\nMizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for\nyou.\"\nSo they gathered together at Mizpah,\ndrew water, and poured it out before the\nLORD. And they fasted that day, and\nsaid there, \"We have sinned against the\nLORD.\" And Samuel judged the children\nof Israel at Mizpah.\nNow when the Philistines heard that the\nchildren of Israel had gathered together\nat Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines\nwent up against Israel. And when the\nchildren of Israel heard of it, they were\nafraid of the Philistines.\n7Then the men of Kirjath Jearim came\nand took the ark of the LORD, and\nbrought it into the house of Abinadab on\nthe hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son\nto keep the ark of the LORD.\nSo it was that the ark remained in\nKirjath Jearim a long time; it was there\ntwenty years. And all the house of Israel\nlamented after the LORD.\nThen Samuel spoke to all the house of\nIsrael, saying, \"If you return to the LORD\nwith all your hearts, then put away the\nforeign gods and the Ashtoreths from\namong you, and prepare your hearts for\nthe LORD, and serve Him only; and He\nwill deliver you from the hand of the\nPhilistines.\"\nSo the children of Israel put away the\nBaals and the Ashtoreths, and served\nthe LORD only.\nSo the children of Israel said to Samuel,\n\"Do not cease to cry out to the LORD\nour God for us, that He may save us\nfrom the hand of the Philistines.\"\nAnd Samuel took a suckling lamb and\noffered it as a whole burnt offering to the\nLORD. Then Samuel cried out to the\nLORD for Israel, and the LORD\nanswered him.\nNow as Samuel was offering up the\nburnt offering, the Philistines drew near\nto battle against Israel. But the LORD\nthundered with a loud thunder upon the\nPhilistines that day, and so confused\nthem that they were overcome before\nIsrael.\nAnd the men of Israel went out of\nMizpah and pursued the Philistines, and\ndrove them back as far as below Beth\nCar.\nThen Samuel took a stone and set it\nup between Mizpah and Shen, and\ncalled its name Ebenezer, saying, \"Thus\nfar the LORD has helped us.\"\nSo the Philistines were subdued, and\nthey did not come anymore into the\nterritory of Israel. And the hand of the\nLORD was against the Philistines all the\ndays of Samuel.\nThen all the elders of Israel gathered\ntogether and came to Samuel at Ramah,\nand said to him, \"Look, you are old, and\nyour sons do not walk in your ways.\nNow make us a king to judge us like all\nthe nations.\"\nBut the thing displeased Samuel when\nthey said, \"Give us a king to judge us.\"\nSo Samuel prayed to the LORD.\nThen the cities which the Philistines\nhad taken from Israel were restored to\nIsrael, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel\nrecovered its territory from the hands of\nthe Philistines. Also there was peace\nbetween Israel and the Amorites.\nAnd the LORD said to Samuel, \"Heed\nthe voice of the people in all that they\nsay to you; for they have not rejected\nyou, but they have rejected Me, that I\nshould not reign over them.\nAnd Samuel judged Israel all the days\nof his life.\nHe went from year to year on a circuit\nto Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and\njudged Israel in all those places.\nAccording to all the works which they\nhave done since the day that I brought\nthem up out of Egypt, even to this day-with which they have forsaken Me and\nserved other gods--so they are doing to\nyou also.\nBut he always returned to Ramah, for\nhis home was there. There he judged\nIsrael, and there he built an altar to the\nLORD.\nNow therefore, heed their voice.\nHowever, you shall solemnly forewarn\nthem, and show them the behavior of\nthe king who will reign over them.\"\n8Now it came to pass when Samuel\nwas old that he made his sons judges\nover Israel.\nThe name of his firstborn was Joel, and\nthe name of his second, Abijah; they\nwere judges in Beersheba.\nBut his sons did not walk in his ways;\nthey turned aside after dishonest gain,\ntook bribes, and perverted justice.\nSo Samuel told all the words of the\nLORD to the people who asked him for\na king.\nAnd he said, \"This will be the behavior\nof the king who will reign over you: He\nwill take your sons and appoint them for\nhis own chariots and to be his horsemen,\nand some will run before his chariots.\nHe will appoint captains over his\nthousands and captains over his fifties,\nwill set some to plow his ground and\nreap his harvest, and some to make his\nweapons of war and equipment for his\nchariots.\nSamuel said to the men of Israel, \"Every\nman go to his city.\"\n9There was a man of Benjamin whose\nname was Kish the son of Abiel, the son\nof Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son\nof Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of\npower.\nHe will take your daughters to be\nperfumers, cooks, and bakers.\nAnd he will take the best of your fields,\nyour vineyards, and your olive groves,\nand give them to his servants.\nHe will take a tenth of your grain and\nyour vintage, and give it to his officers\nand servants.\nAnd he will take your male servants,\nyour female servants, your finest young\nmen, and your donkeys, and put them to\nhis work.\nAnd he had a choice and handsome\nson whose name was Saul. There was\nnot a more handsome person than he\namong the children of Israel. From his\nshoulders upward he was taller than any\nof the people.\nHe will take a tenth of your sheep. And\nyou will be his servants.\nNow the donkeys of Kish, Saul's father,\nwere lost. And Kish said to his son Saul,\n\"Please take one of the servants with\nyou, and arise, go and look for the\ndonkeys.\"\nAnd you will cry out in that day\nbecause of your king whom you have\nchosen for yourselves, and the LORD\nwill not hear you in that day.\"\nNevertheless the people refused to\nobey the voice of Samuel; and they said,\n\"No, but we will have a king over us,\nthat we also may be like all the nations,\nand that our king may judge us and go\nout before us and fight our battles.\"\nSo he passed through the mountains of\nEphraim and through the land of\nShalisha, but they did not find them.\nThen they passed through the land of\nShaalim, and they were not there. Then\nhe passed through the land of the\nBenjamites, but they did not find them.\nWhen they had come to the land of\nZuph, Saul said to his servant who was\nwith him, \"Come, let us return, lest my\nfather cease caring about the donkeys\nand become worried about us.\"\nAnd Samuel heard all the words of the\npeople, and he repeated them in the\nhearing of the LORD.\nSo the LORD said to Samuel, \"Heed\ntheir voice, and make them a king.\" And\nAnd he said to him, \"Look now, there is\nin this city a man of God, and he is an\nhonorable man; all that he says surely\ncomes to pass. So let us go there;\nperhaps he can show us the way that\nwe should go.\"\nThen Saul said to his servant, \"But look,\nif we go, what shall we bring the man?\nFor the bread in our vessels is all gone,\nand there is no present to bring to the\nman of God. What do we have?\"\nSamuel, coming out toward them on his\nway up to the high place.\nAnd the servant answered Saul again\nand said, \"Look, I have here at hand\none-fourth of a shekel of silver. I will\ngive that to the man of God, to tell us\nour way.\"\n(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to\ninquire of God, he spoke thus: \"Come,\nlet us go to the seer\"; for he who is now\ncalled a prophet was formerly called a\nseer.)\nThen Saul said to his servant, \"Well\nsaid; come, let us go.\" So they went to\nthe city where the man of God was.\nAs they went up the hill to the city,\nthey met some young women going out\nto draw water, and said to them, \"Is the\nseer here?\"\nAnd they answered them and said,\n\"Yes, there he is, just ahead of you.\nHurry now; for today he came to this city,\nbecause there is a sacrifice of the\npeople today on the high place.\nAs soon as you come into the city, you\nwill surely find him before he goes up to\nthe high place to eat. For the people will\nnot eat until he comes, because he must\nbless the sacrifice; afterward those who\nare invited will eat. Now therefore, go up,\nfor about this time you will find him.\"\nSo they went up to the city. As they\nwere coming into the city, there was\nNow the LORD had told Samuel in his\near the day before Saul came, saying,\n\"Tomorrow about this time I will send\nyou a man from the land of Benjamin,\nand you shall anoint him commander\nover My people Israel, that he may save\nMy people from the hand of the\nPhilistines; for I have looked upon My\npeople, because their cry has come to\nMe.\"\nSo when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD\nsaid to him, \"There he is, the man of\nwhom I spoke to you. This one shall\nreign over My people.\"\nThen Saul drew near to Samuel in the\ngate, and said, \"Please tell me, where is\nthe seer's house?\"\nSamuel answered Saul and said, \"I am\nthe seer. Go up before me to the high\nplace, for you shall eat with me today;\nand tomorrow I will let you go and will\ntell you all that is in your heart.\nBut as for your donkeys that were lost\nthree days ago, do not be anxious about\nthem, for they have been found. And on\nwhom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not\non you and on all your father's house?\"\nAnd Saul answered and said, \"Am I\nnot a Benjamite, of the smallest of the\ntribes of Israel, and my family the least\nof all the families of the tribe of\nBenjamin? Why then do you speak like\nthis to me?\"\nNow Samuel took Saul and his servant\nand brought them into the hall, and had\nthem sit in the place of honor among\nthose who were invited; there were\nabout thirty persons.\nAnd Samuel said to the cook, \"Bring\nthe portion which I gave you, of which I\nsaid to you, \"Set it apart.\"'\nWhen you have departed from me\ntoday, you will find two men by Rachel's\ntomb in the territory of Benjamin at\nZelzah; and they will say to you, \"The\ndonkeys which you went to look for have\nbeen found. And now your father has\nceased caring about the donkeys and is\nworrying about you, saying, \"What shall\nI do about my son?\"'\nSo the cook took up the thigh with its\nupper part and set it before Saul. And\nSamuel said, \"Here it is, what was kept\nback. It was set apart for you. Eat; for\nuntil this time it has been kept for you,\nsince I said I invited the people.\" So\nSaul ate with Samuel that day.\nThen you shall go on forward from\nthere and come to the terebinth tree of\nTabor. There three men going up to God\nat Bethel will meet you, one carrying\nthree young goats, another carrying\nthree loaves of bread, and another\ncarrying a skin of wine.\nWhen they had come down from the\nhigh place into the city, Samuel spoke\nwith Saul on the top of the house.\nAnd they will greet you and give you\ntwo loaves of bread, which you shall\nreceive from their hands.\nThey arose early; and it was about the\ndawning of the day that Samuel called\nto Saul on the top of the house, saying,\n\"Get up, that I may send you on your\nway.\" And Saul arose, and both of them\nwent outside, he and Samuel.\nAs they were going down to the\noutskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul,\n\"Tell the servant to go on ahead of us.\"\nAnd he went on. \"But you stand here\nawhile, that I may announce to you the\nword of God.\"\n10Then Samuel took a flask of oil\nand poured it on his head, and kissed\nhim and said: \"Is it not because the\nLORD has anointed you commander\nover His inheritance?\nAfter that you shall come to the hill of\nGod where the Philistine garrison is.\nAnd it will happen, when you have come\nthere to the city, that you will meet a\ngroup of prophets coming down from the\nhigh place with a stringed instrument, a\ntambourine, a flute, and a harp before\nthem; and they will be prophesying.\nThen the Spirit of the LORD will come\nupon you, and you will prophesy with\nthem and be turned into another man.\nAnd let it be, when these signs come to\nyou, that you do as the occasion\ndemands; for God is with you.\nYou shall go down before me to Gilgal;\nand surely I will come down to you to\noffer burnt offerings and make sacrifices\nof peace offerings. Seven days you shall\nwait, till I come to you and show you\nwhat you should do.\"\nThen Samuel called the people\ntogether to the LORD at Mizpah,\nSo it was, when he had turned his back\nto go from Samuel, that God gave him\nanother heart; and all those signs came\nto pass that day.\nWhen they came there to the hill, there\nwas a group of prophets to meet him;\nthen the Spirit of God came upon him,\nand he prophesied among them.\nAnd it happened, when all who knew\nhim formerly saw that he indeed\nprophesied among the prophets, that\nthe people said to one another, \"What is\nthis that has come upon the son of\nKish? Is Saul also among the\nprophets?\"\nThen a man from there answered and\nsaid, \"But who is their father?\" Therefore\nit became a proverb: \"Is Saul also\namong the prophets?\"\nAnd when he had finished prophesying,\nhe went to the high place.\nand said to the children of Israel,\n\"Thus says the LORD God of Israel: \"I\nbrought up Israel out of Egypt, and\ndelivered you from the hand of the\nEgyptians and from the hand of all\nkingdoms and from those who\noppressed you.'\nBut you have today rejected your God,\nwho Himself saved you from all your\nadversities and your tribulations; and\nyou have said to Him, \"No, set a king\nover us!' Now therefore, present\nyourselves before the LORD by your\ntribes and by your clans.\"\nAnd when Samuel had caused all the\ntribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of\nBenjamin was chosen.\nWhen he had caused the tribe of\nBenjamin to come near by their families,\nthe family of Matri was chosen. And\nSaul the son of Kish was chosen. But\nwhen they sought him, he could not be\nfound.\nThen Saul's uncle said to him and his\nservant, \"Where did you go?\" So he said,\n\"To look for the donkeys. When we saw\nthat they were nowhere to be found, we\nwent to Samuel.\"\nTherefore they inquired of the LORD\nfurther, \"Has the man come here yet?\"\nAnd the LORD answered, \"There he is,\nhidden among the equipment.\"\nAnd Saul's uncle said, \"Tell me, please,\nwhat Samuel said to you.\"\nSo Saul said to his uncle, \"He told us\nplainly that the donkeys had been\nfound.\" But about the matter of the\nkingdom, he did not tell him what\nSamuel had said.\nSo they ran and brought him from\nthere; and when he stood among the\npeople, he was taller than any of the\npeople from his shoulders upward.\nAnd Samuel said to all the people, \"Do\nyou see him whom the LORD has\nchosen, that there is no one like him\namong all the people?\" So all the people\nshouted and said, \"Long live the king!\"\nThen Samuel explained to the people\nthe behavior of royalty, and wrote it in a\nbook and laid it up before the LORD.\nAnd Samuel sent all the people away,\nevery man to his house.\nNow there was Saul, coming behind the\nherd from the field; and Saul said, \"What\ntroubles the people, that they weep?\"\nAnd they told him the words of the men\nof Jabesh.\nThen the Spirit of God came upon Saul\nwhen he heard this news, and his anger\nwas greatly aroused.\nAnd Saul also went home to Gibeah;\nand valiant men went with him, whose\nhearts God had touched.\nBut some rebels said, \"How can this\nman save us?\" So they despised him,\nand brought him no presents. But he\nheld his peace.\n11Then Nahash the Ammonite came\nup and encamped against Jabesh\nGilead; and all the men of Jabesh said\nto Nahash, \"Make a covenant with us,\nand we will serve you.\"\nAnd Nahash the Ammonite answered\nthem, \"On this condition I will make a\ncovenant with you, that I may put out all\nyour right eyes, and bring reproach on\nall Israel.\"\nThen the elders of Jabesh said to him,\n\"Hold off for seven days, that we may\nsend messengers to all the territory of\nIsrael. And then, if there is no one to\nsave us, we will come out to you.\"\nSo the messengers came to Gibeah of\nSaul and told the news in the hearing of\nthe people. And all the people lifted up\ntheir voices and wept.\nSo he took a yoke of oxen and cut them\nin pieces, and sent them throughout all\nthe territory of Israel by the hands of\nmessengers, saying, \"Whoever does not\ngo out with Saul and Samuel to battle,\nso it shall be done to his oxen.\" And the\nfear of the LORD fell on the people, and\nthey came out with one consent.\nWhen he numbered them in Bezek, the\nchildren of Israel were three hundred\nthousand, and the men of Judah thirty\nthousand.\nAnd they said to the messengers who\ncame, \"Thus you shall say to the men of\nJabesh Gilead: \"Tomorrow, by the time\nthe sun is hot, you shall have help.\"'\nThen the messengers came and\nreported it to the men of Jabesh, and\nthey were glad.\nTherefore the men of Jabesh said,\n\"Tomorrow we will come out to you, and\nyou may do with us whatever seems\ngood to you.\"\nSo it was, on the next day, that Saul\nput the people in three companies; and\nthey came into the midst of the camp in\nthe\nmorning\nwatch,\nand\nkilled\nAmmonites until the heat of the day.\nAnd it happened that those who\nsurvived were scattered, so that no two\nof them were left together.\nAnd they said, \"You have not cheated\nus or oppressed us, nor have you taken\nanything from any man's hand.\"\nThen the people said to Samuel, \"Who\nis he who said, \"Shall Saul reign over\nus?' Bring the men, that we may put\nthem to death.\"\nBut Saul said, \"Not a man shall be put\nto death this day, for today the LORD\nhas accomplished salvation in Israel.\"\nThen Samuel said to the people,\n\"Come, let us go to Gilgal and renew the\nkingdom there.\"\nSo all the people went to Gilgal, and\nthere they made Saul king before the\nLORD in Gilgal. There they made\nsacrifices of peace offerings before the\nLORD, and there Saul and all the men\nof Israel rejoiced greatly.\n12Now Samuel said to all Israel:\n\"Indeed I have heeded your voice in all\nthat you said to me, and have made a\nking over you.\nAnd now here is the king, walking\nbefore you; and I am old and\ngrayheaded, and look, my sons are with\nyou. I have walked before you from my\nchildhood to this day.\nHere I am. Witness against me before\nthe LORD and before His anointed:\nWhose ox have I taken, or whose\ndonkey have I taken, or whom have I\ncheated? Whom have I oppressed, or\nfrom whose hand have I received any\nbribe with which to blind my eyes? I will\nrestore it to you.\"\nThen he said to them, \"The LORD is\nwitness against you, and His anointed is\nwitness this day, that you have not\nfound anything in my hand.\" And they\nanswered, \"He is witness.\"\nThen Samuel said to the people, \"It is\nthe LORD who raised up Moses and\nAaron, and who brought your fathers up\nfrom the land of Egypt.\nNow therefore, stand still, that I may\nreason with you before the LORD\nconcerning all the righteous acts of the\nLORD which He did to you and your\nfathers:\nWhen Jacob had gone into Egypt, and\nyour fathers cried out to the LORD, then\nthe LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who\nbrought your fathers out of Egypt and\nmade them dwell in this place.\nAnd when they forgot the LORD their\nGod, He sold them into the hand of\nSisera, commander of the army of\nHazor, into the hand of the Philistines,\nand into the hand of the king of Moab;\nand they fought against them.\nThen they cried out to the LORD, and\nsaid, \"We have sinned, because we\nhave forsaken the LORD and served the\nBaals and Ashtoreths; but now deliver\nus from the hand of our enemies, and\nwe will serve You.'\nAnd the LORD sent Jerubbaal, Bedan,\nJephthah, and Samuel, and delivered\nyou out of the hand of your enemies on\nevery side; and you dwelt in safety.\nAnd when you saw that Nahash king\nof the Ammonites came against you,\nyou said to me, \"No, but a king shall\nreign over us,' when the LORD your\nGod was your king.\n\"Now therefore, here is the king whom\nyou have chosen and whom you have\ndesired. And take note, the LORD has\nset a king over you.\nIf you fear the LORD and serve Him\nand obey His voice, and do not rebel\nagainst the commandment of the LORD,\nthen both you and the king who reigns\nover you will continue following the\nLORD your God.\nAnd all the people said to Samuel,\n\"Pray for your servants to the LORD\nyour God, that we may not die; for we\nhave added to all our sins the evil of\nasking a king for ourselves.\"\nThen Samuel said to the people, \"Do\nnot fear. You have done all this\nwickedness; yet do not turn aside from\nfollowing the LORD, but serve the\nLORD with all your heart.\nAnd do not turn aside; for then you\nwould go after empty things which\ncannot profit or deliver, for they are\nnothing.\nFor the LORD will not forsake His\npeople, for His great name's sake,\nbecause it has pleased the LORD to\nmake you His people.\nHowever, if you do not obey the voice\nof the LORD, but rebel against the\ncommandment of the LORD, then the\nhand of the LORD will be against you,\nas it was against your fathers.\nMoreover, as for me, far be it from me\nthat I should sin against the LORD in\nceasing to pray for you; but I will teach\nyou the good and the right way.\n\"Now therefore, stand and see this\ngreat thing which the LORD will do\nbefore your eyes:\nOnly fear the LORD, and serve Him in\ntruth with all your heart; for consider\nwhat great things He has done for you.\nIs today not the wheat harvest? I will\ncall to the LORD, and He will send\nthunder and rain, that you may perceive\nand see that your wickedness is great,\nwhich you have done in the sight of the\nLORD, in asking a king for yourselves.\"\nSo Samuel called to the LORD, and\nthe LORD sent thunder and rain that\nday; and all the people greatly feared\nthe LORD and Samuel.\nBut if you still do wickedly, you shall be\nswept away, both you and your king.\"\n13Saul reigned one year; and when\nhe had reigned two years over Israel,\nSaul chose for himself three thousand\nmen of Israel. Two thousand were with\nSaul in Michmash and in the mountains\nof Bethel, and a thousand were with\nJonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The\nrest of the people he sent away, every\nman to his tent.\nAnd Jonathan attacked the garrison of\nthe Philistines that was in Geba, and the\nPhilistines heard of it. Then Saul blew\nthe trumpet throughout all the land,\nsaying, \"Let the Hebrews hear!\"\nNow all Israel heard it said that Saul\nhad attacked a garrison of the\nPhilistines, and that Israel had also\nbecome an abomination to the\nPhilistines. And the people were called\ntogether to Saul at Gilgal.\nThen the Philistines gathered together\nto fight with Israel, thirty thousand\nchariots and six thousand horsemen,\nand people as the sand which is on the\nseashore in multitude. And they came\nup and encamped in Michmash, to the\neast of Beth Aven.\nNow it happened, as soon as he had\nfinished presenting the burnt offering,\nthat Samuel came; and Saul went out to\nmeet him, that he might greet him.\nAnd Samuel said, \"What have you\ndone?\" Saul said, \"When I saw that the\npeople were scattered from me, and that\nyou did not come within the days\nappointed, and that the Philistines\ngathered together at Michmash,\nthen I said, \"The Philistines will now\ncome down on me at Gilgal, and I have\nnot made supplication to the LORD.'\nTherefore I felt compelled, and offered a\nburnt offering.\"\nAnd Samuel said to Saul, \"You have\ndone foolishly. You have not kept the\ncommandment of the LORD your God,\nwhich He commanded you. For now the\nLORD would have established your\nkingdom over Israel forever.\nWhen the men of Israel saw that they\nwere in danger (for the people were\ndistressed), then the people hid in caves,\nin thickets, in rocks, in holes, and in pits.\nAnd some of the Hebrews crossed over\nthe Jordan to the land of Gad and\nGilead. As for Saul, he was still in Gilgal,\nand all the people followed him\ntrembling.\nThen he waited seven days, according\nto the time set by Samuel. But Samuel\ndid not come to Gilgal; and the people\nwere scattered from him.\nSo Saul said, \"Bring a burnt offering\nand peace offerings here to me.\" And he\noffered the burnt offering.\nBut now your kingdom shall not\ncontinue. The LORD has sought for\nHimself a man after His own heart, and\nthe LORD has commanded him to be\ncommander over His people, because\nyou have not kept what the LORD\ncommanded you.\"\nThen Samuel arose and went up from\nGilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul\nnumbered the people present with him,\nabout six hundred men.\nSaul, Jonathan his son, and the\npeople present with them remained in\nGibeah of Benjamin. But the Philistines\nencamped in Michmash.\nThen raiders came out of the camp of\nthe Philistines in three companies. One\ncompany turned onto the road to\nOphrah, to the land of Shual,\nAnd Saul was sitting in the outskirts of\nGibeah under a pomegranate tree which\nis in Migron. The people who were with\nhim were about six hundred men.\nanother company turned to the road to\nBeth Horon, and another company\nturned to the road of the border that\noverlooks the Valley of Zeboim toward\nthe wilderness.\nAhijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's\nbrother, the son of Phinehas, the son of\nEli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, was\nwearing an ephod. But the people did\nnot know that Jonathan had gone.\nNow there was no blacksmith to be\nfound throughout all the land of Israel,\nfor the Philistines said, \"Lest the\nHebrews make swords or spears.\"\nBut all the Israelites would go down to\nthe Philistines to sharpen each man's\nplowshare, his mattock, his ax, and his\nsickle;\nBetween the passes, by which\nJonathan sought to go over to the\nPhilistines' garrison, there was a sharp\nrock on one side and a sharp rock on\nthe other side. And the name of one was\nBozez, and the name of the other Seneh.\nThe front of one faced northward\nopposite Michmash, and the other\nsouthward opposite Gibeah.\nand the charge for a sharpening was a\npim for the plowshares, the mattocks,\nthe forks, and the axes, and to set the\npoints of the goads.\nSo it came about, on the day of battle,\nthat there was neither sword nor spear\nfound in the hand of any of the people\nwho were with Saul and Jonathan. But\nthey were found with Saul and Jonathan\nhis son.\nAnd the garrison of the Philistines\nwent out to the pass of Michmash.\n14Now it happened one day that\nJonathan the son of Saul said to the\nyoung man who bore his armor, \"Come,\nlet us go over to the Philistines' garrison\nthat is on the other side.\" But he did not\ntell his father.\nThen Jonathan said to the young man\nwho bore his armor, \"Come, let us go\nover to the garrison of these\nuncircumcised; it may be that the LORD\nwill work for us. For nothing restrains the\nLORD from saving by many or by few.\"\nSo his armorbearer said to him, \"Do all\nthat is in your heart. Go then; here I am\nwith you, according to your heart.\"\nThen Jonathan said, \"Very well, let us\ncross over to these men, and we will\nshow ourselves to them.\nIf they say thus to us, \"Wait until we\ncome to you,' then we will stand still in\nour place and not go up to them.\nBut if they say thus, \"Come up to us,'\nthen we will go up. For the LORD has\ndelivered them into our hand, and this\nwill be a sign to us.\"\nJonathan and his armorbearer were not\nthere.\nSo both of them showed themselves to\nthe garrison of the Philistines. And the\nPhilistines said, \"Look, the Hebrews are\ncoming out of the holes where they have\nhidden.\"\nThen the men of the garrison called to\nJonathan and his armorbearer, and said,\n\"Come up to us, and we will show you\nsomething.\" Jonathan said to his\narmorbearer, \"Come up after me, for the\nLORD has delivered them into the hand\nof Israel.\"\nAnd Jonathan climbed up on his hands\nand knees with his armorbearer after\nhim; and they fell before Jonathan. And\nas he came after him, his armorbearer\nkilled them.\nThat first slaughter which Jonathan\nand his armorbearer made was about\ntwenty men within about half an acre of\nland.\nAnd there was trembling in the camp,\nin the field, and among all the people.\nThe garrison and the raiders also\ntrembled; and the earth quaked, so that\nit was a very great trembling.\nNow the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah\nof Benjamin looked, and there was the\nmultitude, melting away; and they went\nhere and there.\nThen Saul said to the people who\nwere with him, \"Now call the roll and see\nwho has gone from us.\" And when they\nhad called the roll, surprisingly,\nAnd Saul said to Ahijah, \"Bring the ark\nof God here\" (for at that time the ark of\nGod was with the children of Israel).\nNow it happened, while Saul talked to\nthe priest, that the noise which was in\nthe camp of the Philistines continued to\nincrease; so Saul said to the priest,\n\"Withdraw your hand.\"\nThen Saul and all the people who\nwere with him assembled, and they\nwent to the battle; and indeed every\nman's sword was against his neighbor,\nand there was very great confusion.\nMoreover the Hebrews who were with\nthe Philistines before that time, who\nwent up with them into the camp from\nthe surrounding country, they also\njoined the Israelites who were with Saul\nand Jonathan.\nLikewise all the men of Israel who had\nhidden in the mountains of Ephraim,\nwhen they heard that the Philistines fled,\nthey also followed hard after them in the\nbattle.\nSo the LORD saved Israel that day,\nand the battle shifted to Beth Aven.\nAnd the men of Israel were distressed\nthat day, for Saul had placed the people\nunder oath, saying, \"Cursed is the man\nwho eats any food until evening, before I\nhave taken vengeance on my enemies.\"\nSo none of the people tasted food.\nNow all the people of the land came to\na forest; and there was honey on the\nground.\nAnd when the people had come into\nthe woods, there was the honey,\ndripping; but no one put his hand to his\nmouth, for the people feared the oath.\nThen they told Saul, saying, \"Look, the\npeople are sinning against the LORD by\neating with the blood!\" So he said, \"You\nhave dealt treacherously; roll a large\nstone to me this day.\"\nBut Jonathan had not heard his father\ncharge the people with the oath;\ntherefore he stretched out the end of the\nrod that was in his hand and dipped it in\na honeycomb, and put his hand to his\nmouth; and his countenance brightened.\nThen Saul said, \"Disperse yourselves\namong the people, and say to them,\n\"Bring me here every man's ox and\nevery man's sheep, slaughter them here,\nand eat; and do not sin against the\nLORD by eating with the blood.\"' So\nevery one of the people brought his ox\nwith him that night, and slaughtered it\nthere.\nThen one of the people said, \"Your\nfather strictly charged the people with an\noath, saying, \"Cursed is the man who\neats food this day.\"' And the people\nwere faint.\nBut Jonathan said, \"My father has\ntroubled the land. Look now, how my\ncountenance has brightened because I\ntasted a little of this honey.\nThen Saul built an altar to the LORD.\nThis was the first altar that he built to the\nLORD.\nNow Saul said, \"Let us go down after\nthe Philistines by night, and plunder\nthem until the morning light; and let us\nnot leave a man of them.\" And they said,\n\"Do whatever seems good to you.\" Then\nthe priest said, \"Let us draw near to God\nhere.\"\nHow much better if the people had\neaten freely today of the spoil of their\nenemies which they found! For now\nwould there not have been a much\ngreater\nslaughter\namong\nthe\nPhilistines?\"\nSo Saul asked counsel of God, \"Shall I\ngo down after the Philistines? Will You\ndeliver them into the hand of Israel?\"\nBut He did not answer him that day.\nAnd Saul said, \"Come over here, all\nyou chiefs of the people, and know and\nsee what this sin was today.\nNow they had driven back the\nPhilistines that day from Michmash to\nAijalon. So the people were very faint.\nAnd the people rushed on the spoil,\nand took sheep, oxen, and calves, and\nslaughtered them on the ground; and\nthe people ate them with the blood.\nFor as the LORD lives, who saves\nIsrael, though it be in Jonathan my son,\nhe shall surely die.\" But not a man\namong all the people answered him.\nThen he said to all Israel, \"You be on\none side, and my son Jonathan and I\nwill be on the other side.\" And the\npeople said to Saul, \"Do what seems\ngood to you.\"\nTherefore Saul said to the LORD God\nof Israel, \"Give a perfect lot.\" So Saul\nand Jonathan were taken, but the\npeople escaped.\nAnd Saul said, \"Cast lots between my\nson Jonathan and me.\" So Jonathan\nwas taken.\nagainst the Philistines. Wherever he\nturned, he harassed them.\nAnd he gathered an army and\nattacked the Amalekites, and delivered\nIsrael from the hands of those who\nplundered them.\nThe sons of Saul were Jonathan,\nJishui, and Malchishua. And the names\nof his two daughters were these: the\nname of the firstborn Merab, and the\nname of the younger Michal.\nThen Saul said to Jonathan, \"Tell me\nwhat you have done.\" And Jonathan told\nhim, and said, \"I only tasted a little\nhoney with the end of the rod that was in\nmy hand. So now I must die!\"\nSaul answered, \"God do so and more\nalso; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.\"\nBut the people said to Saul, \"Shall\nJonathan die, who has accomplished\nthis great deliverance in Israel?\nCertainly not! As the LORD lives, not\none hair of his head shall fall to the\nground, for he has worked with God this\nday.\" So the people rescued Jonathan,\nand he did not die.\nThen Saul returned from pursuing the\nPhilistines, and the Philistines went to\ntheir own place.\nSo Saul established his sovereignty\nover Israel, and fought against all his\nenemies on every side, against Moab,\nagainst the people of Ammon, against\nEdom, against the kings of Zobah, and\nThe name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam\nthe daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name\nof the commander of his army was\nAbner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.\nKish was the father of Saul, and Ner\nthe father of Abner was the son of Abiel.\nNow there was fierce war with the\nPhilistines all the days of Saul. And\nwhen Saul saw any strong man or any\nvaliant man, he took him for himself.\n15Samuel also said to Saul, \"The\nLORD sent me to anoint you king over\nHis people, over Israel. Now therefore,\nheed the voice of the words of the\nLORD.\nThus says the LORD of hosts: \"I will\npunish Amalek for what he did to Israel,\nhow he ambushed him on the way when\nhe came up from Egypt.\nNow go and attack Amalek, and utterly\ndestroy all that they have, and do not\nspare them. But kill both man and\nwoman, infant and nursing child, ox and\nsheep, camel and donkey.\"'\nSo Saul gathered the people together\nand numbered them in Telaim, two\nhundred thousand foot soldiers and ten\nthousand men of Judah.\nAnd Saul came to a city of Amalek, and\nlay in wait in the valley.\nSo when Samuel rose early in the\nmorning to meet Saul, it was told\nSamuel, saying, \"Saul went to Carmel,\nand indeed, he set up a monument for\nhimself; and he has gone on around,\npassed by, and gone down to Gilgal.\"\nThen Samuel went to Saul, and Saul\nsaid to him, \"Blessed are you of the\nLORD!\nI\nhave\nperformed\nthe\ncommandment of the LORD.\"\nThen Saul said to the Kenites, \"Go,\ndepart, get down from among the\nAmalekites, lest I destroy you with them.\nFor you showed kindness to all the\nchildren of Israel when they came up out\nof Egypt.\" So the Kenites departed from\namong the Amalekites.\nBut Samuel said, \"What then is this\nbleating of the sheep in my ears, and\nthe lowing of the oxen which I hear?\"\nAnd Saul attacked the Amalekites, from\nHavilah all the way to Shur, which is\neast of Egypt.\nAnd Saul said, \"They have brought\nthem from the Amalekites; for the\npeople spared the best of the sheep and\nthe oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD your\nGod; and the rest we have utterly\ndestroyed.\"\nHe also took Agag king of the\nAmalekites alive, and utterly destroyed\nall the people with the edge of the sword.\nThen Samuel said to Saul, \"Be quiet!\nAnd I will tell you what the LORD said to\nme last night.\" And he said to him,\n\"Speak on.\"\nBut Saul and the people spared Agag\nand the best of the sheep, the oxen, the\nfatlings, the lambs, and all that was\ngood, and were unwilling to utterly\ndestroy them. But everything despised\nand worthless, that they utterly\ndestroyed.\nSo Samuel said, \"When you were little\nin your own eyes, were you not head of\nthe tribes of Israel? And did not the\nLORD anoint you king over Israel?\nNow the word of the LORD came to\nSamuel, saying,\nNow the LORD sent you on a mission,\nand said, \"Go, and utterly destroy the\nsinners, the Amalekites, and fight\nagainst them until they are consumed.'\n\"I greatly regret that I have set up Saul\nas king, for he has turned back from\nfollowing Me, and has not performed My\ncommandments.\" And it grieved Samuel,\nand he cried out to the LORD all night.\nWhy then did you not obey the voice of\nthe LORD? Why did you swoop down\non the spoil, and do evil in the sight of\nthe LORD?\"\nAnd Saul said to Samuel, \"But I have\nobeyed the voice of the LORD, and\ngone on the mission on which the LORD\nsent me, and brought back Agag king of\nAmalek; I have utterly destroyed the\nAmalekites.\nBut the people took of the plunder,\nsheep and oxen, the best of the things\nwhich should have been utterly\ndestroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD your\nGod in Gilgal.\"\nSo Samuel said: \"Has the LORD as\ngreat delight in burnt offerings and\nsacrifices, As in obeying the voice of the\nLORD? Behold, to obey is better than\nsacrifice, And to heed than the fat of\nrams.\nAnd as Samuel turned around to go\naway, Saul seized the edge of his robe,\nand it tore.\nSo Samuel said to him, \"The LORD\nhas torn the kingdom of Israel from you\ntoday, and has given it to a neighbor of\nyours, who is better than you.\nAnd also the Strength of Israel will not\nlie nor relent. For He is not a man, that\nHe should relent.\"\nThen he said, \"I have sinned; yet\nhonor me now, please, before the elders\nof my people and before Israel, and\nreturn with me, that I may worship the\nLORD your God.\"\nFor rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft,\nAnd stubbornness is as iniquity and\nidolatry. Because you have rejected the\nword of the LORD, He also has rejected\nyou from being king.\"\nThen Saul said to Samuel, \"I have\nsinned, for I have transgressed the\ncommandment of the LORD and your\nwords, because I feared the people and\nobeyed their voice.\nNow therefore, please pardon my sin,\nand return with me, that I may worship\nthe LORD.\"\nBut Samuel said to Saul, \"I will not\nreturn with you, for you have rejected\nthe word of the LORD, and the LORD\nhas rejected you from being king over\nIsrael.\"\nSo Samuel turned back after Saul, and\nSaul worshiped the LORD.\nThen Samuel said, \"Bring Agag king of\nthe Amalekites here to me.\" So Agag\ncame to him cautiously. And Agag said,\n\"Surely the bitterness of death is past.\"\nBut Samuel said, \"As your sword has\nmade women childless, so shall your\nmother be childless among women.\"\nAnd Samuel hacked Agag in pieces\nbefore the LORD in Gilgal.\nThen Samuel went to Ramah, and\nSaul went up to his house at Gibeah of\nSaul.\nAnd Samuel went no more to see Saul\nuntil the day of his death. Nevertheless\nSamuel mourned for Saul, and the\nLORD regretted that He had made Saul\nking over Israel.\n16Now the LORD said to Samuel,\n\"How long will you mourn for Saul,\nseeing I have rejected him from reigning\nover Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and\ngo; I am sending you to Jesse the\nBethlehemite. For I have provided\nMyself a king among his sons.\"\nAnd Samuel said, \"How can I go? If\nSaul hears it, he will kill me.\" But the\nLORD said, \"Take a heifer with you, and\nsay, \"I have come to sacrifice to the\nLORD.'\nThen invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I\nwill show you what you shall do; you\nshall anoint for Me the one I name to\nyou.\"\nSo Jesse called Abinadab, and made\nhim pass before Samuel. And he said,\n\"Neither has the LORD chosen this\none.\"\nThen Jesse made Shammah pass by.\nAnd he said, \"Neither has the LORD\nchosen this one.\"\nThus Jesse made seven of his sons\npass before Samuel. And Samuel said\nto Jesse, \"The LORD has not chosen\nthese.\"\nAnd Samuel said to Jesse, \"Are all the\nyoung men here?\" Then he said, \"There\nremains yet the youngest, and there he\nis, keeping the sheep.\" And Samuel said\nto Jesse, \"Send and bring him. For we\nwill not sit down till he comes here.\"\nSo Samuel did what the LORD said,\nand went to Bethlehem. And the elders\nof the town trembled at his coming, and\nsaid, \"Do you come peaceably?\"\nSo he sent and brought him in. Now\nhe was ruddy, with bright eyes, and\ngood-looking. And the LORD said,\n\"Arise, anoint him; for this is the one!\"\nAnd he said, \"Peaceably; I have come\nto sacrifice to the LORD. Sanctify\nyourselves, and come with me to the\nsacrifice.\" Then he consecrated Jesse\nand his sons, and invited them to the\nsacrifice.\nThen Samuel took the horn of oil and\nanointed him in the midst of his\nbrothers; and the Spirit of the LORD\ncame upon David from that day forward.\nSo Samuel arose and went to Ramah.\nSo it was, when they came, that he\nlooked at Eliab and said, \"Surely the\nLORD's anointed is before Him!\"\nBut the Spirit of the LORD departed\nfrom Saul, and a distressing spirit from\nthe LORD troubled him.\nBut the LORD said to Samuel, \"Do not\nlook at his appearance or at his physical\nstature, because I have refused him. For\nthe LORD does not see as man sees;\nfor man looks at the outward\nappearance, but the LORD looks at the\nheart.\"\nAnd Saul's servants said to him,\n\"Surely, a distressing spirit from God is\ntroubling you.\nLet our master now command your\nservants, who are before you, to seek\nout a man who is a skillful player on the\nharp. And it shall be that he will play it\nwith his hand when the distressing spirit\nfrom God is upon you, and you shall be\nwell.\"\ngathered at Sochoh, which belongs to\nJudah; they encamped between Sochoh\nand Azekah, in Ephes Dammim.\nSo Saul said to his servants, \"Provide\nme now a man who can play well, and\nbring him to me.\"\nAnd Saul and the men of Israel were\ngathered together, and they encamped\nin the Valley of Elah, and drew up in\nbattle array against the Philistines.\nThen one of the servants answered\nand said, \"Look, I have seen a son of\nJesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in\nplaying, a mighty man of valor, a man of\nwar, prudent in speech, and a\nhandsome person; and the LORD is\nwith him.\"\nTherefore Saul sent messengers to\nJesse, and said, \"Send me your son\nDavid, who is with the sheep.\"\nAnd Jesse took a donkey loaded with\nbread, a skin of wine, and a young goat,\nand sent them by his son David to Saul.\nThe Philistines stood on a mountain on\none side, and Israel stood on a\nmountain on the other side, with a valley\nbetween them.\nAnd a champion went out from the\ncamp of the Philistines, named Goliath,\nfrom Gath, whose height was six cubits\nand a span.\nHe had a bronze helmet on his head,\nand he was armed with a coat of mail,\nand the weight of the coat was five\nthousand shekels of bronze.\nSo David came to Saul and stood\nbefore him. And he loved him greatly,\nand he became his armorbearer.\nAnd he had bronze armor on his legs\nand a bronze javelin between his\nshoulders.\nThen Saul sent to Jesse, saying,\n\"Please let David stand before me, for\nhe has found favor in my sight.\"\nNow the staff of his spear was like a\nweaver's beam, and his iron spearhead\nweighed six hundred shekels; and a\nshield-bearer went before him.\nAnd so it was, whenever the spirit from\nGod was upon Saul, that David would\ntake a harp and play it with his hand.\nThen Saul would become refreshed and\nwell, and the distressing spirit would\ndepart from him.\n17Now the Philistines gathered their\narmies together to battle, and were\nThen he stood and cried out to the\narmies of Israel, and said to them, \"Why\nhave you come out to line up for battle?\nAm I not a Philistine, and you the\nservants of Saul? Choose a man for\nyourselves, and let him come down to\nme.\nIf he is able to fight with me and kill me,\nthen we will be your servants. But if I\nprevail against him and kill him, then\nyou shall be our servants and serve us.\"\nNow Saul and they and all the men of\nIsrael were in the Valley of Elah, fighting\nwith the Philistines.\nAnd the Philistine said, \"I defy the\narmies of Israel this day; give me a man,\nthat we may fight together.\"\nWhen Saul and all Israel heard these\nwords of the Philistine, they were\ndismayed and greatly afraid.\nSo David rose early in the morning, left\nthe sheep with a keeper, and took the\nthings and went as Jesse had\ncommanded him. And he came to the\ncamp as the army was going out to the\nfight and shouting for the battle.\nNow David was the son of that\nEphrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose\nname was Jesse, and who had eight\nsons. And the man was old, advanced in\nyears, in the days of Saul.\nThe three oldest sons of Jesse had\ngone to follow Saul to the battle. The\nnames of his three sons who went to the\nbattle were Eliab the firstborn, next to\nhim Abinadab, and the third Shammah.\nFor Israel and the Philistines had\ndrawn up in battle array, army against\narmy.\nAnd David left his supplies in the hand\nof the supply keeper, ran to the army,\nand came and greeted his brothers.\nDavid was the youngest. And the three\noldest followed Saul.\nThen as he talked with them, there\nwas the champion, the Philistine of Gath,\nGoliath by name, coming up from the\narmies of the Philistines; and he spoke\naccording to the same words. So David\nheard them.\nBut David occasionally went and\nreturned from Saul to feed his father's\nsheep at Bethlehem.\nAnd all the men of Israel, when they\nsaw the man, fled from him and were\ndreadfully afraid.\nAnd the Philistine drew near and\npresented himself forty days, morning\nand evening.\nThen Jesse said to his son David,\n\"Take now for your brothers an ephah of\nthis dried grain and these ten loaves,\nand run to your brothers at the camp.\nAnd carry these ten cheeses to the\ncaptain of their thousand, and see how\nyour brothers fare, and bring back news\nof them.\"\nSo the men of Israel said, \"Have you\nseen this man who has come up?\nSurely he has come up to defy Israel;\nand it shall be that the man who kills him\nthe king will enrich with great riches, will\ngive him his daughter, and give his\nfather's house exemption from taxes in\nIsrael.\"\nThen David spoke to the men who\nstood by him, saying, \"What shall be\ndone for the man who kills this Philistine\nand takes away the reproach from\nIsrael? For who is this uncircumcised\nPhilistine, that he should defy the armies\nof the living God?\"\nI went out after it and struck it, and\ndelivered the lamb from its mouth; and\nwhen it arose against me, I caught it by\nits beard, and struck and killed it.\nAnd the people answered him in this\nmanner, saying, \"So shall it be done for\nthe man who kills him.\"\nNow Eliab his oldest brother heard\nwhen he spoke to the men; and Eliab's\nanger was aroused against David, and\nhe said, \"Why did you come down here?\nAnd with whom have you left those few\nsheep in the wilderness? I know your\npride and the insolence of your heart, for\nyou have come down to see the battle.\"\nAnd David said, \"What have I done\nnow? Is there not a cause?\"\nYour servant has killed both lion and\nbear; and this uncircumcised Philistine\nwill be like one of them, seeing he has\ndefied the armies of the living God.\"\nMoreover David said, \"The LORD, who\ndelivered me from the paw of the lion\nand from the paw of the bear, He will\ndeliver me from the hand of this\nPhilistine.\" And Saul said to David, \"Go,\nand the LORD be with you!\"\nSo Saul clothed David with his armor,\nand he put a bronze helmet on his head;\nhe also clothed him with a coat of mail.\nThen he turned from him toward\nanother and said the same thing; and\nthese people answered him as the first\nones did.\nNow when the words which David\nspoke were heard, they reported them\nto Saul; and he sent for him.\nThen David said to Saul, \"Let no man's\nheart fail because of him; your servant\nwill go and fight with this Philistine.\"\nDavid fastened his sword to his armor\nand tried to walk, for he had not tested\nthem. And David said to Saul, \"I cannot\nwalk with these, for I have not tested\nthem.\" So David took them off.\nThen he took his staff in his hand; and\nhe chose for himself five smooth stones\nfrom the brook, and put them in a\nshepherd's bag, in a pouch which he\nhad, and his sling was in his hand. And\nhe drew near to the Philistine.\nAnd Saul said to David, \"You are not\nable to go against this Philistine to fight\nwith him; for you are a youth, and he a\nman of war from his youth.\"\nSo the Philistine came, and began\ndrawing near to David, and the man who\nbore the shield went before him.\nBut David said to Saul, \"Your servant\nused to keep his father's sheep, and\nwhen a lion or a bear came and took a\nlamb out of the flock,\nAnd when the Philistine looked about\nand saw David, he disdained him; for he\nwas only a youth, ruddy and goodlooking.\nSo the Philistine said to David, \"Am I a\ndog, that you come to me with sticks?\"\nAnd the Philistine cursed David by his\ngods.\nSo David prevailed over the Philistine\nwith a sling and a stone, and struck the\nPhilistine and killed him. But there was\nno sword in the hand of David.\nAnd the Philistine said to David,\n\"Come to me, and I will give your flesh\nto the birds of the air and the beasts of\nthe field!\"\nThen David said to the Philistine, \"You\ncome to me with a sword, with a spear,\nand with a javelin. But I come to you in\nthe name of the LORD of hosts, the God\nof the armies of Israel, whom you have\ndefied.\nThis day the LORD will deliver you into\nmy hand, and I will strike you and take\nyour head from you. And this day I will\ngive the carcasses of the camp of the\nPhilistines to the birds of the air and the\nwild beasts of the earth, that all the\nearth may know that there is a God in\nIsrael.\nThen all this assembly shall know that\nthe LORD does not save with sword and\nspear; for the battle is the LORD's, and\nHe will give you into our hands.\"\nSo it was, when the Philistine arose\nand came and drew near to meet David,\nthat David hurried and ran toward the\narmy to meet the Philistine.\nTherefore David ran and stood over\nthe Philistine, took his sword and drew it\nout of its sheath and killed him, and cut\noff his head with it. And when the\nPhilistines saw that their champion was\ndead, they fled.\nNow the men of Israel and Judah\narose and shouted, and pursued the\nPhilistines as far as the entrance of the\nvalley and to the gates of Ekron. And\nthe wounded of the Philistines fell along\nthe road to Shaaraim, even as far as\nGath and Ekron.\nThen the children of Israel returned\nfrom chasing the Philistines, and they\nplundered their tents.\nAnd David took the head of the\nPhilistine and brought it to Jerusalem,\nbut he put his armor in his tent.\nWhen Saul saw David going out\nagainst the Philistine, he said to Abner,\nthe commander of the army, \"Abner,\nwhose son is this youth?\" And Abner\nsaid, \"As your soul lives, O king, I do not\nknow.\"\nThen David put his hand in his bag\nand took out a stone; and he slung it\nand struck the Philistine in his forehead,\nso that the stone sank into his forehead,\nand he fell on his face to the earth.\nSo the king said, \"Inquire whose son\nthis young man is.\"\nThen, as David returned from the\nslaughter of the Philistine, Abner took\nhim and brought him before Saul with\nthe head of the Philistine in his hand.\nAnd Saul said to him, \"Whose son are\nyou, young man?\" So David answered,\n\"I am the son of your servant Jesse the\nBethlehemite.\"\n18Now when he had finished\nspeaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan\nwas knit to the soul of David, and\nJonathan loved him as his own soul.\nSaul took him that day, and would not\nlet him go home to his father's house\nanymore.\nThen Jonathan and David made a\ncovenant, because he loved him as his\nown soul.\nAnd Jonathan took off the robe that\nwas on him and gave it to David, with\nhis armor, even to his sword and his\nbow and his belt.\nSo David went out wherever Saul sent\nhim, and behaved wisely. And Saul set\nhim over the men of war, and he was\naccepted in the sight of all the people\nand also in the sight of Saul's servants.\nNow it had happened as they were\ncoming home, when David was\nreturning from the slaughter of the\nPhilistine, that the women had come out\nof all the cities of Israel, singing and\ndancing, to meet King Saul, with\ntambourines, with joy, and with musical\ninstruments.\nSo the women sang as they danced,\nand said: \"Saul has slain his thousands,\nAnd David his ten thousands.\"\nThen Saul was very angry, and the\nsaying displeased him; and he said,\n\"They have ascribed to David ten\nthousands, and to me they have\nascribed only thousands. Now what\nmore can he have but the kingdom?\"\nSo Saul eyed David from that day\nforward.\nAnd it happened on the next day that\nthe distressing spirit from God came\nupon Saul, and he prophesied inside the\nhouse. So David played music with his\nhand, as at other times; but there was a\nspear in Saul's hand.\nAnd Saul cast the spear, for he said, \"I\nwill pin David to the wall!\" But David\nescaped his presence twice.\nNow Saul was afraid of David,\nbecause the LORD was with him, but\nhad departed from Saul.\nTherefore Saul removed him from his\npresence, and made him his captain\nover a thousand; and he went out and\ncame in before the people.\nAnd David behaved wisely in all his\nways, and the LORD was with him.\nTherefore, when Saul saw that he\nbehaved very wisely, he was afraid of\nhim.\nBut all Israel and Judah loved David,\nbecause he went out and came in\nbefore them.\nThen Saul said to David, \"Here is my\nolder daughter Merab; I will give her to\nyou as a wife. Only be valiant for me,\nand fight the LORD's battles.\" For Saul\nthought, \"Let my hand not be against\nhim, but let the hand of the Philistines\nbe against him.\"\nSo David said to Saul, \"Who am I, and\nwhat is my life or my father's family in\nIsrael, that I should be son-in-law to the\nking?\"\nBut it happened at the time when\nMerab, Saul's daughter, should have\nbeen given to David, that she was given\nto Adriel the Meholathite as a wife.\nNow Michal, Saul's daughter, loved\nDavid. And they told Saul, and the thing\npleased him.\nSo Saul said, \"I will give her to him,\nthat she may be a snare to him, and that\nthe hand of the Philistines may be\nagainst him.\" Therefore Saul said to\nDavid a second time, \"You shall be my\nson-in-law today.\"\nAnd Saul commanded his servants,\n\"Communicate with David secretly, and\nsay, \"Look, the king has delight in you,\nand all his servants love you. Now\ntherefore, become the king's son-inlaw.\"'\nSo Saul's servants spoke those words\nin the hearing of David. And David said,\n\"Does it seem to you a light thing to be a\nking's son-in-law, seeing I am a poor\nand lightly esteemed man?\"\nAnd the servants of Saul told him,\nsaying, \"In this manner David spoke.\"\nThen Saul said, \"Thus you shall say to\nDavid: \"The king does not desire any\ndowry but one hundred foreskins of the\nPhilistines, to take vengeance on the\nking's enemies.\"' But Saul thought to\nmake David fall by the hand of the\nPhilistines.\nSo when his servants told David these\nwords, it pleased David well to become\nthe king's son-in-law. Now the days had\nnot expired;\ntherefore David arose and went, he\nand his men, and killed two hundred\nmen of the Philistines. And David\nbrought their foreskins, and they gave\nthem in full count to the king, that he\nmight become the king's son-in-law.\nThen Saul gave him Michal his daughter\nas a wife.\nThus Saul saw and knew that the\nLORD was with David, and that Michal,\nSaul's daughter, loved him;\nand Saul was still more afraid of David.\nSo Saul became David's enemy\ncontinually.\nThen the princes of the Philistines\nwent out to war. And so it was,\nwhenever they went out, that David\nbehaved more wisely than all the\nservants of Saul, so that his name\nbecame highly esteemed.\n19Now Saul spoke to Jonathan his\nson and to all his servants, that they\nshould kill David; but Jonathan, Saul's\nson, delighted greatly in David.\nSo Jonathan told David, saying, \"My\nfather Saul seeks to kill you. Therefore\nplease be on your guard until morning,\nand stay in a secret place and hide.\nThen Saul sought to pin David to the\nwall with the spear, but he slipped away\nfrom Saul's presence; and he drove the\nspear into the wall. So David fled and\nescaped that night.\nAnd I will go out and stand beside my\nfather in the field where you are, and I\nwill speak with my father about you.\nThen what I observe, I will tell you.\"\nThus Jonathan spoke well of David to\nSaul his father, and said to him, \"Let not\nthe king sin against his servant, against\nDavid, because he has not sinned\nagainst you, and because his works\nhave been very good toward you.\nSaul also sent messengers to David's\nhouse to watch him and to kill him in the\nmorning. And Michal, David's wife, told\nhim, saying, \"If you do not save your life\ntonight, tomorrow you will be killed.\"\nSo Michal let David down through a\nwindow. And he went and fled and\nescaped.\nFor he took his life in his hands and\nkilled the Philistine, and the LORD\nbrought about a great deliverance for all\nIsrael. You saw it and rejoiced. Why\nthen will you sin against innocent blood,\nto kill David without a cause?\"\nAnd Michal took an image and laid it in\nthe bed, put a cover of goats' hair for his\nhead, and covered it with clothes.\nSo when Saul sent messengers to\ntake David, she said, \"He is sick.\"\nSo Saul heeded the voice of Jonathan,\nand Saul swore, \"As the LORD lives, he\nshall not be killed.\"\nThen Saul sent the messengers back\nto see David, saying, \"Bring him up to\nme in the bed, that I may kill him.\"\nThen Jonathan called David, and\nJonathan told him all these things. So\nJonathan brought David to Saul, and he\nwas in his presence as in times past.\nAnd there was war again; and David\nwent out and fought with the Philistines,\nand struck them with a mighty blow, and\nthey fled from him.\nAnd when the messengers had come\nin, there was the image in the bed, with\na cover of goats' hair for his head.\nThen Saul said to Michal, \"Why have\nyou deceived me like this, and sent my\nenemy away, so that he has escaped?\"\nAnd Michal answered Saul, \"He said to\nme, \"Let me go! Why should I kill you?\"'\nNow the distressing spirit from the\nLORD came upon Saul as he sat in his\nhouse with his spear in his hand. And\nDavid was playing music with his hand.\nSo David fled and escaped, and went\nto Samuel at Ramah, and told him all\nthat Saul had done to him. And he and\nSamuel went and stayed in Naioth.\nNow it was told Saul, saying, \"Take\nnote, David is at Naioth in Ramah!\"\nsmall without first telling me. And why\nshould my father hide this thing from\nme? It is not so!\"\nThen Saul sent messengers to take\nDavid. And when they saw the group of\nprophets prophesying, and Samuel\nstanding as leader over them, the Spirit\nof God came upon the messengers of\nSaul, and they also prophesied.\nAnd when Saul was told, he sent other\nmessengers, and they prophesied\nlikewise. Then Saul sent messengers\nagain the third time, and they\nprophesied also.\nThen David took an oath again, and\nsaid, \"Your father certainly knows that I\nhave found favor in your eyes, and he\nhas said, \"Do not let Jonathan know this,\nlest he be grieved.' But truly, as the\nLORD lives and as your soul lives, there\nis but a step between me and death.\"\nSo Jonathan said to David, \"Whatever\nyou yourself desire, I will do it for you.\"\nThen he also went to Ramah, and\ncame to the great well that is at Sechu.\nSo he asked, and said, \"Where are\nSamuel and David?\" And someone said,\n\"Indeed they are at Naioth in Ramah.\"\nAnd David said to Jonathan, \"Indeed\ntomorrow is the New Moon, and I should\nnot fail to sit with the king to eat. But let\nme go, that I may hide in the field until\nthe third day at evening.\nSo he went there to Naioth in Ramah.\nThen the Spirit of God was upon him\nalso, and he went on and prophesied\nuntil he came to Naioth in Ramah.\nIf your father misses me at all, then say,\n\"David earnestly asked permission of\nme that he might run over to Bethlehem,\nhis city, for there is a yearly sacrifice\nthere for all the family.'\nAnd he also stripped off his clothes\nand prophesied before Samuel in like\nmanner, and lay down naked all that day\nand all that night. Therefore they say, \"Is\nSaul also among the prophets?\"\n20Then David fled from Naioth in\nRamah, and went and said to Jonathan,\n\"What have I done? What is my iniquity,\nand what is my sin before your father,\nthat he seeks my life?\"\nSo Jonathan said to him, \"By no\nmeans! You shall not die! Indeed, my\nfather will do nothing either great or\nIf he says thus: \"It is well,' your servant\nwill be safe. But if he is very angry, be\nsure that evil is determined by him.\nTherefore you shall deal kindly with\nyour servant, for you have brought your\nservant into a covenant of the LORD\nwith you. Nevertheless, if there is\niniquity in me, kill me yourself, for why\nshould you bring me to your father?\"\nBut Jonathan said, \"Far be it from you!\nFor if I knew certainly that evil was\ndetermined by my father to come upon\nyou, then would I not tell you?\"\nThen David said to Jonathan, \"Who\nwill tell me, or what if your father\nanswers you roughly?\"\nwill be missed, because your seat will\nbe empty.\nAnd Jonathan said to David, \"Come,\nlet us go out into the field.\" So both of\nthem went out into the field.\nAnd when you have stayed three days,\ngo down quickly and come to the place\nwhere you hid on the day of the deed;\nand remain by the stone Ezel.\nThen Jonathan said to David: \"The\nLORD God of Israel is witness! When I\nhave sounded out my father sometime\ntomorrow, or the third day, and indeed\nthere is good toward David, and I do not\nsend to you and tell you,\nmay the LORD do so and much more\nto Jonathan. But if it pleases my father\nto do you evil, then I will report it to you\nand send you away, that you may go in\nsafety. And the LORD be with you as He\nhas been with my father.\nAnd you shall not only show me the\nkindness of the LORD while I still live,\nthat I may not die;\nbut you shall not cut off your kindness\nfrom my house forever, no, not when the\nLORD has cut off every one of the\nenemies of David from the face of the\nearth.\"\nThen I will shoot three arrows to the\nside, as though I shot at a target;\nand there I will send a lad, saying, \"Go,\nfind the arrows.' If I expressly say to the\nlad, \"Look, the arrows are on this side of\nyou; get them and come'--then, as the\nLORD lives, there is safety for you and\nno harm.\nBut if I say thus to the young man,\n\"Look, the arrows are beyond you'--go\nyour way, for the LORD has sent you\naway.\nAnd as for the matter which you and I\nhave spoken of, indeed the LORD be\nbetween you and me forever.\"\nThen David hid in the field. And when\nthe New Moon had come, the king sat\ndown to eat the feast.\nSo Jonathan made a covenant with\nthe house of David, saying, \"Let the\nLORD require it at the hand of David's\nenemies.\"\nNow the king sat on his seat, as at\nother times, on a seat by the wall. And\nJonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's\nside, but David's place was empty.\nNow Jonathan again caused David to\nvow, because he loved him; for he loved\nhim as he loved his own soul.\nNevertheless Saul did not say\nanything that day, for he thought,\n\"Something has happened to him; he is\nunclean, surely he is unclean.\"\nThen Jonathan said to David,\n\"Tomorrow is the New Moon; and you\nAnd it happened the next day, the\nsecond day of the month, that David's\nplace was empty. And Saul said to\nJonathan his son, \"Why has the son of\nJesse not come to eat, either yesterday\nor today?\"\nSo Jonathan answered Saul, \"David\nearnestly asked permission of me to go\nto Bethlehem.\nDavid, because his father had treated\nhim shamefully.\nAnd so it was, in the morning, that\nJonathan went out into the field at the\ntime appointed with David, and a little\nlad was with him.\nAnd he said, \"Please let me go, for our\nfamily has a sacrifice in the city, and my\nbrother has commanded me to be there.\nAnd now, if I have found favor in your\neyes, please let me get away and see\nmy brothers.' Therefore he has not\ncome to the king's table.\"\nThen Saul's anger was aroused\nagainst Jonathan, and he said to him,\n\"You son of a perverse, rebellious\nwoman! Do I not know that you have\nchosen the son of Jesse to your own\nshame and to the shame of your\nmother's nakedness?\nFor as long as the son of Jesse lives\non the earth, you shall not be\nestablished, nor your kingdom. Now\ntherefore, send and bring him to me, for\nhe shall surely die.\"\nAnd Jonathan answered Saul his\nfather, and said to him, \"Why should he\nbe killed? What has he done?\"\nThen Saul cast a spear at him to kill\nhim, by which Jonathan knew that it was\ndetermined by his father to kill David.\nThen he said to his lad, \"Now run, find\nthe arrows which I shoot.\" As the lad ran,\nhe shot an arrow beyond him.\nWhen the lad had come to the place\nwhere the arrow was which Jonathan\nhad shot, Jonathan cried out after the\nlad and said, \"Is not the arrow beyond\nyou?\"\nAnd Jonathan cried out after the lad,\n\"Make haste, hurry, do not delay!\" So\nJonathan's lad gathered up the arrows\nand came back to his master.\nBut the lad did not know anything.\nOnly Jonathan and David knew of the\nmatter.\nThen Jonathan gave his weapons to\nhis lad, and said to him, \"Go, carry them\nto the city.\"\nAs soon as the lad had gone, David\narose from a place toward the south, fell\non his face to the ground, and bowed\ndown three times. And they kissed one\nanother; and they wept together, but\nDavid more so.\nSo Jonathan arose from the table in\nfierce anger, and ate no food the second\nday of the month, for he was grieved for\nThen Jonathan said to David, \"Go in\npeace, since we have both sworn in the\nname of the LORD, saying, \"May the\nLORD be between you and me, and\nbetween your descendants and my\ndescendants, forever.\"' So he arose and\ndeparted, and Jonathan went into the\ncity.\nbread in its place on the day when it\nwas taken away.\n21Now David came to Nob, to\nAhimelech the priest. And Ahimelech\nwas afraid when he met David, and said\nto him, \"Why are you alone, and no one\nis with you?\"\nSo David said to Ahimelech the priest,\n\"The king has ordered me on some\nbusiness, and said to me, \"Do not let\nanyone know anything about the\nbusiness on which I send you, or what I\nhave commanded you.' And I have\ndirected my young men to such and\nsuch a place.\nNow therefore, what have you on\nhand? Give me five loaves of bread in\nmy hand, or whatever can be found.\"\nAnd the priest answered David and\nsaid, \"There is no common bread on\nhand; but there is holy bread, if the\nyoung men have at least kept\nthemselves from women.\"\nThen David answered the priest, and\nsaid to him, \"Truly, women have been\nkept from us about three days since I\ncame out. And the vessels of the young\nmen are holy, and the bread is in effect\ncommon,\neven\nthough\nit\nwas\nconsecrated in the vessel this day.\"\nSo the priest gave him holy bread; for\nthere was no bread there but the\nshowbread which had been taken from\nbefore the LORD, in order to put hot\nNow a certain man of the servants of\nSaul was there that day, detained before\nthe LORD. And his name was Doeg, an\nEdomite, the chief of the herdsmen who\nbelonged to Saul.\nAnd David said to Ahimelech, \"Is there\nnot here on hand a spear or a sword?\nFor I have brought neither my sword nor\nmy weapons with me, because the\nking's business required haste.\"\nSo the priest said, \"The sword of\nGoliath the Philistine, whom you killed in\nthe Valley of Elah, there it is, wrapped in\na cloth behind the ephod. If you will take\nthat, take it. For there is no other except\nthat one here.\" And David said, \"There\nis none like it; give it to me.\"\nThen David arose and fled that day\nfrom before Saul, and went to Achish\nthe king of Gath.\nAnd the servants of Achish said to him,\n\"Is this not David the king of the land?\nDid they not sing of him to one another\nin dances, saying: \"Saul has slain his\nthousands,\nAnd\nDavid\nhis\nten\nthousands'?\"\nNow David took these words to heart,\nand was very much afraid of Achish the\nking of Gath.\nSo he changed his behavior before\nthem, pretended madness in their hands,\nscratched on the doors of the gate, and\nlet his saliva fall down on his beard.\nThen Achish said to his servants,\n\"Look, you see the man is insane. Why\nhave you brought him to me?\nwith his spear in his hand, and all his\nservants standing about him-7\nHave I need of madmen, that you have\nbrought this fellow to play the madman\nin my presence? Shall this fellow come\ninto my house?\"\nthen Saul said to his servants who\nstood about him, \"Hear now, you\nBenjamites! Will the son of Jesse give\nevery one of you fields and vineyards,\nand make you all captains of thousands\nand captains of hundreds?\n22David therefore departed from\nthere and escaped to the cave of\nAdullam. So when his brothers and all\nhis father's house heard it, they went\ndown there to him.\nAnd everyone who was in distress,\neveryone who was in debt, and\neveryone\nwho\nwas\ndiscontented\ngathered to him. So he became captain\nover them. And there were about four\nhundred men with him.\nThen David went from there to Mizpah\nof Moab; and he said to the king of\nMoab, \"Please let my father and mother\ncome here with you, till I know what God\nwill do for me.\"\nSo he brought them before the king of\nMoab, and they dwelt with him all the\ntime that David was in the stronghold.\nNow the prophet Gad said to David,\n\"Do not stay in the stronghold; depart,\nand go to the land of Judah.\" So David\ndeparted and went into the forest of\nHereth.\nWhen Saul heard that David and the\nmen who were with him had been\ndiscovered--now Saul was staying in\nGibeah under a tamarisk tree in Ramah,\nAll of you have conspired against me,\nand there is no one who reveals to me\nthat my son has made a covenant with\nthe son of Jesse; and there is not one of\nyou who is sorry for me or reveals to me\nthat my son has stirred up my servant\nagainst me, to lie in wait, as it is this\nday.\"\nThen answered Doeg the Edomite, who\nwas set over the servants of Saul, and\nsaid, \"I saw the son of Jesse going to\nNob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.\nAnd he inquired of the LORD for him,\ngave him provisions, and gave him the\nsword of Goliath the Philistine.\"\nSo the king sent to call Ahimelech the\npriest, the son of Ahitub, and all his\nfather's house, the priests who were in\nNob. And they all came to the king.\nAnd Saul said, \"Hear now, son of\nAhitub!\" He answered, \"Here I am, my\nlord.\"\nThen Saul said to him, \"Why have you\nconspired against me, you and the son\nof Jesse, in that you have given him\nbread and a sword, and have inquired of\nGod for him, that he should rise against\nme, to lie in wait, as it is this day?\"\nSo Ahimelech answered the king and\nsaid, \"And who among all your servants\nis as faithful as David, who is the king's\nson-in-law, who goes at your bidding,\nand is honorable in your house?\nDid I then begin to inquire of God for\nhim? Far be it from me! Let not the king\nimpute anything to his servant, or to any\nin the house of my father. For your\nservant knew nothing of all this, little or\nmuch.\"\nAnd the king said, \"You shall surely die,\nAhimelech, you and all your father's\nhouse!\"\nThen the king said to the guards who\nstood about him, \"Turn and kill the\npriests of the LORD, because their hand\nalso is with David, and because they\nknew when he fled and did not tell it to\nme.\" But the servants of the king would\nnot lift their hands to strike the priests of\nthe LORD.\nAnd the king said to Doeg, \"You turn\nand kill the priests!\" So Doeg the\nEdomite turned and struck the priests,\nand killed on that day eighty-five men\nwho wore a linen ephod.\nAlso Nob, the city of the priests, he\nstruck with the edge of the sword, both\nmen and women, children and nursing\ninfants, oxen and donkeys and sheep-with the edge of the sword.\nNow one of the sons of Ahimelech the\nson of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped\nand fled after David.\nAnd Abiathar told David that Saul had\nkilled the LORD's priests.\nSo David said to Abiathar, \"I knew that\nday, when Doeg the Edomite was there,\nthat he would surely tell Saul. I have\ncaused the death of all the persons of\nyour father's house.\nStay with me; do not fear. For he who\nseeks my life seeks your life, but with\nme you shall be safe.\"\n23Then they told David, saying,\n\"Look, the Philistines are fighting against\nKeilah, and they are robbing the\nthreshing floors.\"\nTherefore David inquired of the LORD,\nsaying, \"Shall I go and attack these\nPhilistines?\" And the LORD said to\nDavid, \"Go and attack the Philistines,\nand save Keilah.\"\nBut David's men said to him, \"Look, we\nare afraid here in Judah. How much\nmore then if we go to Keilah against the\narmies of the Philistines?\"\nThen David inquired of the LORD once\nagain. And the LORD answered him and\nsaid, \"Arise, go down to Keilah. For I will\ndeliver the Philistines into your hand.\"\nAnd David and his men went to Keilah\nand fought with the Philistines, struck\nthem with a mighty blow, and took away\ntheir livestock. So David saved the\ninhabitants of Keilah.\nNow it happened, when Abiathar the\nson of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah,\nthat he went down with an ephod in his\nhand.\nSaul sought him every day, but God did\nnot deliver him into his hand.\nAnd Saul was told that David had gone\nto Keilah. So Saul said, \"God has\ndelivered him into my hand, for he has\nshut himself in by entering a town that\nhas gates and bars.\"\nThen Saul called all the people together\nfor war, to go down to Keilah to besiege\nDavid and his men.\nSo David saw that Saul had come out\nto seek his life. And David was in the\nWilderness of Ziph in a forest.\nThen Jonathan, Saul's son, arose and\nwent to David in the woods and\nstrengthened his hand in God.\nWhen David knew that Saul plotted evil\nagainst him, he said to Abiathar the\npriest, \"Bring the ephod here.\"\nAnd he said to him, \"Do not fear, for\nthe hand of Saul my father shall not find\nyou. You shall be king over Israel, and I\nshall be next to you. Even my father\nSaul knows that.\"\nThen David said, \"O LORD God of\nIsrael, Your servant has certainly heard\nthat Saul seeks to come to Keilah to\ndestroy the city for my sake.\nSo the two of them made a covenant\nbefore the LORD. And David stayed in\nthe woods, and Jonathan went to his\nown house.\nWill the men of Keilah deliver me into\nhis hand? Will Saul come down, as Your\nservant has heard? O LORD God of\nIsrael, I pray, tell Your servant.\" And the\nLORD said, \"He will come down.\"\nThen the Ziphites came up to Saul at\nGibeah, saying, \"Is David not hiding with\nus in strongholds in the woods, in the hill\nof Hachilah, which is on the south of\nJeshimon?\nThen David said, \"Will the men of\nKeilah deliver me and my men into the\nhand of Saul?\" And the LORD said,\n\"They will deliver you.\"\nNow therefore, O king, come down\naccording to all the desire of your soul to\ncome down; and our part shall be to\ndeliver him into the king's hand.\"\nSo David and his men, about six\nhundred, arose and departed from\nKeilah and went wherever they could go.\nThen it was told Saul that David had\nescaped from Keilah; so he halted the\nexpedition.\nAnd David stayed in strongholds in the\nwilderness, and remained in the\nmountains in the Wilderness of Ziph.\nAnd Saul said, \"Blessed are you of the\nLORD, for you have compassion on me.\nPlease go and find out for sure, and\nsee the place where his hideout is, and\nwho has seen him there. For I am told\nhe is very crafty.\nSee therefore, and take knowledge of\nall the lurking places where he hides;\nand come back to me with certainty, and\nI will go with you. And it shall be, if he is\nin the land, that I will search for him\nthroughout all the clans of Judah.\"\nThen Saul took three thousand chosen\nmen from all Israel, and went to seek\nDavid and his men on the Rocks of the\nWild Goats.\nSo they arose and went to Ziph before\nSaul. But David and his men were in the\nWilderness of Maon, in the plain on the\nsouth of Jeshimon.\nSo he came to the sheepfolds by the\nroad, where there was a cave; and Saul\nwent in to attend to his needs. (David\nand his men were staying in the\nrecesses of the cave.)\nWhen Saul and his men went to seek\nhim, they told David. Therefore he went\ndown to the rock, and stayed in the\nWilderness of Maon. And when Saul\nheard that, he pursued David in the\nWilderness of Maon.\nThen Saul went on one side of the\nmountain, and David and his men on the\nother side of the mountain. So David\nmade haste to get away from Saul, for\nSaul and his men were encircling David\nand his men to take them.\nThen the men of David said to him,\n\"This is the day of which the LORD said\nto you, \"Behold, I will deliver your enemy\ninto your hand, that you may do to him\nas it seems good to you.\"' And David\narose and secretly cut off a corner of\nSaul's robe.\nNow it happened afterward that David's\nheart troubled him because he had cut\nSaul's robe.\nBut a messenger came to Saul, saying,\n\"Hurry and come, for the Philistines\nhave invaded the land!\"\nAnd he said to his men, \"The LORD\nforbid that I should do this thing to my\nmaster, the LORD's anointed, to stretch\nout my hand against him, seeing he is\nthe anointed of the LORD.\"\nTherefore Saul returned from pursuing\nDavid, and went against the Philistines;\nso they called that place the Rock of\nEscape.\nSo David restrained his servants with\nthese words, and did not allow them to\nrise against Saul. And Saul got up from\nthe cave and went on his way.\nThen David went up from there and\ndwelt in strongholds at En Gedi.\n24Now it happened, when Saul had\nreturned from following the Philistines,\nthat it was told him, saying, \"Take note!\nDavid is in the Wilderness of En Gedi.\"\nDavid also arose afterward, went out of\nthe cave, and called out to Saul, saying,\n\"My lord the king!\" And when Saul\nlooked behind him, David stooped with\nhis face to the earth, and bowed down.\nAnd David said to Saul: \"Why do you\nlisten to the words of men who say,\n\"Indeed David seeks your harm'?\nLook, this day your eyes have seen\nthat the LORD delivered you today into\nmy hand in the cave, and someone\nurged me to kill you. But my eye spared\nyou, and I said, \"I will not stretch out my\nhand against my lord, for he is the\nLORD's anointed.'\nMoreover, my father, see! Yes, see the\ncorner of your robe in my hand! For in\nthat I cut off the corner of your robe, and\ndid not kill you, know and see that there\nis neither evil nor rebellion in my hand,\nand I have not sinned against you. Yet\nyou hunt my life to take it.\nLet the LORD judge between you and\nme, and let the LORD avenge me on\nyou. But my hand shall not be against\nyou.\nAnd you have shown this day how you\nhave dealt well with me; for when the\nLORD delivered me into your hand, you\ndid not kill me.\nFor if a man finds his enemy, will he let\nhim get away safely? Therefore may the\nLORD reward you with good for what\nyou have done to me this day.\nAnd now I know indeed that you shall\nsurely be king, and that the kingdom of\nIsrael shall be established in your hand.\nTherefore swear now to me by the\nLORD that you will not cut off my\ndescendants after me, and that you will\nnot destroy my name from my father's\nhouse.\"\nAs the proverb of the ancients says,\n\"Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.'\nBut my hand shall not be against you.\nAfter whom has the king of Israel\ncome out? Whom do you pursue? A\ndead dog? A flea?\nTherefore let the LORD be judge, and\njudge between you and me, and see\nand plead my case, and deliver me out\nof your hand.\"\nSo it was, when David had finished\nspeaking these words to Saul, that Saul\nsaid, \"Is this your voice, my son David?\"\nAnd Saul lifted up his voice and wept.\nThen he said to David: \"You are more\nrighteous than I; for you have rewarded\nme with good, whereas I have rewarded\nyou with evil.\nSo David swore to Saul. And Saul\nwent home, but David and his men went\nup to the stronghold.\n25Then Samuel died; and the\nIsraelites\ngathered\ntogether\nand\nlamented for him, and buried him at his\nhome in Ramah. And David arose and\nwent down to the Wilderness of Paran.\nNow there was a man in Maon whose\nbusiness was in Carmel, and the man\nwas very rich. He had three thousand\nsheep and a thousand goats. And he\nwas shearing his sheep in Carmel.\nThe name of the man was Nabal, and\nthe name of his wife Abigail. And she\nwas a woman of good understanding\nand beautiful appearance; but the man\nwas harsh and evil in his doings. He\nwas of the house of Caleb.\nWhen David heard in the wilderness\nthat Nabal was shearing his sheep,\nSo David's young men turned on their\nheels and went back; and they came\nand told him all these words.\nDavid sent ten young men; and David\nsaid to the young men, \"Go up to\nCarmel, go to Nabal, and greet him in\nmy name.\nAnd thus you shall say to him who lives\nin prosperity: \"Peace be to you, peace to\nyour house, and peace to all that you\nhave!\nNow I have heard that you have\nshearers. Your shepherds were with us,\nand we did not hurt them, nor was there\nanything missing from them all the while\nthey were in Carmel.\nAsk your young men, and they will tell\nyou. Therefore let my young men find\nfavor in your eyes, for we come on a\nfeast day. Please give whatever comes\nto your hand to your servants and to\nyour son David.\"'\nThen David said to his men, \"Every\nman gird on his sword.\" So every man\ngirded on his sword, and David also\ngirded on his sword. And about four\nhundred men went with David, and two\nhundred stayed with the supplies.\nNow one of the young men told Abigail,\nNabal's wife, saying, \"Look, David sent\nmessengers from the wilderness to\ngreet our master; and he reviled them.\nBut the men were very good to us, and\nwe were not hurt, nor did we miss\nanything as long as we accompanied\nthem, when we were in the fields.\nThey were a wall to us both by night\nand day, all the time we were with them\nkeeping the sheep.\nSo when David's young men came,\nthey spoke to Nabal according to all\nthese words in the name of David, and\nwaited.\nNow therefore, know and consider\nwhat you will do, for harm is determined\nagainst our master and against all his\nhousehold. For he is such a scoundrel\nthat one cannot speak to him.\"\nThen\nNabal\nanswered\nDavid's\nservants, and said, \"Who is David, and\nwho is the son of Jesse? There are\nmany servants nowadays who break\naway each one from his master.\nShall I then take my bread and my\nwater and my meat that I have killed for\nmy shearers, and give it to men when I\ndo not know where they are from?\"\nThen Abigail made haste and took two\nhundred loaves of bread, two skins of\nwine, five sheep already dressed, five\nseahs of roasted grain, one hundred\nclusters of raisins, and two hundred\ncakes of figs, and loaded them on\ndonkeys.\nAnd she said to her servants, \"Go on\nbefore me; see, I am coming after you.\"\nBut she did not tell her husband Nabal.\nSo it was, as she rode on the donkey,\nthat she went down under cover of the\nhill; and there were David and his men,\ncoming down toward her, and she met\nthem.\nAnd now this present which your\nmaidservant has brought to my lord, let\nit be given to the young men who follow\nmy lord.\nNow David had said, \"Surely in vain I\nhave protected all that this fellow has in\nthe wilderness, so that nothing was\nmissed of all that belongs to him. And\nhe has repaid me evil for good.\nPlease forgive the trespass of your\nmaidservant. For the LORD will certainly\nmake for my lord an enduring house,\nbecause my lord fights the battles of the\nLORD, and evil is not found in you\nthroughout your days.\nMay God do so, and more also, to the\nenemies of David, if I leave one male of\nall who belong to him by morning light.\"\nNow when Abigail saw David, she\ndismounted quickly from the donkey, fell\non her face before David, and bowed\ndown to the ground.\nSo she fell at his feet and said: \"On me,\nmy lord, on me let this iniquity be! And\nplease let your maidservant speak in\nyour ears, and hear the words of your\nmaidservant.\nPlease, let not my lord regard this\nscoundrel Nabal. For as his name is, so\nis he: Nabal is his name, and folly is with\nhim! But I, your maidservant, did not see\nthe young men of my lord whom you\nsent.\nNow therefore, my lord, as the LORD\nlives and as your soul lives, since the\nLORD has held you back from coming\nto bloodshed and from avenging\nyourself with your own hand, now then,\nlet your enemies and those who seek\nharm for my lord be as Nabal.\nYet a man has risen to pursue you and\nseek your life, but the life of my lord\nshall be bound in the bundle of the living\nwith the LORD your God; and the lives\nof your enemies He shall sling out, as\nfrom the pocket of a sling.\nAnd it shall come to pass, when the\nLORD has done for my lord according to\nall the good that He has spoken\nconcerning you, and has appointed you\nruler over Israel,\nthat this will be no grief to you, nor\noffense of heart to my lord, either that\nyou have shed blood without cause, or\nthat my lord has avenged himself. But\nwhen the LORD has dealt well with my\nlord, then remember your maidservant.\"\nThen David said to Abigail: \"Blessed is\nthe LORD God of Israel, who sent you\nthis day to meet me!\nAnd blessed is your advice and\nblessed are you, because you have kept\nme this day from coming to bloodshed\nand from avenging myself with my own\nhand.\nFor indeed, as the LORD God of Israel\nlives, who has kept me back from\nhurting you, unless you had hurried and\ncome to meet me, surely by morning\nlight no males would have been left to\nNabal!\"\nSo David received from her hand what\nshe had brought him, and said to her,\n\"Go up in peace to your house. See, I\nhave heeded your voice and respected\nyour person.\"\nNow Abigail went to Nabal, and there\nhe was, holding a feast in his house, like\nthe feast of a king. And Nabal's heart\nwas merry within him, for he was very\ndrunk; therefore she told him nothing,\nlittle or much, until morning light.\nSo it was, in the morning, when the\nwine had gone from Nabal, and his wife\nhad told him these things, that his heart\ndied within him, and he became like a\nstone.\nThen it happened, after about ten days,\nthat the LORD struck Nabal, and he\ndied.\nSo when David heard that Nabal was\ndead, he said, \"Blessed be the LORD,\nwho has pleaded the cause of my\nreproach from the hand of Nabal, and\nhas kept His servant from evil! For the\nLORD has returned the wickedness of\nNabal on his own head.\" And David sent\nand proposed to Abigail, to take her as\nhis wife.\nWhen the servants of David had come\nto Abigail at Carmel, they spoke to her\nsaying, \"David sent us to you, to ask you\nto become his wife.\"\nThen she arose, bowed her face to the\nearth, and said, \"Here is your\nmaidservant, a servant to wash the feet\nof the servants of my lord.\"\nSo Abigail rose in haste and rode on a\ndonkey, attended by five of her\nmaidens; and she followed the\nmessengers of David, and became his\nwife.\nDavid also took Ahinoam of Jezreel,\nand so both of them were his wives.\nBut Saul had given Michal his\ndaughter, David's wife, to Palti the son\nof Laish, who was from Gallim.\n26Now the Ziphites came to Saul at\nGibeah, saying, \"Is David not hiding in\nthe hill of Hachilah, opposite Jeshimon?\"\nThen Saul arose and went down to the\nWilderness of Ziph, having three\nthousand chosen men of Israel with him,\nto seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph.\nAnd Saul encamped in the hill of\nHachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon,\nby the road. But David stayed in the\nwilderness, and he saw that Saul came\nafter him into the wilderness.\nDavid therefore sent out spies, and\nunderstood that Saul had indeed come.\nSo David arose and came to the place\nwhere Saul had encamped. And David\nsaw the place where Saul lay, and\nAbner the son of Ner, the commander of\nhis army. Now Saul lay within the camp,\nwith the people encamped all around\nhim.\nbecause a deep sleep from the LORD\nhad fallen on them.\nThen David answered, and said to\nAhimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the\nson of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying,\n\"Who will go down with me to Saul in the\ncamp?\" And Abishai said, \"I will go down\nwith you.\"\nSo David and Abishai came to the\npeople by night; and there Saul lay\nsleeping within the camp, with his spear\nstuck in the ground by his head. And\nAbner and the people lay all around him.\nThen Abishai said to David, \"God has\ndelivered your enemy into your hand\nthis day. Now therefore, please, let me\nstrike him at once with the spear, right to\nthe earth; and I will not have to strike\nhim a second time!\"\nBut David said to Abishai, \"Do not\ndestroy him; for who can stretch out his\nhand against the LORD's anointed, and\nbe guiltless?\"\nDavid said furthermore, \"As the LORD\nlives, the LORD shall strike him, or his\nday shall come to die, or he shall go out\nto battle and perish.\nThe LORD forbid that I should stretch\nout my hand against the LORD's\nanointed. But please, take now the\nspear and the jug of water that are by\nhis head, and let us go.\"\nSo David took the spear and the jug of\nwater by Saul's head, and they got\naway; and no man saw or knew it or\nawoke. For they were all asleep,\nNow David went over to the other side,\nand stood on the top of a hill afar off, a\ngreat distance being between them.\nAnd David called out to the people and\nto Abner the son of Ner, saying, \"Do you\nnot answer, Abner?\" Then Abner\nanswered and said, \"Who are you,\ncalling out to the king?\"\nSo David said to Abner, \"Are you not a\nman? And who is like you in Israel? Why\nthen have you not guarded your lord the\nking? For one of the people came in to\ndestroy your lord the king.\nThis thing that you have done is not\ngood. As the LORD lives, you deserve\nto die, because you have not guarded\nyour master, the LORD's anointed. And\nnow see where the king's spear is, and\nthe jug of water that was by his head.\"\nThen Saul knew David's voice, and\nsaid, \"Is that your voice, my son David?\"\nDavid said, \"It is my voice, my lord, O\nking.\"\nAnd he said, \"Why does my lord thus\npursue his servant? For what have I\ndone, or what evil is in my hand?\nNow therefore, please, let my lord the\nking hear the words of his servant: If the\nLORD has stirred you up against me, let\nHim accept an offering. But if it is the\nchildren of men, may they be cursed\nbefore the LORD, for they have driven\nme out this day from sharing in the\ninheritance of the LORD, saying, \"Go,\nserve other gods.'\nof me, to seek me anymore in any part\nof Israel. So I shall escape out of his\nhand.\"\nSo now, do not let my blood fall to the\nearth before the face of the LORD. For\nthe king of Israel has come out to seek a\nflea, as when one hunts a partridge in\nthe mountains.\"\nThen David arose and went over with\nthe six hundred men who were with him\nto Achish the son of Maoch, king of\nGath.\nThen Saul said, \"I have sinned. Return,\nmy son David. For I will harm you no\nmore, because my life was precious in\nyour eyes this day. Indeed I have played\nthe fool and erred exceedingly.\"\nSo David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he\nand his men, each man with his\nhousehold, and David with his two wives,\nAhinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail\nthe Carmelitess, Nabal's widow.\nAnd David answered and said, \"Here\nis the king's spear. Let one of the young\nmen come over and get it.\nAnd it was told Saul that David had fled\nto Gath; so he sought him no more.\nMay the LORD repay every man for\nhis righteousness and his faithfulness;\nfor the LORD delivered you into my\nhand today, but I would not stretch out\nmy hand against the LORD's anointed.\nThen David said to Achish, \"If I have\nnow found favor in your eyes, let them\ngive me a place in some town in the\ncountry, that I may dwell there. For why\nshould your servant dwell in the royal\ncity with you?\"\nAnd indeed, as your life was valued\nmuch this day in my eyes, so let my life\nbe valued much in the eyes of the\nLORD, and let Him deliver me out of all\ntribulation.\"\nThen Saul said to David, \"May you be\nblessed, my son David! You shall both\ndo great things and also still prevail.\" So\nDavid went on his way, and Saul\nreturned to his place.\n27And David said in his heart, \"Now\nI shall perish someday by the hand of\nSaul. There is nothing better for me than\nthat I should speedily escape to the land\nof the Philistines; and Saul will despair\nSo Achish gave him Ziklag that day.\nTherefore Ziklag has belonged to the\nkings of Judah to this day.\nNow the time that David dwelt in the\ncountry of the Philistines was one full\nyear and four months.\nAnd David and his men went up and\nraided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and\nthe Amalekites. For those nations were\nthe inhabitants of the land from of old,\nas you go to Shur, even as far as the\nland of Egypt.\nWhenever David attacked the land, he\nleft neither man nor woman alive, but\ntook away the sheep, the oxen, the\ndonkeys, the camels, and the apparel,\nand returned and came to Achish.\nThen Achish would say, \"Where have\nyou made a raid today?\" And David\nwould say, \"Against the southern area of\nJudah, or against the southern area of\nthe Jerahmeelites, or against the\nsouthern area of the Kenites.\"\nThen the Philistines gathered together,\nand came and encamped at Shunem.\nSo Saul gathered all Israel together, and\nthey encamped at Gilboa.\nWhen Saul saw the army of the\nPhilistines, he was afraid, and his heart\ntrembled greatly.\nDavid would save neither man nor\nwoman alive, to bring news to Gath,\nsaying, \"Lest they should inform on us,\nsaying, \"Thus David did.\"' And thus was\nhis behavior all the time he dwelt in the\ncountry of the Philistines.\nSo Achish believed David, saying, \"He\nhas made his people Israel utterly abhor\nhim; therefore he will be my servant\nforever.\"\n28Now it happened in those days\nthat the Philistines gathered their armies\ntogether for war, to fight with Israel. And\nAchish said to David, \"You assuredly\nknow that you will go out with me to\nbattle, you and your men.\"\nSo David said to Achish, \"Surely you\nknow what your servant can do.\" And\nAchish said to David, \"Therefore I will\nmake you one of my chief guardians\nforever.\"\nNow Samuel had died, and all Israel\nhad lamented for him and buried him in\nRamah, in his own city. And Saul had\nput the mediums and the spiritists out of\nthe land.\nAnd when Saul inquired of the LORD,\nthe LORD did not answer him, either by\ndreams or by Urim or by the prophets.\nThen Saul said to his servants, \"Find\nme a woman who is a medium, that I\nmay go to her and inquire of her.\" And\nhis servants said to him, \"In fact, there is\na woman who is a medium at En Dor.\"\nSo Saul disguised himself and put on\nother clothes, and he went, and two\nmen with him; and they came to the\nwoman by night. And he said, \"Please\nconduct a s^eaance for me, and bring\nup for me the one I shall name to you.\"\nThen the woman said to him, \"Look,\nyou know what Saul has done, how he\nhas cut off the mediums and the\nspiritists from the land. Why then do you\nlay a snare for my life, to cause me to\ndie?\"\nAnd Saul swore to her by the LORD,\nsaying, \"As the LORD lives, no\npunishment shall come upon you for this\nthing.\"\nThen the woman said, \"Whom shall I\nbring up for you?\" And he said, \"Bring\nup Samuel for me.\"\nWhen the woman saw Samuel, she\ncried out with a loud voice. And the\nwoman spoke to Saul, saying, \"Why\nhave you deceived me? For you are\nSaul!\"\nMoreover the LORD will also deliver\nIsrael with you into the hand of the\nPhilistines. And tomorrow you and your\nsons will be with me. The LORD will\nalso deliver the army of Israel into the\nhand of the Philistines.\"\nAnd the king said to her, \"Do not be\nafraid. What did you see?\" And the\nwoman said to Saul, \"I saw a spirit\nascending out of the earth.\"\nSo he said to her, \"What is his form?\"\nAnd she said, \"An old man is coming up,\nand he is covered with a mantle.\" And\nSaul perceived that it was Samuel, and\nhe stooped with his face to the ground\nand bowed down.\nNow Samuel said to Saul, \"Why have\nyou disturbed me by bringing me up?\"\nAnd Saul answered, \"I am deeply\ndistressed; for the Philistines make war\nagainst me, and God has departed from\nme and does not answer me anymore,\nneither by prophets nor by dreams.\nTherefore I have called you, that you\nmay reveal to me what I should do.\"\nImmediately Saul fell full length on the\nground, and was dreadfully afraid\nbecause of the words of Samuel. And\nthere was no strength in him, for he had\neaten no food all day or all night.\nAnd the woman came to Saul and saw\nthat he was severely troubled, and said\nto him, \"Look, your maidservant has\nobeyed your voice, and I have put my\nlife in my hands and heeded the words\nwhich you spoke to me.\nNow therefore, please, heed also the\nvoice of your maidservant, and let me\nset a piece of bread before you; and eat,\nthat you may have strength when you\ngo on your way.\"\nThen Samuel said: \"So why do you\nask me, seeing the LORD has departed\nfrom you and has become your enemy?\nBut he refused and said, \"I will not\neat.\" So his servants, together with the\nwoman, urged him; and he heeded their\nvoice. Then he arose from the ground\nand sat on the bed.\nAnd the LORD has done for Himself\nas He spoke by me. For the LORD has\ntorn the kingdom out of your hand and\ngiven it to your neighbor, David.\nNow the woman had a fatted calf in\nthe house, and she hastened to kill it.\nAnd she took flour and kneaded it, and\nbaked unleavened bread from it.\nBecause you did not obey the voice of\nthe LORD nor execute His fierce wrath\nupon Amalek, therefore the LORD has\ndone this thing to you this day.\nSo she brought it before Saul and his\nservants, and they ate. Then they rose\nand went away that night.\n29Then the Philistines gathered\ntogether all their armies at Aphek, and\nthe Israelites encamped by a fountain\nwhich is in Jezreel.\nof your coming to me. Nevertheless the\nlords do not favor you.\nTherefore return now, and go in peace,\nthat you may not displease the lords of\nthe Philistines.\"\nAnd the lords of the Philistines passed\nin review by hundreds and by thousands,\nbut David and his men passed in review\nat the rear with Achish.\nThen the princes of the Philistines said,\n\"What are these Hebrews doing here?\"\nAnd Achish said to the princes of the\nPhilistines, \"Is this not David, the\nservant of Saul king of Israel, who has\nbeen with me these days, or these\nyears? And to this day I have found no\nfault in him since he defected to me.\"\nSo David said to Achish, \"But what\nhave I done? And to this day what have\nyou found in your servant as long as I\nhave been with you, that I may not go\nand fight against the enemies of my lord\nthe king?\"\nThen Achish answered and said to\nDavid, \"I know that you are as good in\nmy sight as an angel of God;\nnevertheless the princes of the\nPhilistines have said, \"He shall not go\nup with us to the battle.'\nBut the princes of the Philistines were\nangry with him; so the princes of the\nPhilistines said to him, \"Make this fellow\nreturn, that he may go back to the place\nwhich you have appointed for him, and\ndo not let him go down with us to battle,\nlest in the battle he become our\nadversary. For with what could he\nreconcile himself to his master, if not\nwith the heads of these men?\nNow therefore, rise early in the\nmorning with your master's servants\nwho have come with you. And as soon\nas you are up early in the morning and\nhave light, depart.\"\nSo David and his men rose early to\ndepart in the morning, to return to the\nland of the Philistines. And the\nPhilistines went up to Jezreel.\nIs this not David, of whom they sang to\none another in dances, saying: \"Saul\nhas slain his thousands, And David his\nten thousands'?\"\nThen Achish called David and said to\nhim, \"Surely, as the LORD lives, you\nhave been upright, and your going out\nand your coming in with me in the army\nis good in my sight. For to this day I\nhave not found evil in you since the day\n30Now it happened, when David and\nhis men came to Ziklag, on the third day,\nthat the Amalekites had invaded the\nSouth and Ziklag, attacked Ziklag and\nburned it with fire,\nand had taken captive the women and\nthose who were there, from small to\ngreat; they did not kill anyone, but\ncarried them away and went their way.\nSo David and his men came to the city,\nand there it was, burned with fire; and\ntheir wives, their sons, and their\ndaughters had been taken captive.\nThen they found an Egyptian in the\nfield, and brought him to David; and they\ngave him bread and he ate, and they let\nhim drink water.\nThen David and the people who were\nwith him lifted up their voices and wept,\nuntil they had no more power to weep.\nAnd David's two wives, Ahinoam the\nJezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of\nNabal the Carmelite, had been taken\ncaptive.\nNow David was greatly distressed, for\nthe people spoke of stoning him,\nbecause the soul of all the people was\ngrieved, every man for his sons and his\ndaughters. But David strengthened\nhimself in the LORD his God.\nThen David said to Abiathar the priest,\nAhimelech's son, \"Please bring the\nephod here to me.\" And Abiathar\nbrought the ephod to David.\nAnd they gave him a piece of a cake of\nfigs and two clusters of raisins. So when\nhe had eaten, his strength came back to\nhim; for he had eaten no bread nor\ndrunk water for three days and three\nnights.\nThen David said to him, \"To whom do\nyou belong, and where are you from?\"\nAnd he said, \"I am a young man from\nEgypt, servant of an Amalekite; and my\nmaster left me behind, because three\ndays ago I fell sick.\nWe made an invasion of the southern\narea of the Cherethites, in the territory\nwhich belongs to Judah, and of the\nsouthern area of Caleb; and we burned\nZiklag with fire.\"\nSo David inquired of the LORD, saying,\n\"Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I\novertake them?\" And He answered him,\n\"Pursue, for you shall surely overtake\nthem and without fail recover all.\"\nAnd David said to him, \"Can you take\nme down to this troop?\" So he said,\n\"Swear to me by God that you will\nneither kill me nor deliver me into the\nhands of my master, and I will take you\ndown to this troop.\"\nSo David went, he and the six hundred\nmen who were with him, and came to\nthe Brook Besor, where those stayed\nwho were left behind.\nBut David pursued, he and four\nhundred men; for two hundred stayed\nbehind, who were so weary that they\ncould not cross the Brook Besor.\nAnd when he had brought him down,\nthere they were, spread out over all the\nland, eating and drinking and dancing,\nbecause of all the great spoil which they\nhad taken from the land of the\nPhilistines and from the land of Judah.\nThen David attacked them from\ntwilight until the evening of the next day.\nNot a man of them escaped, except four\nhundred young men who rode on\ncamels and fled.\nSo David recovered all that the\nAmalekites had carried away, and David\nrescued his two wives.\nSo it was, from that day forward; he\nmade it a statute and an ordinance for\nIsrael to this day.\nAnd nothing of theirs was lacking,\neither small or great, sons or daughters,\nspoil or anything which they had taken\nfrom them; David recovered all.\nNow when David came to Ziklag, he\nsent some of the spoil to the elders of\nJudah, to his friends, saying, \"Here is a\npresent for you from the spoil of the\nenemies of the LORD\"--\nThen David took all the flocks and\nherds they had driven before those\nother livestock, and said, \"This is\nDavid's spoil.\"\nto those who were in Bethel, those\nwho were in Ramoth of the South, those\nwho were in Jattir,\nNow David came to the two hundred\nmen who had been so weary that they\ncould not follow David, whom they also\nhad made to stay at the Brook Besor.\nSo they went out to meet David and to\nmeet the people who were with him.\nAnd when David came near the people,\nhe greeted them.\nthose who were in Aroer, those who\nwere in Siphmoth, those who were in\nEshtemoa,\nThen all the wicked and worthless men\nof those who went with David answered\nand said, \"Because they did not go with\nus, we will not give them any of the spoil\nthat we have recovered, except for\nevery man's wife and children, that they\nmay lead them away and depart.\"\nthose who were in Rachal, those who\nwere in the cities of the Jerahmeelites,\nthose who were in the cities of the\nKenites,\nthose who were in Hormah, those who\nwere in Chorashan, those who were in\nAthach,\nthose who were in Hebron, and to all\nthe places where David himself and his\nmen were accustomed to rove.\nBut David said, \"My brethren, you shall\nnot do so with what the LORD has given\nus, who has preserved us and delivered\ninto our hand the troop that came\nagainst us.\n31Now the Philistines fought against\nIsrael; and the men of Israel fled from\nbefore the Philistines, and fell slain on\nMount Gilboa.\nFor who will heed you in this matter?\nBut as his part is who goes down to the\nbattle, so shall his part be who stays by\nthe supplies; they shall share alike.\"\nThen the Philistines followed hard after\nSaul and his sons. And the Philistines\nkilled\nJonathan,\nAbinadab,\nand\nMalchishua, Saul's sons.\nThe battle became fierce against Saul.\nThe archers hit him, and he was\nseverely wounded by the archers.\nSo it happened the next day, when the\nPhilistines came to strip the slain, that\nthey found Saul and his three sons\nfallen on Mount Gilboa.\nThen Saul said to his armorbearer,\n\"Draw your sword, and thrust me\nthrough with it, lest these uncircumcised\nmen come and thrust me through and\nabuse me.\" But his armorbearer would\nnot, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore\nSaul took a sword and fell on it.\nAnd they cut off his head and stripped\noff his armor, and sent word throughout\nthe land of the Philistines, to proclaim it\nin the temple of their idols and among\nthe people.\nAnd when his armorbearer saw that\nSaul was dead, he also fell on his sword,\nand died with him.\nThen they put his armor in the temple\nof the Ashtoreths, and they fastened his\nbody to the wall of Beth Shan.\nSo Saul, his three sons, his\narmorbearer, and all his men died\ntogether that same day.\nNow when the inhabitants of Jabesh\nGilead heard what the Philistines had\ndone to Saul,\nAnd when the men of Israel who were\non the other side of the valley, and\nthose who were on the other side of the\nJordan, saw that the men of Israel had\nfled and that Saul and his sons were\ndead, they forsook the cities and fled;\nand the Philistines came and dwelt in\nthem.\nall the valiant men arose and traveled\nall night, and took the body of Saul and\nthe bodies of his sons from the wall of\nBeth Shan; and they came to Jabesh\nand burned them there.\nThen they took their bones and buried\nthem under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh,\nand fasted seven days.\n2nd Samuel\n1Now it came to pass after the death\nof Saul, when David had returned from\nthe slaughter of the Amalekites, and\nDavid had stayed two days in Ziklag,\non the third day, behold, it happened\nthat a man came from Saul's camp with\nhis clothes torn and dust on his head.\nSo it was, when he came to David, that\nhe fell to the ground and prostrated\nhimself.\nAnd David said to him, \"Where have\nyou come from?\" So he said to him, \"I\nhave escaped from the camp of Israel.\"\nThen David said to him, \"How did the\nmatter go? Please tell me.\" And he\nanswered, \"The people have fled from\nthe battle, many of the people are fallen\nand dead, and Saul and Jonathan his\nson are dead also.\"\nSo David said to the young man who\ntold him, \"How do you know that Saul\nand Jonathan his son are dead?\"\nThen the young man who told him said,\n\"As I happened by chance to be on\nMount Gilboa, there was Saul, leaning\non his spear; and indeed the chariots\nand horsemen followed hard after him.\nNow when he looked behind him, he\nsaw me and called to me. And I\nanswered, \"Here I am.'\nAnd he said to me, \"Who are you?' So I\nanswered him, \"I am an Amalekite.'\nHe said to me again, \"Please stand\nover me and kill me, for anguish has\ncome upon me, but my life still remains\nin me.'\nSo I stood over him and killed him,\nbecause I was sure that he could not\nlive after he had fallen. And I took the\ncrown that was on his head and the\nbracelet that was on his arm, and have\nbrought them here to my lord.\"\nTherefore David took hold of his own\nclothes and tore them, and so did all the\nmen who were with him.\nAnd they mourned and wept and\nfasted until evening for Saul and for\nJonathan his son, for the people of the\nLORD and for the house of Israel,\nbecause they had fallen by the sword.\nThen David said to the young man\nwho told him, \"Where are you from?\"\nAnd he answered, \"I am the son of an\nalien, an Amalekite.\"\nSo David said to him, \"How was it you\nwere not afraid to put forth your hand to\ndestroy the LORD's anointed?\"\nThen David called one of the young\nmen and said, \"Go near, and execute\nhim!\" And he struck him so that he died.\nSo David said to him, \"Your blood is\non your own head, for your own mouth\nhas testified against you, saying, \"I have\nkilled the LORD's anointed.\"'\n\"How the mighty have fallen in the\nmidst of the battle! Jonathan was slain\nin your high places.\nThen David lamented with this\nlamentation over Saul and over\nJonathan his son,\nand he told them to teach the children\nof Judah the Song of the Bow; indeed it\nis written in the Book of Jasher:\nI am distressed for you, my brother\nJonathan; You have been very pleasant\nto me; Your love to me was wonderful,\nSurpassing the love of women.\n\"How the mighty have fallen, And the\nweapons of war perished!\"\n\"The beauty of Israel is slain on your\nhigh places! How the mighty have fallen!\nTell it not in Gath, Proclaim it not in the\nstreets of Ashkelon-- Lest the daughters\nof the Philistines rejoice, Lest the\ndaughters of the uncircumcised triumph.\n2It happened after this that David\ninquired of the LORD, saying, \"Shall I go\nup to any of the cities of Judah?\" And\nthe LORD said to him, \"Go up.\" David\nsaid, \"Where shall I go up?\" And He said,\n\"To Hebron.\"\n\"O mountains of Gilboa, Let there be\nno dew nor rain upon you, Nor fields of\nofferings. For the shield of the mighty is\ncast away there! The shield of Saul, not\nanointed with oil.\nSo David went up there, and his two\nwives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,\nand Abigail the widow of Nabal the\nCarmelite.\nFrom the blood of the slain, From the\nfat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan\ndid not turn back, And the sword of Saul\ndid not return empty.\nAnd David brought up the men who\nwere with him, every man with his\nhousehold. So they dwelt in the cities of\nHebron.\n\"Saul and Jonathan were beloved and\npleasant in their lives, And in their death\nthey were not divided; They were swifter\nthan eagles, They were stronger than\nlions.\nThen the men of Judah came, and\nthere they anointed David king over the\nhouse of Judah. And they told David,\nsaying, \"The men of Jabesh Gilead were\nthe ones who buried Saul.\"\n\"O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,\nWho clothed you in scarlet, with luxury;\nWho put ornaments of gold on your\napparel.\nSo David sent messengers to the men\nof Jabesh Gilead, and said to them,\n\"You are blessed of the LORD, for you\nhave shown this kindness to your lord,\nto Saul, and have buried him.\nAnd now may the LORD show kindness\nand truth to you. I also will repay you\nthis kindness, because you have done\nthis thing.\nNow therefore, let your hands be\nstrengthened, and be valiant; for your\nmaster Saul is dead, and also the house\nof Judah has anointed me king over\nthem.\"\nBut Abner the son of Ner, commander\nof Saul's army, took Ishbosheth the son\nof Saul and brought him over to\nMahanaim;\nbefore us.\" And Joab said, \"Let them\narise.\"\nSo they arose and went over by\nnumber,\ntwelve\nfrom\nBenjamin,\nfollowers of Ishbosheth the son of Saul,\nand twelve from the servants of David.\nAnd each one grasped his opponent\nby the head and thrust his sword in his\nopponent's side; so they fell down\ntogether. Therefore that place was\ncalled the Field of Sharp Swords, which\nis in Gibeon.\nand he made him king over Gilead,\nover the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over\nEphraim, over Benjamin, and over all\nIsrael.\nSo there was a very fierce battle that\nday, and Abner and the men of Israel\nwere beaten before the servants of\nDavid.\nIshbosheth, Saul's son, was forty\nyears old when he began to reign over\nIsrael, and he reigned two years. Only\nthe house of Judah followed David.\nNow the three sons of Zeruiah were\nthere: Joab and Abishai and Asahel.\nAnd Asahel was as fleet of foot as a wild\ngazelle.\nAnd the time that David was king in\nHebron over the house of Judah was\nseven years and six months.\nSo Asahel pursued Abner, and in\ngoing he did not turn to the right hand or\nto the left from following Abner.\nNow Abner the son of Ner, and the\nservants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul,\nwent out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.\nThen Abner looked behind him and\nsaid, \"Are you Asahel?\" He answered, \"I\nam.\"\nAnd Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the\nservants of David, went out and met\nthem by the pool of Gibeon. So they sat\ndown, one on one side of the pool and\nthe other on the other side of the pool.\nAnd Abner said to him, \"Turn aside to\nyour right hand or to your left, and lay\nhold on one of the young men and take\nhis armor for yourself.\" But Asahel\nwould not turn aside from following him.\nThen Abner said to Joab, \"Let the\nyoung men now arise and compete\nSo Abner said again to Asahel, \"Turn\naside from following me. Why should I\nstrike you to the ground? How then\ncould I face your brother Joab?\"\nHowever, he refused to turn aside.\nTherefore Abner struck him in the\nstomach with the blunt end of the spear,\nso that the spear came out of his back;\nand he fell down there and died on the\nspot. So it was that as many as came to\nthe place where Asahel fell down and\ndied, stood still.\npeople together, there were missing of\nDavid's servants nineteen men and\nAsahel.\nBut the servants of David had struck\ndown, of Benjamin and Abner's men,\nthree hundred and sixty men who died.\nJoab and Abishai also pursued Abner.\nAnd the sun was going down when they\ncame to the hill of Ammah, which is\nbefore Giah by the road to the\nWilderness of Gibeon.\nNow the children of Benjamin gathered\ntogether behind Abner and became a\nunit, and took their stand on top of a hill.\nThen Abner called to Joab and said,\n\"Shall the sword devour forever? Do you\nnot know that it will be bitter in the latter\nend? How long will it be then until you\ntell the people to return from pursuing\ntheir brethren?\"\nAnd Joab said, \"As God lives, unless\nyou had spoken, surely then by morning\nall the people would have given up\npursuing their brethren.\"\nSo Joab blew a trumpet; and all the\npeople stood still and did not pursue\nIsrael anymore, nor did they fight\nanymore.\nThen Abner and his men went on all\nthat night through the plain, crossed\nover the Jordan, and went through all\nBithron; and they came to Mahanaim.\nSo Joab returned from pursuing Abner.\nAnd when he had gathered all the\nThen they took up Asahel and buried\nhim in his father's tomb, which was in\nBethlehem. And Joab and his men went\nall night, and they came to Hebron at\ndaybreak.\n3Now there was a long war between\nthe house of Saul and the house of\nDavid. But David grew stronger and\nstronger, and the house of Saul grew\nweaker and weaker.\nSons were born to David in Hebron: His\nfirstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam the\nJezreelitess;\nhis second, Chileab, by Abigail the\nwidow of Nabal the Carmelite; the third,\nAbsalom the son of Maacah, the\ndaughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;\nthe fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith;\nthe fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;\nand the sixth, Ithream, by David's wife\nEglah. These were born to David in\nHebron.\nNow it was so, while there was war\nbetween the house of Saul and the\nhouse of David, that Abner was\nstrengthening his hold on the house of\nSaul.\nAnd Saul had a concubine, whose\nname was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah.\nSo Ishbosheth said to Abner, \"Why have\nyou gone in to my father's concubine?\"\nThen Abner became very angry at the\nwords of Ishbosheth, and said, \"Am I a\ndog's head that belongs to Judah?\nToday I show loyalty to the house of\nSaul your father, to his brothers, and to\nhis friends, and have not delivered you\ninto the hand of David; and you charge\nme today with a fault concerning this\nwoman?\nMay God do so to Abner, and more\nalso, if I do not do for David as the\nLORD has sworn to him-10\nto transfer the kingdom from the house\nof Saul, and set up the throne of David\nover Israel and over Judah, from Dan to\nBeersheba.\"\nmyself for a hundred foreskins of the\nPhilistines.\"\nAnd Ishbosheth sent and took her from\nher husband, from Paltiel the son of\nLaish.\nThen her husband went along with her\nto Bahurim, weeping behind her. So\nAbner said to him, \"Go, return!\" And he\nreturned.\nNow Abner had communicated with\nthe elders of Israel, saying, \"In time past\nyou were seeking for David to be king\nover you.\nNow then, do it! For the LORD has\nspoken of David, saying, \"By the hand of\nMy servant David, I will save My people\nIsrael from the hand of the Philistines\nand the hand of all their enemies.\"'\nAnd he could not answer Abner\nanother word, because he feared him.\nThen Abner sent messengers on his\nbehalf to David, saying, \"Whose is the\nland?\" saying also, \"Make your covenant\nwith me, and indeed my hand shall be\nwith you to bring all Israel to you.\"\nAnd David said, \"Good, I will make a\ncovenant with you. But one thing I\nrequire of you: you shall not see my face\nunless you first bring Michal, Saul's\ndaughter, when you come to see my\nface.\"\nSo David sent messengers to\nIshbosheth, Saul's son, saying, \"Give\nme my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to\nAnd Abner also spoke in the hearing of\nBenjamin. Then Abner also went to\nspeak in the hearing of David in Hebron\nall that seemed good to Israel and the\nwhole house of Benjamin.\nSo Abner and twenty men with him\ncame to David at Hebron. And David\nmade a feast for Abner and the men\nwho were with him.\nThen Abner said to David, \"I will arise\nand go, and gather all Israel to my lord\nthe king, that they may make a covenant\nwith you, and that you may reign over all\nthat your heart desires.\" So David sent\nAbner away, and he went in peace.\nAt that moment the servants of David\nand Joab came from a raid and brought\nmuch spoil with them. But Abner was\nnot with David in Hebron, for he had\nsent him away, and he had gone in\npeace.\nSo Joab and Abishai his brother killed\nAbner, because he had killed their\nbrother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.\nWhen Joab and all the troops that\nwere with him had come, they told Joab,\nsaying, \"Abner the son of Ner came to\nthe king, and he sent him away, and he\nhas gone in peace.\"\nThen David said to Joab and to all the\npeople who were with him, \"Tear your\nclothes, gird yourselves with sackcloth,\nand mourn for Abner.\" And King David\nfollowed the coffin.\nThen Joab came to the king and said,\n\"What have you done? Look, Abner\ncame to you; why is it that you sent him\naway, and he has already gone?\nSo they buried Abner in Hebron; and\nthe king lifted up his voice and wept at\nthe grave of Abner, and all the people\nwept.\nSurely you realize that Abner the son\nof Ner came to deceive you, to know\nyour going out and your coming in, and\nto know all that you are doing.\"\nAnd when Joab had gone from David's\npresence, he sent messengers after\nAbner, who brought him back from the\nwell of Sirah. But David did not know it.\nNow when Abner had returned to\nHebron, Joab took him aside in the gate\nto speak with him privately, and there\nstabbed him in the stomach, so that he\ndied for the blood of Asahel his brother.\nAnd the king sang a lament over\nAbner and said: \"Should Abner die as a\nfool dies?\nYour hands were not bound Nor your\nfeet put into fetters; As a man falls\nbefore wicked men, so you fell.\" Then all\nthe people wept over him again.\nAnd when all the people came to\npersuade David to eat food while it was\nstill day, David took an oath, saying,\n\"God do so to me, and more also, if I\ntaste bread or anything else till the sun\ngoes down!\"\nAfterward, when David heard it, he\nsaid, \"My kingdom and I are guiltless\nbefore the LORD forever of the blood of\nAbner the son of Ner.\nLet it rest on the head of Joab and on\nall his father's house; and let there never\nfail to be in the house of Joab one who\nhas a discharge or is a leper, who leans\non a staff or falls by the sword, or who\nlacks bread.\"\nNow all the people took note of it, and\nit pleased them, since whatever the king\ndid pleased all the people.\nFor all the people and all Israel\nunderstood that day that it had not been\nthe king's intent to kill Abner the son of\nNer.\nThen the king said to his servants, \"Do\nyou not know that a prince and a great\nman has fallen this day in Israel?\nAnd I am weak today, though anointed\nking; and these men, the sons of\nZeruiah, are too harsh for me. The\nLORD shall repay the evildoer according\nto his wickedness.\"\nFor when they came into the house, he\nwas lying on his bed in his bedroom;\nthen they struck him and killed him,\nbeheaded him and took his head, and\nwere all night escaping through the plain.\n4When Saul's son heard that Abner\nhad died in Hebron, he lost heart, and\nall Israel was troubled.\nNow Saul's son had two men who were\ncaptains of troops. The name of one\nwas Baanah and the name of the other\nRechab, the sons of Rimmon the\nBeerothite, of the children of Benjamin.\n(For Beeroth also was part of Benjamin,\nbecause the Beerothites fled to Gittaim\nand have been sojourners there until\nthis day.)\nJonathan, Saul's son, had a son who\nwas lame in his feet. He was five years\nold when the news about Saul and\nJonathan came from Jezreel; and his\nnurse took him up and fled. And it\nhappened, as she made haste to flee,\nthat he fell and became lame. His name\nwas Mephibosheth.\nThen the sons of Rimmon the\nBeerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out\nand came at about the heat of the day to\nthe house of Ishbosheth, who was lying\non his bed at noon.\nAnd they came there, all the way into\nthe house, as though to get wheat, and\nthey stabbed him in the stomach. Then\nRechab and Baanah his brother\nescaped.\nAnd they brought the head of\nIshbosheth to David at Hebron, and said\nto the king, \"Here is the head of\nIshbosheth, the son of Saul your enemy,\nwho sought your life; and the LORD has\navenged my lord the king this day of\nSaul and his descendants.\"\nBut David answered Rechab and\nBaanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon\nthe Beerothite, and said to them, \"As the\nLORD lives, who has redeemed my life\nfrom all adversity,\nwhen someone told me, saying, \"Look,\nSaul is dead,' thinking to have brought\ngood news, I arrested him and had him\nexecuted in Ziklag--the one who thought\nI would give him a reward for his news.\nHow much more, when wicked men\nhave killed a righteous person in his\nown house on his bed? Therefore, shall\nI not now require his blood at your hand\nand remove you from the earth?\"\nSo David commanded his young men,\nand they executed them, cut off their\nhands and feet, and hanged them by the\npool in Hebron. But they took the head\nof Ishbosheth and buried it in the tomb\nof Abner in Hebron.\n5Then all the tribes of Israel came to\nDavid at Hebron and spoke, saying,\n\"Indeed we are your bone and your flesh.\nAlso, in time past, when Saul was king\nover us, you were the one who led Israel\nout and brought them in; and the LORD\nsaid to you, \"You shall shepherd My\npeople Israel, and be ruler over Israel.\"'\nTherefore all the elders of Israel came\nto the king at Hebron, and King David\nmade a covenant with them at Hebron\nbefore the LORD. And they anointed\nDavid king over Israel.\nDavid was thirty years old when he\nbegan to reign, and he reigned forty\nyears.\nIn Hebron he reigned over Judah seven\nyears and six months, and in Jerusalem\nhe reigned thirty-three years over all\nIsrael and Judah.\nAnd the king and his men went to\nJerusalem against the Jebusites, the\ninhabitants of the land, who spoke to\nDavid, saying, \"You shall not come in\nhere; but the blind and the lame will\nrepel you,\" thinking, \"David cannot come\nin here.\"\nNevertheless David took the stronghold\nof Zion (that is, the City of David).\nNow David said on that day, \"Whoever\nclimbs up by way of the water shaft and\ndefeats the Jebusites (the lame and the\nblind, who are hated by David's soul), he\nshall be chief and captain.\" Therefore\nthey say, \"The blind and the lame shall\nnot come into the house.\"\nThen David dwelt in the stronghold, and\ncalled it the City of David. And David\nbuilt all around from the Millo and inward.\nSo David went on and became great,\nand the LORD God of hosts was with\nhim.\nThen Hiram king of Tyre sent\nmessengers to David, and cedar trees,\nand carpenters and masons. And they\nbuilt David a house.\nSo David knew that the LORD had\nestablished him as king over Israel, and\nthat He had exalted His kingdom for the\nsake of His people Israel.\nAnd David took more concubines and\nwives from Jerusalem, after he had\ncome from Hebron. Also more sons and\ndaughters were born to David.\nNow these are the names of those\nwho were born to him in Jerusalem:\nShammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,\nIbhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,\nElishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.\nNow when the Philistines heard that\nthey had anointed David king over Israel,\nall the Philistines went up to search for\nDavid. And David heard of it and went\ndown to the stronghold.\nThe Philistines also went and\ndeployed themselves in the Valley of\nRephaim.\nSo David inquired of the LORD, saying,\n\"Shall I go up against the Philistines?\nWill You deliver them into my hand?\"\nAnd the LORD said to David, \"Go up, for\nI will doubtless deliver the Philistines\ninto your hand.\"\nSo David went to Baal Perazim, and\nDavid defeated them there; and he said,\n\"The LORD has broken through my\nenemies before me, like a breakthrough\nof water.\" Therefore he called the name\nof that place Baal Perazim.\nAnd they left their images there, and\nDavid and his men carried them away.\nAbinadab, which was on the hill; and\nUzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab,\ndrove the new cart.\nAnd they brought it out of the house of\nAbinadab, which was on the hill,\naccompanying the ark of God; and Ahio\nwent before the ark.\nThen the Philistines went up once\nagain and deployed themselves in the\nValley of Rephaim.\nTherefore David inquired of the LORD,\nand He said, \"You shall not go up; circle\naround behind them, and come upon\nthem in front of the mulberry trees.\nAnd it shall be, when you hear the\nsound of marching in the tops of the\nmulberry trees, then you shall advance\nquickly. For then the LORD will go out\nbefore you to strike the camp of the\nPhilistines.\"\nAnd David did so, as the LORD\ncommanded him; and he drove back the\nPhilistines from Geba as far as Gezer.\n6Again David gathered all the choice\nmen of Israel, thirty thousand.\nAnd David arose and went with all the\npeople who were with him from Baale\nJudah to bring up from there the ark of\nGod, whose name is called by the Name,\nthe LORD of Hosts, who dwells between\nthe cherubim.\nSo they set the ark of God on a new\ncart, and brought it out of the house of\nThen David and all the house of Israel\nplayed music before the LORD on all\nkinds of instruments of fir wood, on\nharps, on stringed instruments, on\ntambourines, on sistrums, and on\ncymbals.\nAnd when they came to Nachon's\nthreshing floor, Uzzah put out his hand\nto the ark of God and took hold of it, for\nthe oxen stumbled.\nThen the anger of the LORD was\naroused against Uzzah, and God struck\nhim there for his error; and he died there\nby the ark of God.\nAnd David became angry because of\nthe LORD's outbreak against Uzzah;\nand he called the name of the place\nPerez Uzzah to this day.\nDavid was afraid of the LORD that day;\nand he said, \"How can the ark of the\nLORD come to me?\"\nSo David would not move the ark of\nthe LORD with him into the City of\nDavid; but David took it aside into the\nhouse of Obed-Edom the Gittite.\nThe ark of the LORD remained in the\nhouse of Obed-Edom the Gittite three\nmonths. And the LORD blessed ObedEdom and all his household.\nNow it was told King David, saying,\n\"The LORD has blessed the house of\nObed-Edom and all that belongs to him,\nbecause of the ark of God.\" So David\nwent and brought up the ark of God\nfrom the house of Obed-Edom to the\nCity of David with gladness.\nAnd so it was, when those bearing the\nark of the LORD had gone six paces,\nthat he sacrificed oxen and fatted sheep.\nThen he distributed among all the\npeople, among the whole multitude of\nIsrael, both the women and the men, to\neveryone a loaf of bread, a piece of\nmeat, and a cake of raisins. So all the\npeople departed, everyone to his house.\nThen David returned to bless his\nhousehold. And Michal the daughter of\nSaul came out to meet David, and said,\n\"How glorious was the king of Israel\ntoday, uncovering himself today in the\neyes of the maids of his servants, as\none of the base fellows shamelessly\nuncovers himself!\"\nThen David danced before the LORD\nwith all his might; and David was\nwearing a linen ephod.\nSo David and all the house of Israel\nbrought up the ark of the LORD with\nshouting and with the sound of the\ntrumpet.\nNow as the ark of the LORD came into\nthe City of David, Michal, Saul's\ndaughter, looked through a window and\nsaw King David leaping and whirling\nbefore the LORD; and she despised him\nin her heart.\nSo David said to Michal, \"It was before\nthe LORD, who chose me instead of\nyour father and all his house, to appoint\nme ruler over the people of the LORD,\nover Israel. Therefore I will play music\nbefore the LORD.\nAnd I will be even more undignified\nthan this, and will be humble in my own\nsight. But as for the maidservants of\nwhom you have spoken, by them I will\nbe held in honor.\"\nTherefore Michal the daughter of Saul\nhad no children to the day of her death.\nSo they brought the ark of the LORD,\nand set it in its place in the midst of the\ntabernacle that David had erected for it.\nThen David offered burnt offerings and\npeace offerings before the LORD.\nAnd when David had finished offering\nburnt offerings and peace offerings, he\nblessed the people in the name of the\nLORD of hosts.\n7Now it came to pass when the king\nwas dwelling in his house, and the\nLORD had given him rest from all his\nenemies all around,\nthat the king said to Nathan the prophet,\n\"See now, I dwell in a house of cedar,\nbut the ark of God dwells inside tent\ncurtains.\"\nThen Nathan said to the king, \"Go, do\nall that is in your heart, for the LORD is\nwith you.\"\nBut it happened that night that the word\nof the LORD came to Nathan, saying,\nsince the time that I commanded\njudges to be over My people Israel, and\nhave caused you to rest from all your\nenemies. Also the LORD tells you that\nHe will make you a house.\n\"Go and tell My servant David, \"Thus\nsays the LORD: \"Would you build a\nhouse for Me to dwell in?\n\"When your days are fulfilled and you\nrest with your fathers, I will set up your\nseed after you, who will come from your\nbody, and I will establish his kingdom.\nFor I have not dwelt in a house since\nthe time that I brought the children of\nIsrael up from Egypt, even to this day,\nbut have moved about in a tent and in a\ntabernacle.\nWherever I have moved about with all\nthe children of Israel, have I ever\nspoken a word to anyone from the tribes\nof Israel, whom I commanded to\nshepherd My people Israel, saying,\n\"Why have you not built Me a house of\ncedar?\"\"\nHe shall build a house for My name,\nand I will establish the throne of his\nkingdom forever.\nI will be his Father, and he shall be My\nson. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten\nhim with the rod of men and with the\nblows of the sons of men.\nBut My mercy shall not depart from\nhim, as I took it from Saul, whom I\nremoved from before you.\nNow therefore, thus shall you say to My\nservant David, \"Thus says the LORD of\nhosts: \"I took you from the sheepfold,\nfrom following the sheep, to be ruler\nover My people, over Israel.\nAnd I have been with you wherever you\nhave gone, and have cut off all your\nenemies from before you, and have\nmade you a great name, like the name\nof the great men who are on the earth.\nMoreover I will appoint a place for My\npeople Israel, and will plant them, that\nthey may dwell in a place of their own\nand move no more; nor shall the sons of\nwickedness oppress them anymore, as\npreviously,\nAnd your house and your kingdom\nshall be established forever before you.\nYour throne shall be established\nforever.\"\"'\nAccording to all these words and\naccording to all this vision, so Nathan\nspoke to David.\nThen King David went in and sat\nbefore the LORD; and he said: \"Who am\nI, O Lord GOD? And what is my house,\nthat You have brought me this far?\nAnd yet this was a small thing in Your\nsight, O Lord GOD; and You have also\nspoken of Your servant's house for a\ngreat while to come. Is this the manner\nof man, O Lord GOD?\nNow what more can David say to You?\nFor You, Lord GOD, know Your servant.\nfound it in his heart to pray this prayer to\nYou.\nFor Your word's sake, and according\nto Your own heart, You have done all\nthese great things, to make Your\nservant know them.\n\"And now, O Lord GOD, You are God,\nand Your words are true, and You have\npromised this goodness to Your servant.\nTherefore You are great, O Lord GOD.\nFor there is none like You, nor is there\nany God besides You, according to all\nthat we have heard with our ears.\nNow therefore, let it please You to\nbless the house of Your servant, that it\nmay continue before You forever; for\nYou, O Lord GOD, have spoken it, and\nwith Your blessing let the house of Your\nservant be blessed forever.\"\nAnd who is like Your people, like Israel,\nthe one nation on the earth whom God\nwent to redeem for Himself as a people,\nto make for Himself a name--and to do\nfor Yourself great and awesome deeds\nfor Your land--before Your people whom\nYou redeemed for Yourself from Egypt,\nthe nations, and their gods?\nFor You have made Your people Israel\nYour very own people forever; and You,\nLORD, have become their God.\n\"Now, O LORD God, the word which\nYou have spoken concerning Your\nservant and concerning his house,\nestablish it forever and do as You have\nsaid.\nSo let Your name be magnified forever,\nsaying, \"The LORD of hosts is the God\nover Israel.' And let the house of Your\nservant David be established before\nYou.\nFor You, O LORD of hosts, God of\nIsrael, have revealed this to Your\nservant, saying, \"I will build you a\nhouse.' Therefore Your servant has\n8After this it came to pass that David\nattacked the Philistines and subdued\nthem. And David took Metheg Ammah\nfrom the hand of the Philistines.\nThen he defeated Moab. Forcing them\ndown to the ground, he measured them\noff with a line. With two lines he\nmeasured off those to be put to death,\nand with one full line those to be kept\nalive. So the Moabites became David's\nservants, and brought tribute.\nDavid also defeated Hadadezer the son\nof Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to\nrecover his territory at the River\nEuphrates.\nDavid took from him one thousand\nchariots, seven hundred horsemen, and\ntwenty thousand foot soldiers. Also\nDavid hamstrung all the chariot horses,\nexcept that he spared enough of them\nfor one hundred chariots.\nWhen the Syrians of Damascus came\nto help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David\nkilled twenty-two\nSyrians.\nthousand\nof\nthe\nAnd David made himself a name when\nhe returned from killing eighteen\nthousand Syrians in the Valley of Salt.\nThen David put garrisons in Syria of\nDamascus; and the Syrians became\nDavid's servants, and brought tribute.\nSo the LORD preserved David wherever\nhe went.\nHe also put garrisons in Edom;\nthroughout all Edom he put garrisons,\nand all the Edomites became David's\nservants. And the LORD preserved\nDavid wherever he went.\nAnd David took the shields of gold that\nhad belonged to the servants of\nHadadezer, and brought them to\nJerusalem.\nSo David reigned over all Israel; and\nDavid administered judgment and\njustice to all his people.\nAlso from Betah and from Berothai,\ncities of Hadadezer, King David took a\nlarge amount of bronze.\nJoab the son of Zeruiah was over the\narmy; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud\nwas recorder;\nWhen Toi king of Hamath heard that\nDavid had defeated all the army of\nHadadezer,\nZadok the son of Ahitub and\nAhimelech the son of Abiathar were the\npriests; Seraiah was the scribe;\nthen Toi sent Joram his son to King\nDavid, to greet him and bless him,\nbecause he had fought against\nHadadezer and defeated him (for\nHadadezer had been at war with Toi);\nand Joram brought with him articles of\nsilver, articles of gold, and articles of\nbronze.\nKing David also dedicated these to the\nLORD, along with the silver and gold\nthat he had dedicated from all the\nnations which he had subdued-12\nfrom Syria, from Moab, from the\npeople of Ammon, from the Philistines,\nfrom Amalek, and from the spoil of\nHadadezer the son of Rehob, king of\nZobah.\nBenaiah the son of Jehoiada was over\nboth the Cherethites and the Pelethites;\nand David's sons were chief ministers.\n9Now David said, \"Is there still anyone\nwho is left of the house of Saul, that I\nmay show him kindness for Jonathan's\nsake?\"\nAnd there was a servant of the house\nof Saul whose name was Ziba. So when\nthey had called him to David, the king\nsaid to him, \"Are you Ziba?\" He said, \"At\nyour service!\"\nThen the king said, \"Is there not still\nsomeone of the house of Saul, to whom\nI may show the kindness of God?\" And\nZiba said to the king, \"There is still a son\nof Jonathan who is lame in his feet.\"\nSo the king said to him, \"Where is he?\"\nAnd Ziba said to the king, \"Indeed he is\nin the house of Machir the son of\nAmmiel, in Lo Debar.\"\ncommanded his servant, so will your\nservant do.\" \"As for Mephibosheth,\" said\nthe king, \"he shall eat at my table like\none of the king's sons.\"\nThen King David sent and brought him\nout of the house of Machir the son of\nAmmiel, from Lo Debar.\nMephibosheth had a young son whose\nname was Micha. And all who dwelt in\nthe house of Ziba were servants of\nMephibosheth.\nNow when Mephibosheth the son of\nJonathan, the son of Saul, had come to\nDavid, he fell on his face and prostrated\nhimself.\nThen\nDavid\nsaid,\n\"Mephibosheth?\" And he answered,\n\"Here is your servant!\"\nSo David said to him, \"Do not fear, for I\nwill surely show you kindness for\nJonathan your father's sake, and will\nrestore to you all the land of Saul your\ngrandfather; and you shall eat bread at\nmy table continually.\"\nThen he bowed himself, and said,\n\"What is your servant, that you should\nlook upon such a dead dog as I?\"\nAnd the king called to Ziba, Saul's\nservant, and said to him, \"I have given\nto your master's son all that belonged to\nSaul and to all his house.\nYou therefore, and your sons and your\nservants, shall work the land for him,\nand you shall bring in the harvest, that\nyour master's son may have food to eat.\nBut Mephibosheth your master's son\nshall eat bread at my table always.\" Now\nZiba had fifteen sons and twenty\nservants.\nThen Ziba said to the king, \"According\nto all that my lord the king has\nSo Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem,\nfor he ate continually at the king's table.\nAnd he was lame in both his feet.\n10It happened after this that the king\nof the people of Ammon died, and\nHanun his son reigned in his place.\nThen David said, \"I will show kindness\nto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his\nfather showed kindness to me.\" So\nDavid sent by the hand of his servants\nto comfort him concerning his father.\nAnd David's servants came into the land\nof the people of Ammon.\nAnd the princes of the people of\nAmmon said to Hanun their lord, \"Do\nyou think that David really honors your\nfather because he has sent comforters\nto you? Has David not rather sent his\nservants to you to search the city, to spy\nit out, and to overthrow it?\"\nTherefore Hanun took David's servants,\nshaved off half of their beards, cut off\ntheir garments in the middle, at their\nbuttocks, and sent them away.\nWhen they told David, he sent to meet\nthem, because the men were greatly\nashamed. And the king said, \"Wait at\nJericho until your beards have grown,\nand then return.\"\nSo Joab and the people who were with\nhim drew near for the battle against the\nSyrians, and they fled before him.\nWhen the people of Ammon saw that\nthey had made themselves repulsive to\nDavid, the people of Ammon sent and\nhired the Syrians of Beth Rehob and the\nSyrians of Zoba, twenty thousand foot\nsoldiers; and from the king of Maacah\none thousand men, and from Ish-Tob\ntwelve thousand men.\nNow when David heard of it, he sent\nJoab and all the army of the mighty men.\nWhen the people of Ammon saw that\nthe Syrians were fleeing, they also fled\nbefore Abishai, and entered the city. So\nJoab returned from the people of\nAmmon and went to Jerusalem.\nWhen the Syrians saw that they had\nbeen defeated by Israel, they gathered\ntogether.\nThen the people of Ammon came out\nand put themselves in battle array at the\nentrance of the gate. And the Syrians of\nZoba, Beth Rehob, Ish-Tob, and\nMaacah were by themselves in the field.\nThen Hadadezer sent and brought out\nthe Syrians who were beyond the River,\nand they came to Helam. And Shobach\nthe commander of Hadadezer's army\nwent before them.\nWhen Joab saw that the battle line was\nagainst him before and behind, he\nchose some of Israel's best and put\nthem in battle array against the Syrians.\nWhen it was told David, he gathered\nall Israel, crossed over the Jordan, and\ncame to Helam. And the Syrians set\nthemselves in battle array against David\nand fought with him.\nAnd the rest of the people he put\nunder the command of Abishai his\nbrother, that he might set them in battle\narray against the people of Ammon.\nThen he said, \"If the Syrians are too\nstrong for me, then you shall help me;\nbut if the people of Ammon are too\nstrong for you, then I will come and help\nyou.\nBe of good courage, and let us be\nstrong for our people and for the cities of\nour God. And may the LORD do what is\ngood in His sight.\"\nThen the Syrians fled before Israel;\nand David killed seven hundred\ncharioteers\nand\nforty\nthousand\nhorsemen of the Syrians, and struck\nShobach the commander of their army,\nwho died there.\nAnd when all the kings who were\nservants to Hadadezer saw that they\nwere defeated by Israel, they made\npeace with Israel and served them. So\nthe Syrians were afraid to help the\npeople of Ammon anymore.\n11It happened in the spring of the\nyear, at the time when kings go out to\nbattle, that David sent Joab and his\nservants with him, and all Israel; and\nthey destroyed the people of Ammon\nand besieged Rabbah. But David\nremained at Jerusalem.\nThen it happened one evening that\nDavid arose from his bed and walked on\nthe roof of the king's house. And from\nthe roof he saw a woman bathing, and\nthe woman was very beautiful to behold.\nSo David sent and inquired about the\nwoman. And someone said, \"Is this not\nBathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the\nwife of Uriah the Hittite?\"\nThen David sent messengers, and took\nher; and she came to him, and he lay\nwith her, for she was cleansed from her\nimpurity; and she returned to her house.\nAnd the woman conceived; so she sent\nand told David, and said, \"I am with\nchild.\"\nBut Uriah slept at the door of the king's\nhouse with all the servants of his lord,\nand did not go down to his house.\nSo when they told David, saying,\n\"Uriah did not go down to his house,\"\nDavid said to Uriah, \"Did you not come\nfrom a journey? Why did you not go\ndown to your house?\"\nAnd Uriah said to David, \"The ark and\nIsrael and Judah are dwelling in tents,\nand my lord Joab and the servants of\nmy lord are encamped in the open fields.\nShall I then go to my house to eat and\ndrink, and to lie with my wife? As you\nlive, and as your soul lives, I will not do\nthis thing.\"\nThen David said to Uriah, \"Wait here\ntoday also, and tomorrow I will let you\ndepart.\" So Uriah remained in\nJerusalem that day and the next.\nThen David sent to Joab, saying, \"Send\nme Uriah the Hittite.\" And Joab sent\nUriah to David.\nNow when David called him, he ate\nand drank before him; and he made him\ndrunk. And at evening he went out to lie\non his bed with the servants of his lord,\nbut he did not go down to his house.\nWhen Uriah had come to him, David\nasked how Joab was doing, and how\nthe people were doing, and how the war\nprospered.\nAnd David said to Uriah, \"Go down to\nyour house and wash your feet.\" So\nUriah departed from the king's house,\nand a gift of food from the king followed\nhim.\nIn the morning it happened that David\nwrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the\nhand of Uriah.\nAnd he wrote in the letter, saying, \"Set\nUriah in the forefront of the hottest battle,\nand retreat from him, that he may be\nstruck down and die.\"\nSo it was, while Joab besieged the city,\nthat he assigned Uriah to a place where\nhe knew there were valiant men.\nThen the men of the city came out and\nfought with Joab. And some of the\npeople of the servants of David fell; and\nUriah the Hittite died also.\nthis thing displease you, for the sword\ndevours one as well as another.\nStrengthen your attack against the city,\nand overthrow it.' So encourage him.\"\nThen Joab sent and told David all the\nthings concerning the war,\nWhen the wife of Uriah heard that\nUriah her husband was dead, she\nmourned for her husband.\nand charged the messenger, saying,\n\"When you have finished telling the\nmatters of the war to the king,\nif it happens that the king's wrath rises,\nand he says to you: \"Why did you\napproach so near to the city when you\nfought? Did you not know that they\nwould shoot from the wall?\nWho struck Abimelech the son of\nJerubbesheth? Was it not a woman who\ncast a piece of a millstone on him from\nthe wall, so that he died in Thebez?\nWhy did you go near the wall?'--then\nyou shall say, \"Your servant Uriah the\nHittite is dead also.\"'\nSo the messenger went, and came\nand told David all that Joab had sent by\nhim.\nAnd the messenger said to David,\n\"Surely the men prevailed against us\nand came out to us in the field; then we\ndrove them back as far as the entrance\nof the gate.\nThe archers shot from the wall at your\nservants; and some of the king's\nservants are dead, and your servant\nUriah the Hittite is dead also.\"\nAnd when her mourning was over,\nDavid sent and brought her to his house,\nand she became his wife and bore him a\nson. But the thing that David had done\ndispleased the LORD.\n12Then the LORD sent Nathan to\nDavid. And he came to him, and said to\nhim: \"There were two men in one city,\none rich and the other poor.\nThe rich man had exceedingly many\nflocks and herds.\nBut the poor man had nothing, except\none little ewe lamb which he had bought\nand nourished; and it grew up together\nwith him and with his children. It ate of\nhis own food and drank from his own\ncup and lay in his bosom; and it was like\na daughter to him.\nAnd a traveler came to the rich man,\nwho refused to take from his own flock\nand from his own herd to prepare one\nfor the wayfaring man who had come to\nhim; but he took the poor man's lamb\nand prepared it for the man who had\ncome to him.\"\nThen David said to the messenger,\n\"Thus you shall say to Joab: \"Do not let\nSo David's anger was greatly aroused\nagainst the man, and he said to Nathan,\n\"As the LORD lives, the man who has\ndone this shall surely die!\nAnd he shall restore fourfold for the\nlamb, because he did this thing and\nbecause he had no pity.\"\nThen Nathan said to David, \"You are\nthe man! Thus says the LORD God of\nIsrael: \"I anointed you king over Israel,\nand I delivered you from the hand of\nSaul.\nI gave you your master's house and\nyour master's wives into your keeping,\nand gave you the house of Israel and\nJudah. And if that had been too little, I\nalso would have given you much more!\nSo David said to Nathan, \"I have\nsinned against the LORD.\" And Nathan\nsaid to David, \"The LORD also has put\naway your sin; you shall not die.\nHowever, because by this deed you\nhave given great occasion to the\nenemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the\nchild also who is born to you shall surely\ndie.\"\nThen Nathan departed to his house.\nAnd the LORD struck the child that\nUriah's wife bore to David, and it\nbecame ill.\nDavid therefore pleaded with God for\nthe child, and David fasted and went in\nand lay all night on the ground.\nWhy\nhave\nyou\ndespised\nthe\ncommandment of the LORD, to do evil\nin His sight? You have killed Uriah the\nHittite with the sword; you have taken\nhis wife to be your wife, and have killed\nhim with the sword of the people of\nAmmon.\nNow therefore, the sword shall never\ndepart from your house, because you\nhave despised Me, and have taken the\nwife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.'\nThus says the LORD: \"Behold, I will\nraise up adversity against you from your\nown house; and I will take your wives\nbefore your eyes and give them to your\nneighbor, and he shall lie with your\nwives in the sight of this sun.\nSo the elders of his house arose and\nwent to him, to raise him up from the\nground. But he would not, nor did he eat\nfood with them.\nThen on the seventh day it came to\npass that the child died. And the\nservants of David were afraid to tell him\nthat the child was dead. For they said,\n\"Indeed, while the child was alive, we\nspoke to him, and he would not heed\nour voice. How can we tell him that the\nchild is dead? He may do some harm!\"\nWhen David saw that his servants\nwere whispering, David perceived that\nthe child was dead. Therefore David\nsaid to his servants, \"Is the child dead?\"\nAnd they said, \"He is dead.\"\nFor you did it secretly, but I will do this\nthing before all Israel, before the sun.\"'\nSo David arose from the ground,\nwashed and anointed himself, and\nchanged his clothes; and he went into\nthe house of the LORD and worshiped.\nThen he went to his own house; and\nwhen he requested, they set food before\nhim, and he ate.\nSo David gathered all the people\ntogether and went to Rabbah, fought\nagainst it, and took it.\nThen his servants said to him, \"What is\nthis that you have done? You fasted and\nwept for the child while he was alive, but\nwhen the child died, you arose and ate\nfood.\"\nThen he took their king's crown from\nhis head. Its weight was a talent of gold,\nwith precious stones. And it was set on\nDavid's head. Also he brought out the\nspoil of the city in great abundance.\nAnd he said, \"While the child was alive,\nI fasted and wept; for I said, \"Who can\ntell whether the LORD will be gracious\nto me, that the child may live?'\nBut now he is dead; why should I fast?\nCan I bring him back again? I shall go to\nhim, but he shall not return to me.\"\nThen David comforted Bathsheba his\nwife, and went in to her and lay with her.\nSo she bore a son, and he called his\nname Solomon. Now the LORD loved\nhim,\nand He sent word by the hand of\nNathan the prophet: So he called his\nname Jedidiah, because of the LORD.\nAnd he brought out the people who\nwere in it, and put them to work with\nsaws and iron picks and iron axes, and\nmade them cross over to the brick works.\nSo he did to all the cities of the people\nof Ammon. Then David and all the\npeople returned to Jerusalem.\n13After this Absalom the son of\nDavid had a lovely sister, whose name\nwas Tamar; and Amnon the son of\nDavid loved her.\nAmnon was so distressed over his\nsister Tamar that he became sick; for\nshe was a virgin. And it was improper\nfor Amnon to do anything to her.\nNow Joab fought against Rabbah of\nthe people of Ammon, and took the\nroyal city.\nBut Amnon had a friend whose name\nwas Jonadab the son of Shimeah,\nDavid's brother. Now Jonadab was a\nvery crafty man.\nAnd Joab sent messengers to David,\nand said, \"I have fought against Rabbah,\nand I have taken the city's water supply.\nNow therefore, gather the rest of the\npeople together and encamp against the\ncity and take it, lest I take the city and it\nbe called after my name.\"\nAnd he said to him, \"Why are you, the\nking's son, becoming thinner day after\nday? Will you not tell me?\" Amnon said\nto him, \"I love Tamar, my brother\nAbsalom's sister.\"\nSo Jonadab said to him, \"Lie down on\nyour bed and pretend to be ill. And when\nyour father comes to see you, say to\nhim, \"Please let my sister Tamar come\nand give me food, and prepare the food\nin my sight, that I may see it and eat it\nfrom her hand.\"'\nAnd I, where could I take my shame?\nAnd as for you, you would be like one of\nthe fools in Israel. Now therefore, please\nspeak to the king; for he will not withhold\nme from you.\"\nThen Amnon lay down and pretended\nto be ill; and when the king came to see\nhim, Amnon said to the king, \"Please let\nTamar my sister come and make a\ncouple of cakes for me in my sight, that I\nmay eat from her hand.\"\nHowever, he would not heed her\nvoice; and being stronger than she, he\nforced her and lay with her.\nAnd David sent home to Tamar, saying,\n\"Now go to your brother Amnon's house,\nand prepare food for him.\"\nThen Amnon hated her exceedingly,\nso that the hatred with which he hated\nher was greater than the love with which\nhe had loved her. And Amnon said to\nher, \"Arise, be gone!\"\nSo Tamar went to her brother Amnon's\nhouse; and he was lying down. Then\nshe took flour and kneaded it, made\ncakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.\nSo she said to him, \"No, indeed! This\nevil of sending me away is worse than\nthe other that you did to me.\" But he\nwould not listen to her.\nAnd she took the pan and placed them\nout before him, but he refused to eat.\nThen Amnon said, \"Have everyone go\nout from me.\" And they all went out from\nhim.\nThen he called his servant who\nattended him, and said, \"Here! Put this\nwoman out, away from me, and bolt the\ndoor behind her.\"\nThen Amnon said to Tamar, \"Bring the\nfood into the bedroom, that I may eat\nfrom your hand.\" And Tamar took the\ncakes which she had made, and brought\nthem to Amnon her brother in the\nbedroom.\nNow when she had brought them to\nhim to eat, he took hold of her and said\nto her, \"Come, lie with me, my sister.\"\nBut she answered him, \"No, my\nbrother, do not force me, for no such\nthing should be done in Israel. Do not do\nthis disgraceful thing!\nNow she had on a robe of many colors,\nfor the king's virgin daughters wore such\napparel. And his servant put her out and\nbolted the door behind her.\nThen Tamar put ashes on her head,\nand tore her robe of many colors that\nwas on her, and laid her hand on her\nhead and went away crying bitterly.\nAnd Absalom her brother said to her,\n\"Has Amnon your brother been with\nyou? But now hold your peace, my\nsister. He is your brother; do not take\nthis thing to heart.\" So Tamar remained\ndesolate in her brother Absalom's house.\nBut when King David heard of all these\nthings, he was very angry.\nThen all the king's sons arose, and each\none got on his mule and fled.\nAnd Absalom spoke to his brother\nAmnon neither good nor bad. For\nAbsalom hated Amnon, because he had\nforced his sister Tamar.\nAnd it came to pass, while they were\non the way, that news came to David,\nsaying, \"Absalom has killed all the king's\nsons, and not one of them is left!\"\nAnd it came to pass, after two full\nyears, that Absalom had sheepshearers\nin Baal Hazor, which is near Ephraim;\nso Absalom invited all the king's sons.\nSo the king arose and tore his\ngarments and lay on the ground, and all\nhis servants stood by with their clothes\ntorn.\nThen Absalom came to the king and\nsaid, \"Kindly note, your servant has\nsheepshearers; please, let the king and\nhis servants go with your servant.\"\nBut the king said to Absalom, \"No, my\nson, let us not all go now, lest we be a\nburden to you.\" Then he urged him, but\nhe would not go; and he blessed him.\nThen Absalom said, \"If not, please let\nmy brother Amnon go with us.\" And the\nking said to him, \"Why should he go with\nyou?\"\nThen Jonadab the son of Shimeah,\nDavid's brother, answered and said, \"Let\nnot my lord suppose they have killed all\nthe young men, the king's sons, for only\nAmnon is dead. For by the command of\nAbsalom this has been determined from\nthe day that he forced his sister Tamar.\nNow therefore, let not my lord the king\ntake the thing to his heart, to think that\nall the king's sons are dead. For only\nAmnon is dead.\"\nBut Absalom urged him; so he let\nAmnon and all the king's sons go with\nhim.\nThen Absalom fled. And the young\nman who was keeping watch lifted his\neyes and looked, and there, many\npeople were coming from the road on\nthe hillside behind him.\nNow Absalom had commanded his\nservants, saying, \"Watch now, when\nAmnon's heart is merry with wine, and\nwhen I say to you, \"Strike Amnon!' then\nkill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not\ncommanded you? Be courageous and\nvaliant.\"\nSo the servants of Absalom did to\nAmnon as Absalom had commanded.\nAnd Jonadab said to the king, \"Look,\nthe king's sons are coming; as your\nservant said, so it is.\"\nSo it was, as soon as he had finished\nspeaking, that the king's sons indeed\ncame, and they lifted up their voice and\nwept. Also the king and all his servants\nwept very bitterly.\nBut Absalom fled and went to Talmai\nthe son of Ammihud, king of Geshur.\nAnd David mourned for his son every\nday.\nSo Absalom fled and went to Geshur,\nand was there three years.\nAnd King David longed to go to\nAbsalom. For he had been comforted\nconcerning Amnon, because he was\ndead.\n14So Joab the son of Zeruiah\nperceived that the king's heart was\nconcerned about Absalom.\nAnd Joab sent to Tekoa and brought\nfrom there a wise woman, and said to\nher, \"Please pretend to be a mourner,\nand put on mourning apparel; do not\nanoint yourself with oil, but act like a\nwoman who has been mourning a long\ntime for the dead.\nGo to the king and speak to him in this\nmanner.\" So Joab put the words in her\nmouth.\nAnd when the woman of Tekoa spoke\nto the king, she fell on her face to the\nground and prostrated herself, and said,\n\"Help, O king!\"\nThen the king said to her, \"What\ntroubles you?\" And she answered,\n\"Indeed I am a widow, my husband is\ndead.\nNow your maidservant had two sons;\nand the two fought with each other in\nthe field, and there was no one to part\nthem, but the one struck the other and\nkilled him.\nAnd now the whole family has risen up\nagainst your maidservant, and they said,\n\"Deliver him who struck his brother, that\nwe may execute him for the life of his\nbrother whom he killed; and we will\ndestroy the heir also.' So they would\nextinguish my ember that is left, and\nleave to my husband neither name nor\nremnant on the earth.\"\nThen the king said to the woman, \"Go\nto your house, and I will give orders\nconcerning you.\"\nAnd the woman of Tekoa said to the\nking, \"My lord, O king, let the iniquity be\non me and on my father's house, and\nthe king and his throne be guiltless.\"\nSo the king said, \"Whoever says\nanything to you, bring him to me, and he\nshall not touch you anymore.\"\nThen she said, \"Please let the king\nremember the LORD your God, and do\nnot permit the avenger of blood to\ndestroy anymore, lest they destroy my\nson.\" And he said, \"As the LORD lives,\nnot one hair of your son shall fall to the\nground.\"\nTherefore the woman said, \"Please, let\nyour maidservant speak another word to\nmy lord the king.\" And he said, \"Say on.\"\nSo the woman said: \"Why then have\nyou schemed such a thing against the\npeople of God? For the king speaks this\nthing as one who is guilty, in that the\nking does not bring his banished one\nhome again.\nFor we will surely die and become like\nwater spilled on the ground, which\ncannot be gathered up again. Yet God\ndoes not take away a life; but He\ndevises means, so that His banished\nones are not expelled from Him.\nNow therefore, I have come to speak\nof this thing to my lord the king because\nthe people have made me afraid. And\nyour maidservant said, \"I will now speak\nto the king; it may be that the king will\nperform the request of his maidservant.\nTo bring about this change of affairs\nyour servant Joab has done this thing;\nbut my lord is wise, according to the\nwisdom of the angel of God, to know\neverything that is in the earth.\"\nAnd the king said to Joab, \"All right, I\nhave granted this thing. Go therefore,\nbring back the young man Absalom.\"\nThen Joab fell to the ground on his\nface and bowed himself, and thanked\nthe king. And Joab said, \"Today your\nservant knows that I have found favor in\nyour sight, my lord, O king, in that the\nking has fulfilled the request of his\nservant.\"\nFor the king will hear and deliver his\nmaidservant from the hand of the man\nwho would destroy me and my son\ntogether from the inheritance of God.'\nSo Joab arose and went to Geshur,\nand brought Absalom to Jerusalem.\nYour maidservant said, \"The word of\nmy lord the king will now be comforting;\nfor as the angel of God, so is my lord\nthe king in discerning good and evil. And\nmay the LORD your God be with you.\"'\nAnd the king said, \"Let him return to\nhis own house, but do not let him see\nmy face.\" So Absalom returned to his\nown house, but did not see the king's\nface.\nThen the king answered and said to\nthe woman, \"Please do not hide from\nme anything that I ask you.\" And the\nwoman said, \"Please, let my lord the\nking speak.\"\nNow in all Israel there was no one who\nwas praised as much as Absalom for his\ngood looks. From the sole of his foot to\nthe crown of his head there was no\nblemish in him.\nSo the king said, \"Is the hand of Joab\nwith you in all this?\" And the woman\nanswered and said, \"As you live, my lord\nthe king, no one can turn to the right\nhand or to the left from anything that my\nlord the king has spoken. For your\nservant Joab commanded me, and he\nput all these words in the mouth of your\nmaidservant.\nAnd when he cut the hair of his head-at the end of every year he cut it\nbecause it was heavy on him--when he\ncut it, he weighed the hair of his head at\ntwo hundred shekels according to the\nking's standard.\nTo Absalom were born three sons, and\none daughter whose name was Tamar.\nShe was a\nappearance.\nwoman\nof\nbeautiful\nAnd Absalom dwelt two full years in\nJerusalem, but did not see the king's\nface.\nTherefore Absalom sent for Joab, to\nsend him to the king, but he would not\ncome to him. And when he sent again\nthe second time, he would not come.\nNow Absalom would rise early and\nstand beside the way to the gate. So it\nwas, whenever anyone who had a\nlawsuit came to the king for a decision,\nthat Absalom would call to him and say,\n\"What city are you from?\" And he would\nsay, \"Your servant is from such and\nsuch a tribe of Israel.\"\nThen Absalom would say to him, \"Look,\nyour case is good and right; but there is\nno deputy of the king to hear you.\"\nSo he said to his servants, \"See,\nJoab's field is near mine, and he has\nbarley there; go and set it on fire.\" And\nAbsalom's servants set the field on fire.\nThen Joab arose and came to\nAbsalom's house, and said to him, \"Why\nhave your servants set my field on fire?\"\nAnd Absalom answered Joab, \"Look, I\nsent to you, saying, \"Come here, so that\nI may send you to the king, to say, \"Why\nhave I come from Geshur? It would be\nbetter for me to be there still.\"' Now\ntherefore, let me see the king's face; but\nif there is iniquity in me, let him execute\nme.\"\nSo Joab went to the king and told him.\nAnd when he had called for Absalom, he\ncame to the king and bowed himself on\nhis face to the ground before the king.\nThen the king kissed Absalom.\n15After this it happened that\nAbsalom provided himself with chariots\nand horses, and fifty men to run before\nhim.\nMoreover Absalom would say, \"Oh, that\nI were made judge in the land, and\neveryone who has any suit or cause\nwould come to me; then I would give\nhim justice.\"\nAnd so it was, whenever anyone came\nnear to bow down to him, that he would\nput out his hand and take him and kiss\nhim.\nIn this manner Absalom acted toward\nall Israel who came to the king for\njudgment. So Absalom stole the hearts\nof the men of Israel.\nNow it came to pass after forty years\nthat Absalom said to the king, \"Please,\nlet me go to Hebron and pay the vow\nwhich I made to the LORD.\nFor your servant took a vow while I\ndwelt at Geshur in Syria, saying, \"If the\nLORD indeed brings me back to\nJerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.\"'\nAnd the king said to him, \"Go in peace.\"\nSo he arose and went to Hebron.\nThen Absalom sent spies throughout\nall the tribes of Israel, saying, \"As soon\nas you hear the sound of the trumpet,\nthen you shall say, \"Absalom reigns in\nHebron!\"'\nThen all his servants passed before\nhim; and all the Cherethites, all the\nPelethites, and all the Gittites, six\nhundred men who had followed him\nfrom Gath, passed before the king.\nAnd with Absalom went two hundred\nmen invited from Jerusalem, and they\nwent along innocently and did not know\nanything.\nThen the king said to Ittai the Gittite,\n\"Why are you also going with us?\nReturn and remain with the king. For\nyou are a foreigner and also an exile\nfrom your own place.\nThen Absalom sent for Ahithophel the\nGilonite, David's counselor, from his\ncity--from Giloh--while he offered\nsacrifices. And the conspiracy grew\nstrong, for the people with Absalom\ncontinually increased in number.\nIn fact, you came only yesterday.\nShould I make you wander up and down\nwith us today, since I go I know not\nwhere? Return, and take your brethren\nback. Mercy and truth be with you.\"\nNow a messenger came to David,\nsaying, \"The hearts of the men of Israel\nare with Absalom.\"\nSo David said to all his servants who\nwere with him at Jerusalem, \"Arise, and\nlet us flee, or we shall not escape from\nAbsalom. Make haste to depart, lest he\novertake us suddenly and bring disaster\nupon us, and strike the city with the\nedge of the sword.\"\nAnd the king's servants said to the\nking, \"We are your servants, ready to do\nwhatever my lord the king commands.\"\nThen the king went out with all his\nhousehold after him. But the king left ten\nwomen, concubines, to keep the house.\nAnd the king went out with all the\npeople after him, and stopped at the\noutskirts.\nBut Ittai answered the king and said,\n\"As the LORD lives, and as my lord the\nking lives, surely in whatever place my\nlord the king shall be, whether in death\nor life, even there also your servant will\nbe.\"\nSo David said to Ittai, \"Go, and cross\nover.\" Then Ittai the Gittite and all his\nmen and all the little ones who were with\nhim crossed over.\nAnd all the country wept with a loud\nvoice, and all the people crossed over.\nThe king himself also crossed over the\nBrook Kidron, and all the people\ncrossed over toward the way of the\nwilderness.\nThere was Zadok also, and all the\nLevites with him, bearing the ark of the\ncovenant of God. And they set down the\nark of God, and Abiathar went up until\nall the people had finished crossing over\nfrom the city.\nThen the king said to Zadok, \"Carry\nthe ark of God back into the city. If I find\nfavor in the eyes of the LORD, He will\nbring me back and show me both it and\nHis dwelling place.\nBut if He says thus: \"I have no delight\nin you,' here I am, let Him do to me as\nseems good to Him.\"\nDavid said to him, \"If you go on with\nme, then you will become a burden to\nme.\nBut if you return to the city, and say to\nAbsalom, \"I will be your servant, O king;\nas I was your father's servant previously,\nso I will now also be your servant,' then\nyou may defeat the counsel of\nAhithophel for me.\nThe king also said to Zadok the priest,\n\"Are you not a seer? Return to the city in\npeace, and your two sons with you,\nAhimaaz your son, and Jonathan the\nson of Abiathar.\nAnd do you not have Zadok and\nAbiathar the priests with you there?\nTherefore it will be that whatever you\nhear from the king's house, you shall tell\nto Zadok and Abiathar the priests.\nSee, I will wait in the plains of the\nwilderness until word comes from you to\ninform me.\"\nTherefore Zadok and Abiathar carried\nthe ark of God back to Jerusalem. And\nthey remained there.\nSo David went up by the Ascent of the\nMount of Olives, and wept as he went\nup; and he had his head covered and\nwent barefoot. And all the people who\nwere with him covered their heads and\nwent up, weeping as they went up.\nThen someone told David, saying,\n\"Ahithophel is among the conspirators\nwith Absalom.\" And David said, \"O\nLORD, I pray, turn the counsel of\nAhithophel into foolishness!\"\nIndeed they have there with them their\ntwo sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and\nJonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them\nyou shall send me everything you hear.\"\nSo Hushai, David's friend, went into\nthe city. And Absalom came into\nJerusalem.\n16When David was a little past the\ntop of the mountain, there was Ziba the\nservant of Mephibosheth, who met him\nwith a couple of saddled donkeys, and\non them two hundred loaves of bread,\none hundred clusters of raisins, one\nhundred summer fruits, and a skin of\nwine.\nNow it happened when David had\ncome to the top of the mountain, where\nhe worshiped God--there was Hushai\nthe Archite coming to meet him with his\nrobe torn and dust on his head.\nAnd the king said to Ziba, \"What do you\nmean to do with these?\" So Ziba said,\n\"The donkeys are for the king's\nhousehold to ride on, the bread and\nsummer fruit for the young men to eat,\nand the wine for those who are faint in\nthe wilderness to drink.\"\nThen the king said, \"And where is your\nmaster's son?\" And Ziba said to the king,\n\"Indeed he is staying in Jerusalem, for\nhe said, \"Today the house of Israel will\nrestore the kingdom of my father to me.\"'\nSo the king said to Ziba, \"Here, all that\nbelongs to Mephibosheth is yours.\" And\nZiba said, \"I humbly bow before you,\nthat I may find favor in your sight, my\nlord, O king!\"\nhim curse, because the LORD has said\nto him, \"Curse David.' Who then shall\nsay, \"Why have you done so?\"'\nAnd David said to Abishai and all his\nservants, \"See how my son who came\nfrom my own body seeks my life. How\nmuch more now may this Benjamite?\nLet him alone, and let him curse; for so\nthe LORD has ordered him.\nNow when King David came to Bahurim,\nthere was a man from the family of the\nhouse of Saul, whose name was Shimei\nthe son of Gera, coming from there. He\ncame out, cursing continuously as he\ncame.\nAnd he threw stones at David and at all\nthe servants of King David. And all the\npeople and all the mighty men were on\nhis right hand and on his left.\nAlso Shimei said thus when he cursed:\n\"Come out! Come out! You bloodthirsty\nman, you rogue!\nThe LORD has brought upon you all\nthe blood of the house of Saul, in whose\nplace you have reigned; and the LORD\nhas delivered the kingdom into the hand\nof Absalom your son. So now you are\ncaught in your own evil, because you\nare a bloodthirsty man!\"\nThen Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to\nthe king, \"Why should this dead dog\ncurse my lord the king? Please, let me\ngo over and take off his head!\"\nBut the king said, \"What have I to do\nwith you, you sons of Zeruiah? So let\nIt may be that the LORD will look on\nmy affliction, and that the LORD will\nrepay me with good for his cursing this\nday.\"\nAnd as David and his men went along\nthe road, Shimei went along the hillside\nopposite him and cursed as he went,\nthrew stones at him and kicked up dust.\nNow the king and all the people who\nwere with him became weary; so they\nrefreshed themselves there.\nMeanwhile Absalom and all the people,\nthe men of Israel, came to Jerusalem;\nand Ahithophel was with him.\nAnd so it was, when Hushai the\nArchite, David's friend, came to Absalom,\nthat Hushai said to Absalom, \"Long live\nthe king! Long live the king!\"\nSo Absalom said to Hushai, \"Is this\nyour loyalty to your friend? Why did you\nnot go with your friend?\"\nAnd Hushai said to Absalom, \"No, but\nwhom the LORD and this people and all\nthe men of Israel choose, his I will be,\nand with him I will remain.\n\"Furthermore, whom should I serve?\nShould I not serve in the presence of his\nson? As I have served in your father's\npresence, so will I be in your presence.\"\nThen Absalom said to Ahithophel,\n\"Give advice as to what we should do.\"\nAnd the saying pleased Absalom and\nall the elders of Israel.\nThen Absalom said, \"Now call Hushai\nthe Archite also, and let us hear what he\nsays too.\"\nAnd Ahithophel said to Absalom, \"Go\nin to your father's concubines, whom he\nhas left to keep the house; and all Israel\nwill hear that you are abhorred by your\nfather. Then the hands of all who are\nwith you will be strong.\"\nSo they pitched a tent for Absalom on\nthe top of the house, and Absalom went\nin to his father's concubines in the sight\nof all Israel.\nNow the advice of Ahithophel, which\nhe gave in those days, was as if one\nhad inquired at the oracle of God. So\nwas all the advice of Ahithophel both\nwith David and with Absalom.\n17Moreover Ahithophel said to\nAbsalom, \"Now let me choose twelve\nthousand men, and I will arise and\npursue David tonight.\nI will come upon him while he is weary\nand weak, and make him afraid. And all\nthe people who are with him will flee,\nand I will strike only the king.\nThen I will bring back all the people to\nyou. When all return except the man\nwhom you seek, all the people will be at\npeace.\"\nAnd when Hushai came to Absalom,\nAbsalom spoke to him, saying,\n\"Ahithophel has spoken in this manner.\nShall we do as he says? If not, speak\nup.\"\nSo Hushai said to Absalom: \"The\nadvice that Ahithophel has given is not\ngood at this time.\nFor,\" said Hushai, \"you know your\nfather and his men, that they are mighty\nmen, and they are enraged in their\nminds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in\nthe field; and your father is a man of war,\nand will not camp with the people.\nSurely by now he is hidden in some pit,\nor in some other place. And it will be,\nwhen some of them are overthrown at\nthe first, that whoever hears it will say,\n\"There is a slaughter among the people\nwho follow Absalom.'\nAnd even he who is valiant, whose\nheart is like the heart of a lion, will melt\ncompletely. For all Israel knows that\nyour father is a mighty man, and those\nwho are with him are valiant men.\nTherefore I advise that all Israel be\nfully gathered to you, from Dan to\nBeersheba, like the sand that is by the\nsea for multitude, and that you go to\nbattle in person.\nSo we will come upon him in some\nplace where he may be found, and we\nwill fall on him as the dew falls on the\nground. And of him and all the men who\nare with him there shall not be left so\nmuch as one.\nMoreover, if he has withdrawn into a\ncity, then all Israel shall bring ropes to\nthat city; and we will pull it into the river,\nuntil there is not one small stone found\nthere.\"\nSo Absalom and all the men of Israel\nsaid, \"The advice of Hushai the Archite\nis better than the advice of Ahithophel.\"\nFor the LORD had purposed to defeat\nthe good advice of Ahithophel, to the\nintent that the LORD might bring\ndisaster on Absalom.\nThen Hushai said to Zadok and\nAbiathar the priests, \"Thus and so\nAhithophel advised Absalom and the\nelders of Israel, and thus and so I have\nadvised.\nNow therefore, send quickly and tell\nDavid, saying, \"Do not spend this night\nin the plains of the wilderness, but\nspeedily cross over, lest the king and all\nthe people who are with him be\nswallowed up.\"'\nNow Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed at\nEn Rogel, for they dared not be seen\ncoming into the city; so a female servant\nwould come and tell them, and they\nwould go and tell King David.\nNevertheless a lad saw them, and told\nAbsalom. But both of them went away\nquickly and came to a man's house in\nBahurim, who had a well in his court;\nand they went down into it.\nThen the woman took and spread a\ncovering over the well's mouth, and\nspread ground grain on it; and the thing\nwas not known.\nAnd when Absalom's servants came to\nthe woman at the house, they said,\n\"Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?\" So\nthe woman said to them, \"They have\ngone over the water brook.\" And when\nthey had searched and could not find\nthem, they returned to Jerusalem.\nNow it came to pass, after they had\ndeparted, that they came up out of the\nwell and went and told King David, and\nsaid to David, \"Arise and cross over the\nwater quickly. For thus has Ahithophel\nadvised against you.\"\nSo David and all the people who were\nwith him arose and crossed over the\nJordan. By morning light not one of\nthem was left who had not gone over\nthe Jordan.\nNow when Ahithophel saw that his\nadvice was not followed, he saddled a\ndonkey, and arose and went home to\nhis house, to his city. Then he put his\nhousehold in order, and hanged himself,\nand died; and he was buried in his\nfather's tomb.\nThen David went to Mahanaim. And\nAbsalom crossed over the Jordan, he\nand all the men of Israel with him.\nAnd Absalom made Amasa captain of\nthe army instead of Joab. This Amasa\nwas the son of a man whose name was\nJithra, an Israelite, who had gone in to\nAbigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of\nZeruiah, Joab's mother.\nwill they care about us. But you are\nworth ten thousand of us now. For you\nare now more help to us in the city.\"\nSo Israel and Absalom encamped in\nthe land of Gilead.\nNow it happened, when David had\ncome to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son\nof Nahash from Rabbah of the people of\nAmmon, Machir the son of Ammiel from\nLo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite\nfrom Rogelim,\nbrought beds and basins, earthen\nvessels and wheat, barley and flour,\nparched grain and beans, lentils and\nparched seeds,\nThen the king said to them, \"Whatever\nseems best to you I will do.\" So the king\nstood beside the gate, and all the\npeople went out by hundreds and by\nthousands.\nNow the king had commanded Joab,\nAbishai, and Ittai, saying, \"Deal gently\nfor my sake with the young man\nAbsalom.\" And all the people heard\nwhen the king gave all the captains\norders concerning Absalom.\nSo the people went out into the field of\nbattle against Israel. And the battle was\nin the woods of Ephraim.\nhoney and curds, sheep and cheese of\nthe herd, for David and the people who\nwere with him to eat. For they said, \"The\npeople are hungry and weary and thirsty\nin the wilderness.\"\n18And David numbered the people\nwho were with him, and set captains of\nthousands and captains of hundreds\nover them.\nThen David sent out one third of the\npeople under the hand of Joab, one\nthird under the hand of Abishai the son\nof Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and one third\nunder the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And\nthe king said to the people, \"I also will\nsurely go out with you myself.\"\nBut the people answered, \"You shall\nnot go out! For if we flee away, they will\nnot care about us; nor if half of us die,\nThe people of Israel were overthrown\nthere before the servants of David, and\na great slaughter of twenty thousand\ntook place there that day.\nFor the battle there was scattered over\nthe face of the whole countryside, and\nthe woods devoured more people that\nday than the sword devoured.\nThen Absalom met the servants of\nDavid. Absalom rode on a mule. The\nmule went under the thick boughs of a\ngreat terebinth tree, and his head\ncaught in the terebinth; so he was left\nhanging between heaven and earth.\nAnd the mule which was under him went\non.\nNow a certain man saw it and told\nJoab, and said, \"I just saw Absalom\nhanging in a terebinth tree!\"\nSo Joab said to the man who told him,\n\"You just saw him! And why did you not\nstrike him there to the ground? I would\nhave given you ten shekels of silver and\na belt.\"\nBut the man said to Joab, \"Though I\nwere to receive a thousand shekels of\nsilver in my hand, I would not raise my\nhand against the king's son. For in our\nhearing the king commanded you and\nAbishai and Ittai, saying, \"Beware lest\nanyone touch the young man Absalom!'\nAnd to this day it is called Absalom's\nMonument.\nThen Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said,\n\"Let me run now and take the news to\nthe king, how the LORD has avenged\nhim of his enemies.\"\nAnd Joab said to him, \"You shall not\ntake the news this day, for you shall\ntake the news another day. But today\nyou shall take no news, because the\nking's son is dead.\"\nOtherwise I would have dealt falsely\nagainst my own life. For there is nothing\nhidden from the king, and you yourself\nwould have set yourself against me.\"\nThen Joab said to the Cushite, \"Go,\ntell the king what you have seen.\" So\nthe Cushite bowed himself to Joab and\nran.\nThen Joab said, \"I cannot linger with\nyou.\" And he took three spears in his\nhand and thrust them through Absalom's\nheart, while he was still alive in the\nmidst of the terebinth tree.\nAnd ten young men who bore Joab's\narmor surrounded Absalom, and struck\nand killed him.\nSo Joab blew the trumpet, and the\npeople returned from pursuing Israel.\nFor Joab held back the people.\nAnd they took Absalom and cast him\ninto a large pit in the woods, and laid a\nvery large heap of stones over him.\nThen all Israel fled, everyone to his tent.\nAnd Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said\nagain to Joab, \"But whatever happens,\nplease let me also run after the\nCushite.\" So Joab said, \"Why will you\nrun, my son, since you have no news\nready?\"\n\"But whatever happens,\" he said, \"let\nme run.\" So he said to him, \"Run.\" Then\nAhimaaz ran by way of the plain, and\noutran the Cushite.\nNow David was sitting between the\ntwo gates. And the watchman went up\nto the roof over the gate, to the wall,\nlifted his eyes and looked, and there\nwas a man, running alone.\nNow Absalom in his lifetime had taken\nand set up a pillar for himself, which is in\nthe King's Valley. For he said, \"I have no\nson to keep my name in remembrance.\"\nHe called the pillar after his own name.\nThen the watchman cried out and told\nthe king. And the king said, \"If he is\nalone, there is news in his mouth.\" And\nhe came rapidly and drew near.\nThen the watchman saw another man\nrunning, and the watchman called to the\ngatekeeper and said, \"There is another\nman, running alone!\" And the king said,\n\"He also brings news.\"\nThen the king was deeply moved, and\nwent up to the chamber over the gate,\nand wept. And as he went, he said thus:\n\"O my son Absalom--my son, my son\nAbsalom--if only I had died in your\nplace! O Absalom my son, my son!\"\nSo the watchman said, \"I think the\nrunning of the first is like the running of\nAhimaaz the son of Zadok.\" And the\nking said, \"He is a good man, and\ncomes with good news.\"\nSo Ahimaaz called out and said to the\nking, \"All is well!\" Then he bowed down\nwith his face to the earth before the king,\nand said, \"Blessed be the LORD your\nGod, who has delivered up the men who\nraised their hand against my lord the\nking!\"\nThe king said, \"Is the young man\nAbsalom safe?\" Ahimaaz answered,\n\"When Joab sent the king's servant and\nme your servant, I saw a great tumult,\nbut I did not know what it was about.\"\nAnd the king said, \"Turn aside and\nstand here.\" So he turned aside and\nstood still.\nJust then the Cushite came, and the\nCushite said, \"There is good news, my\nlord the king! For the LORD has\navenged you this day of all those who\nrose against you.\"\nAnd the king said to the Cushite, \"Is\nthe young man Absalom safe?\" So the\nCushite answered, \"May the enemies of\nmy lord the king, and all who rise\nagainst you to do harm, be like that\nyoung man!\"\n19And Joab was told, \"Behold, the\nking is weeping and mourning for\nAbsalom.\"\nSo the victory that day was turned into\nmourning for all the people. For the\npeople heard it said that day, \"The king\nis grieved for his son.\"\nAnd the people stole back into the city\nthat day, as people who are ashamed\nsteal away when they flee in battle.\nBut the king covered his face, and the\nking cried out with a loud voice, \"O my\nson Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my\nson!\"\nThen Joab came into the house to the\nking, and said, \"Today you have\ndisgraced all your servants who today\nhave saved your life, the lives of your\nsons and daughters, the lives of your\nwives and the lives of your concubines,\nin that you love your enemies and hate\nyour friends. For you have declared\ntoday that you regard neither princes\nnor servants; for today I perceive that if\nAbsalom had lived and all of us had died\ntoday, then it would have pleased you\nwell.\nNow therefore, arise, go out and speak\ncomfort to your servants. For I swear by\nthe LORD, if you do not go out, not one\nwill stay with you this night. And that will\nbe worse for you than all the evil that\nhas befallen you from your youth until\nnow.\"\nThen the king arose and sat in the gate.\nAnd they told all the people, saying,\n\"There is the king, sitting in the gate.\" So\nall the people came before the king. For\neveryone of Israel had fled to his tent.\nNow all the people were in a dispute\nthroughout all the tribes of Israel, saying,\n\"The king saved us from the hand of our\nenemies, he delivered us from the hand\nof the Philistines, and now he has fled\nfrom the land because of Absalom.\nBut Absalom, whom we anointed over\nus, has died in battle. Now therefore,\nwhy do you say nothing about bringing\nback the king?\"\nSo King David sent to Zadok and\nAbiathar the priests, saying, \"Speak to\nthe elders of Judah, saying, \"Why are\nyou the last to bring the king back to his\nhouse, since the words of all Israel have\ncome to the king, to his very house?\nYou are my brethren, you are my bone\nand my flesh. Why then are you the last\nto bring back the king?'\nman, so that they sent this word to the\nking: \"Return, you and all your\nservants!\"\nThen the king returned and came to\nthe Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal,\nto go to meet the king, to escort the king\nacross the Jordan.\nAnd Shimei the son of Gera, a\nBenjamite, who was from Bahurim,\nhurried and came down with the men of\nJudah to meet King David.\nThere were a thousand men of\nBenjamin with him, and Ziba the servant\nof the house of Saul, and his fifteen\nsons and his twenty servants with him;\nand they went over the Jordan before\nthe king.\nThen a ferryboat went across to carry\nover the king's household, and to do\nwhat he thought good. Now Shimei the\nson of Gera fell down before the king\nwhen he had crossed the Jordan.\nThen he said to the king, \"Do not let\nmy lord impute iniquity to me, or\nremember what wrong your servant did\non the day that my lord the king left\nJerusalem, that the king should take it to\nheart.\nAnd say to Amasa, \"Are you not my\nbone and my flesh? God do so to me,\nand more also, if you are not\ncommander of the army before me\ncontinually in place of Joab.\"'\nSo he swayed the hearts of all the\nmen of Judah, just as the heart of one\nFor I, your servant, know that I have\nsinned. Therefore here I am, the first to\ncome today of all the house of Joseph to\ngo down to meet my lord the king.\"\nBut Abishai the son of Zeruiah\nanswered and said, \"Shall not Shimei be\nput to death for this, because he cursed\nthe LORD's anointed?\"\nAnd David said, \"What have I to do\nwith you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you\nshould be adversaries to me today?\nShall any man be put to death today in\nIsrael? For do I not know that today I am\nking over Israel?\"\nTherefore the king said to Shimei,\n\"You shall not die.\" And the king swore\nto him.\nNow Mephibosheth the son of Saul\ncame down to meet the king. And he\nhad not cared for his feet, nor trimmed\nhis mustache, nor washed his clothes,\nfrom the day the king departed until the\nday he returned in peace.\nSo it was, when he had come to\nJerusalem to meet the king, that the\nking said to him, \"Why did you not go\nwith me, Mephibosheth?\"\nAnd he answered, \"My lord, O king,\nmy servant deceived me. For your\nservant said, \"I will saddle a donkey for\nmyself, that I may ride on it and go to\nthe king,' because your servant is lame.\nSo the king said to him, \"Why do you\nspeak anymore of your matters? I have\nsaid, \"You and Ziba divide the land.\"'\nThen Mephibosheth said to the king,\n\"Rather, let him take it all, inasmuch as\nmy lord the king has come back in\npeace to his own house.\"\nAnd Barzillai the Gileadite came down\nfrom Rogelim and went across the\nJordan with the king, to escort him\nacross the Jordan.\nNow Barzillai was a very aged man,\neighty years old. And he had provided\nthe king with supplies while he stayed at\nMahanaim, for he was a very rich man.\nAnd the king said to Barzillai, \"Come\nacross with me, and I will provide for\nyou while you are with me in\nJerusalem.\"\nBut Barzillai said to the king, \"How\nlong have I to live, that I should go up\nwith the king to Jerusalem?\nAnd he has slandered your servant to\nmy lord the king, but my lord the king is\nlike the angel of God. Therefore do what\nis good in your eyes.\nFor all my father's house were but\ndead men before my lord the king. Yet\nyou set your servant among those who\neat at your own table. Therefore what\nright have I still to cry out anymore to\nthe king?\"\nI am today eighty years old. Can I\ndiscern between the good and bad?\nCan your servant taste what I eat or\nwhat I drink? Can I hear any longer the\nvoice of singing men and singing\nwomen? Why then should your servant\nbe a further burden to my lord the king?\nYour servant will go a little way across\nthe Jordan with the king. And why\nshould the king repay me with such a\nreward?\nPlease let your servant turn back\nagain, that I may die in my own city,\nnear the grave of my father and mother.\nBut here is your servant Chimham; let\nhim cross over with my lord the king,\nand do for him what seems good to\nyou.\"\nAnd the king answered, \"Chimham\nshall cross over with me, and I will do for\nhim what seems good to you. Now\nwhatever you request of me, I will do for\nyou.\"\nThen all the people went over the\nJordan. And when the king had crossed\nover, the king kissed Barzillai and\nblessed him, and he returned to his own\nplace.\nNow the king went on to Gilgal, and\nChimham went on with him. And all the\npeople of Judah escorted the king, and\nalso half the people of Israel.\nJust then all the men of Israel came to\nthe king, and said to the king, \"Why\nhave our brethren, the men of Judah,\nstolen you away and brought the king,\nhis household, and all David's men with\nhim across the Jordan?\"\nSo all the men of Judah answered the\nmen of Israel, \"Because the king is a\nclose relative of ours. Why then are you\nangry over this matter? Have we ever\neaten at the king's expense? Or has he\ngiven us any gift?\"\nAnd the men of Israel answered the\nmen of Judah, and said, \"We have ten\nshares in the king; therefore we also\nhave more right to David than you. Why\nthen do you despise us--were we not\nthe first to advise bringing back our\nking?\" Yet the words of the men of\nJudah were fiercer than the words of the\nmen of Israel.\n20And there happened to be there a\nrebel, whose name was Sheba the son\nof Bichri, a Benjamite. And he blew a\ntrumpet, and said: \"We have no share in\nDavid, Nor do we have inheritance in\nthe son of Jesse; Every man to his tents,\nO Israel!\"\nSo every man of Israel deserted David,\nand followed Sheba the son of Bichri.\nBut the men of Judah, from the Jordan\nas far as Jerusalem, remained loyal to\ntheir king.\nNow David came to his house at\nJerusalem. And the king took the ten\nwomen, his concubines whom he had\nleft to keep the house, and put them in\nseclusion and supported them, but did\nnot go in to them. So they were shut up\nto the day of their death, living in\nwidowhood.\nAnd the king said to Amasa, \"Assemble\nthe men of Judah for me within three\ndays, and be present here yourself.\"\nSo Amasa went to assemble the men\nof Judah. But he delayed longer than\nthe set time which David had appointed\nhim.\nAnd David said to Abishai, \"Now Sheba\nthe son of Bichri will do us more harm\nthan Absalom. Take your lord's servants\nand pursue him, lest he find for himself\nfortified cities, and escape us.\"\nSo Joab's men, with the Cherethites,\nthe Pelethites, and all the mighty men,\nwent out after him. And they went out of\nJerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of\nBichri.\nAnd he went through all the tribes of\nIsrael to Abel and Beth Maachah and all\nthe Berites. So they were gathered\ntogether and also went after Sheba.\nWhen they were at the large stone\nwhich is in Gibeon, Amasa came before\nthem. Now Joab was dressed in battle\narmor; on it was a belt with a sword\nfastened in its sheath at his hips; and as\nhe was going forward, it fell out.\nThen they came and besieged him in\nAbel of Beth Maachah; and they cast up\na siege mound against the city, and it\nstood by the rampart. And all the people\nwho were with Joab battered the wall to\nthrow it down.\nThen Joab said to Amasa, \"Are you in\nhealth, my brother?\" And Joab took\nAmasa by the beard with his right hand\nto kiss him.\nThen a wise woman cried out from the\ncity, \"Hear, hear! Please say to Joab,\n\"Come nearby, that I may speak with\nyou.\"'\nBut Amasa did not notice the sword\nthat was in Joab's hand. And he struck\nhim with it in the stomach, and his\nentrails poured out on the ground; and\nhe did not strike him again. Thus he\ndied. Then Joab and Abishai his brother\npursued Sheba the son of Bichri.\nMeanwhile one of Joab's men stood\nnear Amasa, and said, \"Whoever favors\nJoab and whoever is for David--follow\nJoab!\"\nBut Amasa wallowed in his blood in\nthe middle of the highway. And when\nthe man saw that all the people stood\nstill, he moved Amasa from the highway\nto the field and threw a garment over\nhim, when he saw that everyone who\ncame upon him halted.\nWhen he had come near to her, the\nwoman said, \"Are you Joab?\" He\nanswered, \"I am.\" Then she said to him,\n\"Hear the words of your maidservant.\"\nAnd he answered, \"I am listening.\"\nSo she spoke, saying, \"They used to\ntalk in former times, saying, \"They shall\nsurely seek guidance at Abel,' and so\nthey would end disputes.\nI am among the peaceable and faithful\nin Israel. You seek to destroy a city and\na mother in Israel. Why would you\nswallow up the inheritance of the\nLORD?\"\nAnd Joab answered and said, \"Far be\nit, far be it from me, that I should\nswallow up or destroy!\nWhen he was removed from the\nhighway, all the people went on after\nJoab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.\nThat is not so. But a man from the\nmountains of Ephraim, Sheba the son of\nBichri by name, has raised his hand\nagainst the king, against David. Deliver\nhim only, and I will depart from the city.\"\nSo the woman said to Joab, \"Watch, his\nhead will be thrown to you over the\nwall.\"\nTherefore David said to the Gibeonites,\n\"What shall I do for you? And with what\nshall I make atonement, that you may\nbless the inheritance of the LORD?\"\nThen the woman in her wisdom went\nto all the people. And they cut off the\nhead of Sheba the son of Bichri, and\nthrew it out to Joab. Then he blew a\ntrumpet, and they withdrew from the city,\nevery man to his tent. So Joab returned\nto the king at Jerusalem.\nAnd the Gibeonites said to him, \"We\nwill have no silver or gold from Saul or\nfrom his house, nor shall you kill any\nman in Israel for us.\" So he said,\n\"Whatever you say, I will do for you.\"\nAnd Joab was over all the army of\nIsrael; Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was\nover the Cherethites and the Pelethites;\nThen they answered the king, \"As for\nthe man who consumed us and plotted\nagainst us, that we should be destroyed\nfrom remaining in any of the territories of\nIsrael,\nAdoram was in charge of revenue;\nJehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was\nrecorder;\nSheva was scribe; Zadok and Abiathar\nwere the priests;\nlet seven men of his descendants be\ndelivered to us, and we will hang them\nbefore the LORD in Gibeah of Saul,\nwhom the LORD chose.\" And the king\nsaid, \"I will give them.\"\nand Ira the Jairite was a chief minister\nunder David.\n21Now there was a famine in the\ndays of David for three years, year after\nyear; and David inquired of the LORD.\nAnd the LORD answered, \"It is because\nof Saul and his bloodthirsty house,\nbecause he killed the Gibeonites.\"\nSo the king called the Gibeonites and\nspoke to them. Now the Gibeonites\nwere not of the children of Israel, but of\nthe remnant of the Amorites; the\nchildren of Israel had sworn protection\nto them, but Saul had sought to kill them\nin his zeal for the children of Israel and\nJudah.\nBut the king spared Mephibosheth the\nson of Jonathan, the son of Saul,\nbecause of the LORD's oath that was\nbetween them, between David and\nJonathan the son of Saul.\nSo the king took Armoni and\nMephibosheth, the two sons of Rizpah\nthe daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to\nSaul, and the five sons of Michal the\ndaughter of Saul, whom she brought up\nfor Adriel the son of Barzillai the\nMeholathite;\nand he delivered them into the hands of\nthe Gibeonites, and they hanged them\non the hill before the LORD. So they fell,\nall seven together, and were put to\ndeath in the days of harvest, in the first\ndays, in the beginning of barley harvest.\nNow Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took\nsackcloth and spread it for herself on\nthe rock, from the beginning of harvest\nuntil the late rains poured on them from\nheaven. And she did not allow the birds\nof the air to rest on them by day nor the\nbeasts of the field by night.\nBut Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to\nhis aid, and struck the Philistine and\nkilled him. Then the men of David swore\nto him, saying, \"You shall go out no\nmore with us to battle, lest you quench\nthe lamp of Israel.\"\nAnd David was told what Rizpah the\ndaughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul,\nhad done.\nNow it happened afterward that there\nwas again a battle with the Philistines at\nGob. Then Sibbechai the Hushathite\nkilled Saph, who was one of the sons of\nthe giant.\nThen David went and took the bones\nof Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his\nson, from the men of Jabesh Gilead who\nhad stolen them from the street of Beth\nShan, where the Philistines had hung\nthem up, after the Philistines had struck\ndown Saul in Gilboa.\nAgain there was war at Gob with the\nPhilistines, where Elhanan the son of\nJaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed\nthe brother of Goliath the Gittite, the\nshaft of whose spear was like a\nweaver's beam.\nSo he brought up the bones of Saul\nand the bones of Jonathan his son from\nthere; and they gathered the bones of\nthose who had been hanged.\nThey buried the bones of Saul and\nJonathan his son in the country of\nBenjamin in Zelah, in the tomb of Kish\nhis father. So they performed all that the\nking commanded. And after that God\nheeded the prayer for the land.\nYet again there was war at Gath,\nwhere there was a man of great stature,\nwho had six fingers on each hand and\nsix toes on each foot, twenty-four in\nnumber; and he also was born to the\ngiant.\nSo when he defied Israel, Jonathan\nthe son of Shimea, David's brother,\nkilled him.\nWhen the Philistines were at war again\nwith Israel, David and his servants with\nhim went down and fought against the\nPhilistines; and David grew faint.\nThen Ishbi-Benob, who was one of the\nsons of the giant, the weight of whose\nbronze spear was three hundred\nshekels, who was bearing a new sword,\nthought he could kill David.\nThese four were born to the giant in\nGath, and fell by the hand of David and\nby the hand of his servants.\n22Then David spoke to the LORD\nthe words of this song, on the day when\nthe LORD had delivered him from the\nhand of all his enemies, and from the\nhand of Saul.\nAnd he said: \"The LORD is my rock\nand my fortress and my deliverer;\nFrom the brightness before Him Coals\nof fire were kindled.\nThe God of my strength, in whom I will\ntrust; My shield and the horn of my\nsalvation, My stronghold and my refuge;\nMy Savior, You save me from violence.\nI will call upon the LORD, who is worthy\nto be praised; So shall I be saved from\nmy enemies.\n\"When the waves of death surrounded\nme, The floods of ungodliness made me\nafraid.\n\"The LORD thundered from heaven,\nAnd the Most High uttered His voice.\nHe sent out arrows and scattered\nthem;\nLightning\nbolts,\nand\nHe\nvanquished them.\nThen the channels of the sea were\nseen, The foundations of the world were\nuncovered, At the rebuke of the LORD,\nAt the blast of the breath of His nostrils.\nThe sorrows of Sheol surrounded me;\nThe snares of death confronted me.\n\"He sent from above, He took me, He\ndrew me out of many waters.\nIn my distress I called upon the LORD,\nAnd cried out to my God; He heard my\nvoice from His temple, And my cry\nentered His ears.\n\"Then the earth shook and trembled;\nThe foundations of heaven quaked and\nwere shaken, Because He was angry.\nSmoke went up from His nostrils, And\ndevouring fire from His mouth; Coals\nwere kindled by it.\nHe bowed the heavens also, and\ncame down With darkness under His\nfeet.\nHe rode upon a cherub, and flew; And\nHe was seen upon the wings of the wind.\nHe delivered me from my strong\nenemy, From those who hated me; For\nthey were too strong for me.\nThey confronted me in the day of my\ncalamity, But the LORD was my support.\nHe also brought me out into a broad\nplace; He delivered me because He\ndelighted in me.\n\"The LORD rewarded me according to\nmy righteousness; According to the\ncleanness of my hands He has\nrecompensed me.\nFor I have kept the ways of the LORD,\nAnd have not wickedly departed from\nmy God.\nHe made darkness canopies around\nHim, Dark waters and thick clouds of the\nskies.\nFor all His judgments were before me;\nAnd as for His statutes, I did not depart\nfrom them.\nI was also blameless before Him, And\nI kept myself from my iniquity.\n\"You have also given me the shield of\nYour salvation; Your gentleness has\nmade me great.\nTherefore\nthe\nLORD\nhas\nrecompensed me according to my\nrighteousness,\nAccording\nto\nmy\ncleanness in His eyes.\nYou enlarged my path under me; So\nmy feet did not slip.\n\"With the merciful You will show\nYourself merciful; With a blameless man\nYou will show Yourself blameless;\n\"I have pursued my enemies and\ndestroyed them; Neither did I turn back\nagain till they were destroyed.\nWith the pure You will show Yourself\npure; And with the devious You will\nshow Yourself shrewd.\nAnd I have destroyed them and\nwounded them, So that they could not\nrise; They have fallen under my feet.\nYou will save the humble people; But\nYour eyes are on the haughty, that You\nmay bring them down.\nFor You have armed me with strength\nfor the battle; You have subdued under\nme those who rose against me.\n\"For You are my lamp, O LORD; The\nLORD shall enlighten my darkness.\nYou have also given me the necks of\nmy enemies, So that I destroyed those\nwho hated me.\nFor by You I can run against a troop;\nBy my God I can leap over a wall.\nThey looked, but there was none to\nsave; Even to the LORD, but He did not\nanswer them.\nAs for God, His way is perfect; The\nword of the LORD is proven; He is a\nshield to all who trust in Him.\nThen I beat them as fine as the dust of\nthe earth; I trod them like dirt in the\nstreets, And I spread them out.\n\"For who is God, except the LORD?\nAnd who is a rock, except our God?\nGod is my strength and power, And He\nmakes my way perfect.\n\"You have also delivered me from the\nstrivings of my people; You have kept\nme as the head of the nations. A people\nI have not known shall serve me.\nHe makes my feet like the feet of deer,\nAnd sets me on my high places.\nThe foreigners submit to me; As soon\nas they hear, they obey me.\nHe teaches my hands to make war, So\nthat my arms can bend a bow of bronze.\nThe foreigners fade away, And come\nfrightened from their hideouts.\n\"The LORD lives! Blessed be my\nRock! Let God be exalted, The Rock of\nmy salvation!\nIt is God who avenges me, And\nsubdues the peoples under me;\n\"Although my house is not so with God,\nYet He has made with me an everlasting\ncovenant, Ordered in all things and\nsecure. For this is all my salvation and\nall my desire; Will He not make it\nincrease?\nHe delivers me from my enemies. You\nalso lift me up above those who rise\nagainst me; You have delivered me from\nthe violent man.\nBut the sons of rebellion shall all be as\nthorns thrust away, Because they\ncannot be taken with hands.\nTherefore I will give thanks to You, O\nLORD, among the Gentiles, And sing\npraises to Your name.\nBut the man who touches them Must be\narmed with iron and the shaft of a spear,\nAnd they shall be utterly burned with fire\nin their place.\"\nHe is the tower of salvation to His king,\nAnd shows mercy to His anointed, To\nDavid\nand\nhis\ndescendants\nforevermore.\"\n23Now these are the last words of\nDavid. Thus says David the son of\nJesse; Thus says the man raised up on\nhigh, The anointed of the God of Jacob,\nAnd the sweet psalmist of Israel:\n\"The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me,\nAnd His word was on my tongue.\nThese are the names of the mighty\nmen whom David had: JoshebBasshebeth the Tachmonite, chief\namong the captains. He was called\nAdino the Eznite, because he had killed\neight hundred men at one time.\nAnd after him was Eleazar the son of\nDodo, the Ahohite, one of the three\nmighty men with David when they defied\nthe Philistines who were gathered there\nfor battle, and the men of Israel had\nretreated.\nThe God of Israel said, The Rock of\nIsrael spoke to me: \"He who rules over\nmen must be just, Ruling in the fear of\nGod.\nHe arose and attacked the Philistines\nuntil his hand was weary, and his hand\nstuck to the sword. The LORD brought\nabout a great victory that day; and the\npeople returned after him only to\nplunder.\nAnd he shall be like the light of the\nmorning when the sun rises, A morning\nwithout clouds, Like the tender grass\nspringing out of the earth, By clear\nshining after rain.'\nAnd after him was Shammah the son\nof Agee the Hararite. The Philistines had\ngathered together into a troop where\nthere was a piece of ground full of lentils.\nSo the people fled from the Philistines.\nBut he stationed himself in the middle\nof the field, defended it, and killed the\nPhilistines. So the LORD brought about\na great victory.\nThen three of the thirty chief men went\ndown at harvest time and came to David\nat the cave of Adullam. And the troop of\nPhilistines encamped in the Valley of\nRephaim.\ncaptain. However, he did not attain to\nthe first three.\nBenaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the\nson of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who\nhad done many deeds. He had killed\ntwo lion-like heroes of Moab. He also\nhad gone down and killed a lion in the\nmidst of a pit on a snowy day.\nDavid was then in the stronghold, and\nthe garrison of the Philistines was then\nin Bethlehem.\nAnd David said with longing, \"Oh, that\nsomeone would give me a drink of the\nwater from the well of Bethlehem, which\nis by the gate!\"\nAnd he killed an Egyptian, a\nspectacular man. The Egyptian had a\nspear in his hand; so he went down to\nhim with a staff, wrested the spear out of\nthe Egyptian's hand, and killed him with\nhis own spear.\nThese things Benaiah the son of\nJehoiada did, and won a name among\nthree mighty men.\nSo the three mighty men broke\nthrough the camp of the Philistines,\ndrew water from the well of Bethlehem\nthat was by the gate, and took it and\nbrought it to David. Nevertheless he\nwould not drink it, but poured it out to\nthe LORD.\nAnd he said, \"Far be it from me, O\nLORD, that I should do this! Is this not\nthe blood of the men who went in\njeopardy of their lives?\" Therefore he\nwould not drink it. These things were\ndone by the three mighty men.\nNow Abishai the brother of Joab, the\nson of Zeruiah, was chief of another\nthree. He lifted his spear against three\nhundred men, killed them, and won a\nname among these three.\nWas he not the most honored of\nthree? Therefore he became their\nHe was more honored than the thirty,\nbut he did not attain to the first three.\nAnd David appointed him over his guard.\nAsahel the brother of Joab was one of\nthe thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of\nBethlehem,\nShammah the Harodite, Elika the\nHarodite,\nHelez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh\nthe Tekoite,\nAbiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the\nHushathite,\nZalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the\nNetophathite,\nHeleb the son of Baanah (the\nNetophathite), Ittai the son of Ribai from\nGibeah of the children of Benjamin,\nIsrael, from Dan to Beersheba, and\ncount the people, that I may know the\nnumber of the people.\"\nBenaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai from the\nbrooks of Gaash,\nAbi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the\nBarhumite,\nAnd Joab said to the king, \"Now may\nthe LORD your God add to the people a\nhundred times more than there are, and\nmay the eyes of my lord the king see it.\nBut why does my lord the king desire\nthis thing?\"\nEliahba the Shaalbonite (of the sons of\nJashen), Jonathan,\nShammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son\nof Sharar the Hararite,\nEliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son\nof the Maachathite, Eliam the son of\nAhithophel the Gilonite,\nHezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,\nIgal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani\nthe Gadite,\nZelek the Ammonite, Naharai the\nBeerothite (armorbearer of Joab the son\nof Zeruiah),\nIra the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,\nand Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.\n24Again the anger of the LORD was\naroused against Israel, and He moved\nDavid against them to say, \"Go, number\nIsrael and Judah.\"\nSo the king said to Joab the\ncommander of the army who was with\nhim, \"Now go throughout all the tribes of\nNevertheless the king's word prevailed\nagainst Joab and against the captains of\nthe army. Therefore Joab and the\ncaptains of the army went out from the\npresence of the king to count the people\nof Israel.\nAnd they crossed over the Jordan and\ncamped in Aroer, on the right side of the\ntown which is in the midst of the ravine\nof Gad, and toward Jazer.\nThen they came to Gilead and to the\nland of Tahtim Hodshi; they came to\nDan Jaan and around to Sidon;\nand they came to the stronghold of\nTyre and to all the cities of the Hivites\nand the Canaanites. Then they went out\nto South Judah as far as Beersheba.\nSo when they had gone through all the\nland, they came to Jerusalem at the end\nof nine months and twenty days.\nThen Joab gave the sum of the number\nof the people to the king. And there\nwere in Israel eight hundred thousand\nvaliant men who drew the sword, and\nthe men of Judah were five hundred\nthousand men.\nAnd David's heart condemned him\nafter he had numbered the people. So\nDavid said to the LORD, \"I have sinned\ngreatly in what I have done; but now, I\npray, O LORD, take away the iniquity of\nYour servant, for I have done very\nfoolishly.\"\nNow when David arose in the morning,\nthe word of the LORD came to the\nprophet Gad, David's seer, saying,\nof the LORD was by the threshing floor\nof Araunah the Jebusite.\nThen David spoke to the LORD when\nhe saw the angel who was striking the\npeople, and said, \"Surely I have sinned,\nand I have done wickedly; but these\nsheep, what have they done? Let Your\nhand, I pray, be against me and against\nmy father's house.\"\n\"Go and tell David, \"Thus says the\nLORD: \"I offer you three things; choose\none of them for yourself, that I may do it\nto you.\"\"'\nAnd Gad came that day to David and\nsaid to him, \"Go up, erect an altar to the\nLORD on the threshing floor of Araunah\nthe Jebusite.\"\nSo Gad came to David and told him;\nand he said to him, \"Shall seven years\nof famine come to you in your land? Or\nshall you flee three months before your\nenemies, while they pursue you? Or\nshall there be three days' plague in your\nland? Now consider and see what\nanswer I should take back to Him who\nsent me.\"\nAnd David said to Gad, \"I am in great\ndistress. Please let us fall into the hand\nof the LORD, for His mercies are great;\nbut do not let me fall into the hand of\nman.\"\nSo David, according to the word of\nGad, went up as the LORD commanded.\nNow Araunah looked, and saw the\nking and his servants coming toward\nhim. So Araunah went out and bowed\nbefore the king with his face to the\nground.\nThen Araunah said, \"Why has my lord\nthe king come to his servant?\" And\nDavid said, \"To buy the threshing floor\nfrom you, to build an altar to the LORD,\nthat the plague may be withdrawn from\nthe people.\"\nSo the LORD sent a plague upon\nIsrael from the morning till the appointed\ntime. From Dan to Beersheba seventy\nthousand men of the people died.\nAnd when the angel stretched out His\nhand over Jerusalem to destroy it, the\nLORD relented from the destruction,\nand said to the angel who was\ndestroying the people, \"It is enough;\nnow restrain your hand.\" And the angel\nNow Araunah said to David, \"Let my\nlord the king take and offer up whatever\nseems good to him. Look, here are oxen\nfor burnt sacrifice, and threshing\nimplements and the yokes of the oxen\nfor wood.\nAll these, O king, Araunah has given\nto the king.\" And Araunah said to the\nking, \"May the LORD your God accept\nyou.\"\nThen the king said to Araunah, \"No,\nbut I will surely buy it from you for a\nprice; nor will I offer burnt offerings to\nthe LORD my God with that which costs\nme nothing.\" So David bought the\nthreshing floor and the oxen for fifty\nshekels of silver.\nAnd David built there an altar to the\nLORD, and offered burnt offerings and\npeace offerings. So the LORD heeded\nthe prayers for the land, and the plague\nwas withdrawn from Israel.\n1st Kings\n1Now King David was old, advanced\nin years; and they put covers on him,\nbut he could not get warm.\nTherefore his servants said to him, \"Let\na young woman, a virgin, be sought for\nour lord the king, and let her stand\nbefore the king, and let her care for him;\nand let her lie in your bosom, that our\nlord the king may be warm.\"\nSo they sought for a lovely young\nwoman throughout all the territory of\nIsrael,\nand\nfound\nAbishag\nthe\nShunammite, and brought her to the\nking.\nThe young woman was very lovely; and\nshe cared for the king, and served him;\nbut the king did not know her.\nThen Adonijah the son of Haggith\nexalted himself, saying, \"I will be king\";\nand he prepared for himself chariots and\nhorsemen, and fifty men to run before\nhim.\n(And his father had not rebuked him at\nany time by saying, \"Why have you\ndone so?\" He was also very goodlooking. His mother had borne him after\nAbsalom.)\nThen he conferred with Joab the son of\nZeruiah and with Abiathar the priest,\nand they followed and helped Adonijah.\nBut Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son\nof Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei,\nRei, and the mighty men who belonged\nto David were not with Adonijah.\nAnd Adonijah sacrificed sheep and\noxen and fattened cattle by the stone of\nZoheleth, which is by En Rogel; he also\ninvited all his brothers, the king's sons,\nand all the men of Judah, the king's\nservants.\nBut he did not invite Nathan the\nprophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or\nSolomon his brother.\nSo Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the\nmother of Solomon, saying, \"Have you\nnot heard that Adonijah the son of\nHaggith has become king, and David\nour lord does not know it?\nCome, please, let me now give you\nadvice, that you may save your own life\nand the life of your son Solomon.\nGo immediately to King David and say\nto him, \"Did you not, my lord, O king,\nswear to your maidservant, saying,\n\"Assuredly your son Solomon shall reign\nafter me, and he shall sit on my throne\"?\nWhy then has Adonijah become king?'\nThen, while you are still talking there\nwith the king, I also will come in after\nyou and confirm your words.\"\nSo Bathsheba went into the chamber\nto the king. (Now the king was very old,\nand Abishag the Shunammite was\nserving the king.)\nAnd Nathan said, \"My lord, O king,\nhave you said, \"Adonijah shall reign\nafter me, and he shall sit on my throne'?\nAnd Bathsheba bowed and did\nhomage to the king. Then the king said,\n\"What is your wish?\"\nThen she said to him, \"My lord, you\nswore by the LORD your God to your\nmaidservant,\nsaying,\n\"Assuredly\nSolomon your son shall reign after me,\nand he shall sit on my throne.'\nFor he has gone down today, and has\nsacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and\nsheep in abundance, and has invited all\nthe king's sons, and the commanders of\nthe army, and Abiathar the priest; and\nlook! They are eating and drinking\nbefore him; and they say, \"Long live\nKing Adonijah!'\nSo now, look! Adonijah has become\nking; and now, my lord the king, you do\nnot know about it.\nBut he has not invited me--me your\nservant--nor Zadok the priest, nor\nBenaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your\nservant Solomon.\nHe has sacrificed oxen and fattened\ncattle and sheep in abundance, and has\ninvited all the sons of the king, Abiathar\nthe priest, and Joab the commander of\nthe army; but Solomon your servant he\nhas not invited.\nAnd as for you, my lord, O king, the\neyes of all Israel are on you, that you\nshould tell them who will sit on the\nthrone of my lord the king after him.\nOtherwise it will happen, when my lord\nthe king rests with his fathers, that I and\nmy son Solomon will be counted as\noffenders.\"\nHas this thing been done by my lord\nthe king, and you have not told your\nservant who should sit on the throne of\nmy lord the king after him?\"\nThen King David answered and said,\n\"Call Bathsheba to me.\" So she came\ninto the king's presence and stood\nbefore the king.\nAnd the king took an oath and said,\n\"As the LORD lives, who has redeemed\nmy life from every distress,\nAnd just then, while she was still\ntalking with the king, Nathan the prophet\nalso came in.\njust as I swore to you by the LORD\nGod of Israel, saying, \"Assuredly\nSolomon your son shall be king after me,\nand he shall sit on my throne in my\nplace,' so I certainly will do this day.\"\nSo they told the king, saying, \"Here is\nNathan the prophet.\" And when he\ncame in before the king, he bowed down\nbefore the king with his face to the\nground.\nThen Bathsheba bowed with her face\nto the earth, and paid homage to the\nking, and said, \"Let my lord King David\nlive forever!\"\nAnd King David said, \"Call to me\nZadok the priest, Nathan the prophet,\nand Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.\" So\nthey came before the king.\nAnd all the people went up after him;\nand the people played the flutes and\nrejoiced with great joy, so that the earth\nseemed to split with their sound.\nThe king also said to them, \"Take with\nyou the servants of your lord, and have\nSolomon my son ride on my own mule,\nand take him down to Gihon.\nNow Adonijah and all the guests who\nwere with him heard it as they finished\neating. And when Joab heard the sound\nof the horn, he said, \"Why is the city in\nsuch a noisy uproar?\"\nThere let Zadok the priest and Nathan\nthe prophet anoint him king over Israel;\nand blow the horn, and say, \"Long live\nKing Solomon!'\nWhile he was still speaking, there\ncame Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the\npriest. And Adonijah said to him, \"Come\nin, for you are a prominent man, and\nbring good news.\"\nThen you shall come up after him, and\nhe shall come and sit on my throne, and\nhe shall be king in my place. For I have\nappointed him to be ruler over Israel and\nJudah.\"\nThen Jonathan answered and said to\nAdonijah, \"No! Our lord King David has\nmade Solomon king.\nBenaiah the son of Jehoiada\nanswered the king and said, \"Amen!\nMay the LORD God of my lord the king\nsay so too.\nThe king has sent with him Zadok the\npriest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the\nson of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and\nthe Pelethites; and they have made him\nride on the king's mule.\nAs the LORD has been with my lord\nthe king, even so may He be with\nSolomon, and make his throne greater\nthan the throne of my lord King David.\"\nSo Zadok the priest, Nathan the\nprophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,\nthe Cherethites, and the Pelethites went\ndown and had Solomon ride on King\nDavid's mule, and took him to Gihon.\nThen Zadok the priest took a horn of\noil from the tabernacle and anointed\nSolomon. And they blew the horn, and\nall the people said, \"Long live King\nSolomon!\"\nSo Zadok the priest and Nathan the\nprophet have anointed him king at\nGihon; and they have gone up from\nthere rejoicing, so that the city is in an\nuproar. This is the noise that you have\nheard.\nAlso Solomon sits on the throne of the\nkingdom.\nAnd moreover the king's servants have\ngone to bless our lord King David,\nsaying, \"May God make the name of\nSolomon better than your name, and\nmay He make his throne greater than\nyour throne.' Then the king bowed\nhimself on the bed.\nAlso the king said thus, \"Blessed be\nthe LORD God of Israel, who has given\none to sit on my throne this day, while\nmy eyes see it!\"'\nAnd keep the charge of the LORD your\nGod: to walk in His ways, to keep His\nstatutes, His commandments, His\njudgments, and His testimonies, as it is\nwritten in the Law of Moses, that you\nmay prosper in all that you do and\nwherever you turn;\nSo all the guests who were with\nAdonijah were afraid, and arose, and\neach one went his way.\nNow Adonijah was afraid of Solomon;\nso he arose, and went and took hold of\nthe horns of the altar.\nAnd it was told Solomon, saying,\n\"Indeed Adonijah is afraid of King\nSolomon; for look, he has taken hold of\nthe horns of the altar, saying, \"Let King\nSolomon swear to me today that he will\nnot put his servant to death with the\nsword.\"'\nThen Solomon said, \"If he proves\nhimself a worthy man, not one hair of\nhim shall fall to the earth; but if\nwickedness is found in him, he shall\ndie.\"\nSo King Solomon sent them to bring\nhim down from the altar. And he came\nand fell down before King Solomon; and\nSolomon said to him, \"Go to your\nhouse.\"\nthat the LORD may fulfill His word\nwhich He spoke concerning me, saying,\n\"If your sons take heed to their way, to\nwalk before Me in truth with all their\nheart and with all their soul,' He said,\n\"you shall not lack a man on the throne\nof Israel.'\n\"Moreover you know also what Joab\nthe son of Zeruiah did to me, and what\nhe did to the two commanders of the\narmies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner\nand Amasa the son of Jether, whom he\nkilled. And he shed the blood of war in\npeacetime, and put the blood of war on\nhis belt that was around his waist, and\non his sandals that were on his feet.\nTherefore do according to your wisdom,\nand do not let his gray hair go down to\nthe grave in peace.\n\"But show kindness to the sons of\nBarzillai the Gileadite, and let them be\namong those who eat at your table, for\nso they came to me when I fled from\nAbsalom your brother.\n2Now the days of David drew near\nthat he should die, and he charged\nSolomon his son, saying:\n\"I go the way of all the earth; be strong,\ntherefore, and prove yourself a man.\n\"And see, you have with you Shimei the\nson of Gera, a Benjamite from Bahurim,\nwho cursed me with a malicious curse in\nthe day when I went to Mahanaim. But\nhe came down to meet me at the Jordan,\nand I swore to him by the LORD, saying,\n\"I will not put you to death with the\nsword.'\nNow therefore, do not hold him guiltless,\nfor you are a wise man and know what\nyou ought to do to him; but bring his\ngray hair down to the grave with blood.\"\nSo David rested with his fathers, and\nwas buried in the City of David.\nBathsheba therefore went to King\nSolomon, to speak to him for Adonijah.\nAnd the king rose up to meet her and\nbowed down to her, and sat down on his\nthrone and had a throne set for the\nking's mother; so she sat at his right\nhand.\nThe period that David reigned over\nIsrael was forty years; seven years he\nreigned in Hebron, and in Jerusalem he\nreigned thirty-three years.\nThen she said, \"I desire one small\npetition of you; do not refuse me.\" And\nthe king said to her, \"Ask it, my mother,\nfor I will not refuse you.\"\nThen Solomon sat on the throne of his\nfather David; and his kingdom was firmly\nestablished.\nSo she said, \"Let Abishag the\nShunammite be given to Adonijah your\nbrother as wife.\"\nNow Adonijah the son of Haggith\ncame to Bathsheba the mother of\nSolomon. So she said, \"Do you come\npeaceably?\" And he said, \"Peaceably.\"\nMoreover he said, \"I have something\nto say to you.\" And she said, \"Say it.\"\nThen he said, \"You know that the\nkingdom was mine, and all Israel had\nset their expectations on me, that I\nshould reign. However, the kingdom has\nbeen turned over, and has become my\nbrother's; for it was his from the LORD.\nNow I ask one petition of you; do not\ndeny me.\" And she said to him, \"Say it.\"\nThen he said, \"Please speak to King\nSolomon, for he will not refuse you, that\nhe may give me Abishag the\nShunammite as wife.\"\nSo Bathsheba said, \"Very well, I will\nspeak for you to the king.\"\nAnd King Solomon answered and said\nto his mother, \"Now why do you ask\nAbishag the Shunammite for Adonijah?\nAsk for him the kingdom also--for he is\nmy older brother--for him, and for\nAbiathar the priest, and for Joab the son\nof Zeruiah.\"\nThen King Solomon swore by the\nLORD, saying, \"May God do so to me,\nand more also, if Adonijah has not\nspoken this word against his own life!\nNow therefore, as the LORD lives,\nwho has confirmed me and set me on\nthe throne of David my father, and who\nhas established a house for me, as He\npromised, Adonijah shall be put to death\ntoday!\"\nSo King Solomon sent by the hand of\nBenaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he\nstruck him down, and he died.\nAnd to Abiathar the priest the king said,\n\"Go to Anathoth, to your own fields, for\nyou are deserving of death; but I will not\nput you to death at this time, because\nyou carried the ark of the Lord GOD\nbefore my father David, and because\nyou were afflicted every time my father\nwas afflicted.\"\nSo Solomon removed Abiathar from\nbeing priest to the LORD, that he might\nfulfill the word of the LORD which He\nspoke concerning the house of Eli at\nShiloh.\nThen news came to Joab, for Joab\nhad defected to Adonijah, though he\nhad not defected to Absalom. So Joab\nfled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and\ntook hold of the horns of the altar.\nAnd King Solomon was told, \"Joab has\nfled to the tabernacle of the LORD;\nthere he is, by the altar.\" Then Solomon\nsent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,\nsaying, \"Go, strike him down.\"\nSo Benaiah went to the tabernacle of\nthe LORD, and said to him, \"Thus says\nthe king, \"Come out!\"' And he said, \"No,\nbut I will die here.\" And Benaiah brought\nback word to the king, saying, \"Thus\nsaid Joab, and thus he answered me.\"\nJether, the commander of the army of\nJudah--though my father David did not\nknow it.\nTheir blood shall therefore return upon\nthe head of Joab and upon the head of\nhis descendants forever. But upon\nDavid and his descendants, upon his\nhouse and his throne, there shall be\npeace forever from the LORD.\"\nSo Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went\nup and struck and killed him; and he\nwas buried in his own house in the\nwilderness.\nThe king put Benaiah the son of\nJehoiada in his place over the army, and\nthe king put Zadok the priest in the\nplace of Abiathar.\nThen the king sent and called for\nShimei, and said to him, \"Build yourself\na house in Jerusalem and dwell there,\nand do not go out from there anywhere.\nFor it shall be, on the day you go out\nand cross the Brook Kidron, know for\ncertain you shall surely die; your blood\nshall be on your own head.\"\nThen the king said to him, \"Do as he\nhas said, and strike him down and bury\nhim, that you may take away from me\nand from the house of my father the\ninnocent blood which Joab shed.\nSo the LORD will return his blood on\nhis head, because he struck down two\nmen more righteous and better than he,\nand killed them with the sword--Abner\nthe son of Ner, the commander of the\narmy of Israel, and Amasa the son of\nAnd Shimei said to the king, \"The\nsaying is good. As my lord the king has\nsaid, so your servant will do.\" So Shimei\ndwelt in Jerusalem many days.\nNow it happened at the end of three\nyears, that two slaves of Shimei ran\naway to Achish the son of Maachah,\nking of Gath. And they told Shimei,\nsaying, \"Look, your slaves are in Gath!\"\nSo Shimei arose, saddled his donkey,\nand went to Achish at Gath to seek his\nslaves. And Shimei went and brought\nhis slaves from Gath.\nbuilding his own house, and the house\nof the LORD, and the wall all around\nJerusalem.\nAnd Solomon was told that Shimei had\ngone from Jerusalem to Gath and had\ncome back.\nMeanwhile the people sacrificed at the\nhigh places, because there was no\nhouse built for the name of the LORD\nuntil those days.\nThen the king sent and called for\nShimei, and said to him, \"Did I not make\nyou swear by the LORD, and warn you,\nsaying, \"Know for certain that on the day\nyou go out and travel anywhere, you\nshall surely die'? And you said to me,\n\"The word I have heard is good.'\nWhy then have you not kept the oath\nof the LORD and the commandment\nthat I gave you?\"\nThe king said moreover to Shimei,\n\"You know, as your heart acknowledges,\nall the wickedness that you did to my\nfather David; therefore the LORD will\nreturn your wickedness on your own\nhead.\nAnd Solomon loved the LORD, walking\nin the statutes of his father David,\nexcept that he sacrificed and burned\nincense at the high places.\nNow the king went to Gibeon to\nsacrifice there, for that was the great\nhigh place: Solomon offered a thousand\nburnt offerings on that altar.\nAt Gibeon the LORD appeared to\nSolomon in a dream by night; and God\nsaid, \"Ask! What shall I give you?\"\nBut King Solomon shall be blessed,\nand the throne of David shall be\nestablished before the LORD forever.\"\nAnd Solomon said: \"You have shown\ngreat mercy to Your servant David my\nfather, because he walked before You in\ntruth, in righteousness, and in\nuprightness of heart with You; You have\ncontinued this great kindness for him,\nand You have given him a son to sit on\nhis throne, as it is this day.\nSo the king commanded Benaiah the\nson of Jehoiada; and he went out and\nstruck him down, and he died. Thus the\nkingdom was established in the hand of\nSolomon.\nNow, O LORD my God, You have\nmade Your servant king instead of my\nfather David, but I am a little child; I do\nnot know how to go out or come in.\n3Now Solomon made a treaty with\nPharaoh king of Egypt, and married\nPharaoh's daughter; then he brought her\nto the City of David until he had finished\nAnd Your servant is in the midst of Your\npeople whom You have chosen, a great\npeople, too numerous to be numbered\nor counted.\nTherefore give to Your servant an\nunderstanding heart to judge Your\npeople, that I may discern between\ngood and evil. For who is able to judge\nthis great people of Yours?\"\nAnd one woman said, \"O my lord, this\nwoman and I dwell in the same house;\nand I gave birth while she was in the\nhouse.\nThe speech pleased the LORD, that\nSolomon had asked this thing.\nThen God said to him: \"Because you\nhave asked this thing, and have not\nasked long life for yourself, nor have\nasked riches for yourself, nor have\nasked the life of your enemies, but have\nasked for yourself understanding to\ndiscern justice,\nbehold, I have done according to your\nwords; see, I have given you a wise and\nunderstanding heart, so that there has\nnot been anyone like you before you,\nnor shall any like you arise after you.\nAnd I have also given you what you\nhave not asked: both riches and honor,\nso that there shall not be anyone like\nyou among the kings all your days.\nThen it happened, the third day after I\nhad given birth, that this woman also\ngave birth. And we were together; no\none was with us in the house, except\nthe two of us in the house.\nAnd this woman's son died in the night,\nbecause she lay on him.\nSo she arose in the middle of the night\nand took my son from my side, while\nyour maidservant slept, and laid him in\nher bosom, and laid her dead child in\nmy bosom.\nAnd when I rose in the morning to\nnurse my son, there he was, dead. But\nwhen I had examined him in the\nmorning, indeed, he was not my son\nwhom I had borne.\"\nSo if you walk in My ways, to keep My\nstatutes and My commandments, as\nyour father David walked, then I will\nlengthen your days.\"\nThen the other woman said, \"No! But\nthe living one is my son, and the dead\none is your son.\" And the first woman\nsaid, \"No! But the dead one is your son,\nand the living one is my son.\" Thus they\nspoke before the king.\nThen Solomon awoke; and indeed it\nhad been a dream. And he came to\nJerusalem and stood before the ark of\nthe covenant of the LORD, offered up\nburnt offerings, offered peace offerings,\nand made a feast for all his servants.\nAnd the king said, \"The one says,\n\"This is my son, who lives, and your son\nis the dead one'; and the other says,\n\"No! But your son is the dead one, and\nmy son is the living one.'\nNow two women who were harlots\ncame to the king, and stood before him.\nThen the king said, \"Bring me a\nsword.\" So they brought a sword before\nthe king.\nAnd the king said, \"Divide the living\nchild in two, and give half to one, and\nhalf to the other.\"\nAnd Solomon had twelve governors\nover all Israel, who provided food for the\nking and his household; each one made\nprovision for one month of the year.\nThen the woman whose son was living\nspoke to the king, for she yearned with\ncompassion for her son; and she said,\n\"O my lord, give her the living child, and\nby no means kill him!\" But the other said,\n\"Let him be neither mine nor yours, but\ndivide him.\"\nThese are their names: Ben-Hur, in the\nmountains of Ephraim;\nBen-Deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth\nShemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan;\nSo the king answered and said, \"Give\nthe first woman the living child, and by\nno means kill him; she is his mother.\"\nBen-Hesed, in Arubboth; to him\nbelonged Sochoh and all the land of\nHepher;\nAnd all Israel heard of the judgment\nwhich the king had rendered; and they\nfeared the king, for they saw that the\nwisdom of God was in him to administer\njustice.\n4So King Solomon was king over all\nIsrael.\nAnd these were his officials: Azariah\nthe son of Zadok, the priest;\nElihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of\nShisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of\nAhilud, the recorder;\nBenaiah the son of Jehoiada, over the\narmy; Zadok and Abiathar, the priests;\nAzariah the son of Nathan, over the\nofficers; Zabud the son of Nathan, a\npriest and the king's friend;\nAhishar, over the household; and\nAdoniram the son of Abda, over the\nlabor force.\nBen-Abinadab, in all the regions of\nDor; he had Taphath the daughter of\nSolomon as wife;\nBaana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach,\nMegiddo, and all Beth Shean, which is\nbeside Zaretan below Jezreel, from Beth\nShean to Abel Meholah, as far as the\nother side of Jokneam;\nBen-Geber, in Ramoth Gilead; to him\nbelonged the towns of Jair the son of\nManasseh, in Gilead; to him also\nbelonged the region of Argob in Bashan-sixty large cities with walls and bronze\ngate-bars;\nAhinadab\nMahanaim;\nthe\nson\nof\nIddo,\nin\nAhimaaz, in Naphtali; he also took\nBasemath the daughter of Solomon as\nwife;\nBaanah the son of Hushai, in Asher\nand Aloth;\nJehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in\nIssachar;\nSolomon had forty thousand stalls of\nhorses for his chariots, and twelve\nthousand horsemen.\nShimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin;\nGeber the son of Uri, in the land of\nGilead, in the country of Sihon king of\nthe Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan.\nHe was the only governor who was in\nthe land.\nJudah and Israel were as numerous as\nthe sand by the sea in multitude, eating\nand drinking and rejoicing.\nSo Solomon reigned over all kingdoms\nfrom the River to the land of the\nPhilistines, as far as the border of Egypt.\nThey brought tribute and served\nSolomon all the days of his life.\nNow Solomon's provision for one day\nwas thirty kors of fine flour, sixty kors of\nmeal,\nten fatted oxen, twenty oxen from the\npastures, and one hundred sheep,\nbesides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and\nfatted fowl.\nFor he had dominion over all the\nregion on this side of the River from\nTiphsah even to Gaza, namely over all\nthe kings on this side of the River; and\nhe had peace on every side all around\nhim.\nAnd these governors, each man in his\nmonth, provided food for King Solomon\nand for all who came to King Solomon's\ntable. There was no lack in their supply.\nThey also brought barley and straw to\nthe proper place, for the horses and\nsteeds, each man according to his\ncharge.\nAnd God gave Solomon wisdom and\nexceedingly great understanding, and\nlargeness of heart like the sand on the\nseashore.\nThus Solomon's wisdom excelled the\nwisdom of all the men of the East and all\nthe wisdom of Egypt.\nFor he was wiser than all men--than\nEthan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Chalcol,\nand Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his\nfame was in all the surrounding nations.\nHe spoke three thousand proverbs,\nand his songs were one thousand and\nfive.\nAlso he spoke of trees, from the cedar\ntree of Lebanon even to the hyssop that\nsprings out of the wall; he spoke also of\nanimals, of birds, of creeping things, and\nof fish.\nAnd Judah and Israel dwelt safely,\neach man under his vine and his fig tree,\nfrom Dan as far as Beersheba, all the\ndays of Solomon.\nAnd men of all nations, from all the\nkings of the earth who had heard of his\nwisdom, came to hear the wisdom of\nSolomon.\n5Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his\nservants to Solomon, because he heard\nthat they had anointed him king in place\nof his father, for Hiram had always loved\nDavid.\nThen Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:\nYou know how my father David could\nnot build a house for the name of the\nLORD his God because of the wars\nwhich were fought against him on every\nside, until the LORD put his foes under\nthe soles of his feet.\nBut now the LORD my God has given\nme rest on every side; there is neither\nadversary nor evil occurrence.\nAnd behold, I propose to build a house\nfor the name of the LORD my God, as\nthe LORD spoke to my father David,\nsaying, \"Your son, whom I will set on\nyour throne in your place, he shall build\nthe house for My name.\"\nNow therefore, command that they cut\ndown cedars for me from Lebanon; and\nmy servants will be with your servants,\nand I will pay you wages for your\nservants according to whatever you say.\nFor you know there is none among us\nwho has skill to cut timber like the\nSidonians.\nSo it was, when Hiram heard the words\nof Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly and\nsaid, 4 Blessed be the LORD this day,\nfor He has given David a wise son over\nthis great people!\nThen Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: 4\nI have considered the message which\nyou sent me, and I will do all you desire\nconcerning the cedar and cypress logs.\nMy servants shall bring them down\nfrom Lebanon to the sea; I will float\nthem in rafts by sea to the place you\nindicate to me, and will have them\nbroken apart there; then you can take\nthem away. And you shall fulfill my\ndesire by giving food for my household.\nThen Hiram gave Solomon cedar and\ncypress logs according to all his desire.\nAnd Solomon gave Hiram twenty\nthousand kors of wheat as food for his\nhousehold, and twenty kors of pressed\noil. Thus Solomon gave to Hiram year\nby year.\nSo the LORD gave Solomon wisdom,\nas He had promised him; and there was\npeace between Hiram and Solomon,\nand the two of them made a treaty\ntogether.\nThen King Solomon raised up a labor\nforce out of all Israel; and the labor force\nwas thirty thousand men.\nAnd he sent them to Lebanon, ten\nthousand a month in shifts: they were\none month in Lebanon and two months\nat home; Adoniram was in charge of the\nlabor force.\nSolomon had seventy thousand who\ncarried burdens, and eighty thousand\nwho quarried stone in the mountains,\nbesides three thousand three hundred\nfrom the chiefs of Solomon's deputies,\nwho supervised the people who labored\nin the work.\nAnd the king commanded them to\nquarry large stones, costly stones, and\nhewn stones, to lay the foundation of the\ntemple.\nand the inner sanctuary. Thus he made\nside chambers all around it.\nThe lowest chamber was five cubits\nwide, the middle was six cubits wide,\nand the third was seven cubits wide; for\nhe made narrow ledges around the\noutside of the temple, so that the\nsupport beams would not be fastened\ninto the walls of the temple.\nSo Solomon's builders, Hiram's\nbuilders, and the Gebalites quarried\nthem; and they prepared timber and\nstones to build the temple.\n6And it came to pass in the four\nhundred and eightieth year after the\nchildren of Israel had come out of the\nland of Egypt, in the fourth year of\nSolomon's reign over Israel, in the\nmonth of Ziv, which is the second month,\nthat he began to build the house of the\nLORD.\nAnd the temple, when it was being built,\nwas built with stone finished at the\nquarry, so that no hammer or chisel or\nany iron tool was heard in the temple\nwhile it was being built.\nThe doorway for the middle story was\non the right side of the temple. They\nwent up by stairs to the middle story,\nand from the middle to the third.\nSo he built the temple and finished it,\nand he paneled the temple with beams\nand boards of cedar.\nNow the house which King Solomon\nbuilt for the LORD, its length was sixty\ncubits, its width twenty, and its height\nthirty cubits.\nAnd he built side chambers against the\nentire temple, each five cubits high; they\nwere attached to the temple with cedar\nbeams.\nThe vestibule in front of the sanctuary\nof the house was twenty cubits long\nacross the width of the house, and the\nwidth of the vestibule extended ten\ncubits from the front of the house.\nAnd he made for the house windows\nwith beveled frames.\nAgainst the wall of the temple he built\nchambers all around, against the walls\nof the temple, all around the sanctuary\nThen the word of the LORD came to\nSolomon, saying:\n\"Concerning this temple which you are\nbuilding, if you walk in My statutes,\nexecute My judgments, keep all My\ncommandments, and walk in them, then\nI will perform My word with you, which I\nspoke to your father David.\nAnd I will dwell among the children of\nIsrael, and will not forsake My people\nIsrael.\"\nThe whole temple he overlaid with\ngold, until he had finished all the temple;\nalso he overlaid with gold the entire altar\nthat was by the inner sanctuary.\nSo Solomon built the temple and\nfinished it.\nAnd he built the inside walls of the\ntemple with cedar boards; from the floor\nof the temple to the ceiling he paneled\nthe inside with wood; and he covered\nthe floor of the temple with planks of\ncypress.\nThen he built the twenty-cubit room at\nthe rear of the temple, from floor to\nceiling, with cedar boards; he built it\ninside as the inner sanctuary, as the\nMost Holy Place.\nAnd in front of it the temple sanctuary\nwas forty cubits long.\nThe inside of the temple was cedar,\ncarved with ornamental buds and open\nflowers. All was cedar; there was no\nstone to be seen.\nInside the inner sanctuary he made\ntwo cherubim of olive wood, each ten\ncubits high.\nOne wing of the cherub was five cubits,\nand the other wing of the cherub five\ncubits: ten cubits from the tip of one\nwing to the tip of the other.\nAnd the other cherub was ten cubits;\nboth cherubim were of the same size\nand shape.\nThe height of one cherub was ten\ncubits, and so was the other cherub.\nThen he set the cherubim inside the\ninner room; and they stretched out the\nwings of the cherubim so that the wing\nof the one touched one wall, and the\nwing of the other cherub touched the\nother wall. And their wings touched each\nother in the middle of the room.\nAnd he prepared the inner sanctuary\ninside the temple, to set the ark of the\ncovenant of the LORD there.\nAlso he overlaid the cherubim with\ngold.\nThe inner sanctuary was twenty cubits\nlong, twenty cubits wide, and twenty\ncubits high. He overlaid it with pure gold,\nand overlaid the altar of cedar.\nThen he carved all the walls of the\ntemple all around, both the inner and\nouter sanctuaries, with carved figures of\ncherubim, palm trees, and open flowers.\nSo Solomon overlaid the inside of the\ntemple with pure gold. He stretched gold\nchains across the front of the inner\nsanctuary, and overlaid it with gold.\nAnd the floor of the temple he overlaid\nwith gold, both the inner and outer\nsanctuaries.\nFor the entrance of the inner sanctuary\nhe made doors of olive wood; the lintel\nand doorposts were one-fifth of the wall.\nThe two doors were of olive wood; and\nhe carved on them figures of cherubim,\npalm trees, and open flowers, and\noverlaid them with gold; and he spread\ngold on the cherubim and on the palm\ntrees.\nHe also built the House of the Forest of\nLebanon; its length was one hundred\ncubits, its width fifty cubits, and its\nheight thirty cubits, with four rows of\ncedar pillars, and cedar beams on the\npillars.\nAnd it was paneled with cedar above\nthe beams that were on forty-five pillars,\nfifteen to a row.\nSo for the door of the sanctuary he\nalso made doorposts of olive wood, onefourth of the wall.\nThere were windows with beveled\nframes in three rows, and window was\nopposite window in three tiers.\nAnd the two doors were of cypress\nwood; two panels comprised one folding\ndoor, and two panels comprised the\nother folding door.\nAnd all the doorways and doorposts\nhad rectangular frames; and window\nwas opposite window in three tiers.\nThen he carved cherubim, palm trees,\nand open flowers on them, and overlaid\nthem with gold applied evenly on the\ncarved work.\nHe also made the Hall of Pillars: its\nlength was fifty cubits, and its width\nthirty cubits; and in front of them was a\nportico with pillars, and a canopy was in\nfront of them.\nAnd he built the inner court with three\nrows of hewn stone and a row of cedar\nbeams.\nThen he made a hall for the throne, the\nHall of Judgment, where he might judge;\nand it was paneled with cedar from floor\nto ceiling.\nIn the fourth year the foundation of the\nhouse of the LORD was laid, in the\nmonth of Ziv.\nAnd in the eleventh year, in the month\nof Bul, which is the eighth month, the\nhouse was finished in all its details and\naccording to all its plans. So he was\nseven years in building it.\n7But Solomon took thirteen years to\nbuild his own house; so he finished all\nhis house.\nAnd the house where he dwelt had\nanother court inside the hall, of like\nworkmanship. Solomon also made a\nhouse like this hall for Pharaoh's\ndaughter, whom he had taken as wife.\nAll these were of costly stones cut to\nsize, trimmed with saws, inside and out,\nfrom the foundation to the eaves, and\nalso on the outside to the great court.\nThe foundation was of costly stones,\nlarge stones, some ten cubits and some\neight cubits.\naround to cover the capitals that were\non top; and thus he did for the other\ncapital.\nAnd above were costly stones, hewn\nto size, and cedar wood.\nThe capitals which were on top of the\npillars in the hall were in the shape of\nlilies, four cubits.\nThe great court was enclosed with\nthree rows of hewn stones and a row of\ncedar beams. So were the inner court of\nthe house of the LORD and the\nvestibule of the temple.\nNow King Solomon sent and brought\nHuram from Tyre.\nHe was the son of a widow from the\ntribe of Naphtali, and his father was a\nman of Tyre, a bronze worker; he was\nfilled with wisdom and understanding\nand skill in working with all kinds of\nbronze work. So he came to King\nSolomon and did all his work.\nThe capitals on the two pillars also had\npomegranates above, by the convex\nsurface which was next to the network;\nand there were two hundred such\npomegranates in rows on each of the\ncapitals all around.\nThen he set up the pillars by the\nvestibule of the temple; he set up the\npillar on the right and called its name\nJachin, and he set up the pillar on the\nleft and called its name Boaz.\nThe tops of the pillars were in the\nshape of lilies. So the work of the pillars\nwas finished.\nAnd he cast two pillars of bronze, each\none eighteen cubits high, and a line of\ntwelve\ncubits\nmeasured\nthe\ncircumference of each.\nThen he made two capitals of cast\nbronze, to set on the tops of the pillars.\nThe height of one capital was five cubits,\nand the height of the other capital was\nfive cubits.\nHe made a lattice network, with\nwreaths of chainwork, for the capitals\nwhich were on top of the pillars: seven\nchains for one capital and seven for the\nother capital.\nSo he made the pillars, and two rows\nof pomegranates above the network all\nAnd he made the Sea of cast bronze,\nten cubits from one brim to the other; it\nwas completely round. Its height was\nfive cubits, and a line of thirty cubits\nmeasured its circumference.\nBelow its brim were ornamental buds\nencircling it all around, ten to a cubit, all\nthe way around the Sea. The\nornamental buds were cast in two rows\nwhen it was cast.\nIt stood on twelve oxen: three looking\ntoward the north, three looking toward\nthe west, three looking toward the south,\nand three looking toward the east; the\nSea was set upon them, and all their\nback parts pointed inward.\nIt was a handbreadth thick; and its\nbrim was shaped like the brim of a cup,\nlike a lily blossom. It contained two\nthousand baths.\nAnd there were four supports at the\nfour corners of each cart; its supports\nwere part of the cart itself.\nHe also made ten carts of bronze; four\ncubits was the length of each cart, four\ncubits its width, and three cubits its\nheight.\nOn the top of the cart, at the height of\nhalf a cubit, it was perfectly round. And\non the top of the cart, its flanges and its\npanels were of the same casting.\nAnd this was the design of the carts:\nThey had panels, and the panels were\nbetween frames;\nOn the plates of its flanges and on its\npanels he engraved cherubim, lions,\nand palm trees, wherever there was a\nclear space on each, with wreaths all\naround.\non the panels that were between the\nframes were lions, oxen, and cherubim.\nAnd on the frames was a pedestal on\ntop. Below the lions and oxen were\nwreaths of plaited work.\nThus he made the ten carts. All of\nthem were of the same mold, one\nmeasure, and one shape.\nEvery cart had four bronze wheels and\naxles of bronze, and its four feet had\nsupports. Under the laver were supports\nof cast bronze beside each wreath.\nThen he made ten lavers of bronze;\neach laver contained forty baths, and\neach laver was four cubits. On each of\nthe ten carts was a laver.\nIts opening inside the crown at the top\nwas one cubit in diameter; and the\nopening was round, shaped like a\npedestal, one and a half cubits in\noutside diameter; and also on the\nopening were engravings, but the\npanels were square, not round.\nUnder the panels were the four wheels,\nand the axles of the wheels were joined\nto the cart. The height of a wheel was\none and a half cubits.\nThe workmanship of the wheels was\nlike the workmanship of a chariot wheel;\ntheir axle pins, their rims, their spokes,\nand their hubs were all of cast bronze.\nAnd he put five carts on the right side\nof the house, and five on the left side of\nthe house. He set the Sea on the right\nside of the house, toward the southeast.\nHuram made the lavers and the\nshovels and the bowls. So Huram\nfinished doing all the work that he was\nto do for King Solomon for the house of\nthe LORD:\nthe two pillars, the two bowl-shaped\ncapitals that were on top of the two\npillars; the two networks covering the\ntwo bowl-shaped capitals which were on\ntop of the pillars;\nfour hundred pomegranates for the\ntwo\nnetworks\n(two\nrows\nof\npomegranates for each network, to\ncover the two bowl-shaped capitals that\nwere on top of the pillars);\nthe ten carts, and ten lavers on the\ncarts;\nSo all the work that King Solomon had\ndone for the house of the LORD was\nfinished; and Solomon brought in the\nthings which his father David had\ndedicated: the silver and the gold and\nthe furnishings. He put them in the\ntreasuries of the house of the LORD.\none Sea, and twelve oxen under the\nSea;\nthe pots, the shovels, and the bowls.\nAll these articles which Huram made for\nKing Solomon for the house of the\nLORD were of burnished bronze.\nIn the plain of Jordan the king had\nthem cast in clay molds, between\nSuccoth and Zaretan.\nAnd Solomon did not weigh all the\narticles, because there were so many;\nthe weight of the bronze was not\ndetermined.\n8Now Solomon assembled the elders\nof Israel and all the heads of the tribes,\nthe chief fathers of the children of Israel,\nto King Solomon in Jerusalem, that they\nmight bring up the ark of the covenant of\nthe LORD from the City of David, which\nis Zion.\nTherefore all the men of Israel\nassembled with King Solomon at the\nfeast in the month of Ethanim, which is\nthe seventh month.\nSo all the elders of Israel came, and the\npriests took up the ark.\nThus Solomon had all the furnishings\nmade for the house of the LORD: the\naltar of gold, and the table of gold on\nwhich was the showbread;\nthe lampstands of pure gold, five on\nthe right side and five on the left in front\nof the inner sanctuary, with the flowers\nand the lamps and the wick-trimmers of\ngold;\nthe basins, the trimmers, the bowls,\nthe ladles, and the censers of pure gold;\nand the hinges of gold, both for the\ndoors of the inner room (the Most Holy\nPlace) and for the doors of the main hall\nof the temple.\nThen they brought up the ark of the\nLORD, the tabernacle of meeting, and\nall the holy furnishings that were in the\ntabernacle. The priests and the Levites\nbrought them up.\nAlso King Solomon, and all the\ncongregation of Israel who were\nassembled with him, were with him\nbefore the ark, sacrificing sheep and\noxen that could not be counted or\nnumbered for multitude.\nThen the priests brought in the ark of\nthe covenant of the LORD to its place,\ninto the inner sanctuary of the temple, to\nthe Most Holy Place, under the wings of\nthe cherubim.\nFor the cherubim spread their two\nwings over the place of the ark, and the\ncherubim overshadowed the ark and its\npoles.\nThe poles extended so that the ends of\nthe poles could be seen from the holy\nplace, in front of the inner sanctuary; but\nthey could not be seen from outside.\nAnd they are there to this day.\nNothing was in the ark except the two\ntablets of stone which Moses put there\nat Horeb, when the LORD made a\ncovenant with the children of Israel,\nwhen they came out of the land of Egypt.\n\"Since the day that I brought My\npeople Israel out of Egypt, I have\nchosen no city from any tribe of Israel in\nwhich to build a house, that My name\nmight be there; but I chose David to be\nover My people Israel.'\nNow it was in the heart of my father\nDavid to build a temple for the name of\nthe LORD God of Israel.\nBut the LORD said to my father David,\n\"Whereas it was in your heart to build a\ntemple for My name, you did well that it\nwas in your heart.\nAnd it came to pass, when the priests\ncame out of the holy place, that the\ncloud filled the house of the LORD,\nNevertheless you shall not build the\ntemple, but your son who will come from\nyour body, he shall build the temple for\nMy name.'\nso that the priests could not continue\nministering because of the cloud; for the\nglory of the LORD filled the house of the\nLORD.\nThen Solomon spoke: \"The LORD said\nHe would dwell in the dark cloud.\nI have surely built You an exalted\nhouse, And a place for You to dwell in\nforever.\"\nSo the LORD has fulfilled His word\nwhich He spoke; and I have filled the\nposition of my father David, and sit on\nthe throne of Israel, as the LORD\npromised; and I have built a temple for\nthe name of the LORD God of Israel.\nAnd there I have made a place for the\nark, in which is the covenant of the\nLORD which He made with our fathers,\nwhen He brought them out of the land of\nEgypt.\"\nThen the king turned around and\nblessed the whole assembly of Israel,\nwhile all the assembly of Israel was\nstanding.\nThen Solomon stood before the altar\nof the LORD in the presence of all the\nassembly of Israel, and spread out his\nhands toward heaven;\nAnd he said: \"Blessed be the LORD\nGod of Israel, who spoke with His mouth\nto my father David, and with His hand\nhas fulfilled it, saying,\nand he said: \"LORD God of Israel,\nthere is no God in heaven above or on\nearth below like You, who keep Your\ncovenant and mercy with Your servants\nwho walk before You with all their hearts.\nYou have kept what You promised\nYour servant David my father; You have\nboth spoken with Your mouth and\nfulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day.\nTherefore, LORD God of Israel, now\nkeep what You promised Your servant\nDavid my father, saying, \"You shall not\nfail to have a man sit before Me on the\nthrone of Israel, only if your sons take\nheed to their way, that they walk before\nMe as you have walked before Me.'\nAnd now I pray, O God of Israel, let\nYour word come true, which You have\nspoken to Your servant David my father.\n\"But will God indeed dwell on the\nearth? Behold, heaven and the heaven\nof heavens cannot contain You. How\nmuch less this temple which I have built!\nYet regard the prayer of Your servant\nand his supplication, O LORD my God,\nand listen to the cry and the prayer\nwhich Your servant is praying before\nYou today:\nthat Your eyes may be open toward\nthis temple night and day, toward the\nplace of which You said, \"My name shall\nbe there,' that You may hear the prayer\nwhich Your servant makes toward this\nplace.\nAnd may You hear the supplication of\nYour servant and of Your people Israel,\nwhen they pray toward this place.

So the king and all the children\nof Israel dedicated the house of the\nLORD.\nOn the same day the king consecrated\nthe middle of the court that was in front\nof the house of the LORD; for there he\noffered burnt offerings, grain offerings,\nand the fat of the peace offerings,\nbecause the bronze altar that was\nbefore the LORD was too small to\nreceive the burnt offerings, the grain\nofferings, and the fat of the peace\nofferings.\nAt that time Solomon held a feast, and\nall Israel with him, a great assembly\nfrom the entrance of Hamath to the\nBrook of Egypt, before the LORD our\nGod, seven days and seven more days-fourteen days.\nOn the eighth day he sent the people\naway; and they blessed the king, and\nwent to their tents joyful and glad of\nheart for all the good that the LORD had\ndone for His servant David, and for\nIsrael His people.\nwhich I have consecrated for My name I\nwill cast out of My sight. Israel will be a\nproverb and a byword among all\npeoples.\n9And it came to pass, when Solomon\nhad finished building the house of the\nLORD and the king's house, and all\nSolomon's desire which he wanted to do,\nthat the LORD appeared to Solomon\nthe second time, as He had appeared to\nhim at Gibeon.\nAnd the LORD said to him: \"I have\nheard your prayer and your supplication\nthat you have made before Me; I have\nconsecrated this house which you have\nbuilt to put My name there forever, and\nMy eyes and My heart will be there\nperpetually.\nNow if you walk before Me as your\nfather David walked, in integrity of heart\nand in uprightness, to do according to all\nthat I have commanded you, and if you\nkeep My statutes and My judgments,\nthen I will establish the throne of your\nkingdom over Israel forever, as I\npromised David your father, saying,\n\"You shall not fail to have a man on the\nthrone of Israel.'\nBut if you or your sons at all turn from\nfollowing Me, and do not keep My\ncommandments and My statutes which I\nhave set before you, but go and serve\nother gods and worship them,\nthen I will cut off Israel from the land\nwhich I have given them; and this house\nAnd as for this house, which is exalted,\neveryone who passes by it will be\nastonished and will hiss, and say, \"Why\nhas the LORD done thus to this land\nand to this house?'\nThen they will answer, \"Because they\nforsook the LORD their God, who\nbrought their fathers out of the land of\nEgypt, and have embraced other gods,\nand worshiped them and served them;\ntherefore the LORD has brought all this\ncalamity on them.\"'\nNow it happened at the end of twenty\nyears, when Solomon had built the two\nhouses, the house of the LORD and the\nking's house\n(Hiram the king of Tyre had supplied\nSolomon with cedar and cypress and\ngold, as much as he desired), that King\nSolomon then gave Hiram twenty cities\nin the land of Galilee.\nThen Hiram went from Tyre to see the\ncities which Solomon had given him, but\nthey did not please him.\nSo he said, \"What kind of cities are\nthese which you have given me, my\nbrother?\" And he called them the land of\nCabul, as they are to this day.\nThen Hiram sent the king one hundred\nand twenty talents of gold.\nAnd this is the reason for the labor\nforce which King Solomon raised: to\nbuild the house of the LORD, his own\nhouse, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem,\nHazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.\n(Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up\nand taken Gezer and burned it with fire,\nhad killed the Canaanites who dwelt in\nthe city, and had given it as a dowry to\nhis daughter, Solomon's wife.)\nand fifty, who ruled over the people who\ndid the work.\nBut Pharaoh's daughter came up from\nthe City of David to her house which\nSolomon had built for her. Then he built\nthe Millo.\nAnd Solomon built Gezer, Lower Beth\nHoron,\nNow three times a year Solomon\noffered burnt offerings and peace\nofferings on the altar which he had built\nfor the LORD, and he burned incense\nwith them on the altar that was before\nthe LORD. So he finished the temple.\nBaalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness,\nin the land of Judah,\nall the storage cities that Solomon had,\ncities for his chariots and cities for his\ncavalry, and whatever Solomon desired\nto build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in\nall the land of his dominion.\nKing Solomon also built a fleet of ships\nat Ezion Geber, which is near Elath on\nthe shore of the Red Sea, in the land of\nEdom.\nThen Hiram sent his servants with the\nfleet, seamen who knew the sea, to\nwork with the servants of Solomon.\nAll the people who were left of the\nAmorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites,\nand Jebusites, who were not of the\nchildren of Israel--\nAnd they went to Ophir, and acquired\nfour hundred and twenty talents of gold\nfrom there, and brought it to King\nSolomon.\n10Now when the queen of Sheba\nthat is, their descendants who were\nleft in the land after them, whom the\nchildren of Israel had not been able to\ndestroy completely--from these Solomon\nraised forced labor, as it is to this day.\nBut of the children of Israel Solomon\nmade no forced laborers, because they\nwere men of war and his servants: his\nofficers, his captains, commanders of\nhis chariots, and his cavalry.\nOthers were chiefs of the officials who\nwere over Solomon's work: five hundred\nheard of the fame of Solomon\nconcerning the name of the LORD, she\ncame to test him with hard questions.\nShe came to Jerusalem with a very\ngreat retinue, with camels that bore\nspices, very much gold, and precious\nstones; and when she came to Solomon,\nshe spoke with him about all that was in\nher heart.\nSo Solomon answered all her\nquestions; there was nothing so difficult\nfor the king that he could not explain it to\nher.\nAnd when the queen of Sheba had\nseen all the wisdom of Solomon, the\nhouse that he had built,\nabundance of spices as the queen of\nSheba gave to King Solomon.\nAlso, the ships of Hiram, which\nbrought gold from Ophir, brought great\nquantities of almug wood and precious\nstones from Ophir.\nthe food on his table, the seating of his\nservants, the service of his waiters and\ntheir apparel, his cupbearers, and his\nentryway by which he went up to the\nhouse of the LORD, there was no more\nspirit in her.\nAnd the king made steps of the almug\nwood for the house of the LORD and for\nthe king's house, also harps and\nstringed instruments for singers. There\nnever again came such almug wood,\nnor has the like been seen to this day.\nThen she said to the king: \"It was a true\nreport which I heard in my own land\nabout your words and your wisdom.\nHowever I did not believe the words\nuntil I came and saw with my own eyes;\nand indeed the half was not told me.\nYour wisdom and prosperity exceed the\nfame of which I heard.\nNow King Solomon gave the queen of\nSheba all she desired, whatever she\nasked, besides what Solomon had given\nher according to the royal generosity. So\nshe turned and went to her own country,\nshe and her servants.\nThe weight of gold that came to\nSolomon yearly was six hundred and\nsixty-six talents of gold,\nHappy are your men and happy are\nthese your servants, who stand\ncontinually before you and hear your\nwisdom!\nbesides that from the traveling\nmerchants, from the income of traders,\nfrom all the kings of Arabia, and from\nthe governors of the country.\nBlessed be the LORD your God, who\ndelighted in you, setting you on the\nthrone of Israel! Because the LORD has\nloved Israel forever, therefore He made\nyou\nking,\nto\ndo\njustice\nand\nrighteousness.\"\nThen she gave the king one hundred\nand twenty talents of gold, spices in\ngreat quantity, and precious stones.\nThere never again came such\nAnd King Solomon made two hundred\nlarge shields of hammered gold; six\nhundred shekels of gold went into each\nshield.\nHe also made three hundred shields of\nhammered gold; three minas of gold\nwent into each shield. The king put them\nin the House of the Forest of Lebanon.\nMoreover the king made a great\nthrone of ivory, and overlaid it with pure\ngold.\nchariot cities and with the king at\nJerusalem.\nThe throne had six steps, and the top\nof the throne was round at the back;\nthere were armrests on either side of the\nplace of the seat, and two lions stood\nbeside the armrests.\nTwelve lions stood there, one on each\nside of the six steps; nothing like this\nhad been made for any other kingdom.\nThe king made silver as common in\nJerusalem as stones, and he made\ncedar trees as abundant as the\nsycamores which are in the lowland.\nAlso Solomon had horses imported\nfrom Egypt and Keveh; the king's\nmerchants bought them in Keveh at the\ncurrent price.\nAll King Solomon's drinking vessels\nwere gold, and all the vessels of the\nHouse of the Forest of Lebanon were\npure gold. Not one was silver, for this\nwas accounted as nothing in the days of\nSolomon.\nFor the king had merchant ships at\nsea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every\nthree years the merchant ships came\nbringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and\nmonkeys.\nSo King Solomon surpassed all the\nkings of the earth in riches and wisdom.\nNow a chariot that was imported from\nEgypt cost six hundred shekels of silver,\nand a horse one hundred and fifty; and\nthus, through their agents, they exported\nthem to all the kings of the Hittites and\nthe kings of Syria.\n11But King Solomon loved many\nforeign women, as well as the daughter\nof Pharaoh: women of the Moabites,\nAmmonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and\nHittites-2\nNow all the earth sought the presence\nof Solomon to hear his wisdom, which\nGod had put in his heart.\nfrom the nations of whom the LORD\nhad said to the children of Israel, \"You\nshall not intermarry with them, nor they\nwith you. Surely they will turn away your\nhearts after their gods.\" Solomon clung\nto these in love.\nEach man brought his present: articles\nof silver and gold, garments, armor,\nspices, horses, and mules, at a set rate\nyear by year.\nAnd he had seven hundred wives,\nprincesses,\nand\nthree\nhundred\nconcubines; and his wives turned away\nhis heart.\nAnd Solomon gathered chariots and\nhorsemen; he had one thousand four\nhundred chariots and twelve thousand\nhorsemen, whom he stationed in the\nFor it was so, when Solomon was old,\nthat his wives turned his heart after\nother gods; and his heart was not loyal\nto the LORD his God, as was the heart\nof his father David.\nFor Solomon went after Ashtoreth the\ngoddess of the Sidonians, and after\nMilcom the abomination of the\nAmmonites.\nSolomon did evil in the sight of the\nLORD, and did not fully follow the LORD,\nas did his father David.\nThen Solomon built a high place for\nChemosh the abomination of Moab, on\nthe hill that is east of Jerusalem, and for\nMolech the abomination of the people of\nAmmon.\nAnd he did likewise for all his foreign\nwives, who burned incense and\nsacrificed to their gods.\nSo the LORD became angry with\nSolomon, because his heart had turned\nfrom the LORD God of Israel, who had\nappeared to him twice,\nand had commanded him concerning\nthis thing, that he should not go after\nother gods; but he did not keep what the\nLORD had commanded.\nTherefore the LORD said to Solomon,\n\"Because you have done this, and have\nnot kept My covenant and My statutes,\nwhich I have commanded you, I will\nsurely tear the kingdom away from you\nand give it to your servant.\nNevertheless I will not do it in your\ndays, for the sake of your father David; I\nwill tear it out of the hand of your son.\nHowever I will not tear away the whole\nkingdom; I will give one tribe to your son\nfor the sake of My servant David, and\nfor the sake of Jerusalem which I have\nchosen.\"\nNow the LORD raised up an adversary\nagainst Solomon, Hadad the Edomite;\nhe was a descendant of the king in\nEdom.\nFor it happened, when David was in\nEdom, and Joab the commander of the\narmy had gone up to bury the slain, after\nhe had killed every male in Edom\n(because for six months Joab\nremained there with all Israel, until he\nhad cut down every male in Edom),\nthat Hadad fled to go to Egypt, he and\ncertain Edomites of his father's servants\nwith him. Hadad was still a little child.\nThen they arose from Midian and\ncame to Paran; and they took men with\nthem from Paran and came to Egypt, to\nPharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a\nhouse, apportioned food for him, and\ngave him land.\nAnd Hadad found great favor in the\nsight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as\nwife the sister of his own wife, that is,\nthe sister of Queen Tahpenes.\nThen the sister of Tahpenes bore him\nGenubath his son, whom Tahpenes\nweaned in Pharaoh's house. And\nGenubath was in Pharaoh's household\namong the sons of Pharaoh.\nSo when Hadad heard in Egypt that\nDavid rested with his fathers, and that\nJoab the commander of the army was\ndead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, \"Let me\ndepart, that I may go to my own\ncountry.\"\nThen Pharaoh said to him, \"But what\nhave you lacked with me, that suddenly\nyou seek to go to your own country?\" So\nhe answered, \"Nothing, but do let me go\nanyway.\"\nAnd God raised up another adversary\nagainst him, Rezon the son of Eliadah,\nwho had fled from his lord, Hadadezer\nking of Zobah.\nSo he gathered men to him and\nbecame captain over a band of raiders,\nwhen David killed those of Zobah. And\nthey went to Damascus and dwelt there,\nand reigned in Damascus.\nHe was an adversary of Israel all the\ndays of Solomon (besides the trouble\nthat Hadad caused); and he abhorred\nIsrael, and reigned over Syria.\nThen Solomon's servant, Jeroboam\nthe son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from\nZereda, whose mother's name was\nZeruah, a widow, also rebelled against\nthe king.\nthe officer over all the labor force of the\nhouse of Joseph.\nNow it happened at that time, when\nJeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that\nthe prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him\non the way; and he had clothed himself\nwith a new garment, and the two were\nalone in the field.\nThen Ahijah took hold of the new\ngarment that was on him, and tore it into\ntwelve pieces.\nAnd he said to Jeroboam, \"Take for\nyourself ten pieces, for thus says the\nLORD, the God of Israel: \"Behold, I will\ntear the kingdom out of the hand of\nSolomon and will give ten tribes to you\n(but he shall have one tribe for the\nsake of My servant David, and for the\nsake of Jerusalem, the city which I have\nchosen out of all the tribes of Israel),\nbecause they have forsaken Me, and\nworshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the\nSidonians, Chemosh the god of the\nMoabites, and Milcom the god of the\npeople of Ammon, and have not walked\nin My ways to do what is right in My\neyes and keep My statutes and My\njudgments, as did his father David.\nAnd this is what caused him to rebel\nagainst the king: Solomon had built the\nMillo and repaired the damages to the\nCity of David his father.\nHowever I will not take the whole\nkingdom out of his hand, because I have\nmade him ruler all the days of his life for\nthe sake of My servant David, whom I\nchose\nbecause\nhe\nkept\nMy\ncommandments and My statutes.\nThe man Jeroboam was a mighty man\nof valor; and Solomon, seeing that the\nyoung man was industrious, made him\nBut I will take the kingdom out of his\nson's hand and give it to you--ten tribes.\nAnd to his son I will give one tribe, that\nMy servant David may always have a\nlamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city\nwhich I have chosen for Myself, to put\nMy name there.\nSo I will take you, and you shall reign\nover all your heart desires, and you shall\nbe king over Israel.\nThen it shall be, if you heed all that I\ncommand you, walk in My ways, and do\nwhat is right in My sight, to keep My\nstatutes and My commandments, as My\nservant David did, then I will be with you\nand build for you an enduring house, as\nI built for David, and will give Israel to\nyou.\nAnd I will afflict the descendants of\nDavid because of this, but not forever.\"'\nSolomon therefore sought to kill\nJeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled\nto Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and\nwas in Egypt until the death of Solomon.\nNow the rest of the acts of Solomon,\nall that he did, and his wisdom, are they\nnot written in the book of the acts of\nSolomon?\nAnd the period that Solomon reigned\nin Jerusalem over all Israel was forty\nyears.\nThen Solomon rested with his fathers,\nand was buried in the City of David his\nfather. And Rehoboam his son reigned\nin his place.\n12And Rehoboam went to Shechem,\nfor all Israel had gone to Shechem to\nmake him king.\nSo it happened, when Jeroboam the\nson of Nebat heard it (he was still in\nEgypt, for he had fled from the presence\nof King Solomon and had been dwelling\nin Egypt),\nthat they sent and called him. Then\nJeroboam and the whole assembly of\nIsrael came and spoke to Rehoboam,\nsaying,\n\"Your father made our yoke heavy; now\ntherefore, lighten the burdensome\nservice of your father, and his heavy\nyoke which he put on us, and we will\nserve you.\"\nSo he said to them, \"Depart for three\ndays, then come back to me.\" And the\npeople departed.\nThen King Rehoboam consulted the\nelders who stood before his father\nSolomon while he still lived, and he said,\n\"How do you advise me to answer these\npeople?\"\nAnd they spoke to him, saying, \"If you\nwill be a servant to these people today,\nand serve them, and answer them, and\nspeak good words to them, then they\nwill be your servants forever.\"\nBut he rejected the advice which the\nelders had given him, and consulted the\nyoung men who had grown up with him,\nwho stood before him.\nAnd he said to them, \"What advice do\nyou give? How should we answer this\npeople who have spoken to me, saying,\n\"Lighten the yoke which your father put\non us'?\"\nThen the young men who had grown\nup with him spoke to him, saying, \"Thus\nyou should speak to this people who\nhave spoken to you, saying, \"Your father\nmade our yoke heavy, but you make it\nlighter on us'--thus you shall say to\nthem: \"My little finger shall be thicker\nthan my father's waist!\nAnd now, whereas my father put a\nheavy yoke on you, I will add to your\nyoke; my father chastised you with\nwhips, but I will chastise you with\nscourges!\"'\nNow when all Israel saw that the king\ndid not listen to them, the people\nanswered the king, saying: \"What share\nhave we in David? We have no\ninheritance in the son of Jesse. To your\ntents, O Israel! Now, see to your own\nhouse, O David!\" So Israel departed to\ntheir tents.\nBut Rehoboam reigned over the\nchildren of Israel who dwelt in the cities\nof Judah.\nThen King Rehoboam sent Adoram,\nwho was in charge of the revenue; but\nall Israel stoned him with stones, and he\ndied.\nTherefore\nKing\nRehoboam\nmounted his chariot in haste to flee to\nJerusalem.\nSo Jeroboam and all the people came\nto Rehoboam the third day, as the king\nhad directed, saying, \"Come back to me\nthe third day.\"\nThen the king answered the people\nroughly, and rejected the advice which\nthe elders had given him;\nSo Israel has been in rebellion against\nthe house of David to this day.\nNow it came to pass when all Israel\nheard that Jeroboam had come back,\nthey sent for him and called him to the\ncongregation, and made him king over\nall Israel. There was none who followed\nthe house of David, but the tribe of\nJudah only.\nand he spoke to them according to the\nadvice of the young men, saying, \"My\nfather made your yoke heavy, but I will\nadd to your yoke; my father chastised\nyou with whips, but I will chastise you\nwith scourges!\"\nSo the king did not listen to the people;\nfor the turn of events was from the\nLORD, that He might fulfill His word,\nwhich the LORD had spoken by Ahijah\nthe Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of\nNebat.\nAnd when Rehoboam came to\nJerusalem, he assembled all the house\nof Judah with the tribe of Benjamin, one\nhundred and eighty thousand chosen\nmen who were warriors, to fight against\nthe house of Israel, that he might restore\nthe kingdom to Rehoboam the son of\nSolomon.\nBut the word of God came\nShemaiah the man of God, saying,\nto\n\"Speak to Rehoboam the son of\nSolomon, king of Judah, to all the house\nof Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest\nof the people, saying,\nHe made shrines on the high places,\nand made priests from every class of\npeople, who were not of the sons of Levi.\n\"Thus says the LORD: \"You shall not\ngo up nor fight against your brethren the\nchildren of Israel. Let every man return\nto his house, for this thing is from Me.\"\"'\nTherefore they obeyed the word of the\nLORD, and turned back, according to\nthe word of the LORD.\nJeroboam ordained a feast on the\nfifteenth day of the eighth month, like\nthe feast that was in Judah, and offered\nsacrifices on the altar. So he did at\nBethel, sacrificing to the calves that he\nhad made. And at Bethel he installed\nthe priests of the high places which he\nhad made.\nThen Jeroboam built Shechem in the\nmountains of Ephraim, and dwelt there.\nAlso he went out from there and built\nPenuel.\nAnd Jeroboam said in his heart, \"Now\nthe kingdom may return to the house of\nDavid:\nIf these people go up to offer sacrifices\nin the house of the LORD at Jerusalem,\nthen the heart of this people will turn\nback to their lord, Rehoboam king of\nJudah, and they will kill me and go back\nto Rehoboam king of Judah.\"\nSo he made offerings on the altar\nwhich he had made at Bethel on the\nfifteenth day of the eighth month, in the\nmonth which he had devised in his own\nheart. And he ordained a feast for the\nchildren of Israel, and offered sacrifices\non the altar and burned incense.\n13And behold, a man of God went\nfrom Judah to Bethel by the word of the\nLORD, and Jeroboam stood by the altar\nto burn incense.\nTherefore the king asked advice,\nmade two calves of gold, and said to the\npeople, \"It is too much for you to go up\nto Jerusalem. Here are your gods, O\nIsrael, which brought you up from the\nland of Egypt!\"\nThen he cried out against the altar by\nthe word of the LORD, and said, \"O altar,\naltar! Thus says the LORD: \"Behold, a\nchild, Josiah by name, shall be born to\nthe house of David; and on you he shall\nsacrifice the priests of the high places\nwho burn incense on you, and men's\nbones shall be burned on you.\"'\nAnd he set up one in Bethel, and the\nother he put in Dan.\nNow this thing became a sin, for the\npeople went to worship before the one\nas far as Dan.\nAnd he gave a sign the same day,\nsaying, \"This is the sign which the\nLORD has spoken: Surely the altar shall\nsplit apart, and the ashes on it shall be\npoured out.\"\nSo it came to pass when King\nJeroboam heard the saying of the man\nof God, who cried out against the altar in\nBethel, that he stretched out his hand\nfrom the altar, saying, \"Arrest him!\" Then\nhis hand, which he stretched out toward\nhim, withered, so that he could not pull it\nback to himself.\nfather the words which he had spoken to\nthe king.\nAnd their father said to them, \"Which\nway did he go?\" For his sons had seen\nwhich way the man of God went who\ncame from Judah.\nThe altar also was split apart, and the\nashes poured out from the altar,\naccording to the sign which the man of\nGod had given by the word of the LORD.\nThen the king answered and said to the\nman of God, \"Please entreat the favor of\nthe LORD your God, and pray for me,\nthat my hand may be restored to me.\"\nSo the man of God entreated the LORD,\nand the king's hand was restored to him,\nand became as before.\nThen the king said to the man of God,\n\"Come home with me and refresh\nyourself, and I will give you a reward.\"\nBut the man of God said to the king, \"If\nyou were to give me half your house, I\nwould not go in with you; nor would I eat\nbread nor drink water in this place.\nFor so it was commanded me by the\nword of the LORD, saying, \"You shall\nnot eat bread, nor drink water, nor return\nby the same way you came.\"'\nSo he went another way and did not\nreturn by the way he came to Bethel.\nThen he said to his sons, \"Saddle the\ndonkey for me.\" So they saddled the\ndonkey for him; and he rode on it,\nand went after the man of God, and\nfound him sitting under an oak. Then he\nsaid to him, \"Are you the man of God\nwho came from Judah?\" And he said, \"I\nam.\"\nThen he said to him, \"Come home with\nme and eat bread.\"\nAnd he said, \"I cannot return with you\nnor go in with you; neither can I eat\nbread nor drink water with you in this\nplace.\nFor I have been told by the word of the\nLORD, \"You shall not eat bread nor\ndrink water there, nor return by going\nthe way you came.\"'\nHe said to him, \"I too am a prophet as\nyou are, and an angel spoke to me by\nthe word of the LORD, saying, \"Bring\nhim back with you to your house, that he\nmay eat bread and drink water.\"' (He\nwas lying to him.)\nNow an old prophet dwelt in Bethel,\nand his sons came and told him all the\nworks that the man of God had done\nthat day in Bethel; they also told their\nSo he went back with him, and ate\nbread in his house, and drank water.\nNow it happened, as they sat at the\ntable, that the word of the LORD came\nto the prophet who had brought him\nback;\nAnd he spoke to his sons, saying,\n\"Saddle the donkey for me.\" So they\nsaddled it.\nand he cried out to the man of God\nwho came from Judah, saying, \"Thus\nsays the LORD: \"Because you have\ndisobeyed the word of the LORD, and\nhave not kept the commandment which\nthe LORD your God commanded you,\nThen he went and found his corpse\nthrown on the road, and the donkey and\nthe lion standing by the corpse. The lion\nhad not eaten the corpse nor torn the\ndonkey.\nbut you came back, ate bread, and\ndrank water in the place of which the\nLORD said to you, \"Eat no bread and\ndrink no water,\" your corpse shall not\ncome to the tomb of your fathers.\"'\nAnd the prophet took up the corpse of\nthe man of God, laid it on the donkey,\nand brought it back. So the old prophet\ncame to the city to mourn, and to bury\nhim.\nSo it was, after he had eaten bread\nand after he had drunk, that he saddled\nthe donkey for him, the prophet whom\nhe had brought back.\nThen he laid the corpse in his own\ntomb; and they mourned over him,\nsaying, \"Alas, my brother!\"\nWhen he was gone, a lion met him on\nthe road and killed him. And his corpse\nwas thrown on the road, and the donkey\nstood by it. The lion also stood by the\ncorpse.\nSo it was, after he had buried him, that\nhe spoke to his sons, saying, \"When I\nam dead, then bury me in the tomb\nwhere the man of God is buried; lay my\nbones beside his bones.\nAnd there, men passed by and saw\nthe corpse thrown on the road, and the\nlion standing by the corpse. Then they\nwent and told it in the city where the old\nprophet dwelt.\nFor the saying which he cried out by\nthe word of the LORD against the altar\nin Bethel, and against all the shrines on\nthe high places which are in the cities of\nSamaria, will surely come to pass.\"\nNow when the prophet who had\nbrought him back from the way heard it,\nhe said, \"It is the man of God who was\ndisobedient to the word of the LORD.\nTherefore the LORD has delivered him\nto the lion, which has torn him and killed\nhim, according to the word of the LORD\nwhich He spoke to him.\"\nAfter this event Jeroboam did not turn\nfrom his evil way, but again he made\npriests from every class of people for\nthe high places; whoever wished, he\nconsecrated him, and he became one of\nthe priests of the high places.\nAnd this thing was the sin of the house\nof Jeroboam, so as to exterminate and\ndestroy it from the face of the earth.\n14At that time Abijah the son of\nJeroboam became sick.\nAnd Jeroboam said to his wife, \"Please\narise, and disguise yourself, that they\nmay not recognize you as the wife of\nJeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Indeed,\nAhijah the prophet is there, who told me\nthat I would be king over this people.\nAlso take with you ten loaves, some\ncakes, and a jar of honey, and go to\nhim; he will tell you what will become of\nthe child.\"\nAnd Jeroboam's wife did so; she arose\nand went to Shiloh, and came to the\nhouse of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not\nsee, for his eyes were glazed by reason\nof his age.\nNow the LORD had said to Ahijah,\n\"Here is the wife of Jeroboam, coming to\nask you something about her son, for he\nis sick. Thus and thus you shall say to\nher; for it will be, when she comes in,\nthat she will pretend to be another\nwoman.\"\nAnd so it was, when Ahijah heard the\nsound of her footsteps as she came\nthrough the door, he said, \"Come in,\nwife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend\nto be another person? For I have been\nsent to you with bad news.\nGo, tell Jeroboam, \"Thus says the\nLORD God of Israel: \"Because I exalted\nyou from among the people, and made\nyou ruler over My people Israel,\nand tore the kingdom away from the\nhouse of David, and gave it to you; and\nyet you have not been as My servant\nDavid, who kept My commandments\nand who followed Me with all his heart,\nto do only what was right in My eyes;\nbut you have done more evil than all\nwho were before you, for you have gone\nand made for yourself other gods and\nmolded images to provoke Me to anger,\nand have cast Me behind your back-10\ntherefore behold! I will bring disaster\non the house of Jeroboam, and will cut\noff from Jeroboam every male in Israel,\nbond and free; I will take away the\nremnant of the house of Jeroboam, as\none takes away refuse until it is all gone.\nThe dogs shall eat whoever belongs to\nJeroboam and dies in the city, and the\nbirds of the air shall eat whoever dies in\nthe field; for the LORD has spoken!\"'\nArise therefore, go to your own house.\nWhen your feet enter the city, the child\nshall die.\nAnd all Israel shall mourn for him and\nbury him, for he is the only one of\nJeroboam who shall come to the grave,\nbecause in him there is found something\ngood toward the LORD God of Israel in\nthe house of Jeroboam.\n\"Moreover the LORD will raise up for\nHimself a king over Israel who shall cut\noff the house of Jeroboam; this is the\nday. What? Even now!\nFor the LORD will strike Israel, as a\nreed is shaken in the water. He will\nuproot Israel from this good land which\nHe gave to their fathers, and will scatter\nthem beyond the River, because they\nhave made their wooden images,\nprovoking the LORD to anger.\nAnd He will give Israel up because of\nthe sins of Jeroboam, who sinned and\nwho made Israel sin.\"\nThen Jeroboam's wife arose and\ndeparted, and came to Tirzah. When\nshe came to the threshold of the house,\nthe child died.\ncommitted, more than all that their\nfathers had done.\nFor they also built for themselves high\nplaces, sacred pillars, and wooden\nimages on every high hill and under\nevery green tree.\nAnd there were also perverted persons\nin the land. They did according to all the\nabominations of the nations which the\nLORD had cast out before the children\nof Israel.\nAnd they buried him; and all Israel\nmourned for him, according to the word\nof the LORD which He spoke through\nHis servant Ahijah the prophet.\nNow the rest of the acts of Jeroboam,\nhow he made war and how he reigned,\nindeed they are written in the book of\nthe chronicles of the kings of Israel.\nIt happened in the fifth year of King\nRehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt\ncame up against Jerusalem.\nAnd he took away the treasures of the\nhouse of the LORD and the treasures of\nthe king's house; he took away\neverything. He also took away all the\ngold shields which Solomon had made.\nThe period that Jeroboam reigned was\ntwenty-two years. So he rested with his\nfathers. Then Nadab his son reigned in\nhis place.\nThen King Rehoboam made bronze\nshields in their place, and committed\nthem to the hands of the captains of the\nguard, who guarded the doorway of the\nking's house.\nAnd Rehoboam the son of Solomon\nreigned in Judah. Rehoboam was fortyone years old when he became king. He\nreigned seventeen years in Jerusalem,\nthe city which the LORD had chosen out\nof all the tribes of Israel, to put His name\nthere. His mother's name was Naamah,\nan Ammonitess.\nNow Judah did evil in the sight of the\nLORD, and they provoked Him to\njealousy with their sins which they\nAnd whenever the king entered the\nhouse of the LORD, the guards carried\nthem, then brought them back into the\nguardroom.\nNow the rest of the acts of Rehoboam,\nand all that he did, are they not written\nin the book of the chronicles of the kings\nof Judah?\nAnd\nthere\nwas\nwar\nbetween\nRehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.\nSo Rehoboam rested with his fathers,\nand was buried with his fathers in the\nCity of David. His mother's name was\nNaamah, an Ammonitess. Then Abijam\nhis son reigned in his place.\n15In the eighteenth year of King\nJeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam\nbecame king over Judah.\nSo Abijam rested with his fathers, and\nthey buried him in the City of David.\nThen Asa his son reigned in his place.\nIn the twentieth year of Jeroboam king\nof Israel, Asa became king over Judah.\nAnd he reigned forty-one years in\nJerusalem. His grandmother's name\nwas Maachah the granddaughter of\nAbishalom.\nHe reigned three years in Jerusalem.\nHis mother's name was Maachah the\ngranddaughter of Abishalom.\nAsa did what was right in the eyes of\nthe LORD, as did his father David.\nAnd he walked in all the sins of his\nfather, which he had done before him;\nhis heart was not loyal to the LORD his\nGod, as was the heart of his father\nDavid.\nAnd he banished the perverted\npersons from the land, and removed all\nthe idols that his fathers had made.\nNevertheless for David's sake the\nLORD his God gave him a lamp in\nJerusalem, by setting up his son after\nhim and by establishing Jerusalem;\nAlso he removed Maachah his\ngrandmother from being queen mother,\nbecause she had made an obscene\nimage of Asherah. And Asa cut down\nher obscene image and burned it by the\nBrook Kidron.\nbecause David did what was right in the\neyes of the LORD, and had not turned\naside\nfrom\nanything\nthat\nHe\ncommanded him all the days of his life,\nexcept in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.\nAnd there was war between Rehoboam\nand Jeroboam all the days of his life.\nBut the high places were not removed.\nNevertheless Asa's heart was loyal to\nthe LORD all his days.\nHe also brought into the house of the\nLORD the things which his father had\ndedicated, and the things which he\nhimself had dedicated: silver and gold\nand utensils.\nNow the rest of the acts of Abijam, and\nall that he did, are they not written in the\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of\nJudah? And there was war between\nAbijam and Jeroboam.\nNow there was war between Asa and\nBaasha king of Israel all their days.\nAnd Baasha king of Israel came up\nagainst Judah, and built Ramah, that he\nmight let none go out or come in to Asa\nking of Judah.\nThen Asa took all the silver and gold\nthat was left in the treasuries of the\nhouse of the LORD and the treasuries of\nthe king's house, and delivered them\ninto the hand of his servants. And King\nAsa sent them to Ben-Hadad the son of\nTabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of\nSyria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,\nDavid his father. Then Jehoshaphat his\nson reigned in his place.\nNow Nadab the son of Jeroboam\nbecame king over Israel in the second\nyear of Asa king of Judah, and he\nreigned over Israel two years.\n\"Let there be a treaty between you and\nme, as there was between my father\nand your father. See, I have sent you a\npresent of silver and gold. Come and\nbreak your treaty with Baasha king of\nIsrael, so that he will withdraw from me.\"\nSo Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and\nsent the captains of his armies against\nthe cities of Israel. He attacked Ijon, Dan,\nAbel Beth Maachah, and all Chinneroth,\nwith all the land of Naphtali.\nNow it happened, when Baasha heard\nit, that he stopped building Ramah, and\nremained in Tirzah.\nThen King Asa made a proclamation\nthroughout all Judah; none was\nexempted. And they took away the\nstones and timber of Ramah, which\nBaasha had used for building; and with\nthem King Asa built Geba of Benjamin,\nand Mizpah.\nThe rest of all the acts of Asa, all his\nmight, all that he did, and the cities\nwhich he built, are they not written in the\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of\nJudah? But in the time of his old age he\nwas diseased in his feet.\nSo Asa rested with his fathers, and\nwas buried with his fathers in the City of\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the\nLORD, and walked in the way of his\nfather, and in his sin by which he had\nmade Israel sin.\nThen Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the\nhouse of Issachar, conspired against\nhim. And Baasha killed him at\nGibbethon, which belonged to the\nPhilistines, while Nadab and all Israel\nlaid siege to Gibbethon.\nBaasha killed him in the third year of\nAsa king of Judah, and reigned in his\nplace.\nAnd it was so, when he became king,\nthat he killed all the house of Jeroboam.\nHe did not leave to Jeroboam anyone\nthat breathed, until he had destroyed\nhim, according to the word of the LORD\nwhich He had spoken by His servant\nAhijah the Shilonite,\nbecause of the sins of Jeroboam,\nwhich he had sinned and by which he\nhad made Israel sin, because of his\nprovocation with which he had provoked\nthe LORD God of Israel to anger.\nNow the rest of the acts of Nadab, and\nall that he did, are they not written in the\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of\nIsrael?\nAnd there was war between Asa and\nBaasha king of Israel all their days.\nIn the third year of Asa king of Judah,\nBaasha the son of Ahijah became king\nover all Israel in Tirzah, and reigned\ntwenty-four years.\nAnd also the word of the LORD came\nby the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani\nagainst Baasha and his house, because\nof all the evil that he did in the sight of\nthe LORD in provoking Him to anger\nwith the work of his hands, in being like\nthe house of Jeroboam, and because he\nkilled them.\nHe did evil in the sight of the LORD,\nand walked in the way of Jeroboam, and\nin his sin by which he had made Israel\nsin.\n16Then the word of the LORD came\nto Jehu the son of Hanani, against\nBaasha, saying:\n\"Inasmuch as I lifted you out of the dust\nand made you ruler over My people\nIsrael, and you have walked in the way\nof Jeroboam, and have made My people\nIsrael sin, to provoke Me to anger with\ntheir sins,\nsurely I will take away the posterity of\nBaasha and the posterity of his house,\nand I will make your house like the\nhouse of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\nThe dogs shall eat whoever belongs to\nBaasha and dies in the city, and the\nbirds of the air shall eat whoever dies in\nthe fields.\"\nNow the rest of the acts of Baasha,\nwhat he did, and his might, are they not\nwritten in the book of the chronicles of\nthe kings of Israel?\nSo Baasha rested with his fathers and\nwas buried in Tirzah. Then Elah his son\nreigned in his place.\nIn the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of\nJudah, Elah the son of Baasha became\nking over Israel, and reigned two years\nin Tirzah.\nNow his servant Zimri, commander of\nhalf his chariots, conspired against him\nas he was in Tirzah drinking himself\ndrunk in the house of Arza, steward of\nhis house in Tirzah.\nAnd Zimri went in and struck him and\nkilled him in the twenty-seventh year of\nAsa king of Judah, and reigned in his\nplace.\nThen it came to pass, when he began\nto reign, as soon as he was seated on\nhis throne, that he killed all the\nhousehold of Baasha; he did not leave\nhim one male, neither of his relatives\nnor of his friends.\nThus Zimri destroyed all the household\nof Baasha, according to the word of the\nLORD, which He spoke against Baasha\nby Jehu the prophet,\nfor all the sins of Baasha and the sins\nof Elah his son, by which they had\nsinned and by which they had made\nIsrael sin, in provoking the LORD God of\nIsrael to anger with their idols.\nNow the rest of the acts of Elah, and\nall that he did, are they not written in the\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of\nIsrael?\nBut the people who followed Omri\nprevailed over the people who followed\nTibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died\nand Omri reigned.\nIn the twenty-seventh year of Asa king\nof Judah, Zimri had reigned in Tirzah\nseven days. And the people were\nencamped against Gibbethon, which\nbelonged to the Philistines.\nIn the thirty-first year of Asa king of\nJudah, Omri became king over Israel,\nand reigned twelve years. Six years he\nreigned in Tirzah.\nNow the people who were encamped\nheard it said, \"Zimri has conspired and\nalso has killed the king.\" So all Israel\nmade Omri, the commander of the army,\nking over Israel that day in the camp.\nAnd he bought the hill of Samaria from\nShemer for two talents of silver; then he\nbuilt on the hill, and called the name of\nthe city which he built, Samaria, after\nthe name of Shemer, owner of the hill.\nThen Omri and all Israel with him went\nup from Gibbethon, and they besieged\nTirzah.\nOmri did evil in the eyes of the LORD,\nand did worse than all who were before\nhim.\nAnd it happened, when Zimri saw that\nthe city was taken, that he went into the\ncitadel of the king's house and burned\nthe king's house down upon himself with\nfire, and died,\nFor he walked in all the ways of\nJeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his\nsin by which he had made Israel sin,\nprovoking the LORD God of Israel to\nanger with their idols.\nbecause of the sins which he had\ncommitted in doing evil in the sight of\nthe LORD, in walking in the way of\nJeroboam, and in his sin which he had\ncommitted to make Israel sin.\nNow the rest of the acts of Zimri, and\nthe treason he committed, are they not\nwritten in the book of the chronicles of\nthe kings of Israel?\nThen the people of Israel were divided\ninto two parts: half of the people\nfollowed Tibni the son of Ginath, to\nmake him king, and half followed Omri.\nNow the rest of the acts of Omri which\nhe did, and the might that he showed,\nare they not written in the book of the\nchronicles of the kings of Israel?\nSo Omri rested with his fathers and\nwas buried in Samaria. Then Ahab his\nson reigned in his place.\nIn the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of\nJudah, Ahab the son of Omri became\nking over Israel; and Ahab the son of\nOmri reigned over Israel in Samaria\ntwenty-two years.\nNow Ahab the son of Omri did evil in\nthe sight of the LORD, more than all\nwho were before him.\nAnd it will be that you shall drink from\nthe brook, and I have commanded the\nravens to feed you there.\"\nAnd it came to pass, as though it had\nbeen a trivial thing for him to walk in the\nsins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that\nhe took as wife Jezebel the daughter of\nEthbaal, king of the Sidonians; and he\nwent and served Baal and worshiped\nhim.\nThen he set up an altar for Baal in the\ntemple of Baal, which he had built in\nSamaria.\nAnd Ahab made a wooden image.\nAhab did more to provoke the LORD\nGod of Israel to anger than all the kings\nof Israel who were before him.\nIn his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho.\nHe laid its foundation with Abiram his\nfirstborn, and with his youngest son\nSegub he set up its gates, according to\nthe word of the LORD, which He had\nspoken through Joshua the son of Nun.\n17And Elijah the Tishbite, of the\ninhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, \"As\nthe LORD God of Israel lives, before\nwhom I stand, there shall not be dew\nnor rain these years, except at my\nword.\"\nSo he went and did according to the\nword of the LORD, for he went and\nstayed by the Brook Cherith, which\nflows into the Jordan.\nThe ravens brought him bread and\nmeat in the morning, and bread and\nmeat in the evening; and he drank from\nthe brook.\nAnd it happened after a while that the\nbrook dried up, because there had been\nno rain in the land.\nThen the word of the LORD came to\nhim, saying,\n\"Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs\nto Sidon, and dwell there. See, I have\ncommanded a widow there to provide\nfor you.\"\nSo he arose and went to Zarephath.\nAnd when he came to the gate of the\ncity, indeed a widow was there\ngathering sticks. And he called to her\nand said, \"Please bring me a little water\nin a cup, that I may drink.\"\nAnd as she was going to get it, he\ncalled to her and said, \"Please bring me\na morsel of bread in your hand.\"\nThen the word of the LORD came to\nhim, saying,\n\"Get away from here and turn eastward,\nand hide by the Brook Cherith, which\nflows into the Jordan.\nSo she said, \"As the LORD your God\nlives, I do not have bread, only a handful\nof flour in a bin, and a little oil in a jar;\nand see, I am gathering a couple of\nsticks that I may go in and prepare it for\nmyself and my son, that we may eat it,\nand die.\"\nbrought tragedy on the widow with\nwhom I lodge, by killing her son?\"\nAnd Elijah said to her, \"Do not fear; go\nand do as you have said, but make me\na small cake from it first, and bring it to\nme; and afterward make some for\nyourself and your son.\nAnd he stretched himself out on the\nchild three times, and cried out to the\nLORD and said, \"O LORD my God, I\npray, let this child's soul come back to\nhim.\"\nFor thus says the LORD God of Israel:\n\"The bin of flour shall not be used up,\nnor shall the jar of oil run dry, until the\nday the LORD sends rain on the earth.\"'\nThen the LORD heard the voice of\nElijah; and the soul of the child came\nback to him, and he revived.\nSo she went away and did according\nto the word of Elijah; and she and he\nand her household ate for many days.\nAnd Elijah took the child and brought\nhim down from the upper room into the\nhouse, and gave him to his mother. And\nElijah said, \"See, your son lives!\"\nThe bin of flour was not used up, nor\ndid the jar of oil run dry, according to the\nword of the LORD which He spoke by\nElijah.\nThen the woman said to Elijah, \"Now\nby this I know that you are a man of God,\nand that the word of the LORD in your\nmouth is the truth.\"\n18And it came to pass after many\nNow it happened after these things\nthat the son of the woman who owned\nthe house became sick. And his\nsickness was so serious that there was\nno breath left in him.\nSo she said to Elijah, \"What have I to\ndo with you, O man of God? Have you\ncome to me to bring my sin to\nremembrance, and to kill my son?\"\nAnd he said to her, \"Give me your\nson.\" So he took him out of her arms\nand carried him to the upper room\nwhere he was staying, and laid him on\nhis own bed.\nThen he cried out to the LORD and\nsaid, \"O LORD my God, have You also\ndays that the word of the LORD came to\nElijah, in the third year, saying, \"Go,\npresent yourself to Ahab, and I will send\nrain on the earth.\"\nSo Elijah went to present himself to\nAhab; and there was a severe famine in\nSamaria.\nAnd Ahab had called Obadiah, who\nwas in charge of his house. (Now\nObadiah feared the LORD greatly.\nFor so it was, while Jezebel massacred\nthe prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah\nhad taken one hundred prophets and\nhidden them, fifty to a cave, and had fed\nthem with bread and water.)\nAnd Ahab had said to Obadiah, \"Go\ninto the land to all the springs of water\nand to all the brooks; perhaps we may\nfind grass to keep the horses and mules\nalive, so that we will not have to kill any\nlivestock.\"\nWas it not reported to my lord what I\ndid when Jezebel killed the prophets of\nthe LORD, how I hid one hundred men\nof the LORD's prophets, fifty to a cave,\nand fed them with bread and water?\nSo they divided the land between them\nto explore it; Ahab went one way by\nhimself, and Obadiah went another way\nby himself.\nNow as Obadiah was on his way,\nsuddenly Elijah met him; and he\nrecognized him, and fell on his face, and\nsaid, \"Is that you, my lord Elijah?\"\nAnd now you say, \"Go, tell your master,\n\"Elijah is here.\"' He will kill me!\"\nThen Elijah said, \"As the LORD of\nhosts lives, before whom I stand, I will\nsurely present myself to him today.\"\nSo Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and\ntold him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.\nAnd he answered him, \"It is I. Go, tell\nyour master, \"Elijah is here.\"'\nThen it happened, when Ahab saw\nElijah, that Ahab said to him, \"Is that you,\nO troubler of Israel?\"\nSo he said, \"How have I sinned, that\nyou are delivering your servant into the\nhand of Ahab, to kill me?\nAs the LORD your God lives, there is\nno nation or kingdom where my master\nhas not sent someone to hunt for you;\nand when they said, \"He is not here,' he\ntook an oath from the kingdom or nation\nthat they could not find you.\nAnd now you say, \"Go, tell your master,\n\"Elijah is here\"'!\nAnd it shall come to pass, as soon as I\nam gone from you, that the Spirit of the\nLORD will carry you to a place I do not\nknow; so when I go and tell Ahab, and\nhe cannot find you, he will kill me. But I\nyour servant have feared the LORD\nfrom my youth.\nAnd he answered, \"I have not troubled\nIsrael, but you and your father's house\nhave, in that you have forsaken the\ncommandments of the LORD and have\nfollowed the Baals.\nNow therefore, send and gather all\nIsrael to me on Mount Carmel, the four\nhundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and\nthe four hundred prophets of Asherah,\nwho eat at Jezebel's table.\"\nSo Ahab sent for all the children of\nIsrael, and gathered the prophets\ntogether on Mount Carmel.\nAnd Elijah came to all the people, and\nsaid, \"How long will you falter between\ntwo opinions? If the LORD is God, follow\nHim; but if Baal, follow him.\" But the\npeople answered him not a word.\nThen Elijah said to the people, \"I alone\nam left a prophet of the LORD; but\nBaal's prophets are four hundred and\nfifty men.\nAnd when midday was past, they\nprophesied until the time of the offering\nof the evening sacrifice. But there was\nno voice; no one answered, no one paid\nattention.\nTherefore let them give us two bulls;\nand let them choose one bull for\nthemselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on\nthe wood, but put no fire under it; and I\nwill prepare the other bull, and lay it on\nthe wood, but put no fire under it.\nThen Elijah said to all the people,\n\"Come near to me.\" So all the people\ncame near to him. And he repaired the\naltar of the LORD that was broken down.\nThen you call on the name of your\ngods, and I will call on the name of the\nLORD; and the God who answers by fire,\nHe is God.\" So all the people answered\nand said, \"It is well spoken.\"\nAnd Elijah took twelve stones,\naccording to the number of the tribes of\nthe sons of Jacob, to whom the word of\nthe LORD had come, saying, \"Israel\nshall be your name.\"\nNow Elijah said to the prophets of Baal,\n\"Choose one bull for yourselves and\nprepare it first, for you are many; and\ncall on the name of your god, but put no\nfire under it.\"\nSo they took the bull which was given\nthem, and they prepared it, and called\non the name of Baal from morning even\ntill noon, saying, \"O Baal, hear us!\" But\nthere was no voice; no one answered.\nThen they leaped about the altar which\nthey had made.\nAnd so it was, at noon, that Elijah\nmocked them and said, \"Cry aloud, for\nhe is a god; either he is meditating, or\nhe is busy, or he is on a journey, or\nperhaps he is sleeping and must be\nawakened.\"\nSo they cried aloud, and cut\nthemselves, as was their custom, with\nknives and lances, until the blood\ngushed out on them.\nThen with the stones he built an altar\nin the name of the LORD; and he made\na trench around the altar large enough\nto hold two seahs of seed.\nAnd he put the wood in order, cut the\nbull in pieces, and laid it on the wood,\nand said, \"Fill four waterpots with water,\nand pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on\nthe wood.\"\nThen he said, \"Do it a second time,\"\nand they did it a second time; and he\nsaid, \"Do it a third time,\" and they did it a\nthird time.\nSo the water ran all around the altar;\nand he also filled the trench with water.\nAnd it came to pass, at the time of the\noffering of the evening sacrifice, that\nElijah the prophet came near and said,\n\"LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and\nIsrael, let it be known this day that You\nare God in Israel and I am Your servant,\nand that I have done all these things at\nYour word.\n\"Prepare your chariot, and go down\nbefore the rain stops you.\"'\nHear me, O LORD, hear me, that this\npeople may know that You are the\nLORD God, and that You have turned\ntheir hearts back to You again.\"\nNow it happened in the meantime that\nthe sky became black with clouds and\nwind, and there was a heavy rain. So\nAhab rode away and went to Jezreel.\nThen the fire of the LORD fell and\nconsumed the burnt sacrifice, and the\nwood and the stones and the dust, and\nit licked up the water that was in the\ntrench.\nNow when all the people saw it, they\nfell on their faces; and they said, \"The\nLORD, He is God! The LORD, He is\nGod!\"\nAnd Elijah said to them, \"Seize the\nprophets of Baal! Do not let one of them\nescape!\" So they seized them; and\nElijah brought them down to the Brook\nKishon and executed them there.\nThen Elijah said to Ahab, \"Go up, eat\nand drink; for there is the sound of\nabundance of rain.\"\nSo Ahab went up to eat and drink. And\nElijah went up to the top of Carmel; then\nhe bowed down on the ground, and put\nhis face between his knees,\nand said to his servant, \"Go up now,\nlook toward the sea.\" So he went up and\nlooked, and said, \"There is nothing.\"\nAnd seven times he said, \"Go again.\"\nThen it came to pass the seventh time,\nthat he said, \"There is a cloud, as small\nas a man's hand, rising out of the sea!\"\nSo he said, \"Go up, say to Ahab,\nThen the hand of the LORD came\nupon Elijah; and he girded up his loins\nand ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance\nof Jezreel.\n19And Ahab told Jezebel all that\nElijah had done, also how he had\nexecuted all the prophets with the sword.\nThen Jezebel sent a messenger to\nElijah, saying, \"So let the gods do to me,\nand more also, if I do not make your life\nas the life of one of them by tomorrow\nabout this time.\"\nAnd when he saw that, he arose and\nran for his life, and went to Beersheba,\nwhich belongs to Judah, and left his\nservant there.\nBut he himself went a day's journey into\nthe wilderness, and came and sat down\nunder a broom tree. And he prayed that\nhe might die, and said, \"It is enough!\nNow, LORD, take my life, for I am no\nbetter than my fathers!\"\nThen as he lay and slept under a\nbroom tree, suddenly an angel touched\nhim, and said to him, \"Arise and eat.\"\nThen he looked, and there by his head\nwas a cake baked on coals, and a jar of\nwater. So he ate and drank, and lay\ndown again.\nAnd the angel of the LORD came back\nthe second time, and touched him, and\nsaid, \"Arise and eat, because the\njourney is too great for you.\"\nout and stood in the entrance of the\ncave. Suddenly a voice came to him,\nand said, \"What are you doing here,\nElijah?\"\nSo he arose, and ate and drank; and he\nwent in the strength of that food forty\ndays and forty nights as far as Horeb,\nthe mountain of God.\nAnd he said, \"I have been very\nzealous for the LORD God of hosts;\nbecause the children of Israel have\nforsaken Your covenant, torn down Your\naltars, and killed Your prophets with the\nsword. I alone am left; and they seek to\ntake my life.\"\nAnd there he went into a cave, and\nspent the night in that place; and behold,\nthe word of the LORD came to him, and\nHe said to him, \"What are you doing\nhere, Elijah?\"\nSo he said, \"I have been very zealous\nfor the LORD God of hosts; for the\nchildren of Israel have forsaken Your\ncovenant, torn down Your altars, and\nkilled Your prophets with the sword. I\nalone am left; and they seek to take my\nlife.\"\nThen the LORD said to him: \"Go,\nreturn on your way to the Wilderness of\nDamascus; and when you arrive, anoint\nHazael as king over Syria.\nAlso you shall anoint Jehu the son of\nNimshi as king over Israel. And Elisha\nthe son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah you\nshall anoint as prophet in your place.\nIt shall be that whoever escapes the\nsword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; and\nwhoever escapes the sword of Jehu,\nElisha will kill.\nThen He said, \"Go out, and stand on\nthe mountain before the LORD.\" And\nbehold, the LORD passed by, and a\ngreat and strong wind tore into the\nmountains and broke the rocks in pieces\nbefore the LORD, but the LORD was not\nin the wind; and after the wind an\nearthquake, but the LORD was not in\nthe earthquake;\nand after the earthquake a fire, but the\nLORD was not in the fire; and after the\nfire a still small voice.\nYet I have reserved seven thousand in\nIsrael, all whose knees have not bowed\nto Baal, and every mouth that has not\nkissed him.\"\nSo he departed from there, and found\nElisha the son of Shaphat, who was\nplowing with twelve yoke of oxen before\nhim, and he was with the twelfth. Then\nElijah passed by him and threw his\nmantle on him.\nSo it was, when Elijah heard it, that he\nwrapped his face in his mantle and went\nAnd he left the oxen and ran after\nElijah, and said, \"Please let me kiss my\nfather and my mother, and then I will\nfollow you.\" And he said to him, \"Go\nback again, for what have I done to\nyou?\"\nwhatever is pleasant in your eyes, they\nwill put it in their hands and take it.\"'\nSo Elisha turned back from him, and\ntook a yoke of oxen and slaughtered\nthem and boiled their flesh, using the\noxen's equipment, and gave it to the\npeople, and they ate. Then he arose\nand followed Elijah, and became his\nservant.\n20Now Ben-Hadad the king of Syria\nSo the king of Israel called all the\nelders of the land, and said, \"Notice,\nplease, and see how this man seeks\ntrouble, for he sent to me for my wives,\nmy children, my silver, and my gold; and\nI did not deny him.\"\nAnd all the elders and all the people\nsaid to him, \"Do not listen or consent.\"\ngathered all his forces together; thirtytwo kings were with him, with horses\nand chariots. And he went up and\nbesieged Samaria, and made war\nagainst it.\nTherefore he said to the messengers of\nBen-Hadad, \"Tell my lord the king, \"All\nthat you sent for to your servant the first\ntime I will do, but this thing I cannot do.\"'\nAnd the messengers departed and\nbrought back word to him.\nThen he sent messengers into the city\nto Ahab king of Israel, and said to him,\n\"Thus says Ben-Hadad:\n\"Your silver and your gold are mine;\nyour loveliest wives and children are\nmine.\"'\nAnd the king of Israel answered and\nsaid, \"My lord, O king, just as you say, I\nand all that I have are yours.\"\nThen the messengers came back and\nsaid, \"Thus speaks Ben-Hadad, saying,\n\"Indeed I have sent to you, saying, \"You\nshall deliver to me your silver and your\ngold, your wives and your children\";\nbut I will send my servants to you\ntomorrow about this time, and they shall\nsearch your house and the houses of\nyour servants. And it shall be, that\nThen Ben-Hadad sent to him and said,\n\"The gods do so to me, and more also, if\nenough dust is left of Samaria for a\nhandful for each of the people who\nfollow me.\"\nSo the king of Israel answered and\nsaid, \"Tell him, \"Let not the one who\nputs on his armor boast like the one who\ntakes it off.\"'\nAnd it happened when Ben-Hadad\nheard this message, as he and the kings\nwere drinking at the command post, that\nhe said to his servants, \"Get ready.\" And\nthey got ready to attack the city.\nSuddenly a prophet approached Ahab\nking of Israel, saying, \"Thus says the\nLORD: \"Have you seen all this great\nmultitude? Behold, I will deliver it into\nyour hand today, and you shall know\nthat I am the LORD.\"'\nSo Ahab said, \"By whom?\" And he\nsaid, \"Thus says the LORD: \"By the\nyoung leaders of the provinces.\"' Then\nhe said, \"Who will set the battle in\norder?\" And he answered, \"You.\"\nThen he mustered the young leaders\nof the provinces, and there were two\nhundred and thirty-two; and after them\nhe mustered all the people, all the\nchildren of Israel--seven thousand.\nSo they went out at noon. Meanwhile\nBen-Hadad and the thirty-two kings\nhelping him were getting drunk at the\ncommand post.\nThe young leaders of the provinces\nwent out first. And Ben-Hadad sent out\na patrol, and they told him, saying, \"Men\nare coming out of Samaria!\"\nthe king of Syria will come up against\nyou.\"\nThen the servants of the king of Syria\nsaid to him, \"Their gods are gods of the\nhills. Therefore they were stronger than\nwe; but if we fight against them in the\nplain, surely we will be stronger than\nthey.\nSo do this thing: Dismiss the kings,\neach from his position, and put captains\nin their places;\nand you shall muster an army like the\narmy that you have lost, horse for horse\nand chariot for chariot. Then we will fight\nagainst them in the plain; surely we will\nbe stronger than they.\" And he listened\nto their voice and did so.\nSo he said, \"If they have come out for\npeace, take them alive; and if they have\ncome out for war, take them alive.\"\nSo it was, in the spring of the year,\nthat Ben-Hadad mustered the Syrians\nand went up to Aphek to fight against\nIsrael.\nThen these young leaders of the\nprovinces went out of the city with the\narmy which followed them.\nAnd each one killed his man; so the\nSyrians fled, and Israel pursued them;\nand Ben-Hadad the king of Syria\nescaped on a horse with the cavalry.\nThen the king of Israel went out and\nattacked the horses and chariots, and\nkilled the Syrians with a great slaughter.\nAnd the prophet came to the king of\nIsrael and said to him, \"Go, strengthen\nyourself; take note, and see what you\nshould do, for in the spring of the year\nAnd the children of Israel were\nmustered and given provisions, and they\nwent against them. Now the children of\nIsrael encamped before them like two\nlittle flocks of goats, while the Syrians\nfilled the countryside.\nThen a man of God came and spoke\nto the king of Israel, and said, \"Thus\nsays the LORD: \"Because the Syrians\nhave said, \"The LORD is God of the hills,\nbut He is not God of the valleys,\"\ntherefore I will deliver all this great\nmultitude into your hand, and you shall\nknow that I am the LORD.\"'\nAnd they encamped opposite each\nother for seven days. So it was that on\nthe seventh day the battle was joined;\nand the children of Israel killed one\nhundred thousand foot soldiers of the\nSyrians in one day.\nBut the rest fled to Aphek, into the city;\nthen a wall fell on twenty-seven\nthousand of the men who were left. And\nBen-Hadad fled and went into the city,\ninto an inner chamber.\nThen his servants said to him, \"Look\nnow, we have heard that the kings of the\nhouse of Israel are merciful kings.\nPlease, let us put sackcloth around our\nwaists and ropes around our heads, and\ngo out to the king of Israel; perhaps he\nwill spare your life.\"\nSo they wore sackcloth around their\nwaists and put ropes around their heads,\nand came to the king of Israel and said,\n\"Your servant Ben-Hadad says, \"Please\nlet me live.\"' And he said, \"Is he still\nalive? He is my brother.\"\nNow the men were watching closely to\nsee whether any sign of mercy would\ncome from him; and they quickly\ngrasped at this word and said, \"Your\nbrother Ben-Hadad.\" So he said, \"Go,\nbring him.\" Then Ben-Hadad came out\nto him; and he had him come up into the\nchariot.\nSo Ben-Hadad said to him, \"The cities\nwhich my father took from your father I\nwill restore; and you may set up\nmarketplaces for yourself in Damascus,\nas my father did in Samaria.\" Then Ahab\nsaid, \"I will send you away with this\ntreaty.\" So he made a treaty with him\nand sent him away.\nNow a certain man of the sons of the\nprophets said to his neighbor by the\nword of the LORD, \"Strike me, please.\"\nAnd the man refused to strike him.\nThen he said to him, \"Because you\nhave not obeyed the voice of the LORD,\nsurely, as soon as you depart from me,\na lion shall kill you.\" And as soon as he\nleft him, a lion found him and killed him.\nAnd he found another man, and said,\n\"Strike me, please.\" So the man struck\nhim, inflicting a wound.\nThen the prophet departed and waited\nfor the king by the road, and disguised\nhimself with a bandage over his eyes.\nNow as the king passed by, he cried\nout to the king and said, \"Your servant\nwent out into the midst of the battle; and\nthere, a man came over and brought a\nman to me, and said, \"Guard this man; if\nby any means he is missing, your life\nshall be for his life, or else you shall pay\na talent of silver.'\nWhile your servant was busy here and\nthere, he was gone.\" Then the king of\nIsrael said to him, \"So shall your\njudgment be; you yourself have decided\nit.\"\nAnd he hastened to take the bandage\naway from his eyes; and the king of\nIsrael recognized him as one of the\nprophets.\nThen he said to him, \"Thus says the\nLORD: \"Because you have let slip out of\nyour hand a man whom I appointed to\nutter destruction, therefore your life shall\ngo for his life, and your people for his\npeople.\"'\n\"Give me your vineyard for money; or\nelse, if it pleases you, I will give you\nanother vineyard for it.' And he\nanswered, \"I will not give you my\nvineyard.\"'\nSo the king of Israel went to his house\nsullen and displeased, and came to\nSamaria.\nThen Jezebel his wife said to him, \"You\nnow exercise authority over Israel! Arise,\neat food, and let your heart be cheerful;\nI will give you the vineyard of Naboth the\nJezreelite.\"\n21And it came to pass after these\nthings that Naboth the Jezreelite had a\nvineyard which was in Jezreel, next to\nthe palace of Ahab king of Samaria.\nSo Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying,\n\"Give me your vineyard, that I may have\nit for a vegetable garden, because it is\nnear, next to my house; and for it I will\ngive you a vineyard better than it. Or, if it\nseems good to you, I will give you its\nworth in money.\"\nBut Naboth said to Ahab, \"The LORD\nforbid that I should give the inheritance\nof my fathers to you!\"\nSo Ahab went into his house sullen and\ndispleased because of the word which\nNaboth the Jezreelite had spoken to\nhim; for he had said, \"I will not give you\nthe inheritance of my fathers.\" And he\nlay down on his bed, and turned away\nhis face, and would eat no food.\nBut Jezebel his wife came to him, and\nsaid to him, \"Why is your spirit so sullen\nthat you eat no food?\"\nHe said to her, \"Because I spoke to\nNaboth the Jezreelite, and said to him,\nAnd she wrote letters in Ahab's name,\nsealed them with his seal, and sent the\nletters to the elders and the nobles who\nwere dwelling in the city with Naboth.\nShe wrote in the letters, saying, 4\nProclaim a fast, and seat Naboth with\nhigh honor among the people;\nand seat two men, scoundrels, before\nhim to bear witness against him, saying,\nYou have blasphemed God and the king.\nThen take him out, and stone him, that\nhe may die.\nSo the men of his city, the elders and\nnobles who were inhabitants of his city,\ndid as Jezebel had sent to them, as it\nwas written in the letters which she had\nsent to them.\nThey proclaimed a fast, and seated\nNaboth with high honor among the\npeople.\nAnd two men, scoundrels, came in and\nsat before him; and the scoundrels\nwitnessed against him, against Naboth,\nin the presence of the people, saying,\n\"Naboth has blasphemed God and the\nking!\" Then they took him outside the\ncity and stoned him with stones, so that\nhe died.\noff from Ahab every male in Israel, both\nbond and free.\nThen they sent to Jezebel, saying,\n\"Naboth has been stoned and is dead.\"\nAnd it came to pass, when Jezebel\nheard that Naboth had been stoned and\nwas dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab,\n\"Arise, take possession of the vineyard\nof Naboth the Jezreelite, which he\nrefused to give you for money; for\nNaboth is not alive, but dead.\"\nI will make your house like the house\nof Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like\nthe house of Baasha the son of Ahijah,\nbecause of the provocation with which\nyou have provoked Me to anger, and\nmade Israel sin.'\nAnd concerning Jezebel the LORD\nalso spoke, saying, \"The dogs shall eat\nJezebel by the wall of Jezreel.'\nSo it was, when Ahab heard that\nNaboth was dead, that Ahab got up and\nwent down to take possession of the\nvineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.\nThe dogs shall eat whoever belongs to\nAhab and dies in the city, and the birds\nof the air shall eat whoever dies in the\nfield.\"\nThen the word of the LORD came to\nElijah the Tishbite, saying,\n\"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of\nIsrael, who lives in Samaria. There he is,\nin the vineyard of Naboth, where he has\ngone down to take possession of it.\nYou shall speak to him, saying, \"Thus\nsays the LORD: \"Have you murdered\nand also taken possession?\"' And you\nshall speak to him, saying, \"Thus says\nthe LORD: \"In the place where dogs\nlicked the blood of Naboth, dogs shall\nlick your blood, even yours.\"\"'\nSo Ahab said to Elijah, \"Have you\nfound me, O my enemy?\" And he\nanswered, \"I have found you, because\nyou have sold yourself to do evil in the\nsight of the LORD:\n\"Behold, I will bring calamity on you. I\nwill take away your posterity, and will cut\nBut there was no one like Ahab who\nsold himself to do wickedness in the\nsight of the LORD, because Jezebel his\nwife stirred him up.\nAnd he behaved very abominably in\nfollowing idols, according to all that the\nAmorites had done, whom the LORD\nhad cast out before the children of Israel.\nSo it was, when Ahab heard those\nwords, that he tore his clothes and put\nsackcloth on his body, and fasted and\nlay in sackcloth, and went about\nmourning.\nAnd the word of the LORD came to\nElijah the Tishbite, saying,\n\"See how Ahab has humbled himself\nbefore Me? Because he has humbled\nhimself before Me, I will not bring the\ncalamity in his days. In the days of his\nson I will bring the calamity on his\nhouse.\"\n22Now three years passed without\nwar between Syria and Israel.\nThen it came to pass, in the third year,\nthat Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went\ndown to visit the king of Israel.\nAnd the king of Israel said to his\nservants, \"Do you know that Ramoth in\nGilead is ours, but we hesitate to take it\nout of the hand of the king of Syria?\"\nSo he said to Jehoshaphat, \"Will you\ngo with me to fight at Ramoth Gilead?\"\nJehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, \"I\nam as you are, my people as your\npeople, my horses as your horses.\"\nAlso Jehoshaphat said to the king of\nIsrael, \"Please inquire for the word of\nthe LORD today.\"\nThen the king of Israel gathered the\nprophets together, about four hundred\nmen, and said to them, \"Shall I go\nagainst Ramoth Gilead to fight, or shall I\nrefrain?\" So they said, \"Go up, for the\nLord will deliver it into the hand of the\nking.\"\nAnd Jehoshaphat said, \"Is there not still\na prophet of the LORD here, that we\nmay inquire of Him?\"\nSo the king of Israel said to\nJehoshaphat, \"There is still one man,\nMicaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we\nmay inquire of the LORD; but I hate him,\nbecause he does not prophesy good\nconcerning\nme,\nbut\nevil.\"\nAnd\nJehoshaphat said, \"Let not the king say\nsuch things!\"\nThen the king of Israel called an officer\nand said, \"Bring Micaiah the son of\nImlah quickly!\"\nThe king of Israel and Jehoshaphat\nthe king of Judah, having put on their\nrobes, sat each on his throne, at a\nthreshing floor at the entrance of the\ngate of Samaria; and all the prophets\nprophesied before them.\nNow Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah\nhad made horns of iron for himself; and\nhe said, \"Thus says the LORD: \"With\nthese you shall gore the Syrians until\nthey are destroyed.\"'\nAnd all the prophets prophesied so,\nsaying, \"Go up to Ramoth Gilead and\nprosper, for the LORD will deliver it into\nthe king's hand.\"\nThen the messenger who had gone to\ncall Micaiah spoke to him, saying, \"Now\nlisten, the words of the prophets with\none accord encourage the king. Please,\nlet your word be like the word of one of\nthem, and speak encouragement.\"\nAnd Micaiah said, \"As the LORD lives,\nwhatever the LORD says to me, that I\nwill speak.\"\nThen he came to the king; and the\nking said to him, \"Micaiah, shall we go to\nwar against Ramoth Gilead, or shall we\nrefrain?\" And he answered him, \"Go and\nprosper, for the LORD will deliver it into\nthe hand of the king!\"\nSo the king said to him, \"How many\ntimes shall I make you swear that you\ntell me nothing but the truth in the name\nof the LORD?\"\nNow Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah\nwent near and struck Micaiah on the\ncheek, and said, \"Which way did the\nspirit from the LORD go from me to\nspeak to you?\"\nThen he said, \"I saw all Israel\nscattered on the mountains, as sheep\nthat have no shepherd. And the LORD\nsaid, \"These have no master. Let each\nreturn to his house in peace.\"'\nAnd Micaiah said, \"Indeed, you shall\nsee on that day when you go into an\ninner chamber to hide!\"\nAnd the king of Israel said to\nJehoshaphat, \"Did I not tell you he\nwould not prophesy good concerning\nme, but evil?\"\nSo the king of Israel said, \"Take\nMicaiah, and return him to Amon the\ngovernor of the city and to Joash the\nking's son;\nThen Micaiah said, \"Therefore hear\nthe word of the LORD: I saw the LORD\nsitting on His throne, and all the host of\nheaven standing by, on His right hand\nand on His left.\nAnd the LORD said, \"Who will\npersuade Ahab to go up, that he may\nfall at Ramoth Gilead?' So one spoke in\nthis manner, and another spoke in that\nmanner.\nThen a spirit came forward and stood\nbefore the LORD, and said, \"I will\npersuade him.'\nThe LORD said to him, \"In what way?'\nSo he said, \"I will go out and be a lying\nspirit in the mouth of all his prophets.'\nAnd the LORD said, \"You shall\npersuade him, and also prevail. Go out\nand do so.'\nTherefore look! The LORD has put a\nlying spirit in the mouth of all these\nprophets of yours, and the LORD has\ndeclared disaster against you.\"\nand say, \"Thus says the king: \"Put this\nfellow in prison, and feed him with bread\nof affliction and water of affliction, until I\ncome in peace.\"\"'\nBut Micaiah said, \"If you ever return in\npeace, the LORD has not spoken by\nme.\" And he said, \"Take heed, all you\npeople!\"\nSo the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat\nthe king of Judah went up to Ramoth\nGilead.\nAnd the king of Israel said to\nJehoshaphat, \"I will disguise myself and\ngo into battle; but you put on your\nrobes.\" So the king of Israel disguised\nhimself and went into battle.\nNow the king of Syria had commanded\nthe thirty-two captains of his chariots,\nsaying, \"Fight with no one small or great,\nbut only with the king of Israel.\"\nSo it was, when the captains of the\nchariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they\nsaid, \"Surely it is the king of Israel!\"\nTherefore they turned aside to fight\nagainst him, and Jehoshaphat cried out.\nSo Ahab rested with his fathers. Then\nAhaziah his son reigned in his place.\nAnd it happened, when the captains of\nthe chariots saw that it was not the king\nof Israel, that they turned back from\npursuing him.\nJehoshaphat the son of Asa had\nbecome king over Judah in the fourth\nyear of Ahab king of Israel.\nNow a certain man drew a bow at\nrandom, and struck the king of Israel\nbetween the joints of his armor. So he\nsaid to the driver of his chariot, \"Turn\naround and take me out of the battle, for\nI am wounded.\"\nJehoshaphat was thirty-five years old\nwhen he became king, and he reigned\ntwenty-five years in Jerusalem. His\nmother's name was Azubah the\ndaughter of Shilhi.\nThe battle increased that day; and the\nking was propped up in his chariot,\nfacing the Syrians, and died at evening.\nThe blood ran out from the wound onto\nthe floor of the chariot.\nAnd he walked in all the ways of his\nfather Asa. He did not turn aside from\nthem, doing what was right in the eyes\nof the LORD. Nevertheless the high\nplaces were not taken away, for the\npeople offered sacrifices and burned\nincense on the high places.\nThen, as the sun was going down, a\nshout went throughout the army, saying,\n\"Every man to his city, and every man to\nhis own country!\"\nAlso Jehoshaphat made peace with\nthe king of Israel.\nSo the king died, and was brought to\nSamaria. And they buried the king in\nSamaria.\nNow the rest of the acts of\nJehoshaphat, the might that he showed,\nand how he made war, are they not\nwritten in the book of the chronicles of\nthe kings of Judah?\nThen someone washed the chariot at\na pool in Samaria, and the dogs licked\nup his blood while the harlots bathed,\naccording to the word of the LORD\nwhich He had spoken.\nNow the rest of the acts of Ahab, and\nall that he did, the ivory house which he\nbuilt and all the cities that he built, are\nthey not written in the book of the\nchronicles of the kings of Israel?\nAnd the rest of the perverted persons,\nwho remained in the days of his father\nAsa, he banished from the land.\nThere was then no king in Edom, only\na deputy of the king.\nJehoshaphat made merchant ships to\ngo to Ophir for gold; but they never\nsailed, for the ships were wrecked at\nEzion Geber.\nThen Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to\nJehoshaphat, \"Let my servants go with\nyour servants in the ships.\" But\nJehoshaphat would not.\nAnd Jehoshaphat rested with his\nfathers, and was buried with his fathers\nin the City of David his father. Then\nJehoram his son reigned in his place.\nof Judah, and reigned two years over\nIsrael.\nHe did evil in the sight of the LORD,\nand walked in the way of his father and\nin the way of his mother and in the way\nof Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had\nmade Israel sin;\nAhaziah the son of Ahab became king\nover Israel in Samaria in the\nseventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king\nfor he served Baal and worshiped him,\nand provoked the LORD God of Israel to\nanger, according to all that his father\nhad done.\n2nd Kings\n1Moab rebelled against Israel after the\ndeath of Ahab.\nNow Ahaziah fell through the lattice of\nhis upper room in Samaria, and was\ninjured; so he sent messengers and said\nto them, \"Go, inquire of Baal-Zebub, the\ngod of Ekron, whether I shall recover\nfrom this injury.\"\nBut the angel of the LORD said to\nElijah the Tishbite, \"Arise, go up to meet\nthe messengers of the king of Samaria,\nand say to them, \"Is it because there is\nno God in Israel that you are going to\ninquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of\nEkron?'\nNow therefore, thus says the LORD:\n\"You shall not come down from the bed\nto which you have gone up, but you\nshall surely die.\"' So Elijah departed.\nAnd when the messengers returned to\nhim, he said to them, \"Why have you\ncome back?\"\nSo they said to him, \"A man came up to\nmeet us, and said to us, \"Go, return to\nthe king who sent you, and say to him,\n\"Thus says the LORD: \"Is it because\nthere is no God in Israel that you are\nsending to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the\ngod of Ekron? Therefore you shall not\ncome down from the bed to which you\nhave gone up, but you shall surely\ndie.\"\"\"\nThen he said to them, \"What kind of\nman was it who came up to meet you\nand told you these words?\"\nSo they answered him, \"A hairy man\nwearing a leather belt around his waist.\"\nAnd he said, \"It is Elijah the Tishbite.\"\nThen the king sent to him a captain of\nfifty with his fifty men. So he went up to\nhim; and there he was, sitting on the top\nof a hill. And he spoke to him: \"Man of\nGod, the king has said, \"Come down!\"'\nSo Elijah answered and said to the\ncaptain of fifty, \"If I am a man of God,\nthen let fire come down from heaven\nand consume you and your fifty men.\"\nAnd fire came down from heaven and\nconsumed him and his fifty.\nThen he sent to him another captain of\nfifty with his fifty men. And he answered\nand said to him: \"Man of God, thus has\nthe king said, \"Come down quickly!\"'\nSo Elijah answered and said to them,\n\"If I am a man of God, let fire come\ndown from heaven and consume you\nand your fifty men.\" And the fire of God\ncame down from heaven and consumed\nhim and his fifty.\nAgain, he sent a third captain of fifty\nwith his fifty men. And the third captain\nof fifty went up, and came and fell on his\nknees before Elijah, and pleaded with\nhim, and said to him: \"Man of God,\nplease let my life and the life of these\nfifty servants of yours be precious in\nyour sight.\nlives, and as your soul lives, I will not\nleave you!\" So they went down to Bethel.\nLook, fire has come down from heaven\nand burned up the first two captains of\nfifties with their fifties. But let my life now\nbe precious in your sight.\"\nAnd the angel of the LORD said to\nElijah, \"Go down with him; do not be\nafraid of him.\" So he arose and went\ndown with him to the king.\nThen he said to him, \"Thus says the\nLORD: \"Because you have sent\nmessengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub,\nthe god of Ekron, is it because there is\nno God in Israel to inquire of His word?\nTherefore you shall not come down from\nthe bed to which you have gone up, but\nyou shall surely die.\"'\nNow the sons of the prophets who were\nat Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to\nhim, \"Do you know that the LORD will\ntake away your master from over you\ntoday?\" And he said, \"Yes, I know; keep\nsilent!\"\nThen Elijah said to him, \"Elisha, stay\nhere, please, for the LORD has sent me\non to Jericho.\" But he said, \"As the\nLORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will\nnot leave you!\" So they came to Jericho.\nNow the sons of the prophets who were\nat Jericho came to Elisha and said to\nhim, \"Do you know that the LORD will\ntake away your master from over you\ntoday?\" So he answered, \"Yes, I know;\nkeep silent!\"\nSo Ahaziah died according to the word\nof the LORD which Elijah had spoken.\nBecause he had no son, Jehoram\nbecame king in his place, in the second\nyear of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat,\nking of Judah.\nThen Elijah said to him, \"Stay here,\nplease, for the LORD has sent me on to\nthe Jordan.\" But he said, \"As the LORD\nlives, and as your soul lives, I will not\nleave you!\" So the two of them went on.\nNow the rest of the acts of Ahaziah\nwhich he did, are they not written in the\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of\nIsrael?\nAnd fifty men of the sons of the\nprophets went and stood facing them at\na distance, while the two of them stood\nby the Jordan.\n2And it came to pass, when the LORD\nwas about to take up Elijah into heaven\nby a whirlwind, that Elijah went with\nElisha from Gilgal.\nThen Elijah said to Elisha, \"Stay here,\nplease, for the LORD has sent me on to\nBethel.\" But Elisha said, \"As the LORD\nNow Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up,\nand struck the water; and it was divided\nthis way and that, so that the two of\nthem crossed over on dry ground.\nAnd so it was, when they had crossed\nover, that Elijah said to Elisha, \"Ask!\nWhat may I do for you, before I am\ntaken away from you?\" Elisha said,\n\"Please let a double portion of your spirit\nbe upon me.\"\nvalley.\" And he said, \"You shall not send\nanyone.\"\nSo he said, \"You have asked a hard\nthing. Nevertheless, if you see me when\nI am taken from you, it shall be so for\nyou; but if not, it shall not be so.\"\nBut when they urged him till he was\nashamed, he said, \"Send them!\"\nTherefore they sent fifty men, and they\nsearched for three days but did not find\nhim.\nThen it happened, as they continued\non and talked, that suddenly a chariot of\nfire appeared with horses of fire, and\nseparated the two of them; and Elijah\nwent up by a whirlwind into heaven.\nAnd when they came back to him, for\nhe had stayed in Jericho, he said to\nthem, \"Did I not say to you, \"Do not\ngo'?\"\nAnd Elisha saw it, and he cried out,\n\"My father, my father, the chariot of\nIsrael and its horsemen!\" So he saw him\nno more. And he took hold of his own\nclothes and tore them into two pieces.\nThen the men of the city said to Elisha,\n\"Please notice, the situation of this city\nis pleasant, as my lord sees; but the\nwater is bad, and the ground barren.\"\nHe also took up the mantle of Elijah\nthat had fallen from him, and went back\nand stood by the bank of the Jordan.\nAnd he said, \"Bring me a new bowl,\nand put salt in it.\" So they brought it to\nhim.\nThen he took the mantle of Elijah that\nhad fallen from him, and struck the\nwater, and said, \"Where is the LORD\nGod of Elijah?\" And when he also had\nstruck the water, it was divided this way\nand that; and Elisha crossed over.\nNow when the sons of the prophets\nwho were from Jericho saw him, they\nsaid, \"The spirit of Elijah rests on\nElisha.\" And they came to meet him,\nand bowed to the ground before him.\nThen they said to him, \"Look now,\nthere are fifty strong men with your\nservants. Please let them go and search\nfor your master, lest perhaps the Spirit\nof the LORD has taken him up and cast\nhim upon some mountain or into some\nThen he went out to the source of the\nwater, and cast in the salt there, and\nsaid, \"Thus says the LORD: \"I have\nhealed this water; from it there shall be\nno more death or barrenness.\"'\nSo the water remains healed to this\nday, according to the word of Elisha\nwhich he spoke.\nThen he went up from there to Bethel;\nand as he was going up the road, some\nyouths came from the city and mocked\nhim, and said to him, \"Go up, you\nbaldhead! Go up, you baldhead!\"\nSo he turned around and looked at\nthem, and pronounced a curse on them\nin the name of the LORD. And two\nfemale bears came out of the woods\nand mauled forty-two of the youths.\nThen he said, \"Which way shall we go\nup?\" And he answered, \"By way of the\nWilderness of Edom.\"\nThen he went from there to Mount\nCarmel, and from there he returned to\nSamaria.\n3Now Jehoram the son of Ahab\nbecame king over Israel at Samaria in\nthe eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king\nof Judah, and reigned twelve years.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the LORD,\nbut not like his father and mother; for he\nput away the sacred pillar of Baal that\nhis father had made.\nNevertheless he persisted in the sins of\nJeroboam the son of Nebat, who had\nmade Israel sin; he did not depart from\nthem.\nNow Mesha king of Moab was a\nsheepbreeder, and he regularly paid the\nking of Israel one hundred thousand\nlambs and the wool of one hundred\nthousand rams.\nSo the king of Israel went with the king\nof Judah and the king of Edom, and they\nmarched on that roundabout route\nseven days; and there was no water for\nthe army, nor for the animals that\nfollowed them.\nAnd the king of Israel said, \"Alas! For\nthe LORD has called these three kings\ntogether to deliver them into the hand of\nMoab.\"\nBut Jehoshaphat said, \"Is there no\nprophet of the LORD here, that we may\ninquire of the LORD by him?\" So one of\nthe servants of the king of Israel\nanswered and said, \"Elisha the son of\nShaphat is here, who poured water on\nthe hands of Elijah.\"\nAnd Jehoshaphat said, \"The word of\nthe LORD is with him.\" So the king of\nIsrael and Jehoshaphat and the king of\nEdom went down to him.\nSo King Jehoram went out of Samaria\nat that time and mustered all Israel.\nThen Elisha said to the king of Israel,\n\"What have I to do with you? Go to the\nprophets of your father and the prophets\nof your mother.\" But the king of Israel\nsaid to him, \"No, for the LORD has\ncalled these three kings together to\ndeliver them into the hand of Moab.\"\nBut it happened, when Ahab died, that\nthe king of Moab rebelled against the\nking of Israel.\nThen he went and sent to Jehoshaphat\nking of Judah, saying, \"The king of\nMoab has rebelled against me. Will you\ngo with me to fight against Moab?\" And\nhe said, \"I will go up; I am as you are,\nmy people as your people, my horses as\nyour horses.\"\nAnd Elisha said, \"As the LORD of\nhosts lives, before whom I stand, surely\nwere it not that I regard the presence of\nJehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not\nlook at you, nor see you.\nBut now bring me a musician.\" Then it\nhappened, when the musician played,\nthat the hand of the LORD came upon\nhim.\nAnd he said, \"Thus says the LORD:\n\"Make this valley full of ditches.'\nkilled one another; now therefore, Moab,\nto the spoil!\"\nSo when they came to the camp of\nIsrael, Israel rose up and attacked the\nMoabites, so that they fled before them;\nand they entered their land, killing the\nMoabites.\nFor thus says the LORD: \"You shall\nnot see wind, nor shall you see rain; yet\nthat valley shall be filled with water, so\nthat you, your cattle, and your animals\nmay drink.'\nAnd this is a simple matter in the sight\nof the LORD; He will also deliver the\nMoabites into your hand.\nThen they destroyed the cities, and\neach man threw a stone on every good\npiece of land and filled it; and they\nstopped up all the springs of water and\ncut down all the good trees. But they left\nthe stones of Kir Haraseth intact.\nHowever the slingers surrounded and\nattacked it.\nAlso you shall attack every fortified city\nand every choice city, and shall cut\ndown every good tree, and stop up\nevery spring of water, and ruin every\ngood piece of land with stones.\"\nAnd when the king of Moab saw that\nthe battle was too fierce for him, he took\nwith him seven hundred men who drew\nswords, to break through to the king of\nEdom, but they could not.\nNow it happened in the morning, when\nthe grain offering was offered, that\nsuddenly water came by way of Edom,\nand the land was filled with water.\nAnd when all the Moabites heard that\nthe kings had come up to fight against\nthem, all who were able to bear arms\nand older were gathered; and they stood\nat the border.\nThen he took his eldest son who would\nhave reigned in his place, and offered\nhim as a burnt offering upon the wall;\nand there was great indignation against\nIsrael. So they departed from him and\nreturned to their own land.\n4A certain woman of the wives of the\nThen they rose up early in the morning,\nand the sun was shining on the water;\nand the Moabites saw the water on the\nother side as red as blood.\nsons of the prophets cried out to Elisha,\nsaying, \"Your servant my husband is\ndead, and you know that your servant\nfeared the LORD. And the creditor is\ncoming to take my two sons to be his\nslaves.\"\nAnd they said, \"This is blood; the kings\nhave surely struck swords and have\nSo Elisha said to her, \"What shall I do\nfor you? Tell me, what do you have in\nthe house?\" And she said, \"Your\nmaidservant has nothing in the house\nbut a jar of oil.\"\nand a lampstand; so it will be, whenever\nhe comes to us, he can turn in there.\"\nThen he said, \"Go, borrow vessels from\neverywhere, from all your neighbors-empty vessels; do not gather just a few.\nAnd it happened one day that he came\nthere, and he turned in to the upper\nroom and lay down there.\nAnd when you have come in, you shall\nshut the door behind you and your sons;\nthen pour it into all those vessels, and\nset aside the full ones.\"\nThen he said to Gehazi his servant,\n\"Call this Shunammite woman.\" When\nhe had called her, she stood before him.\nSo she went from him and shut the\ndoor behind her and her sons, who\nbrought the vessels to her; and she\npoured it out.\nNow it came to pass, when the vessels\nwere full, that she said to her son, \"Bring\nme another vessel.\" And he said to her,\n\"There is not another vessel.\" So the oil\nceased.\nAnd he said to him, \"Say now to her,\n\"Look, you have been concerned for us\nwith all this care. What can I do for you?\nDo you want me to speak on your behalf\nto the king or to the commander of the\narmy?\"' She answered, \"I dwell among\nmy own people.\"\nSo he said, \"What then is to be done\nfor her?\" And Gehazi answered,\n\"Actually, she has no son, and her\nhusband is old.\"\nThen she came and told the man of\nGod. And he said, \"Go, sell the oil and\npay your debt; and you and your sons\nlive on the rest.\"\nSo he said, \"Call her.\" When he had\ncalled her, she stood in the doorway.\nNow it happened one day that Elisha\nwent to Shunem, where there was a\nnotable woman, and she persuaded him\nto eat some food. So it was, as often as\nhe passed by, he would turn in there to\neat some food.\nAnd she said to her husband, \"Look\nnow, I know that this is a holy man of\nGod, who passes by us regularly.\nPlease, let us make a small upper\nroom on the wall; and let us put a bed\nfor him there, and a table and a chair\nThen he said, \"About this time next\nyear you shall embrace a son.\" And she\nsaid, \"No, my lord. Man of God, do not\nlie to your maidservant!\"\nBut the woman conceived, and bore a\nson when the appointed time had come,\nof which Elisha had told her.\nAnd the child grew. Now it happened\none day that he went out to his father, to\nthe reapers.\nAnd he said to his father, \"My head,\nmy head!\" So he said to a servant,\n\"Carry him to his mother.\"\nWhen he had taken him and brought\nhim to his mother, he sat on her knees\ntill noon, and then died.\nSo she said, \"Did I ask a son of my\nlord? Did I not say, \"Do not deceive\nme'?\"\nAnd she went up and laid him on the\nbed of the man of God, shut the door\nupon him, and went out.\nThen she called to her husband, and\nsaid, \"Please send me one of the young\nmen and one of the donkeys, that I may\nrun to the man of God and come back.\"\nSo he said, \"Why are you going to him\ntoday? It is neither the New Moon nor\nthe Sabbath.\" And she said, \"It is well.\"\nThen she saddled a donkey, and said\nto her servant, \"Drive, and go forward;\ndo not slacken the pace for me unless I\ntell you.\"\nThen he said to Gehazi, \"Get yourself\nready, and take my staff in your hand,\nand be on your way. If you meet anyone,\ndo not greet him; and if anyone greets\nyou, do not answer him; but lay my staff\non the face of the child.\"\nAnd the mother of the child said, \"As\nthe LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I\nwill not leave you.\" So he arose and\nfollowed her.\nNow Gehazi went on ahead of them,\nand laid the staff on the face of the child;\nbut there was neither voice nor hearing.\nTherefore he went back to meet him,\nand told him, saying, \"The child has not\nawakened.\"\nAnd so she departed, and went to the\nman of God at Mount Carmel. So it was,\nwhen the man of God saw her afar off,\nthat he said to his servant Gehazi, \"Look,\nthe Shunammite woman!\nWhen Elisha came into the house,\nthere was the child, lying dead on his\nbed.\nHe went in therefore, shut the door\nbehind the two of them, and prayed to\nthe LORD.\nPlease run now to meet her, and say\nto her, \"Is it well with you? Is it well with\nyour husband? Is it well with the child?\"'\nAnd she answered, \"It is well.\"\nNow when she came to the man of\nGod at the hill, she caught him by the\nfeet, but Gehazi came near to push her\naway. But the man of God said, \"Let her\nalone; for her soul is in deep distress,\nand the LORD has hidden it from me,\nand has not told me.\"\nAnd he went up and lay on the child,\nand put his mouth on his mouth, his\neyes on his eyes, and his hands on his\nhands; and he stretched himself out on\nthe child, and the flesh of the child\nbecame warm.\nHe returned and walked back and forth\nin the house, and again went up and\nstretched himself out on him; then the\nchild sneezed seven times, and the child\nopened his eyes.\nAnd he called Gehazi and said, \"Call\nthis Shunammite woman.\" So he called\nher. And when she came in to him, he\nsaid, \"Pick up your son.\"\nBut his servant said, \"What? Shall I set\nthis before one hundred men?\" He said\nagain, \"Give it to the people, that they\nmay eat; for thus says the LORD: \"They\nshall eat and have some left over.\"'\nSo she went in, fell at his feet, and\nbowed to the ground; then she picked\nup her son and went out.\nSo he set it before them; and they ate\nand had some left over, according to the\nword of the LORD.\nAnd Elisha returned to Gilgal, and\nthere was a famine in the land. Now the\nsons of the prophets were sitting before\nhim; and he said to his servant, \"Put on\nthe large pot, and boil stew for the sons\nof the prophets.\"\nSo one went out into the field to gather\nherbs, and found a wild vine, and\ngathered from it a lapful of wild gourds,\nand came and sliced them into the pot\nof stew, though they did not know what\nthey were.\nThen they served it to the men to eat.\nNow it happened, as they were eating\nthe stew, that they cried out and said,\n\"Man of God, there is death in the pot!\"\nAnd they could not eat it.\nSo he said, \"Then bring some flour.\"\nAnd he put it into the pot, and said,\n\"Serve it to the people, that they may\neat.\" And there was nothing harmful in\nthe pot.\nThen a man came from Baal Shalisha,\nand brought the man of God bread of\nthe firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley\nbread, and newly ripened grain in his\nknapsack. And he said, \"Give it to the\npeople, that they may eat.\"\n5Now Naaman, commander of the\narmy of the king of Syria, was a great\nand honorable man in the eyes of his\nmaster, because by him the LORD had\ngiven victory to Syria. He was also a\nmighty man of valor, but a leper.\nAnd the Syrians had gone out on raids,\nand had brought back captive a young\ngirl from the land of Israel. She waited\non Naaman's wife.\nThen she said to her mistress, \"If only\nmy master were with the prophet who is\nin Samaria! For he would heal him of his\nleprosy.\"\nAnd Naaman went in and told his\nmaster, saying, \"Thus and thus said the\ngirl who is from the land of Israel.\"\nThen the king of Syria said, \"Go now,\nand I will send a letter to the king of\nIsrael.\" So he departed and took with\nhim ten talents of silver, six thousand\nshekels of gold, and ten changes of\nclothing.\nThen he brought the letter to the king of\nIsrael, which said, 4 Now be advised,\nwhen this letter comes to you, that I\nhave sent Naaman my servant to you,\nthat you may heal him of his leprosy.\ngreat, would you not have done it? How\nmuch more then, when he says to you,\n\"Wash, and be clean'?\"\nAnd it happened, when the king of\nIsrael read the letter, that he tore his\nclothes and said, \"Am I God, to kill and\nmake alive, that this man sends a man\nto me to heal him of his leprosy?\nTherefore please consider, and see how\nhe seeks a quarrel with me.\"\nSo he went down and dipped seven\ntimes in the Jordan, according to the\nsaying of the man of God; and his flesh\nwas restored like the flesh of a little child,\nand he was clean.\nSo it was, when Elisha the man of God\nheard that the king of Israel had torn his\nclothes, that he sent to the king, saying,\n\"Why have you torn your clothes?\nPlease let him come to me, and he shall\nknow that there is a prophet in Israel.\"\nAnd he returned to the man of God, he\nand all his aides, and came and stood\nbefore him; and he said, \"Indeed, now I\nknow that there is no God in all the earth,\nexcept in Israel; now therefore, please\ntake a gift from your servant.\"\nThen Naaman went with his horses and\nchariot, and he stood at the door of\nElisha's house.\nBut he said, \"As the LORD lives,\nbefore whom I stand, I will receive\nnothing.\" And he urged him to take it,\nbut he refused.\nAnd Elisha sent a messenger to him,\nsaying, \"Go and wash in the Jordan\nseven times, and your flesh shall be\nrestored to you, and you shall be clean.\"\nSo Naaman said, \"Then, if not, please\nlet your servant be given two mule-loads\nof earth; for your servant will no longer\noffer either burnt offering or sacrifice to\nother gods, but to the LORD.\nBut Naaman became furious, and\nwent away and said, \"Indeed, I said to\nmyself, \"He will surely come out to me,\nand stand and call on the name of the\nLORD his God, and wave his hand over\nthe place, and heal the leprosy.'\nAre not the Abanah and the Pharpar,\nthe rivers of Damascus, better than all\nthe waters of Israel? Could I not wash in\nthem and be clean?\" So he turned and\nwent away in a rage.\nAnd his servants came near and\nspoke to him, and said, \"My father, if the\nprophet had told you to do something\nYet in this thing may the LORD pardon\nyour servant: when my master goes into\nthe temple of Rimmon to worship there,\nand he leans on my hand, and I bow\ndown in the temple of Rimmon--when I\nbow down in the temple of Rimmon,\nmay the LORD please pardon your\nservant in this thing.\"\nThen he said to him, \"Go in peace.\" So\nhe departed from him a short distance.\nBut Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the\nman of God, said, \"Look, my master has\nspared Naaman this Syrian, while not\nreceiving from his hands what he\nbrought; but as the LORD lives, I will run\nafter him and take something from him.\"\nSo Gehazi pursued Naaman. When\nNaaman saw him running after him, he\ngot down from the chariot to meet him,\nand said, \"Is all well?\"\nAnd he said, \"All is well. My master\nhas sent me, saying, \"Indeed, just now\ntwo young men of the sons of the\nprophets have come to me from the\nmountains of Ephraim. Please give them\na talent of silver and two changes of\ngarments.\"'\nSo Naaman said, \"Please, take two\ntalents.\" And he urged him, and bound\ntwo talents of silver in two bags, with\ntwo changes of garments, and handed\nthem to two of his servants; and they\ncarried them on ahead of him.\nWhen he came to the citadel, he took\nthem from their hand, and stored them\naway in the house; then he let the men\ngo, and they departed.\nNow he went in and stood before his\nmaster. Elisha said to him, \"Where did\nyou go, Gehazi?\" And he said, \"Your\nservant did not go anywhere.\"\nforever.\" And he went out from his\npresence leprous, as white as snow.\n6And the sons of the prophets said to\nElisha, \"See now, the place where we\ndwell with you is too small for us.\nPlease, let us go to the Jordan, and let\nevery man take a beam from there, and\nlet us make there a place where we may\ndwell.\" So he answered, \"Go.\"\nThen one said, \"Please consent to go\nwith your servants.\" And he answered, \"I\nwill go.\"\nSo he went with them. And when they\ncame to the Jordan, they cut down trees.\nBut as one was cutting down a tree, the\niron ax head fell into the water; and he\ncried out and said, \"Alas, master! For it\nwas borrowed.\"\nSo the man of God said, \"Where did it\nfall?\" And he showed him the place. So\nhe cut off a stick, and threw it in there;\nand he made the iron float.\nTherefore he said, \"Pick it up for\nyourself.\" So he reached out his hand\nand took it.\nThen he said to him, \"Did not my heart\ngo with you when the man turned back\nfrom his chariot to meet you? Is it time\nto receive money and to receive clothing,\nolive groves and vineyards, sheep and\noxen, male and female servants?\nTherefore the leprosy of Naaman shall\ncling to you and your descendants\nNow the king of Syria was making war\nagainst Israel; and he consulted with his\nservants, saying, \"My camp will be in\nsuch and such a place.\"\nAnd the man of God sent to the king of\nIsrael, saying, \"Beware that you do not\npass this place, for the Syrians are\ncoming down there.\"\nThen the king of Israel sent someone\nto the place of which the man of God\nhad told him. Thus he warned him, and\nhe was watchful there, not just once or\ntwice.\nTherefore the heart of the king of Syria\nwas greatly troubled by this thing; and\nhe called his servants and said to them,\n\"Will you not show me which of us is for\nthe king of Israel?\"\nAnd one of his servants said, \"None,\nmy lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet\nwho is in Israel, tells the king of Israel\nthe words that you speak in your\nbedroom.\"\nSo he said, \"Go and see where he is,\nthat I may send and get him.\" And it was\ntold him, saying, \"Surely he is in\nDothan.\"\nthe mountain was full of horses and\nchariots of fire all around Elisha.\nSo when the Syrians came down to\nhim, Elisha prayed to the LORD, and\nsaid, \"Strike this people, I pray, with\nblindness.\" And He struck them with\nblindness according to the word of\nElisha.\nNow Elisha said to them, \"This is not\nthe way, nor is this the city. Follow me,\nand I will bring you to the man whom\nyou seek.\" But he led them to Samaria.\nSo it was, when they had come to\nSamaria, that Elisha said, \"LORD, open\nthe eyes of these men, that they may\nsee.\" And the LORD opened their eyes,\nand they saw; and there they were,\ninside Samaria!\nTherefore he sent horses and chariots\nand a great army there, and they came\nby night and surrounded the city.\nNow when the king of Israel saw them,\nhe said to Elisha, \"My father, shall I kill\nthem? Shall I kill them?\"\nAnd when the servant of the man of\nGod arose early and went out, there\nwas an army, surrounding the city with\nhorses and chariots. And his servant\nsaid to him, \"Alas, my master! What\nshall we do?\"\nBut he answered, \"You shall not kill\nthem. Would you kill those whom you\nhave taken captive with your sword and\nyour bow? Set food and water before\nthem, that they may eat and drink and\ngo to their master.\"\nSo he answered, \"Do not fear, for\nthose who are with us are more than\nthose who are with them.\"\nThen he prepared a great feast for\nthem; and after they ate and drank, he\nsent them away and they went to their\nmaster. So the bands of Syrian raiders\ncame no more into the land of Israel.\nAnd Elisha prayed, and said, \"LORD, I\npray, open his eyes that he may see.\"\nThen the LORD opened the eyes of the\nyoung man, and he saw. And behold,\nAnd it happened after this that BenHadad king of Syria gathered all his\narmy, and went up and besieged\nSamaria.\nAnd there was a great famine in\nSamaria; and indeed they besieged it\nuntil a donkey's head was sold for eighty\nshekels of silver, and one-fourth of a\nkab of dove droppings for five shekels of\nsilver.\nsaid to the elders, \"Do you see how this\nson of a murderer has sent someone to\ntake away my head? Look, when the\nmessenger comes, shut the door, and\nhold him fast at the door. Is not the\nsound of his master's feet behind him?\"\nThen, as the king of Israel was\npassing by on the wall, a woman cried\nout to him, saying, \"Help, my lord, O\nking!\"\nAnd while he was still talking with them,\nthere was the messenger, coming down\nto him; and then the king said, \"Surely\nthis calamity is from the LORD; why\nshould I wait for the LORD any longer?\"\nAnd he said, \"If the LORD does not\nhelp you, where can I find help for you?\nFrom the threshing floor or from the\nwinepress?\"\nThen the king said to her, \"What is\ntroubling you?\" And she answered, \"This\nwoman said to me, \"Give your son, that\nwe may eat him today, and we will eat\nmy son tomorrow.'\nSo we boiled my son, and ate him.\nAnd I said to her on the next day, \"Give\nyour son, that we may eat him'; but she\nhas hidden her son.\"\nNow it happened, when the king heard\nthe words of the woman, that he tore his\nclothes; and as he passed by on the\nwall, the people looked, and there\nunderneath he had sackcloth on his\nbody.\n7Then Elisha said, \"Hear the word of\nthe LORD. Thus says the LORD:\n\"Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine\nflour shall be sold for a shekel, and two\nseahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate\nof Samaria.\"'\nSo an officer on whose hand the king\nleaned answered the man of God and\nsaid, \"Look, if the LORD would make\nwindows in heaven, could this thing be?\"\nAnd he said, \"In fact, you shall see it\nwith your eyes, but you shall not eat of\nit.\"\nNow there were four leprous men at the\nentrance of the gate; and they said to\none another, \"Why are we sitting here\nuntil we die?\nThen he said, \"God do so to me and\nmore also, if the head of Elisha the son\nof Shaphat remains on him today!\"\nBut Elisha was sitting in his house,\nand the elders were sitting with him. And\nthe king sent a man ahead of him, but\nbefore the messenger came to him, he\nIf we say, \"We will enter the city,' the\nfamine is in the city, and we shall die\nthere. And if we sit here, we die also.\nNow therefore, come, let us surrender to\nthe army of the Syrians. If they keep us\nalive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we\nshall only die.\"\nAnd they rose at twilight to go to the\ncamp of the Syrians; and when they had\ncome to the outskirts of the Syrian camp,\nto their surprise no one was there.\nFor the LORD had caused the army of\nthe Syrians to hear the noise of chariots\nand the noise of horses--the noise of a\ngreat army; so they said to one another,\n\"Look, the king of Israel has hired\nagainst us the kings of the Hittites and\nthe kings of the Egyptians to attack us!\"\nTherefore they arose and fled at twilight,\nand left the camp intact--their tents, their\nhorses, and their donkeys--and they fled\nfor their lives.\nSo the king arose in the night and said\nto his servants, \"Let me now tell you\nwhat the Syrians have done to us. They\nknow that we are hungry; therefore they\nhave gone out of the camp to hide\nthemselves in the field, saying, \"When\nthey come out of the city, we shall catch\nthem alive, and get into the city.\"'\nAnd one of his servants answered and\nsaid, \"Please, let several men take five\nof the remaining horses which are left in\nthe city. Look, they may either become\nlike all the multitude of Israel that are left\nin it; or indeed, I say, they may become\nlike all the multitude of Israel left from\nthose who are consumed; so let us send\nthem and see.\"\nAnd when these lepers came to the\noutskirts of the camp, they went into one\ntent and ate and drank, and carried from\nit silver and gold and clothing, and went\nand hid them; then they came back and\nentered another tent, and carried some\nfrom there also, and went and hid it.\nThen they said to one another, \"We are\nnot doing right. This day is a day of\ngood news, and we remain silent. If we\nwait\nuntil\nmorning\nlight,\nsome\npunishment will come upon us. Now\ntherefore, come, let us go and tell the\nking's household.\"\nSo they went and called to the\ngatekeepers of the city, and told them,\nsaying, \"We went to the Syrian camp,\nand surprisingly no one was there, not a\nhuman sound--only horses and donkeys\ntied, and the tents intact.\"\nAnd the gatekeepers called out, and\nthey told it to the king's household inside.\nTherefore they took two chariots with\nhorses; and the king sent them in the\ndirection of the Syrian army, saying, \"Go\nand see.\"\nAnd they went after them to the\nJordan; and indeed all the road was full\nof garments and weapons which the\nSyrians had thrown away in their haste.\nSo the messengers returned and told\nthe king.\nThen the people went out and\nplundered the tents of the Syrians. So a\nseah of fine flour was sold for a shekel,\nand two seahs of barley for a shekel,\naccording to the word of the LORD.\nNow the king had appointed the officer\non whose hand he leaned to have\ncharge of the gate. But the people\ntrampled him in the gate, and he died,\njust as the man of God had said, who\nspoke when the king came down to him.\nSo it happened just as the man of God\nhad spoken to the king, saying, \"Two\nseahs of barley for a shekel, and a seah\nof fine flour for a shekel, shall be sold\ntomorrow about this time in the gate of\nSamaria.\"\nThen that officer had answered the\nman of God, and said, \"Now look, if the\nLORD would make windows in heaven,\ncould such a thing be?\" And he had said,\n\"In fact, you shall see it with your eyes,\nbut you shall not eat of it.\"\nAnd so it happened to him, for the\npeople trampled him in the gate, and he\ndied.\n8Then Elisha spoke to the woman\nwhose son he had restored to life,\nsaying, \"Arise and go, you and your\nhousehold, and stay wherever you can;\nfor the LORD has called for a famine,\nand furthermore, it will come upon the\nland for seven years.\"\nSo the woman arose and did according\nto the saying of the man of God, and\nshe went with her household and dwelt\nin the land of the Philistines seven years.\nIt came to pass, at the end of seven\nyears, that the woman returned from the\nland of the Philistines; and she went to\nmake an appeal to the king for her\nhouse and for her land.\nThen the king talked with Gehazi, the\nservant of the man of God, saying, \"Tell\nme, please, all the great things Elisha\nhas done.\"\nNow it happened, as he was telling the\nking how he had restored the dead to\nlife, that there was the woman whose\nson he had restored to life, appealing to\nthe king for her house and for her land.\nAnd Gehazi said, \"My lord, O king, this\nis the woman, and this is her son whom\nElisha restored to life.\"\nAnd when the king asked the woman,\nshe told him. So the king appointed a\ncertain officer for her, saying, \"Restore\nall that was hers, and all the proceeds of\nthe field from the day that she left the\nland until now.\"\nThen Elisha went to Damascus, and\nBen-Hadad king of Syria was sick; and it\nwas told him, saying, \"The man of God\nhas come here.\"\nAnd the king said to Hazael, \"Take a\npresent in your hand, and go to meet\nthe man of God, and inquire of the\nLORD by him, saying, \"Shall I recover\nfrom this disease?\"'\nSo Hazael went to meet him and took a\npresent with him, of every good thing of\nDamascus, forty camel-loads; and he\ncame and stood before him, and said,\n\"Your son Ben-Hadad king of Syria has\nsent me to you, saying, \"Shall I recover\nfrom this disease?\"'\nAnd Elisha said to him, \"Go, say to him,\n\"You shall certainly recover.' However\nthe LORD has shown me that he will\nreally die.\"\nThen he set his countenance in a stare\nuntil he was ashamed; and the man of\nGod wept.\nAnd Hazael said, \"Why is my lord\nweeping?\" He answered, \"Because I\nknow the evil that you will do to the\nchildren of Israel: Their strongholds you\nwill set on fire, and their young men you\nwill kill with the sword; and you will dash\ntheir children, and rip open their women\nwith child.\"\nYet the LORD would not destroy\nJudah, for the sake of His servant David,\nas He promised him to give a lamp to\nhim and his sons forever.\nSo Hazael said, \"But what is your\nservant--a dog, that he should do this\ngross thing?\" And Elisha answered,\n\"The LORD has shown me that you will\nbecome king over Syria.\"\nThen he departed from Elisha, and\ncame to his master, who said to him,\n\"What did Elisha say to you?\" And he\nanswered, \"He told me you would surely\nrecover.\"\nIn his days Edom revolted against\nJudah's authority, and made a king over\nthemselves.\nSo Joram went to Zair, and all his\nchariots with him. Then he rose by night\nand attacked the Edomites who had\nsurrounded him and the captains of the\nchariots; and the troops fled to their\ntents.\nThus Edom has been in revolt against\nJudah's authority to this day. And Libnah\nrevolted at that time.\nBut it happened on the next day that\nhe took a thick cloth and dipped it in\nwater, and spread it over his face so\nthat he died; and Hazael reigned in his\nplace.\nNow in the fifth year of Joram the son\nof Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoshaphat\nhaving been king of Judah, Jehoram the\nson of Jehoshaphat began to reign as\nking of Judah.\nHe was thirty-two years old when he\nbecame king, and he reigned eight\nyears in Jerusalem.\nAnd he walked in the way of the kings\nof Israel, just as the house of Ahab had\ndone, for the daughter of Ahab was his\nwife; and he did evil in the sight of the\nLORD.\nNow the rest of the acts of Joram, and\nall that he did, are they not written in the\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of\nJudah?\nSo Joram rested with his fathers, and\nwas buried with his fathers in the City of\nDavid. Then Ahaziah his son reigned in\nhis place.\nIn the twelfth year of Joram the son of\nAhab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of\nJehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.\nAhaziah was twenty-two years old\nwhen he became king, and he reigned\none year in Jerusalem. His mother's\nname was Athaliah the granddaughter\nof Omri, king of Israel.\nAnd he walked in the way of the house\nof Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the\nLORD, like the house of Ahab, for he\nwas the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.\nof us?\" And\nCommander.\"\nNow he went with Joram the son of\nAhab to war against Hazael king of\nSyria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians\nwounded Joram.\nhe\nsaid,\n\"For\nyou,\nThen he arose and went into the house.\nAnd he poured the oil on his head, and\nsaid to him, \"Thus says the LORD God\nof Israel: \"I have anointed you king over\nthe people of the LORD, over Israel.\nThen King Joram went back to Jezreel\nto recover from the wounds which the\nSyrians had inflicted on him at Ramah,\nwhen he fought against Hazael king of\nSyria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram,\nking of Judah, went down to see Joram\nthe son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he\nwas sick.\n9And Elisha the prophet called one of\nYou shall strike down the house of\nAhab your master, that I may avenge\nthe blood of My servants the prophets,\nand the blood of all the servants of the\nLORD, at the hand of Jezebel.\nFor the whole house of Ahab shall\nperish; and I will cut off from Ahab all\nthe males in Israel, both bond and free.\nthe sons of the prophets, and said to\nhim, \"Get yourself ready, take this flask\nof oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth\nGilead.\nSo I will make the house of Ahab like\nthe house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,\nand like the house of Baasha the son of\nAhijah.\nNow when you arrive at that place, look\nthere for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat,\nthe son of Nimshi, and go in and make\nhim rise up from among his associates,\nand take him to an inner room.\nThen take the flask of oil, and pour it on\nhis head, and say, \"Thus says the\nLORD: \"I have anointed you king over\nIsrael.\"' Then open the door and flee,\nand do not delay.\"\nSo the young man, the servant of the\nprophet, went to Ramoth Gilead.\nThe dogs shall eat Jezebel on the plot\nof ground at Jezreel, and there shall be\nnone to bury her.\"' And he opened the\ndoor and fled.\nThen Jehu came out to the servants of\nhis master, and one said to him, \"Is all\nwell? Why did this madman come to\nyou?\" And he said to them, \"You know\nthe man and his babble.\"\nAnd they said, \"A lie! Tell us now.\" So\nhe said, \"Thus and thus he spoke to me,\nsaying, \"Thus says the LORD: \"I have\nanointed you king over Israel.\"\"'\nAnd when he arrived, there were the\ncaptains of the army sitting; and he said,\n\"I\nhave\na\nmessage for\nyou,\nCommander.\" Jehu said, \"For which one\nThen each man hastened to take his\ngarment and put it under him on the top\nof the steps; and they blew trumpets,\nsaying, \"Jehu is king!\"\nSo Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the\nson of Nimshi, conspired against Joram.\n(Now Joram had been defending\nRamoth Gilead, he and all Israel,\nagainst Hazael king of Syria.\nBut King Joram had returned to\nJezreel to recover from the wounds\nwhich the Syrians had inflicted on him\nwhen he fought with Hazael king of\nSyria.) And Jehu said, \"If you are so\nminded, let no one leave or escape from\nthe city to go and tell it in Jezreel.\"\nSo Jehu rode in a chariot and went to\nJezreel, for Joram was laid up there;\nand Ahaziah king of Judah had come\ndown to see Joram.\nNow a watchman stood on the tower in\nJezreel, and he saw the company of\nJehu as he came, and said, \"I see a\ncompany of men.\" And Joram said, \"Get\na horseman and send him to meet them,\nand let him say, \"Is it peace?\"'\nSo the watchman reported, saying,\n\"He went up to them and is not coming\nback; and the driving is like the driving\nof Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives\nfuriously!\"\nThen Joram said, \"Make ready.\" And\nhis chariot was made ready. Then\nJoram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of\nJudah went out, each in his chariot; and\nthey went out to meet Jehu, and met\nhim on the property of Naboth the\nJezreelite.\nNow it happened, when Joram saw\nJehu, that he said, \"Is it peace, Jehu?\"\nSo he answered, \"What peace, as long\nas the harlotries of your mother Jezebel\nand her witchcraft are so many?\"\nThen Joram turned around and fled,\nand said to Ahaziah, \"Treachery,\nAhaziah!\"\nNow Jehu drew his bow with full\nstrength and shot Jehoram between his\narms; and the arrow came out at his\nheart, and he sank down in his chariot.\nSo the horseman went to meet him,\nand said, \"Thus says the king: \"Is it\npeace?\"' And Jehu said, \"What have\nyou to do with peace? Turn around and\nfollow me.\" So the watchman reported,\nsaying, \"The messenger went to them,\nbut is not coming back.\"\nThen Jehu said to Bidkar his captain,\n\"Pick him up, and throw him into the\ntract of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite;\nfor remember, when you and I were\nriding together behind Ahab his father,\nthat the LORD laid this burden upon\nhim:\nThen he sent out a second horseman\nwho came to them, and said, \"Thus says\nthe king: \"Is it peace?\"' And Jehu\nanswered, \"What have you to do with\npeace? Turn around and follow me.\"\n\"Surely I saw yesterday the blood of\nNaboth and the blood of his sons,' says\nthe LORD, \"and I will repay you in this\nplot,' says the LORD. Now therefore,\ntake and throw him on the plot of ground,\naccording to the word of the LORD.\"\nBut when Ahaziah king of Judah saw\nthis, he fled by the road to Beth Haggan.\nSo Jehu pursued him, and said, \"Shoot\nhim also in the chariot.\" And they shot\nhim at the Ascent of Gur, which is by\nIbleam. Then he fled to Megiddo, and\ndied there.\nTherefore they came back and told\nhim. And he said, \"This is the word of\nthe LORD, which He spoke by His\nservant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, \"On\nthe plot of ground at Jezreel dogs shall\neat the flesh of Jezebel;\nAnd his servants carried him in the\nchariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in\nhis tomb with his fathers in the City of\nDavid.\nIn the eleventh year of Joram the son\nof Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over\nJudah.\nNow when Jehu had come to Jezreel,\nJezebel heard of it; and she put paint on\nher eyes and adorned her head, and\nlooked through a window.\nThen, as Jehu entered at the gate, she\nsaid, \"Is it peace, Zimri, murderer of\nyour master?\"\nAnd he looked up at the window, and\nsaid, \"Who is on my side? Who?\" So\ntwo or three eunuchs looked out at him.\nThen he said, \"Throw her down.\" So\nthey threw her down, and some of her\nblood spattered on the wall and on the\nhorses; and he trampled her underfoot.\nand the corpse of Jezebel shall be as\nrefuse on the surface of the field, in the\nplot at Jezreel, so that they shall not say,\n\"Here lies Jezebel.\"\"'\n10Now Ahab had seventy sons in\nSamaria. And Jehu wrote and sent\nletters to Samaria, to the rulers of\nJezreel, to the elders, and to those who\nreared Ahab's sons, saying:\nNow as soon as this letter comes to\nyou, since your master's sons are with\nyou, and you have chariots and horses,\na fortified city also, and weapons,\nchoose the best qualified of your\nmaster's sons, set him on his father's\nthrone, and fight for your master's house.\nBut they were exceedingly afraid, and\nsaid, \"Look, two kings could not stand\nup to him; how then can we stand?\"\nAnd when he had gone in, he ate and\ndrank. Then he said, \"Go now, see to\nthis accursed woman, and bury her, for\nshe was a king's daughter.\"\nAnd he who was in charge of the house,\nand he who was in charge of the city,\nthe elders also, and those who reared\nthe sons, sent to Jehu, saying, \"We are\nyour servants, we will do all you tell us;\nbut we will not make anyone king. Do\nwhat is good in your sight.\"\nSo they went to bury her, but they\nfound no more of her than the skull and\nthe feet and the palms of her hands.\nThen he wrote a second letter to them,\nsaying: 4 If you are for me and will obey\nmy voice, take the heads of the men,\nyour master's sons, and come to me at\nJezreel by this time tomorrow. Now the\nking's sons, seventy persons, were with\nthe great men of the city, who were\nrearing them.\nSo it was, when the letter came to them,\nthat they took the king's sons and\nslaughtered seventy persons, put their\nheads in baskets and sent them to him\nat Jezreel.\nThen a messenger came and told him,\nsaying, \"They have brought the heads of\nthe king's sons.\" And he said, \"Lay them\nin two heaps at the entrance of the gate\nuntil morning.\"\nof Ahaziah; we have come down to\ngreet the sons of the king and the sons\nof the queen mother.\"\nAnd he said, \"Take them alive!\" So\nthey took them alive, and killed them at\nthe well of Beth Eked, forty-two men;\nand he left none of them.\nNow when he departed from there, he\nmet Jehonadab the son of Rechab,\ncoming to meet him; and he greeted him\nand said to him, \"Is your heart right, as\nmy heart is toward your heart?\" And\nJehonadab answered, \"It is.\" Jehu said,\n\"If it is, give me your hand.\" So he gave\nhim his hand, and he took him up to him\ninto the chariot.\nSo it was, in the morning, that he went\nout and stood, and said to all the people,\n\"You are righteous. Indeed I conspired\nagainst my master and killed him; but\nwho killed all these?\nThen he said, \"Come with me, and see\nmy zeal for the LORD.\" So they had him\nride in his chariot.\nKnow now that nothing shall fall to the\nearth of the word of the LORD which the\nLORD spoke concerning the house of\nAhab; for the LORD has done what He\nspoke by His servant Elijah.\"\nAnd when he came to Samaria, he\nkilled all who remained to Ahab in\nSamaria, till he had destroyed them,\naccording to the word of the LORD\nwhich He spoke to Elijah.\nSo Jehu killed all who remained of the\nhouse of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his\ngreat men and his close acquaintances\nand his priests, until he left him none\nremaining.\nAnd he arose and departed and went\nto Samaria. On the way, at Beth Eked of\nthe Shepherds,\nJehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah\nking of Judah, and said, \"Who are you?\"\nSo they answered, \"We are the brothers\nThen Jehu gathered all the people\ntogether, and said to them, \"Ahab\nserved Baal a little, Jehu will serve him\nmuch.\nNow therefore, call to me all the\nprophets of Baal, all his servants, and all\nhis priests. Let no one be missing, for I\nhave a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever\nis missing shall not live.\" But Jehu acted\ndeceptively, with the intent of destroying\nthe worshipers of Baal.\nAnd Jehu said, \"Proclaim a solemn\nassembly for Baal.\" So they proclaimed\nit.\nThen they broke down the sacred pillar\nof Baal, and tore down the temple of\nBaal and made it a refuse dump to this\nday.\nThen Jehu sent throughout all Israel;\nand all the worshipers of Baal came, so\nthat there was not a man left who did\nnot come. So they came into the temple\nof Baal, and the temple of Baal was full\nfrom one end to the other.\nAnd he said to the one in charge of the\nwardrobe, \"Bring out vestments for all\nthe worshipers of Baal.\" So he brought\nout vestments for them.\nThen Jehu and Jehonadab the son of\nRechab went into the temple of Baal,\nand said to the worshipers of Baal,\n\"Search and see that no servants of the\nLORD are here with you, but only the\nworshipers of Baal.\"\nSo they went in to offer sacrifices and\nburnt offerings. Now Jehu had\nappointed for himself eighty men on the\noutside, and had said, \"If any of the men\nwhom I have brought into your hands\nescapes, whoever lets him escape, it\nshall be his life for the life of the other.\"\nNow it happened, as soon as he had\nmade an end of offering the burnt\noffering, that Jehu said to the guard and\nto the captains, \"Go in and kill them; let\nno one come out!\" And they killed them\nwith the edge of the sword; then the\nguards and the officers threw them out,\nand went into the inner room of the\ntemple of Baal.\nAnd they brought the sacred pillars out\nof the temple of Baal and burned them.\nThus Jehu destroyed Baal from Israel.\nHowever Jehu did not turn away from\nthe sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,\nwho had made Israel sin, that is, from\nthe golden calves that were at Bethel\nand Dan.\nAnd the LORD said to Jehu, \"Because\nyou have done well in doing what is right\nin My sight, and have done to the house\nof Ahab all that was in My heart, your\nsons shall sit on the throne of Israel to\nthe fourth generation.\"\nBut Jehu took no heed to walk in the\nlaw of the LORD God of Israel with all\nhis heart; for he did not depart from the\nsins of Jeroboam, who had made Israel\nsin.\nIn those days the LORD began to cut\noff parts of Israel; and Hazael\nconquered them in all the territory of\nIsrael\nfrom the Jordan eastward: all the land\nof\nGilead--Gad,\nReuben,\nand\nManasseh--from Aroer, which is by the\nRiver Arnon, including Gilead and\nBashan.\nNow the rest of the acts of Jehu, all\nthat he did, and all his might, are they\nnot written in the book of the chronicles\nof the kings of Israel?\nSo Jehu rested with his fathers, and\nthey buried him in Samaria. Then\nJehoahaz his son reigned in his place.\nThe two contingents of you who go off\nduty on the Sabbath shall keep the\nwatch of the house of the LORD for the\nking.\nAnd the period that Jehu reigned over\nIsrael in Samaria was twenty-eight years.\n11When Athaliah the mother of\nAhaziah saw that her son was dead, she\narose and destroyed all the royal heirs.\nBut Jehosheba, the daughter of King\nJoram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the\nson of Ahaziah, and stole him away\nfrom among the king's sons who were\nbeing murdered; and they hid him and\nhis nurse in the bedroom, from Athaliah,\nso that he was not killed.\nSo he was hidden with her in the house\nof the LORD for six years, while Athaliah\nreigned over the land.\nIn the seventh year Jehoiada sent and\nbrought the captains of hundreds--of the\nbodyguards and the escorts--and\nbrought them into the house of the\nLORD to him. And he made a covenant\nwith them and took an oath from them in\nthe house of the LORD, and showed\nthem the king's son.\nThen he commanded them, saying,\n\"This is what you shall do: One-third of\nyou who come on duty on the Sabbath\nshall be keeping watch over the king's\nhouse,\none-third shall be at the gate of Sur,\nand one-third at the gate behind the\nescorts. You shall keep the watch of the\nhouse, lest it be broken down.\nBut you shall surround the king on all\nsides, every man with his weapons in\nhis hand; and whoever comes within\nrange, let him be put to death. You are\nto be with the king as he goes out and\nas he comes in.\"\nSo the captains of the hundreds did\naccording to all that Jehoiada the priest\ncommanded. Each of them took his men\nwho were to be on duty on the Sabbath,\nwith those who were going off duty on\nthe Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the\npriest.\nAnd the priest gave the captains of\nhundreds the spears and shields which\nhad belonged to King David, that were\nin the temple of the LORD.\nThen the escorts stood, every man\nwith his weapons in his hand, all around\nthe king, from the right side of the\ntemple to the left side of the temple, by\nthe altar and the house.\nAnd he brought out the king's son, put\nthe crown on him, and gave him the\nTestimony; they made him king and\nanointed him, and they clapped their\nhands and said, \"Long live the king!\"\nNow when Athaliah heard the noise of\nthe escorts and the people, she came to\nthe people in the temple of the LORD.\nWhen she looked, there was the king\nstanding by a pillar according to custom;\nand the leaders and the trumpeters\nwere by the king. All the people of the\nland were rejoicing and blowing\ntrumpets. So Athaliah tore her clothes\nand cried out, \"Treason! Treason!\"\nAnd Jehoiada the priest commanded\nthe captains of the hundreds, the\nofficers of the army, and said to them,\n\"Take her outside under guard, and slay\nwith the sword whoever follows her.\" For\nthe priest had said, \"Do not let her be\nkilled in the house of the LORD.\"\nSo they seized her; and she went by\nway of the horses' entrance into the\nking's house, and there she was killed.\nThen Jehoiada made a covenant\nbetween the LORD, the king, and the\npeople, that they should be the LORD's\npeople, and also between the king and\nthe people.\nAnd all the people of the land went to\nthe temple of Baal, and tore it down.\nThey thoroughly broke in pieces its\naltars and images, and killed Mattan the\npriest of Baal before the altars. And the\npriest appointed officers over the house\nof the LORD.\nThen he took the captains of hundreds,\nthe bodyguards, the escorts, and all the\npeople of the land; and they brought the\nking down from the house of the LORD,\nand went by way of the gate of the\nescorts to the king's house. Then he sat\non the throne of the kings.\nSo all the people of the land rejoiced;\nand the city was quiet, for they had slain\nAthaliah with the sword in the king's\nhouse.\nJehoash was seven years old when he\nbecame king.\n12In the seventh year of Jehu,\nJehoash became king, and he reigned\nforty years in Jerusalem. His mother's\nname was Zibiah of Beersheba.\nJehoash did what was right in the sight\nof the LORD all the days in which\nJehoiada the priest instructed him.\nBut the high places were not taken\naway; the people still sacrificed and\nburned incense on the high places.\nAnd Jehoash said to the priests, \"All\nthe money of the dedicated gifts that are\nbrought into the house of the LORD-each man's census money, each man's\nassessment money --and all the money\nthat a man purposes in his heart to bring\ninto the house of the LORD,\nlet the priests take it themselves, each\nfrom his constituency; and let them\nrepair the damages of the temple,\nwherever any dilapidation is found.\"\nNow it was so, by the twenty-third year\nof King Jehoash, that the priests had not\nrepaired the damages of the temple.\nSo King Jehoash called Jehoiada the\npriest and the other priests, and said to\nthem, \"Why have you not repaired the\ndamages of the temple? Now therefore,\ndo not take more money from your\nconstituency, but deliver it for repairing\nthe damages of the temple.\"\nAnd the priests agreed that they would\nneither receive more money from the\npeople, nor repair the damages of the\ntemple.\nMoreover they did not require an\naccount from the men into whose hand\nthey delivered the money to be paid to\nworkmen, for they dealt faithfully.\nThen Jehoiada the priest took a chest,\nbored a hole in its lid, and set it beside\nthe altar, on the right side as one comes\ninto the house of the LORD; and the\npriests who kept the door put there all\nthe money brought into the house of the\nLORD.\nSo it was, whenever they saw that\nthere was much money in the chest, that\nthe king's scribe and the high priest\ncame up and put it in bags, and counted\nthe money that was found in the house\nof the LORD.\nThen they gave the money, which had\nbeen apportioned, into the hands of\nthose who did the work, who had the\noversight of the house of the LORD; and\nthey paid it out to the carpenters and\nbuilders who worked on the house of the\nLORD,\nand to masons and stonecutters, and\nfor buying timber and hewn stone, to\nrepair the damage of the house of the\nLORD, and for all that was paid out to\nrepair the temple.\nHowever there were not made for the\nhouse of the LORD basins of silver,\ntrimmers, sprinkling-bowls, trumpets,\nany articles of gold or articles of silver,\nfrom the money brought into the house\nof the LORD.\nBut they gave that to the workmen,\nand they repaired the house of the\nLORD with it.\nThe money from the trespass offerings\nand the money from the sin offerings\nwas not brought into the house of the\nLORD. It belonged to the priests.\nHazael king of Syria went up and\nfought against Gath, and took it; then\nHazael set his face to go up to\nJerusalem.\nAnd Jehoash king of Judah took all the\nsacred\nthings\nthat\nhis\nfathers,\nJehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah,\nkings of Judah, had dedicated, and his\nown sacred things, and all the gold\nfound in the treasuries of the house of\nthe LORD and in the king's house, and\nsent them to Hazael king of Syria. Then\nhe went away from Jerusalem.\nNow the rest of the acts of Joash, and\nall that he did, are they not written in the\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of\nJudah?\nAnd his servants arose and formed a\nconspiracy, and killed Joash in the\nhouse of the Millo, which goes down to\nSilla.\nFor Jozachar the son of Shimeath and\nJehozabad the son of Shomer, his\nservants, struck him. So he died, and\nthey buried him with his fathers in the\nCity of David. Then Amaziah his son\nreigned in his place.\n13In the twenty-third year of Joash\nnot written in the book of the chronicles\nof the kings of Israel?\nthe son of Ahaziah, king of Judah,\nJehoahaz the son of Jehu became king\nover Israel in Samaria, and reigned\nseventeen years.\nSo Jehoahaz rested with his fathers,\nand they buried him in Samaria. Then\nJoash his son reigned in his place.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the LORD,\nand followed the sins of Jeroboam the\nson of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.\nHe did not depart from them.\nIn the thirty-seventh year of Joash king\nof Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz\nbecame king over Israel in Samaria, and\nreigned sixteen years.\nThen the anger of the LORD was\naroused against Israel, and He delivered\nthem into the hand of Hazael king of\nSyria, and into the hand of Ben-Hadad\nthe son of Hazael, all their days.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the\nLORD. He did not depart from all the\nsins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who\nmade Israel sin, but walked in them.\nSo Jehoahaz pleaded with the LORD,\nand the LORD listened to him; for He\nsaw the oppression of Israel, because\nthe king of Syria oppressed them.\nNow the rest of the acts of Joash, all\nthat he did, and his might with which he\nfought against Amaziah king of Judah,\nare they not written in the book of the\nchronicles of the kings of Israel?\nThen the LORD gave Israel a deliverer,\nso that they escaped from under the\nhand of the Syrians; and the children of\nIsrael dwelt in their tents as before.\nSo Joash rested with his fathers. Then\nJeroboam sat on his throne. And Joash\nwas buried in Samaria with the kings of\nIsrael.\nNevertheless they did not depart from\nthe sins of the house of Jeroboam, who\nhad made Israel sin, but walked in them;\nand the wooden image also remained in\nSamaria.\nElisha had become sick with the\nillness of which he would die. Then\nJoash the king of Israel came down to\nhim, and wept over his face, and said,\n\"O my father, my father, the chariots of\nIsrael and their horsemen!\"\nFor He left of the army of Jehoahaz\nonly fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and\nten thousand foot soldiers; for the king\nof Syria had destroyed them and made\nthem like the dust at threshing.\nNow the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz,\nall that he did, and his might, are they\nAnd Elisha said to him, \"Take a bow\nand some arrows.\" So he took himself a\nbow and some arrows.\nThen he said to the king of Israel, \"Put\nyour hand on the bow.\" So he put his\nhand on it, and Elisha put his hands on\nthe king's hands.\nAnd he said, \"Open the east window\";\nand he opened it. Then Elisha said,\n\"Shoot\"; and he shot. And he said, \"The\narrow of the LORD's deliverance and\nthe arrow of deliverance from Syria; for\nyou must strike the Syrians at Aphek till\nyou have destroyed them.\"\nThen he said, \"Take the arrows\"; so he\ntook them. And he said to the king of\nIsrael, \"Strike the ground\"; so he struck\nthree times, and stopped.\nAnd the man of God was angry with\nhim, and said, \"You should have struck\nfive or six times; then you would have\nstruck Syria till you had destroyed it! But\nnow you will strike Syria only three\ntimes.\"\nThen Elisha died, and they buried him.\nAnd the raiding bands from Moab\ninvaded the land in the spring of the\nyear.\nSo it was, as they were burying a man,\nthat suddenly they spied a band of\nraiders; and they put the man in the\ntomb of Elisha; and when the man was\nlet down and touched the bones of\nElisha, he revived and stood on his feet.\nAnd Hazael king of Syria oppressed\nIsrael all the days of Jehoahaz.\nBut the LORD was gracious to them,\nhad compassion on them, and regarded\nthem, because of His covenant with\nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would\nnot yet destroy them or cast them from\nHis presence.\nNow Hazael king of Syria died. Then\nBen-Hadad his son reigned in his place.\nAnd Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz\nrecaptured from the hand of Ben-Hadad,\nthe son of Hazael, the cities which he\nhad taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz\nhis father by war. Three times Joash\ndefeated him and recaptured the cities\nof Israel.\n14In the second year of Joash the\nson of Jehoahaz, king of Israel,\nAmaziah the son of Joash, king of\nJudah, became king.\nHe was twenty-five years old when he\nbecame king, and he reigned twentynine years in Jerusalem. His mother's\nname was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.\nAnd he did what was right in the sight\nof the LORD, yet not like his father\nDavid; he did everything as his father\nJoash had done.\nHowever the high places were not\ntaken away, and the people still\nsacrificed and burned incense on the\nhigh places.\nNow it happened, as soon as the\nkingdom was established in his hand,\nthat he executed his servants who had\nmurdered his father the king.\nBut the children of the murderers he did\nnot execute, according to what is written\nin the Book of the Law of Moses, in\nwhich the LORD commanded, saying,\n\"Fathers shall not be put to death for\ntheir children, nor shall children be put\nto death for their fathers; but a person\nshall be put to death for his own sin.\"\nHe killed ten thousand Edomites in the\nValley of Salt, and took Sela by war, and\ncalled its name Joktheel to this day.\nAnd he took all the gold and silver, all\nthe articles that were found in the house\nof the LORD and in the treasuries of the\nking's house, and hostages, and\nreturned to Samaria.\nThen Amaziah sent messengers to\nJehoash the son of Jehoahaz, the son\nof Jehu, king of Israel, saying, \"Come,\nlet us face one another in battle.\"\nNow the rest of the acts of Jehoash\nwhich he did--his might, and how he\nfought with Amaziah king of Judah--are\nthey not written in the book of the\nchronicles of the kings of Israel?\nAnd Jehoash king of Israel sent to\nAmaziah king of Judah, saying, \"The\nthistle that was in Lebanon sent to the\ncedar that was in Lebanon, saying,\n\"Give your daughter to my son as wife';\nand a wild beast that was in Lebanon\npassed by and trampled the thistle.\nYou have indeed defeated Edom, and\nyour heart has lifted you up. Glory in\nthat, and stay at home; for why should\nyou meddle with trouble so that you fall-you and Judah with you?\"\nBut Amaziah would not heed.\nTherefore Jehoash king of Israel went\nout; so he and Amaziah king of Judah\nfaced one another at Beth Shemesh,\nwhich belongs to Judah.\nSo Jehoash rested with his fathers,\nand was buried in Samaria with the\nkings of Israel. Then Jeroboam his son\nreigned in his place.\nAmaziah the son of Joash, king of\nJudah, lived fifteen years after the death\nof Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, king of\nIsrael.\nNow the rest of the acts of Amaziah,\nare they not written in the book of the\nchronicles of the kings of Judah?\nAnd they formed a conspiracy against\nhim in Jerusalem, and he fled to\nLachish; but they sent after him to\nLachish and killed him there.\nAnd Judah was defeated by Israel,\nand every man fled to his tent.\nThen they brought him on horses, and\nhe was buried at Jerusalem with his\nfathers in the City of David.\nThen Jehoash king of Israel captured\nAmaziah king of Judah, the son of\nJehoash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth\nShemesh; and he went to Jerusalem,\nand broke down the wall of Jerusalem\nfrom the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner\nGate--four hundred cubits.\nAnd all the people of Judah took\nAzariah, who was sixteen years old, and\nmade him king instead of his father\nAmaziah.\nHe built Elath and restored it to Judah,\nafter the king rested with his fathers.\nIn the fifteenth year of Amaziah the\nson of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam\nthe son of Joash, king of Israel, became\nking in Samaria, and reigned forty-one\nyears.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the\nLORD; he did not depart from all the\nsins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who\nhad made Israel sin.\nHe restored the territory of Israel from\nthe entrance of Hamath to the Sea of\nthe Arabah, according to the word of the\nLORD God of Israel, which He had\nspoken through His servant Jonah the\nson of Amittai, the prophet who was\nfrom Gath Hepher.\nFor the LORD saw that the affliction of\nIsrael was very bitter; and whether bond\nor free, there was no helper for Israel.\nAnd the LORD did not say that He\nwould blot out the name of Israel from\nunder heaven; but He saved them by\nthe hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.\nNow the rest of the acts of Jeroboam,\nand all that he did--his might, how he\nmade war, and how he recaptured for\nIsrael, from Damascus and Hamath,\nwhat had belonged to Judah--are they\nnot written in the book of the chronicles\nof the kings of Israel?\nSo Jeroboam rested with his fathers,\nthe kings of Israel. Then Zechariah his\nson reigned in his place.\n15In the twenty-seventh year of\nJeroboam king of Israel, Azariah the son\nof Amaziah, king of Judah, became king.\nHe was sixteen years old when he\nbecame king, and he reigned fifty-two\nyears in Jerusalem. His mother's name\nwas Jecholiah of Jerusalem.\nAnd he did what was right in the sight\nof the LORD, according to all that his\nfather Amaziah had done,\nexcept that the high places were not\nremoved; the people still sacrificed and\nburned incense on the high places.\nThen the LORD struck the king, so that\nhe was a leper until the day of his death;\nso he dwelt in an isolated house. And\nJotham the king's son was over the\nroyal house, judging the people of the\nland.\nNow the rest of the acts of Azariah, and\nall that he did, are they not written in the\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of\nJudah?\nSo Azariah rested with his fathers, and\nthey buried him with his fathers in the\nCity of David. Then Jotham his son\nreigned in his place.\nIn the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king\nof Judah, Zechariah the son of\nJeroboam reigned over Israel in\nSamaria six months.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the LORD,\nas his fathers had done; he did not\ndepart from the sins of Jeroboam the\nson of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.\nbecame king over Israel, and reigned\nten years in Samaria.\nThen Shallum the son of Jabesh\nconspired against him, and struck and\nkilled him in front of the people; and he\nreigned in his place.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the\nLORD; he did not depart all his days\nfrom the sins of Jeroboam the son of\nNebat, who had made Israel sin.\nNow the rest of the acts of Zechariah,\nindeed they are written in the book of\nthe chronicles of the kings of Israel.\nThis was the word of the LORD which\nHe spoke to Jehu, saying, \"Your sons\nshall sit on the throne of Israel to the\nfourth generation.\" And so it was.\nShallum the son of Jabesh became\nking in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah\nking of Judah; and he reigned a full\nmonth in Samaria.\nFor Menahem the son of Gadi went up\nfrom Tirzah, came to Samaria, and\nstruck Shallum the son of Jabesh in\nSamaria and killed him; and he reigned\nin his place.\nNow the rest of the acts of Shallum,\nand the conspiracy which he led, indeed\nthey are written in the book of the\nchronicles of the kings of Israel.\nThen from Tirzah, Menahem attacked\nTiphsah, all who were there, and its\nterritory. Because they did not surrender,\ntherefore he attacked it. All the women\nthere who were with child he ripped\nopen.\nIn the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king\nof Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi\nPul king of Assyria came against the\nland; and Menahem gave Pul a\nthousand talents of silver, that his hand\nmight be with him to strengthen the\nkingdom under his control.\nAnd Menahem exacted the money\nfrom Israel, from all the very wealthy,\nfrom each man fifty shekels of silver, to\ngive to the king of Assyria. So the king\nof Assyria turned back, and did not stay\nthere in the land.\nNow the rest of the acts of Menahem,\nand all that he did, are they not written\nin the book of the chronicles of the kings\nof Israel?\nSo Menahem rested with his fathers.\nThen Pekahiah his son reigned in his\nplace.\nIn the fiftieth year of Azariah king of\nJudah, Pekahiah the son of Menahem\nbecame king over Israel in Samaria, and\nreigned two years.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the\nLORD; he did not depart from the sins of\nJeroboam the son of Nebat, who had\nmade Israel sin.\nThen Pekah the son of Remaliah, an\nofficer of his, conspired against him and\nkilled him in Samaria, in the citadel of\nthe king's house, along with Argob and\nArieh; and with him were fifty men of\nGilead. He killed him and reigned in his\nplace.\nHe was twenty-five years old when he\nbecame king, and he reigned sixteen\nyears in Jerusalem. His mother's name\nwas Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.\nNow the rest of the acts of Pekahiah,\nand all that he did, indeed they are\nwritten in the book of the chronicles of\nthe kings of Israel.\nAnd he did what was right in the sight\nof the LORD; he did according to all that\nhis father Uzziah had done.\nIn the fifty-second year of Azariah king\nof Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah\nbecame king over Israel in Samaria, and\nreigned twenty years.\nHowever the high places were not\nremoved; the people still sacrificed and\nburned incense on the high places. He\nbuilt the Upper Gate of the house of the\nLORD.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the\nLORD; he did not depart from the sins of\nJeroboam the son of Nebat, who had\nmade Israel sin.\nNow the rest of the acts of Jotham,\nand all that he did, are they not written\nin the book of the chronicles of the kings\nof Judah?\nIn the days of Pekah king of Israel,\nTiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came and\ntook Ijon, Abel Beth Maachah, Janoah,\nKedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, all\nthe land of Naphtali; and he carried\nthem captive to Assyria.\nThen Hoshea the son of Elah led a\nconspiracy against Pekah the son of\nRemaliah, and struck and killed him; so\nhe reigned in his place in the twentieth\nyear of Jotham the son of Uzziah.\nNow the rest of the acts of Pekah, and\nall that he did, indeed they are written in\nthe book of the chronicles of the kings of\nIsrael.\nIn the second year of Pekah the son of\nRemaliah, king of Israel, Jotham the son\nof Uzziah, king of Judah, began to reign.\nIn those days the LORD began to\nsend Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the\nson of Remaliah against Judah.\nSo Jotham rested with his fathers, and\nwas buried with his fathers in the City of\nDavid his father. Then Ahaz his son\nreigned in his place.\n16In the seventeenth year of Pekah\nthe son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of\nJotham, king of Judah, began to reign.\nAhaz was twenty years old when he\nbecame king, and he reigned sixteen\nyears in Jerusalem; and he did not do\nwhat was right in the sight of the LORD\nhis God, as his father David had done.\nBut he walked in the way of the kings of\nIsrael; indeed he made his son pass\nthrough the fire, according to the\nabominations of the nations whom the\nLORD had cast out from before the\nchildren of Israel.\ndesign of the altar and its pattern,\naccording to all its workmanship.\nAnd he sacrificed and burned incense\non the high places, on the hills, and\nunder every green tree.\nThen Urijah the priest built an altar\naccording to all that King Ahaz had sent\nfrom Damascus. So Urijah the priest\nmade it before King Ahaz came back\nfrom Damascus.\nThen Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the\nson of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up\nto Jerusalem to make war; and they\nbesieged Ahaz but could not overcome\nhim.\nAnd when the king came back from\nDamascus, the king saw the altar; and\nthe king approached the altar and made\nofferings on it.\nAt that time Rezin king of Syria\ncaptured Elath for Syria, and drove the\nmen of Judah from Elath. Then the\nEdomites went to Elath, and dwell there\nto this day.\nSo he burned his burnt offering and his\ngrain offering; and he poured his drink\noffering and sprinkled the blood of his\npeace offerings on the altar.\nSo Ahaz sent messengers to TiglathPileser king of Assyria, saying, \"I am\nyour servant and your son. Come up\nand save me from the hand of the king\nof Syria and from the hand of the king of\nIsrael, who rise up against me.\"\nAnd Ahaz took the silver and gold that\nwas found in the house of the LORD,\nand in the treasuries of the king's house,\nand sent it as a present to the king of\nAssyria.\nSo the king of Assyria heeded him; for\nthe king of Assyria went up against\nDamascus and took it, carried its people\ncaptive to Kir, and killed Rezin.\nNow King Ahaz went to Damascus to\nmeet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, and\nsaw an altar that was at Damascus; and\nKing Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the\nHe also brought the bronze altar which\nwas before the LORD, from the front of\nthe temple--from between the new altar\nand the house of the LORD--and put it\non the north side of the new altar.\nThen King Ahaz commanded Urijah\nthe priest, saying, \"On the great new\naltar burn the morning burnt offering, the\nevening grain offering, the king's burnt\nsacrifice, and his grain offering, with the\nburnt offering of all the people of the\nland, their grain offering, and their drink\nofferings; and sprinkle on it all the blood\nof the burnt offering and all the blood of\nthe sacrifice. And the bronze altar shall\nbe for me to inquire by.\"\nThus did Urijah the priest, according to\nall that King Ahaz commanded.\nAnd King Ahaz cut off the panels of\nthe carts, and removed the lavers from\nthem; and he took down the Sea from\nthe bronze oxen that were under it, and\nput it on a pavement of stones.\nAlso he removed the Sabbath pavilion\nwhich they had built in the temple, and\nhe removed the king's outer entrance\nfrom the house of the LORD, on account\nof the king of Assyria.\nIn the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of\nAssyria took Samaria and carried Israel\naway to Assyria, and placed them in\nHalah and by the Habor, the River of\nGozan, and in the cities of the Medes.\nNow the rest of the acts of Ahaz which\nhe did, are they not written in the book\nof the chronicles of the kings of Judah?\nFor so it was that the children of Israel\nhad sinned against the LORD their God,\nwho had brought them up out of the land\nof Egypt, from under the hand of\nPharaoh king of Egypt; and they had\nfeared other gods,\nSo Ahaz rested with his fathers, and\nwas buried with his fathers in the City of\nDavid. Then Hezekiah his son reigned in\nhis place.\n17In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of\nJudah, Hoshea the son of Elah became\nking of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned\nnine years.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the LORD,\nbut not as the kings of Israel who were\nbefore him.\nShalmaneser king of Assyria came up\nagainst him; and Hoshea became his\nvassal, and paid him tribute money.\nAnd the king of Assyria uncovered a\nconspiracy by Hoshea; for he had sent\nmessengers to So, king of Egypt, and\nbrought no tribute to the king of Assyria,\nas he had done year by year. Therefore\nthe king of Assyria shut him up, and\nbound him in prison.\nNow the king of Assyria went\nthroughout all the land, and went up to\nSamaria and besieged it for three years.\nand had walked in the statutes of the\nnations whom the LORD had cast out\nfrom before the children of Israel, and of\nthe kings of Israel, which they had made.\nAlso the children of Israel secretly did\nagainst the LORD their God things that\nwere not right, and they built for\nthemselves high places in all their cities,\nfrom watchtower to fortified city.\nThey set up for themselves sacred\npillars and wooden images on every\nhigh hill and under every green tree.\nThere they burned incense on all the\nhigh places, like the nations whom the\nLORD had carried away before them;\nand they did wicked things to provoke\nthe LORD to anger,\nfor they served idols, of which the\nLORD had said to them, \"You shall not\ndo this thing.\"\nYet the LORD testified against Israel\nand against Judah, by all of His\nprophets, every seer, saying, \"Turn from\nyour evil ways, and keep My\ncommandments and My statutes,\naccording to all the law which I\ncommanded your fathers, and which I\nsent to you by My servants the\nprophets.\"\nAnd the LORD rejected all the\ndescendants of Israel, afflicted them,\nand delivered them into the hand of\nplunderers, until He had cast them from\nHis sight.\nNevertheless they would not hear, but\nstiffened their necks, like the necks of\ntheir fathers, who did not believe in the\nLORD their God.\nAnd they rejected His statutes and His\ncovenant that He had made with their\nfathers, and His testimonies which He\nhad testified against them; they followed\nidols, became idolaters, and went after\nthe nations who were all around them,\nconcerning whom the LORD had\ncharged them that they should not do\nlike them.\nSo they left all the commandments of\nthe LORD their God, made for\nthemselves a molded image and two\ncalves, made a wooden image and\nworshiped all the host of heaven, and\nserved Baal.\nAnd they caused their sons and\ndaughters to pass through the fire,\npracticed witchcraft and soothsaying,\nand sold themselves to do evil in the\nsight of the LORD, to provoke Him to\nanger.\nTherefore the LORD was very angry\nwith Israel, and removed them from His\nsight; there was none left but the tribe of\nJudah alone.\nAlso Judah did not keep the\ncommandments of the LORD their God,\nbut walked in the statutes of Israel which\nthey made.\nFor He tore Israel from the house of\nDavid, and they made Jeroboam the\nson of Nebat king. Then Jeroboam\ndrove Israel from following the LORD,\nand made them commit a great sin.\nFor the children of Israel walked in all\nthe sins of Jeroboam which he did; they\ndid not depart from them,\nuntil the LORD removed Israel out of\nHis sight, as He had said by all His\nservants the prophets. So Israel was\ncarried away from their own land to\nAssyria, as it is to this day.\nThen the king of Assyria brought\npeople from Babylon, Cuthah, Ava,\nHamath, and from Sepharvaim, and\nplaced them in the cities of Samaria\ninstead of the children of Israel; and\nthey took possession of Samaria and\ndwelt in its cities.\nAnd it was so, at the beginning of their\ndwelling there, that they did not fear the\nLORD; therefore the LORD sent lions\namong them, which killed some of them.\nSo they spoke to the king of Assyria,\nsaying, \"The nations whom you have\nremoved and placed in the cities of\nSamaria do not know the rituals of the\nGod of the land; therefore He has sent\nlions among them, and indeed, they are\nkilling them because they do not know\nthe rituals of the God of the land.\"\nThen the king of Assyria commanded,\nsaying, \"Send there one of the priests\nwhom you brought from there; let him go\nand dwell there, and let him teach them\nthe rituals of the God of the land.\"\nThen one of the priests whom they\nhad carried away from Samaria came\nand dwelt in Bethel, and taught them\nhow they should fear the LORD.\nHowever every nation continued to\nmake gods of its own, and put them in\nthe shrines on the high places which the\nSamaritans had made, every nation in\nthe cities where they dwelt.\ncommanded the children of Jacob,\nwhom He named Israel,\nwith whom the LORD had made a\ncovenant and charged them, saying:\n\"You shall not fear other gods, nor bow\ndown to them nor serve them nor\nsacrifice to them;\nbut the LORD, who brought you up\nfrom the land of Egypt with great power\nand an outstretched arm, Him you shall\nfear, Him you shall worship, and to Him\nyou shall offer sacrifice.\nThe men of Babylon made Succoth\nBenoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal,\nthe men of Hamath made Ashima,\nAnd the statutes, the ordinances, the\nlaw, and the commandment which He\nwrote for you, you shall be careful to\nobserve forever; you shall not fear other\ngods.\nand the Avites made Nibhaz and\nTartak; and the Sepharvites burned their\nchildren in fire to Adrammelech and\nAnammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.\nAnd the covenant that I have made\nwith you, you shall not forget, nor shall\nyou fear other gods.\nSo they feared the LORD, and from\nevery class they appointed for\nthemselves priests of the high places,\nwho sacrificed for them in the shrines of\nthe high places.\nThey feared the LORD, yet served\ntheir own gods--according to the rituals\nof the nations from among whom they\nwere carried away.\nTo this day they continue practicing\nthe former rituals; they do not fear the\nLORD, nor do they follow their statutes\nor their ordinances, or the law and\ncommandment which the LORD had\nBut the LORD your God you shall fear;\nand He will deliver you from the hand of\nall your enemies.\"\nHowever they did not obey, but they\nfollowed their former rituals.\nSo these nations feared the LORD, yet\nserved their carved images; also their\nchildren and their children's children\nhave continued doing as their fathers\ndid, even to this day.\n18Now it came to pass in the third\nyear of Hoshea the son of Elah, king of\nIsrael, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz,\nking of Judah, began to reign.\nHe was twenty-five years old when he\nbecame king, and he reigned twentynine years in Jerusalem. His mother's\nname was Abi the daughter of\nZechariah.\nAnd at the end of three years they took\nit. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is,\nthe ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel,\nSamaria was taken.\nAnd he did what was right in the sight\nof the LORD, according to all that his\nfather David had done.\nThen the king of Assyria carried Israel\naway captive to Assyria, and put them in\nHalah and by the Habor, the River of\nGozan, and in the cities of the Medes,\nHe removed the high places and broke\nthe sacred pillars, cut down the wooden\nimage and broke in pieces the bronze\nserpent that Moses had made; for until\nthose days the children of Israel burned\nincense to it, and called it Nehushtan.\nbecause they did not obey the voice of\nthe LORD their God, but transgressed\nHis covenant and all that Moses the\nservant of the LORD had commanded;\nand they would neither hear nor do them.\nHe trusted in the LORD God of Israel,\nso that after him was none like him\namong all the kings of Judah, nor who\nwere before him.\nAnd in the fourteenth year of King\nHezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria\ncame up against all the fortified cities of\nJudah and took them.\nFor he held fast to the LORD; he did\nnot depart from following Him, but kept\nHis commandments, which the LORD\nhad commanded Moses.\nThe LORD was with him; he prospered\nwherever he went. And he rebelled\nagainst the king of Assyria and did not\nserve him.\nHe subdued the Philistines, as far as\nGaza and its territory, from watchtower\nto fortified city.\nNow it came to pass in the fourth year\nof King Hezekiah, which was the\nseventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah,\nking of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of\nAssyria came up against Samaria and\nbesieged it.\nThen Hezekiah king of Judah sent to\nthe king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, \"I\nhave done wrong; turn away from me;\nwhatever you impose on me I will pay.\"\nAnd the king of Assyria assessed\nHezekiah king of Judah three hundred\ntalents of silver and thirty talents of gold.\nSo Hezekiah gave him all the silver\nthat was found in the house of the\nLORD and in the treasuries of the king's\nhouse.\nAt that time Hezekiah stripped the gold\nfrom the doors of the temple of the\nLORD, and from the pillars which\nHezekiah king of Judah had overlaid,\nand gave it to the king of Assyria.\nThen the king of Assyria sent the\nTartan,\nthe\nRabsaris,\nand\nthe\nRabshakeh from Lachish, with a great\narmy against Jerusalem, to King\nHezekiah. And they went up and came\nto Jerusalem. When they had come up,\nthey went and stood by the aqueduct\nfrom the upper pool, which was on the\nhighway to the Fuller's Field.\nAnd when they had called to the king,\nEliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over\nthe household, Shebna the scribe, and\nJoah the son of Asaph, the recorder,\ncame out to them.\nHow then will you repel one captain of\nthe least of my master's servants, and\nput your trust in Egypt for chariots and\nhorsemen?\nHave I now come up without the\nLORD against this place to destroy it?\nThe LORD said to me, \"Go up against\nthis land, and destroy it.\"'\nThen the Rabshakeh said to them,\n\"Say now to Hezekiah, \"Thus says the\ngreat king, the king of Assyria: \"What\nconfidence is this in which you trust?\nThen Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,\nShebna, and Joah said to the\nRabshakeh, \"Please speak to your\nservants in Aramaic, for we understand\nit; and do not speak to us in Hebrew in\nthe hearing of the people who are on the\nwall.\"\nYou speak of having plans and power\nfor war; but they are mere words. And in\nwhom do you trust, that you rebel\nagainst me?\nBut the Rabshakeh said to them, \"Has\nmy master sent me to your master and\nto you to speak these words, and not to\nthe men who sit on the wall, who will eat\nand drink their own waste with you?\"\nNow look! You are trusting in the staff\nof this broken reed, Egypt, on which if a\nman leans, it will go into his hand and\npierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to\nall who trust in him.\nThen the Rabshakeh stood and called\nout with a loud voice in Hebrew, and\nspoke, saying, \"Hear the word of the\ngreat king, the king of Assyria!\nBut if you say to me, \"We trust in the\nLORD our God,' is it not He whose high\nplaces and whose altars Hezekiah has\ntaken away, and said to Judah and\nJerusalem, \"You shall worship before\nthis altar in Jerusalem'?\"'\nNow therefore, I urge you, give a\npledge to my master the king of Assyria,\nand I will give you two thousand horses-if you are able on your part to put riders\non them!\nThus says the king: \"Do not let\nHezekiah deceive you, for he shall not\nbe able to deliver you from his hand;\nnor let Hezekiah make you trust in the\nLORD, saying, \"The LORD will surely\ndeliver us; this city shall not be given\ninto the hand of the king of Assyria.\"'\nDo not listen to Hezekiah; for thus\nsays the king of Assyria: \"Make peace\nwith me by a present and come out to\nme; and every one of you eat from his\nown vine and every one from his own fig\ntree, and every one of you drink the\nwaters of his own cistern;\nclothes, covered himself with sackcloth,\nand went into the house of the LORD.\nuntil I come and take you away to a\nland like your own land, a land of grain\nand new wine, a land of bread and\nvineyards, a land of olive groves and\nhoney, that you may live and not die.\nBut do not listen to Hezekiah, lest he\npersuade you, saying, \"The LORD will\ndeliver us.\"\nHas any of the gods of the nations at\nall delivered its land from the hand of\nthe king of Assyria?\nThen he sent Eliakim, who was over\nthe household, Shebna the scribe, and\nthe elders of the priests, covered with\nsackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son\nof Amoz.\nAnd they said to him, \"Thus says\nHezekiah: \"This day is a day of trouble,\nand rebuke, and blasphemy; for the\nchildren have come to birth, but there is\nno strength to bring them forth.\nWhere are the gods of Hamath and\nArpad? Where are the gods of\nSepharvaim and Hena and Ivah? Indeed,\nhave they delivered Samaria from my\nhand?\nIt may be that the LORD your God will\nhear all the words of the Rabshakeh,\nwhom his master the king of Assyria has\nsent to reproach the living God, and will\nrebuke the words which the LORD your\nGod has heard. Therefore lift up your\nprayer for the remnant that is left.\"'\nWho among all the gods of the lands\nhave delivered their countries from my\nhand, that the LORD should deliver\nJerusalem from my hand?\"'\nSo the servants of King Hezekiah came\nto Isaiah.\nBut the people held their peace and\nanswered him not a word; for the king's\ncommandment was, \"Do not answer\nhim.\"\nAnd Isaiah said to them, \"Thus you\nshall say to your master, \"Thus says the\nLORD: \"Do not be afraid of the words\nwhich you have heard, with which the\nservants of the king of Assyria have\nblasphemed Me.\nThen Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who\nwas over the household, Shebna the\nscribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the\nrecorder, came to Hezekiah with their\nclothes torn, and told him the words of\nthe Rabshakeh.\nSurely I will send a spirit upon him, and\nhe shall hear a rumor and return to his\nown land; and I will cause him to fall by\nthe sword in his own land.\"\"'\n19And so it was, when King\nHezekiah heard it, that he tore his\nThen the Rabshakeh returned and\nfound the king of Assyria warring\nagainst Libnah, for he heard that he had\ndeparted from Lachish.\nAnd the king heard concerning\nTirhakah king of Ethiopia, \"Look, he has\ncome out to make war with you.\" So he\nagain sent messengers to Hezekiah,\nsaying,\n\"Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah\nking of Judah, saying: \"Do not let your\nGod in whom you trust deceive you,\nsaying, \"Jerusalem shall not be given\ninto the hand of the king of Assyria.\"\nLook! You have heard what the kings\nof Assyria have done to all lands by\nutterly destroying them; and shall you be\ndelivered?\nHave the gods of the nations delivered\nthose whom my fathers have destroyed,\nGozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the\npeople of Eden who were in Telassar?\nTruly, LORD, the kings of Assyria have\nlaid waste the nations and their lands,\nand have cast their gods into the fire;\nfor they were not gods, but the work of\nmen's\nhands--wood\nand\nstone.\nTherefore they destroyed them.\nNow therefore, O LORD our God, I\npray, save us from his hand, that all the\nkingdoms of the earth may know that\nYou are the LORD God, You alone.\"\nThen Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to\nHezekiah, saying, \"Thus says the LORD\nGod of Israel: \"Because you have\nprayed to Me against Sennacherib king\nof Assyria, I have heard.'\nWhere is the king of Hamath, the king\nof Arpad, and the king of the city of\nSepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?\"'\nThis is the word which the LORD has\nspoken concerning him: \"The virgin, the\ndaughter of Zion, Has despised you,\nlaughed you to scorn; The daughter of\nJerusalem Has shaken her head behind\nyour back!\nAnd Hezekiah received the letter from\nthe hand of the messengers, and read it;\nand Hezekiah went up to the house of\nthe LORD, and spread it before the\nLORD.\n\"Whom have you reproached and\nblasphemed? Against whom have you\nraised your voice, And lifted up your\neyes on high? Against the Holy One of\nIsrael.\nThen Hezekiah prayed before the\nLORD, and said: \"O LORD God of Israel,\nthe One who dwells between the\ncherubim, You are God, You alone, of\nall the kingdoms of the earth. You have\nmade heaven and earth.\nIncline Your ear, O LORD, and hear;\nopen Your eyes, O LORD, and see; and\nhear the words of Sennacherib, which\nhe has sent to reproach the living God.\nBy your messengers you have\nreproached the Lord, And said: \"By the\nmultitude of my chariots I have come up\nto the height of the mountains, To the\nlimits of Lebanon; I will cut down its tall\ncedars And its choice cypress trees; I\nwill enter the extremity of its borders, To\nits fruitful forest.\nI have dug and drunk strange water,\nAnd with the soles of my feet I have\ndried up All the brooks of defense.\"\n\"Did you not hear long ago How I\nmade it, From ancient times that I\nformed it? Now I have brought it to pass,\nThat you should be For crushing fortified\ncities into heaps of ruins.\n\"Therefore thus says the LORD\nconcerning the king of Assyria: \"He shall\nnot come into this city, Nor shoot an\narrow there, Nor come before it with\nshield, Nor build a siege mound against\nit.\nBy the way that he came, By the same\nshall he return; And he shall not come\ninto this city,' Says the LORD.\nTherefore their inhabitants had little\npower; They were dismayed and\nconfounded; They were as the grass of\nthe field And the green herb, As the\ngrass on the housetops And grain\nblighted before it is grown.\n\"But I know your dwelling place, Your\ngoing out and your coming in, And your\nrage against Me.\nBecause your rage against Me and\nyour tumult Have come up to My ears,\nTherefore I will put My hook in your\nnose And My bridle in your lips, And I\nwill turn you back By the way which you\ncame.\n\"For I will defend this city, to save it\nFor My own sake and for My servant\nDavid's sake.\"'\nAnd it came to pass on a certain night\nthat the angel of the LORD went out,\nand killed in the camp of the Assyrians\none hundred and eighty-five thousand;\nand when people arose early in the\nmorning, there were the corpses--all\ndead.\nSo Sennacherib king of Assyria\ndeparted and went away, returned home,\nand remained at Nineveh.\n\"This shall be a sign to you: You shall\neat this year such as grows of itself, And\nin the second year what springs from\nthe same; Also in the third year sow and\nreap, Plant vineyards and eat the fruit of\nthem.\nAnd the remnant who have escaped of\nthe house of Judah Shall again take root\ndownward, And bear fruit upward.\nFor out of Jerusalem shall go a\nremnant, And those who escape from\nMount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of\nhosts will do this.'\nNow it came to pass, as he was\nworshiping in the temple of Nisroch his\ngod, that his sons Adrammelech and\nSharezer struck him down with the\nsword; and they escaped into the land of\nArarat. Then Esarhaddon his son\nreigned in his place.\n20In those days Hezekiah was sick\nand near death. And Isaiah the prophet,\nthe son of Amoz, went to him and said\nto him, \"Thus says the LORD: \"Set your\nhouse in order, for you shall die, and not\nlive.\"'\nThen he turned his face toward the wall,\nand prayed to the LORD, saying,\n\"Remember now, O LORD, I pray, how\nI have walked before You in truth and\nwith a loyal heart, and have done what\nwas good in Your sight.\" And Hezekiah\nwept bitterly.\nAnd Hezekiah answered, \"It is an easy\nthing for the shadow to go down ten\ndegrees; no, but let the shadow go\nbackward ten degrees.\"\nSo Isaiah the prophet cried out to the\nLORD, and He brought the shadow ten\ndegrees backward, by which it had gone\ndown on the sundial of Ahaz.\nAnd it happened, before Isaiah had\ngone out into the middle court, that the\nword of the LORD came to him, saying,\n\"Return and tell Hezekiah the leader of\nMy people, \"Thus says the LORD, the\nGod of David your father: \"I have heard\nyour prayer, I have seen your tears;\nsurely I will heal you. On the third day\nyou shall go up to the house of the\nLORD.\nAnd I will add to your days fifteen years.\nI will deliver you and this city from the\nhand of the king of Assyria; and I will\ndefend this city for My own sake, and for\nthe sake of My servant David.\"\"'\nThen Isaiah said, \"Take a lump of figs.\"\nSo they took and laid it on the boil, and\nhe recovered.\nAt that time Berodach-Baladan the son\nof Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters\nand a present to Hezekiah, for he heard\nthat Hezekiah had been sick.\nAnd Hezekiah was attentive to them,\nand showed them all the house of his\ntreasures--the silver and gold, the\nspices and precious ointment, and all\nhis armory--all that was found among\nhis treasures. There was nothing in his\nhouse or in all his dominion that\nHezekiah did not show them.\nThen Isaiah the prophet went to King\nHezekiah, and said to him, \"What did\nthese men say, and from where did they\ncome to you?\" So Hezekiah said, \"They\ncame from a far country, from Babylon.\"\nAnd Hezekiah said to Isaiah, \"What is\nthe sign that the LORD will heal me, and\nthat I shall go up to the house of the\nLORD the third day?\"\nAnd he said, \"What have they seen in\nyour house?\" So Hezekiah answered,\n\"They have seen all that is in my house;\nthere is nothing among my treasures\nthat I have not shown them.\"\nThen Isaiah said, \"This is the sign to\nyou from the LORD, that the LORD will\ndo the thing which He has spoken: shall\nthe shadow go forward ten degrees or\ngo backward ten degrees?\"\nThen Isaiah said to Hezekiah, \"Hear\nthe word of the LORD:\n\"Behold, the days are coming when all\nthat is in your house, and what your\nfathers have accumulated until this day,\nshall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall\nbe left,' says the LORD.\nHe also built altars in the house of the\nLORD, of which the LORD had said, \"In\nJerusalem I will put My name.\"\n\"And they shall take away some of\nyour sons who will descend from you,\nwhom you will beget; and they shall be\neunuchs in the palace of the king of\nBabylon.\"'\nAnd he built altars for all the host of\nheaven in the two courts of the house of\nthe LORD.\nSo Hezekiah said to Isaiah, \"The word\nof the LORD which you have spoken is\ngood!\" For he said, \"Will there not be\npeace and truth at least in my days?\"\nAlso he made his son pass through the\nfire, practiced soothsaying, used\nwitchcraft, and consulted spiritists and\nmediums. He did much evil in the sight\nof the LORD, to provoke Him to anger.\nNow the rest of the acts of Hezekiah-all his might, and how he made a pool\nand a tunnel and brought water into the\ncity--are they not written in the book of\nthe chronicles of the kings of Judah?\nSo Hezekiah rested with his fathers.\nThen Manasseh his son reigned in his\nplace.\n21Manasseh was twelve years old\nwhen he became king, and he reigned\nfifty-five years in Jerusalem. His\nmother's name was Hephzibah.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the LORD,\naccording to the abominations of the\nnations whom the LORD had cast out\nbefore the children of Israel.\nFor he rebuilt the high places which\nHezekiah his father had destroyed; he\nraised up altars for Baal, and made a\nwooden image, as Ahab king of Israel\nhad done; and he worshiped all the host\nof heaven and served them.\nHe even set a carved image of Asherah\nthat he had made, in the house of which\nthe LORD had said to David and to\nSolomon his son, \"In this house and in\nJerusalem, which I have chosen out of\nall the tribes of Israel, I will put My name\nforever;\nand I will not make the feet of Israel\nwander anymore from the land which I\ngave their fathers--only if they are\ncareful to do according to all that I have\ncommanded them, and according to all\nthe law that My servant Moses\ncommanded them.\"\nBut they paid no attention, and\nManasseh seduced them to do more\nevil than the nations whom the LORD\nhad destroyed before the children of\nIsrael.\nAnd the LORD spoke by His servants\nthe prophets, saying,\n\"Because Manasseh king of Judah has\ndone these abominations (he has acted\nmore wickedly than all the Amorites who\nwere before him, and has also made\nJudah sin with his idols),\ntherefore thus says the LORD God of\nIsrael: \"Behold, I am bringing such\ncalamity upon Jerusalem and Judah,\nthat whoever hears of it, both his ears\nwill tingle.\nAmon was twenty-two years old when\nhe became king, and he reigned two\nyears in Jerusalem. His mother's name\nwas Meshullemeth the daughter of\nHaruz of Jotbah.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the\nLORD, as his father Manasseh had\ndone.\nAnd I will stretch over Jerusalem the\nmeasuring line of Samaria and the\nplummet of the house of Ahab; I will\nwipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish,\nwiping it and turning it upside down.\nSo he walked in all the ways that his\nfather had walked; and he served the\nidols that his father had served, and\nworshiped them.\nSo I will forsake the remnant of My\ninheritance and deliver them into the\nhand of their enemies; and they shall\nbecome victims of plunder to all their\nenemies,\nbecause they have done evil in My\nsight, and have provoked Me to anger\nsince the day their fathers came out of\nEgypt, even to this day.\"'\nMoreover Manasseh shed very much\ninnocent blood, till he had filled\nJerusalem from one end to another,\nbesides his sin by which he made Judah\nsin, in doing evil in the sight of the\nLORD.\nNow the rest of the acts of Manasseh-all that he did, and the sin that he\ncommitted--are they not written in the\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of\nJudah?\nSo Manasseh rested with his fathers,\nand was buried in the garden of his own\nhouse, in the garden of Uzza. Then his\nson Amon reigned in his place.\nHe forsook the LORD God of his\nfathers, and did not walk in the way of\nthe LORD.\nThen the servants of Amon conspired\nagainst him, and killed the king in his\nown house.\nBut the people of the land executed all\nthose who had conspired against King\nAmon. Then the people of the land\nmade his son Josiah king in his place.\nNow the rest of the acts of Amon\nwhich he did, are they not written in the\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of\nJudah?\nAnd he was buried in his tomb in the\ngarden of Uzza. Then Josiah his son\nreigned in his place.\n22Josiah was eight years old when\nhe became king, and he reigned thirtyone years in Jerusalem. His mother's\nname was Jedidah the daughter of\nAdaiah of Bozkath.\nAnd he did what was right in the sight\nof the LORD, and walked in all the ways\nof his father David; he did not turn aside\nto the right hand or to the left.\ndelivered it into the hand of those who\ndo the work, who oversee the house of\nthe LORD.\"\nNow it came to pass, in the eighteenth\nyear of King Josiah, that the king sent\nShaphan the scribe, the son of Azaliah,\nthe son of Meshullam, to the house of\nthe LORD, saying:\n\"Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that\nhe may count the money which has\nbeen brought into the house of the\nLORD, which the doorkeepers have\ngathered from the people.\nAnd let them deliver it into the hand of\nthose doing the work, who are the\noverseers in the house of the LORD; let\nthem give it to those who are in the\nhouse of the LORD doing the work, to\nrepair the damages of the house--\nThen Shaphan the scribe showed the\nking, saying, \"Hilkiah the priest has\ngiven me a book.\" And Shaphan read it\nbefore the king.\nNow it happened, when the king heard\nthe words of the Book of the Law, that\nhe tore his clothes.\nThen the king commanded Hilkiah the\npriest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan,\nAchbor the son of Michaiah, Shaphan\nthe scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the\nking, saying,\nto carpenters and builders and masons-and to buy timber and hewn stone to\nrepair the house.\n\"Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for\nthe people and for all Judah, concerning\nthe words of this book that has been\nfound; for great is the wrath of the\nLORD that is aroused against us,\nbecause our fathers have not obeyed\nthe words of this book, to do according\nto all that is written concerning us.\"\nHowever there need be no accounting\nmade with them of the money delivered\ninto their hand, because they deal\nfaithfully.\"\nThen Hilkiah the high priest said to\nShaphan the scribe, \"I have found the\nBook of the Law in the house of the\nLORD.\" And Hilkiah gave the book to\nShaphan, and he read it.\nSo Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor,\nShaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah\nthe prophetess, the wife of Shallum the\nson of Tikvah, the son of Harhas,\nkeeper of the wardrobe. (She dwelt in\nJerusalem in the Second Quarter.) And\nthey spoke with her.\nThen she said to them, \"Thus says the\nLORD God of Israel, \"Tell the man who\nsent you to Me,\nSo Shaphan the scribe went to the king,\nbringing the king word, saying, \"Your\nservants have gathered the money that\nwas found in the house, and have\n\"Thus says the LORD: \"Behold, I will\nbring calamity on this place and on its\ninhabitants--all the words of the book\nwhich the king of Judah has read-17\nbecause they have forsaken Me and\nburned incense to other gods, that they\nmight provoke Me to anger with all the\nworks of their hands. Therefore My\nwrath shall be aroused against this\nplace and shall not be quenched.\"\"\nBut as for the king of Judah, who sent\nyou to inquire of the LORD, in this\nmanner you shall speak to him, \"Thus\nsays the LORD God of Israel:\n\"Concerning the words which you have\nheard-19\nbecause your heart was tender, and\nyou humbled yourself before the LORD\nwhen you heard what I spoke against\nthis place and against its inhabitants,\nthat they would become a desolation\nand a curse, and you tore your clothes\nand wept before Me, I also have heard\nyou,\" says the LORD.\nAnd he read in their hearing all the\nwords of the Book of the Covenant\nwhich had been found in the house of\nthe LORD.\nThen the king stood by a pillar and\nmade a covenant before the LORD, to\nfollow the LORD and to keep His\ncommandments and His testimonies\nand His statutes, with all his heart and\nall his soul, to perform the words of this\ncovenant that were written in this book.\nAnd all the people took a stand for the\ncovenant.\nAnd the king commanded Hilkiah the\nhigh priest, the priests of the second\norder, and the doorkeepers, to bring out\nof the temple of the LORD all the\narticles that were made for Baal, for\nAsherah, and for all the host of heaven;\nand he burned them outside Jerusalem\nin the fields of Kidron, and carried their\nashes to Bethel.\nSurely, therefore, I will gather you to\nyour fathers, and you shall be gathered\nto your grave in peace; and your eyes\nshall not see all the calamity which I will\nbring on this place.\"\"' So they brought\nback word to the king.\nThen he removed the idolatrous priests\nwhom the kings of Judah had ordained\nto burn incense on the high places in the\ncities of Judah and in the places all\naround Jerusalem, and those who\nburned incense to Baal, to the sun, to\nthe moon, to the constellations, and to\nall the host of heaven.\n23Now the king sent them to gather\nall the elders of Judah and Jerusalem to\nhim.\nThe king went up to the house of the\nLORD with all the men of Judah, and\nwith him all the inhabitants of\nJerusalem--the priests and the prophets\nand all the people, both small and great.\nAnd he brought out the wooden image\nfrom the house of the LORD, to the\nBrook Kidron outside Jerusalem, burned\nit at the Brook Kidron and ground it to\nashes, and threw its ashes on the\ngraves of the common people.\nThen he tore down the ritual booths of\nthe perverted persons that were in the\nhouse of the LORD, where the women\nwove hangings for the wooden image.\nAnd he brought all the priests from the\ncities of Judah, and defiled the high\nplaces where the priests had burned\nincense, from Geba to Beersheba; also\nhe broke down the high places at the\ngates which were at the entrance of the\nGate of Joshua the governor of the city,\nwhich were to the left of the city gate.\nNevertheless the priests of the high\nplaces did not come up to the altar of\nthe LORD in Jerusalem, but they ate\nunleavened bread among their brethren.\nSidonians,\nfor\nChemosh\nthe\nabomination of the Moabites, and for\nMilcom the abomination of the people of\nAmmon.\nAnd he broke in pieces the sacred\npillars and cut down the wooden images,\nand filled their places with the bones of\nmen.\nMoreover the altar that was at Bethel,\nand the high place which Jeroboam the\nson of Nebat, who made Israel sin, had\nmade, both that altar and the high place\nhe broke down; and he burned the high\nplace and crushed it to powder, and\nburned the wooden image.\nAnd he defiled Topheth, which is in the\nValley of the Son of Hinnom, that no\nman might make his son or his daughter\npass through the fire to Molech.\nThen he removed the horses that the\nkings of Judah had dedicated to the sun,\nat the entrance to the house of the\nLORD, by the chamber of NathanMelech, the officer who was in the court;\nand he burned the chariots of the sun\nwith fire.\nThe altars that were on the roof, the\nupper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings\nof Judah had made, and the altars\nwhich Manasseh had made in the two\ncourts of the house of the LORD, the\nking broke down and pulverized there,\nand threw their dust into the Brook\nKidron.\nThen the king defiled the high places\nthat were east of Jerusalem, which were\non the south of the Mount of Corruption,\nwhich Solomon king of Israel had built\nfor Ashtoreth the abomination of the\nAs Josiah turned, he saw the tombs\nthat were there on the mountain. And he\nsent and took the bones out of the\ntombs and burned them on the altar,\nand defiled it according to the word of\nthe LORD which the man of God\nproclaimed, who proclaimed these\nwords.\nThen he said, \"What gravestone is this\nthat I see?\" So the men of the city told\nhim, \"It is the tomb of the man of God\nwho came from Judah and proclaimed\nthese things which you have done\nagainst the altar of Bethel.\"\nAnd he said, \"Let him alone; let no one\nmove his bones.\" So they let his bones\nalone, with the bones of the prophet\nwho came from Samaria.\nNow Josiah also took away all the\nshrines of the high places that were in\nthe cities of Samaria, which the kings of\nIsrael had made to provoke the LORD to\nanger; and he did to them according to\nall the deeds he had done in Bethel.\nagainst Judah, because of all the\nprovocations with which Manasseh had\nprovoked Him.\nHe executed all the priests of the high\nplaces who were there, on the altars,\nand burned men's bones on them; and\nhe returned to Jerusalem.\nThen the king commanded all the\npeople, saying, \"Keep the Passover to\nthe LORD your God, as it is written in\nthis Book of the Covenant.\"\nSuch a Passover surely had never\nbeen held since the days of the judges\nwho judged Israel, nor in all the days of\nthe kings of Israel and the kings of\nJudah.\nAnd the LORD said, \"I will also remove\nJudah from My sight, as I have removed\nIsrael, and will cast off this city\nJerusalem which I have chosen, and the\nhouse of which I said, \"My name shall\nbe there.\"'\nNow the rest of the acts of Josiah, and\nall that he did, are they not written in the\nbook of the chronicles of the kings of\nJudah?\nBut in the eighteenth year of King\nJosiah this Passover was held before\nthe LORD in Jerusalem.\nIn his days Pharaoh Necho king of\nEgypt went to the aid of the king of\nAssyria, to the River Euphrates; and\nKing Josiah went against him. And\nPharaoh Necho killed him at Megiddo\nwhen he confronted him.\nMoreover Josiah put away those who\nconsulted mediums and spiritists, the\nhousehold gods and idols, all the\nabominations that were seen in the land\nof Judah and in Jerusalem, that he\nmight perform the words of the law\nwhich were written in the book that\nHilkiah the priest found in the house of\nthe LORD.\nNow before him there was no king like\nhim, who turned to the LORD with all his\nheart, with all his soul, and with all his\nmight, according to all the Law of\nMoses; nor after him did any arise like\nhim.\nThen his servants moved his body in a\nchariot from Megiddo, brought him to\nJerusalem, and buried him in his own\ntomb. And the people of the land took\nJehoahaz the son of Josiah, anointed\nhim, and made him king in his father's\nplace.\nJehoahaz was twenty-three years old\nwhen he became king, and he reigned\nthree months in Jerusalem. His mother's\nname was Hamutal the daughter of\nJeremiah of Libnah.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the\nLORD, according to all that his fathers\nhad done.\nNevertheless the LORD did not turn\nfrom the fierceness of His great wrath,\nwith which His anger was aroused\nNow Pharaoh Necho put him in prison\nat Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he\nmight not reign in Jerusalem; and he\nimposed on the land a tribute of one\nhundred talents of silver and a talent of\ngold.\nSurely at the commandment of the\nLORD this came upon Judah, to remove\nthem from His sight because of the sins\nof Manasseh, according to all that he\nhad done,\nThen Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim\nthe son of Josiah king in place of his\nfather Josiah, and changed his name to\nJehoiakim. And Pharaoh took Jehoahaz\nand went to Egypt, and he died there.\nand also because of the innocent blood\nthat he had shed; for he had filled\nJerusalem with innocent blood, which\nthe LORD would not pardon.\nSo Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold\nto Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to\ngive money according to the command\nof Pharaoh; he exacted the silver and\ngold from the people of the land, from\nevery one according to his assessment,\nto give it to Pharaoh Necho.\nJehoiakim was twenty-five years old\nwhen he became king, and he reigned\neleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's\nname was Zebudah the daughter of\nPedaiah of Rumah.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the\nLORD, according to all that his fathers\nhad done.\n24In his days Nebuchadnezzar king\nNow the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim,\nand all that he did, are they not written\nin the book of the chronicles of the kings\nof Judah?\nSo Jehoiakim rested with his fathers.\nThen Jehoiachin his son reigned in his\nplace.\nAnd the king of Egypt did not come out\nof his land anymore, for the king of\nBabylon had taken all that belonged to\nthe king of Egypt from the Brook of\nEgypt to the River Euphrates.\nJehoiachin was eighteen years old\nwhen he became king, and he reigned\nin Jerusalem three months. His mother's\nname was Nehushta the daughter of\nElnathan of Jerusalem.\nof Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim\nbecame his vassal for three years. Then\nhe turned and rebelled against him.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the LORD,\naccording to all that his father had done.\nAnd the LORD sent against him raiding\nbands of Chaldeans, bands of Syrians,\nbands of Moabites, and bands of the\npeople of Ammon; He sent them against\nJudah to destroy it, according to the\nword of the LORD which He had spoken\nby His servants the prophets.\nAt that time the servants of\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came\nup against Jerusalem, and the city was\nbesieged.\nAnd Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon\ncame against the city, as his servants\nwere besieging it.\nThen Jehoiachin king of Judah, his\nmother, his servants, his princes, and\nhis officers went out to the king of\nBabylon; and the king of Babylon, in the\neighth year of his reign, took him\nprisoner.\nAnd he carried out from there all the\ntreasures of the house of the LORD and\nthe treasures of the king's house, and\nhe cut in pieces all the articles of gold\nwhich Solomon king of Israel had made\nin the temple of the LORD, as the LORD\nhad said.\nAlso he carried into captivity all\nJerusalem: all the captains and all the\nmighty men of valor, ten thousand\ncaptives, and all the craftsmen and\nsmiths. None remained except the\npoorest people of the land.\nAnd he carried Jehoiachin captive to\nBabylon. The king's mother, the king's\nwives, his officers, and the mighty of the\nland he carried into captivity from\nJerusalem to Babylon.\nAll the valiant men, seven thousand,\nand craftsmen and smiths, one\nthousand, all who were strong and fit for\nwar, these the king of Babylon brought\ncaptive to Babylon.\nThen the king of Babylon made\nMattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, king in\nhis place, and changed his name to\nZedekiah.\nZedekiah was twenty-one years old\nwhen he became king, and he reigned\neleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's\nname was Hamutal the daughter of\nJeremiah of Libnah.\nHe also did evil in the sight of the\nLORD, according to all that Jehoiakim\nhad done.\nFor because of the anger of the LORD\nthis happened in Jerusalem and Judah,\nthat He finally cast them out from His\npresence. Then Zedekiah rebelled\nagainst the king of Babylon.\n25Now it came to pass in the ninth\nyear of his reign, in the tenth month, on\nthe tenth day of the month, that\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all\nhis army came against Jerusalem and\nencamped against it; and they built a\nsiege wall against it all around.\nSo the city was besieged until the\neleventh year of King Zedekiah.\nBy the ninth day of the fourth month the\nfamine had become so severe in the city\nthat there was no food for the people of\nthe land.\nThen the city wall was broken through,\nand all the men of war fled at night by\nway of the gate between two walls,\nwhich was by the king's garden, even\nthough the Chaldeans were still\nencamped all around against the city.\nAnd the king went by way of the plain.\nBut the army of the Chaldeans pursued\nthe king, and they overtook him in the\nplains of Jericho. All his army was\nscattered from him.\nSo they took the king and brought him\nup to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and\nthey pronounced judgment on him.\nThen they killed the sons of Zedekiah\nbefore his eyes, put out the eyes of\nZedekiah, bound him with bronze fetters,\nand took him to Babylon.\nAnd in the fifth month, on the seventh\nday of the month (which was the\nnineteenth\nyear\nof\nKing\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),\nNebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a\nservant of the king of Babylon, came to\nJerusalem.\nall the bronze utensils with which the\npriests ministered.\nThe firepans and the basins, the things\nof solid gold and solid silver, the captain\nof the guard took away.\nThe two pillars, one Sea, and the carts,\nwhich Solomon had made for the house\nof the LORD, the bronze of all these\narticles was beyond measure.\nHe burned the house of the LORD and\nthe king's house; all the houses of\nJerusalem, that is, all the houses of the\ngreat, he burned with fire.\nAnd all the army of the Chaldeans who\nwere with the captain of the guard broke\ndown the walls of Jerusalem all around.\nThen Nebuzaradan the captain of the\nguard carried away captive the rest of\nthe people who remained in the city and\nthe defectors who had deserted to the\nking of Babylon, with the rest of the\nmultitude.\nBut the captain of the guard left some\nof the poor of the land as vinedressers\nand farmers.\nThe height of one pillar was eighteen\ncubits, and the capital on it was of\nbronze. The height of the capital was\nthree cubits, and the network and\npomegranates all around the capital\nwere all of bronze. The second pillar\nwas the same, with a network.\nAnd the captain of the guard took\nSeraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the\nsecond\npriest,\nand\nthe\nthree\ndoorkeepers.\nHe also took out of the city an officer\nwho had charge of the men of war, five\nmen of the king's close associates who\nwere found in the city, the chief\nrecruiting officer of the army, who\nmustered the people of the land, and\nsixty men of the people of the land who\nwere found in the city.\nThe bronze pillars that were in the\nhouse of the LORD, and the carts and\nthe bronze Sea that were in the house\nof the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in\npieces, and carried their bronze to\nBabylon.\nThey also took away the pots, the\nshovels, the trimmers, the spoons, and\nSo Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard,\ntook these and brought them to the king\nof Babylon at Riblah.\nThen the king of Babylon struck them\nand put them to death at Riblah in the\nland of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried\naway captive from its own land.\nThen he made Gedaliah the son of\nAhikam, the son of Shaphan, governor\nover the people who remained in the\nland of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar\nking of Babylon had left.\nAnd all the people, small and great,\nand the captains of the armies, arose\nand went to Egypt; for they were afraid\nof the Chaldeans.\nNow when all the captains of the\narmies, they and their men, heard that\nthe king of Babylon had made Gedaliah\ngovernor, they came to Gedaliah at\nMizpah--Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,\nJohanan the son of Careah, Seraiah the\nson of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and\nJaazaniah the son of a Maachathite,\nthey and their men.\nAnd Gedaliah took an oath before\nthem and their men, and said to them,\n\"Do not be afraid of the servants of the\nChaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve\nthe king of Babylon, and it shall be well\nwith you.\"\nNow it came to pass in the thirtyseventh year of the captivity of\nJehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth\nmonth, on the twenty-seventh day of the\nmonth, that Evil-Merodach king of\nBabylon, in the year that he began to\nreign, released Jehoiachin king of Judah\nfrom prison.\nHe spoke kindly to him, and gave him\na more prominent seat than those of the\nkings who were with him in Babylon.\nSo Jehoiachin changed from his prison\ngarments, and he ate bread regularly\nbefore the king all the days of his life.\nBut it happened in the seventh month\nthat Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the\nson of Elishama, of the royal family,\ncame with ten men and struck and killed\nGedaliah, the Jews, as well as the\nChaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.\nAnd as for his provisions, there was a\nregular ration given him by the king, a\nportion for each day, all the days of his\nlife.\n1st Chronicles\nthe Jebusite, the Amorite, and the\nGirgashite;\n1Adam, Seth, Enosh,\nthe Hivite, the Arkite, and the Sinite;\nCainan, Mahalalel, Jared,\nthe Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the\nHamathite.\nEnoch, Methuselah, Lamech,\nNoah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\nThe sons of Japheth were Gomer,\nMagog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech,\nand Tiras.\nThe sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz,\nDiphath, and Togarmah.\nThe sons of Javan were Elishah,\nTarshishah, Kittim, and Rodanim.\nThe sons of Shem were Elam, Asshur,\nArphaxad, Lud, Aram, Uz, Hul, Gether,\nand Meshech.\nArphaxad begot Shelah, and Shelah\nbegot Eber.\nTo Eber were born two sons: the name\nof one was Peleg, for in his days the\nearth was divided; and his brother's\nname was Joktan.\nThe sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim,\nPut, and Canaan.\nJoktan begot Almodad,\nHazarmaveth, Jerah,\nSheleph,\nThe sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah,\nSabta, Raama, and Sabtecha.

And the Philistines\nkilled\nJonathan,\nAbinadab,\nand\nMalchishua, Saul's sons.\nThen they put his armor in the temple\nof their gods, and fastened his head in\nthe temple of Dagon.\nThe battle became fierce against Saul.\nThe archers hit him, and he was\nwounded by the archers.\nThen Saul said to his armorbearer,\n\"Draw your sword, and thrust me\nthrough with it, lest these uncircumcised\nmen come and abuse me.\" But his\narmorbearer would not, for he was\ngreatly afraid. Therefore Saul took a\nsword and fell on it.\nAnd when his armorbearer saw that\nSaul was dead, he also fell on his sword\nand died.\nSo Saul and his three sons died, and all\nhis house died together.\nAnd when all the men of Israel who\nwere in the valley saw that they had fled\nand that Saul and his sons were dead,\nthey forsook their cities and fled; then\nthe Philistines came and dwelt in them.\nSo it happened the next day, when the\nPhilistines came to strip the slain, that\nthey found Saul and his sons fallen on\nMount Gilboa.\nAnd they stripped him and took his\nhead and his armor, and sent word\nthroughout the land of the Philistines to\nproclaim the news in the temple of their\nidols and among the people.\nAnd when all Jabesh Gilead heard all\nthat the Philistines had done to Saul,\nall the valiant men arose and took the\nbody of Saul and the bodies of his sons;\nand they brought them to Jabesh, and\nburied their bones under the tamarisk\ntree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.\nSo Saul died for his unfaithfulness\nwhich he had committed against the\nLORD, because he did not keep the\nword of the LORD, and also because he\nconsulted a medium for guidance.\nBut he did not inquire of the LORD;\ntherefore He killed him, and turned the\nkingdom over to David the son of Jesse.\n11Then all Israel came together to\nDavid at Hebron, saying, \"Indeed we are\nyour bone and your flesh.\nAlso, in time past, even when Saul was\nking, you were the one who led Israel\nout and brought them in; and the LORD\nyour God said to you, \"You shall\nshepherd My people Israel, and be ruler\nover My people Israel.\"'\nTherefore all the elders of Israel came\nto the king at Hebron, and David made a\ncovenant with them at Hebron before\nthe LORD. And they anointed David\nking over Israel, according to the word\nof the LORD by Samuel.\nAnd David and all Israel went to\nJerusalem, which is Jebus, where the\nJebusites were, the inhabitants of the\nland.\nHe was with David at Pasdammim.\nNow there the Philistines were gathered\nfor battle, and there was a piece of\nground full of barley. So the people fled\nfrom the Philistines.\nBut the inhabitants of Jebus said to\nDavid, \"You shall not come in here!\"\nNevertheless David took the stronghold\nof Zion (that is, the City of David).\nBut they stationed themselves in the\nmiddle of that field, defended it, and\nkilled the Philistines. So the LORD\nbrought about a great victory.\nNow David said, \"Whoever attacks the\nJebusites first shall be chief and\ncaptain.\" And Joab the son of Zeruiah\nwent up first, and became chief.\nThen David dwelt in the stronghold;\ntherefore they called it the City of David.\nAnd he built the city around it, from the\nMillo to the surrounding area. Joab\nrepaired the rest of the city.\nSo David went on and became great,\nand the LORD of hosts was with him.\nNow three of the thirty chief men went\ndown to the rock to David, into the cave\nof Adullam; and the army of the\nPhilistines encamped in the Valley of\nRephaim.\nDavid was then in the stronghold, and\nthe garrison of the Philistines was then\nin Bethlehem.\nAnd David said with longing, \"Oh, that\nsomeone would give me a drink of water\nfrom the well of Bethlehem, which is by\nthe gate!\"\nNow these were the heads of the\nmighty men whom David had, who\nstrengthened themselves with him in his\nkingdom, with all Israel, to make him\nking, according to the word of the LORD\nconcerning Israel.\nSo the three broke through the camp\nof the Philistines, drew water from the\nwell of Bethlehem that was by the gate,\nand took it and brought it to David.\nNevertheless David would not drink it,\nbut poured it out to the LORD.\nAnd this is the number of the mighty\nmen whom David had: Jashobeam the\nson of a Hachmonite, chief of the\ncaptains; he had lifted up his spear\nagainst three hundred, killed by him at\none time.\nAfter him was Eleazar the son of Dodo,\nthe Ahohite, who was one of the three\nmighty men.\nAnd he said, \"Far be it from me, O my\nGod, that I should do this! Shall I drink\nthe blood of these men who have put\ntheir lives in jeopardy? For at the risk of\ntheir lives they brought it.\" Therefore he\nwould not drink it. These things were\ndone by the three mighty men.\nAbishai the brother of Joab was chief\nof another three. He had lifted up his\nspear against three hundred men, killed\nthem, and won a name among these\nthree.\nSibbechai the Hushathite, Ilai the\nAhohite,\nOf the three he was more honored\nthan the other two men. Therefore he\nbecame their captain. However he did\nnot attain to the first three.\nBenaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the\nson of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who\nhad done many deeds. He had killed\ntwo lion-like heroes of Moab. He also\nhad gone down and killed a lion in the\nmidst of a pit on a snowy day.\nAnd he killed an Egyptian, a man of\ngreat height, five cubits tall. In the\nEgyptian's hand there was a spear like a\nweaver's beam; and he went down to\nhim with a staff, wrested the spear out of\nthe Egyptian's hand, and killed him with\nhis own spear.\nThese things Benaiah the son of\nJehoiada did, and won a name among\nthree mighty men.\nIndeed he was more honored than the\nthirty, but he did not attain to the first\nthree. And David appointed him over his\nguard.\nMaharai the Netophathite, Heled the\nson of Baanah the Netophathite,\nIthai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, of the\nsons of Benjamin, Benaiah the\nPirathonite,\nHurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the\nArbathite,\nAzmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the\nShaalbonite,\nthe sons of Hashem the Gizonite,\nJonathan the son of Shageh the\nHararite,\nAhiam the son of Sacar the Hararite,\nEliphal the son of Ur,\nHepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the\nPelonite,\nHezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of\nEzbai,\nJoel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the\nson of Hagri,\nAlso the mighty warriors were Asahel\nthe brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of\nDodo of Bethlehem,\nZelek the Ammonite, Naharai the\nBerothite (the armorbearer of Joab the\nson of Zeruiah),\nShammoth the Harorite, Helez the\nPelonite,\nIra the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,\nAbiezer the Anathothite,\nIra the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,\nUriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of\nAhlai,\nAdina the son of Shiza the Reubenite\n(a chief of the Reubenites) and thirty\nwith him,\nEluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah,\nand Shephatiah the Haruphite;\nHanan the son of Maachah, Joshaphat\nthe Mithnite,\nElkanah, Jisshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and\nJashobeam, the Korahites;\nUzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and\nJeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,\nand Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of\nJeroham of Gedor.\nEliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and\nJoshaviah the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah\nthe Moabite,\nSome Gadites joined David at the\nstronghold in the wilderness, mighty\nmen of valor, men trained for battle, who\ncould handle shield and spear, whose\nfaces were like the faces of lions, and\nwere as swift as gazelles on the\nmountains:\nJediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his\nbrother, the Tizite,\nEliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.\n12Now these were the men who\ncame to David at Ziklag while he was\nstill a fugitive from Saul the son of Kish;\nand they were among the mighty men,\nhelpers in the war,\nEzer the first, Obadiah the second,\nEliab the third,\nMishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the\nfifth,\nAttai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,\nJohanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,\narmed with bows, using both the right\nhand and the left in hurling stones and\nshooting arrows with the bow. They\nwere of Benjamin, Saul's brethren.\nThe chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the\nsons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel\nand Pelet the sons of Azmaveth;\nBerachah, and Jehu the Anathothite;\nIshmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man\namong the thirty, and over the thirty;\nJeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and\nJozabad the Gederathite;\nJeremiah the tenth, and Machbanai\nthe eleventh.\nThese were from the sons of Gad,\ncaptains of the army; the least was over\na hundred, and the greatest was over a\nthousand.\nThese are the ones who crossed the\nJordan in the first month, when it had\noverflowed all its banks; and they put to\nflight all those in the valleys, to the east\nand to the west.\nThen some of the sons of Benjamin\nand Judah came to David at the\nstronghold.\nAnd David went out to meet them, and\nanswered and said to them, \"If you have\ncome peaceably to me to help me, my\nheart will be united with you; but if to\nbetray me to my enemies, since there is\nno wrong in my hands, may the God of\nour fathers look and bring judgment.\"\nThen the Spirit came upon Amasai,\nchief of the captains, and he said: \"We\nare yours, O David; We are on your side,\nO son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you,\nAnd peace to your helpers! For your\nGod helps you.\" So David received them,\nand made them captains of the troop.\nAnd some from Manasseh defected to\nDavid when he was going with the\nPhilistines to battle against Saul; but\nthey did not help them, for the lords of\nthe Philistines sent him away by\nagreement, saying, \"He may defect to\nhis master Saul and endanger our\nheads.\"\nWhen he went to Ziklag, those of\nManasseh who defected to him were\nAdnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael,\nJozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of\nthe thousands who were from\nManasseh.\nAnd they helped David against the\nbands of raiders, for they were all\nmighty men of valor, and they were\ncaptains in the army.\nFor at that time they came to David\nday by day to help him, until it was a\ngreat army, like the army of God.\nNow these were the numbers of the\ndivisions that were equipped for war,\nand came to David at Hebron to turn\nover the kingdom of Saul to him,\naccording to the word of the LORD:\nof the sons of Judah bearing shield\nand spear, six thousand eight hundred\narmed for war;\nof the sons of Simeon, mighty men of\nvalor fit for war, seven thousand one\nhundred;\nof the sons of Levi four thousand six\nhundred;\nJehoiada, the leader of the Aaronites,\nand with him three thousand seven\nhundred;\nZadok, a young man, a valiant warrior,\nand from his father's house twenty-two\ncaptains;\nof the sons of Benjamin, relatives of\nSaul, three thousand (until then the\ngreatest part of them had remained loyal\nto the house of Saul);\nof the sons of Ephraim twenty\nthousand eight hundred, mighty men of\nvalor, famous men throughout their\nfather's house;\nof the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen\nthousand, who were designated by\nname to come and make David king;\nof the sons of Issachar who had\nunderstanding of the times, to know\nwhat Israel ought to do, their chiefs were\ntwo hundred; and all their brethren were\nat their command;\nand oxen and sheep abundantly, for\nthere was joy in Israel.\n13Then David consulted with the\nof Zebulun there were fifty thousand\nwho went out to battle, expert in war\nwith all weapons of war, stouthearted\nmen who could keep ranks;\nof Naphtali one thousand captains,\nand with them thirty-seven thousand\nwith shield and spear;\nof the Danites who could keep battle\nformation, twenty-eight thousand six\nhundred;\nof Asher, those who could go out to\nwar, able to keep battle formation, forty\nthousand;\nof the Reubenites and the Gadites and\nthe half-tribe of Manasseh, from the\nother side of the Jordan, one hundred\nand twenty thousand armed for battle\nwith every kind of weapon of war.\ncaptains of thousands and hundreds,\nand with every leader.\nAnd David said to all the assembly of\nIsrael, \"If it seems good to you, and if it\nis of the LORD our God, let us send out\nto our brethren everywhere who are left\nin all the land of Israel, and with them to\nthe priests and Levites who are in their\ncities and their common-lands, that they\nmay gather together to us;\nand let us bring the ark of our God back\nto us, for we have not inquired at it since\nthe days of Saul.\"\nThen all the assembly said that they\nwould do so, for the thing was right in\nthe eyes of all the people.\nAll these men of war, who could keep\nranks, came to Hebron with a loyal heart,\nto make David king over all Israel; and\nall the rest of Israel were of one mind to\nmake David king.\nAnd they were there with David three\ndays, eating and drinking, for their\nbrethren had prepared for them.\nMoreover those who were near to\nthem, from as far away as Issachar and\nZebulun and Naphtali, were bringing\nfood on donkeys and camels, on mules\nand oxen--provisions of flour and cakes\nof figs and cakes of raisins, wine and oil\nSo David gathered all Israel together,\nfrom Shihor in Egypt to as far as the\nentrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of\nGod from Kirjath Jearim.\nAnd David and all Israel went up to\nBaalah, to Kirjath Jearim, which\nbelonged to Judah, to bring up from\nthere the ark of God the LORD, who\ndwells between the cherubim, where His\nname is proclaimed.\nSo they carried the ark of God on a\nnew cart from the house of Abinadab,\nand Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.\nThen David and all Israel played music\nbefore God with all their might, with\nsinging, on harps, on stringed\ninstruments,\non\ntambourines,\non\ncymbals, and with trumpets.\nThen David took more wives in\nJerusalem, and David begot more sons\nand daughters.\nAnd when they came to Chidon's\nthreshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to\nhold the ark, for the oxen stumbled.\nAnd these are the names of his children\nwhom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua,\nShobab, Nathan, Solomon,\nThen the anger of the LORD was\naroused against Uzza, and He struck\nhim because he put his hand to the ark;\nand he died there before God.\nIbhar, Elishua, Elpelet,\nNogah, Nepheg, Japhia,\nAnd David became angry because of\nthe LORD's outbreak against Uzza;\ntherefore that place is called Perez Uzza\nto this day.\nDavid was afraid of God that day,\nsaying, \"How can I bring the ark of God\nto me?\"\nSo David would not move the ark with\nhim into the City of David, but took it\naside into the house of Obed-Edom the\nGittite.\nThe ark of God remained with the\nfamily of Obed-Edom in his house three\nmonths. And the LORD blessed the\nhouse of Obed-Edom and all that he\nhad.\n14Now Hiram king of Tyre sent\nmessengers to David, and cedar trees,\nwith masons and carpenters, to build\nhim a house.\nSo David knew that the LORD had\nestablished him as king over Israel, for\nhis kingdom was highly exalted for the\nsake of His people Israel.\nElishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.\nNow when the Philistines heard that\nDavid had been anointed king over all\nIsrael, all the Philistines went up to\nsearch for David. And David heard of it\nand went out against them.\nThen the Philistines went and made a\nraid on the Valley of Rephaim.\nAnd David inquired of God, saying,\n\"Shall I go up against the Philistines?\nWill You deliver them into my hand?\"\nThe LORD said to him, \"Go up, for I will\ndeliver them into your hand.\"\nSo they went up to Baal Perazim, and\nDavid defeated them there. Then David\nsaid, \"God has broken through my\nenemies\nby\nmy\nhand\nlike\na\nbreakthrough of water.\" Therefore they\ncalled the name of that place Baal\nPerazim.\nAnd when they left their gods there,\nDavid gave a commandment, and they\nwere burned with fire.\nThen the Philistines once again made\na raid on the valley.\nTherefore David inquired again of God,\nand God said to him, \"You shall not go\nup after them; circle around them, and\ncome upon them in front of the mulberry\ntrees.\nAnd it shall be, when you hear a sound\nof marching in the tops of the mulberry\ntrees, then you shall go out to battle, for\nGod has gone out before you to strike\nthe camp of the Philistines.\"\nof the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief,\nand two hundred and twenty of his\nbrethren;\nof the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief,\nand one hundred and thirty of his\nbrethren;\nof the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the\nchief, and two hundred of his brethren;\nSo David did as God commanded him,\nand they drove back the army of the\nPhilistines from Gibeon as far as Gezer.\nThen the fame of David went out into\nall lands, and the LORD brought the fear\nof him upon all nations.\n15David built houses for himself in\nthe City of David; and he prepared a\nplace for the ark of God, and pitched a\ntent for it.\nThen David said, \"No one may carry\nthe ark of God but the Levites, for the\nLORD has chosen them to carry the ark\nof God and to minister before Him\nforever.\"\nAnd David gathered all Israel together\nat Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the\nLORD to its place, which he had\nprepared for it.\nThen David assembled the children of\nAaron and the Levites:\nof the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief,\nand one hundred and twenty of his\nbrethren;\nof the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief,\nand eighty of his brethren;\nof the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the\nchief, and one hundred and twelve of his\nbrethren.\nAnd David called for Zadok and\nAbiathar the priests, and for the Levites:\nfor Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel,\nand Amminadab.\nHe said to them, \"You are the heads of\nthe fathers' houses of the Levites;\nsanctify yourselves, you and your\nbrethren, that you may bring up the ark\nof the LORD God of Israel to the place I\nhave prepared for it.\nFor because you did not do it the first\ntime, the LORD our God broke out\nagainst us, because we did not consult\nHim about the proper order.\"\nSo the priests and the Levites\nsanctified themselves to bring up the ark\nof the LORD God of Israel.\nAnd the children of the Levites bore\nthe ark of God on their shoulders, by its\npoles, as Moses had commanded\naccording to the word of the LORD.\nThen David spoke to the leaders of the\nLevites to appoint their brethren to be\nthe singers accompanied by instruments\nof music, stringed instruments, harps,\nand cymbals, by raising the voice with\nresounding joy.\nObed-Edom and Jehiah, doorkeepers\nfor the ark.\nSo David, the elders of Israel, and the\ncaptains over thousands went to bring\nup the ark of the covenant of the LORD\nfrom the house of Obed-Edom with joy.\nSo the Levites appointed Heman the\nson of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph\nthe son of Berechiah; and of their\nbrethren, the sons of Merari, Ethan the\nson of Kushaiah;\nAnd so it was, when God helped the\nLevites who bore the ark of the\ncovenant of the LORD, that they offered\nseven bulls and seven rams.\nand with them their brethren of the\nsecond rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel,\nShemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab,\nBenaiah,\nMaaseiah,\nMattithiah,\nElipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and\nJeiel, the gatekeepers;\nDavid was clothed with a robe of fine\nlinen, as were all the Levites who bore\nthe ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the\nmusic master with the singers.

Then they\noffered burnt offerings and peace\nofferings before God.\nAnd when David had finished offering\nthe burnt offerings and the peace\nofferings, he blessed the people in the\nname of the LORD.\nRemember His marvelous works\nwhich He has done, His wonders, and\nthe judgments of His mouth,\nThen he distributed to everyone of\nIsrael, both man and woman, to\neveryone a loaf of bread, a piece of\nmeat, and a cake of raisins.\nO seed of Israel His servant, You\nchildren of Jacob, His chosen ones!\nAnd he appointed some of the Levites\nto minister before the ark of the LORD,\nto commemorate, to thank, and to praise\nthe LORD God of Israel:\nAsaph the chief, and next to him\nZechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth,\nJehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, and\nObed-Edom:\nJeiel\nwith\nstringed\ninstruments and harps, but Asaph made\nmusic with cymbals;\nBenaiah and Jahaziel the priests\nregularly blew the trumpets before the\nark of the covenant of God.\nOn that day David first delivered this\npsalm into the hand of Asaph and his\nbrethren, to thank the LORD:\nOh, give thanks to the LORD!

And what is my house,\nthat You have brought me this far?\nAnd yet this was a small thing in Your\nsight, O God; and You have also spoken\nof Your servant's house for a great while\nto come, and have regarded me\naccording to the rank of a man of high\ndegree, O LORD God.\nWhat more can David say to You for\nthe honor of Your servant?

Also\nDavid hamstrung all the chariot horses,\nexcept that he spared enough of them\nfor one hundred chariots.\nWhen the Syrians of Damascus came\nto help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David\nkilled twenty-two\nSyrians.\nthousand\nof\nthe\nThen David put garrisons in Syria of\nDamascus; and the Syrians became\nDavid's servants, and brought tribute.\nSo the LORD preserved David wherever\nhe went.\nHe also put garrisons in Edom, and all\nthe Edomites became David's servants.\nAnd the LORD preserved David\nwherever he went.\nSo David reigned over all Israel, and\nadministered judgment and justice to all\nhis people.\nAnd David took the shields of gold that\nwere on the servants of Hadadezer, and\nbrought them to Jerusalem.\nJoab the son of Zeruiah was over the\narmy; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud\nwas recorder;\nAlso from Tibhath and from Chun, cities\nof Hadadezer, David brought a large\namount of bronze, with which Solomon\nmade the bronze Sea, the pillars, and\nthe articles of bronze.\nZadok the son of Ahitub and\nAbimelech the son of Abiathar were the\npriests; Shavsha was the scribe;\nBenaiah the son of Jehoiada was over\nthe Cherethites and the Pelethites; and\nDavid's sons were chief ministers at the\nking's side.\n19It happened after this that Nahash\nNow when Tou king of Hamath heard\nthat David had defeated all the army of\nHadadezer king of Zobah,\nhe sent Hadoram his son to King\nDavid, to greet him and bless him,\nbecause he had fought against\nHadadezer and defeated him (for\nHadadezer had been at war with Tou);\nand Hadoram brought with him all kinds\nof articles of gold, silver, and bronze.\nKing David also dedicated these to the\nLORD, along with the silver and gold\nthat he had brought from all these\nnations--from Edom, from Moab, from\nthe people of Ammon, from the\nPhilistines, and from Amalek.\nMoreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah\nkilled eighteen thousand Edomites in the\nValley of Salt.\nthe king of the people of Ammon died,\nand his son reigned in his place.\nThen David said, \"I will show kindness\nto Hanun the son of Nahash, because\nhis father showed kindness to me.\" So\nDavid sent messengers to comfort him\nconcerning his father. And David's\nservants came to Hanun in the land of\nthe people of Ammon to comfort him.\nAnd the princes of the people of\nAmmon said to Hanun, \"Do you think\nthat David really honors your father\nbecause he has sent comforters to you?\nDid his servants not come to you to\nsearch and to overthrow and to spy out\nthe land?\"\nTherefore Hanun took David's servants,\nshaved them, and cut off their garments\nin the middle, at their buttocks, and sent\nthem away.\nbrother, and they set themselves in\nbattle array against the people of\nAmmon.\nThen some went and told David about\nthe men; and he sent to meet them,\nbecause the men were greatly ashamed.\nAnd the king said, \"Wait at Jericho until\nyour beards have grown, and then\nreturn.\"\nWhen the people of Ammon saw that\nthey had made themselves repulsive to\nDavid, Hanun and the people of Ammon\nsent a thousand talents of silver to hire\nfor themselves chariots and horsemen\nfrom Mesopotamia, from Syrian Maacah,\nand from Zobah.\nSo they hired for themselves thirty-two\nthousand chariots, with the king of\nMaacah and his people, who came and\nencamped before Medeba. Also the\npeople of Ammon gathered together\nfrom their cities, and came to battle.\nThen he said, \"If the Syrians are too\nstrong for me, then you shall help me;\nbut if the people of Ammon are too\nstrong for you, then I will help you.\nBe of good courage, and let us be\nstrong for our people and for the cities of\nour God. And may the LORD do what is\ngood in His sight.\"\nSo Joab and the people who were with\nhim drew near for the battle against the\nSyrians, and they fled before him.\nWhen the people of Ammon saw that\nthe Syrians were fleeing, they also fled\nbefore Abishai his brother, and entered\nthe city. So Joab went to Jerusalem.\nNow when David heard of it, he sent\nJoab and all the army of the mighty men.\nNow when the Syrians saw that they\nhad been defeated by Israel, they sent\nmessengers and brought the Syrians\nwho were beyond the River, and\nShophach\nthe\ncommander\nof\nHadadezer's army went before them.\nThen the people of Ammon came out\nand put themselves in battle array\nbefore the gate of the city, and the kings\nwho had come were by themselves in\nthe field.\nWhen Joab saw that the battle line\nwas against him before and behind, he\nchose some of Israel's best, and put\nthem in battle array against the Syrians.\nAnd the rest of the people he put\nunder the command of Abishai his\nWhen it was told David, he gathered\nall Israel, crossed over the Jordan and\ncame upon them, and set up in battle\narray against them. So when David had\nset up in battle array against the Syrians,\nthey fought with him.\nThen the Syrians fled before Israel;\nand David killed seven thousand\ncharioteers and forty thousand foot\nsoldiers of the Syrians, and killed\nShophach the commander of the army.\nAnd when the servants of Hadadezer\nsaw that they were defeated by Israel,\nthey made peace with David and\nbecame his servants. So the Syrians\nwere not willing to help the people of\nAmmon anymore.\nYet again there was war at Gath, where\nthere was a man of great stature, with\ntwenty-four fingers and toes, six on each\nhand and six on each foot; and he also\nwas born to the giant.\n20It happened in the spring of the\nyear, at the time kings go out to battle,\nthat Joab led out the armed forces and\nravaged the country of the people of\nAmmon, and came and besieged\nRabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem.\nAnd Joab defeated Rabbah and\noverthrew it.\nThen David took their king's crown from\nhis head, and found it to weigh a talent\nof gold, and there were precious stones\nin it. And it was set on David's head.\nAlso he brought out the spoil of the city\nin great abundance.\nAnd he brought out the people who\nwere in it, and put them to work with\nsaws, with iron picks, and with axes. So\nDavid did to all the cities of the people of\nAmmon. Then David and all the people\nreturned to Jerusalem.\nNow it happened afterward that war\nbroke out at Gezer with the Philistines,\nat which time Sibbechai the Hushathite\nkilled Sippai, who was one of the sons\nof the giant. And they were subdued.\nAgain there was war with the Philistines,\nand Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi\nthe brother of Goliath the Gittite, the\nshaft of whose spear was like a\nweaver's beam.\nSo when he defied Israel, Jonathan the\nson of Shimea, David's brother, killed\nhim.\nThese were born to the giant in Gath,\nand they fell by the hand of David and\nby the hand of his servants.\n21Now Satan stood up against Israel,\nand moved David to number Israel.\nSo David said to Joab and to the\nleaders of the people, \"Go, number\nIsrael from Beersheba to Dan, and bring\nthe number of them to me that I may\nknow it.\"\nAnd Joab answered, \"May the LORD\nmake His people a hundred times more\nthan they are. But, my lord the king, are\nthey not all my lord's servants? Why\nthen does my lord require this thing?\nWhy should he be a cause of guilt in\nIsrael?\"\nNevertheless the king's word prevailed\nagainst Joab. Therefore Joab departed\nand went throughout all Israel and came\nto Jerusalem.\nThen Joab gave the sum of the number\nof the people to David. All Israel had\none million one hundred thousand men\nwho drew the sword, and Judah had\nfour hundred and seventy thousand men\nwho drew the sword.\nBut he did not count Levi and Benjamin\namong them, for the king's word was\nabominable to Joab.\nSo the LORD sent a plague upon\nIsrael, and seventy thousand men of\nIsrael fell.\nAnd God was displeased with this\nthing; therefore He struck Israel.\nSo David said to God, \"I have sinned\ngreatly, because I have done this thing;\nbut now, I pray, take away the iniquity of\nYour servant, for I have done very\nfoolishly.\"\nAnd God sent an angel to Jerusalem\nto destroy it. As he was destroying, the\nLORD looked and relented of the\ndisaster, and said to the angel who was\ndestroying, \"It is enough; now restrain\nyour hand.\" And the angel of the LORD\nstood by the threshing floor of Ornan the\nJebusite.\nThen the LORD spoke to Gad, David's\nseer, saying,\n\"Go and tell David, saying, \"Thus says\nthe LORD: \"I offer you three things;\nchoose one of them for yourself, that I\nmay do it to you.\"\"'\nSo Gad came to David and said to him,\n\"Thus says the LORD: \"Choose for\nyourself,\neither three years of famine, or three\nmonths to be defeated by your foes with\nthe sword of your enemies overtaking\nyou, or else for three days the sword of\nthe LORD--the plague in the land, with\nthe angel of the LORD destroying\nthroughout all the territory of Israel.' Now\nconsider what answer I should take\nback to Him who sent me.\"\nAnd David said to Gad, \"I am in great\ndistress. Please let me fall into the hand\nof the LORD, for His mercies are very\ngreat; but do not let me fall into the hand\nof man.\"\nThen David lifted his eyes and saw the\nangel of the LORD standing between\nearth and heaven, having in his hand a\ndrawn sword stretched out over\nJerusalem. So David and the elders,\nclothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.\nAnd David said to God, \"Was it not I\nwho commanded the people to be\nnumbered? I am the one who has\nsinned and done evil indeed; but these\nsheep, what have they done? Let Your\nhand, I pray, O LORD my God, be\nagainst me and my father's house, but\nnot against Your people that they should\nbe plagued.\"\nTherefore, the angel of the LORD\ncommanded Gad to say to David that\nDavid should go and erect an altar to\nthe LORD on the threshing floor of\nOrnan the Jebusite.\nSo David went up at the word of Gad,\nwhich he had spoken in the name of the\nLORD.\nNow Ornan turned and saw the angel;\nand his four sons who were with him hid\nthemselves, but Ornan continued\nthreshing wheat.\nSo David came to Ornan, and Ornan\nlooked and saw David. And he went out\nfrom the threshing floor, and bowed\nbefore David with his face to the ground.\nFor the tabernacle of the LORD and\nthe altar of the burnt offering, which\nMoses had made in the wilderness,\nwere at that time at the high place in\nGibeon.\nThen David said to Ornan, \"Grant me\nthe place of this threshing floor, that I\nmay build an altar on it to the LORD.\nYou shall grant it to me at the full price,\nthat the plague may be withdrawn from\nthe people.\"\nBut Ornan said to David, \"Take it to\nyourself, and let my lord the king do\nwhat is good in his eyes. Look, I also\ngive you the oxen for burnt offerings, the\nthreshing implements for wood, and the\nwheat for the grain offering; I give it all.\"\nThen King David said to Ornan, \"No,\nbut I will surely buy it for the full price,\nfor I will not take what is yours for the\nLORD, nor offer burnt offerings with that\nwhich costs me nothing.\"\nSo David gave Ornan six hundred\nshekels of gold by weight for the place.\nAnd David built there an altar to the\nLORD, and offered burnt offerings and\npeace offerings, and called on the\nLORD; and He answered him from\nheaven by fire on the altar of burnt\noffering.\nSo the LORD commanded the angel,\nand he returned his sword to its sheath.\nAt that time, when David saw that the\nLORD had answered him on the\nthreshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he\nsacrificed there.\nBut David could not go before it to\ninquire of God, for he was afraid of the\nsword of the angel of the LORD.\n22Then David said, \"This is the\nhouse of the LORD God, and this is the\naltar of burnt offering for Israel.\"\nSo David commanded to gather the\naliens who were in the land of Israel;\nand he appointed masons to cut hewn\nstones to build the house of God.\nAnd David prepared iron in abundance\nfor the nails of the doors of the gates\nand for the joints, and bronze in\nabundance beyond measure,\nand cedar trees in abundance; for the\nSidonians and those from Tyre brought\nmuch cedar wood to David.\nNow David said, \"Solomon my son is\nyoung and inexperienced, and the\nhouse to be built for the LORD must be\nexceedingly magnificent, famous and\nglorious throughout all countries. I will\nnow make preparation for it.\" So David\nmade abundant preparations before his\ndeath.\nThen he called for his son Solomon,\nand charged him to build a house for the\nLORD God of Israel.\nAnd David said to Solomon: \"My son,\nas for me, it was in my mind to build a\nhouse to the name of the LORD my\nGod;\nhundred thousand talents of gold and\none million talents of silver, and bronze\nand iron beyond measure, for it is so\nabundant. I have prepared timber and\nstone also, and you may add to them.\nbut the word of the LORD came to me,\nsaying, \"You have shed much blood and\nhave made great wars; you shall not\nbuild a house for My name, because\nyou have shed much blood on the earth\nin My sight.\nMoreover there are workmen with you\nin\nabundance:\nwoodsmen\nand\nstonecutters, and all types of skillful men\nfor every kind of work.\nBehold, a son shall be born to you, who\nshall be a man of rest; and I will give\nhim rest from all his enemies all around.\nHis name shall be Solomon, for I will\ngive peace and quietness to Israel in his\ndays.\nOf gold and silver and bronze and iron\nthere is no limit.

For all things come\nfrom You, And of Your own we have\ngiven You.\nFor we are aliens and pilgrims before\nYou, As were all our fathers; Our days\non earth are as a shadow, And without\nhope.\nAnd whoever had precious stones gave\nthem to the treasury of the house of the\nLORD, into the hand of Jehiel the\nGershonite.\n\"O LORD our God, all this abundance\nthat we have prepared to build You a\nhouse for Your holy name is from Your\nhand, and is all Your own.\nThen the people rejoiced, for they had\noffered willingly, because with a loyal\nheart they had offered willingly to the\nLORD; and King David also rejoiced\ngreatly.\nI know also, my God, that You test the\nheart and have pleasure in uprightness.\nAs for me, in the uprightness of my\nheart I have willingly offered all these\nthings; and now with joy I have seen\nYour people, who are present here to\noffer willingly to You.\nO LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and\nIsrael, our fathers, keep this forever in\nthe intent of the thoughts of the heart of\nYour people, and fix their heart toward\nYou.\nAnd give my son Solomon a loyal\nheart to keep Your commandments and\nYour testimonies and Your statutes, to\ndo all these things, and to build the\ntemple for which I have made provision.\"\nThen David said to all the assembly,\n\"Now bless the LORD your God.\" So all\nthe assembly blessed the LORD God of\ntheir fathers, and bowed their heads and\nprostrated themselves before the LORD\nand the king.\nAnd they made sacrifices to the LORD\nand offered burnt offerings to the LORD\non the next day: a thousand bulls, a\nthousand rams, a thousand lambs, with\ntheir drink offerings, and sacrifices in\nabundance for all Israel.\nSo they ate and drank before the\nLORD with great gladness on that day.\nAnd they made Solomon the son of\nDavid king the second time, and\nanointed him before the LORD to be the\nleader, and Zadok to be priest.\nThen Solomon sat on the throne of the\nLORD as king instead of David his\nfather, and prospered; and all Israel\nobeyed him.\nAll the leaders and the mighty men,\nand also all the sons of King David,\nsubmitted themselves to King Solomon.\nSo the LORD exalted Solomon\nexceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and\nbestowed on him such royal majesty as\nhad not been on any king before him in\nIsrael.\nThus David the son of Jesse reigned\nover all Israel.\nAnd the period that he reigned over\nIsrael was forty years; seven years he\nreigned in Hebron, and thirty-three years\nhe reigned in Jerusalem.\nSo he died in a good old age, full of\ndays and riches and honor; and\nSolomon his son reigned in his place.\nNow the acts of King David, first and\nlast, indeed they are written in the book\nof Samuel the seer, in the book of\nNathan the prophet, and in the book of\nGad the seer,\nwith all his reign and his might, and the\nevents that happened to him, to Israel,\nand to all the kingdoms of the lands.\n2nd Chronicles\n1Now Solomon the son of David was\nstrengthened in his kingdom, and the\nLORD his God was with him and exalted\nhim exceedingly.\nAnd Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the\ncaptains of thousands and of hundreds,\nto the judges, and to every leader in all\nIsrael, the heads of the fathers' houses.\nThen Solomon, and all the assembly\nwith him, went to the high place that was\nat Gibeon; for the tabernacle of meeting\nwith God was there, which Moses the\nservant of the LORD had made in the\nwilderness.\nBut David had brought up the ark of\nGod from Kirjath Jearim to the place\nDavid had prepared for it, for he had\npitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.\nNow the bronze altar that Bezalel the\nson of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he\nput before the tabernacle of the LORD;\nSolomon and the assembly sought Him\nthere.\nAnd Solomon went up there to the\nbronze altar before the LORD, which\nwas at the tabernacle of meeting, and\noffered a thousand burnt offerings on it.\nOn that night God appeared to\nSolomon, and said to him, \"Ask! What\nshall I give you?\"\nAnd Solomon said to God: \"You have\nshown great mercy to David my father,\nand have made me king in his place.\nNow, O LORD God, let Your promise to\nDavid my father be established, for You\nhave made me king over a people like\nthe dust of the earth in multitude.\nNow give me wisdom and knowledge,\nthat I may go out and come in before\nthis people; for who can judge this great\npeople of Yours?\"\nThen God said to Solomon: \"Because\nthis was in your heart, and you have not\nasked riches or wealth or honor or the\nlife of your enemies, nor have you asked\nlong life--but have asked wisdom and\nknowledge for yourself, that you may\njudge My people over whom I have\nmade you king-12\nwisdom and knowledge are granted to\nyou; and I will give you riches and\nwealth and honor, such as none of the\nkings have had who were before you,\nnor shall any after you have the like.\"\nSo Solomon came to Jerusalem from\nthe high place that was at Gibeon, from\nbefore the tabernacle of meeting, and\nreigned over Israel.\nAnd Solomon gathered chariots and\nhorsemen; he had one thousand four\nhundred chariots and twelve thousand\nhorsemen, whom he stationed in the\nchariot cities and with the king in\nJerusalem.\nAlso the king made silver and gold as\ncommon in Jerusalem as stones, and he\nmade cedars as abundant as the\nsycamores which are in the lowland.\nAnd the temple which I build will be\ngreat, for our God is greater than all\ngods.\nAnd Solomon had horses imported\nfrom Egypt and Keveh; the king's\nmerchants bought them in Keveh at the\ncurrent price.\nBut who is able to build Him a temple,\nsince heaven and the heaven of\nheavens cannot contain Him? Who am I\nthen, that I should build Him a temple,\nexcept to burn sacrifice before Him?\nThey also acquired and imported from\nEgypt a chariot for six hundred shekels\nof silver, and a horse for one hundred\nand fifty; thus, through their agents, they\nexported them to all the kings of the\nHittites and the kings of Syria.\n2Then Solomon determined to build a\ntemple for the name of the LORD, and a\nroyal house for himself.\nSolomon selected seventy thousand\nmen to bear burdens, eighty thousand to\nquarry stone in the mountains, and three\nthousand six hundred to oversee them.\nThen Solomon sent to Hiram king of\nTyre, saying: 4 As you have dealt with\nDavid my father, and sent him cedars to\nbuild himself a house to dwell in, so deal\nwith me.\nBehold, I am building a temple for the\nname of the LORD my God, to dedicate\nit to Him, to burn before Him sweet\nincense, for the continual showbread,\nfor the burnt offerings morning and\nevening, on the Sabbaths, on the New\nMoons, and on the set feasts of the\nLORD our God. This is an ordinance\nforever to Israel.\nTherefore send me at once a man\nskillful to work in gold and silver, in\nbronze and iron, in purple and crimson\nand blue, who has skill to engrave with\nthe skillful men who are with me in\nJudah and Jerusalem, whom David my\nfather provided.\nAlso send me cedar and cypress and\nalgum logs from Lebanon, for I know\nthat your servants have skill to cut\ntimber in Lebanon; and indeed my\nservants will be with your servants,\nto prepare timber for me in abundance,\nfor the temple which I am about to build\nshall be great and wonderful.\nAnd indeed I will give to your servants,\nthe woodsmen who cut timber, twenty\nthousand kors of ground wheat, twenty\nthousand kors of barley, twenty\nthousand baths of wine, and twenty\nthousand baths of oil.\nThen Hiram king of Tyre answered in\nwriting, which he sent to Solomon: 4\nBecause the LORD loves His people,\nHe has made you king over them.\nHiram also said: 4 Blessed be the\nLORD God of Israel, who made heaven\nand earth, for He has given King David\na wise son, endowed with prudence and\nunderstanding, who will build a temple\nfor the LORD and a royal house for\nhimself!\nAnd now I have sent a skillful man,\nendowed with understanding, Huram my\nmaster craftsman\n3Now Solomon began to build the\nhouse of the LORD at Jerusalem on\nMount Moriah, where the LORD had\nappeared to his father David, at the\nplace that David had prepared on the\nthreshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.\n(the son of a woman of the daughters\nof Dan, and his father was a man of\nTyre), skilled to work in gold and silver,\nbronze and iron, stone and wood, purple\nand blue, fine linen and crimson, and to\nmake any engraving and to accomplish\nany plan which may be given to him,\nwith your skillful men and with the skillful\nmen of my lord David your father.\nNow therefore, the wheat, the barley,\nthe oil, and the wine which my lord has\nspoken of, let him send to his servants.\nAnd we will cut wood from Lebanon,\nas much as you need; we will bring it to\nyou in rafts by sea to Joppa, and you\nwill carry it up to Jerusalem.\nThen Solomon numbered all the aliens\nwho were in the land of Israel, after the\ncensus in which David his father had\nnumbered them; and there were found\nto be one hundred and fifty-three\nthousand six hundred.\nAnd he made seventy thousand of\nthem bearers of burdens, eighty\nthousand stonecutters in the mountain,\nand three thousand six hundred\noverseers to make the people work.\nAnd he began to build on the second\nday of the second month in the fourth\nyear of his reign.\nThis is the foundation which Solomon\nlaid for building the house of God: The\nlength was sixty cubits (by cubits\naccording to the former measure) and\nthe width twenty cubits.\nAnd the vestibule that was in front of\nthe sanctuary was twenty cubits long\nacross the width of the house, and the\nheight was one hundred and twenty. He\noverlaid the inside with pure gold.\nThe larger room he paneled with\ncypress which he overlaid with fine gold,\nand he carved palm trees and\nchainwork on it.\nAnd he decorated the house with\nprecious stones for beauty, and the gold\nwas gold from Parvaim.\nHe also overlaid the house--the beams\nand doorposts, its walls and doors--with\ngold; and he carved cherubim on the\nwalls.\nAnd he made the Most Holy Place. Its\nlength was according to the width of the\nhouse, twenty cubits, and its width\ntwenty cubits. He overlaid it with six\nhundred talents of fine gold.\nThe weight of the nails was fifty shekels\nof gold; and he overlaid the upper area\nwith gold.\nIn the Most Holy Place he made two\ncherubim, fashioned by carving, and\noverlaid them with gold.\nThe wings of the cherubim were\ntwenty cubits in overall length: one wing\nof the one cherub was five cubits,\ntouching the wall of the room, and the\nother wing was five cubits, touching the\nwing of the other cherub;\none wing of the other cherub was five\ncubits, touching the wall of the room,\nand the other wing also was five cubits,\ntouching the wing of the other cherub.\nThe wings of these cherubim spanned\ntwenty cubits overall. They stood on\ntheir feet, and they faced inward.\nAnd he made the veil of blue, purple,\ncrimson, and fine linen, and wove\ncherubim into it.\nAlso he made in front of the temple\ntwo pillars thirty-five cubits high, and the\ncapital that was on the top of each of\nthem was five cubits.\nHe made wreaths of chainwork, as in\nthe inner sanctuary, and put them on top\nof the pillars; and he made one hundred\npomegranates, and put them on the\nwreaths of chainwork.\nthe one on the right hand Jachin, and\nthe name of the one on the left Boaz.\n4Moreover he made a bronze altar:\ntwenty cubits was its length, twenty\ncubits its width, and ten cubits its height.\nThen he made the Sea of cast bronze,\nten cubits from one brim to the other; it\nwas completely round. Its height was\nfive cubits, and a line of thirty cubits\nmeasured its circumference.\nAnd under it was the likeness of oxen\nencircling it all around, ten to a cubit, all\nthe way around the Sea. The oxen were\ncast in two rows, when it was cast.\nIt stood on twelve oxen: three looking\ntoward the north, three looking toward\nthe west, three looking toward the south,\nand three looking toward the east; the\nSea was set upon them, and all their\nback parts pointed inward.\nIt was a handbreadth thick; and its brim\nwas shaped like the brim of a cup, like a\nlily blossom. It contained three thousand\nbaths.\nHe also made ten lavers, and put five\non the right side and five on the left, to\nwash in them; such things as they\noffered for the burnt offering they would\nwash in them, but the Sea was for the\npriests to wash in.\nThen he set up the pillars before the\ntemple, one on the right hand and the\nother on the left; he called the name of\nAnd he made ten lampstands of gold\naccording to their design, and set them\nin the temple, five on the right side and\nfive on the left.\nHe also made ten tables, and placed\nthem in the temple, five on the right side\nand five on the left. And he made one\nhundred bowls of gold.\nIn the plain of Jordan the king had\nthem cast in clay molds, between\nSuccoth and Zeredah.\nFurthermore he made the court of the\npriests, and the great court and doors\nfor the court; and he overlaid these\ndoors with bronze.\nAnd Solomon had all these articles\nmade in such great abundance that the\nweight of the bronze was not\ndetermined.\nHe set the Sea on the right side,\ntoward the southeast.\nThus Solomon had all the furnishings\nmade for the house of God: the altar of\ngold and the tables on which was the\nshowbread;\nThen Huram made the pots and the\nshovels and the bowls. So Huram\nfinished doing the work that he was to\ndo for King Solomon for the house of\nGod:\nthe lampstands with their lamps of\npure gold, to burn in the prescribed\nmanner in front of the inner sanctuary,\nthe two pillars and the bowl-shaped\ncapitals that were on top of the two\npillars; the two networks covering the\ntwo bowl-shaped capitals which were on\ntop of the pillars;\nfour hundred pomegranates for the\ntwo\nnetworks\n(two\nrows\nof\npomegranates for each network, to\ncover the two bowl-shaped capitals that\nwere on the pillars);\nhe also made carts and the lavers on\nthe carts;\none Sea and twelve oxen under it;\nalso the pots, the shovels, the forks-and all their articles Huram his master\ncraftsman made of burnished bronze for\nKing Solomon for the house of the\nLORD.\nwith the flowers and the lamps and the\nwick-trimmers of gold, of purest gold;\nthe trimmers, the bowls, the ladles,\nand the censers of pure gold. As for the\nentry of the sanctuary, its inner doors to\nthe Most Holy Place, and the doors of\nthe main hall of the temple, were gold.\n5So all the work that Solomon had\ndone for the house of the LORD was\nfinished; and Solomon brought in the\nthings which his father David had\ndedicated: the silver and the gold and all\nthe furnishings. And he put them in the\ntreasuries of the house of God.\nNow Solomon assembled the elders of\nIsrael and all the heads of the tribes, the\nchief fathers of the children of Israel, in\nJerusalem, that they might bring the ark\nof the covenant of the LORD up from\nthe City of David, which is Zion.\nTherefore all the men of Israel\nassembled with the king at the feast,\nwhich was in the seventh month.\nSo all the elders of Israel came, and the\nLevites took up the ark.\nThen they brought up the ark, the\ntabernacle of meeting, and all the holy\nfurnishings that were in the tabernacle.\nThe priests and the Levites brought\nthem up.\nAlso King Solomon, and all the\ncongregation of Israel who were\nassembled with him before the ark, were\nsacrificing sheep and oxen that could\nnot be counted or numbered for\nmultitude.\nThen the priests brought in the ark of\nthe covenant of the LORD to its place,\ninto the inner sanctuary of the temple, to\nthe Most Holy Place, under the wings of\nthe cherubim.\nAnd it came to pass when the priests\ncame out of the Most Holy Place (for all\nthe priests who were present had\nsanctified themselves, without keeping\nto their divisions),\nand the Levites who were the singers,\nall those of Asaph and Heman and\nJeduthun, with their sons and their\nbrethren, stood at the east end of the\naltar, clothed in white linen, having\ncymbals, stringed instruments and harps,\nand with them one hundred and twenty\npriests sounding with trumpets-13\nindeed it came to pass, when the\ntrumpeters and singers were as one, to\nmake one sound to be heard in praising\nand thanking the LORD, and when they\nlifted up their voice with the trumpets\nand cymbals and instruments of music,\nand praised the LORD, saying: \"For He\nis good, For His mercy endures forever,\"\nthat the house, the house of the LORD,\nwas filled with a cloud,\nso that the priests could not continue\nministering because of the cloud; for the\nglory of the LORD filled the house of\nGod.\n6Then Solomon spoke: \"The LORD\nFor the cherubim spread their wings\nover the place of the ark, and the\ncherubim overshadowed the ark and its\npoles.\nThe poles extended so that the ends of\nthe poles of the ark could be seen from\nthe holy place, in front of the inner\nsanctuary; but they could not be seen\nfrom outside. And they are there to this\nday.\nNothing was in the ark except the two\ntablets which Moses put there at Horeb,\nwhen the LORD made a covenant with\nthe children of Israel, when they had\ncome out of Egypt.\nsaid He would dwell in the dark cloud.\nI have surely built You an exalted\nhouse, And a place for You to dwell in\nforever.\"\nThen the king turned around and\nblessed the whole assembly of Israel,\nwhile all the assembly of Israel was\nstanding.\nAnd he said: \"Blessed be the LORD\nGod of Israel, who has fulfilled with His\nhands what He spoke with His mouth to\nmy father David, saying,\n\"Since the day that I brought My people\nout of the land of Egypt, I have chosen\nno city from any tribe of Israel in which\nto build a house, that My name might be\nthere, nor did I choose any man to be a\nruler over My people Israel.\nassembly of Israel, and spread out his\nhands\n(for Solomon had made a bronze\nplatform five cubits long, five cubits wide,\nand three cubits high, and had set it in\nthe midst of the court; and he stood on it,\nknelt down on his knees before all the\nassembly of Israel, and spread out his\nhands toward heaven);\nYet I have chosen Jerusalem, that My\nname may be there, and I have chosen\nDavid to be over My people Israel.'\nand he said: \"LORD God of Israel,\nthere is no God in heaven or on earth\nlike You, who keep Your covenant and\nmercy with Your servants who walk\nbefore You with all their hearts.\nNow it was in the heart of my father\nDavid to build a temple for the name of\nthe LORD God of Israel.\nBut the LORD said to my father David,\n\"Whereas it was in your heart to build a\ntemple for My name, you did well in that\nit was in your heart.\nYou have kept what You promised\nYour servant David my father; You have\nboth spoken with Your mouth and\nfulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day.\nNevertheless you shall not build the\ntemple, but your son who will come from\nyour body, he shall build the temple for\nMy name.'\nTherefore, LORD God of Israel, now\nkeep what You promised Your servant\nDavid my father, saying, \"You shall not\nfail to have a man sit before Me on the\nthrone of Israel, only if your sons take\nheed to their way, that they walk in My\nlaw as you have walked before Me.'\nSo the LORD has fulfilled His word\nwhich He spoke, and I have filled the\nposition of my father David, and sit on\nthe throne of Israel, as the LORD\npromised; and I have built the temple for\nthe name of the LORD God of Israel.\nAnd there I have put the ark, in which\nis the covenant of the LORD which He\nmade with the children of Israel.\"\nThen Solomon stood before the altar\nof the LORD in the presence of all the\nAnd now, O LORD God of Israel, let\nYour word come true, which You have\nspoken to Your servant David.\n\"But will God indeed dwell with men on\nthe earth?

So\nthe king and all the people dedicated the\nhouse of God.\nAnd the priests attended to their\nservices; the Levites also with\ninstruments of the music of the LORD,\nwhich King David had made to praise\nthe LORD, saying, \"For His mercy\nendures forever,\" whenever David\noffered praise by their ministry. The\npriests sounded trumpets opposite them,\nwhile all Israel stood.\nFurthermore Solomon consecrated the\nmiddle of the court that was in front of\nthe house of the LORD; for there he\noffered burnt offerings and the fat of the\npeace offerings, because the bronze\naltar which Solomon had made was not\nable to receive the burnt offerings, the\ngrain offerings, and the fat.\nThen the LORD appeared to Solomon\nby night, and said to him: \"I have heard\nyour prayer, and have chosen this place\nfor Myself as a house of sacrifice.\nWhen I shut up heaven and there is no\nrain, or command the locusts to devour\nthe land, or send pestilence among My\npeople,\nif My people who are called by My\nname will humble themselves, and pray\nand seek My face, and turn from their\nwicked ways, then I will hear from\nheaven, and will forgive their sin and\nheal their land.\nNow My eyes will be open and My\nears attentive to prayer made in this\nplace.\nAt that time Solomon kept the feast\nseven days, and all Israel with him, a\nvery great assembly from the entrance\nof Hamath to the Brook of Egypt.\nFor now I have chosen and sanctified\nthis house, that My name may be there\nforever; and My eyes and My heart will\nbe there perpetually.\nAnd on the eighth day they held a\nsacred assembly, for they observed the\ndedication of the altar seven days, and\nthe feast seven days.\nAs for you, if you walk before Me as\nyour father David walked, and do\naccording to all that I have commanded\nyou, and if you keep My statutes and My\njudgments,\nOn the twenty-third day of the seventh\nmonth he sent the people away to their\ntents, joyful and glad of heart for the\ngood that the LORD had done for David,\nfor Solomon, and for His people Israel.\nthen I will establish the throne of your\nkingdom, as I covenanted with David\nyour father, saying, \"You shall not fail to\nhave a man as ruler in Israel.'\nThus Solomon finished the house of\nthe LORD and the king's house; and\nSolomon successfully accomplished all\nthat came into his heart to make in the\nhouse of the LORD and in his own\nhouse.\n\"But if you turn away and forsake My\nstatutes and My commandments which I\nhave set before you, and go and serve\nother gods, and worship them,\nthen I will uproot them from My land\nwhich I have given them; and this house\nwhich I have sanctified for My name I\nwill cast out of My sight, and will make it\na proverb and a byword among all\npeoples.\n\"And as for this house, which is\nexalted, everyone who passes by it will\nbe astonished and say, \"Why has the\nLORD done thus to this land and this\nhouse?'\nThen they will answer, \"Because they\nforsook the LORD God of their fathers,\nwho brought them out of the land of\nEgypt, and embraced other gods, and\nworshiped them and served them;\ntherefore He has brought all this\ncalamity on them.\"'\ncities and the cities of the cavalry, and\nall that Solomon desired to build in\nJerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the\nland of his dominion.\nAll the people who were left of the\nHittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites,\nand Jebusites, who were not of Israel-8\nthat is, their descendants who were left\nin the land after them, whom the\nchildren of Israel did not destroy--from\nthese Solomon raised forced labor, as it\nis to this day.\nBut Solomon did not make the children\nof Israel servants for his work. Some\nwere men of war, captains of his officers,\ncaptains of his chariots, and his cavalry.\n8It came to pass at the end of twenty\nyears, when Solomon had built the\nhouse of the LORD and his own house,\nthat the cities which Hiram had given to\nSolomon, Solomon built them; and he\nsettled the children of Israel there.\nAnd Solomon went to Hamath Zobah\nand seized it.\nHe also built Tadmor in the wilderness,\nand all the storage cities which he built\nin Hamath.\nHe built Upper Beth Horon and Lower\nBeth Horon, fortified cities with walls,\ngates, and bars,\nalso Baalath and all the storage cities\nthat Solomon had, and all the chariot\nAnd others were chiefs of the officials\nof King Solomon: two hundred and fifty,\nwho ruled over the people.\nNow Solomon brought the daughter of\nPharaoh up from the City of David to the\nhouse he had built for her, for he said,\n\"My wife shall not dwell in the house of\nDavid king of Israel, because the places\nto which the ark of the LORD has come\nare holy.\"\nThen Solomon offered burnt offerings\nto the LORD on the altar of the LORD\nwhich he had built before the vestibule,\naccording to the daily rate, offering\naccording to the commandment of\nMoses, for the Sabbaths, the New\nMoons, and the three appointed yearly\nfeasts--the Feast of Unleavened Bread,\nthe Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of\nTabernacles.\nAnd, according to the order of David\nhis father, he appointed the divisions of\nthe priests for their service, the Levites\nfor their duties (to praise and serve\nbefore the priests) as the duty of each\nday required, and the gatekeepers by\ntheir divisions at each gate; for so David\nthe man of God had commanded.\nfor Solomon that he could not explain it\nto her.\nAnd when the queen of Sheba had\nseen the wisdom of Solomon, the house\nthat he had built,\nThey did not depart from the command\nof the king to the priests and Levites\nconcerning any matter or concerning the\ntreasuries.\nthe food on his table, the seating of his\nservants, the service of his waiters and\ntheir apparel, his cupbearers and their\napparel, and his entryway by which he\nwent up to the house of the LORD, there\nwas no more spirit in her.\nNow all the work of Solomon was wellordered from the day of the foundation\nof the house of the LORD until it was\nfinished. So the house of the LORD was\ncompleted.\nThen she said to the king: \"It was a true\nreport which I heard in my own land\nabout your words and your wisdom.\nThen Solomon went to Ezion Geber\nand Elath on the seacoast, in the land of\nEdom.\nHowever I did not believe their words\nuntil I came and saw with my own eyes;\nand indeed the half of the greatness of\nyour wisdom was not told me. You\nexceed the fame of which I heard.\nAnd Hiram sent him ships by the hand\nof his servants, and servants who knew\nthe sea. They went with the servants of\nSolomon to Ophir, and acquired four\nhundred and fifty talents of gold from\nthere, and brought it to King Solomon.\n9Now when the queen of Sheba heard\nof the fame of Solomon, she came to\nJerusalem to test Solomon with hard\nquestions, having a very great retinue,\ncamels that bore spices, gold in\nabundance, and precious stones; and\nwhen she came to Solomon, she spoke\nwith him about all that was in her heart.\nSo Solomon answered all her\nquestions; there was nothing so difficult\nHappy are your men and happy are\nthese your servants, who stand\ncontinually before you and hear your\nwisdom!\nBlessed be the LORD your God, who\ndelighted in you, setting you on His\nthrone to be king for the LORD your\nGod! Because your God has loved\nIsrael, to establish them forever,\ntherefore He made you king over them,\nto do justice and righteousness.\"\nAnd she gave the king one hundred\nand twenty talents of gold, spices in\ngreat abundance, and precious stones;\nthere never were any spices such as\nthose the queen of Sheba gave to King\nSolomon.\nAlso, the servants of Hiram and the\nservants of Solomon, who brought gold\nfrom Ophir, brought algum wood and\nprecious stones.\nThe throne had six steps, with a\nfootstool of gold, which were fastened to\nthe throne; there were armrests on\neither side of the place of the seat, and\ntwo lions stood beside the armrests.\nAnd the king made walkways of the\nalgum wood for the house of the LORD\nand for the king's house, also harps and\nstringed instruments for singers; and\nthere were none such as these seen\nbefore in the land of Judah.\nNow King Solomon gave to the queen\nof Sheba all she desired, whatever she\nasked, much more than she had brought\nto the king. So she turned and went to\nher own country, she and her servants.\nTwelve lions stood there, one on each\nside of the six steps; nothing like this\nhad been made for any other kingdom.\nAll King Solomon's drinking vessels\nwere gold, and all the vessels of the\nHouse of the Forest of Lebanon were\npure gold. Not one was silver, for this\nwas accounted as nothing in the days of\nSolomon.\nThe weight of gold that came to\nSolomon yearly was six hundred and\nsixty-six talents of gold,\nFor the king's ships went to Tarshish\nwith the servants of Hiram. Once every\nthree years the merchant ships came,\nbringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and\nmonkeys.\nbesides what the traveling merchants\nand traders brought. And all the kings of\nArabia and governors of the country\nbrought gold and silver to Solomon.\nSo King Solomon surpassed all the\nkings of the earth in riches and wisdom.\nAnd King Solomon made two hundred\nlarge shields of hammered gold; six\nhundred shekels of hammered gold\nwent into each shield.\nHe also made three hundred shields of\nhammered gold; three hundred shekels\nof gold went into each shield. The king\nput them in the House of the Forest of\nLebanon.\nMoreover the king made a great\nthrone of ivory, and overlaid it with pure\ngold.\nAnd all the kings of the earth sought\nthe presence of Solomon to hear his\nwisdom, which God had put in his heart.\nEach man brought his present: articles\nof silver and gold, garments, armor,\nspices, horses, and mules, at a set rate\nyear by year.\nSolomon had four thousand stalls for\nhorses and chariots, and twelve\nthousand horsemen whom he stationed\nin the chariot cities and with the king at\nJerusalem.\nSo he reigned over all the kings from\nthe River to the land of the Philistines,\nas far as the border of Egypt.\nThe king made silver as common in\nJerusalem as stones, and he made\ncedar trees as abundant as the\nsycamores which are in the lowland.\n\"Your father made our yoke heavy; now\ntherefore, lighten the burdensome\nservice of your father and his heavy\nyoke which he put on us, and we will\nserve you.\"\nSo he said to them, \"Come back to me\nafter three days.\" And the people\ndeparted.\nAnd they brought horses to Solomon\nfrom Egypt and from all lands.\nNow the rest of the acts of Solomon,\nfirst and last, are they not written in the\nbook of Nathan the prophet, in the\nprophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in\nthe visions of Iddo the seer concerning\nJeroboam the son of Nebat?\nSolomon reigned in Jerusalem over all\nIsrael forty years.\nThen Solomon rested with his fathers,\nand was buried in the City of David his\nfather. And Rehoboam his son reigned\nin his place.\n10And Rehoboam went to Shechem,\nfor all Israel had gone to Shechem to\nmake him king.\nSo it happened, when Jeroboam the\nson of Nebat heard it (he was in Egypt,\nwhere he had fled from the presence of\nKing Solomon), that Jeroboam returned\nfrom Egypt.\nThen they sent for him and called him.\nAnd Jeroboam and all Israel came and\nspoke to Rehoboam, saying,\nThen King Rehoboam consulted the\nelders who stood before his father\nSolomon while he still lived, saying,\n\"How do you advise me to answer these\npeople?\"\nAnd they spoke to him, saying, \"If you\nare kind to these people, and please\nthem, and speak good words to them,\nthey will be your servants forever.\"\nBut he rejected the advice which the\nelders had given him, and consulted the\nyoung men who had grown up with him,\nwho stood before him.\nAnd he said to them, \"What advice do\nyou give? How should we answer this\npeople who have spoken to me, saying,\n\"Lighten the yoke which your father put\non us'?\"\nThen the young men who had grown\nup with him spoke to him, saying, \"Thus\nyou should speak to the people who\nhave spoken to you, saying, \"Your father\nmade our yoke heavy, but you make it\nlighter on us'--thus you shall say to\nthem: \"My little finger shall be thicker\nthan my father's waist!\nAnd now, whereas my father put a\nheavy yoke on you, I will add to your\nyoke; my father chastised you with\nwhips, but I will chastise you with\nscourges!\"'\nand he died. Therefore King Rehoboam\nmounted his chariot in haste to flee to\nJerusalem.\nSo Jeroboam and all the people came\nto Rehoboam on the third day, as the\nking had directed, saying, \"Come back\nto me the third day.\"\nThen the king answered them roughly.\nKing Rehoboam rejected the advice of\nthe elders,\nand he spoke to them according to the\nadvice of the young men, saying, \"My\nfather made your yoke heavy, but I will\nadd to it; my father chastised you with\nwhips, but I will chastise you with\nscourges!\"\nSo the king did not listen to the people;\nfor the turn of events was from God, that\nthe LORD might fulfill His word, which\nHe had spoken by the hand of Ahijah\nthe Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of\nNebat.\nNow when all Israel saw that the king\ndid not listen to them, the people\nanswered the king, saying: \"What share\nhave we in David? We have no\ninheritance in the son of Jesse. Every\nman to your tents, O Israel! Now see to\nyour own house, O David!\" So all Israel\ndeparted to their tents.\nSo Israel has been in rebellion against\nthe house of David to this day.\n11Now when Rehoboam came to\nJerusalem, he assembled from the\nhouse of Judah and Benjamin one\nhundred and eighty thousand chosen\nmen who were warriors, to fight against\nIsrael, that he might restore the kingdom\nto Rehoboam.\nBut the word of the LORD came to\nShemaiah the man of God, saying,\n\"Speak to Rehoboam the son of\nSolomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel\nin Judah and Benjamin, saying,\n\"Thus says the LORD: \"You shall not\ngo up or fight against your brethren! Let\nevery man return to his house, for this\nthing is from Me.\"\nSo Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and\nbuilt cities for defense in Judah.\nAnd he built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,\nBeth Zur, Sochoh, Adullam,\nBut Rehoboam reigned over the\nchildren of Israel who dwelt in the cities\nof Judah.\nThen King Rehoboam sent Hadoram,\nwho was in charge of revenue; but the\nchildren of Israel stoned him with stones,\nGath, Mareshah, Ziph,\nAdoraim, Lachish, Azekah,\nZorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are\nin Judah and Benjamin, fortified cities.\nAnd he fortified the strongholds, and\nput captains in them, and stores of food,\noil, and wine.\nAfter her he took Maachah the\ngranddaughter of Absalom; and she\nbore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and\nShelomith.\nAlso in every city he put shields and\nspears, and made them very strong,\nhaving Judah and Benjamin on his side.\nAnd from all their territories the priests\nand the Levites who were in all Israel\ntook their stand with him.\nNow Rehoboam loved Maachah the\ngranddaughter of Absalom more than all\nhis wives and his concubines; for he\ntook\neighteen\nwives\nand\nsixty\nconcubines, and begot twenty-eight\nsons and sixty daughters.\nFor the Levites left their commonlands and their possessions and came\nto Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam\nand his sons had rejected them from\nserving as priests to the LORD.\nThen he appointed for himself priests\nfor the high places, for the demons, and\nthe calf idols which he had made.\nAnd after the Levites left, those from\nall the tribes of Israel, such as set their\nheart to seek the LORD God of Israel,\ncame to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the\nLORD God of their fathers.\nSo they strengthened the kingdom of\nJudah, and made Rehoboam the son of\nSolomon strong for three years,\nbecause they walked in the way of\nDavid and Solomon for three years.\nThen Rehoboam took for himself as\nwife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth\nthe son of David, and of Abihail the\ndaughter of Eliah the son of Jesse.\nAnd she bore him children: Jeush,\nShamariah, and Zaham.\nAnd Rehoboam appointed Abijah the\nson of Maachah as chief, to be leader\namong his brothers; for he intended to\nmake him king.\nHe dealt wisely, and dispersed some\nof his sons throughout all the territories\nof Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified\ncity; and he gave them provisions in\nabundance. He also sought many wives\nfor them.\n12Now it came to pass, when\nRehoboam had established the kingdom\nand had strengthened himself, that he\nforsook the law of the LORD, and all\nIsrael along with him.\nAnd it happened in the fifth year of King\nRehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt\ncame up against Jerusalem, because\nthey had transgressed against the\nLORD,\nwith twelve hundred chariots, sixty\nthousand horsemen, and people without\nnumber who came with him out of\nEgypt--the Lubim and the Sukkiim and\nthe Ethiopians.\nAnd he took the fortified cities of Judah\nand came to Jerusalem.\nThen Shemaiah the prophet came to\nRehoboam and the leaders of Judah,\nwho were gathered together in\nJerusalem because of Shishak, and said\nto them, \"Thus says the LORD: \"You\nhave forsaken Me, and therefore I also\nhave left you in the hand of Shishak.\"'\nAnd whenever the king entered the\nhouse of the LORD, the guard would go\nand bring them out; then they would\ntake them back into the guardroom.\nWhen he humbled himself, the wrath\nof the LORD turned from him, so as not\nto destroy him completely; and things\nalso went well in Judah.\nSo the leaders of Israel and the king\nhumbled themselves; and they said,\n\"The LORD is righteous.\"\nNow when the LORD saw that they\nhumbled themselves, the word of the\nLORD came to Shemaiah, saying, \"They\nhave humbled themselves; therefore I\nwill not destroy them, but I will grant\nthem some deliverance. My wrath shall\nnot be poured out on Jerusalem by the\nhand of Shishak.\nThus King Rehoboam strengthened\nhimself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now\nRehoboam was forty-one years old\nwhen he became king; and he reigned\nseventeen years in Jerusalem, the city\nwhich the LORD had chosen out of all\nthe tribes of Israel, to put His name\nthere. His mother's name was Naamah,\nan Ammonitess.\nAnd he did evil, because he did not\nprepare his heart to seek the LORD.\nNevertheless they will be his servants,\nthat they may distinguish My service\nfrom the service of the kingdoms of the\nnations.\"\nThe acts of Rehoboam, first and last,\nare they not written in the book of\nShemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the\nseer concerning genealogies? And there\nwere wars between Rehoboam and\nJeroboam all their days.\nSo Shishak king of Egypt came up\nagainst Jerusalem, and took away the\ntreasures of the house of the LORD and\nthe treasures of the king's house; he\ntook everything. He also carried away\nthe gold shields which Solomon had\nmade.\nThen King Rehoboam made bronze\nshields in their place, and committed\nthem to the hands of the captains of the\nguard, who guarded the doorway of the\nking's house.\nSo Rehoboam rested with his fathers,\nand was buried in the City of David.\nThen Abijah his son reigned in his place.\n13In the eighteenth year of King\nJeroboam, Abijah became king over\nJudah.\nHe reigned three years in Jerusalem.\nHis mother's name was Michaiah the\ndaughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there\nwas war between Abijah and Jeroboam.\nAbijah set the battle in order with an\narmy of valiant warriors, four hundred\nthousand choice men. Jeroboam also\ndrew up in battle formation against him\nwith eight hundred thousand choice men,\nmighty men of valor.\nBut as for us, the LORD is our God,\nand we have not forsaken Him; and the\npriests who minister to the LORD are\nthe sons of Aaron, and the Levites\nattend to their duties.\nThen Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim,\nwhich is in the mountains of Ephraim,\nand said, \"Hear me, Jeroboam and all\nIsrael:\nShould you not know that the LORD\nGod of Israel gave the dominion over\nIsrael to David forever, to him and his\nsons, by a covenant of salt?\nYet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the\nservant of Solomon the son of David,\nrose up and rebelled against his lord.\nAnd they burn to the LORD every\nmorning and every evening burnt\nsacrifices and sweet incense; they also\nset the showbread in order on the pure\ngold table, and the lampstand of gold\nwith its lamps to burn every evening; for\nwe keep the command of the LORD our\nGod, but you have forsaken Him.\nNow look, God Himself is with us as\nour head, and His priests with sounding\ntrumpets to sound the alarm against you.\nO children of Israel, do not fight against\nthe LORD God of your fathers, for you\nshall not prosper!\"\nThen worthless rogues gathered to him,\nand strengthened themselves against\nRehoboam the son of Solomon, when\nRehoboam\nwas\nyoung\nand\ninexperienced and could not withstand\nthem.\nAnd now you think to withstand the\nkingdom of the LORD, which is in the\nhand of the sons of David; and you are\na great multitude, and with you are the\ngold calves which Jeroboam made for\nyou as gods.\nHave you not cast out the priests of the\nLORD, the sons of Aaron, and the\nLevites, and made for yourselves priests,\nlike the peoples of other lands, so that\nwhoever comes to consecrate himself\nwith a young bull and seven rams may\nbe a priest of things that are not gods?\nBut Jeroboam caused an ambush to\ngo around behind them; so they were in\nfront of Judah, and the ambush was\nbehind them.\nAnd when Judah looked around, to\ntheir surprise the battle line was at both\nfront and rear; and they cried out to the\nLORD, and the priests sounded the\ntrumpets.\nThen the men of Judah gave a shout;\nand as the men of Judah shouted, it\nhappened that God struck Jeroboam\nand all Israel before Abijah and Judah.\nAnd the children of Israel fled before\nJudah, and God delivered them into\ntheir hand.\nThen Abijah and his people struck\nthem with a great slaughter; so five\nhundred thousand choice men of Israel\nfell slain.\nHe commanded Judah to seek the\nLORD God of their fathers, and to\nobserve the law and the commandment.\nThus the children of Israel were\nsubdued at that time; and the children of\nJudah prevailed, because they relied on\nthe LORD God of their fathers.\nHe also removed the high places and\nthe incense altars from all the cities of\nJudah, and the kingdom was quiet\nunder him.\nAnd Abijah pursued Jeroboam and\ntook cities from him: Bethel with its\nvillages, Jeshanah with its villages, and\nEphrain with its villages.\nAnd he built fortified cities in Judah, for\nthe land had rest; he had no war in\nthose years, because the LORD had\ngiven him rest.\nBut Abijah grew mighty, married\nfourteen wives, and begot twenty-two\nsons and sixteen daughters.\nTherefore he said to Judah, \"Let us\nbuild these cities and make walls around\nthem, and towers, gates, and bars, while\nthe land is yet before us, because we\nhave sought the LORD our God; we\nhave sought Him, and He has given us\nrest on every side.\" So they built and\nprospered.\nSo Jeroboam did not recover strength\nagain in the days of Abijah; and the\nLORD struck him, and he died.\nNow the rest of the acts of Abijah, his\nways, and his sayings are written in the\nannals of the prophet Iddo.\n14So Abijah rested with his fathers,\nand they buried him in the City of David.\nThen Asa his son reigned in his place.\nIn his days the land was quiet for ten\nyears.\nAsa did what was good and right in the\neyes of the LORD his God,\nfor he removed the altars of the foreign\ngods and the high places, and broke\ndown the sacred pillars and cut down\nthe wooden images.\nAnd Asa had an army of three hundred\nthousand from Judah who carried\nshields and spears, and from Benjamin\ntwo hundred and eighty thousand men\nwho carried shields and drew bows; all\nthese were mighty men of valor.\nThen Zerah the Ethiopian came out\nagainst them with an army of a million\nmen and three hundred chariots, and he\ncame to Mareshah.\nSo Asa went out against him, and they\nset the troops in battle array in the\nValley of Zephathah at Mareshah.\nAnd Asa cried out to the LORD his\nGod, and said, \"LORD, it is nothing for\nYou to help, whether with many or with\nthose who have no power; help us, O\nLORD our God, for we rest on You, and\nin Your name we go against this\nmultitude. O LORD, You are our God;\ndo not let man prevail against You!\"\nbut when in their trouble they turned to\nthe LORD God of Israel, and sought\nHim, He was found by them.\nSo the LORD struck the Ethiopians\nbefore Asa and Judah, and the\nEthiopians fled.\nAnd in those times there was no peace\nto the one who went out, nor to the one\nwho came in, but great turmoil was on\nall the inhabitants of the lands.\nAnd Asa and the people who were\nwith him pursued them to Gerar. So the\nEthiopians were overthrown, and they\ncould not recover, for they were broken\nbefore the LORD and His army. And\nthey carried away very much spoil.\nThen they defeated all the cities\naround Gerar, for the fear of the LORD\ncame upon them; and they plundered all\nthe cities, for there was exceedingly\nmuch spoil in them.\nThey also attacked the livestock\nenclosures, and carried off sheep and\ncamels in abundance, and returned to\nJerusalem.\n15Now the Spirit of God came upon\nAzariah the son of Oded.\nAnd he went out to meet Asa, and said\nto him: \"Hear me, Asa, and all Judah\nand Benjamin. The LORD is with you\nwhile you are with Him. If you seek Him,\nHe will be found by you; but if you\nforsake Him, He will forsake you.\nFor a long time Israel has been without\nthe true God, without a teaching priest,\nand without law;\nSo nation was destroyed by nation, and\ncity by city, for God troubled them with\nevery adversity.\nBut you, be strong and do not let your\nhands be weak, for your work shall be\nrewarded!\"\nAnd when Asa heard these words and\nthe prophecy of Oded the prophet, he\ntook courage, and removed the\nabominable idols from all the land of\nJudah and Benjamin and from the cities\nwhich he had taken in the mountains of\nEphraim; and he restored the altar of the\nLORD that was before the vestibule of\nthe LORD.\nThen he gathered all Judah and\nBenjamin, and those who dwelt with\nthem from Ephraim, Manasseh, and\nSimeon, for they came over to him in\ngreat numbers from Israel when they\nsaw that the LORD his God was with\nhim.\nSo they gathered together at\nJerusalem in the third month, in the\nfifteenth year of the reign of Asa.\nAnd they offered to the LORD at that\ntime seven hundred bulls and seven\nthousand sheep from the spoil they had\nbrought.\nThen they entered into a covenant to\nseek the LORD God of their fathers with\nall their heart and with all their soul;\nmight let none go out or come in to Asa\nking of Judah.\nand whoever would not seek the\nLORD God of Israel was to be put to\ndeath, whether small or great, whether\nman or woman.\nThen Asa brought silver and gold from\nthe treasuries of the house of the LORD\nand of the king's house, and sent to\nBen-Hadad king of Syria, who dwelt in\nDamascus, saying,\nThen they took an oath before the\nLORD with a loud voice, with shouting\nand trumpets and rams' horns.\nAnd all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for\nthey had sworn with all their heart and\nsought Him with all their soul; and He\nwas found by them, and the LORD gave\nthem rest all around.\nAlso he removed Maachah, the mother\nof Asa the king, from being queen\nmother, because she had made an\nobscene image of Asherah; and Asa cut\ndown her obscene image, then crushed\nand burned it by the Brook Kidron.\nBut the high places were not removed\nfrom Israel. Nevertheless the heart of\nAsa was loyal all his days.\nHe also brought into the house of God\nthe things that his father had dedicated\nand that he himself had dedicated: silver\nand gold and utensils.\nAnd there was no war until the thirtyfifth year of the reign of Asa.\n16In the thirty-sixth year of the reign\nof Asa, Baasha king of Israel came up\nagainst Judah and built Ramah, that he\n\"Let there be a treaty between you and\nme, as there was between my father\nand your father. See, I have sent you\nsilver and gold; come, break your treaty\nwith Baasha king of Israel, so that he\nwill withdraw from me.\"\nSo Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and\nsent the captains of his armies against\nthe cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon,\nDan, Abel Maim, and all the storage\ncities of Naphtali.\nNow it happened, when Baasha heard\nit, that he stopped building Ramah and\nceased his work.\nThen King Asa took all Judah, and they\ncarried away the stones and timber of\nRamah, which Baasha had used for\nbuilding; and with them he built Geba\nand Mizpah.\nAnd at that time Hanani the seer came\nto Asa king of Judah, and said to him:\n\"Because you have relied on the king of\nSyria, and have not relied on the LORD\nyour God, therefore the army of the king\nof Syria has escaped from your hand.\nWere the Ethiopians and the Lubim not\na huge army with very many chariots\nand horsemen? Yet, because you relied\non the LORD, He delivered them into\nyour hand.\nFor the eyes of the LORD run to and fro\nthroughout the whole earth, to show\nHimself strong on behalf of those whose\nheart is loyal to Him. In this you have\ndone foolishly; therefore from now on\nyou shall have wars.\"\nThen Asa was angry with the seer,\nand put him in prison, for he was\nenraged at him because of this. And\nAsa oppressed some of the people at\nthat time.\nNote that the acts of Asa, first and last,\nare indeed written in the book of the\nkings of Judah and Israel.\nAnd he placed troops in all the fortified\ncities of Judah, and set garrisons in the\nland of Judah and in the cities of\nEphraim which Asa his father had taken.\nNow the LORD was with Jehoshaphat,\nbecause he walked in the former ways\nof his father David; he did not seek the\nBaals,\nbut sought the God of his father, and\nwalked in His commandments and not\naccording to the acts of Israel.\nTherefore the LORD established the\nkingdom in his hand; and all Judah gave\npresents to Jehoshaphat, and he had\nriches and honor in abundance.\nAnd in the thirty-ninth year of his reign,\nAsa became diseased in his feet, and\nhis malady was severe; yet in his\ndisease he did not seek the LORD, but\nthe physicians.\nAnd his heart took delight in the ways\nof the LORD; moreover he removed the\nhigh places and wooden images from\nJudah.\nSo Asa rested with his fathers; he died\nin the forty-first year of his reign.\nAlso in the third year of his reign he\nsent his leaders, Ben-Hail, Obadiah,\nZechariah, Nethanel, and Michaiah, to\nteach in the cities of Judah.\nThey buried him in his own tomb,\nwhich he had made for himself in the\nCity of David; and they laid him in the\nbed which was filled with spices and\nvarious ingredients prepared in a\nmixture of ointments. They made a very\ngreat burning for him.\nAnd with them he sent Levites:\nShemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel,\nShemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah,\nTobijah, and Tobadonijah--the Levites;\nand with them Elishama and Jehoram,\nthe priests.\n17Then Jehoshaphat his son\nreigned in his place, and strengthened\nhimself against Israel.\nSo they taught in Judah, and had the\nBook of the Law of the LORD with them;\nthey went throughout all the cities of\nJudah and taught the people.\nAnd the fear of the LORD fell on all the\nkingdoms of the lands that were around\nJudah, so that they did not make war\nagainst Jehoshaphat.\nThese served the king, besides those\nthe king put in the fortified cities\nthroughout all Judah.\nAlso some of the Philistines brought\nJehoshaphat presents and silver as\ntribute; and the Arabians brought him\nflocks, seven thousand seven hundred\nrams and seven thousand seven\nhundred male goats.\nSo Jehoshaphat became increasingly\npowerful, and he built fortresses and\nstorage cities in Judah.\nHe had much property in the cities of\nJudah; and the men of war, mighty men\nof valor, were in Jerusalem.\nThese are their numbers, according to\ntheir fathers' houses. Of Judah, the\ncaptains of thousands: Adnah the\ncaptain, and with him three hundred\nthousand mighty men of valor;\n18Jehoshaphat had riches and\nhonor in abundance; and by marriage\nhe allied himself with Ahab.\nAfter some years he went down to visit\nAhab in Samaria; and Ahab killed sheep\nand oxen in abundance for him and the\npeople who were with him, and\npersuaded him to go up with him to\nRamoth Gilead.\nSo Ahab king of Israel said to\nJehoshaphat king of Judah, \"Will you go\nwith me against Ramoth Gilead?\" And\nhe answered him, \"I am as you are, and\nmy people as your people; we will be\nwith you in the war.\"\nand next to him was Jehohanan the\ncaptain, and with him two hundred and\neighty thousand;\nAlso Jehoshaphat said to the king of\nIsrael, \"Please inquire for the word of\nthe LORD today.\"\nand next to him was Amasiah the son\nof Zichri, who willingly offered himself to\nthe LORD, and with him two hundred\nthousand mighty men of valor.\nThen the king of Israel gathered the\nprophets together, four hundred men,\nand said to them, \"Shall we go to war\nagainst Ramoth Gilead, or shall I\nrefrain?\" So they said, \"Go up, for God\nwill deliver it into the king's hand.\"\nOf Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of\nvalor, and with him two hundred\nthousand men armed with bow and\nshield;\nBut Jehoshaphat said, \"Is there not still\na prophet of the LORD here, that we\nmay inquire of Him?\"\nand next to him was Jehozabad, and\nwith him one hundred and eighty\nthousand prepared for war.\nSo the king of Israel said to\nJehoshaphat, \"There is still one man by\nwhom we may inquire of the LORD; but\nI hate him, because he never\nprophesies good concerning me, but\nalways evil. He is Micaiah the son of\nImla.\" And Jehoshaphat said, \"Let not\nthe king say such things!\"\nand they shall be delivered into your\nhand!\"\nThen the king of Israel called one of his\nofficers and said, \"Bring Micaiah the son\nof Imla quickly!\"\nSo the king said to him, \"How many\ntimes shall I make you swear that you\ntell me nothing but the truth in the name\nof the LORD?\"\nThe king of Israel and Jehoshaphat\nking of Judah, clothed in their robes, sat\neach on his throne; and they sat at a\nthreshing floor at the entrance of the\ngate of Samaria; and all the prophets\nprophesied before them.\nThen he said, \"I saw all Israel\nscattered on the mountains, as sheep\nthat have no shepherd. And the LORD\nsaid, \"These have no master. Let each\nreturn to his house in peace.\"'\nNow Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah\nhad made horns of iron for himself; and\nhe said, \"Thus says the LORD: \"With\nthese you shall gore the Syrians until\nthey are destroyed.\"'\nAnd all the prophets prophesied so,\nsaying, \"Go up to Ramoth Gilead and\nprosper, for the LORD will deliver it into\nthe king's hand.\"\nAnd the king of Israel said to\nJehoshaphat, \"Did I not tell you he\nwould not prophesy good concerning\nme, but evil?\"\nThen Micaiah said, \"Therefore hear\nthe word of the LORD: I saw the LORD\nsitting on His throne, and all the host of\nheaven standing on His right hand and\nHis left.\nThen the messenger who had gone to\ncall Micaiah spoke to him, saying, \"Now\nlisten, the words of the prophets with\none accord encourage the king.\nTherefore please let your word be like\nthe word of one of them, and speak\nencouragement.\"\nAnd Micaiah said, \"As the LORD lives,\nwhatever my God says, that I will\nspeak.\"\nThen he came to the king; and the\nking said to him, \"Micaiah, shall we go to\nwar against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I\nrefrain?\" And he said, \"Go and prosper,\nAnd the LORD said, \"Who will\npersuade Ahab king of Israel to go up,\nthat he may fall at Ramoth Gilead?' So\none spoke in this manner, and another\nspoke in that manner.\nThen a spirit came forward and stood\nbefore the LORD, and said, \"I will\npersuade him.' The LORD said to him,\n\"In what way?'\nSo he said, \"I will go out and be a lying\nspirit in the mouth of all his prophets.'\nAnd the LORD said, \"You shall\npersuade him and also prevail; go out\nand do so.'\nTherefore look! The LORD has put a\nlying spirit in the mouth of these\nprophets of yours, and the LORD has\ndeclared disaster against you.\"\nsmall or great, but only with the king of\nIsrael.\"\nThen Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah\nwent near and struck Micaiah on the\ncheek, and said, \"Which way did the\nspirit from the LORD go from me to\nspeak to you?\"\nSo it was, when the captains of the\nchariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they\nsaid, \"It is the king of Israel!\" Therefore\nthey surrounded him to attack; but\nJehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD\nhelped him, and God diverted them from\nhim.\nAnd Micaiah said, \"Indeed you shall\nsee on that day when you go into an\ninner chamber to hide!\"\nFor so it was, when the captains of the\nchariots saw that it was not the king of\nIsrael, that they turned back from\npursuing him.\nThen the king of Israel said, \"Take\nMicaiah, and return him to Amon the\ngovernor of the city and to Joash the\nking's son;\nand say, \"Thus says the king: \"Put this\nfellow in prison, and feed him with bread\nof affliction and water of affliction, until I\nreturn in peace.\"\"'\nBut Micaiah said, \"If you ever return in\npeace, the LORD has not spoken by\nme.\" And he said, \"Take heed, all you\npeople!\"\nSo the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat\nthe king of Judah went up to Ramoth\nGilead.\nNow a certain man drew a bow at\nrandom, and struck the king of Israel\nbetween the joints of his armor. So he\nsaid to the driver of his chariot, \"Turn\naround and take me out of the battle, for\nI am wounded.\"\nThe battle increased that day, and the\nking of Israel propped himself up in his\nchariot facing the Syrians until evening;\nand about the time of sunset he died.\n19Then Jehoshaphat the king of\nJudah returned safely to his house in\nJerusalem.\nAnd the king of Israel said to\nJehoshaphat, \"I will disguise myself and\ngo into battle; but you put on your\nrobes.\" So the king of Israel disguised\nhimself, and they went into battle.\nAnd Jehu the son of Hanani the seer\nwent out to meet him, and said to King\nJehoshaphat, \"Should you help the\nwicked and love those who hate the\nLORD? Therefore the wrath of the\nLORD is upon you.\nNow the king of Syria had commanded\nthe captains of the chariots who were\nwith him, saying, \"Fight with no one\nNevertheless good things are found in\nyou, in that you have removed the\nwooden images from the land, and have\nprepared your heart to seek God.\"\nyour brethren. Do this, and you will not\nbe guilty.\nSo Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem;\nand he went out again among the\npeople from Beersheba to the\nmountains of Ephraim, and brought\nthem back to the LORD God of their\nfathers.\nThen he set judges in the land\nthroughout all the fortified cities of Judah,\ncity by city,\nAnd take notice: Amariah the chief\npriest is over you in all matters of the\nLORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael,\nthe ruler of the house of Judah, for all\nthe king's matters; also the Levites will\nbe officials before you. Behave\ncourageously, and the LORD will be\nwith the good.\"\n20It happened after this that the\nand said to the judges, \"Take heed to\nwhat you are doing, for you do not judge\nfor man but for the LORD, who is with\nyou in the judgment.\npeople of Moab with the people of\nAmmon, and others with them besides\nthe Ammonites, came to battle against\nJehoshaphat.\nNow therefore, let the fear of the LORD\nbe upon you; take care and do it, for\nthere is no iniquity with the LORD our\nGod, no partiality, nor taking of bribes.\"\nMoreover in Jerusalem, for the\njudgment of the LORD and for\ncontroversies, Jehoshaphat appointed\nsome of the Levites and priests, and\nsome of the chief fathers of Israel, when\nthey returned to Jerusalem.\nAnd he commanded them, saying,\n\"Thus you shall act in the fear of the\nLORD, faithfully and with a loyal heart:\nWhatever case comes to you from\nyour brethren who dwell in their cities,\nwhether of bloodshed or offenses\nagainst law or commandment, against\nstatutes or ordinances, you shall warn\nthem, lest they trespass against the\nLORD and wrath come upon you and\nThen some came and told Jehoshaphat,\nsaying, \"A great multitude is coming\nagainst you from beyond the sea, from\nSyria; and they are in Hazazon Tamar\"\n(which is En Gedi).\nAnd Jehoshaphat feared, and set\nhimself to seek the LORD, and\nproclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.\nSo Judah gathered together to ask help\nfrom the LORD; and from all the cities of\nJudah they came to seek the LORD.\nThen Jehoshaphat stood in the\nassembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in\nthe house of the LORD, before the new\ncourt,\nand said: \"O LORD God of our fathers,\nare You not God in heaven, and do You\nnot rule over all the kingdoms of the\nnations, and in Your hand is there not\npower and might, so that no one is able\nto withstand You?\nof Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of\nAsaph, in the midst of the assembly.\nAre You not our God, who drove out\nthe inhabitants of this land before Your\npeople Israel, and gave it to the\ndescendants of Abraham Your friend\nforever?\nAnd they dwell in it, and have built You\na sanctuary in it for Your name, saying,\n\"If disaster comes upon us--sword,\njudgment, pestilence, or famine--we will\nstand before this temple and in Your\npresence (for Your name is in this\ntemple), and cry out to You in our\naffliction, and You will hear and save.'\nAnd now, here are the people of\nAmmon, Moab, and Mount Seir--whom\nYou would not let Israel invade when\nthey came out of the land of Egypt, but\nthey turned from them and did not\ndestroy them-11\nhere they are, rewarding us by coming\nto throw us out of Your possession\nwhich You have given us to inherit.\nO our God, will You not judge them?\nFor we have no power against this great\nmultitude that is coming against us; nor\ndo we know what to do, but our eyes are\nupon You.\"\nNow all Judah, with their little ones,\ntheir wives, and their children, stood\nbefore the LORD.\nThen the Spirit of the LORD came\nupon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the\nson of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son\nAnd he said, \"Listen, all you of Judah\nand you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and\nyou, King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the\nLORD to you: \"Do not be afraid nor\ndismayed because of this great\nmultitude, for the battle is not yours, but\nGod's.\nTomorrow go down against them.\nThey will surely come up by the Ascent\nof Ziz, and you will find them at the end\nof the brook before the Wilderness of\nJeruel.\nYou will not need to fight in this battle.\nPosition yourselves, stand still and see\nthe salvation of the LORD, who is with\nyou, O Judah and Jerusalem!' Do not\nfear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out\nagainst them, for the LORD is with you.\"\nAnd Jehoshaphat bowed his head with\nhis face to the ground, and all Judah\nand the inhabitants of Jerusalem bowed\nbefore the LORD, worshiping the LORD.\nThen the Levites of the children of the\nKohathites and of the children of the\nKorahites stood up to praise the LORD\nGod of Israel with voices loud and high.\nSo they rose early in the morning and\nwent out into the Wilderness of Tekoa;\nand as they went out, Jehoshaphat\nstood and said, \"Hear me, O Judah and\nyou inhabitants of Jerusalem: Believe in\nthe LORD your God, and you shall be\nestablished; believe His prophets, and\nyou shall prosper.\"\nAnd when he had consulted with the\npeople, he appointed those who should\nsing to the LORD, and who should\npraise the beauty of holiness, as they\nwent out before the army and were\nsaying: \"Praise the LORD, For His\nmercy endures forever.\"\nNow when they began to sing and to\npraise, the LORD set ambushes against\nthe people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount\nSeir, who had come against Judah; and\nthey were defeated.\nFor the people of Ammon and Moab\nstood up against the inhabitants of\nMount Seir to utterly kill and destroy\nthem. And when they had made an end\nof the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to\ndestroy one another.\nSo when Judah came to a place\noverlooking the wilderness, they looked\ntoward the multitude; and there were\ntheir dead bodies, fallen on the earth.\nNo one had escaped.\nWhen Jehoshaphat and his people\ncame to take away their spoil, they\nfound among them an abundance of\nvaluables on the dead bodies, and\nprecious jewelry, which they stripped off\nfor themselves, more than they could\ncarry away; and they were three days\ngathering the spoil because there was\nso much.\nAnd on the fourth day they assembled\nin the Valley of Berachah, for there they\nblessed the LORD; therefore the name\nof that place was called The Valley of\nBerachah until this day.\nThen they returned, every man of\nJudah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat\nin front of them, to go back to Jerusalem\nwith joy, for the LORD had made them\nrejoice over their enemies.\nSo they came to Jerusalem, with\nstringed instruments and harps and\ntrumpets, to the house of the LORD.\nAnd the fear of God was on all the\nkingdoms of those countries when they\nheard that the LORD had fought against\nthe enemies of Israel.\nThen the realm of Jehoshaphat was\nquiet, for his God gave him rest all\naround.\nSo Jehoshaphat was king over Judah.\nHe was thirty-five years old when he\nbecame king, and he reigned twenty-five\nyears in Jerusalem. His mother's name\nwas Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.\nAnd he walked in the way of his father\nAsa, and did not turn aside from it, doing\nwhat was right in the sight of the LORD.\nNevertheless the high places were not\ntaken away, for as yet the people had\nnot directed their hearts to the God of\ntheir fathers.\nNow the rest of the acts of\nJehoshaphat, first and last, indeed they\nare written in the book of Jehu the son\nof Hanani, which is mentioned in the\nbook of the kings of Israel.\nAfter this Jehoshaphat king of Judah\nallied himself with Ahaziah king of Israel,\nwho acted very wickedly.\nAnd he allied himself with him to make\nships to go to Tarshish, and they made\nthe ships in Ezion Geber.\nas a wife; and he did evil in the sight of\nthe LORD.\nBut Eliezer the son of Dodavah of\nMareshah\nprophesied\nagainst\nJehoshaphat, saying, \"Because you\nhave allied yourself with Ahaziah, the\nLORD has destroyed your works.\" Then\nthe ships were wrecked, so that they\nwere not able to go to Tarshish.\n21And Jehoshaphat rested with his\nfathers, and was buried with his fathers\nin the City of David. Then Jehoram his\nson reigned in his place.\nYet the LORD would not destroy the\nhouse of David, because of the\ncovenant that He had made with David,\nand since He had promised to give a\nlamp to him and to his sons forever.\nIn his days Edom revolted against\nJudah's authority, and made a king over\nthemselves.\nSo Jehoram went out with his officers,\nand all his chariots with him. And he\nrose by night and attacked the Edomites\nwho had surrounded him and the\ncaptains of the chariots.\nHe had brothers, the sons of\nJehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah,\nAzaryahu, Michael, and Shephatiah; all\nthese were the sons of Jehoshaphat\nking of Israel.\nThus Edom has been in revolt against\nJudah's authority to this day. At that time\nLibnah revolted against his rule,\nbecause he had forsaken the LORD\nGod of his fathers.\nTheir father gave them great gifts of\nsilver and gold and precious things, with\nfortified cities in Judah; but he gave the\nkingdom to Jehoram, because he was\nthe firstborn.\nMoreover he made high places in the\nmountains of Judah, and caused the\ninhabitants of Jerusalem to commit\nharlotry, and led Judah astray.\nNow when Jehoram was established\nover the kingdom of his father, he\nstrengthened himself and killed all his\nbrothers with the sword, and also others\nof the princes of Israel.\nAnd a letter came to him from Elijah\nthe prophet, saying, 4 Thus says the\nLORD God of your father David: 4\nBecause you have not walked in the\nways of Jehoshaphat your father, or in\nthe ways of Asa king of Judah,\nJehoram was thirty-two years old when\nhe became king, and he reigned eight\nyears in Jerusalem.\nAnd he walked in the way of the kings\nof Israel, just as the house of Ahab had\ndone, for he had the daughter of Ahab\nbut have walked in the way of the\nkings of Israel, and have made Judah\nand the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play\nthe harlot like the harlotry of the house\nof Ahab, and also have killed your\nbrothers, those of your father's\nhousehold,\nyourself,\nwho\nwere\nbetter\nthan\n22Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem\nbehold, the LORD will strike your\npeople with a serious affliction--your\nchildren, your wives, and all your\npossessions;\nmade Ahaziah his youngest son king in\nhis place, for the raiders who came with\nthe Arabians into the camp had killed all\nthe older sons. So Ahaziah the son of\nJehoram, king of Judah, reigned.\nand you will become very sick with a\ndisease of your intestines, until your\nintestines come out by reason of the\nsickness, day by day.\nAhaziah was forty-two years old when\nhe became king, and he reigned one\nyear in Jerusalem. His mother's name\nwas Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri.\nMoreover the LORD stirred up against\nJehoram the spirit of the Philistines and\nthe Arabians who were near the\nEthiopians.\nHe also walked in the ways of the\nhouse of Ahab, for his mother advised\nhim to do wickedly.\nAnd they came up into Judah and\ninvaded it, and carried away all the\npossessions that were found in the\nking's house, and also his sons and his\nwives, so that there was not a son left to\nhim except Jehoahaz, the youngest of\nhis sons.\nAfter all this the LORD struck him in\nhis intestines with an incurable disease.\nTherefore he did evil in the sight of the\nLORD, like the house of Ahab; for they\nwere his counselors after the death of\nhis father, to his destruction.\nHe also followed their advice, and went\nwith Jehoram the son of Ahab king of\nIsrael to war against Hazael king of\nSyria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians\nwounded Joram.\nThen it happened in the course of time,\nafter the end of two years, that his\nintestines came out because of his\nsickness; so he died in severe pain. And\nhis people made no burning for him, like\nthe burning for his fathers.\nThen he returned to Jezreel to recover\nfrom the wounds which he had received\nat Ramah, when he fought against\nHazael king of Syria. And Azariah the\nson of Jehoram, king of Judah, went\ndown to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in\nJezreel, because he was sick.\nHe was thirty-two years old when he\nbecame king. He reigned in Jerusalem\neight years and, to no one's sorrow,\ndeparted. However they buried him in\nthe City of David, but not in the tombs of\nthe kings.\nHis going to Joram was God's occasion\nfor Ahaziah's downfall; for when he\narrived, he went out with Jehoram\nagainst Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom\nthe LORD had anointed to cut off the\nhouse of Ahab.\nAnd it happened, when Jehu was\nexecuting judgment on the house of\nAhab, and found the princes of Judah\nand the sons of Ahaziah's brothers who\nserved Ahaziah, that he killed them.\nThen he searched for Ahaziah; and\nthey caught him (he was hiding in\nSamaria), and brought him to Jehu.\nWhen they had killed him, they buried\nhim, \"because,\" they said, \"he is the son\nof Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD\nwith all his heart.\" So the house of\nAhaziah had no one to assume power\nover the kingdom.\nNow when Athaliah the mother of\nAhaziah saw that her son was dead, she\narose and destroyed all the royal heirs\nof the house of Judah.\nBut Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the\nking, took Joash the son of Ahaziah,\nand stole him away from among the\nking's sons who were being murdered,\nand put him and his nurse in a bedroom.\nSo Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King\nJehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest\n(for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid\nhim from Athaliah so that she did not kill\nhim.\nAnd he was hidden with them in the\nhouse of God for six years, while\nAthaliah reigned over the land.\n23In the seventh year Jehoiada\nstrengthened himself, and made a\ncovenant with the captains of hundreds:\nAzariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the\nson of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of\nObed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and\nElishaphat the son of Zichri.\nAnd they went throughout Judah and\ngathered the Levites from all the cities of\nJudah, and the chief fathers of Israel,\nand they came to Jerusalem.\nThen all the assembly made a\ncovenant with the king in the house of\nGod. And he said to them, \"Behold, the\nking's son shall reign, as the LORD has\nsaid of the sons of David.\nThis is what you shall do: One-third of\nyou entering on the Sabbath, of the\npriests and the Levites, shall be keeping\nwatch over the doors;\none-third shall be at the king's house;\nand one-third at the Gate of the\nFoundation. All the people shall be in\nthe courts of the house of the LORD.\nBut let no one come into the house of\nthe LORD except the priests and those\nof the Levites who serve. They may go\nin, for they are holy; but all the people\nshall keep the watch of the LORD.\nAnd the Levites shall surround the king\non all sides, every man with his\nweapons in his hand; and whoever\ncomes into the house, let him be put to\ndeath. You are to be with the king when\nhe comes in and when he goes out.\"\nSo the Levites and all Judah did\naccording to all that Jehoiada the priest\ncommanded. And each man took his\nmen who were to be on duty on the\nSabbath, with those who were going off\nduty on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the\npriest had not dismissed the divisions.\nAnd Jehoiada the priest gave to the\ncaptains of hundreds the spears and the\nlarge and small shields which had\nbelonged to King David, that were in the\ntemple of God.\nSo they seized her; and she went by\nway of the entrance of the Horse Gate\ninto the king's house, and they killed her\nthere.\nThen Jehoiada made a covenant\nbetween himself, the people, and the\nking, that they should be the LORD's\npeople.\nThen he set all the people, every man\nwith his weapon in his hand, from the\nright side of the temple to the left side of\nthe temple, along by the altar and by the\ntemple, all around the king.\nAnd all the people went to the temple\nof Baal, and tore it down. They broke in\npieces its altars and images, and killed\nMattan the priest of Baal before the\naltars.\nAnd they brought out the king's son,\nput the crown on him, gave him the\nTestimony, and made him king. Then\nJehoiada and his sons anointed him,\nand said, \"Long live the king!\"\nNow when Athaliah heard the noise of\nthe people running and praising the king,\nshe came to the people in the temple of\nthe LORD.\nWhen she looked, there was the king\nstanding by his pillar at the entrance;\nand the leaders and the trumpeters\nwere by the king. All the people of the\nland were rejoicing and blowing\ntrumpets, also the singers with musical\ninstruments, and those who led in praise.\nSo Athaliah tore her clothes and said,\n\"Treason! Treason!\"\nAnd Jehoiada the priest brought out\nthe captains of hundreds who were set\nover the army, and said to them, \"Take\nher outside under guard, and slay with\nthe sword whoever follows her.\" For the\npriest had said, \"Do not kill her in the\nhouse of the LORD.\"\nAlso Jehoiada appointed the oversight\nof the house of the LORD to the hand of\nthe priests, the Levites, whom David\nhad assigned in the house of the LORD,\nto offer the burnt offerings of the LORD,\nas it is written in the Law of Moses, with\nrejoicing and with singing, as it was\nestablished by David.\nAnd he set the gatekeepers at the\ngates of the house of the LORD, so that\nno one who was in any way unclean\nshould enter.\nThen he took the captains of hundreds,\nthe nobles, the governors of the people,\nand all the people of the land, and\nbrought the king down from the house of\nthe LORD; and they went through the\nUpper Gate to the king's house, and set\nthe king on the throne of the kingdom.\nSo all the people of the land rejoiced;\nand the city was quiet, for they had slain\nAthaliah with the sword.\n24Joash was seven years old when\nhe became king, and he reigned forty\nyears in Jerusalem. His mother's name\nwas Zibiah of Beersheba.\nJoash did what was right in the sight of\nthe LORD all the days of Jehoiada the\npriest.\nAnd Jehoiada took two wives for him,\nand he had sons and daughters.\nNow it happened after this that Joash\nset his heart on repairing the house of\nthe LORD.\nThen he gathered the priests and the\nLevites, and said to them, \"Go out to the\ncities of Judah, and gather from all\nIsrael money to repair the house of your\nGod from year to year, and see that you\ndo it quickly.\" However the Levites did\nnot do it quickly.\nSo the king called Jehoiada the chief\npriest, and said to him, \"Why have you\nnot required the Levites to bring in from\nJudah and from Jerusalem the collection,\naccording to the commandment of\nMoses the servant of the LORD and of\nthe assembly of Israel, for the\ntabernacle of witness?\"\nFor the sons of Athaliah, that wicked\nwoman, had broken into the house of\nGod, and had also presented all the\ndedicated things of the house of the\nLORD to the Baals.\nThen at the king's command they made\na chest, and set it outside at the gate of\nthe house of the LORD.\nAnd they made a proclamation\nthroughout Judah and Jerusalem to\nbring to the LORD the collection that\nMoses the servant of God had imposed\non Israel in the wilderness.\nThen all the leaders and all the people\nrejoiced, brought their contributions, and\nput them into the chest until all had\ngiven.\nSo it was, at that time, when the chest\nwas brought to the king's official by the\nhand of the Levites, and when they saw\nthat there was much money, that the\nking's scribe and the high priest's officer\ncame and emptied the chest, and took it\nand returned it to its place. Thus they\ndid day by day, and gathered money in\nabundance.\nThe king and Jehoiada gave it to those\nwho did the work of the service of the\nhouse of the LORD; and they hired\nmasons and carpenters to repair the\nhouse of the LORD, and also those who\nworked in iron and bronze to restore the\nhouse of the LORD.\nSo the workmen labored, and the work\nwas completed by them; they restored\nthe house of God to its original condition\nand reinforced it.\nWhen they had finished, they brought\nthe rest of the money before the king\nand Jehoiada; they made from it articles\nfor the house of the LORD, articles for\nserving and offering, spoons and\nvessels of gold and silver. And they\noffered burnt offerings in the house of\nthe LORD continually all the days of\nJehoiada.\nBut Jehoiada grew old and was full of\ndays, and he died; he was one hundred\nand thirty years old when he died.\nas he died, he said, \"The LORD look on\nit, and repay!\"\nAnd they buried him in the City of\nDavid among the kings, because he had\ndone good in Israel, both toward God\nand His house.\nNow after the death of Jehoiada the\nleaders of Judah came and bowed down\nto the king. And the king listened to\nthem.\nTherefore they left the house of the\nLORD God of their fathers, and served\nwooden images and idols; and wrath\ncame upon Judah and Jerusalem\nbecause of their trespass.\nYet He sent prophets to them, to bring\nthem back to the LORD; and they\ntestified against them, but they would\nnot listen.\nThen the Spirit of God came upon\nZechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest,\nwho stood above the people, and said to\nthem, \"Thus says God: \"Why do you\ntransgress the commandments of the\nLORD, so that you cannot prosper?\nBecause you have forsaken the LORD,\nHe also has forsaken you.\"'\nSo they conspired against him, and at\nthe command of the king they stoned\nhim with stones in the court of the house\nof the LORD.\nThus Joash the king did not remember\nthe kindness which Jehoiada his father\nhad done to him, but killed his son; and\nSo it happened in the spring of the\nyear that the army of Syria came up\nagainst him; and they came to Judah\nand Jerusalem, and destroyed all the\nleaders of the people from among the\npeople, and sent all their spoil to the\nking of Damascus.\nFor the army of the Syrians came with\na small company of men; but the LORD\ndelivered a very great army into their\nhand, because they had forsaken the\nLORD God of their fathers. So they\nexecuted judgment against Joash.\nAnd when they had withdrawn from\nhim (for they left him severely wounded),\nhis own servants conspired against him\nbecause of the blood of the sons of\nJehoiada the priest, and killed him on\nhis bed. So he died. And they buried\nhim in the City of David, but they did not\nbury him in the tombs of the kings.\nThese are the ones who conspired\nagainst him: Zabad the son of Shimeath\nthe Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the\nson of Shimrith the Moabitess.\nNow concerning his sons, and the\nmany oracles about him, and the\nrepairing of the house of God, indeed\nthey are written in the annals of the\nbook of the kings. Then Amaziah his\nson reigned in his place.\n25Amaziah was twenty-five years\nold when he became king, and he\nreigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem.\nHis mother's name was Jehoaddan of\nJerusalem.\nbefore the enemy; for God has power to\nhelp and to overthrow.\"\nAnd he did what was right in the sight\nof the LORD, but not with a loyal heart.\nNow it happened, as soon as the\nkingdom was established for him, that\nhe executed his servants who had\nmurdered his father the king.\nHowever he did not execute their\nchildren, but did as it is written in the\nLaw in the Book of Moses, where the\nLORD commanded, saying, \"The fathers\nshall not be put to death for their\nchildren, nor shall the children be put to\ndeath for their fathers; but a person shall\ndie for his own sin.\"\nThen Amaziah said to the man of God,\n\"But what shall we do about the hundred\ntalents which I have given to the troops\nof Israel?\" And the man of God\nanswered, \"The LORD is able to give\nyou much more than this.\"\nSo Amaziah discharged the troops that\nhad come to him from Ephraim, to go\nback home. Therefore their anger was\ngreatly aroused against Judah, and they\nreturned home in great anger.\nThen Amaziah strengthened himself,\nand leading his people, he went to the\nValley of Salt and killed ten thousand of\nthe people of Seir.\nMoreover Amaziah gathered Judah\ntogether and set over them captains of\nthousands and captains of hundreds,\naccording to their fathers' houses,\nthroughout all Judah and Benjamin; and\nhe numbered them from twenty years\nold and above, and found them to be\nthree hundred thousand choice men,\nable to go to war, who could handle\nspear and shield.\nHe also hired one hundred thousand\nmighty men of valor from Israel for one\nhundred talents of silver.\nAlso the children of Judah took captive\nten thousand alive, brought them to the\ntop of the rock, and cast them down\nfrom the top of the rock, so that they all\nwere dashed in pieces.\nBut as for the soldiers of the army\nwhich Amaziah had discharged, so that\nthey would not go with him to battle,\nthey raided the cities of Judah from\nSamaria to Beth Horon, killed three\nthousand in them, and took much spoil.\nBut a man of God came to him, saying,\n\"O king, do not let the army of Israel go\nwith you, for the LORD is not with Israel-not with any of the children of Ephraim.\nNow it was so, after Amaziah came\nfrom the slaughter of the Edomites, that\nhe brought the gods of the people of\nSeir, set them up to be his gods, and\nbowed down before them and burned\nincense to them.\nBut if you go, be gone! Be strong in\nbattle! Even so, God shall make you fall\nTherefore the anger of the LORD was\naroused against Amaziah, and He sent\nhim a prophet who said to him, \"Why\nhave you sought the gods of the people,\nwhich could not rescue their own people\nfrom your hand?\"\nSo it was, as he talked with him, that\nthe king said to him, \"Have we made\nyou the king's counselor? Cease! Why\nshould you be killed?\" Then the prophet\nceased, and said, \"I know that God has\ndetermined to destroy you, because you\nhave done this and have not heeded my\nadvice.\"\nNow Amaziah king of Judah asked\nadvice and sent to Joash the son of\nJehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel,\nsaying, \"Come, let us face one another\nin battle.\"\nAnd Joash king of Israel sent to\nAmaziah king of Judah, saying, \"The\nthistle that was in Lebanon sent to the\ncedar that was in Lebanon, saying,\n\"Give your daughter to my son as wife';\nand a wild beast that was in Lebanon\npassed by and trampled the thistle.\nAnd Judah was defeated by Israel,\nand every man fled to his tent.\nThen Joash the king of Israel captured\nAmaziah king of Judah, the son of\nJoash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth\nShemesh; and he brought him to\nJerusalem, and broke down the wall of\nJerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to\nthe Corner Gate--four hundred cubits.\nAnd he took all the gold and silver, all\nthe articles that were found in the house\nof God with Obed-Edom, the treasures\nof the king's house, and hostages, and\nreturned to Samaria.\nAmaziah the son of Joash, king of\nJudah, lived fifteen years after the death\nof Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of\nIsrael.\nNow the rest of the acts of Amaziah,\nfrom first to last, indeed are they not\nwritten in the book of the kings of Judah\nand Israel?\nIndeed you say that you have defeated\nthe Edomites, and your heart is lifted up\nto boast. Stay at home now; why should\nyou meddle with trouble, that you should\nfall--you and Judah with you?\"\nAfter the time that Amaziah turned\naway from following the LORD, they\nmade a conspiracy against him in\nJerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but\nthey sent after him to Lachish and killed\nhim there.\nBut Amaziah would not heed, for it\ncame from God, that He might give\nthem into the hand of their enemies,\nbecause they sought the gods of Edom.\nSo Joash king of Israel went out; and\nhe and Amaziah king of Judah faced\none another at Beth Shemesh, which\nbelongs to Judah.\nThen they brought him on horses and\nburied him with his fathers in the City of\nJudah.\n26Now all the people of Judah took\nUzziah, who was sixteen years old, and\nmade him king instead of his father\nAmaziah.\nHe built Elath and restored it to Judah,\nafter the king rested with his fathers.\nvinedressers in the mountains and in\nCarmel, for he loved the soil.\nUzziah was sixteen years old when he\nbecame king, and he reigned fifty-two\nyears in Jerusalem. His mother's name\nwas Jecholiah of Jerusalem.\nAnd he did what was right in the sight\nof the LORD, according to all that his\nfather Amaziah had done.\nHe sought God in the days of\nZechariah, who had understanding in\nthe visions of God; and as long as he\nsought the LORD, God made him\nprosper.\nNow he went out and made war against\nthe Philistines, and broke down the wall\nof Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall\nof Ashdod; and he built cities around\nAshdod and among the Philistines.\nGod helped him against the Philistines,\nagainst the Arabians who lived in Gur\nBaal, and against the Meunites.\nMoreover Uzziah had an army of\nfighting men who went out to war by\ncompanies, according to the number on\ntheir roll as prepared by Jeiel the scribe\nand Maaseiah the officer, under the\nhand of Hananiah, one of the king's\ncaptains.\nThe total number of chief officers of\nthe mighty men of valor was two\nthousand six hundred.\nAnd under their authority was an army\nof three hundred and seven thousand\nfive hundred, that made war with mighty\npower, to help the king against the\nenemy.\nThen Uzziah prepared for them, for the\nentire army, shields, spears, helmets,\nbody armor, bows, and slings to cast\nstones.\nAlso the Ammonites brought tribute to\nUzziah. His fame spread as far as the\nentrance of Egypt, for he became\nexceedingly strong.\nAnd he made devices in Jerusalem,\ninvented by skillful men, to be on the\ntowers and the corners, to shoot arrows\nand large stones. So his fame spread\nfar and wide, for he was marvelously\nhelped till he became strong.\nAnd Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at\nthe Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and\nat the corner buttress of the wall; then\nhe fortified them.\nBut when he was strong his heart was\nlifted up, to his destruction, for he\ntransgressed against the LORD his God\nby entering the temple of the LORD to\nburn incense on the altar of incense.\nAlso he built towers in the desert. He\ndug many wells, for he had much\nlivestock, both in the lowlands and in the\nplains; he also had farmers and\nSo Azariah the priest went in after him,\nand with him were eighty priests of the\nLORD--valiant men.\nAnd they withstood King Uzziah, and\nsaid to him, \"It is not for you, Uzziah, to\nburn incense to the LORD, but for the\npriests, the sons of Aaron, who are\nconsecrated to burn incense. Get out of\nthe sanctuary, for you have trespassed!\nYou shall have no honor from the LORD\nGod.\"\nThen Uzziah became furious; and he\nhad a censer in his hand to burn\nincense. And while he was angry with\nthe priests, leprosy broke out on his\nforehead, before the priests in the house\nof the LORD, beside the incense altar.\nAnd Azariah the chief priest and all the\npriests looked at him, and there, on his\nforehead, he was leprous; so they thrust\nhim out of that place. Indeed he also\nhurried to get out, because the LORD\nhad struck him.\nKing Uzziah was a leper until the day\nof his death. He dwelt in an isolated\nhouse, because he was a leper; for he\nwas cut off from the house of the LORD.\nThen Jotham his son was over the\nking's house, judging the people of the\nland.\nNow the rest of the acts of Uzziah,\nfrom first to last, the prophet Isaiah the\nson of Amoz wrote.\nSo Uzziah rested with his fathers, and\nthey buried him with his fathers in the\nfield of burial which belonged to the\nkings, for they said, \"He is a leper.\"\nThen Jotham his son reigned in his\nplace.\n27Jotham was twenty-five years old\nwhen he became king, and he reigned\nsixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's\nname was Jerushah the daughter of\nZadok.\nAnd he did what was right in the sight\nof the LORD, according to all that his\nfather Uzziah had done (although he did\nnot enter the temple of the LORD). But\nstill the people acted corruptly.\nHe built the Upper Gate of the house of\nthe LORD, and he built extensively on\nthe wall of Ophel.\nMoreover he built cities in the\nmountains of Judah, and in the forests\nhe built fortresses and towers.\nHe also fought with the king of the\nAmmonites and defeated them. And the\npeople of Ammon gave him in that year\none hundred talents of silver, ten\nthousand kors of wheat, and ten\nthousand of barley. The people of\nAmmon paid this to him in the second\nand third years also.\nSo Jotham became mighty, because he\nprepared his ways before the LORD his\nGod.\nNow the rest of the acts of Jotham, and\nall his wars and his ways, indeed they\nare written in the book of the kings of\nIsrael and Judah.\nHe was twenty-five years old when he\nbecame king, and he reigned sixteen\nyears in Jerusalem.\nSo Jotham rested with his fathers, and\nthey buried him in the City of David.\nThen Ahaz his son reigned in his place.\nofficer over the house, and Elkanah who\nwas second to the king.\n28Ahaz was twenty years old when\nhe became king, and he reigned sixteen\nyears in Jerusalem; and he did not do\nwhat was right in the sight of the LORD,\nas his father David had done.\nFor he walked in the ways of the kings\nof Israel, and made molded images for\nthe Baals.\nHe burned incense in the Valley of the\nSon of Hinnom, and burned his children\nin\nthe\nfire,\naccording\nto\nthe\nabominations of the nations whom the\nLORD had cast out before the children\nof Israel.\nAnd he sacrificed and burned incense\non the high places, on the hills, and\nunder every green tree.\nTherefore the LORD his God delivered\nhim into the hand of the king of Syria.\nThey defeated him, and carried away a\ngreat multitude of them as captives, and\nbrought them to Damascus. Then he\nwas also delivered into the hand of the\nking of Israel, who defeated him with a\ngreat slaughter.\nFor Pekah the son of Remaliah killed\none hundred and twenty thousand in\nJudah in one day, all valiant men,\nbecause they had forsaken the LORD\nGod of their fathers.\nZichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed\nMaaseiah the king's son, Azrikam the\nAnd the children of Israel carried away\ncaptive of their brethren two hundred\nthousand women, sons, and daughters;\nand they also took away much spoil\nfrom them, and brought the spoil to\nSamaria.\nBut a prophet of the LORD was there,\nwhose name was Oded; and he went\nout before the army that came to\nSamaria, and said to them: \"Look,\nbecause the LORD God of your fathers\nwas angry with Judah, He has delivered\nthem into your hand; but you have killed\nthem in a rage that reaches up to\nheaven.\nAnd now you propose to force the\nchildren of Judah and Jerusalem to be\nyour male and female slaves; but are\nyou not also guilty before the LORD\nyour God?\nNow hear me, therefore, and return\nthe captives, whom you have taken\ncaptive from your brethren, for the fierce\nwrath of the LORD is upon you.\"\nThen some of the heads of the\nchildren of Ephraim, Azariah the son of\nJohanan, Berechiah the son of\nMeshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of\nShallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai,\nstood up against those who came from\nthe war,\nand said to them, \"You shall not bring\nthe captives here, for we already have\noffended the LORD. You intend to add\nto our sins and to our guilt; for our guilt\nis great, and there is fierce wrath\nagainst Israel.\"\nSo the armed men left the captives\nand the spoil before the leaders and all\nthe assembly.\nThen the men who were designated by\nname rose up and took the captives,\nand from the spoil they clothed all who\nwere naked among them, dressed them\nand gave them sandals, gave them food\nand drink, and anointed them; and they\nlet all the feeble ones ride on donkeys.\nSo they brought them to their brethren\nat Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then\nthey returned to Samaria.\nFor Ahaz took part of the treasures\nfrom the house of the LORD, from the\nhouse of the king, and from the leaders,\nand he gave it to the king of Assyria; but\nhe did not help him.\nNow in the time of his distress King\nAhaz became increasingly unfaithful to\nthe LORD. This is that King Ahaz.\nFor he sacrificed to the gods of\nDamascus which had defeated him,\nsaying, \"Because the gods of the kings\nof Syria help them, I will sacrifice to\nthem that they may help me.\" But they\nwere the ruin of him and of all Israel.\nAt the same time King Ahaz sent to\nthe kings of Assyria to help him.\nFor again the Edomites had come,\nattacked Judah, and carried away\ncaptives.\nThe Philistines also had invaded the\ncities of the lowland and of the South of\nJudah, and had taken Beth Shemesh,\nAijalon, Gederoth, Sochoh with its\nvillages, Timnah with its villages, and\nGimzo with its villages; and they dwelt\nthere.\nSo Ahaz gathered the articles of the\nhouse of God, cut in pieces the articles\nof the house of God, shut up the doors\nof the house of the LORD, and made for\nhimself altars in every corner of\nJerusalem.\nAnd in every single city of Judah he\nmade high places to burn incense to\nother gods, and provoked to anger the\nLORD God of his fathers.\nNow the rest of his acts and all his\nways, from first to last, indeed they are\nwritten in the book of the kings of Judah\nand Israel.\nFor the LORD brought Judah low\nbecause of Ahaz king of Israel, for he\nhad encouraged moral decline in Judah\nand had been continually unfaithful to\nthe LORD.\nSo Ahaz rested with his fathers, and\nthey buried him in the city, in Jerusalem;\nbut they did not bring him into the tombs\nof the kings of Israel. Then Hezekiah his\nson reigned in his place.\nAlso Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria\ncame to him and distressed him, and did\nnot assist him.\n29Hezekiah became king when he\nwas twenty-five years old, and he\nreigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem.\nHis mother's name was Abijah the\ndaughter of Zechariah.\nour daughters, and our wives are in\ncaptivity.\nAnd he did what was right in the sight\nof the LORD, according to all that his\nfather David had done.\n\"Now it is in my heart to make a\ncovenant with the LORD God of Israel,\nthat His fierce wrath may turn away from\nus.\nIn the first year of his reign, in the first\nmonth, he opened the doors of the\nhouse of the LORD and repaired them.\nThen he brought in the priests and the\nLevites, and gathered them in the East\nSquare,\nMy sons, do not be negligent now, for\nthe LORD has chosen you to stand\nbefore Him, to serve Him, and that you\nshould minister to Him and burn\nincense.\"\nand said to them: \"Hear me, Levites!\nNow sanctify yourselves, sanctify the\nhouse of the LORD God of your fathers,\nand carry out the rubbish from the holy\nplace.\nThen these Levites arose: Mahath the\nson of Amasai and Joel the son of\nAzariah, of the sons of the Kohathites;\nof the sons of Merari, Kish the son of\nAbdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel;\nof the Gershonites, Joah the son of\nZimmah and Eden the son of Joah;\nFor our fathers have trespassed and\ndone evil in the eyes of the LORD our\nGod; they have forsaken Him, have\nturned their faces away from the\ndwelling place of the LORD, and turned\ntheir backs on Him.\nof the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and\nJeiel; of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah\nand Mattaniah;\nof the sons of Heman, Jehiel and\nShimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun,\nShemaiah and Uzziel.\nThey have also shut up the doors of the\nvestibule, put out the lamps, and have\nnot burned incense or offered burnt\nofferings in the holy place to the God of\nIsrael.\nAnd they gathered their brethren,\nsanctified\nthemselves,\nand\nwent\naccording to the commandment of the\nking, at the words of the LORD, to\ncleanse the house of the LORD.\nTherefore the wrath of the LORD fell\nupon Judah and Jerusalem, and He has\ngiven them up to trouble, to desolation,\nand to jeering, as you see with your\neyes.\nFor indeed, because of this our fathers\nhave fallen by the sword; and our sons,\nThen the priests went into the inner\npart of the house of the LORD to\ncleanse it, and brought out all the debris\nthat they found in the temple of the\nLORD to the court of the house of the\nLORD. And the Levites took it out and\ncarried it to the Brook Kidron.\nNow they began to sanctify on the first\nday of the first month, and on the eighth\nday of the month they came to the\nvestibule of the LORD. So they\nsanctified the house of the LORD in\neight days, and on the sixteenth day of\nthe first month they finished.\nAnd the priests killed them; and they\npresented their blood on the altar as a\nsin offering to make an atonement for all\nIsrael, for the king commanded that the\nburnt offering and the sin offering be\nmade for all Israel.\nThen they went in to King Hezekiah\nand said, \"We have cleansed all the\nhouse of the LORD, the altar of burnt\nofferings with all its articles, and the\ntable of the showbread with all its\narticles.\nAnd he stationed the Levites in the\nhouse of the LORD with cymbals, with\nstringed instruments, and with harps,\naccording to the commandment of David,\nof Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan\nthe prophet; for thus was the\ncommandment of the LORD by His\nprophets.\nMoreover all the articles which King\nAhaz in his reign had cast aside in his\ntransgression we have prepared and\nsanctified; and there they are, before the\naltar of the LORD.\"\nThe Levites stood with the instruments\nof David, and the priests with the\ntrumpets.\nThen King Hezekiah rose early,\ngathered the rulers of the city, and went\nup to the house of the LORD.\nAnd they brought seven bulls, seven\nrams, seven lambs, and seven male\ngoats for a sin offering for the kingdom,\nfor the sanctuary, and for Judah. Then\nhe commanded the priests, the sons of\nAaron, to offer them on the altar of the\nLORD.\nThen Hezekiah commanded them to\noffer the burnt offering on the altar. And\nwhen the burnt offering began, the song\nof the LORD also began, with the\ntrumpets and with the instruments of\nDavid king of Israel.\nSo all the assembly worshiped, the\nsingers sang, and the trumpeters\nsounded; all this continued until the\nburnt offering was finished.\nSo they killed the bulls, and the priests\nreceived the blood and sprinkled it on\nthe altar. Likewise they killed the rams\nand sprinkled the blood on the altar.\nThey also killed the lambs and sprinkled\nthe blood on the altar.\nThen they brought out the male goats\nfor the sin offering before the king and\nthe assembly, and they laid their hands\non them.\nAnd when they had finished offering,\nthe king and all who were present with\nhim bowed and worshiped.\nMoreover King Hezekiah and the\nleaders commanded the Levites to sing\npraise to the LORD with the words of\nDavid and of Asaph the seer. So they\nsang praises with gladness, and they\nbowed their heads and worshiped.\nThen Hezekiah answered and said,\n\"Now that you have consecrated\nyourselves to the LORD, come near,\nand bring sacrifices and thank offerings\ninto the house of the LORD.\" So the\nassembly brought in sacrifices and\nthank offerings, and as many as were of\na willing heart brought burnt offerings.\nAnd the number of the burnt offerings\nwhich the assembly brought was\nseventy bulls, one hundred rams, and\ntwo hundred lambs; all these were for a\nburnt offering to the LORD.\nThe consecrated things were six\nhundred bulls and three thousand sheep.\nBut the priests were too few, so that\nthey could not skin all the burnt\nofferings; therefore their brethren the\nLevites helped them until the work was\nended and until the other priests had\nsanctified themselves, for the Levites\nwere more diligent in sanctifying\nthemselves than the priests.\nAlso the burnt offerings were in\nabundance, with the fat of the peace\nofferings and with the drink offerings for\nevery burnt offering. So the service of\nthe house of the LORD was set in order.\nThen Hezekiah and all the people\nrejoiced that God had prepared the\npeople, since the events took place so\nsuddenly.\n30And Hezekiah sent to all Israel\nand Judah, and also wrote letters to\nEphraim and Manasseh, that they\nshould come to the house of the LORD\nat Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to\nthe LORD God of Israel.\nFor the king and his leaders and all the\nassembly in Jerusalem had agreed to\nkeep the Passover in the second month.\nFor they could not keep it at the regular\ntime, because a sufficient number of\npriests had not consecrated themselves,\nnor had the people gathered together at\nJerusalem.\nAnd the matter pleased the king and all\nthe assembly.\nSo they resolved to make a\nproclamation throughout all Israel, from\nBeersheba to Dan, that they should\ncome to keep the Passover to the LORD\nGod of Israel at Jerusalem, since they\nhad not done it for a long time in the\nprescribed manner.\nThen the runners went throughout all\nIsrael and Judah with the letters from\nthe king and his leaders, and spoke\naccording to the command of the king:\n\"Children of Israel, return to the LORD\nGod of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel; then\nHe will return to the remnant of you who\nhave escaped from the hand of the\nkings of Assyria.\nAnd do not be like your fathers and\nyour brethren, who trespassed against\nthe LORD God of their fathers, so that\nHe gave them up to desolation, as you\nsee.\nNow do not be stiff-necked, as your\nfathers were, but yield yourselves to the\nLORD; and enter His sanctuary, which\nHe has sanctified forever, and serve the\nLORD your God, that the fierceness of\nHis wrath may turn away from you.\nFor if you return to the LORD, your\nbrethren and your children will be\ntreated with compassion by those who\nlead them captive, so that they may\ncome back to this land; for the LORD\nyour God is gracious and merciful, and\nwill not turn His face from you if you\nreturn to Him.\"\nSo the runners passed from city to city\nthrough the country of Ephraim and\nManasseh, as far as Zebulun; but they\nlaughed at them and mocked them.\nNevertheless some from Asher,\nManasseh, and Zebulun humbled\nthemselves and came to Jerusalem.\nAlso the hand of God was on Judah to\ngive them singleness of heart to obey\nthe command of the king and the\nleaders, at the word of the LORD.\nNow many people, a very great\nassembly, gathered at Jerusalem to\nkeep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in\nthe second month.\nThey stood in their place according to\ntheir custom, according to the Law of\nMoses the man of God; the priests\nsprinkled the blood received from the\nhand of the Levites.\nFor there were many in the assembly\nwho had not sanctified themselves;\ntherefore the Levites had charge of the\nslaughter of the Passover lambs for\neveryone who was not clean, to sanctify\nthem to the LORD.\nFor a multitude of the people, many\nfrom Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and\nZebulun, had not cleansed themselves,\nyet they ate the Passover contrary to\nwhat was written. But Hezekiah prayed\nfor them, saying, \"May the good LORD\nprovide atonement for everyone\nwho prepares his heart to seek God,\nthe LORD God of his fathers, though he\nis not cleansed according to the\npurification of the sanctuary.\"\nAnd the LORD listened to Hezekiah\nand healed the people.\nThey arose and took away the altars\nthat were in Jerusalem, and they took\naway all the incense altars and cast\nthem into the Brook Kidron.\nSo the children of Israel who were\npresent at Jerusalem kept the Feast of\nUnleavened Bread seven days with\ngreat gladness; and the Levites and the\npriests praised the LORD day by day,\nsinging to the LORD, accompanied by\nloud instruments.\nThen they slaughtered the Passover\nlambs on the fourteenth day of the\nsecond month. The priests and the\nLevites were ashamed, and sanctified\nthemselves, and brought the burnt\nofferings to the house of the LORD.\nAnd Hezekiah gave encouragement to\nall the Levites who taught the good\nknowledge of the LORD; and they ate\nthroughout the feast seven days,\noffering peace offerings and making\nconfession to the LORD God of their\nfathers.\nThen the whole assembly agreed to\nkeep the feast another seven days, and\nthey kept it another seven days with\ngladness.\nhis service, the priests and Levites for\nburnt offerings and peace offerings, to\nserve, to give thanks, and to praise in\nthe gates of the camp of the LORD.\nFor Hezekiah king of Judah gave to\nthe assembly a thousand bulls and\nseven thousand sheep, and the leaders\ngave to the assembly a thousand bulls\nand ten thousand sheep; and a great\nnumber of priests sanctified themselves.\nThe king also appointed a portion of his\npossessions for the burnt offerings: for\nthe morning and evening burnt offerings,\nthe burnt offerings for the Sabbaths and\nthe New Moons and the set feasts, as it\nis written in the Law of the LORD.\nThe whole assembly of Judah rejoiced,\nalso the priests and Levites, all the\nassembly that came from Israel, the\nsojourners who came from the land of\nIsrael, and those who dwelt in Judah.\nMoreover he commanded the people\nwho dwelt in Jerusalem to contribute\nsupport for the priests and the Levites,\nthat they might devote themselves to the\nLaw of the LORD.\nSo there was great joy in Jerusalem,\nfor since the time of Solomon the son of\nDavid, king of Israel, there had been\nnothing like this in Jerusalem.\nThen the priests, the Levites, arose\nand blessed the people, and their voice\nwas heard; and their prayer came up to\nHis holy dwelling place, to heaven.\n31Now when all this was finished, all\nIsrael who were present went out to the\ncities of Judah and broke the sacred\npillars in pieces, cut down the wooden\nimages, and threw down the high places\nand the altars--from all Judah, Benjamin,\nEphraim, and Manasseh--until they had\nutterly destroyed them all. Then all the\nchildren of Israel returned to their own\ncities, every man to his possession.\nAnd Hezekiah appointed the divisions\nof the priests and the Levites according\nto their divisions, each man according to\nAs soon as the commandment was\ncirculated, the children of Israel brought\nin abundance the firstfruits of grain and\nwine, oil and honey, and of all the\nproduce of the field; and they brought in\nabundantly the tithe of everything.\nAnd the children of Israel and Judah,\nwho dwelt in the cities of Judah, brought\nthe tithe of oxen and sheep; also the\ntithe of holy things which were\nconsecrated to the LORD their God they\nlaid in heaps.\nIn the third month they began laying\nthem in heaps, and they finished in the\nseventh month.\nAnd when Hezekiah and the leaders\ncame and saw the heaps, they blessed\nthe LORD and His people Israel.\nThen Hezekiah questioned the priests\nand the Levites concerning the heaps.\nAnd Azariah the chief priest, from the\nhouse of Zadok, answered him and said,\n\"Since the people began to bring the\nofferings into the house of the LORD,\nwe have had enough to eat and have\nplenty left, for the LORD has blessed\nHis people; and what is left is this great\nabundance.\"\ndaily portion for the work of his service,\nby his division,\nNow Hezekiah commanded them to\nprepare rooms in the house of the\nLORD, and they prepared them.\nThen they faithfully brought in the\nofferings, the tithes, and the dedicated\nthings; Cononiah the Levite had charge\nof them, and Shimei his brother was the\nnext.\nJehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel,\nJerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah,\nMahath, and Benaiah were overseers\nunder the hand of Cononiah and Shimei\nhis brother, at the commandment of\nHezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler\nof the house of God.\nKore the son of Imnah the Levite, the\nkeeper of the East Gate, was over the\nfreewill offerings to God, to distribute the\nofferings of the LORD and the most holy\nthings.\nAnd under him were Eden, Miniamin,\nJeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and\nShecaniah, his faithful assistants in the\ncities of the priests, to distribute\nallotments to their brethren by divisions,\nto the great as well as the small.\nBesides those males from three years\nold and up who were written in the\ngenealogy, they distributed to everyone\nwho entered the house of the LORD his\nand to the priests who were written in\nthe genealogy according to their father's\nhouse, and to the Levites from twenty\nyears old and up according to their work,\nby their divisions,\nand to all who were written in the\ngenealogy--their little ones and their\nwives, their sons and daughters, the\nwhole company of them--for in their\nfaithfulness they sanctified themselves\nin holiness.\nAlso for the sons of Aaron the priests,\nwho were in the fields of the commonlands of their cities, in every single city,\nthere were men who were designated\nby name to distribute portions to all the\nmales among the priests and to all who\nwere listed by genealogies among the\nLevites.\nThus Hezekiah did throughout all\nJudah, and he did what was good and\nright and true before the LORD his God.\nAnd in every work that he began in the\nservice of the house of God, in the law\nand in the commandment, to seek his\nGod, he did it with all his heart. So he\nprospered.\n32After these deeds of faithfulness,\nSennacherib king of Assyria came and\nentered Judah; he encamped against\nthe fortified cities, thinking to win them\nover to himself.\nAnd when Hezekiah saw that\nSennacherib had come, and that his\npurpose was to make war against\nJerusalem,\nagainst Lachish), to Hezekiah king of\nJudah, and to all Judah who were in\nJerusalem, saying,\nhe consulted with his leaders and\ncommanders to stop the water from the\nsprings which were outside the city; and\nthey helped him.\nThus many people gathered together\nwho stopped all the springs and the\nbrook that ran through the land, saying,\n\"Why should the kings of Assyria come\nand find much water?\"\nAnd he strengthened himself, built up\nall the wall that was broken, raised it up\nto the towers, and built another wall\noutside; also he repaired the Millo in the\nCity of David, and made weapons and\nshields in abundance.\nThen he set military captains over the\npeople, gathered them together to him\nin the open square of the city gate, and\ngave them encouragement, saying,\n\"Be strong and courageous; do not be\nafraid nor dismayed before the king of\nAssyria, nor before all the multitude that\nis with him; for there are more with us\nthan with him.\n\"Thus says Sennacherib king of\nAssyria: \"In what do you trust, that you\nremain under siege in Jerusalem?\nDoes not Hezekiah persuade you to\ngive yourselves over to die by famine\nand by thirst, saying, \"The LORD our\nGod will deliver us from the hand of the\nking of Assyria\"?\nHas not the same Hezekiah taken\naway His high places and His altars,\nand commanded Judah and Jerusalem,\nsaying, \"You shall worship before one\naltar and burn incense on it\"?\nDo you not know what I and my\nfathers have done to all the peoples of\nother lands? Were the gods of the\nnations of those lands in any way able\nto deliver their lands out of my hand?\nWho was there among all the gods of\nthose nations that my fathers utterly\ndestroyed that could deliver his people\nfrom my hand, that your God should be\nable to deliver you from my hand?\nWith him is an arm of flesh; but with us\nis the LORD our God, to help us and to\nfight our battles.\" And the people were\nstrengthened by the words of Hezekiah\nking of Judah.\nNow therefore, do not let Hezekiah\ndeceive you or persuade you like this,\nand do not believe him; for no god of\nany nation or kingdom was able to\ndeliver his people from my hand or the\nhand of my fathers. How much less will\nyour God deliver you from my hand?\"'\nAfter this Sennacherib king of Assyria\nsent his servants to Jerusalem (but he\nand all the forces with him laid siege\nFurthermore, his servants spoke\nagainst the LORD God and against His\nservant Hezekiah.\nHe also wrote letters to revile the\nLORD God of Israel, and to speak\nagainst Him, saying, \"As the gods of the\nnations of other lands have not\ndelivered their people from my hand, so\nthe God of Hezekiah will not deliver His\npeople from my hand.\"\nThen they called out with a loud voice\nin Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem\nwho were on the wall, to frighten them\nand trouble them, that they might take\nthe city.\nAnd they spoke against the God of\nJerusalem, as against the gods of the\npeople of the earth--the work of men's\nhands.\nNow because of this King Hezekiah\nand the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz,\nprayed and cried out to heaven.\nIn those days Hezekiah was sick and\nnear death, and he prayed to the LORD;\nand He spoke to him and gave him a\nsign.\nBut Hezekiah did not repay according\nto the favor shown him, for his heart was\nlifted up; therefore wrath was looming\nover him and over Judah and Jerusalem.\nThen Hezekiah humbled himself for\nthe pride of his heart, he and the\ninhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the\nwrath of the LORD did not come upon\nthem in the days of Hezekiah.\nHezekiah had very great riches and\nhonor. And he made himself treasuries\nfor silver, for gold, for precious stones,\nfor spices, for shields, and for all kinds\nof desirable items;\nThen the LORD sent an angel who cut\ndown every mighty man of valor, leader,\nand captain in the camp of the king of\nAssyria. So he returned shamefaced to\nhis own land. And when he had gone\ninto the temple of his god, some of his\nown offspring struck him down with the\nsword there.\nstorehouses for the harvest of grain,\nwine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of\nlivestock, and folds for flocks.\nMoreover he provided cities for himself,\nand possessions of flocks and herds in\nabundance; for God had given him very\nmuch property.\nThus the LORD saved Hezekiah and\nthe inhabitants of Jerusalem from the\nhand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria,\nand from the hand of all others, and\nguided them on every side.\nThis same Hezekiah also stopped the\nwater outlet of Upper Gihon, and\nbrought the water by tunnel to the west\nside of the City of David. Hezekiah\nprospered in all his works.\nAnd many brought gifts to the LORD at\nJerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah\nking of Judah, so that he was exalted in\nthe sight of all nations thereafter.\nHowever, regarding the ambassadors\nof the princes of Babylon, whom they\nsent to him to inquire about the wonder\nthat was done in the land, God withdrew\nfrom him, in order to test him, that He\nmight know all that was in his heart.\nNow the rest of the acts of Hezekiah,\nand his goodness, indeed they are\nwritten in the vision of Isaiah the prophet,\nthe son of Amoz, and in the book of the\nkings of Judah and Israel.\nSo Hezekiah rested with his fathers,\nand they buried him in the upper tombs\nof the sons of David; and all Judah and\nthe inhabitants of Jerusalem honored\nhim at his death. Then Manasseh his\nson reigned in his place.\n33Manasseh was twelve years old\nwhen he became king, and he reigned\nfifty-five years in Jerusalem.\nBut he did evil in the sight of the LORD,\naccording to the abominations of the\nnations whom the LORD had cast out\nbefore the children of Israel.\nFor he rebuilt the high places which\nHezekiah his father had broken down;\nhe raised up altars for the Baals, and\nmade wooden images; and he\nworshiped all the host of heaven and\nserved them.\nHe also built altars in the house of the\nLORD, of which the LORD had said, \"In\nJerusalem shall My name be forever.\"\nAnd he built altars for all the host of\nheaven in the two courts of the house of\nthe LORD.\nAlso he caused his sons to pass\nthrough the fire in the Valley of the Son\nof Hinnom; he practiced soothsaying,\nused witchcraft and sorcery, and\nconsulted mediums and spiritists. He did\nmuch evil in the sight of the LORD, to\nprovoke Him to anger.\nHe even set a carved image, the idol\nwhich he had made, in the house of God,\nof which God had said to David and to\nSolomon his son, \"In this house and in\nJerusalem, which I have chosen out of\nall the tribes of Israel, I will put My name\nforever;\nand I will not again remove the foot of\nIsrael from the land which I have\nappointed for your fathers--only if they\nare careful to do all that I have\ncommanded them, according to the\nwhole law and the statutes and the\nordinances by the hand of Moses.\"\nSo Manasseh seduced Judah and the\ninhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil\nthan the nations whom the LORD had\ndestroyed before the children of Israel.\nAnd the LORD spoke to Manasseh\nand his people, but they would not listen.\nTherefore the LORD brought upon\nthem the captains of the army of the\nking of Assyria, who took Manasseh\nwith hooks, bound him with bronze\nfetters, and carried him off to Babylon.\nNow when he was in affliction, he\nimplored the LORD his God, and\nhumbled himself greatly before the God\nof his fathers,\nand prayed to Him; and He received\nhis entreaty, heard his supplication, and\nbrought him back to Jerusalem into his\nkingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the\nLORD was God.\nAfter this he built a wall outside the\nCity of David on the west side of Gihon,\nin the valley, as far as the entrance of\nthe Fish Gate; and it enclosed Ophel,\nand he raised it to a very great height.\nThen he put military captains in all the\nfortified cities of Judah.\nHe took away the foreign gods and the\nidol from the house of the LORD, and all\nthe altars that he had built in the mount\nof the house of the LORD and in\nJerusalem; and he cast them out of the\ncity.\nHe also repaired the altar of the LORD,\nsacrificed peace offerings and thank\nofferings on it, and commanded Judah\nto serve the LORD God of Israel.\nAmon was twenty-two years old when\nhe became king, and he reigned two\nyears in Jerusalem.\nBut he did evil in the sight of the LORD,\nas his father Manasseh had done; for\nAmon sacrificed to all the carved images\nwhich his father Manasseh had made,\nand served them.\nAnd he did not humble himself before\nthe LORD, as his father Manasseh had\nhumbled himself; but Amon trespassed\nmore and more.\nThen his servants conspired against\nhim, and killed him in his own house.\nBut the people of the land executed all\nthose who had conspired against King\nAmon. Then the people of the land\nmade his son Josiah king in his place.\n34Josiah was eight years old when\nNevertheless the people still sacrificed\non the high places, but only to the\nLORD their God.\nNow the rest of the acts of Manasseh,\nhis prayer to his God, and the words of\nthe seers who spoke to him in the name\nof the LORD God of Israel, indeed they\nare written in the book of the kings of\nIsrael.\nAlso his prayer and how God received\nhis entreaty, and all his sin and trespass,\nand the sites where he built high places\nand set up wooden images and carved\nimages, before he was humbled, indeed\nthey are written among the sayings of\nHozai.\nSo Manasseh rested with his fathers,\nand they buried him in his own house.\nThen his son Amon reigned in his place.\nhe became king, and he reigned thirtyone years in Jerusalem.\nAnd he did what was right in the sight\nof the LORD, and walked in the ways of\nhis father David; he did not turn aside to\nthe right hand or to the left.\nFor in the eighth year of his reign, while\nhe was still young, he began to seek the\nGod of his father David; and in the\ntwelfth year he began to purge Judah\nand Jerusalem of the high places, the\nwooden images, the carved images, and\nthe molded images.\nThey broke down the altars of the Baals\nin his presence, and the incense altars\nwhich were above them he cut down;\nand the wooden images, the carved\nimages, and the molded images he\nbroke in pieces, and made dust of them\nand scattered it on the graves of those\nwho had sacrificed to them.\nHe also burned the bones of the priests\non their altars, and cleansed Judah and\nJerusalem.\nAnd so he did in the cities of Manasseh,\nEphraim, and Simeon, as far as Naphtali\nand all around, with axes.\nWhen he had broken down the altars\nand the wooden images, had beaten the\ncarved images into powder, and cut\ndown all the incense altars throughout\nall the land of Israel, he returned to\nJerusalem.\nof the LORD, to repair and restore the\nhouse.\nThey gave it to the craftsmen and\nbuilders to buy hewn stone and timber\nfor beams, and to floor the houses\nwhich the kings of Judah had destroyed.\nAnd the men did the work faithfully.\nTheir overseers were Jahath and\nObadiah the Levites, of the sons of\nMerari, and Zechariah and Meshullam,\nof the sons of the Kohathites, to\nsupervise. Others of the Levites, all of\nwhom were skillful with instruments of\nmusic,\nwere over the burden bearers and\nwere overseers of all who did work in\nany kind of service. And some of the\nLevites were scribes, officers, and\ngatekeepers.\nIn the eighteenth year of his reign,\nwhen he had purged the land and the\ntemple, he sent Shaphan the son of\nAzaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the\ncity, and Joah the son of Joahaz the\nrecorder, to repair the house of the\nLORD his God.\nWhen they came to Hilkiah the high\npriest, they delivered the money that\nwas brought into the house of God,\nwhich the Levites who kept the doors\nhad gathered from the hand of\nManasseh and Ephraim, from all the\nremnant of Israel, from all Judah and\nBenjamin, and which they had brought\nback to Jerusalem.\nNow when they brought out the money\nthat was brought into the house of the\nLORD, Hilkiah the priest found the Book\nof the Law of the LORD given by Moses.\nThen Hilkiah answered and said to\nShaphan the scribe, \"I have found the\nBook of the Law in the house of the\nLORD.\" And Hilkiah gave the book to\nShaphan.\nSo Shaphan carried the book to the\nking, bringing the king word, saying, \"All\nthat was committed to your servants\nthey are doing.\nThen they put it in the hand of the\nforemen who had the oversight of the\nhouse of the LORD; and they gave it to\nthe workmen who worked in the house\nAnd they have gathered the money\nthat was found in the house of the\nLORD, and have delivered it into the\nhand of the\nworkmen.\"\noverseers\nand\nthe\nThen Shaphan the scribe told the king,\nsaying, \"Hilkiah the priest has given me\na book.\" And Shaphan read it before the\nking.\nThus it happened, when the king\nheard the words of the Law, that he tore\nhis clothes.\nThen the king commanded Hilkiah,\nAhikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the\nson of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and\nAsaiah a servant of the king, saying,\n\"Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and\nfor those who are left in Israel and\nJudah, concerning the words of the\nbook that is found; for great is the wrath\nof the LORD that is poured out on us,\nbecause our fathers have not kept the\nword of the LORD, to do according to all\nthat is written in this book.\"\nSo Hilkiah and those the king had\nappointed\nwent\nto\nHuldah\nthe\nprophetess, the wife of Shallum the son\nof Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of\nthe wardrobe. (She dwelt in Jerusalem\nin the Second Quarter.) And they spoke\nto her to that effect.\nThen she answered them, \"Thus says\nthe LORD God of Israel, \"Tell the man\nwho sent you to Me,\n\"Thus says the LORD: \"Behold, I will\nbring calamity on this place and on its\ninhabitants, all the curses that are\nwritten in the book which they have read\nbefore the king of Judah,\nbecause they have forsaken Me and\nburned incense to other gods, that they\nmight provoke Me to anger with all the\nworks of their hands. Therefore My\nwrath will be poured out on this place,\nand not be quenched.\"\"\nBut as for the king of Judah, who sent\nyou to inquire of the LORD, in this\nmanner you shall speak to him, \"Thus\nsays the LORD God of Israel:\n\"Concerning the words which you have\nheard-27\nbecause your heart was tender, and\nyou humbled yourself before God when\nyou heard His words against this place\nand against its inhabitants, and you\nhumbled yourself before Me, and you\ntore your clothes and wept before Me, I\nalso have heard you,\" says the LORD.\n\"Surely I will gather you to your fathers,\nand you shall be gathered to your grave\nin peace; and your eyes shall not see all\nthe calamity which I will bring on this\nplace and its inhabitants.\"\"' So they\nbrought back word to the king.\nThen the king sent and gathered all\nthe elders of Judah and Jerusalem.\nThe king went up to the house of the\nLORD, with all the men of Judah and\nthe inhabitants of Jerusalem--the priests\nand the Levites, and all the people,\ngreat and small. And he read in their\nhearing all the words of the Book of the\nCovenant which had been found in the\nhouse of the LORD.\nThen the king stood in his place and\nmade a covenant before the LORD, to\nfollow the LORD, and to keep His\ncommandments and His testimonies\nand His statutes with all his heart and all\nhis soul, to perform the words of the\ncovenant that were written in this book.\nAnd stand in the holy place according\nto the divisions of the fathers' houses of\nyour brethren the lay people, and\naccording to the division of the father's\nhouse of the Levites.\nAnd he made all who were present in\nJerusalem and Benjamin take a stand.\nSo the inhabitants of Jerusalem did\naccording to the covenant of God, the\nGod of their fathers.\nSo slaughter the Passover offerings,\nconsecrate yourselves, and prepare\nthem for your brethren, that they may do\naccording to the word of the LORD by\nthe hand of Moses.\"\nThus Josiah removed all the\nabominations from all the country that\nbelonged to the children of Israel, and\nmade all who were present in Israel\ndiligently serve the LORD their God. All\nhis days they did not depart from\nfollowing the LORD God of their fathers.\n35Now Josiah kept a Passover to\nthe LORD in Jerusalem, and they\nslaughtered the Passover lambs on the\nfourteenth day of the first month.\nAnd he set the priests in their duties\nand encouraged them for the service of\nthe house of the LORD.\nThen he said to the Levites who taught\nall Israel, who were holy to the LORD:\n\"Put the holy ark in the house which\nSolomon the son of David, king of Israel,\nbuilt. It shall no longer be a burden on\nyour shoulders. Now serve the LORD\nyour God and His people Israel.\nPrepare yourselves according to your\nfathers' houses, according to your\ndivisions,\nfollowing\nthe\nwritten\ninstruction of David king of Israel and\nthe written instruction of Solomon his\nson.\nThen Josiah gave the lay people lambs\nand young goats from the flock, all for\nPassover offerings for all who were\npresent, to the number of thirty\nthousand, as well as three thousand\ncattle; these were from the king's\npossessions.\nAnd his leaders gave willingly to the\npeople, to the priests, and to the Levites.\nHilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of\nthe house of God, gave to the priests for\nthe Passover offerings two thousand six\nhundred from the flock, and three\nhundred cattle.\nAlso Conaniah, his brothers Shemaiah\nand Nethanel, and Hashabiah and Jeiel\nand Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave\nto the Levites for Passover offerings five\nthousand from the flock and five\nhundred cattle.\nSo the service was prepared, and the\npriests stood in their places, and the\nLevites in their divisions, according to\nthe king's command.\nAnd they slaughtered the Passover\nofferings; and the priests sprinkled the\nblood with their hands, while the Levites\nskinned the animals.\nThen they removed the burnt offerings\nthat they might give them to the\ndivisions of the fathers' houses of the lay\npeople, to offer to the LORD, as it is\nwritten in the Book of Moses. And so\nthey did with the cattle.\nthe prophet; and none of the kings of\nIsrael had kept such a Passover as\nJosiah kept, with the priests and the\nLevites, all Judah and Israel who were\npresent, and the inhabitants of\nJerusalem.\nAlso they roasted the Passover\nofferings with fire according to the\nordinance; but the other holy offerings\nthey boiled in pots, in caldrons, and in\npans, and divided them quickly among\nall the lay people.\nThen afterward they prepared portions\nfor themselves and for the priests,\nbecause the priests, the sons of Aaron,\nwere busy in offering burnt offerings and\nfat until night; therefore the Levites\nprepared portions for themselves and\nfor the priests, the sons of Aaron.\nAnd the singers, the sons of Asaph,\nwere in their places, according to the\ncommand of David, Asaph, Heman, and\nJeduthun the king's seer. Also the\ngatekeepers were at each gate; they did\nnot have to leave their position, because\ntheir brethren the Levites prepared\nportions for them.\nSo all the service of the LORD was\nprepared the same day, to keep the\nPassover and to offer burnt offerings on\nthe altar of the LORD, according to the\ncommand of King Josiah.\nIn the eighteenth year of the reign of\nJosiah this Passover was kept.\nAfter all this, when Josiah had\nprepared the temple, Necho king of\nEgypt came up to fight against\nCarchemish by the Euphrates; and\nJosiah went out against him.\nBut he sent messengers to him, saying,\n\"What have I to do with you, king of\nJudah? I have not come against you this\nday, but against the house with which I\nhave war; for God commanded me to\nmake haste. Refrain from meddling with\nGod, who is with me, lest He destroy\nyou.\"\nNevertheless Josiah would not turn his\nface from him, but disguised himself so\nthat he might fight with him, and did not\nheed the words of Necho from the\nmouth of God. So he came to fight in the\nValley of Megiddo.\nAnd the archers shot King Josiah; and\nthe king said to his servants, \"Take me\naway, for I am severely wounded.\"\nAnd the children of Israel who were\npresent kept the Passover at that time,\nand the Feast of Unleavened Bread for\nseven days.\nThere had been no Passover kept in\nIsrael like that since the days of Samuel\nHis servants therefore took him out of\nthat chariot and put him in the second\nchariot that he had, and they brought\nhim to Jerusalem. So he died, and was\nburied in one of the tombs of his fathers.\nAnd all Judah and Jerusalem mourned\nfor Josiah.\nJeremiah also lamented for Josiah.\nAnd to this day all the singing men and\nthe singing women speak of Josiah in\ntheir lamentations. They made it a\ncustom in Israel; and indeed they are\nwritten in the Laments.\nNow the rest of the acts of Josiah and\nhis goodness, according to what was\nwritten in the Law of the LORD,\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came\nup against him, and bound him in\nbronze fetters to carry him off to\nBabylon.\nNebuchadnezzar also carried off some\nof the articles from the house of the\nLORD to Babylon, and put them in his\ntemple at Babylon.\nand his deeds from first to last, indeed\nthey are written in the book of the kings\nof Israel and Judah.\n36Then the people of the land took\nJehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made\nhim king in his father's place in\nJerusalem.\nJehoahaz was twenty-three years old\nwhen he became king, and he reigned\nthree months in Jerusalem.\nNow the king of Egypt deposed him at\nJerusalem; and he imposed on the land\na tribute of one hundred talents of silver\nand a talent of gold.\nThen the king of Egypt made\nJehoahaz's brother Eliakim king over\nJudah and Jerusalem, and changed his\nname to Jehoiakim. And Necho took\nJehoahaz his brother and carried him off\nto Egypt.\nJehoiakim was twenty-five years old\nwhen he became king, and he reigned\neleven years in Jerusalem. And he did\nevil in the sight of the LORD his God.\nNow the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim,\nthe abominations which he did, and\nwhat was found against him, indeed\nthey are written in the book of the kings\nof Israel and Judah. Then Jehoiachin his\nson reigned in his place.\nJehoiachin was eight years old when\nhe became king, and he reigned in\nJerusalem three months and ten days.\nAnd he did evil in the sight of the LORD.\nAt the turn of the year King\nNebuchadnezzar summoned him and\ntook him to Babylon, with the costly\narticles from the house of the LORD,\nand made Zedekiah, Jehoiakim's\nbrother, king over Judah and Jerusalem.\nZedekiah was twenty-one years old\nwhen he became king, and he reigned\neleven years in Jerusalem.\nHe did evil in the sight of the LORD his\nGod, and did not humble himself before\nJeremiah the prophet, who spoke from\nthe mouth of the LORD.\nAnd he also rebelled against King\nNebuchadnezzar, who had made him\nswear an oath by God; but he stiffened\nhis neck and hardened his heart against\nturning to the LORD God of Israel.\nMoreover all the leaders of the priests\nand the people transgressed more and\nmore, according to all the abominations\nof the nations, and defiled the house of\nthe LORD which He had consecrated in\nJerusalem.\nAnd the LORD God of their fathers\nsent warnings to them by His\nmessengers, rising up early and sending\nthem, because He had compassion on\nHis people and on His dwelling place.\nBut they mocked the messengers of\nGod, despised His words, and scoffed at\nHis prophets, until the wrath of the\nLORD arose against His people, till\nthere was no remedy.\nTherefore He brought against them the\nking of the Chaldeans, who killed their\nyoung men with the sword in the house\nof their sanctuary, and had no\ncompassion on young man or virgin, on\nthe aged or the weak; He gave them all\ninto his hand.\nAnd all the articles from the house of\nGod, great and small, the treasures of\nthe house of the LORD, and the\ntreasures of the king and of his leaders,\nall these he took to Babylon.\nThen they burned the house of God,\nbroke down the wall of Jerusalem,\nburned all its palaces with fire, and\ndestroyed all its precious possessions.\nAnd those who escaped from the\nsword he carried away to Babylon,\nwhere they became servants to him and\nhis sons until the rule of the kingdom of\nPersia,\nto fulfill the word of the LORD by the\nmouth of Jeremiah, until the land had\nenjoyed her Sabbaths.

And He has\ncommanded me to build Him a house at\nJerusalem which is in Judah.\nwith precious things, besides all that\nwas willingly offered.\nKing Cyrus also brought out the articles\nof the house of the LORD, which\nNebuchadnezzar had taken from\nJerusalem and put in the temple of his\ngods;\nand Cyrus king of Persia brought them\nout by the hand of Mithredath the\ntreasurer, and counted them out to\nSheshbazzar the prince of Judah.\nThis is the number of them: thirty gold\nplatters, one thousand silver platters,\ntwenty-nine knives,\nWho is among you of all His people?\nMay his God be with him, and let him go\nup to Jerusalem which is in Judah, and\nbuild the house of the LORD God of\nIsrael (He is God), which is in Jerusalem.\nthirty gold basins, four hundred and\nten silver basins of a similar kind, and\none thousand other articles.\nAnd whoever is left in any place where\nhe dwells, let the men of his place help\nhim with silver and gold, with goods and\nlivestock, besides the freewill offerings\nfor the house of God which is in\nJerusalem.\nThen the heads of the fathers' houses\nof Judah and Benjamin, and the priests\nand the Levites, with all whose spirits\nGod had moved, arose to go up and\nbuild the house of the LORD which is in\nJerusalem.\nAnd all those who were around them\nencouraged them with articles of silver\nand gold, with goods and livestock, and\nAll the articles of gold and silver were\nfive thousand four hundred. All these\nSheshbazzar took with the captives who\nwere brought from Babylon to\nJerusalem.\n2Now these are the people of the\nprovince who came back from the\ncaptivity, of those who had been carried\naway, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king\nof Babylon had carried away to Babylon,\nand who returned to Jerusalem and\nJudah, everyone to his own city.\nThose who came with Zerubbabel were\nJeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah,\nMordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai,\nRehum, and Baanah.

and they had two hundred men\nand women singers.\n3And when the seventh month had\ncome, and the children of Israel were in\nthe cities, the people gathered together\nas one man to Jerusalem.\nThen Jeshua the son of Jozadak and\nhis brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel\nthe son of Shealtiel and his brethren,\narose and built the altar of the God of\nIsrael, to offer burnt offerings on it, as it\nis written in the Law of Moses the man\nof God.\nThough fear had come upon them\nbecause of the people of those\ncountries, they set the altar on its bases;\nand they offered burnt offerings on it to\nthe LORD, both the morning and\nevening burnt offerings.\nsons of Henadad with their sons and\ntheir brethren the Levites.\nThey also kept the Feast of\nTabernacles, as it is written, and offered\nthe daily burnt offerings in the number\nrequired by ordinance for each day.\nAfterwards they offered the regular\nburnt offering, and those for New Moons\nand for all the appointed feasts of the\nLORD that were consecrated, and those\nof everyone who willingly offered a\nfreewill offering to the LORD.\nFrom the first day of the seventh month\nthey began to offer burnt offerings to the\nLORD, although the foundation of the\ntemple of the LORD had not been laid.\nThey also gave money to the masons\nand the carpenters, and food, drink, and\noil to the people of Sidon and Tyre to\nbring cedar logs from Lebanon to the\nsea, to Joppa, according to the\npermission which they had from Cyrus\nking of Persia.\nNow in the second month of the second\nyear of their coming to the house of God\nat Jerusalem, Zerubbabel the son of\nShealtiel, Jeshua the son of Jozadak,\nand the rest of their brethren the priests\nand the Levites, and all those who had\ncome out of the captivity to Jerusalem,\nbegan work and appointed the Levites\nfrom twenty years old and above to\noversee the work of the house of the\nLORD.\nThen Jeshua with his sons and\nbrothers, Kadmiel with his sons, and the\nsons of Judah, arose as one to oversee\nthose working on the house of God: the\nWhen the builders laid the foundation\nof the temple of the LORD, the priests\nstood in their apparel with trumpets, and\nthe Levites, the sons of Asaph, with\ncymbals, to praise the LORD, according\nto the ordinance of David king of Israel.\nAnd they sang responsively, praising\nand giving thanks to the LORD: \"For He\nis good, For His mercy endures forever\ntoward Israel.\" Then all the people\nshouted with a great shout, when they\npraised the LORD, because the\nfoundation of the house of the LORD\nwas laid.\nBut many of the priests and Levites\nand heads of the fathers' houses, old\nmen who had seen the first temple, wept\nwith a loud voice when the foundation of\nthis temple was laid before their eyes.\nYet many shouted aloud for joy,\nso that the people could not discern\nthe noise of the shout of joy from the\nnoise of the weeping of the people, for\nthe people shouted with a loud shout,\nand the sound was heard afar off.\n4Now when the adversaries of Judah\nand\nBenjamin\nheard\nthat\nthe\ndescendants of the captivity were\nbuilding the temple of the LORD God of\nIsrael,\nthey came to Zerubbabel and the\nheads of the fathers' houses, and said to\nthem, \"Let us build with you, for we seek\nyour God as you do; and we have\nsacrificed to Him since the days of\nEsarhaddon king of Assyria, who\nbrought us here.\"\nErech and Babylon and Shushan, the\nDehavites, the Elamites,\nBut Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the\nrest of the heads of the fathers' houses\nof Israel said to them, \"You may do\nnothing with us to build a house for our\nGod; but we alone will build to the\nLORD God of Israel, as King Cyrus the\nking of Persia has commanded us.\"\nThen the people of the land tried to\ndiscourage the people of Judah. They\ntroubled them in building,\nand hired counselors against them to\nfrustrate their purpose all the days of\nCyrus king of Persia, even until the reign\nof Darius king of Persia.\nand the rest of the nations whom the\ngreat and noble Osnapper took captive\nand settled in the cities of Samaria and\nthe remainder beyond the River --and so\nforth.\n(This is a copy of the letter that they\nsent him) To King Artaxerxes from your\nservants, the men of the region beyond\nthe River, and so forth:\nLet it be known to the king that the\nJews who came up from you have come\nto us at Jerusalem, and are building the\nrebellious and evil city, and are finishing\nits walls and repairing the foundations.\nIn the reign of Ahasuerus, in the\nbeginning of his reign, they wrote an\naccusation against the inhabitants of\nJudah and Jerusalem.\nLet it now be known to the king that, if\nthis city is built and the walls completed,\nthey will not pay tax, tribute, or custom,\nand the king's treasury will be\ndiminished.\nIn the days of Artaxerxes also, Bishlam,\nMithredath, Tabel, and the rest of their\ncompanions wrote to Artaxerxes king of\nPersia; and the letter was written in\nAramaic script, and translated into the\nAramaic language.\nRehum the commander and Shimshai\nthe scribe wrote a letter against\nJerusalem to King Artaxerxes in this\nfashion:\nFrom\nRehum\nthe\ncommander,\nShimshai the scribe, and the rest of their\ncompanions--representatives of the\nDinaites, the Apharsathchites, the\nTarpelites, the people of Persia and\nNow because we receive support from\nthe palace, it was not proper for us to\nsee the king's dishonor; therefore we\nhave sent and informed the king,\nthat search may be made in the book\nof the records of your fathers. And you\nwill find in the book of the records and\nknow that this city is a rebellious city,\nharmful to kings and provinces, and that\nthey have incited sedition within the city\nin former times, for which cause this city\nwas destroyed.\nWe inform the king that if this city is\nrebuilt and its walls are completed, the\nresult will be that you will have no\ndominion beyond the River.\nThe king sent an answer: To Rehum\nthe commander, to Shimshai the scribe,\nto the rest of their companions who\ndwell in Samaria, and to the remainder\nbeyond the River: Peace, and so forth.\nThe letter which you sent to us has\nbeen clearly read before me.\nAnd I gave the command, and a\nsearch has been made, and it was\nfound that this city in former times has\nrevolted against kings, and rebellion and\nsedition have been fostered in it.\nThere have also been mighty kings\nover Jerusalem, who have ruled over all\nthe region beyond the River; and tax,\ntribute, and custom were paid to them.\nNow give the command to make these\nmen cease, that this city may not be\nbuilt until the command is given by me.\nTake heed now that you do not fail to\ndo this. Why should damage increase to\nthe hurt of the kings?\n5Then the prophet Haggai and\nZechariah the son of Iddo, prophets,\nprophesied to the Jews who were in\nJudah and Jerusalem, in the name of\nthe God of Israel, who was over them.\nSo Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and\nJeshua the son of Jozadak rose up and\nbegan to build the house of God which\nis in Jerusalem; and the prophets of\nGod were with them, helping them.\nAt the same time Tattenai the governor\nof the region beyond the River and\nShethar-Boznai and their companions\ncame to them and spoke thus to them:\n\"Who has commanded you to build this\ntemple and finish this wall?\"\nThen, accordingly, we told them the\nnames of the men who were\nconstructing this building.\nBut the eye of their God was upon the\nelders of the Jews, so that they could\nnot make them cease till a report could\ngo to Darius. Then a written answer was\nreturned concerning this matter.\nNow when the copy of King\nArtaxerxes' letter was read before\nRehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their\ncompanions, they went up in haste to\nJerusalem against the Jews, and by\nforce of arms made them cease.\nThis is a copy of the letter that Tattenai\nsent: The governor of the region beyond\nthe River, and Shethar-Boznai, and his\ncompanions, the Persians who were in\nthe region beyond the River, to Darius\nthe king.\nThus the work of the house of God\nwhich is at Jerusalem ceased, and it\nwas discontinued until the second year\nof the reign of Darius king of Persia.\n(They sent a letter to him, in which was\nwritten thus) To Darius the king: All\npeace.\nLet it be known to the king that we went\ninto the province of Judea, to the temple\nof the great God, which is being built\nwith heavy stones, and timber is being\nlaid in the walls; and this work goes on\ndiligently and prospers in their hands.\nAnd he said to him, \"Take these\narticles; go, carry them to the temple\nsite that is in Jerusalem, and let the\nhouse of God be rebuilt on its former\nsite.'\nThen we asked those elders, and\nspoke thus to them: \"Who commanded\nyou to build this temple and to finish\nthese walls?\"\nWe also asked them their names to\ninform you, that we might write the\nnames of the men who were chief\namong them.\nAnd thus they returned us an answer,\nsaying: \"We are the servants of the God\nof heaven and earth, and we are\nrebuilding the temple that was built\nmany years ago, which a great king of\nIsrael built and completed.\nBut because our fathers provoked the\nGod of heaven to wrath, He gave them\ninto the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of\nBabylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed\nthis temple and carried the people away\nto Babylon.\nHowever, in the first year of Cyrus king\nof Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree\nto build this house of God.\nThen the same Sheshbazzar came\nand laid the foundation of the house of\nGod which is in Jerusalem; but from that\ntime even until now it has been under\nconstruction, and it is not finished.\"\nNow therefore, if it seems good to the\nking, let a search be made in the king's\ntreasure house, which is there in\nBabylon, whether it is so that a decree\nwas issued by King Cyrus to build this\nhouse of God at Jerusalem, and let the\nking send us his pleasure concerning\nthis matter.\n6Then King Darius issued a decree,\nand a search was made in the archives,\nwhere the treasures were stored in\nBabylon.\nAnd at Achmetha, in the palace that is\nin the province of Media, a scroll was\nfound, and in it a record was written\nthus:\nAlso, the gold and silver articles of the\nhouse of God, which Nebuchadnezzar\nhad taken from the temple that was in\nJerusalem and carried into the temple of\nBabylon--those King Cyrus took from\nthe temple of Babylon, and they were\ngiven to one named Sheshbazzar,\nwhom he had made governor.\nIn the first year of King Cyrus, King\nCyrus issued a decree concerning the\nhouse of God at Jerusalem: \"Let the\nhouse be rebuilt, the place where they\noffered\nsacrifices;\nand\nlet\nthe\nfoundations of it be firmly laid, its height\nsixty cubits and its width sixty cubits,\nwith three rows of heavy stones and\none row of new timber. Let the\nexpenses be paid from the king's\ntreasury.\nAlso let the gold and silver articles of\nthe\nhouse\nof\nGod,\nwhich\nNebuchadnezzar took from the temple\nwhich is in Jerusalem and brought to\nBabylon, be restored and taken back to\nthe temple which is in Jerusalem, each\nto its place; and deposit them in the\nhouse of God\"--\nAlso I issue a decree that whoever\nalters this edict, let a timber be pulled\nfrom his house and erected, and let him\nbe hanged on it; and let his house be\nmade a refuse heap because of this.\nAnd may the God who causes His\nname to dwell there destroy any king or\npeople who put their hand to alter it, or\nto destroy this house of God which is in\nJerusalem. I Darius issue a decree; let it\nbe done diligently.\nNow therefore, Tattenai, governor of\nthe region beyond the River, and\nShethar-Boznai, and your companions\nthe Persians who are beyond the River,\nkeep yourselves far from there.\nThen Tattenai, governor of the region\nbeyond the River, Shethar-Boznai, and\ntheir\ncompanions\ndiligently\ndid\naccording to what King Darius had sent.\nLet the work of this house of God\nalone; let the governor of the Jews and\nthe elders of the Jews build this house\nof God on its site.\nMoreover I issue a decree as to what\nyou shall do for the elders of these Jews,\nfor the building of this house of God: Let\nthe cost be paid at the king's expense\nfrom taxes on the region beyond the\nRiver; this is to be given immediately to\nthese men, so that they are not hindered.\nSo the elders of the Jews built, and\nthey prospered through the prophesying\nof Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the\nson of Iddo. And they built and finished\nit, according to the commandment of the\nGod of Israel, and according to the\ncommand of Cyrus, Darius, and\nArtaxerxes king of Persia.\nNow the temple was finished on the\nthird day of the month of Adar, which\nwas in the sixth year of the reign of King\nDarius.\nAnd whatever they need--young bulls,\nrams, and lambs for the burnt offerings\nof the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine,\nand oil, according to the request of the\npriests who are in Jerusalem--let it be\ngiven them day by day without fail,\nThen the children of Israel, the priests\nand the Levites and the rest of the\ndescendants of the captivity, celebrated\nthe dedication of this house of God with\njoy.\nthat they may offer sacrifices of sweet\naroma to the God of heaven, and pray\nfor the life of the king and his sons.\nAnd they offered sacrifices at the\ndedication of this house of God, one\nhundred bulls, two hundred rams, four\nhundred lambs, and as a sin offering for\nall Israel twelve male goats, according\nto the number of the tribes of Israel.\nThey assigned the priests to their\ndivisions and the Levites to their\ndivisions, over the service of God in\nJerusalem, as it is written in the Book of\nMoses.\nAnd the descendants of the captivity\nkept the Passover on the fourteenth day\nof the first month.\nFor the priests and the Levites had\npurified themselves; all of them were\nritually clean. And they slaughtered the\nPassover lambs for all the descendants\nof the captivity, for their brethren the\npriests, and for themselves.\nThen the children of Israel who had\nreturned from the captivity ate together\nwith all who had separated themselves\nfrom the filth of the nations of the land in\norder to seek the LORD God of Israel.\nAnd they kept the Feast of\nUnleavened Bread seven days with joy;\nfor the LORD made them joyful, and\nturned the heart of the king of Assyria\ntoward them, to strengthen their hands\nin the work of the house of God, the\nGod of Israel.\nthe son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi,\nthe son of Bukki,\nthe son of Abishua, the son of\nPhinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of\nAaron the chief priest-6\nthis Ezra came up from Babylon; and\nhe was a skilled scribe in the Law of\nMoses, which the LORD God of Israel\nhad given. The king granted him all his\nrequest, according to the hand of the\nLORD his God upon him.\nSome of the children of Israel, the\npriests, the Levites, the singers, the\ngatekeepers, and the Nethinim came up\nto Jerusalem in the seventh year of King\nArtaxerxes.\nAnd Ezra came to Jerusalem in the fifth\nmonth, which was in the seventh year of\nthe king.\nOn the first day of the first month he\nbegan his journey from Babylon, and on\nthe first day of the fifth month he came\nto Jerusalem, according to the good\nhand of his God upon him.\n7Now after these things, in the reign of\nArtaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son\nof Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son\nof Hilkiah,\nthe son of Shallum, the son of Zadok,\nthe son of Ahitub,\nthe son of Amariah, the son of Azariah,\nthe son of Meraioth,\nFor Ezra had prepared his heart to\nseek the Law of the LORD, and to do it,\nand to teach statutes and ordinances in\nIsrael.\nThis is a copy of the letter that King\nArtaxerxes gave Ezra the priest, the\nscribe, expert in the words of the\ncommandments of the LORD, and of\nHis statutes to Israel:\nArtaxerxes, king of kings, To Ezra the\npriest, a scribe of the Law of the God of\nheaven: Perfect peace, and so forth.\nAnd whatever more may be needed\nfor the house of your God, which you\nmay have occasion to provide, pay for it\nfrom the king's treasury.\nI issue a decree that all those of the\npeople of Israel and the priests and\nLevites in my realm, who volunteer to go\nup to Jerusalem, may go with you.\nAnd whereas you are being sent by\nthe king and his seven counselors to\ninquire\nconcerning\nJudah\nand\nJerusalem, with regard to the Law of\nyour God which is in your hand;\nand whereas you are to carry the silver\nand gold which the king and his\ncounselors have freely offered to the\nGod of Israel, whose dwelling is in\nJerusalem;\nand whereas all the silver and gold\nthat you may find in all the province of\nBabylon, along with the freewill offering\nof the people and the priests, are to be\nfreely offered for the house of their God\nin Jerusalem-17\nnow therefore, be careful to buy with\nthis money bulls, rams, and lambs, with\ntheir grain offerings and their drink\nofferings, and offer them on the altar of\nthe house of your God in Jerusalem.\nAnd whatever seems good to you and\nyour brethren to do with the rest of the\nsilver and the gold, do it according to the\nwill of your God.\nAlso the articles that are given to you\nfor the service of the house of your God,\ndeliver in full before the God of\nJerusalem.\nAnd I, even I, Artaxerxes the king,\nissue a decree to all the treasurers who\nare in the region beyond the River, that\nwhatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of\nthe Law of the God of heaven, may\nrequire of you, let it be done diligently,\nup to one hundred talents of silver,\none hundred kors of wheat, one\nhundred baths of wine, one hundred\nbaths of oil, and salt without prescribed\nlimit.\nWhatever is commanded by the God\nof heaven, let it diligently be done for the\nhouse of the God of heaven. For why\nshould there be wrath against the realm\nof the king and his sons?\nAlso we inform you that it shall not be\nlawful to impose tax, tribute, or custom\non any of the priests, Levites, singers,\ngatekeepers, Nethinim, or servants of\nthis house of God.\nAnd you, Ezra, according to your Godgiven wisdom, set magistrates and\njudges who may judge all the people\nwho are in the region beyond the River,\nall such as know the laws of your God;\nand teach those who do not know them.\nWhoever will not observe the law of\nyour God and the law of the king, let\njudgment be executed speedily on him,\nwhether it be death, or banishment, or\nconfiscation of goods, or imprisonment.\nBlessed be the LORD God of our\nfathers, who has put such a thing as this\nin the king's heart, to beautify the house\nof the LORD which is in Jerusalem,\nof the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of\nJehiel, and with him two hundred and\neighteen males;\nand has extended mercy to me before\nthe king and his counselors, and before\nall the king's mighty princes. So I was\nencouraged, as the hand of the LORD\nmy God was upon me; and I gathered\nleading men of Israel to go up with me.\n8These are the heads of their fathers'\nhouses, and this is the genealogy of\nthose who went up with me from\nBabylon, in the reign of King Artaxerxes:\nof the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of\nthe sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons\nof David, Hattush;\nof the sons of Shelomith, BenJosiphiah, and with him one hundred\nand sixty males;\nof the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the\nson of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight\nmales;\nof the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son\nof Hakkatan, and with him one hundred\nand ten males;\nof the last sons of Adonikam, whose\nnames are these--Eliphelet, Jeiel, and\nShemaiah--and with them sixty males;\nalso of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and\nZabbud, and with them seventy males.\nof the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of\nParosh, Zechariah; and registered with\nhim were one hundred and fifty males;\nof the sons of Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai\nthe son of Zerahiah, and with him two\nhundred males;\nof the sons of Shechaniah, BenJahaziel, and with him three hundred\nmales;\nNow I gathered them by the river that\nflows to Ahava, and we camped there\nthree days. And I looked among the\npeople and the priests, and found none\nof the sons of Levi there.\nThen I sent for Eliezer, Ariel,\nShemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan,\nNathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam,\nleaders; also for Joiarib and Elnathan,\nmen of understanding.\nof the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of\nJonathan, and with him fifty males;\nof the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son\nof Athaliah, and with him seventy males;\nof the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah\nthe son of Michael, and with him eighty\nmales;\nAnd I gave them a command for Iddo\nthe chief man at the place Casiphia, and\nI told them what they should say to Iddo\nand his brethren the Nethinim at the\nplace Casiphia--that they should bring\nus servants for the house of our God.\nThen, by the good hand of our God\nupon us, they brought us a man of\nunderstanding, of the sons of Mahli the\nson of Levi, the son of Israel, namely\nSherebiah, with his sons and brothers,\neighteen men;\nand Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah\nof the sons of Merari, his brothers and\ntheir sons, twenty men;\nalso of the Nethinim, whom David and\nthe leaders had appointed for the\nservice of the Levites, two hundred and\ntwenty Nethinim. All of them were\ndesignated by name.\nThen I proclaimed a fast there at the\nriver of Ahava, that we might humble\nourselves before our God, to seek from\nHim the right way for us and our little\nones and all our possessions.\nFor I was ashamed to request of the\nking an escort of soldiers and horsemen\nto help us against the enemy on the\nroad, because we had spoken to the\nking, saying, \"The hand of our God is\nupon all those for good who seek Him,\nbut His power and His wrath are against\nall those who forsake Him.\"\nSo we fasted and entreated our God\nfor this, and He answered our prayer.\nAnd I separated twelve of the leaders\nof the priests--Sherebiah, Hashabiah,\nand ten of their brethren with them-25\nand weighed out to them the silver, the\ngold, and the articles, the offering for the\nhouse of our God which the king and his\ncounselors and his princes, and all\nIsrael who were present, had offered.\nI weighed into their hand six hundred\nand fifty talents of silver, silver articles\nweighing one hundred talents, one\nhundred talents of gold,\ntwenty gold basins worth a thousand\ndrachmas, and two vessels of fine\npolished bronze, precious as gold.\nAnd I said to them, \"You are holy to\nthe LORD; the articles are holy also;\nand the silver and the gold are a freewill\noffering to the LORD God of your\nfathers.\nWatch and keep them until you weigh\nthem before the leaders of the priests\nand the Levites and heads of the\nfathers' houses of Israel in Jerusalem, in\nthe chambers of the house of the\nLORD.\"\nSo the priests and the Levites received\nthe silver and the gold and the articles\nby weight, to bring them to Jerusalem to\nthe house of our God.\nThen we departed from the river of\nAhava on the twelfth day of the first\nmonth, to go to Jerusalem. And the\nhand of our God was upon us, and He\ndelivered us from the hand of the enemy\nand from ambush along the road.\nSo we came to Jerusalem, and stayed\nthere three days.\nNow on the fourth day the silver and\nthe gold and the articles were weighed\nin the house of our God by the hand of\nMeremoth the son of Uriah the priest,\nand with him was Eleazar the son of\nPhinehas; with them were the Levites,\nJozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah\nthe son of Binnui,\nwith the number and weight of\neverything. All the weight was written\ndown at that time.\nThe children of those who had been\ncarried away captive, who had come\nfrom the captivity, offered burnt offerings\nto the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all\nIsrael, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven\nlambs, and twelve male goats as a sin\noffering. All this was a burnt offering to\nthe LORD.\nAnd they delivered the king's orders to\nthe king's satraps and the governors in\nthe region beyond the River. So they\ngave support to the people and the\nhouse of God.\n9When these things were done, the\nleaders came to me, saying, \"The\npeople of Israel and the priests and the\nLevites have not separated themselves\nfrom the peoples of the lands, with\nrespect to the abominations of the\nCanaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites,\nthe Jebusites, the Ammonites, the\nMoabites, the Egyptians, and the\nAmorites.\nFor they have taken some of their\ndaughters as wives for themselves and\ntheir sons, so that the holy seed is\nmixed with the peoples of those lands.\nIndeed, the hand of the leaders and\nrulers has\ntrespass.\"\nbeen\nforemost\nin\nthis\nSo when I heard this thing, I tore my\ngarment and my robe, and plucked out\nsome of the hair of my head and beard,\nand sat down astonished.\nThen everyone who trembled at the\nwords of the God of Israel assembled to\nme, because of the transgression of\nthose who had been carried away\ncaptive, and I sat astonished until the\nevening sacrifice.\nAt the evening sacrifice I arose from my\nfasting; and having torn my garment and\nmy robe, I fell on my knees and spread\nout my hands to the LORD my God.\nAnd I said: \"O my God, I am too\nashamed and humiliated to lift up my\nface to You, my God; for our iniquities\nhave risen higher than our heads, and\nour guilt has grown up to the heavens.\nSince the days of our fathers to this day\nwe have been very guilty, and for our\niniquities we, our kings, and our priests\nhave been delivered into the hand of the\nkings of the lands, to the sword, to\ncaptivity, to plunder, and to humiliation,\nas it is this day.\nAnd now for a little while grace has\nbeen shown from the LORD our God, to\nleave us a remnant to escape, and to\ngive us a peg in His holy place, that our\nGod may enlighten our eyes and give us\na measure of revival in our bondage.\nFor we were slaves. Yet our God did\nnot forsake us in our bondage; but He\nextended mercy to us in the sight of the\nkings of Persia, to revive us, to repair\nthe house of our God, to rebuild its ruins,\nand to give us a wall in Judah and\nJerusalem.\nAnd now, O our God, what shall we\nsay after this? For we have forsaken\nYour commandments,\nwhich You commanded by Your\nservants the prophets, saying, \"The land\nwhich you are entering to possess is an\nunclean land, with the uncleanness of\nthe peoples of the lands, with their\nabominations which have filled it from\none end to another with their impurity.\nNow therefore, do not give your\ndaughters as wives for their sons, nor\ntake their daughters to your sons; and\nnever seek their peace or prosperity,\nthat you may be strong and eat the good\nof the land, and leave it as an\ninheritance to your children forever.'\nAnd after all that has come upon us for\nour evil deeds and for our great guilt,\nsince You our God have punished us\nless than our iniquities deserve, and\nhave given us such deliverance as this,\nshould we again break Your\ncommandments, and join in marriage\nwith the people committing these\nabominations? Would You not be angry\nwith us until You had consumed us, so\nthat there would be no remnant or\nsurvivor?\nO LORD God of Israel, You are\nrighteous, for we are left as a remnant,\nas it is this day. Here we are before You,\nin our guilt, though no one can stand\nbefore You because of this!\"\n10Now while Ezra was praying, and\nwhile he was confessing, weeping, and\nbowing down before the house of God,\na very large assembly of men, women,\nand children gathered to him from Israel;\nfor the people wept very bitterly.\nAnd Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one\nof the sons of Elam, spoke up and said\nto Ezra, \"We have trespassed against\nour God, and have taken pagan wives\nfrom the peoples of the land; yet now\nthere is hope in Israel in spite of this.\nNow therefore, let us make a covenant\nwith our God to put away all these wives\nand those who have been born to them,\naccording to the advice of my master\nand of those who tremble at the\ncommandment of our God; and let it be\ndone according to the law.\nArise, for this matter is your\nresponsibility. We also are with you. Be\nof good courage, and do it.\"\nThen Ezra arose, and made the leaders\nof the priests, the Levites, and all Israel\nswear an oath that they would do\naccording to this word. So they swore\nan oath.\nThen Ezra rose up from before the\nhouse of God, and went into the\nchamber of Jehohanan the son of\nEliashib; and when he came there, he\nate no bread and drank no water, for he\nmourned because of the guilt of those\nfrom the captivity.\nAnd they issued a proclamation\nthroughout Judah and Jerusalem to all\nthe descendants of the captivity, that\nthey must gather at Jerusalem,\nand that whoever would not come\nwithin three days, according to the\ninstructions of the leaders and elders, all\nhis property would be confiscated, and\nhe himself would be separated from the\nassembly of those from the captivity.\nPlease, let the leaders of our entire\nassembly stand; and let all those in our\ncities who have taken pagan wives\ncome at appointed times, together with\nthe elders and judges of their cities, until\nthe fierce wrath of our God is turned\naway from us in this matter.\"\nOnly Jonathan the son of Asahel and\nJahaziah the son of Tikvah opposed this,\nand Meshullam and Shabbethai the\nLevite gave them support.\nSo all the men of Judah and Benjamin\ngathered at Jerusalem within three days.\nIt was the ninth month, on the twentieth\nof the month; and all the people sat in\nthe open square of the house of God,\ntrembling because of this matter and\nbecause of heavy rain.\nThen the descendants of the captivity\ndid so. And Ezra the priest, with certain\nheads of the fathers' households, were\nset apart by the fathers' households,\neach of them by name; and they sat\ndown on the first day of the tenth month\nto examine the matter.\nThen Ezra the priest stood up and said\nto them, \"You have transgressed and\nhave taken pagan wives, adding to the\nguilt of Israel.\nBy the first day of the first month they\nfinished questioning all the men who\nhad taken pagan wives.\nNow therefore, make confession to the\nLORD God of your fathers, and do His\nwill; separate yourselves from the\npeoples of the land, and from the pagan\nwives.\"\nAnd among the sons of the priests\nwho had taken pagan wives the\nfollowing were found of the sons of\nJeshua the son of Jozadak, and his\nbrothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and\nGedaliah.\nThen all the assembly answered and\nsaid with a loud voice, \"Yes! As you\nhave said, so we must do.\nBut there are many people; it is the\nseason for heavy rain, and we are not\nable to stand outside. Nor is this the\nwork of one or two days, for there are\nmany of us who have transgressed in\nthis matter.\nAnd they gave their promise that they\nwould put away their wives; and being\nguilty, they presented a ram of the flock\nas their trespass offering.\nAlso of the sons of Immer: Hanani and\nZebadiah;\nof the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah,\nShemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah;\nof the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai,\nMaaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad,\nand Elasah.\nAlso of the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei,\nKelaiah (the same is Kelita), Pethahiah,\nJudah, and Eliezer.\nAlso of the singers: Eliashib; and of\nthe gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and\nUri.\nBenjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah;\nof the sons of Hashum: Mattenai,\nMattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai,\nManasseh, and Shimei;\nof the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram,\nUel,\nBenaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluh,\nAnd others of Israel: of the sons of\nParosh: Ramiah, Jeziah, Malchiah,\nMijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and\nBenaiah;\nVaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,\nMattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasai,\nBani, Binnui, Shimei,\nof the sons of Elam: Mattaniah,\nZechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and\nEliah;\nShelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,\nMachnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,\nof the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib,\nMattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza;\nof the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan,\nHananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai;\nof the sons of Bani: Meshullam,\nMalluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and\nRamoth;\nof the sons of Pahath-Moab: Adna,\nChelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah,\nBezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh;\nof the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Ishijah,\nMalchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,\nAzarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,\nShallum, Amariah, and Joseph;\nof the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah,\nZabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and\nBenaiah.\nAll these had taken pagan wives, and\nsome of them had wives by whom they\nhad children.\nNehemiah\n1The words of Nehemiah the son of\nHachaliah. It came to pass in the month\nof Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I\nwas in Shushan the citadel,\nthat Hanani one of my brethren came\nwith men from Judah; and I asked them\nconcerning the Jews who had escaped,\nwho had survived the captivity, and\nconcerning Jerusalem.\nAnd they said to me, \"The survivors\nwho are left from the captivity in the\nprovince are there in great distress and\nreproach. The wall of Jerusalem is also\nbroken down, and its gates are burned\nwith fire.\"\nSo it was, when I heard these words,\nthat I sat down and wept, and mourned\nfor many days; I was fasting and praying\nbefore the God of heaven.\nAnd I said: \"I pray, LORD God of\nheaven, O great and awesome God,\nYou who keep Your covenant and\nmercy with those who love You and\nobserve Your commandments,\nplease let Your ear be attentive and\nYour eyes open, that You may hear the\nprayer of Your servant which I pray\nbefore You now, day and night, for the\nchildren of Israel Your servants, and\nconfess the sins of the children of Israel\nwhich we have sinned against You. Both\nmy father's house and I have sinned.\nWe have acted very corruptly against\nYou, and have not kept the\ncommandments, the statutes, nor the\nordinances which You commanded Your\nservant Moses.\nRemember, I pray, the word that You\ncommanded Your servant Moses,\nsaying, \"If you are unfaithful, I will\nscatter you among the nations;\nbut if you return to Me, and keep My\ncommandments and do them, though\nsome of you were cast out to the\nfarthest part of the heavens, yet I will\ngather them from there, and bring them\nto the place which I have chosen as a\ndwelling for My name.'\nNow these are Your servants and Your\npeople, whom You have redeemed by\nYour great power, and by Your strong\nhand.\nO Lord, I pray, please let Your ear be\nattentive to the prayer of Your servant,\nand to the prayer of Your servants who\ndesire to fear Your name; and let Your\nservant prosper this day, I pray, and\ngrant him mercy in the sight of this\nman.\" For I was the king's cupbearer.\n2And it came to pass in the month of\nNisan, in the twentieth year of King\nArtaxerxes, when wine was before him,\nthat I took the wine and gave it to the\nking. Now I had never been sad in his\npresence before.\nTherefore the king said to me, \"Why is\nyour face sad, since you are not sick?\nThis is nothing but sorrow of heart.\" So I\nbecame dreadfully afraid,\nThen I went to the governors in the\nregion beyond the River, and gave them\nthe king's letters. Now the king had sent\ncaptains of the army and horsemen with\nme.\nand said to the king, \"May the king live\nforever! Why should my face not be sad,\nwhen the city, the place of my fathers'\ntombs, lies waste, and its gates are\nburned with fire?\"\nWhen Sanballat the Horonite and\nTobiah the Ammonite official heard of it,\nthey were deeply disturbed that a man\nhad come to seek the well-being of the\nchildren of Israel.\nThen the king said to me, \"What do you\nrequest?\" So I prayed to the God of\nheaven.\nSo I came to Jerusalem and was there\nthree days.\nAnd I said to the king, \"If it pleases the\nking, and if your servant has found favor\nin your sight, I ask that you send me to\nJudah, to the city of my fathers' tombs,\nthat I may rebuild it.\"\nThen I arose in the night, I and a few\nmen with me; I told no one what my God\nhad put in my heart to do at Jerusalem;\nnor was there any animal with me,\nexcept the one on which I rode.\nThen the king said to me (the queen\nalso sitting beside him), \"How long will\nyour journey be? And when will you\nreturn?\" So it pleased the king to send\nme; and I set him a time.\nAnd I went out by night through the\nValley Gate to the Serpent Well and the\nRefuse Gate, and viewed the walls of\nJerusalem which were broken down and\nits gates which were burned with fire.\nFurthermore I said to the king, \"If it\npleases the king, let letters be given to\nme for the governors of the region\nbeyond the River, that they must permit\nme to pass through till I come to Judah,\nand a letter to Asaph the keeper of the\nking's forest, that he must give me\ntimber to make beams for the gates of\nthe citadel which pertains to the temple,\nfor the city wall, and for the house that I\nwill occupy.\" And the king granted them\nto me according to the good hand of my\nGod upon me.\nThen I went on to the Fountain Gate\nand to the King's Pool, but there was no\nroom for the animal under me to pass.\nSo I went up in the night by the valley,\nand viewed the wall; then I turned back\nand entered by the Valley Gate, and so\nreturned.\nAnd the officials did not know where I\nhad gone or what I had done; I had not\nyet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles,\nthe officials, or the others who did the\nwork.\nThen I said to them, \"You see the\ndistress that we are in, how Jerusalem\nlies waste, and its gates are burned with\nfire. Come and let us build the wall of\nJerusalem, that we may no longer be a\nreproach.\"\nAnd next to them Meremoth the son of\nUrijah, the son of Koz, made repairs.\nNext to them Meshullam the son of\nBerechiah, the son of Meshezabel,\nmade repairs. Next to them Zadok the\nson of Baana made repairs.\nAnd I told them of the hand of my God\nwhich had been good upon me, and\nalso of the king's words that he had\nspoken to me. So they said, \"Let us rise\nup and build.\" Then they set their hands\nto this good work.\nBut when Sanballat the Horonite,\nTobiah the Ammonite official, and\nGeshem the Arab heard of it, they\nlaughed at us and despised us, and said,\n\"What is this thing that you are doing?\nWill you rebel against the king?\"\nSo I answered them, and said to them,\n\"The God of heaven Himself will prosper\nus; therefore we His servants will arise\nand build, but you have no heritage or\nright or memorial in Jerusalem.\"\n3Then Eliashib the high priest rose up\nwith his brethren the priests and built the\nSheep Gate; they consecrated it and\nhung its doors. They built as far as the\nTower of the Hundred, and consecrated\nit, then as far as the Tower of Hananel.\nNext to them the Tekoites made\nrepairs; but their nobles did not put their\nshoulders to the work of their Lord.\nMoreover Jehoiada the son of Paseah\nand Meshullam the son of Besodeiah\nrepaired the Old Gate; they laid its\nbeams and hung its doors, with its bolts\nand bars.\nAnd next to them Melatiah the\nGibeonite, Jadon the Meronothite, the\nmen of Gibeon and Mizpah, repaired the\nresidence of the governor of the region\nbeyond the River.\nNext to him Uzziel the son of Harhaiah,\none of the goldsmiths, made repairs.\nAlso next to him Hananiah, one of the\nperfumers, made repairs; and they\nfortified Jerusalem as far as the Broad\nWall.\nAnd next to them Rephaiah the son of\nHur, leader of half the district of\nJerusalem, made repairs.\nNext to Eliashib the men of Jericho built.\nAnd next to them Zaccur the son of Imri\nbuilt.\nNext to them Jedaiah the son of\nHarumaph made repairs in front of his\nhouse.

Next to\nhim Hashabiah, leader of half the district\nof Keilah, made repairs for his district.\nAfter him Binnui the son of Henadad\nrepaired another section, from the\nhouse of Azariah to the buttress, even\nas far as the corner.\nPalal the son of Uzai made repairs\nopposite the buttress, and on the tower\nwhich projects from the king's upper\nhouse that was by the court of the\nprison. After him Pedaiah the son of\nParosh made repairs.\nAfter him their brethren, under Bavai\nthe son of Henadad, leader of the other\nhalf of the district of Keilah, made\nrepairs.\nMoreover the Nethinim who dwelt in\nOphel made repairs as far as the place\nin front of the Water Gate toward the\neast, and on the projecting tower.\nAfter them the Tekoites repaired\nanother section, next to the great\nprojecting tower, and as far as the wall\nof Ophel.\nthe heaps of rubbish--stones that are\nburned?\"\nBeyond the Horse Gate the priests\nmade repairs, each in front of his own\nhouse.\nNow Tobiah the Ammonite was beside\nhim, and he said, \"Whatever they build,\nif even a fox goes up on it, he will break\ndown their stone wall.\"\nAfter them Zadok the son of Immer\nmade repairs in front of his own house.\nAfter him Shemaiah the son of\nShechaniah, the keeper of the East\nGate, made repairs.\nHear, O our God, for we are despised;\nturn their reproach on their own heads,\nand give them as plunder to a land of\ncaptivity!\nAfter him Hananiah the son of\nShelemiah, and Hanun, the sixth son of\nZalaph, repaired another section. After\nhim Meshullam the son of Berechiah\nmade repairs in front of his dwelling.\nDo not cover their iniquity, and do not\nlet their sin be blotted out from before\nYou; for they have provoked You to\nanger before the builders.\nAfter him Malchijah, one of the\ngoldsmiths, made repairs as far as the\nhouse of the Nethinim and of the\nmerchants, in front of the Miphkad Gate,\nand as far as the upper room at the\ncorner.\nAnd between the upper room at the\ncorner, as far as the Sheep Gate, the\ngoldsmiths and the merchants made\nrepairs.\n4But it so happened, when Sanballat\nSo we built the wall, and the entire wall\nwas joined together up to half its height,\nfor the people had a mind to work.\nNow it happened, when Sanballat,\nTobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and\nthe Ashdodites heard that the walls of\nJerusalem were being restored and the\ngaps were beginning to be closed, that\nthey became very angry,\nand all of them conspired together to\ncome and attack Jerusalem and create\nconfusion.\nheard that we were rebuilding the wall,\nthat he was furious and very indignant,\nand mocked the Jews.\nNevertheless we made our prayer to\nour God, and because of them we set a\nwatch against them day and night.\nAnd he spoke before his brethren and\nthe army of Samaria, and said, \"What\nare these feeble Jews doing? Will they\nfortify themselves? Will they offer\nsacrifices? Will they complete it in a\nday? Will they revive the stones from\nThen Judah said, \"The strength of the\nlaborers is failing, and there is so much\nrubbish that we are not able to build the\nwall.\"\nAnd our adversaries said, \"They will\nneither know nor see anything, till we\ncome into their midst and kill them and\ncause the work to cease.\"\nEvery one of the builders had his\nsword girded at his side as he built. And\nthe one who sounded the trumpet was\nbeside me.\nSo it was, when the Jews who dwelt\nnear them came, that they told us ten\ntimes, \"From whatever place you turn,\nthey will be upon us.\"\nThen I said to the nobles, the rulers,\nand the rest of the people, \"The work is\ngreat and extensive, and we are\nseparated far from one another on the\nwall.\nTherefore I positioned men behind the\nlower parts of the wall, at the openings;\nand I set the people according to their\nfamilies, with their swords, their spears,\nand their bows.\nWherever you hear the sound of the\ntrumpet, rally to us there. Our God will\nfight for us.\"\nAnd I looked, and arose and said to\nthe nobles, to the leaders, and to the\nrest of the people, \"Do not be afraid of\nthem. Remember the Lord, great and\nawesome, and fight for your brethren,\nyour sons, your daughters, your wives,\nand your houses.\"\nAnd it happened, when our enemies\nheard that it was known to us, and that\nGod had brought their plot to nothing,\nthat all of us returned to the wall,\neveryone to his work.\nSo it was, from that time on, that half\nof my servants worked at construction,\nwhile the other half held the spears, the\nshields, the bows, and wore armor; and\nthe leaders were behind all the house of\nJudah.\nThose who built on the wall, and those\nwho carried burdens, loaded themselves\nso that with one hand they worked at\nconstruction, and with the other held a\nweapon.\nSo we labored in the work, and half of\nthe men held the spears from daybreak\nuntil the stars appeared.\nAt the same time I also said to the\npeople, \"Let each man and his servant\nstay at night in Jerusalem, that they may\nbe our guard by night and a working\nparty by day.\"\nSo neither I, my brethren, my servants,\nnor the men of the guard who followed\nme took off our clothes, except that\neveryone took them off for washing.\n5And there was a great outcry of the\npeople and their wives against their\nJewish brethren.\nFor there were those who said, \"We,\nour sons, and our daughters are many;\ntherefore let us get grain, that we may\neat and live.\"\nThere were also some who said, \"We\nhave mortgaged our lands and\nvineyards and houses, that we might\nbuy grain because of the famine.\"\nThere were also those who said, \"We\nhave borrowed money for the king's tax\non our lands and vineyards.\nRestore now to them, even this day,\ntheir lands, their vineyards, their olive\ngroves, and their houses, also a\nhundredth of the money and the grain,\nthe new wine and the oil, that you have\ncharged them.\"\nYet now our flesh is as the flesh of our\nbrethren, our children as their children;\nand indeed we are forcing our sons and\nour daughters to be slaves, and some of\nour daughters have been brought into\nslavery. It is not in our power to redeem\nthem, for other men have our lands and\nvineyards.\"\nAnd I became very angry when I heard\ntheir outcry and these words.\nAfter serious thought, I rebuked the\nnobles and rulers, and said to them,\n\"Each of you is exacting usury from his\nbrother.\" So I called a great assembly\nagainst them.\nAnd I said to them, \"According to our\nability we have redeemed our Jewish\nbrethren who were sold to the nations.\nNow indeed, will you even sell your\nbrethren? Or should they be sold to us?\"\nThen they were silenced and found\nnothing to say.\nThen I said, \"What you are doing is not\ngood. Should you not walk in the fear of\nour God because of the reproach of the\nnations, our enemies?\nI also, with my brethren and my\nservants, am lending them money and\ngrain. Please, let us stop this usury!\nSo they said, \"We will restore it, and\nwill require nothing from them; we will\ndo as you say.\" Then I called the priests,\nand required an oath from them that\nthey would do according to this promise.\nThen I shook out the fold of my\ngarment and said, \"So may God shake\nout each man from his house, and from\nhis property, who does not perform this\npromise. Even thus may he be shaken\nout and emptied.\" And all the assembly\nsaid, \"Amen!\" and praised the LORD.\nThen the people did according to this\npromise.\nMoreover, from the time that I was\nappointed to be their governor in the\nland of Judah, from the twentieth year\nuntil the thirty-second year of King\nArtaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor\nmy brothers ate the governor's\nprovisions.\nBut the former governors who were\nbefore me laid burdens on the people,\nand took from them bread and wine,\nbesides forty shekels of silver. Yes,\neven their servants bore rule over the\npeople, but I did not do so, because of\nthe fear of God.\nIndeed, I also continued the work on\nthis wall, and we did not buy any land.\nAll my servants were gathered there for\nthe work.\nAnd at my table were one hundred and\nfifty Jews and rulers, besides those who\ncame to us from the nations around us.\nNow that which was prepared daily\nwas one ox and six choice sheep. Also\nfowl were prepared for me, and once\nevery ten days an abundance of all\nkinds of wine. Yet in spite of this I did\nnot demand the governor's provisions,\nbecause the bondage was heavy on this\npeople.\nIn it was written: It is reported among\nthe nations, and Geshem says, that you\nand the Jews plan to rebel; therefore,\naccording to these rumors, you are\nrebuilding the wall, that you may be their\nking.\nAnd you have also appointed prophets\nto proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem,\nsaying, \"There is a king in Judah!\" Now\nthese matters will be reported to the\nking. So come, therefore, and let us\nconsult together.\nRemember me, my God, for good,\naccording to all that I have done for this\npeople.\n6Now it happened when Sanballat,\nTobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest\nof our enemies heard that I had rebuilt\nthe wall, and that there were no breaks\nleft in it (though at that time I had not\nhung the doors in the gates),\nthat Sanballat and Geshem sent to me,\nsaying, \"Come, let us meet together\namong the villages in the plain of Ono.\"\nBut they thought to do me harm.\nSo I sent messengers to them, saying,\n\"I am doing a great work, so that I\ncannot come down. Why should the\nwork cease while I leave it and go down\nto you?\"\nBut they sent me this message four\ntimes, and I answered them in the same\nmanner.\nThen Sanballat sent his servant to me\nas before, the fifth time, with an open\nletter in his hand.\nThen I sent to him, saying, \"No such\nthings as you say are being done, but\nyou invent them in your own heart.\"\nFor they all were trying to make us\nafraid, saying, \"Their hands will be\nweakened in the work, and it will not be\ndone.\" Now therefore, O God,\nstrengthen my hands.\nAfterward I came to the house of\nShemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of\nMehetabel, who was a secret informer;\nand he said, \"Let us meet together in the\nhouse of God, within the temple, and let\nus close the doors of the temple, for\nthey are coming to kill you; indeed, at\nnight they will come to kill you.\"\nAnd I said, \"Should such a man as I\nflee? And who is there such as I who\nwould go into the temple to save his\nlife? I will not go in!\"\nThen I perceived that God had not\nsent him at all, but that he pronounced\nthis prophecy against me because\nTobiah and Sanballat had hired him.\nFor this reason he was hired, that I\nshould be afraid and act that way and\nsin, so that they might have cause for an\nevil report, that they might reproach me.\nthat I gave the charge of Jerusalem to\nmy brother Hanani, and Hananiah the\nleader of the citadel, for he was a faithful\nman and feared God more than many.\nMy God, remember Tobiah and\nSanballat, according to these their\nworks, and the prophetess Noadiah and\nthe rest of the prophets who would have\nmade me afraid.\nSo the wall was finished on the twentyfifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days.\nAnd I said to them, \"Do not let the\ngates of Jerusalem be opened until the\nsun is hot; and while they stand guard,\nlet them shut and bar the doors; and\nappoint guards from among the\ninhabitants of Jerusalem, one at his\nwatch station and another in front of his\nown house.\"\nAnd it happened, when all our\nenemies heard of it, and all the nations\naround us saw these things, that they\nwere very disheartened in their own\neyes; for they perceived that this work\nwas done by our God.\nNow the city was large and spacious,\nbut the people in it were few, and the\nhouses were not rebuilt.\nAlso in those days the nobles of Judah\nsent many letters to Tobiah, and the\nletters of Tobiah came to them.\nThen my God put it into my heart to\ngather the nobles, the rulers, and the\npeople, that they might be registered by\ngenealogy. And I found a register of the\ngenealogy of those who had come up in\nthe first return, and found written in it:\nFor many in Judah were pledged to\nhim, because he was the son-in-law of\nShechaniah the son of Arah, and his\nson Jehohanan had married the\ndaughter of Meshullam the son of\nBerechiah.\nThese are the people of the province\nwho came back from the captivity, of\nthose who had been carried away,\nwhom Nebuchadnezzar the king of\nBabylon had carried away, and who\nreturned to Jerusalem and Judah,\neveryone to his city.\nAlso they reported his good deeds\nbefore me, and reported my words to\nhim. Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.\n7Then it was, when the wall was built\nand I had hung the doors, when the\ngatekeepers, the singers, and the\nLevites had been appointed,\nThose who came with Zerubbabel were\nJeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah,\nNahamani,\nMordecai,\nBilshan,\nMispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.\nThe number of the men of the people of\nIsrael:\nthe sons of Parosh, two thousand one\nhundred and seventy-two;\nthe sons of Shephatiah, three hundred\nand seventy-two;\nthe sons of Bezai, three hundred and\ntwenty-four;\nthe sons of Arah, six hundred and fiftytwo;\nthe sons of Hariph, one hundred and\ntwelve;\nthe sons of Pahath-Moab, of the sons\nof Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight\nhundred and eighteen;\nthe sons of Elam, one thousand two\nhundred and fifty-four;\nthe sons of Gibeon, ninety-five;\nthe men of Bethlehem and Netophah,\none hundred and eighty-eight;\nthe men of Anathoth, one hundred and\ntwenty-eight;\nthe sons of Zattu, eight hundred and\nforty-five;\nthe sons of Zaccai, seven hundred and\nsixty;\nthe sons of Binnui, six hundred and\nforty-eight;\nthe sons of Bebai, six hundred and\ntwenty-eight;\nthe sons of Azgad, two thousand three\nhundred and twenty-two;\nthe men of Beth Azmaveth, forty-two;\nthe men of Kirjath Jearim, Chephirah,\nand Beeroth, seven hundred and fortythree;\nthe men of Ramah and Geba, six\nhundred and twenty-one;\nthe men of Michmas, one hundred and\ntwenty-two;\nthe men of Bethel and Ai, one hundred\nand twenty-three;\nthe sons of Adonikam, six hundred\nand sixty-seven;\nthe men of the other Nebo, fifty-two;\nthe sons of Bigvai, two thousand and\nsixty-seven;\nthe sons of the other Elam, one\nthousand two hundred and fifty-four;\nthe sons of Adin, six hundred and fiftyfive;\nthe sons of Harim, three hundred and\ntwenty;\nthe sons of Ater of Hezekiah, ninetyeight;\nthe sons of Jericho, three hundred and\nforty-five;\nthe sons of Hashum, three hundred\nand twenty-eight;\nthe sons of Lod, Hadid, and Ono,\nseven hundred and twenty-one;\nthe sons of Senaah, three thousand\nnine hundred and thirty.\nthe sons of Reaiah, the sons of Rezin,\nthe sons of Nekoda,\nThe priests: the sons of Jedaiah, of the\nhouse of Jeshua, nine hundred and\nseventy-three;\nthe sons of Gazzam, the sons of Uzza,\nthe sons of Paseah,\nthe sons of Immer, one thousand and\nfifty-two;\nthe sons of Besai, the sons of Meunim,\nthe sons of Nephishesim,\nthe sons of Pashhur, one thousand\ntwo hundred and forty-seven;\nthe sons of Bakbuk, the sons of\nHakupha, the sons of Harhur,\nthe sons of Harim, one thousand and\nseventeen.\nthe sons of Bazlith, the sons of Mehida,\nthe sons of Harsha,\nThe Levites: the sons of Jeshua, of\nKadmiel, and of the sons of Hodevah,\nseventy-four.\nThe singers: the sons of Asaph, one\nhundred and forty-eight.\nThe gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum,\nthe sons of Ater, the sons of Talmon,\nthe sons of Akkub, the sons of Hatita,\nthe sons of Shobai, one hundred and\nthirty-eight.\nthe sons of Barkos, the sons of Sisera,\nthe sons of Tamah,\nthe sons of Neziah, and the sons of\nHatipha.\nThe sons of Solomon's servants: the\nsons of Sotai, the sons of Sophereth,\nthe sons of Perida,\nthe sons of Jaala, the sons of Darkon,\nthe sons of Giddel,\nThe Nethinim: the sons of Ziha, the\nsons of Hasupha, the sons of Tabbaoth,\nthe sons of Shephatiah, the sons of\nHattil, the sons of Pochereth of Zebaim,\nand the sons of Amon.\nthe sons of Keros, the sons of Sia, the\nsons of Padon,\nthe sons of Lebana, the sons of\nHagaba, the sons of Salmai,\nthe sons of Hanan, the sons of Giddel,\nthe sons of Gahar,\nAll the Nethinim, and the sons of\nSolomon's servants, were three hundred\nand ninety-two.\nAnd these were the ones who came\nup from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub,\nAddon, and Immer, but they could not\nidentify their father's house nor their\nlineage, whether they were of Israel:\nthe sons of Delaiah, the sons of\nTobiah, the sons of Nekoda, six hundred\nand forty-two;\nSome of the heads of the fathers'\nhouses gave to the treasury of the work\ntwenty thousand gold drachmas, and\ntwo thousand two hundred silver minas.\nand of the priests: the sons of Habaiah,\nthe sons of Koz, the sons of Barzillai,\nwho took a wife of the daughters of\nBarzillai the Gileadite, and was called by\ntheir name.\nAnd that which the rest of the people\ngave was twenty thousand gold\ndrachmas, two thousand silver minas,\nand sixty-seven priestly garments.\nThese sought their listing among those\nwho were registered by genealogy, but it\nwas not found; therefore they were\nexcluded from the priesthood as defiled.\nAnd the governor said to them that\nthey should not eat of the most holy\nthings till a priest could consult with the\nUrim and Thummim.\nAltogether the whole assembly was\nforty-two thousand three hundred and\nsixty,\nbesides their male and female\nservants, of whom there were seven\nthousand three hundred and thirtyseven; and they had two hundred and\nforty-five men and women singers.\nTheir horses were seven hundred and\nthirty-six, their mules two hundred and\nforty-five,\ntheir camels four hundred and thirtyfive, and donkeys six thousand seven\nhundred and twenty.\nSo the priests, the Levites, the\ngatekeepers, the singers, some of the\npeople, the Nethinim, and all Israel\ndwelt in their cities. When the seventh\nmonth came, the children of Israel were\nin their cities.\n8Now all the people gathered together\nas one man in the open square that was\nin front of the Water Gate; and they told\nEzra the scribe to bring the Book of the\nLaw of Moses, which the LORD had\ncommanded Israel.\nSo Ezra the priest brought the Law\nbefore the assembly of men and women\nand all who could hear with\nunderstanding on the first day of the\nseventh month.\nThen he read from it in the open square\nthat was in front of the Water Gate from\nmorning until midday, before the men\nand women and those who could\nunderstand; and the ears of all the\npeople were attentive to the Book of the\nLaw.\nAnd some of the heads of the fathers'\nhouses gave to the work. The governor\ngave to the treasury one thousand gold\ndrachmas, fifty basins, and five hundred\nand thirty priestly garments.\nSo Ezra the scribe stood on a platform\nof wood which they had made for the\npurpose; and beside him, at his right\nhand, stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah,\nUrijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and at his\nleft hand Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah,\nHashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, and\nMeshullam.\nSo the Levites quieted all the people,\nsaying, \"Be still, for the day is holy; do\nnot be grieved.\"\nAnd Ezra opened the book in the sight\nof all the people, for he was standing\nabove all the people; and when he\nopened it, all the people stood up.\nAnd all the people went their way to\neat and drink, to send portions and\nrejoice\ngreatly,\nbecause\nthey\nunderstood the words that were\ndeclared to them.\nAnd Ezra blessed the LORD, the great\nGod. Then all the people answered,\n\"Amen, Amen!\" while lifting up their\nhands. And they bowed their heads and\nworshiped the LORD with their faces to\nthe ground.\nNow on the second day the heads of\nthe fathers' houses of all the people,\nwith the priests and Levites, were\ngathered to Ezra the scribe, in order to\nunderstand the words of the Law.\nAlso Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin,\nAkkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah,\nKelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan,\nPelaiah, and the Levites, helped the\npeople to understand the Law; and the\npeople stood in their place.\nSo they read distinctly from the book, in\nthe Law of God; and they gave the\nsense, and helped them to understand\nthe reading.\nAnd they found written in the Law,\nwhich the LORD had commanded by\nMoses, that the children of Israel should\ndwell in booths during the feast of the\nseventh month,\nand that they should announce and\nproclaim in all their cities and in\nJerusalem, saying, \"Go out to the\nmountain, and bring olive branches,\nbranches of oil trees, myrtle branches,\npalm branches, and branches of leafy\ntrees, to make booths, as it is written.\"\nAnd Nehemiah, who was the governor,\nEzra the priest and scribe, and the\nLevites who taught the people said to all\nthe people, \"This day is holy to the\nLORD your God; do not mourn nor\nweep.\" For all the people wept, when\nthey heard the words of the Law.\nThen the people went out and brought\nthem and made themselves booths,\neach one on the roof of his house, or in\ntheir courtyards or the courts of the\nhouse of God, and in the open square of\nthe Water Gate and in the open square\nof the Gate of Ephraim.\nThen he said to them, \"Go your way,\neat the fat, drink the sweet, and send\nportions to those for whom nothing is\nprepared; for this day is holy to our Lord.\nDo not sorrow, for the joy of the LORD\nis your strength.\"\nSo the whole assembly of those who\nhad returned from the captivity made\nbooths and sat under the booths; for\nsince the days of Joshua the son of Nun\nuntil that day the children of Israel had\nnot done so. And there was very great\ngladness.\nAlso day by day, from the first day until\nthe last day, he read from the Book of\nthe Law of God. And they kept the feast\nseven days; and on the eighth day there\nwas a sacred assembly, according to\nthe prescribed manner.\n9Now on the twenty-fourth day of this\nmonth the children of Israel were\nassembled with fasting, in sackcloth,\nand with dust on their heads.\nThen those of Israelite lineage\nseparated\nthemselves\nfrom\nall\nforeigners; and they stood and\nconfessed their sins and the iniquities of\ntheir fathers.\nAnd they stood up in their place and\nread from the Book of the Law of the\nLORD their God for one-fourth of the\nday; and for another fourth they\nconfessed and worshiped the LORD\ntheir God.\nThen\nJeshua,\nBani,\nKadmiel,\nShebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and\nChenani stood on the stairs of the\nLevites and cried out with a loud voice\nto the LORD their God.\nAnd the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani,\nHashabniah,\nSherebiah,\nHodijah,\nShebaniah, and Pethahiah, said: \"Stand\nup and bless the LORD your God\nForever and ever! \"Blessed be Your\nglorious name, Which is exalted above\nall blessing and praise!\nYou alone are the LORD; You have\nmade heaven, The heaven of heavens,\nwith all their host, The earth and\neverything on it, The seas and all that is\nin them, And You preserve them all. The\nhost of heaven worships You.\n\"You are the LORD God, Who chose\nAbram, And brought him out of Ur of the\nChaldeans, And gave him the name\nAbraham;\nYou found his heart faithful before You,\nAnd made a covenant with him To give\nthe land of the Canaanites, The Hittites,\nthe Amorites, The Perizzites, the\nJebusites, And the Girgashites-- To give\nit to his descendants. You have\nperformed Your words, For You are\nrighteous.\n\"You saw the affliction of our fathers in\nEgypt, And heard their cry by the Red\nSea.\nYou showed signs and wonders\nagainst Pharaoh, Against all his\nservants, And against all the people of\nhis land. For You knew that they acted\nproudly against them. So You made a\nname for Yourself, as it is this day.\nAnd You divided the sea before them,\nSo that they went through the midst of\nthe sea on the dry land; And their\npersecutors You threw into the deep, As\na stone into the mighty waters.\nMoreover You led them by day with a\ncloudy pillar, And by night with a pillar of\nfire, To give them light on the road\nWhich they should travel.\n\"You came down also on Mount Sinai,\nAnd spoke with them from heaven, And\ngave them just ordinances and true laws,\nGood statutes and commandments.\nYou also gave Your good Spirit to\ninstruct them, And did not withhold Your\nmanna from their mouth, And gave them\nwater for their thirst.\nYou made known to them Your holy\nSabbath, And commanded them\nprecepts, statutes and laws, By the\nhand of Moses Your servant.\nForty years You sustained them in the\nwilderness; They lacked nothing; Their\nclothes did not wear out And their feet\ndid not swell.\nYou gave them bread from heaven for\ntheir hunger, And brought them water\nout of the rock for their thirst, And told\nthem to go in to possess the land Which\nYou had sworn to give them.\n\"Moreover You gave them kingdoms\nand nations, And divided them into\ndistricts. So they took possession of the\nland of Sihon, The land of the king of\nHeshbon, And the land of Og king of\nBashan.\n\"But they and our fathers acted\nproudly, Hardened their necks, And did\nnot heed Your commandments.\nThey refused to obey, And they were\nnot mindful of Your wonders That You\ndid among them. But they hardened\ntheir necks, And in their rebellion They\nappointed a leader To return to their\nbondage. But You are God, Ready to\npardon, Gracious and merciful, Slow to\nanger, Abundant in kindness, And did\nnot forsake them.\n\"Even when they made a molded calf\nfor themselves, And said, \"This is your\ngod That brought you up out of Egypt,'\nAnd worked great provocations,\nYet in Your manifold mercies You did\nnot forsake them in the wilderness. The\npillar of the cloud did not depart from\nthem by day, To lead them on the road;\nNor the pillar of fire by night, To show\nthem light, And the way they should go.\nYou also multiplied their children as\nthe stars of heaven, And brought them\ninto the land Which You had told their\nfathers To go in and possess.\nSo the people went in And possessed\nthe land; You subdued before them the\ninhabitants of the land, The Canaanites,\nAnd gave them into their hands, With\ntheir kings And the people of the land,\nThat they might do with them as they\nwished.\nAnd they took strong cities and a rich\nland, And possessed houses full of all\ngoods, Cisterns already dug, vineyards,\nolive groves, And fruit trees in\nabundance. So they ate and were filled\nand grew fat, And delighted themselves\nin Your great goodness.\n\"Nevertheless they were disobedient\nAnd rebelled against You, Cast Your law\nbehind their backs And killed Your\nprophets, who testified against them To\nturn them to Yourself; And they worked\ngreat provocations.\nTherefore You delivered them into the\nhand of their enemies, Who oppressed\nthem; And in the time of their trouble,\nWhen they cried to You, You heard from\nheaven; And according to Your\nabundant mercies You gave them\ndeliverers who saved them From the\nhand of their enemies.\nour princes, Our priests and our\nprophets, Our fathers and on all Your\npeople, From the days of the kings of\nAssyria until this day.\n\"But after they had rest, They again\ndid evil before You. Therefore You left\nthem in the hand of their enemies, So\nthat they had dominion over them; Yet\nwhen they returned and cried out to You,\nYou heard from heaven; And many\ntimes You delivered them according to\nYour mercies,\nAnd testified against them, That You\nmight bring them back to Your law. Yet\nthey acted proudly, And did not heed\nYour commandments, But sinned\nagainst Your judgments, \"Which if a\nman does, he shall live by them.' And\nthey shrugged their shoulders, Stiffened\ntheir necks, And would not hear.\nYet for many years You had patience\nwith them, And testified against them by\nYour Spirit in Your prophets.

(But in the\ncities of Judah everyone dwelt in his\nown possession in their cities--Israelites,\npriests,\nLevites,\nNethinim,\nand\ndescendants of Solomon's servants.)\nAlso in Jerusalem dwelt some of the\nchildren of Judah and of the children of\nBenjamin.

They dwelt from Beersheba to\nthe Valley of Hinnom.\nAlso the children of Benjamin from\nGeba dwelt in Michmash, Aija, and\nBethel, and their villages;\nin Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah;\nin Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim;\nin Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat;\nin Lod, Ono, and the Valley of\nCraftsmen.\nSome of the Judean divisions of\nLevites were in Benjamin.\n12Now these are the priests and the\nLevites who came up with Zerubbabel\nthe son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua:\nSeraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,\nAmariah, Malluch, Hattush,\nShechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,\nIddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,\nMijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,\nShemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,\nSallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah.\nThese were the heads of the priests and\ntheir brethren in the days of Jeshua.\nMoreover the Levites were Jeshua,\nBinnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and\nMattaniah who led the thanksgiving\npsalms, he and his brethren.\nAlso Bakbukiah and Unni, their\nbrethren, stood across from them in\ntheir duties.\nJeshua begot Joiakim, Joiakim begot\nEliashib, Eliashib begot Joiada,\nJoiada begot Jonathan, and Jonathan\nbegot Jaddua.\nNow in the days of Joiakim, the priests,\nthe heads of the fathers' houses were:\nof Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah,\nHananiah;\nof Ezra, Meshullam;\nJehohanan;\nof\nAmariah,\nof Melichu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah,\nJoseph;\ngatekeepers keeping the watch at the\nstorerooms of the gates.\nof Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;\nof Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon,\nMeshullam;\nThese lived in the days of Joiakim the\nson of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and\nin the days of Nehemiah the governor,\nand of Ezra the priest, the scribe.\nof Abijah, Zichri; the son of Minjamin;\nof Moadiah, Piltai;\nof Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah,\nJehonathan;\nof Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;\nNow at the dedication of the wall of\nJerusalem they sought out the Levites in\nall their places, to bring them to\nJerusalem to celebrate the dedication\nwith gladness, both with thanksgivings\nand singing, with cymbals and stringed\ninstruments and harps.\nof Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;\nof Hilkiah, Hashabiah; and of Jedaiah,\nNethanel.\nAnd the sons of the singers gathered\ntogether from the countryside around\nJerusalem, from the villages of the\nNetophathites,\nDuring the reign of Darius the Persian,\na record was also kept of the Levites\nand priests who had been heads of their\nfathers' houses in the days of Eliashib,\nJoiada, Johanan, and Jaddua.\nThe sons of Levi, the heads of the\nfathers' houses until the days of\nJohanan the son of Eliashib, were\nwritten in the book of the chronicles.\nAnd the heads of the Levites were\nHashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the\nson of Kadmiel, with their brothers\nacross from them, to praise and give\nthanks, group alternating with group,\naccording to the command of David the\nman of God.\nMattaniah,\nBakbukiah,\nObadiah,\nMeshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were\nfrom the house of Gilgal, and from the\nfields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the\nsingers had built themselves villages all\naround Jerusalem.\nThen the priests and Levites purified\nthemselves, and purified the people, the\ngates, and the wall.\nSo I brought the leaders of Judah up\non the wall, and appointed two large\nthanksgiving choirs. One went to the\nright hand on the wall toward the Refuse\nGate.\nAfter them went Hoshaiah and half of\nthe leaders of Judah,\nand Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,\nJudah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,\nand some of the priests' sons with\ntrumpets--Zechariah\nthe\nson\nof\nJonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son\nof Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the\nson of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,\nAlso that day they offered great\nsacrifices, and rejoiced, for God had\nmade them rejoice with great joy; the\nwomen and the children also rejoiced,\nso that the joy of Jerusalem was heard\nafar off.\nand his brethren, Shemaiah, Azarel,\nMilalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah,\nand\nHanani,\nwith\nthe\nmusical\ninstruments of David the man of God.\nAnd Ezra the scribe went before them.\nBy the Fountain Gate, in front of them,\nthey went up the stairs of the City of\nDavid, on the stairway of the wall,\nbeyond the house of David, as far as the\nWater Gate eastward.\nThe other thanksgiving choir went the\nopposite way, and I was behind them\nwith half of the people on the wall, going\npast the Tower of the Ovens as far as\nthe Broad Wall,\nand above the Gate of Ephraim, above\nthe Old Gate, above the Fish Gate, the\nTower of Hananel, the Tower of the\nHundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and\nthey stopped by the Gate of the Prison.\nSo the two thanksgiving choirs stood\nin the house of God, likewise I and the\nhalf of the rulers with me;\nAnd at the same time some were\nappointed over the rooms of the\nstorehouse for the offerings, the\nfirstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into\nthem from the fields of the cities the\nportions specified by the Law for the\npriests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced\nover the priests and Levites who\nministered.\nBoth the singers and the gatekeepers\nkept the charge of their God and the\ncharge of the purification, according to\nthe command of David and Solomon his\nson.\nFor in the days of David and Asaph of\nold there were chiefs of the singers, and\nsongs of praise and thanksgiving to God.\nIn the days of Zerubbabel and in the\ndays of Nehemiah all Israel gave the\nportions for the singers and the\ngatekeepers, a portion for each day.\nThey also consecrated holy things for\nthe Levites, and the Levites consecrated\nthem for the children of Aaron.\nand the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah,\nMinjamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah,\nand Hananiah, with trumpets;\nalso Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar,\nUzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and\nEzer. The singers sang loudly with\nJezrahiah the director.\n13On that day they read from the\nBook of Moses in the hearing of the\npeople, and in it was found written that\nno Ammonite or Moabite should ever\ncome into the assembly of God,\nbecause they had not met the children\nof Israel with bread and water, but hired\nBalaam against them to curse them.\nHowever, our God turned the curse into\na blessing.\nI also realized that the portions for the\nLevites had not been given them; for\neach of the Levites and the singers who\ndid the work had gone back to his field.\nSo it was, when they had heard the\nLaw, that they separated all the mixed\nmultitude from Israel.\nSo I contended with the rulers, and\nsaid, \"Why is the house of God\nforsaken?\" And I gathered them\ntogether and set them in their place.\nNow before this, Eliashib the priest,\nhaving authority over the storerooms of\nthe house of our God, was allied with\nTobiah.\nThen all Judah brought the tithe of the\ngrain and the new wine and the oil to the\nstorehouse.\nAnd he had prepared for him a large\nroom, where previously they had stored\nthe grain offerings, the frankincense, the\narticles, the tithes of grain, the new wine\nand oil, which were commanded to be\ngiven to the Levites and singers and\ngatekeepers, and the offerings for the\npriests.\nAnd I appointed as treasurers over the\nstorehouse Shelemiah the priest and\nZadok the scribe, and of the Levites,\nPedaiah; and next to them was Hanan\nthe son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah;\nfor they were considered faithful, and\ntheir task was to distribute to their\nbrethren.\nBut during all this I was not in\nJerusalem, for in the thirty-second year\nof Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had\nreturned to the king. Then after certain\ndays I obtained leave from the king,\nand I came to Jerusalem and\ndiscovered the evil that Eliashib had\ndone for Tobiah, in preparing a room for\nhim in the courts of the house of God.\nAnd it grieved me bitterly; therefore I\nthrew all the household goods of Tobiah\nout of the room.\nThen I commanded them to cleanse the\nrooms; and I brought back into them the\narticles of the house of God, with the\ngrain offering and the frankincense.\nRemember me, O my God, concerning\nthis, and do not wipe out my good deeds\nthat I have done for the house of my\nGod, and for its services!\nIn those days I saw people in Judah\ntreading wine presses on the Sabbath,\nand bringing in sheaves, and loading\ndonkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all\nkinds of burdens, which they brought\ninto Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And\nI warned them about the day on which\nthey were selling provisions.\nMen of Tyre dwelt there also, who\nbrought in fish and all kinds of goods,\nand sold them on the Sabbath to the\nchildren of Judah, and in Jerusalem.\nThen I contended with the nobles of\nJudah, and said to them, \"What evil\nthing is this that you do, by which you\nprofane the Sabbath day?\nAnd half of their children spoke the\nlanguage of Ashdod, and could not\nspeak the language of Judah, but spoke\naccording to the language of one or the\nother people.\nDid not your fathers do thus, and did\nnot our God bring all this disaster on us\nand on this city? Yet you bring added\nwrath on Israel by profaning the\nSabbath.\"\nSo it was, at the gates of Jerusalem,\nas it began to be dark before the\nSabbath, that I commanded the gates to\nbe shut, and charged that they must not\nbe opened till after the Sabbath. Then I\nposted some of my servants at the\ngates, so that no burdens would be\nbrought in on the Sabbath day.\nSo I contended with them and cursed\nthem, struck some of them and pulled\nout their hair, and made them swear by\nGod, saying, \"You shall not give your\ndaughters as wives to their sons, nor\ntake their daughters for your sons or\nyourselves.\nDid not Solomon king of Israel sin by\nthese things? Yet among many nations\nthere was no king like him, who was\nbeloved of his God; and God made him\nking over all Israel. Nevertheless pagan\nwomen caused even him to sin.\nNow the merchants and sellers of all\nkinds of wares lodged outside\nJerusalem once or twice.\nShould we then hear of your doing all\nthis great evil, transgressing against our\nGod by marrying pagan women?\"\nThen I warned them, and said to them,\n\"Why do you spend the night around the\nwall? If you do so again, I will lay hands\non you!\" From that time on they came\nno more on the Sabbath.\nAnd one of the sons of Joiada, the son\nof Eliashib the high priest, was a son-inlaw of Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I\ndrove him from me.\nAnd I commanded the Levites that\nthey should cleanse themselves, and\nthat they should go and guard the gates,\nto sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember\nme, O my God, concerning this also,\nand spare me according to the\ngreatness of Your mercy!\nIn those days I also saw Jews who\nhad married women of Ashdod, Ammon,\nand Moab.\nRemember them, O my God, because\nthey have defiled the priesthood and the\ncovenant of the priesthood and the\nLevites.\nThus I cleansed them of everything\npagan. I also assigned duties to the\npriests and the Levites, each to his\nservice,\nand to bringing the wood offering and\nthe firstfruits at appointed times.\nRemember me, O my God, for good!\nEsther\n1Now it came to pass in the days of\nAhasuerus (this was the Ahasuerus who\nreigned over one hundred and twentyseven provinces, from India to Ethiopia),\nin those days when King Ahasuerus sat\non the throne of his kingdom, which was\nin Shushan the citadel,\nthat in the third year of his reign he\nmade a feast for all his officials and\nservants--the powers of Persia and\nMedia, the nobles, and the princes of\nthe provinces being before him-4\nwhen he showed the riches of his\nglorious kingdom and the splendor of his\nexcellent majesty for many days, one\nhundred and eighty days in all.\nAnd when these days were completed,\nthe king made a feast lasting seven\ndays for all the people who were present\nin Shushan the citadel, from great to\nsmall, in the court of the garden of the\nking's palace.\nThere were white and blue linen\ncurtains fastened with cords of fine linen\nand purple on silver rods and marble\npillars; and the couches were of gold\nand silver on a mosaic pavement of\nalabaster, turquoise, and white and\nblack marble.\nAnd they served drinks in golden\nvessels, each vessel being different\nfrom the other, with royal wine in\nabundance, according to the generosity\nof the king.\nIn accordance with the law, the drinking\nwas not compulsory; for so the king had\nordered all the officers of his household,\nthat they should do according to each\nman's pleasure.\nQueen Vashti also made a feast for the\nwomen in the royal palace which\nbelonged to King Ahasuerus.\nOn the seventh day, when the heart of\nthe king was merry with wine, he\ncommanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona,\nBigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas,\nseven eunuchs who served in the\npresence of King Ahasuerus,\nto bring Queen Vashti before the king,\nwearing her royal crown, in order to\nshow her beauty to the people and the\nofficials, for she was beautiful to behold.\nBut Queen Vashti refused to come at\nthe king's command brought by his\neunuchs; therefore the king was furious,\nand his anger burned within him.\nThen the king said to the wise men\nwho understood the times (for this was\nthe king's manner toward all who knew\nlaw and justice,\nthose closest to him being Carshena,\nShethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres,\nMarsena, and Memucan, the seven\nprinces of Persia and Media, who had\naccess to the king's presence, and who\nranked highest in the kingdom):\nAnd the reply pleased the king and the\nprinces, and the king did according to\nthe word of Memucan.\n\"What shall we do to Queen Vashti,\naccording to law, because she did not\nobey the command of King Ahasuerus\nbrought to her by the eunuchs?\"\nAnd Memucan answered before the\nking and the princes: \"Queen Vashti has\nnot only wronged the king, but also all\nthe princes, and all the people who are\nin all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.\nFor the queen's behavior will become\nknown to all women, so that they will\ndespise their husbands in their eyes,\nwhen they report, \"King Ahasuerus\ncommanded Queen Vashti to be\nbrought in before him, but she did not\ncome.'\nThis very day the noble ladies of\nPersia and Media will say to all the\nking's officials that they have heard of\nthe behavior of the queen. Thus there\nwill be excessive contempt and wrath.\nIf it pleases the king, let a royal decree\ngo out from him, and let it be recorded in\nthe laws of the Persians and the Medes,\nso that it will not be altered, that Vashti\nshall come no more before King\nAhasuerus; and let the king give her\nroyal position to another who is better\nthan she.\nWhen the king's decree which he will\nmake is proclaimed throughout all his\nempire (for it is great), all wives will\nhonor their husbands, both great and\nsmall.\"\nThen he sent letters to all the king's\nprovinces, to each province in its own\nscript, and to every people in their own\nlanguage, that each man should be\nmaster in his own house, and speak in\nthe language of his own people.\n2After these things, when the wrath of\nKing\nAhasuerus\nsubsided,\nhe\nremembered Vashti, what she had done,\nand what had been decreed against her.\nThen the king's servants who attended\nhim said: \"Let beautiful young virgins be\nsought for the king;\nand let the king appoint officers in all\nthe provinces of his kingdom, that they\nmay gather all the beautiful young\nvirgins to Shushan the citadel, into the\nwomen's quarters, under the custody of\nHegai the king's eunuch, custodian of\nthe women. And let beauty preparations\nbe given them.\nThen let the young woman who pleases\nthe king be queen instead of Vashti.\"\nThis thing pleased the king, and he did\nso.\nIn Shushan the citadel there was a\ncertain Jew whose name was Mordecai\nthe son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the\nson of Kish, a Benjamite.\nKish had been carried away from\nJerusalem with the captives who had\nbeen captured with Jeconiah king of\nJudah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king\nof Babylon had carried away.\nperfumes\nand\npreparations\nbeautifying women.\nAnd Mordecai had brought up\nHadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's\ndaughter, for she had neither father nor\nmother. The young woman was lovely\nand beautiful. When her father and\nmother died, Mordecai took her as his\nown daughter.\nSo it was, when the king's command\nand decree were heard, and when many\nyoung women were gathered at\nShushan the citadel, under the custody\nof Hegai, that Esther also was taken to\nthe king's palace, into the care of Hegai\nthe custodian of the women.\nNow the young woman pleased him,\nand she obtained his favor; so he readily\ngave beauty preparations to her,\nbesides her allowance. Then seven\nchoice maidservants were provided for\nher from the king's palace, and he\nmoved her and her maidservants to the\nbest place in the house of the women.\nEsther had not revealed her people or\nfamily, for Mordecai had charged her not\nto reveal it.\nfor\nThus prepared, each young woman\nwent to the king, and she was given\nwhatever she desired to take with her\nfrom the women's quarters to the king's\npalace.\nIn the evening she went, and in the\nmorning she returned to the second\nhouse of the women, to the custody of\nShaashgaz, the king's eunuch who kept\nthe concubines. She would not go in to\nthe king again unless the king delighted\nin her and called for her by name.\nNow when the turn came for Esther\nthe daughter of Abihail the uncle of\nMordecai, who had taken her as his\ndaughter, to go in to the king, she\nrequested nothing but what Hegai the\nking's eunuch, the custodian of the\nwomen, advised. And Esther obtained\nfavor in the sight of all who saw her.\nSo Esther was taken to King\nAhasuerus, into his royal palace, in the\ntenth month, which is the month of\nTebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.\nAnd every day Mordecai paced in front\nof the court of the women's quarters, to\nlearn of Esther's welfare and what was\nhappening to her.\nThe king loved Esther more than all\nthe other women, and she obtained\ngrace and favor in his sight more than\nall the virgins; so he set the royal crown\nupon her head and made her queen\ninstead of Vashti.\nEach young woman's turn came to go\nin to King Ahasuerus after she had\ncompleted twelve months' preparation,\naccording to the regulations for the\nwomen, for thus were the days of their\npreparation apportioned: six months\nwith oil of myrrh, and six months with\nThen the king made a great feast, the\nFeast of Esther, for all his officials and\nservants; and he proclaimed a holiday in\nthe provinces and gave gifts according\nto the generosity of a king.\nWhen virgins were gathered together a\nsecond time, Mordecai sat within the\nking's gate.\n\"Why do you transgress the king's\ncommand?\"\nNow Esther had not revealed her\nfamily and her people, just as Mordecai\nhad charged her, for Esther obeyed the\ncommand of Mordecai as when she was\nbrought up by him.\nNow it happened, when they spoke to\nhim daily and he would not listen to\nthem, that they told it to Haman, to see\nwhether Mordecai's words would stand;\nfor Mordecai had told them that he was\na Jew.\nIn those days, while Mordecai sat\nwithin the king's gate, two of the king's\neunuchs,\nBigthan\nand\nTeresh,\ndoorkeepers, became furious and\nsought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.\nWhen Haman saw that Mordecai did\nnot bow or pay him homage, Haman\nwas filled with wrath.\nSo the matter became known to\nMordecai, who told Queen Esther, and\nEsther informed the king in Mordecai's\nname.\nBut he disdained to lay hands on\nMordecai alone, for they had told him of\nthe people of Mordecai. Instead, Haman\nsought to destroy all the Jews who were\nthroughout the whole kingdom of\nAhasuerus--the people of Mordecai.\nAnd when an inquiry was made into\nthe matter, it was confirmed, and both\nwere hanged on a gallows; and it was\nwritten in the book of the chronicles in\nthe presence of the king.\n3After these things King Ahasuerus\npromoted\nHaman,\nthe\nson\nof\nHammedatha\nthe\nAgagite,\nand\nadvanced him and set his seat above all\nthe princes who were with him.\nAnd all the king's servants who were\nwithin the king's gate bowed and paid\nhomage to Haman, for so the king had\ncommanded concerning him. But\nMordecai would not bow or pay homage.\nThen the king's servants who were\nwithin the king's gate said to Mordecai,\nIn the first month, which is the month of\nNisan, in the twelfth year of King\nAhasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, the\nlot), before Haman to determine the day\nand the month, until it fell on the twelfth\nmonth, which is the month of Adar.\nThen Haman said to King Ahasuerus,\n\"There is a certain people scattered and\ndispersed among the people in all the\nprovinces of your kingdom; their laws\nare different from all other people's, and\nthey do not keep the king's laws.\nTherefore it is not fitting for the king to\nlet them remain.\nIf it pleases the king, let a decree be\nwritten that they be destroyed, and I will\npay ten thousand talents of silver into\nthe hands of those who do the work, to\nbring it into the king's treasuries.\"\nSo the king took his signet ring from\nhis hand and gave it to Haman, the son\nof Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy\nof the Jews.\nAnd the king said to Haman, \"The\nmoney and the people are given to you,\nto do with them as seems good to you.\"\nThen the king's scribes were called on\nthe thirteenth day of the first month, and\na decree was written according to all\nthat Haman commanded--to the king's\nsatraps, to the governors who were over\neach province, to the officials of all\npeople, to every province according to\nits script, and to every people in their\nlanguage. In the name of King\nAhasuerus it was written, and sealed\nwith the king's signet ring.\nAnd the letters were sent by couriers\ninto all the king's provinces, to destroy,\nto kill, and to annihilate all the Jews,\nboth young and old, little children and\nwomen, in one day, on the thirteenth\nday of the twelfth month, which is the\nmonth of Adar, and to plunder their\npossessions.\nA copy of the document was to be\nissued as law in every province, being\npublished for all people, that they should\nbe ready for that day.\nThe couriers went out, hastened by\nthe king's command; and the decree\nwas proclaimed in Shushan the citadel.\nSo the king and Haman sat down to\ndrink, but the city of Shushan was\nperplexed.\n4When Mordecai learned all that had\nhappened, he tore his clothes and put\non sackcloth and ashes, and went out\ninto the midst of the city. He cried out\nwith a loud and bitter cry.\nHe went as far as the front of the king's\ngate, for no one might enter the king's\ngate clothed with sackcloth.\nAnd in every province where the king's\ncommand and decree arrived, there was\ngreat mourning among the Jews, with\nfasting, weeping, and wailing; and many\nlay in sackcloth and ashes.\nSo Esther's maids and eunuchs came\nand told her, and the queen was deeply\ndistressed. Then she sent garments to\nclothe Mordecai and take his sackcloth\naway from him, but he would not accept\nthem.\nThen Esther called Hathach, one of the\nking's eunuchs whom he had appointed\nto attend her, and she gave him a\ncommand concerning Mordecai, to learn\nwhat and why this was.\nSo Hathach went out to Mordecai in the\ncity square that was in front of the king's\ngate.\nAnd Mordecai told him all that had\nhappened to him, and the sum of money\nthat Haman had promised to pay into\nthe king's treasuries to destroy the Jews.\nHe also gave him a copy of the written\ndecree for their destruction, which was\ngiven at Shushan, that he might show it\nto Esther and explain it to her, and that\nhe might command her to go in to the\nking to make supplication to him and\nplead before him for her people.\nwhich is against the law; and if I perish, I\nperish!\"\nSo Hathach returned and told Esther\nthe words of Mordecai.\nThen Esther spoke to Hathach, and\ngave him a command for Mordecai:\n\"All the king's servants and the people\nof the king's provinces know that any\nman or woman who goes into the inner\ncourt to the king, who has not been\ncalled, he has but one law: put all to\ndeath, except the one to whom the king\nholds out the golden scepter, that he\nmay live. Yet I myself have not been\ncalled to go in to the king these thirty\ndays.\"\nSo they told Mordecai Esther's words.\nSo Mordecai went his way and did\naccording to all that Esther commanded\nhim.\n5Now it happened on the third day that\nEsther put on her royal robes and stood\nin the inner court of the king's palace,\nacross from the king's house, while the\nking sat on his royal throne in the royal\nhouse, facing the entrance of the house.\nSo it was, when the king saw Queen\nEsther standing in the court, that she\nfound favor in his sight, and the king\nheld out to Esther the golden scepter\nthat was in his hand. Then Esther went\nnear and touched the top of the scepter.\nAnd Mordecai told them to answer\nEsther: \"Do not think in your heart that\nyou will escape in the king's palace any\nmore than all the other Jews.\nAnd the king said to her, \"What do you\nwish, Queen Esther? What is your\nrequest? It shall be given to you--up to\nhalf the kingdom!\"\nFor if you remain completely silent at\nthis time, relief and deliverance will arise\nfor the Jews from another place, but you\nand your father's house will perish. Yet\nwho knows whether you have come to\nthe kingdom for such a time as this?\"\nThen Esther told them to reply to\nMordecai:\nSo Esther answered, \"If it pleases the\nking, let the king and Haman come\ntoday to the banquet that I have\nprepared for him.\"\nThen the king said, \"Bring Haman\nquickly, that he may do as Esther has\nsaid.\" So the king and Haman went to\nthe banquet that Esther had prepared.\n\"Go, gather all the Jews who are\npresent in Shushan, and fast for me;\nneither eat nor drink for three days,\nnight or day. My maids and I will fast\nlikewise. And so I will go to the king,\nAt the banquet of wine the king said to\nEsther, \"What is your petition? It shall be\ngranted you. What is your request, up to\nhalf the kingdom? It shall be done!\"\nThen Esther answered and said, \"My\npetition and request is this:\nIf I have found favor in the sight of the\nking, and if it pleases the king to grant\nmy petition and fulfill my request, then\nlet the king and Haman come to the\nbanquet which I will prepare for them,\nand tomorrow I will do as the king has\nsaid.\"\nSo Haman went out that day joyful and\nwith a glad heart; but when Haman saw\nMordecai in the king's gate, and that he\ndid not stand or tremble before him, he\nwas filled with indignation against\nMordecai.\nNevertheless\nHaman\nrestrained\nhimself and went home, and he sent\nand called for his friends and his wife\nZeresh.\nThen Haman told them of his great\nriches, the multitude of his children,\neverything in which the king had\npromoted him, and how he had\nadvanced him above the officials and\nservants of the king.\nMoreover Haman said, \"Besides,\nQueen Esther invited no one but me to\ncome in with the king to the banquet that\nshe prepared; and tomorrow I am again\ninvited by her, along with the king.\nYet all this avails me nothing, so long\nas I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the\nking's gate.\"\nThen his wife Zeresh and all his\nfriends said to him, \"Let a gallows be\nmade, fifty cubits high, and in the\nmorning suggest to the king that\nMordecai be hanged on it; then go\nmerrily with the king to the banquet.\"\nAnd the thing pleased Haman; so he\nhad the gallows made.\n6That night the king could not sleep.\nSo one was commanded to bring the\nbook of the records of the chronicles;\nand they were read before the king.\nAnd it was found written that Mordecai\nhad told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of\nthe king's eunuchs, the doorkeepers\nwho had sought to lay hands on King\nAhasuerus.\nThen the king said, \"What honor or\ndignity has been bestowed on Mordecai\nfor this?\" And the king's servants who\nattended him said, \"Nothing has been\ndone for him.\"\nSo the king said, \"Who is in the court?\"\nNow Haman had just entered the outer\ncourt of the king's palace to suggest that\nthe king hang Mordecai on the gallows\nthat he had prepared for him.\nThe king's servants said to him,\n\"Haman is there, standing in the court.\"\nAnd the king said, \"Let him come in.\"\nSo Haman came in, and the king asked\nhim, \"What shall be done for the man\nwhom the king delights to honor?\" Now\nHaman thought in his heart, \"Whom\nwould the king delight to honor more\nthan me?\"\nAnd Haman answered the king, \"For\nthe man whom the king delights to\nhonor,\nagainst him but will surely fall before\nhim.\"\nlet a royal robe be brought which the\nking has worn, and a horse on which the\nking has ridden, which has a royal crest\nplaced on its head.\nThen let this robe and horse be\ndelivered to the hand of one of the king's\nmost noble princes, that he may array\nthe man whom the king delights to\nhonor. Then parade him on horseback\nthrough the city square, and proclaim\nbefore him: \"Thus shall it be done to the\nman whom the king delights to honor!'\nThen the king said to Haman, \"Hurry,\ntake the robe and the horse, as you\nhave suggested, and do so for Mordecai\nthe Jew who sits within the king's gate!\nLeave nothing undone of all that you\nhave spoken.\"\nSo Haman took the robe and the horse,\narrayed Mordecai and led him on\nhorseback through the city square, and\nproclaimed before him, \"Thus shall it be\ndone to the man whom the king delights\nto honor!\"\nAfterward Mordecai went back to the\nking's gate. But Haman hurried to his\nhouse, mourning and with his head\ncovered.\nWhen Haman told his wife Zeresh and\nall his friends everything that had\nhappened to him, his wise men and his\nwife Zeresh said to him, \"If Mordecai,\nbefore whom you have begun to fall, is\nof Jewish descent, you will not prevail\nWhile they were still talking with him,\nthe king's eunuchs came, and hastened\nto bring Haman to the banquet which\nEsther had prepared.\n7So the king and Haman went to dine\nwith Queen Esther.\nAnd on the second day, at the banquet\nof wine, the king again said to Esther,\n\"What is your petition, Queen Esther? It\nshall be granted you. And what is your\nrequest, up to half the kingdom? It shall\nbe done!\"\nThen Queen Esther answered and said,\n\"If I have found favor in your sight, O\nking, and if it pleases the king, let my life\nbe given me at my petition, and my\npeople at my request.\nFor we have been sold, my people and\nI, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be\nannihilated. Had we been sold as male\nand female slaves, I would have held\nmy tongue, although the enemy could\nnever compensate for the king's loss.\"\nSo King Ahasuerus answered and said\nto Queen Esther, \"Who is he, and where\nis he, who would dare presume in his\nheart to do such a thing?\"\nAnd Esther said, \"The adversary and\nenemy is this wicked Haman!\" So\nHaman was terrified before the king and\nqueen.\nThen the king arose in his wrath from\nthe banquet of wine and went into the\npalace garden; but Haman stood before\nQueen Esther, pleading for his life, for\nhe saw that evil was determined against\nhim by the king.\nWhen the king returned from the palace\ngarden to the place of the banquet of\nwine, Haman had fallen across the\ncouch where Esther was. Then the king\nsaid, \"Will he also assault the queen\nwhile I am in the house?\" As the word\nleft the king's mouth, they covered\nHaman's face.\nNow Harbonah, one of the eunuchs,\nsaid to the king, \"Look! The gallows, fifty\ncubits high, which Haman made for\nMordecai, who spoke good on the king's\nbehalf, is standing at the house of\nHaman.\" Then the king said, \"Hang him\non it!\"\nSo they hanged Haman on the gallows\nthat he had prepared for Mordecai. Then\nthe king's wrath subsided.\n8On that day King Ahasuerus gave\nQueen Esther the house of Haman, the\nenemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came\nbefore the king, for Esther had told how\nhe was related to her.\ntears to counteract the evil of Haman\nthe Agagite, and the scheme which he\nhad devised against the Jews.\nAnd the king held out the golden\nscepter toward Esther. So Esther arose\nand stood before the king,\nand said, \"If it pleases the king, and if I\nhave found favor in his sight and the\nthing seems right to the king and I am\npleasing in his eyes, let it be written to\nrevoke the letters devised by Haman,\nthe son of Hammedatha the Agagite,\nwhich he wrote to annihilate the Jews\nwho are in all the king's provinces.\nFor how can I endure to see the evil\nthat will come to my people? Or how\ncan I endure to see the destruction of\nmy countrymen?\"\nThen King Ahasuerus said to Queen\nEsther and Mordecai the Jew, \"Indeed, I\nhave given Esther the house of Haman,\nand they have hanged him on the\ngallows because he tried to lay his hand\non the Jews.\nYou yourselves write a decree\nconcerning the Jews, as you please, in\nthe king's name, and seal it with the\nking's signet ring; for whatever is written\nin the king's name and sealed with the\nking's signet ring no one can revoke.\"\nSo the king took off his signet ring,\nwhich he had taken from Haman, and\ngave it to Mordecai; and Esther\nappointed Mordecai over the house of\nHaman.\nNow Esther spoke again to the king, fell\ndown at his feet, and implored him with\nSo the king's scribes were called at that\ntime, in the third month, which is the\nmonth of Sivan, on the twenty-third day;\nand it was written, according to all that\nMordecai commanded, to the Jews, the\nsatraps, the governors, and the princes\nof the provinces from India to Ethiopia,\none\nhundred\nand\ntwenty-seven\nprovinces in all, to every province in its\nown script, to every people in their own\nlanguage, and to the Jews in their own\nscript and language.\nAnd he wrote in the name of King\nAhasuerus, sealed it with the king's\nsignet ring, and sent letters by couriers\non horseback, riding on royal horses\nbred from swift steeds.\nBy these letters the king permitted the\nJews who were in every city to gather\ntogether and protect their lives--to\ndestroy, kill, and annihilate all the forces\nof any people or province that would\nassault them, both little children and\nwomen,\nand\nto\nplunder\ntheir\npossessions,\non one day in all the provinces of King\nAhasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the\ntwelfth month, which is the month of\nAdar.\nA copy of the document was to be\nissued as a decree in every province\nand published for all people, so that the\nJews would be ready on that day to\navenge themselves on their enemies.\nThe couriers who rode on royal horses\nwent out, hastened and pressed on by\nthe king's command. And the decree\nwas issued in Shushan the citadel.\nSo Mordecai went out from the\npresence of the king in royal apparel of\nblue and white, with a great crown of\ngold and a garment of fine linen and\npurple; and the city of Shushan rejoiced\nand was glad.\nThe Jews had light and gladness, joy\nand honor.\nAnd in every province and city,\nwherever the king's command and\ndecree came, the Jews had joy and\ngladness, a feast and a holiday. Then\nmany of the people of the land became\nJews, because fear of the Jews fell\nupon them.\n9Now in the twelfth month, that is, the\nmonth of Adar, on the thirteenth day, the\ntime came for the king's command and\nhis decree to be executed. On the day\nthat the enemies of the Jews had hoped\nto overpower them, the opposite\noccurred, in that the Jews themselves\noverpowered those who hated them.\nThe Jews gathered together in their\ncities throughout all the provinces of\nKing Ahasuerus to lay hands on those\nwho sought their harm. And no one\ncould withstand them, because fear of\nthem fell upon all people.\nAnd all the officials of the provinces, the\nsatraps, the governors, and all those\ndoing the king's work, helped the Jews,\nbecause the fear of Mordecai fell upon\nthem.\nFor Mordecai was great in the king's\npalace, and his fame spread throughout\nall the provinces; for this man Mordecai\nbecame increasingly prominent.\nThus the Jews defeated all their\nenemies with the stroke of the sword,\nwith slaughter and destruction, and did\nwhat they pleased with those who hated\nthem.\nAnd in Shushan the citadel the Jews\nkilled and destroyed five hundred men.\nAnd the Jews who were in Shushan\ngathered together again on the\nfourteenth day of the month of Adar and\nkilled three hundred men at Shushan;\nbut they did not lay a hand on the\nplunder.\nAlso Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,\nPoratha, Adalia, Aridatha,\nParmashta,\nVajezatha--\nArisai,\nAridai,\nand\nthe ten sons of Haman the son of\nHammedatha, the enemy of the Jews-they killed; but they did not lay a hand\non the plunder.\nOn that day the number of those who\nwere killed in Shushan the citadel was\nbrought to the king.\nAnd the king said to Queen Esther,\n\"The Jews have killed and destroyed\nfive hundred men in Shushan the citadel,\nand the ten sons of Haman. What have\nthey done in the rest of the king's\nprovinces? Now what is your petition? It\nshall be granted to you. Or what is your\nfurther request? It shall be done.\"\nThen Esther said, \"If it pleases the\nking, let it be granted to the Jews who\nare in Shushan to do again tomorrow\naccording to today's decree, and let\nHaman's ten sons be hanged on the\ngallows.\"\nSo the king commanded this to be\ndone; the decree was issued in\nShushan, and they hanged Haman's ten\nsons.\nThe remainder of the Jews in the\nking's provinces gathered together and\nprotected their lives, had rest from their\nenemies,\nand\nkilled\nseventy-five\nthousand of their enemies; but they did\nnot lay a hand on the plunder.\nThis was on the thirteenth day of the\nmonth of Adar. And on the fourteenth of\nthe month they rested and made it a day\nof feasting and gladness.\nBut the Jews who were at Shushan\nassembled together on the thirteenth\nday, as well as on the fourteenth; and\non the fifteenth of the month they rested,\nand made it a day of feasting and\ngladness.\nTherefore the Jews of the villages who\ndwelt in the unwalled towns celebrated\nthe fourteenth day of the month of Adar\nwith gladness and feasting, as a holiday,\nand for sending presents to one another.\nAnd Mordecai wrote these things and\nsent letters to all the Jews, near and far,\nwho were in all the provinces of King\nAhasuerus,\nto establish among them that they\nshould celebrate yearly the fourteenth\nand fifteenth days of the month of Adar,\nas the days on which the Jews had\nrest from their enemies, as the month\nwhich was turned from sorrow to joy for\nthem, and from mourning to a holiday;\nthat they should make them days of\nfeasting and joy, of sending presents to\none another and gifts to the poor.\nSo the Jews accepted the custom\nwhich they had begun, as Mordecai had\nwritten to them,\nbecause\nHaman,\nthe\nson\nof\nHammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of\nall the Jews, had plotted against the\nJews to annihilate them, and had cast\nPur (that is, the lot), to consume them\nand destroy them;\nbut when Esther came before the king,\nhe commanded by letter that this wicked\nplot which Haman had devised against\nthe Jews should return on his own head,\nand that he and his sons should be\nhanged on the gallows.\nSo they called these days Purim, after\nthe name Pur. Therefore, because of all\nthe words of this letter, what they had\nseen concerning this matter, and what\nhad happened to them,\nthe Jews established and imposed it\nupon themselves and their descendants\nand all who would join them, that without\nfail they should celebrate these two\ndays every year, according to the written\ninstructions and according to the\nprescribed time,\nthat\nthese\ndays\nshould\nbe\nremembered and kept throughout every\ngeneration, every family, every province,\nand every city, that these days of Purim\nshould not fail to be observed among\nthe Jews, and that the memory of them\nshould not\ndescendants.\nperish\namong\ntheir\nThen Queen Esther, the daughter of\nAbihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote\nwith full authority to confirm this second\nletter about Purim.\nAnd Mordecai sent letters to all the\nJews, to the one hundred and twentyseven provinces of the kingdom of\nAhasuerus, with words of peace and\ntruth,\nto confirm these days of Purim at their\nappointed time, as Mordecai the Jew\nand Queen Esther had prescribed for\nthem, and as they had decreed for\nthemselves and their descendants\nconcerning matters of their fasting and\nlamenting.\nSo the decree of Esther confirmed\nthese matters of Purim, and it was\nwritten in the book.\n10And King Ahasuerus imposed\ntribute on the land and on the islands of\nthe sea.\nNow all the acts of his power and his\nmight, and the account of the greatness\nof Mordecai, to which the king advanced\nhim, are they not written in the book of\nthe chronicles of the kings of Media and\nPersia?\nFor Mordecai the Jew was second to\nKing Ahasuerus, and was great among\nthe Jews and well received by the\nmultitude of his brethren, seeking the\ngood of his people and speaking peace\nto all his countrymen.\nJob\n1There was a man in the land of Uz,\nwhose name was Job; and that man\nwas blameless and upright, and one\nwho feared God and shunned evil.\nAnd seven sons and three daughters\nwere born to him.\nAlso, his possessions were seven\nthousand sheep, three thousand camels,\nfive hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred\nfemale donkeys, and a very large\nhousehold, so that this man was the\ngreatest of all the people of the East.\nAnd his sons would go and feast in\ntheir houses, each on his appointed day,\nand would send and invite their three\nsisters to eat and drink with them.\nSo it was, when the days of feasting\nhad run their course, that Job would\nsend and sanctify them, and he would\nrise early in the morning and offer burnt\nofferings according to the number of\nthem all. For Job said, \"It may be that\nmy sons have sinned and cursed God in\ntheir hearts.\" Thus Job did regularly.\nNow there was a day when the sons of\nGod came to present themselves before\nthe LORD, and Satan also came among\nthem.\nAnd the LORD said to Satan, \"From\nwhere do you come?\" So Satan\nanswered the LORD and said, \"From\ngoing to and fro on the earth, and from\nwalking back and forth on it.\"\nThen the LORD said to Satan, \"Have\nyou considered My servant Job, that\nthere is none like him on the earth, a\nblameless and upright man, one who\nfears God and shuns evil?\"\nSo Satan answered the LORD and said,\n\"Does Job fear God for nothing?\nHave You not made a hedge around\nhim, around his household, and around\nall that he has on every side? You have\nblessed the work of his hands, and his\npossessions have increased in the land.\nBut now, stretch out Your hand and\ntouch all that he has, and he will surely\ncurse You to Your face!\"\nAnd the LORD said to Satan, \"Behold,\nall that he has is in your power; only do\nnot lay a hand on his person.\" So Satan\nwent out from the presence of the LORD.\nNow there was a day when his sons\nand daughters were eating and drinking\nwine in their oldest brother's house;\nand a messenger came to Job and\nsaid, \"The oxen were plowing and the\ndonkeys feeding beside them,\nwhen the Sabeans raided them and\ntook them away--indeed they have killed\nthe servants with the edge of the sword;\nand I alone have escaped to tell you!\"\nWhile he was still speaking, another\nalso came and said, \"The fire of God fell\nfrom heaven and burned up the sheep\nand the servants, and consumed them;\nand I alone have escaped to tell you!\"\nAnd the LORD said to Satan, \"From\nwhere do you come?\" Satan answered\nthe LORD and said, \"From going to and\nfro on the earth, and from walking back\nand forth on it.\"\nWhile he was still speaking, another\nalso came and said, \"The Chaldeans\nformed three bands, raided the camels\nand took them away, yes, and killed the\nservants with the edge of the sword; and\nI alone have escaped to tell you!\"\nWhile he was still speaking, another\nalso came and said, \"Your sons and\ndaughters were eating and drinking wine\nin their oldest brother's house,\nThen the LORD said to Satan, \"Have\nyou considered My servant Job, that\nthere is none like him on the earth, a\nblameless and upright man, one who\nfears God and shuns evil? And still he\nholds fast to his integrity, although you\nincited Me against him, to destroy him\nwithout cause.\"\nSo Satan answered the LORD and said,\n\"Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he\nwill give for his life.\nand suddenly a great wind came from\nacross the wilderness and struck the\nfour corners of the house, and it fell on\nthe young people, and they are dead;\nand I alone have escaped to tell you!\"\nBut stretch out Your hand now, and\ntouch his bone and his flesh, and he will\nsurely curse You to Your face!\"\nThen Job arose, tore his robe, and\nshaved his head; and he fell to the\nground and worshiped.\nAnd he said: \"Naked I came from my\nmother's womb, And naked shall I return\nthere. The LORD gave, and the LORD\nhas taken away; Blessed be the name\nof the LORD.\"\nIn all this Job did not sin nor charge\nGod with wrong.\n2Again there was a day when the sons\nof God came to present themselves\nbefore the LORD, and Satan came also\namong them to present himself before\nthe LORD.\nAnd the LORD said to Satan, \"Behold,\nhe is in your hand, but spare his life.\"\nSo Satan went out from the presence of\nthe LORD, and struck Job with painful\nboils from the sole of his foot to the\ncrown of his head.\nAnd he took for himself a potsherd with\nwhich to scrape himself while he sat in\nthe midst of the ashes.\nThen his wife said to him, \"Do you still\nhold fast to your integrity? Curse God\nand die!\"\nBut he said to her, \"You speak as one\nof the foolish women speaks.

He multiplies words without\nknowledge.\"\nIf they obey and serve Him, They shall\nspend their days in prosperity, And their\nyears in pleasures.\n36Elihu also proceeded and said:\n\"Bear with me a little, and I will show\nyou That there are yet words to speak\non God's behalf.\nI will fetch my knowledge from afar;

For a\nlarge ransom would not help you avoid it.\nFor by these He judges the peoples;\nHe gives food in abundance.\nWill your riches, Or all the mighty\nforces, Keep you from distress?\nHe covers His hands with lightning,\nAnd commands it to strike.\nHis thunder declares it, The cattle also,\nconcerning the rising storm.\n37\"At this also my heart trembles,\nDo not desire the night, When people\nare cut off in their place.\nTake heed, do not turn to iniquity, For\nyou have chosen this rather than\naffliction.\n\"Behold, God is exalted by His power;\nWho teaches like Him?\nWho has assigned Him His way, Or\nwho has said, \"You have done wrong'?\n\"Remember to magnify His work, Of\nwhich men have sung.\nEveryone has seen it;

Each one gave him a piece of\nsilver and each a ring of gold.\nNow the LORD blessed the latter days\nof Job more than his beginning; for he\nhad fourteen thousand sheep, six\nthousand camels, one thousand yoke of\noxen, and one thousand female\ndonkeys.\nAnd so it was, after the LORD had\nspoken these words to Job, that the\nLORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, \"My\nwrath is aroused against you and your\ntwo friends, for you have not spoken of\nMe what is right, as My servant Job has.\nNow therefore, take for yourselves\nseven bulls and seven rams, go to My\nservant Job, and offer up for yourselves\na burnt offering; and My servant Job\nshall pray for you.

For her\nworth is far above rubies.\nHer husband is known in the gates,\nWhen he sits among the elders of the\nland.\nThe heart of her husband safely trusts\nher; So he will have no lack of gain.\nShe makes linen garments and sells\nthem, And supplies sashes for the\nmerchants.\nShe does him good and not evil All the\ndays of her life.\nStrength and honor are her clothing;\nShe shall rejoice in time to come.\nShe seeks wool and flax, And willingly\nworks with her hands.\nShe is like the merchant ships, She\nbrings her food from afar.\nShe also rises while it is yet night, And\nprovides food for her household, And a\nportion for her maidservants.\nShe considers a field and buys it;\nFrom her profits she plants a vineyard.\nShe opens her mouth with wisdom,\nAnd on her tongue is the law of\nkindness.\nShe watches over the ways of her\nhousehold, And does not eat the bread\nof idleness.\nHer children rise up and call her\nblessed; Her husband also, and he\npraises her:\n\"Many daughters have done well, But\nyou excel them all.\"\nCharm is deceitful and beauty is\npassing, But a woman who fears the\nLORD, she shall be praised.\nGive her of the fruit of her hands, And\nlet her own works praise her in the gates.\nEcclesiastes\n1The words of the Preacher, the son\nof David, king in Jerusalem.\n\"Vanity of vanities,\" says the Preacher;\n\"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.\"\nWhat profit has a man from all his labor\nIn which he toils under the sun?\nOne generation passes away, and\nanother generation comes; But the earth\nabides forever.\nThe sun also rises, and the sun goes\ndown, And hastens to the place where it\narose.\nThe wind goes toward the south, And\nturns around to the north; The wind\nwhirls about continually, And comes\nagain on its circuit.\nThere is no remembrance of former\nthings, Nor will there be any\nremembrance of things that are to come\nBy those who will come after.\nI, the Preacher, was king over Israel in\nJerusalem.\nAnd I set my heart to seek and search\nout by wisdom concerning all that is\ndone under heaven; this burdensome\ntask God has given to the sons of man,\nby which they may be exercised.\nI have seen all the works that are done\nunder the sun; and indeed, all is vanity\nand grasping for the wind.\nWhat is crooked cannot be made\nstraight, And what is lacking cannot be\nnumbered.\nAll the rivers run into the sea, Yet the\nsea is not full; To the place from which\nthe rivers come, There they return again.\nI communed with my heart, saying,\n\"Look, I have attained greatness, and\nhave gained more wisdom than all who\nwere before me in Jerusalem. My heart\nhas understood great wisdom and\nknowledge.\"\nAll things are full of labor; Man cannot\nexpress it. The eye is not satisfied with\nseeing, Nor the ear filled with hearing.\nThat which has been is what will be,\nThat which is done is what will be done,\nAnd there is nothing new under the sun.\nIs there anything of which it may be\nsaid, \"See, this is new\"? It has already\nbeen in ancient times before us.\nAnd I set my heart to know wisdom\nand to know madness and folly. I\nperceived that this also is grasping for\nthe wind.\nFor in much wisdom is much grief, And\nhe who increases knowledge increases\nsorrow.\n2I said in my heart, \"Come now, I will\ntest you with mirth; therefore enjoy\npleasure\"; but surely, this also was\nvanity.\nI said of laughter--\"Madness!\"; and of\nmirth, \"What does it accomplish?\"\nI searched in my heart how to gratify\nmy flesh with wine, while guiding my\nheart with wisdom, and how to lay hold\non folly, till I might see what was good\nfor the sons of men to do under heaven\nall the days of their lives.\nI made my works great, I built myself\nhouses, and planted myself vineyards.\nI made myself gardens and orchards,\nand I planted all kinds of fruit trees in\nthem.\nI made myself water pools from which\nto water the growing trees of the grove.\nI acquired male and female servants,\nand had servants born in my house. Yes,\nI had greater possessions of herds and\nflocks than all who were in Jerusalem\nbefore me.\nI also gathered for myself silver and\ngold and the special treasures of kings\nand of the provinces. I acquired male\nand female singers, the delights of the\nsons of men, and musical instruments of\nall kinds.\nSo I became great and excelled more\nthan all who were before me in\nJerusalem. Also my wisdom remained\nwith me.\nWhatever my eyes desired I did not\nkeep from them. I did not withhold my\nheart from any pleasure, For my heart\nrejoiced in all my labor; And this was my\nreward from all my labor.\nThen I looked on all the works that my\nhands had done And on the labor in\nwhich I had toiled; And indeed all was\nvanity and grasping for the wind. There\nwas no profit under the sun.\nThen I turned myself to consider\nwisdom and madness and folly; For\nwhat can the man do who succeeds the\nking?-- Only what he has already done.\nThen I saw that wisdom excels folly As\nlight excels darkness.\nThe wise man's eyes are in his head,\nBut the fool walks in darkness. Yet I\nmyself perceived That the same event\nhappens to them all.\nSo I said in my heart, \"As it happens to\nthe fool, It also happens to me, And why\nwas I then more wise?\" Then I said in\nmy heart, \"This also is vanity.\"\nFor there is no more remembrance of\nthe wise than of the fool forever, Since\nall that now is will be forgotten in the\ndays to come. And how does a wise\nman die? As the fool!\nTherefore I hated life because the\nwork that was done under the sun was\ndistressing to me, for all is vanity and\ngrasping for the wind.\nThen I hated all my labor in which I\nhad toiled under the sun, because I\nmust leave it to the man who will come\nafter me.\nAnd who knows whether he will be\nwise or a fool? Yet he will rule over all\nmy labor in which I toiled and in which I\nhave shown myself wise under the sun.\nThis also is vanity.\nTherefore I turned my heart and\ndespaired of all the labor in which I had\ntoiled under the sun.\nFor there is a man whose labor is with\nwisdom, knowledge, and skill; yet he\nmust leave his heritage to a man who\nhas not labored for it. This also is vanity\nand a great evil.\nFor what has man for all his labor, and\nfor the striving of his heart with which he\nhas toiled under the sun?\nFor all his days are sorrowful, and his\nwork burdensome; even in the night his\nheart takes no rest. This also is vanity.\nNothing is better for a man than that\nhe should eat and drink, and that his\nsoul should enjoy good in his labor. This\nalso, I saw, was from the hand of God.\nFor who can eat, or who can have\nenjoyment, more than I?\n3To everything there is a season, A\ntime for every purpose under heaven:\nA time to be born, And a time to die; A\ntime to plant, And a time to pluck what is\nplanted;\nA time to kill, And a time to heal; A time\nto break down, And a time to build up;\nA time to weep, And a time to laugh; A\ntime to mourn, And a time to dance;\nA time to cast away stones, And a time\nto gather stones; A time to embrace,\nAnd a time to refrain from embracing;\nA time to gain, And a time to lose; A\ntime to keep, And a time to throw away;\nA time to tear, And a time to sew; A\ntime to keep silence, And a time to\nspeak;\nA time to love, And a time to hate; A\ntime of war, And a time of peace.\nWhat profit has the worker from that in\nwhich he labors?\nI have seen the God-given task with\nwhich the sons of men are to be\noccupied.\nFor God gives wisdom and knowledge\nand joy to a man who is good in His\nsight; but to the sinner He gives the\nwork of gathering and collecting, that he\nmay give to him who is good before God.\nThis also is vanity and grasping for the\nwind.\nHe has made everything beautiful in its\ntime. Also He has put eternity in their\nhearts, except that no one can find out\nthe work that God does from beginning\nto end.\nI know that nothing is better for them\nthan to rejoice, and to do good in their\nlives,\nWho knows the spirit of the sons of\nmen, which goes upward, and the spirit\nof the animal, which goes down to the\nearth?\nand also that every man should eat\nand drink and enjoy the good of all his\nlabor--it is the gift of God.\nI know that whatever God does, It shall\nbe forever. Nothing can be added to it,\nAnd nothing taken from it. God does it,\nthat men should fear before Him.\nThat which is has already been, And\nwhat is to be has already been; And\nGod requires an account of what is past.\nMoreover I saw under the sun: In the\nplace of judgment, Wickedness was\nthere; And in the place of righteousness,\nIniquity was there.\nSo I perceived that nothing is better\nthan that a man should rejoice in his\nown works, for that is his heritage. For\nwho can bring him to see what will\nhappen after him?\n4Then I returned and considered all\nthe oppression that is done under the\nsun: And look! The tears of the\noppressed, But they have no comforter-On the side of their oppressors there is\npower, But they have no comforter.\nTherefore I praised the dead who were\nalready dead, More than the living who\nare still alive.\nI said in my heart, \"God shall judge the\nrighteous and the wicked, For there is a\ntime there for every purpose and for\nevery work.\"\nYet, better than both is he who has\nnever existed, Who has not seen the\nevil work that is done under the sun.\nI said in my heart, \"Concerning the\ncondition of the sons of men, God tests\nthem, that they may see that they\nthemselves are like animals.\"\nAgain, I saw that for all toil and every\nskillful work a man is envied by his\nneighbor. This also is vanity and\ngrasping for the wind.\nFor what happens to the sons of men\nalso happens to animals; one thing\nbefalls them: as one dies, so dies the\nother. Surely, they all have one breath;\nman has no advantage over animals, for\nall is vanity.\nAll go to one place: all are from the\ndust, and all return to dust.\nThe fool folds his hands And consumes\nhis own flesh.\nBetter a handful with quietness Than\nboth hands full, together with toil and\ngrasping for the wind.\nThen I returned, and I saw vanity under\nthe sun:\nThere is one alone, without companion:\nHe has neither son nor brother. Yet\nthere is no end to all his labors, Nor is\nhis eye satisfied with riches. But he\nnever asks, \"For whom do I toil and\ndeprive myself of good?\" This also is\nvanity and a grave misfortune.\nTwo are better than one, Because they\nhave a good reward for their labor.\nFor if they fall, one will lift up his\ncompanion. But woe to him who is alone\nwhen he falls, For he has no one to help\nhim up.\nAgain, if two lie down together, they\nwill keep warm; But how can one be\nwarm alone?\nThough one may be overpowered by\nanother, two can withstand him. And a\nthreefold cord is not quickly broken.\nBetter a poor and wise youth Than an\nold and foolish king who will be\nadmonished no more.\nFor he comes out of prison to be king,\nAlthough he was born poor in his\nkingdom.\nI saw all the living who walk under the\nsun; They were with the second youth\nwho stands in his place.\nThere was no end of all the people\nover whom he was made king; Yet\nthose who come afterward will not\nrejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity\nand grasping for the wind.\n5Walk prudently when you go to the\nhouse of God; and draw near to hear\nrather than to give the sacrifice of fools,\nfor they do not know that they do evil.\nDo not be rash with your mouth, And let\nnot your heart utter anything hastily\nbefore God. For God is in heaven, and\nyou on earth; Therefore let your words\nbe few.\nFor a dream comes through much\nactivity, And a fool's voice is known by\nhis many words.\nWhen you make a vow to God, do not\ndelay to pay it; For He has no pleasure\nin fools. Pay what you have vowed-5\nBetter not to vow than to vow and not\npay.\nDo not let your mouth cause your flesh\nto sin, nor say before the messenger of\nGod that it was an error. Why should\nGod be angry at your excuse and\ndestroy the work of your hands?\nFor in the multitude of dreams and\nmany words there is also vanity. But\nfear God.\nIf you see the oppression of the poor,\nand the violent perversion of justice and\nrighteousness in a province, do not\nmarvel at the matter; for high official\nwatches over high official, and higher\nofficials are over them.\nMoreover the profit of the land is for all;\neven the king is served from the field.\nHe who loves silver will not be\nsatisfied with silver; Nor he who loves\nabundance, with increase. This also is\nvanity.\nWhen goods increase, They increase\nwho eat them; So what profit have the\nowners Except to see them with their\neyes?\nof his life which God gives him; for it is\nhis heritage.\nAs for every man to whom God has\ngiven riches and wealth, and given him\npower to eat of it, to receive his heritage\nand rejoice in his labor--this is the gift of\nGod.\nThe sleep of a laboring man is sweet,\nWhether he eats little or much; But the\nabundance of the rich will not permit him\nto sleep.\nThere is a severe evil which I have\nseen under the sun: Riches kept for\ntheir owner to his hurt.\nBut those riches perish through\nmisfortune; When he begets a son,\nthere is nothing in his hand.\nAs he came from his mother's womb,\nnaked shall he return, To go as he\ncame; And he shall take nothing from\nhis labor Which he may carry away in\nhis hand.\nAnd this also is a severe evil-- Just\nexactly as he came, so shall he go. And\nwhat profit has he who has labored for\nthe wind?\nAll his days he also eats in darkness,\nAnd he has much sorrow and sickness\nand anger.\nHere is what I have seen: It is good\nand fitting for one to eat and drink, and\nto enjoy the good of all his labor in\nwhich he toils under the sun all the days\nFor he will not dwell unduly on the\ndays of his life, because God keeps him\nbusy with the joy of his heart.\n6There is an evil which I have seen\nunder the sun, and it is common among\nmen:\nA man to whom God has given riches\nand wealth and honor, so that he lacks\nnothing for himself of all he desires; yet\nGod does not give him power to eat of it,\nbut a foreigner consumes it. This is\nvanity, and it is an evil affliction.\nIf a man begets a hundred children and\nlives many years, so that the days of his\nyears are many, but his soul is not\nsatisfied with goodness, or indeed he\nhas no burial, I say that a stillborn child\nis better than he-4\nfor it comes in vanity and departs in\ndarkness, and its name is covered with\ndarkness.\nThough it has not seen the sun or\nknown anything, this has more rest than\nthat man,\neven if he lives a thousand years twice-but has not seen goodness. Do not all\ngo to one place?\nAll the labor of man is for his mouth,\nAnd yet the soul is not satisfied.\nIt is better to hear the rebuke of the\nwise Than for a man to hear the song of\nfools.\nFor what more has the wise man than\nthe fool? What does the poor man have,\nWho knows how to walk before the\nliving?\nFor like the crackling of thorns under a\npot, So is the laughter of the fool. This\nalso is vanity.\nBetter is the sight of the eyes than the\nwandering of desire. This also is vanity\nand grasping for the wind.\nSurely oppression destroys a wise\nman's reason, And a bribe debases the\nheart.\nWhatever one is, he has been named\nalready, For it is known that he is man;\nAnd he cannot contend with Him who is\nmightier than he.\nThe end of a thing is better than its\nbeginning; The patient in spirit is better\nthan the proud in spirit.\nSince there are many things that\nincrease vanity, How is man the better?\nDo not hasten in your spirit to be angry,\nFor anger rests in the bosom of fools.\nFor who knows what is good for man\nin life, all the days of his vain life which\nhe passes like a shadow? Who can tell\na man what will happen after him under\nthe sun?\n7A good name is better than precious\nDo not say, \"Why were the former\ndays better than these?\" For you do not\ninquire wisely concerning this.\nWisdom is good with an inheritance,\nAnd profitable to those who see the sun.\nointment, And the day of death than the\nday of one's birth;\nFor wisdom is a defense as money is\na defense, But the excellence of\nknowledge is that wisdom gives life to\nthose who have it.\nBetter to go to the house of mourning\nThan to go to the house of feasting, For\nthat is the end of all men; And the living\nwill take it to heart.\nSorrow is better than laughter, For by a\nsad countenance the heart is made\nbetter.\nConsider the work of God; For who\ncan make straight what He has made\ncrooked?\nIn the day of prosperity be joyful, But\nin the day of adversity consider: Surely\nGod has appointed the one as well as\nthe other, So that man can find out\nnothing that will come after him.\nThe heart of the wise is in the house of\nmourning, But the heart of fools is in the\nhouse of mirth.\nI have seen everything in my days of\nvanity: There is a just man who perishes\nin his righteousness, And there is a\nwicked man who prolongs life in his\nwickedness.\nDo not be overly righteous, Nor be\noverly wise: Why should you destroy\nyourself?\nDo not be overly wicked, Nor be\nfoolish: Why should you die before your\ntime?\nIt is good that you grasp this, And also\nnot remove your hand from the other;\nFor he who fears God will escape them\nall.\nWisdom strengthens the wise More\nthan ten rulers of the city.\nAnd I find more bitter than death The\nwoman whose heart is snares and nets,\nWhose hands are fetters. He who\npleases God shall escape from her, But\nthe sinner shall be trapped by her.\n\"Here is what I have found,\" says the\nPreacher, \"Adding one thing to the other\nto find out the reason,\nWhich my soul still seeks but I cannot\nfind: One man among a thousand I have\nfound, But a woman among all these I\nhave not found.\nTruly, this only I have found: That God\nmade man upright, But they have\nsought out many schemes.\"\n8Who is like a wise man? And who\nknows the interpretation of a thing? A\nman's wisdom makes his face shine,\nAnd the sternness of his face is\nchanged.\nFor there is not a just man on earth\nwho does good And does not sin.\nAlso do not take to heart everything\npeople say, Lest you hear your servant\ncursing you.\nFor many times, also, your own heart\nhas known That even you have cursed\nothers.\nI say, \"Keep the king's commandment\nfor the sake of your oath to God.\nAll this I have proved by wisdom. I said,\n\"I will be wise\"; But it was far from me.\nDo not be hasty to go from his\npresence. Do not take your stand for an\nevil thing, for he does whatever pleases\nhim.\"\nAs for that which is far off and\nexceedingly deep, Who can find it out?\nWhere the word of a king is, there is\npower; And who may say to him, \"What\nare you doing?\"\nI applied my heart to know, To search\nand seek out wisdom and the reason of\nthings, To know the wickedness of folly,\nEven of foolishness and madness.\nHe who keeps his command will\nexperience nothing harmful; And a wise\nman's heart discerns both time and\njudgment,\nBecause for every matter there is a\ntime and judgment, Though the misery\nof man increases greatly.\nwhom it happens according to the work\nof the righteous. I said that this also is\nvanity.\nFor he does not know what will happen;\nSo who can tell him when it will occur?\nNo one has power over the spirit to\nretain the spirit, And no one has power\nin the day of death. There is no release\nfrom that war, And wickedness will not\ndeliver those who are given to it.\nAll this I have seen, and applied my\nheart to every work that is done under\nthe sun: There is a time in which one\nman rules over another to his own hurt.\nThen I saw the wicked buried, who\nhad come and gone from the place of\nholiness, and they were forgotten in the\ncity where they had so done. This also\nis vanity.\nBecause the sentence against an evil\nwork is not executed speedily, therefore\nthe heart of the sons of men is fully set\nin them to do evil.\nThough a sinner does evil a hundred\ntimes, and his days are prolonged, yet I\nsurely know that it will be well with those\nwho fear God, who fear before Him.\nBut it will not be well with the wicked;\nnor will he prolong his days, which are\nas a shadow, because he does not fear\nbefore God.\nSo I commended enjoyment, because\na man has nothing better under the sun\nthan to eat, drink, and be merry; for this\nwill remain with him in his labor all the\ndays of his life which God gives him\nunder the sun.\nWhen I applied my heart to know\nwisdom and to see the business that is\ndone on earth, even though one sees no\nsleep day or night,\nthen I saw all the work of God, that a\nman cannot find out the work that is\ndone under the sun. For though a man\nlabors to discover it, yet he will not find\nit; moreover, though a wise man\nattempts to know it, he will not be able\nto find it.\n9For I considered all this in my heart,\nso that I could declare it all: that the\nrighteous and the wise and their works\nare in the hand of God. People know\nneither love nor hatred by anything they\nsee before them.\nAll things come alike to all: One event\nhappens to the righteous and the\nwicked; To the good, the clean, and the\nunclean; To him who sacrifices and him\nwho does not sacrifice. As is the good,\nso is the sinner; He who takes an oath\nas he who fears an oath.\nThere is a vanity which occurs on\nearth, that there are just men to whom it\nhappens according to the work of the\nwicked; again, there are wicked men to\nThis is an evil in all that is done under\nthe sun: that one thing happens to all.\nTruly the hearts of the sons of men are\nfull of evil; madness is in their hearts\nwhile they live, and after that they go to\nthe dead.\nBut for him who is joined to all the living\nthere is hope, for a living dog is better\nthan a dead lion.\nFor man also does not know his time:\nLike fish taken in a cruel net, Like birds\ncaught in a snare, So the sons of men\nare snared in an evil time, When it falls\nsuddenly upon them.\nThis wisdom I have also seen under\nthe sun, and it seemed great to me:\nFor the living know that they will die;\nBut the dead know nothing, And they\nhave no more reward, For the memory\nof them is forgotten.\nThere was a little city with few men in\nit; and a great king came against it,\nbesieged it, and built great snares\naround it.\nAlso their love, their hatred, and their\nenvy have now perished; Nevermore will\nthey have a share In anything done\nunder the sun.\nNow there was found in it a poor wise\nman, and he by his wisdom delivered\nthe city. Yet no one remembered that\nsame poor man.\nGo, eat your bread with joy, And drink\nyour wine with a merry heart; For God\nhas already accepted your works.\nLet your garments always be white,\nAnd let your head lack no oil.\nLive joyfully with the wife whom you\nlove all the days of your vain life which\nHe has given you under the sun, all your\ndays of vanity; for that is your portion in\nlife, and in the labor which you perform\nunder the sun.\nWhatever your hand finds to do, do it\nwith your might; for there is no work or\ndevice or knowledge or wisdom in the\ngrave where you are going.\nI returned and saw under the sun that- The race is not to the swift, Nor the\nbattle to the strong, Nor bread to the\nwise,\nNor\nriches\nto\nmen\nof\nunderstanding, Nor favor to men of skill;\nBut time and chance happen to them all.\nThen I said: \"Wisdom is better than\nstrength. Nevertheless the poor man's\nwisdom is despised, And his words are\nnot heard.\nWords of the wise, spoken quietly,\nshould be heard Rather than the shout\nof a ruler of fools.\nWisdom is better than weapons of war;\nBut one sinner destroys much good.\"\n10Dead flies putrefy the perfumer's\nointment, And cause it to give off a foul\nodor; So does a little folly to one\nrespected for wisdom and honor.\nA wise man's heart is at his right hand,\nBut a fool's heart at his left.\nEven when a fool walks along the way,\nHe lacks wisdom, And he shows\neveryone that he is a fool.\nIf the spirit of the ruler rises against you,\nDo not leave your post; For conciliation\npacifies great offenses.\nThe labor of fools wearies them, For\nthey do not even know how to go to the\ncity!\nThere is an evil I have seen under the\nsun, As an error proceeding from the\nruler:\nWoe to you, O land, when your king is\na child, And your princes feast in the\nmorning!\nFolly is set in great dignity, While the\nrich sit in a lowly place.\nI have seen servants on horses, While\nprinces walk on the ground like servants.\nHe who digs a pit will fall into it, And\nwhoever breaks through a wall will be\nbitten by a serpent.\nHe who quarries stones may be hurt by\nthem, And he who splits wood may be\nendangered by it.\nIf the ax is dull, And one does not\nsharpen the edge, Then he must use\nmore strength; But wisdom brings\nsuccess.\nA serpent may bite when it is not\ncharmed; The babbler is no different.\nThe words of a wise man's mouth are\ngracious, But the lips of a fool shall\nswallow him up;\nThe words of his mouth begin with\nfoolishness, And the end of his talk is\nraving madness.\nA fool also multiplies words. No man\nknows what is to be; Who can tell him\nwhat will be after him?\nBlessed are you, O land, when your\nking is the son of nobles, And your\nprinces feast at the proper time-- For\nstrength and not for drunkenness!\nBecause of laziness the building\ndecays, And through idleness of hands\nthe house leaks.\nA feast is made for laughter, And wine\nmakes merry; But money answers\neverything.\nDo not curse the king, even in your\nthought; Do not curse the rich, even in\nyour bedroom; For a bird of the air may\ncarry your voice, And a bird in flight may\ntell the matter.\n11Cast your bread upon the waters,\nFor you will find it after many days.\nGive a serving to seven, and also to\neight, For you do not know what evil will\nbe on the earth.\nIf the clouds are full of rain, They empty\nthemselves upon the earth; And if a tree\nfalls to the south or the north, In the\nplace where the tree falls, there it shall\nlie.\nHe who observes the wind will not sow,\nAnd he who regards the clouds will not\nreap.\nWhile the sun and the light, The moon\nand the stars, Are not darkened, And\nthe clouds do not return after the rain;\nAs you do not know what is the way of\nthe wind, Or how the bones grow in the\nwomb of her who is with child, So you\ndo not know the works of God who\nmakes everything.\nIn the day when the keepers of the\nhouse tremble, And the strong men bow\ndown; When the grinders cease\nbecause they are few, And those that\nlook through the windows grow dim;\nIn the morning sow your seed, And in\nthe evening do not withhold your hand;\nFor you do not know which will prosper,\nEither this or that, Or whether both alike\nwill be good.\nWhen the doors are shut in the streets,\nAnd the sound of grinding is low; When\none rises up at the sound of a bird, And\nall the daughters of music are brought\nlow.\nTruly the light is sweet, And it is\npleasant for the eyes to behold the sun;\nBut if a man lives many years And\nrejoices in them all, Yet let him\nremember the days of darkness, For\nthey will be many. All that is coming is\nvanity.\nRejoice, O young man, in your youth,\nAnd let your heart cheer you in the days\nof your youth; Walk in the ways of your\nheart, And in the sight of your eyes; But\nknow that for all these God will bring you\ninto judgment.\nTherefore remove sorrow from your\nheart, And put away evil from your flesh,\nFor childhood and youth are vanity.\nAlso they are afraid of height, And of\nterrors in the way; When the almond\ntree blossoms, The grasshopper is a\nburden, And desire fails. For man goes\nto his eternal home, And the mourners\ngo about the streets.\nRemember your Creator before the\nsilver cord is loosed, Or the golden bowl\nis broken, Or the pitcher shattered at the\nfountain, Or the wheel broken at the well.\nThen the dust will return to the earth as\nit was, And the spirit will return to God\nwho gave it.\n\"Vanity of vanities,\" says the Preacher,\n\"All is vanity.\"\n12Remember now your Creator in\nthe days of your youth, Before the\ndifficult days come, And the years draw\nnear when you say, \"I have no pleasure\nin them\":\nAnd moreover, because the Preacher\nwas wise, he still taught the people\nknowledge; yes, he pondered and\nsought out and set in order many\nproverbs.\nThe\nPreacher\nsought\nto\nfind\nacceptable words; and what was written\nwas upright--words of truth.\nis no end, and much study is wearisome\nto the flesh.\nThe words of the wise are like goads,\nand the words of scholars are like welldriven nails, given by one Shepherd.\nLet us hear the conclusion of the\nwhole matter: Fear God and keep His\ncommandments, For this is man's all.\nAnd further, my son, be admonished\nby these.

And you\nshall also read them in the hearing of all\nJudah who come from their cities.\nThen Baruch read from the book the\nwords of Jeremiah in the house of the\nLORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the\nson of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper\ncourt at the entry of the New Gate of the\nLORD's house, in the hearing of all the\npeople.\nWhen Michaiah the son of Gemariah,\nthe son of Shaphan, heard all the words\nof the LORD from the book,\nhe then went down to the king's house,\ninto the scribe's chamber; and there all\nthe princes were sitting--Elishama the\nscribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah,\nElnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah\nthe son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son\nof Hananiah, and all the princes.\nThen Michaiah declared to them all the\nwords that he had heard when Baruch\nread the book in the hearing of the\npeople.\nIt may be that they will present their\nsupplication before the LORD, and\neveryone will turn from his evil way. For\ngreat is the anger and the fury that the\nLORD has pronounced against this\npeople.\"\nAnd Baruch the son of Neriah did\naccording to all that Jeremiah the\nprophet commanded him, reading from\nthe book the words of the LORD in the\nLORD's house.\nTherefore all the princes sent Jehudi\nthe son of Nethaniah, the son of\nShelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch,\nsaying, \"Take in your hand the scroll\nfrom which you have read in the hearing\nof the people, and come.\" So Baruch the\nson of Neriah took the scroll in his hand\nand came to them.\nAnd they said to him, \"Sit down now,\nand read it in our hearing.\" So Baruch\nread it in their hearing.\nNow it came to pass in the fifth year of\nJehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of\nJudah, in the ninth month, that they\nproclaimed a fast before the LORD to all\nthe people in Jerusalem, and to all the\npeople who came from the cities of\nJudah to Jerusalem.\nNow it happened, when they had\nheard all the words, that they looked in\nfear from one to another, and said to\nBaruch, \"We will surely tell the king of all\nthese words.\"\nAnd they asked Baruch, saying, \"Tell\nus now, how did you write all these\nwords--at his instruction?\"\nthe scroll; but he would not listen to\nthem.\nSo Baruch answered them, \"He\nproclaimed with his mouth all these\nwords to me, and I wrote them with ink\nin the book.\"\nAnd the king commanded Jerahmeel\nthe king's son, Seraiah the son of Azriel,\nand Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to\nseize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah\nthe prophet, but the LORD hid them.\nThen the princes said to Baruch, \"Go\nand hide, you and Jeremiah; and let no\none know where you are.\"\nAnd they went to the king, into the\ncourt; but they stored the scroll in the\nchamber of Elishama the scribe, and\ntold all the words in the hearing of the\nking.\nNow after the king had burned the\nscroll with the words which Baruch had\nwritten at the instruction of Jeremiah,\nthe word of the LORD came to Jeremiah,\nsaying:\n\"Take yet another scroll, and write on it\nall the former words that were in the first\nscroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah\nhas burned.\nSo the king sent Jehudi to bring the\nscroll, and he took it from Elishama the\nscribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in\nthe hearing of the king and in the\nhearing of all the princes who stood\nbeside the king.\nNow the king was sitting in the winter\nhouse in the ninth month, with a fire\nburning on the hearth before him.\nAnd it happened, when Jehudi had\nread three or four columns, that the king\ncut it with the scribe's knife and cast it\ninto the fire that was on the hearth, until\nall the scroll was consumed in the fire\nthat was on the hearth.\nYet they were not afraid, nor did they\ntear their garments, the king nor any of\nhis servants who heard all these words.\nNevertheless Elnathan, Delaiah, and\nGemariah implored the king not to burn\nAnd you shall say to Jehoiakim king of\nJudah, \"Thus says the LORD: \"You\nhave burned this scroll, saying, \"Why\nhave you written in it that the king of\nBabylon will certainly come and destroy\nthis land, and cause man and beast to\ncease from here?\"'\nTherefore thus says the LORD\nconcerning Jehoiakim king of Judah:\n\"He shall have no one to sit on the\nthrone of David, and his dead body shall\nbe cast out to the heat of the day and\nthe frost of the night.\nI will punish him, his family, and his\nservants for their iniquity; and I will bring\non them, on the inhabitants of\nJerusalem, and on the men of Judah all\nthe doom that I have pronounced\nagainst them; but they did not heed.\"\"'\nThen Jeremiah took another scroll and\ngave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of\nNeriah, who wrote on it at the instruction\nof Jeremiah all the words of the book\nwhich Jehoiakim king of Judah had\nburned in the fire. And besides, there\nwere added to them many similar words.\ncome up to help you will return to Egypt,\nto their own land.\nAnd the Chaldeans shall come back\nand fight against this city, and take it\nand burn it with fire.\"'\n37Now King Zedekiah the son of\nJosiah reigned instead of Coniah the\nson\nof\nJehoiakim,\nwhom\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made\nking in the land of Judah.\nBut neither he nor his servants nor the\npeople of the land gave heed to the\nwords of the LORD which He spoke by\nthe prophet Jeremiah.\nAnd Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the\nson of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the\nson of Maaseiah, the priest, to the\nprophet Jeremiah, saying, \"Pray now to\nthe LORD our God for us.\"\nThus says the LORD: \"Do not deceive\nyourselves, saying, \"The Chaldeans will\nsurely depart from us,\" for they will not\ndepart.\nFor though you had defeated the\nwhole army of the Chaldeans who fight\nagainst you, and there remained only\nwounded men among them, they would\nrise up, every man in his tent, and burn\nthe city with fire.\"'\nAnd it happened, when the army of the\nChaldeans left the siege of Jerusalem\nfor fear of Pharaoh's army,\nthat Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to\ngo into the land of Benjamin to claim his\nproperty there among the people.\nNow Jeremiah was coming and going\namong the people, for they had not yet\nput him in prison.\nThen Pharaoh's army came up from\nEgypt; and when the Chaldeans who\nwere besieging Jerusalem heard news\nof them, they departed from Jerusalem.\nThen the word of the LORD came to\nthe prophet Jeremiah, saying,\nAnd when he was in the Gate of\nBenjamin, a captain of the guard was\nthere whose name was Irijah the son of\nShelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he\nseized Jeremiah the prophet, saying,\n\"You are defecting to the Chaldeans!\"\nThen Jeremiah said, \"False! I am not\ndefecting to the Chaldeans.\" But he did\nnot listen to him. So Irijah seized\nJeremiah and brought him to the princes.\n\"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel,\n\"Thus you shall say to the king of Judah,\nwho sent you to Me to inquire of Me:\n\"Behold, Pharaoh's army which has\nTherefore the princes were angry with\nJeremiah, and they struck him and put\nhim in prison in the house of Jonathan\nthe scribe. For they had made that the\nprison.\nWhen Jeremiah entered the dungeon\nand the cells, and Jeremiah had\nremained there many days,\nthen Zedekiah the king sent and took\nhim out. The king asked him secretly in\nhis house, and said, \"Is there any word\nfrom the LORD?\" And Jeremiah said,\n\"There is.\" Then he said, \"You shall be\ndelivered into the hand of the king of\nBabylon!\"\nJucal the son of Shelemiah, and\nPashhur the son of Malchiah heard the\nwords that Jeremiah had spoken to all\nthe people, saying,\n\"Thus says the LORD: \"He who\nremains in this city shall die by the\nsword, by famine, and by pestilence; but\nhe who goes over to the Chaldeans\nshall live; his life shall be as a prize to\nhim, and he shall live.'\nThus says the LORD: \"This city shall\nsurely be given into the hand of the king\nof Babylon's army, which shall take it.\"'\nMoreover Jeremiah said to King\nZedekiah, \"What offense have I\ncommitted against you, against your\nservants, or against this people, that you\nhave put me in prison?\nWhere now are your prophets who\nprophesied to you, saying, \"The king of\nBabylon will not come against you or\nagainst this land'?\nTherefore please hear now, O my lord\nthe king. Please, let my petition be\naccepted before you, and do not make\nme return to the house of Jonathan the\nscribe, lest I die there.\"\nThen Zedekiah the king commanded\nthat they should commit Jeremiah to the\ncourt of the prison, and that they should\ngive him daily a piece of bread from the\nbakers' street, until all the bread in the\ncity was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained\nin the court of the prison.\n38Now Shephatiah the son of\nMattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur,\nTherefore the princes said to the king,\n\"Please, let this man be put to death, for\nthus he weakens the hands of the men\nof war who remain in this city, and the\nhands of all the people, by speaking\nsuch words to them. For this man does\nnot seek the welfare of this people, but\ntheir harm.\"\nThen Zedekiah the king said, \"Look, he\nis in your hand. For the king can do\nnothing against you.\"\nSo they took Jeremiah and cast him\ninto the dungeon of Malchiah the king's\nson, which was in the court of the prison,\nand they let Jeremiah down with ropes.\nAnd in the dungeon there was no water,\nbut mire. So Jeremiah sank in the mire.\nNow Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, one of\nthe eunuchs, who was in the king's\nhouse, heard that they had put Jeremiah\nin the dungeon. When the king was\nsitting at the Gate of Benjamin,\nEbed-Melech went out of the king's\nhouse and spoke to the king, saying:\nme to death? And if I give you advice,\nyou will not listen to me.\"\n\"My lord the king, these men have done\nevil in all that they have done to\nJeremiah the prophet, whom they have\ncast into the dungeon, and he is likely to\ndie from hunger in the place where he is.\nFor there is no more bread in the city.\"\nSo Zedekiah the king swore secretly to\nJeremiah, saying, \"As the LORD lives,\nwho made our very souls, I will not put\nyou to death, nor will I give you into the\nhand of these men who seek your life.\"\nThen the king commanded EbedMelech the Ethiopian, saying, \"Take\nfrom here thirty men with you, and lift\nJeremiah the prophet out of the\ndungeon before he dies.\"\nThen Jeremiah said to Zedekiah,\n\"Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts,\nthe God of Israel: \"If you surely\nsurrender to the king of Babylon's\nprinces, then your soul shall live; this\ncity shall not be burned with fire, and\nyou and your house shall live.\nSo Ebed-Melech took the men with\nhim and went into the house of the king\nunder the treasury, and took from there\nold clothes and old rags, and let them\ndown by ropes into the dungeon to\nJeremiah.\nBut if you do not surrender to the king\nof Babylon's princes, then this city shall\nbe given into the hand of the Chaldeans;\nthey shall burn it with fire, and you shall\nnot escape from their hand.\"'\nThen Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian said\nto Jeremiah, \"Please put these old\nclothes and rags under your armpits,\nunder the ropes.\" And Jeremiah did so.\nAnd Zedekiah the king said to\nJeremiah, \"I am afraid of the Jews who\nhave defected to the Chaldeans, lest\nthey deliver me into their hand, and they\nabuse me.\"\nSo they pulled Jeremiah up with ropes\nand lifted him out of the dungeon. And\nJeremiah remained in the court of the\nprison.\nThen Zedekiah the king sent and had\nJeremiah the prophet brought to him at\nthe third entrance of the house of the\nLORD. And the king said to Jeremiah, \"I\nwill ask you something. Hide nothing\nfrom me.\"\nJeremiah said to Zedekiah, \"If I\ndeclare it to you, will you not surely put\nBut Jeremiah said, \"They shall not\ndeliver you. Please, obey the voice of\nthe LORD which I speak to you. So it\nshall be well with you, and your soul\nshall live.\nBut if you refuse to surrender, this is\nthe word that the LORD has shown me:\n\"Now behold, all the women who are\nleft in the king of Judah's house shall be\nsurrendered to the king of Babylon's\nprinces, and those women shall say:\n\"Your close friends have set upon you\nAnd prevailed against you; Your feet\nhave sunk in the mire, And they have\nturned away again.\"\nhis army came against Jerusalem, and\nbesieged it.\n\"So they shall surrender all your wives\nand children to the Chaldeans. You shall\nnot escape from their hand, but shall be\ntaken by the hand of the king of Babylon.\nAnd you shall cause this city to be\nburned with fire.\"'\nThen Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, \"Let\nno one know of these words, and you\nshall not die.\nIn the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the\nfourth month, on the ninth day of the\nmonth, the city was penetrated.\nThen all the princes of the king of\nBabylon came in and sat in the Middle\nGate: Nergal-Sharezer, Samgar-Nebo,\nSarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sarezer,\nRabmag, with the rest of the princes of\nthe king of Babylon.\nBut if the princes hear that I have\ntalked with you, and they come to you\nand say to you, \"Declare to us now what\nyou have said to the king, and also what\nthe king said to you; do not hide it from\nus, and we will not put you to death,'\nSo it was, when Zedekiah the king of\nJudah and all the men of war saw them,\nthat they fled and went out of the city by\nnight, by way of the king's garden, by\nthe gate between the two walls. And he\nwent out by way of the plain.\nthen you shall say to them, \"I\npresented my request before the king,\nthat he would not make me return to\nJonathan's house to die there.\"'\nThen all the princes came to Jeremiah\nand asked him. And he told them\naccording to all these words that the\nking had commanded. So they stopped\nspeaking with him, for the conversation\nhad not been heard.\nNow Jeremiah remained in the court of\nthe prison until the day that Jerusalem\nwas taken. And he was there when\nJerusalem was taken.\nBut the Chaldean army pursued them\nand overtook Zedekiah in the plains of\nJericho. And when they had captured\nhim, they brought him up to\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to\nRiblah in the land of Hamath, where he\npronounced judgment on him.\nThen the king of Babylon killed the\nsons of Zedekiah before his eyes in\nRiblah; the king of Babylon also killed all\nthe nobles of Judah.\nMoreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes,\nand bound him with bronze fetters to\ncarry him off to Babylon.\n39In the ninth year of Zedekiah king\nof Judah, in the tenth month,\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all\nAnd the Chaldeans burned the king's\nhouse and the houses of the people with\nfire, and broke down the walls of\nJerusalem.\nThen Nebuzaradan the captain of the\nguard carried away captive to Babylon\nthe remnant of the people who remained\nin the city and those who defected to\nhim, with the rest of the people who\nremained.\nBut Nebuzaradan the captain of the\nguard left in the land of Judah the poor\npeople, who had nothing, and gave\nthem vineyards and fields at the same\ntime.\nNow Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon\ngave charge concerning Jeremiah to\nNebuzaradan the captain of the guard,\nsaying,\n\"Take him and look after him, and do\nhim no harm; but do to him just as he\nsays to you.\"\nSo Nebuzaradan the captain of the\nguard sent Nebushasban, Rabsaris,\nNergal-Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the\nking of Babylon's chief officers;\nthen they sent someone to take\nJeremiah from the court of the prison,\nand committed him to Gedaliah the son\nof Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he\nshould take him home. So he dwelt\namong the people.\nMeanwhile the word of the LORD had\ncome to Jeremiah while he was shut up\nin the court of the prison, saying,\n\"Go and speak to Ebed-Melech the\nEthiopian, saying, \"Thus says the LORD\nof hosts, the God of Israel: \"Behold, I will\nbring My words upon this city for\nadversity and not for good, and they\nshall be performed in that day before\nyou.\nBut I will deliver you in that day,\" says\nthe LORD, \"and you shall not be given\ninto the hand of the men of whom you\nare afraid.\nFor I will surely deliver you, and you\nshall not fall by the sword; but your life\nshall be as a prize to you, because you\nhave put your trust in Me,\" says the\nLORD.\"'\n40The word that came to Jeremiah\nfrom the LORD after Nebuzaradan the\ncaptain of the guard had let him go from\nRamah, when he had taken him bound\nin chains among all who were carried\naway captive from Jerusalem and Judah,\nwho were carried away captive to\nBabylon.\nAnd the captain of the guard took\nJeremiah and said to him: \"The LORD\nyour God has pronounced this doom on\nthis place.\nNow the LORD has brought it, and has\ndone just as He said. Because you\npeople have sinned against the LORD,\nand not obeyed His voice, therefore this\nthing has come upon you.\nAnd now look, I free you this day from\nthe chains that were on your hand. If it\nseems good to you to come with me to\nBabylon, come, and I will look after you.\nBut if it seems wrong for you to come\nwith me to Babylon, remain here. See,\nall the land is before you; wherever it\nseems good and convenient for you to\ngo, go there.\"\nNow while Jeremiah had not yet gone\nback, Nebuzaradan said, \"Go back to\nGedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of\nShaphan, whom the king of Babylon has\nmade governor over the cities of Judah,\nand dwell with him among the people.\nOr go wherever it seems convenient for\nyou to go.\" So the captain of the guard\ngave him rations and a gift and let him\ngo.\nAs for me, I will indeed dwell at Mizpah\nand serve the Chaldeans who come to\nus. But you, gather wine and summer\nfruit and oil, put them in your vessels,\nand dwell in your cities that you have\ntaken.\"\nLikewise, when all the Jews who were\nin Moab, among the Ammonites, in\nEdom, and who were in all the countries,\nheard that the king of Babylon had left a\nremnant of Judah, and that he had set\nover them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,\nthe son of Shaphan,\nThen Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the\nson of Ahikam, to Mizpah, and dwelt\nwith him among the people who were\nleft in the land.\nAnd when all the captains of the armies\nwho were in the fields, they and their\nmen, heard that the king of Babylon had\nmade Gedaliah the son of Ahikam\ngovernor in the land, and had committed\nto him men, women, children, and the\npoorest of the land who had not been\ncarried away captive to Babylon,\nthen they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah-Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan\nand Jonathan the sons of Kareah,\nSeraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons\nof Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah\nthe son of a Maachathite, they and their\nmen.\nAnd Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the\nson of Shaphan, took an oath before\nthem and their men, saying, \"Do not be\nafraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in\nthe land and serve the king of Babylon,\nand it shall be well with you.\nthen all the Jews returned out of all\nplaces where they had been driven, and\ncame to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah\nat Mizpah, and gathered wine and\nsummer fruit in abundance.\nMoreover Johanan the son of Kareah\nand all the captains of the forces that\nwere in the fields came to Gedaliah at\nMizpah,\nand said to him, \"Do you certainly\nknow that Baalis the king of the\nAmmonites has sent Ishmael the son of\nNethaniah to murder you?\" But Gedaliah\nthe son of Ahikam did not believe them.\nThen Johanan the son of Kareah\nspoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah,\nsaying, \"Let me go, please, and I will kill\nIshmael the son of Nethaniah, and no\none will know it. Why should he murder\nyou, so that all the Jews who are\ngathered to you would be scattered, and\nthe remnant in Judah perish?\"\nBut Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said\nto Johanan the son of Kareah, \"You\nshall not do this thing, for you speak\nfalsely concerning Ishmael.\"\n41Now it came to pass in the\nseventh month that Ishmael the son of\nNethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the\nroyal family and of the officers of the\nking, came with ten men to Gedaliah the\nson of Ahikam, at Mizpah. And there\nthey ate bread together in Mizpah.\nThen Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,\nand the ten men who were with him,\narose and struck Gedaliah the son of\nAhikam, the son of Shaphan, with the\nsword, and killed him whom the king of\nBabylon had made governor over the\nland.\nIshmael also struck down all the Jews\nwho were with him, that is, with\nGedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans\nwho were found there, the men of war.\nAnd it happened, on the second day\nafter he had killed Gedaliah, when as\nyet no one knew it,\nthat certain men came from Shechem,\nfrom Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty\nmen with their beards shaved and their\nclothes torn, having cut themselves, with\nofferings and incense in their hand, to\nbring them to the house of the LORD.\nNow Ishmael the son of Nethaniah\nwent out from Mizpah to meet them,\nweeping as he went along; and it\nhappened as he met them that he said\nto them, \"Come to Gedaliah the son of\nAhikam!\"\nSo it was, when they came into the\nmidst of the city, that Ishmael the son of\nNethaniah killed them and cast them\ninto the midst of a pit, he and the men\nwho were with him.\nBut ten men were found among them\nwho said to Ishmael, \"Do not kill us, for\nwe have treasures of wheat, barley, oil,\nand honey in the field.\" So he desisted\nand did not kill them among their\nbrethren.\nNow the pit into which Ishmael had cast\nall the dead bodies of the men whom he\nhad slain, because of Gedaliah, was the\nsame one Asa the king had made for\nfear of Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael\nthe son of Nethaniah filled it with the\nslain.\nThen Ishmael carried away captive all\nthe rest of the people who were in\nMizpah, the king's daughters and all the\npeople who remained in Mizpah, whom\nNebuzaradan the captain of the guard\nhad committed to Gedaliah the son of\nAhikam. And Ishmael the son of\nNethaniah carried them away captive\nand departed to go over to the\nAmmonites.\nBut when Johanan the son of Kareah\nand all the captains of the forces that\nwere with him heard of all the evil that\nIshmael the son of Nethaniah had done,\nthey took all the men and went to fight\nwith Ishmael the son of Nethaniah; and\nthey found him by the great pool that is\nin Gibeon.\nSo it was, when all the people who\nwere with Ishmael saw Johanan the son\nof Kareah, and all the captains of the\nforces who were with him, that they\nwere glad.\nThen all the people whom Ishmael had\ncarried away captive from Mizpah\nturned around and came back, and went\nto Johanan the son of Kareah.\nand said to Jeremiah the prophet,\n\"Please, let our petition be acceptable to\nyou, and pray for us to the LORD your\nGod, for all this remnant (since we are\nleft but a few of many, as you can see),\nthat the LORD your God may show us\nthe way in which we should walk and\nthe thing we should do.\"\nBut Ishmael the son of Nethaniah\nescaped from Johanan with eight men\nand went to the Ammonites.\nThen Johanan the son of Kareah, and\nall the captains of the forces that were\nwith him, took from Mizpah all the rest of\nthe people whom he had recovered from\nIshmael the son of Nethaniah after he\nhad murdered Gedaliah the son of\nAhikam--the mighty men of war and the\nwomen and the children and the\neunuchs, whom he had brought back\nfrom Gibeon.\nThen Jeremiah the prophet said to\nthem, \"I have heard. Indeed, I will pray\nto the LORD your God according to your\nwords, and it shall be, that whatever the\nLORD answers you, I will declare it to\nyou. I will keep nothing back from you.\"\nSo they said to Jeremiah, \"Let the\nLORD be a true and faithful witness\nbetween us, if we do not do according to\neverything which the LORD your God\nsends us by you.\nAnd they departed and dwelt in the\nhabitation of Chimham, which is near\nBethlehem, as they went on their way to\nEgypt,\nWhether it is pleasing or displeasing,\nwe will obey the voice of the LORD our\nGod to whom we send you, that it may\nbe well with us when we obey the voice\nof the LORD our God.\"\nbecause of the Chaldeans; for they\nwere afraid of them, because Ishmael\nthe son of Nethaniah had murdered\nGedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the\nking of Babylon had made governor in\nthe land.\n42Now all the captains of the forces,\nJohanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah\nthe son of Hoshaiah, and all the people,\nfrom the least to the greatest, came\nnear\nAnd it happened after ten days that the\nword of the LORD came to Jeremiah.\nThen he called Johanan the son of\nKareah, all the captains of the forces\nwhich were with him, and all the people\nfrom the least even to the greatest,\nand said to them, \"Thus says the LORD,\nthe God of Israel, to whom you sent me\nto present your petition before Him:\n\"If you will still remain in this land, then\nI will build you and not pull you down,\nand I will plant you and not pluck you up.\nFor I relent concerning the disaster that I\nhave brought upon you.\nDo not be afraid of the king of Babylon,\nof whom you are afraid; do not be afraid\nof him,' says the LORD, \"for I am with\nyou, to save you and deliver you from\nhis hand.\n\"For thus says the LORD of hosts, the\nGod of Israel: \"As My anger and My fury\nhave been poured out on the inhabitants\nof Jerusalem, so will My fury be poured\nout on you when you enter Egypt.

And this was their\nappearance: they had the likeness of a\nman.\nEach one had four faces, and each one\nhad four wings.\nTheir legs were straight, and the soles\nof their feet were like the soles of calves'\nfeet. They sparkled like the color of\nburnished bronze.\nThe hands of a man were under their\nwings on their four sides; and each of\nthe four had faces and wings.\nTheir wings touched one another. The\ncreatures did not turn when they went,\nbut each one went straight forward.\nAs for the likeness of their faces, each\nhad the face of a man; each of the four\nhad the face of a lion on the right side,\neach of the four had the face of an ox on\nthe left side, and each of the four had\nthe face of an eagle.\nThus were their faces. Their wings\nstretched upward; two wings of each\none touched one another, and two\ncovered their bodies.\nAnd each one went straight forward;\nthey went wherever the spirit wanted to\ngo, and they did not turn when they\nwent.\nAs for the likeness of the living\ncreatures, their appearance was like\nburning coals of fire, like the\nappearance of torches going back and\nforth among the living creatures. The fire\nwas bright, and out of the fire went\nlightning.\nAnd the living creatures ran back and\nforth, in appearance like a flash of\nlightning.\nNow as I looked at the living creatures,\nbehold, a wheel was on the earth beside\neach living creature with its four faces.\nThe appearance of the wheels and\ntheir workings was like the color of beryl,\nand all four had the same likeness. The\nappearance of their workings was, as it\nwere, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.\nWhen they went, I heard the noise of\ntheir wings, like the noise of many\nwaters, like the voice of the Almighty, a\ntumult like the noise of an army; and\nwhen they stood still, they let down their\nwings.\nWhen they moved, they went toward\nany one of four directions; they did not\nturn aside when they went.\nAs for their rims, they were so high\nthey were awesome; and their rims were\nfull of eyes, all around the four of them.\nA voice came from above the\nfirmament that was over their heads;\nwhenever they stood, they let down their\nwings.\nWhen the living creatures went, the\nwheels went beside them; and when the\nliving creatures were lifted up from the\nearth, the wheels were lifted up.\nAnd above the firmament over their\nheads was the likeness of a throne, in\nappearance like a sapphire stone; on\nthe likeness of the throne was a likeness\nwith the appearance of a man high\nabove it.\nWherever the spirit wanted to go, they\nwent, because there the spirit went; and\nthe wheels were lifted together with\nthem, for the spirit of the living creatures\nwas in the wheels.\nWhen those went, these went; when\nthose stood, these stood; and when\nthose were lifted up from the earth, the\nwheels were lifted up together with them,\nfor the spirit of the living creatures was\nin the wheels.\nThe likeness of the firmament above\nthe heads of the living creatures was\nlike the color of an awesome crystal,\nstretched out over their heads.\nAnd under the firmament their wings\nspread out straight, one toward another.\nEach one had two which covered one\nside, and each one had two which\ncovered the other side of the body.\nAlso from the appearance of His waist\nand upward I saw, as it were, the color\nof amber with the appearance of fire all\naround within it; and from the\nappearance of His waist and downward\nI saw, as it were, the appearance of fire\nwith brightness all around.\nLike the appearance of a rainbow in a\ncloud on a rainy day, so was the\nappearance of the brightness all around\nit. This was the appearance of the\nlikeness of the glory of the LORD. So\nwhen I saw it, I fell on my face, and I\nheard a voice of One speaking.\n2And He said to me, \"Son of man,\nstand on your feet, and I will speak to\nyou.\"\nThen the Spirit entered me when He\nspoke to me, and set me on my feet;\nand I heard Him who spoke to me.\nAnd He said to me: \"Son of man, I am\nsending you to the children of Israel, to\na rebellious nation that has rebelled\nagainst Me; they and their fathers have\ntransgressed against Me to this very day.\nFor they are impudent and stubborn\nchildren. I am sending you to them, and\nyou shall say to them, \"Thus says the\nLord GOD.'\nAs for them, whether they hear or\nwhether they refuse--for they are a\nrebellious house--yet they will know that\na prophet has been among them.\n\"And you, son of man, do not be afraid\nof them nor be afraid of their words,\nthough briers and thorns are with you\nand you dwell among scorpions; do not\nbe afraid of their words or dismayed by\ntheir looks, though they are a rebellious\nhouse.\nYou shall speak My words to them,\nwhether they hear or whether they\nrefuse, for they are rebellious.\nBut you, son of man, hear what I say to\nyou. Do not be rebellious like that\nrebellious house; open your mouth and\neat what I give you.\"\nNow when I looked, there was a hand\nstretched out to me; and behold, a scroll\nof a book was in it.\nThen He spread it before me; and\nthere was writing on the inside and on\nthe outside, and written on it were\nlamentations and mourning and woe.\n3Moreover He said to me, \"Son of\nman, eat what you find; eat this scroll,\nand go, speak to the house of Israel.\"\nSo I opened my mouth, and He caused\nme to eat that scroll.\nAnd He said to me, \"Son of man, feed\nyour belly, and fill your stomach with this\nscroll that I give you.\" So I ate, and it\nwas in my mouth like honey in\nsweetness.\nThen He said to me: \"Son of man, go to\nthe house of Israel and speak with My\nwords to them.\nFor you are not sent to a people of\nunfamiliar speech and of hard language,\nbut to the house of Israel,\nnot to many people of unfamiliar\nspeech and of hard language, whose\nwords you cannot understand. Surely,\nhad I sent you to them, they would have\nlistened to you.\nBut the house of Israel will not listen to\nyou, because they will not listen to Me;\nfor all the house of Israel are impudent\nand hard-hearted.\nBehold, I have made your face strong\nagainst their faces, and your forehead\nstrong against their foreheads.\nLike adamant stone, harder than flint, I\nhave made your forehead; do not be\nafraid of them, nor be dismayed at their\nlooks, though they are a rebellious\nhouse.\"\nMoreover He said to me: \"Son of man,\nreceive into your heart all My words that\nI speak to you, and hear with your ears.\nnor speak to warn the wicked from his\nwicked way, to save his life, that same\nwicked man shall die in his iniquity; but\nhis blood I will require at your hand.\nAnd go, get to the captives, to the\nchildren of your people, and speak to\nthem and tell them, \"Thus says the Lord\nGOD,' whether they hear, or whether\nthey refuse.\"\nYet, if you warn the wicked, and he\ndoes not turn from his wickedness, nor\nfrom his wicked way, he shall die in his\niniquity; but you have delivered your\nsoul.\nThen the Spirit lifted me up, and I\nheard behind me a great thunderous\nvoice: \"Blessed is the glory of the LORD\nfrom His place!\"\nI also heard the noise of the wings of\nthe living creatures that touched one\nanother, and the noise of the wheels\nbeside them, and a great thunderous\nnoise.\n\"Again, when a righteous man turns\nfrom his righteousness and commits\niniquity, and I lay a stumbling block\nbefore him, he shall die; because you\ndid not give him warning, he shall die in\nhis sin, and his righteousness which he\nhas done shall not be remembered; but\nhis blood I will require at your hand.\nSo the Spirit lifted me up and took me\naway, and I went in bitterness, in the\nheat of my spirit; but the hand of the\nLORD was strong upon me.\nNevertheless if you warn the righteous\nman that the righteous should not sin,\nand he does not sin, he shall surely live\nbecause he took warning; also you will\nhave delivered your soul.\"\nThen I came to the captives at Tel\nAbib, who dwelt by the River Chebar;\nand I sat where they sat, and remained\nthere astonished among them seven\ndays.\nThen the hand of the LORD was upon\nme there, and He said to me, \"Arise, go\nout into the plain, and there I shall talk\nwith you.\"\nNow it came to pass at the end of\nseven days that the word of the LORD\ncame to me, saying,\nSo I arose and went out into the plain,\nand behold, the glory of the LORD stood\nthere, like the glory which I saw by the\nRiver Chebar; and I fell on my face.\n\"Son of man, I have made you a\nwatchman for the house of Israel;\ntherefore hear a word from My mouth,\nand give them warning from Me:\nThen the Spirit entered me and set me\non my feet, and spoke with me and said\nto me: \"Go, shut yourself inside your\nhouse.\nWhen I say to the wicked, \"You shall\nsurely die,' and you give him no warning,\nAnd you, O son of man, surely they\nwill put ropes on you and bind you with\nthem, so that you cannot go out among\nthem.\nI will make your tongue cling to the\nroof of your mouth, so that you shall be\nmute and not be one to rebuke them, for\nthey are a rebellious house.\nBut when I speak with you, I will open\nyour mouth, and you shall say to them,\n\"Thus says the Lord GOD.' He who\nhears, let him hear; and he who refuses,\nlet him refuse; for they are a rebellious\nhouse.\n4\"You also, son of man, take a clay\ntablet and lay it before you, and portray\non it a city, Jerusalem.\nLay siege against it, build a siege wall\nagainst it, and heap up a mound against\nit; set camps against it also, and place\nbattering rams against it all around.\nMoreover take for yourself an iron plate,\nand set it as an iron wall between you\nand the city. Set your face against it,\nand it shall be besieged, and you shall\nlay siege against it. This will be a sign to\nthe house of Israel.\n\"Lie also on your left side, and lay the\niniquity of the house of Israel upon it.\nAccording to the number of the days\nthat you lie on it, you shall bear their\niniquity.\nAnd when you have completed them,\nlie again on your right side; then you\nshall bear the iniquity of the house of\nJudah forty days. I have laid on you a\nday for each year.\n\"Therefore you shall set your face\ntoward the siege of Jerusalem; your arm\nshall be uncovered, and you shall\nprophesy against it.\nAnd surely I will restrain you so that you\ncannot turn from one side to another till\nyou have ended the days of your siege.\n\"Also take for yourself wheat, barley,\nbeans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them\ninto one vessel, and make bread of\nthem for yourself. During the number of\ndays that you lie on your side, three\nhundred and ninety days, you shall eat it.\nAnd your food which you eat shall be\nby weight, twenty shekels a day; from\ntime to time you shall eat it.\nYou shall also drink water by measure,\none-sixth of a hin; from time to time you\nshall drink.\nAnd you shall eat it as barley cakes;\nand bake it using fuel of human waste in\ntheir sight.\"\nThen the LORD said, \"So shall the\nchildren of Israel eat their defiled bread\namong the Gentiles, where I will drive\nthem.\"\nFor I have laid on you the years of their\niniquity, according to the number of the\ndays, three hundred and ninety days; so\nyou shall bear the iniquity of the house\nof Israel.\nSo I said, \"Ah, Lord GOD! Indeed I\nhave never defiled myself from my youth\ntill now; I have never eaten what died of\nitself or was torn by beasts, nor has\nabominable flesh ever come into my\nmouth.\"\nThen He said to me, \"See, I am giving\nyou cow dung instead of human waste,\nand you shall prepare your bread over\nit.\"\nMoreover He said to me, \"Son of man,\nsurely I will cut off the supply of bread in\nJerusalem; they shall eat bread by\nweight and with anxiety, and shall drink\nwater by measure and with dread,\nthat they may lack bread and water,\nand be dismayed with one another, and\nwaste away because of their iniquity.\n5\"And you, son of man, take a sharp\nsword, take it as a barber's razor, and\npass it over your head and your beard;\nthen take scales to weigh and divide the\nhair.\nYou shall burn with fire one-third in the\nmidst of the city, when the days of the\nsiege are finished; then you shall take\none-third and strike around it with the\nsword, and one-third you shall scatter in\nthe wind: I will draw out a sword after\nthem.\nYou shall also take a small number of\nthem and bind them in the edge of your\ngarment.\nThen take some of them again and\nthrow them into the midst of the fire, and\nburn them in the fire. From there a fire\nwill go out into all the house of Israel.\n\"Thus says the Lord GOD: \"This is\nJerusalem; I have set her in the midst of\nthe nations and the countries all around\nher.\nShe has rebelled against My judgments\nby doing wickedness more than the\nnations, and against My statutes more\nthan the countries that are all around\nher; for they have refused My judgments,\nand they have not walked in My\nstatutes.'\nTherefore thus says the Lord GOD:\n\"Because\nyou\nhave\nmultiplied\ndisobedience more than the nations that\nare all around you, have not walked in\nMy statutes nor kept My judgments, nor\neven done according to the judgments\nof the nations that are all around you'-8\ntherefore thus says the Lord GOD:\n\"Indeed I, even I, am against you and\nwill execute judgments in your midst in\nthe sight of the nations.\nAnd I will do among you what I have\nnever done, and the like of which I will\nnever do again, because of all your\nabominations.\nTherefore fathers shall eat their sons\nin your midst, and sons shall eat their\nfathers; and I will execute judgments\namong you, and all of you who remain I\nwill scatter to all the winds.\n\"Therefore, as I live,' says the Lord\nGOD, \"surely, because you have defiled\nMy sanctuary with all your detestable\nthings and with all your abominations,\ntherefore I will also diminish you; My eye\nwill not spare, nor will I have any pity.\nOne-third of you shall die of the\npestilence, and be consumed with\nfamine in your midst; and one-third shall\nfall by the sword all around you; and I\nwill scatter another third to all the winds,\nand I will draw out a sword after them.\n\"Thus shall My anger be spent, and I\nwill cause My fury to rest upon them,\nand I will be avenged; and they shall\nknow that I, the LORD, have spoken it in\nMy zeal, when I have spent My fury\nupon them.\nMoreover I will make you a waste and\na reproach among the nations that are\nall around you, in the sight of all who\npass by.\n\"So it shall be a reproach, a taunt, a\nlesson, and an astonishment to the\nnations that are all around you, when I\nexecute judgments among you in anger\nand in fury and in furious rebukes.

Each man had a\ncenser in his hand, and a thick cloud of\nincense went up.\nThen He said to me, \"Son of man,\nhave you seen what the elders of the\nhouse of Israel do in the dark, every\nman in the room of his idols? For they\nsay, \"The LORD does not see us, the\nLORD has forsaken the land.\"'\nAnd He said to me, \"Turn again, and\nyou will see greater abominations that\nthey are doing.\"\nFurthermore He said to me, \"Son of\nman, do you see what they are doing,\nthe great abominations that the house of\nIsrael commits here, to make Me go far\naway from My sanctuary? Now turn\nagain,\nyou\nwill\nsee\ngreater\nabominations.\"\nSo He brought me to the door of the\nnorth gate of the LORD's house; and to\nmy dismay, women were sitting there\nweeping for Tammuz.\nThen He said to me, \"Have you seen\nthis, O son of man? Turn again, you will\nsee greater abominations than these.\"\nSo He brought me into the inner court\nof the LORD's house; and there, at the\ndoor of the temple of the LORD,\nbetween the porch and the altar, were\nabout twenty-five men with their backs\ntoward the temple of the LORD and their\nfaces toward the east, and they were\nworshiping the sun toward the east.\nAnd He said to me, \"Have you seen\nthis, O son of man? Is it a trivial thing to\nthe house of Judah to commit the\nabominations which they commit here?\nFor they have filled the land with\nviolence; then they have returned to\nprovoke Me to anger. Indeed they put\nthe branch to their nose.\nTherefore I also will act in fury. My eye\nwill not spare nor will I have pity; and\nthough they cry in My ears with a loud\nvoice, I will not hear them.\"\n9Then He called out in my hearing\nwith a loud voice, saying, \"Let those who\nhave charge over the city draw near,\neach with a deadly weapon in his hand.\"\nAnd suddenly six men came from the\ndirection of the upper gate, which faces\nnorth, each with his battle-ax in his hand.\nOne man among them was clothed with\nlinen and had a writer's inkhorn at his\nside. They went in and stood beside the\nbronze altar.\nand the LORD said to him, \"Go through\nthe midst of the city, through the midst\nof Jerusalem, and put a mark on the\nforeheads of the men who sigh and cry\nover all the abominations that are done\nwithin it.\"\nTo the others He said in my hearing,\n\"Go after him through the city and kill;\ndo not let your eye spare, nor have any\npity.\nUtterly slay old and young men,\nmaidens and little children and women;\nbut do not come near anyone on whom\nis the mark; and begin at My sanctuary.\"\nSo they began with the elders who were\nbefore the temple.\nThen He said to them, \"Defile the\ntemple, and fill the courts with the slain.\nGo out!\" And they went out and killed in\nthe city.\nSo it was, that while they were killing\nthem, I was left alone; and I fell on my\nface and cried out, and said, \"Ah, Lord\nGOD! Will You destroy all the remnant\nof Israel in pouring out Your fury on\nJerusalem?\"\nThen He said to me, \"The iniquity of the\nhouse of Israel and Judah is\nexceedingly great, and the land is full of\nbloodshed, and the city full of perversity;\nfor they say, \"The LORD has forsaken\nthe land, and the LORD does not see!'\nNow the glory of the God of Israel had\ngone up from the cherub, where it had\nbeen, to the threshold of the temple.\nAnd He called to the man clothed with\nlinen, who had the writer's inkhorn at his\nside;\nAnd as for Me also, My eye will neither\nspare, nor will I have pity, but I will\nrecompense their deeds on their own\nhead.\"\nJust then, the man clothed with linen,\nwho had the inkhorn at his side,\nreported back and said, \"I have done as\nYou commanded me.\"\n10And I looked, and there in the\nfirmament that was above the head of\nthe\ncherubim,\nthere\nappeared\nsomething like a sapphire stone, having\nthe appearance of the likeness of a\nthrone.\nAnd the cherub stretched out his hand\nfrom among the cherubim to the fire that\nwas among the cherubim, and took\nsome of it and put it into the hands of\nthe man clothed with linen, who took it\nand went out.\nThe cherubim appeared to have the\nform of a man's hand under their wings.\nAnd when I looked, there were four\nwheels by the cherubim, one wheel by\none cherub and another wheel by each\nother cherub; the wheels appeared to\nhave the color of a beryl stone.\nThen He spoke to the man clothed with\nlinen, and said, \"Go in among the\nwheels, under the cherub, fill your hands\nwith coals of fire from among the\ncherubim, and scatter them over the\ncity.\" And he went in as I watched.\nAs for their appearance, all four looked\nalike--as it were, a wheel in the middle\nof a wheel.\nNow the cherubim were standing on the\nsouth side of the temple when the man\nwent in, and the cloud filled the inner\ncourt.\nWhen they went, they went toward any\nof their four directions; they did not turn\naside when they went, but followed in\nthe direction the head was facing. They\ndid not turn aside when they went.\nThen the glory of the LORD went up\nfrom the cherub, and paused over the\nthreshold of the temple; and the house\nwas filled with the cloud, and the court\nwas full of the brightness of the LORD's\nglory.\nAnd the sound of the wings of the\ncherubim was heard even in the outer\ncourt, like the voice of Almighty God\nwhen He speaks.\nThen\nit\nhappened,\nwhen\nHe\ncommanded the man clothed in linen,\nsaying, \"Take fire from among the\nwheels, from among the cherubim,\" that\nhe went in and stood beside the wheels.\nAnd their whole body, with their back,\ntheir hands, their wings, and the wheels\nthat the four had, were full of eyes all\naround.\nAs for the wheels, they were called in\nmy hearing, \"Wheel.\"\nEach one had four faces: the first face\nwas the face of a cherub, the second\nface the face of a man, the third the face\nof a lion, and the fourth the face of an\neagle.\nAnd the cherubim were lifted up. This\nwas the living creature I saw by the\nRiver Chebar.\nWhen the cherubim went, the wheels\nwent beside them; and when the\ncherubim lifted their wings to mount up\nfrom the earth, the same wheels also\ndid not turn from beside them.\nWhen the cherubim stood still, the\nwheels stood still, and when one was\nlifted up, the other lifted itself up, for the\nspirit of the living creature was in them.\nJaazaniah the son of Azzur, and\nPelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of\nthe people.\nAnd He said to me: \"Son of man, these\nare the men who devise iniquity and\ngive wicked counsel in this city,\nwho say, \"The time is not near to build\nhouses; this city is the caldron, and we\nare the meat.'\nThen the glory of the LORD departed\nfrom the threshold of the temple and\nstood over the cherubim.\nTherefore prophesy against\nprophesy, O son of man!\"\nAnd the cherubim lifted their wings and\nmounted up from the earth in my sight.\nWhen they went out, the wheels were\nbeside them; and they stood at the door\nof the east gate of the LORD's house,\nand the glory of the God of Israel was\nabove them.\nThis is the living creature I saw under\nthe God of Israel by the River Chebar,\nand I knew they were cherubim.\nthem,\nThen the Spirit of the LORD fell upon\nme, and said to me, \"Speak! \"Thus says\nthe LORD: \"Thus you have said, O\nhouse of Israel; for I know the things\nthat come into your mind.\nYou have multiplied your slain in this\ncity, and you have filled its streets with\nthe slain.\"\nEach one had four faces and each one\nfour wings, and the likeness of the\nhands of a man was under their wings.\nTherefore thus says the Lord GOD:\n\"Your slain whom you have laid in its\nmidst, they are the meat, and this city is\nthe caldron; but I shall bring you out of\nthe midst of it.\nAnd the likeness of their faces was the\nsame as the faces which I had seen by\nthe River Chebar, their appearance and\ntheir persons. They each went straight\nforward.\n11Then the Spirit lifted me up and\nbrought me to the East Gate of the\nLORD's house, which faces eastward;\nand there at the door of the gate were\ntwenty-five men, among whom I saw\nYou have feared the sword; and I will\nbring a sword upon you,\" says the Lord\nGOD.\n\"And I will bring you out of its midst,\nand deliver you into the hands of\nstrangers, and execute judgments on\nyou.\nYou shall fall by the sword. I will judge\nyou at the border of Israel. Then you\nshall know that I am the LORD.\nThis city shall not be your caldron, nor\nshall you be the meat in its midst. I will\njudge you at the border of Israel.\nAnd they will go there, and they will\ntake away all its detestable things and\nall its abominations from there.\nAnd you shall know that I am the\nLORD; for you have not walked in My\nstatutes nor executed My judgments,\nbut have done according to the customs\nof the Gentiles which are all around\nyou.\"\"'\nNow it happened, while I was\nprophesying, that Pelatiah the son of\nBenaiah died. Then I fell on my face and\ncried with a loud voice, and said, \"Ah,\nLord GOD! Will You make a complete\nend of the remnant of Israel?\"\nAgain the word of the LORD came to\nme, saying,\nThen I will give them one heart, and I\nwill put a new spirit within them, and\ntake the stony heart out of their flesh,\nand give them a heart of flesh,\nthat they may walk in My statutes and\nkeep My judgments and do them; and\nthey shall be My people, and I will be\ntheir God.\nBut as for those whose hearts follow\nthe desire for their detestable things and\ntheir abominations, I will recompense\ntheir deeds on their own heads,\" says\nthe Lord GOD.\n\"Son of man, your brethren, your\nrelatives, your countrymen, and all the\nhouse of Israel in its entirety, are those\nabout whom the inhabitants of\nJerusalem have said, \"Get far away\nfrom the LORD; this land has been\ngiven to us as a possession.'\nTherefore say, \"Thus says the Lord\nGOD: \"Although I have cast them far off\namong the Gentiles, and although I\nhave scattered them among the\ncountries, yet I shall be a little sanctuary\nfor them in the countries where they\nhave gone.\"'\nSo the cherubim lifted up their wings,\nwith the wheels beside them, and the\nglory of the God of Israel was high\nabove them.\nAnd the glory of the LORD went up\nfrom the midst of the city and stood on\nthe mountain, which is on the east side\nof the city.\nThen the Spirit took me up and\nbrought me in a vision by the Spirit of\nGod into Chaldea, to those in captivity.\nAnd the vision that I had seen went up\nfrom me.\nTherefore say, \"Thus says the Lord\nGOD: \"I will gather you from the peoples,\nassemble you from the countries where\nyou have been scattered, and I will give\nyou the land of Israel.\"'\nSo I spoke to those in captivity of all\nthe things the LORD had shown me.\n12Now the word of the LORD came\nto me, saying:\n\"Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a\nrebellious house, which has eyes to see\nbut does not see, and ears to hear but\ndoes not hear; for they are a rebellious\nhouse.\nSay to them, \"Thus says the Lord\nGOD: \"This burden concerns the prince\nin Jerusalem and all the house of Israel\nwho are among them.\"'\n\"Therefore, son of man, prepare your\nbelongings for captivity, and go into\ncaptivity by day in their sight.

I brought\nout my belongings by day, as though\ngoing into captivity, and at evening I dug\nthrough the wall with my hand. I brought\nthem out at twilight, and I bore them on\nmy shoulder in their sight.\nI will scatter to every wind all who are\naround him to help him, and all his\ntroops; and I will draw out the sword\nafter them.\n\"Then they shall know that I am the\nLORD, when I scatter them among the\nnations and disperse them throughout\nthe countries.\nAnd in the morning the word of the\nLORD came to me, saying,\nBut I will spare a few of their men from\nthe sword, from famine, and from\npestilence, that they may declare all\ntheir abominations among the Gentiles\nwherever they go.

Then I\nalienated Myself from her, As I had\nalienated Myself from her sister.\n\"Yet she multiplied her harlotry In\ncalling to remembrance the days of her\nyouth, When she had played the harlot\nin the land of Egypt.\n\"Now although her sister Oholibah saw\nthis, she became more corrupt in her\nlust than she, and in her harlotry more\ncorrupt than her sister's harlotry.\nFor she lusted for her paramours,\nWhose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys,\nAnd whose issue is like the issue of\nhorses.\n\"She lusted for the neighboring\nAssyrians, Captains and rulers, Clothed\nmost gorgeously, Horsemen riding on\nhorses, All of them desirable young men.\nThus you called to remembrance the\nlewdness of your youth, When the\nEgyptians pressed your bosom Because\nof your youthful breasts.\nThen I saw that she was defiled; Both\ntook the same way.\nBut she increased her harlotry; She\nlooked at men portrayed on the wall,\nImages of Chaldeans portrayed in\nvermilion,\n\"Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the\nLord GOD: \"Behold, I will stir up your\nlovers against you, From whom you\nhave alienated yourself, And I will bring\nthem against you from every side:\nGirded with belts around their waists,\nFlowing turbans on their heads, All of\nthem looking like captains, In the\nmanner of the Babylonians of Chaldea,\nThe land of their nativity.\nThe Babylonians, All the Chaldeans,\nPekod, Shoa, Koa, All the Assyrians\nwith them, All of them desirable young\nmen, Governors and rulers, Captains\nand men of renown, All of them riding on\nhorses.\nAs soon as her eyes saw them, She\nlusted for them And sent messengers to\nthem in Chaldea.\n\"Then the Babylonians came to her,\ninto the bed of love, And they defiled her\nAnd they shall come against you With\nchariots, wagons, and war-horses, With\na horde of people.

In the man's hand\nwas a measuring rod six cubits long,\neach being a cubit and a handbreadth;\nand he measured the width of the wall\nstructure, one rod; and the height, one\nrod.\nThen he went to the gateway which\nfaced east; and he went up its stairs and\nmeasured the threshold of the gateway,\nwhich was one rod wide, and the other\nthreshold was one rod wide.\nEach gate chamber was one rod long\nand one rod wide; between the gate\nchambers was a space of five cubits;\nand the threshold of the gateway by the\nvestibule of the inside gate was one rod.\nHe also measured the vestibule of the\ninside gate, one rod.\nHe measured the gateposts, sixty\ncubits high, and the court all around the\ngateway extended to the gatepost.\nFrom the front of the entrance gate to\nthe front of the vestibule of the inner\ngate was fifty cubits.\nThere were beveled window frames in\nthe gate chambers and in their\nintervening archways on the inside of\nthe gateway all around, and likewise in\nthe vestibules. There were windows all\naround on the inside. And on each\ngatepost were palm trees.\nThen he measured the vestibule of the\ngateway, eight cubits; and the gateposts,\ntwo cubits. The vestibule of the gate\nwas on the inside.\nThen he brought me into the outer\ncourt; and there were chambers and a\npavement made all around the court;\nthirty chambers faced the pavement.\nIn the eastern gateway were three\ngate chambers on one side and three on\nthe other; the three were all the same\nsize; also the gateposts were of the\nsame size on this side and that side.\nThe pavement was by the side of the\ngateways, corresponding to the length\nof the gateways; this was the lower\npavement.\nHe measured the width of the entrance\nto the gateway, ten cubits; and the\nlength of the gate, thirteen cubits.\nThen he measured the width from the\nfront of the lower gateway to the front of\nthe inner court exterior, one hundred\ncubits toward the east and the north.\nThere was a space in front of the gate\nchambers, one cubit on this side and\none cubit on that side; the gate\nchambers were six cubits on this side\nand six cubits on that side.\nOn the outer court was also a gateway\nfacing north, and he measured its length\nand its width.\nThen he measured the gateway from\nthe roof of one gate chamber to the roof\nof the other; the width was twenty-five\ncubits, as door faces door.\nIts gate chambers, three on this side\nand three on that side, its gateposts and\nits\narchways,\nhad\nthe\nsame\nmeasurements as the first gate; its\nlength was fifty cubits and its width\ntwenty-five cubits.\nIts windows and those of its archways,\nand also its palm trees, had the same\nmeasurements as the gateway facing\neast; it was ascended by seven steps,\nand its archway was in front of it.\nA gate of the inner court was opposite\nthe northern gateway, just as the\neastern gateway; and he measured from\ngateway to gateway, one hundred cubits.\nAfter that he brought me toward the\nsouth, and there a gateway was facing\nsouth; and he measured its gateposts\nand archways according to these same\nmeasurements.\nThere were windows in it and in its\narchways all around like those windows;\nits length was fifty cubits and its width\ntwenty-five cubits.\nSeven steps led up to it, and its\narchway was in front of them; and it had\npalm trees on its gateposts, one on this\nside and one on that side.\nThere was also a gateway on the inner\ncourt, facing south; and he measured\nfrom gateway to gateway toward the\nsouth, one hundred cubits.\nThen he brought me to the inner court\nthrough the southern gateway; he\nmeasured\nthe\nsouthern\ngateway\naccording to these same measurements.\nAlso its gate chambers, its gateposts,\nand its archways were according to\nthese same measurements; there were\nwindows in it and in its archways all\naround; it was fifty cubits long and\ntwenty-five cubits wide.\nThere were archways all around,\ntwenty-five cubits long and five cubits\nwide.\nIts archways faced the outer court,\npalm trees were on its gateposts, and\ngoing up to it were eight steps.\nAnd he brought me into the inner court\nfacing east; he measured the gateway\naccording to these same measurements.\nAlso its gate chambers, its gateposts,\nand its archways were according to\nthese same measurements; and there\nwere windows in it and in its archways\nall around; it was fifty cubits long and\ntwenty-five cubits wide.\nIts archways faced the outer court, and\npalm trees were on its gateposts on this\nside and on that side; and going up to it\nwere eight steps.\nThen he brought me to the north\ngateway and measured it according to\nthese same measurements-36\nalso its gate chambers, its gateposts,\nand its archways. It had windows all\naround; its length was fifty cubits and its\nwidth twenty-five cubits.\nIts gateposts faced the outer court,\npalm trees were on its gateposts on this\nside and on that side, and going up to it\nwere eight steps.\nThere was a chamber and its entrance\nby the gateposts of the gateway, where\nthey washed the burnt offering.\nIn the vestibule of the gateway were\ntwo tables on this side and two tables on\nthat side, on which to slay the burnt\noffering, the sin offering, and the\ntrespass offering.\nAt the outer side of the vestibule, as\none goes up to the entrance of the\nnorthern gateway, were two tables; and\non the other side of the vestibule of the\ngateway were two tables.\nFour tables were on this side and four\ntables on that side, by the side of the\ngateway, eight tables on which they\nslaughtered the sacrifices.\nThere were also four tables of hewn\nstone for the burnt offering, one cubit\nand a half long, one cubit and a half\nwide, and one cubit high; on these they\nlaid the instruments with which they\nslaughtered the burnt offering and the\nsacrifice.\nInside were hooks, a handbreadth\nwide, fastened all around; and the flesh\nof the sacrifices was on the tables.\nOutside the inner gate were the\nchambers for the singers in the inner\ncourt, one facing south at the side of the\nnorthern gateway, and the other facing\nnorth at the side of the southern\ngateway.\nThen he said to me, \"This chamber\nwhich faces south is for the priests who\nhave charge of the temple.\nThe chamber which faces north is for\nthe priests who have charge of the altar;\nthese are the sons of Zadok, from the\nsons of Levi, who come near the LORD\nto minister to Him.\"\nAnd he measured the court, one\nhundred cubits long and one hundred\ncubits wide, foursquare. The altar was in\nfront of the temple.\nThen he brought me to the vestibule of\nthe temple and measured the doorposts\nof the vestibule, five cubits on this side\nand five cubits on that side; and the\nwidth of the gateway was three cubits\non this side and three cubits on that side.\nThe length of the vestibule was twenty\ncubits, and the width eleven cubits; and\nby the steps which led up to it there\nwere pillars by the doorposts, one on\nthis side and another on that side.\n41Then he brought me into the\nsanctuary and measured the doorposts,\nsix cubits wide on one side and six\ncubits wide on the other side--the width\nof the tabernacle.\nThe width of the entryway was ten\ncubits, and the side walls of the\nentrance were five cubits on this side\nand five cubits on the other side; and he\nmeasured its length, forty cubits, and its\nwidth, twenty cubits.\nAlso he went inside and measured the\ndoorposts, two cubits; and the entrance,\nsix cubits high; and the width of the\nentrance, seven cubits.\nHe measured the length, twenty cubits;\nand the width, twenty cubits, beyond the\nsanctuary; and he said to me, \"This is\nthe Most Holy Place.\"\nand the width of the terrace was five\ncubits all around.\nNext, he measured the wall of the\ntemple, six cubits. The width of each\nside chamber all around the temple was\nfour cubits on every side.\nThe building that faced the separating\ncourtyard at its western end was\nseventy cubits wide; the wall of the\nbuilding was five cubits thick all around,\nand its length ninety cubits.\nThe side chambers were in three\nstories, one above the other, thirty\nchambers in each story; they rested on\nledges which were for the side\nchambers all around, that they might be\nsupported, but not fastened to the wall\nof the temple.\nAs one went up from story to story, the\nside chambers became wider all around,\nbecause their supporting ledges in the\nwall of the temple ascended like steps;\ntherefore the width of the structure\nincreased as one went up from the\nlowest story to the highest by way of the\nmiddle one.\nI also saw an elevation all around the\ntemple; it was the foundation of the side\nchambers, a full rod, that is, six cubits\nhigh.\nThe thickness of the outer wall of the\nside chambers was five cubits, and so\nalso the remaining terrace by the place\nof the side chambers of the temple.\nAnd between it and the wall chambers\nwas a width of twenty cubits all around\nthe temple on every side.\nThe doors of the side chambers\nopened on the terrace, one door toward\nthe north and another toward the south;\nSo he measured the temple, one\nhundred cubits long; and the separating\ncourtyard with the building and its walls\nwas one hundred cubits long;\nalso the width of the eastern face of\nthe temple, including the separating\ncourtyard, was one hundred cubits.\nHe measured the length of the building\nbehind it, facing the separating\ncourtyard, with its galleries on the one\nside and on the other side, one hundred\ncubits, as well as the inner temple and\nthe porches of the court,\ntheir doorposts and the beveled\nwindow frames. And the galleries all\naround their three stories opposite the\nthreshold were paneled with wood from\nthe ground to the windows--the windows\nwere covered-17\nfrom the space above the door, even\nto the inner room, as well as outside,\nand on every wall all around, inside and\noutside, by measure.\nAnd it was made with cherubim and\npalm trees, a palm tree between cherub\nand cherub. Each cherub had two faces,\nso that the face of a man was toward a\npalm tree on one side, and the face of a\nyoung lion toward a palm tree on the\nother side; thus it was made throughout\nthe temple all around.\ncourtyard, and which was opposite the\nbuilding toward the north.\nFrom the floor to the space above the\ndoor, and on the wall of the sanctuary,\ncherubim and palm trees were carved.\nFacing the length, which was one\nhundred cubits (the width was fifty\ncubits), was the north door.\nThe doorposts of the temple were\nsquare, as was the front of the\nsanctuary; their appearance was similar.\nOpposite the inner court of twenty\ncubits, and opposite the pavement of\nthe outer court, was gallery against\ngallery in three stories.\nThe altar was of wood, three cubits\nhigh, and its length two cubits. Its\ncorners, its length, and its sides were of\nwood; and he said to me, \"This is the\ntable that is before the LORD.\"\nIn front of the chambers, toward the\ninside, was a walk ten cubits wide, at a\ndistance of one cubit; and their doors\nfaced north.\nThe temple and the sanctuary had two\ndoors.\nNow the upper chambers were shorter,\nbecause the galleries took away space\nfrom them more than from the lower and\nmiddle stories of the building.\nThe doors had two panels apiece, two\nfolding panels: two panels for one door\nand two panels for the other door.\nCherubim and palm trees were carved\non the doors of the temple just as they\nwere carved on the walls. A wooden\ncanopy was on the front of the vestibule\noutside.\nThere were beveled window frames\nand palm trees on one side and on the\nother, on the sides of the vestibule--also\non the side chambers of the temple and\non the canopies.\n42Then he brought me out into the\nouter court, by the way toward the north;\nand he brought me into the chamber\nwhich was opposite the separating\nFor they were in three stories and did\nnot have pillars like the pillars of the\ncourts; therefore the upper level was\nshortened more than the lower and\nmiddle levels from the ground up.\nAnd a wall which was outside ran\nparallel to the chambers, at the front of\nthe chambers, toward the outer court; its\nlength was fifty cubits.\nThe length of the chambers toward the\nouter court was fifty cubits, whereas that\nfacing the temple was one hundred\ncubits.\nAt the lower chambers was the\nentrance on the east side, as one goes\ninto them from the outer court.\nAlso there were chambers in the\nthickness of the wall of the court toward\nthe east, opposite the separating\ncourtyard and opposite the building.\nHe measured the east side with the\nmeasuring rod, five hundred rods by the\nmeasuring rod all around.\nThere was a walk in front of them also,\nand their appearance was like the\nchambers which were toward the north;\nthey were as long and as wide as the\nothers, and all their exits and entrances\nwere according to plan.\nHe measured the north side, five\nhundred rods by the measuring rod all\naround.\nHe measured the south side, five\nhundred rods by the measuring rod.\nAnd corresponding to the doors of the\nchambers that were facing south, as\none enters them, there was a door in\nfront of the walk, the way directly in front\nof the wall toward the east.\nThen he said to me, \"The north\nchambers and the south chambers,\nwhich are opposite the separating\ncourtyard, are the holy chambers where\nthe priests who approach the LORD\nshall eat the most holy offerings. There\nthey shall lay the most holy offerings-the grain offering, the sin offering, and\nthe trespass offering--for the place is\nholy.\nWhen the priests enter them, they\nshall not go out of the holy chamber into\nthe outer court; but there they shall\nleave their garments in which they\nminister, for they are holy. They shall\nput on other garments; then they may\napproach that which is for the people.\"\nNow when he had finished measuring\nthe inner temple, he brought me out\nthrough the gateway that faces toward\nthe east, and measured it all around.\nHe came around to the west side and\nmeasured five hundred rods by the\nmeasuring rod.\nHe measured it on the four sides; it\nhad a wall all around, five hundred\ncubits long and five hundred wide, to\nseparate the holy areas from the\ncommon.\n43Afterward he brought me to the\ngate, the gate that faces toward the east.\nAnd behold, the glory of the God of\nIsrael came from the way of the east.\nHis voice was like the sound of many\nwaters; and the earth shone with His\nglory.\nIt was like the appearance of the vision\nwhich I saw--like the vision which I saw\nwhen I came to destroy the city. The\nvisions were like the vision which I saw\nby the River Chebar; and I fell on my\nface.\nAnd the glory of the LORD came into\nthe temple by way of the gate which\nfaces toward the east.\nThe Spirit lifted me up and brought me\ninto the inner court; and behold, the\nglory of the LORD filled the temple.\nThis is the law of the temple: The\nwhole area surrounding the mountaintop\nis most holy. Behold, this is the law of\nthe temple.\nThen I heard Him speaking to me from\nthe temple, while a man stood beside\nme.\nAnd He said to me, \"Son of man, this is\nthe place of My throne and the place of\nthe soles of My feet, where I will dwell in\nthe midst of the children of Israel forever.\nNo more shall the house of Israel defile\nMy holy name, they nor their kings, by\ntheir harlotry or with the carcasses of\ntheir kings on their high places.\n\"These are the measurements of the\naltar in cubits (the cubit is one cubit and\na handbreadth): the base one cubit high\nand one cubit wide, with a rim all around\nits edge of one span.

Therefore tell me the dream,\nand I shall know that you can give me its\ninterpretation.\"\nThe Chaldeans answered the king,\nand said, \"There is not a man on earth\nwho can tell the king's matter; therefore\nno king, lord, or ruler has ever asked\nsuch things of any magician, astrologer,\nor Chaldean.\nIt is a difficult thing that the king\nrequests, and there is no other who can\ntell it to the king except the gods, whose\ndwelling is not with flesh.\"\nthat they might seek mercies from the\nGod of heaven concerning this secret,\nso that Daniel and his companions\nmight not perish with the rest of the wise\nmen of Babylon.\nThen the secret was revealed to\nDaniel in a night vision. So Daniel\nblessed the God of heaven.\nDaniel answered and said: \"Blessed\nbe the name of God forever and ever,\nFor wisdom and might are His.\nFor this reason the king was angry and\nvery furious, and gave the command to\ndestroy all the wise men of Babylon.\nAnd He changes the times and the\nseasons; He removes kings and raises\nup kings; He gives wisdom to the wise\nAnd knowledge to those who have\nunderstanding.\nSo the decree went out, and they\nbegan killing the wise men; and they\nsought Daniel and his companions, to\nkill them.\nHe reveals deep and secret things; He\nknows what is in the darkness, And light\ndwells with Him.\nThen with counsel and wisdom Daniel\nanswered Arioch, the captain of the\nking's guard, who had gone out to kill\nthe wise men of Babylon;\nhe answered and said to Arioch the\nking's captain, \"Why is the decree from\nthe king so urgent?\" Then Arioch made\nthe decision known to Daniel.\nSo Daniel went in and asked the king\nto give him time, that he might tell the\nking the interpretation.\n\"I thank You and praise You, O God of\nmy fathers; You have given me wisdom\nand might, And have now made known\nto me what we asked of You, For You\nhave made known to us the king's\ndemand.\"\nTherefore Daniel went to Arioch,\nwhom the king had appointed to destroy\nthe wise men of Babylon. He went and\nsaid thus to him: \"Do not destroy the\nwise men of Babylon; take me before\nthe king, and I will tell the king the\ninterpretation.\"\nThen Daniel went to his house, and\nmade the decision known to Hananiah,\nMishael, and Azariah, his companions,\nThen Arioch quickly brought Daniel\nbefore the king, and said thus to him, \"I\nhave found a man of the captives of\nJudah, who will make known to the king\nthe interpretation.\"\nits legs of iron, its feet partly of iron\nand partly of clay.\nThe king answered and said to Daniel,\nwhose name was Belteshazzar, \"Are\nyou able to make known to me the\ndream which I have seen, and its\ninterpretation?\"\nYou watched while a stone was cut out\nwithout hands, which struck the image\non its feet of iron and clay, and broke\nthem in pieces.\nDaniel answered in the presence of\nthe king, and said, \"The secret which the\nking has demanded, the wise men, the\nastrologers, the magicians, and the\nsoothsayers cannot declare to the king.\nBut there is a God in heaven who\nreveals secrets, and He has made\nknown to King Nebuchadnezzar what\nwill be in the latter days. Your dream,\nand the visions of your head upon your\nbed, were these:\nAs for you, O king, thoughts came to\nyour mind while on your bed, about what\nwould come to pass after this; and He\nwho reveals secrets has made known to\nyou what will be.\nBut as for me, this secret has not been\nrevealed to me because I have more\nwisdom than anyone living, but for our\nsakes\nwho\nmake\nknown\nthe\ninterpretation to the king, and that you\nmay know the thoughts of your heart.\n\"You, O king, were watching; and\nbehold, a great image! This great image,\nwhose splendor was excellent, stood\nbefore you; and its form was awesome.\nThis image's head was of fine gold, its\nchest and arms of silver, its belly and\nthighs of bronze,\nThen the iron, the clay, the bronze, the\nsilver, and the gold were crushed\ntogether, and became like chaff from the\nsummer threshing floors; the wind\ncarried them away so that no trace of\nthem was found. And the stone that\nstruck the image became a great\nmountain and filled the whole earth.\n\"This is the dream. Now we will tell the\ninterpretation of it before the king.\nYou, O king, are a king of kings. For\nthe God of heaven has given you a\nkingdom, power, strength, and glory;\nand wherever the children of men\ndwell, or the beasts of the field and the\nbirds of the heaven, He has given them\ninto your hand, and has made you ruler\nover them all--you are this head of gold.\nBut after you shall arise another\nkingdom inferior to yours; then another,\na third kingdom of bronze, which shall\nrule over all the earth.\nAnd the fourth kingdom shall be as\nstrong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks\nin pieces and shatters everything; and\nlike iron that crushes, that kingdom will\nbreak in pieces and crush all the others.\nWhereas you saw the feet and toes,\npartly of potter's clay and partly of iron,\nthe kingdom shall be divided; yet the\nstrength of the iron shall be in it, just as\nyou saw the iron mixed with ceramic\nclay.\nThen the king promoted Daniel and\ngave him many great gifts; and he made\nhim ruler over the whole province of\nBabylon, and chief administrator over all\nthe wise men of Babylon.\nAnd as the toes of the feet were partly\nof iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom\nshall be partly strong and partly fragile.\nAs you saw iron mixed with ceramic\nclay, they will mingle with the seed of\nmen; but they will not adhere to one\nanother, just as iron does not mix with\nclay.\nAnd in the days of these kings the God\nof heaven will set up a kingdom which\nshall never be destroyed; and the\nkingdom shall not be left to other\npeople; it shall break in pieces and\nconsume all these kingdoms, and it shall\nstand forever.\nInasmuch as you saw that the stone\nwas cut out of the mountain without\nhands, and that it broke in pieces the\niron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and\nthe gold--the great God has made\nknown to the king what will come to\npass after this. The dream is certain,\nand its interpretation is sure.\"\nAlso Daniel petitioned the king, and he\nset Shadrach, Meshach, and AbedNego over the affairs of the province of\nBabylon; but Daniel sat in the gate of\nthe king.\n3Nebuchadnezzar the king made an\nimage of gold, whose height was sixty\ncubits and its width six cubits. He set it\nup in the plain of Dura, in the province of\nBabylon.\nAnd King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to\ngather together the satraps, the\nadministrators, the governors, the\ncounselors, the treasurers, the judges,\nthe magistrates, and all the officials of\nthe provinces, to come to the dedication\nof\nthe\nimage\nwhich\nKing\nNebuchadnezzar had set up.\nThen King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his\nface, prostrate before Daniel, and\ncommanded that they should present an\noffering and incense to him.\nSo the satraps, the administrators, the\ngovernors,\nthe\ncounselors,\nthe\ntreasurers, the judges, the magistrates,\nand all the officials of the provinces\ngathered together for the dedication of\nthe image that King Nebuchadnezzar\nhad set up; and they stood before the\nimage that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\nThe king answered Daniel, and said,\n\"Truly your God is the God of gods, the\nLord of kings, and a revealer of secrets,\nsince you could reveal this secret.\"\nThen a herald cried aloud: \"To you it is\ncommanded, O peoples, nations, and\nlanguages,\nthat at the time you hear the sound of\nthe horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery,\nin symphony with all kinds of music, you\nshall fall down and worship the gold\nimage that King Nebuchadnezzar has\nset up;\nThen Nebuchadnezzar, in rage and\nfury, gave the command to bring\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego.\nSo they brought these men before the\nking.\nand whoever does not fall down and\nworship shall be cast immediately into\nthe midst of a burning fiery furnace.\"\nSo at that time, when all the people\nheard the sound of the horn, flute, harp,\nand lyre, in symphony with all kinds of\nmusic, all the people, nations, and\nlanguages fell down and worshiped the\ngold image which King Nebuchadnezzar\nhad set up.\nTherefore at that time certain\nChaldeans came forward and accused\nthe Jews.\nThey spoke and said to King\nNebuchadnezzar, \"O king, live forever!\nYou, O king, have made a decree that\neveryone who hears the sound of the\nhorn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in\nsymphony with all kinds of music, shall\nfall down and worship the gold image;\nand whoever does not fall down and\nworship shall be cast into the midst of a\nburning fiery furnace.\nThere are certain Jews whom you\nhave set over the affairs of the province\nof Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and\nAbed-Nego; these men, O king, have\nnot paid due regard to you. They do not\nserve your gods or worship the gold\nimage which you have set up.\"\nNebuchadnezzar spoke, saying to\nthem, \"Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach,\nand Abed-Nego, that you do not serve\nmy gods or worship the gold image\nwhich I have set up?\nNow if you are ready at the time you\nhear the sound of the horn, flute, harp,\nlyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all\nkinds of music, and you fall down and\nworship the image which I have made,\ngood! But if you do not worship, you\nshall be cast immediately into the midst\nof a burning fiery furnace. And who is\nthe god who will deliver you from my\nhands?\"\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego\nanswered and said to the king, \"O\nNebuchadnezzar, we have no need to\nanswer you in this matter.\nIf that is the case, our God whom we\nserve is able to deliver us from the\nburning fiery furnace, and He will deliver\nus from your hand, O king.\nBut if not, let it be known to you, O\nking, that we do not serve your gods,\nnor will we worship the gold image\nwhich you have set up.\"\nThen Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury,\nand the expression on his face changed\ntoward Shadrach, Meshach, and AbedNego. He spoke and commanded that\nthey heat the furnace seven times more\nthan it was usually heated.\nAnd he commanded certain mighty\nmen of valor who were in his army to\nbind Shadrach, Meshach, and AbedNego, and cast them into the burning\nfiery furnace.\nThen these men were bound in their\ncoats, their trousers, their turbans, and\ntheir other garments, and were cast into\nthe midst of the burning fiery furnace.\nAnd the satraps, administrators,\ngovernors, and the king's counselors\ngathered together, and they saw these\nmen on whose bodies the fire had no\npower; the hair of their head was not\nsinged nor were their garments affected,\nand the smell of fire was not on them.\nTherefore,\nbecause\nthe\nking's\ncommand was urgent, and the furnace\nexceedingly hot, the flame of the fire\nkilled those men who took up Shadrach,\nMeshach, and Abed-Nego.\nNebuchadnezzar\nspoke,\nsaying,\n\"Blessed be the God of Shadrach,\nMeshach, and Abed-Nego, who sent His\nAngel and delivered His servants who\ntrusted in Him, and they have frustrated\nthe king's word, and yielded their bodies,\nthat they should not serve nor worship\nany god except their own God!\nAnd these three men, Shadrach,\nMeshach, and Abed-Nego, fell down\nbound into the midst of the burning fiery\nfurnace.\nThen King Nebuchadnezzar was\nastonished; and he rose in haste and\nspoke, saying to his counselors, \"Did we\nnot cast three men bound into the midst\nof the fire?\" They answered and said to\nthe king, \"True, O king.\"\nTherefore I make a decree that any\npeople, nation, or language which\nspeaks anything amiss against the God\nof Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego\nshall be cut in pieces, and their houses\nshall be made an ash heap; because\nthere is no other God who can deliver\nlike this.\"\nThen the king promoted Shadrach,\nMeshach, and Abed-Nego in the\nprovince of Babylon.\n\"Look!\" he answered, \"I see four men\nloose, walking in the midst of the fire;\nand they are not hurt, and the form of\nthe fourth is like the Son of God.\"\nThen Nebuchadnezzar went near the\nmouth of the burning fiery furnace and\nspoke, saying, \"Shadrach, Meshach,\nand Abed-Nego, servants of the Most\nHigh God, come out, and come here.\"\nThen Shadrach, Meshach, and AbedNego came from the midst of the fire.\n4Nebuchadnezzar the king, To all\npeoples, nations, and languages that\ndwell in all the earth: Peace be\nmultiplied to you.\nI thought it good to declare the signs\nand wonders that the Most High God\nhas worked for me.\nHow great are His signs, And how\nmighty His wonders! His kingdom is an\neverlasting kingdom, And His dominion\nis from generation to generation.\nI, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my\nhouse, and flourishing in my palace.\nIts leaves were lovely, Its fruit\nabundant, And in it was food for all. The\nbeasts of the field found shade under it,\nThe birds of the heavens dwelt in its\nbranches, And all flesh was fed from it.\nI saw a dream which made me afraid,\nand the thoughts on my bed and the\nvisions of my head troubled me.\n\"I saw in the visions of my head while\non my bed, and there was a watcher, a\nholy one, coming down from heaven.\nTherefore I issued a decree to bring in\nall the wise men of Babylon before me,\nthat they might make known to me the\ninterpretation of the dream.\nHe cried aloud and said thus: \"Chop\ndown the tree and cut off its branches,\nStrip off its leaves and scatter its fruit.\nLet the beasts get out from under it, And\nthe birds from its branches.\nThen the magicians, the astrologers,\nthe Chaldeans, and the soothsayers\ncame in, and I told them the dream; but\nthey did not make known to me its\ninterpretation.\nBut at last Daniel came before me (his\nname is Belteshazzar, according to the\nname of my god; in him is the Spirit of\nthe Holy God), and I told the dream\nbefore him, saying:\nNevertheless leave the stump and\nroots in the earth, Bound with a band of\niron and bronze, In the tender grass of\nthe field. Let it be wet with the dew of\nheaven, And let him graze with the\nbeasts On the grass of the earth.\nLet his heart be changed from that of a\nman, Let him be given the heart of a\nbeast, And let seven times pass over\nhim.\n\"Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians,\nbecause I know that the Spirit of the\nHoly God is in you, and no secret\ntroubles you, explain to me the visions\nof my dream that I have seen, and its\ninterpretation.\n\"These were the visions of my head\nwhile on my bed: I was looking, and\nbehold, A tree in the midst of the earth,\nAnd its height was great.\nThe tree grew and became strong; Its\nheight reached to the heavens, And it\ncould be seen to the ends of all the\nearth.\n\"This decision is by the decree of the\nwatchers, And the sentence by the word\nof the holy ones, In order that the living\nmay know That the Most High rules in\nthe kingdom of men, Gives it to\nwhomever He will, And sets over it the\nlowest of men.'\n\"This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar,\nhave seen. Now you, Belteshazzar,\ndeclare its interpretation, since all the\nwise men of my kingdom are not able to\nmake known to me the interpretation;\nbut you are able, for the Spirit of the\nHoly God is in you.\"\nThen Daniel, whose name was\nBelteshazzar, was astonished for a time,\nand his thoughts troubled him. So the\nking spoke, and said, \"Belteshazzar, do\nnot let the dream or its interpretation\ntrouble you.\" Belteshazzar answered\nand said, \"My lord, may the dream\nconcern those who hate you, and its\ninterpretation concern your enemies!\n\"The tree that you saw, which grew\nand became strong, whose height\nreached to the heavens and which could\nbe seen by all the earth,\nwhose leaves were lovely and its fruit\nabundant, in which was food for all,\nunder which the beasts of the field dwelt,\nand in whose branches the birds of the\nheaven had their home-22\nlike oxen. They shall wet you with the\ndew of heaven, and seven times shall\npass over you, till you know that the\nMost High rules in the kingdom of men,\nand gives it to whomever He chooses.\n\"And inasmuch as they gave the\ncommand to leave the stump and roots\nof the tree, your kingdom shall be\nassured to you, after you come to know\nthat Heaven rules.\nTherefore, O king, let my advice be\nacceptable to you; break off your sins by\nbeing righteous, and your iniquities by\nshowing mercy to the poor. Perhaps\nthere may be a lengthening of your\nprosperity.\"\nAll\nthis\ncame\nNebuchadnezzar.\nupon\nKing\nit is you, O king, who have grown and\nbecome strong; for your greatness has\ngrown and reaches to the heavens, and\nyour dominion to the end of the earth.\nAt the end of the twelve months he\nwas walking about the royal palace of\nBabylon.\n\"And inasmuch as the king saw a\nwatcher, a holy one, coming down from\nheaven and saying, \"Chop down the\ntree and destroy it, but leave its stump\nand roots in the earth, bound with a\nband of iron and bronze in the tender\ngrass of the field; let it be wet with the\ndew of heaven, and let him graze with\nthe beasts of the field, till seven times\npass over him';\nthis is the interpretation, O king, and\nthis is the decree of the Most High,\nwhich has come upon my lord the king:\nThey shall drive you from men, your\ndwelling shall be with the beasts of the\nfield, and they shall make you eat grass\nThe king spoke, saying, \"Is not this\ngreat Babylon, that I have built for a\nroyal dwelling by my mighty power and\nfor the honor of my majesty?\"\nWhile the word was still in the king's\nmouth, a voice fell from heaven: \"King\nNebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken:\nthe kingdom has departed from you!\nAnd they shall drive you from men,\nand your dwelling shall be with the\nbeasts of the field. They shall make you\neat grass like oxen; and seven times\nshall pass over you, until you know that\nthe Most High rules in the kingdom of\nmen, and gives it to whomever He\nchooses.\"\ndrank wine in the presence of the\nthousand.\nThat very hour the word was fulfilled\nconcerning Nebuchadnezzar; he was\ndriven from men and ate grass like\noxen; his body was wet with the dew of\nheaven till his hair had grown like\neagles' feathers and his nails like birds'\nclaws.\nWhile he tasted the wine, Belshazzar\ngave the command to bring the gold and\nsilver vessels which his father\nNebuchadnezzar had taken from the\ntemple which had been in Jerusalem,\nthat the king and his lords, his wives,\nand his concubines might drink from\nthem.\nAnd at the end of the time I,\nNebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to\nheaven, and my understanding returned\nto me; and I blessed the Most High and\npraised and honored Him who lives\nforever: For His dominion is an\neverlasting dominion, And His kingdom\nis from generation to generation.\nThen they brought the gold vessels that\nhad been taken from the temple of the\nhouse of God which had been in\nJerusalem; and the king and his lords,\nhis wives, and his concubines drank\nfrom them.\nAll the inhabitants of the earth are\nreputed as nothing; He does according\nto His will in the army of heaven And\namong the inhabitants of the earth. No\none can restrain His hand Or say to Him,\n\"What have You done?\"\nAt the same time my reason returned\nto me, and for the glory of my kingdom,\nmy honor and splendor returned to me.\nMy counselors and nobles resorted to\nme, I was restored to my kingdom, and\nexcellent majesty was added to me.\nNow I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and\nextol and honor the King of heaven, all\nof whose works are truth, and His ways\njustice. And those who walk in pride He\nis able to put down.\n5Belshazzar the king made a great\nfeast for a thousand of his lords, and\nThey drank wine, and praised the gods\nof gold and silver, bronze and iron,\nwood and stone.\nIn the same hour the fingers of a man's\nhand appeared and wrote opposite the\nlampstand on the plaster of the wall of\nthe king's palace; and the king saw the\npart of the hand that wrote.\nThen the king's countenance changed,\nand his thoughts troubled him, so that\nthe joints of his hips were loosened and\nhis knees knocked against each other.\nThe king cried aloud to bring in the\nastrologers, the Chaldeans, and the\nsoothsayers. The king spoke, saying to\nthe wise men of Babylon, \"Whoever\nreads this writing, and tells me its\ninterpretation, shall be clothed with\npurple and have a chain of gold around\nhis neck; and he shall be the third ruler\nin the kingdom.\"\nNow all the king's wise men came, but\nthey could not read the writing, or make\nknown to the king its interpretation.\nThen King Belshazzar was greatly\ntroubled, his countenance was changed,\nand his lords were astonished.\nNow the wise men, the astrologers,\nhave been brought in before me, that\nthey should read this writing and make\nknown to me its interpretation, but they\ncould not give the interpretation of the\nthing.\nThe queen, because of the words of\nthe king and his lords, came to the\nbanquet hall. The queen spoke, saying,\n\"O king, live forever! Do not let your\nthoughts trouble you, nor let your\ncountenance change.\nAnd I have heard of you, that you can\ngive interpretations and explain enigmas.\nNow if you can read the writing and\nmake known to me its interpretation, you\nshall be clothed with purple and have a\nchain of gold around your neck, and\nshall be the third ruler in the kingdom.\"\nThere is a man in your kingdom in\nwhom is the Spirit of the Holy God. And\nin the days of your father, light and\nunderstanding and wisdom, like the\nwisdom of the gods, were found in him;\nand King Nebuchadnezzar your father-your father the king--made him chief of\nthe magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans,\nand soothsayers.\nThen Daniel answered, and said\nbefore the king, \"Let your gifts be for\nyourself, and give your rewards to\nanother; yet I will read the writing to the\nking, and make known to him the\ninterpretation.\nO king, the Most High God gave\nNebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom\nand majesty, glory and honor.\nInasmuch as an excellent spirit,\nknowledge, understanding, interpreting\ndreams, solving riddles, and explaining\nenigmas were found in this Daniel,\nwhom the king named Belteshazzar,\nnow let Daniel be called, and he will give\nthe interpretation.\"\nAnd because of the majesty that He\ngave him, all peoples, nations, and\nlanguages trembled and feared before\nhim. Whomever he wished, he\nexecuted; whomever he wished, he kept\nalive; whomever he wished, he set up;\nand whomever he wished, he put down.\nThen Daniel was brought in before the\nking. The king spoke, and said to Daniel,\n\"Are you that Daniel who is one of the\ncaptives from Judah, whom my father\nthe king brought from Judah?\nBut when his heart was lifted up, and\nhis spirit was hardened in pride, he was\ndeposed from his kingly throne, and\nthey took his glory from him.\nI have heard of you, that the Spirit of\nGod is in you, and that light and\nunderstanding and excellent wisdom are\nfound in you.\nThen he was driven from the sons of\nmen, his heart was made like the beasts,\nand his dwelling was with the wild\ndonkeys. They fed him with grass like\noxen, and his body was wet with the\ndew of heaven, till he knew that the\nMost High God rules in the kingdom of\nmen, and appoints over it whomever He\nchooses.\n\"But you his son, Belshazzar, have not\nhumbled your heart, although you knew\nall this.\nthat he should be the third ruler in the\nkingdom.\nThat very night Belshazzar, king of the\nChaldeans, was slain.\nAnd Darius the Mede received the\nkingdom, being about sixty-two years\nold.\nAnd you have lifted yourself up against\nthe Lord of heaven. They have brought\nthe vessels of His house before you,\nand you and your lords, your wives and\nyour concubines, have drunk wine from\nthem. And you have praised the gods of\nsilver and gold, bronze and iron, wood\nand stone, which do not see or hear or\nknow; and the God who holds your\nbreath in His hand and owns all your\nways, you have not glorified.\nand over these, three governors, of\nwhom Daniel was one, that the satraps\nmight give account to them, so that the\nking would suffer no loss.\nThen the fingers of the hand were sent\nfrom Him, and this writing was written.\n\"And this is the inscription that was\nwritten:\nMENE,\nMENE,\nTEKEL,\nUPHARSIN.\nThis is the interpretation of each word.\nMENE: God has numbered your\nkingdom, and finished it;\nTEKEL: You have been weighed in the\nbalances, and found wanting;\nPERES: Your kingdom has been\ndivided, and given to the Medes and\nPersians.\"\nThen Belshazzar gave the command,\nand they clothed Daniel with purple and\nput a chain of gold around his neck, and\nmade a proclamation concerning him\n6It pleased Darius to set over the\nkingdom one hundred and twenty\nsatraps, to be over the whole kingdom;\nThen this Daniel distinguished himself\nabove the governors and satraps,\nbecause an excellent spirit was in him;\nand the king gave thought to setting him\nover the whole realm.\nSo the governors and satraps sought to\nfind some charge against Daniel\nconcerning the kingdom; but they could\nfind no charge or fault, because he was\nfaithful; nor was there any error or fault\nfound in him.\nThen these men said, \"We shall not\nfind any charge against this Daniel\nunless we find it against him concerning\nthe law of his God.\"\nSo these governors and satraps\nthronged before the king, and said thus\nto him: \"King Darius, live forever!\nAll the governors of the kingdom, the\nadministrators\nand\nsatraps,\nthe\ncounselors\nand\nadvisors,\nhave\nconsulted together to establish a royal\nstatute and to make a firm decree, that\nwhoever petitions any god or man for\nthirty days, except you, O king, shall be\ncast into the den of lions.\nNow, O king, establish the decree and\nsign the writing, so that it cannot be\nchanged, according to the law of the\nMedes and Persians, which does not\nalter.\"\nTherefore King\nwritten decree.\nDarius\nsigned\nregard for you, O king, or for the decree\nthat you have signed, but makes his\npetition three times a day.\"\nAnd the king, when he heard these\nwords, was greatly displeased with\nhimself, and set his heart on Daniel to\ndeliver him; and he labored till the going\ndown of the sun to deliver him.\nThen these men approached the king,\nand said to the king, \"Know, O king, that\nit is the law of the Medes and Persians\nthat no decree or statute which the king\nestablishes may be changed.\"\nthe\nNow when Daniel knew that the writing\nwas signed, he went home. And in his\nupper room, with his windows open\ntoward Jerusalem, he knelt down on his\nknees three times that day, and prayed\nand gave thanks before his God, as was\nhis custom since early days.\nThen these men assembled and found\nDaniel praying and making supplication\nbefore his God.\nSo the king gave the command, and\nthey brought Daniel and cast him into\nthe den of lions. But the king spoke,\nsaying to Daniel, \"Your God, whom you\nserve continually, He will deliver you.\"\nThen a stone was brought and laid on\nthe mouth of the den, and the king\nsealed it with his own signet ring and\nwith the signets of his lords, that the\npurpose concerning Daniel might not be\nchanged.\nAnd they went before the king, and\nspoke concerning the king's decree:\n\"Have you not signed a decree that\nevery man who petitions any god or\nman within thirty days, except you, O\nking, shall be cast into the den of lions?\"\nThe king answered and said, \"The thing\nis true, according to the law of the\nMedes and Persians, which does not\nalter.\"\nSo they answered and said before the\nking, \"That Daniel, who is one of the\ncaptives from Judah, does not show due\nNow the king went to his palace and\nspent the night fasting; and no\nmusicians were brought before him.\nAlso his sleep went from him.\nThen the king arose very early in the\nmorning and went in haste to the den of\nlions.\nAnd when he came to the den, he\ncried out with a lamenting voice to\nDaniel. The king spoke, saying to Daniel,\n\"Daniel, servant of the living God, has\nyour God, whom you serve continually,\nbeen able to deliver you from the lions?\"\non earth, Who has delivered Daniel from\nthe power of the lions.\nThen Daniel said to the king, \"O king,\nlive forever!\nSo this Daniel prospered in the reign\nof Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the\nPersian.\nMy God sent His angel and shut the\nlions' mouths, so that they have not hurt\nme, because I was found innocent\nbefore Him; and also, O king, I have\ndone no wrong before you.\"\nNow the king was exceedingly glad for\nhim, and commanded that they should\ntake Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel\nwas taken up out of the den, and no\ninjury whatever was found on him,\nbecause he believed in his God.\nAnd the king gave the command, and\nthey brought those men who had\naccused Daniel, and they cast them into\nthe den of lions--them, their children,\nand their wives; and the lions\noverpowered them, and broke all their\nbones in pieces before they ever came\nto the bottom of the den.\nThen King Darius wrote: To all peoples,\nnations, and languages that dwell in all\nthe earth: Peace be multiplied to you.\nI make a decree that in every dominion\nof my kingdom men must tremble and\nfear before the God of Daniel. For He is\nthe living God, And steadfast forever;\nHis kingdom is the one which shall not\nbe destroyed, And His dominion shall\nendure to the end.\nHe delivers and rescues, And He\nworks signs and wonders In heaven and\n7In the first year of Belshazzar king of\nBabylon, Daniel had a dream and\nvisions of his head while on his bed.\nThen he wrote down the dream, telling\nthe main facts.\nDaniel spoke, saying, \"I saw in my\nvision by night, and behold, the four\nwinds of heaven were stirring up the\nGreat Sea.\nAnd four great beasts came up from the\nsea, each different from the other.\nThe first was like a lion, and had\neagle's wings. I watched till its wings\nwere plucked off; and it was lifted up\nfrom the earth and made to stand on\ntwo feet like a man, and a man's heart\nwas given to it.\n\"And suddenly another beast, a second,\nlike a bear. It was raised up on one side,\nand had three ribs in its mouth between\nits teeth. And they said thus to it: \"Arise,\ndevour much flesh!'\n\"After this I looked, and there was\nanother, like a leopard, which had on its\nback four wings of a bird. The beast also\nhad four heads, and dominion was given\nto it.\n\"After this I saw in the night visions,\nand behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and\nterrible, exceedingly strong. It had huge\niron teeth; it was devouring, breaking in\npieces, and trampling the residue with\nits feet. It was different from all the\nbeasts that were before it, and it had ten\nhorns.\nI was considering the horns, and there\nwas another horn, a little one, coming\nup among them, before whom three of\nthe first horns were plucked out by the\nroots. And there, in this horn, were eyes\nlike the eyes of a man, and a mouth\nspeaking pompous words.\n\"I watched till thrones were put in place,\nAnd the Ancient of Days was seated;\nHis garment was white as snow, And\nthe hair of His head was like pure wool.\nHis throne was a fiery flame, Its wheels\na burning fire;\nA fiery stream issued And came forth\nfrom before Him. A thousand thousands\nministered to Him; Ten thousand times\nten thousand stood before Him. The\ncourt was seated, And the books were\nopened.\n\"I watched then because of the sound\nof the pompous words which the horn\nwas speaking; I watched till the beast\nwas slain, and its body destroyed and\ngiven to the burning flame.\nAs for the rest of the beasts, they had\ntheir dominion taken away, yet their\nlives were prolonged for a season and a\ntime.\n\"I was watching in the night visions,\nAnd behold, One like the Son of Man,\nComing with the clouds of heaven! He\ncame to the Ancient of Days, And they\nbrought Him near before Him.\nThen to Him was given dominion and\nglory and a kingdom, That all peoples,\nnations, and languages should serve\nHim. His dominion is an everlasting\ndominion, Which shall not pass away,\nAnd His kingdom the one Which shall\nnot be destroyed.\n\"I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit\nwithin my body, and the visions of my\nhead troubled me.\nI came near to one of those who stood\nby, and asked him the truth of all this.\nSo he told me and made known to me\nthe interpretation of these things:\n\"Those great beasts, which are four,\nare four kings which arise out of the\nearth.\nBut the saints of the Most High shall\nreceive the kingdom, and possess the\nkingdom forever, even forever and ever.'\n\"Then I wished to know the truth about\nthe fourth beast, which was different\nfrom all the others, exceedingly dreadful,\nwith its teeth of iron and its nails of\nbronze, which devoured, broke in pieces,\nand trampled the residue with its feet;\nand the ten horns that were on its\nhead, and the other horn which came up,\nbefore which three fell, namely, that\nhorn which had eyes and a mouth which\nspoke\npompous\nwords,\nwhose\nappearance was greater than his fellows.\n\"I was watching; and the same horn\nwas making war against the saints, and\nprevailing against them,\nuntil the Ancient of Days came, and a\njudgment was made in favor of the\nsaints of the Most High, and the time\ncame for the saints to possess the\nkingdom.\n\"Thus he said: \"The fourth beast shall\nbe A fourth kingdom on earth, Which\nshall be different from all other\nkingdoms, And shall devour the whole\nearth, Trample it and break it in pieces.\nThe ten horns are ten kings Who shall\narise from this kingdom. And another\nshall rise after them; He shall be\ndifferent from the first ones, And shall\nsubdue three kings.\nHe shall speak pompous words\nagainst the Most High, Shall persecute\nthe saints of the Most High, And shall\nintend to change times and law. Then\nthe saints shall be given into his hand\nFor a time and times and half a time.\n\"But the court shall be seated, And\nthey shall take away his dominion, To\nconsume and destroy it forever.\nThen the kingdom and dominion, And\nthe greatness of the kingdoms under the\nwhole heaven, Shall be given to the\npeople, the saints of the Most High. His\nkingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And\nall dominions shall serve and obey Him.'\n\"This is the end of the account. As for\nme, Daniel, my thoughts greatly troubled\nme, and my countenance changed; but I\nkept the matter in my heart.\"\n8In the third year of the reign of King\nBelshazzar a vision appeared to me--to\nme, Daniel--after the one that appeared\nto me the first time.\nI saw in the vision, and it so happened\nwhile I was looking, that I was in\nShushan, the citadel, which is in the\nprovince of Elam; and I saw in the vision\nthat I was by the River Ulai.\nThen I lifted my eyes and saw, and\nthere, standing beside the river, was a\nram which had two horns, and the two\nhorns were high; but one was higher\nthan the other, and the higher one came\nup last.\nI saw the ram pushing westward,\nnorthward, and southward, so that no\nanimal could withstand him; nor was\nthere any that could deliver from his\nhand, but he did according to his will\nand became great.\nAnd as I was considering, suddenly a\nmale goat came from the west, across\nthe surface of the whole earth, without\ntouching the ground; and the goat had a\nnotable horn between his eyes.\nThen he came to the ram that had two\nhorns, which I had seen standing beside\nthe river, and ran at him with furious\npower.\nAnd I saw him confronting the ram; he\nwas moved with rage against him,\nattacked the ram, and broke his two\nhorns. There was no power in the ram to\nwithstand him, but he cast him down to\nthe ground and trampled him; and there\nwas no one that could deliver the ram\nfrom his hand.\nTherefore the male goat grew very\ngreat; but when he became strong, the\nlarge horn was broken, and in place of it\nfour notable ones came up toward the\nfour winds of heaven.\nAnd out of one of them came a little\nhorn which grew exceedingly great\ntoward the south, toward the east, and\ntoward the Glorious Land.\nAnd it grew up to the host of heaven;\nand it cast down some of the host and\nsome of the stars to the ground, and\ntrampled them.\nAnd he said to me, \"For two thousand\nthree hundred days; then the sanctuary\nshall be cleansed.\"\nThen it happened, when I, Daniel, had\nseen the vision and was seeking the\nmeaning, that suddenly there stood\nbefore me one having the appearance\nof a man.\nAnd I heard a man's voice between the\nbanks of the Ulai, who called, and said,\n\"Gabriel, make this man understand the\nvision.\"\nSo he came near where I stood, and\nwhen he came I was afraid and fell on\nmy face; but he said to me, \"Understand,\nson of man, that the vision refers to the\ntime of the end.\"\nHe even exalted himself as high as the\nPrince of the host; and by him the daily\nsacrifices were taken away, and the\nplace of His sanctuary was cast down.\nNow, as he was speaking with me, I\nwas in a deep sleep with my face to the\nground; but he touched me, and stood\nme upright.\nBecause of transgression, an army\nwas given over to the horn to oppose\nthe daily sacrifices; and he cast truth\ndown to the ground. He did all this and\nprospered.\nThen I heard a holy one speaking; and\nanother holy one said to that certain one\nwho was speaking, \"How long will the\nvision be, concerning the daily sacrifices\nand the transgression of desolation, the\ngiving of both the sanctuary and the\nhost to be trampled underfoot?\"\nAnd he said, \"Look, I am making\nknown to you what shall happen in the\nlatter time of the indignation; for at the\nappointed time the end shall be.\nThe ram which you saw, having the\ntwo horns--they are the kings of Media\nand Persia.\nAnd the male goat is the kingdom of\nGreece. The large horn that is between\nits eyes is the first king.\nAs for the broken horn and the four\nthat stood up in its place, four kingdoms\nshall arise out of that nation, but not with\nits power.\n\"And in the latter time of their kingdom,\nWhen the transgressors have reached\ntheir fullness, A king shall arise, Having\nfierce features, Who understands\nsinister schemes.\nThen I set my face toward the Lord God\nto make request by prayer and\nsupplications, with fasting, sackcloth,\nand ashes.\nHis power shall be mighty, but not by\nhis own power; He shall destroy fearfully,\nAnd shall prosper and thrive; He shall\ndestroy the mighty, and also the holy\npeople.\nAnd I prayed to the LORD my God, and\nmade confession, and said, \"O Lord,\ngreat and awesome God, who keeps\nHis covenant and mercy with those who\nlove Him, and with those who keep His\ncommandments,\n\"Through his cunning He shall cause\ndeceit to prosper under his rule; And he\nshall exalt himself in his heart. He shall\ndestroy many in their prosperity. He\nshall even rise against the Prince of\nprinces; But he shall be broken without\nhuman means.\n\"And the vision of the evenings and\nmornings Which was told is true;\nTherefore seal up the vision, For it\nrefers to many days in the future.\"\nAnd I, Daniel, fainted and was sick for\ndays; afterward I arose and went about\nthe king's business. I was astonished by\nthe vision, but no one understood it.\n9In the first year of Darius the son of\nAhasuerus, of the lineage of the Medes,\nwho was made king over the realm of\nthe Chaldeans-2\nin the first year of his reign I, Daniel,\nunderstood by the books the number of\nthe years specified by the word of the\nLORD through Jeremiah the prophet,\nthat He would accomplish seventy years\nin the desolations of Jerusalem.\nwe have sinned and committed iniquity,\nwe have done wickedly and rebelled,\neven by departing from Your precepts\nand Your judgments.\nNeither have we heeded Your servants\nthe prophets, who spoke in Your name\nto our kings and our princes, to our\nfathers and all the people of the land.\nO Lord, righteousness belongs to You,\nbut to us shame of face, as it is this day-to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants\nof Jerusalem and all Israel, those near\nand those far off in all the countries to\nwhich You have driven them, because\nof the unfaithfulness which they have\ncommitted against You.\n\"O Lord, to us belongs shame of face,\nto our kings, our princes, and our fathers,\nbecause we have sinned against You.\nTo the Lord our God belong mercy and\nforgiveness, though we have rebelled\nagainst Him.\nWe have not obeyed the voice of the\nLORD our God, to walk in His laws,\nwhich He set before us by His servants\nthe prophets.\nYes, all Israel has transgressed Your\nlaw, and has departed so as not to obey\nYour voice; therefore the curse and the\noath written in the Law of Moses the\nservant of God have been poured out on\nus, because we have sinned against\nHim.\nAnd He has confirmed His words,\nwhich He spoke against us and against\nour judges who judged us, by bringing\nupon us a great disaster; for under the\nwhole heaven such has never been\ndone as what has been done to\nJerusalem.\n\"As it is written in the Law of Moses, all\nthis disaster has come upon us; yet we\nhave not made our prayer before the\nLORD our God, that we might turn from\nour iniquities and understand Your truth.\nTherefore the LORD has kept the\ndisaster in mind, and brought it upon us;\nfor the LORD our God is righteous in all\nthe works which He does, though we\nhave not obeyed His voice.\nAnd now, O Lord our God, who\nbrought Your people out of the land of\nEgypt with a mighty hand, and made\nYourself a name, as it is this day--we\nhave sinned, we have done wickedly!\n\"O Lord, according to all Your\nrighteousness, I pray, let Your anger\nand Your fury be turned away from Your\ncity Jerusalem, Your holy mountain;\nbecause for our sins, and for the\niniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and\nYour people are a reproach to all those\naround us.\nNow therefore, our God, hear the\nprayer of Your servant, and his\nsupplications, and for the Lord's sake\ncause Your face to shine on Your\nsanctuary, which is desolate.\nO my God, incline Your ear and hear;\nopen Your eyes and see our desolations,\nand the city which is called by Your\nname; for we do not present our\nsupplications before You because of our\nrighteous deeds, but because of Your\ngreat mercies.\nO Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord,\nlisten and act! Do not delay for Your\nown sake, my God, for Your city and\nYour people are called by Your name.\"\nNow while I was speaking, praying,\nand confessing my sin and the sin of my\npeople Israel, and presenting my\nsupplication before the LORD my God\nfor the holy mountain of my God,\nyes, while I was speaking in prayer,\nthe man Gabriel, whom I had seen in\nthe vision at the beginning, being\ncaused to fly swiftly, reached me about\nthe time of the evening offering.\nAnd he informed me, and talked with\nme, and said, \"O Daniel, I have now\ncome forth to give you skill to\nunderstand.\nAt the beginning of your supplications\nthe command went out, and I have\ncome to tell you, for you are greatly\nbeloved; therefore consider the matter,\nand understand the vision:\n\"Seventy weeks are determined For\nyour people and for your holy city, To\nfinish the transgression, To make an\nend of sins, To make reconciliation for\niniquity, To bring in everlasting\nrighteousness, To seal up vision and\nprophecy, And to anoint the Most Holy.\nIn those days I, Daniel, was mourning\nthree full weeks.\n\"Know therefore and understand, That\nfrom the going forth of the command To\nrestore and build Jerusalem Until\nMessiah the Prince, There shall be\nseven weeks and sixty-two weeks; The\nstreet shall be built again, and the wall,\nEven in troublesome times.\n\"And after the sixty-two weeks\nMessiah shall be cut off, but not for\nHimself; And the people of the prince\nwho is to come Shall destroy the city\nand the sanctuary. The end of it shall be\nwith a flood, And till the end of the war\ndesolations are determined.\nThen he shall confirm a covenant with\nmany for one week; But in the middle of\nthe week He shall bring an end to\nsacrifice and offering. And on the wing\nof abominations shall be one who\nmakes desolate, Even until the\nconsummation, which is determined, Is\npoured out on the desolate.\"\n10In the third year of Cyrus king of\nPersia a message was revealed to\nDaniel, whose name was called\nBelteshazzar. The message was true,\nbut the appointed time was long; and he\nunderstood the message, and had\nunderstanding of the vision.\nI ate no pleasant food, no meat or wine\ncame into my mouth, nor did I anoint\nmyself at all, till three whole weeks were\nfulfilled.\nNow on the twenty-fourth day of the\nfirst month, as I was by the side of the\ngreat river, that is, the Tigris,\nI lifted my eyes and looked, and behold,\na certain man clothed in linen, whose\nwaist was girded with gold of Uphaz!\nHis body was like beryl, his face like the\nappearance of lightning, his eyes like\ntorches of fire, his arms and feet like\nburnished bronze in color, and the\nsound of his words like the voice of a\nmultitude.\nAnd I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for\nthe men who were with me did not see\nthe vision; but a great terror fell upon\nthem, so that they fled to hide\nthemselves.\nTherefore I was left alone when I saw\nthis great vision, and no strength\nremained in me; for my vigor was turned\nto frailty in me, and I retained no\nstrength.\nYet I heard the sound of his words; and\nwhile I heard the sound of his words I\nwas in a deep sleep on my face, with my\nface to the ground.\nSuddenly, a hand touched me, which\nmade me tremble on my knees and on\nthe palms of my hands.\nAnd he said to me, \"O Daniel, man\ngreatly beloved, understand the words\nthat I speak to you, and stand upright,\nfor I have now been sent to you.\" While\nhe was speaking this word to me, I\nstood trembling.\nThen he said to me, \"Do not fear,\nDaniel, for from the first day that you set\nyour heart to understand, and to humble\nyourself before your God, your words\nwere heard; and I have come because\nof your words.\nBut the prince of the kingdom of Persia\nwithstood me twenty-one days; and\nbehold, Michael, one of the chief princes,\ncame to help me, for I had been left\nalone there with the kings of Persia.\nNow I have come to make you\nunderstand what will happen to your\npeople in the latter days, for the vision\nrefers to many days yet to come.\"\nWhen he had spoken such words to\nme, I turned my face toward the ground\nand became speechless.\nAnd suddenly, one having the likeness\nof the sons of men touched my lips; then\nI opened my mouth and spoke, saying\nto him who stood before me, \"My lord,\nbecause of the vision my sorrows have\noverwhelmed me, and I have retained\nno strength.\nFor how can this servant of my lord\ntalk with you, my lord? As for me, no\nstrength remains in me now, nor is any\nbreath left in me.\"\nThen again, the one having the\nlikeness of a man touched me and\nstrengthened me.\nAnd he said, \"O man greatly beloved,\nfear not! Peace be to you; be strong,\nyes, be strong!\" So when he spoke to\nme I was strengthened, and said, \"Let\nmy lord speak, for you have\nstrengthened me.\"\nThen he said, \"Do you know why I\nhave come to you? And now I must\nreturn to fight with the prince of Persia;\nand when I have gone forth, indeed the\nprince of Greece will come.\nBut I will tell you what is noted in the\nScripture of Truth. (No one upholds me\nagainst these, except Michael your\nprince.\n11\"Also in the first year of Darius the\nMede, I, even I, stood up to confirm and\nstrengthen him.)\nAnd now I will tell you the truth: Behold,\nthree more kings will arise in Persia, and\nthe fourth shall be far richer than them\nall; by his strength, through his riches,\nhe shall stir up all against the realm of\nGreece.\nThen a mighty king shall arise, who\nshall rule with great dominion, and do\naccording to his will.\nAnd when he has arisen, his kingdom\nshall be broken up and divided toward\nthe four winds of heaven, but not among\nhis posterity nor according to his\ndominion with which he ruled; for his\nkingdom shall be uprooted, even for\nothers besides these.\n\"Also the king of the South shall\nbecome strong, as well as one of his\nprinces; and he shall gain power over\nhim and have dominion. His dominion\nshall be a great dominion.\nAnd at the end of some years they shall\njoin forces, for the daughter of the king\nof the South shall go to the king of the\nNorth to make an agreement; but she\nshall not retain the power of her\nauthority, and neither he nor his\nauthority shall stand; but she shall be\ngiven up, with those who brought her,\nand with him who begot her, and with\nhim who strengthened her in those\ntimes.\nBut from a branch of her roots one shall\narise in his place, who shall come with\nan army, enter the fortress of the king of\nthe North, and deal with them and\nprevail.\nAnd he shall also carry their gods\ncaptive to Egypt, with their princes and\ntheir precious articles of silver and gold;\nand he shall continue more years than\nthe king of the North.\n\"Also the king of the North shall come\nto the kingdom of the king of the South,\nbut shall return to his own land.\n\"And the king of the South shall be\nmoved with rage, and go out and fight\nwith him, with the king of the North, who\nshall muster a great multitude; but the\nmultitude shall be given into the hand of\nhis enemy.\nWhen he has taken away the multitude,\nhis heart will be lifted up; and he will\ncast down tens of thousands, but he will\nnot prevail.\nFor the king of the North will return\nand muster a multitude greater than the\nformer, and shall certainly come at the\nend of some years with a great army\nand much equipment.\n\"Now in those times many shall rise up\nagainst the king of the South. Also,\nviolent men of your people shall exalt\nthemselves in fulfillment of the vision,\nbut they shall fall.\nSo the king of the North shall come\nand build a siege mound, and take a\nfortified city; and the forces of the South\nshall not withstand him. Even his choice\ntroops shall have no strength to resist.\nBut he who comes against him shall\ndo according to his own will, and no one\nshall stand against him. He shall stand\nin the Glorious Land with destruction in\nhis power.\nHowever his sons shall stir up strife,\nand assemble a multitude of great\nforces; and one shall certainly come and\noverwhelm and pass through; then he\nshall return to his fortress and stir up\nstrife.\n\"He shall also set his face to enter with\nthe strength of his whole kingdom, and\nupright ones with him; thus shall he do.\nAnd he shall give him the daughter of\nwomen to destroy it; but she shall not\nstand with him, or be for him.\nAfter this he shall turn his face to the\ncoastlands, and shall take many.

He\nwent down to Joppa, and found a ship\ngoing to Tarshish; so he paid the fare,\nand went down into it, to go with them to\nTarshish from the presence of the\nLORD.\nBut the LORD sent out a great wind on\nthe sea, and there was a mighty\ntempest on the sea, so that the ship was\nabout to be broken up.\nThen the mariners were afraid; and\nevery man cried out to his god, and\nthrew the cargo that was in the ship into\nthe sea, to lighten the load. But Jonah\nhad gone down into the lowest parts of\nthe ship, had lain down, and was fast\nasleep.\nSo the captain came to him, and said to\nhim, \"What do you mean, sleeper? Arise,\ncall on your God; perhaps your God will\nconsider us, so that we may not perish.\"\nAnd they said to one another, \"Come,\nlet us cast lots, that we may know for\nwhose cause this trouble has come\nupon us.\" So they cast lots, and the lot\nfell on Jonah.\nThen they said to him, \"Please tell us!\nFor whose cause is this trouble upon\nus? What is your occupation? And\nwhere do you come from? What is your\ncountry? And of what people are you?\"\nSo he said to them, \"I am a Hebrew;\nand I fear the LORD, the God of heaven,\nwho made the sea and the dry land.\"\nThen the men were exceedingly afraid,\nand said to him, \"Why have you done\nthis?\" For the men knew that he fled\nfrom the presence of the LORD,\nbecause he had told them.\nThen they said to him, \"What shall we\ndo to you that the sea may be calm for\nus?\"--for the sea was growing more\ntempestuous.\nAnd he said to them, \"Pick me up and\nthrow me into the sea; then the sea will\nbecome calm for you. For I know that\nthis great tempest is because of me.\"\nNevertheless the men rowed hard to\nreturn to land, but they could not, for the\nsea\ncontinued\nto\ngrow\nmore\ntempestuous against them.\nTherefore they cried out to the LORD\nand said, \"We pray, O LORD, please do\nnot let us perish for this man's life, and\ndo not charge us with innocent blood;\nfor You, O LORD, have done as it\npleased You.\"\nSo they picked up Jonah and threw\nhim into the sea, and the sea ceased\nfrom its raging.\n\"When my soul fainted within me, I\nremembered the LORD; And my prayer\nwent up to You, Into Your holy temple.\nThen the men feared the LORD\nexceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to\nthe LORD and took vows.\n\"Those who regard worthless idols\nForsake their own Mercy.\nNow the LORD had prepared a great\nfish to swallow Jonah.

Salvation is of the LORD.\"\nSo the LORD spoke to the fish, and it\nvomited Jonah onto dry land.\n3Now the word of the LORD came to\nJonah the second time, saying,\nAnd he said: \"I cried out to the LORD\nbecause of my affliction, And He\nanswered me. \"Out of the belly of Sheol\nI cried, And You heard my voice.\n\"Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city,\nand preach to it the message that I tell\nyou.\"\nFor You cast me into the deep, Into the\nheart of the seas, And the floods\nsurrounded me; All Your billows and\nYour waves passed over me.\nSo Jonah arose and went to Nineveh,\naccording to the word of the LORD. Now\nNineveh was an exceedingly great city,\na three-day journey in extent.\nThen I said, \"I have been cast out of\nYour sight; Yet I will look again toward\nYour holy temple.'\nThe waters surrounded me, even to my\nsoul; The deep closed around me;\nWeeds were wrapped around my head.\nI went down to the moorings of the\nmountains; The earth with its bars\nclosed behind me forever; Yet You have\nbrought up my life from the pit, O LORD,\nmy God.\nAnd Jonah began to enter the city on\nthe first day's walk. Then he cried out\nand said, \"Yet forty days, and Nineveh\nshall be overthrown!\"\nSo the people of Nineveh believed God,\nproclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth,\nfrom the greatest to the least of them.\nThen word came to the king of\nNineveh; and he arose from his throne\nand laid aside his robe, covered himself\nwith sackcloth and sat in ashes.\nAnd he caused it to be proclaimed and\npublished throughout Nineveh by the\ndecree of the king and his nobles,\nsaying, Let neither man nor beast, herd\nnor flock, taste anything; do not let them\neat, or drink water.\nSo Jonah went out of the city and sat\non the east side of the city. There he\nmade himself a shelter and sat under it\nin the shade, till he might see what\nwould become of the city.\nBut let man and beast be covered with\nsackcloth, and cry mightily to God; yes,\nlet every one turn from his evil way and\nfrom the violence that is in his hands.\nAnd the LORD God prepared a plant\nand made it come up over Jonah, that it\nmight be shade for his head to deliver\nhim from his misery. So Jonah was very\ngrateful for the plant.\nWho can tell if God will turn and relent,\nand turn away from His fierce anger, so\nthat we may not perish?\nBut as morning dawned the next day\nGod prepared a worm, and it so\ndamaged the plant that it withered.\nThen God saw their works, that they\nturned from their evil way; and God\nrelented from the disaster that He had\nsaid He would bring upon them, and He\ndid not do it.\n4But it displeased Jonah exceedingly,\nand he became angry.\nSo he prayed to the LORD, and said,\n\"Ah, LORD, was not this what I said\nwhen I was still in my country?\nTherefore I fled previously to Tarshish;\nfor I know that You are a gracious and\nmerciful God, slow to anger and\nabundant in lovingkindness, One who\nrelents from doing harm.\nTherefore now, O LORD, please take\nmy life from me, for it is better for me to\ndie than to live!\"\nThen the LORD said, \"Is it right for you\nto be angry?\"\nAnd it happened, when the sun arose,\nthat God prepared a vehement east\nwind; and the sun beat on Jonah's head,\nso that he grew faint. Then he wished\ndeath for himself, and said, \"It is better\nfor me to die than to live.\"\nThen God said to Jonah, \"Is it right for\nyou to be angry about the plant?\" And\nhe said, \"It is right for me to be angry,\neven to death!\"\nBut the LORD said, \"You have had pity\non the plant for which you have not\nlabored, nor made it grow, which came\nup in a night and perished in a night.\nAnd should I not pity Nineveh, that\ngreat city, in which are more than one\nhundred and twenty thousand persons\nwho cannot discern between their right\nhand\nand\ntheir\nleft--and\nmuch\nlivestock?\"\nMicah\n1The word of the LORD that came to\nMicah of Moresheth in the days of\nJotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of\nJudah, which he saw concerning\nSamaria and Jerusalem.\nHear, all you peoples!

My soul loathed them, and their\nsoul also abhorred me.\nThen I said, \"I will not feed you. Let\nwhat is dying die, and what is perishing\nperish.

For I\nsay to you that God is able to raise up\nchildren to Abraham from these stones.\nAnd even now the ax is laid to the root\nof the trees. Therefore every tree which\ndoes not bear good fruit is cut down and\nthrown into the fire.\nBut Jesus answered and said to him,\n\"Permit it to be so now, for thus it is\nfitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.\"\nThen he allowed Him.\nWhen He had been baptized, Jesus\ncame up immediately from the water;\nand behold, the heavens were opened\nto Him, and He saw the Spirit of God\ndescending like a dove and alighting\nupon Him.\nAnd suddenly a voice came from\nheaven, saying, \"This is My beloved Son,\nin whom I am well pleased.\"\n4Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit\ninto the wilderness to be tempted by the\ndevil.\nI indeed baptize you with water unto\nrepentance, but He who is coming after\nme is mightier than I, whose sandals I\nam not worthy to carry. He will baptize\nyou with the Holy Spirit and fire.\nHis winnowing fan is in His hand, and\nHe will thoroughly clean out His\nthreshing floor, and gather His wheat\ninto the barn; but He will burn up the\nchaff with unquenchable fire.\"\nThen Jesus came from Galilee to John\nat the Jordan to be baptized by him.\nAnd when He had fasted forty days and\nforty nights, afterward He was hungry.\nNow when the tempter came to Him, he\nsaid, \"If You are the Son of God,\ncommand that these stones become\nbread.\"\nBut He answered and said, \"It is written,\n\"Man shall not live by bread alone, but\nby every word that proceeds from the\nmouth of God.\"'\nThen the devil took Him up into the holy\ncity, set Him on the pinnacle of the\ntemple,\nand said to Him, \"If You are the Son of\nGod, throw Yourself down. For it is\nwritten: \"He shall give His angels charge\nover you,' and, \"In their hands they shall\nbear you up, Lest you dash your foot\nagainst a stone.\"'\nJesus said to him, \"It is written again,\n\"You shall not tempt the LORD your\nGod.\"'\nAgain, the devil took Him up on an\nexceedingly high mountain, and showed\nHim all the kingdoms of the world and\ntheir glory.\nThe people who sat in darkness have\nseen a great light, And upon those who\nsat in the region and shadow of death\nLight has dawned.\"\nFrom that time Jesus began to preach\nand to say, \"Repent, for the kingdom of\nheaven is at hand.\"\nAnd Jesus, walking by the Sea of\nGalilee, saw two brothers, Simon called\nPeter, and Andrew his brother, casting a\nnet into the sea; for they were fishermen.\nThen He said to them, \"Follow Me, and\nI will make you fishers of men.\"\nAnd he said to Him, \"All these things I\nwill give You if You will fall down and\nworship me.\"\nThey immediately left their nets and\nfollowed Him.\nThen Jesus said to him, \"Away with\nyou, Satan! For it is written, \"You shall\nworship the LORD your God, and Him\nonly you shall serve.\"'\nThen the devil left Him, and behold,\nangels came and ministered to Him.\nNow when Jesus heard that John had\nbeen put in prison, He departed to\nGalilee.\nAnd leaving Nazareth, He came and\ndwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea,\nin the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,\nGoing on from there, He saw two other\nbrothers, James the son of Zebedee,\nand John his brother, in the boat with\nZebedee their father, mending their nets.\nHe called them,\nand immediately they left the boat and\ntheir father, and followed Him.\nAnd Jesus went about all Galilee,\nteaching in their synagogues, preaching\nthe gospel of the kingdom, and healing\nall kinds of sickness and all kinds of\ndisease among the people.\nthat it might be fulfilled which was\nspoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:\n\"The land of Zebulun and the land of\nNaphtali, By the way of the sea, beyond\nthe Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:\nThen His fame went throughout all\nSyria; and they brought to Him all sick\npeople who were afflicted with various\ndiseases and torments, and those who\nwere demon-possessed, epileptics, and\nparalytics; and He healed them.\nGreat multitudes followed Him--from\nGalilee, and from Decapolis, Jerusalem,\nJudea, and beyond the Jordan.\n5And seeing the multitudes, He went\nup on a mountain, and when He was\nseated His disciples came to Him.\nThen He opened His mouth and taught\nthem, saying:\n\"Blessed are the poor in spirit, For\ntheirs is the kingdom of heaven.\nBlessed are those who mourn, For they\nshall be comforted.\nBlessed are the meek, For they shall\ninherit the earth.\nBlessed are those who hunger and\nthirst for righteousness, For they shall\nbe filled.\nBlessed are the merciful, For they shall\nobtain mercy.\nBlessed are the pure in heart, For they\nshall see God.\nRejoice and be exceedingly glad, for\ngreat is your reward in heaven, for so\nthey persecuted the prophets who were\nbefore you.\n\"You are the salt of the earth; but if the\nsalt loses its flavor, how shall it be\nseasoned? It is then good for nothing\nbut to be thrown out and trampled\nunderfoot by men.\n\"You are the light of the world. A city\nthat is set on a hill cannot be hidden.\nNor do they light a lamp and put it\nunder a basket, but on a lampstand, and\nit gives light to all who are in the house.\nLet your light so shine before men,\nthat they may see your good works and\nglorify your Father in heaven.\n\"Do not think that I came to destroy the\nLaw or the Prophets. I did not come to\ndestroy but to fulfill.\nFor assuredly, I say to you, till heaven\nand earth pass away, one jot or one\ntittle will by no means pass from the law\ntill all is fulfilled.\nBlessed are the peacemakers, For they\nshall be called sons of God.\nBlessed are those who are persecuted\nfor righteousness' sake, For theirs is the\nkingdom of heaven.\nWhoever therefore breaks one of the\nleast of these commandments, and\nteaches men so, shall be called least in\nthe kingdom of heaven; but whoever\ndoes and teaches them, he shall be\ncalled great in the kingdom of heaven.\n\"Blessed are you when they revile and\npersecute you, and say all kinds of evil\nagainst you falsely for My sake.\nFor I say to you, that unless your\nrighteousness\nexceeds\nthe\nrighteousness of the scribes and\nPharisees, you will by no means enter\nthe kingdom of heaven.\n\"You have heard that it was said to\nthose of old, \"You shall not murder, and\nwhoever murders will be in danger of\nthe judgment.'\nBut I say to you that whoever is angry\nwith his brother without a cause shall be\nin danger of the judgment. And whoever\nsays to his brother, \"Raca!' shall be in\ndanger of the council. But whoever says,\n\"You fool!' shall be in danger of hell fire.\nTherefore if you bring your gift to the\naltar, and there remember that your\nbrother has something against you,\nleave your gift there before the altar,\nand go your way.

Otherwise you have no reward\nfrom your Father in heaven.\nTherefore, when you do a charitable\ndeed, do not sound a trumpet before\nyou as the hypocrites do in the\nsynagogues and in the streets, that they\nmay have glory from men. Assuredly, I\nsay to you, they have their reward.\nBut when you do a charitable deed, do\nnot let your left hand know what your\nright hand is doing,\nthat your charitable deed may be in\nsecret; and your Father who sees in\nsecret will Himself reward you openly.\n\"And when you pray, you shall not be\nlike the hypocrites. For they love to pray\nstanding in the synagogues and on the\ncorners of the streets, that they may be\nseen by men. Assuredly, I say to you,\nthey have their reward.\nFor if you love those who love you,\nwhat reward have you? Do not even the\ntax collectors do the same?\nBut you, when you pray, go into your\nroom, and when you have shut your\ndoor, pray to your Father who is in the\nsecret place; and your Father who sees\nin secret will reward you openly.\nAnd if you greet your brethren only,\nwhat do you do more than others? Do\nnot even the tax collectors do so?\nAnd when you pray, do not use vain\nrepetitions as the heathen do. For they\nthink that they will be heard for their\nmany words.\nTherefore you shall be perfect, just as\nyour Father in heaven is perfect.\n\"Therefore do not be like them. For\nyour Father knows the things you have\nneed of before you ask Him.\nIn this manner, therefore, pray: Our\nFather in heaven, Hallowed be Your\nname.\nbut lay up for yourselves treasures in\nheaven, where neither moth nor rust\ndestroys and where thieves do not\nbreak in and steal.\nYour kingdom come. Your will be done\nOn earth as it is in heaven.\nFor where your treasure is, there your\nheart will be also.\nGive us this day our daily bread.\nAnd forgive us our debts, As we\nforgive our debtors.\n\"The lamp of the body is the eye. If\ntherefore your eye is good, your whole\nbody will be full of light.\nAnd do not lead us into temptation, But\ndeliver us from the evil one.

If therefore the\nlight that is in you is darkness, how\ngreat is that darkness!\n\"For if you forgive men their\ntrespasses, your heavenly Father will\nalso forgive you.\nBut if you do not forgive men their\ntrespasses, neither will your Father\nforgive your trespasses.\n\"Moreover, when you fast, do not be\nlike the hypocrites, with a sad\ncountenance. For they disfigure their\nfaces that they may appear to men to be\nfasting. Assuredly, I say to you, they\nhave their reward.\nBut you, when you fast, anoint your\nhead and wash your face,\nso that you do not appear to men to be\nfasting, but to your Father who is in the\nsecret place; and your Father who sees\nin secret will reward you openly.\n\"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures\non earth, where moth and rust destroy\nand where thieves break in and steal;\n\"No one can serve two masters; for\neither he will hate the one and love the\nother, or else he will be loyal to the one\nand despise the other. You cannot serve\nGod and mammon.\n\"Therefore I say to you, do not worry\nabout your life, what you will eat or what\nyou will drink; nor about your body, what\nyou will put on. Is not life more than food\nand the body more than clothing?\nLook at the birds of the air, for they\nneither sow nor reap nor gather into\nbarns; yet your heavenly Father feeds\nthem. Are you not of more value than\nthey?\nWhich of you by worrying can add one\ncubit to his stature?\n\"So why do you worry about clothing?\nConsider the lilies of the field, how they\ngrow: they neither toil nor spin;\nand yet I say to you that even\nSolomon in all his glory was not arrayed\nlike one of these.\nHypocrite! First remove the plank from\nyour own eye, and then you will see\nclearly to remove the speck from your\nbrother's eye.\nNow if God so clothes the grass of the\nfield, which today is, and tomorrow is\nthrown into the oven, will He not much\nmore clothe you, O you of little faith?\n\"Do not give what is holy to the dogs;\nnor cast your pearls before swine, lest\nthey trample them under their feet, and\nturn and tear you in pieces.\n\"Therefore do not worry, saying, \"What\nshall we eat?' or \"What shall we drink?'\nor \"What shall we wear?'\n\"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek,\nand you will find; knock, and it will be\nopened to you.\nFor after all these things the Gentiles\nseek. For your heavenly Father knows\nthat you need all these things.\nFor everyone who asks receives, and\nhe who seeks finds, and to him who\nknocks it will be opened.\nBut seek first the kingdom of God and\nHis righteousness, and all these things\nshall be added to you.\nOr what man is there among you who,\nif his son asks for bread, will give him a\nstone?\nTherefore do not worry about\ntomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about\nits own things. Sufficient for the day is\nits own trouble.\nOr if he asks for a fish, will he give him\na serpent?\n7\"Judge not, that you be not judged.\nFor with what judgment you judge, you\nwill be judged; and with the measure\nyou use, it will be measured back to you.\nAnd why do you look at the speck in\nyour brother's eye, but do not consider\nthe plank in your own eye?\nOr how can you say to your brother,\n\"Let me remove the speck from your\neye'; and look, a plank is in your own\neye?\nIf you then, being evil, know how to\ngive good gifts to your children, how\nmuch more will your Father who is in\nheaven give good things to those who\nask Him!\nTherefore, whatever you want men to\ndo to you, do also to them, for this is the\nLaw and the Prophets.\n\"Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is\nthe gate and broad is the way that leads\nto destruction, and there are many who\ngo in by it.\nBecause narrow is the gate and\ndifficult is the way which leads to life,\nand there are few who find it.\n\"Beware of false prophets, who come\nto you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly\nthey are ravenous wolves.\n\"But everyone who hears these\nsayings of Mine, and does not do them,\nwill be like a foolish man who built his\nhouse on the sand:\nYou will know them by their fruits.

And great was its\nfall.\"\nA good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor\ncan a bad tree bear good fruit.\nAnd so it was, when Jesus had ended\nthese sayings, that the people were\nastonished at His teaching,\nEvery tree that does not bear good\nfruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\nfor He taught them as one having\nauthority, and not as the scribes.\n8When He had come down from the\nTherefore by their fruits you will know\nthem.\nmountain, great multitudes followed Him.\n\"Not everyone who says to Me, \"Lord,\nLord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven,\nbut he who does the will of My Father in\nheaven.\nAnd behold, a leper came and\nworshiped Him, saying, \"Lord, if You are\nwilling, You can make me clean.\"\nMany will say to Me in that day, \"Lord,\nLord, have we not prophesied in Your\nname, cast out demons in Your name,\nand done many wonders in Your name?'\nThen Jesus put out His hand and\ntouched him, saying, \"I am willing; be\ncleansed.\" Immediately his leprosy was\ncleansed.\nAnd then I will declare to them, \"I\nnever knew you; depart from Me, you\nwho practice lawlessness!'\n\"Therefore whoever hears these\nsayings of Mine, and does them, I will\nliken him to a wise man who built his\nhouse on the rock:\nand the rain descended, the floods\ncame, and the winds blew and beat on\nthat house; and it did not fall, for it was\nfounded on the rock.\nAnd Jesus said to him, \"See that you\ntell no one; but go your way, show\nyourself to the priest, and offer the gift\nthat Moses commanded, as a testimony\nto them.\"\nNow when Jesus had entered\nCapernaum, a centurion came to Him,\npleading with Him,\nsaying, \"Lord, my servant is lying at\nhome paralyzed, dreadfully tormented.\"\nAnd Jesus said to him, \"I will come and\nheal him.\"\npossessed. And He cast out the spirits\nwith a word, and healed all who were\nsick,\nThe centurion answered and said,\n\"Lord, I am not worthy that You should\ncome under my roof. But only speak a\nword, and my servant will be healed.\nthat it might be fulfilled which was\nspoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:\n\"He Himself took our infirmities And bore\nour sicknesses.\"\nFor I also am a man under authority,\nhaving soldiers under me. And I say to\nthis one, \"Go,' and he goes; and to\nanother, \"Come,' and he comes; and to\nmy servant, \"Do this,' and he does it.\"\nAnd when Jesus saw great multitudes\nabout Him, He gave a command to\ndepart to the other side.\nWhen Jesus heard it, He marveled,\nand said to those who followed,\n\"Assuredly, I say to you, I have not\nfound such great faith, not even in\nIsrael!\nAnd I say to you that many will come\nfrom east and west, and sit down with\nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the\nkingdom of heaven.\nThen a certain scribe came and said to\nHim, \"Teacher, I will follow You\nwherever You go.\"\nAnd Jesus said to him, \"Foxes have\nholes and birds of the air have nests,\nbut the Son of Man has nowhere to lay\nHis head.\"\nThen another of His disciples said to\nHim, \"Lord, let me first go and bury my\nfather.\"\nBut the sons of the kingdom will be\ncast out into outer darkness. There will\nbe weeping and gnashing of teeth.\"\nBut Jesus said to him, \"Follow Me, and\nlet the dead bury their own dead.\"\nThen Jesus said to the centurion, \"Go\nyour way; and as you have believed, so\nlet it be done for you.\" And his servant\nwas healed that same hour.\nNow when Jesus had come into\nPeter's house, He saw his wife's mother\nlying sick with a fever.\nNow when He got into a boat, His\ndisciples followed Him.\nAnd suddenly a great tempest arose\non the sea, so that the boat was\ncovered with the waves. But He was\nasleep.\nSo He touched her hand, and the fever\nleft her. And she arose and served them.\nThen His disciples came to Him and\nawoke Him, saying, \"Lord, save us! We\nare perishing!\"\nWhen evening had come, they brought\nto Him many who were demon-\nBut He said to them, \"Why are you\nfearful, O you of little faith?\" Then He\narose and rebuked the winds and the\nsea, and there was a great calm.\nSo the men marveled, saying, \"Who\ncan this be, that even the winds and the\nsea obey Him?\"\nWhen He had come to the other side,\nto the country of the Gergesenes, there\nmet Him two demon-possessed men,\ncoming out of the tombs, exceedingly\nfierce, so that no one could pass that\nway.\nAnd suddenly they cried out, saying,\n\"What have we to do with You, Jesus,\nYou Son of God? Have You come here\nto torment us before the time?\"\nNow a good way off from them there\nwas a herd of many swine feeding.\nSo the demons begged Him, saying,\n\"If You cast us out, permit us to go away\ninto the herd of swine.\"\nAnd He said to them, \"Go.\" So when\nthey had come out, they went into the\nherd of swine. And suddenly the whole\nherd of swine ran violently down the\nsteep place into the sea, and perished in\nthe water.\nThen those who kept them fled; and\nthey went away into the city and told\neverything,\nincluding\nwhat\nhad\nhappened to the demon-possessed men.\nAnd behold, the whole city came out to\nmeet Jesus. And when they saw Him,\nthey begged Him to depart from their\nregion.\n9So He got into a boat, crossed over,\nand came to His own city.\nThen behold, they brought to Him a\nparalytic lying on a bed. When Jesus\nsaw their faith, He said to the paralytic,\n\"Son, be of good cheer; your sins are\nforgiven you.\"\nAnd at once some of the scribes said\nwithin\nthemselves,\n\"This\nMan\nblasphemes!\"\nBut Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said,\n\"Why do you think evil in your hearts?\nFor which is easier, to say, \"Your sins\nare forgiven you,' or to say, \"Arise and\nwalk'?\nBut that you may know that the Son of\nMan has power on earth to forgive sins\"-then He said to the paralytic, \"Arise,\ntake up your bed, and go to your\nhouse.\"\nAnd he arose and departed to his\nhouse.\nNow when the multitudes saw it, they\nmarveled and glorified God, who had\ngiven such power to men.\nAs Jesus passed on from there, He\nsaw a man named Matthew sitting at the\ntax office. And He said to him, \"Follow\nMe.\" So he arose and followed Him.\nNow it happened, as Jesus sat at the\ntable in the house, that behold, many\ntax collectors and sinners came and sat\ndown with Him and His disciples.\nAnd when the Pharisees saw it, they\nsaid to His disciples, \"Why does your\nTeacher eat with tax collectors and\nsinners?\"\nWhen Jesus heard that, He said to\nthem, \"Those who are well have no\nneed of a physician, but those who are\nsick.\nBut go and learn what this means: \"I\ndesire mercy and not sacrifice.' For I did\nnot come to call the righteous, but\nsinners, to repentance.\"\nThen the disciples of John came to\nHim, saying, \"Why do we and the\nPharisees fast often, but Your disciples\ndo not fast?\"\nAnd Jesus said to them, \"Can the\nfriends of the bridegroom mourn as long\nas the bridegroom is with them? But the\ndays will come when the bridegroom will\nbe taken away from them, and then they\nwill fast.\nSo Jesus arose and followed him, and\nso did His disciples.\nAnd suddenly, a woman who had a\nflow of blood for twelve years came from\nbehind and touched the hem of His\ngarment.\nFor she said to herself, \"If only I may\ntouch His garment, I shall be made\nwell.\"\nBut Jesus turned around, and when\nHe saw her He said, \"Be of good cheer,\ndaughter; your faith has made you well.\"\nAnd the woman was made well from\nthat hour.\nWhen Jesus came into the ruler's\nhouse, and saw the flute players and the\nnoisy crowd wailing,\nHe said to them, \"Make room, for the\ngirl is not dead, but sleeping.\" And they\nridiculed Him.\nNo one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth\non an old garment; for the patch pulls\naway from the garment, and the tear is\nmade worse.\nNor do they put new wine into old\nwineskins, or else the wineskins break,\nthe wine is spilled, and the wineskins\nare ruined. But they put new wine into\nnew wineskins, and both are preserved.\"\nWhile He spoke these things to them,\nbehold, a ruler came and worshiped Him,\nsaying, \"My daughter has just died, but\ncome and lay Your hand on her and she\nwill live.\"\nBut when the crowd was put outside,\nHe went in and took her by the hand,\nand the girl arose.\nAnd the report of this went out into all\nthat land.\nWhen Jesus departed from there, two\nblind men followed Him, crying out and\nsaying, \"Son of David, have mercy on\nus!\"\nAnd when He had come into the house,\nthe blind men came to Him. And Jesus\nsaid to them, \"Do you believe that I am\nable to do this?\" They said to Him, \"Yes,\nLord.\"\nThen He touched their eyes, saying,\n\"According to your faith let it be to you.\"\n10And when He had called His\nAnd their eyes were opened. And\nJesus sternly warned them, saying,\n\"See that no one knows it.\"\ntwelve disciples to Him, He gave them\npower over unclean spirits, to cast them\nout, and to heal all kinds of sickness and\nall kinds of disease.\nBut when they had departed, they\nspread the news about Him in all that\ncountry.\nAs they went out, behold, they brought\nto Him a man, mute and demonpossessed.\nAnd when the demon was cast out, the\nmute spoke. And the multitudes\nmarveled, saying, \"It was never seen\nlike this in Israel!\"\nBut the Pharisees said, \"He casts out\ndemons by the ruler of the demons.\"\nThen Jesus went about all the cities\nand\nvillages,\nteaching\nin\ntheir\nsynagogues, preaching the gospel of\nthe kingdom, and healing every\nsickness and every disease among the\npeople.\nNow the names of the twelve apostles\nare these: first, Simon, who is called\nPeter, and Andrew his brother; James\nthe son of Zebedee, and John his\nbrother;\nPhilip and Bartholomew; Thomas and\nMatthew the tax collector; James the\nson of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose\nsurname was Thaddaeus;\nSimon the Cananite, and Judas Iscariot,\nwho also betrayed Him.\nThese twelve Jesus sent out and\ncommanded them, saying: \"Do not go\ninto the way of the Gentiles, and do not\nenter a city of the Samaritans.\nBut go rather to the lost sheep of the\nhouse of Israel.\nBut when He saw the multitudes, He\nwas moved with compassion for them,\nbecause they were weary and scattered,\nlike sheep having no shepherd.\nThen He said to His disciples, \"The\nharvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers\nare few.\nTherefore pray the Lord of the harvest\nto send out laborers into His harvest.\"\nAnd as you go, preach, saying, \"The\nkingdom of heaven is at hand.'\nHeal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise\nthe dead, cast out demons. Freely you\nhave received, freely give.\nProvide neither gold nor silver nor\ncopper in your money belts,\nnor bag for your journey, nor two\ntunics, nor sandals, nor staffs; for a\nworker is worthy of his food.\n\"Now whatever city or town you enter,\ninquire who in it is worthy, and stay\nthere till you go out.\nchildren will rise up against parents and\ncause them to be put to death.\nAnd when you go into a household,\ngreet it.\nAnd you will be hated by all for My\nname's sake.

Their ears are hard of\nhearing, And their eyes they have\nclosed, Lest they should see with their\neyes and hear with their ears, Lest they\nshould understand with their hearts and\nturn, So that I should heal them.'\nBut blessed are your eyes for they see,\nand your ears for they hear;\nfor assuredly, I say to you that many\nprophets and righteous men desired to\nsee what you see, and did not see it,\nand to hear what you hear, and did not\nhear it.\nHe who has ears to hear, let him hear!\"\nAnd the disciples came and said to\nHim, \"Why do You speak to them in\nparables?\"\nHe answered and said to them,\n\"Because it has been given to you to\nknow the mysteries of the kingdom of\nheaven, but to them it has not been\ngiven.\nFor whoever has, to him more will be\ngiven, and he will have abundance; but\nwhoever does not have, even what he\nhas will be taken away from him.\nTherefore I speak to them in parables,\nbecause seeing they do not see, and\nhearing they do not hear, nor do they\nunderstand.\nAnd in them the prophecy of Isaiah is\nfulfilled, which says: \"Hearing you will\nhear and shall not understand, And\nseeing you will see and not perceive;\n\"Therefore hear the parable of the\nsower:\nWhen anyone hears the word of the\nkingdom, and does not understand it,\nthen the wicked one comes and\nsnatches away what was sown in his\nheart. This is he who received seed by\nthe wayside.\nBut he who received the seed on stony\nplaces, this is he who hears the word\nand immediately receives it with joy;\nyet he has no root in himself, but\nendures only for a while. For when\ntribulation or persecution arises because\nof the word, immediately he stumbles.\nNow he who received seed among the\nthorns is he who hears the word, and\nthe cares of this world and the\ndeceitfulness of riches choke the word,\nand he becomes unfruitful.\nBut he who received seed on the good\nground is he who hears the word and\nunderstands it, who indeed bears fruit\nand produces: some a hundredfold,\nsome sixty, some thirty.\"\nwhich indeed is the least of all the\nseeds; but when it is grown it is greater\nthan the herbs and becomes a tree, so\nthat the birds of the air come and nest in\nits branches.\"\nAnother parable He put forth to them,\nsaying: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a\nman who sowed good seed in his field;\nbut while men slept, his enemy came\nand sowed tares among the wheat and\nwent his way.\nBut when the grain had sprouted and\nproduced a crop, then the tares also\nappeared.\nSo the servants of the owner came\nand said to him, \"Sir, did you not sow\ngood seed in your field? How then does\nit have tares?'\nHe said to them, \"An enemy has done\nthis.' The servants said to him, \"Do you\nwant us then to go and gather them up?'\nAnother parable He spoke to them:\n\"The kingdom of heaven is like leaven,\nwhich a woman took and hid in three\nmeasures of meal till it was all\nleavened.\"\nAll these things Jesus spoke to the\nmultitude in parables; and without a\nparable He did not speak to them,\nthat it might be fulfilled which was\nspoken by the prophet, saying: \"I will\nopen My mouth in parables; I will utter\nthings kept secret from the foundation of\nthe world.\"\nThen Jesus sent the multitude away\nand went into the house. And His\ndisciples came to Him, saying, \"Explain\nto us the parable of the tares of the\nfield.\"\nBut he said, \"No, lest while you gather\nup the tares you also uproot the wheat\nwith them.\nHe answered and said to them: \"He\nwho sows the good seed is the Son of\nMan.\nLet both grow together until the\nharvest, and at the time of harvest I will\nsay to the reapers, \"First gather together\nthe tares and bind them in bundles to\nburn them, but gather the wheat into my\nbarn.\"\"'\nAnother parable He put forth to them,\nsaying: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a\nmustard seed, which a man took and\nsowed in his field,\nThe field is the world, the good seeds\nare the sons of the kingdom, but the\ntares are the sons of the wicked one.\nThe enemy who sowed them is the\ndevil, the harvest is the end of the age,\nand the reapers are the angels.\nTherefore as the tares are gathered\nand burned in the fire, so it will be at the\nend of this age.\nThe Son of Man will send out His\nangels, and they will gather out of His\nkingdom all things that offend, and those\nwho practice lawlessness,\nJesus said to them, \"Have you\nunderstood all these things?\" They said\nto Him, \"Yes, Lord.\"\nand will cast them into the furnace of\nfire. There will be wailing and gnashing\nof teeth.\nThen He said to them, \"Therefore\nevery scribe instructed concerning the\nkingdom of heaven is like a householder\nwho brings out of his treasure things\nnew and old.\"\nThen the righteous will shine forth as\nthe sun in the kingdom of their Father.\nHe who has ears to hear, let him hear!\nNow it came to pass, when Jesus had\nfinished these parables, that He\ndeparted from there.\n\"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like\ntreasure hidden in a field, which a man\nfound and hid; and for joy over it he\ngoes and sells all that he has and buys\nthat field.\n\"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a\nmerchant seeking beautiful pearls,\nWhen He had come to His own\ncountry, He taught them in their\nsynagogue,\nso\nthat\nthey\nwere\nastonished and said, \"Where did this\nMan get this wisdom and these mighty\nworks?\nwho, when he had found one pearl of\ngreat price, went and sold all that he\nhad and bought it.\nIs this not the carpenter's son? Is not\nHis mother called Mary? And His\nbrothers James, Joses, Simon, and\nJudas?\n\"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a\ndragnet that was cast into the sea and\ngathered some of every kind,\nAnd His sisters, are they not all with\nus? Where then did this Man get all\nthese things?\"\nwhich, when it was full, they drew to\nshore; and they sat down and gathered\nthe good into vessels, but threw the bad\naway.\nSo they were offended at Him. But\nJesus said to them, \"A prophet is not\nwithout honor except in his own country\nand in his own house.\"\nSo it will be at the end of the age. The\nangels will come forth, separate the\nwicked from among the just,\nand cast them into the furnace of fire.\nThere will be wailing and gnashing of\nteeth.\"\nNow He did not do many mighty works\nthere because of their unbelief.\n14At that time Herod the tetrarch\nheard the report about Jesus\nand said to his servants, \"This is John\nthe Baptist; he is risen from the dead,\nand therefore these powers are at work\nin him.\"\nWhen Jesus heard it, He departed\nfrom there by boat to a deserted place\nby Himself. But when the multitudes\nheard it, they followed Him on foot from\nthe cities.\nFor Herod had laid hold of John and\nbound him, and put him in prison for the\nsake of Herodias, his brother Philip's\nwife.\nAnd when Jesus went out He saw a\ngreat multitude; and He was moved with\ncompassion for them, and healed their\nsick.\nBecause John had said to him, \"It is not\nlawful for you to have her.\"\nAnd although he wanted to put him to\ndeath, he feared the multitude, because\nthey counted him as a prophet.\nWhen it was evening, His disciples\ncame to Him, saying, \"This is a deserted\nplace, and the hour is already late. Send\nthe multitudes away, that they may go\ninto the villages and buy themselves\nfood.\"\nBut when Herod's birthday was\ncelebrated, the daughter of Herodias\ndanced before them and pleased Herod.\nBut Jesus said to them, \"They do not\nneed to go away. You give them\nsomething to eat.\"\nTherefore he promised with an oath to\ngive her whatever she might ask.\nAnd they said to Him, \"We have here\nonly five loaves and two fish.\"\nSo she, having been prompted by her\nmother, said, \"Give me John the\nBaptist's head here on a platter.\"\nAnd the king was sorry; nevertheless,\nbecause of the oaths and because of\nthose who sat with him, he commanded\nit to be given to her.\nHe said, \"Bring them here to Me.\"\nThen He commanded the multitudes to\nsit down on the grass. And He took the\nfive loaves and the two fish, and looking\nup to heaven, He blessed and broke\nand gave the loaves to the disciples;\nand the disciples gave to the multitudes.\nSo he sent and had John beheaded in\nprison.\nAnd his head was brought on a platter\nand given to the girl, and she brought it\nto her mother.\nThen his disciples came and took\naway the body and buried it, and went\nand told Jesus.\nSo they all ate and were filled, and\nthey took up twelve baskets full of the\nfragments that remained.\nNow those who had eaten were about\nfive thousand men, besides women and\nchildren.\nImmediately Jesus made His disciples\nget into the boat and go before Him to\nthe other side, while He sent the\nmultitudes away.\nAnd when He had sent the multitudes\naway, He went up on the mountain by\nHimself to pray. Now when evening\ncame, He was alone there.\nBut the boat was now in the middle of\nthe sea, tossed by the waves, for the\nwind was contrary.\nNow in the fourth watch of the night\nJesus went to them, walking on the sea.\nAnd when the disciples saw Him\nwalking on the sea, they were troubled,\nsaying, \"It is a ghost!\" And they cried out\nfor fear.\nBut immediately Jesus spoke to them,\nsaying, \"Be of good cheer! It is I; do not\nbe afraid.\"\nAnd Peter answered Him and said,\n\"Lord, if it is You, command me to come\nto You on the water.\"\nSo He said, \"Come.\" And when Peter\nhad come down out of the boat, he\nwalked on the water to go to Jesus.\nBut when he saw that the wind was\nboisterous, he was afraid; and beginning\nto sink he cried out, saying, \"Lord, save\nme!\"\nAnd immediately Jesus stretched out\nHis hand and caught him, and said to\nhim, \"O you of little faith, why did you\ndoubt?\"\nAnd when they got into the boat, the\nwind ceased.\nThen those who were in the boat came\nand worshiped Him, saying, \"Truly You\nare the Son of God.\"\nWhen they had crossed over, they\ncame to the land of Gennesaret.\nAnd when the men of that place\nrecognized Him, they sent out into all\nthat surrounding region, brought to Him\nall who were sick,\nand begged Him that they might only\ntouch the hem of His garment. And as\nmany as touched it were made perfectly\nwell.\n15Then the scribes and Pharisees\nwho were from Jerusalem came to\nJesus, saying,\n\"Why do Your disciples transgress the\ntradition of the elders? For they do not\nwash their hands when they eat bread.\"\nHe answered and said to them, \"Why\ndo\nyou\nalso\ntransgress\nthe\ncommandment of God because of your\ntradition?\nFor God commanded, saying, \"Honor\nyour father and your mother'; and, \"He\nwho curses father or mother, let him be\nput to death.'\nBut you say, \"Whoever says to his\nfather or mother, \"Whatever profit you\nmight have received from me is a gift to\nGod\"--\nthen he need not honor his father or\nmother.' Thus you have made the\ncommandment of God of no effect by\nyour tradition.\nDo you not yet understand that\nwhatever enters the mouth goes into the\nstomach and is eliminated?\nHypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy\nabout you, saying:\nBut those things which proceed out of\nthe mouth come from the heart, and\nthey defile a man.\n\"These people draw near to Me with\ntheir mouth, And honor Me with their lips,\nBut their heart is far from Me.\nFor out of the heart proceed evil\nthoughts,\nmurders,\nadulteries,\nfornications, thefts, false witness,\nblasphemies.\nAnd in vain they worship Me, Teaching\nas doctrines the commandments of\nmen.\"'\nThese are the things which defile a\nman, but to eat with unwashed hands\ndoes not defile a man.\"\nWhen He had called the multitude to\nHimself, He said to them, \"Hear and\nunderstand:\nThen Jesus went out from there and\ndeparted to the region of Tyre and Sidon.\nNot what goes into the mouth defiles a\nman; but what comes out of the mouth,\nthis defiles a man.\"\nThen His disciples came and said to\nHim, \"Do You know that the Pharisees\nwere offended when they heard this\nsaying?\"\nBut He answered and said, \"Every\nplant which My heavenly Father has not\nplanted will be uprooted.\nLet them alone. They are blind leaders\nof the blind. And if the blind leads the\nblind, both will fall into a ditch.\"\nAnd behold, a woman of Canaan\ncame from that region and cried out to\nHim, saying, \"Have mercy on me, O\nLord, Son of David! My daughter is\nseverely demon-possessed.\"\nBut He answered her not a word. And\nHis disciples came and urged Him,\nsaying, \"Send her away, for she cries\nout after us.\"\nBut He answered and said, \"I was not\nsent except to the lost sheep of the\nhouse of Israel.\"\nThen she came and worshiped Him,\nsaying, \"Lord, help me!\"\nThen Peter answered and said to Him,\n\"Explain this parable to us.\"\nSo Jesus said, \"Are you also still\nwithout understanding?\nBut He answered and said, \"It is not\ngood to take the children's bread and\nthrow it to the little dogs.\"\nAnd she said, \"Yes, Lord, yet even the\nlittle dogs eat the crumbs which fall from\ntheir masters' table.\"\nSo He commanded the multitude to sit\ndown on the ground.\nThen Jesus answered and said to her,\n\"O woman, great is your faith! Let it be\nto you as you desire.\" And her daughter\nwas healed from that very hour.\nAnd He took the seven loaves and the\nfish and gave thanks, broke them and\ngave them to His disciples; and the\ndisciples gave to the multitude.\nJesus departed from there, skirted the\nSea of Galilee, and went up on the\nmountain and sat down there.\nSo they all ate and were filled, and\nthey took up seven large baskets full of\nthe fragments that were left.\nThen great multitudes came to Him,\nhaving with them the lame, blind, mute,\nmaimed, and many others; and they laid\nthem down at Jesus' feet, and He\nhealed them.\nSo the multitude marveled when they\nsaw the mute speaking, the maimed\nmade whole, the lame walking, and the\nblind seeing; and they glorified the God\nof Israel.\nNow Jesus called His disciples to\nHimself and said, \"I have compassion\non the multitude, because they have\nnow continued with Me three days and\nhave nothing to eat. And I do not want to\nsend them away hungry, lest they faint\non the way.\"\nThen His disciples said to Him, \"Where\ncould we get enough bread in the\nwilderness to fill such a great\nmultitude?\"\nJesus said to them, \"How many loaves\ndo you have?\" And they said, \"Seven,\nand a few little fish.\"\nNow those who ate were four\nthousand men, besides women and\nchildren.\nAnd He sent away the multitude, got\ninto the boat, and came to the region of\nMagdala.\n16Then\nthe\nPharisees\nand\nSadducees came, and testing Him\nasked that He would show them a sign\nfrom heaven.\nHe answered and said to them, \"When\nit is evening you say, \"It will be fair\nweather, for the sky is red';\nand in the morning, \"It will be foul\nweather today, for the sky is red and\nthreatening.'

You know how\nto discern the face of the sky, but you\ncannot discern the signs of the times.\nA wicked and adulterous generation\nseeks after a sign, and no sign shall be\ngiven to it except the sign of the prophet\nJonah.\" And He left them and departed.\nNow when His disciples had come to\nthe other side, they had forgotten to take\nbread.\nSo they said, \"Some say John the\nBaptist, some Elijah, and others\nJeremiah or one of the prophets.\"\nThen Jesus said to them, \"Take heed\nand beware of the leaven of the\nPharisees and the Sadducees.\"\nHe said to them, \"But who do you say\nthat I am?\"\nAnd they reasoned among themselves,\nsaying, \"It is because we have taken no\nbread.\"\nSimon Peter answered and said, \"You\nare the Christ, the Son of the living\nGod.\"\nBut Jesus, being aware of it, said to\nthem, \"O you of little faith, why do you\nreason among yourselves because you\nhave brought no bread?\nJesus answered and said to him,\n\"Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for\nflesh and blood has not revealed this to\nyou, but My Father who is in heaven.\nDo you not yet understand, or\nremember the five loaves of the five\nthousand and how many baskets you\ntook up?\nAnd I also say to you that you are\nPeter, and on this rock I will build My\nchurch, and the gates of Hades shall not\nprevail against it.\nNor the seven loaves of the four\nthousand and how many large baskets\nyou took up?\nAnd I will give you the keys of the\nkingdom of heaven, and whatever you\nbind on earth will be bound in heaven,\nand whatever you loose on earth will be\nloosed in heaven.\"\nHow is it you do not understand that I\ndid not speak to you concerning bread?-but to beware of the leaven of the\nPharisees and Sadducees.\"\nThen He commanded His disciples\nthat they should tell no one that He was\nJesus the Christ.\nThen they understood that He did not\ntell them to beware of the leaven of\nbread, but of the doctrine of the\nPharisees and Sadducees.\nWhen Jesus came into the region of\nCaesarea Philippi, He asked His\ndisciples, saying, \"Who do men say that\nI, the Son of Man, am?\"\nFrom that time Jesus began to show to\nHis disciples that He must go to\nJerusalem, and suffer many things from\nthe elders and chief priests and scribes,\nand be killed, and be raised the third\nday.\nThen Peter took Him aside and began\nto rebuke Him, saying, \"Far be it from\nYou, Lord; this shall not happen to You!\"\nBut He turned and said to Peter, \"Get\nbehind Me, Satan! You are an offense to\nMe, for you are not mindful of the things\nof God, but the things of men.\"\nThen Peter answered and said to Jesus,\n\"Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You\nwish, let us make here three\ntabernacles: one for You, one for Moses,\nand one for Elijah.\"\nThen Jesus said to His disciples, \"If\nanyone desires to come after Me, let\nhim deny himself, and take up his cross,\nand follow Me.\nFor whoever desires to save his life\nwill lose it, but whoever loses his life for\nMy sake will find it.\nFor what profit is it to a man if he gains\nthe whole world, and loses his own\nsoul? Or what will a man give in\nexchange for his soul?\nFor the Son of Man will come in the\nglory of His Father with His angels, and\nthen He will reward each according to\nhis works.\nAssuredly, I say to you, there are\nsome standing here who shall not taste\ndeath till they see the Son of Man\ncoming in His kingdom.\"\n17Now after six days Jesus took\nWhile he was still speaking, behold, a\nbright cloud overshadowed them; and\nsuddenly a voice came out of the cloud,\nsaying, \"This is My beloved Son, in\nwhom I am well pleased. Hear Him!\"\nAnd when the disciples heard it, they\nfell on their faces and were greatly\nafraid.\nBut Jesus came and touched them and\nsaid, \"Arise, and do not be afraid.\"\nWhen they had lifted up their eyes, they\nsaw no one but Jesus only.\nNow as they came down from the\nmountain, Jesus commanded them,\nsaying, \"Tell the vision to no one until\nthe Son of Man is risen from the dead.\"\nAnd His disciples asked Him, saying,\n\"Why then do the scribes say that Elijah\nmust come first?\"\nPeter, James, and John his brother, led\nthem up on a high mountain by\nthemselves;\nJesus answered and said to them,\n\"Indeed, Elijah is coming first and will\nrestore all things.\nand He was transfigured before them.\nHis face shone like the sun, and His\nclothes became as white as the light.\nAnd behold, Moses and Elijah\nappeared to them, talking with Him.\nBut I say to you that Elijah has come\nalready, and they did not know him but\ndid to him whatever they wished.\nLikewise the Son of Man is also about to\nsuffer at their hands.\"\nThen the disciples understood that He\nspoke to them of John the Baptist.\nAnd when they had come to the\nmultitude, a man came to Him, kneeling\ndown to Him and saying,\nWhen they had come to Capernaum,\nthose who received the temple tax came\nto Peter and said, \"Does your Teacher\nnot pay the temple tax?\"\n\"Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is\nan epileptic and suffers severely; for he\noften falls into the fire and often into the\nwater.\nSo I brought him to Your disciples, but\nthey could not cure him.\"\nHe said, \"Yes.\" And when he had\ncome into the house, Jesus anticipated\nhim, saying, \"What do you think, Simon?\nFrom whom do the kings of the earth\ntake customs or taxes, from their sons\nor from strangers?\"\nThen Jesus answered and said, \"O\nfaithless and perverse generation, how\nlong shall I be with you? How long shall\nI bear with you? Bring him here to Me.\"\nAnd Jesus rebuked the demon, and it\ncame out of him; and the child was\ncured from that very hour.\nThen the disciples came to Jesus\nprivately and said, \"Why could we not\ncast it out?\"\nSo Jesus said to them, \"Because of\nyour unbelief; for assuredly, I say to you,\nif you have faith as a mustard seed, you\nwill say to this mountain, \"Move from\nhere to there,' and it will move; and\nnothing will be impossible for you.\nPeter said to Him, \"From strangers.\"\nJesus said to him, \"Then the sons are\nfree.\nNevertheless, lest we offend them, go\nto the sea, cast in a hook, and take the\nfish that comes up first. And when you\nhave opened its mouth, you will find a\npiece of money; take that and give it to\nthem for Me and you.\"\n18At that time the disciples came to\nJesus, saying, \"Who then is greatest in\nthe kingdom of heaven?\"\nThen Jesus called a little child to Him,\nset him in the midst of them,\nHowever, this kind does not go out\nexcept by prayer and fasting.\"\nand said, \"Assuredly, I say to you,\nunless you are converted and become\nas little children, you will by no means\nenter the kingdom of heaven.\nNow while they were staying in Galilee,\nJesus said to them, \"The Son of Man is\nabout to be betrayed into the hands of\nmen,\nTherefore whoever humbles himself as\nthis little child is the greatest in the\nkingdom of heaven.\nand they will kill Him, and the third day\nHe will be raised up.\" And they were\nexceedingly sorrowful.\nWhoever receives one little child like\nthis in My name receives Me.\n\"Whoever causes one of these little\nones who believe in Me to sin, it would\nbe better for him if a millstone were\nhung around his neck, and he were\ndrowned in the depth of the sea.\nWoe to the world because of offenses!\nFor offenses must come, but woe to that\nman by whom the offense comes!\nEven so it is not the will of your Father\nwho is in heaven that one of these little\nones should perish.\n\"Moreover if your brother sins against\nyou, go and tell him his fault between\nyou and him alone. If he hears you, you\nhave gained your brother.\n\"If your hand or foot causes you to sin,\ncut it off and cast it from you. It is better\nfor you to enter into life lame or maimed,\nrather than having two hands or two feet,\nto be cast into the everlasting fire.\nAnd if your eye causes you to sin, pluck\nit out and cast it from you. It is better for\nyou to enter into life with one eye, rather\nthan having two eyes, to be cast into\nhell fire.\n\"Take heed that you do not despise\none of these little ones, for I say to you\nthat in heaven their angels always see\nthe face of My Father who is in heaven.\nFor the Son of Man has come to save\nthat which was lost.\nBut if he will not hear, take with you\none or two more, that \"by the mouth of\ntwo or three witnesses every word may\nbe established.'\nAnd if he refuses to hear them, tell it to\nthe church. But if he refuses even to\nhear the church, let him be to you like a\nheathen and a tax collector.\n\"Assuredly, I say to you, whatever you\nbind on earth will be bound in heaven,\nand whatever you loose on earth will be\nloosed in heaven.\n\"Again I say to you that if two of you\nagree on earth concerning anything that\nthey ask, it will be done for them by My\nFather in heaven.\n\"What do you think? If a man has a\nhundred sheep, and one of them goes\nastray, does he not leave the ninetynine and go to the mountains to seek\nthe one that is straying?\nAnd if he should find it, assuredly, I\nsay to you, he rejoices more over that\nsheep than over the ninety-nine that did\nnot go astray.\nFor where two or three are gathered\ntogether in My name, I am there in the\nmidst of them.\"\nThen Peter came to Him and said,\n\"Lord, how often shall my brother sin\nagainst me, and I forgive him? Up to\nseven times?\"\nJesus said to him, \"I do not say to you,\nup to seven times, but up to seventy\ntimes seven.\nTherefore the kingdom of heaven is\nlike a certain king who wanted to settle\naccounts with his servants.\nforgave you all that debt because you\nbegged me.\nAnd when he had begun to settle\naccounts, one was brought to him who\nowed him ten thousand talents.\nShould you not also have had\ncompassion on your fellow servant, just\nas I had pity on you?'\nBut as he was not able to pay, his\nmaster commanded that he be sold,\nwith his wife and children and all that he\nhad, and that payment be made.\nThe servant therefore fell down before\nhim, saying, \"Master, have patience with\nme, and I will pay you all.'\nThen the master of that servant was\nmoved with compassion, released him,\nand forgave him the debt.\n\"But that servant went out and found\none of his fellow servants who owed him\na hundred denarii; and he laid hands on\nhim and took him by the throat, saying,\n\"Pay me what you owe!'\nSo his fellow servant fell down at his\nfeet and begged him, saying, \"Have\npatience with me, and I will pay you all.'\nAnd he would not, but went and threw\nhim into prison till he should pay the\ndebt.\nSo when his fellow servants saw what\nhad been done, they were very grieved,\nand came and told their master all that\nhad been done.\nThen his master, after he had called\nhim, said to him, \"You wicked servant! I\nAnd his master was angry, and\ndelivered him to the torturers until he\nshould pay all that was due to him.\n\"So My heavenly Father also will do to\nyou if each of you, from his heart, does\nnot forgive his brother his trespasses.\"\n19Now it came to pass, when Jesus\nhad finished these sayings, that He\ndeparted from Galilee and came to the\nregion of Judea beyond the Jordan.\nAnd great multitudes followed Him, and\nHe healed them there.\nThe Pharisees also came to Him,\ntesting Him, and saying to Him, \"Is it\nlawful for a man to divorce his wife for\njust any reason?\"\nAnd He answered and said to them,\n\"Have you not read that He who made\nthem at the beginning \"made them male\nand female,'\nand said, \"For this reason a man shall\nleave his father and mother and be\njoined to his wife, and the two shall\nbecome one flesh'?\nSo then, they are no longer two but one\nflesh. Therefore what God has joined\ntogether, let not man separate.\"\nThey said to Him, \"Why then did Moses\ncommand to give a certificate of divorce,\nand to put her away?\"\nNow behold, one came and said to\nHim, \"Good Teacher, what good thing\nshall I do that I may have eternal life?\"\nHe said to them, \"Moses, because of\nthe hardness of your hearts, permitted\nyou to divorce your wives, but from the\nbeginning it was not so.\nSo He said to him, \"Why do you call\nMe good? No one is good but One, that\nis, God. But if you want to enter into life,\nkeep the commandments.\"\nAnd I say to you, whoever divorces his\nwife, except for sexual immorality, and\nmarries another, commits adultery; and\nwhoever marries her who is divorced\ncommits adultery.\"\nHe said to Him, \"Which ones?\" Jesus\nsaid, \"\"You shall not murder,' \"You shall\nnot commit adultery,' \"You shall not\nsteal,' \"You shall not bear false witness,'\nHis disciples said to Him, \"If such is\nthe case of the man with his wife, it is\nbetter not to marry.\"\n\"Honor your father and your mother,'\nand, \"You shall love your neighbor as\nyourself.\"'\nBut He said to them, \"All cannot\naccept this saying, but only those to\nwhom it has been given:\nThe young man said to Him, \"All these\nthings I have kept from my youth. What\ndo I still lack?\"\nFor there are eunuchs who were born\nthus from their mother's womb, and\nthere are eunuchs who were made\neunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs\nwho have made themselves eunuchs for\nthe kingdom of heaven's sake. He who\nis able to accept it, let him accept it.\"\nJesus said to him, \"If you want to be\nperfect, go, sell what you have and give\nto the poor, and you will have treasure\nin heaven; and come, follow Me.\"\nBut when the young man heard that\nsaying, he went away sorrowful, for he\nhad great possessions.\nThen little children were brought to\nHim that He might put His hands on\nthem and pray, but the disciples\nrebuked them.\nThen Jesus said to His disciples,\n\"Assuredly, I say to you that it is hard for\na rich man to enter the kingdom of\nheaven.\nBut Jesus said, \"Let the little children\ncome to Me, and do not forbid them; for\nof such is the kingdom of heaven.\"\nAnd He laid His hands on them and\ndeparted from there.\nAnd again I say to you, it is easier for a\ncamel to go through the eye of a needle\nthan for a rich man to enter the kingdom\nof God.\"\nWhen His disciples heard it, they were\ngreatly astonished, saying, \"Who then\ncan be saved?\"\nand said to them, \"You also go into the\nvineyard, and whatever is right I will give\nyou.' So they went.\nBut Jesus looked at them and said to\nthem, \"With men this is impossible, but\nwith God all things are possible.\"\nAgain he went out about the sixth and\nthe ninth hour, and did likewise.\nThen Peter answered and said to Him,\n\"See, we have left all and followed You.\nTherefore what shall we have?\"\nAnd about the eleventh hour he went\nout and found others standing idle, and\nsaid to them, \"Why have you been\nstanding here idle all day?'\nSo Jesus said to them, \"Assuredly I\nsay to you, that in the regeneration,\nwhen the Son of Man sits on the throne\nof His glory, you who have followed Me\nwill also sit on twelve thrones, judging\nthe twelve tribes of Israel.\nAnd everyone who has left houses or\nbrothers or sisters or father or mother or\nwife or children or lands, for My name's\nsake, shall receive a hundredfold, and\ninherit eternal life.\nBut many who are first will be last, and\nthe last first.\nThey said to him, \"Because no one\nhired us.' He said to them, \"You also go\ninto the vineyard, and whatever is right\nyou will receive.'\n\"So when evening had come, the\nowner of the vineyard said to his\nsteward, \"Call the laborers and give\nthem their wages, beginning with the\nlast to the first.'\nAnd when those came who were hired\nabout the eleventh hour, they each\nreceived a denarius.\n20\"For the kingdom of heaven is like\na landowner who went out early in the\nmorning to hire laborers for his vineyard.\nNow when he had agreed with the\nlaborers for a denarius a day, he sent\nthem into his vineyard.\nAnd he went out about the third hour\nand saw others standing idle in the\nmarketplace,\nBut when the first came, they\nsupposed that they would receive more;\nand they likewise received each a\ndenarius.\nAnd when they had received it, they\ncomplained against the landowner,\nsaying, \"These last men have worked\nonly one hour, and you made them\nequal to us who have borne the burden\nand the heat of the day.'\nBut he answered one of them and said,\n\"Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did\nyou not agree with me for a denarius?\nTake what is yours and go your way. I\nwish to give to this last man the same as\nto you.\nIs it not lawful for me to do what I wish\nwith my own things? Or is your eye evil\nbecause I am good?'\nSo the last will be first, and the first\nlast. For many are called, but few\nchosen.\"\nSo He said to them, \"You will indeed\ndrink My cup, and be baptized with the\nbaptism that I am baptized with; but to\nsit on My right hand and on My left is not\nMine to give, but it is for those for whom\nit is prepared by My Father.\"\nAnd when the ten heard it, they were\ngreatly displeased with the two brothers.\nNow Jesus, going up to Jerusalem,\ntook the twelve disciples aside on the\nroad and said to them,\nBut Jesus called them to Himself and\nsaid, \"You know that the rulers of the\nGentiles lord it over them, and those\nwho are great exercise authority over\nthem.\n\"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem,\nand the Son of Man will be betrayed to\nthe chief priests and to the scribes; and\nthey will condemn Him to death,\nand deliver Him to the Gentiles to\nmock and to scourge and to crucify. And\nthe third day He will rise again.\"\nThen the mother of Zebedee's sons\ncame to Him with her sons, kneeling\ndown and asking something from Him.\nYet it shall not be so among you; but\nwhoever desires to become great\namong you, let him be your servant.\nAnd whoever desires to be first among\nyou, let him be your slave-28\njust as the Son of Man did not come to\nbe served, but to serve, and to give His\nlife a ransom for many.\"\nNow as they went out of Jericho, a\ngreat multitude followed Him.\nAnd He said to her, \"What do you\nwish?\" She said to Him, \"Grant that\nthese two sons of mine may sit, one on\nYour right hand and the other on the left,\nin Your kingdom.\"\nAnd behold, two blind men sitting by\nthe road, when they heard that Jesus\nwas passing by, cried out, saying, \"Have\nmercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!\"\nBut Jesus answered and said, \"You do\nnot know what you ask. Are you able to\ndrink the cup that I am about to drink,\nand be baptized with the baptism that I\nam baptized with?\" They said to Him,\n\"We are able.\"\nThen the multitude warned them that\nthey should be quiet; but they cried out\nall the more, saying, \"Have mercy on us,\nO Lord, Son of David!\"\nSo Jesus stood still and called them,\nand said, \"What do you want Me to do\nfor you?\"\nThey said to Him, \"Lord, that our eyes\nmay be opened.\"\nbranches from the trees and spread\nthem on the road.\nSo Jesus had compassion and\ntouched their eyes. And immediately\ntheir eyes received sight, and they\nfollowed Him.\n21Now when they drew near\nJerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at\nthe Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent\ntwo disciples,\nsaying to them, \"Go into the village\nopposite you, and immediately you will\nfind a donkey tied, and a colt with her.\nLoose them and bring them to Me.\nAnd if anyone says anything to you,\nyou shall say, \"The Lord has need of\nthem,' and immediately he will send\nthem.\"\nAll this was done that it might be\nfulfilled which was spoken by the\nprophet, saying:\nThen the multitudes who went before\nand those who followed cried out,\nsaying: \"Hosanna to the Son of David!\n\"Blessed is He who comes in the name\nof the LORD!' Hosanna in the highest!\"\nAnd when He had come into\nJerusalem, all the city was moved,\nsaying, \"Who is this?\"\nSo the multitudes said, \"This is Jesus,\nthe prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.\"\nThen Jesus went into the temple of\nGod and drove out all those who bought\nand sold in the temple, and overturned\nthe tables of the money changers and\nthe seats of those who sold doves.\nAnd He said to them, \"It is written, \"My\nhouse shall be called a house of prayer,'\nbut you have made it a \"den of thieves.\"'\nThen the blind and the lame came to\nHim in the temple, and He healed them.\n\"Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold,\nyour King is coming to you, Lowly, and\nsitting on a donkey, A colt, the foal of a\ndonkey.\"'\nSo the disciples went and did as Jesus\ncommanded them.\nThey brought the donkey and the colt,\nlaid their clothes on them, and set Him\non them.\nAnd a very great multitude spread their\nclothes on the road; others cut down\nBut when the chief priests and scribes\nsaw the wonderful things that He did,\nand the children crying out in the temple\nand saying, \"Hosanna to the Son of\nDavid!\" they were indignant\nand said to Him, \"Do You hear what\nthese are saying?\" And Jesus said to\nthem, \"Yes. Have you never read, \"Out\nof the mouth of babes and nursing\ninfants You have perfected praise'?\"\nThen He left them and went out of the\ncity to Bethany, and He lodged there.\nNow in the morning, as He returned to\nthe city, He was hungry.\nBut if we say, \"From men,' we fear the\nmultitude, for all count John as a\nprophet.\"\nAnd seeing a fig tree by the road, He\ncame to it and found nothing on it but\nleaves, and said to it, \"Let no fruit grow\non you ever again.\" Immediately the fig\ntree withered away.\nSo they answered Jesus and said,\n\"We do not know.\" And He said to them,\n\"Neither will I tell you by what authority I\ndo these things.\nAnd when the disciples saw it, they\nmarveled, saying, \"How did the fig tree\nwither away so soon?\"\n\"But what do you think? A man had\ntwo sons, and he came to the first and\nsaid, \"Son, go, work today in my\nvineyard.'\nSo Jesus answered and said to them,\n\"Assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith\nand do not doubt, you will not only do\nwhat was done to the fig tree, but also if\nyou say to this mountain, \"Be removed\nand be cast into the sea,' it will be done.\nAnd whatever things you ask in prayer,\nbelieving, you will receive.\"\nNow when He came into the temple,\nthe chief priests and the elders of the\npeople confronted Him as He was\nteaching, and said, \"By what authority\nare You doing these things? And who\ngave You this authority?\"\nBut Jesus answered and said to them,\n\"I also will ask you one thing, which if\nyou tell Me, I likewise will tell you by\nwhat authority I do these things:\nThe baptism of John--where was it\nfrom? From heaven or from men?\" And\nthey reasoned among themselves,\nsaying, \"If we say, \"From heaven,' He\nwill say to us, \"Why then did you not\nbelieve him?'\nHe answered and said, \"I will not,' but\nafterward he regretted it and went.\nThen he came to the second and said\nlikewise. And he answered and said, \"I\ngo, sir,' but he did not go.\nWhich of the two did the will of his\nfather?\" They said to Him, \"The first.\"\nJesus said to them, \"Assuredly, I say to\nyou that tax collectors and harlots enter\nthe kingdom of God before you.\nFor John came to you in the way of\nrighteousness, and you did not believe\nhim; but tax collectors and harlots\nbelieved him; and when you saw it, you\ndid not afterward relent and believe him.\n\"Hear another parable: There was a\ncertain landowner who planted a\nvineyard and set a hedge around it, dug\na winepress in it and built a tower. And\nhe leased it to vinedressers and went\ninto a far country.\nNow when vintage-time drew near, he\nsent his servants to the vinedressers,\nthat they might receive its fruit.\nAnd the vinedressers took his servants,\nbeat one, killed one, and stoned another.\nNow when the chief priests and\nPharisees heard His parables, they\nperceived that He was speaking of them.\nAgain he sent other servants, more\nthan the first, and they did likewise to\nthem.\nBut when they sought to lay hands on\nHim, they feared the multitudes,\nbecause they took Him for a prophet.\nThen last of all he sent his son to them,\nsaying, \"They will respect my son.'\nBut when the vinedressers saw the\nson, they said among themselves, \"This\nis the heir. Come, let us kill him and\nseize his inheritance.'\nSo they took him and cast him out of\nthe vineyard and killed him.\n\"Therefore, when the owner of the\nvineyard comes, what will he do to those\nvinedressers?\"\nThey said to Him, \"He will destroy\nthose wicked men miserably, and lease\nhis vineyard to other vinedressers who\nwill render to him the fruits in their\nseasons.\"\nJesus said to them, \"Have you never\nread in the Scriptures: \"The stone which\nthe builders rejected Has become the\nchief cornerstone. This was the LORD's\ndoing, And it is marvelous in our eyes'?\n\"Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of\nGod will be taken from you and given to\na nation bearing the fruits of it.\nAnd whoever falls on this stone will be\nbroken; but on whomever it falls, it will\ngrind him to powder.\"\n22And Jesus answered and spoke to\nthem again by parables and said:\n\"The kingdom of heaven is like a\ncertain king who arranged a marriage\nfor his son,\nand sent out his servants to call those\nwho were invited to the wedding; and\nthey were not willing to come.\nAgain, he sent out other servants,\nsaying, \"Tell those who are invited, \"See,\nI have prepared my dinner; my oxen and\nfatted cattle are killed, and all things are\nready. Come to the wedding.\"'\nBut they made light of it and went their\nways, one to his own farm, another to\nhis business.\nAnd the rest seized his servants,\ntreated them spitefully, and killed them.\nBut when the king heard about it, he\nwas furious. And he sent out his armies,\ndestroyed those murderers, and burned\nup their city.\nThen he said to his servants, \"The\nwedding is ready, but those who were\ninvited were not worthy.\nTherefore go into the highways, and as\nmany as you find, invite to the wedding.'\nShow Me the tax money.\" So they\nbrought Him a denarius.\nSo those servants went out into the\nhighways and gathered together all\nwhom they found, both bad and good.\nAnd the wedding hall was filled with\nguests.\n\"But when the king came in to see the\nguests, he saw a man there who did not\nhave on a wedding garment.\nSo he said to him, \"Friend, how did\nyou come in here without a wedding\ngarment?' And he was speechless.\nThen the king said to the servants,\n\"Bind him hand and foot, take him away,\nand cast him into outer darkness; there\nwill be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'\n\"For many are called, but few are\nchosen.\"\nAnd He said to them, \"Whose image\nand inscription is this?\"\nThey said to Him, \"Caesar's.\" And He\nsaid to them, \"Render therefore to\nCaesar the things that are Caesar's, and\nto God the things that are God's.\"\nWhen they had heard these words,\nthey marveled, and left Him and went\ntheir way.\nThe same day the Sadducees, who\nsay there is no resurrection, came to\nHim and asked Him,\nsaying: \"Teacher, Moses said that if a\nman dies, having no children, his\nbrother shall marry his wife and raise up\noffspring for his brother.\nThen the Pharisees went and plotted\nhow they might entangle Him in His talk.\nNow there were with us seven\nbrothers. The first died after he had\nmarried, and having no offspring, left his\nwife to his brother.\nAnd they sent to Him their disciples\nwith the Herodians, saying, \"Teacher,\nwe know that You are true, and teach\nthe way of God in truth; nor do You care\nabout anyone, for You do not regard the\nperson of men.\nLikewise the second also, and the third,\neven to the seventh.\nLast of all the woman died also.\nTell us, therefore, what do You think?\nIs it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or\nnot?\"\nTherefore, in the resurrection, whose\nwife of the seven will she be?

For she has done a good work\nfor Me.\nFor you have the poor with you always,\nbut Me you do not have always.\nWhen evening had come, He sat down\nwith the twelve.\nNow as they were eating, He said,\n\"Assuredly, I say to you, one of you will\nbetray Me.\"\nFor in pouring this fragrant oil on My\nbody, she did it for My burial.\nAnd they were exceedingly sorrowful,\nand each of them began to say to Him,\n\"Lord, is it I?\"\nAssuredly, I say to you, wherever this\ngospel is preached in the whole world,\nwhat this woman has done will also be\ntold as a memorial to her.\"\nHe answered and said, \"He who\ndipped his hand with Me in the dish will\nbetray Me.\nThen one of the twelve, called Judas\nIscariot, went to the chief priests\nand said, \"What are you willing to give\nme if I deliver Him to you?\" And they\ncounted out to him thirty pieces of silver.\nSo from that time\nopportunity to betray Him.\nhe\nsought\nNow on the first day of the Feast of the\nUnleavened Bread the disciples came to\nJesus, saying to Him, \"Where do You\nwant us to prepare for You to eat the\nPassover?\"\nAnd He said, \"Go into the city to a\ncertain man, and say to him, \"The\nTeacher says, \"My time is at hand; I will\nkeep the Passover at your house with\nMy disciples.\"\"'\nSo the disciples did as Jesus had\ndirected them; and they prepared the\nPassover.\nThe Son of Man indeed goes just as it\nis written of Him, but woe to that man by\nwhom the Son of Man is betrayed! It\nwould have been good for that man if he\nhad not been born.\"\nThen Judas, who was betraying Him,\nanswered and said, \"Rabbi, is it I?\" He\nsaid to him, \"You have said it.\"\nAnd as they were eating, Jesus took\nbread, blessed and broke it, and gave it\nto the disciples and said, \"Take, eat; this\nis My body.\"\nThen He took the cup, and gave\nthanks, and gave it to them, saying,\n\"Drink from it, all of you.\nFor this is My blood of the new\ncovenant, which is shed for many for the\nremission of sins.\nBut I say to you, I will not drink of this\nfruit of the vine from now on until that\nday when I drink it new with you in My\nFather's kingdom.\"\nAnd when they had sung a hymn, they\nwent out to the Mount of Olives.\nThen Jesus said to them, \"All of you\nwill be made to stumble because of Me\nthis night, for it is written: \"I will strike the\nShepherd, And the sheep of the flock\nwill be scattered.'\nBut after I have been raised, I will go\nbefore you to Galilee.\"\nPeter answered and said to Him,\n\"Even if all are made to stumble\nbecause of You, I will never be made to\nstumble.\"\nThen He came to the disciples and\nfound them sleeping, and said to Peter,\n\"What! Could you not watch with Me one\nhour?\nWatch and pray, lest you enter into\ntemptation. The spirit indeed is willing,\nbut the flesh is weak.\"\nAgain, a second time, He went away\nand prayed, saying, \"O My Father, if this\ncup cannot pass away from Me unless I\ndrink it, Your will be done.\"\nAnd He came and found them asleep\nagain, for their eyes were heavy.\nJesus said to him, \"Assuredly, I say to\nyou that this night, before the rooster\ncrows, you will deny Me three times.\"\nSo He left them, went away again, and\nprayed the third time, saying the same\nwords.\nPeter said to Him, \"Even if I have to\ndie with You, I will not deny You!\" And\nso said all the disciples.\nThen Jesus came with them to a place\ncalled Gethsemane, and said to the\ndisciples, \"Sit here while I go and pray\nover there.\"\nAnd He took with Him Peter and the\ntwo sons of Zebedee, and He began to\nbe sorrowful and deeply distressed.\nThen He said to them, \"My soul is\nexceedingly sorrowful, even to death.\nStay here and watch with Me.\"\nHe went a little farther and fell on His\nface, and prayed, saying, \"O My Father,\nif it is possible, let this cup pass from\nMe; nevertheless, not as I will, but as\nYou will.\"\nThen He came to His disciples and\nsaid to them, \"Are you still sleeping and\nresting? Behold, the hour is at hand,\nand the Son of Man is being betrayed\ninto the hands of sinners.\nRise, let us be going. See, My betrayer\nis at hand.\"\nAnd while He was still speaking,\nbehold, Judas, one of the twelve, with a\ngreat multitude with swords and clubs,\ncame from the chief priests and elders\nof the people.\nNow His betrayer had given them a\nsign, saying, \"Whomever I kiss, He is\nthe One; seize Him.\"\nImmediately he went up to Jesus and\nsaid, \"Greetings, Rabbi!\" and kissed Him.\nBut Jesus said to him, \"Friend, why\nhave you come?\" Then they came and\nlaid hands on Jesus and took Him.\nNow the chief priests, the elders, and\nall the council sought false testimony\nagainst Jesus to put Him to death,\nAnd suddenly, one of those who were\nwith Jesus stretched out his hand and\ndrew his sword, struck the servant of the\nhigh priest, and cut off his ear.\nbut found none. Even though many\nfalse witnesses came forward, they\nfound none. But at last two false\nwitnesses came forward\nBut Jesus said to him, \"Put your sword\nin its place, for all who take the sword\nwill perish by the sword.\nand said, \"This fellow said, \"I am able\nto destroy the temple of God and to\nbuild it in three days.\"'\nOr do you think that I cannot now pray\nto My Father, and He will provide Me\nwith more than twelve legions of\nangels?\nAnd the high priest arose and said to\nHim, \"Do You answer nothing? What is\nit these men testify against You?\"\nHow then could the Scriptures be\nfulfilled, that it must happen thus?\"\nIn that hour Jesus said to the\nmultitudes, \"Have you come out, as\nagainst a robber, with swords and clubs\nto take Me? I sat daily with you,\nteaching in the temple, and you did not\nseize Me.\nBut Jesus kept silent. And the high\npriest answered and said to Him, \"I put\nYou under oath by the living God: Tell\nus if You are the Christ, the Son of\nGod!\"\nJesus said to him, \"It is as you said.\nNevertheless, I say to you, hereafter you\nwill see the Son of Man sitting at the\nright hand of the Power, and coming on\nthe clouds of heaven.\"\nBut all this was done that the\nScriptures of the prophets might be\nfulfilled.\" Then all the disciples forsook\nHim and fled.\nAnd those who had laid hold of Jesus\nled Him away to Caiaphas the high\npriest, where the scribes and the elders\nwere assembled.\nBut Peter followed Him at a distance to\nthe high priest's courtyard. And he went\nin and sat with the servants to see the\nend.\nThen the high priest tore his clothes,\nsaying, \"He has spoken blasphemy!\nWhat further need do we have of\nwitnesses? Look, now you have heard\nHis blasphemy!\nWhat do you think?\" They answered\nand said, \"He is deserving of death.\"\nThen they spat in His face and beat\nHim; and others struck Him with the\npalms of their hands,\nsaying, \"Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is\nthe one who struck You?\"\nNow Peter sat outside in the courtyard.\nAnd a servant girl came to him, saying,\n\"You also were with Jesus of Galilee.\"\nBut he denied it before them all,\nsaying, \"I do not know what you are\nsaying.\"\nAnd when he had gone out to the\ngateway, another girl saw him and said\nto those who were there, \"This fellow\nalso was with Jesus of Nazareth.\"\nThen Judas, His betrayer, seeing that\nHe had been condemned, was\nremorseful and brought back the thirty\npieces of silver to the chief priests and\nelders,\nsaying, \"I have sinned by betraying\ninnocent blood.\" And they said, \"What is\nthat to us? You see to it!\"\nThen he threw down the pieces of silver\nin the temple and departed, and went\nand hanged himself.\nBut again he denied with an oath, \"I do\nnot know the Man!\"\nBut the chief priests took the silver\npieces and said, \"It is not lawful to put\nthem into the treasury, because they are\nthe price of blood.\"\nAnd a little later those who stood by\ncame up and said to Peter, \"Surely you\nalso are one of them, for your speech\nbetrays you.\"\nThen he began to curse and swear,\nsaying, \"I do not know the Man!\"\nImmediately a rooster crowed.\nAnd Peter remembered the word of\nJesus who had said to him, \"Before the\nrooster crows, you will deny Me three\ntimes.\" So he went out and wept bitterly.\n27When morning came, all the chief\npriests and elders of the people plotted\nagainst Jesus to put Him to death.\nAnd when they had bound Him, they\nled Him away and delivered Him to\nPontius Pilate the governor.\nAnd they consulted together and\nbought with them the potter's field, to\nbury strangers in.\nTherefore that field has been called the\nField of Blood to this day.\nThen was fulfilled what was spoken by\nJeremiah the prophet, saying, \"And they\ntook the thirty pieces of silver, the value\nof Him who was priced, whom they of\nthe children of Israel priced,\nand gave them for the potter's field, as\nthe LORD directed me.\"\nNow Jesus stood before the governor.\nAnd the governor asked Him, saying,\n\"Are You the King of the Jews?\" Jesus\nsaid to him, \"It is as you say.\"\nAnd while He was being accused by\nthe chief priests and elders, He\nanswered nothing.\nThen Pilate said to Him, \"Do You not\nhear how many things they testify\nagainst You?\"\nThen the governor said, \"Why, what\nevil has He done?\" But they cried out all\nthe more, saying, \"Let Him be crucified!\"\nBut He answered him not one word, so\nthat the governor marveled greatly.\nNow at the feast the governor was\naccustomed to releasing to the multitude\none prisoner whom they wished.\nWhen Pilate saw that he could not\nprevail at all, but rather that a tumult\nwas rising, he took water and washed\nhis hands before the multitude, saying,\n\"I am innocent of the blood of this just\nPerson. You see to it.\"\nAnd at that time they had a notorious\nprisoner called Barabbas.\nAnd all the people answered and said,\n\"His blood be on us and on our\nchildren.\"\nTherefore, when they had gathered\ntogether, Pilate said to them, \"Whom do\nyou want me to release to you?\nBarabbas, or Jesus who is called\nChrist?\"\nThen he released Barabbas to them;\nand when he had scourged Jesus, he\ndelivered Him to be crucified.\nFor he knew that they had handed Him\nover because of envy.\nThen the soldiers of the governor took\nJesus into the Praetorium and gathered\nthe whole garrison around Him.\nWhile he was sitting on the judgment\nseat, his wife sent to him, saying, \"Have\nnothing to do with that just Man, for I\nhave suffered many things today in a\ndream because of Him.\"\nBut the chief priests and elders\npersuaded the multitudes that they\nshould ask for Barabbas and destroy\nJesus.\nAnd they stripped Him and put a\nscarlet robe on Him.\nWhen they had twisted a crown of\nthorns, they put it on His head, and a\nreed in His right hand. And they bowed\nthe knee before Him and mocked Him,\nsaying, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\"\nThen they spat on Him, and took the\nreed and struck Him on the head.\nThe governor answered and said to\nthem, \"Which of the two do you want me\nto release to you?\" They said,\n\"Barabbas!\"\nAnd when they had mocked Him, they\ntook the robe off Him, put His own\nclothes on Him, and led Him away to be\ncrucified.\nPilate said to them, \"What then shall I\ndo with Jesus who is called Christ?\"\nThey all said to him, \"Let Him be\ncrucified!\"\nNow as they came out, they found a\nman of Cyrene, Simon by name. Him\nthey compelled to bear His cross.\nAnd when they had come to a place\ncalled Golgotha, that is to say, Place of\na Skull,\nHe trusted in God; let Him deliver Him\nnow if He will have Him; for He said, \"I\nam the Son of God.\"'\nthey gave Him sour wine mingled with\ngall to drink. But when He had tasted it,\nHe would not drink.\nEven the robbers who were crucified\nwith Him reviled Him with the same\nthing.\nThen they crucified Him, and divided\nHis garments, casting lots, that it might\nbe fulfilled which was spoken by the\nprophet: \"They divided My garments\namong them, And for My clothing they\ncast lots.\"\nSitting down, they kept watch over Him\nthere.\nNow from the sixth hour until the ninth\nhour there was darkness over all the\nland.\nAnd about the ninth hour Jesus cried\nout with a loud voice, saying, \"Eli, Eli,\nlama sabachthani?\" that is, \"My God, My\nGod, why have You forsaken Me?\"\nAnd they put up over His head the\naccusation written against Him: THIS IS\nJESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.\nSome of those who stood there, when\nthey heard that, said, \"This Man is\ncalling for Elijah!\"\nThen two robbers were crucified with\nHim, one on the right and another on the\nleft.\nImmediately one of them ran and took\na sponge, filled it with sour wine and put\nit on a reed, and offered it to Him to\ndrink.\nAnd those who passed by blasphemed\nHim, wagging their heads\nThe rest said, \"Let Him alone; let us\nsee if Elijah will come to save Him.\"\nand saying, \"You who destroy the\ntemple and build it in three days, save\nYourself! If You are the Son of God,\ncome down from the cross.\"\nLikewise the chief priests also,\nmocking with the scribes and elders,\nsaid,\nAnd Jesus cried out again with a loud\nvoice, and yielded up His spirit.\nThen, behold, the veil of the temple\nwas torn in two from top to bottom; and\nthe earth quaked, and the rocks were\nsplit,\n\"He saved others; Himself He cannot\nsave. If He is the King of Israel, let Him\nnow come down from the cross, and we\nwill believe Him.\nand the graves were opened; and\nmany bodies of the saints who had\nfallen asleep were raised;\nand coming out of the graves after His\nresurrection, they went into the holy city\nand appeared to many.\nsaying, \"Sir, we remember, while He\nwas still alive, how that deceiver said,\n\"After three days I will rise.'\nSo when the centurion and those with\nhim, who were guarding Jesus, saw the\nearthquake and the things that had\nhappened, they feared greatly, saying,\n\"Truly this was the Son of God!\"\nTherefore command that the tomb be\nmade secure until the third day, lest His\ndisciples come by night and steal Him\naway, and say to the people, \"He has\nrisen from the dead.' So the last\ndeception will be worse than the first.\"\nAnd many women who followed Jesus\nfrom Galilee, ministering to Him, were\nthere looking on from afar,\nPilate said to them, \"You have a\nguard; go your way, make it as secure\nas you know how.\"\namong whom were Mary Magdalene,\nMary the mother of James and Joses,\nand the mother of Zebedee's sons.\nSo they went and made the tomb\nsecure, sealing the stone and setting the\nguard.\nNow when evening had come, there\ncame a rich man from Arimathea,\nnamed Joseph, who himself had also\nbecome a disciple of Jesus.\nThis man went to Pilate and asked for\nthe body of Jesus. Then Pilate\ncommanded the body to be given to him.\nWhen Joseph had taken the body, he\nwrapped it in a clean linen cloth,\nand laid it in his new tomb which he\nhad hewn out of the rock; and he rolled\na large stone against the door of the\ntomb, and departed.\n28Now after the Sabbath, as the first\nday of the week began to dawn, Mary\nMagdalene and the other Mary came to\nsee the tomb.\nAnd behold, there was a great\nearthquake; for an angel of the Lord\ndescended from heaven, and came and\nrolled back the stone from the door, and\nsat on it.\nHis countenance was like lightning, and\nhis clothing as white as snow.\nAnd Mary Magdalene was there, and\nthe other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.\nAnd the guards shook for fear of him,\nand became like dead men.\nOn the next day, which followed the\nDay of Preparation, the chief priests and\nPharisees gathered together to Pilate,\nBut the angel answered and said to the\nwomen, \"Do not be afraid, for I know\nthat you seek Jesus who was crucified.\nHe is not here; for He is risen, as He\nsaid. Come, see the place where the\nLord lay.\nsaying, \"Tell them, \"His disciples came\nat night and stole Him away while we\nslept.'\nAnd go quickly and tell His disciples\nthat He is risen from the dead, and\nindeed He is going before you into\nGalilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I\nhave told you.\"\nSo they went out quickly from the tomb\nwith fear and great joy, and ran to bring\nHis disciples word.\nAnd if this comes to the governor's\nears, we will appease him and make\nyou secure.\"\nSo they took the money and did as\nthey were instructed; and this saying is\ncommonly reported among the Jews\nuntil this day.\nAnd as they went to tell His disciples,\nbehold, Jesus met them, saying,\n\"Rejoice!\" So they came and held Him\nby the feet and worshiped Him.\nThen Jesus said to them, \"Do not be\nafraid. Go and tell My brethren to go to\nGalilee, and there they will see Me.\"\nNow while they were going, behold,\nsome of the guard came into the city\nand reported to the chief priests all the\nthings that had happened.\nWhen they had assembled with the\nelders and consulted together, they\ngave a large sum of money to the\nsoldiers,\nThen the eleven disciples went away\ninto Galilee, to the mountain which\nJesus had appointed for them.\nWhen they saw Him, they worshiped\nHim; but some doubted.\nAnd Jesus came and spoke to them,\nsaying, \"All authority has been given to\nMe in heaven and on earth.\nGo therefore and make disciples of all\nthe nations, baptizing them in the name\nof the Father and of the Son and of the\nHoly Spirit,\nteaching them to observe all things\nthat I have commanded you; and lo, I\nam with you always, even to the end of\nthe age.\" Amen.\nMark\n1The beginning of the gospel of Jesus\nChrist, the Son of God.\nAs it is written in the Prophets: \"Behold,\nI send My messenger before Your face,\nWho will prepare Your way before You.\"\n\"The voice of one crying in the\nwilderness: \"Prepare the way of the\nLORD; Make His paths straight.\"'\nJohn came baptizing in the wilderness\nand preaching a baptism of repentance\nfor the remission of sins.\nThen all the land of Judea, and those\nfrom Jerusalem, went out to him and\nwere all baptized by him in the Jordan\nRiver, confessing their sins.\nNow John was clothed with camel's\nhair and with a leather belt around his\nwaist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.\nAnd he preached, saying, \"There\ncomes One after me who is mightier\nthan I, whose sandal strap I am not\nworthy to stoop down and loose.\nI indeed baptized you with water, but\nHe will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\"\nIt came to pass in those days that\nJesus came from Nazareth of Galilee,\nand was baptized by John in the Jordan.\nAnd immediately, coming up from the\nwater, He saw the heavens parting and\nthe Spirit descending upon Him like a\ndove.\nThen a voice came from heaven, \"You\nare My beloved Son, in whom I am well\npleased.\"\nImmediately the Spirit drove Him into\nthe wilderness.\nAnd He was there in the wilderness\nforty days, tempted by Satan, and was\nwith the wild beasts; and the angels\nministered to Him.\nNow after John was put in prison,\nJesus came to Galilee, preaching the\ngospel of the kingdom of God,\nand saying, \"The time is fulfilled, and\nthe kingdom of God is at hand. Repent,\nand believe in the gospel.\"\nAnd as He walked by the Sea of\nGalilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his\nbrother casting a net into the sea; for\nthey were fishermen.\nThen Jesus said to them, \"Follow Me,\nand I will make you become fishers of\nmen.\"\nThey immediately left their nets and\nfollowed Him.\nWhen He had gone a little farther from\nthere, He saw James the son of\nZebedee, and John his brother, who\nalso were in the boat mending their nets.\nAnd immediately He called them, and\nthey left their father Zebedee in the boat\nwith the hired servants, and went after\nHim.\nNow as soon as they had come out of\nthe synagogue, they entered the house\nof Simon and Andrew, with James and\nJohn.\nBut Simon's wife's mother lay sick with\na fever, and they told Him about her at\nonce.\nThen they went into Capernaum, and\nimmediately on the Sabbath He entered\nthe synagogue and taught.\nSo He came and took her by the hand\nand lifted her up, and immediately the\nfever left her. And she served them.\nAnd they were astonished at His\nteaching, for He taught them as one\nhaving authority, and not as the scribes.\nAt evening, when the sun had set, they\nbrought to Him all who were sick and\nthose who were demon-possessed.\nNow there was a man in their\nsynagogue with an unclean spirit. And\nhe cried out,\nAnd the whole city was gathered\ntogether at the door.\nsaying, \"Let us alone! What have we to\ndo with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did\nYou come to destroy us? I know who\nYou are--the Holy One of God!\"\nThen He healed many who were sick\nwith various diseases, and cast out\nmany demons; and He did not allow the\ndemons to speak, because they knew\nHim.\nBut Jesus rebuked him, saying, \"Be\nquiet, and come out of him!\"\nAnd when the unclean spirit had\nconvulsed him and cried out with a loud\nvoice, he came out of him.\nThen they were all amazed, so that\nthey questioned among themselves,\nsaying, \"What is this? What new\ndoctrine is this? For with authority He\ncommands even the unclean spirits, and\nthey obey Him.\"\nAnd immediately His fame spread\nthroughout all the region around Galilee.\nNow in the morning, having risen a\nlong while before daylight, He went out\nand departed to a solitary place; and\nthere He prayed.\nAnd Simon and those who were with\nHim searched for Him.\nWhen they found Him, they said to\nHim, \"Everyone is looking for You.\"\nBut He said to them, \"Let us go into\nthe next towns, that I may preach there\nalso, because for this purpose I have\ncome forth.\"\nAnd He was preaching in their\nsynagogues throughout all Galilee, and\ncasting out demons.\nreceive them, not even near the door.\nAnd He preached the word to them.\nNow a leper came to Him, imploring\nHim, kneeling down to Him and saying\nto Him, \"If You are willing, You can\nmake me clean.\"\nThen Jesus, moved with compassion,\nstretched out His hand and touched him,\nand said to him, \"I am willing; be\ncleansed.\"\nThen they came to Him, bringing a\nparalytic who was carried by four men.\nAnd when they could not come near\nHim because of the crowd, they\nuncovered the roof where He was. So\nwhen they had broken through, they let\ndown the bed on which the paralytic was\nlying.\nAs soon as He had spoken,\nimmediately the leprosy left him, and he\nwas cleansed.\nWhen Jesus saw their faith, He said to\nthe paralytic, \"Son, your sins are\nforgiven you.\"\nAnd He strictly warned him and sent\nhim away at once,\nAnd some of the scribes were sitting\nthere and reasoning in their hearts,\nand said to him, \"See that you say\nnothing to anyone; but go your way,\nshow yourself to the priest, and offer for\nyour cleansing those things which\nMoses commanded, as a testimony to\nthem.\"\nHowever, he went out and began to\nproclaim it freely, and to spread the\nmatter, so that Jesus could no longer\nopenly enter the city, but was outside in\ndeserted places; and they came to Him\nfrom every direction.\n\"Why\ndoes\nthis\nMan\nspeak\nblasphemies like this? Who can forgive\nsins but God alone?\"\nBut immediately, when Jesus perceived\nin His spirit that they reasoned thus\nwithin themselves, He said to them,\n\"Why do you reason about these things\nin your hearts?\nWhich is easier, to say to the paralytic,\n\"Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say,\n\"Arise, take up your bed and walk'?\n2And again He entered Capernaum\nafter some days, and it was heard that\nHe was in the house.\nBut that you may know that the Son of\nMan has power on earth to forgive sins\"-He said to the paralytic,\n\"I say to you, arise, take up your bed,\nand go to your house.\"\nImmediately many gathered together,\nso that there was no longer room to\nImmediately he arose, took up the bed,\nand went out in the presence of them all,\nso that all were amazed and glorified\nGod, saying, \"We never saw anything\nlike this!\"\nBut the days will come when the\nbridegroom will be taken away from\nthem, and then they will fast in those\ndays.\nThen He went out again by the sea;\nand all the multitude came to Him, and\nHe taught them.\nAs He passed by, He saw Levi the son\nof Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. And\nHe said to him, \"Follow Me.\" So he\narose and followed Him.\nNow it happened, as He was dining in\nLevi's house, that many tax collectors\nand sinners also sat together with Jesus\nand His disciples; for there were many,\nand they followed Him.\nAnd when the scribes and Pharisees\nsaw Him eating with the tax collectors\nand sinners, they said to His disciples,\n\"How is it that He eats and drinks with\ntax collectors and sinners?\"\nWhen Jesus heard it, He said to them,\n\"Those who are well have no need of a\nphysician, but those who are sick. I did\nnot come to call the righteous, but\nsinners, to repentance.\"\nNo one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth\non an old garment; or else the new\npiece pulls away from the old, and the\ntear is made worse.\nAnd no one puts new wine into old\nwineskins; or else the new wine bursts\nthe wineskins, the wine is spilled, and\nthe wineskins are ruined. But new wine\nmust be put into new wineskins.\"\nNow it happened that He went through\nthe grainfields on the Sabbath; and as\nthey went His disciples began to pluck\nthe heads of grain.\nAnd the Pharisees said to Him, \"Look,\nwhy do they do what is not lawful on the\nSabbath?\"\nBut He said to them, \"Have you never\nread what David did when he was in\nneed and hungry, he and those with\nhim:\nThe disciples of John and of the\nPharisees were fasting. Then they came\nand said to Him, \"Why do the disciples\nof John and of the Pharisees fast, but\nYour disciples do not fast?\"\nhow he went into the house of God in\nthe days of Abiathar the high priest, and\nate the showbread, which is not lawful to\neat except for the priests, and also gave\nsome to those who were with him?\"\nAnd Jesus said to them, \"Can the\nfriends of the bridegroom fast while the\nbridegroom is with them? As long as\nthey have the bridegroom with them\nthey cannot fast.\nAnd He said to them, \"The Sabbath\nwas made for man, and not man for the\nSabbath.\nTherefore the Son of Man is also Lord\nof the Sabbath.\"\n3And He entered the synagogue again,\nand a man was there who had a\nwithered hand.\nSo they watched Him closely, whether\nHe would heal him on the Sabbath, so\nthat they might accuse Him.\nAnd He said to the man who had the\nwithered hand, \"Step forward.\"\nThen He said to them, \"Is it lawful on\nthe Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to\nsave life or to kill?\" But they kept silent.\nAnd when He had looked around at\nthem with anger, being grieved by the\nhardness of their hearts, He said to the\nman, \"Stretch out your hand.\" And he\nstretched it out, and his hand was\nrestored as whole as the other.\nThen the Pharisees went out and\nimmediately plotted with the Herodians\nagainst Him, how they might destroy\nHim.\nBut Jesus withdrew with His disciples to\nthe sea. And a great multitude from\nGalilee followed Him, and from Judea\nand Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond\nthe Jordan; and those from Tyre and\nSidon, a great multitude, when they\nheard how many things He was doing,\ncame to Him.\nFor He healed many, so that as many\nas had afflictions pressed about Him to\ntouch Him.\nAnd the unclean spirits, whenever they\nsaw Him, fell down before Him and cried\nout, saying, \"You are the Son of God.\"\nBut He sternly warned them that they\nshould not make Him known.\nAnd He went up on the mountain and\ncalled to Him those He Himself wanted.\nAnd they came to Him.\nThen He appointed twelve, that they\nmight be with Him and that He might\nsend them out to preach,\nand to have power to heal sicknesses\nand to cast out demons:\nSimon, to whom He gave the name\nPeter;\nJames the son of Zebedee and John\nthe brother of James, to whom He gave\nthe name Boanerges, that is, \"Sons of\nThunder\";\nAndrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew,\nThomas, James the son of Alphaeus,\nThaddaeus, Simon the Cananite;\nand Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed\nHim. And they went into a house.\nSo He told His disciples that a small\nboat should be kept ready for Him\nbecause of the multitude, lest they\nshould crush Him.\nThen the multitude came together\nagain, so that they could not so much as\neat bread.\nBut when His own people heard about\nthis, they went out to lay hold of Him, for\nthey said, \"He is out of His mind.\"\nAnd a multitude was sitting around\nHim; and they said to Him, \"Look, Your\nmother and Your brothers are outside\nseeking You.\"\nAnd the scribes who came down from\nJerusalem said, \"He has Beelzebub,\"\nand, \"By the ruler of the demons He\ncasts out demons.\"\nBut He answered them, saying, \"Who\nis My mother, or My brothers?\"\nSo He called them to Himself and said\nto them in parables: \"How can Satan\ncast out Satan?\nAnd He looked around in a circle at\nthose who sat about Him, and said,\n\"Here are My mother and My brothers!\nFor whoever does the will of God is My\nbrother and My sister and mother.\"\n4And again He began to teach by the\nsea. And a great multitude was gathered\nto Him, so that He got into a boat and\nsat in it on the sea; and the whole\nmultitude was on the land facing the sea.\nIf a kingdom is divided against itself,\nthat kingdom cannot stand.\nAnd if a house is divided against itself,\nthat house cannot stand.\nAnd if Satan has risen up against\nhimself, and is divided, he cannot stand,\nbut has an end.\nNo one can enter a strong man's\nhouse and plunder his goods, unless he\nfirst binds the strong man. And then he\nwill plunder his house.\n\"Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be\nforgiven the sons of men, and whatever\nblasphemies they may utter;\nbut he who blasphemes against the\nHoly Spirit never has forgiveness, but is\nsubject to eternal condemnation\"-30\nbecause they\nunclean spirit.\"\nsaid,\n\"He\nhas\nan\nThen He taught them many things by\nparables, and said to them in His\nteaching:\n\"Listen! Behold, a sower went out to\nsow.\nAnd it happened, as he sowed, that\nsome seed fell by the wayside; and the\nbirds of the air came and devoured it.\nSome fell on stony ground, where it did\nnot have much earth; and immediately it\nsprang up because it had no depth of\nearth.\nThen His brothers and His mother\ncame, and standing outside they sent to\nHim, calling Him.\nBut when the sun was up it was\nscorched, and because it had no root it\nwithered away.\nAnd some seed fell among thorns; and\nthe thorns grew up and choked it, and it\nyielded no crop.\nBut other seed fell on good ground and\nyielded a crop that sprang up, increased\nand produced: some thirtyfold, some\nsixty, and some a hundred.\"\nand they have no root in themselves,\nand so endure only for a time. Afterward,\nwhen tribulation or persecution arises\nfor the word's sake, immediately they\nstumble.\nNow these are the ones sown among\nthorns; they are the ones who hear the\nword,\nAnd He said to them, \"He who has ears\nto hear, let him hear!\"\nBut when He was alone, those around\nHim with the twelve asked Him about\nthe parable.\nAnd He said to them, \"To you it has\nbeen given to know the mystery of the\nkingdom of God; but to those who are\noutside, all things come in parables,\nso that \"Seeing they may see and not\nperceive, And hearing they may hear\nand not understand; Lest they should\nturn, And their sins be forgiven them.\"'\nand the cares of this world, the\ndeceitfulness of riches, and the desires\nfor other things entering in choke the\nword, and it becomes unfruitful.\nBut these are the ones sown on good\nground, those who hear the word,\naccept it, and bear fruit: some thirtyfold,\nsome sixty, and some a hundred.\"\nAlso He said to them, \"Is a lamp\nbrought to be put under a basket or\nunder a bed? Is it not to be set on a\nlampstand?\nAnd He said to them, \"Do you not\nunderstand this parable? How then will\nyou understand all the parables?\nFor there is nothing hidden which will\nnot be revealed, nor has anything been\nkept secret but that it should come to\nlight.\nThe sower sows the word.\nIf anyone has ears to hear, let him\nhear.\"\nAnd these are the ones by the wayside\nwhere the word is sown. When they\nhear, Satan comes immediately and\ntakes away the word that was sown in\ntheir hearts.\nThen He said to them, \"Take heed\nwhat you hear. With the same measure\nyou use, it will be measured to you; and\nto you who hear, more will be given.\nThese likewise are the ones sown on\nstony ground who, when they hear the\nword, immediately receive it with\ngladness;\nFor whoever has, to him more will be\ngiven; but whoever does not have, even\nwhat he has will be taken away from\nhim.\"\nAnd He said, \"The kingdom of God is\nas if a man should scatter seed on the\nground,\nNow when they had left the multitude,\nthey took Him along in the boat as He\nwas. And other little boats were also\nwith Him.\nand should sleep by night and rise by\nday, and the seed should sprout and\ngrow, he himself does not know how.\nAnd a great windstorm arose, and the\nwaves beat into the boat, so that it was\nalready filling.\nFor the earth yields crops by itself: first\nthe blade, then the head, after that the\nfull grain in the head.\nBut when the grain ripens, immediately\nhe puts in the sickle, because the\nharvest has come.\"\nThen He said, \"To what shall we liken\nthe kingdom of God? Or with what\nparable shall we picture it?\nIt is like a mustard seed which, when it\nis sown on the ground, is smaller than\nall the seeds on earth;\nbut when it is sown, it grows up and\nbecomes greater than all herbs, and\nshoots out large branches, so that the\nbirds of the air may nest under its\nshade.\"\nAnd with many such parables He\nspoke the word to them as they were\nable to hear it.\nBut without a parable He did not speak\nto them. And when they were alone, He\nexplained all things to His disciples.\nOn the same day, when evening had\ncome, He said to them, \"Let us cross\nover to the other side.\"\nBut He was in the stern, asleep on a\npillow. And they awoke Him and said to\nHim, \"Teacher, do You not care that we\nare perishing?\"\nThen He arose and rebuked the wind,\nand said to the sea, \"Peace, be still!\"\nAnd the wind ceased and there was a\ngreat calm.\nBut He said to them, \"Why are you so\nfearful? How is it that you have no\nfaith?\"\nAnd they feared exceedingly, and said\nto one another, \"Who can this be, that\neven the wind and the sea obey Him!\"\n5Then they came to the other side of\nthe sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.\nAnd when He had come out of the boat,\nimmediately there met Him out of the\ntombs a man with an unclean spirit,\nwho had his dwelling among the tombs;\nand no one could bind him, not even\nwith chains,\nbecause he had often been bound with\nshackles and chains. And the chains\nhad been pulled apart by him, and the\nshackles broken in pieces; neither could\nanyone tame him.\nAnd they went out to see what it was\nthat had happened.\nAnd always, night and day, he was in\nthe mountains and in the tombs, crying\nout and cutting himself with stones.\nWhen he saw Jesus from afar, he ran\nand worshiped Him.\nAnd he cried out with a loud voice and\nsaid, \"What have I to do with You, Jesus,\nSon of the Most High God? I implore\nYou by God that You do not torment\nme.\"\nFor He said to him, \"Come out of the\nman, unclean spirit!\"\nThen they came to Jesus, and saw the\none who had been demon-possessed\nand had the legion, sitting and clothed\nand in his right mind. And they were\nafraid.\nAnd those who saw it told them how it\nhappened to him who had been demonpossessed, and about the swine.\nThen they began to plead with Him to\ndepart from their region.\nAnd when He got into the boat, he who\nhad been demon-possessed begged\nHim that he might be with Him.\nThen He asked him, \"What is your\nname?\" And he answered, saying, \"My\nname is Legion; for we are many.\"\nAlso he begged Him earnestly that He\nwould not send them out of the country.\nHowever, Jesus did not permit him,\nbut said to him, \"Go home to your\nfriends, and tell them what great things\nthe Lord has done for you, and how He\nhas had compassion on you.\"\nNow a large herd of swine was feeding\nthere near the mountains.\nAnd he departed and began to\nproclaim in Decapolis all that Jesus had\ndone for him; and all marveled.\nSo all the demons begged Him, saying,\n\"Send us to the swine, that we may\nenter them.\"\nAnd at once Jesus gave them\npermission. Then the unclean spirits\nwent out and entered the swine (there\nwere about two thousand); and the herd\nran violently down the steep place into\nthe sea, and drowned in the sea.\nSo those who fed the swine fled, and\nthey told it in the city and in the country.\nNow when Jesus had crossed over\nagain by boat to the other side, a great\nmultitude gathered to Him; and He was\nby the sea.\nAnd behold, one of the rulers of the\nsynagogue came, Jairus by name. And\nwhen he saw Him, he fell at His feet\nand begged Him earnestly, saying,\n\"My little daughter lies at the point of\ndeath. Come and lay Your hands on her,\nthat she may be healed, and she will\nlive.\"\nAnd He said to her, \"Daughter, your\nfaith has made you well. Go in peace,\nand be healed of your affliction.\"\nSo Jesus went with him, and a great\nmultitude followed Him and thronged\nHim.\nNow a certain woman had a flow of\nblood for twelve years,\nand had suffered many things from\nmany physicians. She had spent all that\nshe had and was no better, but rather\ngrew worse.\nWhen she heard about Jesus, she\ncame behind Him in the crowd and\ntouched His garment.\nFor she said, \"If only I may touch His\nclothes, I shall be made well.\"\nWhile He was still speaking, some\ncame from the ruler of the synagogue's\nhouse who said, \"Your daughter is dead.\nWhy trouble the Teacher any further?\"\nAs soon as Jesus heard the word that\nwas spoken, He said to the ruler of the\nsynagogue, \"Do not be afraid; only\nbelieve.\"\nAnd He permitted no one to follow Him\nexcept Peter, James, and John the\nbrother of James.\nThen He came to the house of the\nruler of the synagogue, and saw a\ntumult and those who wept and wailed\nloudly.\nImmediately the fountain of her blood\nwas dried up, and she felt in her body\nthat she was healed of the affliction.\nWhen He came in, He said to them,\n\"Why make this commotion and weep?\nThe child is not dead, but sleeping.\"\nAnd Jesus, immediately knowing in\nHimself that power had gone out of Him,\nturned around in the crowd and said,\n\"Who touched My clothes?\"\nBut His disciples said to Him, \"You see\nthe multitude thronging You, and You\nsay, \"Who touched Me?\"'\nAnd He looked around to see her who\nhad done this thing.\nBut the woman, fearing and trembling,\nknowing what had happened to her,\ncame and fell down before Him and told\nHim the whole truth.\nAnd they ridiculed Him. But when He\nhad put them all outside, He took the\nfather and the mother of the child, and\nthose who were with Him, and entered\nwhere the child was lying.\nThen He took the child by the hand,\nand said to her, \"Talitha, cumi,\" which is\ntranslated, \"Little girl, I say to you,\narise.\"\nImmediately the girl arose and walked,\nfor she was twelve years of age. And\nthey were overcome with great\namazement.\nBut He commanded them strictly that\nno one should know it, and said that\nsomething should be given her to eat.\nno bread, no copper in their money\nbelts-9\n6Then He went out from there and\ncame to His own country, and His\ndisciples followed Him.\nbut to wear sandals, and not to put on\ntwo tunics.\nAlso He said to them, \"In whatever\nplace you enter a house, stay there till\nyou depart from that place.\nAnd when the Sabbath had come, He\nbegan to teach in the synagogue. And\nmany hearing Him were astonished,\nsaying, \"Where did this Man get these\nthings? And what wisdom is this which\nis given to Him, that such mighty works\nare performed by His hands!\nAnd whoever will not receive you nor\nhear you, when you depart from there,\nshake off the dust under your feet as a\ntestimony against them. Assuredly, I say\nto you, it will be more tolerable for\nSodom and Gomorrah in the day of\njudgment than for that city!\"\nIs this not the carpenter, the Son of\nMary, and brother of James, Joses,\nJudas, and Simon? And are not His\nsisters here with us?\" So they were\noffended at Him.\nBut Jesus said to them, \"A prophet is\nnot without honor except in his own\ncountry, among his own relatives, and in\nhis own house.\"\nNow He could do no mighty work there,\nexcept that He laid His hands on a few\nsick people and healed them.\nAnd He marveled because of their\nunbelief. Then He went about the\nvillages in a circuit, teaching.\nAnd He called the twelve to Himself,\nand began to send them out two by two,\nand gave them power over unclean\nspirits.\nHe commanded them to take nothing\nfor the journey except a staff--no bag,\nSo they went out and preached that\npeople should repent.\nAnd they cast out many demons, and\nanointed with oil many who were sick,\nand healed them.\nNow King Herod heard of Him, for His\nname had become well known. And he\nsaid, \"John the Baptist is risen from the\ndead, and therefore these powers are at\nwork in him.\"\nOthers said, \"It is Elijah.\" And others\nsaid, \"It is the Prophet, or like one of the\nprophets.\"\nBut when Herod heard, he said, \"This\nis John, whom I beheaded; he has been\nraised from the dead!\"\nFor Herod himself had sent and laid\nhold of John, and bound him in prison\nfor the sake of Herodias, his brother\nPhilip's wife; for he had married her.\nBecause John had said to Herod, \"It is\nnot lawful for you to have your brother's\nwife.\"\nImmediately the king sent an\nexecutioner and commanded his head\nto be brought. And he went and\nbeheaded him in prison,\nTherefore Herodias held it against him\nand wanted to kill him, but she could\nnot;\nbrought his head on a platter, and\ngave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to\nher mother.\nfor Herod feared John, knowing that\nhe was a just and holy man, and he\nprotected him. And when he heard him,\nhe did many things, and heard him\ngladly.\nWhen his disciples heard of it, they\ncame and took away his corpse and laid\nit in a tomb.\nThen an opportune day came when\nHerod on his birthday gave a feast for\nhis nobles, the high officers, and the\nchief men of Galilee.\nAnd when Herodias' daughter herself\ncame in and danced, and pleased\nHerod and those who sat with him, the\nking said to the girl, \"Ask me whatever\nyou want, and I will give it to you.\"\nHe also swore to her, \"Whatever you\nask me, I will give you, up to half my\nkingdom.\"\nSo she went out and said to her\nmother, \"What shall I ask?\" And she\nsaid, \"The head of John the Baptist!\"\nImmediately she came in with haste to\nthe king and asked, saying, \"I want you\nto give me at once the head of John the\nBaptist on a platter.\"\nThen the apostles gathered to Jesus\nand told Him all things, both what they\nhad done and what they had taught.\nAnd He said to them, \"Come aside by\nyourselves to a deserted place and rest\na while.\" For there were many coming\nand going, and they did not even have\ntime to eat.\nSo they departed to a deserted place\nin the boat by themselves.\nBut the multitudes saw them departing,\nand many knew Him and ran there on\nfoot from all the cities. They arrived\nbefore them and came together to Him.\nAnd Jesus, when He came out, saw a\ngreat multitude and was moved with\ncompassion for them, because they\nwere like sheep not having a shepherd.\nSo He began to teach them many things.\nAnd the king was exceedingly sorry;\nyet, because of the oaths and because\nof those who sat with him, he did not\nwant to refuse her.\nWhen the day was now far spent, His\ndisciples came to Him and said, \"This is\na deserted place, and already the hour\nis late.\nSend them away, that they may go\ninto the surrounding country and villages\nand buy themselves bread; for they\nhave nothing to eat.\"\nBut He answered and said to them,\n\"You give them something to eat.\" And\nthey said to Him, \"Shall we go and buy\ntwo hundred denarii worth of bread and\ngive them something to eat?\"\nBut He said to them, \"How many\nloaves do you have? Go and see.\" And\nwhen they found out they said, \"Five,\nand two fish.\"\nThen He commanded them to make\nthem all sit down in groups on the green\ngrass.\nSo they sat down in ranks, in hundreds\nand in fifties.\nAnd when He had sent them away, He\ndeparted to the mountain to pray.\nNow when evening came, the boat\nwas in the middle of the sea; and He\nwas alone on the land.\nThen He saw them straining at rowing,\nfor the wind was against them. Now\nabout the fourth watch of the night He\ncame to them, walking on the sea, and\nwould have passed them by.\nAnd when they saw Him walking on\nthe sea, they supposed it was a ghost,\nand cried out;\nfor they all saw Him and were troubled.\nBut immediately He talked with them\nand said to them, \"Be of good cheer! It\nis I; do not be afraid.\"\nAnd when He had taken the five\nloaves and the two fish, He looked up to\nheaven, blessed and broke the loaves,\nand gave them to His disciples to set\nbefore them; and the two fish He divided\namong them all.\nThen He went up into the boat to them,\nand the wind ceased. And they were\ngreatly amazed in themselves beyond\nmeasure, and marveled.\nFor they had not understood about the\nloaves, because their heart was\nhardened.\nSo they all ate and were filled.\nAnd they took up twelve baskets full of\nfragments and of the fish.\nWhen they had crossed over, they\ncame to the land of Gennesaret and\nanchored there.\nNow those who had eaten the loaves\nwere about five thousand men.\nAnd when they came out of the boat,\nimmediately the people recognized Him,\nImmediately He made His disciples get\ninto the boat and go before Him to the\nother side, to Bethsaida, while He sent\nthe multitude away.\nran through that whole surrounding\nregion, and began to carry about on\nbeds those who were sick to wherever\nthey heard He was.\nWherever He entered, into villages,\ncities, or the country, they laid the sick in\nthe marketplaces, and begged Him that\nthey might just touch the hem of His\ngarment. And as many as touched Him\nwere made well.\n7Then the Pharisees and some of the\nscribes came together to Him, having\ncome from Jerusalem.\nNow when they saw some of His\ndisciples eat bread with defiled, that is,\nwith unwashed hands, they found fault.\nFor the Pharisees and all the Jews do\nnot eat unless they wash their hands in\na special way, holding the tradition of\nthe elders.\nFor laying aside the commandment of\nGod, you hold the tradition of men --the\nwashing of pitchers and cups, and many\nother such things you do.\"\nHe said to them, \"All too well you reject\nthe commandment of God, that you may\nkeep your tradition.\nFor Moses said, \"Honor your father\nand your mother'; and, \"He who curses\nfather or mother, let him be put to\ndeath.'\nBut you say, \"If a man says to his\nfather or mother, \"Whatever profit you\nmight have received from me is\nCorban\"--' (that is, a gift to God),\nthen you no longer let him do anything\nfor his father or his mother,\nWhen they come from the marketplace,\nthey do not eat unless they wash. And\nthere are many other things which they\nhave received and hold, like the\nwashing of cups, pitchers, copper\nvessels, and couches.\nmaking the word of God of no effect\nthrough your tradition which you have\nhanded down. And many such things\nyou do.\"\nWhen He had called all the multitude\nto Himself, He said to them, \"Hear Me,\neveryone, and understand:\nThen the Pharisees and scribes asked\nHim, \"Why do Your disciples not walk\naccording to the tradition of the elders,\nbut eat bread with unwashed hands?\"\nHe answered and said to them, \"Well\ndid Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites,\nas it is written: \"This people honors Me\nwith their lips, But their heart is far from\nMe.\nAnd in vain they worship Me, Teaching\nas doctrines the commandments of\nmen.'\nThere is nothing that enters a man\nfrom outside which can defile him; but\nthe things which come out of him, those\nare the things that defile a man.\nIf anyone has ears to hear, let him\nhear!\"\nWhen He had entered a house away\nfrom the crowd, His disciples asked Him\nconcerning the parable.\nSo He said to them, \"Are you thus\nwithout understanding also? Do you not\nperceive that whatever enters a man\nfrom outside cannot defile him,\nAnd she answered and said to Him,\n\"Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs under\nthe table eat from the children's\ncrumbs.\"\nbecause it does not enter his heart but\nhis stomach, and is eliminated, thus\npurifying all foods?\"\nThen He said to her, \"For this saying\ngo your way; the demon has gone out of\nyour daughter.\"\nAnd He said, \"What comes out of a\nman, that defiles a man.\nAnd when she had come to her house,\nshe found the demon gone out, and her\ndaughter lying on the bed.\nFor from within, out of the heart of men,\nproceed evil thoughts, adulteries,\nfornications, murders,\nthefts, covetousness, wickedness,\ndeceit,\nlewdness,\nan\nevil\neye,\nblasphemy, pride, foolishness.\nAgain, departing from the region of\nTyre and Sidon, He came through the\nmidst of the region of Decapolis to the\nSea of Galilee.\nAll these evil things come from within\nand defile a man.\"\nThen they brought to Him one who\nwas deaf and had an impediment in his\nspeech, and they begged Him to put His\nhand on him.\nFrom there He arose and went to the\nregion of Tyre and Sidon. And He\nentered a house and wanted no one to\nknow it, but He could not be hidden.\nFor a woman whose young daughter\nhad an unclean spirit heard about Him,\nand she came and fell at His feet.\nThe woman was a Greek, a SyroPhoenician by birth, and she kept asking\nHim to cast the demon out of her\ndaughter.\nBut Jesus said to her, \"Let the children\nbe filled first, for it is not good to take the\nchildren's bread and throw it to the little\ndogs.\"\nAnd He took him aside from the\nmultitude, and put His fingers in his ears,\nand He spat and touched his tongue.\nThen, looking up to heaven, He sighed,\nand said to him, \"Ephphatha,\" that is,\n\"Be opened.\"\nImmediately his ears were opened,\nand the impediment of his tongue was\nloosed, and he spoke plainly.\nThen He commanded them that they\nshould tell no one; but the more He\ncommanded them, the more widely they\nproclaimed it.\nAnd they were astonished beyond\nmeasure, saying, \"He has done all\nthings well. He makes both the deaf to\nhear and the mute to speak.\"\n8In those days, the multitude being\nvery great and having nothing to eat,\nJesus called His disciples to Him and\nsaid to them,\n\"I have compassion on the multitude,\nbecause they have now continued with\nMe three days and have nothing to eat.\nAnd if I send them away hungry to their\nown houses, they will faint on the way;\nfor some of them have come from afar.\"\nThen His disciples answered Him,\n\"How can one satisfy these people with\nbread here in the wilderness?\"\nHe asked them, \"How many loaves do\nyou have?\" And they said, \"Seven.\"\nSo He commanded the multitude to sit\ndown on the ground. And He took the\nseven loaves and gave thanks, broke\nthem and gave them to His disciples to\nset before them; and they set them\nbefore the multitude.\nThey also had a few small fish; and\nhaving blessed them, He said to set\nthem also before them.\nSo they ate and were filled, and they\ntook up seven large baskets of leftover\nfragments.\nNow those who had eaten were about\nfour thousand. And He sent them away,\nimmediately got into the boat with His\ndisciples, and came to the region of\nDalmanutha.\nThen the Pharisees came out and\nbegan to dispute with Him, seeking from\nHim a sign from heaven, testing Him.\nBut He sighed deeply in His spirit, and\nsaid, \"Why does this generation seek a\nsign? Assuredly, I say to you, no sign\nshall be given to this generation.\"\nAnd He left them, and getting into the\nboat again, departed to the other side.\nNow the disciples had forgotten to take\nbread, and they did not have more than\none loaf with them in the boat.\nThen He charged them, saying, \"Take\nheed, beware of the leaven of the\nPharisees and the leaven of Herod.\"\nAnd they reasoned among themselves,\nsaying, \"It is because we have no\nbread.\"\nBut Jesus, being aware of it, said to\nthem, \"Why do you reason because you\nhave no bread? Do you not yet perceive\nnor understand? Is your heart still\nhardened?\nHaving eyes, do you not see? And\nhaving ears, do you not hear? And do\nyou not remember?\nWhen I broke the five loaves for the\nfive thousand, how many baskets full of\nfragments did you take up?\" They said\nto Him, \"Twelve.\"\n\"Also, when I broke the seven for the\nfour thousand, how many large baskets\nfull of fragments did you take up?\" And\nthey said, \"Seven.\"\nSo He said to them, \"How is it you do\nnot understand?\"\nThen He strictly warned them that they\nshould tell no one about Him.\nAnd He began to teach them that the\nSon of Man must suffer many things,\nand be rejected by the elders and chief\npriests and scribes, and be killed, and\nafter three days rise again.\nThen He came to Bethsaida; and they\nbrought a blind man to Him, and begged\nHim to touch him.\nHe spoke this word openly. Then Peter\ntook Him aside and began to rebuke\nHim.\nSo He took the blind man by the hand\nand led him out of the town. And when\nHe had spit on his eyes and put His\nhands on him, He asked him if he saw\nanything.\nBut when He had turned around and\nlooked at His disciples, He rebuked\nPeter, saying, \"Get behind Me, Satan!\nFor you are not mindful of the things of\nGod, but the things of men.\"\nAnd he looked up and said, \"I see men\nlike trees, walking.\"\nThen He put His hands on his eyes\nagain and made him look up. And he\nwas restored and saw everyone clearly.\nWhen He had called the people to\nHimself, with His disciples also, He said\nto them, \"Whoever desires to come after\nMe, let him deny himself, and take up\nhis cross, and follow Me.\nThen He sent him away to his house,\nsaying, \"Neither go into the town, nor tell\nanyone in the town.\"\nFor whoever desires to save his life\nwill lose it, but whoever loses his life for\nMy sake and the gospel's will save it.\nNow Jesus and His disciples went out\nto the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and\non the road He asked His disciples,\nsaying to them, \"Who do men say that I\nam?\"\nFor what will it profit a man if he gains\nthe whole world, and loses his own\nsoul?\nOr what will a man give in exchange\nfor his soul?\nSo they answered, \"John the Baptist;\nbut some say, Elijah; and others, one of\nthe prophets.\"\nHe said to them, \"But who do you say\nthat I am?\" Peter answered and said to\nHim, \"You are the Christ.\"\nFor whoever is ashamed of Me and\nMy words in this adulterous and sinful\ngeneration, of him the Son of Man also\nwill be ashamed when He comes in the\nglory of His Father with the holy angels.\"\n9And He said to them, \"Assuredly, I\nsay to you that there are some standing\nhere who will not taste death till they see\nthe kingdom of God present with\npower.\"\nSo they kept this word to themselves,\nquestioning what the rising from the\ndead meant.\nAnd they asked Him, saying, \"Why do\nthe scribes say that Elijah must come\nfirst?\"\nNow after six days Jesus took Peter,\nJames, and John, and led them up on a\nhigh mountain apart by themselves; and\nHe was transfigured before them.\nHis\nclothes\nbecame\nshining,\nexceedingly white, like snow, such as no\nlaunderer on earth can whiten them.\nAnd Elijah appeared to them with\nMoses, and they were talking with Jesus.\nThen Peter answered and said to Jesus,\n\"Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and\nlet us make three tabernacles: one for\nYou, one for Moses, and one for Elijah\"6\nbecause he did not know what to say,\nfor they were greatly afraid.\nAnd a cloud came and overshadowed\nthem; and a voice came out of the cloud,\nsaying, \"This is My beloved Son. Hear\nHim!\"\nThen He answered and told them,\n\"Indeed, Elijah is coming first and\nrestores all things. And how is it written\nconcerning the Son of Man, that He\nmust suffer many things and be treated\nwith contempt?\nBut I say to you that Elijah has also\ncome, and they did to him whatever they\nwished, as it is written of him.\"\nAnd when He came to the disciples,\nHe saw a great multitude around them,\nand scribes disputing with them.\nImmediately, when they saw Him, all\nthe people were greatly amazed, and\nrunning to Him, greeted Him.\nAnd He asked the scribes, \"What are\nyou discussing with them?\"\nThen one of the crowd answered and\nsaid, \"Teacher, I brought You my son,\nwho has a mute spirit.\nSuddenly, when they had looked\naround, they saw no one anymore, but\nonly Jesus with themselves.\nNow as they came down from the\nmountain, He commanded them that\nthey should tell no one the things they\nhad seen, till the Son of Man had risen\nfrom the dead.\nAnd wherever it seizes him, it throws\nhim down; he foams at the mouth,\ngnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid.\nSo I spoke to Your disciples, that they\nshould cast it out, but they could not.\"\nHe answered him and said, \"O\nfaithless generation, how long shall I be\nwith you? How long shall I bear with\nyou? Bring him to Me.\"\nSo He said to them, \"This kind can\ncome out by nothing but prayer and\nfasting.\"\nThen they brought him to Him. And\nwhen he saw Him, immediately the spirit\nconvulsed him, and he fell on the\nground and wallowed, foaming at the\nmouth.\nThen they departed from there and\npassed through Galilee, and He did not\nwant anyone to know it.\nSo He asked his father, \"How long has\nthis been happening to him?\" And he\nsaid, \"From childhood.\nFor He taught His disciples and said to\nthem, \"The Son of Man is being\nbetrayed into the hands of men, and\nthey will kill Him. And after He is killed,\nHe will rise the third day.\"\nAnd often he has thrown him both into\nthe fire and into the water to destroy him.\nBut if You can do anything, have\ncompassion on us and help us.\"\nBut they did not understand this saying,\nand were afraid to ask Him.\nJesus said to him, \"If you can believe,\nall things are possible to him who\nbelieves.\"\nThen He came to Capernaum. And\nwhen He was in the house He asked\nthem, \"What was it you disputed among\nyourselves on the road?\"\nImmediately the father of the child\ncried out and said with tears, \"Lord, I\nbelieve; help my unbelief!\"\nBut they kept silent, for on the road\nthey had disputed among themselves\nwho would be the greatest.\nWhen Jesus saw that the people came\nrunning together, He rebuked the\nunclean spirit, saying to it, \"Deaf and\ndumb spirit, I command you, come out\nof him and enter him no more!\"\nAnd He sat down, called the twelve,\nand said to them, \"If anyone desires to\nbe first, he shall be last of all and\nservant of all.\"\nThen the spirit cried out, convulsed\nhim greatly, and came out of him. And\nhe became as one dead, so that many\nsaid, \"He is dead.\"\nThen He took a little child and set him\nin the midst of them. And when He had\ntaken him in His arms, He said to them,\nBut Jesus took him by the hand and\nlifted him up, and he arose.\n\"Whoever receives one of these little\nchildren in My name receives Me; and\nwhoever receives Me, receives not Me\nbut Him who sent Me.\"\nAnd when He had come into the house,\nHis disciples asked Him privately, \"Why\ncould we not cast it out?\"\nNow John answered Him, saying,\n\"Teacher, we saw someone who does\nnot follow us casting out demons in Your\nname, and we forbade him because he\ndoes not follow us.\"\nthan having two eyes, to be cast into\nhell fire--\nBut Jesus said, \"Do not forbid him, for\nno one who works a miracle in My name\ncan soon afterward speak evil of Me.\nwhere \"Their worm does not die And\nthe fire is not quenched.'\nFor he who is not against us is on our\nside.\n\"For everyone will be seasoned with\nfire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned\nwith salt.\nFor whoever gives you a cup of water\nto drink in My name, because you\nbelong to Christ, assuredly, I say to you,\nhe will by no means lose his reward.\nSalt is good, but if the salt loses its\nflavor, how will you season it? Have salt\nin yourselves, and have peace with one\nanother.\"\n10Then He arose from there and\n\"But whoever causes one of these little\nones who believe in Me to stumble, it\nwould be better for him if a millstone\nwere hung around his neck, and he\nwere thrown into the sea.\nIf your hand causes you to sin, cut it\noff. It is better for you to enter into life\nmaimed, rather than having two hands,\nto go to hell, into the fire that shall never\nbe quenched-44\nwhere \"Their worm does not die And\nthe fire is not quenched.'\nAnd if your foot causes you to sin, cut\nit off. It is better for you to enter life lame,\nrather than having two feet, to be cast\ninto hell, into the fire that shall never be\nquenched-46\nwhere \"Their worm does not die And\nthe fire is not quenched.'\nAnd if your eye causes you to sin,\npluck it out. It is better for you to enter\nthe kingdom of God with one eye, rather\ncame to the region of Judea by the other\nside of the Jordan. And multitudes\ngathered to Him again, and as He was\naccustomed, He taught them again.\nThe Pharisees came and asked Him,\n\"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his\nwife?\" testing Him.\nAnd He answered and said to them,\n\"What did Moses command you?\"\nThey said, \"Moses permitted a man to\nwrite a certificate of divorce, and to\ndismiss her.\"\nAnd Jesus answered and said to them,\n\"Because of the hardness of your heart\nhe wrote you this precept.\nBut from the beginning of the creation,\nGod \"made them male and female.'\n\"For this reason a man shall leave his\nfather and mother and be joined to his\nwife,\nand asked Him, \"Good Teacher, what\nshall I do that I may inherit eternal life?\"\nand the two shall become one flesh'; so\nthen they are no longer two, but one\nflesh.\nSo Jesus said to him, \"Why do you call\nMe good? No one is good but One, that\nis, God.\nTherefore what God has\ntogether, let not man separate.\"\njoined\nIn the house His disciples also asked\nHim again about the same matter.\nSo He said to them, \"Whoever\ndivorces his wife and marries another\ncommits adultery against her.\nAnd if a woman divorces her husband\nand marries another, she commits\nadultery.\"\nThen they brought little children to Him,\nthat He might touch them; but the\ndisciples rebuked those who brought\nthem.\nYou know the commandments: \"Do\nnot commit adultery,' \"Do not murder,'\n\"Do not steal,' \"Do not bear false\nwitness,' \"Do not defraud,' \"Honor your\nfather and your mother.\"'\nAnd he answered and said to Him,\n\"Teacher, all these things I have kept\nfrom my youth.\"\nThen Jesus, looking at him, loved him,\nand said to him, \"One thing you lack: Go\nyour way, sell whatever you have and\ngive to the poor, and you will have\ntreasure in heaven; and come, take up\nthe cross, and follow Me.\"\nBut he was sad at this word, and went\naway sorrowful, for he had great\npossessions.\nBut when Jesus saw it, He was greatly\ndispleased and said to them, \"Let the\nlittle children come to Me, and do not\nforbid them; for of such is the kingdom\nof God.\nThen Jesus looked around and said to\nHis disciples, \"How hard it is for those\nwho have riches to enter the kingdom of\nGod!\"\nAssuredly, I say to you, whoever does\nnot receive the kingdom of God as a\nlittle child will by no means enter it.\"\nAnd He took them up in His arms, laid\nHis hands on them, and blessed them.\nNow as He was going out on the road,\none came running, knelt before Him,\nAnd the disciples were astonished at\nHis words. But Jesus answered again\nand said to them, \"Children, how hard it\nis for those who trust in riches to enter\nthe kingdom of God!\nIt is easier for a camel to go through\nthe eye of a needle than for a rich man\nto enter the kingdom of God.\"\nAnd they were greatly astonished,\nsaying among themselves, \"Who then\ncan be saved?\"\nand they will mock Him, and scourge\nHim, and spit on Him, and kill Him. And\nthe third day He will rise again.\"\nBut Jesus looked at them and said,\n\"With men it is impossible, but not with\nGod; for with God all things are\npossible.\"\nThen James and John, the sons of\nZebedee, came to Him, saying,\n\"Teacher, we want You to do for us\nwhatever we ask.\"\nThen Peter began to say to Him, \"See,\nwe have left all and followed You.\"\nAnd He said to them, \"What do you\nwant Me to do for you?\"\nSo Jesus answered and said,\n\"Assuredly, I say to you, there is no one\nwho has left house or brothers or sisters\nor father or mother or wife or children or\nlands, for My sake and the gospel's,\nwho shall not receive a hundredfold\nnow in this time--houses and brothers\nand sisters and mothers and children\nand lands, with persecutions--and in the\nage to come, eternal life.\nBut many who are first will be last, and\nthe last first.\"\nThey said to Him, \"Grant us that we\nmay sit, one on Your right hand and the\nother on Your left, in Your glory.\"\nBut Jesus said to them, \"You do not\nknow what you ask. Are you able to\ndrink the cup that I drink, and be\nbaptized with the baptism that I am\nbaptized with?\"\nThey said to Him, \"We are able.\" So\nJesus said to them, \"You will indeed\ndrink the cup that I drink, and with the\nbaptism I am baptized with you will be\nbaptized;\nNow they were on the road, going up\nto Jerusalem, and Jesus was going\nbefore them; and they were amazed.\nAnd as they followed they were afraid.\nThen He took the twelve aside again\nand began to tell them the things that\nwould happen to Him:\n\"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem,\nand the Son of Man will be betrayed to\nthe chief priests and to the scribes; and\nthey will condemn Him to death and\ndeliver Him to the Gentiles;\nbut to sit on My right hand and on My\nleft is not Mine to give, but it is for those\nfor whom it is prepared.\"\nAnd when the ten heard it, they began\nto be greatly displeased with James and\nJohn.\nBut Jesus called them to Himself and\nsaid to them, \"You know that those who\nare considered rulers over the Gentiles\nlord it over them, and their great ones\nexercise authority over them.\nYet it shall not be so among you; but\nwhoever desires to become great\namong you shall be your servant.\nAnd whoever of you desires to be first\nshall be slave of all.\n11Now when they drew near\nJerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany,\nat the Mount of Olives, He sent two of\nHis disciples;\nFor even the Son of Man did not come\nto be served, but to serve, and to give\nHis life a ransom for many.\"\nNow they came to Jericho. As He went\nout of Jericho with His disciples and a\ngreat multitude, blind Bartimaeus, the\nson of Timaeus, sat by the road begging.\nand He said to them, \"Go into the\nvillage opposite you; and as soon as\nyou have entered it you will find a colt\ntied, on which no one has sat. Loose it\nand bring it.\nAnd if anyone says to you, \"Why are\nyou doing this?' say, \"The Lord has\nneed of it,' and immediately he will send\nit here.\"\nAnd when he heard that it was Jesus\nof Nazareth, he began to cry out and\nsay, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy\non me!\"\nSo they went their way, and found the\ncolt tied by the door outside on the\nstreet, and they loosed it.\nThen many warned him to be quiet;\nbut he cried out all the more, \"Son of\nDavid, have mercy on me!\"\nBut some of those who stood there said\nto them, \"What are you doing, loosing\nthe colt?\"\nSo Jesus stood still and commanded\nhim to be called. Then they called the\nblind man, saying to him, \"Be of good\ncheer. Rise, He is calling you.\"\nAnd throwing aside his garment, he\nrose and came to Jesus.\nSo Jesus answered and said to him,\n\"What do you want Me to do for you?\"\nThe blind man said to Him, \"Rabboni,\nthat I may receive my sight.\"\nThen Jesus said to him, \"Go your way;\nyour faith has made you well.\" And\nimmediately he received his sight and\nfollowed Jesus on the road.\nAnd they spoke to them just as Jesus\nhad commanded. So they let them go.\nThen they brought the colt to Jesus and\nthrew their clothes on it, and He sat on it.\nAnd many spread their clothes on the\nroad, and others cut down leafy\nbranches from the trees and spread\nthem on the road.\nThen those who went before and those\nwho followed cried out, saying:\n\"Hosanna! \"Blessed is He who comes in\nthe name of the LORD!'\nBlessed is the kingdom of our father\nDavid That comes in the name of the\nLord! Hosanna in the highest!\"\nWhen evening had come, He went out\nof the city.\nAnd Jesus went into Jerusalem and\ninto the temple. So when He had looked\naround at all things, as the hour was\nalready late, He went out to Bethany\nwith the twelve.\nNow the next day, when they had\ncome out from Bethany, He was hungry.\nAnd seeing from afar a fig tree having\nleaves, He went to see if perhaps He\nwould find something on it. When He\ncame to it, He found nothing but leaves,\nfor it was not the season for figs.\nIn response Jesus said to it, \"Let no\none eat fruit from you ever again.\" And\nHis disciples heard it.\nSo they came to Jerusalem. Then\nJesus went into the temple and began to\ndrive out those who bought and sold in\nthe temple, and overturned the tables of\nthe money changers and the seats of\nthose who sold doves.\nAnd He would not allow anyone to\ncarry wares through the temple.\nThen He taught, saying to them, \"Is it\nnot written, \"My house shall be called a\nhouse of prayer for all nations'? But you\nhave made it a \"den of thieves.\"'\nAnd the scribes and chief priests\nheard it and sought how they might\ndestroy Him; for they feared Him,\nbecause all the people were astonished\nat His teaching.\nNow in the morning, as they passed by,\nthey saw the fig tree dried up from the\nroots.\nAnd Peter, remembering, said to Him,\n\"Rabbi, look! The fig tree which You\ncursed has withered away.\"\nSo Jesus answered and said to them,\n\"Have faith in God.\nFor assuredly, I say to you, whoever\nsays to this mountain, \"Be removed and\nbe cast into the sea,' and does not doubt\nin his heart, but believes that those\nthings he says will be done, he will have\nwhatever he says.\nTherefore I say to you, whatever\nthings you ask when you pray, believe\nthat you receive them, and you will have\nthem.\n\"And whenever you stand praying, if\nyou have anything against anyone,\nforgive him, that your Father in heaven\nmay also forgive you your trespasses.\nBut if you do not forgive, neither will\nyour Father in heaven forgive your\ntrespasses.\"\nThen they came again to Jerusalem.\nAnd as He was walking in the temple,\nthe chief priests, the scribes, and the\nelders came to Him.\nAnd they said to Him, \"By what\nauthority are You doing these things?\nAnd who gave You this authority to do\nthese things?\"\nhim in the head, and sent him away\nshamefully treated.\nBut Jesus answered and said to them,\n\"I also will ask you one question; then\nanswer Me, and I will tell you by what\nauthority I do these things:\nAnd again he sent another, and him\nthey killed; and many others, beating\nsome and killing some.\nThe baptism of John--was it from\nheaven or from men? Answer Me.\"\nTherefore still having one son, his\nbeloved, he also sent him to them last,\nsaying, \"They will respect my son.'\nAnd they reasoned among themselves,\nsaying, \"If we say, \"From heaven,' He\nwill say, \"Why then did you not believe\nhim?'\nBut those vinedressers said among\nthemselves, \"This is the heir. Come, let\nus kill him, and the inheritance will be\nours.'\nBut if we say, \"From men\"'--they\nfeared the people, for all counted John\nto have been a prophet indeed.\nSo they took him and killed him and\ncast him out of the vineyard.\nSo they answered and said to Jesus,\n\"We do not know.\" And Jesus answered\nand said to them, \"Neither will I tell you\nby what authority I do these things.\"\n\"Therefore what will the owner of the\nvineyard do? He will come and destroy\nthe vinedressers, and give the vineyard\nto others.\n12Then He began to speak to them\nin parables: \"A man planted a vineyard\nand set a hedge around it, dug a place\nfor the wine vat and built a tower. And\nhe leased it to vinedressers and went\ninto a far country.\nNow at vintage-time he sent a servant\nto the vinedressers, that he might\nreceive some of the fruit of the vineyard\nfrom the vinedressers.\nAnd they took him and beat him and\nsent him away empty-handed.\nAgain he sent them another servant,\nand at him they threw stones, wounded\nHave you not even read this Scripture:\n\"The stone which the builders rejected\nHas become the chief cornerstone.\nThis was the LORD's doing, And it is\nmarvelous in our eyes'?\"\nAnd they sought to lay hands on Him,\nbut feared the multitude, for they knew\nHe had spoken the parable against\nthem. So they left Him and went away.\nThen they sent to Him some of the\nPharisees and the Herodians, to catch\nHim in His words.\nWhen they had come, they said to Him,\n\"Teacher, we know that You are true,\nand care about no one; for You do not\nregard the person of men, but teach the\nway of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay\ntaxes to Caesar, or not?\nJesus answered and said to them,\n\"Are you not therefore mistaken,\nbecause you do not know the Scriptures\nnor the power of God?\nShall we pay, or shall we not pay?\" But\nHe, knowing their hypocrisy, said to\nthem, \"Why do you test Me? Bring Me a\ndenarius that I may see it.\"\nFor when they rise from the dead, they\nneither marry nor are given in marriage,\nbut are like angels in heaven.\nSo they brought it. And He said to\nthem, \"Whose image and inscription is\nthis?\" They said to Him, \"Caesar's.\"\nAnd Jesus answered and said to them,\n\"Render to Caesar the things that are\nCaesar's, and to God the things that are\nGod's.\" And they marveled at Him.\nThen some Sadducees, who say there\nis no resurrection, came to Him; and\nthey asked Him, saying:\n\"Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a\nman's brother dies, and leaves his wife\nbehind, and leaves no children, his\nbrother should take his wife and raise up\noffspring for his brother.\nNow there were seven brothers. The\nfirst took a wife; and dying, he left no\noffspring.\nAnd the second took her, and he died;\nnor did he leave any offspring. And the\nthird likewise.\nBut concerning the dead, that they rise,\nhave you not read in the book of Moses,\nin the burning bush passage, how God\nspoke to him, saying, \"I am the God of\nAbraham, the God of Isaac, and the\nGod of Jacob'?\nHe is not the God of the dead, but the\nGod of the living. You are therefore\ngreatly mistaken.\"\nThen one of the scribes came, and\nhaving heard them reasoning together,\nperceiving that He had answered them\nwell, asked Him, \"Which is the first\ncommandment of all?\"\nJesus answered him, \"The first of all\nthe commandments is: \"Hear, O Israel,\nthe LORD our God, the LORD is one.\nAnd you shall love the LORD your God\nwith all your heart, with all your soul,\nwith all your mind, and with all your\nstrength.' This is the first commandment.\nSo the seven had her and left no\noffspring. Last of all the woman died\nalso.\nAnd the second, like it, is this: \"You\nshall love your neighbor as yourself.'\nThere is no other commandment greater\nthan these.\"\nTherefore, in the resurrection, when\nthey rise, whose wife will she be? For all\nseven had her as wife.\"\nSo the scribe said to Him, \"Well said,\nTeacher. You have spoken the truth, for\nthere is one God, and there is no other\nbut He.\nAnd to love Him with all the heart, with\nall the understanding, with all the soul,\nand with all the strength, and to love\none's neighbor as oneself, is more than\nall the whole burnt offerings and\nsacrifices.\"\nNow when Jesus saw that he\nanswered wisely, He said to him, \"You\nare not far from the kingdom of God.\"\nBut after that no one dared question\nHim.\nThen Jesus answered and said, while\nHe taught in the temple, \"How is it that\nthe scribes say that the Christ is the Son\nof David?\nFor David himself said by the Holy\nSpirit: \"The LORD said to my Lord, \"Sit\nat My right hand, Till I make Your\nenemies Your footstool.\"'\nTherefore David himself calls Him\n\"Lord'; how is He then his Son?\" And the\ncommon people heard Him gladly.\nThen He said to them in His teaching,\n\"Beware of the scribes, who desire to go\naround in long robes, love greetings in\nthe marketplaces,\nthe best seats in the synagogues, and\nthe best places at feasts,\nwho devour widows' houses, and for a\npretense make long prayers. These will\nreceive greater condemnation.\"\nNow Jesus sat opposite the treasury\nand saw how the people put money into\nthe treasury. And many who were rich\nput in much.\nThen one poor widow came and threw\nin two mites, which make a quadrans.\nSo He called His disciples to Himself\nand said to them, \"Assuredly, I say to\nyou that this poor widow has put in more\nthan all those who have given to the\ntreasury;\nfor they all put in out of their\nabundance, but she out of her poverty\nput in all that she had, her whole\nlivelihood.\"\n13Then as He went out of the temple,\none of His disciples said to Him,\n\"Teacher, see what manner of stones\nand what buildings are here!\"\nAnd Jesus answered and said to him,\n\"Do you see these great buildings? Not\none stone shall be left upon another,\nthat shall not be thrown down.\"\nNow as He sat on the Mount of Olives\nopposite the temple, Peter, James, John,\nand Andrew asked Him privately,\n\"Tell us, when will these things be? And\nwhat will be the sign when all these\nthings will be fulfilled?\"\nAnd Jesus, answering them, began to\nsay: \"Take heed that no one deceives\nyou.\nFor many will come in My name, saying,\n\"I am He,' and will deceive many.\nthe reader understand), \"then let those\nwho are in Judea flee to the mountains.\nBut when you hear of wars and rumors\nof wars, do not be troubled; for such\nthings must happen, but the end is not\nyet.\nLet him who is on the housetop not go\ndown into the house, nor enter to take\nanything out of his house.\nFor nation will rise against nation, and\nkingdom against kingdom. And there will\nbe earthquakes in various places, and\nthere will be famines and troubles.\nThese are the beginnings of sorrows.\n\"But watch out for yourselves, for they\nwill deliver you up to councils, and you\nwill be beaten in the synagogues. You\nwill be brought before rulers and kings\nfor My sake, for a testimony to them.\nAnd the gospel must first be preached\nto all the nations.\nAnd let him who is in the field not go\nback to get his clothes.\nBut woe to those who are pregnant\nand to those who are nursing babies in\nthose days!\nAnd pray that your flight may not be in\nwinter.\nFor in those days there will be\ntribulation, such as has not been since\nthe beginning of the creation which God\ncreated until this time, nor ever shall be.\nBut when they arrest you and deliver\nyou up, do not worry beforehand, or\npremeditate what you will speak. But\nwhatever is given you in that hour,\nspeak that; for it is not you who speak,\nbut the Holy Spirit.\nNow brother will betray brother to\ndeath, and a father his child; and\nchildren will rise up against parents and\ncause them to be put to death.\nAnd you will be hated by all for My\nname's sake.

She has\ncome beforehand to anoint My body for\nburial.\nIn the evening He came with the\ntwelve.\nAssuredly, I say to you, wherever this\ngospel is preached in the whole world,\nwhat this woman has done will also be\ntold as a memorial to her.\"\nThen Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve,\nwent to the chief priests to betray Him to\nthem.\nAnd when they heard it, they were\nglad, and promised to give him money.\nSo he sought how he might conveniently\nbetray Him.\nNow on the first day of Unleavened\nBread, when they killed the Passover\nlamb, His disciples said to Him, \"Where\ndo You want us to go and prepare, that\nYou may eat the Passover?\"\nAnd He sent out two of His disciples\nand said to them, \"Go into the city, and\na man will meet you carrying a pitcher of\nwater; follow him.\nNow as they sat and ate, Jesus said,\n\"Assuredly, I say to you, one of you who\neats with Me will betray Me.\"\nAnd they began to be sorrowful, and to\nsay to Him one by one, \"Is it I?\" And\nanother said, \"Is it I?\"\nHe answered and said to them, \"It is\none of the twelve, who dips with Me in\nthe dish.\nThe Son of Man indeed goes just as it\nis written of Him, but woe to that man by\nwhom the Son of Man is betrayed! It\nwould have been good for that man if he\nhad never been born.\"\nAnd as they were eating, Jesus took\nbread, blessed and broke it, and gave it\nto them and said, \"Take, eat; this is My\nbody.\"\nThen He took the cup, and when He\nhad given thanks He gave it to them,\nand they all drank from it.\nWherever he goes in, say to the\nmaster of the house, \"The Teacher says,\n\"Where is the guest room in which I may\neat the Passover with My disciples?\"'\nAnd He said to them, \"This is My blood\nof the new covenant, which is shed for\nmany.\nThen he will show you a large upper\nroom, furnished and prepared; there\nmake ready for us.\"\nSo His disciples went out, and came\ninto the city, and found it just as He had\nsaid to them; and they prepared the\nPassover.\nAssuredly, I say to you, I will no longer\ndrink of the fruit of the vine until that day\nwhen I drink it new in the kingdom of\nGod.\"\nAnd when they had sung a hymn, they\nwent out to the Mount of Olives.\nThen Jesus said to them, \"All of you\nwill be made to stumble because of Me\nthis night, for it is written: \"I will strike the\nShepherd, And the sheep will be\nscattered.'\nThen He came and found them\nsleeping, and said to Peter, \"Simon, are\nyou sleeping? Could you not watch one\nhour?\n\"But after I have been raised, I will go\nbefore you to Galilee.\"\nWatch and pray, lest you enter into\ntemptation. The spirit indeed is willing,\nbut the flesh is weak.\"\nPeter said to Him, \"Even if all are\nmade to stumble, yet I will not be.\"\nAgain He went away and prayed, and\nspoke the same words.\nJesus said to him, \"Assuredly, I say to\nyou that today, even this night, before\nthe rooster crows twice, you will deny\nMe three times.\"\nAnd when He returned, He found them\nasleep again, for their eyes were heavy;\nand they did not know what to answer\nHim.\nBut he spoke more vehemently, \"If I\nhave to die with You, I will not deny\nYou!\" And they all said likewise.\nThen they came to a place which was\nnamed Gethsemane; and He said to His\ndisciples, \"Sit here while I pray.\"\nThen He came the third time and said\nto them, \"Are you still sleeping and\nresting? It is enough! The hour has\ncome; behold, the Son of Man is being\nbetrayed into the hands of sinners.\nRise, let us be going. See, My betrayer\nis at hand.\"\nAnd He took Peter, James, and John\nwith Him, and He began to be troubled\nand deeply distressed.\nThen He said to them, \"My soul is\nexceedingly sorrowful, even to death.\nStay here and watch.\"\nAnd immediately, while He was still\nspeaking, Judas, one of the twelve, with\na great multitude with swords and clubs,\ncame from the chief priests and the\nscribes and the elders.\nHe went a little farther, and fell on the\nground, and prayed that if it were\npossible, the hour might pass from Him.\nNow His betrayer had given them a\nsignal, saying, \"Whomever I kiss, He is\nthe One; seize Him and lead Him away\nsafely.\"\nAnd He said, \"Abba, Father, all things\nare possible for You. Take this cup\naway from Me; nevertheless, not what I\nwill, but what You will.\"\nAs soon as he had come, immediately\nhe went up to Him and said to Him,\n\"Rabbi, Rabbi!\" and kissed Him.\nThen they laid their hands on Him and\ntook Him.\nAnd one of those who stood by drew\nhis sword and struck the servant of the\nhigh priest, and cut off his ear.\n\"We heard Him say, \"I will destroy this\ntemple made with hands, and within\nthree days I will build another made\nwithout hands.\"'\nThen Jesus answered and said to\nthem, \"Have you come out, as against a\nrobber, with swords and clubs to take\nMe?\nBut not even then did their testimony\nagree.\nI was daily with you in the temple\nteaching, and you did not seize Me. But\nthe Scriptures must be fulfilled.\"\nAnd the high priest stood up in the\nmidst and asked Jesus, saying, \"Do You\nanswer nothing? What is it these men\ntestify against You?\"\nThen they all forsook Him and fled.\nNow a certain young man followed\nHim, having a linen cloth thrown around\nhis naked body. And the young men laid\nhold of him,\nBut He kept silent and answered\nnothing. Again the high priest asked Him,\nsaying to Him, \"Are You the Christ, the\nSon of the Blessed?\"\nand he left the linen cloth and fled from\nthem naked.\nJesus said, \"I am. And you will see the\nSon of Man sitting at the right hand of\nthe Power, and coming with the clouds\nof heaven.\"\nAnd they led Jesus away to the high\npriest; and with him were assembled all\nthe chief priests, the elders, and the\nscribes.\nBut Peter followed Him at a distance,\nright into the courtyard of the high priest.\nAnd he sat with the servants and\nwarmed himself at the fire.\nNow the chief priests and all the\ncouncil sought testimony against Jesus\nto put Him to death, but found none.\nThen the high priest tore his clothes\nand said, \"What further need do we\nhave of witnesses?\nYou have heard the blasphemy! What\ndo you think?\" And they all condemned\nHim to be deserving of death.\nThen some began to spit on Him, and\nto blindfold Him, and to beat Him, and to\nsay to Him, \"Prophesy!\" And the officers\nstruck Him with the palms of their hands.\nFor many bore false witness against\nHim, but their testimonies did not agree.\nNow as Peter was below in the\ncourtyard, one of the servant girls of the\nhigh priest came.\nThen some rose up and bore false\nwitness against Him, saying,\nAnd when she saw Peter warming\nhimself, she looked at him and said,\n\"You also were with Jesus of Nazareth.\"\nBut he denied it, saying, \"I neither\nknow nor understand what you are\nsaying.\" And he went out on the porch,\nand a rooster crowed.\nAnd the servant girl saw him again,\nand began to say to those who stood by,\n\"This is one of them.\"\nBut he denied it again. And a little later\nthose who stood by said to Peter again,\n\"Surely you are one of them; for you are\na Galilean, and your speech shows it.\"\nThen he began to curse and swear, \"I\ndo not know this Man of whom you\nspeak!\"\nA second time the rooster crowed.\nThen Peter called to mind the word that\nJesus had said to him, \"Before the\nrooster crows twice, you will deny Me\nthree times.\" And when he thought\nabout it, he wept.\n15Immediately, in the morning, the\nBut Jesus still answered nothing, so\nthat Pilate marveled.\nNow at the feast he was accustomed to\nreleasing one prisoner to them,\nwhomever they requested.\nAnd there was one named Barabbas,\nwho was chained with his fellow rebels;\nthey had committed murder in the\nrebellion.\nThen the multitude, crying aloud, began\nto ask him to do just as he had always\ndone for them.\nBut Pilate answered them, saying, \"Do\nyou want me to release to you the King\nof the Jews?\"\nFor he knew that the chief priests had\nhanded Him over because of envy.\nBut the chief priests stirred up the\ncrowd, so that he should rather release\nBarabbas to them.\nchief priests held a consultation with the\nelders and scribes and the whole\ncouncil; and they bound Jesus, led Him\naway, and delivered Him to Pilate.\nPilate answered and said to them\nagain, \"What then do you want me to do\nwith Him whom you call the King of the\nJews?\"\nThen Pilate asked Him, \"Are You the\nKing of the Jews?\" He answered and\nsaid to him, \"It is as you say.\"\nAnd the chief priests accused Him of\nmany things, but He answered nothing.\nSo they cried out again, \"Crucify Him!\"\nThen Pilate said to them, \"Why, what\nevil has He done?\" But they cried out all\nthe more, \"Crucify Him!\"\nThen Pilate asked Him again, saying,\n\"Do You answer nothing? See how\nmany things they testify against You!\"\nSo Pilate, wanting to gratify the crowd,\nreleased Barabbas to them; and he\ndelivered Jesus, after he had scourged\nHim, to be crucified.\nThen the soldiers led Him away into\nthe hall called Praetorium, and they\ncalled together the whole garrison.\nAnd the inscription of His accusation\nwas written above: THE KING OF THE\nJEWS.\nAnd they clothed Him with purple; and\nthey twisted a crown of thorns, put it on\nHis head,\nWith Him they also crucified two\nrobbers, one on His right and the other\non His left.\nand began to salute Him, \"Hail, King of\nthe Jews!\"\nSo the Scripture was fulfilled which\nsays, \"And He was numbered with the\ntransgressors.\"\nThen they struck Him on the head with\na reed and spat on Him; and bowing the\nknee, they worshiped Him.\nAnd when they had mocked Him, they\ntook the purple off Him, put His own\nclothes on Him, and led Him out to\ncrucify Him.\nThen they compelled a certain man,\nSimon a Cyrenian, the father of\nAlexander and Rufus, as he was coming\nout of the country and passing by, to\nbear His cross.\nAnd those who passed by blasphemed\nHim, wagging their heads and saying,\n\"Aha! You who destroy the temple and\nbuild it in three days,\nsave Yourself, and come down from\nthe cross!\"\nLikewise the chief priests also,\nmocking among themselves with the\nscribes, said, \"He saved others; Himself\nHe cannot save.\nAnd they brought Him to the place\nGolgotha, which is translated, Place of a\nSkull.\nLet the Christ, the King of Israel,\ndescend now from the cross, that we\nmay see and believe.\" Even those who\nwere crucified with Him reviled Him.\nThen they gave Him wine mingled with\nmyrrh to drink, but He did not take it.\nNow when the sixth hour had come,\nthere was darkness over the whole land\nuntil the ninth hour.\nAnd when they crucified Him, they\ndivided His garments, casting lots for\nthem to determine what every man\nshould take.\nNow it was the third hour, and they\ncrucified Him.\nAnd at the ninth hour Jesus cried out\nwith a loud voice, saying, \"Eloi, Eloi,\nlama sabachthani?\" which is translated,\n\"My God, My God, why have You\nforsaken Me?\"\nSome of those who stood by, when\nthey heard that, said, \"Look, He is\ncalling for Elijah!\"\nThen someone ran and filled a sponge\nfull of sour wine, put it on a reed, and\noffered it to Him to drink, saying, \"Let\nHim alone; let us see if Elijah will come\nto take Him down.\"\nAnd Jesus cried out with a loud voice,\nand breathed His last.\nSo when he found out from the\ncenturion, he granted the body to\nJoseph.\nThen he bought fine linen, took Him\ndown, and wrapped Him in the linen.\nAnd he laid Him in a tomb which had\nbeen hewn out of the rock, and rolled a\nstone against the door of the tomb.\nThen the veil of the temple was torn in\ntwo from top to bottom.\nSo when the centurion, who stood\nopposite Him, saw that He cried out like\nthis and breathed His last, he said,\n\"Truly this Man was the Son of God!\"\nThere were also women looking on\nfrom afar, among whom were Mary\nMagdalene, Mary the mother of James\nthe Less and of Joses, and Salome,\nwho also followed Him and ministered\nto Him when He was in Galilee, and\nmany other women who came up with\nHim to Jerusalem.\nNow when evening had come,\nbecause it was the Preparation Day,\nthat is, the day before the Sabbath,\nJoseph of Arimathea, a prominent\ncouncil member, who was himself\nwaiting for the kingdom of God, coming\nand taking courage, went in to Pilate\nand asked for the body of Jesus.\nPilate marveled that He was already\ndead; and summoning the centurion, he\nasked him if He had been dead for\nsome time.\nAnd Mary Magdalene and Mary the\nmother of Joses observed where He\nwas laid.\n16Now when the Sabbath was past,\nMary Magdalene, Mary the mother of\nJames, and Salome bought spices, that\nthey might come and anoint Him.\nVery early in the morning, on the first\nday of the week, they came to the tomb\nwhen the sun had risen.\nAnd they said among themselves,\n\"Who will roll away the stone from the\ndoor of the tomb for us?\"\nBut when they looked up, they saw that\nthe stone had been rolled away--for it\nwas very large.\nAnd entering the tomb, they saw a\nyoung man clothed in a long white robe\nsitting on the right side; and they were\nalarmed.\nBut he said to them, \"Do not be\nalarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth,\nwho was crucified. He is risen! He is not\nhere. See the place where they laid Him.\nBut go, tell His disciples--and Peter-that He is going before you into Galilee;\nthere you will see Him, as He said to\nyou.\"\ntheir unbelief and hardness of heart,\nbecause they did not believe those who\nhad seen Him after He had risen.\nSo they went out quickly and fled from\nthe tomb, for they trembled and were\namazed. And they said nothing to\nanyone, for they were afraid.\nNow when He rose early on the first\nday of the week, He appeared first to\nMary Magdalene, out of whom He had\ncast seven demons.\nShe went and told those who had\nbeen with Him, as they mourned and\nwept.\nAnd when they heard that He was\nalive and had been seen by her, they\ndid not believe.\nAnd He said to them, \"Go into all the\nworld and preach the gospel to every\ncreature.\nHe who believes and is baptized will\nbe saved; but he who does not believe\nwill be condemned.\nAnd these signs will follow those who\nbelieve: In My name they will cast out\ndemons; they will speak with new\ntongues;\nthey will take up serpents; and if they\ndrink anything deadly, it will by no\nmeans hurt them; they will lay hands on\nthe sick, and they will recover.\"\nAfter that, He appeared in another\nform to two of them as they walked and\nwent into the country.\nSo then, after the Lord had spoken to\nthem, He was received up into heaven,\nand sat down at the right hand of God.\nAnd they went and told it to the rest,\nbut they did not believe them either.\nLater He appeared to the eleven as\nthey sat at the table; and He rebuked\nAnd they went out and preached\neverywhere, the Lord working with them\nand confirming the word through the\naccompanying signs. Amen.\nLuke\n1Inasmuch as many have taken in\nhand to set in order a narrative of those\nthings which have been fulfilled among\nus,\njust as those who from the beginning\nwere eyewitnesses and ministers of the\nword delivered them to us,\nit seemed good to me also, having had\nperfect understanding of all things from\nthe very first, to write to you an orderly\naccount, most excellent Theophilus,\nthat you may know the certainty of\nthose things in which you were\ninstructed.\nThere was in the days of Herod, the\nking of Judea, a certain priest named\nZacharias, of the division of Abijah. His\nwife was of the daughters of Aaron, and\nher name was Elizabeth.\nAnd they were both righteous before\nGod, walking in all the commandments\nand ordinances of the Lord blameless.\nBut they had no child, because\nElizabeth was barren, and they were\nboth well advanced in years.\nSo it was, that while he was serving as\npriest before God in the order of his\ndivision,\naccording to the custom of the\npriesthood, his lot fell to burn incense\nwhen he went into the temple of the\nLord.\nAnd the whole multitude of the people\nwas praying outside at the hour of\nincense.\nThen an angel of the Lord appeared to\nhim, standing on the right side of the\naltar of incense.\nAnd when Zacharias saw him, he was\ntroubled, and fear fell upon him.\nBut the angel said to him, \"Do not be\nafraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is\nheard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear\nyou a son, and you shall call his name\nJohn.\nAnd you will have joy and gladness,\nand many will rejoice at his birth.\nFor he will be great in the sight of the\nLord, and shall drink neither wine nor\nstrong drink. He will also be filled with\nthe Holy Spirit, even from his mother's\nwomb.\nAnd he will turn many of the children of\nIsrael to the Lord their God.\nHe will also go before Him in the spirit\nand power of Elijah, \"to turn the hearts\nof the fathers to the children,' and the\ndisobedient to the wisdom of the just, to\nmake ready a people prepared for the\nLord.\"\nAnd Zacharias said to the angel, \"How\nshall I know this? For I am an old man,\nand my wife is well advanced in years.\"\nto a virgin betrothed to a man whose\nname was Joseph, of the house of\nDavid. The virgin's name was Mary.\nAnd the angel answered and said to\nhim, \"I am Gabriel, who stands in the\npresence of God, and was sent to speak\nto you and bring you these glad tidings.\nAnd having come in, the angel said to\nher, \"Rejoice, highly favored one, the\nLord is with you; blessed are you among\nwomen!\"\nBut behold, you will be mute and not\nable to speak until the day these things\ntake place, because you did not believe\nmy words which will be fulfilled in their\nown time.\"\nAnd the people waited for Zacharias,\nand marveled that he lingered so long in\nthe temple.\nBut when he came out, he could not\nspeak to them; and they perceived that\nhe had seen a vision in the temple, for\nhe beckoned to them and remained\nspeechless.\nSo it was, as soon as the days of his\nservice were completed, that he\ndeparted to his own house.\nBut when she saw him, she was\ntroubled at his saying, and considered\nwhat manner of greeting this was.\nThen the angel said to her, \"Do not be\nafraid, Mary, for you have found favor\nwith God.\nAnd behold, you will conceive in your\nwomb and bring forth a Son, and shall\ncall His name JESUS.\nHe will be great, and will be called the\nSon of the Highest; and the Lord God\nwill give Him the throne of His father\nDavid.\nAnd He will reign over the house of\nJacob forever, and of His kingdom there\nwill be no end.\"\nNow after those days his wife\nElizabeth conceived; and she hid herself\nfive months, saying,\nThen Mary said to the angel, \"How can\nthis be, since I do not know a man?\"\n\"Thus the Lord has dealt with me, in\nthe days when He looked on me, to take\naway my reproach among people.\"\nNow in the sixth month the angel\nGabriel was sent by God to a city of\nGalilee named Nazareth,\nAnd the angel answered and said to\nher, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you,\nand the power of the Highest will\novershadow you; therefore, also, that\nHoly One who is to be born will be\ncalled the Son of God.\nNow indeed, Elizabeth your relative\nhas also conceived a son in her old age;\nand this is now the sixth month for her\nwho was called barren.\nAnd my spirit has rejoiced in God my\nSavior.\nFor with\nimpossible.\"\nGod\nnothing\nwill\nbe\nFor He has regarded the lowly state of\nHis maidservant; For behold, henceforth\nall generations will call me blessed.\nThen Mary said, \"Behold the\nmaidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me\naccording to your word.\" And the angel\ndeparted from her.\nFor He who is mighty has done great\nthings for me, And holy is His name.\nNow Mary arose in those days and\nwent into the hill country with haste, to a\ncity of Judah,\nand entered the house of Zacharias\nand greeted Elizabeth.\nAnd His mercy is on those who fear\nHim From generation to generation.\nHe has shown strength with His arm;\nHe has scattered the proud in the\nimagination of their hearts.\nAnd it happened, when Elizabeth\nheard the greeting of Mary, that the\nbabe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth\nwas filled with the Holy Spirit.\nThen she spoke out with a loud voice\nand said, \"Blessed are you among\nwomen, and blessed is the fruit of your\nwomb!\nHe has put down the mighty from their\nthrones, And exalted the lowly.\nHe has filled the hungry with good\nthings, And the rich He has sent away\nempty.\nHe has helped His servant Israel, In\nremembrance of His mercy,\nBut why is this granted to me, that the\nmother of my Lord should come to me?\nAs He spoke to our fathers, To\nAbraham and to his seed forever.\"\nFor indeed, as soon as the voice of\nyour greeting sounded in my ears, the\nbabe leaped in my womb for joy.\nBlessed is she who believed, for there\nwill be a fulfillment of those things which\nwere told her from the Lord.\"\nAnd Mary said: \"My soul magnifies the\nLord,\nAnd Mary remained with her about\nthree months, and returned to her house.\nNow Elizabeth's full time came for her\nto be delivered, and she brought forth a\nson.\nWhen her neighbors and relatives\nheard how the Lord had shown great\nmercy to her, they rejoiced with her.\nSo it was, on the eighth day, that they\ncame to circumcise the child; and they\nwould have called him by the name of\nhis father, Zacharias.\nAs He spoke by the mouth of His holy\nprophets, Who have been since the\nworld began,\nHis mother answered and said, \"No;\nhe shall be called John.\"\nThat we should be saved from our\nenemies And from the hand of all who\nhate us,\nBut they said to her, \"There is no one\namong your relatives who is called by\nthis name.\"\nTo perform the mercy promised to our\nfathers And to remember His holy\ncovenant,\nSo they made signs to his father--what\nhe would have him called.\nThe oath which He swore to our father\nAbraham:\nAnd he asked for a writing tablet, and\nwrote, saying, \"His name is John.\" So\nthey all marveled.\nTo grant us that we, Being delivered\nfrom the hand of our enemies, Might\nserve Him without fear,\nImmediately his mouth was opened\nand his tongue loosed, and he spoke,\npraising God.\nIn holiness and righteousness before\nHim all the days of our life.\nThen fear came on all who dwelt\naround them; and all these sayings were\ndiscussed throughout all the hill country\nof Judea.\n\"And you, child, will be called the\nprophet of the Highest; For you will go\nbefore the face of the Lord to prepare\nHis ways,\nAnd all those who heard them kept\nthem in their hearts, saying, \"What kind\nof child will this be?\" And the hand of the\nLord was with him.\nNow his father Zacharias was filled\nwith the Holy Spirit, and prophesied,\nsaying:\n\"Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, For\nHe has visited and redeemed His\npeople,\nAnd has raised up a horn of salvation\nfor us In the house of His servant David,\nTo give knowledge of salvation to His\npeople By the remission of their sins,\nThrough the tender mercy of our God,\nWith which the Dayspring from on high\nhas visited us;\nTo give light to those who sit in\ndarkness and the shadow of death, To\nguide our feet into the way of peace.\"\nSo the child grew and became strong\nin spirit, and was in the deserts till the\nday of his manifestation to Israel.\n2And it came to pass in those days\nthat a decree went out from Caesar\nAugustus that all the world should be\nregistered.\nThis census first took place while\nQuirinius was governing Syria.\nSo all went to be registered, everyone\nto his own city.\nJoseph also went up from Galilee, out\nof the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the\ncity of David, which is called Bethlehem,\nbecause he was of the house and\nlineage of David,\nto be registered with Mary,\nbetrothed wife, who was with child.\nhis\nSo it was, that while they were there,\nthe days were completed for her to be\ndelivered.\nAnd she brought forth her firstborn Son,\nand wrapped Him in swaddling cloths,\nand laid Him in a manger, because\nthere was no room for them in the inn.\nNow there were in the same country\nshepherds living out in the fields,\nkeeping watch over their flock by night.\nAnd behold, an angel of the Lord stood\nbefore them, and the glory of the Lord\nshone around them, and they were\ngreatly afraid.\nThen the angel said to them, \"Do not\nbe afraid, for behold, I bring you good\ntidings of great joy which will be to all\npeople.\nFor there is born to you this day in the\ncity of David a Savior, who is Christ the\nLord.\nAnd this will be the sign to you: You\nwill find a Babe wrapped in swaddling\ncloths, lying in a manger.\"\nAnd suddenly there was with the angel\na multitude of the heavenly host praising\nGod and saying:\n\"Glory to God in the highest, And on\nearth peace, goodwill toward men!\"\nSo it was, when the angels had gone\naway from them into heaven, that the\nshepherds said to one another, \"Let us\nnow go to Bethlehem and see this thing\nthat has come to pass, which the Lord\nhas made known to us.\"\nAnd they came with haste and found\nMary and Joseph, and the Babe lying in\na manger.\nNow when they had seen Him, they\nmade widely known the saying which\nwas told them concerning this Child.\nAnd all those who heard it marveled at\nthose things which were told them by\nthe shepherds.\nBut Mary kept all these things and\npondered them in her heart.\nThen\nthe\nshepherds\nreturned,\nglorifying and praising God for all the\nthings that they had heard and seen, as\nit was told them.\nAnd when eight days were completed\nfor the circumcision of the Child, His\nname was called JESUS, the name\ngiven by the angel before He was\nconceived in the womb.\nWhich You have prepared before the\nface of all peoples,\nA light to bring revelation to the\nGentiles, And the glory of Your people\nIsrael.\"\nNow when the days of her purification\naccording to the law of Moses were\ncompleted, they brought Him to\nJerusalem to present Him to the Lord\nAnd Joseph and His mother marveled\nat those things which were spoken of\nHim.\n(as it is written in the law of the Lord,\n\"Every male who opens the womb shall\nbe called holy to the LORD\"),\nand to offer a sacrifice according to\nwhat is said in the law of the Lord, \"A\npair of turtledoves or two young\npigeons.\"\nAnd behold, there was a man in\nJerusalem whose name was Simeon,\nand this man was just and devout,\nwaiting for the Consolation of Israel, and\nthe Holy Spirit was upon him.\nAnd it had been revealed to him by the\nHoly Spirit that he would not see death\nbefore he had seen the Lord's Christ.\nSo he came by the Spirit into the\ntemple. And when the parents brought\nin the Child Jesus, to do for Him\naccording to the custom of the law,\nhe took Him up in his arms and\nblessed God and said:\nThen Simeon blessed them, and said\nto Mary His mother, \"Behold, this Child\nis destined for the fall and rising of many\nin Israel, and for a sign which will be\nspoken against\n(yes, a sword will pierce through your\nown soul also), that the thoughts of\nmany hearts may be revealed.\"\nNow there was one, Anna, a\nprophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of\nthe tribe of Asher. She was of a great\nage, and had lived with a husband\nseven years from her virginity;\nand this woman was a widow of about\neighty-four years, who did not depart\nfrom the temple, but served God with\nfastings and prayers night and day.\nAnd coming in that instant she gave\nthanks to the Lord, and spoke of Him to\nall those who looked for redemption in\nJerusalem.\n\"Lord, now You are letting Your\nservant depart in peace, According to\nYour word;\nFor my eyes have seen Your salvation\nSo when they had performed all things\naccording to the law of the Lord, they\nreturned to Galilee, to their own city,\nNazareth.\nAnd the Child grew and became\nstrong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and\nthe grace of God was upon Him.\nBut they did not understand the\nstatement which He spoke to them.\nHis parents went to Jerusalem every\nyear at the Feast of the Passover.\nThen He went down with them and\ncame to Nazareth, and was subject to\nthem, but His mother kept all these\nthings in her heart.\nAnd when He was twelve years old,\nthey went up to Jerusalem according to\nthe custom of the feast.\nWhen they had finished the days, as\nthey returned, the Boy Jesus lingered\nbehind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and\nHis mother did not know it;\nbut supposing Him to have been in the\ncompany, they went a day's journey,\nand sought Him among their relatives\nand acquaintances.\nSo when they did not find Him, they\nreturned to Jerusalem, seeking Him.\nAnd Jesus increased in wisdom and\nstature, and in favor with God and men.\n3Now in the fifteenth year of the reign\nof Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being\ngovernor of Judea, Herod being tetrarch\nof Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of\nIturea and the region of Trachonitis, and\nLysanias tetrarch of Abilene,\nwhile Annas and Caiaphas were high\npriests, the word of God came to John\nthe son of Zacharias in the wilderness.\nNow so it was that after three days\nthey found Him in the temple, sitting in\nthe midst of the teachers, both listening\nto them and asking them questions.\nAnd he went into all the region around\nthe Jordan, preaching a baptism of\nrepentance for the remission of sins,\nAnd all who heard Him were\nastonished at His understanding and\nanswers.\nas it is written in the book of the words\nof Isaiah the prophet, saying: \"The voice\nof one crying in the wilderness: \"Prepare\nthe way of the LORD; Make His paths\nstraight.\nSo when they saw Him, they were\namazed; and His mother said to Him,\n\"Son, why have You done this to us?\nLook, Your father and I have sought You\nanxiously.\"\nEvery valley shall be filled And every\nmountain and hill brought low; The\ncrooked places shall be made straight\nAnd the rough ways smooth;\nAnd He said to them, \"Why did you\nseek Me? Did you not know that I must\nbe about My Father's business?\"\nAnd all flesh shall see the salvation of\nGod.\"'\nThen he said to the multitudes that\ncame out to be baptized by him, \"Brood\nof vipers! Who warned you to flee from\nthe wrath to come?\nam not worthy to loose. He will baptize\nyou with the Holy Spirit and fire.\nTherefore bear fruits worthy of\nrepentance, and do not begin to say to\nyourselves, \"We have Abraham as our\nfather.' For I say to you that God is able\nto raise up children to Abraham from\nthese stones.\nHis winnowing fan is in His hand, and\nHe will thoroughly clean out His\nthreshing floor, and gather the wheat\ninto His barn; but the chaff He will burn\nwith unquenchable fire.\"\nAnd even now the ax is laid to the root\nof the trees. Therefore every tree which\ndoes not bear good fruit is cut down and\nthrown into the fire.\"\nSo the people asked him, saying,\n\"What shall we do then?\"\nAnd with many other exhortations he\npreached to the people.\nBut Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked\nby him concerning Herodias, his brother\nPhilip's wife, and for all the evils which\nHerod had done,\nHe answered and said to them, \"He\nwho has two tunics, let him give to him\nwho has none; and he who has food, let\nhim do likewise.\"\nThen tax collectors also came to be\nbaptized, and said to him, \"Teacher,\nwhat shall we do?\"\nAnd he said to them, \"Collect no more\nthan what is appointed for you.\"\nalso added this, above all, that he shut\nJohn up in prison.\nWhen all the people were baptized, it\ncame to pass that Jesus also was\nbaptized; and while He prayed, the\nheaven was opened.\nAnd the Holy Spirit descended in\nbodily form like a dove upon Him, and a\nvoice came from heaven which said,\n\"You are My beloved Son; in You I am\nwell pleased.\"\nLikewise the soldiers asked him,\nsaying, \"And what shall we do?\" So he\nsaid to them, \"Do not intimidate anyone\nor accuse falsely, and be content with\nyour wages.\"\nNow Jesus Himself began His ministry\nat about thirty years of age, being (as\nwas supposed) the son of Joseph, the\nson of Heli,\nNow as the people were in expectation,\nand all reasoned in their hearts about\nJohn, whether he was the Christ or not,\nthe son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the\nson of Melchi, the son of Janna, the son\nof Joseph,\nJohn answered, saying to all, \"I indeed\nbaptize you with water; but One mightier\nthan I is coming, whose sandal strap I\nthe son of Mattathiah, the son of Amos,\nthe son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the\nson of Naggai,\nthe son of Maath, the son of\nMattathiah, the son of Semei, the son of\nJoseph, the son of Judah,\nthe son of Methuselah, the son of\nEnoch, the son of Jared, the son of\nMahalalel, the son of Cainan,\nthe son of Joannas, the son of Rhesa,\nthe son of Zerubbabel, the son of\nShealtiel, the son of Neri,\nthe son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the\nson of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the\nson of Er,\nthe son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the\nson of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son\nof Levi,\nthe son of Simeon, the son of Judah,\nthe son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the\nson of Eliakim,\nthe son of Melea, the son of Menan,\nthe son of Mattathah, the son of Nathan,\nthe son of David,\nthe son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the\nson of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son\nof Nahshon,\nthe son of Amminadab, the son of\nRam, the son of Hezron, the son of\nPerez, the son of Judah,\nthe son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the\nson of Abraham, the son of Terah, the\nson of Nahor,\nthe son of Serug, the son of Reu, the\nson of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of\nShelah,\nthe son of Cainan, the son of\nArphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of\nNoah, the son of Lamech,\nthe son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the\nson of Adam, the son of God.\n4Then Jesus, being filled with the Holy\nSpirit, returned from the Jordan and was\nled by the Spirit into the wilderness,\nbeing tempted for forty days by the\ndevil. And in those days He ate nothing,\nand afterward, when they had ended,\nHe was hungry.\nAnd the devil said to Him, \"If You are\nthe Son of God, command this stone to\nbecome bread.\"\nBut Jesus answered him, saying, \"It is\nwritten, \"Man shall not live by bread\nalone, but by every word of God.\"'\nThen the devil, taking Him up on a high\nmountain, showed Him all the kingdoms\nof the world in a moment of time.\nAnd the devil said to Him, \"All this\nauthority I will give You, and their glory;\nfor this has been delivered to me, and I\ngive it to whomever I wish.\nTherefore, if You will worship before me,\nall will be Yours.\"\nAnd Jesus answered and said to him,\n\"Get behind Me, Satan! For it is written,\n\"You shall worship the LORD your God,\nand Him only you shall serve.\"'\nThen he brought Him to Jerusalem, set\nHim on the pinnacle of the temple, and\nsaid to Him, \"If You are the Son of God,\nthrow Yourself down from here.\nliberty to the captives And recovery of\nsight to the blind, To set at liberty those\nwho are oppressed;\nFor it is written: \"He shall give His\nangels charge over you, To keep you,'\nTo proclaim the acceptable year of the\nLORD.\"\nand, \"In their hands they shall bear\nyou up, Lest you dash your foot against\na stone.\"'\nThen He closed the book, and gave it\nback to the attendant and sat down. And\nthe eyes of all who were in the\nsynagogue were fixed on Him.\nAnd Jesus answered and said to him,\n\"It has been said, \"You shall not tempt\nthe LORD your God.\"'\nAnd He began to say to them, \"Today\nthis Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.\"\nNow when the devil had ended every\ntemptation, he departed from Him until\nan opportune time.\nSo all bore witness to Him, and\nmarveled at the gracious words which\nproceeded out of His mouth. And they\nsaid, \"Is this not Joseph's son?\"\nThen Jesus returned in the power of\nthe Spirit to Galilee, and news of Him\nwent out through all the surrounding\nregion.\nHe said to them, \"You will surely say\nthis proverb to Me, \"Physician, heal\nyourself! Whatever we have heard done\nin Capernaum, do also here in Your\ncountry.\"'\nAnd He taught in their synagogues,\nbeing glorified by all.\nSo He came to Nazareth, where He\nhad been brought up. And as His\ncustom was, He went into the\nsynagogue on the Sabbath day, and\nstood up to read.\nAnd He was handed the book of the\nprophet Isaiah. And when He had\nopened the book, He found the place\nwhere it was written:\nThen He said, \"Assuredly, I say to you,\nno prophet is accepted in his own\ncountry.\nBut I tell you truly, many widows were\nin Israel in the days of Elijah, when the\nheaven was shut up three years and six\nmonths, and there was a great famine\nthroughout all the land;\nbut to none of them was Elijah sent\nexcept to Zarephath, in the region of\nSidon, to a woman who was a widow.\n\"The Spirit of the LORD is upon Me,\nBecause He has anointed Me To preach\nthe gospel to the poor; He has sent Me\nto heal the brokenhearted, To proclaim\nAnd many lepers were in Israel in the\ntime of Elisha the prophet, and none of\nthem was cleansed except Naaman the\nSyrian.\"\nAnd the report about Him went out into\nevery place in the surrounding region.\nSo all those in the synagogue, when\nthey heard these things, were filled with\nwrath,\nand rose up and thrust Him out of the\ncity; and they led Him to the brow of the\nhill on which their city was built, that\nthey might throw Him down over the cliff.\nNow He arose from the synagogue\nand entered Simon's house. But\nSimon's wife's mother was sick with a\nhigh fever, and they made request of\nHim concerning her.\nSo He stood over her and rebuked the\nfever, and it left her. And immediately\nshe arose and served them.\nThen passing through the midst of\nthem, He went His way.\nThen He went down to Capernaum, a\ncity of Galilee, and was teaching them\non the Sabbaths.\nWhen the sun was setting, all those\nwho had any that were sick with various\ndiseases brought them to Him; and He\nlaid His hands on every one of them and\nhealed them.\nAnd they were astonished at His\nteaching, for His word was with authority.\nNow in the synagogue there was a\nman who had a spirit of an unclean\ndemon. And he cried out with a loud\nvoice,\nsaying, \"Let us alone! What have we to\ndo with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did\nYou come to destroy us? I know who\nYou are--the Holy One of God!\"\nBut Jesus rebuked him, saying, \"Be\nquiet, and come out of him!\" And when\nthe demon had thrown him in their midst,\nit came out of him and did not hurt him.\nThen they were all amazed and spoke\namong themselves, saying, \"What a\nword this is! For with authority and\npower He commands the unclean spirits,\nand they come out.\"\nAnd demons also came out of many,\ncrying out and saying, \"You are the\nChrist, the Son of God!\" And He,\nrebuking them, did not allow them to\nspeak, for they knew that He was the\nChrist.\nNow when it was day, He departed\nand went into a deserted place. And the\ncrowd sought Him and came to Him,\nand tried to keep Him from leaving\nthem;\nbut He said to them, \"I must preach\nthe kingdom of God to the other cities\nalso, because for this purpose I have\nbeen sent.\"\nAnd He was preaching\nsynagogues of Galilee.\nin\nthe\n5So it was, as the multitude pressed\nabout Him to hear the word of God, that\nHe stood by the Lake of Gennesaret,\nand saw two boats standing by the\nlake; but the fishermen had gone from\nthem and were washing their nets.\nThen He got into one of the boats,\nwhich was Simon's, and asked him to\nput out a little from the land. And He sat\ndown and taught the multitudes from the\nboat.\nWhen He had stopped speaking, He\nsaid to Simon, \"Launch out into the deep\nand let down your nets for a catch.\"\nBut Simon answered and said to Him,\n\"Master, we have toiled all night and\ncaught nothing; nevertheless at Your\nword I will let down the net.\"\nAnd when they had done this, they\ncaught a great number of fish, and their\nnet was breaking.\nSo they signaled to their partners in the\nother boat to come and help them. And\nthey came and filled both the boats, so\nthat they began to sink.\nWhen Simon Peter saw it, he fell down\nat Jesus' knees, saying, \"Depart from\nme, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!\"\nFor he and all who were with him were\nastonished at the catch of fish which\nthey had taken;\nand so also were James and John, the\nsons of Zebedee, who were partners\nwith Simon. And Jesus said to Simon,\n\"Do not be afraid. From now on you will\ncatch men.\"\nSo when they had brought their boats\nto land, they forsook all and followed\nHim.\nAnd it happened when He was in a\ncertain city, that behold, a man who was\nfull of leprosy saw Jesus; and he fell on\nhis face and implored Him, saying, \"Lord,\nif You are willing, You can make me\nclean.\"\nThen He put out His hand and touched\nhim, saying, \"I am willing; be cleansed.\"\nImmediately the leprosy left him.\nAnd He charged him to tell no one,\n\"But go and show yourself to the priest,\nand make an offering for your cleansing,\nas a testimony to them, just as Moses\ncommanded.\"\nHowever, the report went around\nconcerning Him all the more; and great\nmultitudes came together to hear, and to\nbe healed by Him of their infirmities.\nSo He Himself often withdrew into the\nwilderness and prayed.\nNow it happened on a certain day, as\nHe was teaching, that there were\nPharisees and teachers of the law sitting\nby, who had come out of every town of\nGalilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the\npower of the Lord was present to heal\nthem.\nThen behold, men brought on a bed a\nman who was paralyzed, whom they\nsought to bring in and lay before Him.\nAfter these things He went out and\nsaw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at\nthe tax office. And He said to him,\n\"Follow Me.\"\nAnd when they could not find how they\nmight bring him in, because of the crowd,\nthey went up on the housetop and let\nhim down with his bed through the tiling\ninto the midst before Jesus.\nSo he left all, rose up, and followed\nHim.\nWhen He saw their faith, He said to\nhim, \"Man, your sins are forgiven you.\"\nThen Levi gave Him a great feast in\nhis own house. And there were a great\nnumber of tax collectors and others who\nsat down with them.\nAnd the scribes and the Pharisees\nbegan to reason, saying, \"Who is this\nwho speaks blasphemies? Who can\nforgive sins but God alone?\"\nAnd their scribes and the Pharisees\ncomplained against His disciples, saying,\n\"Why do You eat and drink with tax\ncollectors and sinners?\"\nBut when Jesus perceived their\nthoughts, He answered and said to them,\n\"Why are you reasoning in your hearts?\nJesus answered and said to them,\n\"Those who are well have no need of a\nphysician, but those who are sick.\nWhich is easier, to say, \"Your sins are\nforgiven you,' or to say, \"Rise up and\nwalk'?\nI have not come to call the righteous,\nbut sinners, to repentance.\"\nBut that you may know that the Son of\nMan has power on earth to forgive sins\"-He said to the man who was paralyzed,\n\"I say to you, arise, take up your bed,\nand go to your house.\"\nImmediately he rose up before them,\ntook up what he had been lying on, and\ndeparted to his own house, glorifying\nGod.\nAnd they were all amazed, and they\nglorified God and were filled with fear,\nsaying, \"We have seen strange things\ntoday!\"\nThen they said to Him, \"Why do the\ndisciples of John fast often and make\nprayers, and likewise those of the\nPharisees, but Yours eat and drink?\"\nAnd He said to them, \"Can you make\nthe friends of the bridegroom fast while\nthe bridegroom is with them?\nBut the days will come when the\nbridegroom will be taken away from\nthem; then they will fast in those days.\"\nThen He spoke a parable to them: \"No\none puts a piece from a new garment on\nan old one; otherwise the new makes a\ntear, and also the piece that was taken\nout of the new does not match the old.\nAnd no one puts new wine into old\nwineskins; or else the new wine will\nburst the wineskins and be spilled, and\nthe wineskins will be ruined.\nthe Sabbath, that they might find an\naccusation against Him.\nBut new wine must be put into new\nwineskins, and both are preserved.\nBut He knew their thoughts, and said to\nthe man who had the withered hand,\n\"Arise and stand here.\" And he arose\nand stood.\nAnd no one, having drunk old wine,\nimmediately desires new; for he says,\n\"The old is better.\"'\n6Now it happened on the second\nSabbath after the first that He went\nthrough the grainfields. And His\ndisciples plucked the heads of grain and\nate them, rubbing them in their hands.\nAnd some of the Pharisees said to\nthem, \"Why are you doing what is not\nlawful to do on the Sabbath?\"\nBut Jesus answering them said, \"Have\nyou not even read this, what David did\nwhen he was hungry, he and those who\nwere with him:\nhow he went into the house of God,\ntook and ate the showbread, and also\ngave some to those with him, which is\nnot lawful for any but the priests to eat?\"\nAnd He said to them, \"The Son of Man\nis also Lord of the Sabbath.\"\nNow it happened on another Sabbath,\nalso, that He entered the synagogue\nand taught. And a man was there whose\nright hand was withered.\nSo the scribes and Pharisees watched\nHim closely, whether He would heal on\nThen Jesus said to them, \"I will ask you\none thing: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to\ndo good or to do evil, to save life or to\ndestroy?\"\nAnd when He had looked around at\nthem all, He said to the man, \"Stretch\nout your hand.\" And he did so, and his\nhand was restored as whole as the\nother.\nBut they were filled with rage, and\ndiscussed with one another what they\nmight do to Jesus.\nNow it came to pass in those days that\nHe went out to the mountain to pray,\nand continued all night in prayer to God.\nAnd when it was day, He called His\ndisciples to Himself; and from them He\nchose twelve whom He also named\napostles:\nSimon, whom He also named Peter,\nand Andrew his brother; James and\nJohn; Philip and Bartholomew;\nMatthew and Thomas; James the son\nof Alphaeus, and Simon called the\nZealot;\nJudas the son of James, and Judas\nIscariot who also became a traitor.\nAnd He came down with them and\nstood on a level place with a crowd of\nHis disciples and a great multitude of\npeople from all Judea and Jerusalem,\nand from the seacoast of Tyre and\nSidon, who came to hear Him and be\nhealed of their diseases,\nWoe to you when all men speak well\nof you, For so did their fathers to the\nfalse prophets.\nas well as those who were tormented\nwith unclean spirits. And they were\nhealed.\n\"But I say to you who hear: Love your\nenemies, do good to those who hate\nyou,\nbless those who curse you, and pray\nfor those who spitefully use you.\nAnd the whole multitude sought to\ntouch Him, for power went out from Him\nand healed them all.\nTo him who strikes you on the one\ncheek, offer the other also. And from\nhim who takes away your cloak, do not\nwithhold your tunic either.\nThen He lifted up His eyes toward His\ndisciples, and said: \"Blessed are you\npoor, For yours is the kingdom of God.\nGive to everyone who asks of you.\nAnd from him who takes away your\ngoods do not ask them back.\nBlessed are you who hunger now, For\nyou shall be filled. Blessed are you who\nweep now, For you shall laugh.\nAnd just as you want men to do to you,\nyou also do to them likewise.\nBlessed are you when men hate you,\nAnd when they exclude you, And revile\nyou, and cast out your name as evil, For\nthe Son of Man's sake.\nRejoice in that day and leap for joy!\nFor indeed your reward is great in\nheaven, For in like manner their fathers\ndid to the prophets.\n\"But woe to you who are rich, For you\nhave received your consolation.\n\"But if you love those who love you,\nwhat credit is that to you? For even\nsinners love those who love them.\nAnd if you do good to those who do\ngood to you, what credit is that to you?\nFor even sinners do the same.\nAnd if you lend to those from whom\nyou hope to receive back, what credit is\nthat to you? For even sinners lend to\nsinners to receive as much back.\nWoe to you who are full, For you shall\nhunger. Woe to you who laugh now, For\nyou shall mourn and weep.\nBut love your enemies, do good, and\nlend, hoping for nothing in return; and\nyour reward will be great, and you will\nbe sons of the Most High. For He is kind\nto the unthankful and evil.\nTherefore be merciful, just as your\nFather also is merciful.\n\"Judge not, and you shall not be\njudged. Condemn not, and you shall not\nbe condemned. Forgive, and you will be\nforgiven.\nGive, and it will be given to you: good\nmeasure, pressed down, shaken\ntogether, and running over will be put\ninto your bosom. For with the same\nmeasure that you use, it will be\nmeasured back to you.\"\nA good man out of the good treasure\nof his heart brings forth good; and an\nevil man out of the evil treasure of his\nheart brings forth evil. For out of the\nabundance of the heart his mouth\nspeaks.\n\"But why do you call Me \"Lord, Lord,'\nand not do the things which I say?\nWhoever comes to Me, and hears My\nsayings and does them, I will show you\nwhom he is like:\nAnd He spoke a parable to them: \"Can\nthe blind lead the blind? Will they not\nboth fall into the ditch?\nA disciple is not above his teacher, but\neveryone who is perfectly trained will be\nlike his teacher.\nAnd why do you look at the speck in\nyour brother's eye, but do not perceive\nthe plank in your own eye?\nHe is like a man building a house, who\ndug deep and laid the foundation on the\nrock. And when the flood arose, the\nstream beat vehemently against that\nhouse, and could not shake it, for it was\nfounded on the rock.\nBut he who heard and did nothing is\nlike a man who built a house on the\nearth without a foundation, against\nwhich the stream beat vehemently; and\nimmediately it fell. And the ruin of that\nhouse was great.\"\nOr how can you say to your brother,\n\"Brother, let me remove the speck that\nis in your eye,' when you yourself do not\nsee the plank that is in your own eye?\nHypocrite! First remove the plank from\nyour own eye, and then you will see\nclearly to remove the speck that is in\nyour brother's eye.\n\"For a good tree does not bear bad\nfruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.\nFor every tree is known by its own fruit.\nFor men do not gather figs from thorns,\nnor do they gather grapes from a\nbramble bush.\n7Now when He concluded all His\nsayings in the hearing of the people, He\nentered Capernaum.\nAnd a certain centurion's servant, who\nwas dear to him, was sick and ready to\ndie.\nSo when he heard about Jesus, he sent\nelders of the Jews to Him, pleading with\nHim to come and heal his servant.\nAnd when they came to Jesus, they\nbegged Him earnestly, saying that the\none for whom He should do this was\ndeserving,\nWhen the Lord saw her, He had\ncompassion on her and said to her, \"Do\nnot weep.\"\n\"for he loves our nation, and has built\nus a synagogue.\"\nThen Jesus went with them. And when\nHe was already not far from the house,\nthe centurion sent friends to Him, saying\nto Him, \"Lord, do not trouble Yourself,\nfor I am not worthy that You should\nenter under my roof.\nTherefore I did not even think myself\nworthy to come to You. But say the word,\nand my servant will be healed.\nThen He came and touched the open\ncoffin, and those who carried him stood\nstill. And He said, \"Young man, I say to\nyou, arise.\"\nSo he who was dead sat up and\nbegan to speak. And He presented him\nto his mother.\nThen fear came upon all, and they\nglorified God, saying, \"A great prophet\nhas risen up among us\"; and, \"God has\nvisited His people.\"\nFor I also am a man placed under\nauthority, having soldiers under me. And\nI say to one, \"Go,' and he goes; and to\nanother, \"Come,' and he comes; and to\nmy servant, \"Do this,' and he does it.\"\nAnd this report about Him went\nthroughout all Judea and all the\nsurrounding region.\nWhen Jesus heard these things, He\nmarveled at him, and turned around and\nsaid to the crowd that followed Him, \"I\nsay to you, I have not found such great\nfaith, not even in Israel!\"\nAnd those who were sent, returning to\nthe house, found the servant well who\nhad been sick.\nNow it happened, the day after, that\nHe went into a city called Nain; and\nmany of His disciples went with Him,\nand a large crowd.\nAnd when He came near the gate of\nthe city, behold, a dead man was being\ncarried out, the only son of his mother;\nand she was a widow. And a large\ncrowd from the city was with her.\nThen the disciples of John reported to\nhim concerning all these things.\nAnd John, calling two of his disciples\nto him, sent them to Jesus, saying, \"Are\nYou the Coming One, or do we look for\nanother?\"\nWhen the men had come to Him, they\nsaid, \"John the Baptist has sent us to\nYou, saying, \"Are You the Coming One,\nor do we look for another?\"'\nAnd that very hour He cured many of\ninfirmities, afflictions, and evil spirits;\nand to many blind He gave sight.\nJesus answered and said to them, \"Go\nand tell John the things you have seen\nand heard: that the blind see, the lame\nwalk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf\nhear, the dead are raised, the poor have\nthe gospel preached to them.\nAnd the Lord said, \"To what then shall\nI liken the men of this generation, and\nwhat are they like?\nAnd blessed is he who is not offended\nbecause of Me.\"\nWhen the messengers of John had\ndeparted, He began to speak to the\nmultitudes concerning John: \"What did\nyou go out into the wilderness to see? A\nreed shaken by the wind?\nBut what did you go out to see? A man\nclothed in soft garments? Indeed those\nwho are gorgeously appareled and live\nin luxury are in kings' courts.\nBut what did you go out to see? A\nprophet? Yes, I say to you, and more\nthan a prophet.\nThey are like children sitting in the\nmarketplace and calling to one another,\nsaying: \"We played the flute for you,\nAnd you did not dance; We mourned to\nyou, And you did not weep.'\nFor John the Baptist came neither\neating bread nor drinking wine, and you\nsay, \"He has a demon.'\nThe Son of Man has come eating and\ndrinking, and you say, \"Look, a glutton\nand a winebibber, a friend of tax\ncollectors and sinners!'\nBut wisdom is justified by all her\nchildren.\"\nThis is he of whom it is written:\n\"Behold, I send My messenger before\nYour face, Who will prepare Your way\nbefore You.'\nThen one of the Pharisees asked Him\nto eat with him. And He went to the\nPharisee's house, and sat down to eat.\nFor I say to you, among those born of\nwomen there is not a greater prophet\nthan John the Baptist; but he who is\nleast in the kingdom of God is greater\nthan he.\"\nAnd behold, a woman in the city who\nwas a sinner, when she knew that Jesus\nsat at the table in the Pharisee's house,\nbrought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil,\nAnd when all the people heard Him,\neven the tax collectors justified God,\nhaving been baptized with the baptism\nof John.\nand stood at His feet behind Him\nweeping; and she began to wash His\nfeet with her tears, and wiped them with\nthe hair of her head; and she kissed His\nfeet and anointed them with the fragrant\noil.\nBut the Pharisees and lawyers\nrejected the will of God for themselves,\nnot having been baptized by him.\nNow when the Pharisee who had\ninvited Him saw this, he spoke to\nhimself, saying, \"This Man, if He were a\nprophet, would know who and what\nmanner of woman this is who is\ntouching Him, for she is a sinner.\"\nAnd those who sat at the table with\nHim began to say to themselves, \"Who\nis this who even forgives sins?\"\nAnd Jesus answered and said to him,\n\"Simon, I have something to say to you.\"\nSo he said, \"Teacher, say it.\"\n\"There was a certain creditor who had\ntwo debtors. One owed five hundred\ndenarii, and the other fifty.\nAnd when they had nothing with which\nto repay, he freely forgave them both.\nTell Me, therefore, which of them will\nlove him more?\"\nSimon answered and said, \"I suppose\nthe one whom he forgave more.\" And\nHe said to him, \"You have rightly\njudged.\"\nThen He turned to the woman and\nsaid to Simon, \"Do you see this woman?\nI entered your house; you gave Me no\nwater for My feet, but she has washed\nMy feet with her tears and wiped them\nwith the hair of her head.\nYou gave Me no kiss, but this woman\nhas not ceased to kiss My feet since the\ntime I came in.\nYou did not anoint My head with oil,\nbut this woman has anointed My feet\nwith fragrant oil.\nTherefore I say to you, her sins, which\nare many, are forgiven, for she loved\nmuch. But to whom little is forgiven, the\nsame loves little.\"\nThen He said to her, \"Your sins are\nforgiven.\"\nThen He said to the woman, \"Your\nfaith has saved you. Go in peace.\"\n8Now it came to pass, afterward, that\nHe went through every city and village,\npreaching and bringing the glad tidings\nof the kingdom of God. And the twelve\nwere with Him,\nand certain women who had been\nhealed of evil spirits and infirmities-Mary called Magdalene, out of whom\nhad come seven demons,\nand Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's\nsteward, and Susanna, and many others\nwho provided for Him from their\nsubstance.\nAnd when a great multitude had\ngathered, and they had come to Him\nfrom every city, He spoke by a parable:\n\"A sower went out to sow his seed. And\nas he sowed, some fell by the wayside;\nand it was trampled down, and the birds\nof the air devoured it.\nSome fell on rock; and as soon as it\nsprang up, it withered away because it\nlacked moisture.\nAnd some fell among thorns, and the\nthorns sprang up with it and choked it.\nBut others fell on good ground, sprang\nup, and yielded a crop a hundredfold.\"\nWhen He had said these things He cried,\n\"He who has ears to hear, let him hear!\"\nFor nothing is secret that will not be\nrevealed, nor anything hidden that will\nnot be known and come to light.\nThen His disciples asked Him, saying,\n\"What does this parable mean?\"\nAnd He said, \"To you it has been given\nto know the mysteries of the kingdom of\nGod, but to the rest it is given in\nparables, that \"Seeing they may not see,\nAnd hearing they may not understand.'\n\"Now the parable is this: The seed is\nthe word of God.\nThose by the wayside are the ones\nwho hear; then the devil comes and\ntakes away the word out of their hearts,\nlest they should believe and be saved.\nBut the ones on the rock are those\nwho, when they hear, receive the word\nwith joy; and these have no root, who\nbelieve for a while and in time of\ntemptation fall away.\nNow the ones that fell among thorns\nare those who, when they have heard,\ngo out and are choked with cares, riches,\nand pleasures of life, and bring no fruit\nto maturity.\nTherefore take heed how you hear.\nFor whoever has, to him more will be\ngiven; and whoever does not have, even\nwhat he seems to have will be taken\nfrom him.\"\nThen His mother and brothers came to\nHim, and could not approach Him\nbecause of the crowd.\nAnd it was told Him by some, who said,\n\"Your mother and Your brothers are\nstanding outside, desiring to see You.\"\nBut He answered and said to them,\n\"My mother and My brothers are these\nwho hear the word of God and do it.\"\nNow it happened, on a certain day,\nthat He got into a boat with His disciples.\nAnd He said to them, \"Let us cross over\nto the other side of the lake.\" And they\nlaunched out.\nBut as they sailed He fell asleep. And\na windstorm came down on the lake,\nand they were filling with water, and\nwere in jeopardy.\nBut the ones that fell on the good\nground are those who, having heard the\nword with a noble and good heart, keep\nit and bear fruit with patience.\n\"No one, when he has lit a lamp,\ncovers it with a vessel or puts it under a\nbed, but sets it on a lampstand, that\nthose who enter may see the light.\nAnd they came to Him and awoke Him,\nsaying, \"Master, Master, we are\nperishing!\" Then He arose and rebuked\nthe wind and the raging of the water.\nAnd they ceased, and there was a calm.\nBut He said to them, \"Where is your\nfaith?\" And they were afraid, and\nmarveled, saying to one another, \"Who\ncan this be? For He commands even\nthe winds and water, and they obey\nHim!\"\nWhen those who fed them saw what\nhad happened, they fled and told it in\nthe city and in the country.\nThen they sailed to the country of the\nGadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.\nAnd when He stepped out on the land,\nthere met Him a certain man from the\ncity who had demons for a long time.\nAnd he wore no clothes, nor did he live\nin a house but in the tombs.\nWhen he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell\ndown before Him, and with a loud voice\nsaid, \"What have I to do with You, Jesus,\nSon of the Most High God? I beg You,\ndo not torment me!\"\nFor He had commanded the unclean\nspirit to come out of the man. For it had\noften seized him, and he was kept under\nguard, bound with chains and shackles;\nand he broke the bonds and was driven\nby the demon into the wilderness.\nThen they went out to see what had\nhappened, and came to Jesus, and\nfound the man from whom the demons\nhad departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus,\nclothed and in his right mind. And they\nwere afraid.\nThey also who had seen it told them\nby what means he who had been\ndemon-possessed was healed.\nThen the whole multitude of the\nsurrounding region of the Gadarenes\nasked Him to depart from them, for they\nwere seized with great fear. And He got\ninto the boat and returned.\nNow the man from whom the demons\nhad departed begged Him that he might\nbe with Him. But Jesus sent him away,\nsaying,\nJesus asked him, saying, \"What is\nyour name?\" And he said, \"Legion,\"\nbecause many demons had entered him.\nAnd they begged Him that He would\nnot command them to go out into the\nabyss.\n\"Return to your own house, and tell\nwhat great things God has done for\nyou.\" And he went his way and\nproclaimed throughout the whole city\nwhat great things Jesus had done for\nhim.\nNow a herd of many swine was\nfeeding there on the mountain. So they\nbegged Him that He would permit them\nto enter them. And He permitted them.\nThen the demons went out of the man\nand entered the swine, and the herd ran\nviolently down the steep place into the\nlake and drowned.\nSo it was, when Jesus returned, that\nthe multitude welcomed Him, for they\nwere all waiting for Him.\nAnd behold, there came a man named\nJairus, and he was a ruler of the\nsynagogue. And he fell down at Jesus'\nfeet and begged Him to come to his\nhouse,\nfor he had an only daughter about\ntwelve years of age, and she was dying.\nBut as He went, the multitudes thronged\nHim.\nBut when Jesus heard it, He answered\nhim, saying, \"Do not be afraid; only\nbelieve, and she will be made well.\"\nNow a woman, having a flow of blood\nfor twelve years, who had spent all her\nlivelihood on physicians and could not\nbe healed by any,\nWhen He came into the house, He\npermitted no one to go in except Peter,\nJames, and John, and the father and\nmother of the girl.\ncame from behind and touched the\nborder of His garment. And immediately\nher flow of blood stopped.\nNow all wept and mourned for her; but\nHe said, \"Do not weep; she is not dead,\nbut sleeping.\"\nAnd Jesus said, \"Who touched Me?\"\nWhen all denied it, Peter and those with\nhim said, \"Master, the multitudes throng\nand press You, and You say, \"Who\ntouched Me?\"'\nAnd they ridiculed Him, knowing that\nshe was dead.\nBut He put them all outside, took her\nby the hand and called, saying, \"Little\ngirl, arise.\"\nBut Jesus said, \"Somebody touched\nMe, for I perceived power going out from\nMe.\"\nThen her spirit returned, and she\narose immediately. And He commanded\nthat she be given something to eat.\nNow when the woman saw that she\nwas not hidden, she came trembling;\nand falling down before Him, she\ndeclared to Him in the presence of all\nthe people the reason she had touched\nHim and how she was healed\nimmediately.\nAnd He said to her, \"Daughter, be of\ngood cheer; your faith has made you\nwell. Go in peace.\"\nWhile He was still speaking, someone\ncame from the ruler of the synagogue's\nhouse, saying to him, \"Your daughter is\ndead. Do not trouble the Teacher.\"\nAnd her parents were astonished, but\nHe charged them to tell no one what\nhad happened.\n9Then He called His twelve disciples\ntogether and gave them power and\nauthority over all demons, and to cure\ndiseases.\nHe sent them to preach the kingdom of\nGod and to heal the sick.\nAnd He said to them, \"Take nothing for\nthe journey, neither staffs nor bag nor\nbread nor money; and do not have two\ntunics apiece.\n\"Whatever house you enter, stay there,\nand from there depart.\nAnd whoever will not receive you, when\nyou go out of that city, shake off the very\ndust from your feet as a testimony\nagainst them.\"\nSo they departed and went through the\ntowns, preaching the gospel and healing\neverywhere.\nBut He said to them, \"You give them\nsomething to eat.\" And they said, \"We\nhave no more than five loaves and two\nfish, unless we go and buy food for all\nthese people.\"\nFor there were about five thousand\nmen. Then He said to His disciples,\n\"Make them sit down in groups of fifty.\"\nAnd they did so, and made them all sit\ndown.\nNow Herod the tetrarch heard of all that\nwas done by Him; and he was\nperplexed, because it was said by some\nthat John had risen from the dead,\nand by some that Elijah had appeared,\nand by others that one of the old\nprophets had risen again.\nHerod said, \"John I have beheaded, but\nwho is this of whom I hear such things?\"\nSo he sought to see Him.\nAnd the apostles, when they had\nreturned, told Him all that they had done.\nThen He took them and went aside\nprivately into a deserted place belonging\nto the city called Bethsaida.\nBut when the multitudes knew it, they\nfollowed Him; and He received them\nand spoke to them about the kingdom of\nGod, and healed those who had need of\nhealing.\nWhen the day began to wear away,\nthe twelve came and said to Him, \"Send\nthe multitude away, that they may go\ninto the surrounding towns and country,\nand lodge and get provisions; for we are\nin a deserted place here.\"\nThen He took the five loaves and the\ntwo fish, and looking up to heaven, He\nblessed and broke them, and gave them\nto the disciples to set before the\nmultitude.\nSo they all ate and were filled, and\ntwelve baskets of the leftover fragments\nwere taken up by them.\nAnd it happened, as He was alone\npraying, that His disciples joined Him,\nand He asked them, saying, \"Who do\nthe crowds say that I am?\"\nSo they answered and said, \"John the\nBaptist, but some say Elijah; and others\nsay that one of the old prophets has\nrisen again.\"\nHe said to them, \"But who do you say\nthat I am?\" Peter answered and said,\n\"The Christ of God.\"\nAnd\nHe\nstrictly\nwarned\nand\ncommanded them to tell this to no one,\nsaying, \"The Son of Man must suffer\nmany things, and be rejected by the\nelders and chief priests and scribes, and\nbe killed, and be raised the third day.\"\nThen He said to them all, \"If anyone\ndesires to come after Me, let him deny\nhimself, and take up his cross daily, and\nfollow Me.\nBut Peter and those with him were\nheavy with sleep; and when they were\nfully awake, they saw His glory and the\ntwo men who stood with Him.\nFor whoever desires to save his life\nwill lose it, but whoever loses his life for\nMy sake will save it.\nThen it happened, as they were\nparting from Him, that Peter said to\nJesus, \"Master, it is good for us to be\nhere; and let us make three tabernacles:\none for You, one for Moses, and one for\nElijah\"--not knowing what he said.\nFor what profit is it to a man if he gains\nthe whole world, and is himself\ndestroyed or lost?\nWhile he was saying this, a cloud\ncame and overshadowed them; and\nthey were fearful as they entered the\ncloud.\nFor whoever is ashamed of Me and\nMy words, of him the Son of Man will be\nashamed when He comes in His own\nglory, and in His Father's, and of the\nholy angels.\nAnd a voice came out of the cloud,\nsaying, \"This is My beloved Son. Hear\nHim!\"\nBut I tell you truly, there are some\nstanding here who shall not taste death\ntill they see the kingdom of God.\"\nWhen the voice had ceased, Jesus\nwas found alone. But they kept quiet,\nand told no one in those days any of the\nthings they had seen.\nNow it came to pass, about eight days\nafter these sayings, that He took Peter,\nJohn, and James and went up on the\nmountain to pray.\nNow it happened on the next day,\nwhen they had come down from the\nmountain, that a great multitude met\nHim.\nAs He prayed, the appearance of His\nface was altered, and His robe became\nwhite and glistening.\nSuddenly a man from the multitude\ncried out, saying, \"Teacher, I implore\nYou, look on my son, for he is my only\nchild.\nAnd behold, two men talked with Him,\nwho were Moses and Elijah,\nwho appeared in glory and spoke of\nHis decease which He was about to\naccomplish at Jerusalem.\nAnd behold, a spirit seizes him, and he\nsuddenly cries out; it convulses him so\nthat he foams at the mouth; and it\ndeparts from him with great difficulty,\nbruising him.\nSo I implored Your disciples to cast it\nout, but they could not.\"\nYour name, and we forbade him\nbecause he does not follow with us.\"\nThen Jesus answered and said, \"O\nfaithless and perverse generation, how\nlong shall I be with you and bear with\nyou? Bring your son here.\"\nBut Jesus said to him, \"Do not forbid\nhim, for he who is not against us is on\nour side.\"\nAnd as he was still coming, the demon\nthrew him down and convulsed him.\nThen Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit,\nhealed the child, and gave him back to\nhis father.\nAnd they were all amazed at the\nmajesty of God. But while everyone\nmarveled at all the things which Jesus\ndid, He said to His disciples,\n\"Let these words sink down into your\nears, for the Son of Man is about to be\nbetrayed into the hands of men.\"\nBut they did not understand this saying,\nand it was hidden from them so that\nthey did not perceive it; and they were\nafraid to ask Him about this saying.\nThen a dispute arose among them as\nto which of them would be greatest.\nNow it came to pass, when the time\nhad come for Him to be received up,\nthat He steadfastly set His face to go to\nJerusalem,\nand sent messengers before His face.\nAnd as they went, they entered a village\nof the Samaritans, to prepare for Him.\nBut they did not receive Him, because\nHis face was set for the journey to\nJerusalem.\nAnd when His disciples James and\nJohn saw this, they said, \"Lord, do You\nwant us to command fire to come down\nfrom heaven and consume them, just as\nElijah did?\"\nBut He turned and rebuked them, and\nsaid, \"You do not know what manner of\nspirit you are of.\nAnd Jesus, perceiving the thought of\ntheir heart, took a little child and set him\nby Him,\nFor the Son of Man did not come to\ndestroy men's lives but to save them.\"\nAnd they went to another village.\nand said to them, \"Whoever receives\nthis little child in My name receives Me;\nand whoever receives Me receives Him\nwho sent Me. For he who is least among\nyou all will be great.\"\nNow John answered and said, \"Master,\nwe saw someone casting out demons in\nNow it happened as they journeyed on\nthe road, that someone said to Him,\n\"Lord, I will follow You wherever You\ngo.\"\nAnd Jesus said to him, \"Foxes have\nholes and birds of the air have nests,\nbut the Son of Man has nowhere to lay\nHis head.\"\nThen He said to another, \"Follow Me.\"\nBut he said, \"Lord, let me first go and\nbury my father.\"\nAnd remain in the same house, eating\nand drinking such things as they give,\nfor the laborer is worthy of his wages.\nDo not go from house to house.\nJesus said to him, \"Let the dead bury\ntheir own dead, but you go and preach\nthe kingdom of God.\"\nWhatever city you enter, and they\nreceive you, eat such things as are set\nbefore you.\nAnd another also said, \"Lord, I will\nfollow You, but let me first go and bid\nthem farewell who are at my house.\"\nAnd heal the sick there, and say to\nthem, \"The kingdom of God has come\nnear to you.'\nBut Jesus said to him, \"No one, having\nput his hand to the plow, and looking\nback, is fit for the kingdom of God.\"\n10After these things the Lord\nappointed seventy others also, and sent\nthem two by two before His face into\nevery city and place where He Himself\nwas about to go.\nThen He said to them, \"The harvest\ntruly is great, but the laborers are few;\ntherefore pray the Lord of the harvest to\nsend out laborers into His harvest.\nGo your way; behold, I send you out as\nlambs among wolves.\nCarry neither money bag, knapsack,\nnor sandals; and greet no one along the\nroad.\nBut whatever house you enter, first say,\n\"Peace to this house.'\nAnd if a son of peace is there, your\npeace will rest on it; if not, it will return to\nyou.\nBut whatever city you enter, and they\ndo not receive you, go out into its streets\nand say,\n\"The very dust of your city which clings\nto us we wipe off against you.\nNevertheless know this, that the\nkingdom of God has come near you.'\nBut I say to you that it will be more\ntolerable in that Day for Sodom than for\nthat city.\n\"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you,\nBethsaida! For if the mighty works which\nwere done in you had been done in Tyre\nand Sidon, they would have repented\nlong ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.\nBut it will be more tolerable for Tyre\nand Sidon at the judgment than for you.\nAnd you, Capernaum, who are exalted\nto heaven, will be brought down to\nHades.\nHe who hears you hears Me, he who\nrejects you rejects Me, and he who\nrejects Me rejects Him who sent Me.\"\nThen the seventy returned with joy,\nsaying, \"Lord, even the demons are\nsubject to us in Your name.\"\nAnd behold, a certain lawyer stood up\nand tested Him, saying, \"Teacher, what\nshall I do to inherit eternal life?\"\nAnd He said to them, \"I saw Satan fall\nlike lightning from heaven.\nHe said to him, \"What is written in the\nlaw? What is your reading of it?\"\nBehold, I give you the authority to\ntrample on serpents and scorpions, and\nover all the power of the enemy, and\nnothing shall by any means hurt you.\nSo he answered and said, \"\"You shall\nlove the LORD your God with all your\nheart, with all your soul, with all your\nstrength, and with all your mind,' and\n\"your neighbor as yourself.\"'\nNevertheless do not rejoice in this, that\nthe spirits are subject to you, but rather\nrejoice because your names are written\nin heaven.\"\nAnd He said to him, \"You have\nanswered rightly; do this and you will\nlive.\"\nIn that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit\nand said, \"I thank You, Father, Lord of\nheaven and earth, that You have hidden\nthese things from the wise and prudent\nand revealed them to babes. Even so,\nFather, for so it seemed good in Your\nsight.\nAll things have been delivered to Me\nby My Father, and no one knows who\nthe Son is except the Father, and who\nthe Father is except the Son, and the\none to whom the Son wills to reveal\nHim.\"\nBut he, wanting to justify himself, said\nto Jesus, \"And who is my neighbor?\"\nThen Jesus answered and said: \"A\ncertain man went down from Jerusalem\nto Jericho, and fell among thieves, who\nstripped him of his clothing, wounded\nhim, and departed, leaving him half\ndead.\nNow by chance a certain priest came\ndown that road. And when he saw him,\nhe passed by on the other side.\nThen He turned to His disciples and\nsaid privately, \"Blessed are the eyes\nwhich see the things you see;\nLikewise a Levite, when he arrived at\nthe place, came and looked, and passed\nby on the other side.\nfor I tell you that many prophets and\nkings have desired to see what you see,\nand have not seen it, and to hear what\nyou hear, and have not heard it.\"\nBut a certain Samaritan, as he\njourneyed, came where he was. And\nwhen he saw him, he had compassion.\nSo he went to him and bandaged his\nwounds, pouring on oil and wine; and he\nset him on his own animal, brought him\nto an inn, and took care of him.\nOn the next day, when he departed,\nhe took out two denarii, gave them to\nthe innkeeper, and said to him, \"Take\ncare of him; and whatever more you\nspend, when I come again, I will repay\nyou.'\nSo which of these three do you think\nwas neighbor to him who fell among the\nthieves?\"\nHim, \"Lord, teach us to pray, as John\nalso taught his disciples.\"\nSo He said to them, \"When you pray,\nsay: Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be\nYour name. Your kingdom come. Your\nwill be done On earth as it is in heaven.\nGive us day by day our daily bread.\nAnd he said, \"He who showed mercy\non him.\" Then Jesus said to him, \"Go\nand do likewise.\"\nAnd forgive us our sins, For we also\nforgive everyone who is indebted to us.\nAnd do not lead us into temptation, But\ndeliver us from the evil one.\"\nNow it happened as they went that He\nentered a certain village; and a certain\nwoman named Martha welcomed Him\ninto her house.\nAnd He said to them, \"Which of you\nshall have a friend, and go to him at\nmidnight and say to him, \"Friend, lend\nme three loaves;\nAnd she had a sister called Mary, who\nalso sat at Jesus' feet and heard His\nword.\nfor a friend of mine has come to me on\nhis journey, and I have nothing to set\nbefore him';\nBut Martha was distracted with much\nserving, and she approached Him and\nsaid, \"Lord, do You not care that my\nsister has left me to serve alone?\nTherefore tell her to help me.\"\nand he will answer from within and say,\n\"Do not trouble me; the door is now shut,\nand my children are with me in bed; I\ncannot rise and give to you'?\nAnd Jesus answered and said to her,\n\"Martha, Martha, you are worried and\ntroubled about many things.\nI say to you, though he will not rise and\ngive to him because he is his friend, yet\nbecause of his persistence he will rise\nand give him as many as he needs.\nBut one thing is needed, and Mary has\nchosen that good part, which will not be\ntaken away from her.\"\n\"So I say to you, ask, and it will be\ngiven to you; seek, and you will find;\nknock, and it will be opened to you.\n11Now it came to pass, as He was\npraying in a certain place, when He\nceased, that one of His disciples said to\nFor everyone who asks receives, and\nhe who seeks finds, and to him who\nknocks it will be opened.\nIf a son asks for bread from any father\namong you, will he give him a stone? Or\nif he asks for a fish, will he give him a\nserpent instead of a fish?\nWhen a strong man, fully armed,\nguards his own palace, his goods are in\npeace.\nOr if he asks for an egg, will he offer\nhim a scorpion?\nBut when a stronger than he comes\nupon him and overcomes him, he takes\nfrom him all his armor in which he\ntrusted, and divides his spoils.\nIf you then, being evil, know how to\ngive good gifts to your children, how\nmuch more will your heavenly Father\ngive the Holy Spirit to those who ask\nHim!\"\nHe who is not with Me is against Me,\nand he who does not gather with Me\nscatters.\nAnd He was casting out a demon, and\nit was mute. So it was, when the demon\nhad gone out, that the mute spoke; and\nthe multitudes marveled.\n\"When an unclean spirit goes out of a\nman, he goes through dry places,\nseeking rest; and finding none, he says,\n\"I will return to my house from which I\ncame.'\nBut some of them said, \"He casts out\ndemons by Beelzebub, the ruler of the\ndemons.\"\nAnd when he comes, he finds it swept\nand put in order.\nOthers, testing Him, sought from Him\na sign from heaven.\nBut He, knowing their thoughts, said to\nthem: \"Every kingdom divided against\nitself is brought to desolation, and a\nhouse divided against a house falls.\nIf Satan also is divided against himself,\nhow will his kingdom stand? Because\nyou say I cast out demons by Beelzebub.\nAnd if I cast out demons by Beelzebub,\nby whom do your sons cast them out?\nTherefore they will be your judges.\nBut if I cast out demons with the finger\nof God, surely the kingdom of God has\ncome upon you.\nThen he goes and takes with him\nseven other spirits more wicked than\nhimself, and they enter and dwell there;\nand the last state of that man is worse\nthan the first.\"\nAnd it happened, as He spoke these\nthings, that a certain woman from the\ncrowd raised her voice and said to Him,\n\"Blessed is the womb that bore You,\nand the breasts which nursed You!\"\nBut He said, \"More than that, blessed\nare those who hear the word of God and\nkeep it!\"\nAnd while the crowds were thickly\ngathered together, He began to say,\n\"This is an evil generation. It seeks a\nsign, and no sign will be given to it\nexcept the sign of Jonah the prophet.\nFor as Jonah became a sign to the\nNinevites, so also the Son of Man will be\nto this generation.\nThen the Lord said to him, \"Now you\nPharisees make the outside of the cup\nand dish clean, but your inward part is\nfull of greed and wickedness.\nThe queen of the South will rise up in\nthe judgment with the men of this\ngeneration and condemn them, for she\ncame from the ends of the earth to hear\nthe wisdom of Solomon; and indeed a\ngreater than Solomon is here.\nThe men of Nineveh will rise up in the\njudgment with this generation and\ncondemn it, for they repented at the\npreaching of Jonah; and indeed a\ngreater than Jonah is here.\nFoolish ones! Did not He who made\nthe outside make the inside also?\nBut rather give alms of such things as\nyou have; then indeed all things are\nclean to you.\n\"But woe to you Pharisees! For you\ntithe mint and rue and all manner of\nherbs, and pass by justice and the love\nof God. These you ought to have done,\nwithout leaving the others undone.\n\"No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts\nit in a secret place or under a basket,\nbut on a lampstand, that those who\ncome in may see the light.\nWoe to you Pharisees! For you love\nthe best seats in the synagogues and\ngreetings in the marketplaces.\nThe lamp of the body is the eye.\nTherefore, when your eye is good, your\nwhole body also is full of light. But when\nyour eye is bad, your body also is full of\ndarkness.\nWoe to you, scribes and Pharisees,\nhypocrites! For you are like graves\nwhich are not seen, and the men who\nwalk over them are not aware of them.\"\nTherefore take heed that the light\nwhich is in you is not darkness.\nThen one of the lawyers answered and\nsaid to Him, \"Teacher, by saying these\nthings You reproach us also.\"\nIf then your whole body is full of light,\nhaving no part dark, the whole body will\nbe full of light, as when the bright\nshining of a lamp gives you light.\"\nAnd as He spoke, a certain Pharisee\nasked Him to dine with him. So He went\nin and sat down to eat.\nWhen the Pharisee saw it, he\nmarveled that He had not first washed\nbefore dinner.\nAnd He said, \"Woe to you also,\nlawyers! For you load men with burdens\nhard to bear, and you yourselves do not\ntouch the burdens with one of your\nfingers.\nWoe to you! For you build the tombs of\nthe prophets, and your fathers killed\nthem.\nIn fact, you bear witness that you\napprove the deeds of your fathers; for\nthey indeed killed them, and you build\ntheir tombs.\nTherefore the wisdom of God also said,\n\"I will send them prophets and apostles,\nand some of them they will kill and\npersecute,'\nthat the blood of all the prophets which\nwas shed from the foundation of the\nworld may be required of this generation,\nfrom the blood of Abel to the blood of\nZechariah who perished between the\naltar and the temple. Yes, I say to you, it\nshall be required of this generation.\n\"Woe to you lawyers! For you have\ntaken away the key of knowledge. You\ndid not enter in yourselves, and those\nwho were entering in you hindered.\"\nTherefore whatever you have spoken in\nthe dark will be heard in the light, and\nwhat you have spoken in the ear in inner\nrooms will be proclaimed on the\nhousetops.\n\"And I say to you, My friends, do not be\nafraid of those who kill the body, and\nafter that have no more that they can do.\nBut I will show you whom you should\nfear: Fear Him who, after He has killed,\nhas power to cast into hell; yes, I say to\nyou, fear Him!\n\"Are not five sparrows sold for two\ncopper coins? And not one of them is\nforgotten before God.\nBut the very hairs of your head are all\nnumbered. Do not fear therefore; you\nare of more value than many sparrows.\nAnd as He said these things to them,\nthe scribes and the Pharisees began to\nassail Him vehemently, and to crossexamine Him about many things,\n\"Also I say to you, whoever confesses\nMe before men, him the Son of Man\nalso will confess before the angels of\nGod.\nlying in wait for Him, and seeking to\ncatch Him in something He might say,\nthat they might accuse Him.\n12In the meantime, when an\ninnumerable multitude of people had\ngathered together, so that they trampled\none another, He began to say to His\ndisciples first of all, \"Beware of the\nleaven of the Pharisees, which is\nhypocrisy.\nFor there is nothing covered that will\nnot be revealed, nor hidden that will not\nbe known.\nBut he who denies Me before men will\nbe denied before the angels of God.\n\"And anyone who speaks a word\nagainst the Son of Man, it will be\nforgiven him; but to him who\nblasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it\nwill not be forgiven.\n\"Now when they bring you to the\nsynagogues and magistrates and\nauthorities, do not worry about how or\nwhat you should answer, or what you\nshould say.\nFor the Holy Spirit will teach you in\nthat very hour what you ought to say.\"\nabout your life, what you will eat; nor\nabout the body, what you will put on.\nThen one from the crowd said to Him,\n\"Teacher, tell my brother to divide the\ninheritance with me.\"\nLife is more than food, and the body is\nmore than clothing.\nBut He said to him, \"Man, who made\nMe a judge or an arbitrator over you?\"\nAnd He said to them, \"Take heed and\nbeware of covetousness, for one's life\ndoes not consist in the abundance of the\nthings he possesses.\"\nThen He spoke a parable to them,\nsaying: \"The ground of a certain rich\nman yielded plentifully.\nConsider the ravens, for they neither\nsow nor reap, which have neither\nstorehouse nor barn; and God feeds\nthem. Of how much more value are you\nthan the birds?\nAnd which of you by worrying can add\none cubit to his stature?\nIf you then are not able to do the least,\nwhy are you anxious for the rest?\nAnd he thought within himself, saying,\n\"What shall I do, since I have no room to\nstore my crops?'\nConsider the lilies, how they grow:\nthey neither toil nor spin; and yet I say to\nyou, even Solomon in all his glory was\nnot arrayed like one of these.\nSo he said, \"I will do this: I will pull\ndown my barns and build greater, and\nthere I will store all my crops and my\ngoods.\nIf then God so clothes the grass, which\ntoday is in the field and tomorrow is\nthrown into the oven, how much more\nwill He clothe you, O you of little faith?\nAnd I will say to my soul, \"Soul, you\nhave many goods laid up for many\nyears; take your ease; eat, drink, and be\nmerry.\"'\n\"And do not seek what you should eat\nor what you should drink, nor have an\nanxious mind.\nBut God said to him, \"Fool! This night\nyour soul will be required of you; then\nwhose will those things be which you\nhave provided?'\n\"So is he who lays up treasure for\nhimself, and is not rich toward God.\"\nThen He said to His disciples,\n\"Therefore I say to you, do not worry\nFor all these things the nations of the\nworld seek after, and your Father knows\nthat you need these things.\nBut seek the kingdom of God, and all\nthese things shall be added to you.\n\"Do not fear, little flock, for it is your\nFather's good pleasure to give you the\nkingdom.\nSell what you have and give alms;\nprovide yourselves money bags which\ndo not grow old, a treasure in the\nheavens that does not fail, where no\nthief approaches nor moth destroys.\nAnd the Lord said, \"Who then is that\nfaithful and wise steward, whom his\nmaster will make ruler over his\nhousehold, to give them their portion of\nfood in due season?\nFor where your treasure is, there your\nheart will be also.\nBlessed is that servant whom his\nmaster will find so doing when he comes.\n\"Let your waist be girded and your\nlamps burning;\nTruly, I say to you that he will make\nhim ruler over all that he has.\nand you yourselves be like men who\nwait for their master, when he will return\nfrom the wedding, that when he comes\nand knocks they may open to him\nimmediately.\nBut if that servant says in his heart,\n\"My master is delaying his coming,' and\nbegins to beat the male and female\nservants, and to eat and drink and be\ndrunk,\nBlessed are those servants whom the\nmaster, when he comes, will find\nwatching. Assuredly, I say to you that he\nwill gird himself and have them sit down\nto eat, and will come and serve them.\nthe master of that servant will come on\na day when he is not looking for him,\nand at an hour when he is not aware,\nand will cut him in two and appoint him\nhis portion with the unbelievers.\nAnd if he should come in the second\nwatch, or come in the third watch, and\nfind them so, blessed are those servants.\nAnd that servant who knew his\nmaster's will, and did not prepare\nhimself or do according to his will, shall\nbe beaten with many stripes.\nBut know this, that if the master of the\nhouse had known what hour the thief\nwould come, he would have watched\nand not allowed his house to be broken\ninto.\nTherefore you also be ready, for the\nSon of Man is coming at an hour you do\nnot expect.\"\nThen Peter said to Him, \"Lord, do You\nspeak this parable only to us, or to all\npeople?\"\nBut he who did not know, yet\ncommitted things deserving of stripes,\nshall be beaten with few. For everyone\nto whom much is given, from him much\nwill be required; and to whom much has\nbeen committed, of him they will ask the\nmore.\n\"I came to send fire on the earth, and\nhow I wish it were already kindled!\nBut I have a baptism to be baptized\nwith, and how distressed I am till it is\naccomplished!\nDo you suppose that I came to give\npeace on earth?

Cut it down; why does it use\nup the ground?'\nBut he answered and said to him, \"Sir,\nlet it alone this year also, until I dig\naround it and fertilize it.\nAnd if it bears fruit, well. But if not, after\nthat you can cut it down.\"'\nNow He was teaching in one of the\nsynagogues on the Sabbath.\nAnd behold, there was a woman who\nhad a spirit of infirmity eighteen years,\nand was bent over and could in no way\nraise herself up.\nBut when Jesus saw her, He called\nher to Him and said to her, \"Woman,\nyou are loosed from your infirmity.\"\nAnd He laid His hands on her, and\nimmediately she was made straight, and\nglorified God.\nBut the ruler of the synagogue\nanswered with indignation, because\nJesus had healed on the Sabbath; and\nhe said to the crowd, \"There are six\ndays on which men ought to work;\ntherefore come and be healed on them,\nand not on the Sabbath day.\"\nThe Lord then answered him and said,\n\"Hypocrite! Does not each one of you on\nthe Sabbath loose his ox or donkey from\nthe stall, and lead it away to water it?\nSo ought not this woman, being a\ndaughter of Abraham, whom Satan has\nbound--think of it--for eighteen years, be\nloosed from this bond on the Sabbath?\"\nAnd when He said these things, all His\nadversaries were put to shame; and all\nthe multitude rejoiced for all the glorious\nthings that were done by Him.\nThen He said, \"What is the kingdom of\nGod like? And to what shall I compare\nit?\nIt is like a mustard seed, which a man\ntook and put in his garden; and it grew\nand became a large tree, and the birds\nof the air nested in its branches.\"\nAnd again He said, \"To what shall I\nliken the kingdom of God?\nIt is like leaven, which a woman took\nand hid in three measures of meal till it\nwas all leavened.\"\nAnd He went through the cities and\nvillages, teaching, and journeying\ntoward Jerusalem.\nThen one said to Him, \"Lord, are there\nfew who are saved?\" And He said to\nthem,\n\"Strive to enter through the narrow\ngate, for many, I say to you, will seek to\nenter and will not be able.\nWhen once the Master of the house\nhas risen up and shut the door, and you\nbegin to stand outside and knock at the\ndoor, saying, \"Lord, Lord, open for us,'\nand He will answer and say to you, \"I do\nnot know you, where you are from,'\nthen you will begin to say, \"We ate and\ndrank in Your presence, and You taught\nin our streets.'\nBut He will say, \"I tell you I do not\nknow you, where you are from. Depart\nfrom Me, all you workers of iniquity.'\nThere will be weeping and gnashing of\nteeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac\nand Jacob and all the prophets in the\nkingdom of God, and yourselves thrust\nout.\nThey will come from the east and the\nwest, from the north and the south, and\nsit down in the kingdom of God.\nAnd Jesus, answering, spoke to the\nlawyers and Pharisees, saying, \"Is it\nlawful to heal on the Sabbath?\"\nAnd indeed there are last who will be\nfirst, and there are first who will be last.\"\nBut they kept silent. And He took him\nand healed him, and let him go.\nOn that very day some Pharisees\ncame, saying to Him, \"Get out and\ndepart from here, for Herod wants to kill\nYou.\"\nThen He answered them, saying,\n\"Which of you, having a donkey or an ox\nthat has fallen into a pit, will not\nimmediately pull him out on the Sabbath\nday?\"\nAnd He said to them, \"Go, tell that fox,\n\"Behold, I cast out demons and perform\ncures today and tomorrow, and the third\nday I shall be perfected.'\nAnd they could not\nregarding these things.\nanswer\nHim\nNevertheless I must journey today,\ntomorrow, and the day following; for it\ncannot be that a prophet should perish\noutside of Jerusalem.\n\"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who\nkills the prophets and stones those who\nare sent to her!

I ask you to have me\nexcused.'\nAnd whoever does not bear his cross\nand come after Me cannot be My\ndisciple.\nAnd another said, \"I have bought five\nyoke of oxen, and I am going to test\nthem. I ask you to have me excused.'\nFor which of you, intending to build a\ntower, does not sit down first and count\nthe cost, whether he has enough to\nfinish it--\nStill another said, \"I have married a\nwife, and therefore I cannot come.'\nlest, after he has laid the foundation,\nand is not able to finish, all who see it\nbegin to mock him,\nSo that servant came and reported\nthese things to his master. Then the\nmaster of the house, being angry, said\nto his servant, \"Go out quickly into the\nstreets and lanes of the city, and bring in\nsaying, \"This man began to build and\nwas not able to finish.'\nOr what king, going to make war\nagainst another king, does not sit down\nfirst and consider whether he is able\nwith ten thousand to meet him who\ncomes against him with twenty\nthousand?\nOr else, while the other is still a great\nway off, he sends a delegation and asks\nconditions of peace.\nsaying to them, \"Rejoice with me, for I\nhave found my sheep which was lost!'\nI say to you that likewise there will be\nmore joy in heaven over one sinner who\nrepents than over ninety-nine just\npersons who need no repentance.\nSo likewise, whoever of you does not\nforsake all that he has cannot be My\ndisciple.\n\"Or what woman, having ten silver\ncoins, if she loses one coin, does not\nlight a lamp, sweep the house, and\nsearch carefully until she finds it?\n\"Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its\nflavor, how shall it be seasoned?\nIt is neither fit for the land nor for the\ndunghill, but men throw it out. He who\nhas ears to hear, let him hear!\"\n15Then all the tax collectors and the\nsinners drew near to Him to hear Him.\nAnd the Pharisees and scribes\ncomplained, saying, \"This Man receives\nsinners and eats with them.\"\nSo He spoke this parable to them,\nsaying:\n\"What man of you, having a hundred\nsheep, if he loses one of them, does not\nleave the ninety-nine in the wilderness,\nand go after the one which is lost until\nhe finds it?\nAnd when he has found it, he lays it on\nhis shoulders, rejoicing.\nAnd when he comes home, he calls\ntogether his friends and neighbors,\nAnd when she has found it, she calls\nher friends and neighbors together,\nsaying, \"Rejoice with me, for I have\nfound the piece which I lost!'\nLikewise, I say to you, there is joy in\nthe presence of the angels of God over\none sinner who repents.\"\nThen He said: \"A certain man had two\nsons.\nAnd the younger of them said to his\nfather, \"Father, give me the portion of\ngoods that falls to me.' So he divided to\nthem his livelihood.\nAnd not many days after, the younger\nson gathered all together, journeyed to a\nfar country, and there wasted his\npossessions with prodigal living.\nBut when he had spent all, there arose\na severe famine in that land, and he\nbegan to be in want.\nThen he went and joined himself to a\ncitizen of that country, and he sent him\ninto his fields to feed swine.\nAnd he would gladly have filled his\nstomach with the pods that the swine\nate, and no one gave him anything.\nSo he called one of the servants and\nasked what these things meant.\n\"But when he came to himself, he said,\n\"How many of my father's hired servants\nhave bread enough and to spare, and I\nperish with hunger!\nAnd he said to him, \"Your brother has\ncome, and because he has received him\nsafe and sound, your father has killed\nthe fatted calf.'\nI will arise and go to my father, and will\nsay to him, \"Father, I have sinned\nagainst heaven and before you,\n\"But he was angry and would not go in.\nTherefore his father came out and\npleaded with him.\nand I am no longer worthy to be called\nyour son. Make me like one of your\nhired servants.\"'\n\"And he arose and came to his father.\nBut when he was still a great way off,\nhis father saw him and had compassion,\nand ran and fell on his neck and kissed\nhim.\nAnd the son said to him, \"Father, I\nhave sinned against heaven and in your\nsight, and am no longer worthy to be\ncalled your son.'\nSo he answered and said to his father,\n\"Lo, these many years I have been\nserving you; I never transgressed your\ncommandment at any time; and yet you\nnever gave me a young goat, that I\nmight make merry with my friends.\nBut as soon as this son of yours came,\nwho has devoured your livelihood with\nharlots, you killed the fatted calf for him.'\n\"And he said to him, \"Son, you are\nalways with me, and all that I have is\nyours.\n\"But the father said to his servants,\n\"Bring out the best robe and put it on\nhim, and put a ring on his hand and\nsandals on his feet.\nIt was right that we should make merry\nand be glad, for your brother was dead\nand is alive again, and was lost and is\nfound.\"'\n16He also said to His disciples:\n\"There was a certain rich man who had\na steward, and an accusation was\nbrought to him that this man was\nwasting his goods.\nAnd bring the fatted calf here and kill it,\nand let us eat and be merry;\nfor this my son was dead and is alive\nagain; he was lost and is found.' And\nthey began to be merry.\n\"Now his older son was in the field.\nAnd as he came and drew near to the\nhouse, he heard music and dancing.\nSo he called him and said to him,\n\"What is this I hear about you? Give an\naccount of your stewardship, for you can\nno longer be steward.'\n\"Then the steward said within himself,\n\"What shall I do? For my master is\ntaking the stewardship away from me. I\ncannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.\nAnd if you have not been faithful in\nwhat is another man's, who will give you\nwhat is your own?\nI have resolved what to do, that when I\nam put out of the stewardship, they may\nreceive me into their houses.'\n\"No servant can serve two masters; for\neither he will hate the one and love the\nother, or else he will be loyal to the one\nand despise the other. You cannot serve\nGod and mammon.\"\n\"So he called every one of his master's\ndebtors to him, and said to the first,\n\"How much do you owe my master?'\nNow the Pharisees, who were lovers\nof money, also heard all these things,\nand they derided Him.\nAnd he said, \"A hundred measures of\noil.' So he said to him, \"Take your bill,\nand sit down quickly and write fifty.'\nThen he said to another, \"And how\nmuch do you owe?' So he said, \"A\nhundred measures of wheat.' And he\nsaid to him, \"Take your bill, and write\neighty.'\nSo the master commended the unjust\nsteward because he had dealt shrewdly.\nFor the sons of this world are more\nshrewd in their generation than the sons\nof light.\nAnd He said to them, \"You are those\nwho justify yourselves before men, but\nGod knows your hearts. For what is\nhighly esteemed among men is an\nabomination in the sight of God.\n\"The law and the prophets were until\nJohn. Since that time the kingdom of\nGod has been preached, and everyone\nis pressing into it.\nAnd it is easier for heaven and earth to\npass away than for one tittle of the law\nto fail.\n\"And I say to you, make friends for\nyourselves by unrighteous mammon,\nthat when you fail, they may receive you\ninto an everlasting home.\n\"Whoever divorces his wife and\nmarries another commits adultery; and\nwhoever marries her who is divorced\nfrom her husband commits adultery.\nHe who is faithful in what is least is\nfaithful also in much; and he who is\nunjust in what is least is unjust also in\nmuch.\n\"There was a certain rich man who\nwas clothed in purple and fine linen and\nfared sumptuously every day.\nTherefore if you have not been faithful\nin the unrighteous mammon, who will\ncommit to your trust the true riches?\nBut there was a certain beggar named\nLazarus, full of sores, who was laid at\nhis gate,\ndesiring to be fed with the crumbs\nwhich fell from the rich man's table.\nMoreover the dogs came and licked his\nsores.\nAnd he said, \"No, father Abraham; but\nif one goes to them from the dead, they\nwill repent.'\nSo it was that the beggar died, and\nwas carried by the angels to Abraham's\nbosom. The rich man also died and was\nburied.\nAnd being in torments in Hades, he\nlifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar\noff, and Lazarus in his bosom.\n\"Then he cried and said, \"Father\nAbraham, have mercy on me, and send\nLazarus that he may dip the tip of his\nfinger in water and cool my tongue; for I\nam tormented in this flame.'\nBut Abraham said, \"Son, remember\nthat in your lifetime you received your\ngood things, and likewise Lazarus evil\nthings; but now he is comforted and you\nare tormented.\nAnd besides all this, between us and\nyou there is a great gulf fixed, so that\nthose who want to pass from here to\nyou cannot, nor can those from there\npass to us.'\n\"Then he said, \"I beg you therefore,\nfather, that you would send him to my\nfather's house,\nfor I have five brothers, that he may\ntestify to them, lest they also come to\nthis place of torment.'\nAbraham said to him, \"They have\nMoses and the prophets; let them hear\nthem.'\nBut he said to him, \"If they do not hear\nMoses and the prophets, neither will\nthey be persuaded though one rise from\nthe dead.\"'\n17Then He said to the disciples, \"It is\nimpossible that no offenses should\ncome, but woe to him through whom\nthey do come!\nIt would be better for him if a millstone\nwere hung around his neck, and he\nwere thrown into the sea, than that he\nshould offend one of these little ones.\nTake heed to yourselves. If your\nbrother sins against you, rebuke him;\nand if he repents, forgive him.\nAnd if he sins against you seven times\nin a day, and seven times in a day\nreturns to you, saying, \"I repent,' you\nshall forgive him.\"\nAnd the apostles said to the Lord,\n\"Increase our faith.\"\nSo the Lord said, \"If you have faith as a\nmustard seed, you can say to this\nmulberry tree, \"Be pulled up by the roots\nand be planted in the sea,' and it would\nobey you.\nAnd which of you, having a servant\nplowing or tending sheep, will say to him\nwhen he has come in from the field,\n\"Come at once and sit down to eat'?\nBut will he not rather say to him,\n\"Prepare something for my supper, and\ngird yourself and serve me till I have\neaten and drunk, and afterward you will\neat and drink'?\nDoes he thank that servant because he\ndid the things that were commanded\nhim? I think not.\nSo likewise you, when you have done\nall those things which you are\ncommanded, say, \"We are unprofitable\nservants. We have done what was our\nduty to do.\"'\nNow it happened as He went to\nJerusalem that He passed through the\nmidst of Samaria and Galilee.\nThen as He entered a certain village,\nthere met Him ten men who were lepers,\nwho stood afar off.\nAnd they lifted up their voices and said,\n\"Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!\"\nWere there not any found who\nreturned to give glory to God except this\nforeigner?\"\nAnd He said to him, \"Arise, go your\nway. Your faith has made you well.\"\nNow when He was asked by the\nPharisees when the kingdom of God\nwould come, He answered them and\nsaid, \"The kingdom of God does not\ncome with observation;\nnor will they say, \"See here!' or \"See\nthere!' For indeed, the kingdom of God\nis within you.\"\nThen He said to the disciples, \"The\ndays will come when you will desire to\nsee one of the days of the Son of Man,\nand you will not see it.\nAnd they will say to you, \"Look here!'\nor \"Look there!' Do not go after them or\nfollow them.\nSo when He saw them, He said to\nthem, \"Go, show yourselves to the\npriests.\" And so it was that as they went,\nthey were cleansed.\nFor as the lightning that flashes out of\none part under heaven shines to the\nother part under heaven, so also the\nSon of Man will be in His day.\nAnd one of them, when he saw that he\nwas healed, returned, and with a loud\nvoice glorified God,\nand fell down on his face at His feet,\ngiving Him thanks. And he was a\nSamaritan.\nSo Jesus answered and said, \"Were\nthere not ten cleansed? But where are\nthe nine?\nBut first He must suffer many things\nand be rejected by this generation.\nAnd as it was in the days of Noah, so it\nwill be also in the days of the Son of\nMan:\nThey ate, they drank, they married\nwives, they were given in marriage, until\nthe day that Noah entered the ark, and\nthe flood came and destroyed them all.\nLikewise as it was also in the days of\nLot: They ate, they drank, they bought,\nthey sold, they planted, they built;\nsaying: \"There was in a certain city a\njudge who did not fear God nor regard\nman.\nbut on the day that Lot went out of\nSodom it rained fire and brimstone from\nheaven and destroyed them all.\nNow there was a widow in that city; and\nshe came to him, saying, \"Get justice for\nme from my adversary.'\nEven so will it be in the day when the\nSon of Man is revealed.\n\"In that day, he who is on the housetop,\nand his goods are in the house, let him\nnot come down to take them away. And\nlikewise the one who is in the field, let\nhim not turn back.\nRemember Lot's wife.\nAnd he would not for a while; but\nafterward he said within himself,\n\"Though I do not fear God nor regard\nman,\nyet because this widow troubles me I\nwill avenge her, lest by her continual\ncoming she weary me.\"'\nThen the Lord said, \"Hear what the\nunjust judge said.\nWhoever seeks to save his life will\nlose it, and whoever loses his life will\npreserve it.\nAnd shall God not avenge His own\nelect who cry out day and night to Him,\nthough He bears long with them?\nI tell you, in that night there will be two\nmen in one bed: the one will be taken\nand the other will be left.\nTwo women will be grinding together:\nthe one will be taken and the other left.\nI tell you that He will avenge them\nspeedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of\nMan comes, will He really find faith on\nthe earth?\"\nTwo men will be in the field: the one\nwill be taken and the other left.\"\nAlso He spoke this parable to some\nwho trusted in themselves that they\nwere righteous, and despised others:\nAnd they answered and said to Him,\n\"Where, Lord?\" So He said to them,\n\"Wherever the body is, there the eagles\nwill be gathered together.\"\n18Then He spoke a parable to them,\nthat men always ought to pray and not\nlose heart,\n\"Two men went up to the temple to\npray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax\ncollector.\nThe Pharisee stood and prayed thus\nwith himself, \"God, I thank You that I am\nnot like other men--extortioners, unjust,\nadulterers, or even as this tax collector.\nI fast twice a week; I give tithes of all\nthat I possess.'\nAnd the tax collector, standing afar off,\nwould not so much as raise his eyes to\nheaven, but beat his breast, saying,\n\"God, be merciful to me a sinner!'\nSo when Jesus heard these things, He\nsaid to him, \"You still lack one thing. Sell\nall that you have and distribute to the\npoor, and you will have treasure in\nheaven; and come, follow Me.\"\nBut when he heard this, he became\nvery sorrowful, for he was very rich.\nI tell you, this man went down to his\nhouse justified rather than the other; for\neveryone who exalts himself will be\nhumbled, and he who humbles himself\nwill be exalted.\"\nAnd when Jesus saw that he became\nvery sorrowful, He said, \"How hard it is\nfor those who have riches to enter the\nkingdom of God!\nThen they also brought infants to Him\nthat He might touch them; but when the\ndisciples saw it, they rebuked them.\nFor it is easier for a camel to go\nthrough the eye of a needle than for a\nrich man to enter the kingdom of God.\"\nBut Jesus called them to Him and said,\n\"Let the little children come to Me, and\ndo not forbid them; for of such is the\nkingdom of God.\nAssuredly, I say to you, whoever does\nnot receive the kingdom of God as a\nlittle child will by no means enter it.\"\nNow a certain ruler asked Him, saying,\n\"Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit\neternal life?\"\nSo Jesus said to him, \"Why do you call\nMe good? No one is good but One, that\nis, God.\nAnd those who heard it said, \"Who\nthen can be saved?\"\nBut He said, \"The things which are\nimpossible with men are possible with\nGod.\"\nThen Peter said, \"See, we have left all\nand followed You.\"\nSo He said to them, \"Assuredly, I say\nto you, there is no one who has left\nhouse or parents or brothers or wife or\nchildren, for the sake of the kingdom of\nGod,\nYou know the commandments: \"Do\nnot commit adultery,' \"Do not murder,'\n\"Do not steal,' \"Do not bear false\nwitness,' \"Honor your father and your\nmother.\"'\nAnd he said, \"All these things I have\nkept from my youth.\"\nwho shall not receive many times\nmore in this present time, and in the age\nto come eternal life.\"\nThen He took the twelve aside and\nsaid to them, \"Behold, we are going up\nto Jerusalem, and all things that are\nwritten by the prophets concerning the\nSon of Man will be accomplished.\nFor He will be delivered to the Gentiles\nand will be mocked and insulted and spit\nupon.\nThey will scourge Him and kill Him.\nAnd the third day He will rise again.\"\nBut they understood none of these\nthings; this saying was hidden from\nthem, and they did not know the things\nwhich were spoken.\nThen it happened, as He was coming\nnear Jericho, that a certain blind man\nsat by the road begging.\nAnd hearing a multitude passing by,\nhe asked what it meant.\nSo they told him that Jesus of\nNazareth was passing by.\nall the people, when they saw it, gave\npraise to God.\n19Then Jesus entered and passed\nthrough Jericho.\nNow behold, there was a man named\nZacchaeus who was a chief tax collector,\nand he was rich.\nAnd he sought to see who Jesus was,\nbut could not because of the crowd, for\nhe was of short stature.\nSo he ran ahead and climbed up into a\nsycamore tree to see Him, for He was\ngoing to pass that way.\nAnd he cried out, saying, \"Jesus, Son\nof David, have mercy on me!\"\nAnd when Jesus came to the place, He\nlooked up and saw him, and said to him,\n\"Zacchaeus, make haste and come\ndown, for today I must stay at your\nhouse.\"\nThen those who went before warned\nhim that he should be quiet; but he cried\nout all the more, \"Son of David, have\nmercy on me!\"\nSo Jesus stood still and commanded\nhim to be brought to Him. And when he\nhad come near, He asked him,\nSo he made haste and came down,\nand received Him joyfully.\nBut when they saw it, they all\ncomplained, saying, \"He has gone to be\na guest with a man who is a sinner.\"\nsaying, \"What do you want Me to do\nfor you?\" He said, \"Lord, that I may\nreceive my sight.\"\nThen Zacchaeus stood and said to the\nLord, \"Look, Lord, I give half of my\ngoods to the poor; and if I have taken\nanything from anyone by false\naccusation, I restore fourfold.\"\nThen Jesus said to him, \"Receive your\nsight; your faith has made you well.\"\nAnd immediately he received his sight,\nand followed Him, glorifying God. And\nAnd Jesus said to him, \"Today\nsalvation has come to this house,\nbecause he also is a son of Abraham;\nfor the Son of Man has come to seek\nand to save that which was lost.\"\n\"Then another came, saying, \"Master,\nhere is your mina, which I have kept put\naway in a handkerchief.\nNow as they heard these things, He\nspoke another parable, because He was\nnear Jerusalem and because they\nthought the kingdom of God would\nappear immediately.\nFor I feared you, because you are an\naustere man. You collect what you did\nnot deposit, and reap what you did not\nsow.'\nTherefore He said: \"A certain\nnobleman went into a far country to\nreceive for himself a kingdom and to\nreturn.\nAnd he said to him, \"Out of your own\nmouth I will judge you, you wicked\nservant. You knew that I was an austere\nman, collecting what I did not deposit\nand reaping what I did not sow.\nSo he called ten of his servants,\ndelivered to them ten minas, and said to\nthem, \"Do business till I come.'\nWhy then did you not put my money in\nthe bank, that at my coming I might\nhave collected it with interest?'\nBut his citizens hated him, and sent a\ndelegation after him, saying, \"We will not\nhave this man to reign over us.'\n\"And he said to those who stood by,\n\"Take the mina from him, and give it to\nhim who has ten minas.'\n\"And so it was that when he returned,\nhaving received the kingdom, he then\ncommanded these servants, to whom\nhe had given the money, to be called to\nhim, that he might know how much\nevery man had gained by trading.\nThen came the first, saying, \"Master,\nyour mina has earned ten minas.'\n(But they said to him, \"Master, he has\nten minas.')\n\"For I say to you, that to everyone who\nhas will be given; and from him who\ndoes not have, even what he has will be\ntaken away from him.\nAnd he said to him, \"Well done, good\nservant; because you were faithful in a\nvery little, have authority over ten cities.'\nBut bring here those enemies of mine,\nwho did not want me to reign over them,\nand slay them before me.\"'\nAnd the second came, saying, \"Master,\nyour mina has earned five minas.'\nWhen He had said this, He went on\nahead, going up to Jerusalem.\nLikewise he said to him, \"You also be\nover five cities.'\nAnd it came to pass, when He drew\nnear to Bethphage and Bethany, at the\nmountain called Olivet, that He sent two\nof His disciples,\nsaying, \"Go into the village opposite\nyou, where as you enter you will find a\ncolt tied, on which no one has ever sat.\nLoose it and bring it here.\nBut He answered and said to them, \"I\ntell you that if these should keep silent,\nthe stones would immediately cry out.\"\nAnd if anyone asks you, \"Why are you\nloosing it?' thus you shall say to him,\n\"Because the Lord has need of it.\"'\nSo those who were sent went their\nway and found it just as He had said to\nthem.\nNow as He drew near, He saw the city\nand wept over it,\nsaying, \"If you had known, even you,\nespecially in this your day, the things\nthat make for your peace! But now they\nare hidden from your eyes.\nBut as they were loosing the colt, the\nowners of it said to them, \"Why are you\nloosing the colt?\"\nFor days will come upon you when\nyour enemies will build an embankment\naround you, surround you and close you\nin on every side,\nAnd they said, \"The Lord has need of\nhim.\"\nThen they brought him to Jesus. And\nthey threw their own clothes on the colt,\nand they set Jesus on him.\nand level you, and your children within\nyou, to the ground; and they will not\nleave in you one stone upon another,\nbecause you did not know the time of\nyour visitation.\"\nAnd as He went, many spread their\nclothes on the road.\nThen He went into the temple and\nbegan to drive out those who bought\nand sold in it,\nThen, as He was now drawing near\nthe descent of the Mount of Olives, the\nwhole multitude of the disciples began\nto rejoice and praise God with a loud\nvoice for all the mighty works they had\nseen,\nsaying: \"\"Blessed is the King who\ncomes in the name of the LORD!' Peace\nin heaven and glory in the highest!\"\nAnd some of the Pharisees called to\nHim from the crowd, \"Teacher, rebuke\nYour disciples.\"\nsaying to them, \"It is written, \"My\nhouse is a house of prayer,' but you\nhave made it a \"den of thieves.\"'\nAnd He was teaching daily in the\ntemple. But the chief priests, the scribes,\nand the leaders of the people sought to\ndestroy Him,\nand were unable to do anything; for all\nthe people were very attentive to hear\nHim.\n20Now it happened on one of those\ndays, as He taught the people in the\ntemple and preached the gospel, that\nthe chief priests and the scribes,\ntogether with the elders, confronted Him\nAgain he sent another servant; and\nthey beat him also, treated him\nshamefully, and sent him away emptyhanded.\nand spoke to Him, saying, \"Tell us, by\nwhat authority are You doing these\nthings? Or who is he who gave You this\nauthority?\"\nAnd again he sent a third; and they\nwounded him also and cast him out.\nBut He answered and said to them, \"I\nalso will ask you one thing, and answer\nMe:\n\"Then the owner of the vineyard said,\n\"What shall I do? I will send my beloved\nson. Probably they will respect him\nwhen they see him.'\nThe baptism of John--was it from\nheaven or from men?\"\nAnd they reasoned among themselves,\nsaying, \"If we say, \"From heaven,' He\nwill say, \"Why then did you not believe\nhim?'\nBut when the vinedressers saw him,\nthey reasoned among themselves,\nsaying, \"This is the heir. Come, let us kill\nhim, that the inheritance may be ours.'\nSo they cast him out of the vineyard\nand killed him. Therefore what will the\nowner of the vineyard do to them?\nBut if we say, \"From men,' all the\npeople will stone us, for they are\npersuaded that John was a prophet.\"\nSo they answered that they did not\nknow where it was from.\nHe will come and destroy those\nvinedressers and give the vineyard to\nothers.\" And when they heard it they\nsaid, \"Certainly not!\"\nAnd Jesus said to them, \"Neither will I\ntell you by what authority I do these\nthings.\"\nThen He looked at them and said,\n\"What then is this that is written: \"The\nstone which the builders rejected Has\nbecome the chief cornerstone'?\nThen He began to tell the people this\nparable: \"A certain man planted a\nvineyard, leased it to vinedressers, and\nwent into a far country for a long time.\nNow at vintage-time he sent a servant\nto the vinedressers, that they might give\nhim some of the fruit of the vineyard. But\nthe vinedressers beat him and sent him\naway empty-handed.\nWhoever falls on that stone will be\nbroken; but on whomever it falls, it will\ngrind him to powder.\"\nAnd the chief priests and the scribes\nthat very hour sought to lay hands on\nHim, but they feared the people --for\nthey knew He had spoken this parable\nagainst them.\nSo they watched Him, and sent spies\nwho pretended to be righteous, that they\nmight seize on His words, in order to\ndeliver Him to the power and the\nauthority of the governor.\nThen they asked Him, saying,\n\"Teacher, we know that You say and\nteach rightly, and You do not show\npersonal favoritism, but teach the way of\nGod in truth:\nNow there were seven brothers. And\nthe first took a wife, and died without\nchildren.\nAnd the second took her as wife, and\nhe died childless.\nThen the third took her, and in like\nmanner the seven also; and they left no\nchildren, and died.\nIs it lawful for us to pay taxes to\nCaesar or not?\"\nBut He perceived their craftiness, and\nsaid to them, \"Why do you test Me?\nLast of all the woman died also.\nTherefore, in the resurrection, whose\nwife does she become? For all seven\nhad her as wife.\"\nShow Me a denarius. Whose image\nand inscription does it have?\" They\nanswered and said, \"Caesar's.\"\nJesus answered and said to them,\n\"The sons of this age marry and are\ngiven in marriage.\nAnd He said to them, \"Render\ntherefore to Caesar the things that are\nCaesar's, and to God the things that are\nGod's.\"\nBut those who are counted worthy to\nattain that age, and the resurrection\nfrom the dead, neither marry nor are\ngiven in marriage;\nBut they could not catch Him in His\nwords in the presence of the people.\nAnd they marveled at His answer and\nkept silent.\nnor can they die anymore, for they are\nequal to the angels and are sons of God,\nbeing sons of the resurrection.\nThen some of the Sadducees, who\ndeny that there is a resurrection, came\nto Him and asked Him,\nBut even Moses showed in the burning\nbush passage that the dead are raised,\nwhen he called the Lord \"the God of\nAbraham, the God of Isaac, and the\nGod of Jacob.'\nsaying: \"Teacher, Moses wrote to us\nthat if a man's brother dies, having a\nwife, and he dies without children, his\nbrother should take his wife and raise up\noffspring for his brother.\nFor He is not the God of the dead but\nof the living, for all live to Him.\"\nThen some of the scribes answered\nand said, \"Teacher, You have spoken\nwell.\"\nBut after that they dared not question\nHim anymore.\nout of her poverty put in all the livelihood\nthat she had.\"\nAnd He said to them, \"How can they\nsay that the Christ is the Son of David?\nThen, as some spoke of the temple,\nhow it was adorned with beautiful stones\nand donations, He said,\nNow David himself said in the Book of\nPsalms: \"The LORD said to my Lord,\n\"Sit at My right hand,\nTill I make\nfootstool.\"'\nYour\nenemies\nYour\nTherefore David calls Him \"Lord'; how\nis He then his Son?\"\n\"These things which you see--the days\nwill come in which not one stone shall\nbe left upon another that shall not be\nthrown down.\"\nSo they asked Him, saying, \"Teacher,\nbut when will these things be? And what\nsign will there be when these things are\nabout to take place?\"\nThen, in the hearing of all the people,\nHe said to His disciples,\n\"Beware of the scribes, who desire to\ngo around in long robes, love greetings\nin the marketplaces, the best seats in\nthe synagogues, and the best places at\nfeasts,\nwho devour widows' houses, and for a\npretense make long prayers. These will\nreceive greater condemnation.\"\n21And He looked up and saw the\nrich putting their gifts into the treasury,\nAnd He said: \"Take heed that you not\nbe deceived. For many will come in My\nname, saying, \"I am He,' and, \"The time\nhas drawn near.' Therefore do not go\nafter them.\nBut when you hear of wars and\ncommotions, do not be terrified; for\nthese things must come to pass first, but\nthe end will not come immediately.\"\nThen He said to them, \"Nation will rise\nagainst nation, and kingdom against\nkingdom.\nand He saw also a certain poor widow\nputting in two mites.\nAnd there will be great earthquakes in\nvarious places, and famines and\npestilences; and there will be fearful\nsights and great signs from heaven.\nSo He said, \"Truly I say to you that this\npoor widow has put in more than all;\nfor all these out of their abundance\nhave put in offerings for God, but she\nBut before all these things, they will lay\ntheir hands on you and persecute you,\ndelivering you up to the synagogues and\nprisons.

And Jerusalem will be trampled\nby Gentiles until the times of the\nGentiles are fulfilled.\nfor I will give you a mouth and wisdom\nwhich all your adversaries will not be\nable to contradict or resist.\n\"And there will be signs in the sun, in\nthe moon, and in the stars; and on the\nearth distress of nations, with perplexity,\nthe sea and the waves roaring;\nYou will be betrayed even by parents\nand brothers, relatives and friends; and\nthey will put some of you to death.\nmen's hearts failing them from fear\nand the expectation of those things\nwhich are coming on the earth, for the\npowers of the heavens will be shaken.\nAnd you will be hated by all for My\nname's sake.\nBut not a hair of your head shall be\nlost.\nBy your patience possess your souls.\n\"But when you see Jerusalem\nsurrounded by armies, then know that\nits desolation is near.\nThen let those who are in Judea flee to\nthe mountains, let those who are in the\nmidst of her depart, and let not those\nwho are in the country enter her.\nFor these are the days of vengeance,\nthat all things which are written may be\nfulfilled.\nBut woe to those who are pregnant\nand to those who are nursing babies in\nthose days! For there will be great\ndistress in the land and wrath upon this\npeople.\nThen they will see the Son of Man\ncoming in a cloud with power and great\nglory.\nNow when these things begin to\nhappen, look up and lift up your heads,\nbecause your redemption draws near.\"\nThen He spoke to them a parable:\n\"Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.\nWhen they are already budding, you\nsee and know for yourselves that\nsummer is now near.\nSo you also, when you see these\nthings happening, know that the\nkingdom of God is near.\nAssuredly, I say to you, this generation\nwill by no means pass away till all things\ntake place.\nHeaven and earth will pass away, but\nMy words will by no means pass away.\n\"But take heed to yourselves, lest your\nhearts be weighed down with carousing,\ndrunkenness, and cares of this life, and\nthat Day come on you unexpectedly.\nSo he promised and sought opportunity\nto betray Him to them in the absence of\nthe multitude.\nFor it will come as a snare on all those\nwho dwell on the face of the whole earth.\nThen came the Day of Unleavened\nBread, when the Passover must be\nkilled.\nWatch therefore, and pray always that\nyou may be counted worthy to escape\nall these things that will come to pass,\nand to stand before the Son of Man.\"\nAnd He sent Peter and John, saying,\n\"Go and prepare the Passover for us,\nthat we may eat.\"\nAnd in the daytime He was teaching in\nthe temple, but at night He went out and\nstayed on the mountain called Olivet.\nThen early in the morning all the\npeople came to Him in the temple to\nhear Him.\n22Now the Feast of Unleavened\nBread drew near, which is called\nPassover.\nAnd the chief priests and the scribes\nsought how they might kill Him, for they\nfeared the people.\nThen Satan entered Judas, surnamed\nIscariot, who was numbered among the\ntwelve.\nSo he went his way and conferred with\nthe chief priests and captains, how he\nmight betray Him to them.\nAnd they were glad, and agreed to give\nhim money.\nSo they said to Him, \"Where do You\nwant us to prepare?\"\nAnd He said to them, \"Behold, when\nyou have entered the city, a man will\nmeet you carrying a pitcher of water;\nfollow him into the house which he\nenters.\nThen you shall say to the master of the\nhouse, \"The Teacher says to you,\n\"Where is the guest room where I may\neat the Passover with My disciples?\"'\nThen he will show you a large,\nfurnished upper room; there make\nready.\"\nSo they went and found it just as He\nhad said to them, and they prepared the\nPassover.\nWhen the hour had come, He sat\ndown, and the twelve apostles with Him.\nThen He said to them, \"With fervent\ndesire I have desired to eat this\nPassover with you before I suffer;\nfor I say to you, I will no longer eat of it\nuntil it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.\"\nThen He took the cup, and gave\nthanks, and said, \"Take this and divide it\namong yourselves;\nFor who is greater, he who sits at the\ntable, or he who serves? Is it not he who\nsits at the table? Yet I am among you as\nthe One who serves.\nfor I say to you, I will not drink of the\nfruit of the vine until the kingdom of God\ncomes.\"\n\"But you are those who\ncontinued with Me in My trials.\nAnd He took bread, gave thanks and\nbroke it, and gave it to them, saying,\n\"This is My body which is given for you;\ndo this in remembrance of Me.\"\nLikewise He also took the cup after\nsupper, saying, \"This cup is the new\ncovenant in My blood, which is shed for\nyou.\nBut behold, the hand of My betrayer is\nwith Me on the table.\nAnd truly the Son of Man goes as it\nhas been determined, but woe to that\nman by whom He is betrayed!\"\nhave\nAnd I bestow upon you a kingdom, just\nas My Father bestowed one upon Me,\nthat you may eat and drink at My table\nin My kingdom, and sit on thrones\njudging the twelve tribes of Israel.\"\nAnd the Lord said, \"Simon, Simon!\nIndeed, Satan has asked for you, that\nhe may sift you as wheat.\nBut I have prayed for you, that your\nfaith should not fail; and when you have\nreturned to Me, strengthen your\nbrethren.\"\nThen they began to question among\nthemselves, which of them it was who\nwould do this thing.\nBut he said to Him, \"Lord, I am ready\nto go with You, both to prison and to\ndeath.\"\nNow there was also a dispute among\nthem, as to which of them should be\nconsidered the greatest.\nThen He said, \"I tell you, Peter, the\nrooster shall not crow this day before\nyou will deny three times that you know\nMe.\"\nAnd He said to them, \"The kings of the\nGentiles exercise lordship over them,\nand those who exercise authority over\nthem are called \"benefactors.'\nAnd He said to them, \"When I sent you\nwithout money bag, knapsack, and\nsandals, did you lack anything?\" So they\nsaid, \"Nothing.\"\nBut not so among you; on the contrary,\nhe who is greatest among you, let him\nbe as the younger, and he who governs\nas he who serves.\nThen He said to them, \"But now, he\nwho has a money bag, let him take it,\nand likewise a knapsack; and he who\nhas no sword, let him sell his garment\nand buy one.\nFor I say to you that this which is\nwritten must still be accomplished in Me:\n\"And He was numbered with the\ntransgressors.'\nFor\nthe\nthings\nconcerning Me have an end.\"\nSo they said, \"Lord, look, here are two\nswords.\" And He said to them, \"It is\nenough.\"\nAnd while He was still speaking,\nbehold, a multitude; and he who was\ncalled Judas, one of the twelve, went\nbefore them and drew near to Jesus to\nkiss Him.\nBut Jesus said to him, \"Judas, are you\nbetraying the Son of Man with a kiss?\"\nComing out, He went to the Mount of\nOlives, as He was accustomed, and His\ndisciples also followed Him.\nWhen those around Him saw what\nwas going to happen, they said to Him,\n\"Lord, shall we strike with the sword?\"\nWhen He came to the place, He said\nto them, \"Pray that you may not enter\ninto temptation.\"\nAnd He was withdrawn from them\nabout a stone's throw, and He knelt\ndown and prayed,\nAnd one of them struck the servant of\nthe high priest and cut off his right ear.\nBut Jesus answered and said, \"Permit\neven this.\" And He touched his ear and\nhealed him.\nsaying, \"Father, if it is Your will, take\nthis cup away from Me; nevertheless not\nMy will, but Yours, be done.\"\nThen Jesus said to the chief priests,\ncaptains of the temple, and the elders\nwho had come to Him, \"Have you come\nout, as against a robber, with swords\nand clubs?\nThen an angel appeared to Him from\nheaven, strengthening Him.\nAnd being in agony, He prayed more\nearnestly. Then His sweat became like\ngreat drops of blood falling down to the\nground.\nWhen I was with you daily in the\ntemple, you did not try to seize Me. But\nthis is your hour, and the power of\ndarkness.\"\nHaving arrested Him, they led Him and\nbrought Him into the high priest's house.\nBut Peter followed at a distance.\nWhen He rose up from prayer, and\nhad come to His disciples, He found\nthem sleeping from sorrow.\nNow when they had kindled a fire in\nthe midst of the courtyard and sat down\ntogether, Peter sat among them.\nThen He said to them, \"Why do you\nsleep? Rise and pray, lest you enter into\ntemptation.\"\nAnd a certain servant girl, seeing him\nas he sat by the fire, looked intently at\nhim and said, \"This man was also with\nHim.\"\nBut he denied Him, saying, \"Woman, I\ndo not know Him.\"\n\"If You are the Christ, tell us.\" But He\nsaid to them, \"If I tell you, you will by no\nmeans believe.\nAnd after a little while another saw him\nand said, \"You also are of them.\" But\nPeter said, \"Man, I am not!\"\nAnd if I also ask you, you will by no\nmeans answer Me or let Me go.\nThen after about an hour had passed,\nanother confidently affirmed, saying,\n\"Surely this fellow also was with Him, for\nhe is a Galilean.\"\nBut Peter said, \"Man, I do not know\nwhat you are saying!\" Immediately,\nwhile he was still speaking, the rooster\ncrowed.\nAnd the Lord turned and looked at\nPeter. Then Peter remembered the word\nof the Lord, how He had said to him,\n\"Before the rooster crows, you will deny\nMe three times.\"\nSo Peter went out and wept bitterly.\nNow the men who held Jesus mocked\nHim and beat Him.\nAnd having blindfolded Him, they\nstruck Him on the face and asked Him,\nsaying, \"Prophesy! Who is the one who\nstruck You?\"\nAnd\nmany\nother\nthings\nthey\nblasphemously spoke against Him.\nAs soon as it was day, the elders of\nthe people, both chief priests and\nscribes, came together and led Him into\ntheir council, saying,\nHereafter the Son of Man will sit on the\nright hand of the power of God.\"\nThen they all said, \"Are You then the\nSon of God?\" So He said to them, \"You\nrightly say that I am.\"\nAnd they said, \"What further testimony\ndo we need? For we have heard it\nourselves from His own mouth.\"\n23Then the whole multitude of them\narose and led Him to Pilate.\nAnd they began to accuse Him, saying,\n\"We found this fellow perverting the\nnation, and forbidding to pay taxes to\nCaesar, saying that He Himself is Christ,\na King.\"\nThen Pilate asked Him, saying, \"Are\nYou the King of the Jews?\" He\nanswered him and said, \"It is as you\nsay.\"\nSo Pilate said to the chief priests and\nthe crowd, \"I find no fault in this Man.\"\nBut they were the more fierce, saying,\n\"He stirs up the people, teaching\nthroughout all Judea, beginning from\nGalilee to this place.\"\nWhen Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked\nif the Man were a Galilean.\ndeserving of death has been done by\nHim.\nAnd as soon as he knew that He\nbelonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent\nHim to Herod, who was also in\nJerusalem at that time.\nNow when Herod saw Jesus, he was\nexceedingly glad; for he had desired for\na long time to see Him, because he had\nheard many things about Him, and he\nhoped to see some miracle done by Him.\nI will therefore chastise Him and\nrelease Him\"\n(for it was necessary for him to release\none to them at the feast).\nAnd they all cried out at once, saying,\n\"Away with this Man, and release to us\nBarabbas\"-19\nThen he questioned Him with many\nwords, but He answered him nothing.\nwho had been thrown into prison for a\ncertain rebellion made in the city, and\nfor murder.\nAnd the chief priests and scribes stood\nand vehemently accused Him.\nPilate, therefore, wishing to release\nJesus, again called out to them.\nThen Herod, with his men of war,\ntreated Him with contempt and mocked\nHim, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe,\nand sent Him back to Pilate.\nThat very day Pilate and Herod\nbecame friends with each other, for\npreviously they had been at enmity with\neach other.\nThen Pilate, when he had called\ntogether the chief priests, the rulers, and\nthe people,\nBut they shouted, saying, \"Crucify Him,\ncrucify Him!\"\nThen he said to them the third time,\n\"Why, what evil has He done? I have\nfound no reason for death in Him. I will\ntherefore chastise Him and let Him go.\"\nBut they were insistent, demanding\nwith loud voices that He be crucified.\nAnd the voices of these men and of the\nchief priests prevailed.\nsaid to them, \"You have brought this\nMan to me, as one who misleads the\npeople. And indeed, having examined\nHim in your presence, I have found no\nfault in this Man concerning those things\nof which you accuse Him;\nno, neither did Herod, for I sent you\nback to him; and indeed nothing\nSo Pilate gave sentence that it should\nbe as they requested.\nAnd he released to them the one they\nrequested, who for rebellion and murder\nhad been thrown into prison; but he\ndelivered Jesus to their will.\nNow as they led Him away, they laid\nhold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian,\nwho was coming from the country, and\non him they laid the cross that he might\nbear it after Jesus.\nThe soldiers also mocked Him, coming\nand offering Him sour wine,\nAnd a great multitude of the people\nfollowed Him, and women who also\nmourned and lamented Him.\nBut Jesus, turning to them, said,\n\"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep\nfor Me, but weep for yourselves and for\nyour children.\nFor indeed the days are coming in\nwhich they will say, \"Blessed are the\nbarren, wombs that never bore, and\nbreasts which never nursed!'\nThen they will begin \"to say to the\nmountains, \"Fall on us!\" and to the hills,\n\"Cover us!\"'\nand saying, \"If You are the King of the\nJews, save Yourself.\"\nAnd an inscription also was written\nover Him in letters of Greek, Latin, and\nHebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE\nJEWS.\nThen one of the criminals who were\nhanged blasphemed Him, saying, \"If\nYou are the Christ, save Yourself and\nus.\"\nBut the other, answering, rebuked him,\nsaying, \"Do you not even fear God,\nseeing you are under the same\ncondemnation?\nFor if they do these things in the green\nwood, what will be done in the dry?\"\nAnd we indeed justly, for we receive\nthe due reward of our deeds; but this\nMan has done nothing wrong.\"\nThere were also two others, criminals,\nled with Him to be put to death.\nThen he said to Jesus, \"Lord,\nremember me when You come into Your\nkingdom.\"\nAnd when they had come to the place\ncalled Calvary, there they crucified Him,\nand the criminals, one on the right hand\nand the other on the left.\nAnd Jesus said to him, \"Assuredly, I\nsay to you, today you will be with Me in\nParadise.\"\nThen Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them,\nfor they do not know what they do.\" And\nthey divided His garments and cast lots.\nNow it was about the sixth hour, and\nthere was darkness over all the earth\nuntil the ninth hour.\nAnd the people stood looking on. But\neven the rulers with them sneered,\nsaying, \"He saved others; let Him save\nHimself if He is the Christ, the chosen of\nGod.\"\nThen the sun was darkened, and the\nveil of the temple was torn in two.\nAnd when Jesus had cried out with a\nloud voice, He said, \"Father, \"into Your\nhands I commit My spirit.\"' Having said\nthis, He breathed His last.\nSo when the centurion saw what had\nhappened, he glorified God, saying,\n\"Certainly this was a righteous Man!\"\nThen they returned and prepared\nspices and fragrant oils. And they rested\non the Sabbath according to the\ncommandment.\n24Now on the first day of the week,\nAnd the whole crowd who came\ntogether to that sight, seeing what had\nbeen done, beat their breasts and\nreturned.\nvery early in the morning, they, and\ncertain other women with them, came to\nthe tomb bringing the spices which they\nhad prepared.\nBut all His acquaintances, and the\nwomen who followed Him from Galilee,\nstood at a distance, watching these\nthings.\nNow behold, there was a man named\nJoseph, a council member, a good and\njust man.\nHe had not consented to their decision\nand deed. He was from Arimathea, a\ncity of the Jews, who himself was also\nwaiting for the kingdom of God.\nThis man went to Pilate and asked for\nthe body of Jesus.\nThen he took it down, wrapped it in\nlinen, and laid it in a tomb that was\nhewn out of the rock, where no one had\never lain before.\nThat day was the Preparation, and the\nSabbath drew near.\nBut they found the stone rolled away\nfrom the tomb.\nThen they went in and did not find the\nbody of the Lord Jesus.\nAnd it happened, as they were greatly\nperplexed about this, that behold, two\nmen stood by them in shining garments.\nThen, as they were afraid and bowed\ntheir faces to the earth, they said to\nthem, \"Why do you seek the living\namong the dead?\nHe is not here, but is risen! Remember\nhow He spoke to you when He was still\nin Galilee,\nsaying, \"The Son of Man must be\ndelivered into the hands of sinful men,\nand be crucified, and the third day rise\nagain.\"'\nAnd the women who had come with\nHim from Galilee followed after, and\nthey observed the tomb and how His\nbody was laid.\nAnd they remembered His words.\nThen they returned from the tomb and\ntold all these things to the eleven and to\nall the rest.\nIt was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary\nthe mother of James, and the other\nwomen with them, who told these things\nto the apostles.\nAnd their words seemed to them like\nidle tales, and they did not believe them.\na Prophet mighty in deed and word\nbefore God and all the people,\nand how the chief priests and our\nrulers delivered Him to be condemned\nto death, and crucified Him.\nBut Peter arose and ran to the tomb;\nand stooping down, he saw the linen\ncloths lying by themselves; and he\ndeparted, marveling to himself at what\nhad happened.\nNow behold, two of them were\ntraveling that same day to a village\ncalled Emmaus, which was seven miles\nfrom Jerusalem.\nAnd they talked together of all these\nthings which had happened.\nSo it was, while they conversed and\nreasoned, that Jesus Himself drew near\nand went with them.\nBut we were hoping that it was He who\nwas going to redeem Israel. Indeed,\nbesides all this, today is the third day\nsince these things happened.\nYes, and certain women of our\ncompany, who arrived at the tomb early,\nastonished us.\nWhen they did not find His body, they\ncame saying that they had also seen a\nvision of angels who said He was alive.\nAnd certain of those who were with us\nwent to the tomb and found it just as the\nwomen had said; but Him they did not\nsee.\"\nBut their eyes were restrained, so that\nthey did not know Him.\nThen He said to them, \"O foolish ones,\nand slow of heart to believe in all that\nthe prophets have spoken!\nAnd He said to them, \"What kind of\nconversation is this that you have with\none another as you walk and are sad?\"\nOught not the Christ to have suffered\nthese things and to enter into His glory?\"\nThen the one whose name was\nCleopas answered and said to Him, \"Are\nYou the only stranger in Jerusalem, and\nhave You not known the things which\nhappened there in these days?\"\nAnd He said to them, \"What things?\"\nSo they said to Him, \"The things\nconcerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was\nAnd beginning at Moses and all the\nProphets, He expounded to them in all\nthe Scriptures the things concerning\nHimself.\nThen they drew near to the village\nwhere they were going, and He\nindicated that He would have gone\nfarther.\nBut they constrained Him, saying,\n\"Abide with us, for it is toward evening,\nand the day is far spent.\" And He went\nin to stay with them.\nBehold My hands and My feet, that it is\nI Myself. Handle Me and see, for a spirit\ndoes not have flesh and bones as you\nsee I have.\"\nNow it came to pass, as He sat at the\ntable with them, that He took bread,\nblessed and broke it, and gave it to\nthem.\nThen their eyes were opened and they\nknew Him; and He vanished from their\nsight.\nAnd they said to one another, \"Did not\nour heart burn within us while He talked\nwith us on the road, and while He\nopened the Scriptures to us?\"\nWhen He had said this, He showed\nthem His hands and His feet.\nBut while they still did not believe for\njoy, and marveled, He said to them,\n\"Have you any food here?\"\nSo they gave Him a piece of a broiled\nfish and some honeycomb.\nAnd He took it and ate in their\npresence.\nSo they rose up that very hour and\nreturned to Jerusalem, and found the\neleven and those who were with them\ngathered together,\nsaying, \"The Lord is risen indeed, and\nhas appeared to Simon!\"\nAnd they told about the things that had\nhappened on the road, and how He was\nknown to them in the breaking of bread.\nNow as they said these things, Jesus\nHimself stood in the midst of them, and\nsaid to them, \"Peace to you.\"\nThen He said to them, \"These are the\nwords which I spoke to you while I was\nstill with you, that all things must be\nfulfilled which were written in the Law of\nMoses and the Prophets and the\nPsalms concerning Me.\"\nAnd He opened their understanding,\nthat they might comprehend the\nScriptures.\nThen He said to them, \"Thus it is\nwritten, and thus it was necessary for\nthe Christ to suffer and to rise from the\ndead the third day,\nBut they were terrified and frightened,\nand supposed they had seen a spirit.\nand that repentance and remission of\nsins should be preached in His name to\nall nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\nAnd He said to them, \"Why are you\ntroubled? And why do doubts arise in\nyour hearts?\nAnd you are witnesses of these things.\nBehold, I send the Promise of My\nFather upon you; but tarry in the city of\nJerusalem until you are endued with\npower from on high.\"\nAnd they worshiped Him, and returned\nto Jerusalem with great joy,\nAnd He led them out as far as Bethany,\nand He lifted up His hands and blessed\nthem.\nNow it came to pass, while He blessed\nthem, that He was parted from them and\ncarried up into heaven.\nand were continually in the temple\npraising and blessing God. Amen.\nJohn\n1In the beginning was the Word, and\nthe Word was with God, and the Word\nwas God.\nHe was in the beginning with God.\nAll things were made through Him, and\nwithout Him nothing was made that was\nmade.\nIn Him was life, and the life was the\nlight of men.\nAnd the light shines in the darkness,\nand the darkness did not comprehend it.\nBut as many as received Him, to them\nHe gave the right to become children of\nGod, to those who believe in His name:\nwho were born, not of blood, nor of the\nwill of the flesh, nor of the will of man,\nbut of God.\nAnd the Word became flesh and dwelt\namong us, and we beheld His glory, the\nglory as of the only begotten of the\nFather, full of grace and truth.\nJohn bore witness of Him and cried\nout, saying, \"This was He of whom I said,\n\"He who comes after me is preferred\nbefore me, for He was before me.\"'\nThere was a man sent from God,\nwhose name was John.\nAnd of His fullness we have all\nreceived, and grace for grace.\nThis man came for a witness, to bear\nwitness of the Light, that all through him\nmight believe.\nFor the law was given through Moses,\nbut grace and truth came through Jesus\nChrist.\nHe was not that Light, but was sent to\nbear witness of that Light.\nNo one has seen God at any time. The\nonly begotten Son, who is in the bosom\nof the Father, He has declared Him.\nThat was the true Light which gives\nlight to every man coming into the world.\nHe was in the world, and the world\nwas made through Him, and the world\ndid not know Him.\nHe came to His own, and His own did\nnot receive Him.\nNow this is the testimony of John,\nwhen the Jews sent priests and Levites\nfrom Jerusalem to ask him, \"Who are\nyou?\"\nHe confessed, and did not deny, but\nconfessed, \"I am not the Christ.\"\nAnd they asked him, \"What then? Are\nyou Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.\" \"Are\nyou the Prophet?\" And he answered,\n\"No.\"\nI did not know Him; but that He should\nbe revealed to Israel, therefore I came\nbaptizing with water.\"\nThen they said to him, \"Who are you,\nthat we may give an answer to those\nwho sent us? What do you say about\nyourself?\"\nAnd John bore witness, saying, \"I saw\nthe Spirit descending from heaven like a\ndove, and He remained upon Him.\nHe said: \"I am \"The voice of one crying\nin the wilderness: \"Make straight the\nway of the LORD,\"' as the prophet\nIsaiah said.\"\nI did not know Him, but He who sent\nme to baptize with water said to me,\n\"Upon whom you see the Spirit\ndescending, and remaining on Him, this\nis He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'\nNow those who were sent were from\nthe Pharisees.\nAnd I have seen and testified that this\nis the Son of God.\"\nAnd they asked him, saying, \"Why\nthen do you baptize if you are not the\nChrist, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\"\nAgain, the next day, John stood with\ntwo of his disciples.\nJohn answered them, saying, \"I\nbaptize with water, but there stands One\namong you whom you do not know.\nAnd looking at Jesus as He walked, he\nsaid, \"Behold the Lamb of God!\"\nIt is He who, coming after me, is\npreferred before me, whose sandal\nstrap I am not worthy to loose.\"\nThe two disciples heard him speak,\nand they followed Jesus.\nThese things were done in Bethabara\nbeyond the Jordan, where John was\nbaptizing.\nThen Jesus turned, and seeing them\nfollowing, said to them, \"What do you\nseek?\" They said to Him, \"Rabbi\" (which\nis to say, when translated, Teacher),\n\"where are You staying?\"\nThe next day John saw Jesus coming\ntoward him, and said, \"Behold! The\nLamb of God who takes away the sin of\nthe world!\nHe said to them, \"Come and see.\"\nThey came and saw where He was\nstaying, and remained with Him that day\n(now it was about the tenth hour).\nThis is He of whom I said, \"After me\ncomes a Man who is preferred before\nme, for He was before me.'\nOne of the two who heard John speak,\nand followed Him, was Andrew, Simon\nPeter's brother.\nHe first found his own brother Simon,\nand said to him, \"We have found the\nMessiah\"\nChrist).\n(which\nis\ntranslated,\nthe\nAnd he brought him to Jesus. Now\nwhen Jesus looked at him, He said,\n\"You are Simon the son of Jonah. You\nshall be called Cephas\" (which is\ntranslated, A Stone).\nThe following day Jesus wanted to go\nto Galilee, and He found Philip and said\nto him, \"Follow Me.\"\nNow Philip was from Bethsaida, the\ncity of Andrew and Peter.\nPhilip found Nathanael and said to him,\n\"We have found Him of whom Moses in\nthe law, and also the prophets, wrote-Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\"\nAnd Nathanael said to him, \"Can\nanything good come out of Nazareth?\"\nPhilip said to him, \"Come and see.\"\nJesus saw Nathanael coming toward\nHim, and said of him, \"Behold, an\nIsraelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!\"\nNathanael said to Him, \"How do You\nknow me?\" Jesus answered and said to\nhim, \"Before Philip called you, when you\nwere under the fig tree, I saw you.\"\nNathanael answered and said to Him,\n\"Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You\nare the King of Israel!\"\nJesus answered and said to him,\n\"Because I said to you, \"I saw you under\nthe fig tree,' do you believe? You will\nsee greater things than these.\"\nAnd He said to him, \"Most assuredly, I\nsay to you, hereafter you shall see\nheaven open, and the angels of God\nascending and descending upon the\nSon of Man.\"\n2On the third day there was a wedding\nin Cana of Galilee, and the mother of\nJesus was there.\nNow both Jesus and His disciples were\ninvited to the wedding.\nAnd when they ran out of wine, the\nmother of Jesus said to Him, \"They have\nno wine.\"\nJesus said to her, \"Woman, what does\nyour concern have to do with Me? My\nhour has not yet come.\"\nHis mother said to the servants,\n\"Whatever He says to you, do it.\"\nNow there were set there six waterpots\nof stone, according to the manner of\npurification of the Jews, containing\ntwenty or thirty gallons apiece.\nJesus said to them, \"Fill the waterpots\nwith water.\" And they filled them up to\nthe brim.\nAnd He said to them, \"Draw some out\nnow, and take it to the master of the\nfeast.\" And they took it.\nWhen the master of the feast had\ntasted the water that was made wine,\nand did not know where it came from\n(but the servants who had drawn the\nwater knew), the master of the feast\ncalled the bridegroom.\nJesus answered and said to them,\n\"Destroy this temple, and in three days I\nwill raise it up.\"\nAnd he said to him, \"Every man at the\nbeginning sets out the good wine, and\nwhen the guests have well drunk, then\nthe inferior. You have kept the good\nwine until now!\"\nThen the Jews said, \"It has taken fortysix years to build this temple, and will\nYou raise it up in three days?\"\nThis beginning of signs Jesus did in\nCana of Galilee, and manifested His\nglory; and His disciples believed in Him.\nAfter this He went down to Capernaum,\nHe, His mother, His brothers, and His\ndisciples; and they did not stay there\nmany days.\nBut He was speaking of the temple of\nHis body.\nTherefore, when He had risen from the\ndead, His disciples remembered that He\nhad said this to them; and they believed\nthe Scripture and the word which Jesus\nhad said.\nNow the Passover of the Jews was at\nhand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.\nNow when He was in Jerusalem at the\nPassover, during the feast, many\nbelieved in His name when they saw the\nsigns which He did.\nAnd He found in the temple those who\nsold oxen and sheep and doves, and\nthe money changers doing business.\nBut Jesus did not commit Himself to\nthem, because He knew all men,\nWhen He had made a whip of cords,\nHe drove them all out of the temple, with\nthe sheep and the oxen, and poured out\nthe changers' money and overturned the\ntables.\nAnd He said to those who sold doves,\n\"Take these things away! Do not make\nMy Father's house a house of\nmerchandise!\"\nThen His disciples remembered that it\nwas written, \"Zeal for Your house has\neaten Me up.\"\nSo the Jews answered and said to\nHim, \"What sign do You show to us,\nsince You do these things?\"\nand had no need that anyone should\ntestify of man, for He knew what was in\nman.\n3There was a man of the Pharisees\nnamed Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.\nThis man came to Jesus by night and\nsaid to Him, \"Rabbi, we know that You\nare a teacher come from God; for no\none can do these signs that You do\nunless God is with him.\"\nJesus answered and said to him, \"Most\nassuredly, I say to you, unless one is\nborn again, he cannot see the kingdom\nof God.\"\nNicodemus said to Him, \"How can a\nman be born when he is old? Can he\nenter a second time into his mother's\nwomb and be born?\"\nAnd as Moses lifted up the serpent in\nthe wilderness, even so must the Son of\nMan be lifted up,\nJesus answered, \"Most assuredly, I say\nto you, unless one is born of water and\nthe Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom\nof God.\nThat which is born of the flesh is flesh,\nand that which is born of the Spirit is\nspirit.\nDo not marvel that I said to you, \"You\nmust be born again.'\nthat whoever believes in Him should\nnot perish but have eternal life.\nFor God so loved the world that He\ngave His only begotten Son, that\nwhoever believes in Him should not\nperish but have everlasting life.\nFor God did not send His Son into the\nworld to condemn the world, but that the\nworld through Him might be saved.\nThe wind blows where it wishes, and\nyou hear the sound of it, but cannot tell\nwhere it comes from and where it goes.\nSo is everyone who is born of the Spirit.\"\n\"He who believes in Him is not\ncondemned; but he who does not\nbelieve is condemned already, because\nhe has not believed in the name of the\nonly begotten Son of God.\nNicodemus answered and said to Him,\n\"How can these things be?\"\nJesus answered and said to him, \"Are\nyou the teacher of Israel, and do not\nknow these things?\nMost assuredly, I say to you, We\nspeak what We know and testify what\nWe have seen, and you do not receive\nOur witness.\nAnd this is the condemnation, that the\nlight has come into the world, and men\nloved darkness rather than light,\nbecause their deeds were evil.\nFor everyone practicing evil hates the\nlight and does not come to the light, lest\nhis deeds should be exposed.\nBut he who does the truth comes to\nthe light, that his deeds may be clearly\nseen, that they have been done in God.\"\nIf I have told you earthly things and\nyou do not believe, how will you believe\nif I tell you heavenly things?\nNo one has ascended to heaven but\nHe who came down from heaven, that is,\nthe Son of Man who is in heaven.\nAfter these things Jesus and His\ndisciples came into the land of Judea,\nand there He remained with them and\nbaptized.\nNow John also was baptizing in Aenon\nnear Salim, because there was much\nwater there. And they came and were\nbaptized.\nHe who has received His testimony\nhas certified that God is true.\nFor John had not yet been thrown into\nprison.\nFor He whom God has sent speaks\nthe words of God, for God does not give\nthe Spirit by measure.\nThen there arose a dispute between\nsome of John's disciples and the Jews\nabout purification.\nThe Father loves the Son, and has\ngiven all things into His hand.\nAnd they came to John and said to\nhim, \"Rabbi, He who was with you\nbeyond the Jordan, to whom you have\ntestified--behold, He is baptizing, and all\nare coming to Him!\"\nJohn answered and said, \"A man can\nreceive nothing unless it has been given\nto him from heaven.\nYou yourselves bear me witness, that I\nsaid, \"I am not the Christ,' but, \"I have\nbeen sent before Him.'\nHe who has the bride is the\nbridegroom; but the friend of the\nbridegroom, who stands and hears him,\nrejoices greatly because of the\nbridegroom's voice. Therefore this joy of\nmine is fulfilled.\nHe must increase, but I must decrease.\nHe who comes from above is above\nall; he who is of the earth is earthly and\nspeaks of the earth. He who comes from\nheaven is above all.\nAnd what He has seen and heard, that\nHe testifies; and no one receives His\ntestimony.\nHe who believes in the Son has\neverlasting life; and he who does not\nbelieve the Son shall not see life, but the\nwrath of God abides on him.\"\n4Therefore, when the Lord knew that\nthe Pharisees had heard that Jesus\nmade and baptized more disciples than\nJohn\n(though Jesus Himself did not baptize,\nbut His disciples),\nHe left Judea and departed again to\nGalilee.\nBut He needed to go through Samaria.\nSo He came to a city of Samaria which\nis called Sychar, near the plot of ground\nthat Jacob gave to his son Joseph.\nNow Jacob's well was there. Jesus\ntherefore, being wearied from His\njourney, sat thus by the well. It was\nabout the sixth hour.\nA woman of Samaria came to draw\nwater. Jesus said to her, \"Give Me a\ndrink.\"\nFor His disciples had gone away into\nthe city to buy food.\nThen the woman of Samaria said to\nHim, \"How is it that You, being a Jew,\nask a drink from me, a Samaritan\nwoman?\" For Jews have no dealings\nwith Samaritans.\nJesus answered and said to her, \"If\nyou knew the gift of God, and who it is\nwho says to you, \"Give Me a drink,' you\nwould have asked Him, and He would\nhave given you living water.\"\nThe woman said to Him, \"Sir, You\nhave nothing to draw with, and the well\nis deep. Where then do You get that\nliving water?\nAre You greater than our father Jacob,\nwho gave us the well, and drank from it\nhimself, as well as his sons and his\nlivestock?\"\nJesus answered and said to her,\n\"Whoever drinks of this water will thirst\nagain,\nbut whoever drinks of the water that I\nshall give him will never thirst. But the\nwater that I shall give him will become in\nhim a fountain of water springing up into\neverlasting life.\"\nThe woman answered and said, \"I\nhave no husband.\" Jesus said to her,\n\"You have well said, \"I have no\nhusband,'\nfor you have had five husbands, and\nthe one whom you now have is not your\nhusband; in that you spoke truly.\"\nThe woman said to Him, \"Sir, I\nperceive that You are a prophet.\nOur fathers worshiped on this\nmountain, and you Jews say that in\nJerusalem is the place where one ought\nto worship.\"\nJesus said to her, \"Woman, believe\nMe, the hour is coming when you will\nneither on this mountain, nor in\nJerusalem, worship the Father.\nYou worship what you do not know;\nwe know what we worship, for salvation\nis of the Jews.\nBut the hour is coming, and now is,\nwhen the true worshipers will worship\nthe Father in spirit and truth; for the\nFather is seeking such to worship Him.\nGod is Spirit, and those who worship\nHim must worship in spirit and truth.\"\nThe woman said to Him, \"Sir, give me\nthis water, that I may not thirst, nor\ncome here to draw.\"\nThe woman said to Him, \"I know that\nMessiah is coming\" (who is called\nChrist). \"When He comes, He will tell us\nall things.\"\nJesus said to her, \"Go, call your\nhusband, and come here.\"\nJesus said to her, \"I who speak to you\nam He.\"\nAnd at this point His disciples came,\nand they marveled that He talked with a\nwoman; yet no one said, \"What do You\nseek?\" or, \"Why are You talking with\nher?\"\nThe woman then left her waterpot,\nwent her way into the city, and said to\nthe men,\n\"Come, see a Man who told me all\nthings that I ever did. Could this be the\nChrist?\"\nThen they went out of the city and\ncame to Him.\nFor in this the saying is true: \"One\nsows and another reaps.'\nI sent you to reap that for which you\nhave not labored; others have labored,\nand you have entered into their labors.\"\nAnd many of the Samaritans of that\ncity believed in Him because of the word\nof the woman who testified, \"He told me\nall that I ever did.\"\nSo when the Samaritans had come to\nHim, they urged Him to stay with them;\nand He stayed there two days.\nIn the meantime His disciples urged\nHim, saying, \"Rabbi, eat.\"\nAnd many more believed because of\nHis own word.\nBut He said to them, \"I have food to\neat of which you do not know.\"\nTherefore the disciples said to one\nanother, \"Has anyone brought Him\nanything to eat?\"\nThen they said to the woman, \"Now\nwe believe, not because of what you\nsaid, for we ourselves have heard Him\nand we know that this is indeed the\nChrist, the Savior of the world.\"\nNow after the two days He departed\nfrom there and went to Galilee.\nJesus said to them, \"My food is to do\nthe will of Him who sent Me, and to\nfinish His work.\nFor Jesus Himself testified that a\nprophet has no honor in his own country.\nDo you not say, \"There are still four\nmonths and then comes the harvest'?\nBehold, I say to you, lift up your eyes\nand look at the fields, for they are\nalready white for harvest!\nSo when He came to Galilee, the\nGalileans received Him, having seen all\nthe things He did in Jerusalem at the\nfeast; for they also had gone to the feast.\nAnd he who reaps receives wages,\nand gathers fruit for eternal life, that\nboth he who sows and he who reaps\nmay rejoice together.\nSo Jesus came again to Cana of\nGalilee where He had made the water\nwine. And there was a certain nobleman\nwhose son was sick at Capernaum.\nWhen he heard that Jesus had come\nout of Judea into Galilee, he went to\nHim and implored Him to come down\nand heal his son, for he was at the point\nof death.\nIn these lay a great multitude of sick\npeople, blind, lame, paralyzed, waiting\nfor the moving of the water.\nThen Jesus said to him, \"Unless you\npeople see signs and wonders, you will\nby no means believe.\"\nThe nobleman said to Him, \"Sir, come\ndown before my child dies!\"\nJesus said to him, \"Go your way; your\nson lives.\" So the man believed the\nword that Jesus spoke to him, and he\nwent his way.\nAnd as he was now going down, his\nservants met him and told him, saying,\n\"Your son lives!\"\nThen he inquired of them the hour\nwhen he got better. And they said to him,\n\"Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever\nleft him.\"\nSo the father knew that it was at the\nsame hour in which Jesus said to him,\n\"Your son lives.\" And he himself\nbelieved, and his whole household.\nFor an angel went down at a certain\ntime into the pool and stirred up the\nwater; then whoever stepped in first,\nafter the stirring of the water, was made\nwell of whatever disease he had.\nNow a certain man was there who had\nan infirmity thirty-eight years.\nWhen Jesus saw him lying there, and\nknew that he already had been in that\ncondition a long time, He said to him,\n\"Do you want to be made well?\"\nThe sick man answered Him, \"Sir, I\nhave no man to put me into the pool\nwhen the water is stirred up; but while I\nam coming, another steps down before\nme.\"\nJesus said to him, \"Rise, take up your\nbed and walk.\"\nAnd immediately the man was made\nwell, took up his bed, and walked. And\nthat day was the Sabbath.\nThis again is the second sign Jesus\ndid when He had come out of Judea into\nGalilee.\n5After this there was a feast of the\nJews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.\nNow there is in Jerusalem by the\nSheep Gate a pool, which is called in\nHebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.\nThe Jews therefore said to him who\nwas cured, \"It is the Sabbath; it is not\nlawful for you to carry your bed.\"\nHe answered them, \"He who made me\nwell said to me, \"Take up your bed and\nwalk.\"'\nThen they asked him, \"Who is the Man\nwho said to you, \"Take up your bed and\nwalk'?\"\nBut the one who was healed did not\nknow who it was, for Jesus had\nwithdrawn, a multitude being in that\nplace.\nAfterward Jesus found him in the\ntemple, and said to him, \"See, you have\nbeen made well. Sin no more, lest a\nworse thing come upon you.\"\nFor the Father judges no one, but has\ncommitted all judgment to the Son,\nthat all should honor the Son just as\nthey honor the Father. He who does not\nhonor the Son does not honor the\nFather who sent Him.\nThe man departed and told the Jews\nthat it was Jesus who had made him\nwell.\n\"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who\nhears My word and believes in Him who\nsent Me has everlasting life, and shall\nnot come into judgment, but has passed\nfrom death into life.\nFor this reason the Jews persecuted\nJesus, and sought to kill Him, because\nHe had done these things on the\nSabbath.\nMost assuredly, I say to you, the hour\nis coming, and now is, when the dead\nwill hear the voice of the Son of God;\nand those who hear will live.\nBut Jesus answered them, \"My Father\nhas been working until now, and I have\nbeen working.\"\nFor as the Father has life in Himself,\nso He has granted the Son to have life\nin Himself,\nTherefore the Jews sought all the\nmore to kill Him, because He not only\nbroke the Sabbath, but also said that\nGod was His Father, making Himself\nequal with God.\nThen Jesus answered and said to\nthem, \"Most assuredly, I say to you, the\nSon can do nothing of Himself, but what\nHe sees the Father do; for whatever He\ndoes, the Son also does in like manner.\nFor the Father loves the Son, and\nshows Him all things that He Himself\ndoes; and He will show Him greater\nworks than these, that you may marvel.\nFor as the Father raises the dead and\ngives life to them, even so the Son gives\nlife to whom He will.\nand has given Him authority to\nexecute judgment also, because He is\nthe Son of Man.\nDo not marvel at this; for the hour is\ncoming in which all who are in the\ngraves will hear His voice\nand come forth--those who have done\ngood, to the resurrection of life, and\nthose who have done evil, to the\nresurrection of condemnation.\nI can of Myself do nothing. As I hear, I\njudge; and My judgment is righteous,\nbecause I do not seek My own will but\nthe will of the Father who sent Me.\n\"If I bear witness of Myself, My witness\nis not true.\nThere is another who bears witness of\nMe, and I know that the witness which\nHe witnesses of Me is true.\nI have come in My Father's name, and\nyou do not receive Me; if another comes\nin his own name, him you will receive.\nYou have sent to John, and he has\nborne witness to the truth.\nYet I do not receive testimony from\nman, but I say these things that you may\nbe saved.\nHe was the burning and shining lamp,\nand you were willing for a time to rejoice\nin his light.\nHow can you believe, who receive\nhonor from one another, and do not\nseek the honor that comes from the only\nGod?\nDo not think that I shall accuse you to\nthe Father; there is one who accuses\nyou--Moses, in whom you trust.\nFor if you believed Moses, you would\nbelieve Me; for he wrote about Me.\nBut I have a greater witness than\nJohn's; for the works which the Father\nhas given Me to finish--the very works\nthat I do--bear witness of Me, that the\nFather has sent Me.\nAnd the Father Himself, who sent Me,\nhas testified of Me. You have neither\nheard His voice at any time, nor seen\nHis form.\nBut you do not have His word abiding\nin you, because whom He sent, Him you\ndo not believe.\nYou search the Scriptures, for in them\nyou think you have eternal life; and\nthese are they which testify of Me.\nBut you are not willing to come to Me\nthat you may have life.\n\"I do not receive honor from men.\nBut I know you, that you do not have\nthe love of God in you.\nBut if you do not believe his writings,\nhow will you believe My words?\"\n6After these things Jesus went over\nthe Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of\nTiberias.\nThen a great multitude followed Him,\nbecause they saw His signs which He\nperformed on those who were diseased.\nAnd Jesus went up on the mountain,\nand there He sat with His disciples.\nNow the Passover, a feast of the Jews,\nwas near.\nThen Jesus lifted up His eyes, and\nseeing a great multitude coming toward\nHim, He said to Philip, \"Where shall we\nbuy bread, that these may eat?\"\nBut this He said to test him, for He\nHimself knew what He would do.\nPhilip answered Him, \"Two hundred\ndenarii worth of bread is not sufficient\nfor them, that every one of them may\nhave a little.\"\nNow when evening came,\ndisciples went down to the sea,\nHis\nOne of His disciples, Andrew, Simon\nPeter's brother, said to Him,\ngot into the boat, and went over the\nsea toward Capernaum. And it was\nalready dark, and Jesus had not come\nto them.\n\"There is a lad here who has five barley\nloaves and two small fish, but what are\nthey among so many?\"\nThen the sea arose because a great\nwind was blowing.\nThen Jesus said, \"Make the people sit\ndown.\" Now there was much grass in\nthe place. So the men sat down, in\nnumber about five thousand.\nSo when they had rowed about three\nor four miles, they saw Jesus walking on\nthe sea and drawing near the boat; and\nthey were afraid.\nAnd Jesus took the loaves, and when\nHe had given thanks He distributed\nthem to the disciples, and the disciples\nto those sitting down; and likewise of the\nfish, as much as they wanted.\nSo when they were filled, He said to\nHis disciples, \"Gather up the fragments\nthat remain, so that nothing is lost.\"\nBut He said to them, \"It is I; do not be\nafraid.\"\nThen they willingly received Him into\nthe boat, and immediately the boat was\nat the land where they were going.\nTherefore they gathered them up, and\nfilled twelve baskets with the fragments\nof the five barley loaves which were left\nover by those who had eaten.\nOn the following day, when the people\nwho were standing on the other side of\nthe sea saw that there was no other\nboat there, except that one which His\ndisciples had entered, and that Jesus\nhad not entered the boat with His\ndisciples, but His disciples had gone\naway alone--\nThen those men, when they had seen\nthe sign that Jesus did, said, \"This is\ntruly the Prophet who is to come into the\nworld.\"\nhowever, other boats came from\nTiberias, near the place where they ate\nbread after the Lord had given thanks-24\nTherefore when Jesus perceived that\nthey were about to come and take Him\nby force to make Him king, He departed\nagain to the mountain by Himself alone.\nwhen the people therefore saw that\nJesus was not there, nor His disciples,\nthey also got into boats and came to\nCapernaum, seeking Jesus.\nAnd when they found Him on the other\nside of the sea, they said to Him, \"Rabbi,\nwhen did You come here?\"\nThen they said to Him, \"Lord, give us\nthis bread always.\"\nJesus answered them and said, \"Most\nassuredly, I say to you, you seek Me,\nnot because you saw the signs, but\nbecause you ate of the loaves and were\nfilled.\nDo not labor for the food which\nperishes, but for the food which endures\nto everlasting life, which the Son of Man\nwill give you, because God the Father\nhas set His seal on Him.\"\nAnd Jesus said to them, \"I am the\nbread of life. He who comes to Me shall\nnever hunger, and he who believes in\nMe shall never thirst.\nBut I said to you that you have seen\nMe and yet do not believe.\nAll that the Father gives Me will come\nto Me, and the one who comes to Me I\nwill by no means cast out.\nThen they said to Him, \"What shall we\ndo, that we may work the works of\nGod?\"\nFor I have come down from heaven,\nnot to do My own will, but the will of Him\nwho sent Me.\nJesus answered and said to them,\n\"This is the work of God, that you\nbelieve in Him whom He sent.\"\nThis is the will of the Father who sent\nMe, that of all He has given Me I should\nlose nothing, but should raise it up at the\nlast day.\nTherefore they said to Him, \"What sign\nwill You perform then, that we may see\nit and believe You? What work will You\ndo?\nOur fathers ate the manna in the\ndesert; as it is written, \"He gave them\nbread from heaven to eat.\"'\nAnd this is the will of Him who sent Me,\nthat everyone who sees the Son and\nbelieves in Him may have everlasting\nlife; and I will raise him up at the last\nday.\"\nThe Jews then complained about Him,\nbecause He said, \"I am the bread which\ncame down from heaven.\"\nThen Jesus said to them, \"Most\nassuredly, I say to you, Moses did not\ngive you the bread from heaven, but My\nFather gives you the true bread from\nheaven.\nAnd they said, \"Is not this Jesus, the\nson of Joseph, whose father and mother\nwe know? How is it then that He says, \"I\nhave come down from heaven'?\"\nFor the bread of God is He who comes\ndown from heaven and gives life to the\nworld.\"\nJesus therefore answered and said to\nthem, \"Do not murmur among\nyourselves.\nNo one can come to Me unless the\nFather who sent Me draws him; and I\nwill raise him up at the last day.\nFor My flesh is food indeed, and My\nblood is drink indeed.\nIt is written in the prophets, \"And they\nshall all be taught by God.' Therefore\neveryone who has heard and learned\nfrom the Father comes to Me.\nNot that anyone has seen the Father,\nexcept He who is from God; He has\nseen the Father.\nMost assuredly, I say to you, he who\nbelieves in Me has everlasting life.\nHe who eats My flesh and drinks My\nblood abides in Me, and I in him.\nAs the living Father sent Me, and I live\nbecause of the Father, so he who feeds\non Me will live because of Me.\nThis is the bread which came down\nfrom heaven--not as your fathers ate the\nmanna, and are dead. He who eats this\nbread will live forever.\"\nThese things He said in the\nsynagogue as He taught in Capernaum.\nI am the bread of life.\nYour fathers ate the manna in the\nwilderness, and are dead.\nTherefore many of His disciples, when\nthey heard this, said, \"This is a hard\nsaying; who can understand it?\"\nThis is the bread which comes down\nfrom heaven, that one may eat of it and\nnot die.\nWhen Jesus knew in Himself that His\ndisciples complained about this, He said\nto them, \"Does this offend you?\nI am the living bread which came down\nfrom heaven. If anyone eats of this\nbread, he will live forever; and the bread\nthat I shall give is My flesh, which I shall\ngive for the life of the world.\"\nThe Jews therefore quarreled among\nthemselves, saying, \"How can this Man\ngive us His flesh to eat?\"\nThen Jesus said to them, \"Most\nassuredly, I say to you, unless you eat\nthe flesh of the Son of Man and drink\nHis blood, you have no life in you.\nWhoever eats My flesh and drinks My\nblood has eternal life, and I will raise\nhim up at the last day.\nWhat then if you should see the Son of\nMan ascend where He was before?\nIt is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh\nprofits nothing. The words that I speak\nto you are spirit, and they are life.\nBut there are some of you who do not\nbelieve.\" For Jesus knew from the\nbeginning who they were who did not\nbelieve, and who would betray Him.\nAnd He said, \"Therefore I have said to\nyou that no one can come to Me unless\nit has been granted to him by My\nFather.\"\nFrom that time many of His disciples\nwent back and walked with Him no more.\nFor even His brothers did not believe in\nHim.\nThen Jesus said to the twelve, \"Do you\nalso want to go away?\"\nThen Jesus said to them, \"My time has\nnot yet come, but your time is always\nready.\nBut Simon Peter answered Him, \"Lord,\nto whom shall we go? You have the\nwords of eternal life.\nThe world cannot hate you, but it hates\nMe because I testify of it that its works\nare evil.\nAlso we have come to believe and\nknow that You are the Christ, the Son of\nthe living God.\"\nYou go up to this feast. I am not yet\ngoing up to this feast, for My time has\nnot yet fully come.\"\nJesus answered them, \"Did I not\nchoose you, the twelve, and one of you\nis a devil?\"\nWhen He had said these things to them,\nHe remained in Galilee.\nHe spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of\nSimon, for it was he who would betray\nHim, being one of the twelve.\nBut when His brothers had gone up,\nthen He also went up to the feast, not\nopenly, but as it were in secret.\n7After these things Jesus walked in\nGalilee; for He did not want to walk in\nJudea, because the Jews sought to kill\nHim.\nNow the Jews' Feast of Tabernacles\nwas at hand.\nHis brothers therefore said to Him,\n\"Depart from here and go into Judea,\nthat Your disciples also may see the\nworks that You are doing.\nFor no one does anything in secret\nwhile he himself seeks to be known\nopenly. If You do these things, show\nYourself to the world.\"\nThen the Jews sought Him at the feast,\nand said, \"Where is He?\"\nAnd there was much complaining\namong the people concerning Him.\nSome said, \"He is good\"; others said,\n\"No, on the contrary, He deceives the\npeople.\"\nHowever, no one spoke openly of Him\nfor fear of the Jews.\nNow about the middle of the feast\nJesus went up into the temple and\ntaught.\nAnd the Jews marveled, saying, \"How\ndoes this Man know letters, having\nnever studied?\"\nJesus answered them and said, \"My\ndoctrine is not Mine, but His who sent\nMe.\nBut look! He speaks boldly, and they\nsay nothing to Him. Do the rulers know\nindeed that this is truly the Christ?\nIf anyone wills to do His will, he shall\nknow concerning the doctrine, whether it\nis from God or whether I speak on My\nown authority.\nHowever, we know where this Man is\nfrom; but when the Christ comes, no\none knows where He is from.\"\nHe who speaks from himself seeks his\nown glory; but He who seeks the glory\nof the One who sent Him is true, and no\nunrighteousness is in Him.\nThen Jesus cried out, as He taught in\nthe temple, saying, \"You both know Me,\nand you know where I am from; and I\nhave not come of Myself, but He who\nsent Me is true, whom you do not know.\nDid not Moses give you the law, yet\nnone of you keeps the law? Why do you\nseek to kill Me?\"\nBut I know Him, for I am from Him, and\nHe sent Me.\"\nThe people answered and said, \"You\nhave a demon. Who is seeking to kill\nYou?\"\nTherefore they sought to take Him; but\nno one laid a hand on Him, because His\nhour had not yet come.\nJesus answered and said to them, \"I\ndid one work, and you all marvel.\nAnd many of the people believed in\nHim, and said, \"When the Christ comes,\nwill He do more signs than these which\nthis Man has done?\"\nMoses\ntherefore\ngave\nyou\ncircumcision (not that it is from Moses,\nbut from the fathers), and you\ncircumcise a man on the Sabbath.\nThe Pharisees heard the crowd\nmurmuring these things concerning Him,\nand the Pharisees and the chief priests\nsent officers to take Him.\nIf a man receives circumcision on the\nSabbath, so that the law of Moses\nshould not be broken, are you angry\nwith Me because I made a man\ncompletely well on the Sabbath?\nThen Jesus said to them, \"I shall be\nwith you a little while longer, and then I\ngo to Him who sent Me.\nDo not judge according to appearance,\nbut judge with righteous judgment.\"\nYou will seek Me and not find Me, and\nwhere I am you cannot come.\"\nNow some of them from Jerusalem\nsaid, \"Is this not He whom they seek to\nkill?\nThen\nthe\nJews\nsaid\namong\nthemselves, \"Where does He intend to\ngo that we shall not find Him? Does He\nintend to go to the Dispersion among\nthe Greeks and teach the Greeks?\nWhat is this thing that He said, \"You\nwill seek Me and not find Me, and where\nI am you cannot come'?\"\nThe officers answered, \"No man ever\nspoke like this Man!\"\nOn the last day, that great day of the\nfeast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying,\n\"If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me\nand drink.\nHe who believes in Me, as the\nScripture has said, out of his heart will\nflow rivers of living water.\"\nThen the Pharisees answered them,\n\"Are you also deceived?\nHave any of the rulers\nPharisees believed in Him?\nor\nthe\nBut this crowd that does not know the\nlaw is accursed.\"\nBut this He spoke concerning the Spirit,\nwhom those believing in Him would\nreceive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet\ngiven, because Jesus was not yet\nglorified.\nTherefore many from the crowd, when\nthey heard this saying, said, \"Truly this\nis the Prophet.\"\nOthers said, \"This is the Christ.\" But\nsome said, \"Will the Christ come out of\nGalilee?\nHas not the Scripture said that the\nChrist comes from the seed of David\nand from the town of Bethlehem, where\nDavid was?\"\nSo there was a division among the\npeople because of Him.\nNow some of them wanted to take Him,\nbut no one laid hands on Him.\nNicodemus (he who came to Jesus by\nnight, being one of them) said to them,\n\"Does our law judge a man before it\nhears him and knows what he is doing?\"\nThey answered and said to him, \"Are\nyou also from Galilee? Search and look,\nfor no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.\"\nAnd everyone went to his own house.\n8But Jesus went to the Mount of\nOlives.\nNow early in the morning He came\nagain into the temple, and all the people\ncame to Him; and He sat down and\ntaught them.\nThen the scribes and Pharisees\nbrought to Him a woman caught in\nadultery. And when they had set her in\nthe midst,\nThen the officers came to the chief\npriests and Pharisees, who said to them,\n\"Why have you not brought Him?\"\nthey said to Him, \"Teacher, this woman\nwas caught in adultery, in the very act.\nNow Moses, in the law, commanded us\nthat such should be stoned. But what do\nYou say?\"\nThis they said, testing Him, that they\nmight have something of which to\naccuse Him. But Jesus stooped down\nand wrote on the ground with His finger,\nas though He did not hear.\nSo when they continued asking Him,\nHe raised Himself up and said to them,\n\"He who is without sin among you, let\nhim throw a stone at her first.\"\nJesus answered and said to them,\n\"Even if I bear witness of Myself, My\nwitness is true, for I know where I came\nfrom and where I am going; but you do\nnot know where I come from and where\nI am going.\nYou judge according to the flesh; I\njudge no one.\nAnd yet if I do judge, My judgment is\ntrue; for I am not alone, but I am with the\nFather who sent Me.\nAnd again He stooped down and wrote\non the ground.\nIt is also written in your law that the\ntestimony of two men is true.\nThen those who heard it, being\nconvicted by their conscience, went out\none by one, beginning with the oldest\neven to the last. And Jesus was left\nalone, and the woman standing in the\nmidst.\nWhen Jesus had raised Himself up\nand saw no one but the woman, He said\nto her, \"Woman, where are those\naccusers of yours? Has no one\ncondemned you?\"\nShe said, \"No one, Lord.\" And Jesus\nsaid to her, \"Neither do I condemn you;\ngo and sin no more.\"\nThen Jesus spoke to them again,\nsaying, \"I am the light of the world. He\nwho follows Me shall not walk in\ndarkness, but have the light of life.\"\nThe Pharisees therefore said to Him,\n\"You bear witness of Yourself; Your\nwitness is not true.\"\nI am One who bears witness of Myself,\nand the Father who sent Me bears\nwitness of Me.\"\nThen they said to Him, \"Where is Your\nFather?\" Jesus answered, \"You know\nneither Me nor My Father. If you had\nknown Me, you would have known My\nFather also.\"\nThese words Jesus spoke in the\ntreasury, as He taught in the temple;\nand no one laid hands on Him, for His\nhour had not yet come.\nThen Jesus said to them again, \"I am\ngoing away, and you will seek Me, and\nwill die in your sin. Where I go you\ncannot come.\"\nSo the Jews said, \"Will He kill Himself,\nbecause He says, \"Where I go you\ncannot come'?\"\nAnd He said to them, \"You are from\nbeneath; I am from above.

How\ncan You say, \"You will be made free'?\"\nTherefore I said to you that you will die\nin your sins; for if you do not believe that\nI am He, you will die in your sins.\"\nJesus\nanswered\nthem,\n\"Most\nassuredly, I say to you, whoever\ncommits sin is a slave of sin.\nThen they said to Him, \"Who are\nYou?\" And Jesus said to them, \"Just\nwhat I have been saying to you from the\nbeginning.\nI have many things to say and to judge\nconcerning you, but He who sent Me is\ntrue; and I speak to the world those\nthings which I heard from Him.\"\nAnd a slave does not abide in the\nhouse forever, but a son abides forever.\nTherefore if the Son makes you free,\nyou shall be free indeed.\n\"I know that you are Abraham's\ndescendants, but you seek to kill Me,\nbecause My word has no place in you.\nThey did not understand that He spoke\nto them of the Father.\nI speak what I have seen with My\nFather, and you do what you have seen\nwith your father.\"\nThen Jesus said to them, \"When you\nlift up the Son of Man, then you will\nknow that I am He, and that I do nothing\nof Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I\nspeak these things.\nThey answered and said to Him,\n\"Abraham is our father.\" Jesus said to\nthem, \"If you were Abraham's children,\nyou would do the works of Abraham.\nAnd He who sent Me is with Me.

And if I say, \"I do not know\nHim,' I shall be a liar like you; but I do\nknow Him and keep His word.\nYour father Abraham rejoiced to see\nMy day, and he saw it and was glad.\"\nThen the Jews said to Him, \"You are\nnot yet fifty years old, and have You\nseen Abraham?\"\nThen the Jews answered and said to\nHim, \"Do we not say rightly that You are\na Samaritan and have a demon?\"\nJesus said to them, \"Most assuredly, I\nsay to you, before Abraham was, I AM.\"\nJesus answered, \"I do not have a\ndemon; but I honor My Father, and you\ndishonor Me.\nAnd I do not seek My own glory; there\nis One who seeks and judges.\nMost assuredly, I say to you, if anyone\nkeeps My word he shall never see\ndeath.\"\nThen the Jews said to Him, \"Now we\nknow that You have a demon!

And the\nThen they took up stones to throw at\nHim; but Jesus hid Himself and went out\nof the temple, going through the midst of\nthem, and so passed by.\n9Now as Jesus passed by, He saw a\nman who was blind from birth.\nAnd His disciples asked Him, saying,\n\"Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his\nparents, that he was born blind?\"\nJesus answered, \"Neither this man nor\nhis parents sinned, but that the works of\nGod should be revealed in him.\nI must work the works of Him who sent\nMe while it is day; the night is coming\nwhen no one can work.\nThen the Pharisees also asked him\nagain how he had received his sight. He\nsaid to them, \"He put clay on my eyes,\nand I washed, and I see.\"\nAs long as I am in the world, I am the\nlight of the world.\"\nWhen He had said these things, He\nspat on the ground and made clay with\nthe saliva; and He anointed the eyes of\nthe blind man with the clay.\nTherefore some of the Pharisees said,\n\"This Man is not from God, because He\ndoes not keep the Sabbath.\" Others said,\n\"How can a man who is a sinner do\nsuch signs?\" And there was a division\namong them.\nAnd He said to him, \"Go, wash in the\npool of Siloam\" (which is translated,\nSent). So he went and washed, and\ncame back seeing.\nThey said to the blind man again,\n\"What do you say about Him because\nHe opened your eyes?\" He said, \"He is\na prophet.\"\nTherefore the neighbors and those who\npreviously had seen that he was blind\nsaid, \"Is not this he who sat and\nbegged?\"\nBut the Jews did not believe\nconcerning him, that he had been blind\nand received his sight, until they called\nthe parents of him who had received his\nsight.\nSome said, \"This is he.\" Others said,\n\"He is like him.\" He said, \"I am he.\"\nTherefore they said to him, \"How were\nyour eyes opened?\"\nHe answered and said, \"A Man called\nJesus made clay and anointed my eyes\nand said to me, \"Go to the pool of\nSiloam and wash.' So I went and\nwashed, and I received sight.\"\nThen they said to him, \"Where is He?\"\nHe said, \"I do not know.\"\nThey brought him who formerly was\nblind to the Pharisees.\nNow it was a Sabbath when Jesus\nmade the clay and opened his eyes.\nAnd they asked them, saying, \"Is this\nyour son, who you say was born blind?\nHow then does he now see?\"\nHis parents answered them and said,\n\"We know that this is our son, and that\nhe was born blind;\nbut by what means he now sees we do\nnot know, or who opened his eyes we\ndo not know. He is of age; ask him. He\nwill speak for himself.\"\nHis parents said these things because\nthey feared the Jews, for the Jews had\nagreed already that if anyone confessed\nthat He was Christ, he would be put out\nof the synagogue.\nTherefore his parents said, \"He is of\nage; ask him.\"\nIf this Man were not from God, He\ncould do nothing.\"\nSo they again called the man who was\nblind, and said to him, \"Give God the\nglory! We know that this Man is a\nsinner.\"\nThey answered and said to him, \"You\nwere completely born in sins, and are\nyou teaching us?\" And they cast him out.\nHe answered and said, \"Whether He is\na sinner or not I do not know. One thing\nI know: that though I was blind, now I\nsee.\"\nJesus heard that they had cast him\nout; and when He had found him, He\nsaid to him, \"Do you believe in the Son\nof God?\"\nThen they said to him again, \"What did\nHe do to you? How did He open your\neyes?\"\nHe answered them, \"I told you already,\nand you did not listen. Why do you want\nto hear it again? Do you also want to\nbecome His disciples?\"\nThen they reviled him and said, \"You\nare His disciple, but we are Moses'\ndisciples.\nWe know that God spoke to Moses; as\nfor this fellow, we do not know where He\nis from.\"\nThe man answered and said to them,\n\"Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you\ndo not know where He is from; yet He\nhas opened my eyes!\nNow we know that God does not hear\nsinners; but if anyone is a worshiper of\nGod and does His will, He hears him.\nSince the world began it has been\nunheard of that anyone opened the eyes\nof one who was born blind.\nHe answered and said, \"Who is He,\nLord, that I may believe in Him?\"\nAnd Jesus said to him, \"You have both\nseen Him and it is He who is talking with\nyou.\"\nThen he said, \"Lord, I believe!\" And he\nworshiped Him.\nAnd Jesus said, \"For judgment I have\ncome into this world, that those who do\nnot see may see, and that those who\nsee may be made blind.\"\nThen some of the Pharisees who were\nwith Him heard these words, and said to\nHim, \"Are we blind also?\"\nJesus said to them, \"If you were blind,\nyou would have no sin; but now you say,\n\"We see.' Therefore your sin remains.\n10\"Most assuredly, I say to you, he\nwho does not enter the sheepfold by the\ndoor, but climbs up some other way, the\nsame is a thief and a robber.\nBut he who enters by the door is the\nshepherd of the sheep.\nthe sheep and flees; and the wolf\ncatches the sheep and scatters them.\nTo him the doorkeeper opens, and the\nsheep hear his voice; and he calls his\nown sheep by name and leads them out.\nThe hireling flees because he is a\nhireling and does not care about the\nsheep.\nAnd when he brings out his own sheep,\nhe goes before them; and the sheep\nfollow him, for they know his voice.\nI am the good shepherd; and I know\nMy sheep, and am known by My own.\nYet they will by no means follow a\nstranger, but will flee from him, for they\ndo not know the voice of strangers.\"\nAs the Father knows Me, even so I\nknow the Father; and I lay down My life\nfor the sheep.\nJesus used this illustration, but they did\nnot understand the things which He\nspoke to them.\nAnd other sheep I have which are not\nof this fold; them also I must bring, and\nthey will hear My voice; and there will be\none flock and one shepherd.\nThen Jesus said to them again, \"Most\nassuredly, I say to you, I am the door of\nthe sheep.\n\"Therefore My Father loves Me,\nbecause I lay down My life that I may\ntake it again.\nAll who ever came before Me are\nthieves and robbers, but the sheep did\nnot hear them.\nI am the door.

Look, the world\nhas gone after Him!\"\nbecause on account of him many of\nthe Jews went away and believed in\nJesus.\nNow there were certain Greeks among\nthose who came up to worship at the\nfeast.\nThe next day a great multitude that\nhad come to the feast, when they heard\nthat Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,\nThen they came to Philip, who was\nfrom Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked\nhim, saying, \"Sir, we wish to see Jesus.\"\ntook branches of palm trees and went\nout to meet Him, and cried out:\n\"Hosanna! \"Blessed is He who comes in\nthe name of the LORD!' The King of\nIsrael!\"\nPhilip came and told Andrew, and in\nturn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.\nBut Jesus answered them, saying,\n\"The hour has come that the Son of Man\nshould be glorified.\nThen Jesus, when He had found a\nyoung donkey, sat on it; as it is written:\nMost assuredly, I say to you, unless a\ngrain of wheat falls into the ground and\ndies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it\nproduces much grain.\nHe who loves his life will lose it, and\nhe who hates his life in this world will\nkeep it for eternal life.\nIf anyone serves Me, let him follow\nMe; and where I am, there My servant\nwill be also.

Walk while\nyou have the light, lest darkness\novertake you; he who walks in darkness\ndoes not know where he is going.\nWhile you have the light, believe in the\nlight, that you may become sons of\nlight.\" These things Jesus spoke, and\ndeparted, and was hidden from them.\nBut although He had done so many\nsigns before them, they did not believe\nin Him,\nFather, glorify Your name.\" Then a\nvoice came from heaven, saying, \"I have\nboth glorified it and will glorify it again.\"\nTherefore the people who stood by\nand heard it said that it had thundered.\nOthers said, \"An angel has spoken to\nHim.\"\nthat the word of Isaiah the prophet\nmight be fulfilled, which he spoke: \"Lord,\nwho has believed our report? And to\nwhom has the arm of the LORD been\nrevealed?\"\nTherefore they could not believe,\nbecause Isaiah said again:\nJesus answered and said, \"This voice\ndid not come because of Me, but for\nyour sake.\nNow is the judgment of this world; now\nthe ruler of this world will be cast out.\n\"He has blinded their eyes and\nhardened their hearts, Lest they should\nsee with their eyes, Lest they should\nunderstand with their hearts and turn,\nSo that I should heal them.\"\nAnd I, if I am lifted up from the earth,\nwill draw all peoples to Myself.\"\nThese things Isaiah said when he saw\nHis glory and spoke of Him.\nThis He said, signifying by what death\nHe would die.\nThe people answered Him, \"We have\nheard from the law that the Christ\nremains forever; and how can You say,\n\"The Son of Man must be lifted up'?\nWho is this Son of Man?\"\nNevertheless even among the rulers\nmany believed in Him, but because of\nthe Pharisees they did not confess Him,\nlest they should be put out of the\nsynagogue;\nfor they loved the praise of men more\nthan the praise of God.\nThen Jesus cried out and said, \"He\nwho believes in Me, believes not in Me\nbut in Him who sent Me.\nJesus, knowing that the Father had\ngiven all things into His hands, and that\nHe had come from God and was going\nto God,\nAnd he who sees Me sees Him who\nsent Me.\nI have come as a light into the world,\nthat whoever believes in Me should not\nabide in darkness.\nAnd if anyone hears My words and\ndoes not believe, I do not judge him; for\nI did not come to judge the world but to\nsave the world.\nHe who rejects Me, and does not\nreceive My words, has that which judges\nhim--the word that I have spoken will\njudge him in the last day.\nrose from supper and laid aside His\ngarments, took a towel and girded\nHimself.\nAfter that, He poured water into a basin\nand began to wash the disciples' feet,\nand to wipe them with the towel with\nwhich He was girded.\nThen He came to Simon Peter. And\nPeter said to Him, \"Lord, are You\nwashing my feet?\"\nJesus answered and said to him, \"What\nI am doing you do not understand now,\nbut you will know after this.\"\nFor I have not spoken on My own\nauthority; but the Father who sent Me\ngave Me a command, what I should say\nand what I should speak.\nPeter said to Him, \"You shall never\nwash my feet!\" Jesus answered him, \"If I\ndo not wash you, you have no part with\nMe.\"\nAnd I know that His command is\neverlasting life. Therefore, whatever I\nspeak, just as the Father has told Me,\nso I speak.\"\n13Now before the Feast of the\nPassover, when Jesus knew that His\nhour had come that He should depart\nfrom this world to the Father, having\nloved His own who were in the world,\nHe loved them to the end.\nSimon Peter said to Him, \"Lord, not my\nfeet only, but also my hands and my\nhead!\"\nJesus said to him, \"He who is bathed\nneeds only to wash his feet, but is\ncompletely clean; and you are clean, but\nnot all of you.\"\nFor He knew who would betray Him;\ntherefore He said, \"You are not all\nclean.\"\nAnd supper being ended, the devil\nhaving already put it into the heart of\nJudas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray\nHim,\nSo when He had washed their feet,\ntaken His garments, and sat down again,\nHe said to them, \"Do you know what I\nhave done to you?\nThen the disciples looked at one\nanother, perplexed about whom He\nspoke.\nYou call Me Teacher and Lord, and\nyou say well, for so I am.\nIf I then, your Lord and Teacher, have\nwashed your feet, you also ought to\nwash one another's feet.\nNow there was leaning on Jesus'\nbosom one of His disciples, whom\nJesus loved.\nSimon Peter therefore motioned to him\nto ask who it was of whom He spoke.\nFor I have given you an example, that\nyou should do as I have done to you.\nThen, leaning back on Jesus' breast,\nhe said to Him, \"Lord, who is it?\"\nMost assuredly, I say to you, a servant\nis not greater than his master; nor is he\nwho is sent greater than he who sent\nhim.\nIf you know these things, blessed are\nyou if you do them.\n\"I do not speak concerning all of you. I\nknow whom I have chosen; but that the\nScripture may be fulfilled, \"He who eats\nbread with Me has lifted up his heel\nagainst Me.'\nNow I tell you before it comes, that\nwhen it does come to pass, you may\nbelieve that I am He.\nMost assuredly, I say to you, he who\nreceives whomever I send receives Me;\nand he who receives Me receives Him\nwho sent Me.\"\nJesus answered, \"It is he to whom I\nshall give a piece of bread when I have\ndipped it.\" And having dipped the bread,\nHe gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of\nSimon.\nNow after the piece of bread, Satan\nentered him. Then Jesus said to him,\n\"What you do, do quickly.\"\nBut no one at the table knew for what\nreason He said this to him.\nFor some thought, because Judas had\nthe money box, that Jesus had said to\nhim, \"Buy those things we need for the\nfeast,\" or that he should give something\nto the poor.\nHaving received the piece of bread, he\nthen went out immediately. And it was\nnight.\nWhen Jesus had said these things, He\nwas troubled in spirit, and testified and\nsaid, \"Most assuredly, I say to you, one\nof you will betray Me.\"\nSo, when he had gone out, Jesus said,\n\"Now the Son of Man is glorified, and\nGod is glorified in Him.\nIf God is glorified in Him, God will also\nglorify Him in Himself, and glorify Him\nimmediately.\nMyself; that where I am, there you may\nbe also.\nLittle children, I shall be with you a\nlittle while longer. You will seek Me; and\nas I said to the Jews, \"Where I am going,\nyou cannot come,' so now I say to you.\nAnd where I go you know, and the way\nyou know.\"\nThomas said to Him, \"Lord, we do not\nknow where You are going, and how\ncan we know the way?\"\nA new commandment I give to you,\nthat you love one another; as I have\nloved you, that you also love one\nanother.\nJesus said to him, \"I am the way, the\ntruth, and the life. No one comes to the\nFather except through Me.\nBy this all will know that you are My\ndisciples, if you have love for one\nanother.\"\n\"If you had known Me, you would have\nknown My Father also; and from now on\nyou know Him and have seen Him.\"\nSimon Peter said to Him, \"Lord, where\nare You going?\" Jesus answered him,\n\"Where I am going you cannot follow Me\nnow, but you shall follow Me afterward.\"\nPhilip said to Him, \"Lord, show us the\nFather, and it is sufficient for us.\"\nPeter said to Him, \"Lord, why can I not\nfollow You now? I will lay down my life\nfor Your sake.\"\nJesus said to him, \"Have I been with\nyou so long, and yet you have not\nknown Me, Philip? He who has seen Me\nhas seen the Father; so how can you\nsay, \"Show us the Father'?\nJesus answered him, \"Will you lay\ndown your life for My sake?

The\nservant's name was Malchus.\nSo Jesus said to Peter, \"Put your\nsword into the sheath. Shall I not drink\nthe cup which My Father has given\nMe?\"\nThen the detachment of troops and the\ncaptain and the officers of the Jews\narrested Jesus and bound Him.\nAnd they led Him away to Annas first,\nfor he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas\nwho was high priest that year.\nAnd Peter stood with them and warmed\nhimself.\nThe high priest then asked Jesus\nabout His disciples and His doctrine.\nJesus answered him, \"I spoke openly\nto the world. I always taught in\nsynagogues and in the temple, where\nthe Jews always meet, and in secret I\nhave said nothing.\nWhy do you ask Me? Ask those who\nhave heard Me what I said to them.\nIndeed they know what I said.\"\nNow it was Caiaphas who advised the\nJews that it was expedient that one man\nshould die for the people.\nAnd when He had said these things,\none of the officers who stood by struck\nJesus with the palm of his hand, saying,\n\"Do You answer the high priest like\nthat?\"\nAnd Simon Peter followed Jesus, and\nso did another disciple. Now that\ndisciple was known to the high priest,\nand went with Jesus into the courtyard\nof the high priest.\nBut Peter stood at the door outside.\nThen the other disciple, who was known\nto the high priest, went out and spoke to\nher who kept the door, and brought\nPeter in.\nThen the servant girl who kept the\ndoor said to Peter, \"You are not also\none of this Man's disciples, are you?\" He\nsaid, \"I am not.\"\nNow the servants and officers who had\nmade a fire of coals stood there, for it\nwas cold, and they warmed themselves.\nJesus answered him, \"If I have spoken\nevil, bear witness of the evil; but if well,\nwhy do you strike Me?\"\nThen Annas sent Him bound to\nCaiaphas the high priest.\nNow Simon Peter stood and warmed\nhimself. Therefore they said to him,\n\"You are not also one of His disciples,\nare you?\" He denied it and said, \"I am\nnot!\"\nOne of the servants of the high priest,\na relative of him whose ear Peter cut off,\nsaid, \"Did I not see you in the garden\nwith Him?\"\nPeter then denied again;\nimmediately a rooster crowed.\nand\nThen they led Jesus from Caiaphas to\nthe Praetorium, and it was early morning.\nBut they themselves did not go into the\nPraetorium, lest they should be defiled,\nbut that they might eat the Passover.\nPilate then went out to them and said,\n\"What accusation do you bring against\nthis Man?\"\nThey answered and said to him, \"If He\nwere not an evildoer, we would not have\ndelivered Him up to you.\"\nThen Pilate said to them, \"You take\nHim and judge Him according to your\nlaw.\" Therefore the Jews said to him, \"It\nis not lawful for us to put anyone to\ndeath,\"\nthat the saying of Jesus might be\nfulfilled which He spoke, signifying by\nwhat death He would die.\nThen Pilate entered the Praetorium\nagain, called Jesus, and said to Him,\n\"Are You the King of the Jews?\"\nJesus answered him, \"Are you\nspeaking for yourself about this, or did\nothers tell you this concerning Me?\"\nPilate answered, \"Am I a Jew? Your\nown nation and the chief priests have\ndelivered You to me. What have You\ndone?\"\nJesus answered, \"My kingdom is not\nof this world. If My kingdom were of this\nworld, My servants would fight, so that I\nshould not be delivered to the Jews; but\nnow My kingdom is not from here.\"\nPilate therefore said to Him, \"Are You\na king then?\" Jesus answered, \"You say\nrightly that I am a king. For this cause I\nwas born, and for this cause I have\ncome into the world, that I should bear\nwitness to the truth. Everyone who is of\nthe truth hears My voice.\"\nPilate said to Him, \"What is truth?\" And\nwhen he had said this, he went out\nagain to the Jews, and said to them, \"I\nfind no fault in Him at all.\n\"But you have a custom that I should\nrelease someone to you at the Passover.\nDo you therefore want me to release to\nyou the King of the Jews?\"\nThen they all cried again, saying, \"Not\nthis Man, but Barabbas!\" Now Barabbas\nwas a robber.\n19So then Pilate took Jesus and\nscourged Him.\nAnd the soldiers twisted a crown of\nthorns and put it on His head, and they\nput on Him a purple robe.\nThen they said, \"Hail, King of the\nJews!\" And they struck Him with their\nhands.\nPilate then went out again, and said to\nthem, \"Behold, I am bringing Him out to\nyou, that you may know that I find no\nfault in Him.\"\nThen Jesus came out, wearing the\ncrown of thorns and the purple robe.\nAnd Pilate said to them, \"Behold the\nMan!\"\nTherefore, when the chief priests and\nofficers saw Him, they cried out, saying,\n\"Crucify Him, crucify Him!\" Pilate said to\nthem, \"You take Him and crucify Him,\nfor I find no fault in Him.\"\nThe Jews answered him, \"We have a\nlaw, and according to our law He ought\nto die, because He made Himself the\nSon of God.\"\nNow it was the Preparation Day of the\nPassover, and about the sixth hour. And\nhe said to the Jews, \"Behold your King!\"\nBut they cried out, \"Away with Him,\naway with Him! Crucify Him!\" Pilate said\nto them, \"Shall I crucify your King?\" The\nchief priests answered, \"We have no\nking but Caesar!\"\nTherefore, when Pilate heard that\nsaying, he was the more afraid,\nThen he delivered Him to them to be\ncrucified. Then they took Jesus and led\nHim away.\nand went again into the Praetorium,\nand said to Jesus, \"Where are You\nfrom?\" But Jesus gave him no answer.\nAnd He, bearing His cross, went out to\na place called the Place of a Skull,\nwhich is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,\nThen Pilate said to Him, \"Are You not\nspeaking to me? Do You not know that I\nhave power to crucify You, and power to\nrelease You?\"\nwhere they crucified Him, and two\nothers with Him, one on either side, and\nJesus in the center.\nJesus answered, \"You could have no\npower at all against Me unless it had\nbeen given you from above. Therefore\nthe one who delivered Me to you has\nthe greater sin.\"\nFrom then on Pilate sought to release\nHim, but the Jews cried out, saying, \"If\nyou let this Man go, you are not\nCaesar's friend. Whoever makes himself\na king speaks against Caesar.\"\nWhen Pilate therefore heard that\nsaying, he brought Jesus out and sat\ndown in the judgment seat in a place\nthat is called The Pavement, but in\nHebrew, Gabbatha.\nNow Pilate wrote a title and put it on\nthe cross. And the writing was: JESUS\nOF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE\nJEWS.\nThen many of the Jews read this title,\nfor the place where Jesus was crucified\nwas near the city; and it was written in\nHebrew, Greek, and Latin.\nTherefore the chief priests of the Jews\nsaid to Pilate, \"Do not write, \"The King of\nthe Jews,' but, \"He said, \"I am the King\nof the Jews.\"\"'\nPilate answered, \"What I have written,\nI have written.\"\nThen the soldiers, when they had\ncrucified Jesus, took His garments and\nmade four parts, to each soldier a part,\nand also the tunic. Now the tunic was\nwithout seam, woven from the top in one\npiece.\n(for that Sabbath was a high day), the\nJews asked Pilate that their legs might\nbe broken, and that they might be taken\naway.\nThey\nsaid\ntherefore\namong\nthemselves, \"Let us not tear it, but cast\nlots for it, whose it shall be,\" that the\nScripture might be fulfilled which says:\n\"They divided My garments among them,\nAnd for My clothing they cast lots.\"\nTherefore the soldiers did these things.\nThen the soldiers came and broke the\nlegs of the first and of the other who was\ncrucified with Him.\nBut when they came to Jesus and saw\nthat He was already dead, they did not\nbreak His legs.\nNow there stood by the cross of Jesus\nHis mother, and His mother's sister,\nMary the wife of Clopas, and Mary\nMagdalene.\nBut one of the soldiers pierced His\nside with a spear, and immediately\nblood and water came out.\nWhen Jesus therefore saw His mother,\nand the disciple whom He loved\nstanding by, He said to His mother,\n\"Woman, behold your son!\"\nAnd he who has seen has testified,\nand his testimony is true; and he knows\nthat he is telling the truth, so that you\nmay believe.\nThen He said to the disciple, \"Behold\nyour mother!\" And from that hour that\ndisciple took her to his own home.\nFor these things were done that the\nScripture should be fulfilled, \"Not one of\nHis bones shall be broken.\"\nAfter this, Jesus, knowing that all\nthings were now accomplished, that the\nScripture might be fulfilled, said, \"I\nthirst!\"\nAnd again another Scripture says,\n\"They shall look on Him whom they\npierced.\"\nNow a vessel full of sour wine was\nsitting there; and they filled a sponge\nwith sour wine, put it on hyssop, and put\nit to His mouth.\nSo when Jesus had received the sour\nwine, He said, \"It is finished!\" And\nbowing His head, He gave up His spirit.\nTherefore, because it was the\nPreparation Day, that the bodies should\nnot remain on the cross on the Sabbath\nAfter this, Joseph of Arimathea, being\na disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear\nof the Jews, asked Pilate that he might\ntake away the body of Jesus; and Pilate\ngave him permission. So he came and\ntook the body of Jesus.\nAnd Nicodemus, who at first came to\nJesus by night, also came, bringing a\nmixture of myrrh and aloes, about a\nhundred pounds.\nThen they took the body of Jesus, and\nbound it in strips of linen with the spices,\nas the custom of the Jews is to bury.\nand the handkerchief that had been\naround His head, not lying with the linen\ncloths, but folded together in a place by\nitself.\nNow in the place where He was\ncrucified there was a garden, and in the\ngarden a new tomb in which no one had\nyet been laid.\nThen the other disciple, who came to\nthe tomb first, went in also; and he saw\nand believed.\nSo there they laid Jesus, because of\nthe Jews' Preparation Day, for the tomb\nwas nearby.\nFor as yet they did not know the\nScripture, that He must rise again from\nthe dead.\n20Now the first day of the week\nThen the disciples went away again to\ntheir own homes.\nMary Magdalene went to the tomb early,\nwhile it was still dark, and saw that the\nstone had been taken away from the\ntomb.\nBut Mary stood outside by the tomb\nweeping, and as she wept she stooped\ndown and looked into the tomb.\nThen she ran and came to Simon Peter,\nand to the other disciple, whom Jesus\nloved, and said to them, \"They have\ntaken away the Lord out of the tomb,\nand we do not know where they have\nlaid Him.\"\nPeter therefore went out, and the other\ndisciple, and were going to the tomb.\nAnd she saw two angels in white\nsitting, one at the head and the other at\nthe feet, where the body of Jesus had\nlain.\nThen they said to her, \"Woman, why\nare you weeping?\" She said to them,\n\"Because they have taken away my\nLord, and I do not know where they\nhave laid Him.\"\nSo they both ran together, and the\nother disciple outran Peter and came to\nthe tomb first.\nAnd he, stooping down and looking in,\nsaw the linen cloths lying there; yet he\ndid not go in.\nThen Simon Peter came, following him,\nand went into the tomb; and he saw the\nlinen cloths lying there,\nNow when she had said this, she\nturned around and saw Jesus standing\nthere, and did not know that it was\nJesus.\nJesus said to her, \"Woman, why are\nyou weeping? Whom are you seeking?\"\nShe, supposing Him to be the gardener,\nsaid to Him, \"Sir, if You have carried\nHim away, tell me where You have laid\nHim, and I will take Him away.\"\nJesus said to her, \"Mary!\" She turned\nand said to Him, \"Rabboni!\" (which is to\nsay, Teacher).\nJesus said to her, \"Do not cling to Me,\nfor I have not yet ascended to My\nFather; but go to My brethren and say to\nthem, \"I am ascending to My Father and\nyour Father, and to My God and your\nGod.\"'\nMary Magdalene came and told the\ndisciples that she had seen the Lord,\nand that He had spoken these things to\nher.\nThen, the same day at evening, being\nthe first day of the week, when the doors\nwere shut where the disciples were\nassembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus\ncame and stood in the midst, and said to\nthem, \"Peace be with you.\"\nThe other disciples therefore said to\nhim, \"We have seen the Lord.\" So he\nsaid to them, \"Unless I see in His hands\nthe print of the nails, and put my finger\ninto the print of the nails, and put my\nhand into His side, I will not believe.\"\nAnd after eight days His disciples were\nagain inside, and Thomas with them.\nJesus came, the doors being shut, and\nstood in the midst, and said, \"Peace to\nyou!\"\nThen He said to Thomas, \"Reach your\nfinger here, and look at My hands; and\nreach your hand here, and put it into My\nside. Do not be unbelieving, but\nbelieving.\"\nAnd Thomas answered and said to\nHim, \"My Lord and my God!\"\nWhen He had said this, He showed\nthem His hands and His side. Then the\ndisciples were glad when they saw the\nLord.\nJesus said to him, \"Thomas, because\nyou have seen Me, you have believed.\nBlessed are those who have not seen\nand yet have believed.\"\nSo Jesus said to them again, \"Peace\nto you! As the Father has sent Me, I also\nsend you.\"\nAnd truly Jesus did many other signs\nin the presence of His disciples, which\nare not written in this book;\nAnd when He had said this, He\nbreathed on them, and said to them,\n\"Receive the Holy Spirit.\nIf you forgive the sins of any, they are\nforgiven them; if you retain the sins of\nany, they are retained.\"\nNow Thomas, called the Twin, one of\nthe twelve, was not with them when\nJesus came.\nbut these are written that you may\nbelieve that Jesus is the Christ, the Son\nof God, and that believing you may have\nlife in His name.\n21After these things Jesus showed\nHimself again to the disciples at the Sea\nof Tiberias, and in this way He showed\nHimself:\nSimon Peter, Thomas called the Twin,\nNathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons\nof Zebedee, and two others of His\ndisciples were together.\nSimon Peter went up and dragged the\nnet to land, full of large fish, one\nhundred and fifty-three; and although\nthere were so many, the net was not\nbroken.\nSimon Peter said to them, \"I am going\nfishing.\" They said to him, \"We are going\nwith you also.\" They went out and\nimmediately got into the boat, and that\nnight they caught nothing.\nJesus said to them, \"Come and eat\nbreakfast.\" Yet none of the disciples\ndared ask Him, \"Who are You?\"-knowing that it was the Lord.\nBut when the morning had now come,\nJesus stood on the shore; yet the\ndisciples did not know that it was Jesus.\nJesus then came and took the bread\nand gave it to them, and likewise the\nfish.\nThen Jesus said to them, \"Children,\nhave you any food?\" They answered\nHim, \"No.\"\nThis is now the third time Jesus\nshowed Himself to His disciples after He\nwas raised from the dead.\nAnd He said to them, \"Cast the net on\nthe right side of the boat, and you will\nfind some.\" So they cast, and now they\nwere not able to draw it in because of\nthe multitude of fish.\nSo when they had eaten breakfast,\nJesus said to Simon Peter, \"Simon, son\nof Jonah, do you love Me more than\nthese?\" He said to Him, \"Yes, Lord; You\nknow that I love You.\" He said to him,\n\"Feed My lambs.\"\nTherefore that disciple whom Jesus\nloved said to Peter, \"It is the Lord!\" Now\nwhen Simon Peter heard that it was the\nLord, he put on his outer garment (for he\nhad removed it), and plunged into the\nsea.\nHe said to him again a second time,\n\"Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me?\"\nHe said to Him, \"Yes, Lord; You know\nthat I love You.\" He said to him, \"Tend\nMy sheep.\"\nBut the other disciples came in the little\nboat (for they were not far from land, but\nabout two hundred cubits), dragging the\nnet with fish.\nThen, as soon as they had come to\nland, they saw a fire of coals there, and\nfish laid on it, and bread.\nJesus said to them, \"Bring some of the\nfish which you have just caught.\"\nHe said to him the third time, \"Simon,\nson of Jonah, do you love Me?\" Peter\nwas grieved because He said to him the\nthird time, \"Do you love Me?\" And he\nsaid to Him, \"Lord, You know all things;\nYou know that I love You.\" Jesus said to\nhim, \"Feed My sheep.\nMost assuredly, I say to you, when you\nwere younger, you girded yourself and\nwalked where you wished; but when you\nare old, you will stretch out your hands,\nand another will gird you and carry you\nwhere you do not wish.\"\nJesus said to him, \"If I will that he\nremain till I come, what is that to you?\nYou follow Me.\"\nThis He spoke, signifying by what\ndeath he would glorify God. And when\nHe had spoken this, He said to him,\n\"Follow Me.\"\nThen this saying went out among the\nbrethren that this disciple would not die.\nYet Jesus did not say to him that he\nwould not die, but, \"If I will that he\nremain till I come, what is that to you?\"\nThen Peter, turning around, saw the\ndisciple whom Jesus loved following,\nwho also had leaned on His breast at\nthe supper, and said, \"Lord, who is the\none who betrays You?\"\nThis is the disciple who testifies of\nthese things, and wrote these things;\nand we know that his testimony is true.\nPeter, seeing him, said to Jesus, \"But\nLord, what about this man?\"\nAnd there are also many other things\nthat Jesus did, which if they were written\none by one, I suppose that even the\nworld itself could not contain the books\nthat would be written. Amen.\nActs\n1The former account I made, O\nTheophilus, of all that Jesus began both\nto do and teach,\nuntil the day in which He was taken up,\nafter He through the Holy Spirit had\ngiven commandments to the apostles\nwhom He had chosen,\nto whom He also presented Himself\nalive after His suffering by many\ninfallible proofs, being seen by them\nduring forty days and speaking of the\nthings pertaining to the kingdom of God.\nAnd being assembled together with\nthem, He commanded them not to\ndepart from Jerusalem, but to wait for\nthe Promise of the Father, \"which,\" He\nsaid, \"you have heard from Me;\nfor John truly baptized with water, but\nyou shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit\nnot many days from now.\"\nTherefore, when they had come\ntogether, they asked Him, saying, \"Lord,\nwill You at this time restore the kingdom\nto Israel?\"\nAnd He said to them, \"It is not for you\nto know times or seasons which the\nFather has put in His own authority.\nBut you shall receive power when the\nHoly Spirit has come upon you; and you\nshall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem,\nand in all Judea and Samaria, and to the\nend of the earth.\"\nNow when He had spoken these things,\nwhile they watched, He was taken up,\nand a cloud received Him out of their\nsight.\nAnd while they looked steadfastly\ntoward heaven as He went up, behold,\ntwo men stood by them in white apparel,\nwho also said, \"Men of Galilee, why do\nyou stand gazing up into heaven? This\nsame Jesus, who was taken up from\nyou into heaven, will so come in like\nmanner as you saw Him go into\nheaven.\"\nThen they returned to Jerusalem from\nthe mount called Olivet, which is near\nJerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey.\nAnd when they had entered, they went\nup into the upper room where they were\nstaying: Peter, James, John, and\nAndrew;\nPhilip\nand\nThomas;\nBartholomew and Matthew; James the\nson of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot;\nand Judas the son of James.\nThese all continued with one accord in\nprayer and supplication, with the women\nand Mary the mother of Jesus, and with\nHis brothers.\nAnd in those days Peter stood up in\nthe midst of the disciples (altogether the\nnumber of names was about a hundred\nand twenty), and said,\n\"Men and brethren, this Scripture had\nto be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit\nspoke before by the mouth of David\nconcerning Judas, who became a guide\nto those who arrested Jesus;\nfor he was numbered with us and\nobtained a part in this ministry.\"\n(Now this man purchased a field with\nthe wages of iniquity; and falling\nheadlong, he burst open in the middle\nand all his entrails gushed out.\nAnd it became known to all those\ndwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is\ncalled in their own language, Akel Dama,\nthat is, Field of Blood.)\n\"For it is written in the Book of Psalms:\n\"Let his dwelling place be desolate, And\nlet no one live in it'; and, \"Let another\ntake his office.'\n\"Therefore, of these men who have\naccompanied us all the time that the\nLord Jesus went in and out among us,\nbeginning from the baptism of John to\nthat day when He was taken up from us,\none of these must become a witness\nwith us of His resurrection.\"\nAnd they proposed two: Joseph called\nBarsabas, who was surnamed Justus,\nand Matthias.\nAnd they prayed and said, \"You, O\nLord, who know the hearts of all, show\nwhich of these two You have chosen\nto take part in this ministry and\napostleship from which Judas by\ntransgression fell, that he might go to his\nown place.\"\nAnd they cast their lots, and the lot fell\non Matthias. And he was numbered with\nthe eleven apostles.\n2When the Day of Pentecost had fully\ncome, they were all with one accord in\none place.\nAnd suddenly there came a sound from\nheaven, as of a rushing mighty wind,\nand it filled the whole house where they\nwere sitting.\nThen there appeared to them divided\ntongues, as of fire, and one sat upon\neach of them.\nAnd they were all filled with the Holy\nSpirit and began to speak with other\ntongues, as the Spirit gave them\nutterance.\nAnd there were dwelling in Jerusalem\nJews, devout men, from every nation\nunder heaven.\nAnd when this sound occurred, the\nmultitude came together, and were\nconfused, because everyone heard\nthem speak in his own language.\nThen they were all amazed and\nmarveled, saying to one another, \"Look,\nare not all these who speak Galileans?\nAnd how is it that we hear, each in our\nown language in which we were born?\nParthians and Medes and Elamites,\nthose dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judea\nand Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,\nPhrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the\nparts of Libya adjoining Cyrene, visitors\nfrom Rome, both Jews and proselytes,\nI will show wonders in heaven above\nAnd signs in the earth beneath: Blood\nand fire and vapor of smoke.\nThe sun shall be turned into darkness,\nAnd the moon into blood, Before the\ncoming of the great and awesome day\nof the LORD.\nCretans and Arabs--we hear them\nspeaking in our own tongues the\nwonderful works of God.\"\nAnd it shall come to pass That\nwhoever calls on the name of the LORD\nShall be saved.'\nSo they were all amazed and\nperplexed, saying to one another,\n\"Whatever could this mean?\"\nOthers mocking said, \"They are full of\nnew wine.\"\n\"Men of Israel, hear these words:\nJesus of Nazareth, a Man attested by\nGod to you by miracles, wonders, and\nsigns which God did through Him in your\nmidst, as you yourselves also know--\nBut Peter, standing up with the eleven,\nraised his voice and said to them, \"Men\nof Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem,\nlet this be known to you, and heed my\nwords.\nFor these are not drunk, as you\nsuppose, since it is only the third hour of\nthe day.\nBut this is what was spoken by the\nprophet Joel:\nHim,\nbeing\ndelivered\nby\nthe\ndetermined purpose and foreknowledge\nof God, you have taken by lawless\nhands, have crucified, and put to death;\nwhom God raised up, having loosed\nthe pains of death, because it was not\npossible that He should be held by it.\nFor David says concerning Him: \"I\nforesaw the LORD always before my\nface, For He is at my right hand, that I\nmay not be shaken.\n\"And it shall come to pass in the last\ndays, says God, That I will pour out of\nMy Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and\nyour daughters shall prophesy, Your\nyoung men shall see visions, Your old\nmen shall dream dreams.\nAnd on My menservants and on My\nmaidservants I will pour out My Spirit in\nthose days; And they shall prophesy.\nTherefore my heart rejoiced, and my\ntongue was glad; Moreover my flesh\nalso will rest in hope.\nFor You will not leave my soul in\nHades, Nor will You allow Your Holy\nOne to see corruption.\nYou have made known to me the ways\nof life; You will make me full of joy in\nYour presence.'\nNow when they heard this, they were\ncut to the heart, and said to Peter and\nthe rest of the apostles, \"Men and\nbrethren, what shall we do?\"\n\"Men and brethren, let me speak freely\nto you of the patriarch David, that he is\nboth dead and buried, and his tomb is\nwith us to this day.\nTherefore, being a prophet, and\nknowing that God had sworn with an\noath to him that of the fruit of his body,\naccording to the flesh, He would raise\nup the Christ to sit on his throne,\nhe, foreseeing this, spoke concerning\nthe resurrection of the Christ, that His\nsoul was not left in Hades, nor did His\nflesh see corruption.\nThen Peter said to them, \"Repent, and\nlet every one of you be baptized in the\nname of Jesus Christ for the remission\nof sins; and you shall receive the gift of\nthe Holy Spirit.\nFor the promise is to you and to your\nchildren, and to all who are afar off, as\nmany as the Lord our God will call.\"\nAnd with many other words he testified\nand exhorted them, saying, \"Be saved\nfrom this perverse generation.\"\nThis Jesus God has raised up, of\nwhich we are all witnesses.\nThen those who gladly received his\nword were baptized; and that day about\nthree thousand souls were added to\nthem.\nTherefore being exalted to the right\nhand of God, and having received from\nthe Father the promise of the Holy Spirit,\nHe poured out this which you now see\nand hear.\nAnd they continued steadfastly in the\napostles' doctrine and fellowship, in the\nbreaking of bread, and in prayers.\n\"For David did not ascend into the\nheavens, but he says himself: \"The\nLORD said to my Lord, \"Sit at My right\nhand,\nTill I make\nfootstool.\"'\nYour\nenemies\nThen fear came upon every soul, and\nmany wonders and signs were done\nthrough the apostles.\nNow all who believed were together,\nand had all things in common,\nYour\n\"Therefore let all the house of Israel\nknow assuredly that God has made this\nJesus, whom you crucified, both Lord\nand Christ.\"\nand sold their possessions and goods,\nand divided them among all, as anyone\nhad need.\nSo continuing daily with one accord in\nthe temple, and breaking bread from\nhouse to house, they ate their food with\ngladness and simplicity of heart,\npraising God and having favor with all\nthe people. And the Lord added to the\nchurch daily those who were being\nsaved.\n3Now Peter and John went up\ntogether to the temple at the hour of\nprayer, the ninth hour.\nAnd a certain man lame from his\nmother's womb was carried, whom they\nlaid daily at the gate of the temple which\nis called Beautiful, to ask alms from\nthose who entered the temple;\nwho, seeing Peter and John about to\ngo into the temple, asked for alms.\nAnd fixing his eyes on him, with John,\nPeter said, \"Look at us.\"\nSo he gave them his attention,\nexpecting to receive something from\nthem.\nThen Peter said, \"Silver and gold I do\nnot have, but what I do have I give you:\nIn the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,\nrise up and walk.\"\nAnd he took him by the right hand and\nlifted him up, and immediately his feet\nand ankle bones received strength.\nSo he, leaping up, stood and walked\nand entered the temple with them-walking, leaping, and praising God.\nAnd all the people saw him walking and\npraising God.\nThen they knew that it was he who sat\nbegging alms at the Beautiful Gate of\nthe temple; and they were filled with\nwonder and amazement at what had\nhappened to him.\nNow as the lame man who was healed\nheld on to Peter and John, all the people\nran together to them in the porch which\nis called Solomon's, greatly amazed.\nSo when Peter saw it, he responded to\nthe people: \"Men of Israel, why do you\nmarvel at this? Or why look so intently at\nus, as though by our own power or\ngodliness we had made this man walk?\nThe God of Abraham, Isaac, and\nJacob, the God of our fathers, glorified\nHis Servant Jesus, whom you delivered\nup and denied in the presence of Pilate,\nwhen he was determined to let Him go.\nBut you denied the Holy One and the\nJust, and asked for a murderer to be\ngranted to you,\nand killed the Prince of life, whom God\nraised from the dead, of which we are\nwitnesses.\nAnd His name, through faith in His\nname, has made this man strong, whom\nyou see and know. Yes, the faith which\ncomes through Him has given him this\nperfect soundness in the presence of\nyou all.\n\"Yet now, brethren, I know that you did\nit in ignorance, as did also your rulers.\nBut those things which God foretold by\nthe mouth of all His prophets, that the\nChrist would suffer, He has thus fulfilled.\nRepent therefore and be converted,\nthat your sins may be blotted out, so\nthat times of refreshing may come from\nthe presence of the Lord,\nand that He may send Jesus Christ,\nwho was preached to you before,\nwhom heaven must receive until the\ntimes of restoration of all things, which\nGod has spoken by the mouth of all His\nholy prophets since the world began.\nFor Moses truly said to the fathers,\n\"The LORD your God will raise up for\nyou a Prophet like me from your\nbrethren. Him you shall hear in all things,\nwhatever He says to you.\nAnd it shall be that every soul who will\nnot hear that Prophet shall be utterly\ndestroyed from among the people.'\nYes, and all the prophets, from\nSamuel and those who follow, as many\nas have spoken, have also foretold\nthese days.\nYou are sons of the prophets, and of\nthe covenant which God made with our\nfathers, saying to Abraham, \"And in your\nseed all the families of the earth shall be\nblessed.'\nTo you first, God, having raised up His\nServant Jesus, sent Him to bless you, in\nturning away every one of you from your\niniquities.\"\n4Now as they spoke to the people, the\npriests, the captain of the temple, and\nthe Sadducees came upon them,\nbeing greatly disturbed that they taught\nthe people and preached in Jesus the\nresurrection from the dead.\nAnd they laid hands on them, and put\nthem in custody until the next day, for it\nwas already evening.\nHowever, many of those who heard the\nword believed; and the number of the\nmen came to be about five thousand.\nAnd it came to pass, on the next day,\nthat their rulers, elders, and scribes,\nas well as Annas the high priest,\nCaiaphas, John, and Alexander, and as\nmany as were of the family of the high\npriest, were gathered together at\nJerusalem.\nAnd when they had set them in the\nmidst, they asked, \"By what power or by\nwhat name have you done this?\"\nThen Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit,\nsaid to them, \"Rulers of the people and\nelders of Israel:\nIf we this day are judged for a good\ndeed done to a helpless man, by what\nmeans he has been made well,\nlet it be known to you all, and to all the\npeople of Israel, that by the name of\nJesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you\ncrucified, whom God raised from the\ndead, by Him this man stands here\nbefore you whole.\nof God to listen to you more than to God,\nyou judge.\nThis is the \"stone which was rejected\nby you builders, which has become the\nchief cornerstone.'\nFor we cannot but speak the things\nwhich we have seen and heard.\"\nNor is there salvation in any other, for\nthere is no other name under heaven\ngiven among men by which we must be\nsaved.\"\nSo when they had further threatened\nthem, they let them go, finding no way of\npunishing them, because of the people,\nsince they all glorified God for what had\nbeen done.\nNow when they saw the boldness of\nPeter and John, and perceived that they\nwere uneducated and untrained men,\nthey marveled. And they realized that\nthey had been with Jesus.\nAnd seeing the man who had been\nhealed standing with them, they could\nsay nothing against it.\nFor the man was over forty years old\non whom this miracle of healing had\nbeen performed.\nAnd being let go, they went to their\nown companions and reported all that\nthe chief priests and elders had said to\nthem.\nBut when they had commanded them\nto go aside out of the council, they\nconferred among themselves,\nSo when they heard that, they raised\ntheir voice to God with one accord and\nsaid: \"Lord, You are God, who made\nheaven and earth and the sea, and all\nthat is in them,\nsaying, \"What shall we do to these\nmen? For, indeed, that a notable miracle\nhas been done through them is evident\nto all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we\ncannot deny it.\nwho by the mouth of Your servant\nDavid have said: \"Why did the nations\nrage, And the people plot vain things?\nBut so that it spreads no further\namong the people, let us severely\nthreaten them, that from now on they\nspeak to no man in this name.\"\nThe kings of the earth took their stand,\nAnd the rulers were gathered together\nAgainst the LORD and against His\nChrist.'\nSo they called them and commanded\nthem not to speak at all nor teach in the\nname of Jesus.\nBut Peter and John answered and said\nto them, \"Whether it is right in the sight\n\"For truly against Your holy Servant\nJesus, whom You anointed, both Herod\nand Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and\nthe people of Israel, were gathered\ntogether\nto do whatever Your hand and Your\npurpose determined before to be done.\nhaving land, sold it, and brought the\nmoney and laid it at the apostles' feet.\n5But a certain man named Ananias,\nNow, Lord, look on their threats, and\ngrant to Your servants that with all\nboldness they may speak Your word,\nby stretching out Your hand to heal,\nand that signs and wonders may be\ndone through the name of Your holy\nServant Jesus.\"\nAnd when they had prayed, the place\nwhere they were assembled together\nwas shaken; and they were all filled with\nthe Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word\nof God with boldness.\nNow the multitude of those who\nbelieved were of one heart and one\nsoul; neither did anyone say that any of\nthe things he possessed was his own,\nbut they had all things in common.\nAnd with great power the apostles\ngave witness to the resurrection of the\nLord Jesus. And great grace was upon\nthem all.\nNor was there anyone among them\nwho lacked; for all who were possessors\nof lands or houses sold them, and\nbrought the proceeds of the things that\nwere sold,\nand laid them at the apostles' feet; and\nthey distributed to each as anyone had\nneed.\nAnd Joses, who was also named\nBarnabas by the apostles (which is\ntranslated Son of Encouragement), a\nLevite of the country of Cyprus,\nwith Sapphira\npossession.\nhis\nwife,\nsold\na\nAnd he kept back part of the proceeds,\nhis wife also being aware of it, and\nbrought a certain part and laid it at the\napostles' feet.\nBut Peter said, \"Ananias, why has\nSatan filled your heart to lie to the Holy\nSpirit and keep back part of the price of\nthe land for yourself?\nWhile it remained, was it not your own?\nAnd after it was sold, was it not in your\nown control? Why have you conceived\nthis thing in your heart? You have not\nlied to men but to God.\"\nThen Ananias, hearing these words, fell\ndown and breathed his last. So great\nfear came upon all those who heard\nthese things.\nAnd the young men arose and wrapped\nhim up, carried him out, and buried him.\nNow it was about three hours later\nwhen his wife came in, not knowing\nwhat had happened.\nAnd Peter answered her, \"Tell me\nwhether you sold the land for so much?\"\nShe said, \"Yes, for so much.\"\nThen Peter said to her, \"How is it that\nyou have agreed together to test the\nSpirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of\nthose who have buried your husband\nare at the door, and they will carry you\nout.\"\nand laid their hands on the apostles\nand put them in the common prison.\nThen immediately she fell down at his\nfeet and breathed her last. And the\nyoung men came in and found her dead,\nand carrying her out, buried her by her\nhusband.\nSo great fear came upon all the church\nand upon all who heard these things.\nBut at night an angel of the Lord\nopened the prison doors and brought\nthem out, and said,\n\"Go, stand in the temple and speak to\nthe people all the words of this life.\"\nAnd through the hands of the apostles\nmany signs and wonders were done\namong the people. And they were all\nwith one accord in Solomon's Porch.\nAnd when they heard that, they\nentered the temple early in the morning\nand taught. But the high priest and\nthose with him came and called the\ncouncil together, with all the elders of\nthe children of Israel, and sent to the\nprison to have them brought.\nYet none of the rest dared join them,\nbut the people esteemed them highly.\nBut when the officers came and did\nnot find them in the prison, they returned\nand reported,\nAnd believers were increasingly added\nto the Lord, multitudes of both men and\nwomen,\nso that they brought the sick out into\nthe streets and laid them on beds and\ncouches, that at least the shadow of\nPeter passing by might fall on some of\nthem.\nsaying, \"Indeed we found the prison\nshut securely, and the guards standing\noutside before the doors; but when we\nopened them, we found no one inside!\"\nNow when the high priest, the captain\nof the temple, and the chief priests\nheard these things, they wondered what\nthe outcome would be.\nAlso a multitude gathered from the\nsurrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing\nsick people and those who were\ntormented by unclean spirits, and they\nwere all healed.\nSo one came and told them, saying,\n\"Look, the men whom you put in prison\nare standing in the temple and teaching\nthe people!\"\nThen the high priest rose up, and all\nthose who were with him (which is the\nsect of the Sadducees), and they were\nfilled with indignation,\nThen the captain went with the officers\nand brought them without violence, for\nthey feared the people, lest they should\nbe stoned.\nAnd when they had brought them, they\nset them before the council. And the\nhigh priest asked them,\nmen, about four hundred, joined him. He\nwas slain, and all who obeyed him were\nscattered and came to nothing.\nsaying, \"Did we not strictly command\nyou not to teach in this name? And look,\nyou have filled Jerusalem with your\ndoctrine, and intend to bring this Man's\nblood on us!\"\nAfter this man, Judas of Galilee rose\nup in the days of the census, and drew\naway many people after him. He also\nperished, and all who obeyed him were\ndispersed.\nBut Peter and the other apostles\nanswered and said: \"We ought to obey\nGod rather than men.\nAnd now I say to you, keep away from\nthese men and let them alone; for if this\nplan or this work is of men, it will come\nto nothing;\nThe God of our fathers raised up\nJesus whom you murdered by hanging\non a tree.\nbut if it is of God, you cannot\noverthrow it--lest you even be found to\nfight against God.\"\nHim God has exalted to His right hand\nto be Prince and Savior, to give\nrepentance to Israel and forgiveness of\nsins.\nAnd we are His witnesses to these\nthings, and so also is the Holy Spirit\nwhom God has given to those who obey\nHim.\"\nWhen they heard this, they were\nfurious and plotted to kill them.\nThen one in the council stood up, a\nPharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of\nthe law held in respect by all the people,\nand commanded them to put the\napostles outside for a little while.\nAnd they agreed with him, and when\nthey had called for the apostles and\nbeaten them, they commanded that they\nshould not speak in the name of Jesus,\nand let them go.\nSo they departed from the presence of\nthe council, rejoicing that they were\ncounted worthy to suffer shame for His\nname.\nAnd daily in the temple, and in every\nhouse, they did not cease teaching and\npreaching Jesus as the Christ.\n6Now in those days, when the number\nAnd he said to them: \"Men of Israel,\ntake heed to yourselves what you intend\nto do regarding these men.\nof the disciples was multiplying, there\narose a complaint against the Hebrews\nby the Hellenists, because their widows\nwere neglected in the daily distribution.\nFor some time ago Theudas rose up,\nclaiming to be somebody. A number of\nThen the twelve summoned the\nmultitude of the disciples and said, \"It is\nnot desirable that we should leave the\nword of God and serve tables.\nTherefore, brethren, seek out from\namong you seven men of good\nreputation, full of the Holy Spirit and\nwisdom, whom we may appoint over this\nbusiness;\nThen they secretly induced men to say,\n\"We\nhave\nheard\nhim\nspeak\nblasphemous words against Moses and\nGod.\"\nAnd they stirred up the people, the\nelders, and the scribes; and they came\nupon him, seized him, and brought him\nto the council.\nbut we will give ourselves continually to\nprayer and to the ministry of the word.\"\nAnd the saying pleased the whole\nmultitude. And they chose Stephen, a\nman full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and\nPhilip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon,\nParmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte\nfrom Antioch,\nThey also set up false witnesses who\nsaid, \"This man does not cease to speak\nblasphemous words against this holy\nplace and the law;\nfor we have heard him say that this\nJesus of Nazareth will destroy this place\nand change the customs which Moses\ndelivered to us.\"\nwhom they set before the apostles; and\nwhen they had prayed, they laid hands\non them.\nAnd all who sat in the council, looking\nsteadfastly at him, saw his face as the\nface of an angel.\nThen the word of God spread, and the\nnumber of the disciples multiplied\ngreatly in Jerusalem, and a great many\nof the priests were obedient to the faith.\nAnd Stephen, full of faith and power,\ndid great wonders and signs among the\npeople.\nThen there arose some from what is\ncalled the Synagogue of the Freedmen\n(Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those\nfrom Cilicia and Asia), disputing with\nStephen.\nAnd they were not able to resist the\nwisdom and the Spirit by which he\nspoke.\n7Then the high priest said, \"Are these\nthings so?\"\nAnd he said, \"Brethren and fathers,\nlisten: The God of glory appeared to our\nfather Abraham when he was in\nMesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,\nand said to him, \"Get out of your\ncountry and from your relatives, and\ncome to a land that I will show you.'\nThen he came out of the land of the\nChaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And\nfrom there, when his father was dead,\nHe moved him to this land in which you\nnow dwell.\nAnd God gave him no inheritance in it,\nnot even enough to set his foot on. But\neven when Abraham had no child, He\npromised to give it to him for a\npossession, and to his descendants\nafter him.\nBut God spoke in this way: that his\ndescendants would dwell in a foreign\nland, and that they would bring them\ninto bondage and oppress them four\nhundred years.\nAnd the second time Joseph was\nmade known to his brothers, and\nJoseph's family became known to the\nPharaoh.\nThen Joseph sent and called his father\nJacob and all his relatives to him,\nseventy-five people.\nSo Jacob went down to Egypt; and he\ndied, he and our fathers.\n\"And the nation to whom they will be in\nbondage I will judge,' said God, \"and\nafter that they shall come out and serve\nMe in this place.'\nAnd they were carried back to\nShechem and laid in the tomb that\nAbraham bought for a sum of money\nfrom the sons of Hamor, the father of\nShechem.\nThen He gave him the covenant of\ncircumcision; and so Abraham begot\nIsaac and circumcised him on the eighth\nday; and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob\nbegot the twelve patriarchs.\n\"But when the time of the promise\ndrew near which God had sworn to\nAbraham, the people grew and\nmultiplied in Egypt\n\"And the patriarchs, becoming envious,\nsold Joseph into Egypt. But God was\nwith him\nand delivered him out of all his\ntroubles, and gave him favor and\nwisdom in the presence of Pharaoh,\nking of Egypt; and he made him\ngovernor over Egypt and all his house.\nNow a famine and great trouble came\nover all the land of Egypt and Canaan,\nand our fathers found no sustenance.\nBut when Jacob heard that there was\ngrain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers\nfirst.\ntill another king arose who did not\nknow Joseph.\nThis man dealt treacherously with our\npeople, and oppressed our forefathers,\nmaking them expose their babies, so\nthat they might not live.\nAt this time Moses was born, and was\nwell pleasing to God; and he was\nbrought up in his father's house for three\nmonths.\nBut when he was set out, Pharaoh's\ndaughter took him away and brought\nhim up as her own son.\nAnd Moses was learned in all the\nwisdom of the Egyptians, and was\nmighty in words and deeds.\n\"Now when he was forty years old, it\ncame into his heart to visit his brethren,\nthe children of Israel.\nand the God of Jacob.' And Moses\ntrembled and dared not look.\nAnd seeing one of them suffer wrong,\nhe defended and avenged him who was\noppressed, and struck down the\nEgyptian.\nFor he supposed that his brethren\nwould have understood that God would\ndeliver them by his hand, but they did\nnot understand.\n\"Then the LORD said to him, \"Take\nyour sandals off your feet, for the place\nwhere you stand is holy ground.\nI have surely seen the oppression of\nMy people who are in Egypt; I have\nheard their groaning and have come\ndown to deliver them. And now come, I\nwill send you to Egypt.\"'\nAnd the next day he appeared to two\nof them as they were fighting, and tried\nto reconcile them, saying, \"Men, you are\nbrethren; why do you wrong one\nanother?'\n\"This Moses whom they rejected,\nsaying, \"Who made you a ruler and a\njudge?' is the one God sent to be a ruler\nand a deliverer by the hand of the Angel\nwho appeared to him in the bush.\nBut he who did his neighbor wrong\npushed him away, saying, \"Who made\nyou a ruler and a judge over us?\nHe brought them out, after he had\nshown wonders and signs in the land of\nEgypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the\nwilderness forty years.\nDo you want to kill me as you did the\nEgyptian yesterday?'\nThen, at this saying, Moses fled and\nbecame a dweller in the land of Midian,\nwhere he had two sons.\n\"And when forty years had passed, an\nAngel of the Lord appeared to him in a\nflame of fire in a bush, in the wilderness\nof Mount Sinai.\nWhen Moses saw it, he marveled at\nthe sight; and as he drew near to\nobserve, the voice of the Lord came to\nhim,\nsaying, \"I am the God of your fathers-the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,\n\"This is that Moses who said to the\nchildren of Israel, \"The LORD your God\nwill raise up for you a Prophet like me\nfrom your brethren. Him you shall hear.'\n\"This is he who was in the\ncongregation in the wilderness with the\nAngel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai,\nand with our fathers, the one who\nreceived the living oracles to give to us,\nwhom our fathers would not obey, but\nrejected. And in their hearts they turned\nback to Egypt,\nsaying to Aaron, \"Make us gods to go\nbefore us; as for this Moses who\nbrought us out of the land of Egypt, we\ndo not know what has become of him.'\nAnd they made a calf in those days,\noffered sacrifices to the idol, and\nrejoiced in the works of their own hands.\nHas My hand not made all these\nthings?'\nThen God turned and gave them up to\nworship the host of heaven, as it is\nwritten in the book of the Prophets: \"Did\nyou offer Me slaughtered animals and\nsacrifices during forty years in the\nwilderness, O house of Israel?\nYou also took up the tabernacle of\nMoloch, And the star of your god\nRemphan, Images which you made to\nworship; And I will carry you away\nbeyond Babylon.'\n\"Our fathers had the tabernacle of\nwitness in the wilderness, as He\nappointed, instructing Moses to make it\naccording to the pattern that he had\nseen,\nwhich our fathers, having received it in\nturn, also brought with Joshua into the\nland possessed by the Gentiles, whom\nGod drove out before the face of our\nfathers until the days of David,\nwho found favor before God and\nasked to find a dwelling for the God of\nJacob.\nBut Solomon built Him a house.\n\"You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in\nheart and ears! You always resist the\nHoly Spirit; as your fathers did, so do\nyou.\nWhich of the prophets did your fathers\nnot persecute? And they killed those\nwho foretold the coming of the Just One,\nof whom you now have become the\nbetrayers and murderers,\nwho have received the law by the\ndirection of angels and have not kept it.\"\nWhen they heard these things they\nwere cut to the heart, and they gnashed\nat him with their teeth.\nBut he, being full of the Holy Spirit,\ngazed into heaven and saw the glory of\nGod, and Jesus standing at the right\nhand of God,\nand said, \"Look! I see the heavens\nopened and the Son of Man standing at\nthe right hand of God!\"\nThen they cried out with a loud voice,\nstopped their ears, and ran at him with\none accord;\n\"However, the Most High does not\ndwell in temples made with hands, as\nthe prophet says:\nand they cast him out of the city and\nstoned him. And the witnesses laid\ndown their clothes at the feet of a young\nman named Saul.\n\"Heaven is My throne, And earth is My\nfootstool. What house will you build for\nMe? says the LORD, Or what is the\nplace of My rest?\nAnd they stoned Stephen as he was\ncalling on God and saying, \"Lord Jesus,\nreceive my spirit.\"\nThen he knelt down and cried out with\na loud voice, \"Lord, do not charge them\nwith this sin.\" And when he had said this,\nhe fell asleep.\n8Now Saul was consenting to his\ndeath. At that time a great persecution\narose against the church which was at\nJerusalem; and they were all scattered\nthroughout the regions of Judea and\nSamaria, except the apostles.\nSamaria, claiming that he was someone\ngreat,\nto whom they all gave heed, from the\nleast to the greatest, saying, \"This man\nis the great power of God.\"\nAnd they heeded him because he had\nastonished them with his sorceries for a\nlong time.\nAnd devout men carried Stephen to his\nburial, and made great lamentation over\nhim.\nBut when they believed Philip as he\npreached the things concerning the\nkingdom of God and the name of Jesus\nChrist, both men and women were\nbaptized.\nAs for Saul, he made havoc of the\nchurch, entering every house, and\ndragging off men and women,\ncommitting them to prison.\nThen Simon himself also believed; and\nwhen he was baptized he continued with\nPhilip, and was amazed, seeing the\nmiracles and signs which were done.\nTherefore those who were scattered\nwent everywhere preaching the word.\nThen Philip went down to the city of\nSamaria and preached Christ to them.\nAnd the multitudes with one accord\nheeded the things spoken by Philip,\nhearing and seeing the miracles which\nhe did.\nFor unclean spirits, crying with a loud\nvoice, came out of many who were\npossessed; and many who were\nparalyzed and lame were healed.\nAnd there was great joy in that city.\nBut there was a certain man called\nSimon, who previously practiced sorcery\nin the city and astonished the people of\nNow when the apostles who were at\nJerusalem heard that Samaria had\nreceived the word of God, they sent\nPeter and John to them,\nwho, when they had come down,\nprayed for them that they might receive\nthe Holy Spirit.\nFor as yet He had fallen upon none of\nthem. They had only been baptized in\nthe name of the Lord Jesus.\nThen they laid hands on them, and\nthey received the Holy Spirit.\nAnd when Simon saw that through the\nlaying on of the apostles' hands the Holy\nSpirit was given, he offered them money,\nsaying, \"Give me this power also, that\nanyone on whom I lay hands may\nreceive the Holy Spirit.\"\nwas returning. And sitting in his chariot,\nhe was reading Isaiah the prophet.\nBut Peter said to him, \"Your money\nperish with you, because you thought\nthat the gift of God could be purchased\nwith money!\nYou have neither part nor portion in\nthis matter, for your heart is not right in\nthe sight of God.\nRepent therefore of this your\nwickedness, and pray God if perhaps\nthe thought of your heart may be\nforgiven you.\nThen the Spirit said to Philip, \"Go near\nand overtake this chariot.\"\nSo Philip ran to him, and heard him\nreading the prophet Isaiah, and said,\n\"Do you understand what you are\nreading?\"\nAnd he said, \"How can I, unless\nsomeone guides me?\" And he asked\nPhilip to come up and sit with him.\nFor I see that you are poisoned by\nbitterness and bound by iniquity.\"\nThe place in the Scripture which he\nread was this: \"He was led as a sheep\nto the slaughter; And as a lamb before\nits shearer is silent, So He opened not\nHis mouth.\nThen Simon answered and said, \"Pray\nto the Lord for me, that none of the\nthings which you have spoken may\ncome upon me.\"\nIn His humiliation His justice was taken\naway, And who will declare His\ngeneration? For His life is taken from\nthe earth.\"\nSo when they had testified and\npreached the word of the Lord, they\nreturned to Jerusalem, preaching the\ngospel in many villages of the\nSamaritans.\nSo the eunuch answered Philip and\nsaid, \"I ask you, of whom does the\nprophet say this, of himself or of some\nother man?\"\nNow an angel of the Lord spoke to\nPhilip, saying, \"Arise and go toward the\nsouth along the road which goes down\nfrom Jerusalem to Gaza.\" This is desert.\nSo he arose and went. And behold, a\nman of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great\nauthority under Candace the queen of\nthe Ethiopians, who had charge of all\nher treasury, and had come to\nJerusalem to worship,\nThen Philip opened his mouth, and\nbeginning at this Scripture, preached\nJesus to him.\nNow as they went down the road, they\ncame to some water. And the eunuch\nsaid, \"See, here is water. What hinders\nme from being baptized?\"\nThen Philip said, \"If you believe with all\nyour heart, you may.\" And he answered\nand said, \"I believe that Jesus Christ is\nthe Son of God.\"\nSo he commanded the chariot to stand\nstill. And both Philip and the eunuch\nwent down into the water, and he\nbaptized him.\nNow when they came up out of the\nwater, the Spirit of the Lord caught\nPhilip away, so that the eunuch saw him\nno more; and he went on his way\nrejoicing.\nSo he, trembling and astonished, said,\n\"Lord, what do You want me to do?\"\nThen the Lord said to him, \"Arise and go\ninto the city, and you will be told what\nyou must do.\"\nAnd the men who journeyed with him\nstood speechless, hearing a voice but\nseeing no one.\nThen Saul arose from the ground, and\nwhen his eyes were opened he saw no\none. But they led him by the hand and\nbrought him into Damascus.\nBut Philip was found at Azotus. And\npassing through, he preached in all the\ncities till he came to Caesarea.\n9Then Saul, still breathing threats and\nmurder against the disciples of the Lord,\nwent to the high priest\nand asked letters from him to the\nsynagogues of Damascus, so that if he\nfound any who were of the Way,\nwhether men or women, he might bring\nthem bound to Jerusalem.\nAs he journeyed he came near\nDamascus, and suddenly a light shone\naround him from heaven.\nThen he fell to the ground, and heard a\nvoice saying to him, \"Saul, Saul, why\nare you persecuting Me?\"\nAnd he said, \"Who are You, Lord?\"\nThen the Lord said, \"I am Jesus, whom\nyou are persecuting. It is hard for you to\nkick against the goads.\"\nAnd he was three days without sight,\nand neither ate nor drank.\nNow there was a certain disciple at\nDamascus named Ananias; and to him\nthe Lord said in a vision, \"Ananias.\" And\nhe said, \"Here I am, Lord.\"\nSo the Lord said to him, \"Arise and go\nto the street called Straight, and inquire\nat the house of Judas for one called\nSaul of Tarsus, for behold, he is praying.\nAnd in a vision he has seen a man\nnamed Ananias coming in and putting\nhis hand on him, so that he might\nreceive his sight.\"\nThen Ananias answered, \"Lord, I have\nheard from many about this man, how\nmuch harm he has done to Your saints\nin Jerusalem.\nAnd here he has authority from the\nchief priests to bind all who call on Your\nname.\"\nBut the Lord said to him, \"Go, for he is\na chosen vessel of Mine to bear My\nname before Gentiles, kings, and the\nchildren of Israel.\nBut their plot became known to Saul.\nAnd they watched the gates day and\nnight, to kill him.\nFor I will show him how many things\nhe must suffer for My name's sake.\"\nThen the disciples took him by night\nand let him down through the wall in a\nlarge basket.\nAnd Ananias went his way and\nentered the house; and laying his hands\non him he said, \"Brother Saul, the Lord\nJesus, who appeared to you on the road\nas you came, has sent me that you may\nreceive your sight and be filled with the\nHoly Spirit.\"\nImmediately there fell from his eyes\nsomething like scales, and he received\nhis sight at once; and he arose and was\nbaptized.\nAnd when Saul had come to\nJerusalem, he tried to join the disciples;\nbut they were all afraid of him, and did\nnot believe that he was a disciple.\nBut Barnabas took him and brought\nhim to the apostles. And he declared to\nthem how he had seen the Lord on the\nroad, and that He had spoken to him,\nand how he had preached boldly at\nDamascus in the name of Jesus.\nSo when he had received food, he was\nstrengthened. Then Saul spent some\ndays with the disciples at Damascus.\nImmediately he preached the Christ in\nthe synagogues, that He is the Son of\nGod.\nThen all who heard were amazed, and\nsaid, \"Is this not he who destroyed those\nwho called on this name in Jerusalem,\nand has come here for that purpose, so\nthat he might bring them bound to the\nchief priests?\"\nBut Saul increased all the more in\nstrength, and confounded the Jews who\ndwelt in Damascus, proving that this\nJesus is the Christ.\nNow after many days were past, the\nJews plotted to kill him.\nSo he was with them at Jerusalem,\ncoming in and going out.\nAnd he spoke boldly in the name of\nthe Lord Jesus and disputed against the\nHellenists, but they attempted to kill him.\nWhen the brethren found out, they\nbrought him down to Caesarea and sent\nhim out to Tarsus.\nThen the churches throughout all\nJudea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace\nand were edified. And walking in the\nfear of the Lord and in the comfort of the\nHoly Spirit, they were multiplied.\nNow it came to pass, as Peter went\nthrough all parts of the country, that he\nalso came down to the saints who dwelt\nin Lydda.\nThere he found a certain man named\nAeneas, who had been bedridden eight\nyears and was paralyzed.\nsaints and widows, he presented her\nalive.\nAnd Peter said to him, \"Aeneas, Jesus\nthe Christ heals you. Arise and make\nyour bed.\" Then he arose immediately.\nSo all who dwelt at Lydda and Sharon\nsaw him and turned to the Lord.\nAt Joppa there was a certain disciple\nnamed Tabitha, which is translated\nDorcas. This woman was full of good\nworks and charitable deeds which she\ndid.\nBut it happened in those days that she\nbecame sick and died. When they had\nwashed her, they laid her in an upper\nroom.\nAnd since Lydda was near Joppa, and\nthe disciples had heard that Peter was\nthere, they sent two men to him,\nimploring him not to delay in coming to\nthem.\nThen Peter arose and went with them.\nWhen he had come, they brought him to\nthe upper room. And all the widows\nstood by him weeping, showing the\ntunics and garments which Dorcas had\nmade while she was with them.\nBut Peter put them all out, and knelt\ndown and prayed. And turning to the\nbody he said, \"Tabitha, arise.\" And she\nopened her eyes, and when she saw\nPeter she sat up.\nThen he gave her his hand and lifted\nher up; and when he had called the\nAnd it became known throughout all\nJoppa, and many believed on the Lord.\nSo it was that he stayed many days in\nJoppa with Simon, a tanner.\n10There was a certain man in\nCaesarea called Cornelius, a centurion\nof what was called the Italian Regiment,\na devout man and one who feared God\nwith all his household, who gave alms\ngenerously to the people, and prayed to\nGod always.\nAbout the ninth hour of the day he saw\nclearly in a vision an angel of God\ncoming in and saying to him,\n\"Cornelius!\"\nAnd when he observed him, he was\nafraid, and said, \"What is it, lord?\" So he\nsaid to him, \"Your prayers and your\nalms have come up for a memorial\nbefore God.\nNow send men to Joppa, and send for\nSimon whose surname is Peter.\nHe is lodging with Simon, a tanner,\nwhose house is by the sea. He will tell\nyou what you must do.\"\nAnd when the angel who spoke to him\nhad departed, Cornelius called two of\nhis household servants and a devout\nsoldier from among those who waited on\nhim continually.\nSo when he had explained all these\nthings to them, he sent them to Joppa.\nAnd they called and asked whether\nSimon, whose surname was Peter, was\nlodging there.\nThe next day, as they went on their\njourney and drew near the city, Peter\nwent up on the housetop to pray, about\nthe sixth hour.\nWhile Peter thought about the vision,\nthe Spirit said to him, \"Behold, three\nmen are seeking you.\nThen he became very hungry and\nwanted to eat; but while they made\nready, he fell into a trance\nArise therefore, go down and go with\nthem, doubting nothing; for I have sent\nthem.\"\nand saw heaven opened and an object\nlike a great sheet bound at the four\ncorners, descending to him and let down\nto the earth.\nThen Peter went down to the men who\nhad been sent to him from Cornelius,\nand said, \"Yes, I am he whom you seek.\nFor what reason have you come?\"\nIn it were all kinds of four-footed\nanimals of the earth, wild beasts,\ncreeping things, and birds of the air.\nAnd a voice came to him, \"Rise, Peter;\nkill and eat.\"\nAnd they said, \"Cornelius the centurion,\na just man, one who fears God and has\na good reputation among all the nation\nof the Jews, was divinely instructed by a\nholy angel to summon you to his house,\nand to hear words from you.\"\nBut Peter said, \"Not so, Lord! For I\nhave never eaten anything common or\nunclean.\"\nThen he invited them in and lodged\nthem. On the next day Peter went away\nwith them, and some brethren from\nJoppa accompanied him.\nAnd a voice spoke to him again the\nsecond time, \"What God has cleansed\nyou must not call common.\"\nThis was done three times. And the\nobject was taken up into heaven again.\nNow while Peter wondered within\nhimself what this vision which he had\nseen meant, behold, the men who had\nbeen sent from Cornelius had made\ninquiry for Simon's house, and stood\nbefore the gate.\nAnd the following day they entered\nCaesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting\nfor them, and had called together his\nrelatives and close friends.\nAs Peter was coming in, Cornelius met\nhim and fell down at his feet and\nworshiped him.\nBut Peter lifted him up, saying, \"Stand\nup; I myself am also a man.\"\nAnd as he talked with him, he went in\nand found many who had come together.\nThen he said to them, \"You know how\nunlawful it is for a Jewish man to keep\ncompany with or go to one of another\nnation. But God has shown me that I\nshould not call any man common or\nunclean.\nthat word you know, which was\nproclaimed throughout all Judea, and\nbegan from Galilee after the baptism\nwhich John preached:\nTherefore I came without objection as\nsoon as I was sent for. I ask, then, for\nwhat reason have you sent for me?\"\nhow God anointed Jesus of Nazareth\nwith the Holy Spirit and with power, who\nwent about doing good and healing all\nwho were oppressed by the devil, for\nGod was with Him.\nSo Cornelius said, \"Four days ago I\nwas fasting until this hour; and at the\nninth hour I prayed in my house, and\nbehold, a man stood before me in bright\nclothing,\nAnd we are witnesses of all things\nwhich He did both in the land of the\nJews and in Jerusalem, whom they\nkilled by hanging on a tree.\nand said, \"Cornelius, your prayer has\nbeen heard, and your alms are\nremembered in the sight of God.\nSend therefore to Joppa and call\nSimon here, whose surname is Peter.\nHe is lodging in the house of Simon, a\ntanner, by the sea. When he comes, he\nwill speak to you.'\nSo I sent to you immediately, and you\nhave done well to come. Now therefore,\nwe are all present before God, to hear\nall the things commanded you by God.\"\nThen Peter opened his mouth and\nsaid: \"In truth I perceive that God shows\nno partiality.\nBut in every nation whoever fears Him\nand works righteousness is accepted by\nHim.\nThe word which God sent to the\nchildren of Israel, preaching peace\nthrough Jesus Christ--He is Lord of all--\nHim God raised up on the third day,\nand showed Him openly,\nnot to all the people, but to witnesses\nchosen before by God, even to us who\nate and drank with Him after He arose\nfrom the dead.\nAnd He commanded us to preach to\nthe people, and to testify that it is He\nwho was ordained by God to be Judge\nof the living and the dead.\nTo Him all the prophets witness that,\nthrough His name, whoever believes in\nHim will receive remission of sins.\"\nWhile Peter was still speaking these\nwords, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those\nwho heard the word.\nAnd those of the circumcision who\nbelieved were astonished, as many as\ncame with Peter, because the gift of the\nHoly Spirit had been poured out on the\nGentiles also.\nFor they heard them speak with\ntongues and magnify God. Then Peter\nanswered,\nBut I said, \"Not so, Lord! For nothing\ncommon or unclean has at any time\nentered my mouth.'\n\"Can anyone forbid water, that these\nshould not be baptized who have\nreceived the Holy Spirit just as we\nhave?\"\nBut the voice answered me again from\nheaven, \"What God has cleansed you\nmust not call common.'\nAnd he commanded them to be\nbaptized in the name of the Lord. Then\nthey asked him to stay a few days.\n11Now the apostles and brethren\nwho were in Judea heard that the\nGentiles had also received the word of\nGod.\nNow this was done three times, and all\nwere drawn up again into heaven.\nAt that very moment, three men stood\nbefore the house where I was, having\nbeen sent to me from Caesarea.\nThen the Spirit told me to go with them,\ndoubting nothing. Moreover these six\nbrethren accompanied me, and we\nentered the man's house.\nAnd when Peter came up to Jerusalem,\nthose of the circumcision contended\nwith him,\nsaying, \"You went in to uncircumcised\nmen and ate with them!\"\nBut Peter explained it to them in order\nfrom the beginning, saying:\n\"I was in the city of Joppa praying; and\nin a trance I saw a vision, an object\ndescending like a great sheet, let down\nfrom heaven by four corners; and it\ncame to me.\nWhen I observed it intently and\nconsidered, I saw four-footed animals of\nthe earth, wild beasts, creeping things,\nand birds of the air.\nAnd I heard a voice saying to me, \"Rise,\nPeter; kill and eat.'\nAnd he told us how he had seen an\nangel standing in his house, who said to\nhim, \"Send men to Joppa, and call for\nSimon whose surname is Peter,\nwho will tell you words by which you\nand all your household will be saved.'\nAnd as I began to speak, the Holy\nSpirit fell upon them, as upon us at the\nbeginning.\nThen I remembered the word of the\nLord, how He said, \"John indeed\nbaptized with water, but you shall be\nbaptized with the Holy Spirit.'\nIf therefore God gave them the same\ngift as He gave us when we believed on\nthe Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I\ncould withstand God?\"\nWhen they heard these things they\nbecame silent; and they glorified God,\nsaying, \"Then God has also granted to\nthe Gentiles repentance to life.\"\nNow those who were scattered after\nthe persecution that arose over Stephen\ntraveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus,\nand Antioch, preaching the word to no\none but the Jews only.\nBut some of them were men from\nCyprus and Cyrene, who, when they\nhad come to Antioch, spoke to the\nHellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus.\nAnd the hand of the Lord was with\nthem, and a great number believed and\nturned to the Lord.\nThen news of these things came to the\nears of the church in Jerusalem, and\nthey sent out Barnabas to go as far as\nAntioch.\nWhen he came and had seen the\ngrace of God, he was glad, and\nencouraged them all that with purpose\nof heart they should continue with the\nLord.\nFor he was a good man, full of the\nHoly Spirit and of faith. And a great\nmany people were added to the Lord.\nThen Barnabas departed for Tarsus to\nseek Saul.\nAnd when he had found him, he\nbrought him to Antioch. So it was that\nfor a whole year they assembled with\nthe church and taught a great many\npeople. And the disciples were first\ncalled Christians in Antioch.\nAnd in these days prophets came from\nJerusalem to Antioch.\nThen one of them, named Agabus,\nstood up and showed by the Spirit that\nthere was going to be a great famine\nthroughout all the world, which also\nhappened in the days of Claudius\nCaesar.\nThen the disciples, each according to\nhis ability, determined to send relief to\nthe brethren dwelling in Judea.\nThis they also did, and sent it to the\nelders by the hands of Barnabas and\nSaul.\n12Now about that time Herod the\nking stretched out his hand to harass\nsome from the church.\nThen he killed James the brother of\nJohn with the sword.\nAnd because he saw that it pleased the\nJews, he proceeded further to seize\nPeter also. Now it was during the Days\nof Unleavened Bread.\nSo when he had arrested him, he put\nhim in prison, and delivered him to four\nsquads of soldiers to keep him,\nintending to bring him before the people\nafter Passover.\nPeter was therefore kept in prison, but\nconstant prayer was offered to God for\nhim by the church.\nAnd when Herod was about to bring\nhim out, that night Peter was sleeping,\nbound with two chains between two\nsoldiers; and the guards before the door\nwere keeping the prison.\nNow behold, an angel of the Lord stood\nby him, and a light shone in the prison;\nand he struck Peter on the side and\nraised him up, saying, \"Arise quickly!\"\nAnd his chains fell off his hands.\nThen the angel said to him, \"Gird\nyourself and tie on your sandals\"; and\nso he did. And he said to him, \"Put on\nyour garment and follow me.\"\nSo he went out and followed him, and\ndid not know that what was done by the\nangel was real, but thought he was\nseeing a vision.\nWhen they were past the first and the\nsecond guard posts, they came to the\niron gate that leads to the city, which\nopened to them of its own accord; and\nthey went out and went down one street,\nand immediately the angel departed\nfrom him.\nAnd as Peter knocked at the door of\nthe gate, a girl named Rhoda came to\nanswer.\nWhen she recognized Peter's voice,\nbecause of her gladness she did not\nopen the gate, but ran in and\nannounced that Peter stood before the\ngate.\nBut they said to her, \"You are beside\nyourself!\" Yet she kept insisting that it\nwas so. So they said, \"It is his angel.\"\nNow Peter continued knocking; and\nwhen they opened the door and saw\nhim, they were astonished.\nBut motioning to them with his hand to\nkeep silent, he declared to them how the\nLord had brought him out of the prison.\nAnd he said, \"Go, tell these things to\nJames and to the brethren.\" And he\ndeparted and went to another place.\nThen, as soon as it was day, there\nwas no small stir among the soldiers\nabout what had become of Peter.\nAnd when Peter had come to himself,\nhe said, \"Now I know for certain that the\nLord has sent His angel, and has\ndelivered me from the hand of Herod\nand from all the expectation of the\nJewish people.\"\nBut when Herod had searched for him\nand not found him, he examined the\nguards and commanded that they\nshould be put to death. And he went\ndown from Judea to Caesarea, and\nstayed there.\nSo, when he had considered this, he\ncame to the house of Mary, the mother\nof John whose surname was Mark,\nwhere many were gathered together\npraying.\nNow Herod had been very angry with\nthe people of Tyre and Sidon; but they\ncame to him with one accord, and\nhaving made Blastus the king's personal\naide their friend, they asked for peace,\nbecause their country was supplied with\nfood by the king's country.\nSo on a set day Herod, arrayed in\nroyal apparel, sat on his throne and\ngave an oration to them.\nsynagogues of the Jews. They also had\nJohn as their assistant.\nAnd the people kept shouting, \"The\nvoice of a god and not of a man!\"\nNow when they had gone through the\nisland to Paphos, they found a certain\nsorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose\nname was Bar-Jesus,\nThen immediately an angel of the Lord\nstruck him, because he did not give\nglory to God. And he was eaten by\nworms and died.\nwho was with the proconsul, Sergius\nPaulus, an intelligent man. This man\ncalled for Barnabas and Saul and\nsought to hear the word of God.\nBut the word of God grew and\nmultiplied.\nAnd Barnabas and Saul returned from\nJerusalem when they had fulfilled their\nministry, and they also took with them\nJohn whose surname was Mark.\n13Now in the church that was at\nAntioch there were certain prophets and\nteachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was\ncalled Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen\nwho had been brought up with Herod\nthe tetrarch, and Saul.\nAs they ministered to the Lord and\nfasted, the Holy Spirit said, \"Now\nseparate to Me Barnabas and Saul for\nthe work to which I have called them.\"\nThen, having fasted and prayed, and\nlaid hands on them, they sent them\naway.\nSo, being sent out by the Holy Spirit,\nthey went down to Seleucia, and from\nthere they sailed to Cyprus.\nAnd when they arrived in Salamis, they\npreached the word of God in the\nBut Elymas the sorcerer (for so his\nname is translated) withstood them,\nseeking to turn the proconsul away from\nthe faith.\nThen Saul, who also is called Paul,\nfilled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently\nat him\nand said, \"O full of all deceit and all\nfraud, you son of the devil, you enemy\nof all righteousness, will you not cease\nperverting the straight ways of the Lord?\nAnd now, indeed, the hand of the Lord\nis upon you, and you shall be blind, not\nseeing the sun for a time.\" And\nimmediately a dark mist fell on him, and\nhe went around seeking someone to\nlead him by the hand.\nThen the proconsul believed, when he\nsaw what had been done, being\nastonished at the teaching of the Lord.\nNow when Paul and his party set sail\nfrom Paphos, they came to Perga in\nPamphylia; and John, departing from\nthem, returned to Jerusalem.\nBut when they departed from Perga,\nthey came to Antioch in Pisidia, and\nwent into the synagogue on the Sabbath\nday and sat down.\nAnd after the reading of the Law and\nthe Prophets, the rulers of the\nsynagogue sent to them, saying, \"Men\nand brethren, if you have any word of\nexhortation for the people, say on.\"\nThen Paul stood up, and motioning\nwith his hand said, \"Men of Israel, and\nyou who fear God, listen:\nThe God of this people Israel chose\nour fathers, and exalted the people\nwhen they dwelt as strangers in the land\nof Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He\nbrought them out of it.\nNow for a time of about forty years He\nput up with their ways in the wilderness.\nAnd when He had destroyed seven\nnations in the land of Canaan, He\ndistributed their land to them by\nallotment.\nman after My own heart, who will do all\nMy will.'\nFrom this man's seed, according to the\npromise, God raised up for Israel a\nSavior--Jesus-24\nafter John had first preached, before\nHis coming, the baptism of repentance\nto all the people of Israel.\nAnd as John was finishing his course,\nhe said, \"Who do you think I am? I am\nnot He. But behold, there comes One\nafter me, the sandals of whose feet I am\nnot worthy to loose.'\n\"Men and brethren, sons of the family\nof Abraham, and those among you who\nfear God, to you the word of this\nsalvation has been sent.\nFor those who dwell in Jerusalem, and\ntheir rulers, because they did not know\nHim, nor even the voices of the\nProphets which are read every Sabbath,\nhave fulfilled them in condemning Him.\n\"After that He gave them judges for\nabout four hundred and fifty years, until\nSamuel the prophet.\nAnd though they found no cause for\ndeath in Him, they asked Pilate that He\nshould be put to death.\nAnd afterward they asked for a king;\nso God gave them Saul the son of Kish,\na man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty\nyears.\nNow when they had fulfilled all that\nwas written concerning Him, they took\nHim down from the tree and laid Him in\na tomb.\nAnd when He had removed him, He\nraised up for them David as king, to\nwhom also He gave testimony and said,\n\"I have found David the son of Jesse, a\nBut God raised Him from the dead.\nHe was seen for many days by those\nwho came up with Him from Galilee to\nJerusalem, who are His witnesses to the\npeople.\nAnd we declare to you glad tidings-that promise which was made to the\nfathers.\nSo when the Jews went out of the\nsynagogue, the Gentiles begged that\nthese words might be preached to them\nthe next Sabbath.\nGod has fulfilled this for us their\nchildren, in that He has raised up Jesus.\nAs it is also written in the second Psalm:\n\"You are My Son, Today I have\nbegotten You.'\nAnd that He raised Him from the dead,\nno more to return to corruption, He has\nspoken thus: \"I will give you the sure\nmercies of David.'\nNow when the congregation had\nbroken up, many of the Jews and\ndevout proselytes followed Paul and\nBarnabas, who, speaking to them,\npersuaded them to continue in the grace\nof God.\nOn the next Sabbath almost the whole\ncity came together to hear the word of\nGod.\nTherefore He also says in another\nPsalm: \"You will not allow Your Holy\nOne to see corruption.'\n\"For David, after he had served his\nown generation by the will of God, fell\nasleep, was buried with his fathers, and\nsaw corruption;\nbut He whom God raised up saw no\ncorruption.\nBut when the Jews saw the multitudes,\nthey were filled with envy; and\ncontradicting and blaspheming, they\nopposed the things spoken by Paul.\nThen Paul and Barnabas grew bold\nand said, \"It was necessary that the\nword of God should be spoken to you\nfirst; but since you reject it, and judge\nyourselves unworthy of everlasting life,\nbehold, we turn to the Gentiles.\nTherefore let it be known to you,\nbrethren, that through this Man is\npreached to you the forgiveness of sins;\nand by Him everyone who believes is\njustified from all things from which you\ncould not be justified by the law of\nMoses.\nBeware therefore, lest what has been\nspoken in the prophets come upon you:\n\"Behold, you despisers, Marvel and\nperish! For I work a work in your days, A\nwork which you will by no means believe,\nThough one were to declare it to you.\"'\nFor so the Lord has commanded us: \"I\nhave set you as a light to the Gentiles,\nThat you should be for salvation to the\nends of the earth.\"'\nNow when the Gentiles heard this,\nthey were glad and glorified the word of\nthe Lord. And as many as had been\nappointed to eternal life believed.\nAnd the word of the Lord was being\nspread throughout all the region.\nBut the Jews stirred up the devout and\nprominent women and the chief men of\nthe city, raised up persecution against\nPaul and Barnabas, and expelled them\nfrom their region.\nAnd in Lystra a certain man without\nstrength in his feet was sitting, a cripple\nfrom his mother's womb, who had never\nwalked.\nBut they shook off the dust from their\nfeet against them, and came to Iconium.\nAnd the disciples were filled with joy\nand with the Holy Spirit.\n14Now it happened in Iconium that\nthey went together to the synagogue of\nthe Jews, and so spoke that a great\nmultitude both of the Jews and of the\nGreeks believed.\nBut the unbelieving Jews stirred up the\nGentiles and poisoned their minds\nagainst the brethren.\nTherefore they stayed there a long time,\nspeaking boldly in the Lord, who was\nbearing witness to the word of His grace,\ngranting signs and wonders to be done\nby their hands.\nBut the multitude of the city was\ndivided: part sided with the Jews, and\npart with the apostles.\nAnd when a violent attempt was made\nby both the Gentiles and Jews, with their\nrulers, to abuse and stone them,\nthey became aware of it and fled to\nLystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia,\nand to the surrounding region.\nAnd they were preaching the gospel\nthere.\nThis man heard Paul speaking. Paul,\nobserving him intently and seeing that\nhe had faith to be healed,\nsaid with a loud voice, \"Stand up\nstraight on your feet!\" And he leaped\nand walked.\nNow when the people saw what Paul\nhad done, they raised their voices,\nsaying in the Lycaonian language, \"The\ngods have come down to us in the\nlikeness of men!\"\nAnd Barnabas they called Zeus, and\nPaul, Hermes, because he was the chief\nspeaker.\nThen the priest of Zeus, whose temple\nwas in front of their city, brought oxen\nand garlands to the gates, intending to\nsacrifice with the multitudes.\nBut when the apostles Barnabas and\nPaul heard this, they tore their clothes\nand ran in among the multitude, crying\nout\nand saying, \"Men, why are you doing\nthese things? We also are men with the\nsame nature as you, and preach to you\nthat you should turn from these useless\nthings to the living God, who made the\nheaven, the earth, the sea, and all\nthings that are in them,\nwho in bygone generations allowed all\nnations to walk in their own ways.\nNevertheless He did not leave Himself\nwithout witness, in that He did good,\ngave us rain from heaven and fruitful\nseasons, filling our hearts with food and\ngladness.\"\nFrom there they sailed to Antioch,\nwhere they had been commended to the\ngrace of God for the work which they\nhad completed.\nAnd with these sayings they could\nscarcely restrain the multitudes from\nsacrificing to them.\nNow when they had come and\ngathered the church together, they\nreported all that God had done with\nthem, and that He had opened the door\nof faith to the Gentiles.\nThen Jews from Antioch and Iconium\ncame there; and having persuaded the\nmultitudes, they stoned Paul and\ndragged him out of the city, supposing\nhim to be dead.\nHowever, when the disciples gathered\naround him, he rose up and went into\nthe city. And the next day he departed\nwith Barnabas to Derbe.\nAnd when they had preached the\ngospel to that city and made many\ndisciples, they returned to Lystra,\nIconium, and Antioch,\nstrengthening the souls of the disciples,\nexhorting them to continue in the faith,\nand saying, \"We must through many\ntribulations enter the kingdom of God.\"\nSo when they had appointed elders in\nevery church, and prayed with fasting,\nthey commended them to the Lord in\nwhom they had believed.\nSo they stayed there a long time with\nthe disciples.\n15And certain men came down from\nJudea and taught the brethren, \"Unless\nyou are circumcised according to the\ncustom of Moses, you cannot be saved.\"\nTherefore, when Paul and Barnabas\nhad no small dissension and dispute\nwith them, they determined that Paul\nand Barnabas and certain others of\nthem should go up to Jerusalem, to the\napostles and elders, about this question.\nSo, being sent on their way by the\nchurch, they passed through Phoenicia\nand Samaria, describing the conversion\nof the Gentiles; and they caused great\njoy to all the brethren.\nAnd after they had passed through\nPisidia, they came to Pamphylia.\nAnd when they had come to Jerusalem,\nthey were received by the church and\nthe apostles and the elders; and they\nreported all things that God had done\nwith them.\nNow when they had preached the\nword in Perga, they went down to Attalia.\nBut some of the sect of the Pharisees\nwho believed rose up, saying, \"It is\nnecessary to circumcise them, and to\ncommand them to keep the law of\nMoses.\"\nAnd with this the words of the prophets\nagree, just as it is written:\nNow the apostles and elders came\ntogether to consider this matter.\nAnd when there had been much\ndispute, Peter rose up and said to them:\n\"Men and brethren, you know that a\ngood while ago God chose among us,\nthat by my mouth the Gentiles should\nhear the word of the gospel and believe.\nSo God, who knows the heart,\nacknowledged them by giving them the\nHoly Spirit, just as He did to us,\n'After this I will return And will rebuild\nthe tabernacle of David, which has fallen\ndown; I will rebuild its ruins, And I will\nset it up;\nSo that the rest of mankind may seek\nthe LORD. Even all the Gentiles who\nare called by My name, Says the LORD\nwho does all these things.'\n\"Known to God from eternity are all His\nworks.\nand made no distinction between us\nand them, purifying their hearts by faith.\nTherefore I judge that we should not\ntrouble those from among the Gentiles\nwho are turning to God,\nNow therefore, why do you test God\nby putting a yoke on the neck of the\ndisciples which neither our fathers nor\nwe were able to bear?\nbut that we write to them to abstain\nfrom things polluted by idols, from\nsexual immorality, from things strangled,\nand from blood.\nBut we believe that through the grace\nof the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be\nsaved in the same manner as they.\"\nFor Moses has had throughout many\ngenerations those who preach him in\nevery city, being read in the synagogues\nevery Sabbath.\"\nThen all the multitude kept silent and\nlistened to Barnabas and Paul declaring\nhow many miracles and wonders God\nhad worked through them among the\nGentiles.\nAnd after they had become silent,\nJames answered, saying, \"Men and\nbrethren, listen to me:\nSimon has declared how God at the\nfirst visited the Gentiles to take out of\nthem a people for His name.\nThen it pleased the apostles and\nelders, with the whole church, to send\nchosen men of their own company to\nAntioch with Paul and Barnabas, namely,\nJudas who was also named Barsabas,\nand Silas, leading men among the\nbrethren.\nThey wrote this, letter by them: The\napostles, the elders, and the brethren,\nTo the brethren who are of the Gentiles\nin Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: Greetings.\nSince we have heard that some who\nwent out from us have troubled you with\nwords, unsettling your souls, saying,\n\"You must be circumcised and keep the\nlaw\" --to whom we gave no such\ncommandment--\nAnd after they had stayed there for a\ntime, they were sent back with greetings\nfrom the brethren to the apostles.\nit seemed good to us, being\nassembled with one accord, to send\nchosen men to you with our beloved\nBarnabas and Paul,\nHowever, it seemed good to Silas to\nremain there.\nPaul and Barnabas also remained in\nAntioch, teaching and preaching the\nword of the Lord, with many others also.\nmen who have risked their lives for the\nname of our Lord Jesus Christ.\nWe have therefore sent Judas and\nSilas, who will also report the same\nthings by word of mouth.\nFor it seemed good to the Holy Spirit,\nand to us, to lay upon you no greater\nburden than these necessary things:\nthat you abstain from things offered to\nidols, from blood, from things strangled,\nand from sexual immorality. If you keep\nyourselves from these, you will do well.\nFarewell.\nThen after some days Paul said to\nBarnabas, \"Let us now go back and visit\nour brethren in every city where we\nhave preached the word of the Lord,\nand see how they are doing.\"\nNow Barnabas was determined to take\nwith them John called Mark.\nBut Paul insisted that they should not\ntake with them the one who had\ndeparted from them in Pamphylia, and\nhad not gone with them to the work.\nThen the contention became so sharp\nthat they parted from one another. And\nso Barnabas took Mark and sailed to\nCyprus;\nSo when they were sent off, they came\nto Antioch; and when they had gathered\nthe multitude together, they delivered\nthe letter.\nbut Paul chose Silas and departed,\nbeing commended by the brethren to\nthe grace of God.\nWhen they had read it, they rejoiced\nover its encouragement.\nNow Judas and Silas, themselves\nbeing prophets also, exhorted and\nstrengthened the brethren with many\nwords.\nAnd he went through Syria and Cilicia,\nstrengthening the churches.\n16Then he came to Derbe and\nLystra. And behold, a certain disciple\nwas there, named Timothy, the son of a\ncertain Jewish woman who believed, but\nhis father was Greek.\nHe was well spoken of by the brethren\nwho were at Lystra and Iconium.\nPaul wanted to have him go on with\nhim. And he took him and circumcised\nhim because of the Jews who were in\nthat region, for they all knew that his\nfather was Greek.\nand from there to Philippi, which is the\nforemost city of that part of Macedonia,\na colony. And we were staying in that\ncity for some days.\nAnd on the Sabbath day we went out\nof the city to the riverside, where prayer\nwas customarily made; and we sat down\nand spoke to the women who met there.\nAnd as they went through the cities,\nthey delivered to them the decrees to\nkeep, which were determined by the\napostles and elders at Jerusalem.\nSo the churches were strengthened in\nthe faith, and increased in number daily.\nNow a certain woman named Lydia\nheard us. She was a seller of purple\nfrom the city of Thyatira, who worshiped\nGod. The Lord opened her heart to heed\nthe things spoken by Paul.\nNow when they had gone through\nPhrygia and the region of Galatia, they\nwere forbidden by the Holy Spirit to\npreach the word in Asia.\nAnd when she and her household\nwere baptized, she begged us, saying,\n\"If you have judged me to be faithful to\nthe Lord, come to my house and stay.\"\nSo she persuaded us.\nAfter they had come to Mysia, they tried\nto go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not\npermit them.\nSo passing by Mysia, they came down\nto Troas.\nAnd a vision appeared to Paul in the\nnight. A man of Macedonia stood and\npleaded with him, saying, \"Come over to\nMacedonia and help us.\"\nNow after he had seen the vision,\nimmediately we sought to go to\nMacedonia, concluding that the Lord\nhad called us to preach the gospel to\nthem.\nTherefore, sailing from Troas, we ran a\nstraight course to Samothrace, and the\nnext day came to Neapolis,\nNow it happened, as we went to\nprayer, that a certain slave girl\npossessed with a spirit of divination met\nus, who brought her masters much profit\nby fortune-telling.\nThis girl followed Paul and us, and\ncried out, saying, \"These men are the\nservants of the Most High God, who\nproclaim to us the way of salvation.\"\nAnd this she did for many days. But\nPaul, greatly annoyed, turned and said\nto the spirit, \"I command you in the\nname of Jesus Christ to come out of\nher.\" And he came out that very hour.\nBut when her masters saw that their\nhope of profit was gone, they seized\nPaul and Silas and dragged them into\nthe marketplace to the authorities.\nAnd they brought them to the\nmagistrates, and said, \"These men,\nbeing Jews, exceedingly trouble our city;\nThen he called for a light, ran in, and\nfell down trembling before Paul and\nSilas.\nand they teach customs which are not\nlawful for us, being Romans, to receive\nor observe.\"\nAnd he brought them out and said,\n\"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\"\nThen the multitude rose up together\nagainst them; and the magistrates tore\noff their clothes and commanded them\nto be beaten with rods.\nAnd when they had laid many stripes\non them, they threw them into prison,\ncommanding the jailer to keep them\nsecurely.\nHaving received such a charge, he put\nthem into the inner prison and fastened\ntheir feet in the stocks.\nBut at midnight Paul and Silas were\npraying and singing hymns to God, and\nthe prisoners were listening to them.\nSuddenly\nthere\nwas\na\ngreat\nearthquake, so that the foundations of\nthe\nprison\nwere\nshaken;\nand\nimmediately all the doors were opened\nand everyone's chains were loosed.\nAnd the keeper of the prison, awaking\nfrom sleep and seeing the prison doors\nopen, supposing the prisoners had fled,\ndrew his sword and was about to kill\nhimself.\nBut Paul called with a loud voice,\nsaying, \"Do yourself no harm, for we are\nall here.\"\nSo they said, \"Believe on the Lord\nJesus Christ, and you will be saved, you\nand your household.\"\nThen they spoke the word of the Lord\nto him and to all who were in his house.\nAnd he took them the same hour of\nthe night and washed their stripes. And\nimmediately he and all his family were\nbaptized.\nNow when he had brought them into\nhis house, he set food before them; and\nhe rejoiced, having believed in God with\nall his household.\nAnd when it was day, the magistrates\nsent the officers, saying, \"Let those men\ngo.\"\nSo the keeper of the prison reported\nthese words to Paul, saying, \"The\nmagistrates have sent to let you go.\nNow therefore depart, and go in peace.\"\nBut Paul said to them, \"They have\nbeaten us openly, uncondemned\nRomans, and have thrown us into prison.\nAnd now do they put us out secretly? No\nindeed! Let them come themselves and\nget us out.\"\nAnd the officers told these words to\nthe magistrates, and they were afraid\nwhen they heard that they were Romans.\nThen they came and pleaded with\nthem and brought them out, and asked\nthem to depart from the city.\nJason has harbored them, and these\nare all acting contrary to the decrees of\nCaesar, saying there is another king-Jesus.\"\nSo they went out of the prison and\nentered the house of Lydia; and when\nthey had seen the brethren, they\nencouraged them and departed.\n17Now when they had passed\nthrough Amphipolis and Apollonia, they\ncame to Thessalonica, where there was\na synagogue of the Jews.\nThen Paul, as his custom was, went in\nto them, and for three Sabbaths\nreasoned with them from the Scriptures,\nexplaining and demonstrating that the\nChrist had to suffer and rise again from\nthe dead, and saying, \"This Jesus whom\nI preach to you is the Christ.\"\nAnd some of them were persuaded;\nand a great multitude of the devout\nGreeks, and not a few of the leading\nwomen, joined Paul and Silas.\nBut the Jews who were not persuaded,\nbecoming envious, took some of the evil\nmen from the marketplace, and\ngathering a mob, set all the city in an\nuproar and attacked the house of Jason,\nand sought to bring them out to the\npeople.\nBut when they did not find them, they\ndragged Jason and some brethren to\nthe rulers of the city, crying out, \"These\nwho have turned the world upside down\nhave come here too.\nAnd they troubled the crowd and the\nrulers of the city when they heard these\nthings.\nSo when they had taken security from\nJason and the rest, they let them go.\nThen the brethren immediately sent\nPaul and Silas away by night to Berea.\nWhen they arrived, they went into the\nsynagogue of the Jews.\nThese were more fair-minded than\nthose in Thessalonica, in that they\nreceived the word with all readiness,\nand searched the Scriptures daily to find\nout whether these things were so.\nTherefore many of them believed, and\nalso not a few of the Greeks, prominent\nwomen as well as men.\nBut when the Jews from Thessalonica\nlearned that the word of God was\npreached by Paul at Berea, they came\nthere also and stirred up the crowds.\nThen immediately the brethren sent\nPaul away, to go to the sea; but both\nSilas and Timothy remained there.\nSo those who conducted Paul brought\nhim to Athens; and receiving a\ncommand for Silas and Timothy to come\nto him with all speed, they departed.\nNow while Paul waited for them at\nAthens, his spirit was provoked within\nhim when he saw that the city was given\nover to idols.\nTherefore he reasoned in the\nsynagogue with the Jews and with the\nGentile worshipers, and in the\nmarketplace daily with those who\nhappened to be there.\nThen certain Epicurean and Stoic\nphilosophers encountered him. And\nsome said, \"What does this babbler\nwant to say?\" Others said, \"He seems to\nbe a proclaimer of foreign gods,\"\nbecause he preached to them Jesus\nand the resurrection.\nAnd they took him and brought him to\nthe Areopagus, saying, \"May we know\nwhat this new doctrine is of which you\nspeak?\nFor you are bringing some strange\nthings to our ears. Therefore we want to\nknow what these things mean.\"\nGod, who made the world and\neverything in it, since He is Lord of\nheaven and earth, does not dwell in\ntemples made with hands.\nNor is He worshiped with men's hands,\nas though He needed anything, since\nHe gives to all life, breath, and all things.\nAnd He has made from one blood\nevery nation of men to dwell on all the\nface of the earth, and has determined\ntheir preappointed times and the\nboundaries of their dwellings,\nso that they should seek the Lord, in\nthe hope that they might grope for Him\nand find Him, though He is not far from\neach one of us;\nfor in Him we live and move and have\nour being, as also some of your own\npoets have said, \"For we are also His\noffspring.'\nFor all the Athenians and the\nforeigners who were there spent their\ntime in nothing else but either to tell or\nto hear some new thing.\nTherefore, since we are the offspring\nof God, we ought not to think that the\nDivine Nature is like gold or silver or\nstone, something shaped by art and\nman's devising.\nThen Paul stood in the midst of the\nAreopagus and said, \"Men of Athens, I\nperceive that in all things you are very\nreligious;\nTruly, these times of ignorance God\noverlooked, but now commands all men\neverywhere to repent,\nfor as I was passing through and\nconsidering the objects of your worship,\nI even found an altar with this\ninscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.\nTherefore, the One whom you worship\nwithout knowing, Him I proclaim to you:\nbecause He has appointed a day on\nwhich He will judge the world in\nrighteousness by the Man whom He has\nordained. He has given assurance of\nthis to all by raising Him from the dead.\"\nAnd when they heard of the\nresurrection of the dead, some mocked,\nwhile others said, \"We will hear you\nagain on this matter.\"\nwhose house was next door to the\nsynagogue.\nSo Paul departed from among them.\nHowever, some men joined him and\nbelieved, among them Dionysius the\nAreopagite, a woman named Damaris,\nand others with them.\n18After these things Paul departed\nfrom Athens and went to Corinth.\nAnd he found a certain Jew named\nAquila, born in Pontus, who had recently\ncome from Italy with his wife Priscilla\n(because Claudius had commanded all\nthe Jews to depart from Rome); and he\ncame to them.\nSo, because he was of the same trade,\nhe stayed with them and worked; for by\noccupation they were tentmakers.\nAnd he reasoned in the synagogue\nevery Sabbath, and persuaded both\nJews and Greeks.\nWhen Silas and Timothy had come\nfrom Macedonia, Paul was compelled by\nthe Spirit, and testified to the Jews that\nJesus is the Christ.\nBut when they opposed him and\nblasphemed, he shook his garments\nand said to them, \"Your blood be upon\nyour own heads; I am clean. From now\non I will go to the Gentiles.\"\nAnd he departed from there and\nentered the house of a certain man\nnamed Justus, one who worshiped God,\nThen Crispus, the ruler of the\nsynagogue, believed on the Lord with all\nhis household. And many of the\nCorinthians, hearing, believed and were\nbaptized.\nNow the Lord spoke to Paul in the night\nby a vision, \"Do not be afraid, but speak,\nand do not keep silent;\nfor I am with you, and no one will\nattack you to hurt you; for I have many\npeople in this city.\"\nAnd he continued there a year and six\nmonths, teaching the word of God\namong them.\nWhen Gallio was proconsul of Achaia,\nthe Jews with one accord rose up\nagainst Paul and brought him to the\njudgment seat,\nsaying, \"This fellow persuades men to\nworship God contrary to the law.\"\nAnd when Paul was about to open his\nmouth, Gallio said to the Jews, \"If it\nwere a matter of wrongdoing or wicked\ncrimes, O Jews, there would be reason\nwhy I should bear with you.\nBut if it is a question of words and\nnames and your own law, look to it\nyourselves; for I do not want to be a\njudge of such matters.\"\nAnd he drove them from the judgment\nseat.\nThen all the Greeks took Sosthenes,\nthe ruler of the synagogue, and beat him\nbefore the judgment seat. But Gallio\ntook no notice of these things.\nSo he began to speak boldly in the\nsynagogue. When Aquila and Priscilla\nheard him, they took him aside and\nexplained to him the way of God more\naccurately.\nSo Paul still remained a good while.\nThen he took leave of the brethren and\nsailed for Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila\nwere with him. He had his hair cut off at\nCenchrea, for he had taken a vow.\nAnd when he desired to cross to\nAchaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting\nthe disciples to receive him; and when\nhe arrived, he greatly helped those who\nhad believed through grace;\nAnd he came to Ephesus, and left\nthem there; but he himself entered the\nsynagogue and reasoned with the Jews.\nfor he vigorously refuted the Jews\npublicly, showing from the Scriptures\nthat Jesus is the Christ.\nWhen they asked him to stay a longer\ntime with them, he did not consent,\nbut took leave of them, saying, \"I must\nby all means keep this coming feast in\nJerusalem; but I will return again to you,\nGod willing.\" And he sailed from\nEphesus.\nAnd when he had landed at Caesarea,\nand gone up and greeted the church, he\nwent down to Antioch.\n19And it happened, while Apollos\nwas at Corinth, that Paul, having passed\nthrough the upper regions, came to\nEphesus. And finding some disciples\nhe said to them, \"Did you receive the\nHoly Spirit when you believed?\" So they\nsaid to him, \"We have not so much as\nheard whether there is a Holy Spirit.\"\nAfter he had spent some time there,\nhe departed and went over the region of\nGalatia\nand\nPhrygia\nin\norder,\nstrengthening all the disciples.\nNow a certain Jew named Apollos,\nborn at Alexandria, an eloquent man\nand mighty in the Scriptures, came to\nEphesus.\nAnd he said to them, \"Into what then\nwere you baptized?\" So they said, \"Into\nJohn's baptism.\"\nThen Paul said, \"John indeed baptized\nwith a baptism of repentance, saying to\nthe people that they should believe on\nHim who would come after him, that is,\non Christ Jesus.\"\nThis man had been instructed in the\nway of the Lord; and being fervent in\nspirit, he spoke and taught accurately\nthe things of the Lord, though he knew\nonly the baptism of John.\nWhen they heard this, they were\nbaptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.\nAnd when Paul had laid hands on them,\nthe Holy Spirit came upon them, and\nthey spoke with tongues and prophesied.\nNow the men were about twelve in all.\nAnd he went into the synagogue and\nspoke boldly for three months,\nreasoning and persuading concerning\nthe things of the kingdom of God.\nBut when some were hardened and did\nnot believe, but spoke evil of the Way\nbefore the multitude, he departed from\nthem and withdrew the disciples,\nreasoning daily in the school of\nTyrannus.\nAnd this continued for two years, so\nthat all who dwelt in Asia heard the word\nof the Lord Jesus, both Jews and\nGreeks.\nand prevailed against them, so that they\nfled out of that house naked and\nwounded.\nThis became known both to all Jews\nand Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and\nfear fell on them all, and the name of the\nLord Jesus was magnified.\nAnd many who had believed came\nconfessing and telling their deeds.\nAlso, many of those who had practiced\nmagic brought their books together and\nburned them in the sight of all. And they\ncounted up the value of them, and it\ntotaled fifty thousand pieces of silver.\nNow God worked unusual miracles by\nthe hands of Paul,\nSo the word of the Lord grew mightily\nand prevailed.\nso that even handkerchiefs or aprons\nwere brought from his body to the sick,\nand the diseases left them and the evil\nspirits went out of them.\nWhen these things were accomplished,\nPaul purposed in the Spirit, when he\nhad passed through Macedonia and\nAchaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying,\n\"After I have been there, I must also see\nRome.\"\nThen some of the itinerant Jewish\nexorcists took it upon themselves to call\nthe name of the Lord Jesus over those\nwho had evil spirits, saying, \"We\nexorcise you by the Jesus whom Paul\npreaches.\"\nSo he sent into Macedonia two of\nthose who ministered to him, Timothy\nand Erastus, but he himself stayed in\nAsia for a time.\nAlso there were seven sons of Sceva,\na Jewish chief priest, who did so.\nAnd about that time there arose a\ngreat commotion about the Way.\nAnd the evil spirit answered and said,\n\"Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who\nare you?\"\nFor a certain man named Demetrius, a\nsilversmith, who made silver shrines of\nDiana, brought no small profit to the\ncraftsmen.\nThen the man in whom the evil spirit\nwas leaped on them, overpowered them,\nHe called them together with the\nworkers of similar occupation, and said:\n\"Men, you know that we have our\nprosperity by this trade.\nAnd Alexander motioned with his hand,\nand wanted to make his defense to the\npeople.\nMoreover you see and hear that not\nonly at Ephesus, but throughout almost\nall Asia, this Paul has persuaded and\nturned away many people, saying that\nthey are not gods which are made with\nhands.\nBut when they found out that he was a\nJew, all with one voice cried out for\nabout two hours, \"Great is Diana of the\nEphesians!\"\nSo not only is this trade of ours in\ndanger of falling into disrepute, but also\nthe temple of the great goddess Diana\nmay be despised and her magnificence\ndestroyed, whom all Asia and the world\nworship.\"\nAnd when the city clerk had quieted\nthe crowd, he said: \"Men of Ephesus,\nwhat man is there who does not know\nthat the city of the Ephesians is temple\nguardian of the great goddess Diana,\nand of the image which fell down from\nZeus?\nNow when they heard this, they were\nfull of wrath and cried out, saying,\n\"Great is Diana of the Ephesians!\"\nTherefore, since these things cannot\nbe denied, you ought to be quiet and do\nnothing rashly.\nSo the whole city was filled with\nconfusion, and rushed into the theater\nwith one accord, having seized Gaius\nand Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul's\ntravel companions.\nFor you have brought these men here\nwho are neither robbers of temples nor\nblasphemers of your goddess.\nAnd when Paul wanted to go in to the\npeople, the disciples would not allow\nhim.\nTherefore, if Demetrius and his fellow\ncraftsmen have a case against anyone,\nthe courts are open and there are\nproconsuls. Let them bring charges\nagainst one another.\nThen some of the officials of Asia, who\nwere his friends, sent to him pleading\nthat he would not venture into the\ntheater.\nBut if you have any other inquiry to\nmake, it shall be determined in the\nlawful assembly.\nSome therefore cried one thing and\nsome another, for the assembly was\nconfused, and most of them did not\nknow why they had come together.\nFor we are in danger of being called in\nquestion for today's uproar, there being\nno reason which we may give to\naccount for this disorderly gathering.\"\nAnd they drew Alexander out of the\nmultitude, the Jews putting him forward.\nAnd when he had said these things, he\ndismissed the assembly.\n20After the uproar had ceased, Paul\nhe fell down from the third story and was\ntaken up dead.\ncalled the disciples to himself, embraced\nthem, and departed to go to Macedonia.\nNow when he had gone over that\nregion and encouraged them with many\nwords, he came to Greece\nand stayed three months. And when\nthe Jews plotted against him as he was\nabout to sail to Syria, he decided to\nreturn through Macedonia.\nAnd Sopater of Berea accompanied\nhim to Asia--also Aristarchus and\nSecundus of the Thessalonians, and\nGaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and\nTychicus and Trophimus of Asia.\nBut Paul went down, fell on him, and\nembracing him said, \"Do not trouble\nyourselves, for his life is in him.\"\nNow when he had come up, had\nbroken bread and eaten, and talked a\nlong while, even till daybreak, he\ndeparted.\nAnd they brought the young man in\nalive, and they were not a little\ncomforted.\nThen we went ahead to the ship and\nsailed to Assos, there intending to take\nPaul on board; for so he had given\norders, intending himself to go on foot.\nThese men, going ahead, waited for us\nat Troas.\nAnd when he met us at Assos, we took\nhim on board and came to Mitylene.\nBut we sailed away from Philippi after\nthe Days of Unleavened Bread, and in\nfive days joined them at Troas, where\nwe stayed seven days.\nNow on the first day of the week, when\nthe disciples came together to break\nbread, Paul, ready to depart the next\nday, spoke to them and continued his\nmessage until midnight.\nThere were many lamps in the upper\nroom where they were gathered\ntogether.\nWe sailed from there, and the next day\ncame opposite Chios. The following day\nwe arrived at Samos and stayed at\nTrogyllium. The next day we came to\nMiletus.\nFor Paul had decided to sail past\nEphesus, so that he would not have to\nspend time in Asia; for he was hurrying\nto be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the\nDay of Pentecost.\nFrom Miletus he sent to Ephesus and\ncalled for the elders of the church.\nAnd in a window sat a certain young\nman named Eutychus, who was sinking\ninto a deep sleep. He was overcome by\nsleep; and as Paul continued speaking,\nAnd when they had come to him, he\nsaid to them: \"You know, from the first\nday that I came to Asia, in what manner\nI always lived among you,\nserving the Lord with all humility, with\nmany tears and trials which happened to\nme by the plotting of the Jews;\nshepherd the church of God which He\npurchased with His own blood.\nhow I kept back nothing that was\nhelpful, but proclaimed it to you, and\ntaught you publicly and from house to\nhouse,\ntestifying to Jews, and also to Greeks,\nrepentance toward God and faith toward\nour Lord Jesus Christ.\nFor I know this, that after my departure\nsavage wolves will come in among you,\nnot sparing the flock.\nAlso from among yourselves men will\nrise up, speaking perverse things, to\ndraw\naway\nthe\ndisciples\nafter\nthemselves.\nAnd see, now I go bound in the spirit\nto Jerusalem, not knowing the things\nthat will happen to me there,\nTherefore watch, and remember that\nfor three years I did not cease to warn\neveryone night and day with tears.\nexcept that the Holy Spirit testifies in\nevery city, saying that chains and\ntribulations await me.\n\"So now, brethren, I commend you to\nGod and to the word of His grace, which\nis able to build you up and give you an\ninheritance among all those who are\nsanctified.\nBut none of these things move me; nor\ndo I count my life dear to myself, so that\nI may finish my race with joy, and the\nministry which I received from the Lord\nJesus, to testify to the gospel of the\ngrace of God.\n\"And indeed, now I know that you all,\namong whom I have gone preaching the\nkingdom of God, will see my face no\nmore.\nTherefore I testify to you this day that I\nam innocent of the blood of all men.\nI have coveted no one's silver or gold\nor apparel.\nYes, you yourselves know that these\nhands have provided for my necessities,\nand for those who were with me.\nI have shown you in every way, by\nlaboring like this, that you must support\nthe weak. And remember the words of\nthe Lord Jesus, that He said, \"It is more\nblessed to give than to receive.\"'\nFor I have not shunned to declare to\nyou the whole counsel of God.\nAnd when he had said these things, he\nknelt down and prayed with them all.\nTherefore take heed to yourselves and\nto all the flock, among which the Holy\nSpirit has made you overseers, to\nThen they all wept freely, and fell on\nPaul's neck and kissed him,\nsorrowing most of all for the words\nwhich he spoke, that they would see his\nface no more. And they accompanied\nhim to the ship.\nNow this man had four virgin daughters\nwho prophesied.\n21Now it came to pass, that when\nwe had departed from them and set sail,\nrunning a straight course we came to\nCos, the following day to Rhodes, and\nfrom there to Patara.\nAnd finding a ship sailing over to\nPhoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.\nWhen we had sighted Cyprus, we\npassed it on the left, sailed to Syria, and\nlanded at Tyre; for there the ship was to\nunload her cargo.\nAnd finding disciples, we stayed there\nseven days. They told Paul through the\nSpirit not to go up to Jerusalem.\nWhen we had come to the end of those\ndays, we departed and went on our way;\nand they all accompanied us, with wives\nand children, till we were out of the city.\nAnd we knelt down on the shore and\nprayed.\nWhen we had taken our leave of one\nanother, we boarded the ship, and they\nreturned home.\nAnd when we had finished our voyage\nfrom Tyre, we came to Ptolemais,\ngreeted the brethren, and stayed with\nthem one day.\nOn the next day we who were Paul's\ncompanions departed and came to\nCaesarea, and entered the house of\nPhilip the evangelist, who was one of\nthe seven, and stayed with him.\nAnd as we stayed many days, a\ncertain prophet named Agabus came\ndown from Judea.\nWhen he had come to us, he took\nPaul's belt, bound his own hands and\nfeet, and said, \"Thus says the Holy Spirit,\n\"So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the\nman who owns this belt, and deliver him\ninto the hands of the Gentiles.\"'\nNow when we heard these things, both\nwe and those from that place pleaded\nwith him not to go up to Jerusalem.\nThen Paul answered, \"What do you\nmean by weeping and breaking my\nheart? For I am ready not only to be\nbound, but also to die at Jerusalem for\nthe name of the Lord Jesus.\"\nSo when he would not be persuaded,\nwe ceased, saying, \"The will of the Lord\nbe done.\"\nAnd after those days we packed and\nwent up to Jerusalem.\nAlso some of the disciples from\nCaesarea went with us and brought with\nthem a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an\nearly disciple, with whom we were to\nlodge.\nAnd when we had come to Jerusalem,\nthe brethren received us gladly.\nOn the following day Paul went in with\nus to James, and all the elders were\npresent.\nWhen he had greeted them, he told in\ndetail those things which God had done\namong the Gentiles through his ministry.\nexpiration of the days of purification, at\nwhich time an offering should be made\nfor each one of them.\nAnd when they heard it, they glorified\nthe Lord. And they said to him, \"You see,\nbrother, how many myriads of Jews\nthere are who have believed, and they\nare all zealous for the law;\nNow when the seven days were\nalmost ended, the Jews from Asia,\nseeing him in the temple, stirred up the\nwhole crowd and laid hands on him,\nbut they have been informed about\nyou that you teach all the Jews who are\namong the Gentiles to forsake Moses,\nsaying that they ought not to circumcise\ntheir children nor to walk according to\nthe customs.\ncrying out, \"Men of Israel, help! This is\nthe man who teaches all men\neverywhere against the people, the law,\nand this place; and furthermore he also\nbrought Greeks into the temple and has\ndefiled this holy place.\"\nWhat then? The assembly must\ncertainly meet, for they will hear that you\nhave come.\n(For they had previously seen\nTrophimus the Ephesian with him in the\ncity, whom they supposed that Paul had\nbrought into the temple.)\nTherefore do what we tell you: We\nhave four men who have taken a vow.\nTake them and be purified with them,\nand pay their expenses so that they may\nshave their heads, and that all may\nknow that those things of which they\nwere informed concerning you are\nnothing, but that you yourself also walk\norderly and keep the law.\nAnd all the city was disturbed; and the\npeople ran together, seized Paul, and\ndragged him out of the temple; and\nimmediately the doors were shut.\nNow as they were seeking to kill him,\nnews came to the commander of the\ngarrison that all Jerusalem was in an\nuproar.\nBut concerning the Gentiles who\nbelieve, we have written and decided\nthat they should observe no such thing,\nexcept\nthat\nthey\nshould\nkeep\nthemselves from things offered to idols,\nfrom blood, from things strangled, and\nfrom sexual immorality.\"\nThen Paul took the men, and the next\nday, having been purified with them,\nentered the temple to announce the\nHe immediately took soldiers and\ncenturions, and ran down to them. And\nwhen they saw the commander and the\nsoldiers, they stopped beating Paul.\nThen the commander came near and\ntook him, and commanded him to be\nbound with two chains; and he asked\nwho he was and what he had done.\nAnd some among the multitude cried\none thing and some another. So when\nhe could not ascertain the truth because\nof the tumult, he commanded him to be\ntaken into the barracks.\nfeet of Gamaliel, taught according to the\nstrictness of our fathers' law, and was\nzealous toward God as you all are today.\nWhen he reached the stairs, he had to\nbe carried by the soldiers because of\nthe violence of the mob.\nI persecuted this Way to the death,\nbinding and delivering into prisons both\nmen and women,\nFor the multitude of the people\nfollowed after, crying out, \"Away with\nhim!\"\nThen as Paul was about to be led into\nthe barracks, he said to the commander,\n\"May I speak to you?\" He replied, \"Can\nyou speak Greek?\nAre you not the Egyptian who some\ntime ago stirred up a rebellion and led\nthe four thousand assassins out into the\nwilderness?\"\nBut Paul said, \"I am a Jew from Tarsus,\nin Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city; and I\nimplore you, permit me to speak to the\npeople.\"\nas also the high priest bears me\nwitness, and all the council of the elders,\nfrom whom I also received letters to the\nbrethren, and went to Damascus to\nbring in chains even those who were\nthere to Jerusalem to be punished.\n\"Now it happened, as I journeyed and\ncame near Damascus at about noon,\nsuddenly a great light from heaven\nshone around me.\nAnd I fell to the ground and heard a\nvoice saying to me, \"Saul, Saul, why are\nyou persecuting Me?'\nSo I answered, \"Who are You, Lord?'\nAnd He said to me, \"I am Jesus of\nNazareth, whom you are persecuting.'\nSo when he had given him permission,\nPaul stood on the stairs and motioned\nwith his hand to the people. And when\nthere was a great silence, he spoke to\nthem in the Hebrew language, saying,\n22\"Brethren and fathers, hear my\ndefense before you now.\"\nAnd when they heard that he spoke to\nthem in the Hebrew language, they kept\nall the more silent. Then he said:\n\"I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of\nCilicia, but brought up in this city at the\n\"And those who were with me indeed\nsaw the light and were afraid, but they\ndid not hear the voice of Him who spoke\nto me.\nSo I said, \"What shall I do, Lord?'

Arise\nand be baptized, and wash away your\nsins, calling on the name of the Lord.'\n\"Now it happened, when I returned to\nJerusalem and was praying in the\ntemple, that I was in a trance\nand saw Him saying to me, \"Make\nhaste and get out of Jerusalem quickly,\nfor they will not receive your testimony\nconcerning Me.'\nSo I said, \"Lord, they know that in\nevery synagogue I imprisoned and beat\nthose who believe on You.\nAnd when the blood of Your martyr\nStephen was shed, I also was standing\nby consenting to his death, and\nguarding the clothes of those who were\nkilling him.'\nThen He said to me, \"Depart, for I will\nsend you far from here to the Gentiles.\"'\nWhen the centurion heard that, he\nwent and told the commander, saying,\n\"Take care what you do, for this man is\na Roman.\"\nThen the commander came and said\nto him, \"Tell me, are you a Roman?\" He\nsaid, \"Yes.\"\nThe commander answered, \"With a\nlarge sum I obtained this citizenship.\"\nAnd Paul said, \"But I was born a\ncitizen.\"\nThen immediately those who were\nabout to examine him withdrew from\nhim; and the commander was also\nafraid after he found out that he was a\nRoman, and because he had bound him.\nThe next day, because he wanted to\nknow for certain why he was accused by\nthe Jews, he released him from his\nbonds, and commanded the chief\npriests and all their council to appear,\nand brought Paul down and set him\nbefore them.\nFor Sadducees say that there is no\nresurrection--and no angel or spirit; but\nthe Pharisees confess both.\n23Then Paul, looking earnestly at\nthe council, said, \"Men and brethren, I\nhave lived in all good conscience before\nGod until this day.\"\nAnd\nthe\nhigh\npriest\nAnanias\ncommanded those who stood by him to\nstrike him on the mouth.\nThen Paul said to him, \"God will strike\nyou, you whitewashed wall! For you sit\nto judge me according to the law, and\ndo you command me to be struck\ncontrary to the law?\"\nAnd those who stood by said, \"Do you\nrevile God's high priest?\"\nThen Paul said, \"I did not know,\nbrethren, that he was the high priest; for\nit is written, \"You shall not speak evil of\na ruler of your people.\"'\nBut when Paul perceived that one part\nwere Sadducees and the other\nPharisees, he cried out in the council,\n\"Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the\nson of a Pharisee; concerning the hope\nand resurrection of the dead I am being\njudged!\"\nAnd when he had said this, a\ndissension arose between the Pharisees\nand the Sadducees; and the assembly\nwas divided.\nThen there arose a loud outcry. And the\nscribes of the Pharisees' party arose\nand protested, saying, \"We find no evil\nin this man; but if a spirit or an angel has\nspoken to him, let us not fight against\nGod.\"\nNow when there arose a great\ndissension, the commander, fearing lest\nPaul might be pulled to pieces by them,\ncommanded the soldiers to go down\nand take him by force from among them,\nand bring him into the barracks.\nBut the following night the Lord stood\nby him and said, \"Be of good cheer,\nPaul; for as you have testified for Me in\nJerusalem, so you must also bear\nwitness at Rome.\"\nAnd when it was day, some of the\nJews banded together and bound\nthemselves under an oath, saying that\nthey would neither eat nor drink till they\nhad killed Paul.\nNow there were more than forty who\nhad formed this conspiracy.\nThey came to the chief priests and\nelders, and said, \"We have bound\nourselves under a great oath that we will\neat nothing until we have killed Paul.\nNow you, therefore, together with the\ncouncil, suggest to the commander that\nhe be brought down to you tomorrow, as\nthough you were going to make further\ninquiries concerning him; but we are\nready to kill him before he comes near.\"\nspearmen to go to Caesarea at the third\nhour of the night;\nSo when Paul's sister's son heard of\ntheir ambush, he went and entered the\nbarracks and told Paul.\nand provide mounts to set Paul on,\nand bring him safely to Felix the\ngovernor.\"\nThen Paul called one of the centurions\nto him and said, \"Take this young man\nto the commander, for he has something\nto tell him.\"\nHe wrote a letter in the following\nmanner:\nClaudius Lysias, To the most excellent\ngovernor Felix: Greetings.\nSo he took him and brought him to the\ncommander and said, \"Paul the prisoner\ncalled me to him and asked me to bring\nthis young man to you. He has\nsomething to say to you.\"\nThis man was seized by the Jews and\nwas about to be killed by them. Coming\nwith the troops I rescued him, having\nlearned that he was a Roman.\nThen the commander took him by the\nhand, went aside, and asked privately,\n\"What is it that you have to tell me?\"\nAnd when I wanted to know the reason\nthey accused him, I brought him before\ntheir council.\nAnd he said, \"The Jews have agreed\nto ask that you bring Paul down to the\ncouncil tomorrow, as though they were\ngoing to inquire more fully about him.\nI found out that he was accused\nconcerning questions of their law, but\nhad nothing charged against him\ndeserving of death or chains.\nBut do not yield to them, for more than\nforty of them lie in wait for him, men who\nhave bound themselves by an oath that\nthey will neither eat nor drink till they\nhave killed him; and now they are ready,\nwaiting for the promise from you.\"\nAnd when it was told me that the Jews\nlay in wait for the man, I sent him\nimmediately\nto\nyou,\nand\nalso\ncommanded his accusers to state\nbefore you the charges against him.\nFarewell.\nSo the commander let the young man\ndepart, and commanded him, \"Tell no\none that you have revealed these things\nto me.\"\nThen the soldiers, as they were\ncommanded, took Paul and brought him\nby night to Antipatris.\nAnd he called for two centurions,\nsaying, \"Prepare two hundred soldiers,\nseventy horsemen, and two hundred\nThe next day they left the horsemen to\ngo on with him, and returned to the\nbarracks.\nWhen they came to Caesarea and had\ndelivered the letter to the governor, they\nalso presented Paul to him.\nBut the commander Lysias came by\nand with great violence took him out of\nour hands,\nAnd when the governor had read it, he\nasked what province he was from. And\nwhen he understood that he was from\nCilicia,\ncommanding his accusers to come to\nyou. By examining him yourself you may\nascertain all these things of which we\naccuse him.\"\nhe said, \"I will hear you when your\naccusers also have come.\" And he\ncommanded him to be kept in Herod's\nPraetorium.\n24Now after five days Ananias the\nhigh priest came down with the elders\nand a certain orator named Tertullus.\nThese gave evidence to the governor\nagainst Paul.\nAnd when he was called upon,\nTertullus began his accusation, saying:\n\"Seeing that through you we enjoy great\npeace, and prosperity is being brought\nto this nation by your foresight,\nAnd\nthe Jews\nalso\nassented,\nmaintaining that these things were so.\nThen Paul, after the governor had\nnodded to him to speak, answered:\n\"Inasmuch as I know that you have been\nfor many years a judge of this nation, I\ndo the more cheerfully answer for\nmyself,\nbecause you may ascertain that it is\nno more than twelve days since I went\nup to Jerusalem to worship.\nAnd they neither found me in the\ntemple disputing with anyone nor\ninciting the crowd, either in the\nsynagogues or in the city.\nwe accept it always and in all places,\nmost noble Felix, with all thankfulness.\nNor can they prove the things of which\nthey now accuse me.\nNevertheless, not to be tedious to you\nany further, I beg you to hear, by your\ncourtesy, a few words from us.\nFor we have found this man a plague, a\ncreator of dissension among all the\nJews throughout the world, and a\nringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.\nHe even tried to profane the temple,\nand we seized him, and wanted to judge\nhim according to our law.\nBut this I confess to you, that\naccording to the Way which they call a\nsect, so I worship the God of my fathers,\nbelieving all things which are written in\nthe Law and in the Prophets.\nI have hope in God, which they\nthemselves also accept, that there will\nbe a resurrection of the dead, both of\nthe just and the unjust.\nThis being so, I myself always strive to\nhave a conscience without offense\ntoward God and men.\n\"Now after many years I came to bring\nalms and offerings to my nation,\nNow\nas\nhe\nreasoned\nabout\nrighteousness, self-control, and the\njudgment to come, Felix was afraid and\nanswered, \"Go away for now; when I\nhave a convenient time I will call for\nyou.\"\nin the midst of which some Jews from\nAsia found me purified in the temple,\nneither with a mob nor with tumult.\nMeanwhile he also hoped that money\nwould be given him by Paul, that he\nmight release him. Therefore he sent for\nhim more often and conversed with him.\nThey ought to have been here before\nyou to object if they had anything\nagainst me.\nBut after two years Porcius Festus\nsucceeded Felix; and Felix, wanting to\ndo the Jews a favor, left Paul bound.\nOr else let those who are here\nthemselves say if they found any\nwrongdoing in me while I stood before\nthe council,\n25Now when Festus had come to\nthe province, after three days he went\nup from Caesarea to Jerusalem.\nunless it is for this one statement\nwhich I cried out, standing among them,\n\"Concerning the resurrection of the dead\nI am being judged by you this day.\"'\nThen the high priest and the chief men\nof the Jews informed him against Paul;\nand they petitioned him,\nBut when Felix heard these things,\nhaving more accurate knowledge of the\nWay, he adjourned the proceedings and\nsaid, \"When Lysias the commander\ncomes down, I will make a decision on\nyour case.\"\nSo he commanded the centurion to\nkeep Paul and to let him have liberty,\nand told him not to forbid any of his\nfriends to provide for or visit him.\nAnd after some days, when Felix came\nwith his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish,\nhe sent for Paul and heard him\nconcerning the faith in Christ.\nasking a favor against him, that he\nwould summon him to Jerusalem--while\nthey lay in ambush along the road to kill\nhim.\nBut Festus answered that Paul should\nbe kept at Caesarea, and that he\nhimself was going there shortly.\n\"Therefore,\" he said, \"let those who\nhave authority among you go down with\nme and accuse this man, to see if there\nis any fault in him.\"\nAnd when he had remained among\nthem more than ten days, he went down\nto Caesarea. And the next day, sitting\non the judgment seat, he commanded\nPaul to be brought.\nsaying: \"There is a certain man left a\nprisoner by Felix,\nWhen he had come, the Jews who had\ncome down from Jerusalem stood about\nand laid many serious complaints\nagainst Paul, which they could not prove,\nabout whom the chief priests and the\nelders of the Jews informed me, when I\nwas in Jerusalem, asking for a judgment\nagainst him.\nwhile he answered for himself, \"Neither\nagainst the law of the Jews, nor against\nthe temple, nor against Caesar have I\noffended in anything at all.\"\nBut Festus, wanting to do the Jews a\nfavor, answered Paul and said, \"Are you\nwilling to go up to Jerusalem and there\nbe judged before me concerning these\nthings?\"\nTo them I answered, \"It is not the\ncustom of the Romans to deliver any\nman to destruction before the accused\nmeets the accusers face to face, and\nhas opportunity to answer for himself\nconcerning the charge against him.'\nTherefore when they had come\ntogether, without any delay, the next day\nI sat on the judgment seat and\ncommanded the man to be brought in.\nSo Paul said, \"I stand at Caesar's\njudgment seat, where I ought to be\njudged. To the Jews I have done no\nwrong, as you very well know.\nWhen the accusers stood up, they\nbrought no accusation against him of\nsuch things as I supposed,\nFor if I am an offender, or have\ncommitted anything deserving of death,\nI do not object to dying; but if there is\nnothing in these things of which these\nmen accuse me, no one can deliver me\nto them. I appeal to Caesar.\"\nThen Festus, when he had conferred\nwith the council, answered, \"You have\nappealed to Caesar? To Caesar you\nshall go!\"\nAnd after some days King Agrippa and\nBernice came to Caesarea to greet\nFestus.\nbut had some questions against him\nabout their own religion and about a\ncertain Jesus, who had died, whom Paul\naffirmed to be alive.\nAnd because I was uncertain of such\nquestions, I asked whether he was\nwilling to go to Jerusalem and there be\njudged concerning these matters.\nBut when Paul appealed to be\nreserved for the decision of Augustus, I\ncommanded him to be kept till I could\nsend him to Caesar.\"\nWhen they had been there many days,\nFestus laid Paul's case before the king,\nThen Agrippa said to Festus, \"I also\nwould like to hear the man myself.\"\n\"Tomorrow,\" he said, \"you shall hear\nhim.\"\nSo the next day, when Agrippa and\nBernice had come with great pomp, and\nhad entered the auditorium with the\ncommanders and the prominent men of\nthe city, at Festus' command Paul was\nbrought in.\nAnd Festus said: \"King Agrippa and all\nthe men who are here present with us,\nyou see this man about whom the whole\nassembly of the Jews petitioned me,\nboth at Jerusalem and here, crying out\nthat he was not fit to live any longer.\ndo with the Jews. Therefore I beg you to\nhear me patiently.\n\"My manner of life from my youth,\nwhich was spent from the beginning\namong my own nation at Jerusalem, all\nthe Jews know.\nThey knew me from the first, if they\nwere willing to testify, that according to\nthe strictest sect of our religion I lived a\nPharisee.\nBut when I found that he had\ncommitted nothing deserving of death,\nand that he himself had appealed to\nAugustus, I decided to send him.\nI have nothing certain to write to my\nlord concerning him. Therefore I have\nbrought him out before you, and\nespecially before you, King Agrippa, so\nthat after the examination has taken\nplace I may have something to write.\nFor it seems to me unreasonable to\nsend a prisoner and not to specify the\ncharges against him.\"\nAnd now I stand and am judged for the\nhope of the promise made by God to our\nfathers.\nTo this promise our twelve tribes,\nearnestly serving God night and day,\nhope to attain. For this hope's sake,\nKing Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.\nWhy should it be thought incredible by\nyou that God raises the dead?\n\"Indeed, I myself thought I must do\nmany things contrary to the name of\nJesus of Nazareth.\n26Then Agrippa said to Paul, \"You\nare permitted to speak for yourself.\" So\nPaul stretched out his hand and\nanswered for himself:\nThis I also did in Jerusalem, and many\nof the saints I shut up in prison, having\nreceived authority from the chief priests;\nand when they were put to death, I cast\nmy vote against them.\n\"I think myself happy, King Agrippa,\nbecause today I shall answer for myself\nbefore you concerning all the things of\nwhich I am accused by the Jews,\nespecially because you are expert in all\ncustoms and questions which have to\nAnd I punished them often in every\nsynagogue and compelled them to\nblaspheme; and being exceedingly\nenraged against them, I persecuted\nthem even to foreign cities.\n\"While thus occupied, as I journeyed to\nDamascus\nwith\nauthority\nand\ncommission from the chief priests,\nthroughout all the region of Judea, and\nthen to the Gentiles, that they should\nrepent, turn to God, and do works\nbefitting repentance.\nat midday, O king, along the road I\nsaw a light from heaven, brighter than\nthe sun, shining around me and those\nwho journeyed with me.\nFor these reasons the Jews seized me\nin the temple and tried to kill me.\nAnd when we all had fallen to the\nground, I heard a voice speaking to me\nand saying in the Hebrew language,\n\"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting\nMe? It is hard for you to kick against the\ngoads.'\nSo I said, \"Who are You, Lord?' And\nHe said, \"I am Jesus, whom you are\npersecuting.\nTherefore, having obtained help from\nGod, to this day I stand, witnessing both\nto small and great, saying no other\nthings than those which the prophets\nand Moses said would come-23\nthat the Christ would suffer, that He\nwould be the first to rise from the dead,\nand would proclaim light to the Jewish\npeople and to the Gentiles.\"\nBut rise and stand on your feet; for I\nhave appeared to you for this purpose,\nto make you a minister and a witness\nboth of the things which you have seen\nand of the things which I will yet reveal\nto you.\nI will deliver you from the Jewish\npeople, as well as from the Gentiles, to\nwhom I now send you,\nto open their eyes, in order to turn\nthem from darkness to light, and from\nthe power of Satan to God, that they\nmay receive forgiveness of sins and an\ninheritance among those who are\nsanctified by faith in Me.'\nNow as he thus made his defense,\nFestus said with a loud voice, \"Paul, you\nare beside yourself! Much learning is\ndriving you mad!\"\nBut he said, \"I am not mad, most noble\nFestus, but speak the words of truth and\nreason.\nFor the king, before whom I also speak\nfreely, knows these things; for I am\nconvinced that none of these things\nescapes his attention, since this thing\nwas not done in a corner.\nKing Agrippa, do you believe the\nprophets? I know that you do believe.\"\n\"Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not\ndisobedient to the heavenly vision,\nThen Agrippa said to Paul, \"You\nalmost persuade me to become a\nChristian.\"\nbut declared\nDamascus and\nfirst to those in\nin Jerusalem, and\nAnd Paul said, \"I would to God that not\nonly you, but also all who hear me today,\nmight become both almost and\naltogether such as I am, except for\nthese chains.\"\nThere the centurion found an\nAlexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and he\nput us on board.\nWhen he had said these things, the\nking stood up, as well as the governor\nand Bernice and those who sat with\nthem;\nWhen we had sailed slowly many days,\nand arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, the\nwind not permitting us to proceed, we\nsailed under the shelter of Crete off\nSalmone.\nand when they had gone aside, they\ntalked among themselves, saying, \"This\nman is doing nothing deserving of death\nor chains.\"\nPassing it with difficulty, we came to a\nplace called Fair Havens, near the city\nof Lasea.\nThen Agrippa said to Festus, \"This\nman might have been set free if he had\nnot appealed to Caesar.\"\n27And when it was decided that we\nshould sail to Italy, they delivered Paul\nand some other prisoners to one named\nJulius, a centurion of the Augustan\nRegiment.\nSo, entering a ship of Adramyttium, we\nput to sea, meaning to sail along the\ncoasts\nof\nAsia.\nAristarchus,\na\nMacedonian of Thessalonica, was with\nus.\nAnd the next day we landed at Sidon.\nAnd Julius treated Paul kindly and gave\nhim liberty to go to his friends and\nreceive care.\nWhen we had put to sea from there, we\nsailed under the shelter of Cyprus,\nbecause the winds were contrary.\nAnd when we had sailed over the sea\nwhich is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we\ncame to Myra, a city of Lycia.\nNow when much time had been spent,\nand sailing was now dangerous\nbecause the Fast was already over,\nPaul advised them,\nsaying, \"Men, I perceive that this\nvoyage will end with disaster and much\nloss, not only of the cargo and ship, but\nalso our lives.\"\nNevertheless the centurion was more\npersuaded by the helmsman and the\nowner of the ship than by the things\nspoken by Paul.\nAnd because the harbor was not\nsuitable to winter in, the majority\nadvised to set sail from there also, if by\nany means they could reach Phoenix, a\nharbor of Crete opening toward the\nsouthwest and northwest, and winter\nthere.\nWhen the south wind blew softly,\nsupposing that they had obtained their\ndesire, putting out to sea, they sailed\nclose by Crete.\nBut not long after, a tempestuous head\nwind arose, called Euroclydon.\nSo when the ship was caught, and\ncould not head into the wind, we let her\ndrive.\nAnd running under the shelter of an\nisland called Clauda, we secured the\nskiff with difficulty.\nsaying, \"Do not be afraid, Paul; you\nmust be brought before Caesar; and\nindeed God has granted you all those\nwho sail with you.'\nTherefore take heart, men, for I\nbelieve God that it will be just as it was\ntold me.\nHowever, we must run aground on a\ncertain island.\"\nWhen they had taken it on board, they\nused cables to undergird the ship; and\nfearing lest they should run aground on\nthe Syrtis Sands, they struck sail and so\nwere driven.\nNow when the fourteenth night had\ncome, as we were driven up and down\nin the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the\nsailors sensed that they were drawing\nnear some land.\nAnd because we were exceedingly\ntempest-tossed, the next day they\nlightened the ship.\nOn the third day we threw the ship's\ntackle overboard with our own hands.\nAnd they took soundings and found it\nto be twenty fathoms; and when they\nhad gone a little farther, they took\nsoundings again and found it to be\nfifteen fathoms.\nNow when neither sun nor stars\nappeared for many days, and no small\ntempest beat on us, all hope that we\nwould be saved was finally given up.\nThen, fearing lest we should run\naground on the rocks, they dropped four\nanchors from the stern, and prayed for\nday to come.\nBut after long abstinence from food,\nthen Paul stood in the midst of them and\nsaid, \"Men, you should have listened to\nme, and not have sailed from Crete and\nincurred this disaster and loss.\nAnd as the sailors were seeking to\nescape from the ship, when they had let\ndown the skiff into the sea, under\npretense of putting out anchors from the\nprow,\nAnd now I urge you to take heart, for\nthere will be no loss of life among you,\nbut only of the ship.\nPaul said to the centurion and the\nsoldiers, \"Unless these men stay in the\nship, you cannot be saved.\"\nFor there stood by me this night an\nangel of the God to whom I belong and\nwhom I serve,\nThen the soldiers cut away the ropes\nof the skiff and let it fall off.\nAnd as day was about to dawn, Paul\nimplored them all to take food, saying,\n\"Today is the fourteenth day you have\nwaited and continued without food, and\neaten nothing.\nTherefore I urge you to take\nnourishment, for this is for your survival,\nsince not a hair will fall from the head of\nany of you.\"\nAnd the soldiers' plan was to kill the\nprisoners, lest any of them should swim\naway and escape.\nBut the centurion, wanting to save\nPaul, kept them from their purpose, and\ncommanded that those who could swim\nshould jump overboard first and get to\nland,\nAnd when he had said these things, he\ntook bread and gave thanks to God in\nthe presence of them all; and when he\nhad broken it he began to eat.\nThen they were all encouraged, and\nalso took food themselves.\nAnd in all we were two hundred and\nseventy-six persons on the ship.\nSo when they had eaten enough, they\nlightened the ship and threw out the\nwheat into the sea.\nand the rest, some on boards and\nsome on parts of the ship. And so it was\nthat they all escaped safely to land.\n28Now when they had escaped, they\nthen found out that the island was called\nMalta.\nAnd the natives showed us unusual\nkindness; for they kindled a fire and\nmade us all welcome, because of the\nrain that was falling and because of the\ncold.\nWhen it was day, they did not\nrecognize the land; but they observed a\nbay with a beach, onto which they\nplanned to run the ship if possible.\nBut when Paul had gathered a bundle\nof sticks and laid them on the fire, a\nviper came out because of the heat, and\nfastened on his hand.\nAnd they let go the anchors and left\nthem in the sea, meanwhile loosing the\nrudder ropes; and they hoisted the\nmainsail to the wind and made for shore.\nBut striking a place where two seas\nmet, they ran the ship aground; and the\nprow\nstuck\nfast\nand\nremained\nimmovable, but the stern was being\nbroken up by the violence of the waves.\nSo when the natives saw the creature\nhanging from his hand, they said to one\nanother, \"No doubt this man is a\nmurderer, whom, though he has\nescaped the sea, yet justice does not\nallow to live.\"\nBut he shook off the creature into the\nfire and suffered no harm.\nHowever, they were expecting that he\nwould swell up or suddenly fall down\ndead. But after they had looked for a\nlong time and saw no harm come to him,\nthey changed their minds and said that\nhe was a god.\nWhen Paul saw them, he thanked God\nand took courage.\nIn that region there was an estate of the\nleading citizen of the island, whose\nname was Publius, who received us and\nentertained us courteously for three\ndays.\nNow when we came to Rome, the\ncenturion delivered the prisoners to the\ncaptain of the guard; but Paul was\npermitted to dwell by himself with the\nsoldier who guarded him.\nSo when this was done, the rest of\nthose on the island who had diseases\nalso came and were healed.\nAnd it came to pass after three days\nthat Paul called the leaders of the Jews\ntogether. So when they had come\ntogether, he said to them: \"Men and\nbrethren, though I have done nothing\nagainst our people or the customs of our\nfathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner\nfrom Jerusalem into the hands of the\nRomans,\nThey also honored us in many ways;\nand when we departed, they provided\nsuch things as were necessary.\nwho, when they had examined me,\nwanted to let me go, because there was\nno cause for putting me to death.\nAfter three months we sailed in an\nAlexandrian ship whose figurehead was\nthe Twin Brothers, which had wintered\nat the island.\nBut when the Jews spoke against it, I\nwas compelled to appeal to Caesar, not\nthat I had anything of which to accuse\nmy nation.\nAnd it happened that the father of\nPublius lay sick of a fever and dysentery.\nPaul went in to him and prayed, and he\nlaid his hands on him and healed him.\nAnd landing at Syracuse, we stayed\nthree days.\nFrom there we circled round and\nreached Rhegium. And after one day\nthe south wind blew; and the next day\nwe came to Puteoli,\nwhere we found brethren, and were\ninvited to stay with them seven days.\nAnd so we went toward Rome.\nAnd from there, when the brethren\nheard about us, they came to meet us\nas far as Appii Forum and Three Inns.\nFor this reason therefore I have called\nfor you, to see you and speak with you,\nbecause for the hope of Israel I am\nbound with this chain.\"\nThen they said to him, \"We neither\nreceived letters from Judea concerning\nyou, nor have any of the brethren who\ncame reported or spoken any evil of you.\nBut we desire to hear from you what\nyou think; for concerning this sect, we\nknow that it is spoken against\neverywhere.\"\nSo when they had appointed him a\nday, many came to him at his lodging, to\nwhom he explained and solemnly\ntestified of the kingdom of God,\npersuading them concerning Jesus from\nboth the Law of Moses and the Prophets,\nfrom morning till evening.\nFor the hearts of this people have\ngrown dull. Their ears are hard of\nhearing, And their eyes they have\nclosed, Lest they should see with their\neyes and hear with their ears, Lest they\nshould understand with their hearts and\nturn, So that I should heal them.\"'\nAnd some were persuaded by the\nthings which were spoken, and some\ndisbelieved.\n\"Therefore let it be known to you that\nthe salvation of God has been sent to\nthe Gentiles, and they will hear it!\"\nSo when they did not agree among\nthemselves, they departed after Paul\nhad said one word: \"The Holy Spirit\nspoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet\nto our fathers,\nsaying, \"Go to this people and say:\n\"Hearing you will hear, and shall not\nunderstand; And seeing you will see,\nand not perceive;\nAnd when he had said these words,\nthe Jews departed and had a great\ndispute among themselves.\nThen Paul dwelt two whole years in his\nown rented house, and received all who\ncame to him,\npreaching the kingdom of God and\nteaching the things which concern the\nLord Jesus Christ with all confidence, no\none forbidding him.\nRomans\n1Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ,\ncalled to be an apostle, separated to the\ngospel of God\nwhich He promised before through His\nprophets in the Holy Scriptures,\nconcerning His Son Jesus Christ our\nLord, who was born of the seed of David\naccording to the flesh,\nand declared to be the Son of God with\npower according to the Spirit of holiness,\nby the resurrection from the dead.\nThrough Him we have received grace\nand apostleship for obedience to the\nfaith among all nations for His name,\namong whom you also are the called of\nJesus Christ;\nTo all who are in Rome, beloved of God,\ncalled to be saints: Grace to you and\npeace from God our Father and the Lord\nJesus Christ.\nFirst, I thank my God through Jesus\nChrist for you all, that your faith is\nspoken of throughout the whole world.\nFor God is my witness, whom I serve\nwith my spirit in the gospel of His Son,\nthat without ceasing I make mention of\nyou always in my prayers,\nmaking request if, by some means,\nnow at last I may find a way in the will of\nGod to come to you.\nFor I long to see you, that I may impart\nto you some spiritual gift, so that you\nmay be established-12\nthat is, that I may be encouraged\ntogether with you by the mutual faith\nboth of you and me.\nNow I do not want you to be unaware,\nbrethren, that I often planned to come to\nyou (but was hindered until now), that I\nmight have some fruit among you also,\njust as among the other Gentiles.\nI am a debtor both to Greeks and to\nbarbarians, both to wise and to unwise.\nSo, as much as is in me, I am ready to\npreach the gospel to you who are in\nRome also.\nFor I am not ashamed of the gospel of\nChrist, for it is the power of God to\nsalvation for everyone who believes, for\nthe Jew first and also for the Greek.\nFor in it the righteousness of God is\nrevealed from faith to faith; as it is\nwritten, \"The just shall live by faith.\"\nFor the wrath of God is revealed from\nheaven against all ungodliness and\nunrighteousness of men, who suppress\nthe truth in unrighteousness,\nbecause what may be known of God is\nmanifest in them, for God has shown it\nto them.\n1men committing what is shameful, and\nreceiving in themselves the penalty of\ntheir error which was due.\nFor since the creation of the world His\ninvisible attributes are clearly seen,\nbeing understood by the things that are\nmade, even His eternal power and\nGodhead, so that they are without\nexcuse,\nbecause, although they knew God,\nthey did not glorify Him as God, nor\nwere thankful, but became futile in their\nthoughts, and their foolish hearts were\ndarkened.\nProfessing to be wise, they became\nfools,\nAnd even as they did not like to retain\nGod in their knowledge, God gave them\nover to a debased mind, to do those\nthings which are not fitting;\nbeing filled with all unrighteousness,\nsexual\nimmorality,\nwickedness,\ncovetousness, maliciousness; full of\nenvy, murder, strife, deceit, evilmindedness; they are whisperers,\nbackbiters, haters of God, violent,\nproud, boasters, inventors of evil things,\ndisobedient to parents,\nand changed the glory of the\nincorruptible God into an image made\nlike corruptible man--and birds and fourfooted animals and creeping things.\nTherefore God also gave them up to\nuncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts,\nto dishonor their bodies among\nthemselves,\nwho exchanged the truth of God for\nthe lie, and worshiped and served the\ncreature rather than the Creator, who is\nblessed forever. Amen.\nFor this reason God gave them up to\nvile passions. For even their women\nexchanged the natural use for what is\nagainst nature.\nLikewise also the men, leaving the\nnatural use of the woman, burned in\ntheir lust for one another, 1men with\nundiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving,\nunforgiving, unmerciful;\nwho, knowing the righteous judgment\nof God, that those who practice such\nthings are deserving of death, not only\ndo the same but also approve of those\nwho practice them.\n2Therefore you are inexcusable, O\nman, whoever you are who judge, for in\nwhatever you judge another you\ncondemn yourself; for you who judge\npractice the same things.\nBut we know that the judgment of God\nis according to truth against those who\npractice such things.\nAnd do you think this, O man, you who\njudge those practicing such things, and\ndoing the same, that you will escape the\njudgment of God?\nOr do you despise the riches of His\ngoodness,\nforbearance,\nand\nlongsuffering, not knowing that the\ngoodness of God leads you to\nrepentance?\nfor when Gentiles, who do not have\nthe law, by nature do the things in the\nlaw, these, although not having the law,\nare a law to themselves,\nBut in accordance with your hardness\nand your impenitent heart you are\ntreasuring up for yourself wrath in the\nday of wrath and revelation of the\nrighteous judgment of God,\nwho show the work of the law written\nin their hearts, their conscience also\nbearing\nwitness,\nand\nbetween\nthemselves their thoughts accusing or\nelse excusing them)\nwho \"will render to each one according\nto his deeds\":\nin the day when God will judge the\nsecrets of men by Jesus Christ,\naccording to my gospel.\neternal life to those who by patient\ncontinuance in doing good seek for glory,\nhonor, and immortality;\nIndeed you are called a Jew, and rest\non the law, and make your boast in God,\nbut to those who are self-seeking and\ndo not obey the truth, but obey\nunrighteousness--indignation and wrath,\nand know His will, and approve the\nthings that are excellent, being\ninstructed out of the law,\ntribulation and anguish, on every soul\nof man who does evil, of the Jew first\nand also of the Greek;\nand are confident that you yourself are\na guide to the blind, a light to those who\nare in darkness,\nbut glory, honor, and peace to\neveryone who works what is good, to\nthe Jew first and also to the Greek.\nan instructor of the foolish, a teacher\nof babes, having the form of knowledge\nand truth in the law.\nFor there is no partiality with God.\nFor as many as have sinned without\nlaw will also perish without law, and as\nmany as have sinned in the law will be\njudged by the law\nYou, therefore, who teach another, do\nyou not teach yourself? You who preach\nthat a man should not steal, do you\nsteal?\nYou who say, \"Do not commit\nadultery,\" do you commit adultery? You\nwho abhor idols, do you rob temples?\n(for not the hearers of the law are just\nin the sight of God, but the doers of the\nlaw will be justified;\nYou who make your boast in the law,\ndo you dishonor God through breaking\nthe law?\nFor \"the name of God is blasphemed\namong the Gentiles because of you,\" as\nit is written.\n\"That You may be justified in Your\nwords, And may overcome when You\nare judged.\"\nFor circumcision is indeed profitable if\nyou keep the law; but if you are a\nbreaker of the law, your circumcision\nhas become uncircumcision.\nBut\nif\nour\nunrighteousness\ndemonstrates the righteousness of God,\nwhat shall we say? Is God unjust who\ninflicts wrath? (I speak as a man.)\nTherefore, if an uncircumcised man\nkeeps the righteous requirements of the\nlaw, will not his uncircumcision be\ncounted as circumcision?\nAnd\nwill\nnot\nthe\nphysically\nuncircumcised, if he fulfills the law,\njudge you who, even with your written\ncode\nand\ncircumcision,\nare\na\ntransgressor of the law?\nFor he is not a Jew who is one\noutwardly, nor is circumcision that which\nis outward in the flesh;\nbut he is a Jew who is one inwardly;\nand circumcision is that of the heart, in\nthe Spirit, not in the letter; whose praise\nis not from men but from God.\n3What advantage then has the Jew, or\nCertainly not! For then how will God\njudge the world?\nFor if the truth of God has increased\nthrough my lie to His glory, why am I\nalso still judged as a sinner?\nAnd why not say, \"Let us do evil that\ngood\nmay\ncome\"?--as\nwe\nare\nslanderously reported and as some\naffirm that we say. Their condemnation\nis just.\nWhat then? Are we better than they?\nNot at all. For we have previously\ncharged both Jews and Greeks that they\nare all under sin.\nAs it is written: \"There is none\nrighteous, no, not one;\nwhat is the profit of circumcision?\nThere is none who understands; There\nis none who seeks after God.\nMuch in every way! Chiefly because to\nthem were committed the oracles of\nGod.\nThey have all turned aside; They have\ntogether become unprofitable; There is\nnone who does good, no, not one.\"\nFor what if some did not believe? Will\ntheir unbelief make the faithfulness of\nGod without effect?\nCertainly not! Indeed, let God be true\nbut every man a liar. As it is written:\n\"Their throat is an open tomb; With\ntheir tongues they have practiced\ndeceit\"; \"The poison of asps is under\ntheir lips\";\n\"Whose mouth is full of cursing and\nbitterness.\"\nbecause in His forbearance God had\npassed over the sins that were\npreviously committed,\n\"Their feet are swift to shed blood;\nDestruction and misery are in their\nways;\nto demonstrate at the present time His\nrighteousness, that He might be just and\nthe justifier of the one who has faith in\nJesus.\nAnd the way of peace they have not\nknown.\"\n\"There is no fear of God before their\neyes.\"\nNow we know that whatever the law\nsays, it says to those who are under the\nlaw, that every mouth may be stopped,\nand all the world may become guilty\nbefore God.\nWhere is boasting then? It is excluded.\nBy what law? Of works? No, but by the\nlaw of faith.\nTherefore we conclude that a man is\njustified by faith apart from the deeds of\nthe law.\nOr is He the God of the Jews only? Is\nHe not also the God of the Gentiles?\nYes, of the Gentiles also,\nTherefore by the deeds of the law no\nflesh will be justified in His sight, for by\nthe law is the knowledge of sin.\nsince there is one God who will justify\nthe circumcised by faith and the\nuncircumcised through faith.\nBut now the righteousness of God\napart from the law is revealed, being\nwitnessed by the Law and the Prophets,\nDo we then make void the law through\nfaith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we\nestablish the law.\neven the righteousness of God,\nthrough faith in Jesus Christ, to all and\non all who believe. For there is no\ndifference;\nfor all have sinned and fall short of the\nglory of God,\nbeing justified freely by His grace\nthrough the redemption that is in Christ\nJesus,\nwhom God set forth as a propitiation\nby His blood, through faith, to\ndemonstrate\nHis\nrighteousness,\n4What then shall we say that Abraham\nour father has found according to the\nflesh?\nFor if Abraham was justified by works,\nhe has something to boast about, but\nnot before God.\nFor what does the Scripture say?\n\"Abraham believed God, and it was\naccounted to him for righteousness.\"\nNow to him who works, the wages are\nnot counted as grace but as debt.\nwhich our father Abraham had while still\nuncircumcised.\nBut to him who does not work but\nbelieves on Him who justifies the\nungodly, his faith is accounted for\nrighteousness,\nFor the promise that he would be the\nheir of the world was not to Abraham or\nto his seed through the law, but through\nthe righteousness of faith.\njust as David also describes the\nblessedness of the man to whom God\nimputes righteousness apart from\nworks:\nFor if those who are of the law are\nheirs, faith is made void and the promise\nmade of no effect,\n\"BBlessed are those whose lawless\ndeeds are forgiven, And whose sins are\ncovered;\nbecause the law brings about wrath;\nfor where there is no law there is no\ntransgression.\nBlessed is the man to whom the LORD\nshall not impute sin.\"\nDoes this blessedness then come upon\nthe circumcised only, or upon the\nuncircumcised also? For we say that\nfaith was accounted to Abraham for\nrighteousness.\nHow then was it accounted? While he\nwas circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not\nwhile\ncircumcised,\nbut\nwhile\nuncircumcised.\nAnd he received the sign of\ncircumcision,\na\nseal\nof\nthe\nrighteousness of the faith which he had\nwhile still uncircumcised, that he might\nbe the father of all those who believe,\nthough they are uncircumcised, that\nrighteousness might be imputed to them\nalso,\nand the father of circumcision to those\nwho not only are of the circumcision, but\nwho also walk in the steps of the faith\nTherefore it is of faith that it might be\naccording to grace, so that the promise\nmight be sure to all the seed, not only to\nthose who are of the law, but also to\nthose who are of the faith of Abraham,\nwho is the father of us all\n(as it is written, \"I have made you a\nfather of many nations\" ) in the presence\nof Him whom he believed--God, who\ngives life to the dead and calls those\nthings which do not exist as though they\ndid;\nwho, contrary to hope, in hope\nbelieved, so that he became the father\nof many nations, according to what was\nspoken, \"So shall your descendants be.\"\nAnd not being weak in faith, he did not\nconsider his own body, already dead\n(since he was about a hundred years\nold), and the deadness of Sarah's womb.\nHe did not waver at the promise of\nGod through unbelief, but was\nstrengthened in faith, giving glory to God,\nand being fully convinced that what He\nhad promised He was also able to\nperform.\nFor scarcely for a righteous man will\none die; yet perhaps for a good man\nsomeone would even dare to die.\nAnd therefore \"it was accounted to him\nfor righteousness.\"\nBut God demonstrates His own love\ntoward us, in that while we were still\nsinners, Christ died for us.\nNow it was not written for his sake\nalone that it was imputed to him,\nbut also for us. It shall be imputed to\nus who believe in Him who raised up\nJesus our Lord from the dead,\nwho was delivered up because of our\noffenses, and was raised because of our\njustification.\n5Therefore, having been justified by\nfaith, we have peace with God through\nour Lord Jesus Christ,\nthrough whom also we have access by\nfaith into this grace in which we stand,\nand rejoice in hope of the glory of God.\nAnd not only that, but we also glory in\ntribulations, knowing that tribulation\nproduces perseverance;\nand perseverance,\ncharacter, hope.\nFor if when we were enemies we were\nreconciled to God through the death of\nHis Son, much more, having been\nreconciled, we shall be saved by His life.\nAnd not only that, but we also rejoice\nin God through our Lord Jesus Christ,\nthrough whom we have now received\nthe reconciliation.\nTherefore, just as through one man sin\nentered the world, and death through sin,\nand thus death spread to all men,\nbecause all sinned-(For until the law sin was in the world,\nbut sin is not imputed when there is no\nlaw.\ncharacter;\nand\nNow hope does not disappoint,\nbecause the love of God has been\npoured out in our hearts by the Holy\nSpirit who was given to us.\nMuch more then, having now been\njustified by His blood, we shall be saved\nfrom wrath through Him.\nFor when we were still without strength,\nin due time Christ died for the ungodly.\nNevertheless death reigned from\nAdam to Moses, even over those who\nhad not sinned according to the likeness\nof the transgression of Adam, who is a\ntype of Him who was to come.\nBut the free gift is not like the offense.\nFor if by the one man's offense many\ndied, much more the grace of God and\nthe gift by the grace of the one Man,\nJesus Christ, abounded to many.\nAnd the gift is not like that which came\nthrough the one who sinned. For the\njudgment which came from one offense\nresulted in condemnation, but the free\ngift which came from many offenses\nresulted in justification.\nFor if by the one man's offense death\nreigned through the one, much more\nthose who receive abundance of grace\nand of the gift of righteousness will reign\nin life through the One, Jesus Christ.)\nTherefore, as through one man's\noffense judgment came to all men,\nresulting in condemnation, even so\nthrough one Man's righteous act the free\ngift came to all men, resulting in\njustification of life.\nFor as by one man's disobedience\nmany were made sinners, so also by\none Man's obedience many will be\nmade righteous.\nMoreover the law entered that the\noffense might abound. But where sin\nabounded, grace abounded much more,\nso that as sin reigned in death, even\nso\ngrace\nmight\nreign\nthrough\nrighteousness to eternal life through\nJesus Christ our Lord.\n6What shall we say then? Shall we\nOr do you not know that as many of us\nas were baptized into Christ Jesus were\nbaptized into His death?\nTherefore we were buried with Him\nthrough baptism into death, that just as\nChrist was raised from the dead by the\nglory of the Father, even so we also\nshould walk in newness of life.\nFor if we have been united together in\nthe likeness of His death, certainly we\nalso shall be in the likeness of His\nresurrection,\nknowing this, that our old man was\ncrucified with Him, that the body of sin\nmight be done away with, that we\nshould no longer be slaves of sin.\nFor he who has died has been freed\nfrom sin.\nNow if we died with Christ, we believe\nthat we shall also live with Him,\nknowing that Christ, having been raised\nfrom the dead, dies no more. Death no\nlonger has dominion over Him.\nFor the death that He died, He died to\nsin once for all; but the life that He lives,\nHe lives to God.\ncontinue in sin that grace may abound?\nLikewise you also, reckon yourselves\nto be dead indeed to sin, but alive to\nGod in Christ Jesus our Lord.\nCertainly not! How shall we who died to\nsin live any longer in it?\nTherefore do not let sin reign in your\nmortal body, that you should obey it in\nits lusts.\nAnd do not present your members as\ninstruments of unrighteousness to sin,\nbut present yourselves to God as being\nalive from the dead, and your members\nas instruments of righteousness to God.\nBut now having been set free from sin,\nand having become slaves of God, you\nhave your fruit to holiness, and the end,\neverlasting life.\nFor sin shall not have dominion over\nyou, for you are not under law but under\ngrace.\nWhat then? Shall we sin because we\nare not under law but under grace?\nCertainly not!\nDo you not know that to whom you\npresent yourselves slaves to obey, you\nare that one's slaves whom you obey,\nwhether of sin leading to death, or of\nobedience leading to righteousness?\nBut God be thanked that though you\nwere slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from\nthe heart that form of doctrine to which\nyou were delivered.\nFor the wages of sin is death, but the\ngift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus\nour Lord.\n7Or do you not know, brethren (for I\nspeak to those who know the law), that\nthe law has dominion over a man as\nlong as he lives?\nFor the woman who has a husband is\nbound by the law to her husband as\nlong as he lives. But if the husband dies,\nshe is released from the law of her\nhusband.\nAnd having been set free from sin, you\nbecame slaves of righteousness.\nSo then if, while her husband lives, she\nmarries another man, she will be called\nan adulteress; but if her husband dies,\nshe is free from that law, so that she is\nno adulteress, though she has married\nanother man.\nI speak in human terms because of the\nweakness of your flesh. For just as you\npresented your members as slaves of\nuncleanness, and of lawlessness\nleading to more lawlessness, so now\npresent your members as slaves of\nrighteousness for holiness.\nTherefore, my brethren, you also have\nbecome dead to the law through the\nbody of Christ, that you may be married\nto another--to Him who was raised from\nthe dead, that we should bear fruit to\nGod.\nFor when you were slaves of sin, you\nwere free in regard to righteousness.\nWhat fruit did you have then in the\nthings of which you are now ashamed?\nFor the end of those things is death.\nFor when we were in the flesh, the\nsinful passions which were aroused by\nthe law were at work in our members to\nbear fruit to death.\nBut now we have been delivered from\nthe law, having died to what we were\nheld by, so that we should serve in the\nnewness of the Spirit and not in the\noldness of the letter.\nIf, then, I do what I will not to do, I\nagree with the law that it is good.\nWhat shall we say then? Is the law sin?\nCertainly not! On the contrary, I would\nnot have known sin except through the\nlaw. For I would not have known\ncovetousness unless the law had said,\n\"You shall not covet.\"\nBut now, it is no longer I who do it, but\nsin that dwells in me.\nFor I know that in me (that is, in my\nflesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is\npresent with me, but how to perform\nwhat is good I do not find.\nBut sin, taking opportunity by the\ncommandment, produced in me all\nmanner of evil desire. For apart from the\nlaw sin was dead.\nFor the good that I will to do, I do not\ndo; but the evil I will not to do, that I\npractice.\nI was alive once without the law, but\nwhen the commandment came, sin\nrevived and I died.\nNow if I do what I will not to do, it is no\nlonger I who do it, but sin that dwells in\nme.\nAnd the commandment, which was to\nbring life, I found to bring death.\nI find then a law, that evil is present\nwith me, the one who wills to do good.\nFor sin, taking occasion by the\ncommandment, deceived me, and by it\nkilled me.\nFor I delight in the law of God\naccording to the inward man.\nTherefore the law is holy, and the\ncommandment holy and just and good.\nHas then what is good become death\nto me? Certainly not! But sin, that it\nmight appear sin, was producing death\nin me through what is good, so that sin\nthrough the commandment might\nbecome exceedingly sinful.\nFor we know that the law is spiritual,\nbut I am carnal, sold under sin.\nFor what I am doing, I do not\nunderstand. For what I will to do, that I\ndo not practice; but what I hate, that I do.\nBut I see another law in my members,\nwarring against the law of my mind, and\nbringing me into captivity to the law of\nsin which is in my members.\nO wretched man that I am! Who will\ndeliver me from this body of death?\nI thank God--through Jesus Christ our\nLord! So then, with the mind I myself\nserve the law of God, but with the flesh\nthe law of sin.\n8There is therefore now no\ncondemnation to those who are in Christ\nJesus, who do not walk according to the\nflesh, but according to the Spirit.\nFor the law of the Spirit of life in Christ\nJesus has made me free from the law of\nsin and death.\nFor what the law could not do in that it\nwas weak through the flesh, God did by\nsending His own Son in the likeness of\nsinful flesh, on account of sin: He\ncondemned sin in the flesh,\nthat the righteous requirement of the\nlaw might be fulfilled in us who do not\nwalk according to the flesh but\naccording to the Spirit.\nBut if the Spirit of Him who raised\nJesus from the dead dwells in you, He\nwho raised Christ from the dead will also\ngive life to your mortal bodies through\nHis Spirit who dwells in you.\nTherefore, brethren, we are debtors-not to the flesh, to live according to the\nflesh.\nFor if you live according to the flesh\nyou will die; but if by the Spirit you put to\ndeath the deeds of the body, you will\nlive.\nFor as many as are led by the Spirit of\nGod, these are sons of God.\nFor those who live according to the\nflesh set their minds on the things of the\nflesh, but those who live according to\nthe Spirit, the things of the Spirit.\nFor you did not receive the spirit of\nbondage again to fear, but you received\nthe Spirit of adoption by whom we cry\nout, \"Abba, Father.\"\nFor to be carnally minded is death, but\nto be spiritually minded is life and peace.\nThe Spirit Himself bears witness with\nour spirit that we are children of God,\nBecause the carnal mind is enmity\nagainst God; for it is not subject to the\nlaw of God, nor indeed can be.\nand if children, then heirs--heirs of\nGod and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed\nwe suffer with Him, that we may also be\nglorified together.\nSo then, those who are in the flesh\ncannot please God.\nBut you are not in the flesh but in the\nSpirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells\nin you. Now if anyone does not have the\nSpirit of Christ, he is not His.\nAnd if Christ is in you, the body is\ndead because of sin, but the Spirit is life\nbecause of righteousness.\nFor I consider that the sufferings of\nthis present time are not worthy to be\ncompared with the glory which shall be\nrevealed in us.\nFor the earnest expectation of the\ncreation eagerly waits for the revealing\nof the sons of God.\nFor the creation was subjected to\nfutility, not willingly, but because of Him\nwho subjected it in hope;\nbecause the creation itself also will be\ndelivered from the bondage of\ncorruption into the glorious liberty of the\nchildren of God.\nMoreover whom He predestined, these\nHe also called; whom He called, these\nHe also justified; and whom He justified,\nthese He also glorified.\nFor we know that the whole creation\ngroans and labors with birth pangs\ntogether until now.\nWhat then shall we say to these\nthings? If God is for us, who can be\nagainst us?\nNot only that, but we also who have\nthe firstfruits of the Spirit, even we\nourselves groan within ourselves,\neagerly waiting for the adoption, the\nredemption of our body.\nHe who did not spare His own Son,\nbut delivered Him up for us all, how shall\nHe not with Him also freely give us all\nthings?\nFor we were saved in this hope, but\nhope that is seen is not hope; for why\ndoes one still hope for what he sees?\nWho shall bring a charge against\nGod's elect? It is God who justifies.\nBut if we hope for what we do not see,\nwe eagerly wait for it with perseverance.\nWho is he who condemns? It is Christ\nwho died, and furthermore is also risen,\nwho is even at the right hand of God,\nwho also makes intercession for us.\nLikewise the Spirit also helps in our\nweaknesses. For we do not know what\nwe should pray for as we ought, but the\nSpirit Himself makes intercession for us\nwith groanings which cannot be uttered.\nWho shall separate us from the love of\nChrist? Shall tribulation, or distress, or\npersecution, or famine, or nakedness, or\nperil, or sword?\nNow He who searches the hearts\nknows what the mind of the Spirit is,\nbecause He makes intercession for the\nsaints according to the will of God.\nAnd we know that all things work\ntogether for good to those who love God,\nto those who are the called according to\nHis purpose.\nFor whom He foreknew, He also\npredestined to be conformed to the\nimage of His Son, that He might be the\nfirstborn among many brethren.\nAs it is written: \"For Your sake we are\nkilled all day long; We are accounted as\nsheep for the slaughter.\"\nYet in all these things we are more\nthan conquerors through Him who loved\nus.\nFor I am persuaded that neither death\nnor life, nor angels nor principalities nor\npowers, nor things present nor things to\ncome,\nnor height nor depth, nor any other\ncreated thing, shall be able to separate\nus from the love of God which is in\nChrist Jesus our Lord.\n9I tell the truth in Christ, I am not lying,\nmy conscience also bearing me witness\nin the Holy Spirit,\nthat I have great sorrow and continual\ngrief in my heart.\nFor I could wish that I myself were\naccursed from Christ for my brethren,\nmy countrymen according to the flesh,\nwho are Israelites, to whom pertain the\nadoption, the glory, the covenants, the\ngiving of the law, the service of God,\nand the promises;\nof whom are the fathers and from\nwhom, according to the flesh, Christ\ncame, who is over all, the eternally\nblessed God. Amen.\nBut it is not that the word of God has\ntaken no effect. For they are not all\nIsrael who are of Israel,\nnor are they all children because they\nare the seed of Abraham; but, \"In Isaac\nyour seed shall be called.\"\nThat is, those who are the children of\nthe flesh, these are not the children of\nGod; but the children of the promise are\ncounted as the seed.\nFor this is the word of promise: \"At this\ntime I will come and Sarah shall have a\nson.\"\nAnd not only this, but when Rebecca\nalso had conceived by one man, even\nby our father Isaac\n(for the children not yet being born, nor\nhaving done any good or evil, that the\npurpose of God according to election\nmight stand, not of works but of Him\nwho calls),\nit was said to her, \"The older shall\nserve the younger.\"\nAs it is written, \"Jacob I have loved,\nbut Esau I have hated.\"\nWhat shall we say then? Is there\nunrighteousness with God? Certainly\nnot!\nFor He says to Moses, \"I will have\nmercy on whomever I will have mercy,\nand I will have compassion on\nwhomever I will have compassion.\"\nSo then it is not of him who wills, nor\nof him who runs, but of God who shows\nmercy.\nFor the Scripture says to the Pharaoh,\n\"For this very purpose I have raised you\nup, that I may show My power in you,\nand that My name may be declared in\nall the earth.\"\nTherefore He has mercy on whom He\nwills, and whom He wills He hardens.\nYou will say to me then, \"Why does He\nstill find fault? For who has resisted His\nwill?\"\nBut indeed, O man, who are you to\nreply against God? Will the thing formed\nsay to him who formed it, \"Why have\nyou made me like this?\"\nAnd as Isaiah said before: \"Unless the\nLORD of Sabaoth had left us a seed,\nWe would have become like Sodom,\nAnd we would have been made like\nGomorrah.\"\nDoes not the potter have power over\nthe clay, from the same lump to make\none vessel for honor and another for\ndishonor?\nWhat shall we say then? That Gentiles,\nwho did not pursue righteousness, have\nattained to righteousness, even the\nrighteousness of faith;\nWhat if God, wanting to show His\nwrath and to make His power known,\nendured with much longsuffering the\nvessels\nof\nwrath\nprepared\nfor\ndestruction,\nbut Israel, pursuing the law of\nrighteousness, has not attained to the\nlaw of righteousness.\nand that He might make known the\nriches of His glory on the vessels of\nmercy, which He had prepared\nbeforehand for glory,\nWhy? Because they did not seek it by\nfaith, but as it were, by the works of the\nlaw. For they stumbled at that stumbling\nstone.\neven us whom He called, not of the\nJews only, but also of the Gentiles?\nAs it is written: \"Behold, I lay in Zion a\nstumbling stone and rock of offense,\nAnd whoever believes on Him will not be\nput to shame.\"\nAs He says also in Hosea: \"I will call\nthem My people, who were not My\npeople, And her beloved, who was not\nbeloved.\"\n\"And it shall come to pass in the place\nwhere it was said to them, \"You are not\nMy people,' There they shall be called\nsons of the living God.\"\nIsaiah also cries out concerning Israel:\n\"Though the number of the children of\nIsrael be as the sand of the sea, The\nremnant will be saved.\nFor He will finish the work and cut it\nshort in righteousness, Because the\nLORD will make a short work upon the\nearth.\"\n10Brethren, my heart's desire and\nprayer to God for Israel is that they may\nbe saved.\nFor I bear them witness that they have\na zeal for God, but not according to\nknowledge.\nFor they being ignorant of God's\nrighteousness, and seeking to establish\ntheir own righteousness, have not\nsubmitted to the righteousness of God.\nFor Christ is the end of the law for\nrighteousness to everyone who believes.\nFor\nMoses\nwrites\nabout\nthe\nrighteousness which is of the law, \"The\nman who does those things shall live by\nthem.\"\nAnd how shall they preach unless they\nare sent? As it is written: \"How beautiful\nare the feet of those who preach the\ngospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings\nof good things!\"\nBut the righteousness of faith speaks in\nthis way, \"Do not say in your heart,\n\"Who will ascend into heaven?\"' (that is,\nto bring Christ down from above)\nBut they have not all obeyed the\ngospel. For Isaiah says, \"LORD, who\nhas believed our report?\"\nor, \"\"Who will descend into the abyss?\"'\n(that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).\nSo then faith comes by hearing, and\nhearing by the word of God.\nBut what does it say? \"The word is near\nyou, in your mouth and in your heart\"\n(that is, the word of faith which we\npreach):\nBut I say, have they not heard? Yes\nindeed: \"Their sound has gone out to all\nthe earth, And their words to the ends of\nthe world.\"\nthat if you confess with your mouth the\nLord Jesus and believe in your heart\nthat God has raised Him from the dead,\nyou will be saved.\nBut I say, did Israel not know? First\nMoses says: \"I will provoke you to\njealousy by those who are not a nation, I\nwill move you to anger by a foolish\nnation.\"\nFor with the heart one believes unto\nrighteousness, and with the mouth\nconfession is made unto salvation.\nFor the Scripture says, \"Whoever\nbelieves on Him will not be put to\nshame.\"\nFor there is no distinction between\nJew and Greek, for the same Lord over\nall is rich to all who call upon Him.\nFor \"whoever calls on the name of the\nLORD shall be saved.\"\nHow then shall they call on Him in\nwhom they have not believed? And how\nshall they believe in Him of whom they\nhave not heard? And how shall they\nhear without a preacher?\nBut Isaiah is very bold and says: \"I\nwas found by those who did not seek\nMe; I was made manifest to those who\ndid not ask for Me.\"\nBut to Israel he says: \"All day long I\nhave stretched out My hands To a\ndisobedient and contrary people.\"\n11I say then, has God cast away His\npeople? Certainly not! For I also am an\nIsraelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the\ntribe of Benjamin.\nGod has not cast away His people\nwhom He foreknew. Or do you not know\nwhat the Scripture says of Elijah, how\nhe pleads with God against Israel,\nsaying,\nNow if their fall is riches for the world,\nand their failure riches for the Gentiles,\nhow much more their fullness!\n\"LORD, they have killed Your prophets\nand torn down Your altars, and I alone\nam left, and they seek my life\"?\nFor I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch\nas I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I\nmagnify my ministry,\nBut what does the divine response say\nto him? \"I have reserved for Myself\nseven thousand men who have not\nbowed the knee to Baal.\"\nif by any means I may provoke to\njealousy those who are my flesh and\nsave some of them.\nEven so then, at this present time there\nis a remnant according to the election of\ngrace.\nFor if their being cast away is the\nreconciling of the world, what will their\nacceptance be but life from the dead?\nAnd if by grace, then it is no longer of\nworks; otherwise grace is no longer\ngrace. But if it is of works, it is no longer\ngrace; otherwise work is no longer work.\nFor if the firstfruit is holy, the lump is\nalso holy; and if the root is holy, so are\nthe branches.\nWhat then? Israel has not obtained\nwhat it seeks; but the elect have\nobtained it, and the rest were blinded.\nAnd if some of the branches were\nbroken off, and you, being a wild olive\ntree, were grafted in among them, and\nwith them became a partaker of the root\nand fatness of the olive tree,\nJust as it is written: \"God has given\nthem a spirit of stupor, Eyes that they\nshould not see And ears that they\nshould not hear, To this very day.\"\ndo not boast against the branches. But\nif you do boast, remember that you do\nnot support the root, but the root\nsupports you.\nAnd David says: \"Let their table\nbecome a snare and a trap, A stumbling\nblock and a recompense to them.\nYou will say then, \"Branches were\nbroken off that I might be grafted in.\"\nLet their eyes be darkened, so that\nthey do not see, And bow down their\nback always.\"\nWell said. Because of unbelief they\nwere broken off, and you stand by faith.\nDo not be haughty, but fear.\nI say then, have they stumbled that\nthey should fall? Certainly not! But\nthrough their fall, to provoke them to\njealousy, salvation has come to the\nGentiles.\nFor if God did not spare the natural\nbranches, He may not spare you either.\nTherefore consider the goodness and\nseverity of God: on those who fell,\nseverity; but toward you, goodness, if\nyou continue in His goodness.\nOtherwise you also will be cut off.\neven so these also have now been\ndisobedient, that through the mercy\nshown you they also may obtain mercy.\nAnd they also, if they do not continue\nin unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is\nable to graft them in again.\nFor God has committed them all to\ndisobedience, that He might have mercy\non all.\nFor if you were cut out of the olive tree\nwhich is wild by nature, and were\ngrafted contrary to nature into a\ncultivated olive tree, how much more will\nthese, who are natural branches, be\ngrafted into their own olive tree?\nFor I do not desire, brethren, that you\nshould be ignorant of this mystery, lest\nyou should be wise in your own opinion,\nthat blindness in part has happened to\nIsrael until the fullness of the Gentiles\nhas come in.\nAnd so all Israel will be saved, as it is\nwritten: \"The Deliverer will come out of\nZion, And He will turn away ungodliness\nfrom Jacob;\nFor this is My covenant with them,\nWhen I take away their sins.\"\nConcerning the gospel they are\nenemies for your sake, but concerning\nthe election they are beloved for the\nsake of the fathers.\nFor the gifts and the calling of God are\nirrevocable.\nFor as you were once disobedient to\nGod, yet have now obtained mercy\nthrough their disobedience,\nOh, the depth of the riches both of the\nwisdom and knowledge of God! How\nunsearchable are His judgments and\nHis ways past finding out!\n\"For who has known the mind of the\nLORD? Or who has become His\ncounselor?\"\n\"Or who has first given to Him And it\nshall be repaid to him?\"\nFor of Him and through Him and to\nHim are all things, to whom be glory\nforever. Amen.\n12I beseech you therefore, brethren,\nby the mercies of God, that you present\nyour bodies a living sacrifice, holy,\nacceptable to God, which is your\nreasonable service.\nAnd do not be conformed to this world,\nbut be transformed by the renewing of\nyour mind, that you may prove what is\nthat good and acceptable and perfect\nwill of God.\nFor I say, through the grace given to\nme, to everyone who is among you, not\nto think of himself more highly than he\nought to think, but to think soberly, as\nGod has dealt to each one a measure of\nfaith.\nFor as we have many members in one\nbody, but all the members do not have\nthe same function,\nBe of the same mind toward one\nanother. Do not set your mind on high\nthings, but associate with the humble.\nDo not be wise in your own opinion.\nso we, being many, are one body in\nChrist, and individually members of one\nanother.\nRepay no one evil for evil. Have\nregard for good things in the sight of all\nmen.\nHaving then gifts differing according to\nthe grace that is given to us, let us use\nthem: if prophecy, let us prophesy in\nproportion to our faith;\nIf it is possible, as much as depends\non you, live peaceably with all men.\nor ministry, let us use it in our\nministering; he who teaches, in\nteaching;\nBeloved, do not avenge yourselves,\nbut rather give place to wrath; for it is\nwritten, \"Vengeance is Mine, I will\nrepay,\" says the Lord.\nhe who exhorts, in exhortation; he who\ngives, with liberality; he who leads, with\ndiligence; he who shows mercy, with\ncheerfulness.\nTherefore \"If your enemy is hungry,\nfeed him; If he is thirsty, give him a\ndrink; For in so doing you will heap\ncoals of fire on his head.\"\nLet love be without hypocrisy. Abhor\nwhat is evil. Cling to what is good.\nDo not be overcome by evil, but\novercome evil with good.\n13Let every soul be subject to the\nBe kindly affectionate to one another\nwith brotherly love, in honor giving\npreference to one another;\nnot lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit,\nserving the Lord;\ngoverning authorities. For there is no\nauthority except from God, and the\nauthorities that exist are appointed by\nGod.\nrejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation,\ncontinuing steadfastly in prayer;\ndistributing to the needs of the saints,\ngiven to hospitality.\nTherefore whoever resists the authority\nresists the ordinance of God, and those\nwho resist will bring judgment on\nthemselves.\nBless those who persecute you; bless\nand do not curse.\nRejoice with those who rejoice, and\nweep with those who weep.\nFor rulers are not a terror to good\nworks, but to evil. Do you want to be\nunafraid of the authority? Do what is\ngood, and you will have praise from the\nsame.\nFor he is God's minister to you for good.\nBut if you do evil, be afraid; for he does\nnot bear the sword in vain; for he is\nGod's minister, an avenger to execute\nwrath on him who practices evil.\nTherefore you must be subject, not only\nbecause of wrath but also for\nconscience' sake.\nFor because of this you also pay taxes,\nfor they are God's ministers attending\ncontinually to this very thing.\nRender therefore to all their due: taxes\nto whom taxes are due, customs to\nwhom customs, fear to whom fear,\nhonor to whom honor.\nOwe no one anything except to love\none another, for he who loves another\nhas fulfilled the law.\nFor the commandments, \"You shall not\ncommit adultery,\" \"You shall not\nmurder,\" \"You shall not steal,\" \"You shall\nnot bear false witness,\" \"You shall not\ncovet,\" and if there is any other\ncommandment, are all summed up in\nthis saying, namely, \"You shall love your\nneighbor as yourself.\"\nLove does no harm to a neighbor;\ntherefore love is the fulfillment of the law.\nAnd do this, knowing the time, that\nnow it is high time to awake out of sleep;\nfor now our salvation is nearer than\nwhen we first believed.\nThe night is far spent, the day is at\nhand. Therefore let us cast off the works\nof darkness, and let us put on the armor\nof light.\nLet us walk properly, as in the day, not\nin revelry and drunkenness, not in\nlewdness and lust, not in strife and envy.\nBut put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and\nmake no provision for the flesh, to fulfill\nits lusts.\n14Receive one who is weak in the\nfaith, but not to disputes over doubtful\nthings.\nFor one believes he may eat all things,\nbut he who is weak eats only vegetables.\nLet not him who eats despise him who\ndoes not eat, and let not him who does\nnot eat judge him who eats; for God has\nreceived him.\nWho are you to judge another's\nservant? To his own master he stands\nor falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand,\nfor God is able to make him stand.\nOne person esteems one day above\nanother; another esteems every day\nalike. Let each be fully convinced in his\nown mind.\nHe who observes the day, observes it\nto the Lord; and he who does not\nobserve the day, to the Lord he does not\nobserve it. He who eats, eats to the Lord,\nfor he gives God thanks; and he who\ndoes not eat, to the Lord he does not\neat, and gives God thanks.\nFor none of us lives to himself, and no\none dies to himself.\nfor the kingdom of God is not eating\nand drinking, but righteousness and\npeace and joy in the Holy Spirit.\nFor if we live, we live to the Lord; and if\nwe die, we die to the Lord. Therefore,\nwhether we live or die, we are the Lord's.\nFor he who serves Christ in these\nthings is acceptable to God and\napproved by men.\nFor to this end Christ died and rose and\nlived again, that He might be Lord of\nboth the dead and the living.\nTherefore let us pursue the things\nwhich make for peace and the things by\nwhich one may edify another.\nBut why do you judge your brother? Or\nwhy do you show contempt for your\nbrother? For we shall all stand before\nthe judgment seat of Christ.\nDo not destroy the work of God for the\nsake of food. All things indeed are pure,\nbut it is evil for the man who eats with\noffense.\nFor it is written: \"As I live, says the\nLORD, Every knee shall bow to Me, And\nevery tongue shall confess to God.\"\nSo then each of us shall give account\nof himself to God.\nTherefore let us not judge one another\nanymore, but rather resolve this, not to\nput a stumbling block or a cause to fall\nin our brother's way.\nI know and am convinced by the Lord\nJesus that there is nothing unclean of\nitself; but to him who considers anything\nto be unclean, to him it is unclean.\nYet if your brother is grieved because\nof your food, you are no longer walking\nin love. Do not destroy with your food\nthe one for whom Christ died.\nTherefore do not let your good be\nspoken of as evil;\nIt is good neither to eat meat nor drink\nwine nor do anything by which your\nbrother stumbles or is offended or is\nmade weak.\nDo you have faith? Have it to yourself\nbefore God. Happy is he who does not\ncondemn himself in what he approves.\nBut he who doubts is condemned if he\neats, because he does not eat from\nfaith; for whatever is not from faith is sin.\n15We then who are strong ought to\nbear with the scruples of the weak, and\nnot to please ourselves.\nLet each of us please his neighbor for\nhis good, leading to edification.\nFor even Christ did not please Himself;\nbut as it is written, \"The reproaches of\nthose who reproached You fell on Me.\"\nFor whatever things were written before\nwere written for our learning, that we\nthrough the patience and comfort of the\nScriptures might have hope.\nNow I myself am confident concerning\nyou, my brethren, that you also are full\nof goodness, filled with all knowledge,\nable also to admonish one another.\nNow may the God of patience and\ncomfort grant you to be like-minded\ntoward one another, according to Christ\nJesus,\nNevertheless, brethren, I have written\nmore boldly to you on some points, as\nreminding you, because of the grace\ngiven to me by God,\nthat you may with one mind and one\nmouth glorify the God and Father of our\nLord Jesus Christ.\nTherefore receive one another, just as\nChrist also received us, to the glory of\nGod.\nNow I say that Jesus Christ has\nbecome a servant to the circumcision for\nthe truth of God, to confirm the promises\nmade to the fathers,\nand that the Gentiles might glorify God\nfor His mercy, as it is written: \"For this\nreason I will confess to You among the\nGentiles, And sing to Your name.\"\nAnd again he says: \"Rejoice, O\nGentiles, with His people!\"\nAnd again: \"Praise the LORD, all you\nGentiles! Laud Him, all you peoples!\"\nthat I might be a minister of Jesus\nChrist to the Gentiles, ministering the\ngospel of God, that the offering of the\nGentiles might be acceptable, sanctified\nby the Holy Spirit.\nTherefore I have reason to glory in\nChrist Jesus in the things which pertain\nto God.\nFor I will not dare to speak of any of\nthose things which Christ has not\naccomplished through me, in word and\ndeed, to make the Gentiles obedient-19\nin mighty signs and wonders, by the\npower of the Spirit of God, so that from\nJerusalem and round about to Illyricum I\nhave fully preached the gospel of Christ.\nAnd so I have made it my aim to\npreach the gospel, not where Christ was\nnamed, lest I should build on another\nman's foundation,\nAnd again, Isaiah says: \"There shall\nbe a root of Jesse; And He who shall\nrise to reign over the Gentiles, In Him\nthe Gentiles shall hope.\"\nbut as it is written: \"To whom He was\nnot announced, they shall see; And\nthose who have not heard shall\nunderstand.\"\nNow may the God of hope fill you with\nall joy and peace in believing, that you\nmay abound in hope by the power of the\nHoly Spirit.\nFor this reason I also have been much\nhindered from coming to you.\nBut now no longer having a place in\nthese parts, and having a great desire\nthese many years to come to you,\nthat I may come to you with joy by the\nwill of God, and may be refreshed\ntogether with you.\nwhenever I journey to Spain, I shall\ncome to you. For I hope to see you on\nmy journey, and to be helped on my way\nthere by you, if first I may enjoy your\ncompany for a while.\nBut now I am going to Jerusalem to\nminister to the saints.\nFor it pleased those from Macedonia\nand Achaia to make a certain\ncontribution for the poor among the\nsaints who are in Jerusalem.\nIt pleased them indeed, and they are\ntheir debtors. For if the Gentiles have\nbeen partakers of their spiritual things,\ntheir duty is also to minister to them in\nmaterial things.\nTherefore, when I have performed this\nand have sealed to them this fruit, I shall\ngo by way of you to Spain.\nBut I know that when I come to you, I\nshall come in the fullness of the blessing\nof the gospel of Christ.\nNow I beg you, brethren, through the\nLord Jesus Christ, and through the love\nof the Spirit, that you strive together with\nme in prayers to God for me,\nthat I may be delivered from those in\nJudea who do not believe, and that my\nservice\nfor\nJerusalem\nmay\nbe\nacceptable to the saints,\nNow the God of peace be with you all.\nAmen.\n16I commend to you Phoebe our\nsister, who is a servant of the church in\nCenchrea,\nthat you may receive her in the Lord in\na manner worthy of the saints, and\nassist her in whatever business she has\nneed of you; for indeed she has been a\nhelper of many and of myself also.\nGreet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow\nworkers in Christ Jesus,\nwho risked their own necks for my life,\nto whom not only I give thanks, but also\nall the churches of the Gentiles.\nLikewise greet the church that is in their\nhouse. Greet my beloved Epaenetus,\nwho is the firstfruits of Achaia to Christ.\nGreet Mary, who labored much for us.\nGreet Andronicus and Junia, my\ncountrymen and my fellow prisoners,\nwho are of note among the apostles,\nwho also were in Christ before me.\nGreet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.\nGreet Urbanus, our fellow worker in\nChrist, and Stachys, my beloved.\nGreet Apelles, approved in Christ.\nGreet those who are of the household of\nAristobulus.\nFor your obedience has become\nknown to all. Therefore I am glad on\nyour behalf; but I want you to be wise in\nwhat is good, and simple concerning evil.\nGreet Herodion, my countryman.\nGreet those who are of the household of\nNarcissus who are in the Lord.\nAnd the God of peace will crush Satan\nunder your feet shortly. The grace of our\nLord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.\nGreet Tryphena and Tryphosa, who\nhave labored in the Lord. Greet the\nbeloved Persis, who labored much in\nthe Lord.\nTimothy, my fellow worker, and Lucius,\nJason, and Sosipater, my countrymen,\ngreet you.\nGreet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and\nhis mother and mine.\nI, Tertius, who wrote this epistle, greet\nyou in the Lord.\nGreet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas,\nPatrobas, Hermes, and the brethren\nwho are with them.\nGaius, my host and the host of the\nwhole church, greets you. Erastus, the\ntreasurer of the city, greets you, and\nQuartus, a brother.\nGreet Philologus and Julia, Nereus\nand his sister, and Olympas, and all the\nsaints who are with them.\nThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be\nwith you all. Amen.\nGreet one another with a holy kiss.\nThe churches of Christ greet you.\nNow I urge you, brethren, note those\nwho cause divisions and offenses,\ncontrary to the doctrine which you\nlearned, and avoid them.\nFor those who are such do not serve\nour Lord Jesus Christ, but their own\nbelly, and by smooth words and\nflattering speech deceive the hearts of\nthe simple.\nNow to Him who is able to establish\nyou according to my gospel and the\npreaching of Jesus Christ, according to\nthe revelation of the mystery kept secret\nsince the world began\nbut now made manifest, and by the\nprophetic Scriptures made known to all\nnations, according to the commandment\nof the everlasting God, for obedience to\nthe faith-27\nto God, alone wise, be glory through\nJesus Christ forever. Amen.\n1st Corinthians\n1Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus\nChrist through the will of God, and\nSosthenes our brother,\nTo the church of God which is at\nCorinth, to those who are sanctified in\nChrist Jesus, called to be saints, with all\nwho in every place call on the name of\nJesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and\nours:\nGrace to you and peace from God our\nFather and the Lord Jesus Christ.\nI thank my God always concerning you\nfor the grace of God which was given to\nyou by Christ Jesus,\nthat you were enriched in everything by\nHim in all utterance and all knowledge,\neven as the testimony of Christ was\nconfirmed in you,\nso that you come short in no gift,\neagerly waiting for the revelation of our\nLord Jesus Christ,\nwho will also confirm you to the end,\nthat you may be blameless in the day of\nour Lord Jesus Christ.\nGod is faithful, by whom you were\ncalled into the fellowship of His Son,\nJesus Christ our Lord.\nNow I plead with you, brethren, by the\nname of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you\nall speak the same thing, and that there\nbe no divisions among you, but that you\nbe perfectly joined together in the same\nmind and in the same judgment.\nFor it has been declared to me\nconcerning you, my brethren, by those\nof Chloe's household, that there are\ncontentions among you.\nNow I say this, that each of you says,\n\"I am of Paul,\" or \"I am of Apollos,\" or \"I\nam of Cephas,\" or \"I am of Christ.\"\nIs Christ divided? Was Paul crucified\nfor you? Or were you baptized in the\nname of Paul?\nI thank God that I baptized none of you\nexcept Crispus and Gaius,\nlest anyone should say that I had\nbaptized in my own name.\nYes, I also baptized the household of\nStephanas. Besides, I do not know\nwhether I baptized any other.\nFor Christ did not send me to baptize,\nbut to preach the gospel, not with\nwisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ\nshould be made of no effect.\nFor the message of the cross is\nfoolishness to those who are perishing,\nbut to us who are being saved it is the\npower of God.\nFor it is written: \"I will destroy the\nwisdom of the wise, And bring to nothing\nthe understanding of the prudent.\"\nchosen, and the things which are not, to\nbring to nothing the things that are,\nWhere is the wise? Where is the\nscribe? Where is the disputer of this\nage? Has not God made foolish the\nwisdom of this world?\nFor since, in the wisdom of God, the\nworld through wisdom did not know God,\nit pleased God through the foolishness\nof the message preached to save those\nwho believe.\nthat no flesh should glory in His\npresence.\nBut of Him you are in Christ Jesus,\nwho became for us wisdom from God-and righteousness and sanctification\nand redemption-31\nthat, as it is written, \"He who glories,\nlet him glory in the LORD.\"\n2And I, brethren, when I came to you,\ndid not come with excellence of speech\nor of wisdom declaring to you the\ntestimony of God.\nFor Jews request a sign, and Greeks\nseek after wisdom;\nbut we preach Christ crucified, to the\nJews a stumbling block and to the\nGreeks foolishness,\nbut to those who are called, both Jews\nand Greeks, Christ the power of God\nand the wisdom of God.\nBecause the foolishness of God is\nwiser than men, and the weakness of\nGod is stronger than men.\nFor you see your calling, brethren, that\nnot many wise according to the flesh,\nnot many mighty, not many noble, are\ncalled.\nBut God has chosen the foolish things\nof the world to put to shame the wise,\nand God has chosen the weak things of\nthe world to put to shame the things\nwhich are mighty;\nand the base things of the world and\nthe things which are despised God has\nFor I determined not to know anything\namong you except Jesus Christ and Him\ncrucified.\nI was with you in weakness, in fear, and\nin much trembling.\nAnd my speech and my preaching were\nnot with persuasive words of human\nwisdom, but in demonstration of the\nSpirit and of power,\nthat your faith should not be in the\nwisdom of men but in the power of God.\nHowever, we speak wisdom among\nthose who are mature, yet not the\nwisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of\nthis age, who are coming to nothing.\nBut we speak the wisdom of God in a\nmystery, the hidden wisdom which God\nordained before the ages for our glory,\nFor \"who has known the mind of the\nLORD that he may instruct Him?\" But\nwe have the mind of Christ.\n3And I, brethren, could not speak to\nwhich none of the rulers of this age\nknew; for had they known, they would\nnot have crucified the Lord of glory.\nBut as it is written: \"Eye has not seen,\nnor ear heard, Nor have entered into the\nheart of man The things which God has\nprepared for those who love Him.\"\nBut God has revealed them to us\nthrough His Spirit. For the Spirit\nsearches all things, yes, the deep things\nof God.\nFor what man knows the things of a\nman except the spirit of the man which\nis in him? Even so no one knows the\nthings of God except the Spirit of God.\nNow we have received, not the spirit of\nthe world, but the Spirit who is from God,\nthat we might know the things that have\nbeen freely given to us by God.\nThese things we also speak, not in\nwords which man's wisdom teaches but\nwhich the Holy Spirit teaches,\ncomparing spiritual things with spiritual.\nBut the natural man does not receive\nthe things of the Spirit of God, for they\nare foolishness to him; nor can he know\nthem, because they are spiritually\ndiscerned.\nBut he who is spiritual judges all things,\nyet he himself is rightly judged by no\none.\nyou as to spiritual people but as to\ncarnal, as to babes in Christ.\nI fed you with milk and not with solid\nfood; for until now you were not able to\nreceive it, and even now you are still not\nable;\nfor you are still carnal. For where there\nare envy, strife, and divisions among\nyou, are you not carnal and behaving\nlike mere men?\nFor when one says, \"I am of Paul,\" and\nanother, \"I am of Apollos,\" are you not\ncarnal?\nWho then is Paul, and who is Apollos,\nbut ministers through whom you\nbelieved, as the Lord gave to each one?\nI planted, Apollos watered, but God\ngave the increase.\nSo then neither he who plants is\nanything, nor he who waters, but God\nwho gives the increase.\nNow he who plants and he who waters\nare one, and each one will receive his\nown reward according to his own labor.\nFor we are God's fellow workers; you\nare God's field, you are God's building.\nAccording to the grace of God which\nwas given to me, as a wise master\nbuilder I have laid the foundation, and\nanother builds on it. But let each one\ntake heed how he builds on it.\nFor no other foundation can anyone\nlay than that which is laid, which is\nJesus Christ.\nNow if anyone builds on this\nfoundation with gold, silver, precious\nstones, wood, hay, straw,\neach one's work will become clear; for\nthe Day will declare it, because it will be\nrevealed by fire; and the fire will test\neach one's work, of what sort it is.\nIf anyone's work which he has built on\nit endures, he will receive a reward.\nIf anyone's work is burned, he will\nsuffer loss; but he himself will be saved,\nyet so as through fire.\nDo you not know that you are the\ntemple of God and that the Spirit of God\ndwells in you?\nIf anyone defiles the temple of God,\nGod will destroy him. For the temple of\nGod is holy, which temple you are.\nLet no one deceive himself. If anyone\namong you seems to be wise in this age,\nlet him become a fool that he may\nbecome wise.\nFor the wisdom of this world is\nfoolishness with God. For it is written,\n\"He catches the wise in their own\ncraftiness\";\nand again, \"The LORD knows the\nthoughts of the wise, that they are\nfutile.\"\nTherefore let no one boast in men. For\nall things are yours:\nwhether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or\nthe world or life or death, or things\npresent or things to come--all are yours.\nAnd you are Christ's, and Christ is\nGod's.\n4Let a man so consider us, as\nservants of Christ and stewards of the\nmysteries of God.\nMoreover it is required in stewards that\none be found faithful.\nBut with me it is a very small thing that I\nshould be judged by you or by a human\ncourt. In fact, I do not even judge myself.\nFor I know of nothing against myself,\nyet I am not justified by this; but He who\njudges me is the Lord.\nTherefore judge nothing before the time,\nuntil the Lord comes, who will both bring\nto light the hidden things of darkness\nand reveal the counsels of the hearts.\nThen each one's praise will come from\nGod.\nNow these things, brethren, I have\nfiguratively transferred to myself and\nApollos for your sakes, that you may\nlearn in us not to think beyond what is\nwritten, that none of you may be puffed\nup on behalf of one against the other.\nFor who makes you differ from\nanother? And what do you have that you\ndid not receive? Now if you did indeed\nreceive it, why do you boast as if you\nhad not received it?\nYou are already full! You are already\nrich! You have reigned as kings without\nus--and indeed I could wish you did\nreign, that we also might reign with you!\nFor I think that God has displayed us,\nthe apostles, last, as men condemned to\ndeath; for we have been made a\nspectacle to the world, both to angels\nand to men.\nTherefore I urge you, imitate me.\nFor this reason I have sent Timothy to\nyou, who is my beloved and faithful son\nin the Lord, who will remind you of my\nways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in\nevery church.\nNow some are puffed up, as though I\nwere not coming to you.\nBut I will come to you shortly, if the\nLord wills, and I will know, not the word\nof those who are puffed up, but the\npower.\nWe are fools for Christ's sake, but you\nare wise in Christ! We are weak, but you\nare strong! You are distinguished, but\nwe are dishonored!\nTo the present hour we both hunger\nand thirst, and we are poorly clothed,\nand beaten, and homeless.\nAnd we labor, working with our own\nhands. Being reviled, we bless; being\npersecuted, we endure;\nbeing defamed, we entreat. We have\nbeen made as the filth of the world, the\noffscouring of all things until now.\nI do not write these things to shame\nyou, but as my beloved children I warn\nyou.\nFor though you might have ten\nthousand instructors in Christ, yet you\ndo not have many fathers; for in Christ\nJesus I have begotten you through the\ngospel.\nFor the kingdom of God is not in word\nbut in power.\nWhat do you want? Shall I come to\nyou with a rod, or in love and a spirit of\ngentleness?\n5It is actually reported that there is\nsexual immorality among you, and such\nsexual immorality as is not even named\namong the Gentiles--that a man has his\nfather's wife!\nAnd you are puffed up, and have not\nrather mourned, that he who has done\nthis deed might be taken away from\namong you.\nFor I indeed, as absent in body but\npresent in spirit, have already judged\n(as though I were present) him who has\nso done this deed.\nIn the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,\nwhen you are gathered together, along\nwith my spirit, with the power of our Lord\nJesus Christ,\nBut those who are outside God judges.\nTherefore \"put away from yourselves the\nevil person.\"\ndeliver such a one to Satan for the\ndestruction of the flesh, that his spirit\nmay be saved in the day of the Lord\nJesus.\nYour glorying is not good. Do you not\nknow that a little leaven leavens the\nwhole lump?\nTherefore purge out the old leaven, that\nyou may be a new lump, since you truly\nare unleavened. For indeed Christ, our\nPassover, was sacrificed for us.\nTherefore let us keep the feast, not with\nold leaven, nor with the leaven of malice\nand\nwickedness,\nbut\nwith\nthe\nunleavened bread of sincerity and truth.\nI wrote to you in my epistle not to keep\ncompany with sexually immoral people.\nYet I certainly did not mean with the\nsexually immoral people of this world, or\nwith the covetous, or extortioners, or\nidolaters, since then you would need to\ngo out of the world.\nBut now I have written to you not to\nkeep company with anyone named a\nbrother, who is sexually immoral, or\ncovetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a\ndrunkard, or an extortioner--not even to\neat with such a person.\nFor what have I to do with judging\nthose also who are outside? Do you not\njudge those who are inside?\n6Dare any of you, having a matter\nagainst another, go to law before the\nunrighteous, and not before the saints?\nDo you not know that the saints will\njudge the world? And if the world will be\njudged by you, are you unworthy to\njudge the smallest matters?\nDo you not know that we shall judge\nangels? How much more, things that\npertain to this life?\nIf then you have judgments concerning\nthings pertaining to this life, do you\nappoint those who are least esteemed\nby the church to judge?\nI say this to your shame. Is it so, that\nthere is not a wise man among you, not\neven one, who will be able to judge\nbetween his brethren?\nBut brother goes to law against brother,\nand that before unbelievers!\nNow therefore, it is already an utter\nfailure for you that you go to law against\none another. Why do you not rather\naccept wrong? Why do you not rather let\nyourselves be cheated?\nNo, you yourselves do wrong and cheat,\nand you do these things to your\nbrethren!\nDo you not know that the unrighteous\nwill not inherit the kingdom of God? Do\nnot be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor\nidolaters,\nnor\nadulterers,\nnor\nhomosexuals, nor sodomites,\nwho commits sexual immorality sins\nagainst his own body.\nnor thieves, nor covetous, nor\ndrunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners\nwill inherit the kingdom of God.\nOr do you not know that your body is\nthe temple of the Holy Spirit who is in\nyou, whom you have from God, and you\nare not your own?\nAnd such were some of you. But you\nwere washed, but you were sanctified,\nbut you were justified in the name of the\nLord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.\nAll things are lawful for me, but all\nthings are not helpful. All things are\nlawful for me, but I will not be brought\nunder the power of any.\nFoods for the stomach and the\nstomach for foods, but God will destroy\nboth it and them. Now the body is not for\nsexual immorality but for the Lord, and\nthe Lord for the body.\nAnd God both raised up the Lord and\nwill also raise us up by His power.\nDo you not know that your bodies are\nmembers of Christ? Shall I then take the\nmembers of Christ and make them\nmembers of a harlot? Certainly not!\nOr do you not know that he who is\njoined to a harlot is one body with her?\nFor \"the two,\" He says, \"shall become\none flesh.\"\nBut he who is joined to the Lord is one\nspirit with Him.\nFor you were bought at a price;\ntherefore glorify God in your body and in\nyour spirit, which are God's.\n7Now concerning the things of which\nyou wrote to me: It is good for a man not\nto touch a woman.\nNevertheless, because of sexual\nimmorality, let each man have his own\nwife, and let each woman have her own\nhusband.\nLet the husband render to his wife the\naffection due her, and likewise also the\nwife to her husband.\nThe wife does not have authority over\nher own body, but the husband does.\nAnd likewise the husband does not have\nauthority over his own body, but the wife\ndoes.\nDo not deprive one another except with\nconsent for a time, that you may give\nyourselves to fasting and prayer; and\ncome together again so that Satan does\nnot tempt you because of your lack of\nself-control.\nFlee sexual immorality. Every sin that\na man does is outside the body, but he\nBut I say this as a concession, not as a\ncommandment.\nFor I wish that all men were even as I\nmyself. But each one has his own gift\nfrom God, one in this manner and\nanother in that.\nFor how do you know, O wife, whether\nyou will save your husband? Or how do\nyou know, O husband, whether you will\nsave your wife?\nBut I say to the unmarried and to the\nwidows: It is good for them if they\nremain even as I am;\nBut as God has distributed to each\none, as the Lord has called each one,\nso let him walk. And so I ordain in all the\nchurches.\nbut if they cannot exercise self-control,\nlet them marry. For it is better to marry\nthan to burn with passion.\nNow to the married I command, yet not\nI but the Lord: A wife is not to depart\nfrom her husband.\nBut even if she does depart, let her\nremain unmarried or be reconciled to\nher husband. And a husband is not to\ndivorce his wife.\nBut to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If\nany brother has a wife who does not\nbelieve, and she is willing to live with\nhim, let him not divorce her.\nWas anyone called while circumcised?\nLet him not become uncircumcised.\nWas\nanyone\ncalled\nwhile\nuncircumcised? Let him not be\ncircumcised.\nCircumcision\nis\nnothing\nand\nuncircumcision is nothing, but keeping\nthe commandments of God is what\nmatters.\nLet each one remain in the same\ncalling in which he was called.\nWere you called while a slave? Do not\nbe concerned about it; but if you can be\nmade free, rather use it.\nAnd a woman who has a husband who\ndoes not believe, if he is willing to live\nwith her, let her not divorce him.\nFor the unbelieving husband is\nsanctified by the wife, and the\nunbelieving wife is sanctified by the\nhusband; otherwise your children would\nbe unclean, but now they are holy.\nFor he who is called in the Lord while\na slave is the Lord's freedman. Likewise\nhe who is called while free is Christ's\nslave.\nYou were bought at a price; do not\nbecome slaves of men.\nBut if the unbeliever departs, let him\ndepart; a brother or a sister is not under\nbondage in such cases. But God has\ncalled us to peace.\nBrethren, let each one remain with\nGod in that state in which he was called.\nNow concerning virgins: I have no\ncommandment from the Lord; yet I give\njudgment as one whom the Lord in His\nmercy has made trustworthy.\nI suppose therefore that this is good\nbecause of the present distress--that it\nis good for a man to remain as he is:\nAnd this I say for your own profit, not\nthat I may put a leash on you, but for\nwhat is proper, and that you may serve\nthe Lord without distraction.\nAre you bound to a wife? Do not seek\nto be loosed. Are you loosed from a\nwife? Do not seek a wife.\nBut even if you do marry, you have not\nsinned; and if a virgin marries, she has\nnot sinned. Nevertheless such will have\ntrouble in the flesh, but I would spare\nyou.\nBut this I say, brethren, the time is\nshort, so that from now on even those\nwho have wives should be as though\nthey had none,\nthose who weep as though they did\nnot weep, those who rejoice as though\nthey did not rejoice, those who buy as\nthough they did not possess,\nand those who use this world as not\nmisusing it. For the form of this world is\npassing away.\nBut I want you to be without care. He\nwho is unmarried cares for the things of\nthe Lord--how he may please the Lord.\nBut he who is married cares about the\nthings of the world--how he may please\nhis wife.\nThere is a difference between a wife\nand a virgin. The unmarried woman\ncares about the things of the Lord, that\nshe may be holy both in body and in\nspirit. But she who is married cares\nabout the things of the world--how she\nmay please her husband.\nBut if any man thinks he is behaving\nimproperly toward his virgin, if she is\npast the flower of youth, and thus it must\nbe, let him do what he wishes. He does\nnot sin; let them marry.\nNevertheless he who stands steadfast\nin his heart, having no necessity, but\nhas power over his own will, and has so\ndetermined in his heart that he will keep\nhis virgin, does well.\nSo then he who gives her in marriage\ndoes well, but he who does not give her\nin marriage does better.\nA wife is bound by law as long as her\nhusband lives; but if her husband dies,\nshe is at liberty to be married to whom\nshe wishes, only in the Lord.\nBut she is happier if she remains as\nshe is, according to my judgment--and I\nthink I also have the Spirit of God.\n8Now concerning things offered to\nidols: We know that we all have\nknowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but\nlove edifies.\nAnd if anyone thinks that he knows\nanything, he knows nothing yet as he\nought to know.\nBut if anyone loves God, this one is\nknown by Him.\nTherefore concerning the eating of\nthings offered to idols, we know that an\nidol is nothing in the world, and that\nthere is no other God but one.\nFor even if there are so-called gods,\nwhether in heaven or on earth (as there\nare many gods and many lords),\nyet for us there is one God, the Father,\nof whom are all things, and we for Him;\nand one Lord Jesus Christ, through\nwhom are all things, and through whom\nwe live.\nHowever, there is not in everyone that\nknowledge;\nfor\nsome,\nwith\nconsciousness of the idol, until now eat\nit as a thing offered to an idol; and their\nconscience, being weak, is defiled.\nBut food does not commend us to God;\nfor neither if we eat are we the better,\nnor if we do not eat are we the worse.\nBut beware lest somehow this liberty of\nyours become a stumbling block to\nthose who are weak.\nFor if anyone sees you who have\nknowledge eating in an idol's temple, will\nnot the conscience of him who is weak\nbe emboldened to eat those things\noffered to idols?\nTherefore, if food makes my brother\nstumble, I will never again eat meat, lest\nI make my brother stumble.\n9Am I not an apostle? Am I not free?\nHave I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?\nAre you not my work in the Lord?\nIf I am not an apostle to others, yet\ndoubtless I am to you. For you are the\nseal of my apostleship in the Lord.\nMy defense to those who examine me\nis this:\nDo we have no right to eat and drink?\nDo we have no right to take along a\nbelieving wife, as do also the other\napostles, the brothers of the Lord, and\nCephas?\nOr is it only Barnabas and I who have\nno right to refrain from working?\nWho ever goes to war at his own\nexpense? Who plants a vineyard and\ndoes not eat of its fruit? Or who tends a\nflock and does not drink of the milk of\nthe flock?\nDo I say these things as a mere man?\nOr does not the law say the same also?\nAnd because of your knowledge shall\nthe weak brother perish, for whom\nChrist died?\nBut when you thus sin against the\nbrethren, and wound their weak\nconscience, you sin against Christ.\nFor it is written in the law of Moses,\n\"You shall not muzzle an ox while it\ntreads out the grain.\" Is it oxen God is\nconcerned about?\nOr does He say it altogether for our\nsakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is\nwritten, that he who plows should plow\nin hope, and he who threshes in hope\nshould be partaker of his hope.\nmay not abuse my authority in the\ngospel.\nIf we have sown spiritual things for you,\nis it a great thing if we reap your\nmaterial things?\nFor though I am free from all men, I\nhave made myself a servant to all, that I\nmight win the more;\nIf others are partakers of this right over\nyou, are we not even more?\nNevertheless we have not used this\nright, but endure all things lest we hinder\nthe gospel of Christ.\nDo you not know that those who\nminister the holy things eat of the things\nof the temple, and those who serve at\nthe altar partake of the offerings of the\naltar?\nEven so the Lord has commanded that\nthose who preach the gospel should live\nfrom the gospel.\nand to the Jews I became as a Jew,\nthat I might win Jews; to those who are\nunder the law, as under the law, that I\nmight win those who are under the law;\nto those who are without law, as\nwithout law (not being without law\ntoward God, but under law toward\nChrist ), that I might win those who are\nwithout law;\nto the weak I became as weak, that I\nmight win the weak. I have become all\nthings to all men, that I might by all\nmeans save some.\nBut I have used none of these things,\nnor have I written these things that it\nshould be done so to me; for it would be\nbetter for me to die than that anyone\nshould make my boasting void.\nFor if I preach the gospel, I have\nnothing to boast of, for necessity is laid\nupon me; yes, woe is me if I do not\npreach the gospel!\nFor if I do this willingly, I have a\nreward; but if against my will, I have\nbeen entrusted with a stewardship.\nWhat is my reward then? That when I\npreach the gospel, I may present the\ngospel of Christ without charge, that I\nNow this I do for the gospel's sake,\nthat I may be partaker of it with you.\nDo you not know that those who run in\na race all run, but one receives the\nprize? Run in such a way that you may\nobtain it.\nAnd everyone who competes for the\nprize is temperate in all things. Now they\ndo it to obtain a perishable crown, but\nwe for an imperishable crown.\nTherefore I run thus: not with\nuncertainty. Thus I fight: not as one who\nbeats the air.\nBut I discipline my body and bring it\ninto subjection, lest, when I have\npreached to others, I myself should\nbecome disqualified.\n10Moreover, brethren, I do not want\nyou to be unaware that all our fathers\nwere under the cloud, all passed\nthrough the sea,\nall were baptized into Moses in the\ncloud and in the sea,\nall ate the same spiritual food,\nand all drank the same spiritual drink.\nFor they drank of that spiritual Rock that\nfollowed them, and that Rock was Christ.\nBut with most of them God was not well\npleased, for their bodies were scattered\nin the wilderness.\nNow these things became our\nexamples, to the intent that we should\nnot lust after evil things as they also\nlusted.\nAnd do not become idolaters as were\nsome of them. As it is written, \"The\npeople sat down to eat and drink, and\nrose up to play.\"\nNor let us commit sexual immorality, as\nsome of them did, and in one day\ntwenty-three thousand fell;\nnor let us tempt Christ, as some of\nthem also tempted, and were destroyed\nby serpents;\nnor complain, as some of them also\ncomplained, and were destroyed by the\ndestroyer.\nNow all these things happened to\nthem as examples, and they were\nwritten for our admonition, upon whom\nthe ends of the ages have come.\nTherefore let him who thinks he stands\ntake heed lest he fall.\nNo temptation has overtaken you\nexcept such as is common to man; but\nGod is faithful, who will not allow you to\nbe tempted beyond what you are able,\nbut with the temptation will also make\nthe way of escape, that you may be able\nto bear it.\nTherefore, my beloved, flee from\nidolatry.\nI speak as to wise men; judge for\nyourselves what I say.\nThe cup of blessing which we bless, is\nit not the communion of the blood of\nChrist? The bread which we break, is it\nnot the communion of the body of\nChrist?\nFor we, though many, are one bread\nand one body; for we all partake of that\none bread.\nObserve Israel after the flesh: Are not\nthose who eat of the sacrifices partakers\nof the altar?\nWhat am I saying then? That an idol is\nanything, or what is offered to idols is\nanything?\nRather, that the things which the\nGentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to\ndemons and not to God, and I do not\nwant you to have fellowship with\ndemons.\nYou cannot drink the cup of the Lord\nand the cup of demons; you cannot\npartake of the Lord's table and of the\ntable of demons.\nOr do we provoke the Lord to\njealousy? Are we stronger than He?\nAll things are lawful for me, but not all\nthings are helpful; all things are lawful\nfor me, but not all things edify.\nLet no one seek his own, but each one\nthe other's well-being.\nEat whatever is sold in the meat\nmarket, asking no questions for\nconscience' sake;\nfor \"the earth is the LORD's, and all its\nfullness.\"\nIf any of those who do not believe\ninvites you to dinner, and you desire to\ngo, eat whatever is set before you,\nasking no question for conscience' sake.\nBut if anyone says to you, \"This was\noffered to idols,\" do not eat it for the\nsake of the one who told you, and for\nconscience' sake; for \"the earth is the\nLORD's, and all its fullness.\"\n\"Conscience,\" I say, not your own, but\nthat of the other. For why is my liberty\njudged by another man's conscience?\nBut if I partake with thanks, why am I\nevil spoken of for the food over which I\ngive thanks?\nTherefore, whether you eat or drink, or\nwhatever you do, do all to the glory of\nGod.\nGive no offense, either to the Jews or\nto the Greeks or to the church of God,\njust as I also please all men in all\nthings, not seeking my own profit, but\nthe profit of many, that they may be\nsaved.\n11Imitate me, just as I also imitate\nChrist.\nNow I praise you, brethren, that you\nremember me in all things and keep the\ntraditions just as I delivered them to you.\nBut I want you to know that the head of\nevery man is Christ, the head of woman\nis man, and the head of Christ is God.\nEvery man praying or prophesying,\nhaving his head covered, dishonors his\nhead.\nBut every woman who prays or\nprophesies with her head uncovered\ndishonors her head, for that is one and\nthe same as if her head were shaved.\nFor if a woman is not covered, let her\nalso be shorn. But if it is shameful for a\nwoman to be shorn or shaved, let her be\ncovered.\nFor a man indeed ought not to cover\nhis head, since he is the image and\nglory of God; but woman is the glory of\nman.\nFor first of all, when you come\ntogether as a church, I hear that there\nare divisions among you, and in part I\nbelieve it.\nFor man is not from woman, but woman\nfrom man.\nFor there must also be factions among\nyou, that those who are approved may\nbe recognized among you.\nNor was man created for the woman,\nbut woman for the man.\nFor this reason the woman ought to\nhave a symbol of authority on her head,\nbecause of the angels.\nNevertheless,\nneither\nis\nman\nindependent of woman, nor woman\nindependent of man, in the Lord.\nFor as woman came from man, even\nso man also comes through woman; but\nall things are from God.\nTherefore when you come together in\none place, it is not to eat the Lord's\nSupper.\nFor in eating, each one takes his own\nsupper ahead of others; and one is\nhungry and another is drunk.\nWhat! Do you not have houses to eat\nand drink in? Or do you despise the\nchurch of God and shame those who\nhave nothing? What shall I say to you?\nShall I praise you in this? I do not praise\nyou.\nJudge among yourselves. Is it proper\nfor a woman to pray to God with her\nhead uncovered?\nDoes not even nature itself teach you\nthat if a man has long hair, it is a\ndishonor to him?\nBut if a woman has long hair, it is a\nglory to her; for her hair is given to her\nfor a covering.\nBut if anyone seems to be contentious,\nwe have no such custom, nor do the\nchurches of God.\nNow in giving these instructions I do\nnot praise you, since you come together\nnot for the better but for the worse.\nFor I received from the Lord that which\nI also delivered to you: that the Lord\nJesus on the same night in which He\nwas betrayed took bread;\nand when He had given thanks, He\nbroke it and said, \"Take, eat; this is My\nbody which is broken for you; do this in\nremembrance of Me.\"\nIn the same manner He also took the\ncup after supper, saying, \"This cup is\nthe new covenant in My blood. This do,\nas often as you drink it, in remembrance\nof Me.\"\nFor as often as you eat this bread and\ndrink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's\ndeath till He comes.\nTherefore whoever eats this bread or\ndrinks this cup of the Lord in an\nunworthy manner will be guilty of the\nbody and blood of the Lord.\nTherefore I make known to you that no\none speaking by the Spirit of God calls\nJesus accursed, and no one can say\nthat Jesus is Lord except by the Holy\nSpirit.\nBut let a man examine himself, and so\nlet him eat of the bread and drink of the\ncup.\nThere are diversities of gifts, but the\nsame Spirit.\nFor he who eats and drinks in an\nunworthy manner eats and drinks\njudgment to himself, not discerning the\nLord's body.\nFor this reason many are weak and\nsick among you, and many sleep.\nThere are differences of ministries, but\nthe same Lord.\nAnd there are diversities of activities,\nbut it is the same God who works all in\nall.\nFor if we would judge ourselves, we\nwould not be judged.\nBut the manifestation of the Spirit is\ngiven to each one for the profit of all:\nBut when we are judged, we are\nchastened by the Lord, that we may not\nbe condemned with the world.\nfor to one is given the word of wisdom\nthrough the Spirit, to another the word of\nknowledge through the same Spirit,\nTherefore, my brethren, when you\ncome together to eat, wait for one\nanother.\nto another faith by the same Spirit, to\nanother gifts of healings by the same\nSpirit,\nBut if anyone is hungry, let him eat at\nhome, lest you come together for\njudgment. And the rest I will set in order\nwhen I come.\n12Now concerning spiritual gifts,\nbrethren, I do not want you to be\nignorant:\nYou know that you were Gentiles,\ncarried away to these dumb idols,\nhowever you were led.\nto another the working of miracles, to\nanother prophecy, to another discerning\nof spirits, to another different kinds of\ntongues, to another the interpretation of\ntongues.\nBut one and the same Spirit works all\nthese things, distributing to each one\nindividually as He wills.\nFor as the body is one and has many\nmembers, but all the members of that\none body, being many, are one body, so\nalso is Christ.\nFor by one Spirit we were all baptized\ninto one body--whether Jews or Greeks,\nwhether slaves or free--and have all\nbeen made to drink into one Spirit.\nunpresentable\nmodesty,\nparts\nhave\ngreater\nFor in fact the body is not one member\nbut many.\nbut our presentable parts have no\nneed. But God composed the body,\nhaving given greater honor to that part\nwhich lacks it,\nIf the foot should say, \"Because I am\nnot a hand, I am not of the body,\" is it\ntherefore not of the body?\nthat there should be no schism in the\nbody, but that the members should have\nthe same care for one another.\nAnd if the ear should say, \"Because I\nam not an eye, I am not of the body,\" is\nit therefore not of the body?\nAnd if one member suffers, all the\nmembers suffer with it; or if one member\nis honored, all the members rejoice with\nit.\nIf the whole body were an eye, where\nwould be the hearing? If the whole were\nhearing, where would be the smelling?\nNow you are the body of Christ, and\nmembers individually.\nBut now God has set the members,\neach one of them, in the body just as He\npleased.\nAnd if they were all one member,\nwhere would the body be?\nAnd God has appointed these in the\nchurch: first apostles, second prophets,\nthird teachers, after that miracles, then\ngifts of healings, helps, administrations,\nvarieties of tongues.\nBut now indeed there are many\nmembers, yet one body.\nAre all apostles? Are all prophets? Are\nall teachers? Are all workers of\nmiracles?\nAnd the eye cannot say to the hand, \"I\nhave no need of you\"; nor again the\nhead to the feet, \"I have no need of\nyou.\"\nDo all have gifts of healings? Do all\nspeak with tongues? Do all interpret?\nBut earnestly desire the best gifts. And\nyet I show you a more excellent way.\nNo, much rather, those members of\nthe body which seem to be weaker are\nnecessary.\nAnd those members of the body which\nwe think to be less honorable, on these\nwe bestow greater honor; and our\n13Though I speak with the tongues\nof men and of angels, but have not love,\nI have become sounding brass or a\nclanging cymbal.\nAnd though I have the gift of prophecy,\nand understand all mysteries and all\nknowledge, and though I have all faith,\nso that I could remove mountains, but\nhave not love, I am nothing.\nAnd though I bestow all my goods to\nfeed the poor, and though I give my\nbody to be burned, but have not love, it\nprofits me nothing.\nLove suffers long and is kind; love does\nnot envy; love does not parade itself, is\nnot puffed up;\ndoes not behave rudely, does not seek\nits own, is not provoked, thinks no evil;\ndoes not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices\nin the truth;\nbears all things, believes all things,\nhopes all things, endures all things.\nLove never fails. But whether there are\nprophecies, they will fail; whether there\nare tongues, they will cease; whether\nthere is knowledge, it will vanish away.\nFor we know in part and we prophesy\nin part.\nbut then I shall know just as I also am\nknown.\nAnd now abide faith, hope, love, these\nthree; but the greatest of these is love.\n14Pursue love, and desire spiritual\ngifts, but especially that you may\nprophesy.\nFor he who speaks in a tongue does\nnot speak to men but to God, for no one\nunderstands him; however, in the spirit\nhe speaks mysteries.\nBut he who prophesies speaks\nedification and exhortation and comfort\nto men.\nHe who speaks in a tongue edifies\nhimself, but he who prophesies edifies\nthe church.\nI wish you all spoke with tongues, but\neven more that you prophesied; for he\nwho prophesies is greater than he who\nspeaks with tongues, unless indeed he\ninterprets, that the church may receive\nedification.\nBut when that which is perfect has\ncome, then that which is in part will be\ndone away.\nWhen I was a child, I spoke as a child,\nI understood as a child, I thought as a\nchild; but when I became a man, I put\naway childish things.\nFor now we see in a mirror, dimly, but\nthen face to face. Now I know in part,\nBut now, brethren, if I come to you\nspeaking with tongues, what shall I profit\nyou unless I speak to you either by\nrevelation,\nby\nknowledge,\nby\nprophesying, or by teaching?\nEven things without life, whether flute\nor harp, when they make a sound,\nunless they make a distinction in the\nsounds, how will it be known what is\npiped or played?\nFor if the trumpet makes an uncertain\nsound, who will prepare for battle?\nI thank my God I speak with tongues\nmore than you all;\nSo likewise you, unless you utter by the\ntongue words easy to understand, how\nwill it be known what is spoken? For you\nwill be speaking into the air.\nyet in the church I would rather speak\nfive words with my understanding, that I\nmay teach others also, than ten\nthousand words in a tongue.\nThere are, it may be, so many kinds of\nlanguages in the world, and none of\nthem is without significance.\nBrethren, do not be children in\nunderstanding; however, in malice be\nbabes, but in understanding be mature.\nTherefore, if I do not know the\nmeaning of the language, I shall be a\nforeigner to him who speaks, and he\nwho speaks will be a foreigner to me.\nIn the law it is written: \"With men of\nother tongues and other lips I will speak\nto this people; And yet, for all that, they\nwill not hear Me,\" says the Lord.\nEven so you, since you are zealous for\nspiritual gifts, let it be for the edification\nof the church that you seek to excel.\nTherefore tongues are for a sign, not\nto those who believe but to unbelievers;\nbut prophesying is not for unbelievers\nbut for those who believe.\nTherefore let him who speaks in a\ntongue pray that he may interpret.\nFor if I pray in a tongue, my spirit\nprays, but my understanding is unfruitful.\nTherefore if the whole church comes\ntogether in one place, and all speak with\ntongues, and there come in those who\nare uninformed or unbelievers, will they\nnot say that you are out of your mind?\nWhat is the conclusion then? I will pray\nwith the spirit, and I will also pray with\nthe understanding. I will sing with the\nspirit, and I will also sing with the\nunderstanding.\nOtherwise, if you bless with the spirit,\nhow will he who occupies the place of\nthe uninformed say \"Amen\" at your\ngiving of thanks, since he does not\nunderstand what you say?\nFor you indeed give thanks well, but\nthe other is not edified.\nBut if all prophesy, and an unbeliever\nor an uninformed person comes in, he is\nconvinced by all, he is convicted by all.\nAnd thus the secrets of his heart are\nrevealed; and so, falling down on his\nface, he will worship God and report that\nGod is truly among you.\nHow is it then, brethren? Whenever\nyou come together, each of you has a\npsalm, has a teaching, has a tongue,\nhas a revelation, has an interpretation.\nLet all things be done for edification.\nIf anyone speaks in a tongue, let there\nbe two or at the most three, each in turn,\nand let one interpret.\nBut if anyone is ignorant, let him be\nignorant.\nBut if there is no interpreter, let him\nkeep silent in church, and let him speak\nto himself and to God.\nTherefore, brethren, desire earnestly\nto prophesy, and do not forbid to speak\nwith tongues.\nLet all things be done decently and in\norder.\n15Moreover, brethren, I declare to\nLet two or three prophets speak, and\nlet the others judge.\nBut if anything is revealed to another\nwho sits by, let the first keep silent.\nFor you can all prophesy one by one,\nthat all may learn and all may be\nencouraged.\nAnd the spirits of the prophets are\nsubject to the prophets.\nyou the gospel which I preached to you,\nwhich also you received and in which\nyou stand,\nby which also you are saved, if you\nhold fast that word which I preached to\nyou--unless you believed in vain.\nFor God is not the author of confusion\nbut of peace, as in all the churches of\nthe saints.\nFor I delivered to you first of all that\nwhich I also received: that Christ died\nfor our sins according to the Scriptures,\nLet your women keep silent in the\nchurches, for they are not permitted to\nspeak; but they are to be submissive, as\nthe law also says.\nAnd if they want to learn something, let\nthem ask their own husbands at home;\nfor it is shameful for women to speak in\nchurch.\nOr did the word of God come originally\nfrom you? Or was it you only that it\nreached?\nIf anyone thinks himself to be a\nprophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge\nthat the things which I write to you are\nthe commandments of the Lord.\nand that He was buried, and that He\nrose again the third day according to the\nScriptures,\nand that He was seen by Cephas, then\nby the twelve.\nAfter that He was seen by over five\nhundred brethren at once, of whom the\ngreater part remain to the present, but\nsome have fallen asleep.\nAfter that He was seen by James, then\nby all the apostles.\nThen last of all He was seen by me\nalso, as by one born out of due time.\nFor I am the least of the apostles, who\nam not worthy to be called an apostle,\nbecause I persecuted the church of God.\nBut now Christ is risen from the dead,\nand has become the firstfruits of those\nwho have fallen asleep.\nBut by the grace of God I am what I\nam, and His grace toward me was not in\nvain; but I labored more abundantly than\nthey all, yet not I, but the grace of God\nwhich was with me.\nFor since by man came death, by Man\nalso came the resurrection of the dead.\nTherefore, whether it was I or they, so\nwe preach and so you believed.\nNow if Christ is preached that He has\nbeen raised from the dead, how do\nsome among you say that there is no\nresurrection of the dead?\nBut if there is no resurrection of the\ndead, then Christ is not risen.\nFor as in Adam all die, even so in\nChrist all shall be made alive.\nBut each one in his own order: Christ\nthe firstfruits, afterward those who are\nChrist's at His coming.\nThen comes the end, when He\ndelivers the kingdom to God the Father,\nwhen He puts an end to all rule and all\nauthority and power.\nFor He must reign till He has put all\nenemies under His feet.\nAnd if Christ is not risen, then our\npreaching is empty and your faith is also\nempty.\nThe last enemy that will be destroyed\nis death.\nYes, and we are found false witnesses\nof God, because we have testified of\nGod that He raised up Christ, whom He\ndid not raise up--if in fact the dead do\nnot rise.\nFor \"He has put all things under His\nfeet.\" But when He says \"all things are\nput under Him,\" it is evident that He who\nput all things under Him is excepted.\nFor if the dead do not rise, then Christ\nis not risen.\nAnd if Christ is not risen, your faith is\nfutile; you are still in your sins!\nNow when all things are made subject\nto Him, then the Son Himself will also be\nsubject to Him who put all things under\nHim, that God may be all in all.\nThen also those who have fallen\nasleep in Christ have perished.\nOtherwise, what will they do who are\nbaptized for the dead, if the dead do not\nrise at all? Why then are they baptized\nfor the dead?\nIf in this life only we have hope in\nChrist, we are of all men the most\npitiable.\nAnd why do we stand in jeopardy\nevery hour?\nI affirm, by the boasting in you which I\nhave in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.\nSo also is the resurrection of the dead.\nThe body is sown in corruption, it is\nraised in incorruption.\nIf, in the manner of men, I have fought\nwith beasts at Ephesus, what advantage\nis it to me? If the dead do not rise, \"Let\nus eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!\"\nIt is sown in dishonor, it is raised in\nglory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised\nin power.\nDo not be deceived: \"Evil company\ncorrupts good habits.\"\nIt is sown a natural body, it is raised a\nspiritual body. There is a natural body,\nand there is a spiritual body.\nAwake to righteousness, and do not\nsin; for some do not have the knowledge\nof God. I speak this to your shame.\nAnd so it is written, \"The first man\nAdam became a living being.\" The last\nAdam became a life-giving spirit.\nBut someone will say, \"How are the\ndead raised up? And with what body do\nthey come?\"\nHowever, the spiritual is not first, but\nthe natural, and afterward the spiritual.\nFoolish one, what you sow is not made\nalive unless it dies.\nThe first man was of the earth, 1made\nof dust; the second Man is the Lord from\nheaven.\nAnd what you sow, you do not sow\nthat body that shall be, but mere grain-perhaps wheat or some other grain.\nBut God gives it a body as He pleases,\nand to each seed its own body.\nAll flesh is not the same flesh, but\nthere is one kind of flesh of men,\nanother flesh of animals, another of fish,\nand another of birds.\nThere are also celestial bodies and\nterrestrial bodies; but the glory of the\ncelestial is one, and the glory of the\nterrestrial is another.\nThere is one glory of the sun, another\nglory of the moon, and another glory of\nthe stars; for one star differs from\nanother star in glory.\nAs was the man of dust, so also are\nthose who are made of dust; and as is\nthe heavenly Man, so also are those\nwho are heavenly.\nAnd as we have borne the image of\nthe man of dust, we shall also bear the\nimage of the heavenly Man.\nNow this I say, brethren, that flesh and\nblood cannot inherit the kingdom of\nGod; nor does corruption inherit\nincorruption.\nBehold, I tell you a mystery: We shall\nnot all sleep, but we shall all be\nchanged-52\nin a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,\nat the last trumpet. For the trumpet will\nsound, and the dead will be raised\nincorruptible, and we shall be changed.\nBut if it is fitting that I go also, they will\ngo with me.\nFor this corruptible must put on\nincorruption, and this mortal must put on\nimmortality.\nNow I will come to you when I pass\nthrough Macedonia (for I am passing\nthrough Macedonia).\nSo when this corruptible has put on\nincorruption, and this mortal has put on\nimmortality, then shall be brought to\npass the saying that is written: \"Death is\nswallowed up in victory.\"\n\"O Death, where is your sting? O\nHades, where is your victory?\"\nAnd it may be that I will remain, or even\nspend the winter with you, that you may\nsend me on my journey, wherever I go.\nFor I do not wish to see you now on the\nway; but I hope to stay a while with you,\nif the Lord permits.\nThe sting of death is sin, and the\nstrength of sin is the law.\nBut I will tarry in Ephesus until\nPentecost.\nBut thanks be to God, who gives us\nthe victory through our Lord Jesus\nChrist.\nFor a great and effective door has\nopened to me, and there are many\nadversaries.\nTherefore, my beloved brethren, be\nsteadfast,\nimmovable,\nalways\nabounding in the work of the Lord,\nknowing that your labor is not in vain in\nthe Lord.\n16Now concerning the collection for\nthe saints, as I have given orders to the\nchurches of Galatia, so you must do\nalso:\nOn the first day of the week let each\none of you lay something aside, storing\nup as he may prosper, that there be no\ncollections when I come.\nAnd when I come, whomever you\napprove by your letters I will send to\nbear your gift to Jerusalem.\nAnd if Timothy comes, see that he\nmay be with you without fear; for he\ndoes the work of the Lord, as I also do.\nTherefore let no one despise him. But\nsend him on his journey in peace, that\nhe may come to me; for I am waiting for\nhim with the brethren.\nNow concerning our brother Apollos, I\nstrongly urged him to come to you with\nthe brethren, but he was quite unwilling\nto come at this time; however, he will\ncome when he has a convenient time.\nWatch, stand fast in the faith, be brave,\nbe strong.\nLet all that you do be done with love.\nI urge you, brethren--you know the\nhousehold of Stephanas, that it is the\nfirstfruits of Achaia, and that they have\ndevoted themselves to the ministry of\nthe saints--\nLord, with the church that is in their\nhouse.\nAll the brethren greet you. Greet one\nanother with a holy kiss.\nthat you also submit to such, and to\neveryone who works and labors with us.\nThe salutation with my own hand-Paul's.\nI am glad about the coming of\nStephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus,\nfor what was lacking on your part they\nsupplied.\nIf anyone does not love the Lord Jesus\nChrist, let him be accursed. O Lord,\ncome!\nFor they refreshed my spirit and yours.\nTherefore acknowledge such men.\nThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be\nwith you.\nThe churches of Asia greet you. Aquila\nand Priscilla greet you heartily in the\nMy love be with you all in Christ Jesus.\nAmen.\n2nd Corinthians\n1Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by\nthe will of God, and Timothy our brother,\nTo the church of God which is at Corinth,\nwith all the saints who are in all Achaia:\nGrace to you and peace from God our\nFather and the Lord Jesus Christ.\nBlessed be the God and Father of our\nLord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies\nand God of all comfort,\nwho comforts us in all our tribulation,\nthat we may be able to comfort those\nwho are in any trouble, with the comfort\nwith which we ourselves are comforted\nby God.\nFor as the sufferings of Christ abound\nin us, so our consolation also abounds\nthrough Christ.\nNow if we are afflicted, it is for your\nconsolation and salvation, which is\neffective for enduring the same\nsufferings which we also suffer. Or if we\nare comforted, it is for your consolation\nand salvation.\nAnd our hope for you is steadfast,\nbecause we know that as you are\npartakers of the sufferings, so also you\nwill partake of the consolation.\nFor we do not want you to be ignorant,\nbrethren, of our trouble which came to\nus in Asia: that we were burdened\nbeyond measure, above strength, so\nthat we despaired even of life.\nYes, we had the sentence of death in\nourselves, that we should not trust in\nourselves but in God who raises the\ndead,\nwho delivered us from so great a\ndeath, and does deliver us; in whom we\ntrust that He will still deliver us,\nyou also helping together in prayer for\nus, that thanks may be given by many\npersons on our behalf for the gift\ngranted to us through many.\nFor our boasting is this: the testimony\nof our conscience that we conducted\nourselves in the world in simplicity and\ngodly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom\nbut by the grace of God, and more\nabundantly toward you.\nFor we are not writing any other things\nto you than what you read or understand.\nNow I trust you will understand, even to\nthe end\n(as also you have understood us in\npart), that we are your boast as you also\nare ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.\nAnd in this confidence I intended to\ncome to you before, that you might have\na second benefit-16\nto pass by way of you to Macedonia,\nto come again from Macedonia to you,\nand be helped by you on my way to\nJudea.\nFor if I make you sorrowful, then who is\nhe who makes me glad but the one who\nis made sorrowful by me?\nTherefore, when I was planning this,\ndid I do it lightly? Or the things I plan, do\nI plan according to the flesh, that with\nme there should be Yes, Yes, and No,\nNo?\nAnd I wrote this very thing to you, lest,\nwhen I came, I should have sorrow over\nthose from whom I ought to have joy,\nhaving confidence in you all that my joy\nis the joy of you all.\nBut as God is faithful, our word to you\nwas not Yes and No.\nFor the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who\nwas preached among you by us--by me,\nSilvanus, and Timothy--was not Yes and\nNo, but in Him was Yes.\nFor all the promises of God in Him are\nYes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of\nGod through us.\nNow He who establishes us with you\nin Christ and has anointed us is God,\nwho also has sealed us and given us\nthe Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.\nFor out of much affliction and anguish\nof heart I wrote to you, with many tears,\nnot that you should be grieved, but that\nyou might know the love which I have so\nabundantly for you.\nBut if anyone has caused grief, he has\nnot grieved me, but all of you to some\nextent--not to be too severe.\nThis punishment which was inflicted by\nthe majority is sufficient for such a man,\nso that, on the contrary, you ought\nrather to forgive and comfort him, lest\nperhaps such a one be swallowed up\nwith too much sorrow.\nMoreover I call God as witness against\nmy soul, that to spare you I came no\nmore to Corinth.\nTherefore I urge you to reaffirm your\nlove to him.\nNot that we have dominion over your\nfaith, but are fellow workers for your joy;\nfor by faith you stand.\n2But I determined this within myself,\nthat I would not come again to you in\nsorrow.\nFor to this end I also wrote, that I might\nput you to the test, whether you are\nobedient in all things.\nNow whom you forgive anything, I also\nforgive. For if indeed I have forgiven\nanything, I have forgiven that one for\nyour sakes in the presence of Christ,\nlest Satan should take advantage of\nus; for we are not ignorant of his devices.\nFurthermore, when I came to Troas to\npreach Christ's gospel, and a door was\nopened to me by the Lord,\nAnd we have such trust through Christ\ntoward God.\nI had no rest in my spirit, because I did\nnot find Titus my brother; but taking my\nleave of them, I departed for Macedonia.\nNot that we are sufficient of ourselves\nto think of anything as being from\nourselves, but our sufficiency is from\nGod,\nNow thanks be to God who always\nleads us in triumph in Christ, and\nthrough us diffuses the fragrance of His\nknowledge in every place.\nwho also made us sufficient as\nministers of the new covenant, not of the\nletter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills,\nbut the Spirit gives life.\nFor we are to God the fragrance of\nChrist among those who are being\nsaved and among those who are\nperishing.\nTo the one we are the aroma of death\nleading to death, and to the other the\naroma of life leading to life. And who is\nsufficient for these things?\nFor we are not, as so many, peddling\nthe word of God; but as of sincerity, but\nas from God, we speak in the sight of\nGod in Christ.\nBut if the ministry of death, written and\nengraved on stones, was glorious, so\nthat the children of Israel could not look\nsteadily at the face of Moses because of\nthe glory of his countenance, which\nglory was passing away,\nhow will the ministry of the Spirit not be\nmore glorious?\nFor if the ministry of condemnation had\nglory, the ministry of righteousness\nexceeds much more in glory.\n3Do we begin again to commend\nourselves? Or do we need, as some\nothers, epistles of commendation to you\nor letters of commendation from you?\nFor even what was made glorious had\nno glory in this respect, because of the\nglory that excels.\nFor if what is passing away was\nglorious, what remains is much more\nglorious.\nYou are our epistle written in our hearts,\nknown and read by all men;\nTherefore, since we have such hope,\nwe use great boldness of speech--\nclearly you are an epistle of Christ,\nministered by us, written not with ink but\nby the Spirit of the living God, not on\ntablets of stone but on tablets of flesh,\nthat is, of the heart.\nunlike Moses, who put a veil over his\nface so that the children of Israel could\nnot look steadily at the end of what was\npassing away.\nBut their minds were blinded. For until\nthis day the same veil remains unlifted\nin the reading of the Old Testament,\nbecause the veil is taken away in Christ.\nFor we do not preach ourselves, but\nChrist Jesus the Lord, and ourselves\nyour bondservants for Jesus' sake.\nBut even to this day, when Moses is\nread, a veil lies on their heart.\nNevertheless when one turns to the\nLord, the veil is taken away.\nFor it is the God who commanded light\nto shine out of darkness, who has shone\nin our hearts to give the light of the\nknowledge of the glory of God in the\nface of Jesus Christ.\nNow the Lord is the Spirit; and where\nthe Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\nBut we have this treasure in earthen\nvessels, that the excellence of the\npower may be of God and not of us.\nBut we all, with unveiled face,\nbeholding as in a mirror the glory of the\nLord, are being transformed into the\nsame image from glory to glory, just as\nby the Spirit of the Lord.\n4Therefore, since we have this\nministry, as we have received mercy, we\ndo not lose heart.\nBut we have renounced the hidden\nthings of shame, not walking in\ncraftiness nor handling the word of God\ndeceitfully, but by manifestation of the\ntruth commending ourselves to every\nman's conscience in the sight of God.\nBut even if our gospel is veiled, it is\nveiled to those who are perishing,\nwhose minds the god of this age has\nblinded, who do not believe, lest the\nlight of the gospel of the glory of Christ,\nwho is the image of God, should shine\non them.\nWe are hard-pressed on every side, yet\nnot crushed; we are perplexed, but not\nin despair;\npersecuted, but not forsaken; struck\ndown, but not destroyed-10\nalways carrying about in the body the\ndying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of\nJesus also may be manifested in our\nbody.\nFor we who live are always delivered\nto death for Jesus' sake, that the life of\nJesus also may be manifested in our\nmortal flesh.\nSo then death is working in us, but life\nin you.\nAnd since we have the same spirit of\nfaith, according to what is written, \"I\nbelieved and therefore I spoke,\" we also\nbelieve and therefore speak,\nknowing that He who raised up the\nLord Jesus will also raise us up with\nJesus, and will present us with you.\nFor all things are for your sakes, that\ngrace, having spread through the many,\nmay cause thanksgiving to abound to\nthe glory of God.\nSo we are always confident, knowing\nthat while we are at home in the body\nwe are absent from the Lord.\nFor we walk by faith, not by sight.\nTherefore we do not lose heart. Even\nthough our outward man is perishing,\nyet the inward man is being renewed\nday by day.\nWe are confident, yes, well pleased\nrather to be absent from the body and to\nbe present with the Lord.\nFor our light affliction, which is but for\na moment, is working for us a far more\nexceeding and eternal weight of glory,\nTherefore we make it our aim, whether\npresent or absent, to be well pleasing to\nHim.\nwhile we do not look at the things\nwhich are seen, but at the things which\nare not seen. For the things which are\nseen are temporary, but the things\nwhich are not seen are eternal.\nFor we must all appear before the\njudgment seat of Christ, that each one\nmay receive the things done in the body,\naccording to what he has done, whether\ngood or bad.\n5For we know that if our earthly house,\nthis tent, is destroyed, we have a\nbuilding from God, a house not made\nwith hands, eternal in the heavens.\nFor in this we groan, earnestly desiring\nto be clothed with our habitation which is\nfrom heaven,\nKnowing, therefore, the terror of the\nLord, we persuade men; but we are well\nknown to God, and I also trust are well\nknown in your consciences.\nFor we do not commend ourselves\nagain to you, but give you opportunity to\nboast on our behalf, that you may have\nan answer for those who boast in\nappearance and not in heart.\nif indeed, having been clothed, we shall\nnot be found naked.\nFor we who are in this tent groan, being\nburdened, not because we want to be\nunclothed, but further clothed, that\nmortality may be swallowed up by life.\nFor if we are beside ourselves, it is for\nGod; or if we are of sound mind, it is for\nyou.\nFor the love of Christ compels us,\nbecause we judge thus: that if One died\nfor all, then all died;\nNow He who has prepared us for this\nvery thing is God, who also has given us\nthe Spirit as a guarantee.\nand He died for all, that those who live\nshould live no longer for themselves, but\nfor Him who died for them and rose\nagain.\nTherefore, from now on, we regard no\none according to the flesh. Even though\nwe have known Christ according to the\nflesh, yet now we know Him thus no\nlonger.\nTherefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is\na new creation; old things have passed\naway; behold, all things have become\nnew.\nWe give no offense in anything, that our\nministry may not be blamed.\nBut in all things we commend ourselves\nas ministers of God: in much patience,\nin tribulations, in needs, in distresses,\nin stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults,\nin labors, in sleeplessness, in fastings;\nNow all things are of God, who has\nreconciled us to Himself through Jesus\nChrist, and has given us the ministry of\nreconciliation,\nthat is, that God was in Christ\nreconciling the world to Himself, not\nimputing their trespasses to them, and\nhas committed to us the word of\nreconciliation.\nNow then, we are ambassadors for\nChrist, as though God were pleading\nthrough us: we implore you on Christ's\nbehalf, be reconciled to God.\nFor He made Him who knew no sin to\nbe sin for us, that we might become the\nrighteousness of God in Him.\nby\npurity,\nby\nknowledge,\nby\nlongsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy\nSpirit, by sincere love,\nby the word of truth, by the power of\nGod, by the armor of righteousness on\nthe right hand and on the left,\nby honor and dishonor, by evil report\nand good report; as deceivers, and yet\ntrue;\nas unknown, and yet well known; as\ndying, and behold we live; as chastened,\nand yet not killed;\nas sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as\npoor, yet making many rich; as having\nnothing, and yet possessing all things.\n6We then, as workers together with\nO Corinthians! We have spoken\nopenly to you, our heart is wide open.\nHim also plead with you not to receive\nthe grace of God in vain.\nYou are not restricted by us, but you\nare restricted by your own affections.\nFor He says: \"In an acceptable time I\nhave heard you, And in the day of\nsalvation I have helped you.\" Behold,\nnow is the accepted time; behold, now is\nthe day of salvation.\nNow in return for the same (I speak as\nto children), you also be open.\nDo not be unequally yoked together\nwith unbelievers. For what fellowship\nhas righteousness with lawlessness?\nAnd what communion has light with\ndarkness?\nAnd what accord has Christ with\nBelial? Or what part has a believer with\nan unbeliever?\nAnd what agreement has the temple of\nGod with idols? For you are the temple\nof the living God. As God has said: \"I will\ndwell in them And walk among them. I\nwill be their God, And they shall be My\npeople.\"\nTherefore \"Come out from among\nthem And be separate, says the Lord.\nDo not touch what is unclean, And I will\nreceive you.\"\n\"I will be a Father to you, And you shall\nbe My sons and daughters, Says the\nLORD Almighty.\"\n7Therefore, having these promises,\nbeloved, let us cleanse ourselves from\nall filthiness of the flesh and spirit,\nperfecting holiness in the fear of God.\nOpen your hearts to us. We have\nwronged no one, we have corrupted no\none, we have cheated no one.\nI do not say this to condemn; for I have\nsaid before that you are in our hearts, to\ndie together and to live together.\nGreat is my boldness of speech toward\nyou, great is my boasting on your behalf.\nI am filled with comfort. I am\nexceedingly joyful in all our tribulation.\nFor indeed, when we came to\nMacedonia, our bodies had no rest, but\nwe were troubled on every side. Outside\nwere conflicts, inside were fears.\nNevertheless God, who comforts the\ndowncast, comforted us by the coming\nof Titus,\nand not only by his coming, but also by\nthe consolation with which he was\ncomforted in you, when he told us of\nyour earnest desire, your mourning,\nyour zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even\nmore.\nFor even if I made you sorry with my\nletter, I do not regret it; though I did\nregret it. For I perceive that the same\nepistle made you sorry, though only for\na while.\nNow I rejoice, not that you were made\nsorry, but that your sorrow led to\nrepentance. For you were made sorry in\na godly manner, that you might suffer\nloss from us in nothing.\nFor godly sorrow produces repentance\nleading to salvation, not to be regretted;\nbut the sorrow of the world produces\ndeath.\nFor observe this very thing, that you\nsorrowed in a godly manner: What\ndiligence it produced in you, what\nclearing of yourselves, what indignation,\nwhat fear, what vehement desire, what\nzeal, what vindication! In all things you\nproved yourselves to be clear in this\nmatter.\nTherefore, although I wrote to you, I\ndid not do it for the sake of him who had\ndone the wrong, nor for the sake of him\nwho suffered wrong, but that our care\nfor you in the sight of God might appear\nto you.\nAnd not only as we had hoped, but they\nfirst gave themselves to the Lord, and\nthen to us by the will of God.\nSo we urged Titus, that as he had\nbegun, so he would also complete this\ngrace in you as well.\nTherefore we have been comforted in\nyour comfort. And we rejoiced\nexceedingly more for the joy of Titus,\nbecause his spirit has been refreshed by\nyou all.\nBut as you abound in everything--in\nfaith, in speech, in knowledge, in all\ndiligence, and in your love for us--see\nthat you abound in this grace also.\nFor if in anything I have boasted to him\nabout you, I am not ashamed. But as we\nspoke all things to you in truth, even so\nour boasting to Titus was found true.\nI speak not by commandment, but I am\ntesting the sincerity of your love by the\ndiligence of others.\nAnd his affections are greater for you\nas he remembers the obedience of you\nall, how with fear and trembling you\nreceived him.\nFor you know the grace of our Lord\nJesus Christ, that though He was rich,\nyet for your sakes He became poor, that\nyou through His poverty might become\nrich.\nTherefore I rejoice that I\nconfidence in you in everything.\nhave\n8Moreover, brethren, we make known\nto you the grace of God bestowed on\nthe churches of Macedonia:\nthat in a great trial of affliction the\nabundance of their joy and their deep\npoverty abounded in the riches of their\nliberality.\nFor I bear witness that according to\ntheir ability, yes, and beyond their ability,\nthey were freely willing,\nAnd in this I give advice: It is to your\nadvantage not only to be doing what you\nbegan and were desiring to do a year\nago;\nbut now you also must complete the\ndoing of it; that as there was a readiness\nto desire it, so there also may be a\ncompletion out of what you have.\nFor if there is first a willing mind, it is\naccepted according to what one has,\nand not according to what he does not\nhave.\nFor I do not mean that others should\nbe eased and you burdened;\nimploring us with much urgency that we\nwould receive the gift and the fellowship\nof the ministering to the saints.\nbut by an equality, that now at this\ntime your abundance may supply their\nlack, that their abundance also may\nsupply your lack--that there may be\nequality.\ninquired about, they are messengers of\nthe churches, the glory of Christ.\nAs it is written, \"He who gathered\nmuch had nothing left over, and he who\ngathered little had no lack.\"\nBut thanks be to God who puts the\nsame earnest care for you into the heart\nof Titus.\nFor he not only accepted the\nexhortation, but being more diligent, he\nwent to you of his own accord.\nAnd we have sent with him the brother\nwhose praise is in the gospel throughout\nall the churches,\nand not only that, but who was also\nchosen by the churches to travel with us\nwith this gift, which is administered by\nus to the glory of the Lord Himself and\nto show your ready mind,\navoiding this: that anyone should\nblame us in this lavish gift which is\nadministered by us-21\nproviding honorable things, not only in\nthe sight of the Lord, but also in the\nsight of men.\nAnd we have sent with them our\nbrother whom we have often proved\ndiligent in many things, but now much\nmore diligent, because of the great\nconfidence which we have in you.\nTherefore show to them, and before\nthe churches, the proof of your love and\nof our boasting on your behalf.\n9Now concerning the ministering to\nthe saints, it is superfluous for me to\nwrite to you;\nfor I know your willingness, about which\nI boast of you to the Macedonians, that\nAchaia was ready a year ago; and your\nzeal has stirred up the majority.\nYet I have sent the brethren, lest our\nboasting of you should be in vain in this\nrespect, that, as I said, you may be\nready;\nlest if some Macedonians come with\nme and find you unprepared, we (not to\nmention you!) should be ashamed of\nthis confident boasting.\nTherefore I thought it necessary to\nexhort the brethren to go to you ahead\nof time, and prepare your generous gift\nbeforehand, which you had previously\npromised, that it may be ready as a\nmatter of generosity and not as a\ngrudging obligation.\nBut this I say: He who sows sparingly\nwill also reap sparingly, and he who\nsows bountifully will also reap bountifully.\nIf anyone inquires about Titus, he is\nmy\npartner\nand\nfellow\nworker\nconcerning you. Or if our brethren are\nSo let each one give as he purposes in\nhis heart, not grudgingly or of necessity;\nfor God loves a cheerful giver.\nAnd God is able to make all grace\nabound toward you, that you, always\nhaving all sufficiency in all things, may\nhave an abundance for every good work.\nBut I beg you that when I am present I\nmay not be bold with that confidence by\nwhich I intend to be bold against some,\nwho think of us as if we walked\naccording to the flesh.\nAs it is written: \"He has dispersed\nabroad, He has given to the poor; His\nrighteousness endures forever.\"\nFor though we walk in the flesh, we do\nnot war according to the flesh.\nNow may He who supplies seed to the\nsower, and bread for food, supply and\nmultiply the seed you have sown and\nincrease the fruits of your righteousness,\nFor the weapons of our warfare are not\ncarnal but mighty in God for pulling\ndown strongholds,\nwhile you are enriched in everything\nfor\nall\nliberality,\nwhich\ncauses\nthanksgiving through us to God.\ncasting down arguments and every\nhigh thing that exalts itself against the\nknowledge of God, bringing every\nthought into captivity to the obedience of\nChrist,\nFor the administration of this service\nnot only supplies the needs of the saints,\nbut also is abounding through many\nthanksgivings to God,\nand being ready to punish all\ndisobedience when your obedience is\nfulfilled.\nwhile, through the proof of this ministry,\nthey glorify God for the obedience of\nyour confession to the gospel of Christ,\nand for your liberal sharing with them\nand all men,\nDo you look at things according to the\noutward appearance? If anyone is\nconvinced in himself that he is Christ's,\nlet him again consider this in himself,\nthat just as he is Christ's, even so we\nare Christ's.\nand by their prayer for you, who long\nfor you because of the exceeding grace\nof God in you.\nThanks\nbe\nto\nindescribable gift!\nGod\nfor\nHis\nFor even if I should boast somewhat\nmore about our authority, which the Lord\ngave us for edification and not for your\ndestruction, I shall not be ashamed-9\nlest I seem to terrify you by letters.\n10Now I, Paul, myself am pleading\nwith you by the meekness and\ngentleness of Christ--who in presence\nam lowly among you, but being absent\nam bold toward you.\n\"For his letters,\" they say, \"are weighty\nand powerful, but his bodily presence is\nweak, and his speech contemptible.\"\nLet such a person consider this, that\nwhat we are in word by letters when we\nare absent, such we will also be in deed\nwhen we are present.\nFor we dare not class ourselves or\ncompare ourselves with those who\ncommend\nthemselves.\nBut\nthey,\nmeasuring themselves by themselves,\nand comparing themselves among\nthemselves, are not wise.\nWe, however, will not boast beyond\nmeasure, but within the limits of the\nsphere which God appointed us--a\nsphere which especially includes you.\nFor we are not overextending\nourselves (as though our authority did\nnot extend to you), for it was to you that\nwe came with the gospel of Christ;\nnot boasting of things beyond measure,\nthat is, in other men's labors, but having\nhope, that as your faith is increased, we\nshall be greatly enlarged by you in our\nsphere,\nFor I am jealous for you with godly\njealousy. For I have betrothed you to\none husband, that I may present you as\na chaste virgin to Christ.\nBut I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent\ndeceived Eve by his craftiness, so your\nminds may be corrupted from the\nsimplicity that is in Christ.\nFor if he who comes preaches another\nJesus whom we have not preached, or if\nyou receive a different spirit which you\nhave not received, or a different gospel\nwhich you have not accepted--you may\nwell put up with it!\nFor I consider that I am not at all\ninferior to the most eminent apostles.\nEven though I am untrained in speech,\nyet I am not in knowledge. But we have\nbeen thoroughly manifested among you\nin all things.\nto preach the gospel in the regions\nbeyond you, and not to boast in another\nman's sphere of accomplishment.\nDid I commit sin in humbling myself that\nyou might be exalted, because I\npreached the gospel of God to you free\nof charge?\nBut \"he who glories, let him glory in the\nLORD.\"\nI robbed other churches, taking wages\nfrom them to minister to you.\nFor not he who commends himself is\napproved,\nbut\nwhom\nthe\nLord\ncommends.\n11Oh, that you would bear with me\nin a little folly--and indeed you do bear\nwith me.\nAnd when I was present with you, and\nin need, I was a burden to no one, for\nwhat I lacked the brethren who came\nfrom Macedonia supplied. And in\neverything I kept myself from being\nburdensome to you, and so I will keep\nmyself.\nAs the truth of Christ is in me, no one\nshall stop me from this boasting in the\nregions of Achaia.\nTo our shame I say that we were too\nweak for that! But in whatever anyone is\nbold--I speak foolishly--I am bold also.\nWhy? Because I do not love you? God\nknows!\nAre they Hebrews? So am I. Are they\nIsraelites? So am I. Are they the seed of\nAbraham? So am I.\nBut what I do, I will also continue to do,\nthat I may cut off the opportunity from\nthose who desire an opportunity to be\nregarded just as we are in the things of\nwhich they boast.\nAre they ministers of Christ?--I speak\nas a fool--I am more: in labors more\nabundant, in stripes above measure, in\nprisons more frequently, in deaths often.\nFor such are false apostles, deceitful\nworkers, transforming themselves into\napostles of Christ.\nFrom the Jews five times I received\nforty stripes minus one.\nAnd no wonder! For Satan himself\ntransforms himself into an angel of light.\nThree times I was beaten with rods;\nonce I was stoned; three times I was\nshipwrecked; a night and a day I have\nbeen in the deep;\nTherefore it is no great thing if his\nministers also transform themselves into\nministers of righteousness, whose end\nwill be according to their works.\nI say again, let no one think me a fool.\nIf otherwise, at least receive me as a\nfool, that I also may boast a little.\nWhat I speak, I speak not according to\nthe Lord, but as it were, foolishly, in this\nconfidence of boasting.\nin journeys often, in perils of waters, in\nperils of robbers, in perils of my own\ncountrymen, in perils of the Gentiles, in\nperils in the city, in perils in the\nwilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils\namong false brethren;\nin weariness and toil, in sleeplessness\noften, in hunger and thirst, in fastings\noften, in cold and nakedness-28\nSeeing that many boast according to\nthe flesh, I also will boast.\nbesides the other things, what comes\nupon me daily: my deep concern for all\nthe churches.\nFor you put up with fools gladly, since\nyou yourselves are wise!\nWho is weak, and I am not weak?\nWho is made to stumble, and I do not\nburn with indignation?\nFor you put up with it if one brings you\ninto bondage, if one devours you, if one\ntakes from you, if one exalts himself, if\none strikes you on the face.\nIf I must boast, I will boast in the things\nwhich concern my infirmity.\nThe God and Father of our Lord Jesus\nChrist, who is blessed forever, knows\nthat I am not lying.\nrevelations, a thorn in the flesh was\ngiven to me, a messenger of Satan to\nbuffet me, lest I be exalted above\nmeasure.\nIn Damascus the governor, under\nAretas the king, was guarding the city of\nthe Damascenes with a garrison,\ndesiring to arrest me;\nConcerning this thing I pleaded with the\nLord three times that it might depart\nfrom me.\nbut I was let down in a basket through\na window in the wall, and escaped from\nhis hands.\n12It is doubtless not profitable for me\nto boast. I will come to visions and\nrevelations of the Lord:\nI know a man in Christ who fourteen\nyears ago--whether in the body I do not\nknow, or whether out of the body I do\nnot know, God knows--such a one was\ncaught up to the third heaven.\nAnd I know such a man--whether in the\nbody or out of the body I do not know,\nGod knows-4\nhow he was caught up into Paradise\nand heard inexpressible words, which it\nis not lawful for a man to utter.\nOf such a one I will boast; yet of myself\nI will not boast, except in my infirmities.\nFor though I might desire to boast, I will\nnot be a fool; for I will speak the truth.\nBut I refrain, lest anyone should think of\nme above what he sees me to be or\nhears from me.\nAnd lest I should be exalted above\nmeasure by the abundance of the\nAnd He said to me, \"My grace is\nsufficient for you, for My strength is\nmade perfect in weakness.\" Therefore\nmost gladly I will rather boast in my\ninfirmities, that the power of Christ may\nrest upon me.\nTherefore I take pleasure in infirmities,\nin reproaches, in needs, in persecutions,\nin distresses, for Christ's sake. For when\nI am weak, then I am strong.\nI have become a fool in boasting; you\nhave compelled me. For I ought to have\nbeen commended by you; for in nothing\nwas I behind the most eminent apostles,\nthough I am nothing.\nTruly the signs of an apostle were\naccomplished among you with all\nperseverance, in signs and wonders and\nmighty deeds.\nFor what is it in which you were inferior\nto other churches, except that I myself\nwas not burdensome to you? Forgive\nme this wrong!\nNow for the third time I am ready to\ncome to you. And I will not be\nburdensome to you; for I do not seek\nyours, but you. For the children ought\nnot to lay up for the parents, but the\nparents for the children.\nAnd I will very gladly spend and be\nspent for your souls; though the more\nabundantly I love you, the less I am\nloved.\nI have told you before, and foretell as if\nI were present the second time, and\nnow being absent I write to those who\nhave sinned before, and to all the rest,\nthat if I come again I will not spare--\nBut be that as it may, I did not burden\nyou. Nevertheless, being crafty, I caught\nyou by cunning!\nsince you seek a proof of Christ\nspeaking in me, who is not weak toward\nyou, but mighty in you.\nDid I take advantage of you by any of\nthose whom I sent to you?\nI urged Titus, and sent our brother with\nhim. Did Titus take advantage of you?\nDid we not walk in the same spirit? Did\nwe not walk in the same steps?\nFor though He was crucified in\nweakness, yet He lives by the power of\nGod. For we also are weak in Him, but\nwe shall live with Him by the power of\nGod toward you.\nAgain, do you think that we excuse\nourselves to you? We speak before God\nin Christ. But we do all things, beloved,\nfor your edification.\nExamine yourselves as to whether you\nare in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you\nnot know yourselves, that Jesus Christ\nis in you?--unless indeed you are\ndisqualified.\nFor I fear lest, when I come, I shall not\nfind you such as I wish, and that I shall\nbe found by you such as you do not\nwish; lest there be contentions,\njealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish\nambitions, backbitings, whisperings,\nconceits, tumults;\nBut I trust that you will know that we are\nnot disqualified.\nNow I pray to God that you do no evil,\nnot that we should appear approved, but\nthat you should do what is honorable,\nthough we may seem disqualified.\nlest, when I come again, my God will\nhumble me among you, and I shall\nmourn for many who have sinned before\nand have not repented of the\nuncleanness, fornication, and lewdness\nwhich they have practiced.\nFor we can do nothing against the truth,\nbut for the truth.\n13This will be the third time I am\ncoming to you. \"By the mouth of two or\nthree witnesses every word shall be\nestablished.\"\nFor we are glad when we are weak and\nyou are strong. And this also we pray,\nthat you may be made complete.\nTherefore I write these things being\nabsent, lest being present I should use\nsharpness, according to the authority\nwhich the Lord has given me for\nedification and not for destruction.\nFinally, brethren, farewell. Become\ncomplete.

Amen.\nGalatians\n1Paul, an apostle (not from men nor\nthrough man, but through Jesus Christ\nand God the Father who raised Him\nfrom the dead),\nand all the brethren who are with me,\nTo the churches of Galatia:\nGrace to you and peace from God the\nFather and our Lord Jesus Christ,\nwho gave Himself for our sins, that He\nmight deliver us from this present evil\nage, according to the will of our God and\nFather,\nto whom be glory forever and ever.\nAmen.\nI marvel that you are turning away so\nsoon from Him who called you in the\ngrace of Christ, to a different gospel,\nwhich is not another; but there are\nsome who trouble you and want to\npervert the gospel of Christ.\nBut even if we, or an angel from\nheaven, preach any other gospel to you\nthan what we have preached to you, let\nhim be accursed.\nAs we have said before, so now I say\nagain, if anyone preaches any other\ngospel to you than what you have\nreceived, let him be accursed.\nFor do I now persuade men, or God?\nOr do I seek to please men? For if I still\npleased men, I would not be a\nbondservant of Christ.\nBut I make known to you, brethren,\nthat the gospel which was preached by\nme is not according to man.\nFor I neither received it from man, nor\nwas I taught it, but it came through the\nrevelation of Jesus Christ.\nFor you have heard of my former\nconduct in Judaism, how I persecuted\nthe church of God beyond measure and\ntried to destroy it.\nAnd I advanced in Judaism beyond\nmany of my contemporaries in my own\nnation, being more exceedingly zealous\nfor the traditions of my fathers.\nBut when it pleased God, who\nseparated me from my mother's womb\nand called me through His grace,\nto reveal His Son in me, that I might\npreach Him among the Gentiles, I did\nnot immediately confer with flesh and\nblood,\nnor did I go up to Jerusalem to those\nwho were apostles before me; but I went\nto Arabia, and returned again to\nDamascus.\nThen after three years I went up to\nJerusalem to see Peter, and remained\nwith him fifteen days.\nBut I saw none of the other apostles\nexcept James, the Lord's brother.\nto whom we did not yield submission\neven for an hour, that the truth of the\ngospel might continue with you.\n(Now concerning the things which I\nwrite to you, indeed, before God, I do\nnot lie.)\nAfterward I went into the regions of\nSyria and Cilicia.\nBut from those who seemed to be\nsomething--whatever they were, it\nmakes no difference to me; God shows\npersonal favoritism to no man--for those\nwho seemed to be something added\nnothing to me.\nAnd I was unknown by face to the\nchurches of Judea which were in Christ.\nBut they were hearing only, \"He who\nformerly persecuted us now preaches\nthe faith which he once tried to destroy.\"\nAnd they glorified God in me.\n2Then after fourteen years I went up\nagain to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and\nalso took Titus with me.\nBut on the contrary, when they saw that\nthe gospel for the uncircumcised had\nbeen committed to me, as the gospel for\nthe circumcised was to Peter\n(for He who worked effectively in Peter\nfor the apostleship to the circumcised\nalso worked effectively in me toward the\nGentiles),\nand when James, Cephas, and John,\nwho seemed to be pillars, perceived the\ngrace that had been given to me, they\ngave me and Barnabas the right hand of\nfellowship, that we should go to the\nGentiles and they to the circumcised.\nAnd I went up by revelation, and\ncommunicated to them that gospel\nwhich I preach among the Gentiles, but\nprivately to those who were of reputation,\nlest by any means I might run, or had\nrun, in vain.\nThey desired only that we should\nremember the poor, the very thing which\nI also was eager to do.\nYet not even Titus who was with me,\nbeing a Greek, was compelled to be\ncircumcised.\nNow when Peter had come to Antioch,\nI withstood him to his face, because he\nwas to be blamed;\nAnd this occurred because of false\nbrethren secretly brought in (who came\nin by stealth to spy out our liberty which\nwe have in Christ Jesus, that they might\nbring us into bondage),\nfor before certain men came from\nJames, he would eat with the Gentiles;\nbut when they came, he withdrew and\nseparated himself, fearing those who\nwere of the circumcision.\nAnd the rest of the Jews also played\nthe hypocrite with him, so that even\nBarnabas was carried away with their\nhypocrisy.\nBut when I saw that they were not\nstraightforward about the truth of the\ngospel, I said to Peter before them all,\n\"If you, being a Jew, live in the manner\nof Gentiles and not as the Jews, why do\nyou compel Gentiles to live as Jews?\nWe who are Jews by nature, and not\nsinners of the Gentiles,\nknowing that a man is not justified by\nthe works of the law but by faith in Jesus\nChrist, even we have believed in Christ\nJesus, that we might be justified by faith\nin Christ and not by the works of the\nlaw; for by the works of the law no flesh\nshall be justified.\n\"But if, while we seek to be justified by\nChrist, we ourselves also are found\nsinners, is Christ therefore a minister of\nsin? Certainly not!\nFor if I build again those things which I\ndestroyed, I make myself a transgressor.\nFor I through the law died to the law\nthat I might live to God.\nI have been crucified with Christ; it is\nno longer I who live, but Christ lives in\nme; and the life which I now live in the\nflesh I live by faith in the Son of God,\nwho loved me and gave Himself for me.\nI do not set aside the grace of God; for\nif righteousness comes through the law,\nthen Christ died in vain.\"\n3O foolish Galatians! Who has\nbewitched you that you should not obey\nthe truth, before whose eyes Jesus\nChrist was clearly portrayed among you\nas crucified?\nThis only I want to learn from you: Did\nyou receive the Spirit by the works of\nthe law, or by the hearing of faith?\nAre you so foolish? Having begun in\nthe Spirit, are you now being made\nperfect by the flesh?\nHave you suffered so many things in\nvain--if indeed it was in vain?\nTherefore He who supplies the Spirit to\nyou and works miracles among you,\ndoes He do it by the works of the law, or\nby the hearing of faith?-6\njust as Abraham \"believed God, and it\nwas\naccounted\nto\nhim\nfor\nrighteousness.\"\nTherefore know that only those who are\nof faith are sons of Abraham.\nAnd the Scripture, foreseeing that God\nwould justify the Gentiles by faith,\npreached the gospel to Abraham\nbeforehand, saying, \"In you all the\nnations shall be blessed.\"\nSo then those who are of faith are\nblessed with believing Abraham.\nFor as many as are of the works of the\nlaw are under the curse; for it is written,\n\"Cursed is everyone who does not\ncontinue in all things which are written in\nthe book of the law, to do them.\"\ncome to whom the promise was made;\nand it was appointed through angels by\nthe hand of a mediator.\nBut that no one is justified by the law\nin the sight of God is evident, for \"the\njust shall live by faith.\"\nNow a mediator does not mediate for\none only, but God is one.\nYet the law is not of faith, but \"the man\nwho does them shall live by them.\"\nChrist has redeemed us from the\ncurse of the law, having become a curse\nfor us (for it is written, \"Cursed is\neveryone who hangs on a tree\" ),\nthat the blessing of Abraham might\ncome upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus,\nthat we might receive the promise of the\nSpirit through faith.\nBrethren, I speak in the manner of\nmen: Though it is only a man's covenant,\nyet if it is confirmed, no one annuls or\nadds to it.\nIs the law then against the promises of\nGod? Certainly not! For if there had\nbeen a law given which could have\ngiven life, truly righteousness would\nhave been by the law.\nBut the Scripture has confined all\nunder sin, that the promise by faith in\nJesus Christ might be given to those\nwho believe.\nBut before faith came, we were kept\nunder guard by the law, kept for the faith\nwhich would afterward be revealed.\nTherefore the law was our tutor to\nbring us to Christ, that we might be\njustified by faith.\nNow to Abraham and his Seed were\nthe promises made. He does not say,\n\"And to seeds,\" as of many, but as of\none, \"And to your Seed,\" who is Christ.\nBut after faith has come, we are no\nlonger under a tutor.\nAnd this I say, that the law, which was\nfour hundred and thirty years later,\ncannot annul the covenant that was\nconfirmed before by God in Christ, that it\nshould make the promise of no effect.\nFor you are all sons of God through\nfaith in Christ Jesus.\nFor as many of you as were baptized\ninto Christ have put on Christ.\nFor if the inheritance is of the law, it is\nno longer of promise; but God gave it to\nAbraham by promise.\nThere is neither Jew nor Greek, there\nis neither slave nor free, there is neither\nmale nor female; for you are all one in\nChrist Jesus.\nWhat purpose then does the law\nserve? It was added because of\ntransgressions, till the Seed should\nAnd if you are Christ's, then you are\nAbraham's seed, and heirs according to\nthe promise.\n4Now I say that the heir, as long as he\nI am afraid for you, lest I have labored\nfor you in vain.\nis a child, does not differ at all from a\nslave, though he is master of all,\nbut is under guardians and stewards\nuntil the time appointed by the father.\nEven so we, when we were children,\nwere in bondage under the elements of\nthe world.\nBut when the fullness of the time had\ncome, God sent forth His Son, born of a\nwoman, born under the law,\nto redeem those who were under the\nlaw, that we might receive the adoption\nas sons.\nAnd because you are sons, God has\nsent forth the Spirit of His Son into your\nhearts, crying out, \"Abba, Father!\"\nTherefore you are no longer a slave but\na son, and if a son, then an heir of God\nthrough Christ.\nBut then, indeed, when you did not\nknow God, you served those which by\nnature are not gods.\nBut now after you have known God, or\nrather are known by God, how is it that\nyou turn again to the weak and beggarly\nelements, to which you desire again to\nbe in bondage?\nBrethren, I urge you to become like me,\nfor I became like you. You have not\ninjured me at all.\nYou know that because of physical\ninfirmity I preached the gospel to you at\nthe first.\nAnd my trial which was in my flesh you\ndid not despise or reject, but you\nreceived me as an angel of God, even\nas Christ Jesus.\nWhat then was the blessing you\nenjoyed? For I bear you witness that, if\npossible, you would have plucked out\nyour own eyes and given them to me.\nHave I therefore become your enemy\nbecause I tell you the truth?\nThey zealously court you, but for no\ngood; yes, they want to exclude you,\nthat you may be zealous for them.\nBut it is good to be zealous in a good\nthing always, and not only when I am\npresent with you.\nMy little children, for whom I labor in\nbirth again until Christ is formed in you,\nI would like to be present with you now\nand to change my tone; for I have\ndoubts about you.\nYou observe days and months and\nseasons and years.\nTell me, you who desire to be under\nthe law, do you not hear the law?\nFor it is written that Abraham had two\nsons: the one by a bondwoman, the\nother by a freewoman.\nBut he who was of the bondwoman\nwas born according to the flesh, and he\nof the freewoman through promise,\nwhich things are symbolic. For these\nare the two covenants: the one from\nMount Sinai which gives birth to\nbondage, which is Hagar-25\nfor this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia,\nand corresponds to Jerusalem which\nnow is, and is in bondage with her\nchildren-26\nbut the Jerusalem above is free, which\nis the mother of us all.\nFor it is written: \"Rejoice, O barren,\nYou who do not bear! Break forth and\nshout, You who are not in labor! For the\ndesolate has many more children Than\nshe who has a husband.\"\nNow we, brethren, as Isaac was, are\nchildren of promise.\nBut, as he who was born according to\nthe flesh then persecuted him who was\nborn according to the Spirit, even so it is\nnow.\nNevertheless what does the Scripture\nsay? \"Cast out the bondwoman and her\nson, for the son of the bondwoman shall\nnot be heir with the son of the\nfreewoman.\"\nSo then, brethren, we are not children\nof the bondwoman but of the free.\n5Stand fast therefore in the liberty by\nwhich Christ has made us free, and do\nnot be entangled again with a yoke of\nbondage.\nIndeed I, Paul, say to you that if you\nbecome circumcised, Christ will profit\nyou nothing.\nAnd I testify again to every man who\nbecomes circumcised that he is a debtor\nto keep the whole law.\nYou have become estranged from\nChrist, you who attempt to be justified\nby law; you have fallen from grace.\nFor we through the Spirit eagerly wait\nfor the hope of righteousness by faith.\nFor in Christ Jesus neither circumcision\nnor uncircumcision avails anything, but\nfaith working through love.\nYou ran well. Who hindered you from\nobeying the truth?\nThis persuasion does not come from\nHim who calls you.\nA little leaven leavens the whole lump.\nI have confidence in you, in the Lord,\nthat you will have no other mind; but he\nwho troubles you shall bear his\njudgment, whoever he is.\nAnd I, brethren, if I still preach\ncircumcision, why do I still suffer\npersecution? Then the offense of the\ncross has ceased.\nI could wish that those who trouble you\nwould even cut themselves off!\nBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,\npeace,\nlongsuffering,\nkindness,\ngoodness, faithfulness,\nFor you, brethren, have been called to\nliberty; only do not use liberty as an\nopportunity for the flesh, but through\nlove serve one another.\ngentleness, self-control. Against such\nthere is no law.\nFor all the law is fulfilled in one word,\neven in this: \"You shall love your\nneighbor as yourself.\"\nAnd those who are Christ's have\ncrucified the flesh with its passions and\ndesires.\nBut if you bite and devour one another,\nbeware lest you be consumed by one\nanother!\nI say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you\nshall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.\nFor the flesh lusts against the Spirit,\nand the Spirit against the flesh; and\nthese are contrary to one another, so\nthat you do not do the things that you\nwish.\nBut if you are led by the Spirit, you are\nnot under the law.\nNow the works of the flesh are evident,\nwhich\nare:\nadultery,\nfornication,\nuncleanness, lewdness,\nidolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions,\njealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish\nambitions, dissensions, heresies,\nenvy, murders, drunkenness, revelries,\nand the like; of which I tell you\nbeforehand, just as I also told you in\ntime past, that those who practice such\nthings will not inherit the kingdom of\nGod.\nIf we live in the Spirit, let us also walk\nin the Spirit.\nLet us not become conceited,\nprovoking one another, envying one\nanother.\n6Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any\ntrespass, you who are spiritual restore\nsuch a one in a spirit of gentleness,\nconsidering yourself lest you also be\ntempted.\nBear one another's burdens, and so\nfulfill the law of Christ.\nFor if anyone thinks himself to be\nsomething, when he is nothing, he\ndeceives himself.\nBut let each one examine his own work,\nand then he will have rejoicing in himself\nalone, and not in another.\nFor each one shall bear his own load.\nLet him who is taught the word share in\nall good things with him who teaches.\nDo not be deceived, God is not\nmocked; for whatever a man sows, that\nhe will also reap.\nFor not even those who are\ncircumcised keep the law, but they\ndesire to have you circumcised that they\nmay boast in your flesh.\nFor he who sows to his flesh will of the\nflesh reap corruption, but he who sows\nto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap\neverlasting life.\nBut God forbid that I should boast\nexcept in the cross of our Lord Jesus\nChrist, by whom the world has been\ncrucified to me, and I to the world.\nAnd let us not grow weary while doing\ngood, for in due season we shall reap if\nwe do not lose heart.\nFor\nin\nChrist\nJesus\nneither\ncircumcision nor uncircumcision avails\nanything, but a new creation.\nTherefore, as we have opportunity, let\nus do good to all, especially to those\nwho are of the household of faith.\nAnd as many as walk according to this\nrule, peace and mercy be upon them,\nand upon the Israel of God.\nSee with what large letters I have\nwritten to you with my own hand!\nAs many as desire to make a good\nshowing in the flesh, these would\ncompel you to be circumcised, only that\nthey may not suffer persecution for the\ncross of Christ.\nFrom now on let no one trouble me, for\nI bear in my body the marks of the Lord\nJesus.\nBrethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus\nChrist be with your spirit.

His\nwill,\nto the praise of the glory of His grace,\nby which He made us accepted in the\nBeloved.\nIn Him we have redemption through His\nblood, the forgiveness of sins, according\nto the riches of His grace\nwhich He made to abound toward us in\nall wisdom and prudence,\nhaving made known to us the mystery\nof His will, according to His good\npleasure which He purposed in Himself,\nthat in the

the saints,\ndo not cease to give thanks for you,\nmaking mention of you in my prayers:\nthat the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,\nthe Father of glory, may give to you the\nspirit of wisdom and

in\nthe saints,\neven when we were dead in trespasses,\nmade us alive together with Christ (by\ngrace you have been saved),\nand what is the exceeding greatness\nof His power toward us who believe,\naccording to the working of His mighty\npower\nand raised us up together, and made\nus sit together in the heavenly places in\nChrist Jesus,\nwhich He worked in Christ when He\nraised Him from the dead and seated\nHim at His right hand in the heavenly\nplaces,\nthat in the ages to come He might show\nthe exceeding riches of His grace in His\nkindness toward us in Christ Jesus.\nfar above all principality and power\nand might and dominion, and every\nname that is named, not only in this age\nbut also in that which is to come.\nAnd He put all things under His feet,\nand gave Him to be head over all things\nto the church,\nwhich is His body, the fullness of Him\nwho fills all in all.\n2And you He made alive, who were\ndead in trespasses and sins,\nin which you once walked according to\nthe course of this world, according to the\nprince of the power of the air, the spirit\nwho now works in the sons of\ndisobedience,\namong whom also we all once\nconducted ourselves in

is called the\nCircumcision made in the flesh by\nhands-12\nthat at that time you were without\nChrist,\nbeing\naliens\nfrom\nthe\ncommonwealth of Israel and strangers\nfrom the covenants of promise, having\nno hope and without God in the world.\nBut now in Christ Jesus you who once\nwere far off have been brought near by\nthe blood of Christ.\nFor He Himself is our peace, who has\nmade both one,

were afar off and to those who\nwere near.\nhow that by revelation He made known\nto me the mystery (as I have briefly\nwritten already,\nby which, when you read, you may\nunderstand my knowledge in the\nmystery of Christ),\nwhich in other ages was not made\nknown to the sons of men, as it has now\nbeen revealed by the Spirit to His holy\napostles and prophets:\nFor through Him we both have access\nby one Spirit to the Father.\nthat the Gentiles should be fellow heirs,\nof the same body, and partakers of His\npromise in Christ through the gospel,\nNow, therefore, you are no

tribulations for you, which is\nyour glory.\nFor this reason I bow my knees to the\nFather of our Lord Jesus Christ,\nfrom whom the whole family in heaven\nand earth is named,\nthat He would grant you, according to\nthe riches of His glory, to be\nstrengthened with might through His\nSpirit in the inner man,\nthat Christ may dwell in your hearts\nthrough faith; that you, being rooted and\ngrounded in love,\nmay be able to comprehend with all\nthe saints what is the width and length\nand depth and height-19\nto know the love of Christ which\npasses knowledge; that you may be\nfilled with all the fullness of God.\nNow to Him who is able to do\nexceedingly abundantly above all that\nwe ask or think, according to the power\nthat works in us,\nto Him be glory in the church

Amen.\n4I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord,\nbeseech you to walk worthy of the\ncalling with which you were called,\nwith all lowliness and gentleness, with\nlongsuffering, bearing with one another\nin love,\nendeavoring to keep the unity of the\nSpirit in the bond of peace.\nThere is one body and one Spirit, just\nas you were called in one hope of your\ncalling;\none Lord, one faith, one baptism;\none God and Father of all, who is\nabove all, and through all, and in you all.\nBut to each one of us grace was given\naccording to the measure of Christ's gift.\nTherefore He says: \"When He\nascended on high, He led captivity\ncaptive, And gave gifts to men.\"\n(Now this, \"He ascended\"--what does it\nmean but that He also first descended\ninto the lower parts of the earth?\nHe who descended is also the One\nwho ascended far above all the heavens,\nthat He might fill all things.)\nAnd He Himself gave some to be\napostles,\nsome\nprophets,\nsome\nevangelists, and some pastors and\nteachers,\nfor the equipping of the saints for the\nwork of ministry, for the edifying of the\nbody of Christ,\nif indeed you have heard Him and\nhave been taught by Him, as the truth is\nin Jesus:\ntill we all come to the unity of the faith\nand of the knowledge of the Son of God,\nto a perfect man, to the measure of the\nstature of the fullness of Christ;\nthat you put off, concerning your\nformer conduct, the old man which\ngrows corrupt according to the deceitful\nlusts,\nthat we should no longer be children,\ntossed to and fro and carried about with\nevery wind of doctrine, by the trickery of\nmen, in the cunning craftiness of\ndeceitful plotting,\nbut, speaking the truth in love, may\ngrow up in all things into Him who is the\nhead--Christ-16\nfrom whom the whole body, joined and\nknit together by what every joint\nsupplies, according to the effective\nworking by which every part does its\nshare, causes growth of the body for the\nedifying of itself in love.\nThis I say, therefore, and testify in the\nLord, that you should no longer walk as\nthe rest of the Gentiles walk, in the\nfutility of their mind,\nhaving their understanding darkened,\nbeing alienated from the life of God,\nbecause of the ignorance that is in them,\nbecause of the blindness of their heart;\nwho, being past feeling, have given\nthemselves over to lewdness, to work all\nuncleanness with greediness.\nBut you have not so learned Christ,\nand be renewed in the spirit of your\nmind,\nand that you put on the new man\nwhich was created according to God, in\ntrue righteousness and holiness.\nTherefore, putting away lying, \"Let\neach one of you speak truth with his\nneighbor,\" for we are members of one\nanother.\n\"Be angry, and do not sin\": do not let\nthe sun go down on your wrath,\nnor give place to the devil.\nLet him who stole steal no longer, but\nrather let him labor, working with his\nhands what is good, that he may have\nsomething to give him who has need.\nLet no corrupt word proceed out of\nyour mouth, but what is good for\nnecessary edification, that it may impart\ngrace to the hearers.\nAnd do not grieve the Holy Spirit of\nGod, by whom you were sealed for the\nday of redemption.\nLet all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor,\nand evil speaking be put away from you,\nwith all malice.\nAnd be kind to one another,\ntenderhearted, forgiving one another,\neven as God in Christ forgave you.\nfinding out what is acceptable to the\nLord.\n5Therefore be imitators of God as\ndear children.\nAnd walk in love, as Christ also has\nloved us and given Himself for us, an\noffering and a sacrifice to God for a\nsweet-smelling aroma.\nBut fornication and all uncleanness or\ncovetousness, let it not even be named\namong you, as is fitting for saints;\nneither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor\ncoarse jesting, which are not fitting, but\nrather giving of thanks.\nAnd have no fellowship with the\nunfruitful works of darkness, but rather\nexpose them.\nFor it is shameful even to speak of\nthose things which are done by them in\nsecret.\nBut all things that are exposed are\nmade manifest by the light, for whatever\nmakes manifest is light.\nTherefore He says: \"Awake, you who\nsleep, Arise from the dead, And Christ\nwill give you light.\"\nSee then that you walk circumspectly,\nnot as fools but as wise,\nFor this you know, that no fornicator,\nunclean person, nor covetous man, who\nis an idolater, has any inheritance in the\nkingdom of Christ and God.\nLet no one deceive you with empty\nwords, for because of these things the\nwrath of God comes upon the sons of\ndisobedience.\nredeeming the time, because the days\nare evil.\nTherefore do not be unwise, but\nunderstand what the will of the Lord is.\nAnd do not be drunk with wine, in\nwhich is dissipation; but be filled with the\nSpirit,\nTherefore do not be partakers with\nthem.\nFor you were once darkness, but now\nyou are light in the Lord. Walk as\nchildren of light\n(for the fruit of the Spirit is in all\ngoodness, righteousness, and truth),\nspeaking to one another in psalms and\nhymns and spiritual songs, singing and\nmaking melody in your heart to the Lord,\ngiving thanks always for all things to\nGod the Father in the name of our Lord\nJesus Christ,\nsubmitting to one another in the fear of\nGod.\nWives, submit to your own husbands,\nas to the Lord.\nFor the husband is head of the wife, as\nalso Christ is head of the church; and\nHe is the Savior of the body.\nTherefore, just as the church is subject\nto Christ, so let the wives be to their own\nhusbands in everything.\nHusbands, love your wives, just as\nChrist also loved the church and gave\nHimself for her,\nthat He might sanctify and cleanse her\nwith the washing of water by the word,\nthat He might present her to Himself a\nglorious church, not having spot or\nwrinkle or any such thing, but that she\nshould be holy and without blemish.\nSo husbands ought to love their own\nwives as their own bodies; he who loves\nhis wife loves himself.\nFor no one ever hated his own flesh,\nbut nourishes and cherishes it, just as\nthe Lord does the church.\nFor we are members of His body, of\nHis flesh and of His bones.\n\"For this reason a man shall leave his\nfather and mother and be joined to his\nwife, and the two shall become one\nflesh.\"\nThis is a great mystery, but I speak\nconcerning Christ and the church.\nNevertheless let each one of you in\nparticular so love his own wife as\nhimself, and let the wife see that she\nrespects her husband.\n6Children, obey your parents in the\nLord, for this is right.\n\"Honor your father and mother,\" which\nis the first commandment with promise:\n\"that it may be well with you and you\nmay live long on the earth.\"\nAnd you, fathers, do not provoke your\nchildren to wrath, but bring them up in\nthe training and admonition of the Lord.\nBondservants, be obedient to those\nwho are your masters according to the\nflesh, with fear and trembling, in\nsincerity of heart, as to Christ;\nnot with eyeservice, as men-pleasers,\nbut as bondservants of Christ, doing the\nwill of God from the heart,\nwith goodwill doing service, as to the\nLord, and not to men,\nknowing that whatever good anyone\ndoes, he will receive the same from the\nLord, whether he is a slave or free.\nAnd you, masters, do the same things\nto them, giving up threatening, knowing\nthat your own Master also is in heaven,\nand there is no partiality with Him.\nFinally, my brethren, be strong in the\nLord and in the power of His might.\nPut on the whole armor of God, that\nyou may be able to stand against the\nwiles of the devil.\npraying always with all prayer and\nsupplication in the Spirit, being watchful\nto this end with all perseverance and\nsupplication for all the saints--\nFor we do not wrestle against flesh\nand blood, but against principalities,\nagainst powers, against the rulers of the\ndarkness of this age, against spiritual\nhosts of wickedness in the heavenly\nplaces.\nand for me, that utterance may be\ngiven to me, that I may open my mouth\nboldly to make known the mystery of the\ngospel,\nTherefore take up the whole armor of\nGod, that you may be able to withstand\nin the evil day, and having done all, to\nstand.\nfor which I am an ambassador in\nchains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I\nought to speak.\nStand therefore, having girded your\nwaist with truth, having put on the\nbreastplate of righteousness,\nBut that you also may know my affairs\nand how I am doing, Tychicus, a\nbeloved brother and faithful minister in\nthe Lord, will make all things known to\nyou;\nand having shod your feet with the\npreparation of the gospel of peace;\nwhom I have sent to you for this very\npurpose, that you may know our affairs,\nand that he may comfort your hearts.\nabove all, taking the shield of faith with\nwhich you will be able to quench all the\nfiery darts of the wicked one.\nPeace to the brethren, and love with\nfaith, from God the Father and the Lord\nJesus Christ.\nAnd take the helmet of salvation, and\nthe sword of the Spirit, which is the word\nof God;\nGrace be with all those who love our\nLord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.\nPhilippians\n1Paul and Timothy, bondservants of\nJesus Christ, To all the saints in Christ\nJesus who are in Philippi, with the\nbishops and deacons:\nGrace to you and peace from God our\nFather and the Lord Jesus Christ.\nI thank my God\nremembrance of you,\nupon\nevery\nalways in every prayer of mine making\nrequest for you all with joy,\nfor your fellowship in the gospel from\nthe first day until now,\nbeing confident of this very thing, that\nHe who has begun a good work in you\nwill complete it until the day of Jesus\nChrist;\njust as it is right for me to think this of\nyou all, because I have you in my heart,\ninasmuch as both in my chains and in\nthe defense and confirmation of the\ngospel, you all are partakers with me of\ngrace.\nFor God is my witness, how greatly I\nlong for you all with the affection of\nJesus Christ.\nAnd this I pray, that your love may\nabound still more and more in\nknowledge and all discernment,\nthat you may approve the things that\nare excellent, that you may be sincere\nand without offense till the day of Christ,\nbeing filled with the fruits of\nrighteousness which are by Jesus Christ,\nto the glory and praise of God.\nBut I want you to know, brethren, that\nthe things which happened to me have\nactually turned out for the furtherance of\nthe gospel,\nso that it has become evident to the\nwhole palace guard, and to all the rest,\nthat my chains are in Christ;\nand most of the brethren in the Lord,\nhaving become confident by my chains,\nare much more bold to speak the word\nwithout fear.\nSome indeed preach Christ even from\nenvy and strife, and some also from\ngoodwill:\nThe former preach Christ from selfish\nambition, not sincerely, supposing to\nadd affliction to my chains;\nbut the latter out of love, knowing that I\nam appointed for the defense of the\ngospel.\nWhat then? Only that in every way,\nwhether in pretense or in truth, Christ is\npreached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and\nwill rejoice.\nFor I know that this will turn out for my\ndeliverance through your prayer and the\nsupply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,\nperdition, but to you of salvation, and\nthat from God.\naccording to my earnest expectation\nand hope that in nothing I shall be\nashamed, but with all boldness, as\nalways, so now also Christ will be\nmagnified in my body, whether by life or\nby death.\nFor to you it has been granted on\nbehalf of Christ, not only to believe in\nHim, but also to suffer for His sake,\nhaving the same conflict which you\nsaw in me and now hear is in me.\n2Therefore if there is any consolation\nin Christ, if any comfort of love, if any\nfellowship of the Spirit, if any affection\nand mercy,\nFor to me, to live is Christ, and to die\nis gain.\nBut if I live on in the flesh, this will\nmean fruit from my labor; yet what I\nshall choose I cannot tell.\nFor I am hard-pressed between the\ntwo, having a desire to depart and be\nwith Christ, which is far better.\nNevertheless to remain in the flesh is\nmore needful for you.\nAnd being confident of this, I know that\nI shall remain and continue with you all\nfor your progress and joy of faith,\nthat your rejoicing for me may be more\nabundant in Jesus Christ by my coming\nto you again.\nOnly let your conduct be worthy of the\ngospel of Christ, so that whether I come\nand see you or am absent, I may hear of\nyour affairs, that you stand fast in one\nspirit, with one mind striving together for\nthe faith of the gospel,\nand not in any way terrified by your\nadversaries, which is to them a proof of\nfulfill my joy by being like-minded,\nhaving the same love, being of one\naccord, of one mind.\nLet nothing be done through selfish\nambition or conceit, but in lowliness of\nmind let each esteem others better than\nhimself.\nLet each of you look out not only for his\nown interests, but also for the interests\nof others.\nLet this mind be in you which was also\nin Christ Jesus,\nwho, being in the form of God, did not\nconsider it robbery to be equal with God,\nbut made Himself of no reputation,\ntaking the form of a bondservant, and\ncoming in the likeness of men.\nAnd being found in appearance as a\nman, He humbled Himself and became\nobedient to the point of death, even the\ndeath of the cross.\nFor the same reason you also be glad\nand rejoice with me.\nTherefore God also has highly exalted\nHim and given Him the name which is\nabove every name,\nBut I trust in the Lord Jesus to send\nTimothy to you shortly, that I also may\nbe encouraged when I know your state.\nthat at the name of Jesus every knee\nshould bow, of those in heaven, and of\nthose on earth, and of those under the\nearth,\nand that every tongue should confess\nthat Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of\nGod the Father.\nTherefore, my beloved, as you have\nalways obeyed, not as in my presence\nonly, but now much more in my absence,\nwork out your own salvation with fear\nand trembling;\nfor it is God who works in you both to\nwill and to do for His good pleasure.\nDo all things without complaining and\ndisputing,\nthat you may become blameless and\nharmless, children of God without fault\nin the midst of a crooked and perverse\ngeneration, among whom you shine as\nlights in the world,\nFor I have no one like-minded, who\nwill sincerely care for your state.\nFor all seek their own, not the things\nwhich are of Christ Jesus.\nBut you know his proven character,\nthat as a son with his father he served\nwith me in the gospel.\nTherefore I hope to send him at once,\nas soon as I see how it goes with me.\nBut I trust in the Lord that I myself\nshall also come shortly.\nYet I considered it necessary to send\nto you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow\nworker, and fellow soldier, but your\nmessenger and the one who ministered\nto my need;\nsince he was longing for you all, and\nwas distressed because you had heard\nthat he was sick.\nholding fast the word of life, so that I\nmay rejoice in the day of Christ that I\nhave not run in vain or labored in vain.\nFor indeed he was sick almost unto\ndeath; but God had mercy on him, and\nnot only on him but on me also, lest I\nshould have sorrow upon sorrow.\nYes, and if I am being poured out as a\ndrink offering on the sacrifice and\nservice of your faith, I am glad and\nrejoice with you all.\nTherefore I sent him the more eagerly,\nthat when you see him again you may\nrejoice, and I may be less sorrowful.\nReceive him therefore in the Lord with\nall gladness, and hold such men in\nesteem;\nbecause for the work of Christ he\ncame close to death, not regarding his\nlife, to supply what was lacking in your\nservice toward me.\n3Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the\nLord. For me to write the same things to\nyou is not tedious, but for you it is safe.\nBeware of dogs, beware of evil workers,\nbeware of the mutilation!\nFor we are the circumcision, who\nworship God in the Spirit, rejoice in\nChrist Jesus, and have no confidence in\nthe flesh,\nthough I also might have confidence in\nthe flesh. If anyone else thinks he may\nhave confidence in the flesh, I more so:\ncircumcised the eighth day, of the stock\nof Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a\nHebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the\nlaw, a Pharisee;\nconcerning zeal, persecuting the\nchurch; concerning the righteousness\nwhich is in the law, blameless.\nBut what things were gain to me, these\nI have counted loss for Christ.\nYet indeed I also count all things loss\nfor the excellence of the knowledge of\nChrist Jesus my Lord, for whom I have\nsuffered the loss of all things, and count\nthem as rubbish, that I may gain Christ\nand be found in Him, not having my\nown righteousness, which is from the\nlaw, but that which is through faith in\nChrist, the righteousness which is from\nGod by faith;\nthat I may know Him and the power of\nHis resurrection, and the fellowship of\nHis sufferings, being conformed to His\ndeath,\nif, by any means, I may attain to the\nresurrection from the dead.\nNot that I have already attained, or am\nalready perfected; but I press on, that I\nmay lay hold of that for which Christ\nJesus has also laid hold of me.\nBrethren, I do not count myself to have\napprehended; but one thing I do,\nforgetting those things which are behind\nand reaching forward to those things\nwhich are ahead,\nI press toward the goal for the prize of\nthe upward call of God in Christ Jesus.\nTherefore let us, as many as are\nmature, have this mind; and if in\nanything you think otherwise, God will\nreveal even this to you.\nNevertheless, to the degree that we\nhave already attained, let us walk by the\nsame rule, let us be of the same mind.\nBrethren, join in following my example,\nand note those who so walk, as you\nhave us for a pattern.\nFor many walk, of whom I have told\nyou often, and now tell you even\nweeping, that they are the enemies of\nthe cross of Christ:\nand the peace of God, which surpasses\nall understanding, will guard your hearts\nand minds through Christ Jesus.\nwhose end is destruction, whose god\nis their belly, and whose glory is in their\nshame--who set their mind on earthly\nthings.\nFor our citizenship is in heaven, from\nwhich we also eagerly wait for the\nSavior, the Lord Jesus Christ,\nFinally, brethren, whatever things are\ntrue, whatever things are noble,\nwhatever things are just, whatever\nthings are pure, whatever things are\nlovely, whatever things are of good\nreport, if there is any virtue and if there\nis anything praiseworthy--meditate on\nthese things.\nwho will transform our lowly body that\nit may be conformed to His glorious\nbody, according to the working by which\nHe is able even to subdue all things to\nHimself.\n4Therefore, my beloved and longedfor brethren, my joy and crown, so stand\nfast in the Lord, beloved.\nI implore Euodia and I implore\nSyntyche to be of the same mind in the\nLord.\nAnd I urge you also, true companion,\nhelp these women who labored with me\nin the gospel, with Clement also, and\nthe rest of my fellow workers, whose\nnames are in the Book of Life.\nRejoice in the Lord always. Again I will\nsay, rejoice!\nLet your gentleness be known to all\nmen. The Lord is at hand.\nBe anxious for nothing, but in\neverything by prayer and supplication,\nwith thanksgiving, let your requests be\nmade known to God;\nThe things which you learned and\nreceived and heard and saw in me,\nthese do, and the God of peace will be\nwith you.\nBut I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that\nnow at last your1 care for me has\nflourished again; though you surely did\ncare, but you lacked opportunity.\nNot that I speak in regard to need, for I\nhave learned in whatever state I am, to\nbe content:\nI know how to be abased, and I know\nhow to abound. Everywhere and in all\nthings I have learned both to be full and\nto be hungry, both to abound and to\nsuffer need.\nI can do all things through Christ who\nstrengthens me.\nNevertheless you have done well that\nyou shared in my distress.\nNow you Philippians know also that in\nthe beginning of the gospel, when I\ndeparted from Macedonia, no church\nshared with me concerning giving and\nreceiving but you only.\nAnd my God shall supply all your need\naccording to His riches in glory by Christ\nJesus.\nFor even in Thessalonica you sent aid\nonce and again for my necessities.\nNow to our God and Father be glory\nforever and ever. Amen.\nNot that I seek the gift, but I seek the\nfruit that abounds to your account.\nGreet every saint in Christ Jesus. The\nbrethren who are with me greet you.\nIndeed I have all and abound.

All\nthings were created through Him and for\nHim.\nAnd He is before all things, and in Him\nall things consist.\nAnd He is the head of the body, the\nchurch, who is the beginning, the\nfirstborn from the dead, that in all things\nHe may have the preeminence.\nmystery among the Gentiles: which is\nChrist in you, the hope of glory.\nFor it pleased the Father that in Him all\nthe fullness should dwell,\nand by Him to reconcile all things to\nHimself, by Him, whether things on\nearth or things in heaven, having made\npeace through the blood of His cross.\nHim we preach, warning every man\nand teaching every man in all wisdom,\nthat we may present every man perfect\nin Christ Jesus.\nTo this end I also labor, striving\naccording to His working which works in\nme mightily.\nAnd you, who once were alienated and\nenemies in your mind by wicked works,\nyet now He has reconciled\nin the body of His flesh through death,\nto present you holy, and blameless, and\nabove reproach in His sight--\n2For I want you to know what a great\nconflict I have for you and those in\nLaodicea, and for as many as have not\nseen my face in the flesh,\nif indeed you continue in the faith,\ngrounded and steadfast, and are not\nmoved away from the hope of the\ngospel which you heard, which was\npreached to every creature under\nheaven, of which I, Paul, became a\nminister.\nI now rejoice in my sufferings for you,\nand fill up in my flesh what is lacking in\nthe afflictions of Christ, for the sake of\nHis body, which is the church,\nof which I became a minister\naccording to the stewardship from God\nwhich was given to me for you, to fulfill\nthe word of God,\nthe mystery which has been hidden\nfrom ages and from generations, but\nnow has been revealed to His saints.\nTo them God willed to make known\nwhat are the riches of the glory of this\nthat their hearts may be encouraged,\nbeing knit together in love, and attaining\nto all riches of the full assurance of\nunderstanding, to the knowledge of the\nmystery of God, both of the Father and\nof Christ,\nin whom are hidden all the treasures of\nwisdom and knowledge.\nNow this I say lest anyone should\ndeceive you with persuasive words.\nFor though I am absent in the flesh, yet\nI am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see\nyour good order and the steadfastness\nof your faith in Christ.\nAs you therefore have received Christ\nJesus the Lord, so walk in Him,\nrooted and built up in Him and\nestablished in the faith, as you have\nbeen taught, abounding in it with\nthanksgiving.\nBeware lest anyone cheat you through\nphilosophy and empty deceit, according\nto the tradition of men, according to the\nbasic principles of the world, and not\naccording to Christ.\nwhich are a shadow of things to come,\nbut the substance is of Christ.\nFor in Him dwells all the fullness of the\nGodhead bodily;\nLet no one cheat you of your reward,\ntaking delight in false humility and\nworship of angels, intruding into those\nthings which he has not seen, vainly\npuffed up by his fleshly mind,\nand you are complete in Him, who is\nthe head of all principality and power.\nIn Him you were also circumcised with\nthe circumcision made without hands,\nby putting off the body of the sins of the\nflesh, by the circumcision of Christ,\nburied with Him in baptism, in which\nyou also were raised with Him through\nfaith in the working of God, who raised\nHim from the dead.\nAnd you, being dead in your\ntrespasses and the uncircumcision of\nyour flesh, He has made alive together\nwith Him, having forgiven you all\ntrespasses,\nhaving wiped out the handwriting of\nrequirements that was against us, which\nwas contrary to us.

For you also suffered\nthe same things from your own\ncountrymen, just as they did from the\nJudeans,\nFor what is our hope, or joy, or crown\nof rejoicing? Is it not even you in the\npresence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His\ncoming?\nFor you are our glory and joy.\n3Therefore, when we could no longer\nendure it, we thought it good to be left in\nAthens alone,\nand sent Timothy, our brother and\nminister of God, and our fellow laborer\nin the gospel of Christ, to establish you\nand encourage you concerning your\nfaith,\nthat no one should be shaken by these\nafflictions; for you yourselves know that\nwe are appointed to this.\nFor, in fact, we told you before when\nwe were with you that we would suffer\ntribulation, just as it happened, and you\nknow.\nFor this reason, when I could no longer\nendure it, I sent to know your faith, lest\nby some means the tempter had\ntempted you, and our labor might be in\nvain.\nBut now that Timothy has come to us\nfrom you, and brought us good news of\nyour faith and love, and that you always\nhave good remembrance of us, greatly\ndesiring to see us, as we also to see\nyou-7\ntherefore, brethren, in all our affliction\nand distress we were comforted\nconcerning you by your faith.\nFor now we live, if you stand fast in the\nLord.\nFor what thanks can we render to God\nfor you, for all the joy with which we\nrejoice for your sake before our God,\nnight and day praying exceedingly that\nwe may see your face and perfect what\nis lacking in your faith?\nNow may our God and Father Himself,\nand our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our\nway to you.\nAnd may the Lord make you increase\nand abound in love to one another and\nto all, just as we do to you,\nso that He may establish your hearts\nblameless in holiness before our God\nand Father at the coming of our Lord\nJesus Christ with all His saints.\n4Finally then, brethren, we urge and\nexhort in the Lord Jesus that you should\nabound more and more, just as you\nreceived from us how you ought to walk\nand to please God;\nfor you know what commandments we\ngave you through the Lord Jesus.\nFor this is the will of God, your\nsanctification: that you should abstain\nfrom sexual immorality;\nthat each of you should know how to\npossess his own vessel in sanctification\nand honor,\nnot in passion of lust, like the Gentiles\nwho do not know God;\nthat no one should take advantage of\nand defraud his brother in this matter,\nbecause the Lord is the avenger of all\nsuch, as we also forewarned you and\ntestified.\nFor God did not call us to uncleanness,\nbut in holiness.\nTherefore he who rejects this does not\nreject man, but God, who has also given\nus His Holy Spirit.\nBut concerning brotherly love you have\nno need that I should write to you, for\nyou yourselves are taught by God to\nlove one another;\nand indeed you do so toward all the\nbrethren who are in all Macedonia. But\nwe urge you, brethren, that you increase\nmore and more;\nthat you also aspire to lead a quiet life,\nto mind your own business, and to work\nwith your own hands, as we\ncommanded you,\nthat you may walk properly toward\nthose who are outside, and that you\nmay lack nothing.\nBut I do not want you to be ignorant,\nbrethren, concerning those who have\nfallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others\nwho have no hope.\nFor if we believe that Jesus died and\nrose again, even so God will bring with\nHim those who sleep in Jesus.\nFor this we say to you by the word of\nthe Lord, that we who are alive and\nremain until the coming of the Lord will\nby no means precede those who are\nasleep.\nFor the Lord Himself will descend from\nheaven with a shout, with the voice of\nan archangel, and with the trumpet of\nGod. And the dead in Christ will rise first.\nThen we who are alive and remain\nshall be caught up together with them in\nthe clouds to meet the Lord in the air.\nAnd thus we shall always be with the\nLord.\nTherefore comfort one another with\nthese words.\n5But concerning the times and the\nseasons, brethren, you have no need\nthat I should write to you.\nFor you yourselves know perfectly that\nthe day of the Lord so comes as a thief\nin the night.\nFor when they say, \"Peace and safety!\"\nthen sudden destruction comes upon\nthem, as labor pains upon a pregnant\nwoman. And they shall not escape.\nBut you, brethren, are not in darkness,\nso that this Day should overtake you as\na thief.\nYou are all sons of light and sons of the\nday. We are not of the night nor of\ndarkness.\nTherefore let us not sleep, as others do,\nbut let us watch and be sober.\nFor those who sleep, sleep at night,\nand those who get drunk are drunk at\nnight.\nBut let us who are of the day be sober,\nputting on the breastplate of faith and\nlove, and as a helmet the hope of\nsalvation.\nFor God did not appoint us to wrath, but\nto obtain salvation through our Lord\nJesus Christ,\nwho died for us, that whether we wake\nor sleep, we should live together with\nHim.\nTherefore comfort each other and\nedify one another, just as you also are\ndoing.\nAnd we urge you, brethren, to\nrecognize those who labor among you,\nand are over you in the Lord and\nadmonish you,\nand to esteem them very highly in love\nfor their work's sake. Be at peace\namong yourselves.\nNow we exhort you, brethren, warn\nthose who are unruly, comfort the\nfainthearted, uphold the weak, be\npatient with all.\nSee that no one renders evil for evil to\nanyone, but always pursue what is good\nboth for yourselves and for all.\nRejoice always,\nDo not quench the Spirit.\nDo not despise prophecies.\nTest all things; hold fast what is good.\nAbstain from every form of evil.\nNow may the God of peace Himself\nsanctify you completely; and may your\nwhole spirit, soul, and body be\npreserved blameless at the coming of\nour Lord Jesus Christ.\nHe who calls you is faithful, who also\nwill do it.\nBrethren, pray for us.\nGreet all the brethren with a holy kiss.\nI charge you by the Lord that this\nepistle be read to all the holy brethren.\npray without ceasing,\nin everything give thanks; for this is the\nwill of God in Christ Jesus for you.\nThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be\nwith you.

only He who now\nrestrains will do so until He is taken out\nof the way.\nNow may our Lord Jesus Christ\nHimself, and our God and Father, who\nhas loved us and given us everlasting\nconsolation and good hope by grace,\ncomfort your hearts and establish you\nin every good word and work.\nAnd then the lawless one will be\nrevealed, whom the Lord will consume\nwith the breath of His mouth and destroy\nwith the brightness of His coming.\nThe coming of the lawless one is\naccording to the working of Satan, with\nall power, signs, and lying wonders,\nand with all unrighteous deception\namong those who perish, because they\ndid not receive the love of the truth, that\nthey might be saved.\nAnd for this reason God will send them\nstrong delusion, that they should believe\nthe lie,\nthat they all may be condemned who\ndid not believe the truth but had\npleasure in unrighteousness.\nBut we are bound to give thanks to\nGod always for you, brethren beloved by\nthe Lord, because God from the\nbeginning chose you for salvation\nthrough sanctification by the Spirit and\nbelief in the truth,\nto which He called you by our gospel,\nfor the obtaining of the glory of our Lord\nJesus Christ.\n3Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the\nword of the Lord may run swiftly and be\nglorified, just as it is with you,\nand that we may be delivered from\nunreasonable and wicked men; for not\nall have faith.\nBut the Lord is faithful, who will\nestablish you and guard you from the\nevil one.\nAnd we have confidence in the Lord\nconcerning you, both that you do and\nwill do the things we command you.\nNow may the Lord direct your hearts\ninto the love of God and into the\npatience of Christ.\nBut we command you, brethren, in the\nname of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you\nwithdraw from every brother who walks\ndisorderly and not according to the\ntradition which he received from us.\nFor you yourselves know how you\nought to follow us, for we were not\ndisorderly among you;\nnor did we eat anyone's bread free of\ncharge, but worked with labor and toil\nnight and day, that we might not be a\nburden to any of you,\nnot because we do not have authority,\nbut to make ourselves an example of\nhow you should follow us.\nBut as for you, brethren, do not grow\nweary in doing good.\nAnd if anyone does not obey our word\nin this epistle, note that person and do\nnot keep company with him, that he may\nbe ashamed.\nFor even when we were with you, we\ncommanded you this: If anyone will not\nwork, neither shall he eat.\nFor we hear that there are some who\nwalk among you in a disorderly manner,\nnot working at all, but are busybodies.\nNow those who are such we command\nand exhort through our Lord Jesus\nChrist that they work in quietness and\neat their own bread.\nYet do not count him as an enemy, but\nadmonish him as a brother.\nNow may the Lord of peace Himself\ngive you peace always in every way.\nThe Lord be with you all.\nThe salutation of Paul with my own\nhand, which is a sign in every epistle;

And again: \"I will be to\nHim a Father, And He shall be to Me a\nSon\"?\nBut when He again brings the firstborn\ninto the world, He says: \"Let all the\nangels of God worship Him.\"\nAre they not all ministering spirits sent\nforth to minister for those who will inherit\nsalvation?\n2Therefore we must give the more\nearnest heed to the things we have\nheard, lest we drift away.\nAnd of the angels He says: \"Who\nmakes His angels spirits And His\nministers a flame of fire.\"\nFor if the word spoken through angels\nproved\nsteadfast,\nand\nevery\ntransgression\nand\ndisobedience\nreceived a just reward,\nBut to the Son He says: \"Your throne,\nO God, is forever and ever; A scepter of\nhow shall we escape if we neglect so\ngreat a salvation, which at the first\nbegan to be spoken by the Lord, and\nwas confirmed to us by those who heard\nHim,\nfor which reason He is not ashamed to\ncall them brethren,\nGod also bearing witness both with\nsigns and wonders, with various\nmiracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit,\naccording to His own will?\nFor He has not put the world to come,\nof which we speak, in subjection to\nangels.\nsaying: \"I will declare Your name to My\nbrethren; In the midst of the assembly I\nwill sing praise to You.\"\nAnd again: \"I will put My trust in Him.\"\nAnd again: \"Here am I and the children\nwhom God has given Me.\"\nBut one testified in a certain place,\nsaying: \"What is man that You are\nmindful of him, Or the son of man that\nYou take care of him?\nInasmuch then as the children have\npartaken of flesh and blood, He Himself\nlikewise shared in the same, that\nthrough death He might destroy him\nwho had the power of death, that is, the\ndevil,\nYou have made him a little lower than\nthe angels; You have crowned him with\nglory and honor, And set him over the\nworks of Your hands.\nand release those who through fear of\ndeath were all their lifetime subject to\nbondage.\nYou have put all things in subjection\nunder his feet.\" For in that He put all in\nsubjection under him, He left nothing\nthat is not put under him. But now we do\nnot yet see all things put under him.\nBut we see Jesus, who was made a\nlittle lower than the angels, for the\nsuffering of death crowned with glory\nand honor, that He, by the grace of God,\nmight taste death for everyone.\nFor it was fitting for Him, for whom are\nall things and by whom are all things, in\nbringing many sons to glory, to make\nthe captain of their salvation perfect\nthrough sufferings.\nFor both He who sanctifies and those\nwho are being sanctified are all of one,\nFor indeed He does not give aid to\nangels, but He does give aid to the seed\nof Abraham.\nTherefore, in all things He had to be\nmade like His brethren, that He might be\na merciful and faithful High Priest in\nthings pertaining to God, to make\npropitiation for the sins of the people.\nFor in that He Himself has suffered,\nbeing tempted, He is able to aid those\nwho are tempted.\n3Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of\nthe heavenly calling, consider\nApostle and High Priest of\nconfession, Christ Jesus,\nthe\nour\nwho was faithful to Him who appointed\nHim, as Moses also was faithful in all\nHis house.\nbut exhort one another daily, while it is\ncalled \"Today,\" lest any of you be\nhardened through the deceitfulness of\nsin.\nFor this One has been counted worthy\nof more glory than Moses, inasmuch as\nHe who built the house has more honor\nthan the house.\nFor we have become partakers of\nChrist if we hold the beginning of our\nconfidence steadfast to the end,\nFor every house is built by someone,\nbut He who built all things is God.\nwhile it is said: \"Today, if you will hear\nHis voice, Do not harden your hearts as\nin the rebellion.\"\nAnd Moses indeed was faithful in all His\nhouse as a servant, for a testimony of\nthose things which would be spoken\nafterward,\nFor who, having heard, rebelled?\nIndeed, was it not all who came out of\nEgypt, led by Moses?\nbut Christ as a Son over His own house,\nwhose house we are if we hold fast the\nconfidence and the rejoicing of the hope\nfirm to the end.\nNow with whom was He angry forty\nyears? Was it not with those who sinned,\nwhose corpses fell in the wilderness?\nTherefore, as the Holy Spirit says:\n\"Today, if you will hear His voice,\nAnd to whom did He swear that they\nwould not enter His rest, but to those\nwho did not obey?\nDo not harden your hearts as in the\nrebellion, In the day of trial in the\nwilderness,\nWhere your fathers tested Me, tried Me,\nAnd saw My works forty years.\nTherefore I was angry with that\ngeneration, And said, \"They always go\nastray in their heart, And they have not\nknown My ways.'\nSo I swore in My wrath, \"They shall not\nenter My rest.\"'\nSo we see that they could not enter in\nbecause of unbelief.\n4Therefore, since a promise remains\nof entering His rest, let us fear lest any\nof you seem to have come short of it.\nFor indeed the gospel was preached to\nus as well as to them; but the word\nwhich they heard did not profit them, not\nbeing mixed with faith in those who\nheard it.\nBeware, brethren, lest there be in any\nof you an evil heart of unbelief in\ndeparting from the living God;\nFor we who have believed do enter that\nrest, as He has said: \"So I swore in My\nwrath, \"They shall not enter My rest,\"'\nalthough the works were finished from\nthe foundation of the world.\nFor He has spoken in a certain place of\nthe seventh day in this way: \"And God\nrested on the seventh day from all His\nworks\";\nand again in this place: \"They shall not\nenter My rest.\"\nSince therefore it remains that some\nmust enter it, and those to whom it was\nfirst preached did not enter because of\ndisobedience,\nagain He designates a certain day,\nsaying in David, \"Today,\" after such a\nlong time, as it has been said: \"Today, if\nyou will hear His voice, Do not harden\nyour hearts.\"\nFor if Joshua had given them rest, then\nHe would not afterward have spoken of\nanother day.\nThere remains therefore a rest for the\npeople of God.\nFor he who has entered His rest has\nhimself also ceased from his works as\nGod did from His.\nLet us therefore be diligent to enter\nthat rest, lest anyone fall according to\nthe same example of disobedience.\nFor the word of God is living and\npowerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the\ndivision of soul and spirit, and of joints\nand marrow, and is a discerner of the\nthoughts and intents of the heart.\nAnd there is no creature hidden from\nHis sight, but all things are naked and\nopen to the eyes of Him to whom we\nmust give account.\nSeeing then that we have a great High\nPriest who has passed through the\nheavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us\nhold fast our confession.\nFor we do not have a High Priest who\ncannot sympathize with our weaknesses,\nbut was in all points tempted as we are,\nyet without sin.\nLet us therefore come boldly to the\nthrone of grace, that we may obtain\nmercy and find grace to help in time of\nneed.\n5For every high priest taken from\namong men is appointed for men in\nthings pertaining to God, that he may\noffer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.\nHe can have compassion on those who\nare ignorant and going astray, since he\nhimself is also subject to weakness.\nBecause of this he is required as for the\npeople, so also for himself, to offer\nsacrifices for sins.\nAnd no man takes this honor to himself,\nbut he who is called by God, just as\nAaron was.\nSo also Christ did not glorify Himself to\nbecome High Priest, but it was He who\nsaid to Him: \"You are My Son, Today I\nhave begotten You.\"\nAs He also says in another place: \"You\nare a priest forever According to the\norder of Melchizedek\";\nwho, in the days of His flesh, when He\nhad\noffered\nup\nprayers\nand\nsupplications, with vehement cries and\ntears to Him who was able to save Him\nfrom death, and was heard because of\nHis godly fear,\nthough He was a Son, yet He learned\nobedience by the things which He\nsuffered.\nAnd having been perfected, He became\nthe author of eternal salvation to all who\nobey Him,\ncalled by God as High Priest\n\"according to the order of Melchizedek,\"\nof whom we have much to say, and\nhard to explain, since you have become\ndull of hearing.\nFor though by this time you ought to\nbe teachers, you need someone to\nteach you again the first principles of the\noracles of God; and you have come to\nneed milk and not solid food.\nFor everyone who partakes only of\nmilk is unskilled in the word of\nrighteousness, for he is a babe.\nBut solid food belongs to those who\nare of full age, that is, those who by\nreason of use have their senses\nexercised to discern both good and evil.\n6Therefore, leaving the discussion of\nthe elementary principles of Christ, let\nus go on to perfection, not laying again\nthe foundation of repentance from dead\nworks and of faith toward God,\nof the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on\nof hands, of resurrection of the dead,\nand of eternal judgment.\nAnd this we will do if God permits.\nFor it is impossible for those who were\nonce enlightened, and have tasted the\nheavenly gift, and have become\npartakers of the Holy Spirit,\nand have tasted the good word of God\nand the powers of the age to come,\nif they fall away, to renew them again to\nrepentance, since they crucify again for\nthemselves the Son of God, and put\nHim to an open shame.\nFor the earth which drinks in the rain\nthat often comes upon it, and bears\nherbs useful for those by whom it is\ncultivated, receives blessing from God;\nbut if it bears thorns and briers, it is\nrejected and near to being cursed,\nwhose end is to be burned.\nBut, beloved, we are confident of better\nthings concerning you, yes, things that\naccompany salvation, though we speak\nin this manner.\nFor God is not unjust to forget your\nwork and labor of love which you have\nshown toward His name, in that you\nhave ministered to the saints, and do\nminister.\nPriest forever according to the order of\nMelchizedek.\n7For this Melchizedek, king of Salem,\nAnd we desire that each one of you\nshow the same diligence to the full\nassurance of hope until the end,\nthat you do not become sluggish, but\nimitate those who through faith and\npatience inherit the promises.\nFor when God made a promise to\nAbraham, because He could swear by\nno one greater, He swore by Himself,\npriest of the Most High God, who met\nAbraham returning from the slaughter of\nthe kings and blessed him,\nto whom also Abraham gave a tenth\npart of all, first being translated \"king of\nrighteousness,\" and then also king of\nSalem, meaning \"king of peace,\"\nsaying, \"Surely blessing I will bless\nyou, and multiplying I will multiply you.\"\nAnd so, after he had patiently endured,\nhe obtained the promise.\nFor men indeed swear by the greater,\nand an oath for confirmation is for them\nan end of all dispute.\nwithout father, without mother, without\ngenealogy, having neither beginning of\ndays nor end of life, but made like the\nSon of God, remains a priest continually.\nNow consider how great this man was,\nto whom even the patriarch Abraham\ngave a tenth of the spoils.\nThus God, determining to show more\nabundantly to the heirs of promise the\nimmutability of His counsel, confirmed it\nby an oath,\nAnd indeed those who are of the sons\nof Levi, who receive the priesthood,\nhave a commandment to receive tithes\nfrom the people according to the law,\nthat is, from their brethren, though they\nhave come from the loins of Abraham;\nthat by two immutable things, in which\nit is impossible for God to lie, we might\nhave strong consolation, who have fled\nfor refuge to lay hold of the hope set\nbefore us.\nThis hope we have as an anchor of the\nsoul, both sure and steadfast, and which\nenters the Presence behind the veil,\nwhere the forerunner has entered for\nus, even Jesus, having become High\nbut he whose genealogy is not derived\nfrom them received tithes from Abraham\nand blessed him who had the promises.\nNow beyond all contradiction the lesser\nis blessed by the better.\nHere mortal men receive tithes, but\nthere he receives them, of whom it is\nwitnessed that he lives.\nEven Levi, who receives tithes, paid\ntithes through Abraham, so to speak,\nfor he was still in the loins of his father\nwhen Melchizedek met him.\na better hope, through which we draw\nnear to God.\nTherefore, if perfection were through\nthe Levitical priesthood (for under it the\npeople received the law), what further\nneed was there that another priest\nshould rise according to the order of\nMelchizedek, and not be called\naccording to the order of Aaron?\nFor the priesthood being changed, of\nnecessity there is also a change of the\nlaw.\nFor He of whom these things are\nspoken belongs to another tribe, from\nwhich no man has officiated at the altar.\nAnd inasmuch as He was not made\npriest without an oath\n(for they have become priests without\nan oath, but He with an oath by Him\nwho said to Him: \"The LORD has sworn\nAnd will not relent, \"You are a priest\nforever According to the order of\nMelchizedek\"'),\nby so much more Jesus has become a\nsurety of a better covenant.\nAlso there were many priests, because\nthey were prevented by death from\ncontinuing.\nFor it is evident that our Lord arose\nfrom Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke\nnothing concerning priesthood.\nBut He, because He continues forever,\nhas an unchangeable priesthood.\nAnd it is yet far more evident if, in the\nlikeness of Melchizedek, there arises\nanother priest\nwho has come, not according to the\nlaw of a fleshly commandment, but\naccording to the power of an endless life.\nFor He testifies: \"You are a priest\nforever According to the order of\nMelchizedek.\"\nFor on the one hand there is an\nannulling of the former commandment\nbecause\nof\nits\nweakness\nand\nunprofitableness,\nTherefore He is also able to save to\nthe uttermost those who come to God\nthrough Him, since He always lives to\nmake intercession for them.\nFor such a High Priest was fitting for\nus, who is holy, harmless, undefiled,\nseparate from sinners, and has become\nhigher than the heavens;\nwho does not need daily, as those\nhigh priests, to offer up sacrifices, first\nfor His own sins and then for the\npeople's, for this He did once for all\nwhen He offered up Himself.\nfor the law made nothing perfect; on\nthe other hand, there is the bringing in of\nFor the law appoints as high priests\nmen who have weakness, but the word\nof the oath, which came after the law,\nappoints the Son\nperfected forever.\nwho\nhas\nbeen\n8Now this is the main point of the\nthings we are saying: We have such a\nHigh Priest, who is seated at the right\nhand of the throne of the Majesty in the\nheavens,\na Minister of the sanctuary and of the\ntrue tabernacle which the Lord erected,\nand not man.\nFor every high priest is appointed to\noffer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore\nit is necessary that this One also have\nsomething to offer.\nFor if He were on earth, He would not\nbe a priest, since there are priests who\noffer the gifts according to the law;\nwho serve the copy and shadow of the\nheavenly things, as Moses was divinely\ninstructed when he was about to make\nthe tabernacle. For He said, \"See that\nyou make all things according to the\npattern shown you on the mountain.\"\nBut now He has obtained a more\nexcellent ministry, inasmuch as He is\nalso Mediator of a better covenant,\nwhich was established on better\npromises.\ncovenant with the house of Israel and\nwith the house of Judah-9\nnot according to the covenant that I\nmade with their fathers in the day when I\ntook them by the hand to lead them out\nof the land of Egypt; because they did\nnot continue in My covenant, and I\ndisregarded them, says the LORD.\nFor this is the covenant that I will make\nwith the house of Israel after those days,\nsays the LORD: I will put My laws in\ntheir mind and write them on their\nhearts; and I will be their God, and they\nshall be My people.\nNone of them shall teach his neighbor,\nand none his brother, saying, \"Know the\nLORD,' for all shall know Me, from the\nleast of them to the greatest of them.\nFor I will be merciful to their\nunrighteousness, and their sins and\ntheir lawless deeds I will remember no\nmore.\"\nIn that He says, \"A new covenant,\" He\nhas made the first obsolete. Now what is\nbecoming obsolete and growing old is\nready to vanish away.\n9Then indeed, even the first covenant\nhad ordinances of divine service and the\nearthly sanctuary.\nFor if that first covenant had been\nfaultless, then no place would have\nbeen sought for a second.\nBecause finding fault with them, He\nsays: \"Behold, the days are coming,\nsays the LORD, when I will make a new\nFor a tabernacle was prepared: the first\npart, in which was the lampstand, the\ntable, and the showbread, which is\ncalled the sanctuary;\nand behind the second veil, the part of\nthe tabernacle which is called the\nHoliest of All,\nand more perfect tabernacle not made\nwith hands, that is, not of this creation.\nwhich had the golden censer and the\nark of the covenant overlaid on all sides\nwith gold, in which were the golden pot\nthat had the manna, Aaron's rod that\nbudded, and the tablets of the covenant;\nand above it were the cherubim of glory\novershadowing the mercy seat. Of these\nthings we cannot now speak in detail.\nNot with the blood of goats and calves,\nbut with His own blood He entered the\nMost Holy Place once for all, having\nobtained eternal redemption.\nFor if the blood of bulls and goats and\nthe ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the\nunclean, sanctifies for the purifying of\nthe flesh,\nNow when these things had been thus\nprepared, the priests always went into\nthe first part of the tabernacle,\nperforming the services.\nhow much more shall the blood of\nChrist, who through the eternal Spirit\noffered Himself without spot to God,\ncleanse your conscience from dead\nworks to serve the living God?\nBut into the second part the high priest\nwent alone once a year, not without\nblood, which he offered for himself and\nfor the people's sins committed in\nignorance;\nAnd for this reason He is the Mediator\nof the new covenant, by means of death,\nfor the redemption of the transgressions\nunder the first covenant, that those who\nare called may receive the promise of\nthe eternal inheritance.\nthe Holy Spirit indicating this, that the\nway into the Holiest of All was not yet\nmade manifest while the first tabernacle\nwas still standing.\nFor where there is a testament, there\nmust also of necessity be the death of\nthe testator.\nIt was symbolic for the present time in\nwhich both gifts and sacrifices are\noffered which cannot make him who\nperformed the service perfect in regard\nto the conscience-10\nconcerned only with foods and drinks,\nvarious\nwashings,\nand\nfleshly\nordinances imposed until the time of\nreformation.\nBut Christ came as High Priest of the\ngood things to come, with the greater\nFor a testament is in force after men\nare dead, since it has no power at all\nwhile the testator lives.\nTherefore not even the first covenant\nwas dedicated without blood.\nFor when Moses had spoken every\nprecept to all the people according to\nthe law, he took the blood of calves and\ngoats, with water, scarlet wool, and\nhyssop, and sprinkled both the book\nitself and all the people,\nsaying, \"This is the blood of the\ncovenant which God has commanded\nyou.\"\n10For the law, having a shadow of\nThen likewise he sprinkled with blood\nboth the tabernacle and all the vessels\nof the ministry.\nthe good things to come, and not the\nvery image of the things, can never with\nthese same sacrifices, which they offer\ncontinually year by year, make those\nwho approach perfect.\nAnd according to the law almost all\nthings are purified with blood, and\nwithout shedding of blood there is no\nremission.\nFor then would they not have ceased to\nbe offered? For the worshipers, once\npurified, would have had no more\nconsciousness of sins.\nTherefore it was necessary that the\ncopies of the things in the heavens\nshould be purified with these, but the\nheavenly things themselves with better\nsacrifices than these.\nFor Christ has not entered the holy\nplaces made with hands, which are\ncopies of the true, but into heaven itself,\nnow to appear in the presence of God\nfor us;\nnot that He should offer Himself often,\nas the high priest enters the Most Holy\nPlace every year with blood of another-26\nHe then would have had to suffer often\nsince the foundation of the world; but\nnow, once at the end of the ages, He\nhas appeared to put away sin by the\nsacrifice of Himself.\nAnd as it is appointed for men to die\nonce, but after this the judgment,\nso Christ was offered once to bear the\nsins of many. To those who eagerly wait\nfor Him He will appear a second time,\napart from sin, for salvation.\nBut in those sacrifices there is a\nreminder of sins every year.\nFor it is not possible that the blood of\nbulls and goats could take away sins.\nTherefore, when He came into the\nworld, He said: \"Sacrifice and offering\nYou did not desire, But a body You have\nprepared for Me.\nIn burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin\nYou had no pleasure.\nThen I said, \"Behold, I have come-- In\nthe volume of the book it is written of\nMe-- To do Your will, O God.\"'\nPreviously saying, \"Sacrifice and\noffering, burnt offerings, and offerings\nfor sin You did not desire, nor had\npleasure in them\" (which are offered\naccording to the law),\nthen He said, \"Behold, I have come to\ndo Your will, O God.\" He takes away the\nfirst that He may establish the second.\nBy that will we have been sanctified\nthrough the offering of the body of Jesus\nChrist once for all.\nand having a High Priest over the\nhouse of God,\nAnd every priest stands ministering\ndaily and offering repeatedly the same\nsacrifices, which can never take away\nsins.\nlet us draw near with a true heart in full\nassurance of faith, having our hearts\nsprinkled from an evil conscience and\nour bodies washed with pure water.\nBut this Man, after He had offered one\nsacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the\nright hand of God,\nLet us hold fast the confession of our\nhope without wavering, for He who\npromised is faithful.\nfrom that time waiting till His enemies\nare made His footstool.\nAnd let us consider one another in\norder to stir up love and good works,\nFor by one offering He has perfected\nforever those who are being sanctified.\nBut the Holy Spirit also witnesses to\nus; for after He had said before,\n\"This is the covenant that I will make\nwith them after those days, says the\nLORD: I will put My laws into their\nhearts, and in their minds I will write\nthem,\"\nthen He adds, \"Their sins and their\nlawless deeds I will remember no more.\"\nnot forsaking the assembling of\nourselves together, as is the manner of\nsome, but exhorting one another, and so\nmuch the more as you see the Day\napproaching.\nFor if we sin willfully after we have\nreceived the knowledge of the truth,\nthere no longer remains a sacrifice for\nsins,\nbut a certain fearful expectation of\njudgment, and fiery indignation which\nwill devour the adversaries.\nNow where there is remission of these,\nthere is no longer an offering for sin.\nAnyone who has rejected Moses' law\ndies without mercy on the testimony of\ntwo or three witnesses.\nTherefore, brethren, having boldness\nto enter the Holiest by the blood of\nJesus,\nby a new and living way which He\nconsecrated for us, through the veil, that\nis, His flesh,\nOf how much worse punishment, do\nyou suppose, will he be thought worthy\nwho has trampled the Son of God\nunderfoot, counted the blood of the\ncovenant by which he was sanctified a\ncommon thing, and insulted the Spirit of\ngrace?\nFor we know Him who said,\n\"Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,\" says\nthe Lord. And again, \"The LORD will\njudge His people.\"\nIt is a fearful thing to fall into the hands\nof the living God.\nBut recall the former days in which,\nafter you were illuminated, you endured\na great struggle with sufferings:\npartly while you were made a\nspectacle both by reproaches and\ntribulations, and partly while you\nbecame companions of those who were\nso treated;\nfor you had compassion on me in my\nchains, and joyfully accepted the\nplundering of your goods, knowing that\nyou have a better and an enduring\npossession for yourselves in heaven.\nTherefore do not cast away your\nconfidence, which has great reward.\n11Now faith is the substance of\nthings hoped for, the evidence of things\nnot seen.\nFor by it the elders obtained a good\ntestimony.\nBy faith we understand that the worlds\nwere framed by the word of God, so that\nthe things which are seen were not\nmade of things which are visible.\nBy faith Abel offered to God a more\nexcellent sacrifice than Cain, through\nwhich he obtained witness that he was\nrighteous, God testifying of his gifts; and\nthrough it he being dead still speaks.\nBy faith Enoch was taken away so that\nhe did not see death, \"and was not\nfound, because God had taken him\"; for\nbefore he was taken he had this\ntestimony, that he pleased God.\nFor you have need of endurance, so\nthat after you have done the will of God,\nyou may receive the promise:\nBut without faith it is impossible to\nplease Him, for he who comes to God\nmust believe that He is, and that He is a\nrewarder of those who diligently seek\nHim.\n\"For yet a little while, And He who is\ncoming will come and will not tarry.\nNow the just shall live by faith; But if\nanyone draws back, My soul has no\npleasure in him.\"\nBy faith Noah, being divinely warned of\nthings not yet seen, moved with godly\nfear, prepared an ark for the saving of\nhis household, by which he condemned\nthe world and became heir of the\nrighteousness which is according to faith.\nBut we are not of those who draw back\nto perdition, but of those who believe to\nthe saving of the soul.\nBy faith Abraham obeyed when he was\ncalled to go out to the place which he\nwould receive as an inheritance. And he\nwent out, not knowing where he was\ngoing.\nBy faith he dwelt in the land of promise\nas in a foreign country, dwelling in tents\nwith Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him\nof the same promise;\nfor he waited for the city which has\nfoundations, whose builder and maker is\nGod.\nBy faith Sarah herself also received\nstrength to conceive seed, and she bore\na child when she was past the age,\nbecause she judged Him faithful who\nhad promised.\nreceived the promises offered up his\nonly begotten son,\nof whom it was said, \"In Isaac your\nseed shall be called,\"\nconcluding that God was able to raise\nhim up, even from the dead, from which\nhe also received him in a figurative\nsense.\nBy faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau\nconcerning things to come.\nTherefore from one man, and him as\ngood as dead, were born as many as\nthe stars of the sky in multitude-innumerable as the sand which is by the\nseashore.\nThese all died in faith, not having\nreceived the promises, but having seen\nthem afar off were assured of them,\nembraced them and confessed that they\nwere strangers and pilgrims on the earth.\nFor those who say such things declare\nplainly that they seek a homeland.\nBy faith Jacob, when he was dying,\nblessed each of the sons of Joseph, and\nworshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.\nBy faith Joseph, when he was dying,\nmade mention of the departure of the\nchildren of Israel, and gave instructions\nconcerning his bones.\nBy faith Moses, when he was born,\nwas hidden three months by his parents,\nbecause they saw he was a beautiful\nchild; and they were not afraid of the\nking's command.\nAnd truly if they had called to mind that\ncountry from which they had come out,\nthey would have had opportunity to\nreturn.\nBut now they desire a better, that is, a\nheavenly country. Therefore God is not\nashamed to be called their God, for He\nhas prepared a city for them.\nBy faith Abraham, when he was tested,\noffered up Isaac, and he who had\nBy faith Moses, when he became of\nage, refused to be called the son of\nPharaoh's daughter,\nchoosing rather to suffer affliction with\nthe people of God than to enjoy the\npassing pleasures of sin,\nesteeming the reproach of Christ\ngreater riches than the treasures in\nEgypt; for he looked to the reward.\nBy faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing\nthe wrath of the king; for he endured as\nseeing Him who is invisible.\nStill others had trial of mockings and\nscourgings, yes, and of chains and\nimprisonment.\nBy faith he kept the Passover and the\nsprinkling of blood, lest he who\ndestroyed the firstborn should touch\nthem.\nThey were stoned, they were sawn in\ntwo, were tempted, were slain with the\nsword.

So the rich man also will fade\naway in his pursuits.\nBlessed is the man who endures\ntemptation; for when he has been\napproved, he will receive the crown of\nlife which the Lord has promised to\nthose who love Him.\nLet no one say when he is tempted, \"I\nam tempted by God\"; for God cannot be\ntempted by evil, nor does He Himself\ntempt anyone.\nIf any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask\nof God, who gives to all liberally and\nwithout reproach, and it will be given to\nhim.\nBut let him ask in faith, with no doubting,\nfor he who doubts is like a wave of the\nsea driven and tossed by the wind.\nFor let not that man suppose that he\nwill receive anything from the Lord;\nBut each one is tempted when he is\ndrawn away by his own desires and\nenticed.\nThen, when desire has conceived, it\ngives birth to sin; and sin, when it is fullgrown, brings forth death.\nDo not be deceived, my beloved\nbrethren.\nhe is a double-minded man, unstable in\nall his ways.\nEvery good gift and every perfect gift\nis from above, and comes down from\nthe Father of lights, with whom there is\nno variation or shadow of turning.\nLet the lowly brother glory in his\nexaltation,\nbut the rich in his humiliation, because\nas a flower of the field he will pass away.\nOf His own will He brought us forth by\nthe word of truth, that we might be a\nkind of firstfruits of His creatures.\nSo then, my beloved brethren, let\nevery man be swift to hear, slow to\nspeak, slow to wrath;\nfor the wrath of man does not produce\nthe righteousness of God.\nTherefore lay aside all filthiness and\noverflow of wickedness, and receive\nwith meekness the implanted word,\nwhich is able to save your souls.\nBut be doers of the word, and not\nhearers only, deceiving yourselves.\nFor if anyone is a hearer of the word\nand not a doer, he is like a man\nobserving his natural face in a mirror;\nand you pay attention to the one\nwearing the fine clothes and say to him,\n\"You sit here in a good place,\" and say\nto the poor man, \"You stand there,\" or,\n\"Sit here at my footstool,\"\nhave you not shown partiality among\nyourselves, and become judges with evil\nthoughts?\nListen, my beloved brethren: Has God\nnot chosen the poor of this world to be\nrich in faith and heirs of the kingdom\nwhich He promised to those who love\nHim?\nfor he observes himself, goes away,\nand immediately forgets what kind of\nman he was.\nBut you have dishonored the poor man.\nDo not the rich oppress you and drag\nyou into the courts?\nBut he who looks into the perfect law\nof liberty and continues in it, and is not a\nforgetful hearer but a doer of the work,\nthis one will be blessed in what he does.\nIf anyone among you thinks he is\nreligious, and does not bridle his tongue\nbut deceives his own heart, this one's\nreligion is useless.\nPure and undefiled religion before God\nand the Father is this: to visit orphans\nand widows in their trouble, and to keep\noneself unspotted from the world.\n2My brethren, do not hold the faith of\nour Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory,\nwith partiality.\nFor if there should come into your\nassembly a man with gold rings, in fine\napparel, and there should also come in\na poor man in filthy clothes,\nDo they not blaspheme that noble\nname by which you are called?\nIf you really fulfill the royal law\naccording to the Scripture, \"You shall\nlove your neighbor as yourself,\" you do\nwell;\nbut if you show partiality, you commit\nsin, and are convicted by the law as\ntransgressors.\nFor whoever shall keep the whole law,\nand yet stumble in one point, he is guilty\nof all.\nFor He who said, \"Do not commit\nadultery,\" also said, \"Do not murder.\"\nNow if you do not commit adultery, but\nyou do murder, you have become a\ntransgressor of the law.\nSo speak and so do as those who will\nbe judged by the law of liberty.\nFor judgment is without mercy to the\none who has shown no mercy. Mercy\ntriumphs over judgment.\nWhat does it profit, my brethren, if\nsomeone says he has faith but does not\nhave works? Can faith save him?\nAnd the Scripture was fulfilled which\nsays, \"Abraham believed God, and it\nwas\naccounted\nto\nhim\nfor\nrighteousness.\" And he was called the\nfriend of God.\nYou see then that a man is justified by\nworks, and not by faith only.\nIf a brother or sister is naked and\ndestitute of daily food,\nLikewise, was not Rahab the harlot\nalso justified by works when she\nreceived the messengers and sent them\nout another way?\nand one of you says to them, \"Depart\nin peace, be warmed and filled,\" but you\ndo not give them the things which are\nneeded for the body, what does it profit?\nThus also faith by itself, if it does not\nhave works, is dead.\nFor as the body without the spirit is\ndead, so faith without works is dead also.\n3My brethren, let not many of you\nbecome teachers, knowing that we shall\nreceive a stricter judgment.\nBut someone will say, \"You have faith,\nand I have works.\" Show me your faith\nwithout your works, and I will show you\nmy faith by my works.\nFor we all stumble in many things. If\nanyone does not stumble in word, he is\na perfect man, able also to bridle the\nwhole body.\nYou believe that there is one God. You\ndo well. Even the demons believe--and\ntremble!\nIndeed, we put bits in horses' mouths\nthat they may obey us, and we turn their\nwhole body.\nBut do you want to know, O foolish\nman, that faith without works is dead?\nWas not Abraham our father justified\nby works when he offered Isaac his son\non the altar?\nDo you see that faith was working\ntogether with his works, and by works\nfaith was made perfect?\nLook also at ships: although they are so\nlarge and are driven by fierce winds,\nthey are turned by a very small rudder\nwherever the pilot desires.\nEven so the tongue is a little member\nand boasts great things. See how great\na forest a little fire kindles!\nAnd the tongue is a fire, a world of\niniquity. The tongue is so set among our\nmembers that it defiles the whole body,\nand sets on fire the course of nature;\nand it is set on fire by hell.\nto yield, full of mercy and good fruits,\nwithout partiality and without hypocrisy.\nFor every kind of beast and bird, of\nreptile and creature of the sea, is tamed\nand has been tamed by mankind.\nBut no man can tame the tongue. It is\nan unruly evil, full of deadly poison.\nWith it we bless our God and Father,\nand with it we curse men, who have\nbeen made in the similitude of God.\nOut of the same mouth proceed\nblessing and cursing. My brethren,\nthese things ought not to be so.\nNow the fruit of righteousness is sown\nin peace by those who make peace.\n4Where do wars and fights come from\namong you? Do they not come from\nyour desires for pleasure that war in\nyour members?\nYou lust and do not have. You murder\nand covet and cannot obtain. You fight\nand war. Yet you do not have because\nyou do not ask.\nDoes a spring send forth fresh water\nand bitter from the same opening?\nYou ask and do not receive, because\nyou ask amiss, that you may spend it on\nyour pleasures.\nCan a fig tree, my brethren, bear\nolives, or a grapevine bear figs? Thus\nno spring yields both salt water and\nfresh.\nAdulterers and adulteresses! Do you\nnot know that friendship with the world is\nenmity with God? Whoever therefore\nwants to be a friend of the world makes\nhimself an enemy of God.\nWho is wise and understanding among\nyou? Let him show by good conduct that\nhis works are done in the meekness of\nwisdom.\nOr do you think that the Scripture says\nin vain, \"The Spirit who dwells in us\nyearns jealously\"?\nBut if you have bitter envy and selfseeking in your hearts, do not boast and\nlie against the truth.\nBut He gives more grace. Therefore He\nsays: \"God resists the proud, But gives\ngrace to the humble.\"\nThis wisdom does not descend from\nabove, but is earthly, sensual, demonic.\nTherefore submit to God. Resist the\ndevil and he will flee from you.\nFor where envy and self-seeking exist,\nconfusion and every evil thing are there.\nBut the wisdom that is from above is\nfirst pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing\nDraw near to God and He will draw\nnear to you. Cleanse your hands, you\nsinners; and purify your hearts, you\ndouble-minded.\nLament and mourn and weep! Let your\nlaughter be turned to mourning and your\njoy to gloom.\nYour riches are corrupted, and your\ngarments are moth-eaten.\nHumble yourselves in the sight of the\nLord, and He will lift you up.\nDo not speak evil of one another,\nbrethren. He who speaks evil of a\nbrother and judges his brother, speaks\nevil of the law and judges the law. But if\nyou judge the law, you are not a doer of\nthe law but a judge.\nYour gold and silver are corroded, and\ntheir corrosion will be a witness against\nyou and will eat your flesh like fire. You\nhave heaped up treasure in the last\ndays.\nIndeed the wages of the laborers who\nmowed your fields, which you kept back\nby fraud, cry out; and the cries of the\nreapers have reached the ears of the\nLord of Sabaoth.\nThere is one Lawgiver, who is able to\nsave and to destroy. Who are you to\njudge another?\nYou have lived on the earth in pleasure\nand luxury; you have fattened your\nhearts as in a day of slaughter.\nCome now, you who say, \"Today or\ntomorrow we will go to such and such a\ncity, spend a year there, buy and sell,\nand make a profit\";\nYou have condemned, you have\nmurdered the just; he does not resist\nyou.\nwhereas you do not know what will\nhappen tomorrow. For what is your life?\nIt is even a vapor that appears for a little\ntime and then vanishes away.\nTherefore be patient, brethren, until the\ncoming of the Lord. See how the farmer\nwaits for the precious fruit of the earth,\nwaiting patiently for it until it receives the\nearly and latter rain.\nInstead you ought to say, \"If the Lord\nwills, we shall live and do this or that.\"\nBut now you boast in your arrogance.\nAll such boasting is evil.\nYou also be patient. Establish your\nhearts, for the coming of the Lord is at\nhand.\nTherefore, to him who knows to do\ngood and does not do it, to him it is sin.\nDo not grumble against one another,\nbrethren, lest you be condemned.\nBehold, the Judge is standing at the\ndoor!\n5Come now, you rich, weep and howl\nfor your miseries that are coming upon\nyou!\nMy brethren, take the prophets, who\nspoke in the name of the Lord, as an\nexample of suffering and patience.\nIndeed we count them blessed who\nendure. You have heard of the\nperseverance of Job and seen the end\nintended by the Lord--that the Lord is\nvery compassionate and merciful.\nConfess your trespasses to one\nanother, and pray for one another, that\nyou may be healed. The effective,\nfervent prayer of a righteous man avails\nmuch.\nBut above all, my brethren, do not\nswear, either by heaven or by earth or\nwith any other oath. But let your \"Yes\"\nbe \"Yes,\" and your \"No,\" \"No,\" lest you\nfall into judgment.\nElijah was a man with a nature like\nours, and he prayed earnestly that it\nwould not rain; and it did not rain on the\nland for three years and six months.\nIs anyone among you suffering? Let\nhim pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him\nsing psalms.\nAnd he prayed again, and the heaven\ngave rain, and the earth produced its\nfruit.\nIs anyone among you sick? Let him\ncall for the elders of the church, and let\nthem pray over him, anointing him with\noil in the name of the Lord.\nAnd the prayer of faith will save the\nsick, and the Lord will raise him up. And\nif he has committed sins, he will be\nforgiven.\nBrethren, if anyone among you\nwanders from the truth, and someone\nturns him back,\nlet him know that he who turns a\nsinner from the error of his way will save\na soul from death and cover a multitude\nof sins.\n1st Peter\n1Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To\nthe pilgrims of the Dispersion in Pontus,\nGalatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,\nelect according to the foreknowledge of\nGod the Father, in sanctification of the\nSpirit, for obedience and sprinkling of\nthe blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you\nand peace be multiplied.\nBlessed be the God and Father of our\nLord Jesus Christ, who according to His\nabundant mercy has begotten us again\nto a living hope through the resurrection\nof Jesus Christ from the dead,\nto an inheritance incorruptible and\nundefiled and that does not fade away,\nreserved in heaven for you,\nwho are kept by the power of God\nthrough faith for salvation ready to be\nrevealed in the last time.\nIn this you greatly rejoice, though now\nfor a little while, if need be, you have\nbeen grieved by various trials,\nthat the genuineness of your faith,\nbeing much more precious than gold\nthat perishes, though it is tested by fire,\nmay be found to praise, honor, and glory\nat the revelation of Jesus Christ,\nwhom having not seen you love.\nThough now you do not see Him, yet\nbelieving,\nyou\nrejoice\nwith\ninexpressible and full of glory,\njoy\nreceiving the end of your faith--the\nsalvation of your souls.\nOf this salvation the prophets have\ninquired and searched carefully, who\nprophesied of the grace that would\ncome to you,\nsearching what, or what manner of\ntime, the Spirit of Christ who was in\nthem was indicating when He testified\nbeforehand the sufferings of Christ and\nthe glories that would follow.\nTo them it was revealed that, not to\nthemselves, but to us they were\nministering the things which now have\nbeen reported to you through those who\nhave preached the gospel to you by the\nHoly Spirit sent from heaven--things\nwhich angels desire to look into.\nTherefore gird up the loins of your\nmind, be sober, and rest your hope fully\nupon the grace that is to be brought to\nyou at the revelation of Jesus Christ;\nas obedient children, not conforming\nyourselves to the former lusts, as in your\nignorance;\nbut as He who called you is holy, you\nalso be holy in all your conduct,\nbecause it is written, \"Be holy, for I am\nholy.\"\nAnd if you call on the Father, who\nwithout partiality judges according to\neach one's work, conduct yourselves\nthroughout the time of your stay here in\nfear;\nknowing that you were not redeemed\nwith corruptible things, like silver or gold,\nfrom your aimless conduct received by\ntradition from your fathers,\nbut with the precious blood of Christ,\nas of a lamb without blemish and\nwithout spot.\nHe indeed was foreordained before\nthe foundation of the world, but was\nmanifest in these last times for you\nwho through Him believe in God, who\nraised Him from the dead and gave Him\nglory, so that your faith and hope are in\nGod.\nSince you have purified your souls in\nobeying the truth through the Spirit in\nsincere love of the brethren, love one\nanother fervently with a pure heart,\nhaving been born again, not of\ncorruptible seed but incorruptible,\nthrough the word of God which lives and\nabides forever,\nbecause \"All flesh is as grass, And all\nthe glory of man as the flower of the\ngrass. The grass withers, And its flower\nfalls away,\nBut the word of the LORD endures\nforever.\" Now this is the word which by\nthe gospel was preached to you.\n2Therefore, laying aside all malice, all\ndeceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil\nspeaking,\nas newborn babes, desire the pure milk\nof the word, that you may grow thereby,\nif indeed you have tasted that the Lord\nis gracious.\nComing to Him as to a living stone,\nrejected indeed by men, but chosen by\nGod and precious,\nyou also, as living stones, are being\nbuilt up a spiritual house, a holy\npriesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices\nacceptable to God through Jesus Christ.\nTherefore it is also contained in the\nScripture, \"Behold, I lay in Zion A chief\ncornerstone, elect, precious, And he\nwho believes on Him will by no means\nbe put to shame.\"\nTherefore, to you who believe, He is\nprecious; but to those who are\ndisobedient, \"The stone which the\nbuilders rejected Has become the chief\ncornerstone,\"\nand \"A stone of stumbling And a rock of\noffense.\"\nThey\nstumble,\nbeing\ndisobedient to the word, to which they\nalso were appointed.\nBut you are a chosen generation, a\nroyal priesthood, a holy nation, His own\nspecial people, that you may proclaim\nthe praises of Him who called you out of\ndarkness into His marvelous light;\nwho once were not a people but are\nnow the people of God, who had not\nobtained mercy but now have obtained\nmercy.\nFor what credit is it if, when you are\nbeaten for your faults, you take it\npatiently? But when you do good and\nsuffer, if you take it patiently, this is\ncommendable before God.\nBeloved, I beg you as sojourners and\npilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which\nwar against the soul,\nhaving your conduct honorable among\nthe Gentiles, that when they speak\nagainst you as evildoers, they may, by\nyour good works which they observe,\nglorify God in the day of visitation.\nFor to this you were called, because\nChrist also suffered for us, leaving us an\nexample, that you should follow His\nsteps:\n\"Who committed no sin, Nor was\ndeceit found in His mouth\";\nTherefore submit yourselves to every\nordinance of man for the Lord's sake,\nwhether to the king as supreme,\nwho, when He was reviled, did not\nrevile in return; when He suffered, He\ndid not threaten, but committed Himself\nto Him who judges righteously;\nor to governors, as to those who are\nsent by him for the punishment of\nevildoers and for the praise of those\nwho do good.\nwho Himself bore our sins in His own\nbody on the tree, that we, having died to\nsins, might live for righteousness--by\nwhose stripes you were healed.\nFor this is the will of God, that by doing\ngood you may put to silence the\nignorance of foolish men--\nFor you were like sheep going astray,\nbut have now returned to the Shepherd\nand Overseer of your souls.\n3Wives, likewise, be submissive to\nas free, yet not using liberty as a cloak\nfor vice, but as bondservants of God.\nHonor\nall\npeople.\nLove\nthe\nbrotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.\nyour own husbands, that even if some\ndo not obey the word, they, without a\nword, may be won by the conduct of\ntheir wives,\nServants, be submissive to your\nmasters with all fear, not only to the\ngood and gentle, but also to the harsh.\nwhen they observe your chaste conduct\naccompanied by fear.\nFor this is commendable, if because of\nconscience toward God one endures\ngrief, suffering wrongfully.\nDo not let your adornment be merely\noutward--arranging the hair, wearing\ngold, or putting on fine apparel--\nrather let it be the hidden person of the\nheart, with the incorruptible beauty of a\ngentle and quiet spirit, which is very\nprecious in the sight of God.\nFor in this manner, in former times, the\nholy women who trusted in God also\nadorned themselves, being submissive\nto their own husbands,\nAnd who is he who will harm you if you\nbecome followers of what is good?\nBut even if you should suffer for\nrighteousness' sake, you are blessed.\n\"And do not be afraid of their threats,\nnor be troubled.\"\nas Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him\nlord, whose daughters you are if you do\ngood and are not afraid with any terror.\nBut sanctify the Lord God in your\nhearts, and always be ready to give a\ndefense to everyone who asks you a\nreason for the hope that is in you, with\nmeekness and fear;\nHusbands, likewise, dwell with them\nwith understanding, giving honor to the\nwife, as to the weaker vessel, and as\nbeing heirs together of the grace of life,\nthat your prayers may not be hindered.\nhaving a good conscience, that when\nthey defame you as evildoers, those\nwho revile your good conduct in Christ\nmay be ashamed.\nFinally, all of you be of one mind,\nhaving compassion for one another;\nlove as brothers, be tenderhearted, be\ncourteous;\nnot returning evil for evil or reviling for\nreviling, but on the contrary blessing,\nknowing that you were called to this,\nthat you may inherit a blessing.\nFor \"He who would love life And see\ngood days, Let him refrain his tongue\nfrom evil, And his lips from speaking\ndeceit.\nLet him turn away from evil and do\ngood; Let him seek peace and pursue it.\nFor the eyes of the LORD are on the\nrighteous, And His ears are open to their\nprayers; But the face of the LORD is\nagainst those who do evil.\"\nFor it is better, if it is the will of God, to\nsuffer for doing good than for doing evil.\nFor Christ also suffered once for sins,\nthe just for the unjust, that He might\nbring us to God, being put to death in\nthe flesh but made alive by the Spirit,\nby whom also He went and preached\nto the spirits in prison,\nwho formerly were disobedient, when\nonce the Divine longsuffering waited in\nthe days of Noah, while the ark was\nbeing prepared, in which a few, that is,\neight souls, were saved through water.\nThere is also an antitype which now\nsaves us--baptism (not the removal of\nthe filth of the flesh, but the answer of a\ngood conscience toward God), through\nthe resurrection of Jesus Christ,\nwho has gone into heaven and is at\nthe right hand of God, angels and\nauthorities and powers having been\nmade subject to Him.\n4Therefore, since Christ suffered for\nus in the flesh, arm yourselves also with\nthe same mind, for he who has suffered\nin the flesh has ceased from sin,\nthat he no longer should live the rest of\nhis time in the flesh for the lusts of men,\nbut for the will of God.\nFor we have spent enough of our past\nlifetime in doing the will of the Gentiles-when we walked in lewdness, lusts,\ndrunkenness, revelries, drinking parties,\nand abominable idolatries.\nIn regard to these, they think it strange\nthat you do not run with them in the\nsame flood of dissipation, speaking evil\nof you.\nThey will give an account to Him who is\nready to judge the living and the dead.\nFor this reason the gospel was\npreached also to those who are dead,\nthat they might be judged according to\nmen in the flesh, but live according to\nGod in the spirit.\nBut the end of all things is at hand;\ntherefore be serious and watchful in\nyour prayers.\nAnd above all things have fervent love\nfor one another, for \"love will cover a\nmultitude of sins.\"\nBe hospitable to one another without\ngrumbling.\nAs each one has received a gift,\nminister it to one another, as good\nstewards of the manifold grace of God.\nIf anyone speaks, let him speak as the\noracles of God. If anyone ministers, let\nhim do it as with the ability which God\nsupplies, that in all things God may be\nglorified through Jesus Christ, to whom\nbelong the glory and the dominion\nforever and ever. Amen.\nBeloved, do not think it strange\nconcerning the fiery trial which is to try\nyou, as though some strange thing\nhappened to you;\nbut rejoice to the extent that you\npartake of Christ's sufferings, that when\nHis glory is revealed, you may also be\nglad with exceeding joy.\nIf you are reproached for the name of\nChrist, blessed are you, for the Spirit of\nglory and of God rests upon you. On\ntheir part He is blasphemed, but on your\npart He is glorified.\nBut let none of you suffer as a\nmurderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a\nbusybody in other people's matters.\nYet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let\nhim not be ashamed, but let him glorify\nGod in this matter.\nFor the time has come for judgment to\nbegin at the house of God; and if it\nbegins with us first, what will be the end\nof those who do not obey the gospel of\nGod?\nTherefore humble yourselves under the\nmighty hand of God, that He may exalt\nyou in due time,\nNow \"If the righteous one is scarcely\nsaved, Where will the ungodly and the\nsinner appear?\"\ncasting all your care upon Him, for He\ncares for you.\nTherefore let those who suffer\naccording to the will of God commit their\nsouls to Him in doing good, as to a\nfaithful Creator.\nBe sober, be vigilant; because your\nadversary the devil walks about like a\nroaring lion, seeking whom he may\ndevour.\n5The elders who are among you I\nexhort, I who am a fellow elder and a\nwitness of the sufferings of Christ, and\nalso a partaker of the glory that will be\nrevealed:\nShepherd the flock of God which is\namong you, serving as overseers, not\nby compulsion but willingly, not for\ndishonest gain but eagerly;\nnor as being lords over those entrusted\nto you, but being examples to the flock;\nand when the Chief Shepherd appears,\nyou will receive the crown of glory that\ndoes not fade away.\nLikewise you younger people, submit\nyourselves to your elders. Yes, all of you\nbe submissive to one another, and be\nclothed with humility, for \"God resists\nthe proud, But gives grace to the\nhumble.\"\nResist him, steadfast in the faith,\nknowing that the same sufferings are\nexperienced by your brotherhood in the\nworld.\nBut may the God of all grace, who\ncalled us to His eternal glory by Christ\nJesus, after you have suffered a while,\nperfect, establish, strengthen, and settle\nyou.\nTo Him be the glory and the dominion\nforever and ever. Amen.\nBy Silvanus, our faithful brother as I\nconsider him, I have written to you\nbriefly, exhorting and testifying that this\nis the true grace of God in which you\nstand.\nShe who is in Babylon, elect together\nwith you, greets you; and so does Mark\nmy son.\nGreet one another with a kiss of love.\nPeace to you all who are in Christ Jesus.\nAmen.\n2nd Peter\n1Simon Peter, a bondservant and\napostle of Jesus Christ, To those who\nhave obtained like precious faith with us\nby the righteousness of our God and\nSavior Jesus Christ:\nGrace and peace be multiplied to you in\nthe knowledge of God and of Jesus our\nLord,\nas His divine power has given to us all\nthings that pertain to life and godliness,\nthrough the knowledge of Him who\ncalled us by glory and virtue,\nby which have been given to us\nexceedingly\ngreat\nand\nprecious\npromises, that through these you may\nbe partakers of the divine nature, having\nescaped the corruption that is in the\nworld through lust.\nBut also for this very reason, giving all\ndiligence, add to your faith virtue, to\nvirtue knowledge,\nto knowledge self-control, to self-control\nperseverance,\nto\nperseverance\ngodliness,\nto godliness brotherly kindness, and to\nbrotherly kindness love.\nFor if these things are yours and\nabound, you will be neither barren nor\nunfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord\nJesus Christ.\nFor he who lacks these things is\nshortsighted, even to blindness, and has\nforgotten that he was cleansed from his\nold sins.\nTherefore, brethren, be even more\ndiligent to make your call and election\nsure, for if you do these things you will\nnever stumble;\nfor so an entrance will be supplied to\nyou abundantly into the everlasting\nkingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus\nChrist.\nFor this reason I will not be negligent\nto remind you always of these things,\nthough you know and are established in\nthe present truth.\nYes, I think it is right, as long as I am\nin this tent, to stir you up by reminding\nyou,\nknowing that shortly I must put off my\ntent, just as our Lord Jesus Christ\nshowed me.\nMoreover I will be careful to ensure\nthat you always have a reminder of\nthese things after my decease.\nFor we did not follow cunningly\ndevised fables when we made known to\nyou the power and coming of our Lord\nJesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of\nHis majesty.\nFor He received from God the Father\nhonor and glory when such a voice\ncame to Him from the Excellent Glory:\n\"This is My beloved Son, in whom I am\nwell pleased.\"\nand did not spare the ancient world, but\nsaved Noah, one of eight people, a\npreacher of righteousness, bringing in\nthe flood on the world of the ungodly;\nAnd we heard this voice which came\nfrom heaven when we were with Him on\nthe holy mountain.\nAnd so we have the prophetic word\nconfirmed, which you do well to heed as\na light that shines in a dark place, until\nthe day dawns and the morning star\nrises in your hearts;\nand turning the cities of Sodom and\nGomorrah into ashes, condemned them\nto destruction, making them an example\nto those who afterward would live\nungodly;\nand delivered righteous Lot, who was\noppressed by the filthy conduct of the\nwicked\nknowing this first, that no prophecy of\nScripture is of any private interpretation,\nfor prophecy never came by the will of\nman, but holy men of God spoke as they\nwere moved by the Holy Spirit.\n2But there were also false prophets\namong the people, even as there will be\nfalse teachers among you, who will\nsecretly bring in destructive heresies,\neven denying the Lord who bought them,\nand bring on themselves swift\ndestruction.\nAnd many will follow their destructive\nways, because of whom the way of truth\nwill be blasphemed.\nBy covetousness they will exploit you\nwith deceptive words; for a long time\ntheir judgment has not been idle, and\ntheir destruction does not slumber.\nFor if God did not spare the angels who\nsinned, but cast them down to hell and\ndelivered them into chains of darkness,\nto be reserved for judgment;\n(for that righteous man, dwelling among\nthem, tormented his righteous soul from\nday to day by seeing and hearing their\nlawless deeds)-9\nthen the Lord knows how to deliver the\ngodly out of temptations and to reserve\nthe unjust under punishment for the day\nof judgment,\nand especially those who walk\naccording to the flesh in the lust of\nuncleanness and despise authority.\nThey are presumptuous, self-willed.\nThey are not afraid to speak evil of\ndignitaries,\nwhereas angels, who are greater in\npower and might, do not bring a reviling\naccusation against them before the Lord.\nBut these, like natural brute beasts\nmade to be caught and destroyed,\nspeak evil of the things they do not\nunderstand, and will utterly perish in\ntheir own corruption,\nand will receive the wages of\nunrighteousness, as those who count it\npleasure to carouse in the daytime.\nThey are spots and blemishes,\ncarousing in their own deceptions while\nthey feast with you,\nhaving eyes full of adultery and that\ncannot cease from sin, enticing unstable\nsouls. They have a heart trained in\ncovetous practices, and are accursed\nchildren.\nThey have forsaken the right way and\ngone astray, following the way of\nBalaam the son of Beor, who loved the\nwages of unrighteousness;\nbut he was rebuked for his iniquity: a\ndumb donkey speaking with a man's\nvoice restrained the madness of the\nprophet.\nThese are wells without water, clouds\ncarried by a tempest, for whom is\nreserved the blackness of darkness\nforever.\nFor when they speak great swelling\nwords of emptiness, they allure through\nthe lusts of the flesh, through lewdness,\nthe ones who have actually escaped\nfrom those who live in error.\nWhile they promise them liberty, they\nthemselves are slaves of corruption; for\nby whom a person is overcome, by him\nalso he is brought into bondage.\nFor if, after they have escaped the\npollutions of the world through the\nknowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus\nChrist, they are again entangled in them\nand overcome, the latter end is worse\nfor them than the beginning.\nFor it would have been better for them\nnot to have known the way of\nrighteousness, than having known it, to\nturn from the holy commandment\ndelivered to them.\nBut it has happened to them according\nto the true proverb: \"A dog returns to his\nown vomit,\" and, \"a sow, having washed,\nto her wallowing in the mire.\"\n3Beloved, I now write to you this\nsecond epistle (in both of which I stir up\nyour pure minds by way of reminder),\nthat you may be mindful of the words\nwhich were spoken before by the holy\nprophets, and of the commandment of\nus, the apostles of the Lord and Savior,\nknowing this first: that scoffers will\ncome in the last days, walking according\nto their own lusts,\nand saying, \"Where is the promise of\nHis coming? For since the fathers fell\nasleep, all things continue as they were\nfrom the beginning of creation.\"\nFor this they willfully forget: that by the\nword of God the heavens were of old,\nand the earth standing out of water and\nin the water,\nby which the world that then existed\nperished, being flooded with water.\nBut the heavens and the earth which\nare now preserved by the same word,\nare reserved for fire until the day of\njudgment and perdition of ungodly men.\nNevertheless we, according to His\npromise, look for new heavens and a\nnew earth in which righteousness dwells.\nBut, beloved, do not forget this one\nthing, that with the Lord one day is as a\nthousand years, and a thousand years\nas one day.\nTherefore, beloved, looking forward to\nthese things, be diligent to be found by\nHim in peace, without spot and\nblameless;\nThe Lord is not slack concerning His\npromise, as some count slackness, but\nis longsuffering toward us, not willing\nthat any should perish but that all should\ncome to repentance.\nand consider that the longsuffering of\nour Lord is salvation--as also our\nbeloved brother Paul, according to the\nwisdom given to him, has written to you,\nBut the day of the Lord will come as a\nthief in the night, in which the heavens\nwill pass away with a great noise, and\nthe elements will melt with fervent heat;\nboth the earth and the works that are in\nit will be burned up.\nas also in all his epistles, speaking in\nthem of these things, in which are some\nthings hard to understand, which\nuntaught and unstable people twist to\ntheir own destruction, as they do also\nthe rest of the Scriptures.\nTherefore, since all these things will be\ndissolved, what manner of persons\nought you to be in holy conduct and\ngodliness,\nYou therefore, beloved, since you\nknow this beforehand, beware lest you\nalso fall from your own steadfastness,\nbeing led away with the error of the\nwicked;\nlooking for and hastening the coming\nof the day of God, because of which the\nheavens will be dissolved, being on fire,\nand the elements will melt with fervent\nheat?\nbut grow in the grace and knowledge\nof our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To\nHim be the glory both now and forever.\nAmen.\n1st John\n1That which was from the beginning,\nwhich we have heard, which we have\nseen with our eyes, which we have\nlooked upon, and our hands have\nhandled, concerning the Word of life-2\nthe life was manifested, and we have\nseen, and bear witness, and declare to\nyou that eternal life which was with the\nFather and was manifested to us--\nIf we confess our sins, He is faithful and\njust to forgive us our sins and to cleanse\nus from all unrighteousness.\nIf we say that we have not sinned, we\nmake Him a liar, and His word is not in\nus.\n2My little children, these things I write\nto you, so that you may not sin. And if\nanyone sins, we have an Advocate with\nthe Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.\nthat which we have seen and heard we\ndeclare to you, that you also may have\nfellowship with us; and truly our\nfellowship is with the Father and with\nHis Son Jesus Christ.\nAnd He Himself is the propitiation for\nour sins, and not for ours only but also\nfor the whole world.\nAnd these things we write to you that\nyour joy may be full.\nNow by this we know that we know Him,\nif we keep His commandments.\nThis is the message which we have\nheard from Him and declare to you, that\nGod is light and in Him is no darkness at\nall.\nIf we say that we have fellowship with\nHim, and walk in darkness, we lie and\ndo not practice the truth.\nBut if we walk in the light as He is in the\nlight, we have fellowship with one\nanother, and the blood of Jesus Christ\nHis Son cleanses us from all sin.\nIf we say that we have no sin, we\ndeceive ourselves, and the truth is not in\nus.\nHe who says, \"I know Him,\" and does\nnot keep His commandments, is a liar,\nand the truth is not in him.\nBut whoever keeps His word, truly the\nlove of God is perfected in him. By this\nwe know that we are in Him.\nHe who says he abides in Him ought\nhimself also to walk just as He walked.\nBrethren, I write no new commandment\nto you, but an old commandment which\nyou have had from the beginning. The\nold commandment is the word which\nyou heard from the beginning.\nAgain, a new commandment I write to\nyou, which thing is true in Him and in\nyou, because the darkness is passing\naway, and the true light is already\nshining.\nFor all that is in the world--the lust of\nthe flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the\npride of life--is not of the Father but is of\nthe world.\nHe who says he is in the light, and\nhates his brother, is in darkness until\nnow.\nAnd the world is passing away, and\nthe lust of it; but he who does the will of\nGod abides forever.\nHe who loves his brother abides in the\nlight, and there is no cause for stumbling\nin him.\nLittle children, it is the last hour; and\nas you have heard that the Antichrist is\ncoming, even now many antichrists\nhave come, by which we know that it is\nthe last hour.\nBut he who hates his brother is in\ndarkness and walks in darkness, and\ndoes not know where he is going,\nbecause the darkness has blinded his\neyes.\nThey went out from us, but they were\nnot of us; for if they had been of us, they\nwould have continued with us; but they\nwent out that they might be made\nmanifest, that none of them were of us.\nI write to you, little children, Because\nyour sins are forgiven you for His\nname's sake.\nBut you have an anointing from the\nHoly One, and you know all things.\nI write to you, fathers, Because you\nhave known Him who is from the\nbeginning. I write to you, young men,\nBecause you have overcome the wicked\none. I write to you, little children,\nBecause you have known the Father.\nI have written to you, fathers, Because\nyou have known Him who is from the\nbeginning. I have written to you, young\nmen, Because you are strong, and the\nword of God abides in you, And you\nhave overcome the wicked one.\nI have not written to you because you\ndo not know the truth, but because you\nknow it, and that no lie is of the truth.\nWho is a liar but he who denies that\nJesus is the Christ? He is antichrist who\ndenies the Father and the Son.\nWhoever denies the Son does not\nhave the Father either; he who\nacknowledges the Son has the Father\nalso.\nDo not love the world or the things in\nthe world. If anyone loves the world, the\nlove of the Father is not in him.\nTherefore let that abide in you which\nyou heard from the beginning. If what\nyou heard from the beginning abides in\nyou, you also will abide in the Son and\nin the Father.\nAnd this is the promise that He has\npromised us--eternal life.\nAnd you know that He was manifested\nto take away our sins, and in Him there\nis no sin.\nThese things I have written to you\nconcerning those who try to deceive you.\nBut the anointing which you have\nreceived from Him abides in you, and\nyou do not need that anyone teach you;\nbut as the same anointing teaches you\nconcerning all things, and is true, and is\nnot a lie, and just as it has taught you,\nyou will abide in Him.\nAnd now, little children, abide in Him,\nthat when He appears, we may have\nconfidence and not be ashamed before\nHim at His coming.\nWhoever abides in Him does not sin.\nWhoever sins has neither seen Him nor\nknown Him.\nLittle children, let no one deceive you.\nHe who practices righteousness is\nrighteous, just as He is righteous.\nHe who sins is of the devil, for the devil\nhas sinned from the beginning. For this\npurpose the Son of God was manifested,\nthat He might destroy the works of the\ndevil.\nIf you know that He is righteous, you\nknow that everyone who practices\nrighteousness is born of Him.\n3Behold what manner of love the\nFather has bestowed on us, that we\nshould be called children of God!\nTherefore the world does not know us,\nbecause it did not know Him.\nBeloved, now we are children of God;\nand it has not yet been revealed what\nwe shall be, but we know that when He\nis revealed, we shall be like Him, for we\nshall see Him as He is.\nAnd everyone who has this hope in Him\npurifies himself, just as He is pure.\nWhoever commits sin also commits\nlawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.\nWhoever has been born of God does\nnot sin, for His seed remains in him; and\nhe cannot sin, because he has been\nborn of God.\nIn this the children of God and the\nchildren of the devil are manifest:\nWhoever\ndoes\nnot\npractice\nrighteousness is not of God, nor is he\nwho does not love his brother.\nFor this is the message that you heard\nfrom the beginning, that we should love\none another,\nnot as Cain who was of the wicked\none and murdered his brother. And why\ndid he murder him? Because his works\nwere evil and his brother's righteous.\nDo not marvel, my brethren, if the\nworld hates you.\nWe know that we have passed from\ndeath to life, because we love the\nbrethren. He who does not love his\nbrother abides in death.\nWhoever hates his brother is a\nmurderer, and you know that no\nmurderer has eternal life abiding in him.\nBy this we know love, because He laid\ndown His life for us. And we also ought\nto lay down our lives for the brethren.\nNow\nhe\nwho\nkeeps\nHis\ncommandments abides in Him, and He\nin him. And by this we know that He\nabides in us, by the Spirit whom He has\ngiven us.\n4Beloved, do not believe every spirit,\nbut test the spirits, whether they are of\nGod; because many false prophets have\ngone out into the world.\nBut whoever has this world's goods,\nand sees his brother in need, and shuts\nup his heart from him, how does the\nlove of God abide in him?\nBy this you know the Spirit of God:\nEvery spirit that confesses that Jesus\nChrist has come in the flesh is of God,\nMy little children, let us not love in\nword or in tongue, but in deed and in\ntruth.\nAnd by this we know that we are of the\ntruth, and shall assure our hearts before\nHim.\nFor if our heart condemns us, God is\ngreater than our heart, and knows all\nthings.\nand every spirit that does not confess\nthat Jesus Christ has come in the flesh\nis not of God. And this is the spirit of the\nAntichrist, which you have heard was\ncoming, and is now already in the world.\nYou are of God, little children, and have\novercome them, because He who is in\nyou is greater than he who is in the\nworld.\nBeloved, if our\ncondemn us, we\ntoward God.\nheart does not\nhave confidence\nThey are of the world. Therefore they\nspeak as of the world, and the world\nhears them.\nAnd whatever we ask we receive from\nHim,\nbecause\nwe\nkeep\nHis\ncommandments and do those things\nthat are pleasing in His sight.\nWe are of God. He who knows God\nhears us; he who is not of God does not\nhear us. By this we know the spirit of\ntruth and the spirit of error.\nAnd this is His commandment: that we\nshould believe on the name of His Son\nJesus Christ and love one another, as\nHe gave us commandment.\nBeloved, let us love one another, for\nlove is of God; and everyone who loves\nis born of God and knows God.\nHe who does not love does not know\nGod, for God is love.\nIn this the love of God was manifested\ntoward us, that God has sent His only\nbegotten Son into the world, that we\nmight live through Him.\nIn this is love, not that we loved God,\nbut that He loved us and sent His Son to\nbe the propitiation for our sins.\nWe love Him because He first loved us.\nIf someone says, \"I love God,\" and\nhates his brother, he is a liar; for he who\ndoes not love his brother whom he has\nseen, how can he love God whom he\nhas not seen?\nBeloved, if God so loved us, we also\nought to love one another.\nNo one has seen God at any time. If\nwe love one another, God abides in us,\nand His love has been perfected in us.\nBy this we know that we abide in Him,\nand He in us, because He has given us\nof His Spirit.\nAnd we have seen and testify that the\nFather has sent the Son as Savior of the\nworld.\nWhoever confesses that Jesus is the\nSon of God, God abides in him, and he\nin God.\nAnd we have known and believed the\nlove that God has for us. God is love,\nand he who abides in love abides in\nGod, and God in him.\nLove has been perfected among us in\nthis: that we may have boldness in the\nday of judgment; because as He is, so\nare we in this world.\nThere is no fear in love; but perfect\nlove casts out fear, because fear\ninvolves torment. But he who fears has\nnot been made perfect in love.\nAnd this commandment we have from\nHim: that he who loves God must love\nhis brother also.\n5Whoever believes that Jesus is the\nChrist is born of God, and everyone who\nloves Him who begot also loves him\nwho is begotten of Him.\nBy this we know that we love the\nchildren of God, when we love God and\nkeep His commandments.\nFor this is the love of God, that we keep\nHis\ncommandments.\nAnd\nHis\ncommandments are not burdensome.\nFor whatever is born of God overcomes\nthe world. And this is the victory that has\novercome the world--our faith.\nWho is he who overcomes the world,\nbut he who believes that Jesus is the\nSon of God?\nThis is He who came by water and\nblood--Jesus Christ; not only by water,\nbut by water and blood. And it is the\nSpirit who bears witness, because the\nSpirit is truth.\nFor there are three that bear witness in\nheaven: the Father, the Word, and the\nHoly Spirit; and these three are one.\nAnd there are three that bear witness\non earth: the Spirit, the water, and the\nblood; and these three agree as one.\nAnd if we know that He hears us,\nwhatever we ask, we know that we have\nthe petitions that we have asked of Him.\nIf we receive the witness of men, the\nwitness of God is greater; for this is the\nwitness of God which He has testified of\nHis Son.\nHe who believes in the Son of God\nhas the witness in himself; he who does\nnot believe God has made Him a liar,\nbecause he has not believed the\ntestimony that God has given of His Son.\nIf anyone sees his brother sinning a\nsin which does not lead to death, he will\nask, and He will give him life for those\nwho commit sin not leading to death.\nThere is sin leading to death. I do not\nsay that he should pray about that.\nAll unrighteousness is sin, and there is\nsin not leading to death.\nAnd this is the testimony: that God has\ngiven us eternal life, and this life is in\nHis Son.\nWe know that whoever is born of God\ndoes not sin; but he who has been born\nof God keeps himself, and the wicked\none does not touch him.\nHe who has the Son has life; he who\ndoes not have the Son of God does not\nhave life.\nWe know that we are of God, and the\nwhole world lies under the sway of the\nwicked one.\nThese things I have written to you who\nbelieve in the name of the Son of God,\nthat you may know that you have eternal\nlife, and that you may continue to\nbelieve in the name of the Son of God.\nAnd we know that the Son of God has\ncome\nand\nhas\ngiven\nus\nan\nunderstanding, that we may know Him\nwho is true; and we are in Him who is\ntrue, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the\ntrue God and eternal life.\nNow this is the confidence that we\nhave in Him, that if we ask anything\naccording to His will, He hears us.\nLittle children, keep yourselves from\nidols. Amen.\n2nd John\n1The Elder, To the elect lady and her\nchildren, whom I love in truth, and not\nonly I, but also all those who have\nknown the truth,\nbecause of the truth which abides in us\nand will be with us forever:\nGrace, mercy, and peace will be with\nyou from God the Father and from the\nLord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father,\nin truth and love.\nI rejoiced greatly that I have found\nsome of your children walking in truth,\nas we received commandment from the\nFather.\nAnd now I plead with you, lady, not as\nthough I wrote a new commandment to\nyou, but that which we have had from\nthe beginning: that we love one another.\nThis is love, that we walk according to\nHis commandments. This is the\ncommandment, that as you have heard\nfrom the beginning, you should walk in it.\nFor many deceivers have gone out into\nthe world who do not confess Jesus\nChrist as coming in the flesh. This is a\ndeceiver and an antichrist.\nLook to yourselves, that we do not lose\nthose things we worked for, but that we\nmay receive a full reward.\nWhoever transgresses and does not\nabide in the doctrine of Christ does not\nhave God. He who abides in the\ndoctrine of Christ has both the Father\nand the Son.\nIf anyone comes to you and does not\nbring this doctrine, do not receive him\ninto your house nor greet him;\nfor he who greets him shares in his\nevil deeds.\nHaving many things to write to you, I\ndid not wish to do so with paper and ink;\nbut I hope to come to you and speak\nface to face, that our joy may be full.\nThe children of your elect sister greet\nyou. Amen.\n3rd John\n1The Elder, To the beloved Gaius,\nwhom I love in truth:\nBeloved, I pray that you may prosper in\nall things and be in health, just as your\nsoul prospers.\nFor I rejoiced greatly when brethren\ncame and testified of the truth that is in\nyou, just as you walk in the truth.\nI wrote to the church, but Diotrephes,\nwho loves to have the preeminence\namong them, does not receive us.\nTherefore, if I come, I will call to mind\nhis deeds which he does, prating\nagainst us with malicious words. And\nnot content with that, he himself does\nnot receive the brethren, and forbids\nthose who wish to, putting them out of\nthe church.\nI have no greater joy than to hear that\nmy children walk in truth.\nBeloved, do not imitate what is evil,\nbut what is good. He who does good is\nof God, but he who does evil has not\nseen God.\nBeloved, you do faithfully whatever you\ndo for the brethren and for strangers,\nwho have borne witness of your love\nbefore the church. If you send them\nforward on their journey in a manner\nworthy of God, you will do well,\nbecause they went forth for His name's\nsake, taking nothing from the Gentiles.\nWe therefore ought to receive such,\nthat we may become fellow workers for\nthe truth.\nDemetrius has a good testimony from\nall, and from the truth itself. And we also\nbear witness, and you know that our\ntestimony is true.\nI had many things to write, but I do not\nwish to write to you with pen and ink;\nbut I hope to see you shortly, and we\nshall speak face to face. Peace to you.\nOur friends greet you. Greet the friends\nby name.\nJude\n1Jude, a bondservant of Jesus Christ,\nand brother of James, To those who are\ncalled, sanctified by God the Father, and\npreserved in Jesus Christ:\nMercy, peace, and love be multiplied to\nyou.\nBeloved, while I was very diligent to\nwrite to you concerning our common\nsalvation, I found it necessary to write to\nyou exhorting you to contend earnestly\nfor the faith which was once for all\ndelivered to the saints.\nFor certain men have crept in unnoticed,\nwho long ago were marked out for this\ncondemnation, ungodly men, who turn\nthe grace of our God into lewdness and\ndeny the only Lord God and our Lord\nJesus Christ.\nBut I want to remind you, though you\nonce knew this, that the Lord, having\nsaved the people out of the land of\nEgypt, afterward destroyed those who\ndid not believe.\nAnd the angels who did not keep their\nproper domain, but left their own abode,\nHe has reserved in everlasting chains\nunder darkness for the judgment of the\ngreat day;\nas Sodom and Gomorrah, and the\ncities around them in a similar manner\nto these, having given themselves over\nto sexual immorality and gone after\nstrange flesh, are set forth as an\nexample, suffering the vengeance of\neternal fire.\nLikewise also these dreamers defile the\nflesh, reject authority, and speak evil of\ndignitaries.\nYet Michael the archangel, in\ncontending with the devil, when he\ndisputed about the body of Moses,\ndared not bring against him a reviling\naccusation, but said, \"The Lord rebuke\nyou!\"\nBut these speak evil of whatever they\ndo not know; and whatever they know\nnaturally, like brute beasts, in these\nthings they corrupt themselves.\nWoe to them! For they have gone in\nthe way of Cain, have run greedily in the\nerror of Balaam for profit, and perished\nin the rebellion of Korah.\nThese are spots in your love feasts,\nwhile they feast with you without fear,\nserving only themselves. They are\nclouds without water, carried about by\nthe winds; late autumn trees without fruit,\ntwice dead, pulled up by the roots;\nraging waves of the sea, foaming up\ntheir own shame; wandering stars for\nwhom is reserved the blackness of\ndarkness forever.\nNow Enoch, the seventh from Adam,\nprophesied about these men also,\nsaying, \"Behold, the Lord comes with\nten thousands of His saints,\nBut you, beloved, building yourselves\nup on your most holy faith, praying in\nthe Holy Spirit,\nto execute judgment on all, to convict\nall who are ungodly among them of all\ntheir ungodly deeds which they have\ncommitted in an ungodly way, and of all\nthe harsh things which ungodly sinners\nhave spoken against Him.\"\nkeep yourselves in the love of God,\nlooking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus\nChrist unto eternal life.\nAnd on some have\nmaking a distinction;\ncompassion,\nThese are grumblers, complainers,\nwalking according to their own lusts; and\nthey mouth great swelling words,\nflattering people to gain advantage.\nbut others save with fear, pulling them\nout of the fire, hating even the garment\ndefiled by the flesh.\nBut you, beloved, remember the words\nwhich were spoken before by the\napostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:\nhow they told you that there would be\nmockers in the last time who would walk\naccording to their own ungodly lusts.\nThese are sensual persons, who\ncause divisions, not having the Spirit.\nNow to Him who is able to keep you\nfrom stumbling, And to present you\nfaultless Before the presence of His\nglory with exceeding joy,\nTo God our Savior, Who alone is wise,\nBe glory and majesty, Dominion and\npower, Both now and forever.

He\nwas given much incense, that he should\noffer it with the prayers of all the saints\nAnd a third of the living creatures in the\nsea died, and a third of the ships were\ndestroyed.\nThen the third angel sounded: And a\ngreat star fell from heaven, burning like\na torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers\nand on the springs of water.\nThe name of the star is Wormwood. A\nthird of the waters became wormwood,\nand many men died from the water,\nbecause it was made bitter.\nThen the fourth angel sounded: And a\nthird of the sun was struck, a third of the\nmoon, and a third of the stars, so that a\nthird of them were darkened. A third of\nthe day did not shine, and likewise the\nnight.\nAnd I looked, and I heard an angel\nflying through the midst of heaven,\nsaying with a loud voice, \"Woe, woe,\nwoe to the inhabitants of the earth,\nbecause of the remaining blasts of the\ntrumpet of the three angels who are\nabout to sound!\"\n9Then the fifth angel sounded: And I\nsaw a star fallen from heaven to the\nearth. To him was given the key to the\nbottomless pit.\nAnd he opened the bottomless pit, and\nsmoke arose out of the pit like the\nsmoke of a great furnace. So the sun\nand the air were darkened because of\nthe smoke of the pit.\nIn those days men will seek death and\nwill not find it; they will desire to die, and\ndeath will flee from them.\nThe shape of the locusts was like\nhorses prepared for battle. On their\nheads were crowns of something like\ngold, and their faces were like the faces\nof men.\nThey had hair like women's hair, and\ntheir teeth were like lions' teeth.\nAnd they had breastplates like\nbreastplates of iron, and the sound of\ntheir wings was like the sound of\nchariots with many horses running into\nbattle.\nThey had tails like scorpions, and\nthere were stings in their tails. Their\npower was to hurt men five months.\nAnd they had as king over them the\nangel of the bottomless pit, whose name\nin Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he\nhas the name Apollyon.\nThen out of the smoke locusts came\nupon the earth. And to them was given\npower, as the scorpions of the earth\nhave power.\nOne woe is past. Behold, still two more\nwoes are coming after these things.\nThey were commanded not to harm the\ngrass of the earth, or any green thing, or\nany tree, but only those men who do not\nhave the seal of God on their foreheads.\nAnd they were not given authority to kill\nthem, but to torment them for five\nmonths. Their torment was like the\ntorment of a scorpion when it strikes a\nman.\nThen the sixth angel sounded: And I\nheard a voice from the four horns of the\ngolden altar which is before God,\nsaying to the sixth angel who had the\ntrumpet, \"Release the four angels who\nare bound at the great river Euphrates.\"\nSo the four angels, who had been\nprepared for the hour and day and\nmonth and year, were released to kill a\nthird of mankind.\nNow the number of the army of the\nhorsemen was two hundred million; I\nheard the number of them.\nand cried with a loud voice, as when a\nlion roars. When he cried out, seven\nthunders uttered their voices.\nAnd thus I saw the horses in the\nvision: those who sat on them had\nbreastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue,\nand sulfur yellow; and the heads of the\nhorses were like the heads of lions; and\nout of their mouths came fire, smoke,\nand brimstone.\nNow when the seven thunders uttered\ntheir voices, I was about to write; but I\nheard a voice from heaven saying to me,\n\"Seal up the things which the seven\nthunders uttered, and do not write\nthem.\"\nBy these three plagues a third of\nmankind was killed--by the fire and the\nsmoke and the brimstone which came\nout of their mouths.\nThe angel whom I saw standing on the\nsea and on the land raised up his hand\nto heaven\nFor their power is in their mouth and in\ntheir tails; for their tails are like serpents,\nhaving heads; and with them they do\nharm.\nand swore by Him who lives forever\nand ever, who created heaven and the\nthings that are in it, the earth and the\nthings that are in it, and the sea and the\nthings that are in it, that there should be\ndelay no longer,\nBut the rest of mankind, who were not\nkilled by these plagues, did not repent of\nthe works of their hands, that they\nshould not worship demons, and idols of\ngold, silver, brass, stone, and wood,\nwhich can neither see nor hear nor walk.\nbut in the days of the sounding of the\nseventh angel, when he is about to\nsound, the mystery of God would be\nfinished, as He declared to His servants\nthe prophets.\nAnd they did not repent of their\nmurders or their sorceries or their sexual\nimmorality or their thefts.\nThen the voice which I heard from\nheaven spoke to me again and said,\n\"Go, take the little book which is open in\nthe hand of the angel who stands on the\nsea and on the earth.\"\n10I saw still another mighty angel\ncoming down from heaven, clothed with\na cloud. And a rainbow was on his head,\nhis face was like the sun, and his feet\nlike pillars of fire.\nHe had a little book open in his hand.\nAnd he set his right foot on the sea and\nhis left foot on the land,\nSo I went to the angel and said to him,\n\"Give me the little book.\" And he said to\nme, \"Take and eat it; and it will make\nyour stomach bitter, but it will be as\nsweet as honey in your mouth.\"\nThen I took the little book out of the\nangel's hand and ate it, and it was as\nsweet as honey in my mouth. But when I\nhad eaten it, my stomach became bitter.\nAnd he said to me, \"You must\nprophesy again about many peoples,\nnations, tongues, and kings.\"\n11Then I was given a reed like a\nmeasuring rod. And the angel stood,\nsaying, \"Rise and measure the temple of\nGod, the altar, and those who worship\nthere.\nBut leave out the court which is outside\nthe temple, and do not measure it, for it\nhas been given to the Gentiles. And\nthey will tread the holy city underfoot for\nforty-two months.\nAnd I will give power to my two\nwitnesses, and they will prophesy one\nthousand two hundred and sixty days,\nclothed in sackcloth.\"\nThese are the two olive trees and the\ntwo lampstands standing before the God\nof the earth.\nAnd if anyone wants to harm them, fire\nproceeds from their mouth and devours\ntheir enemies. And if anyone wants to\nharm them, he must be killed in this\nmanner.\nThese have power to shut heaven, so\nthat no rain falls in the days of their\nprophecy; and they have power over\nwaters to turn them to blood, and to\nstrike the earth with all plagues, as often\nas they desire.\nWhen they finish their testimony, the\nbeast that ascends out of the bottomless\npit will make war against them,\novercome them, and kill them.\nAnd their dead bodies will lie in the\nstreet of the great city which spiritually is\ncalled Sodom and Egypt, where also our\nLord was crucified.\nThen those from the peoples, tribes,\ntongues, and nations will see their dead\nbodies three-and-a-half days, and not\nallow their dead bodies to be put into\ngraves.\nAnd those who dwell on the earth will\nrejoice over them, make merry, and\nsend gifts to one another, because\nthese two prophets tormented those\nwho dwell on the earth.\nNow after the three-and-a-half days\nthe breath of life from God entered them,\nand they stood on their feet, and great\nfear fell on those who saw them.\nAnd they heard a loud voice from\nheaven saying to them, \"Come up here.\"\nAnd they ascended to heaven in a cloud,\nand their enemies saw them.\nIn the same hour there was a great\nearthquake, and a tenth of the city fell.\nIn the earthquake seven thousand\npeople were killed, and the rest were\nafraid and gave glory to the God of\nheaven.\nThe second woe is past. Behold, the\nthird woe is coming quickly.\nThen the seventh angel sounded: And\nthere were loud voices in heaven,\nsaying, \"The kingdoms of this world\nhave become the kingdoms of our Lord\nand of His Christ, and He shall reign\nforever and ever!\"\nAnd the twenty-four elders who sat\nbefore God on their thrones fell on their\nfaces and worshiped God,\nsaying: \"We give You thanks, O Lord\nGod Almighty, The One who is and who\nwas and who is to come, Because You\nhave taken Your great power and\nreigned.\nThe nations were angry, and Your\nwrath has come, And the time of the\ndead, that they should be judged, And\nthat You should reward Your servants\nthe prophets and the saints, And those\nwho fear Your name, small and great,\nAnd should destroy those who destroy\nthe earth.\"\nThen the temple of God was opened in\nheaven, and the ark of His covenant\nwas seen in His temple. And there were\nlightnings, noises, thunderings, an\nearthquake, and great hail.\n12Now a great sign appeared in\nseven heads and ten horns, and seven\ndiadems on his heads.\nHis tail drew a third of the stars of\nheaven and threw them to the earth.\nAnd the dragon stood before the woman\nwho was ready to give birth, to devour\nher Child as soon as it was born.\nShe bore a male Child who was to rule\nall nations with a rod of iron. And her\nChild was caught up to God and His\nthrone.\nThen the woman fled into the\nwilderness, where she has a place\nprepared by God, that they should feed\nher there one thousand two hundred\nand sixty days.\nAnd war broke out in heaven: Michael\nand his angels fought with the dragon;\nand the dragon and his angels fought,\nbut they did not prevail, nor was a place\nfound for them in heaven any longer.\nSo the great dragon was cast out, that\nserpent of old, called the Devil and\nSatan, who deceives the whole world;\nhe was cast to the earth, and his angels\nwere cast out with him.\nThen being with child, she cried out in\nlabor and in pain to give birth.\nThen I heard a loud voice saying in\nheaven, \"Now salvation, and strength,\nand the kingdom of our God, and the\npower of His Christ have come, for the\naccuser of our brethren, who accused\nthem before our God day and night, has\nbeen cast down.\nheaven: a woman clothed with the sun,\nwith the moon under her feet, and on\nher head a garland of twelve stars.\nAnd another sign appeared in heaven:\nbehold, a great, fiery red dragon having\nAnd they overcame him by the blood\nof the Lamb and by the word of their\ntestimony, and they did not love their\nlives to the death.\nTherefore rejoice, O heavens, and you\nwho dwell in them! Woe to the\ninhabitants of the earth and the sea! For\nthe devil has come down to you, having\ngreat wrath, because he knows that he\nhas a short time.\"\nNow the beast which I saw was like a\nleopard, his feet were like the feet of a\nbear, and his mouth like the mouth of a\nlion. The dragon gave him his power, his\nthrone, and great authority.\nAnd I saw one of his heads as if it had\nbeen mortally wounded, and his deadly\nwound was healed. And all the world\nmarveled and followed the beast.\nNow when the dragon saw that he had\nbeen cast to the earth, he persecuted\nthe woman who gave birth to the male\nChild.\nBut the woman was given two wings of\na great eagle, that she might fly into the\nwilderness to her place, where she is\nnourished for a time and times and half\na time, from the presence of the serpent.\nSo they worshiped the dragon who\ngave authority to the beast; and they\nworshiped the beast, saying, \"Who is\nlike the beast? Who is able to make war\nwith him?\"\nAnd he was given a mouth speaking\ngreat things and blasphemies, and he\nwas given authority to continue for fortytwo months.\nSo the serpent spewed water out of\nhis mouth like a flood after the woman,\nthat he might cause her to be carried\naway by the flood.\nThen he opened his mouth in\nblasphemy against God, to blaspheme\nHis name, His tabernacle, and those\nwho dwell in heaven.\nBut the earth helped the woman, and\nthe earth opened its mouth and\nswallowed up the flood which the\ndragon had spewed out of his mouth.\nIt was granted to him to make war with\nthe saints and to overcome them. And\nauthority was given him over every tribe,\ntongue, and nation.\nAnd the dragon was enraged with the\nwoman, and he went to make war with\nthe rest of her offspring, who keep the\ncommandments of God and have the\ntestimony of Jesus Christ.\n13Then I stood on the sand of the\nsea. And I saw a beast rising up out of\nthe sea, having seven heads and ten\nhorns, and on his horns ten crowns, and\non his heads a blasphemous name.\nAll who dwell on the earth will worship\nhim, whose names have not been\nwritten in the Book of Life of the Lamb\nslain from the foundation of the world.\nIf anyone has an ear, let him hear.\nHe who leads into captivity shall go\ninto captivity; he who kills with the sword\nmust be killed with the sword. Here is\nthe patience and the faith of the saints.\nThen I saw another beast coming up\nout of the earth, and he had two horns\nlike a lamb and spoke like a dragon.\nAnd he exercises all the authority of\nthe first beast in his presence, and\ncauses the earth and those who dwell in\nit to worship the first beast, whose\ndeadly wound was healed.\nHe performs great signs, so that he\neven makes fire come down from\nheaven on the earth in the sight of men.\nAnd he deceives those who dwell on\nthe earth by those signs which he was\ngranted to do in the sight of the beast,\ntelling those who dwell on the earth to\nmake an image to the beast who was\nwounded by the sword and lived.\nHe was granted power to give breath\nto the image of the beast, that the image\nof the beast should both speak and\ncause as many as would not worship\nthe image of the beast to be killed.\n14Then I looked, and behold, a\nLamb standing on Mount Zion, and with\nHim one hundred and forty-four\nthousand, having His Father's name\nwritten on their foreheads.\nAnd I heard a voice from heaven, like\nthe voice of many waters, and like the\nvoice of loud thunder. And I heard the\nsound of harpists playing their harps.\nThey sang as it were a new song\nbefore the throne, before the four living\ncreatures, and the elders; and no one\ncould learn that song except the\nhundred and forty-four thousand who\nwere redeemed from the earth.\nThese are the ones who were not\ndefiled with women, for they are virgins.\nThese are the ones who follow the\nLamb wherever He goes. These were\nredeemed from among men, being\nfirstfruits to God and to the Lamb.\nHe causes all, both small and great,\nrich and poor, free and slave, to receive\na mark on their right hand or on their\nforeheads,\nAnd in their mouth was found no deceit,\nfor they are without fault before the\nthrone of God.\nand that no one may buy or sell except\none who has the mark or the name of\nthe beast, or the number of his name.\nThen I saw another angel flying in the\nmidst of heaven, having the everlasting\ngospel to preach to those who dwell on\nthe earth--to every nation, tribe, tongue,\nand people--\nHere is wisdom. Let him who has\nunderstanding calculate the number of\nthe beast, for it is the number of a man:\nHis number is 666.\nsaying with a loud voice, \"Fear God\nand give glory to Him, for the hour of His\njudgment has come; and worship Him\nwho made heaven and earth, the sea\nand springs of water.\"\nAnd another angel followed, saying,\n\"Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great\ncity, because she has made all nations\ndrink of the wine of the wrath of her\nfornication.\"\nAnd another angel came out of the\ntemple, crying with a loud voice to Him\nwho sat on the cloud, \"Thrust in Your\nsickle and reap, for the time has come\nfor You to reap, for the harvest of the\nearth is ripe.\"\nThen a third angel followed them,\nsaying with a loud voice, \"If anyone\nworships the beast and his image, and\nreceives his mark on his forehead or on\nhis hand,\nSo He who sat on the cloud thrust in\nHis sickle on the earth, and the earth\nwas reaped.\nhe himself shall also drink of the wine\nof the wrath of God, which is poured out\nfull strength into the cup of His\nindignation. He shall be tormented with\nfire and brimstone in the presence of the\nholy angels and in the presence of the\nLamb.\nAnd the smoke of their torment\nascends forever and ever; and they\nhave no rest day or night, who worship\nthe beast and his image, and whoever\nreceives the mark of his name.\"\nHere is the patience of the saints; here\nare those who keep the commandments\nof God and the faith of Jesus.\nThen I heard a voice from heaven\nsaying to me, \"Write: \"Blessed are the\ndead who die in the Lord from now on.\"'\n\"Yes,\" says the Spirit, \"that they may\nrest from their labors, and their works\nfollow them.\"\nThen I looked, and behold, a white\ncloud, and on the cloud sat One like the\nSon of Man, having on His head a\ngolden crown, and in His hand a sharp\nsickle.\nThen another angel came out of the\ntemple which is in heaven, he also\nhaving a sharp sickle.\nAnd another angel came out from the\naltar, who had power over fire, and he\ncried with a loud cry to him who had the\nsharp sickle, saying, \"Thrust in your\nsharp sickle and gather the clusters of\nthe vine of the earth, for her grapes are\nfully ripe.\"\nSo the angel thrust his sickle into the\nearth and gathered the vine of the earth,\nand threw it into the great winepress of\nthe wrath of God.\nAnd the winepress was trampled\noutside the city, and blood came out of\nthe winepress, up to the horses' bridles,\nfor one thousand six hundred furlongs.\n15Then I saw another sign in heaven,\ngreat and marvelous: seven angels\nhaving the seven last plagues, for in\nthem the wrath of God is complete.\nAnd I saw something like a sea of glass\nmingled with fire, and those who have\nthe victory over the beast, over his\nimage and over his mark and over the\nnumber of his name, standing on the\nsea of glass, having harps of God.\nThey sing the song of Moses, the\nservant of God, and the song of the\nLamb, saying: \"Great and marvelous are\nYour works, Lord God Almighty! Just\nand true are Your ways, O King of the\nsaints!\nSo the first went and poured out his\nbowl upon the earth, and a foul and\nloathsome sore came upon the men\nwho had the mark of the beast and\nthose who worshiped his image.\nThen the second angel poured out his\nbowl on the sea, and it became blood as\nof a dead man; and every living creature\nin the sea died.\nWho shall not fear You, O Lord, and\nglorify Your name? For You alone are\nholy. For all nations shall come and\nworship before You, For Your judgments\nhave been manifested.\"\nThen the third angel poured out his\nbowl on the rivers and springs of water,\nand they became blood.\nAfter these things I looked, and behold,\nthe temple of the tabernacle of the\ntestimony in heaven was opened.\nAnd I heard the angel of the waters\nsaying: \"You are righteous, O Lord, The\nOne who is and who was and who is to\nbe, Because You have judged these\nthings.\nAnd out of the temple came the seven\nangels having the seven plagues,\nclothed in pure bright linen, and having\ntheir chests girded with golden bands.\nFor they have shed the blood of saints\nand prophets, And You have given them\nblood to drink. For it is their just due.\"\nThen one of the four living creatures\ngave to the seven angels seven golden\nbowls full of the wrath of God who lives\nforever and ever.\nAnd I heard another from the altar\nsaying, \"Even so, Lord God Almighty,\ntrue and righteous are Your judgments.\"\nThe temple was filled with smoke from\nthe glory of God and from His power,\nand no one was able to enter the temple\ntill the seven plagues of the seven\nangels were completed.\n16Then I heard a loud voice from the\ntemple saying to the seven angels, \"Go\nand pour out the bowls of the wrath of\nGod on the earth.\"\nThen the fourth angel poured out his\nbowl on the sun, and power was given\nto him to scorch men with fire.\nAnd men were scorched with great heat,\nand they blasphemed the name of God\nwho has power over these plagues; and\nthey did not repent and give Him glory.\nThen the fifth angel poured out his\nbowl on the throne of the beast, and his\nkingdom became full of darkness; and\nthey gnawed their tongues because of\nthe pain.\nThey blasphemed the God of heaven\nbecause of their pains and their sores,\nand did not repent of their deeds.\nThen the sixth angel poured out his\nbowl on the great river Euphrates, and\nits water was dried up, so that the way\nof the kings from the east might be\nprepared.\nNow the great city was divided into\nthree parts, and the cities of the nations\nfell.\nAnd\ngreat\nBabylon\nwas\nremembered before God, to give her the\ncup of the wine of the fierceness of His\nwrath.\nThen every island fled away, and the\nmountains were not found.\nAnd I saw three unclean spirits like\nfrogs coming out of the mouth of the\ndragon, out of the mouth of the beast,\nand out of the mouth of the false\nprophet.\nAnd great hail from heaven fell upon\nmen, each hailstone about the weight of\na talent. Men blasphemed God because\nof the plague of the hail, since that\nplague was exceedingly great.\n17Then one of the seven angels who\nFor they are spirits of demons,\nperforming signs, which go out to the\nkings of the earth and of the whole world,\nto gather them to the battle of that great\nday of God Almighty.\n\"Behold, I am coming as a thief.\nBlessed is he who watches, and keeps\nhis garments, lest he walk naked and\nthey see his shame.\"\nAnd they gathered them together to\nthe\nplace\ncalled\nin\nHebrew,\nArmageddon.\nThen the seventh angel poured out his\nbowl into the air, and a loud voice came\nout of the temple of heaven, from the\nthrone, saying, \"It is done!\"\nAnd\nthere\nwere\nnoises\nand\nthunderings and lightnings; and there\nwas a great earthquake, such a mighty\nand great earthquake as had not\noccurred since men were on the earth.\nhad the seven bowls came and talked\nwith me, saying to me, \"Come, I will\nshow you the judgment of the great\nharlot who sits on many waters,\nwith whom the kings of the earth\ncommitted\nfornication,\nand\nthe\ninhabitants of the earth were made\ndrunk with the wine of her fornication.\"\nSo he carried me away in the Spirit into\nthe wilderness. And I saw a woman\nsitting on a scarlet beast which was full\nof names of blasphemy, having seven\nheads and ten horns.\nThe woman was arrayed in purple and\nscarlet, and adorned with gold and\nprecious stones and pearls, having in\nher hand a golden cup full of\nabominations and the filthiness of her\nfornication.\nAnd on her forehead a name was\nwritten: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE\nGREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS\nAND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE\nEARTH.\nThese are of one mind, and they will\ngive their power and authority to the\nbeast.\nI saw the woman, drunk with the blood\nof the saints and with the blood of the\nmartyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I\nmarveled with great amazement.\nThese will make war with the Lamb,\nand the Lamb will overcome them, for\nHe is Lord of lords and King of kings;\nand those who are with Him are called,\nchosen, and faithful.\"\nBut the angel said to me, \"Why did you\nmarvel? I will tell you the mystery of the\nwoman and of the beast that carries her,\nwhich has the seven heads and the ten\nhorns.\nThen he said to me, \"The waters which\nyou saw, where the harlot sits, are\npeoples, multitudes, nations, and\ntongues.\nThe beast that you saw was, and is not,\nand will ascend out of the bottomless pit\nand go to perdition. And those who\ndwell on the earth will marvel, whose\nnames are not written in the Book of Life\nfrom the foundation of the world, when\nthey see the beast that was, and is not,\nand yet is.\n\"Here is the mind which has wisdom:\nThe seven heads are seven mountains\non which the woman sits.\nThere are also seven kings. Five have\nfallen, one is, and the other has not yet\ncome. And when he comes, he must\ncontinue a short time.\nThe beast that was, and is not, is\nhimself also the eighth, and is of the\nseven, and is going to perdition.\n\"The ten horns which you saw are ten\nkings who have received no kingdom as\nyet, but they receive authority for one\nhour as kings with the beast.\nAnd the ten horns which you saw on\nthe beast, these will hate the harlot,\nmake her desolate and naked, eat her\nflesh and burn her with fire.\nFor God has put it into their hearts to\nfulfill His purpose, to be of one mind,\nand to give their kingdom to the beast,\nuntil the words of God are fulfilled.\nAnd the woman whom you saw is that\ngreat city which reigns over the kings of\nthe earth.\"\n18After these things I saw another\nangel coming down from heaven, having\ngreat authority, and the earth was\nilluminated with his glory.\nAnd he cried mightily with a loud voice,\nsaying, \"Babylon the great is fallen, is\nfallen, and has become a dwelling place\nof demons, a prison for every foul spirit,\nand a cage for every unclean and hated\nbird!\nFor all the nations have drunk of the\nwine of the wrath of her fornication, the\nkings of the earth have committed\nfornication with her, and the merchants\nof the earth have become rich through\nthe abundance of her luxury.\"\n\"And the merchants of the earth will\nweep and mourn over her, for no one\nbuys their merchandise anymore:\nAnd I heard another voice from heaven\nsaying, \"Come out of her, my people,\nlest you share in her sins, and lest you\nreceive of her plagues.\nmerchandise of gold and silver,\nprecious stones and pearls, fine linen\nand purple, silk and scarlet, every kind\nof citron wood, every kind of object of\nivory, every kind of object of most\nprecious wood, bronze, iron, and\nmarble;\nFor her sins have reached to heaven,\nand God has remembered her iniquities.\nRender to her just as she rendered to\nyou, and repay her double according to\nher works; in the cup which she has\nmixed, mix double for her.\nIn the measure that she glorified herself\nand lived luxuriously, in the same\nmeasure give her torment and sorrow;\nfor she says in her heart, \"I sit as queen,\nand am no widow, and will not see\nsorrow.'\nTherefore her plagues will come in one\nday--death and mourning and famine.\nAnd she will be utterly burned with fire,\nfor strong is the Lord God who judges\nher.\nand cinnamon and incense, fragrant oil\nand frankincense, wine and oil, fine flour\nand wheat, cattle and sheep, horses\nand chariots, and bodies and souls of\nmen.\nThe fruit that your soul longed for has\ngone from you, and all the things which\nare rich and splendid have gone from\nyou, and you shall find them no more at\nall.\nThe merchants of these things, who\nbecame rich by her, will stand at a\ndistance for fear of her torment, weeping\nand wailing,\nand saying, \"Alas, alas, that great city\nthat was clothed in fine linen, purple,\nand scarlet, and adorned with gold and\nprecious stones and pearls!\n\"The kings of the earth who committed\nfornication and lived luxuriously with her\nwill weep and lament for her, when they\nsee the smoke of her burning,\nFor in one hour such great riches\ncame to nothing.' Every shipmaster, all\nwho travel by ship, sailors, and as many\nas trade on the sea, stood at a distance\nstanding at a distance for fear of her\ntorment, saying, \"Alas, alas, that great\ncity Babylon, that mighty city! For in one\nhour your judgment has come.'\nand cried out when they saw the\nsmoke of her burning, saying, \"What is\nlike this great city?'\n\"They threw dust on their heads and\ncried out, weeping and wailing, and\nsaying, \"Alas, alas, that great city, in\nwhich all who had ships on the sea\nbecame rich by her wealth!

He had\na name written that no one knew except\nHimself.\nHe was clothed with a robe dipped in\nblood, and His name is called The Word\nof God.\nAnd the armies in heaven, clothed in\nfine linen, white and clean, followed Him\non white horses.\nNow out of His mouth goes a sharp\nsword, that with it He should strike the\nnations.

Her light was\nlike a most precious stone, like a jasper\nstone, clear as crystal.\nAlso she had a great and high wall\nwith twelve gates, and twelve angels at\nthe gates, and names written on them,\nthree gates on the east, three gates on\nthe north, three gates on the south, and\nthree gates on the west.\nNow the wall of the city had twelve\nfoundations, and on them were the\nnames of the twelve apostles of the\nLamb.\nAnd he who talked with me had a gold\nreed to measure the city, its gates, and\nits wall.\nThe city is laid out as a square; its\nlength is as great as its breadth.

The Lamb is its light.\nAnd the nations of those who are\nsaved shall walk in its light, and the\nkings of the earth bring their glory and\nhonor into it.\nbe in it, and His servants shall serve\nHim.\nThey shall see His face, and His name\nshall be on their foreheads.\nThere shall be no night there: They\nneed no lamp nor light of the sun, for the\nLord God gives them light. And they\nshall reign forever and ever.\nThen he said to me, \"These words are\nfaithful and true.\" And the Lord God of\nthe holy prophets sent His angel to\nshow His servants the things which\nmust shortly take place.\nIts gates shall not be shut at all by day\n(there shall be no night there).\n\"Behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed\nis he who keeps the words of the\nprophecy of this book.\"\nAnd they shall bring the glory and the\nhonor of the nations into it.\nBut there shall by no means enter it\nanything that defiles, or causes an\nabomination or a lie, but only those who\nare written in the Lamb's Book of Life.\n22And he showed me a pure river of\nwater of life, clear as crystal, proceeding\nfrom the throne of God and of the Lamb.\nIn the middle of its street, and on either\nside of the river, was the tree of life,\nwhich bore twelve fruits, each tree\nyielding its fruit every month. The leaves\nof the tree were for the healing of the\nnations.\nAnd there shall be no more curse, but\nthe throne of God and of the Lamb shall\nNow I, John, saw and heard these\nthings. And when I heard and saw, I fell\ndown to worship before the feet of the\nangel who showed me these things.\nThen he said to me, \"See that you do\nnot do that. For I am your fellow servant,\nand of your brethren the prophets, and\nof those who keep the words of this\nbook. Worship God.\"\nAnd he said to me, \"Do not seal the\nwords of the prophecy of this book, for\nthe time is at hand.\nHe who is unjust, let him be unjust still;\nhe who is filthy, let him be filthy still; he\nwho is righteous, let him be righteous\nstill; he who is holy, let him be holy still.\"\n\"And behold, I am coming quickly, and\nMy reward is with Me, to give to every\none according to his work.\nI am the Alpha and the Omega, the\nBeginning and the End, the First and the\nLast.\"\nBlessed are those who do His\ncommandments, that they may have the\nright to the tree of life, and may enter\nthrough the gates into the city.\nAnd the Spirit and the bride say,\n\"Come!\" And let him who hears say,\n\"Come!\" And let him who thirsts come.\nWhoever desires, let him take the water\nof life freely.\nFor I testify to everyone who hears the\nwords of the prophecy of this book: If\nanyone adds to these things, God will\nadd to him the plagues that are written\nin this book;\nBut outside are dogs and sorcerers\nand sexually immoral and murderers\nand idolaters, and whoever loves and\npractices a lie.\nand if anyone takes away from the\nwords of the book of this prophecy, God\nshall take away his part from the Book\nof Life, from the holy city, and from the\nthings which are written in this book.\n\"I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify\nto you these things in the churches. I am\nthe Root and the Offspring of David, the\nBright and Morning Star.\"\nHe who testifies to these things says,\n\"Surely I am coming quickly.\" Amen.\nEven so, come, Lord Jesus!\nThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be\nwith you all.
