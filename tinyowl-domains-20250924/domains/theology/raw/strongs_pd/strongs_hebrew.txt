                                         PREFACE

THIS work, although prepared as a companion to the Exhaustive Concordance, to which
it is specially adapted is here paged and printed so that it can be bound separately, in the
belief that a brief and simple Dictionary of the Biblical Hebrew and Chaldee will be
useful to students and others, who do not care at all times to consult a more copious and
elaborate Lexicon; and it will be particularly serviceable to many who are unable to turn
conveniently and rapidly, amid the perplexities and details of foreign characters with
which the pages of Gesenius and Furst bristle, to the fundamental and essential points of
information that they are seeking. Even scholars will find here, not only all of a strictly
verbal character which they most frequently want in ordinary consultation of a lexicon,
but numerous original suggestions, relations, and distinctions, carefully made and clearly
put, which are not unworthy of their attention, especially in the affinities of roots and the
classification of meanings. The compact form and moderate cost of the book, it is hoped,
will facilitate its use with all classes. The vocabulary is complete as to the ground-forms
that actually occur in the biblical text (or Kethib), with the pointing that properly belongs
to them. Their designation by numbers will especially aid those who are not very
familiar with the original language, and the Anglicizing and pronunciation of the words
will not come amiss to multitudes who have some acquaintance with it. The addition of
the renderings in the common version will greatly contribute to fixing and extending the
varied significations and applications of the Hebrew and Chaldee words, as well as to
correcting their occasionally wrong translations. On this account, as well as for the sake
of precision and to prevent repetition, the use of the same terms in the preceding
definitions has been avoided wherever practicable. The design of the volume, being
purely lexical, does not include grammatical, archaeological, or exegetical details, which
would have swelled its size and encumbered its plan.

By observing the subjoined directions, in the associated use of the Main and Comparative
Concordances, the reader will have substantially a Concordance-Dictionary of both the
Authorized and the Revised English Versions, as well as of the Hebrew Bible.




                         Copyright. 1890. By JAMES STRONG,

                                 PLAN OF THE BOOK

1. All the original words are treated in their alphabetical Hebrew order, and are numbered
regularly from the first to the last, each being known throughout by its appropriate
number. This renders reference easy without recourse to the Hebrew characters

2. Immediately after each word is given its exact equivalent in English letters, according
to the system of transliteration laid down in the scheme here following, which is
substantially that adopted in the Common English Version, only more consistently and
uniformly carried out; so that the word could be readily be turned back again into Hebrew
from the form thus given it.

3. Next follows the precise pronunciation, according to the usual English mode of
sounding syllables, so plainly indicated that none can fail to apprehend and apply it. The
most approved sounds are adopted, as laid down in the annexed scheme of articulation,
and in such a way that any good Hebraist would immediately recognize the word if so
pronounce, notwithstanding the minor variations current among scholars in this respect.

4. Then ensues a tracing of the etymology, radical meaning, and applied signification of
the word, justly but tersely analyzed and expressed, with any other important peculiarities
in this regard.

5. In the case of proper names, the same method is pursued, and at this point the regular
mode of Anglicizing it, after the general style of the Common English Version, is given,
and a few words of explanation are added to identify it.

6. Finally (after the punctuation-mark :--) are given all the different renderings of the
word in the Authorized English Version, arranged in the alphabetical order of the leading
terms, and conveniently condensed according to the explanations given below.

By searching out these various renderings in the MAIN CONCORDANCE, to which this
dictionary is designed as a companion, and noting the passages to which the same
number corresponding to that of any given Hebrew word is attached in the marginal
column, the reader, whether acquainted with the original language or not, will obtain a
complete Hebrew Concordance also, expressed in the words of the Common English
Version. This is an advantage which no other Concordance or Lexicon affords.
                                   SIGNS EMPLOYED

       (degree), appended to a Heb.word, denotes a vowel-pointing correct from the text.
