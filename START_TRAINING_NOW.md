## DURING TRAINING

### Can I close the browser?
**Yes!** Training continues in Google's cloud.

**BUT**: Colab free tier may disconnect after ~12 hours idle.

**Best practice**:
- Leave browser tab open
- Check back every few hours
- OR: Use Colab Pro ($10/month) for guaranteed completion

---

### How do I know it's working?

**Look for**:
- Progress bars moving
- Loss values decreasing
- No error messages
- Green checkmarks ‚úì appearing

**If you see errors**:
- Read the error message
- Usually it's: "GPU not enabled" or "File not found"
- Fix and re-run that cell

---

### What if I get disconnected?

**Don't panic!**
- Notebook saves checkpoints every 500 steps
- Re-run the cell where it stopped
- Training continues from last checkpoint

---

## AFTER TRAINING (12-20 Hours Later)

### Download Your Model

1. Run the **final cell** (creates zip file)
2. Look at **left sidebar** (files)
3. Find **tinyowl-1.0.zip**
4. **Right-click** ‚Üí **Download**

**CRITICAL**: Download before closing Colab!
- Colab deletes files when session ends
- You lose your model if you don't download

---

2. **Quantize to GGUF** (make smaller/faster)
3. **Package with chat app**
4. **Create installer**
5. **Ship TinyOwl to the world**

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks after training completes

## COSTS

**This training session**:
- Google Colab GPU: **$0** (free tier)
- Q&A generation (already done): ~$10
- **Total new cost: $0**

**Optional**:
- Colab Pro ($10/month): Better GPU, longer sessions, no disconnects

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Runtime disconnected"
‚Üí Reconnect and re-run from where it stopped

### "GPU not available"
‚Üí Runtime ‚Üí Change runtime type ‚Üí T4 GPU ‚Üí Save

### "File not found"
‚Üí Make sure both .jsonl files are uploaded to /content/

### "Out of memory"
‚Üí Shouldn't happen with T4. Restart runtime and try again.

### Training seems stuck
‚Üí It's not stuck, it's slow. Each epoch takes hours. Be patient.
